Below the age of 18 you are treated as a minor in both the foster care system and the criminal justice system. Full citizenship rights including voting should be gained at adulthood.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI think it is also important for me to point out that votes at 16 are administratively impossible to deliver in the time available - there would be less than three weeks before the voter registration deadline to register 16 and 17-year-olds.\u201d\n\nAnd on EU nationals potentially being given the vote, the PM\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cChanging the election franchise days before an election could cause administrative chaos.\n\n\u201cThere would be between 2.4 million to three million people added to the electoral roll at the last minute with no idea on the cost or logistical burden this could cause.\n\n\u201cThis may in turn lead to delays with polling cards, postal votes and at polling stations that could undermine everyone's ability to vote in the election.\n\n\u201cIt would also mean EU nationals in the UK enjoying wider voting rights than UK nationals in any other country other than Ireland. Citizenship requirements are the norm in national elections in democracies including the United Kingdom.\u201d", "description": "Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has backed a pre-Christmas general election after telling his shadow cabinet that the party\u2019s condition of taking a no-deal Brexit \u201coff the table\u201d has been met.
