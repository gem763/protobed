Officers returned fire and two suffered non-life-threatening injuries, police said. It is unclear if they were struck by gunfire.\n\nAD\n\nLiz Lambert, a resident on the block, said she heard a total of about 10 gunshots in two quick bursts. She also said she saw an officer holding his head as if he had been hurt. He was being escorted down the street by two other officers, Lambert said.\n\nAD\n\nShe said she was reassured to see that the officer was walking.\n\nNeighbors in the area said they had been notified by telephone to stay indoors.\n\nAfter the gunfire exchange, the man barricaded himself inside the home, police said. Shortly before 12:30 a.m. Tuesday, Fairfax County police tweeted that a SWAT team was on the scene. The SWAT team eventually entered the home and found two adult men and a woman dead, including the man who had opened fire on police.\n\nAD\n\nShortly before 2 a.m., police tweeted the barricade situation was over and there was no longer a threat to the public.\n\nA state medical examiner will be conducting autopsies to confirm a cause and manner of death. The identities of the victims are being withheld pending notification of next of kin.\n\nFairfax County police have scheduled a noon news conference to provide an update.\n\n\u201cThis is a very complex crime scene,\u201d said Lisa Connors, a Fairfax County police spokeswoman.\n\nAD", "description": "Fairfax County police said a man opened fire on officers as they responded to the scene.", "authors": ["Justin Jouvenal", "Reporter Covering Courts", "Policing", "Martin Weil", "Local Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/fKDLj--aYQFVZSoQG6y6QYhmNLo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/L7ARJZXUY4I6TIUFRAVI4ODKSY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
