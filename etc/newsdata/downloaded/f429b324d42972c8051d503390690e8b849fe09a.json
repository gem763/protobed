During the call, Trump asked Zelensky to investigate potential corruption between then-Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter's, connection to a Ukrainian gas company. Biden threatened to fire a prosecutor who was investigating the gas company which Hunter sat on the board of directors of.\n\nFormer Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA), however, believes the whistleblower should be \"heard out and protected.\"\n\n\u201cThis person appears to have followed the whistleblower protection laws and ought to be heard out and protected. We should always work to respect whistleblowers\u2019 requests for confidentiality. Any further media reports on the whistleblower\u2019s identity don\u2019t serve the public interest\u2014even if the conflict sells more papers or attracts clicks,\" Grassley said in a statement.\n\n\u201cNo one should be making judgments or pronouncements without hearing from the whistleblower first and carefully following up on the facts. Uninformed speculation wielded by politicians or media commentators as a partisan weapon is counterproductive and doesn\u2019t serve the country,\" he explained.\n\nAccording to the senator, it doesn't matter whether or not the whistleblower's information came second or third-hand; he still deserves to be protected.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to whether someone qualifies as a whistleblower, the distinctions being drawn between first- and second-hand knowledge aren\u2019t legal ones. It\u2019s just not part of whistleblower protection law or any agency policy,\" the senator said. \"Complaints based on second-hand information should not be rejected out of hand, but they do require additional leg work to get at the facts and evaluate the claim\u2019s credibility.\"\n\nGrassley is Chair of the Senate Whistleblower Protection Caucus. He has been responsible for many of the laws that protect whistleblowers.", "description": "Hmm..10/01/2019 20:32:20PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien", "Guy Benson"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/271/1bac5001-9d86-4945-9389-87994e53e2b4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
