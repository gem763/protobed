Orion is meant to be integrated into game engines to make this magic happen.\n\nThe company noted this could mean lower data costs for broadband users, and increased availability of game streaming services for players worldwide \u2013 by reducing the requirements to enable streaming.\n\nWe already know that Google\u2019s Stadia requires a 25Mbps connection to work as advertised, so it\u2019s safe to assume that rivals will make similar demands of your broadband and mobile networks. Orion could help bring down the barrier to entry a bit.\n\nAnd while it\u2019s not launching a service of its own, Bethesda will publicly test Orion by allowing gamers to stream the company\u2019s 2016 blockbuster FPS, DOOM, on iOS devices \u2013 without installing the game locally; Android and PC streaming will follow soon after. Just don\u2019t expect multiplayer in the initial trial.\n\nYou can sign up here to be included in the test, which will go live later this year.\n\nRead next: iOS 13 will show you where apps have tracked your location, on a map", "description": "Orion optimizes cloud gaming performance, as to reduce latency by up to 20 percent per frame, and reduce bandwidth requirements by up to 40 percent.", "authors": ["Abhimanyu Ghoshal"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F06%2FOrion-Doom-Bethesda-hed.jpg&signature=6e1aea58aec3c7f562dd6f231aae3006", "published_at": "2019-06-10"}
