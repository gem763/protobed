(iStock)\n\nThe threats came from 369 Instagram accounts and 18 different email addresses. But they were all controlled by one woman.\n\nFBI agents say fitness trainer and mother of four Tammy Steffen used those accounts to unleash a torrent of harassment on her ex-business partner at a Tampa gym and on her competitors in the bodybuilding world.\n\n\u201cI plan to slice you up into little pieces,\u201d read one message sent from an innocuously named Instagram account, catloverexpress. \u201cYour blood shall I taste.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, the 37-year-old woman was sentenced to almost five years in prison after pleading guilty to federal charges of cyberstalking and sending threatening communications online.\n\n\u201cThe extent of her crime is astounding,\u201d FBI special agent Kristin Rehler told WFLA.\n\nBut the cyberstalking, which targeted five victims in three states, is just one aspect of a strange saga. Authorities say Steffen, 37, also deployed a headless baby doll and a fake kidnapping scheme to try to exact revenge on her former business partner. The reason? She believed he had sabotaged her chances of winning an online fitness competition \u2014 an allegation authorities said is untrue.\n\nIt started with the headless doll. On July 9, 2018, Steffen called the sheriff\u2019s office to report that someone had left the ominous item on the front porch of her two-story house in the Tampa suburb of Holiday, according to an arrest report. Inside the doll was a note: \u201cNew toy for the kids.\u201d\n\n[Michelle Carter, who went to jail for encouraging her boyfriend to kill himself, is denied parole]\n\nFive days later, Steffen phoned the sheriff\u2019s office again \u2014 this time to tell them someone had tried to kidnap her daughter. The 12-year-old girl had been feeding the family\u2019s dogs when, Steffen said, a Hispanic man had tried to snatch her and drag her into the woods. The child had urinated on herself out of fear.\n\nSteffen led deputies to the place where she said the purported kidnapping had occurred, and pointed out a laptop case hidden in the brush. Inside was a notepad filled with personal information on Steffen and her home. The girl described her attacker, and her mother named the former business colleague as a potential suspect. Authorities took the report seriously, using helicopters and dogs to search the woods.\n\n\n\nTammy Steffen pleaded guilty to cyberstalking charges. (Pasco County Sheriff's Office/Pasco County Sheriff's Office)\n\nBut deputies became suspicious when the child \u201cquestioned what would happen to [her mother] if she told the truth.\u201d They uncovered Walmart surveillance footage showing that Steffen had purchased the laptop cover and blue notebook. They concluded she had even forced her daughter to urinate on herself in a bid to make the story more believable, and had concocted the scheme after planting the headless doll didn\u2019t net the response she wanted.\n\n\u201cYou get false reports quite frequently,\u201d Pasco County Sheriff\u2019s Office spokesman Kevin Doll said. \u201cTo the extent that this woman went? Not to that extent. And from what she claims is the reason for doing it, that\u2019s even more puzzling.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re talking 10 to 20 people for a number of days investigating this and subsequent reports that she had made,\u201d Doll said.\n\n[Officers responded to a wreck. They found the driver\u2019s wife in his van, dead for weeks, police say.]\n\nSteffen was arrested July 17 on charges of filing a false police report, tampering with evidence and child neglect. Deputies added witness tampering charges days later, after she called her daughter from a recorded jail phone line and told her to claim responsibility for the kidnapping plot.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t get in trouble,\u201d Steffen told her daughter, according to a report, \u201cbut I will.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the trouble was just beginning for Steffen. In November, federal agents arrested her on the stalking charges. According to the criminal complaint, she sent hundreds of messages to individual victims, the former business partner among them. She also tried to discredit them professionally and made threats to their lives and the lives of their families and friends.\n\n\u201cAll hell is gonna rain fire down on your world like never seen before,\u201d one January 2017 message read. \u201cYou have picked the wrong person to mess with. You have no idea what you\u2019ve done. I will be catching the next flight to Michigan out of here.\"\n\nIn another instance, the FBI said, Steffen called the business owned by a Collier County, Fla., woman so many times that the company was unable to receive calls from customers. She also changed the business\u2019s voice-mail message to \u201csounds of a sexual nature, including people moaning in the background.\u201d\n\nSteffen\u2019s messages and calls caused \u201csubstantial emotional distress\u201d to the victims, who saw them as true threats, the FBI said.\n\nShe had no criminal record before 2018 according to her attorney, Keith Hammond, who declined to comment on the case. The fitness expert, who will begin her 57-month sentence for the cyberstalking charges after serving just under a year in jail for the false kidnapping incident, wrote in a letter to the judge that she was sorry for her actions.\n\n\u201cWhile no one wants to have legal proceedings,\u201d she wrote, \u201cI am thankful for the intervention in my life.\u201d\n\nAn earlier version of this story identified Tammy Steffen as a bodybuilder. She is better described as a fitness expert.\n\nRead more:\n\nShe left a can of dry shampoo in her car.
