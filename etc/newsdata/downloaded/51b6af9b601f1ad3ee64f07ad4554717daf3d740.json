However, overtime the pair realised that they had more in common than most, and they bonded as a result.\n\nOver the last couple of weeks, they\u2019ve spent quite a bit of time in each other\u2019s company and, last week, Daniel admitted his true feelings for Jean, and the pair shared a kiss as a result. Earlier this week, they resolves to spend the day in The Queen Vic, and \u2014 while doing so \u2014 they shared yet another special moment together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Jean\u2019s world is set to come crashing down in tonight\u2019s episode, as she receives devastating news: Daniel has died.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t quite hit Jean at first, and Kush (David Ghadami) becomes a bit concerned about her complacent reaction to the news of her friend\u2019s passing, and thus he decides to talk to her.\n\nAfterwards, Jean realises just how much Daniel actually meant to her.\n\nEastEnders continues on Thursday 10th October at 7:30pm on BBC One.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Jean's left devastated.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/18640173-low_res-eastenders-october-december-2019-3547_1570702149.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
