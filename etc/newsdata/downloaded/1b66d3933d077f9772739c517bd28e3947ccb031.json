Howell\n\nPublished by Usborne\n\nISBN 978 1 4749 5955 1\n\nA chance discovery often kick-starts a writer\u2019s imagination, and debut novelist A. M. Howell came up with the idea for The Garden Of Lost Secrets when she found a gardener\u2019s notebook in a shed on a country estate in the English county of Suffolk.\n\nWho would have thought that a novel about the theft of pineapples could be such a thrilling read? Howell sets her story in the gardens attached to an English country mansion in 1916, and here pineapples are as valuable as gold.\n\nBritain is at war with Germany, and 12-year-old Clara is staying with her aunt and uncle who work for an English earl on his estate. Clara\u2019s father, back home from Northern France to recover from gas poisoning, needs time and space to recover, so his daughter is packed off out of the way.\n\nWhy the author of See You In The Cosmos doesn't focus on his ethnicity\n\nMr and Mrs Gilbert, Clara\u2019s uncle and aunt, work as housekeeper and gardener for the earl, and Clara is looking forward to going to stay with them. But Mrs Gilbert is not the kindly aunt that Clara remembers. She seems distant and preoccupied, and supplies Clara with a list of rules for how she is to conduct herself in the earl\u2019s garden. Certain places are out of bounds, including the hothouses where the earl grows pineapples. The locked room in the Gilberts\u2019 cottage is also out of bounds.\n\nWith the first world war (1914-1918) in the background, Howell recreates the running of a large country estate where life is difficult because so many men have been called away to fight in France. Who will supply the wounded soldiers in the local hospital with food if no one works the vegetable beds and orchards on the earl\u2019s estate?\n\nAs Clara explores the sections of the gardens that are allowed, she meets Robert, an under-gardener, and his younger brother, Will. Robert can\u2019t fight in the war because he is blind in one eye. Will works in an underground room where boilers create steam to heat the hothouses.\n\nThe Watchmaker of Filigree Street writer Natasha Pulley blends history with fantasy in her award-winning books\n\nWhen a pineapple is stolen, Will becomes the number one suspect. The children try to clear Will\u2019s name and, during their investigation, they unearth a string of secrets hidden in the earl\u2019s vast garden.\n\nHowell is very good at creating suspense, much of it to do with Clara\u2019s family as well as mysteries hidden in the garden. She unearths truths about the family she thought she knew, and has to find the courage to save herself and those around her.\n\nThe Garden Of Lost Secrets is all about setting and story, and both are well realised here. Mystery thrillers set in enclosed locations often lose momentum as they play out, but Howell keeps the story well fed and ties up all the loose ends.\n\nThis is perfect for fans of mystery tales that bring a slice of the past back to life and tell a cracking story.\n\nJohn Millen can be contacted at millenbookshelf@gma\u00adil.com", "description": "The YA novel, set in Britain during WWI, is a great choice for fans of thrillers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/e9c81586-ea4a-11e9-9e8e-4022fb9638c4imagehires164731.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
