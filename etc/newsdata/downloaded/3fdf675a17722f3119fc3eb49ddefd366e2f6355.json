I make him tired and he tapped,\" he told Becky Anderson for CNN's Connect the World.\n\n\"And people understand his level, people understand my level. I do everything what I want. I stand up with him, I wrestled with him, I grappled with him, he tapped.\n\n\"I don't feel like I have to improve something inside the cage with him. And we have a lot of good contenders who deserve a title shot, and I'm going to fight with other opponents.\"\n\nRespect\n\nWhile McGregor is known for his hard-hitting, high-flying style in the octagon, it was his trash talking outside the ring that shot him to stardom.\n\nAnd it's fair to say that after their war of words ahead of their Las Vegas fight, Nurmagomedov and McGregor aren't the best of friends.\n\nNurmagomedov faces-off with McGregor during the UFC 229 Press Conference.\n\nWhile exchanging barbs is commonplace nowadays ahead of UFC fights, Nurmagomedov thought McGregor crossed a line with his insults, explaining his volatile reaction to winning in Las Vegas.\n\nAnd although he acknowledges that trash talking is now part of the UFC, the undefeated fighter believes that by mentioning his family, religion and parents, McGregor caused him a \"big disrespect.\"\n\n\"If people try to give me respect, I'm going to give them respect,\" the 30-year-old said. \"If they go crazy with me, I'm going to go crazy with them.\n\n\"And UFC think I'm just a nice guy or something like this. I'm a nice guy to who's nice with me. If people [are] not nice with me, I'm not a nice guy.\"\n\nNurmagomedov is escorted out of the arena after defeating Conor McGregor.\n\nFather figure\n\nNot only do UFC coaches play a vital role in the preparation of their fighters ahead of bouts, but they also play an important part during the actual fight.\n\nThey offer tactical advice between each round to give their fighter the upper hand and hopefully, help them on the way to victory.\n\nNurmagomedov and and his father Abdulmanap give a press conference in Moscow.\n\nSo, imagine training for weeks on end with your coach and then not being able to have them in your corner for the fight?\n\nThis is what Nurmagomedov has had to deal with at both UFC 209 and 229 as his father (who is also his coach) -- Abdulmanap Nurmagomedov -- was denied a visa to allow him into the US on both occasions.\n\nBut because UFC 242 is being held in Abu Dhabi -- as part of the UFC's five-year partnership with the Department of Culture and Tourism (DCT Abu Dhabi) -- Abdulmanap will be in his son's corner for the first time in his UFC career, something that means a great deal to the UFC Lightweight Champion.\n\n\"And this is mean a lot for me, and for him too, because a lot of people see fighters, but they don't see coaches,\" he said.\n\n\"And I want people understand how great my father is. Because he has a lot of champions, world champions. And I'm very happy to have him in my corner.\"\n\nReturning to the octagon\n\nFollowing his ban and $500,000 fine for his clash with McGregor's team, no one was able to challenge Nurmagomedov for his UFC title.\n\nTherefore, in the meantime, an interim UFC lightweight championship was created and won by Poirier at UFC 236 when he defeated Max Holloway.\n\nDustin Poirier celebrates after recieving the title belt from UFC President Dana White.\n\nBut despite Poirier holding the interim championship belt and a 21-5-1 record, Nurmagomedov is certain the fight will be a one-sided affair.\n\n\"Khabib going to smash Dustin, inshallah. And that's it,\" the Dagestan fighter said confidently. \"If people want to see how one athlete can smash another athlete.\n\n\"And I don't like the posters, they call us champ versus champ. This is not champ versus champ. I am the champ. He is interim champ. This is big difference.\n\n\"It's going to be a dogfight if I want. If I didn't want, I'm going to dominate him. And I don't people think I'm Anthony Pettis, Justin Gaethje, or Eddie Alvarez, or Max Holloway. I'm completely different fighter.\n\n\"And when I go to the cage, I all the time control my opponents. And it's like, dogfight is going to for him, not for me. Because I'm going to dominate.\"", "description": "He's been to watch his local football club Anzhi Makhachkala play, he's called out boxing legend Floyd Mayweather and he's even fought a bear.", "authors": ["Ben Morse", "For Cnn"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181015143329-khalib-nurmagomedov-ufc-belt-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
