It\u2019s conceivable.", "language": "en", "text": "A 269-to-269 electoral college tie looms! The new House of Representatives can break it in January 2021, with 50 state delegations entitled to one vote each and 26 needed to win. Alas, voters picked 25 GOP-majority delegations, 22 Democratic and three split.\n\nThen each party frantically lobbies the 538 presidential electors, hoping one will switch sides before electoral votes are cast on Dec. 14, thus assuring a 270-vote victory without a struggle in the House.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSeveral electors express interest, only to run afoul of statutes in 32 states and the District that bind them to their pre-election pledges.\n\nLawyers rush to court to \u201cfree the electors,\u201d but lower courts reach conflicting conclusions because there is no binding Supreme Court precedent. The justices themselves have no choice but to convene amid the crisis. Trump issues vulgar threats on Twitter. \u201cPro-democracy\u201d demonstrators occupy Capitol Hill.\n\nFortunately, the justices have an opportunity right now to spare the country, and themselves, this nightmare.\n\nTwo newly filed appeals \u2014 Baca v. Colorado Department of State and Chiafalo v. Washington \u2014 present the issue of whether the Constitution allows states to fine, replace and otherwise punish presidential electors who violated pledges to vote for the winner of state popular votes, or whether it made the electors free agents.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf they accept the cases soon, the justices can hold arguments and rule by next July, well in advance of the November election.\n\nIt\u2019s an age-old question. The framers of the Constitution touted the electoral college as an elite independent body, but it quickly evolved into a partisan one, selected according to political loyalty. This long-standing custom has hardened into a popular-vote-winner-take-all norm applying to each state\u2019s electoral votes (except in Nebraska and Maine, which allocate some by congressional district).\n\nStill, since 1796, some 167 electors have voted, or attempted to vote, for candidates not backed by the voters of their states; generally Congress has counted their votes, in part because \u201cfaithless electors\u201d never changed the outcome.\n\nAD\n\nIn 1952, the Supreme Court ruled that states could permit parties to bind their own primary candidates for presidential elector to vote for the party\u2019s nominee, but has never resolved the slightly, and crucially, different issue of whether such an obligation could be enforced on the winners in November.\n\nAD\n\nA wonderful thing about this question is that it has no characteristically Republican or Democratic answer \u2014 faithless electors can strike either party, and they have.\n\nIn 2016, it was Democrats who tried to encourage electors\u2019 latent independence, in a last-ditch effort to get Trump-pledged electors to back the popular vote winner, Hillary Clinton \u2014 or at least a third person, to deny any candidate an electoral-vote majority and throw the contest into the House.\n\nAD\n\nMichael Signer, at the time the Democratic mayor of Charlottesville, suggested that the electors \u201cbe given the resources and support by relevant state agencies to fully deliberate on the issues before them. Their meetings should be run under Robert\u2019s Rules of Order and be open to citizens and to the media. If they are unable to conclude their deliberations [by the statutory deadline], they should be able to deliberate as long as they reasonably need to make their choice.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn the end, two Trump electors and five pledged to Clinton voted for other people \u2014 not enough to alter the result.\n\nHowever, it would have been a different story in a 269-to-269 tie, or a replay of the 271-to-266 cliffhanger in 2000. Perhaps with that in mind, Washington state and Colorado enforced their bans against faithless electors in 2016, and the electors\u2019 legal appeals ended in conflicting rulings.\n\nAD\n\nWashington\u2019s supreme court, extrapolating from the 1952 Supreme Court ruling, concluded that the states\u2019 constitutional power to \u201cappoint\u201d electors included the power to control their votes; thus, levying $1,000 fines on three Clinton-pledged electors who voted for former secretary of state Colin Powell was perfectly constitutional.\n\nThe Denver-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, by contrast, ruled that a Clinton elector in Colorado who tried to vote for John Kasich had every right to do so.\n\nAD\n\nElectors are federal officials, beyond state control, the 10th Circuit opinion noted; and Alexander Hamilton himself once described them as \u201ccapable of analyzing the qualities\u201d of a good president and \u201cacting under circumstances favorable to deliberation.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe clashing decisions present the Supreme Court with a choice, not between red and blue, but between pragmatism and formalism.\n\nThe justices can bless existing state laws, constitutionalizing the rough, but settled, expectations on which those laws rest. Or they can upend laws and expectations, in the name of faithfulness to the framers\u2019 intent.\n\nThe country can probably adapt to either result, if it comes well before November; the only thing the court cannot do is wait.\n\nAD\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The Supreme Court has a chance to spare the country this ordeal before the election.", "authors": ["Charles Lane", "Editorial Writer", "Columnist Specializing In Economic", "Fiscal Policy", "Opinion Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/rXImrryF6TDAtnpKZ0jPkxW5WKc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CZVFRPXZYQI6TCIGVNVWBXUREQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
