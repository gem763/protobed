He was 84.\n\nBoll confirmed Taylor\u2019s death and said he died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, Calif., after being hospitalized last week following a seizure.\n\nBorn as Charles Elmer Taylor Jr., the TV game show guest and comedy circuit prop-comic mainstay for decades got his start in entertaining while serving in the Korean War, Boll said.\n\nHis first of many TV spots came in 1964 on The Ed Sullivan Show, during which he acquired the nickname of \u201cThe Crying Comedian.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, he told Lifestyle Magazine TV that his iconic bit started when he was called on to the stage and the eponymous host, Ed Sullivan, forgot his name.\n\n\u201cHe forgot my name. He couldn\u2019t read the cue card and I pulled a hair from my nose and tears came down and they pushed me on and he says, \u2018The Crying Comedian\u2019 and that\u2019s how that happened,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nThroughout the 1970s, he became a household name for his schtick of dousing contestants on Hollywood Squares, The Gong Show and The Match Game in heaps of confetti.\n\n\u201cThe greatest joy Rip had in life was from the result of making others laugh. He didn\u2019t have an easy childhood. Abused and bullied, he said he discovered early that they weren\u2019t hitting you if they were laughing,\u201d Boll said.\n\nTim Long, a longtime writer on The Simpsons, took to Twitter following news of Taylor\u2019s death and said not only was Taylor \u201ckind,\u201d and \u201chilarious\u201d but he was \u201ca brave spokesperson for survivors of abuse.\u201d\n\nActress and comedian Sandra Bernhard said one of her first TV show appearances was as a contestant on the game show The $1.98 Beauty Show, which Taylor presented.\n\n\u201cHe was one of a kind, madcap, unapologetic, and damn funny,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t make em like that anymore.\u201d\n\nLater in his career, Taylor was known for playing himself in Wayne\u2019s World 2 and The Simpsons, as well as in several other movies and TV shows.\n\nHe is survived by his longtime partner, Robert Fortney.\n\n(function(d, s, id) {\n\nif (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n\nvar js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;\n\njs.src = \u201c//cdn4.wibbitz.com/static.js\u201d;\n\nd.getElementsByTagName(\u201cbody\u201d)[0].appendChild(js);\n\n}(document, \u201cscript\u201d, \u201cwibbitz-static-embed\u201d));", "description": "Oct. 6 (UPI) \u2014 Rip Taylor, the campy comedian and actor known for throwing confetti, wearing flamboyant outfits and crying for laughs, died Sunday,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
