I just wish he didn\u2019t share it on social media,\u201d Brigginshaw said on air.\n\n\u201cIf he is allowed back into it I think he doesn\u2019t need to voice his opinions there.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s an amazing player and it\u2019s disappointing that he wrote that \u2026 but I don\u2019t think he should be disadvantaged from playing.\u201d\n\nBrigginshaw is open about her relationship with Daly and the pair famously shared a kiss after the NRLW star led her side to the inaugural NRLW premiership last year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been one to hide my affection,\u201d Brigginshaw said at the time.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the person I love \u2026 I have her here and I\u2019m not going to say, \u2018I can\u2019t show you affection at the game\u2019.\n\n\u201cKate is the reason why I train hard; my family is a reason I train hard, and I go up and give them a big hug and a kiss and that doesn\u2019t mean any different to when I go up and give her a kiss.\u201d\n\nBut asked about how she uses social media, Brigginshaw admitted she was selective about what she posted.\n\n\u201cLife\u2019s different now and everyone\u2019s out there to find the negative so I\u2019m definitely very cautious about what I post,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBut then I also won\u2019t hide my life from social media just for some people. I\u2019m pretty open that I\u2019m in a same-sex relationship and I\u2019m happy and that\u2019s how it is.\n\n\u201cYou would always kiss your partner after a game. All the boys do it so I don\u2019t understand why us girls can\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nWhile the Broncos have lost just one game in the two-year history of the NRLW, Brigginshaw has tried to shift expectation for her team to the Dragons, despite being the reigning premiers and minor premiers.\n\nBrigginshaw denied any ill-feeling to the Dragons after the five players \u2014 including star hooker Brittany Brealey \u2014 all left in the off-season.\n\nBut she wanted payback on the likes of NSW captain Kezie Apps, after the Dragons skipper had also led the Blues to Origin success against her this year.\n\n\u201cI still feel that loss from NSW,\u201d Brigginshaw said.\n\n\u201cThere is a big rivalry between the Dragons and Broncos and it has that Queensland-NSW feel.\n\n\u201cKezie is the captain of NSW and I\u2019m the captain of Queensland. And I want that win more than anything.\u201d\n\n\u2014 with AAP", "description": "Brisbane Broncos NRLW skipper Ali Brigginshaw has backed Israel Folau\u2019s return to rugby league.", "authors": ["Andrew Mcmurtry"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/47f1fe125e0e42d86e45f26911d3486f?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
