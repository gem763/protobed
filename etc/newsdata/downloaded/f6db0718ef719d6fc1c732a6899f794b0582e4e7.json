Steve Webb replies", "language": "en", "text": "My partner claimed his pension in August 2017 before I met him and as he was widowed in 1995, he was able to claim an inherited pension from his late wife's contributions.\n\nWe have been talking about what would happen if he was to remarry.\n\nHe thinks the inherited part of the pension would stop but having read different articles, I get the impression he would still get what he is receiving now as he claimed his pension after 6 April 2016.\n\nCould you please give me some advice on this as to what the position would be if we were to get married?\n\nSCROLL DOWN TO FIND OUT HOW TO ASK YOUR PENSION QUESTION\n\nWedding question: Will my partner lose state pension inherited from his late wife if we get married?\n\nSteve Webb replies: The short answer to your question is that your partner's state pension would be unaffected if you were to marry now that he is over pension age.\n\nBut it is worth running through a few of the reasons why this is so, as they may be relevant to other readers.\n\nThe first thing to say is that the National Insurance system is based around marriage (and civil partnerships) but does not recognise cohabitation.\n\nThis means that simply living with someone as a couple without marrying has no effect on your state pension or their state pension.\n\nSteve Webb: Find out how to ask the former Pensions Minister a question about your retirement savings in the box below\n\nIt would though affect entitlement to means-tested benefits such as pension credit which are based on the income of the whole household.\n\nThe second point to make is that it is your marital status *at state pension age* which is the key to your rights to a pension from a spouse's contributions.\n\nMarrying after state pension age cannot take away your entitlement to a pension you were entitled to draw at pension age by dint of an earlier marriage.\n\nHowever, if someone is married at pension age and is subsequently bereaved they can, in some circumstances, inherit some extra pension from their late spouse.\n\nThis is the one case where a change in marital status after pension age can affect your pension but only in a positive way.\n\nIf you and your partner had met and married before state pension age, the answer would have been different.\n\nIn that case, his marital status at pension age would have been 'married', and his ability to claim an inherited pension based on the contributions of his late first wife would have been lost.\n\nIt is worth saying that for people reaching state pension age after 5 April 2016, the ability to 'inherit' a pension based on a late spouse's contributions is now very limited.\n\nBut one exception to this is illustrated by the example of your partner.\n\nBecause his first wife unfortunately did not reach pension age, and because he did not remarry before pension age, he has been able to inherit part of the earnings-related state pension to which she would have been entitled.\n\nIf your partner is looking for reassurance on what would happen, he can speak to the Pension Service, whose contact details can be found here.\n\nThere is also a very useful government website which answers a lot of related questions about drawing a pension based on the contributions of an ex-spouse, a late spouse or a current spouse under the old and new state pension systems. This can be found here.\n\nFinally, I would stress that my answer relates only to the state pension system.\n\nWorkplace pension schemes may have different rules about what happens to widows and widowers if they remarry post-retirement and it is vital to check with the scheme before making any big decisions.", "description": "My partner claimed his pension in 2017 before I met him and as he was widowed in 1995, he got an inherited pension from his late wife.
