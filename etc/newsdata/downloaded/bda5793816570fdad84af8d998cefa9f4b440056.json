West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude oils were both up more than 10 percent to $60.48 and $66.69, respectively as of 8:54 a.m. ET.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nSaudi Arabia, OPEC\u2019s most influential member and the world\u2019s second-largest oil producer, accounts for more than 10 percent of daily crude oil production. A prolonged production stoppage or military conflict would have a big impact on oil prices and potentially dire consequences for the global economy.\n\n\u201cA full-blown US-Iran conflict\u201d could cause oil to soar to $150 a barrel this year, according to London-based Capital Economics.\n\nCaroline Bain, the firm\u2019s chief commodities economist, says her base-case scenario is for production to be back online in the next week or so and for oil to fall back to around $60 a barrel. Her second most likely scenario is for it taking months for Saudi Arabia to fully restore production, causing oil \u201cto stay around $85 for several years owing to a higher risk premium in the price.\u201d\n\nHowever, a military conflict cannot be ruled out even after President Trump last week fired national security adviser John Bolton, who was considered to be a foreign-policy hawk.\n\n\u201cThere is reason to believe that we know the culprit, are locked and loaded depending on verification, but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack, and under what terms we would proceed!\u201d Trump tweeted Sunday evening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll signs point to the 10 drones that conducted the attacks being directed by Iran, which is backing the Houthis, an armed religious and political group, in a conflict with Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt in my mind that is the Iranians,\u201d former U.S. Army special operations and strategic adviser Brett Velicovich told \u201cMornings with Maria\u201d on Monday. \u201cThey have everything to gain from the spike in oil prices. They need oil over $100 a barrel to fuel their economy.\u201d\n\nAn oil price shock would cause CPI inflation to rise by up to 3 percentage points in the near term, according to OCED estimates, dealing a blow to a global economy that is already mired in uncertainty due to the trade war and Brexit.\n\n\u201cGrowing tensions in the Middle East are another headwind for the global economy in already uncertain times, and a full-blown conflict could trigger another leg in the global downturn.\u201d Jennifer McKeown, Head of Global Economics Service at Capital Economics\n\nAside from the U.S. tapping its Strategic Petroleum Reserve, Russia is the only country that can make up some of the lost production, according to a commodities research team at Citi. But their idle capacity is 250,000 barrels per day, just 4 percent of Saudi Arabia's lost production.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Energy is standing by if more oil is needed.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\n\u201cThe Department of @ENERGY stands ready to release oil from the SPR deemed sufficient to offset Iran\u2019s attack on the global economy and energy markets,\u201d Energy Secretary Rick Perry tweeted Monday morning. \u201cThe market is resilient and will respond positively!\u201d", "description": "Trump says the U.S. is \"locked and loaded.\"", "authors": ["Jonathan Garber"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/saudi-oil.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
