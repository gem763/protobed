When Dan was a marketing executive for an oil company in the 1970s, relocations came with the territory. After switching to the auto industry in the early 1980s, he and Alice, who was a retail manager, firmed up the family roots in Louisville, Ky. and then stayed for about 25 years, raising kids Sam and Sarah. But in 2015, as the Smiths began plotting their retirement years, the idea of following Sam and his growing family to Seattle became more appealing.\n\n\u201cThe timing was right, that area of the country was interesting to us and we wanted to be closer to Sam and [his wife] Adrienne,\u201d said Dan. \u201cThat all made it worth the effort to make a big move and gamble on trying to make a go of it in Seattle.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour kids may have very different expectations and ideas about how your lives will merge.\u201d Nancy K. Schlossberg, author of \u2018Too Young to Be Old: Love, Learn, Work and Play as You Age\u2019\n\nThe Smiths, who\u2019ve called Seattle home since 2016, aren\u2019t alone in relocating for retirement to be near one or more kids. But retirement planning experts caution that such long-distance moves aren\u2019t right for all parents and shouldn\u2019t be done on a whim.\n\nRegretting a retirement relocation decision\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen many retirees make snap decisions about where they\u2019ll live and regret it,\u201d said Jill Schlesinger, CBS business analyst and author of \u201cThe Dumb Things Smart People Do With Their Money.\u201d \u201cThey thought it would be wonderful to be closer to their kids and grandkids. What could go wrong? But this kind of a move can be dangerous for retirees, and not just because of the financial components.\u201d\n\nThere are a host of emotional factors to consider before pulling up stakes. \u201cOf course, you want to know that you can afford such a move, but of equal importance is figuring out ahead of time whether or not leaving the community you know so well is going to be right for you long term,\u201d said Schlesinger.\n\nRetirement expert Nancy K. Schlossberg, author of \u201cToo Young to Be Old: Love, Learn, Work and Play as You Age,\u201d agrees. \u201cAs with so many aspects of retirement, there are problems and possibilities regarding moving,\u201d she says, \u201cIf you do your emotional work upfront, you\u2019re more likely to be satisfied with your final decision.\u201d\n\nThat means asking yourself some key questions.\n\nGo deeper than \u2018why?\u2019\n\nThe Why? is the easy question \u2014 you want to be close to your family so you won\u2019t miss out on all the fun birthdays, graduations and smaller life celebrations, like a grandchild\u2019s first soccer goal or spelling bee. But what you really want to be thinking about are the days and weeks in between those events.\n\nThe better question to ask upfront, experts say, is: What role do I want to play in my child\u2019s life?\n\nOnce you\u2019ve answered that question for yourself, you need to articulate it to your son or daughter. Schlossberg calls this an Expectation Exchange. \u201cYour kids may have very different expectations and ideas about how your lives will merge,\u201d said Schlossberg.\n\nTo get the conversation started you might say something like: \u201cBy the way, what I\u2019m most looking forward to is helping you out more with the kids, maybe picking them up from school a few days a week. What do you think?\u201d\n\nThis is also the ideal time to broach prickly subjects, like whether you\u2019d like to be paid to watch the grandkids on a regular basis or how often you\u2019d like to see your child\u2019s family each week or month.\n\nSchlossberg warns: You want your kids to be honest with you, so your feelings might get hurt. But it\u2019s better to have these negotiations before any move because the answer may make you decide not to relocate after all.\n\nTry a test run\n\nAnother question you\u2019ll want to ask yourself: Would I really like to live in the area my child has chosen?\n\n\u201cVacationing somewhere and loving it doesn\u2019t automatically translate to moving somewhere and loving it,\u201d said Schlesinger.\n\nShe encourages people considering such a move to do a trial run for a month or more before making a decision, if possible. When doing so, pay close attention to everything from the weather and traffic to the availability of religious institutions (if that\u2019s important to you), social activities and the types of people who already live there.\n\nAlso see: 11 steps to a better retirement\n\nYour child can help you locate things like the YMCA, doctors and community centers, but it\u2019s going to be up to you to forge new friendships.\n\n\u201cReally check the place out,\u201d said Schlesinger. \u201cYou want to see if there\u2019s a community you think you can plug into.\u201d\n\nThe Smiths fell in love with Seattle in 2014 when they helped Sam and Adrienne move from Ann Arbor, Mich. Over the next year, they made the trip at least five times. And with each visit, the couple says, the desire to relocate grew stronger.\n\nOnce they made up their minds, in May 2015, the couple scheduled more trips to scope out neighborhoods and check out places to live.\n\nPlot your daily time\n\nAfter weighing the pros and cons of the new location and your expectations, the next question you\u2019ll want to answer is: How do I want to spend my time?\n\n\u201cRetirees thinking about moving need to realize that in order to be happy, they need to get a life,\u201d said Schlossberg. \u201cYou cannot depend on your adult children for your social life.\u201d\n\nStart by thinking about what will let you feel emotionally fulfilled in retirement, said Schlesinger. Decide, for instance, whether you\u2019d like to travel, pursue a hobby in earnest, volunteer or even start a second career.\n\nAs Schlossberg noted, \u201cMoving closer to kids is a big deal, but perhaps the bigger deal is filling your days once you\u2019re settled.\u201d\n\n\u201cLater on, a Certified Financial Planner can help you find ways to match your goals with your finances,\u201d Schlesinger added.\n\nDon\u2019t forget the what-ifs\n\nThe last questions to ponder aren\u2019t going to be fun, but they\u2019re a must: What if I have a health scare? And what if my child needs to relocate after I\u2019ve moved?\n\n\u201cSo many families run into trouble when something bad unexpectedly happens. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to talk to your kids about the What-Ifs,\u201d said Schlesinger.\n\nRegarding a potential health scare, at the very least you\u2019ll want to know about the doctors and health system in the new community. But it\u2019s also a good idea to look into the types of services offered to older residents, including transportation to health facilities.\n\nAnd if you\u2019d be leaving behind a host of friends and neighbors you could rely on in a pinch, you\u2019ll also need to explore various possible caregiving scenarios in your new location.\n\nRead: \u2018It is an act of insanity to stay in the U.S.\u2019: Why this 63-year-old teacher ditched Massachusetts to retire in the highlands of Panama\n\nThe What-If about your child deciding to move again is important to consider because today\u2019s economy frequently prompts job changes.\n\nSchlesinger recalls working with a retired couple who moved from the Pittsburgh area to be near their grown child in suburban Atlanta. After they did, the child relocated to Savannah for work. \u201cIt was such a bummer for [the couple],\u201d Schlesinger said. \u201cThey felt stranded.\u201d Ultimately, the pair decided to make another move \u2014 to Savannah.\n\nMoney matters to weigh before moving near your child\n\nSchlesinger said retirees considering moving closer to their adult child should also follow this financial checklist before relocating:\n\nDo a cost-of-living comparison. Your child can give you a sense of local prices for things like gasoline, utilities, internet service and other miscellaneous expenses. But you\u2019ll also want to look into things like local real-estate prices and rents (websites like Zillow.com can help), car insurance rates (start with your current insurer and check with a few competitors) and health care expenses (begin by asking your current insurer how your coverage and costs might change or visit sites like Leapfroggroup.org to research local hospital data.)\n\nFree online cost-of-living calculators, like the calculator from CNNMoney, can give you a quick side-by-side comparison of two cities using your current income.\n\nExplore differences in state and local taxes. They might vary widely from what you currently pay. You\u2019ll not only want to look into sales, property, estate and state income taxes, but also whether you\u2019d be taxed by the new state on your retirement income and benefits. The state\u2019s revenue office can answer your tax questions and a trusted tax pro can help you run the numbers. Also, the IRS site has useful tax information for retirees.\n\nFind out about local resources for retirees. Some communities, for example, offer low-cost or free public transportation to people over a certain age. A good place to start your research is by checking the state\u2019s department of aging site. It will likely have information about regional Area Agencies on Aging as well as local community centers. Your child\u2019s social network may also have helpful information for you.\n\nMeet with a Certified Financial Planner.
