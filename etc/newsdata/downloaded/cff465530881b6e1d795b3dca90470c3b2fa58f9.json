This isn\u2019t to say that nothing happened during the October 2018 term. It is just that it would be tough to top the high drama and significance of the travel-ban opinion \u2014 issued the second-to-last day of the October 2017 term and the day before Kennedy announced his retirement \u2014 and the upcoming DACA case. The court will consider the latter next term and issue its decision shortly before the next presidential election \u2013 a time when both immigration and the court will, no doubt, weigh heavily on voters\u2019 minds.\n\nIn the travel-ban case, Trump v. Hawaii, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the 5-4 majority opinion upholding President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order suspending the admission of individuals from seven countries (most of which were majority Muslim). The majority rejected arguments that Trump had exceeded his authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act and that he had violated the establishment clause because his order was motivated by anti-Muslim bias, not national-security concerns.\n\nIn his swan song, Kennedy joined the chief\u2019s opinion \u201cin full.\u201d In a short concurrence, he stressed the \u201cnecessity that officials adhere to [First Amendment] guarantees and mandates in all their actions.\u201d\n\nIn the DACA case, Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of the University of California (and two other consolidated cases), the Supreme Court will consider whether the Trump administration\u2019s decision to end President Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program \u2014 which enabled 800,000 immigrants brought to this country illegally as minors to remain and work here \u2014 is lawful or even judicially reviewable. Thus far, lower federal courts have frustrated the administration\u2019s attempts to end DACA. In one case, employing heated language reminiscent of language used by lower courts considering the travel ban, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit charged the administration with acting out of a \u201cdiscriminatory motivation, including the rescission order\u2019s disparate impact on Latinos and persons of Mexican heritage.\u201d\n\nWhile no case this term matched the significance of last term\u2019s travel ban case or next term\u2019s DACA case, the docket offered a few important cases affecting immigrants.\n\nIn Nielsen v. Preap, the court, by a 5-4 vote in an opinion by Justice Samuel Alito, held that a mandatory-detention statute applied to deportable aliens convicted of state crimes even though immigration authorities did not arrest them until years after they were released from state custody. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226(a) allows the Department of Homeland Security to arrest and hold a deportable alien pending a removal decision. While DHS generally has discretion to release aliens pending removal, Section 1226(c)(1) lists certain categories of aliens convicted of specific crimes and directs DHS to arrest those who fall into these categories \u201cwhen the alien is released\u201d from custody and to detain them pending removal. The challengers fit within those parameters, but argued they were entitled to a bond hearing because they were not detained immediately after their release from state custody. After engaging in a lengthy grammatical analysis, the court concluded that the \u201cwhen \u2026 released\u201d language merely clarified when the duty to arrest was triggered and to exhort DHS to act promptly, not to bar detention if the arrest occurred later.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas, joined by Justice Neil Gorsuch, concurred separately, contending that three separate immigration provisions limit judicial review of such cases and that it is unlikely the district court had jurisdiction to certify the classes of aliens. Justice Stephen Breyer dissented, joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, claiming that the statute\u2019s prohibition on bail hearings does not apply to aliens whom DHS detained years after their release from prison.\n\nIn Rehaif v. United States, the court resolved an issue of keen interest to a limited niche of immigrants. Hamid Rehaif entered the U.S. on a nonimmigrant student visa, which was terminated after he was dismissed from his university. He subsequently visited a shooting range where he rented and shot firearms. Rehaif was convicted of being an alien unlawfully in the U.S. in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7922(g) and \u00a7924(a)(2). In a 7-2 opinion by Breyer, the court held that the trial judge erred when he instructed the jury that the government was not required to prove that Rehaif knew he was unlawfully in the country at the time he possessed the firearm. The court invoked its longstanding presumption that Congress intends to require a defendant to possess a culpable mental state regarding \u201ceach of the statutory elements that criminalize otherwise innocent conduct\u201d and added that the statutory text further supports that presumption, as the term \u201cknowingly\u201d is normally read \u201cas applying to all the subsequently listed elements of the crime.\u201d The majority rejected the government\u2019s appeal to the maxim \u201cignorance of the law is no excuse,\u201d noting that the maxim does not normally apply where a defendant\u2019s mistaken impression causes him to misunderstand his conduct\u2019s significance, thereby negating an element of the crime.\n\nIn a dissent joined by Thomas, Justice Samuel Alito argued that \u201cthe majority\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 922(g) is not required by the statutory text, and there is no reason to suppose it represents what Congress intended.\u201d The court\u2019s decision, he added, \u201ccasually overturns the long-established interpretation of an important criminal statute,\u201d and the court\u2019s reinterpretation will make it significantly harder to convict persons falling into some of these categories and will likely open the floodgates of litigation, creating a substantial burden on lower courts.\n\nAnd finally, on the last day of the term, the Supreme Court issued its opinion in Department of Commerce v. New York, a blockbuster case that did not involve immigration per se, but was followed intently by many advocacy organizations representing immigrants.\n\nThe case involved whether the Commerce Department could reinstate a citizenship question on the census, and it arrived at the Supreme Court in an unusual way. After two federal district court judges held that the department could not include the question, the solicitor general asked the court to consider the case without the benefit of appellate review, claiming that for the Commerce Department to proceed, it was necessary to resolve the issue by June 30. The court acquiesced.\n\nThe Constitution, in Article I, Section 2, Clause 3, calls for an \u201cEnumeration\u201d of the population every 10 years \u201cin such Manner\u201d as Congress \u201cshall by Law Direct.\u201d By statute, Congress has authorized the Commerce Department to carry out the decennial census, and the Commerce secretary (currently Wilbur Ross) is aided by the Census Bureau, an agency within the department.\n\nBetween 1820 and 2000 (except 1840), a citizenship question was included on some form of the census. Between 1820 and 1950, it was asked of every household, and between 1960 and 2000, it was asked on a sampling census form that goes to somewhere between a quarter and a sixth of households. In 2010, the question was moved to the American Community Survey, which is sent to 2.6 percent of households. Other countries, including France, the U.K., Spain, Mexico and Germany, also ask a citizenship question on their equivalent of the census, and the United Nations recommends that other countries do so.\n\nGetting an accurate count is important because it is used to determine how many congressmembers will represent each state, and many federal programs dispense benefits to states based on their population. Getting accurate data about the number of citizens in each state is important too. Many federal programs, for instance, provide benefits only to citizens and limited categories of qualified immigrants. Another reason to get an accurate count, and the one cited by Ross, is to help the Department of Justice enforce the Voting Rights Act by providing information needed in cases involving challenges to majority-minority districts. After considering various options, Ross decided to add a citizenship question back into the census.\n\nEven though answers to census questions are confidential and people who identify themselves as noncitizens aren\u2019t asked whether they are here illegally, Ross\u2019 decision was challenged by several groups claiming that including a citizenship question on the census would result in an undercount because many people wouldn\u2019t complete the questionnaire. The main arguments advanced by the challengers were that including a citizenship question would violate the enumeration clause (because it would result in an undercount, not an accurate enumeration), that the secretary\u2019s decision to reinstate the question rather than choosing one of the other options was arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act, and finally that Ross\u2019 proffered reason for reinstating the question was pretextual, thereby precluding meaningful judicial review of the real reason or reasons for his decision.\n\nA highly fractured Supreme Court blocked the Commerce Department from reinstating the citizenship question on the 2020 census. As with the two Obamacare decisions, Roberts, who wrote the majority opinion, proved to be the common denominator.\n\nIn the only part of the opinion joined by all the justices, the Supreme Court held that it had jurisdiction to consider the case, and in the part joined by all the justices save Alito and Gorsuch, the court held that the secretary\u2019s decision was reviewable under the APA.\n\nRoberts, joined by Alito, Thomas, Gorsuch and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, rejected most of the challengers\u2019 arguments, holding that it would not violate the enumeration clause to include a citizenship question on the census and that the secretary\u2019s decision to reinstate the citizenship question rather than choosing one of the other options was not arbitrary and capricious.\n\nHowever, and here was the kicker, the chief, joined by Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor and Kagan, held that the secretary\u2019s proffered reasons for reinstating the citizenship question were \u201cincongruent with what the record reveals about the agency\u2019s priorities and decision making.\u201d While the Commerce Department claimed it needed to reinstate the citizenship question to better enforce the Voting Rights Act, the record, Roberts stated, revealed \u201cno hint that [the secretary] was considering VRA enforcement\u201d when, a mere week into his tenure, he began taking steps to reinstate the citizenship question. \u201cAltogether,\u201d the court explained, \u201cthe evidence tells a story that does not match the explanation the Secretary gave for his decision.\u201d Accordingly, the court blocked Ross from including the citizenship question pending a remand to the Department of Commerce to give it another try, time permitting.\n\nThomas, joined by Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, dissented in part, arguing that the Supreme Court should have ended its inquiry after concluding that the Commerce secretary\u2019s decision was constitutional and lawful. He argued that in doubting the secretary\u2019s motives, the court ignored the \u201cpresumption of regularity\u201d that courts owe agencies. In short, Thomas argued, the opinion \u201creflects an unprecedented departure from our deferential review of discretionary agency decisions\u201d and \u201cif taken seriously \u2026 would transform administrative law.\u201d\n\nBreyer, joined by Ginsburg, Sotomayor and Kagan, dissented in part, contending that the secretary\u2019s decision violated the APA. Including the citizenship question, Breyer stated, \u201ccreated a severe risk of harmful consequences\u201d because it \u201cwould likely cause a disproportionate number of noncitizens and Hispanics to go uncounted in the upcoming census.\u201d The secretary, Breyer believed, failed to consider this important aspect of the problem or articulate a satisfactory explanation for it.\n\nAlito dissented in part, arguing that the Supreme Court had no authority to review the secretary\u2019s decision under the APA. Whether to include a citizenship question on the census, he stated, \u201cis committed by law to the discretion of the Secretary of Commerce and is therefore exempt from APA review.\u201d\n\nAlthough the challengers in this case got a \u201cwin,\u201d it was not a resounding one. The Supreme Court made clear that, if adequately supported, a citizenship question may reappear on the census in the future, but it appears that the clock has run out on the administration\u2019s efforts to return the question to the 2020 census, although the president has vowed to utilize existing federal databases to obtain that information in other ways.", "description": "In the year after Justice Anthony Kennedy\u2019s retirement, immigration issues remained in a state of relative quiescence at the Supreme Court.
