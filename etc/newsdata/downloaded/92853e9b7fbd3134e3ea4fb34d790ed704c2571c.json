Left unsaid: That was three days after the alleged attack.\n\nAdditionally, they accused Mueller\u2019s team of \u201cleaking\u201d a Washington Post story that undermined their tale. The report showed Mueller was in Washington on Aug. 2 serving a jury duty summons.\n\nDespite their claim of an exhaustive investigation of the allegations, Wohl and Burkman failed to spell the accuser\u2019s name correctly.\n\nCass\u2019 first name is misspelled as \u201cCarolyn,\u201d without an \u201ce\u201d in the affidavit, and Burkman insisted that her name was spelled without an \u201ce\u201d when asked by reporters. Only after repeated pressing did Burkman concede that her name is actually \u201cCarolyne.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven the Declaration of Independence had misspellings,\u201d Burkman quipped.\n\nBurkman claims to represent Cass, and he said she hasn\u2019t reported her allegations to New York police.\n\nOther allegations the duo had made earlier fell apart as well. Burkman had previously claimed that he had seven women willing to accuse Mueller. Wohl eventually conceded that they did not have seven women with accusations against Mueller.\n\nAllegations that accusers were being paid have swirled around the effort. In October, a number of media outlets, including The Daily Beast, received an email from a \u201cLorraine Parsons\u201d who said Burkman\u2019s associates were offering her tens of thousands of dollars to accuse Mueller. And on Tuesday, Vermont Law School professor Jen Taub also told The Atlantic that she\u2019d been offered money to accuse Mueller.\n\nWohl and Burkman were reluctant to explain how Wohl, who claimed he first worked with Cass on an unrelated estate issue, was first in contact with their accuser. They also failed to explain where Mueller\u2019s FBI security detail was when he was supposedly assaulting a woman.\n\nAnd Wohl was cryptic about other details, too\u2014he repeatedly declined to say whether he has a private investigator license. Eventually, Wohl said he sometimes works with licensed private investigators. Wohl\u2019s name isn\u2019t in a database of licensed private investigators maintained by the state of California, where he lives.\n\nThe two men even declined to say how they knew each other.\n\nBurkman said only that their meeting was \u201csynergistic.\u201d\n\nWohl, who is better known as a pro-Trump partisan on Twitter than any sort of sleuth, initially tried to hide his role in the effort. Wohl insisted earlier this week that he wasn\u2019t the head of \u201cSurefire Intelligence,\u201d the previously little known investigations firm that compiled Cass\u2019 allegations.\n\nSurefire at first claimed to be a group of ex-intelligence agents from Eastern Europe and the Middle East. But Wohl was forced to concede otherwise after a number of digital footprints, including clues on Surefire\u2019s website and a company phone number that linked to Wohl\u2019s mother, proved he was behind it.\n\nA number of LinkedIn accounts for the firm\u2019s \u201cstaff\u201d were also revealed as stolen headshots from models and Hollywood celebrities. But Wohl, who insisted he wasn\u2019t behind the fake LinkedIn pages, said he had to lie about the firm for investigative purposes.\n\n\u201cIt was important that I preserved my anonymity,\u201d Wohl said.\n\nThe allegations from Wohl and Burkman have struggled to gain traction even in the right-wing media. The Gateway Pundit, a pro-Trump site that Wohl writes for and which frequently runs hoaxes as actual news, initially published Cass\u2019 affidavit.\n\nBut it has since backtracked, pulling down the document and stressing that the post was Wohl\u2019s responsibility alone. A reporter from Gateway Pundit asked Wohl tough questions at the press conference, suggesting that even his sometime -employer isn\u2019t convinced of his claims. After the press conference, Gateway Pundit founder Jim Hoft published a post saying the site had \u201csuspended our relationship\u201d with Wohl.\n\nThe event was reminiscent of other failed Burkman press conferences, including several he\u2019s held on the Seth Rich conspiracy theory. Burkman attached himself to the investigation of the former Democratic National Committee staffer\u2019s murder in 2016 but has frequently failed to make good on his claims. Burkman\u2019s previous flops included a botched press conference in which he promised and failed to deliver a deep-state representative who would say Rich was killed by government hit men.\n\nAt times, the event resembled a real-life version of the Twitter fights Wohl often engages in. Wohl complained that someone online had photoshopped a picture of him turning into a corncob\u2014a reference to a popular tweet about someone doubling down in the face of internet embarrassment.\n\nBurkman defended Wohl, 20, from charges that he doesn\u2019t have enough experience to investigate such a serious charge against Mueller.\n\n\u201cI think Jacob is a child prodigy who has eclipsed Mozart,\u201d Burkman said.\n\nA heckler cut in, yelling that Wohl couldn\u2019t even open an eTrade account\u2014a reference to Wohl\u2019s lifetime ban from futures trading, a penalty he earned in a previous career as a teenage hedge fund operator.\n\nIn the face of unanswered questions from the press, Burkman and Wohl headed to their car followed by reporters. But Burkman promised more details to come at an unspecified future press conference.", "description": "Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman struggled to explain even basic details of their allegations\u2014like the spelling of the accuser\u2019s name.", "authors": ["Will Sommer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1541099681/181101-sommer-muller-accuser-presser-tease_vffx5n"}
