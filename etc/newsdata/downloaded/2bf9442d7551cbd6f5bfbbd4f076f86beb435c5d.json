Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) has been under fire for years for her crusading against American involvement against Bashar al-Assad in the Syrian civil war, ongoing since 2011, and has faced particular criticism for her 2017 visit to Damascus where she met Assad personally.\n\nGabbard has repeatedly referred to Assad respectfully as \u201cpresident\u201d \u2014 while referring to American President Donald Trump as \u201cSaudi Arabia\u2019s bitch\u201d \u2014 and only began referring to Assad publicly as a dictator after she began her presidential run.\n\n\u201cThe New York Times and CNN have also smeared veterans like myself for calling for an end to this regime change war,\u201d Gabbard said, replying to a question regarding President Trump\u2019s decision to relocate troops out of Syrian Kurdistan last week. \u201cJust two days ago, the New York Times put out an article saying that I am a Russian asset and an Assad apologist, all these different smears \u2026 completely despicable.\u201d\n\nGabbard promised to \u201cend this regime change war\u201d and end \u201cdraconian\u201d sanctions implemented by President Trump.\n\nGabbard has long been a proponent of drawing down America\u2019s military role in the Middle East, touting her personal experience as a veteran. The \u201csmear\u201d that she is an \u201cAssad apologist\u201d is the product of her decision to meet Assad personally in 2017 during a visit that she did not tell Democratic peers in Congress about before it happened. The Pentagon did confirm they were aware of her visit.\n\n\u201cWhatever you think about President Assad, the fact is that he is the president of Syria. In order for any peace agreement, in order for any possibility of a viable peace agreement to occur, there has to be a conversation with him,\u201d she told CNN shortly after her return from meeting with Assad.\n\nAt the time that Gabbard visited Assad, he claimed legitimacy to the presidency following the staging of an election in 2014, which he won with nearly 90 percent of the vote. Due to the then-three-year-old civil war, anti-Assad strongholds were excluded from the voting and there was little accountability in vote counting; most of the free world dismissed the \u201celection\u201d as a sham.\n\nGabbard explained in a statement following her visit that she had \u201cno intention of meeting with Assad\u201d but \u201cfelt it was important to take it\u201d when Assad invited her to meet in person.\n\nShe returned from her trip accusing the Syrian rebels that America supported in the war of being \u201cterrorists,\u201d many of whom are the same Syrian Kurdish Peoples\u2019 Protection Units (YPG) that she criticized Trump for withdrawing support from.\n\nAs recently as this March, when asked if Assad \u2014 who has repeatedly used chemical weapons against civilians in violation of international law, according to significant evidence compiled by NGOs and neutral states \u2014 was a war criminal, Gabbard refused to say yes or no.\n\n\u201cI think the evidence needs to be gathered,\u201d Gabbard said. \u201cAnd as I have said before \u2014 if there is evidence that he has committed war crimes, he should be prosecuted as such.\u201d\n\nAfter years of pressure over her favorable comments about Assad \u2014 and now facing renewed criticism in light of her presidential campaign \u2014 Gabbard called Assad a \u201cbrutal dictator\u201d in August. Assad is still in power as of the election that Gabbard used to justify referring to him as the legal head of state of the country in 2017, and no constitutional changes have occurred in Syria to make Assad more or less legitimate than when Gabbard met with him.", "description": "Rep.
