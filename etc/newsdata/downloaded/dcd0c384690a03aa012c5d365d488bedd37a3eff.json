But Zuckerberg sidestepped an attempt to pin him down on promising a moratorium on plans for Libra.\n\nThe Republican representative Ann Wagner of Missouri asked Zuckerberg why several high-profile corporations had recently departed the Libra project. Zuckerberg, momentarily at a loss for words, conceded: \u201cIt\u2019s a risky enterprise.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic congresswoman Maxine Waters quizzed Zuckerberg on a range of issues, including Facebook\u2019s lack of corporate diversity, its limited steps so far to combat misinformation in advertising on its network and the dangers of that leading to voter suppression before the 2020 presidential election.\n\nShe also challenged him on discrimination by advertisers via algorithms used in online ads, which has drawn legal action against the company.\n\n\u201cAll of these problems I\u2019ve outlined, and given the scope and the size and reach [Facebook has], it should be clear: while we have serious concerns about your plans to establish a global digital currency that will challenge the US dollar \u2026 we have also opened up a serious discussion about whether Facebook should be broken up,\u201d she said.\n\nIn his opening statement, Zuckerberg said that if the US did not allow the launch of a cryptocurrency, China would beat it to the field.\n\n\u201cChina is moving quickly to launch similar ideas in the coming months. Libra is going to be backed mostly by dollars, and I believe that it will extend America\u2019s financial leadership around the world, as well as our democratic values and oversight. But if America doesn\u2019t innovate, our financial leadership is not guaranteed,\u201d he said.\n\nTop US officials including the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, and the Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome Powell, have criticized Libra, warning it could be used for illicit activity such as money laundering or drug trafficking.\n\nThe Democratic congressman Brad Sherman of California criticized Zuckerberg\u2019s claims that Libra will help poor and unbanked people around the world enter the financial system.\n\n\u201cThe poor and unbanked need pesos, they need dollars that they can buy something at a local store,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve done no effort to help the unbanked anywhere else and any other time.\u201d\n\nHe said an anonymous currency was more likely to help drug dealers and other people seeking to circumvent traditional financial systems more than the poor and unbanked.\n\nFacebook isn't going to influence the next election \u2013 until it does | Alex Hern Read more\n\n\u201cFor the richest man in the world to come here and hide behind the poorest people in the world, and say that\u2019s who you\u2019re really trying to help,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to help those for whom the dollar is not a good currency \u2013 drug dealers and tax evaders.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Facebook disclosed it had removed a network of Russian accounts targeting US voters on Instagram, which it owns.\n\n\u201cIt would be beneficial for all if Facebook concentrates on addressing its many existing deficiencies and failures before proceeding any further on the Libra project,\u201d Waters said.\n\nLibra has faltered in recent weeks amid sustained criticism from lawmakers and regulators over fears it may aid money laundering and upend the global financial system.\n\nSeveral financial partners, including Mastercard, Visa, PayPal and eBay, have abandoned the project.\n\nZuckerberg last appeared before Congress in April 2018 amid fierce questioning on political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica\u2019s misuse of Facebook customer data to interfere in the US 2016 presidential election.\n\nThat scandal damaged Facebook\u2019s image in Washington and has compounded worries among lawmakers that the social media giant cannot be trusted to launch a global digital currency to its 2.4bn users.\n\nZuckerberg acknowledged Facebook\u2019s mistakes.\n\nHe conceded: \u201cI get that I\u2019m not the ideal messenger for this right now. We\u2019ve faced a lot of issues over the past few years and I\u2019m sure there are a lot of people who wish it were anyone but Facebook that was helping to propose this,\u201d he said.", "description": "US legislators condemn CEO\u2019s currency plans and question whether Facebook should be broken up", "authors": ["Kari Paul", "Barry Eichengreen"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/656f45597e0813ad4624bb9c503f1d55e3e85cd8/0_0_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=784c1cdf4b118fc27d54e7beeed76049", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
