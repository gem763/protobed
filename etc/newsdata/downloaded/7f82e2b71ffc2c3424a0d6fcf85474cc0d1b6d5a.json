Republicans\u2019 trust is still at a very low level and a wide gap in views of the media among partisans persists as 69% of Democrats say they have trust and confidence in it, while 15% of Republicans and 36% of independents agree.", "description": "", "authors": ["News.Gallup.Com Poll Americans-Trust-Mass-Media-Edges-Down.Aspx"], "top_image": ""}
