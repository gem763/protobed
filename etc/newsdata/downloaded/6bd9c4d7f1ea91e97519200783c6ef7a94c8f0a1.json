You can now ask Google Assistant for that by saying, \u201cHey Google, move the music to the living room.\u201d\n\nAt least, you can if you have a house filled with Google Home smart speakers, Google Nest Hub displays, and / or Chromecast dongles. Google just upgraded its multiroom audio offering with a feature it\u2019s calling Stream Transfer. Previously, you could add music you were already playing to additional speakers in your home to play simultaneously, but why leave it playing in a room you aren\u2019t in anymore?\n\nI just tried the feature, and it\u2019s as simple as it sounds: start playing music on one Google Cast device, then ask Google Assistant to transfer it to another device (or speaker group) in your house.\n\nYou can say the name of a specific room if you\u2019ve assigned it to one; otherwise, you\u2019ll need to say the name of the device to which you\u2019re transferring music.\n\nAccording to Google\u2019s new blog post, you can also use the Google Home app on your phone to sling music from device to device if you\u2019d rather not say anything out loud, and you can beam videos back and forth between a Chromecast and a Nest Hub smart display, too. I wasn\u2019t able to find the controls in the app, probably because I haven\u2019t gotten an update for my Google Home app this month.\n\nUnfortunately, it doesn\u2019t look like you can move music from a Google Cast device back to your phone. It\u2019d be nice to seamlessly transfer my tunes when I walk out the door.", "description": "Want music to follow you around your house?
