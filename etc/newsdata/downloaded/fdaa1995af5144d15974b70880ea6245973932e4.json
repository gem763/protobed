One suspect was in custody, and two others are being sought on capital murder charges in the death of Joshua Brown.\n\nPolice said Brown was killed in a drug deal gone bad, and they emphasized his death was not related to his testimony in the Guyger case.\n\nBrown was a key prosecution witness in the trial of Guyger, who was convicted last week in the 2018 killing of her neighbor, Botham Jean. Brown lived across the hall from Jean and testified that he heard two people \"meeting by surprise,\" followed by two shots, the night Jean died.\n\nBrown, 28, was shot to death at a separate apartment complex on Friday, just 10 days after taking the stand.\n\nIn this Sept. 24, 2019, photo, Joshua Brown, left, answers questions from Assistant District Attorney LaQuita Long, right, while pointing to a map of the South Side Flats where he lives, while testifying during the murder trial of former Dallas Police Officer Amber Guyger. AP\n\nDallas Police Assistant Chief Avery Moore said the three suspects had traveled from Louisiana to buy drugs from Brown, and one of the men shot Brown twice and killed him.\n\nOne of the suspects, 20-year-old Jacquerious Mitchell, was wounded and treated at a hospital. He's expected to be charged with capital murder. Police are still searching for Thaddeous Charles Green, 22, and Michael Diaz Mitchell, 32, who they believe fled the state.\n\nThrough the dedicated work of the DPD homicide detectives, we have identified 3 suspects in the murder of Joshua Brown.

Mitchell said Green and Brown were talking when the conversation escalated into a physical confrontation. During the dispute, Brown shot Jacquerious Mitchell and Green shot Brown, killing him, according to Jacquerious Mitchell's account. Mitchell said he was driven to a hospital before the other two suspects fled.\n\nDallas Police said \"numerous tips\" led them to search Brown's apartment, where they confiscated 12 pounds of marijuana, 149 grams of THC cartridges and more than $4,000 in cash.\n\nBrown was concerned for his safety and didn't want to testify in the Guyger trial because he believed he had been targeted in a previous November 2018 shooting, according to his family lawyer, Lee Merritt. The shooting at a Dallas strip club last year left Brown wounded and killed Nicholas Shaquan Diggs, reports CBS Dallas-Fort Worth.\n\nBrown was also expected to testify in an upcoming trial in Diggs' death, the station reports.\n\nMerritt told CBS Dallas-Fort Worth that the day Brown testified, someone posted on one of Brown's social media accounts, \"Now we know where to find you.\" The post was later deleted.\n\nMerritt and others have called for an outside agency to investigate Brown's death. Dallas Police did not immediately respond to a request for a response from CBS News.", "description": "Joshua Brown, who lived near Botham Jean, testified in the trial of ex-Dallas officer Amber Guyger", "authors": ["Erin Donaghue", "Erin Donaghue Reports", "Writes For Cbsnews.Com On Topics Including Criminal Justice", "Social Justice", "Culture.
