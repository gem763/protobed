Once you factor in all the costs involved, the renovation project often turned out no cheaper than just buying a home in move-in condition.\n\n\u201cEven though the majority of fixer-upper homeowners thought they could save money, they actually spent about the same or more than their move-in ready counterparts,\u201d reported Porch.com, a home improvement website, which sponsored the survey.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: What Chip and Joanna Gaines can teach you about saving for retirement\n\nInterestingly, the findings seemingly go against the interests of the survey\u2019s sponsor. Porch.com makes money connecting homeowners with contractors. The company has an incentive to encourage us all to do as much fixing-up as we can. Porch.com could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nTheir survey of 1,069 U.S. homeowners found that those who had bought a home that was move-in ready spent an average of $250,000.\n\nThose who bought a \u201cfixer upper\u201d spent an average of about $50,000 less. But then they typically spent that amount, or more, on the renovations, the survey found.\n\nOK, so it may not be apples to apples. Buying your own home and renovating it gives you a greater chance to tailor it to your own dreams and needs. But the costs were comparable nonetheless. And those who just bought a home that was ready saved themselves a lot of extra pain.\n\nThe biggest problem with fixer uppers? The danger of running over budget.\n\nMore than two-fifths of those who bought fixer uppers ended up blowing way past their budget. On average they ended up spending about $76,000 on renovations, or 60% more than those who were able to stick to the allotted amount.\n\nRecommended: Should you buy a fixer for your first home? Follow these pointers\n\nAmong those who bust the budget, there was no common culprit either. For some it was the costs of repairing the roof. For others it was the costs of fixing the basement. New kitchens were about as likely to cause pain as new bathrooms. Ditto new flooring and new driveways, replacing the plumbing and replacing the electricals. Installing new heating, ventilation and air conditioning proved the most likely project to turn your wallet inside out, but not by a wide margin. You never know what\u2019s going to turn your dream home into a \u201cmoney pit\u201d until it does.\n\nAbout two-fifths of those who bust their budget said they wouldn\u2019t buy their current home again.\n\nProfessional house restorers Chip and Joanna Gaines have become a cultural phenomenon thanks to their program, \u201cFixer Upper,\u201d filmed in their hometown of Waco, Texas. The couple, who have five children, renovate old houses on behalf of home buyers moving to the city.\n\nRegular fans of the program notice the pair always manage to bring the project home for the amount allotted, even when the projects are hit by sudden, unexpected problems. But the most recent survey suggest that\u2019s what it\u2019s like when you\u2019re a professional \u2014 and on TV.\n\nSee also: Consider buying a fixer-upper home using a renovation loan", "description": "The findings of a new survey appear to go against the interests of the company that paid for it.", "authors": ["Brett Arends"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HP919_arends_ZG_20190821231425.jpg"}
