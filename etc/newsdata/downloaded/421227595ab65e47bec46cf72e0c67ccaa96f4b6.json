Take a break from the digital devices and replace it with a beautiful story to fill your mind.\n\nSomeone once said that reading is like a journey \u2014 you dive into a good story and you let your imagination go wild until nothing can stop you from feeling motivated, light-hearted, and absolutely liberated. Yes, we have Amazon and e-books, and though not much can beat the comfort of having our favorite novels delivered straight home after a single click, sometimes it\u2019s really all about hunting for inspiration on the shelves of old-school bookstores.\n\nLuckily, Tokyo has a good few of those, offering paperbacks in several foreign languages \u2014 from fiction to art and photography, biographies and children\u2019s books. Here are Savvy Tokyo\u2019s top recommended bookstores in the capital to find rare literary gems written in English, French, German and more.\n\nWith one million tomes across nine floors, the Yaesu Book Center is the biggest bookstore in the Yaesu area and one of the largest in the whole of Tokyo. On the 7th floor, you can find a massive foreign-language section with everything from bestsellers to books about Japan, social science, as well as magazines in English, French, and German.

You can find extremely rare periodicals, art and culture books, and magazines; you can also browse through a number of stationary and crafts shops inside the several complexes \u2014 and if you\u2019re tired, you can also have a cup of coffee at the very elegant cafe Anjin, located on the second floor of the bookstore. Allow yourself at least half a day when you go there \u2014 unless books scare you, you won\u2019t be able to leave early.\n\nWhere: Daikanyama T-Site, 17-5, Sarugaku-cho, Shibuya-ku, Tokyo\n\nBusiness hours: 7 a.m.-2 a.m.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Demi (@sssyuuu) on Oct 2, 2019 at 7:31am PDT\n\nCow Books sells rare, out-of-print and first editions on topics including social movements, progressive politics, protests, the Beat generation, and other themes focusing on the 1960\u2019s and 70\u2019s in English.
