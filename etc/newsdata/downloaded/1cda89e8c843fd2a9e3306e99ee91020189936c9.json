Hopefully, I'll have another opportunity.\u201d\n\nHeading into Game 2 against the Nationals, Verlander had a 5.67 ERA in five starts with 30 strikeouts in 27 innings. He\u2019s appeared in four World Series during his career \u2013 twice with the Astros, in 2017 (0-1) and 2019 (0-1), and twice with the Detroit Tigers, in 2006 (0-2) and 2012 (0-1).\n\nSIMONE BILES ADDS FLIP AND TWIST TO HER FIRST PITCH AT GAME 2 OF WORLD SERIES\n\nAgainst the Nationals on Tuesday, he surrendered four earned runs on seven hits in six innings. He allowed a key solo home run to Kurt Suzuki in the seventh which broke a 2-2 tie and jumpstarted a six-run inning en route to the Nationals' 12-3 victory.\n\n\u201cIn the regular season, you're like, 'OK, here it is, hit it, right down the middle.' In the World Series, it's a different story,\u201d Verlander said. \u201cYou can't really ever do that. You still got to hit your spots.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nAccording to the Elias Sports Bureau, Verlander has allowed nine first-inning runs. The most for any pitcher in one postseason. He allowed two to the Nationals on Wednesday and four to the New York Yankees in Game 5 of the ALCS, which he also lost.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Justin Verlander has not been at his best when pitching in the World Series during his career and it showed again Wednesday night in a Game 2 loss to the Washington Nationals.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is A Sports Reporter For Foxnews.Com", "Foxbusiness.Com.
