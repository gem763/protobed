Thousands of students skipped school to raise awareness about the climate crisis. (Submitted by Emma Lim)\n\nOn Monday, she was in Ottawa to launch this most recent campaign.\n\n\u201cIt was a combination of things,\u201d she said when asked what led her to this decision. \u201cLosing faith in my elected officials, in talking to my friends and realizing we all felt the same way about the future.\u201d\n\nEmma admitted the pledge doesn\u2019t affect her life right now, as she\u2019s not ready to have kids, but she said she always planned to be a mother.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t put my children in danger,\u201d she said.\n\nBoys taking the pledge, too\n\nJoshua Kearny, 18, of Whitehorse, also took the pledge.\n\nHe said his dream is to one day have three kids.\n\n\u201cRight now, there\u2019s no way I could even fathom introducing three kids into the world,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it keeps going the way it is, my kids won\u2019t be living in a healthy world.\u201d\n\nJoshua Kearny said asthma runs in his family and he\u2019s worried that if he were to have kids, they could have asthma, too. (Submitted by Joshua Kearny)\n\nLiving in the North, he said he has seen the effects of climate change, like warmer winters.\n\n\u201cIt was making me nervous,\u201d he said. \u201cI have asthma and asthma runs in my family... I can\u2019t imagine a future where we\u2019re struggling to breathe.\"\n\nHe worries that the air quality will be so poor in the future that \u201cmy kids won\u2019t be able to go out and play.\u201d\n\nHe said he hopes more guys will take the pledge as well.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just have half of our generation, just the women, taking a stand,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need all of us as a whole to combine our forces to actually make our message heard.\u201d\n\nEmma is hoping the message will get across to the Canadian politicians who are in the midst of a federal election campaign.\n\nWhat the politicians say\n\nCBC Kids News asked the four main political parties (Liberal, Conservative, NDP and Green) for their views on the pledge.\n\nWhile they all make promises to tackle climate change in different ways, only two parties addressed the pledge directly in their response to CBC Kids News.\n\nDuring a campaign stop on Monday, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer was asked the question by the media.\n\nHe said, \u201cObviously as someone with five children, I believe children are a great blessing, and they are the future of our country and the future of our society.\u201d\n\nAndrew Scheer, the leader of the Conservative Party, speaks at a campaign event in Ottawa. (Justin Tang/The Canadian Press)\n\nHe went on to say that under the current Liberal government, the country is falling further behind its target from the Paris Agreement, to keep the rise in temperatures below 2C .\n\n\"I understand why [the youth] would be frustrated with this Liberal government.\u201d\n\nIn a written response, an NDP spokesperson said, \u201cIt is commendable to see young people engaged and rightfully calling on governments to take action on climate change. They are right to be worried about the future.\"\n\nJagmeet Singh, the leader of the NDP, makes an announcement in Toronto earlier this month. (Christopher Katsarov/Canadian Press)\n\n\u201cWhen even children are raising their concerns over the health of our planet, we know that the time of delay is over. We must take bold action to protect our environment.\u201d\n\nTaking her own action on climate change\n\nIn the meantime, Emma has made changes in her daily life to reduce her carbon footprint.\n\nShe currently lives in Montreal, where she\u2019s attending university.\n\nShe travels home to London, Ont., by bus, even if the drive takes 17 hours instead of 90 minutes by plane.\n\nEmma Lim, centre, participates in her first climate strike.. She has made several changes to her lifestyle to help reduce her carbon footprint. (Submitted by Emma Lim.)\n\nShe also stopped eating meat and buying new clothes.\n\n\u201cI really like to shop, so that was hard,\u201d she said.\n\nShe now shops exclusively at thrift stores.\n\n\u201cI remember in high school really caring about \u2026 following fashion trends,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t matter to me anymore.\u201d", "description": "Young people in Canada who are worried about the future of the planet are pledging not to have kids until the government takes action.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/kidsnews//content/_card_resize/No-future-THUMB.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
