With other playoff participants having trouble, he currently holds the last advancing position heading into the second-round elimination race Sunday at Kansas Speedway (2:30 p.m. ET), where 10 drivers remain mathematically eligible for six remaining spots in the Round of 8.\n\nThe defending Cup champion controls his own destiny thanks to his 18-point cushion on Alex Bowman, who sits just below the cutoff line. But a win by a driver currently on the outside would earn that driver an automatic berth and potentially put Logano in a precarious position.\n\nReigning series champion Joey Logano is clinging to the final spot to advance to the Round of 8 heading into Sunday's elimination race at Kansas Speedway.

Bowman finished second at Kansas in May and Chase Elliott, currently 22 points below the cutline, won this race a year ago. Clint Bowyer (24 points behind) and William Byron (27) also face virtual must-win situations. Kyle Larson, with his win at Dover, and Ryan Blaney, victorious at Talladega, are the lone drivers to have clinched berths in the third round.\n\nLogano knows something about making daring moves for the win at Kansas. In 2015, he responded to being run to the wall by Matt Kenseth by turning Kenseth with five laps remaining on the way to the playoff victory. That move, which contributed to Kenseth failing to advance in the playoffs while Logano earned another race-winning trophy for his shelf, helped prod Kenseth to wreck Logano two weeks later at Martinsville Speedway.\n\nFast forward three years again to Martinsville, and Logano banged sheet metal with Martin Truex Jr. en route to the win, a victory that earned him a championship berth and allowed him three weeks to focus on the season finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway, where Logano won the race to capture his title.\n\nIt can be argued that Logano has set the standard of what\u2019s permissible when it comes to playoff racing \u2014 just how far drivers are willing to push the limits to win races and advance.\n\n\u201cWhen the playoffs come around, you\u2019ve got to find another gear in yourself, in your aggression,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to go out there and say, \u2018What do I have to do for my race team to win?\u2019 They do their job, I need to do my job, and I need to make sure that I get every bit out of it no matter what.\u201d\n\nLogano makes no apologies for the way he has raced his competitors in the playoffs. His nine playoff wins since NASCAR implemented the elimination format in 2014 rank as the most of any driver.\n\nCHASTAIN: One-on-one with watermelon farmer turned NASCAR driver\n\nBOWYER: Signs extension with Stewart-Haas Racing\n\nSTENHOUSE: Inks multiyear deal to drive for JTG Daugherty Racing\n\nTRAGEDY: Ex-NASCAR team owner found dead in Ohio River\n\nEven though dozens of laps down at Dover, he raised the ire of Denny Hamlin by holding him up running his lane, causing Hamlin to lose the lead in Stage 2. Logano felt he couldn\u2019t give up another lap near the end of a stage and could potentially catch one of the slower cars. He never did.\n\n\u201cWhen the playoffs come around, there\u2019s just less give-and-take on the race track,\u201d Logano said. \u201cI\u2019m not just talking about me. It\u2019s dog eat dog out there.\u201d\n\nBut when Logano talks about the proper etiquette of give-and-take, he might have a different view than others.\n\n\u201cNow we\u2019re going to race him extra hard for what? The reason is because he didn\u2019t want to go 26 laps down,\u201d Hamlin said. \u201cAnybody would tell you that\u2019s just not a good choice. No one is going out there maliciously trying to screw over Joey.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just saying that through these playoffs, you\u2019ve got not to have enemies. You\u2019ve got to have give-and-take. It\u2019s those deposits and withdrawls.\u201d\n\nLogano, who had to battle a perception early in his career of being intimidated, has overcome that image and believes a team will have to win under pressure at Homestead to win the title \u2014 so any preparation for that can help.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather not be in that fight,\u201d Logano said prior to Talladega. \u201cBut the facts are that we are and we need to overcome it. When your back is against the wall and you succeed, it\u2019s a way better feeling. It\u2019s a confidence builder. It can be a momentum builder that can propel you into maybe finishing higher in points than you expect.\"\n\nBob Pockrass is a FOX Sports NASCAR reporter.
