Investors tend to track the financial sector because bank stocks are thought to reflect the health of the broader American economy.\n\nShares of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Bank of America Corp. fell 2.4% and 1.7%, respectively. Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup Inc. and Morgan Stanley each fell at least 1%.\n\nThe broader S&P 500 dropped 0.7%.\n\nBond yields also slid, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note settling at 1.469% Tuesday, compared with 1.503% Friday. Yields fall when bond prices rise.\n\nA drop in bond yields, especially for longer-dated debt, typically hurts bank stocks because their profit margins tend to expand when there is a larger difference between short-term deposit costs and longer-term lending rates.\n\nInvestors also have raised bets that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again this year, which could potentially weigh on bank margins. But some analysts said that questions surrounding central-bank policy aren't the only thing that have been weighing on investors' minds. The ongoing trade war between Washington and Beijing threatens to crimp corporate profits.\n\n\"It's more of a confidence problem when it comes to banks because companies are more apprehensive about investing in their business with the backdrop of a trade war going on,\" said R.J. Grant, director of equity trading at KBW Inc. \"The rate picture is just one thing to monitor, not the predominant thing.\"\n\nWrite to Jessica Menton at Jessica.Menton@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 03, 2019 16:56 ET (20:56 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png"}
