Too many thought three days was not enough time to scrutinize the bill, which runs to more than 100 pages.\n\nReacting to the vote, Johnson said he would pause the passage of the bill, reversing a statement he had made in the debate preceding the vote that if his timetable was rejected, he would pull the bill entirely and pursue a general election.\n\nThe defeat means Johnson will have to accept a delay if one is offered by the European Union. He will also miss his self-imposed deadline of taking the U.K. out of the bloc on October 31.\n\nAfter the pair of votes, Johnson said: \"I congratulate honorable members across the house on the scale of our collective achievement ... Certainly nobody thought that we could secure the approval of the house for a deal.\"\n\nBut he added: \"I must express my disappointment that the house has again voted for delay.\"\n\nJohnson said \"the government must take the only responsible course and accelerate our preparations for a no-deal outcome.\"\n\n\"We now face further uncertainty and the EU must now make up their minds over how to answer parliament\u2019s request for a delay ... I will speak to EU members states about their intentions,\" he said referring to the decision that the European Council must now make over whether to grant another delay, and if so for how long. \"Until they have reached a decision, we will pause this legislation.\"\n\nThe prime minister also insisted that \"our policy remains that we should not delay, that we should leave the EU on October 31st.\"\n\n\"One way or another, we will leave the EU with this deal to which this house has just given its assent,\" he said.\n\nEuropean Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva said in a tweet that Brussels \"takes note of tonight\u2019s result and expects the U.K. government to inform us about the next steps.\" She added that European Council President Donald Tusk is consulting with EU leaders on London\u2019s request for an extension until January 31, 2020.\n\nJohnson is likely to push for an election before Christmas. But he would need opposition MPs to back a vote, either through a motion in the Commons or through a no-confidence vote in his government.", "description": "MPs thought three days was not enough time to scrutinize the bill, which runs to more than 100 pages.", "authors": ["Emilio Casalicchio", "Ma\u00efa De La Baume"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1166233039-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
