Still, it's hardly looking like a bonanza for the plaintiffs.\n\nPlaintiff lawyer Damien Scattini, a partner at Quinn Emanuel, says there is no reason for Myer to appeal.\n\n\"They won. The applicant may appeal, and then Myer could cross-appeal to say that His Honour got it wrong about market-based causation.\n\n\"I can\u2019t see the Full Court overturning the decision, which would leave someone throwing the dice in the High Court. My guess: market-based causation is here to stay.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot having to prove individual reliance or loss is a big plus for plaintiffs, given that Beach is saying courts will accept market-based causation as a way to measure loss.\n\nHowever Clyde & Co partner Janette McLennan says expert evidence on loss and quantum \"will continue to be a central battleground on which these cases are fought beyond the threshold-liability questions\".\n\n\"They are whether there was any information that was material to investors that was not disclosed to the market, and if there was whether any exceptions to disclosure under the listing rules apply.\"\n\nIt looks very much like the plaintiff in this case has taken one for the class actions team. The case wasn't good enough to get over the line, but next time it might be very different.", "description": "The big takeaway from the case is that market-based causation is alive and well. That's the bit that encouraged the litigation funders on Thursday, even if Justice Beach didn't lay down strict markers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.0605%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_54/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c386351328a8c60c5968e9e22662b6f4c72126f4", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
