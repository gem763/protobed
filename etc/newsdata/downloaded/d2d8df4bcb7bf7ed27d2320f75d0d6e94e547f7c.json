For the first time, there is a new element to them, they seem to be more decentralised and more leaderless than previous bouts of protests.\n\n\"These are more violent in their manifestation and they are composed of a newer generation completely unaffiliated with any of the organised political actors, including oppositional secular trends that would lead previous bouts protests.\n\nThis newer generation seems to be completely divorced from that, and they seem to be completely in opposition to any of the organised political movements, whether in government or out.\n\nThere is also a rejection of the system in its entirety for the first time we are hearing the famous slogan from the Arab Spring \u2014 'the people want the downfall of the regime',\" he says.\n\nWhilst there is much anger at Abdul Mahdi, Haddad says the entire political system is characterised by corruption and deeply entrenched party political interests.\n\nHow has the government responded?\n\nAs protests raged into a second day, Abdul Mahdi presided over an emergency session of the National Security Council.\n\nIn a statement released on Facebook, he condemned \"aggressors\" who threaten public order and praised 2the heroes of our armed forces who have shown high responsibility, restraint and compliance with the rules of protection of the protesters.\"\n\nIn Baghdad, journalist Nabil Salih tells Euronews of seeing security forces \"firing live ammunition and gas cannisters into crowds of unarmed protesters, young and old.\"\n\n\"Protesters carried bottles of Pepsi and Coke to deal with injuries caused by tear gas canisters fired at them by security forces.\"\n\nHaddad believes that the government\u2019s response has been \"immensely counter productive.\"\n\nAt least 31 people have now been killed in the past three days of clashes.\n\nIn Baghdad, the authorities on Wednesday attempted to head off protests by imposing a curfew, with troops patrolling main roads and public spaces,\n\nHowever as 4,000 protesters in Baghdad on Thursday night in defiance of the curfew, Abdul Mahdi's office said the prime minister was \"continuing contacts\" with protesters in a bid to end the crisis and \"return to normal life\".\n\nNetwork data from the NetBlocks internet observatory shows that some connectivity returned briefly to parts of Iraq 28 hours after the country imposed a nationwide information blackout earlier this week.\n\nIThe ramifications of internet outages in Iraq go well beyond the immediate sharing of information.\n\nIf the block remains in place, it could cost Iraq's economy as much as \u00a340 million, according to Alp Toker, director of NetBlocks.\n\n\"This is because business is highly reliant on telecommunications for trade at every level, from the energy sector to cash-in-hand traders,\" he says. \"We aren't looking at a developing country but a regional power which is why the impact is marked.\"\n\nHow will this play out?\n\nAlthough Abdul Mahdi\u2019s offer to meet with \"representatives of peaceful demonstrators\" may seem a positive step, Haddad notes that there is no set of unified demands being presented by protesters.\n\n\"If the government folds, the most likely scenario would perhaps be a change of faces within the same order, I think this what political classes are banking on,\" he says. \"They hope the protests can be contained, they are hoping the protesters will run out of steam, and the Prime Minister will be thrown under the bus, and the system will reinvent itself.\"\n\nBut in the worst case scenario, there could be a further escalation of violence.\n\n\"That would see splits within the security and political establishment, and most dangerously, regional powers,\" he says. \"Domestic political forces would perhaps take advantage, this could lead to a cycle of violence.\"", "description": "Prime Minister Mahdi says he will listen to the ''legitimate'' demands of protesters, but with many calling for his downfall, what is next for Iraq?", "authors": ["Helena Skinner"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/20/48/30/1000x563_cmsv2_369986fc-36ca-5cdf-86b5-ce8f0cc23e39-4204830.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
