At the same time, overseeing the execution of the most wanted man in the world could bolster Trump\u2019s claim that he has things under control in the Middle East.\n\nDuring a 40-minute news conference following his remarks on Sunday, the president heaped praise on a reporter from the Trump-friendly outlet One America News who asked whether his effort to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria was a \u201cred herring\u201d used to lure Baghdadi out of hiding.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great question, and you\u2019re doing a great job, by the way,\u201d he said. \u201cYour network is fantastic.\u201d\n\nThroughout the rest of the news conference, Trump eagerly divulged operational details that would normally be reserved for expert officials to share at their discretion. The move immediately drew criticism from national security analysts who said they were alarmed by the volume of information he shared regarding the location and specifics of the nighttime raid.\n\nOver the course of his remarks, Trump revealed that Baghdadi had been \u201cunder surveillance for a couple of weeks\u201d; the number of helicopters involved in the mission and their time of liftoff; how special forces teams managed to penetrate the compound where Baghdadi was found; how lab technicians administered a \u201cgenius\u201d DNA test after he killed himself by detonating a suicide vest; and which \u201celement of the attack [U.S. forces] were most afraid of.\u201d\n\nDismissing concerns that Trump disclosed a potentially dangerous amount of information about the operation, one administration official said the president \u201cwas totally within his bounds as commander in chief.\u201d The official added that most of the details came in response to reporters once he had concluded his initial announcement \u2014 noting that Trump didn\u2019t intend to field questions after addressing the public, \u201cbut he got caught up in the moment like usual.\u201d\n\nSamantha Vinograd, a former Obama administration national security official, told CNN shortly after the president\u2019s press conference ended on Sunday: \u201cThis is obviously a major accomplishment, but from a counterrorism perspective, the president\u2019s engagement with the media on this is pretty surprising to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really unprecedented when you think about how much detail he actually went into,\u201d Vinograd added.\n\nTrump\u2019s remarks might have lacked the solemnity of President Barack Obama\u2019s announcement when U.S. forces killed Osama bin Laden, or the passion of President George W. Bush\u2019s bullhorn speech from Ground Zero in 2001, but it was true Trump from start to finish. At one point, he even compared monitoring the operation live from the situation room to \u201cwatching a movie.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe watched it so clearly. The technology there alone is really great,\u201d he said.\n\nOfficials involved with Trump\u2019s reelection were quick to hit back at those questioning the appropriateness of the president\u2019s language for focusing more on his style than on the substance of his announcement \u2014 something Trump and his supporters often gripe about.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you?\u201d Matt Wolking, head of the Trump campaign\u2019s rapid response operation, wrote on Twitter, responding to a CNN correspondent who said the president echoed \u201cthe crudeness you would often expect to hear from ISIS.\u201d\n\nTo avoid a loss of interest in the operation \u2014 which Trump is likely to invoke in the coming days as he continues to defend his partial withdrawal of U.S. troops from the Syrian border \u2014 White House officials and Trump allies borrowed another page from Trump\u2019s playbook: Within hours of the president\u2019s announcement, they were in a war with the news media. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham blasted The Washington Post for calling Baghdadi an \u201caustere religious scholar\u201d in a since-revised headline, while members of his 2020 campaign accused the media of purposefully trying to downplay the possible political impacts of Baghdadi\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cIt took 10 minutes for the news media to pivot to reassuring each other that it won\u2019t boost Trump,\u201d said Tim Murtaugh, the campaign\u2019s communications director.\n\nIf past is precedent, however, there is little evidence to suggest that Trump will see a sustained boost to his approval rating because Baghdadi was killed on his watch. A daily tracking poll run by Gallup during Obama\u2019s presidency showed a 6-point increase in his approval rating shortly after he announced bin Laden\u2019s death in May 2011, but by mid-June his gains had evaporated.\n\nI have no words. https://t.co/4zH9Ji0Smy \u2014 Stephanie Grisham (@PressSec) October 27, 2019\n\nTrump has repeatedly complained about receiving inadequate credit for his accomplishments, and it remains to be seen whether his campaign will highlight the death of Baghdadi in a bid to attract the attention of voters in key battleground states. Trump\u2019s campaign manager was silent on Twitter in the hours following the president\u2019s announcement on Sunday, and campaign officials told POLITICO they did not have plans to issue a statement of any kind.\n\n\u201cWe defer to POTUS remarks,\u201d Murtaugh said in a text message.\n\nMuch like other moments in his presidency, Trump was also accused of including exaggerated details and falsehoods in his version of events surrounding the special operation in Syria.\n\nWhile thanking the governments of Russia, Syria, Turkey and Iraq for their assistance with the operation, Trump claimed that Russia \u201copened up\u201d airspace to U.S. air units during the mission in Syria \u2014 a detail that a Kremlin spokesman disputed hours later.\n\n\u201cThe Russian Defense Ministry has no reliable information about U.S. servicemen conducting an operation for \u2018yet another\u2019 elimination of the former Daesh leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in the Turkish-controlled part of the Idlib de-escalation zone,\u201d Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry spokesman, Major General Igor Konashenkov, said in a statement, alluding to several reports of Baghdadi\u2019s death over the years.\n\nIn another strange turn, Trump appeared to claim that he predicted Osama bin Laden\u2019s role in the World Trade Center attacks in his 2000 book, \u201cThe America We Deserve.\u201d The seemingly random assertion came after the president was asked whether his decision to withdraw troops from Syria produced the intelligence at the center of the Baghdadi operation.\n\nThe president also drew criticism from congressional Democrats, whom he said he left in the dark until after Baghdadi was pronounced dead because he feared \u201cleaks\u201d about the mission. Sens. Richard Burr of North Carolina and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, both Republicans, were the only members of Congress who Trump said he informed of the operation before it took place.\n\n\u201cWe notified some, others are being notified now as I speak,\u201d the president told reporters at the White House. \u201cWe were going to notify them last night but we decided not to do that because Washington leaks like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen before.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called Baghdadi\u2019s death \u201csignificant\u201d in a statement Sunday afternoon that included a shot at Trump for failing to notify her of the operation beforehand: \u201cThe House must be briefed on this raid, which the Russians but not top Congressional Leadership were notified of in advance.\u201d\n\nThe overnight raid in Syria came amid the continued fallout over Trump\u2019s decision to wind down U.S. operations in the war-torn country, where his troop withdrawal paved the way for Turkish airstrikes earlier this month that killed hundreds of U.S.-backed Kurdish forces and civilians. The move has drawn a steady stream of bipartisan criticism, including from members of Trump\u2019s core base \u2014 some of whom condemned his plan to lift sanctions against Turkey following a temporary ceasefire negotiated by his administration.\n\nBut the reaction among Trump\u2019s Capitol Hill allies on Sunday might have been an early indication that the tides are turning in his favor, something he will probably refer back to if the situation in Syria further deteriorates and he is subject to criticism once again.\n\nGraham, one of the most forceful Republican critics of the president\u2019s decision to pull U.S. troops out of Syria, called Baghdadi\u2019s death \u201ca game changer in the war on terror,\u201d while former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, who called Trump\u2019s Syria decision a \u201chuge mistake,\u201d slammed the media and Democrats for dismissing the killing of the ISIS leader \u201cas no big deal.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/df/55/1de8a8d546358052851c76ae16c6/20191027-trump-announces-baghdadi-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
