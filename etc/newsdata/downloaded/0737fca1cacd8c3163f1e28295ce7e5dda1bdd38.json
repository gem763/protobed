(Chris Carlson/AP)\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s campaign manager said Saturday that the president and his family are \u201ca dynasty that will last for decades,\u201d prompting speculation about whether Trump\u2019s children might one day pursue their own bids for public office.\n\nBrad Parscale was speaking at a meeting of Republican Party delegates in Indian Wells, Calif., the Associated Press reported.\n\n\u201cThe Trumps will be a dynasty that will last for decades, propelling the Republican Party into a new party,\u201d Parscale said, according to the AP. \u201cOne that will adapt to changing cultures. One must continue to adapt while keeping the conservative values that we believe in.\u201d\n\nIn an exchange with reporters after the event, Parscale declined to say whether he thinks Trump\u2019s children might run for office, saying only, \u201cI think they are all amazing people with \u2026 amazing capabilities,\u201d the AP reported.\n\nAfter taking office in 2017, Trump named his eldest daughter, Ivanka, and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, senior White House advisers.\n\nFrom inviting her to the Group of 20 economic summit in Japan to including her in a small delegation that visited the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea, the president has repeatedly sought to promote Ivanka Trump on the world stage \u2014 often to the skepticism of observers, who have noted the first daughter\u2019s lack of political or foreign policy credentials.\n\n\u201cIt looks to the rest of the world like we have a kind of a constitutional monarchy,\u201d Christopher R. Hill, a former U.S. ambassador to South Korea and other countries, told The Washington Post earlier this year when asked about Ivanka Trump\u2019s prominence on the president\u2019s foreign trips.\n\nTrump tapped Kushner to lead his push to forge a Middle East peace plan. Those efforts have hit numerous speed bumps, and experts have voiced low expectations for the plan.\n\nThe president\u2019s adult sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, have taken active roles in their father\u2019s reelection campaign, appearing frequently at \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d rallies and denouncing Trump\u2019s political opponents on social media.\n\nAnne Gearan contributed to this report.", "description": "Brad Parscale told a Republican crowd in California that the Trumps are \u201cpropelling the Republican Party into a new party.\u201d", "authors": ["Felicia Sonmez", "National Reporter On The Washington Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/pl90EarJSm8Myb1QBGkTQkFlrTc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JTQVLNWSLAI6TFQQ7NLMKURODQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
