The work was chosen as the symbol of this year\u2019s Biennale of Contemporary Sacred Art, the theme of which is \u201cOde to Life.\u201d\n\nThe title of the work \u2014 Our Lady of the Innocents \u2014 evokes the \u201choly innocents\u201d massacred by King Herod after the birth of Christ in an effort to kill the newborn \u201cking of the Jews\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis statue is in bad taste and offends by the negative message it sends about abortion,\u201d said Claire Moracchini, coordinator of the Nice-based abortion rights organization Planning Familial 06, who has petitioned the mayor to have the statue removed.\n\n\u201cIn fact, for us this is part of the general atmosphere that aims to make the women who have abortions feel guilty,\u201d she said.\n\nThe president of the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur LGBT Center, Erwann Le H\u00f4, added his condemnation of the sculpture.\n\n\u201cBlaming women for the interruption of pregnancy is unacceptable,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cIn France, abortion is a right. Its obstruction can be punished by law.\u201d\n\nA Menton, pol\u00e9mique autour de \"Notre Dame des innocents\", une sculpture qui fustige l'avortement https://t.co/QmYSIQLdgB via @franceinfo \u2014 Culturebox (@Culturebox) October 1, 2019\n\nFor her part, the sculptor said that the work underscores the value of every human life.\n\n\u201cI simply wanted to give a testimony of the beauty that life represents,\u201d Du Barry told local media. \u201cHow many unborn children could have been geniuses?\u201d\n\n\u201cA child is a gift from God. The Virgin is crying because these children have not been born,\u201d she told France Info, explaining that she \u201ccreated this monument to raise awareness.\u201d\n\nThe explanatory plaque accompanying the sculpture says that \u201cwomen who have aborted and repent, couples who have had difficulties having children, and families who have problems with their offspring, will find in this Virgin Mary listening, affection, and forgiveness.\u201d\n\nThe president of the Biennale of Contemporary Sacred Art, Liana Marabini, defended the theme of the work as central to the Christian message of redemption.\n\n\u201cThese are children we did not want,\u201d Marabini said. \u201cIn saving them she [Mary] is also trying to save the souls of the parents who discarded them.\u201d\n\nThe Biennale was not Madame Marabini\u2019s first foray into promoting sacred art.\n\nIn 2010, Marabini founded the Mirabile Dictu Catholic Film Festival under the patronage of the Pontifical Council for Culture, in an effort to highlight the beauty of the Church\u2019s contribution to culture.\n\nA convert to Catholicism, Marabini holds up the Church as \u201cthe greatest patron of the arts of all time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere would Leonardo, Michelangelo, Bramante and Raphael and so many others have been without the Church?\u201d she told Breitbart News.\n\nThe Biennale festival is taking place until October 30 at Le Grand Hotel des Ambassadeurs in Menton and features over 200 works of sacred art including paintings, sculptures, photographs, cinema, music, literature, architecture and design.\n\n\"France\u2019s highest admin court ruled that a cross surmounting a statue of Saint John Paul II must be removed\"\u2026 https://t.co/sGTcsNbyQu \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 2, 2017\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "A Catholic art festival in France has sparked the wrath of the abortion industry with a bronze statue titled \u201cNotre-Dame des Innocents.\u201d", "authors": ["Thomas D.
