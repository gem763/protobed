Take yourself out of the \u2018over treatment\u2019 circle - and be patient.'\n\nDr Timm Golueke, a dermatologist at Urban Retreat, in London, reveals that certain skin problems can be a massive give away to how you're feeling mentally and physically\n\nANXIETY\n\nTim says that he can normally spot anxieties around the jawline.\n\n'Anxieties effect how you mimic muscles round your jawline. I can see if the smile isn't real or is from deep inside. If it is being forced and is less defined at the jawline, especially around the corners of the mouth, it can really show.\n\n'This muscle is called the depressor anguli oris (triangularis) - a facial muscle associated with frowning.\n\n'If you are full of anxieties and sadness this muscle will be much more over used as you're forcing it - therefore causing fine lines to appear around this area.'\n\nRUN DOWN\n\nPuffy or dark circles are a massive giveaway that you're run down or tired and need more down time or sleep - Timm says.\n\n'Lack of sleep can cause big eye problem \u2013 and will show up as dark circles. Dark circles can be genetic, if you tend to have them anyway they can get worse when you're run down.'\n\n'However most people can suffer from them - even if you're not prone to them genetically'.\n\n'If you want to mimic the signs of less tired then hydrating the skin and making sure you prep it well, if you know you are going to have a busy week, is key.'\n\nIf you want to mimic the signs of less tired skin then hydrating the skin and making sure you prep it well, if you know you are going to have a busy week, is key\n\n'There are three key ingredients to help your skin repair itself. Hylarounic acid is a big part of it as it hydrates the skin, while anti-oxidants (vitamin c and E) are also important, especially if you live in a city.\n\n'They're important as pollution leads to free radicals and tha tleads to a turn down of collagen \u2013 anti-oxidants neutralises those free radicals. Retinol (Vitamin A) is also important as it's exfoliating and also helps to produce new collagen in our skin.'\n\nPOOR DIET\n\nA bad diet can result in black heads around the cheek areas, but detoxing can make it worse.\n\n'The big food groups which are proven to show up these impurities are diary and sugar - they will show up as black heads and oily skin.'\n\nNewly opened Urban Retreat in Knightsbridge is the brainchild of Managing Director, Reena Hammer who has selected the best anti-ageing, beauty and holistic practitioners including Dr Timm Golueke, dermatologist at the London spa\n\n'This will show up on our cheeks - as this is where we have the most sebaceous glands.'\n\n'However be careful when you detox, or start dieting, as a change in diet can also effect our hormones and is again another main reason we get impurities.'\n\nHORMONE IMBALANCE\n\n'Hormonal imbalance normally occurs when there's changes in our body, such as when you're menstruating or during pregnancy.\n\n'If your hormones are not in balance then the sebaceous glands won't be working as they should - leaving yours skin dryer. Your skin will glow less and the colour of your skin can change.'\n\nBut Timm says that the most important factor is to find the right skin care to correct this - that matches your skin type. While products shouldn't be over used.\n\n'Don\u2019t buy ten new products at once, just buy one, see if your skin reacts well to it - you don\u2019t have to use 15 different products on top of each other.'", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: London dermatologist Dr Timm Golueke said that anxiety causes muscles around the jaw to work harder leading to fine lines, while hormonal imbalances cause chin acne.", "authors": ["Sarah Finley For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/14/19252104-0-image-a-17_1570109628538.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
