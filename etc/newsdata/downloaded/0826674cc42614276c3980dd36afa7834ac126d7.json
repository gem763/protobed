REUTERS/Washington Alves/File Photo\n\n\u201cState prosecutors are working with the state police, federal prosecutors and federal police, and we\u2019re of the conviction that we\u2019ll deliver a solution in the coming days,\u201d Ant\u00f4nio S\u00e9rgio Tonet, the top prosecutor in the state of Minas Gerais, told journalists.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to conclude our investigations and bring the guilty to justice,\u201d he said.\n\nIn January, a tailings dam at a Vale-owned mine in Minas Gerais collapsed, unleashing more than 12 million cubic meters of mining waste on the small town of Brumadinho and killing hundreds. It was the second fatal burst at a Vale-linked dam in the state in just over three years.\n\nIn the months since, prosecutors have identified ample evidence that employees at Vale and the Brazilian division of Germany\u2019s TUV SUD, which inspected the dam, were aware of elevated risks associated with the structure. Earlier on Tuesday, Reuters reported that Vale misrepresented the steps it had taken to mitigate safety issues following the first dam collapse in 2015.\n\nTonet\u2019s comments came as an investigative committee set up by Minas Gerais\u2019 state assembly delivered a report to the prosecutor suggesting that 11 Vale employees and two TUV SUD employees be indicted for their alleged roles in the disaster.\n\nIn July, a federal Senate panel suggested that Vale\u2019s chief financial officer and its chief executive at the time of the incident should be indicted for murder.\n\nThe company could also face charges.\n\nIn a statement, Vale said it \u201crespectfully disagrees with the suggestion to indict the company\u2019s employees and executives of the company.\n\n\u201cVale considers it fundamental that there be a expertise-based, technical and scientific conclusion about the causes of the rupture of the B1 dam before responsibility is determined,\u201d the company said, adding that it would continue collaborating with investigators.", "description": "A criminal investigation into the fatal collapse of a dam owned by mining firm Vale SA should be concluded in the coming days, a Brazilian prosecutor said on Tuesday, with charges to follow.", "authors": ["Marta Nogueira", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1431015806&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G21F", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
