The law was viewed as discriminatory against the LGBTQ community.\n\nDENNIS RODMAN SUGGESTS HE CAN SOLVE ISSUES BETWEEN NBA AND CHINA: 'I KNOW A THING OR TWO ABOUT DIPLOMACY'\n\nThe NBA came down hard on the state and removed the planned 2017 NBA All-Star Game from Charlotte as punishment for the so-called \"bathroom bill.\" The city was then re-awarded the 2019 NBA All-Star Game after the state repealed the bill in March 2017.\n\nWhile the NBA has put on a balancing act over Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey\u2019s tweet and the consequences stemming from it, McCrory told the Charlotte Observer that it is hypocritical for the NBA to meet some kind of middle ground with China while failing to do so in 2016 with his state.\n\n\u201cI see hypocrisy,\u201d McCrory told the newspaper. \u201cThey wanted to involve themselves with North Carolina commerce and an election, while not setting the same standard for China.\u201d\n\nPRO-HONG KONG NBA FAN BOOTED FROM PHILADELPHIA 76ERS PRESEASON GAME AGAINST CHINESE TEAM\n\nHe added: \u201cI called them out then [when the All-Star Game was moved], and it\u2019s still true now.\u201d\n\nMcCroy said he doesn\u2019t believe the NBA\u2019s decision to nix the All-Star Game from Charlotte was more of a business decision than one based on principles.\n\n\u201cThey were losing some sponsorships; they told me that flat-out on the phone,\u201d he told the newspaper, adding that the lukewarm response to China\u2019s outrage was about protecting the NBA as a major market in the communist country. He also said he told Silver in 2016 that the NBA had failed to sanction China over the way it rules.\n\nMcCrory lost the governor race to Democrat Roy Cooper by 0.2 percentage points in 2016.\n\nSilver has attempted to dampen the firestorm in China over the tweet from Morey, which read: \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nSAN ANTONIO SPURS' GREGG POPOVICH HITS TRUMP WHILE EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR ADAM SILVER AMID CHINA ROW\n\nSilver said in a statement Tuesday the league \u201cwill not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is inevitable that people around the world \u2013 including from America and China \u2013 will have different viewpoints over different issues,\u201d Silver said in the statement. \u201cIt is not the role of the NBA to adjudicate those differences.\u201d\n\nSilver added: \u201cThis is about far more than growing our business ...Values of equality, respect, and freedom of expression have long defined the NBA -- and will continue to do so. As an American-based basketball league operating globally, among our greatest contributions are these values of the game.\u201d\n\nSilver still planned on heading to Shanghai on Wednesday ahead of a planned preseason game between the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nHowever, China has already canceled two NBA Cares events and the league has postponed a media availability with the players.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the game will still take place this week.", "description": "The former governor of North Carolina slammed the NBA and commissioner Adam Silver on Tuesday over the way the league has handled the firestorm over a general manager\u2019s pro-Hong Kong tweet.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is A Sports Reporter For Foxnews.Com", "Foxbusiness.Com.
