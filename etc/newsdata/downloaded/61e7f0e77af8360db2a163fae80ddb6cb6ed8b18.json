The deal priced at $23 a share, above the expected range of $19 to $22.\n\nThe slide marks the year\u2019s worst stock-market debut for a U.S. company valued at over $1 billion, according to Dealogic data on IPOs on U.S. exchanges. By comparison, shares of Uber Technologies Inc. fell 7.6% on their first day of trading in May.\n\nSmileDirectClub listed on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol SDC. The company sells clear teeth aligners directly to consumers without requiring visits to orthodontists\u2019 offices, at a fraction of the price of traditional treatments.\n\nThe startup received backing at a $3.2 billion valuation last year from Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, Kleiner Perkins and Spark Capital. Its IPO was closely watched by other firms in the emerging business of teledentistry, such as Candid Care Co. and Uniform Teeth, which are seeking to disrupt the traditional orthodontics industry.\n\nEven with its first-day tumble, SmileDirectClub has increased in valuation from its last funding round. Based on its Thursday closing price, the company has a market capitalization of more than $6 billion.\n\nEstablished orthodontists have cast doubt on the company\u2019s methods. The American Association of Orthodontists said in a statement in July that it had \u201cserious concerns\u201d about the approach used by SmileDirectClub and its peers. The group said it had filed complaints against the startup with dental boards and authorities in 36 states.\n\nSmileDirectClub has defended its methods and dismissed the group\u2019s complaints as the reaction of an entrenched industry trying to defend its profit margins.\n\nA spokeswoman for SmileDirectClub didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nWrite to Alexander Osipovich at alexander.osipovich@dowjones.com", "description": "Reality bites for teeth-straightening startup SmileDirectClub, which plunged 28% on its first day of trading.", "authors": ["Alexander Osipovich", "Alexander.Osipovich Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106664/social", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
