Tulsi Gabbard gets 2020 endorsement from David Duke", "language": "en", "text": "Democratic presidential hopeful Rep. Tulsi Gabbard has apparently gotten an endorsement she said she can do without \u2014 from former KKK leader David Duke.\n\nThe 68-year-old white supremacist and former GOP Louisiana state senator plastered a banner on his Twitter page prominently featuring a photograph of the Hawaiian lawmaker, the New York Post reported.\n\n\u201cTulsi Gabbard for President,\u201d it blares, along with the tagline: \u201cFinally a candidate who will actually put America First rather than Israel First!\u201d\n\n\u201cTulsi Gabbard is currently the only Presidential candidate who doesn\u2019t want to send White children off to die for Israel,\u201d the former Grand Wizard tweeted his more than 50,000 followers along with a photograph of Gabbard meeting a US service member and his child.\n\nBut Gabbard wasted no time in lashing back at Duke and rejected his backing.\n\n\u201cI have strongly denounced David Duke\u2019s hateful views and his so-called \u2018support\u2019 multiple times in the past, and reject his support,\u201d she told The Post in a statement Tuesday.\n\n\u201cPublicizing Duke\u2019s so-called \u2018endorsement\u2019 is meant to distract from my message: that I will end regime-change wars, work to end the new cold war and take us away from the precipice of a nuclear war, which is a greater danger now than ever before.\u201d\n\nGabbard \u2014 who is of Samoan heritage \u2014 served with the US Army National Guard in Iraq from 2004 to 2005 and was first elected to office in Hawaii in 2013.\n\nThe 37-year-old received Duke\u2019s unwelcome endorsement despite several moves signaling her potential support for the Jewish state.\n\nIn November 2016, Duke tweeted that Gabbard was a representative of a \u201cpolitical realignment\u201d he hoped to see in the US \u2014 and called for Donald Trump to appoint her secretary of state.\n\nShe responded: \u201cU didn\u2019t know I\u2019m Polynesian/Cauc? Dad couldn\u2019t use \u2018whites only\u2019 water fountain. No thanks. Ur white nationalism is pure evil.\u201d\n\nThe following month, she tweeted: \u201cOur movement is one of love/aloha, inclusivity. Duke represents hatred, racism, anti-Semitism, fear. We don\u2019t want his \u2018support.\u2019 Period.\u201d\n\nIn the early 2000s, Gabbard touted working for her father\u2019s anti-gay organization, which sought to pass a measure against same-sex marriage in her state and promoted controversial conversion therapy.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, she said: \u201cFirst, let me say I regret the positions I took in the past, and the things I said. I\u2019m grateful for those in the LGBTQ+ community who have shared their aloha with me throughout my personal journey.\u201d\n\nDuke also endorsed Trump for president in 2016.\n\nWhen asked by CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper in February that year whether he\u2019d disavow the former Grand Wizard, the then-Republican candidate said: \u201cJust so you understand, I don\u2019t know anything about David Duke, OK?\u201d\n\nDuke again praised Trump\u2019s presidency after the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017 in which Trump claimed there were \u201cvery fine people on both sides.\u201d\n\nDuke did not immediately respond to a message for comment Tuesday.", "description": "Democratic presidential hopeful Rep.
