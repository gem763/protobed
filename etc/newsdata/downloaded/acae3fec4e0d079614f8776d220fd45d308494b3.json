(Mariah Tiffany/Viking/AP)\n\nInitially, Chanel Miller did not want the world to know her name. If the world didn\u2019t know her name, it would mean that she had never been found half-naked behind a Stanford University dumpster \u201cwith her underwear six inches away from her bare stomach.\u201d It would mean that she had never been sexually assaulted by a stranger.\n\nShe never would have found herself addressing that man, Brock Turner, at the court hearing where he was sentenced to six months in county jail for attacking her while she was unconscious.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know me, but you\u2019ve been inside me,\u201d Miller told him, \u201cand that\u2019s why we\u2019re here today.\u201d\n\nMiller\u2019s searing victim impact statement, delivered in June 2016, sent shock waves across a country not accustomed to hearing sexual assault victims address their attackers in court. At the time, she was known only as 23-year-old \u201cEmily Doe.\u201d But Miller has come forward now to reveal her identity ahead of the release of her memoir, \u201cKnow My Name,\u201d on Sept. 24.\n\nShe spoke with CBS News\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d which released a video of Miller reading part of her victim impact statement publicly for the first time. CBS is scheduled to air the full interview Sept. 22.\n\n\u201cIn newspapers, my name was \u2018unconscious intoxicated woman,\u2019 10 syllables, and nothing more than that,\u201d Miller said in the excerpt she read in the CBS video. \u201cFor a while, I believed that that was all I was. I had to force myself to relearn my real name, my identity. To relearn that this is not all that I am.\u201d\n\nTurner, who at the time of the assault was a freshman at Stanford and a member of the varsity swimming team, was found guilty on three counts of felony sexual assault for the Jan. 18, 2015, incident outside a fraternity party. California judge Aaron Persky sentenced Turner to six months in jail, but because of good behavior he served only three.\n\nCritics decried what they viewed as Persky\u2019s leniency, while the judge said he was obligated to consider rehabilitation and probation for first-time offenders such as Turner. Many people criticized the sentence as too small a price to pay, given the magnitude of the crime. Voters ousted Persky, a judge in Santa Clara County, after a recall campaign last year.\n\n[Voters remove judge who sentenced Brock Turner to six months in Stanford sexual assault case]\n\nMiller, a recent University of California at Santa Barbara graduate at the time, had gone to the fraternity party with her younger sister on the night of the assault, she said in her victim impact statement. She let her guard down, she said, and drank liquor too fast without recognizing that her tolerance had waned since her college days.\n\nWhat she remembers next was waking up on a gurney in a hospital hallway, Miller said, and being told that she had been assaulted. But she learned the details of what had happened to her the way the rest of the world did \u2014 reading the news on her phone while at work.\n\n\u201cYou have dragged me through this hell with you, dipped me back into that night again and again,\u201d Miller told Turner at the sentencing hearing. \u201cYou knocked down both our towers. I collapsed at the same time you did. Your damage was concrete, stripped of titles, degrees, enrollment. My damage was internal, unseen. I carry it with me.\u201d\n\n[\u2018You took away my worth\u2019: A sexual assault victim\u2019s powerful message to her Stanford attacker]\n\nMiller\u2019s memoir will be published by Penguin Random House, whose website describes Miller as a San Francisco resident and a writer and artist who studied literature in college.\n\n\u201cThe damage is done. No one can undo it,\u201d Miller told Turner in court. \u201cAnd now we both have a choice. We can let this destroy us, I can remain angry and hurt and you can be in denial, or we can face it head on \u2014 I accept the pain, you accept the punishment, and we move on.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nPolice spent years looking for a serial rapist.
