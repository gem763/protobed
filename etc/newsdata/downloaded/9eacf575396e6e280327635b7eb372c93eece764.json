While some of the most anticipated IPOs\u2014 Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE: ) and LYFT Inc (NASDAQ: )\u2014failed to live up to expectations, other little-known entrants, such as Beyond Meat Inc (NASDAQ: ) and Zoom Technologies Inc (OTC: ), became investors\u2019 new darlings.\n\nThe past month, however, has offered the clearest signal yet to issuers that the appetite for new listings is drying up fast, especially for companies that have yet to produce profits.\n\nBelow, we discuss three recent IPOs that proved some of the biggest flops of the year, highlighting the uncertainty about the economy and markets that\u2019s pushing investors to the sidelines.\n\n1. Peloton Interactive\n\nThe New York-based Peloton Interactive Inc (NASDAQ: ), known for its high-end exercise bikes, is among those names that failed to impress investors in the public markets.\n\n\n\nPeloton, which was able to raise more than $1.16 billion in its IPO on Sept. 25, is trading almost 15% down from its listing price of $29 a share, becoming one of the largest flops among the companies that raised at least $1 billion in the past 10 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeloton price chart\n\n2. SmileDirectClub\n\nWith more than 1.4 million members, Peloton describes itself as the \u201clargest interactive fitness platform in the world.\u201d It also has an app that sells its exercise programs to users who don\u2019t own its hardware but are willing to pay a monthly subscription fee for the classes. The company sells its basic \u201cconnected fitness\u201d subscription for $39 a month and bikes starting at about $2,000.While the company has shown a good trajectory of rising sales, it lost $196 million on sales of $915 million during the 12 months ended June 30, to filings. That compared with a loss of $48 million on $435 million in sales during the same period a year earlier.\n\nSmileDirectClub (NASDAQ: ), the maker of alternatives to dental braces, raised $1.35 billion last month in this year\u2019s fifth-largest IPO, but its fate was no different than other big flops.\n\nIts stock, trading at $13.21 on Monday, is down more than 40% from its IPO price\u2014a public market reception that made investors surprised as the company\u2019s business model looks quite attractive.\n\nSmileDirectClub price chart\n\nSmileDirectClub ships clear aligners directly to customers, whose progress is monitored remotely by licensed dentists or orthodontists. Customers either go to a so-called SmileShop and get a free 3-D image taken of their teeth or buy a kit online to make an impression of their teeth to mail to SmileDirectClub. A dental professional then reviews the information and prescribes aligners if appropriate.\n\nThe company says the average treatment plan is around six months, significantly shorter than the 12 to 24 months a traditional course of braces would take. SmileDirectClub claims that its treatment costs less than 60% than any traditional orthodontic braces procedure.\n\nSmileDirectClub made $423.2 million in sales last year, a 190% increase from the year before. But to generate those sales, it had to spend a lot, with marketing and selling expenses growing more than threefold to $213.1 million in 2018 from $64.2 million in 2017. These expenses more than doubled its losses to about $75 million in 2018 from about $33 million a year ago.\n\n3. WeWork\n\nThe New York-based WeWork (NYSE: ), which leases and owns spaces in office buildings and then typically rents desks to customers ranging from startups to corporations, officially withdrew its IPO bid yesterday after it failed to generate the support it needed to list the company.\n\nThe path to becoming a publicly traded company was so tumultuous for WeWork that it cost its co-founder Adam Neumann and chief executive officer his job: he stepped down last week after the board raised concerns about the corporate governance and the aggressive growth of the money-losing startup.\n\nThe WeWork debacle in the public market also shows a stark difference in how investors value a firm that has got a huge backing from private investors. WeWork, for example, has raised more than $12 billion since its founding nine years ago, but never turned a profit.\n\nThe company had been targeting a share sale of about $3.5 billion in September, according to media reports, but its prospectus failed to present a case where investors could see a clear path to profitability.", "description": "Shares Analysis by Investing.com (Haris Anwar/Investing.com) covering: Zoom Technologies Inc, Uber Technologies Inc, LYFT Inc, Beyond Meat Inc.
