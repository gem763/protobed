Matthew Broderick as Mike Pompeo", "language": "en", "text": "Most of the time, SNL relies on Alec Baldwin to swing by and gift the show with five minutes of his bizarre Trump impersonation. We were prepared for his absence this season, since he (once again) loudly claimed he was finished with the role. But last week, he and his open-mouthed Trump popped up again. This week, though, he was nowhere to be found for the first time in a while.\n\nInstead, the cold open began with Beck Bennett\u2019s Vice President Pence, Kate McKinnon\u2019s Rudolph W. Giuliani and Aidy Bryant\u2019s William P. Barr sitting in the Office of the Vice President and discussing the impeachment probe.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMcKinnon\u2019s Guiliani is disappointed that it\u2019s all happening during his \u201cbusy season, Halloween,\u201d continuing the Guiliani-as-ghoul gag. SNL\u2019s Pence says Trump can\u2019t be there because he\u2019s \u201cmeeting with an alligator breeder about filling a moat at the border.\u201d Bryant\u2019s Barr isn\u2019t worried about the text messages exchanged between government officials working on the U.S.-Ukraine relationship. He pulls out his phone to read them. \u201cThis one says, \u2018I think we should stop texting about the crimes, and maybe tell the crimes over the phone, so the crimes don\u2019t leave little crime footprints,\u2019\" he says. \u201cSee, it\u2019s all taken care of.\u201d\n\nThe show\u2019s Pence is disappointed because he was \u201csupposed to be seeing the new Judy Garland movie with Mother,\u201d but Bryant\u2019s Barr assures him not to worry because \u201cpresidents get impeached every 30 to 40 years.\u201d He insists Pence \u201chave another glass of milk.\u201d Since \u201cit\u2019s 5 o\u2019clock somewhere,\u201d SNL\u2019s Pence picks up a rocks glass of the white stuff (sitting next to a decanter of it) and takes a sip.\n\nThe whole thing reeked of recycled jokes and simple regurgitation of the weeks\u2019 headline, but for a hot moment, it seemed like the show would actually rely on its own talent for the cold open. Literally a minute. Then Matthew Broderick appeared as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, fulfilling what seems to be the show\u2019s new mandate of having a random celebrity guest appear in the cold open each week.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cListen, I\u2019ve been asking around, and I think that this whole impeachment thing could be really bad,\u201d he tells the show\u2019s Pence. When asked who told him this devastating news, he replies, \u201cLike, America.\u201d\n\nWhile they then try to figure out what Pompeo does at the White House, Bryant\u2019s Barr points out that \u201cthe only original cabinet member left is Ben Carson.\u201d So who should enter the room but Kenan Thompson\u2019s Ben Carson. \u201cDid somebody say my name?\u201d he says.\u201d I\u2019ve been sitting in my empty office for like three years, and does anybody know what my job is supposed to be? If somebody could give me the password to my computer, that would be great help.\"\n\nAfter Barr and Carson exit, McKinnon\u2019s Guiliani says they\u2019re going to be fine if they just \u201cclose ranks, you know, like the mafia.\u201d Broderick\u2019s Pompeo replies, \u201cYeah, but the mafia was, like, smart. They didn\u2019t go on Fox News and tell people the crimes before they did them.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat reminds Giuliani that he has an appearance on Hannity and needs to slip into his stage makeup, which in one of the more on-the-nose sight gags, is actually clown makeup a la the Joker. \u201cWhile I\u2019m gone, you guys should get your stories straight. Something like how Hunter Biden started Pizzagate or how this can all be traced by to Tekashi 6ix9ine,\u201d he says. \u201cWhatever the worst idea is, text it to me so the feds have a record.\u201d\n\nThe show\u2019s Pompeo suggests they flee to one of the countries who would love to have them, like North Korea or Saudi Arabia.\n\nFinally, for no apparent reason, Alex Moffat\u2019s Sauli Niinist\u00f6, the president of Finland, is in the room. \u201cThe concept of diplomacy is very important,\u201d he says, which Pompeo calls \u201ccute.\"\n\nAD\n\n\u201cImpeachment moves pretty fast. If you don\u2019t stop and look around, you might miss it,\u201d Broderick\u2019s Pompeo says, a reference to his hit movie \u201cFerris Bueller\u2019s Day Off.\u201d Then, Stephen Miller appears as a snake in a wicker basket.\n\nAD\n\nWe certainly don\u2019t envy the SNL writers, as parodying a political system that feels like parody in and of itself is a tremendously difficult task. But, boy, is this growing stale. During last week\u2019s premiere, it became clear that we\u2019re in for more of the same this year. It\u2019s telling, though, that the biggest laugh the cold open got from its studio audience was a reference to a 1980s John Hughes movie.\n\nAD", "description": "The show continued its tradition of skewering the White House in the cold open by regurgitating the news, only this time without the help of Alec Baldwin.", "authors": ["Travis M.
