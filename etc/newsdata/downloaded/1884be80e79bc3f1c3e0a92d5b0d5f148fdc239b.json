He called this \"good news.\"\n\nThere was no immediate confirmation of a Morales victory from the Supreme Electoral Tribunal.\n\nBut Morales said later that if he does not obtain a 10-point margin he will respect this result. \"If we have to go to a second round, we will go,\" he said.\n\nMesa said Wednesday he would not recognize results tallied by the tribunal, which he accused of manipulating the count to help the leftist Morales win.\n\nMesa is insisting there be a runoff between him and the president, and called on supporters to keep protesting in the streets of this resource-rich but poor South American country.\n\nObservers from the Organization of American States have expressed concern over the vote count, which first showed Morales and Mesa in a tight race and headed for a runoff, and then shifted dramatically Monday to give the president a wider lead.\n\n- Election offices torched -\n\nThe European Union, Brazil, Argentina and the US also expressed concern over how the votes were tallied.\n\nThe US State Department updated its travel alert for Bolivia, urging \"increased caution ... due to civil unrest.\"\n\nClashes broke out between rival demonstrators Wednesday in the eastern city of Santa Cruz, the country's largest and an opposition bastion.\n\nOffices in the city housing Bolivia's electoral authority were set on fire overnight, and security forces clashed with demonstrators in La Paz and elsewhere.\n\nOn Monday, after the release of the controversial election results, mobs torched electoral offices in Sucre and Potosi, while rival supporters clashed in La Paz.\n\nA general strike went into force Wednesday.\n\nThe OAS and the Catholic church in Bolivia have called for a runoff election as the best way to end the crisis.\n\nMorales is seeking another term amid controversy.\n\nHe obtained Constitutional Court permission in 2017 to run again despite a 2016 referendum in which Bolivians said no to letting him do so.\n\nThe onetime leftist union leader has led Bolivia for the past 13 years, though his popularity has waned amid allegations of corruption and authoritarianism.\n\nMorales points to a decade of economic stability and considerable industrialization as his achievements, while insisting he has brought \"dignity\" to Bolivia's indigenous population, the largest in Latin America.", "description": "Bolivian President Evo Morales declared victory Thursday in elections whose disputed results have triggered riots, a general strike and opposition charges that he is trying to steal the election to secure a fourth straight term.
