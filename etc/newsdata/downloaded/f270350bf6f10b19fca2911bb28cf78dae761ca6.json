Esper. \u201cThis memorial where we gather for today\u2019s ceremony stands as an enduring testament to remember them, to honor them, to recall their sacrifice. But also, it inspires future generations to serve in defense of our great nation.\u201d\n\nThe war in Afghanistan began after the Taliban government provided refuge to al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and his cohorts before the 9/11 attacks. It has meandered for years, even after a Navy SEAL team killed bin Laden during a raid in neighboring Pakistan in May 2011.\n\nOn Wednesday, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, Army Gen. Austin \u201cScott\u201d Miller, spoke at a closed memorial service at the headquarters of the U.S.-led military coalition. The ceremony commemorated not only those lost on Sept. 11, but also the thousands of U.S., Afghan and other coalition service members who have died in the war since, said Army Col. Sonny Leggett, a U.S. military spokesman in Kabul.\n\nClashes between U.S. and Afghan forces and the Taliban have increased across the country, a defense official familiar with the ongoing operations said. The official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation, attributed the fighting to \u201cjockeying\u201d ahead of Afghan presidential elections scheduled for Sept. 28, an increase in violence as Afghanistan\u2019s traditional fighting season comes to a close and uncertainties created by the abrupt end of negotiations between the Trump administration and Taliban officials on Saturday.\n\nU.S. defense officials have declined repeatedly to address what could come next for the military in Afghanistan. The negotiations called for the Pentagon to withdraw about 5,400 of the 14,000 U.S. troops deployed, and it is not clear whether Trump will still pursue that level without a deal with the Taliban.\n\nOver the weekend, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said American forces had killed roughly 1,000 Taliban fighters in the previous 10 days. The statement echoed controversial body counts the United States used as a metric for success during the Vietnam War even as security there crumbled, but the defense official familiar with U.S. operations in Afghanistan said it is accurate.\n\nThe Taliban, he said, \u201care taking some really heavy casualties.\u201d\n\nU.S. officials released data showing that the military launched 810 strikes in August. Overall for the year, Air Force data shows the United States is on track to drop about the same number of munitions as in 2018.\n\nWhatever the situation surrounding the pace of U.S. operations, Pentagon leaders have acknowledged for years that the conflict is stuck in a bloody stalemate, and much of the countryside remains under partial or full Taliban control.\n\nJohnny Walsh, a former diplomat who worked on Afghanistan peace issues and is now at the U.S. Institute of Peace, said Taliban fighters are motivated by two primary goals: to end what they characterize as a foreign military occupation and to defeat what they see as a government dominated by foreign influence.\n\nTheir nationalist message \u201callows them to recruit a basically endless supply of new fighters from every corner of the country,\u201d he said. Although a majority of Afghans oppose the Taliban, the militant group \u201chas been very effective in tapping into the sector of society who support them.\u201d\n\nDavid Barno, a retired three-star general who commanded American forces early in the war, described the Taliban as a resilient and \u201cdeeply rooted\u201d organization. Even the kind of Special Operations raids that intensified during the peak of U.S. combat operations were likely to have only a transient impact on the group\u2019s strength, Barno said, as new insurgent leaders replace those killed.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the issue with \u2018mowing the grass,\u2019 \u201d he said.\n\nThe U.S. military continues to carry out counterterrorism operations in numerous countries, including Iraq, where victory was declared over the Islamic State in March. On Tuesday, U.S. military officials released video of American fighter jets dropping some 80,000 pounds of bombs on an island in the Tigris River \u201cinfested\u201d with Islamic State fighters.\n\nIn Washington, former president George W. Bush and his defense secretary as the wars were launched, Donald H. Rumsfeld, visited the black stone of the Pentagon Memorial in a separate, small event after Trump left.\n\nBush hung a white floral wreath at the memorial and visited with a small group of people waiting to meet with him, including first responders. He made no public remarks but shook hands with several people and embraced one woman, Lisa Dolan of Alexandria, after she approached him. Her husband, Navy Capt. Robert Dolan, was killed when American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon.", "description": "President Trump promised to hit the Taliban \"harder than they\u2019ve ever been hit,\" raising the question whether a withdrawal of some U.S. troops from Afghanistan is really possible.", "authors": ["Dan Lamothe", "Reporter Covering The Pentagon", "The U.S. Military", "Missy Ryan", "Military Issues", "National Security"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XB3NCWGUVII6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
