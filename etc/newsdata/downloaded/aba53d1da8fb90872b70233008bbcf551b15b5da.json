The government now says it is deploying military medics and doctors to help fill the gap at hospitals.\n\nSeveral government critics in recent weeks have been abducted from their homes, tortured and warned by suspected state security agents to back off from anti-government actions.\n\nSome in Zimbabwe have expressed concern that the government of President Emmerson Mnangagwa is becoming more repressive than that of longtime leader Robert Mugabe, who died earlier this month. Mugabe was accused of using abductions to silence critics, and some have never been found.\n\nSeveral dozen doctors chanted and sang on Wednesday as they tried to march to Parliament from the country\u2019s biggest hospital, Parirenyatwa, in Harare. Police insisted that they seek approval for the demonstration first.\n\nThe health workers also have been holding candlelight vigils for Magombeyi. Their association represents hundreds of newly qualified doctors doing their residencies.\n\nHealth professionals at other government hospitals across Zimbabwe have gone on strike in solidarity, union leaders told The Associated Press.\n\nBut it carries risks. The secretary-general of the Zimbabwe Nurses Association, Nhema Edwick, said he had received anonymous death threats for bargaining for more pay for nurses.\n\n\u201cThe government should stop targeting us as union leaders. All we are asking for is a living wage. I am also living in fear,\u201d he told the cheering demonstrators.\n\nSenior doctors said they have stopped working in solidarity with their juniors.\n\n\u201cIt is much easier to produce one person (Magombeyi) than to convince us to return to work. No Peter, no work,\u201d said Bothwell Mbuwayesango, a pediatric surgeon.\n\nZimbabweans left without health care expressed concern.\n\n\u201cWe are the ones who are suffering, they should just release the doctor,\u201d said Munei Ndlovu, sitting on the Parirenyatwa Hospital grounds. She said she had been told the hospital was attending to critical emergencies only.\n\nConcerns are rising as Magombeyi has been held longer than those abducted in recent weeks. \u201cWe are now not even sure whether he is alive or dead. We are praying he is still alive,\u201d said Harry Magombeyi, a family spokesman.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy on Monday said more than 50 civil society, labor and opposition leaders have been abducted in Zimbabwe since January, and called on the government \u201cto take action and hold perpetrators of these human rights violations accountable.\u201d\n\nMost abductees, including during Mugabe\u2019s time, were released after days or weeks of torture, at times following the intervention of the courts.\n\nHowever, some people such as journalist and activist Itai Dzamara, who was abducted in 2015, are still missing.\n\nState Security Minister Owen Ncube and Health Minister Obadiah Moyo on Tuesday said they had tasked security agents to locate Magombeyi. Other officials blamed a \u201cthird force\u201d linked to Mugabe for the abductions, asserting that they are bid to tarnish the president\u2019s image abroad and hurt efforts to have sanctions imposed by the West removed.\n\nThe country\u2019s biggest representative organization for churches, the Zimbabwe Council of Churches, on Tuesday questioned the \u201cthird force\u201d explanation, asking why only perceived government critics are being targeted.\n\n___\n\nFollow Africa news at https://twitter.com/AP_Africa\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Zimbabwean doctors protesting the alleged abduction of a union leader were met by a line of baton-wielding police in the capital on Wednesday as fears grow about government repression.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Farai Mutsaka"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/18/zimbabwe_abduction_57185_c0-217-5184-3239_s1770x1032.jpg?8b8f23121690e0737bdb7f9c933479ff63e997a3", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
