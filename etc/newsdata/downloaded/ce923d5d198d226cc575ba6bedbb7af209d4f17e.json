He recorded four strikeouts.\n\nThe Yankees will play the winner of the other AL Division Series between the Houston Astros and Tampa Bay Rays in the ALCS. The Astros currently lead that best-of-five series by a 2-1 margin.\n\nGleyber Torres blasted his first postseason home run and chipped in two stellar defensive plays in the game. Didi Gregorius had a pair of RBI singles, Brett Gardner plated another run with a single and Cameron Maybin belted a home run in the ninth to seal the victory.\n\nTwins starter Jake Odorizzi, who entered the game with a 7-9 record and 4.71 ERA in his career against the Yankees, gave up two runs on five hits across five innings and had five strikeouts.\n\nThe Twins\u2019 lone run came on a solo home run by Eddie Rosario off Yankees reliever Zack Britton in the eighth inning.\n\nGame 1 of the ALCS will be Saturday. The Yankees will host the series if they face the Rays, and will be on the road if they play the Astros.", "description": "Oct. 8 (UPI) \u2014 The New York Yankees cruised to a 5-1 victory over the Minnesota Twins to complete a three-game sweep in their NL Division Series and", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
