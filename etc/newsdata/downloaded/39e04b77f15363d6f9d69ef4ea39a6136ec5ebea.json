It's been about all the hopes and dreams we have as individuals and collectively in this city.\"\n\nReed's victory came in a city still getting to terms with its past. It was the first capital of the Confederate States of America in 1861.\n\nLast year, the Equal Justice Initiative opened the National Memorial for Peace and Justice and the Legacy Museum in downtown Montgomery to honor victims of lynching in the racially segregated era after the U.S. Civil War.\n\nThe city is the site of the Montgomery bus boycott, a year-long civil rights protest that started in 1955, led by black seamstress Rosa Parks, who refused to give up her seat to a white patron, as the law then required, and was famously jailed.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court ultimately ordered Montgomery to integrate its bus system, and one of the boycott leaders was the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., who would emerge as the most prominent leader of the American civil rights movement.\n\nReed was also the first African-American elected the county's probate judge in 2012, the Advertiser said. In 2015, he was the first probate judge in Alabama to issue same-sex marriage licenses.\n\nReed is scheduled to be sworn into office on Nov. 12 at city hall.
