But developers and lawyers fear such extra considerations will be used by NIMBY voices opposed to any development.\n\n\"In isolation, the changes will fail to deliver quality housing stock in our neighbourhoods,\" said ABL planning lawyer Andrea Towson.\n\n\"Some local councils have adopted directly contrary local housing policies, focussed entirely on neighbourhood preservation. The Victorian Planning Provisions should exempt BADS-compliant applications from third party notice and review.\"\n\nDesign review panels of professionals should assess proposals and if they meet required standards, forward them for approval, Mr Napier said.\n\n\"It\u2019s so important to actually take the decision-making away from councils, as soon as it gets too hard, they refuse and it goes to VCAT and gets bogged down in VCAT,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2017, the Victorian government set up the Apartment Design Advisory Service to give councils, developers and designers advice in complying with the new standards. It carries no weight in approvals and its role is also being assessed as part of the current review.\n\nIn NSW, the recommendations of design review panels appointed by councils carry legal weight and can be relied on by the council in determining a development application.\n\nBut even those panels' remit is limited to larger projects - three storeys and higher - and they have no role in the smaller scale \"missing middle\" medium-density residential projects needed in established suburbs.\n\nSmaller developers, who can ill-afford the cost of slow approval processes, needed faster ways to work, Ms Towson said.\n\n\"From the date a planning permit application is first lodged, it is taking at least four years to complete a development - and this doesn't factor in the additional time associated with transacting to purchase the development site,\" she said.\n\n\"The \u2018mum and dad\u2019 developers delivering smaller-scale apartments in emerging and outer neighbourhoods \u2013 precisely where the government wants these better apartments to be located \u2013 cannot afford to sit on capital and bear development holding costs year after year.\"", "description": "Lawyers and developers fear a revision of Victoria's apartment guidelines will make it easier for councils to reject planning applications.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3022%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_110/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/9dfed1ab0a84c3c3f8d6300ed6a87442f63032b3", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
