He also appeared to threaten to tell her mother if he was \"disobedient\" towards him.\n\nImage caption Dr Igbeneghu was secretly filmed by BBC Africa Eye\n\nA number of other students in the film also made allegations of abuse against the lecturer. One former student of Dr Igbeneghu, whose identity was protected, claimed the experience has led her to attempt suicide several times.\n\nThe University of Lagos, in response, held an emergency meeting on Monday where Dr Igbeneghu was immediately suspended and barred from campus.\n\nIn a statement, the university said it was \"highly embarrassed\" by the allegations and pledged to do \"all that is necessary\" to investigate and combat the \"menace\" of harassment at the institution.\n\nIt also said it had closed down a staff function room known as the \"cold room\" which was identified in the film as a secretive site where students were allegedly taken.\n\nThe Foursquare church, where Dr Igbeneghu is a pastor, have also distanced themselves from him in a statement. They said the church does not condone \"heinous and unscriptural\" acts from ministers and asked him to step down.\n\nWhat else did the film show?\n\nThe full hour-long documentary also featured interactions with two lecturers at the University of Ghana.\n\nBoth of the men, Professor Ransford Gyampo and Dr Paul Kwame Butakor, have denied they were offering \"sex for grades\" in the undercover exchanges.\n\nProf Gyampo has also suggested to local media that he plans to take legal action against the BBC.\n\nImage caption Dr Igbeneghu office was photographed sealed shut on Tuesday\n\nThe University of Ghana says it will investigate those named in the report and also categorically denied protecting any staff or students who have engaged in sexual harassment.\n\nWhat has the reaction been?\n\nThe BBC expos\u00e9 has provoked a large response on social media in the two countries.\n\nMany Twitter users condemned the actions seen on the film and called for a swift response, while others shared their own alleged experiences.\n\nJournalist Kiki Mordi, who fronted the documentary, opened up about her own experience of university harassment which led her to drop out and abandon career ambitions to work in medicine.\n\nInspired by the report, other women have been sharing their experiences of alleged harassment with the BBC.\n\n\"I felt extremely threatened,\" one Nigerian graduate told BBC Newsday on Tuesday. \"Even before I got to university I heard stories about this man - I had friends who were sexually harassed by him.\"\n\nShe described feeling so intimidated by the staff member that she delayed submitting work to him.\n\n\"We are the students and we have more to lose. There is no balance of power here,\" she added.\n\nAnother woman, named Catherine, said the practice happens \"a lot\" at universities in Ghana. She told the BBC's Outside Source that she wept \"like a baby\" after being asked out by a lecturer in exchange for good grades.\n\n\"Unfortunately because there's no good systems in place, when you [make a] report they ask you for evidence and because you don't have evidence it's rubbished and you end up being victimised,\" she said.", "description": "Lagos University's Boniface Igbeneghu, who has not commented, was filmed propositioning an undercover journalist.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07q5b7n.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
