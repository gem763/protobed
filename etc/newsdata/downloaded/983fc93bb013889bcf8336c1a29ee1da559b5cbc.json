(Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)\n\nFor years, the fight over how much power the federal government should have to regulate the wetlands and tributaries that feed into the nation\u2019s largest rivers has played out across the country.\n\nIn the halls of Washington and on sprawling farms and ranches, in courtrooms and corporate boardrooms, a legal tug of war has unfolded over a 2015 rule that gave the Environmental Protection Agency much broader authority over the nation\u2019s waterways. Critics say the Obama rule gave the federal government far too much power; supporters countered it would prevent the loss of vast swaths of wetlands. Court rulings have temporarily blocked the regulation in 28 states, while keeping it in effect in 22 others.\n\nOn Thursday, the Trump administration plans to scrap the Obama-era definition of what qualifies as \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d under the Clean Water Act, returning the country to standards put in place in 1986.\n\n\u201cWhat we have today is a patchwork across the country,\u201d EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in an interview. \u201cWe need to have a uniform regulatory approach.\u201d\n\nWheeler, who said the administration will finalize a new definition for which water bodies deserve federal protection within a matter of months, said the agency is seeking to end any lingering uncertainty and return more oversight to individual states.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that we have a definition that once and for all will be the law of the land in all 50 states,\u201d Wheeler said.\n\nBut critics say the rollback will speed the conversion of wetlands and headwaters, which provide critical habitat for wildlife and support the nation\u2019s drinking water supply. Americans drained about half of the 220 million acres of wetlands in the contiguous United States between the 1780s and 1980s, most of it to expand farmland. That rate began to slow after George H.W. Bush took office, pledging to stem the tide of wetlands loss.\n\n\u201cThe administration wants to go back to an era where we are destroying wetlands heedlessly,\u201d Robert Irvin, president of American Rivers, said of President Trump\u2019s latest deregulatory effort.\n\nThe 2015 rule gave the federal government authority to oversee a wide array of lakes, streams, wetlands, storm-water controls and ditches that feed into larger waterways that are clearly protected under the 1972 Clean Water Act.\n\n\n\nSwimmers, fishermen and picnickers are seen at Sandy Point State Park in Annapolis on July 18, 2016.

Voisin/The Washington Post)\n\nDenise Stranko, federal legislative and policy manager for the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, noted that all but one of the six states in the bay\u2019s watershed, along with the District of Columbia, operate under the Obama-era standard. She added that once the administration finalizes its substitute proposal, tens of thousands of acres that connect underground or through ditches to nearby waterways will lose protection.\n\nTargeting the Obama-era regulation ranked among Trump\u2019s top priorities when he took office. In February 2017, he issued an executive order directing the EPA to review the regulation in an effort to pave the way for what Trump called \u201cthe elimination of this very destructive and horrible rule.\u201d\n\nThe Clean Water Act makes it unlawful to pollute a \u201cwater of the United States\u201d without a permit, but what constitutes such water has been the subject of lengthy litigation.\n\nIn a 2006 decision, Rapanos v. United States, the Supreme Court\u2019s four most conservative justices at the time offered a constrained view that only \u201cnavigable waters\u201d met this test. But Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who refused to join either the conservatives or the liberals, said that the government could intervene when there was a \u201csignificant nexus\u201d between large water bodies and smaller ones.\n\nTrump\u2019s executive order said federal officials should rely on the opinion of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, who argued that the law should apply only to \u201cnavigable waters.\u201d\n\nWheeler is slated to announce the final repeal of the 2015 rule at the National Association of Manufacturers, whose members had pushed to scale it back. \u201cAmerica is now one step closer to smart and balanced regulation that protects our nation\u2019s precious water resources,\u201d the group\u2019s president, Jay Timmons, said in a statement.\n\n[EPA reverses federal limits on methane, a potent greenhouse gas]\n\nThursday\u2019s move is part of a broader effort by the administration to roll back regulations affecting the private sector by the end of Trump\u2019s first term. Among the dozens already reversed: easing rules on everything from curbing methane emissions from drilling operations to holding oil and gas companies responsible for killing birds that get ensnared in their rigs\u2019 waste pits.\n\n\u201cWe will finalize all of our top priorities,\u201d Wheeler said.\n\nSeveral of the administration\u2019s early wins came through the Congressional Review Act, which allows lawmakers to nullify any rule within 60 days of enactment. The Republican-controlled Congress in 2017 was able to overturn several of President Barack Obama\u2019s last environmental acts that way, sending the bills to Trump for his signature.\n\nBut reversing older regulations, such as the Clean Water Rule, has proved more difficult. Wheeler said it was taking longer than first anticipated to finalize the administration\u2019s new standards because staffers were conducting economic and scientific research to bolster the case for shrinking the federal government\u2019s authority over wetlands and streams.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not in a rush to meet artificial deadlines,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to make sure that our regulations are grounded, that they have all the supporting information they need to be upheld by the courts.\u201d\n\nIrvin said his group was prepared to take the EPA to court over its latest rollback.\n\n\u201cClearly the administration is intent on rolling back as many protections as it can before January of 2021,\u201d he said. \u201cLike any rushed efforts, they are likely to make mistakes that will be challenged and overturned in court.\u201d\n\nSupporters of the administration, however, are eager for the change.\n\nOn a recent evening in Hugo, Minn., Fran Miron looked out over the 800-acre farm that his family has maintained for four generations and explained why he welcomes the Trump administration\u2019s latest rollback. He said the Obama rule led to widespread confusion, as well as worries about increasing costs and red tape.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, and I think it\u2019s shared by many, this was really just a power grab,\u201d said Miron, 65, whose family milks 120 cows and grows corn, soybeans and alfalfa.\n\nA former mayor of Hugo, Miron said he believes that the federal government doesn\u2019t always know what\u2019s best for a particular place.\n\n\u201cThe best decisions are made locally because the local people understand the nature of the issues,\u201d he said. \u201cThey understand the nuances of the land and our water.\u201d", "description": "Thursday\u2019s move will revert the nation to 1986 water pollution rule governing wetlands and small streams.", "authors": ["Juliet Eilperin", "Reporter Covering Domestic Policy", "National Affairs", "Brady Dennis", "Reporter Focusing On Environmental Policy", "Public Health Issues", "September At Pm", "Juliet Eilperin Is The Washington Post'S Senior National Affairs Correspondent", "Covering The Transformation Of Federal Environmental Policy.
