(AP Photo/LM Otero)\n\nMonica Blake watched closely as a Texas jury weighed the case against a white police officer charged in the fatal shooting of a black neighbor, wondering whether the panel would render a different decision than so many others in recent years.\n\nWhen Amber Guyger was convicted of murder Tuesday, Blake, a retired Nashville, Tennessee, officer, wept in disbelief.\n\n\"I'm so happy,\" said Blake, who is black. \"But of course, nobody wins.\"\n\nC.J. Lawrence, a Jackson, Mississippi-based civil rights attorney and founder of the advocacy website Black With No Chaser, said the verdict offered one clear message: \"Black people won't become criminals in their own homes.\"\n\nWhile activists and observers welcomed the rare conviction, most cautioned that the outcome was not the result of changing attitudes, but of a rare set of circumstances: an unarmed black man killed in his apartment by an off-duty white officer who said she mistakenly believed she was in her own home.\n\n\"There was just a perfect storm of behavior and situations that made the classic playbook insufficient,\" said Color of Change Executive Director Rashad Robinson. \"But I don't think any of us can take solace that the rules, whether they be written or unwritten, have changed.\"\n\nOn the night of Sept. 6, 2018, Guyger walked up to Botham Jean's fourth-floor apartment \u2014 directly above hers \u2014 and found the door unlocked. Still dressed in her uniform after a long shift, she entered and found Jean eating a bowl of ice cream in his living room. She shot the 26-year-old accountant with her service weapon.\n\nJean's death drew widespread attention both nationally and in his native St. Lucia and joined the growing list of cases fueling the Black Lives Matter Movement, which emerged after the 2014 killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.\n\nConvictions have been few in the past five years as activists and protesters have attempted to highlight such killings and push for policing reforms and more prosecutions.\n\nMoments after the verdict, African Americans took to social media and YouTube to express their surprise around a case some regarded as the epitome of how whites see black bodies as a threat. Most said they were prepared to be disappointed \u2014 again.\n\nDuring the trial, they were frustrated as Guyger's defense team attempted to portray the killer as the victim and Jean as a threat.\n\nGuyger told authorities she mistakenly thought Jean was an intruder. During the trial, she tearfully took the stand and apologized for killing him. Robinson said those optics were meant to draw sympathy from jurors.\n\n\"We have a long history in this country of white women's tears and fear being an excuse for harming and killing black people,\" he said. \"For many people watching the trial, there was a deep fear that this would be another one of those situations. All they needed was one juror.\"\n\nMonica Jones, a 34-year-old transgender woman in Phoenix, called Guyger \"a perfect victim\" who would play off whites' sympathies compared to a black man who could be vilified, even though he was sitting innocently in his apartment.\n\nUnder Texas law, Guyger's sentence could range from five years to life in prison. Robinson said the sentencing decision \"will send a message to the community about justice.\"\n\nCampaign Zero co-founder and Ferguson activist Brittany Packnett said that there are still too many people willing to excuse the officer's actions.\n\nTensions intensified Monday after jurors were told they could consider whether Guyger had a right to use deadly force under a Texas law known as the \"castle doctrine\" \u2014 even though she was not in her own home.\n\nThe law is similar to \"stand your ground\" measures that declare a person has no duty to retreat from an intruder. Prosecutor Jason Fine told jurors that the law would have empowered Jean to shoot someone barging into his apartment, but it doesn't apply \"the other way around.\"\n\nThe idea that the castle doctrine could be invoked, \"reflects the fact that we've still got progress to make,\" Packnett said.\n\nPacknett pointed out that while police kill more than 1,000 people a year, only 35 officers have been convicted in the last 14 years. The percentage of those convicted of killing black people is even smaller.\n\n\"One case does not mean the problem is solved,\" Packnett said.", "description": "Monica Blake watched closely as a Texas jury weighed the case against a white police officer charged in the fatal shooting of a black neighbor, wondering whether the panel would render a different decision than so many others in recent years.
