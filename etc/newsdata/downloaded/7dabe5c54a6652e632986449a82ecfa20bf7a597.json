I can't remember that far back.\"\n\nBut Uniqlo's Korean arm subtitled its version of the ad slightly differently, reading: \"I can't remember things that happened more than 80 years ago.\"\n\nThat would put the moment as 1939, towards the end of Japan's brutal colonial rule over the Korean peninsula, where the period is still bitterly resented, and some South Koreans reacted furiously.", "description": "Japanese retail giant Uniqlo has pulled a commercial featuring a 98-year-old US fashion figure from South Korean screens, it said on Monday (Oct 21) after it was accused of whitewashing colonial history.", "authors": ["Agence France-Presse", "Camilla Tominey"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/21/TELEMMGLPICT000212475305-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
