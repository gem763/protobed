But no one quite imagined the web of entanglements that converge today at Al Hol. The foreign women and children at the camp exist in a legal limbo, held in territory that is controlled not by a state, but by the Syrian Kurdish militia that fought alongside the American coalition against ISIS and is now seeking to build an autonomous statelet. They are there because the majority of the 54 governments they hail from refuse to take them back.\n\nAmong them are British, American, French, German and Canadian children. The vast majority are very small, under 8 years old. Two American orphans from Florida reportedly passed through the camp earlier in the year; their mother had abducted them and taken them to Syria. Before dying herself, she entrusted them to a fellow hard-core ISIS woman from Britain. Their father has heard the woman then concealed the children\u2019s identities and smuggled them out of the camp, taking them to Idlib, a province controlled by rebel groups dominated by jihadists. Hiding children and changing their names is easy in Al Hol; finding out the fates of those who\u2019ve disappeared is difficult.\n\nDetermining the precise number of children in the camp, along with their paternity and nationality, is also difficult. The camp prisoner lists are incomplete and do not align with governments\u2019 lists of their citizens; there are people in the camp who are not on any list, and people on lists who do not appear in the camp at all. Many women lack passports, which were burned or confiscated upon arrival in ISIS territory. Some are claiming paternity of children whose parents have died, to maximize their own chances of repatriation; in this, they have been given hope by Syrian Kurdish authorities, who have refused to separate mothers, those claiming to be mothers, and children. Others, like the British woman who kidnapped the two American orphans and took them to Idlib, are claiming children who are not theirs because they view them as the next generation of jihadists, who must not be returned to the \u201cLand of Unbelief.\u201d\n\nThough their mothers are confined to a guarded annex and only allowed out under armed guard, the foreign children roam freely across the camp. There is no school and nowhere for them to play, so they pass the time by tormenting each other.", "description": "What does citizenship mean when thousands of American, French and British children have been abandoned to their fates in the desert?", "authors": ["Azadeh Moaveni"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/05/opinion/05moaveni-slide-T37S/05moaveni-slide-T37S-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
