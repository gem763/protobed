They say I am so powerful that with an iPhone from Brussels I could lead the protests,\" he said, holding up his mobile telephone.\n\n\"People couldn't take it anymore, that's the reality,\" he said, referring to the belt-tightening economic measures.\n\nMaduro has yet to respond to the accusation of Venezuelan involvement in Ecuador.\n\nWith protesters swarming around Quito, various government buildings were attacked overnight, authorities said.
