It\u2019s a lot,\u201d Woods said. \u201cI\u2019ve been able to be consistent most of my career. \u2026 Today was one of those days where I was able to pull it out.\u201d\n\nWoods had arthroscopic surgery on his left knee two months ago \u2014 his fifth on the same problem joint. He was making his first start in his 23rd season on the PGA Tour.\n\n\u201cI can still manage my way around the golf course,\u201d Woods said. \u201cI know how to play. I was able to do that this week.\u201d\n\nThe fourth round was suspended because of darkness Sunday, and Woods took a three-stroke lead over Matsuyama into Monday in the first official PGA Tour event in Japan.\n\nHe bogeyed his first hole of the day, the par-4 12th, but was solid the rest of the way with birdies on Nos. 14 and 18 to finish at 19-under 261. Matsuyama also closed with a 67\n\nRory McIlroy, the highest ranked player in the field, completed his round with two birdies for a 67 to tie for third at 13 under with Sungjae Im. Im had a 65.\n\nWoods opened with consecutive 64s, with a day off in between because of rain. He had a 66 on Sunday in the third round.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long week,\u201d Woods said. \u201cFive days at the top of the leaderboard is a long time.\u201d\n\nAs the U.S. Presidents Cup captain, Woods was asked about picking himself for the team.\n\n\u201cI think the player got the captain\u2019s attention,\u201d Woods said.\n\nWoods\u2019 approach shot on the 12th found the greenside bunker. He blasted out and left himself a long par putt that he missed for bogey, cutting the lead to two strokes.\n\nBut that was the only time he would falter.\n\nMatsuyama missed a short birdie putt on the par-5 14th with a chance to cut the lead to a stroke. Woods, playing in the group behind Matsuyama, made a birdie putt on 14 to restore the three-stroke lead.\n\nMatsuyama cut the lead to two with a birdie on par-3 16th. On 18, his drive went into the bunker at the side of the fairway, and he hit into the greenside bunker before saving par.\n\nWoods\u2019 approach at the par-5 18th found the greenside bunker. He blasted to 10 feet and made the birdie putt.\n\nWoods last played in an official tournament in Japan in 2006 at the Dunlop Phoenix, where he lost in a playoff to Padraig Harrington. He won the Dunlop Phoenix the two previous years\n\nIt was a wild debut for the PGA in Japan. Torrential rain washed out play Friday, forcing the second round to be moved to Saturday. To make up for the lost day, the players started the fourth round immediately after finishing the third to get in as many holes as possible.\n\nThe course took on over 8 inches of rain Friday and was in remarkably good shape when play resumed on Saturday for the second round.\n\nWoods got in 11 holes and played 29 holes Sunday before having to come back for a 7:30 a.m. start.\n\n\u201cThis was certainly demanding,\u201d Woods said \u201cBeing in the lead for the better part of five days puts a stress on the mind, it\u2019s not easy to do\u2026it\u2019s stressful, it wears one out but somehow I was able to finish out on top and made key putts this week.\u201d\n\nOn tying Snead\u2019s record, Woods attributed it to consistency.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big number,\u201d Woods said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of consistency and doing it for a long period of time, Sam did it into his 50s and I\u2019m in my early to mid-40s so it\u2019s about being consistent and doing it for a very long period of time. I\u2019ve been very fortunate to have the career I\u2019ve had so far.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP golf: https://apnews.com/apf-Golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "INZAI CITY, Japan (AP) \u2014 Tiger Woods shrugged off an early bogey Monday to win the Zozo Championship and tie Sam Snead's PGA Tour record of 82 victories.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/27/c8511f_japan-golf-zozo-championship-10377-tiger-woods-united-states-poses-his-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
