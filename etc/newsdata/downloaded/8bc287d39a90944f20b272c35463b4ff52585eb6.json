Some American think tanks and researchers have tried to calculate it, as has the US Department of State, but those assessments tend to exaggerate the threat.\n\nHezbollah operates mainly by using its loose connections with low-level merchants of Syrian and Lebanese origin in the \"triple border\" region, where Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay meet. This has long been known as a lawless area, rife with organized crime and illegal trafficking activities.\n\nI would take any analysis of a sophisticated and extensive Hezbollah presence in the region with a grain of salt. It has no organized structure in South America\u2014there are no hierarchical divisions of tasks or regular meetings, for example. It often uses its contacts in the area to launder money or smuggle drugs and cigarettes, but not at a large enough scale to generate significant revenue.\n\nHistorically, South American countries have been unwilling to treat Hezbollah's irregular presence as a terrorist threat, despite US pressure to do so. With the election in recent years of right-wing leaders in the region, especially Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil and Mauricio Macri in Argentina, this is starting to change.\n\nThere are a lot of discussions about increasing military cooperation, and the US would like to see a crackdown on individuals with alleged links to Hezbollah. The Trump administration, citing its close relationship with the Israeli government, has also proposed that Israel provide training and equipment to regional governments to help them combat Hezbollah.\n\nArgentina, Paraguay, Brazil and Colombia have expressed a willingness to accept such assistance.", "description": "The US's view of Hezbollah's presence is Latin America is considered overstated, but governments there may see cooperation as a means to another end.", "authors": ["The Editors", "World Politics Review"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/586512cdee14b617038b5a0a-750-375.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
