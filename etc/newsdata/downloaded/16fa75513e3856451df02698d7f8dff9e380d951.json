(Getty)\n\nA tough matchup for the Falcons in Week 8 just became a bit more challenging.\n\nAtlanta quarterback Matt Ryan has been officially ruled out for Sunday\u2019s matchup with Seattle after suffering an ankle injury last week against the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nMatt Ryan will be OUT on Sunday.\n\n\n\nWe have signed QB Danny Etling to the active roster and have released OL John Wetzel.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcdd - https://t.co/OxLHQGy46M pic.twitter.com/pAxI7YoTab \u2014 Atlanta Falcons (@AtlantaFalcons) October 26, 2019\n\nThe injury ends one of the more remarkable streaks in the league as Ryan will miss a start for the first time since 2009. Ryan\u2019s 181 consecutive starts ranks fifth all-time in NFL history with a group of Hall of Famers ahead of him \u2014 Brett Favre, Philip Rivers, Eli Manning and Peyton Manning.\n\nRivers\u2019 active streak of 226 consecutive starts is still nearly 100 games away from topping Favre\u2019s 321.\n\nAt 1-6, the Falcons were already in big trouble this season and that was with Ryan playing particularly well. The 34-year-old has completed 70.9 percent of his passes through seven games, five points higher than his career average \u2014 though a few of those misses have resulted in his eight interceptions, which is already more than he threw all last season.\n\nIn any case, Ryan was still finding the end zone with ease, leading the league alongside Patrick Mahomes with 15 touchdowns passes.\n\nStory continues\n\nBackup Matt Schaub, 38, will take Ryan\u2019s place on Sunday and make his first start since 2015 when he went 1-1 with the Baltimore Ravens. The former longtime Houston Texans quarterback went 6-for-6 with one touchdown and 65 yards after he replaced Ryan last week but couldn\u2019t stop the Falcons from getting rolled by the Rams.\n\nWhat\u2019s already a lost season has the potential to get much worse depending on the severity of Ryan\u2019s injury. Following Sunday\u2019s meeting with Seattle, Atlanta will face a Saints team featuring a returning Drew Brees to begin a stretch of five games against NFC South rivals. Thankfully, the Falcons have a bye in Week 9 to regroup before tackling the next phase of the schedule.\n\nDanny Etling was signed off the practice squad on Saturday to back up Schaub, with the Falcons releasing offensive lineman John Wetzel in a corresponding move.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nBlake Schuster is a writer for Yahoo Sports.
