According to a Bloomberg report the Public Investment Corporation, which holds a large amount of Eskom bonds, may get involved.\n\nEskom, which has R450 billion in debt, is a massive burden on government\u2019s financial position. The Special Paper will be announced a day before the medium-term budget policy statement, and also just before Moody\u2019s announces its latest decision on South Africa\u2019s credit rating, on Friday.\n\nRecently, President Cyril Ramaphosa told a group of investors in London that government will propose \"innovative ideas\" to deal with Eskom debt. \"I think Moody's and others will be happy with the announcements made,\" Ramaphosa said.\n\nREAD: 'I think Moody's will be happy' - Ramaphosa says plan to deal with Eskom debt imminent\n\nMoody\u2019s is the only one of the credit rating agencies that hasn\u2019t yet downgraded South Africa to junk. A \u201cjunk\u201d rating means the agency believes there's is a bigger chance that government won\u2019t be able to pay back its creditors.\n\nIf SA lost its investment rate grade from Moody\u2019s as well, it would cost the country its place in the most important group of government bonds. The Citigroup\u2019s World Government Bond Index contains only bonds that are investment grade.\n\nREAD: Investors prepare for the worst as Eskom's D-Day looms\n\nAll the many overseas investment funds that are only allowed to invest in investment grade bonds will be forced to sell their South African government bonds.\n\n\n\nBank of America previously estimated that South African bonds would be sold off to the tune of $14 billion (R200 billion). This would hike the cost of government debt \u2013 and will probably necessitate higher taxes.", "description": "Minister of Public Enterprises, Pravin Gordhan, will release government\u2019s long-awaited Special Paper on Eskom.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9263/634de4f883ab40eba2bd10522e7fe6f6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
