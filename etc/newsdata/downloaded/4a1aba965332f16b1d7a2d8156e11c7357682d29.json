Konev was twice officially recognised as a hero of the Soviet Union by Stalin.\n\nThe tarpaulin, supported by a large scaffold frame, was torn off three times after being fitted on Friday. Two men were arrested and charged with damaging the cover after they were observed leaving the scene in the early hours of Saturday morning. Czech media attributed the damage to \u201cactivists\u201d, widely believed to be pro-Russian.\n\nTemporary fencing has been installed to foil further attempts to rip off the cover. A council spokesman said it would remain at least until 12 September, when the statue\u2019s future will be discussed at a council meeting.\n\nAt the weekend, a worker re-covered the monument, located on Interbrig\u00e1dy Square \u2013 a neighbourhood that also hosts the Czech defence ministry and army headquarters \u2013 while opposing groups of activists gathered under the watch of two police officers.\n\nPetr L\u00e1z\u0148ovsk\u00fd, 48, a pro-democracy campaigner waving a large Nato flag, called the controversy an example of the \u201chybrid warfare\u201d he said Russia was waging on the Czech Republic.\n\n\u201cThe crucial point for me is that the Russian embassy, in its Facebook post, claimed it had received letters from Czech citizens wondering which side in the second world war would the Prague 6 mayor have preferred to have won,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are implying that Mayor Kol\u00e1\u0159 is pro-Nazi. This is unacceptable for me.\u201d\n\nRussian presence divides Czechs 50 years after Prague Spring Read more\n\nThe statue, which is owned by the Czech state, was commissioned during the cold war by the communist regime that then ruled the former Czechoslovakia, in recognition of Konev\u2019s supposed feat in liberating Prague from Nazi occupation in 1945 \u2013 an assertion dismissed by historians, who argue the city was already free when his forces arrived.\n\nKol\u00e1\u0159 insisted he did not dispute that Soviet forces \u201chad liberated a great part of Czechoslovakia\u201d and added: \u201cWe are grateful to those men in arms who sacrificed their lives for our freedom.\u201d\n\nRussia reacted angrily last year after the council amended the original plaque and added others citing Konev\u2019s lesser-known role in more notorious episodes \u2013 namely the suppression of the 1956 Hungarian uprising, the building of the Berlin Wall, and the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia that crushed the Prague Spring.\n\nLast month, the statue was defaced with red paint as Czechs marked the invasion\u2019s 51st anniversary, prompting Kol\u00e1\u0159 to say the council would not repair the damage.\n\nThe mayor has previously offered to give the statue to the embassy so it can be displayed on its grounds.", "description": "Monument has become focus of a row between the Czech capital and its Russian embassy", "authors": ["Robert Tait"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e9047ee9c25d1d0105531e47a38b9315eca4c4b/0_777_2674_1605/master/2674.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f4ffe28cf1f34ca2ad8173bc002dd44b"}
