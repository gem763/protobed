But it\u2019s highly unlikely that the Trump administration would prosecute the president\u2019s own lawyer.\n\nAs the House impeachment inquiry proceeds, another option to enforce subpoenas is seeking a civil judgment from a federal court, as a Congressional Research Service paper explains.\n\nIn addition to Giuliani, the White House Office of Management and Budget and the Pentagon have refused to comply with Democrats\u2019 subpoenas.\n\nThe Trump administration is objecting to the House\u2019s lack of a formal vote to begin the impeachment probe into the president. It calls the probe \u201cillegitimate.\u201d\n\nSee: White House tells House it won\u2019t cooperate with impeachment inquiry\n\nGiuliani\u2019s protests, meanwhile, don\u2019t hold water, according to Michael Gerhardt, a law-school professor at the University of North Carolina.\n\n\u201cHe has no legal basis for refusing,\u201d Gerhardt told MarketWatch.", "description": "Rudy Giuliani, President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, earlier this week defied lawmakers\u2019 subpoena for documents related to their impeachment inquiry and said,...", "authors": ["Robert Schroeder", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS341_giulia_ZG_20190930160651.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
