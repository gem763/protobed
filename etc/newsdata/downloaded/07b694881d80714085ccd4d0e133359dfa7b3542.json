It went ahead anyway, with politicians and other interested parties in attendance.\n\nBut Thursday\u2019s move represented one of Biya\u2019s largest concessions yet amid what has become a major threat to his near 40-year rule.\n\n\u201cI have ordered the discontinuance of proceedings pending before Military Tribunals against 333 persons arrested for misdemeanours, in connection with the crisis in the North-West and South-West Regions,\u201d said Biya on Twitter.\n\nAnglophone separatists, who are trying to form a breakaway state called Ambazonia in the majority French-speaking country\u2019s two minority English-speaking regions, on Thursday said that the amnesty did not go far enough.\n\nThe separatists have called for the release of what they say is 5000 people imprisoned since 2016, including 10 leaders who were sentenced in August to life in prison on terrorism charges, and the withdrawal of Cameroon\u2019s military from the North-west and South-west regions.\n\n\u201cWe will not accept an olive branch from someone whose troops are still in our territory,\u201d said Ivo Tapang, a spokesman for 13 armed groups called the Contender Forces of Ambazonia. \u201cWe will intensify our struggle with guns and bullets.\u201d\n\nThe insurgency emerged after a government crackdown on peaceful protests late in 2016 in the Northwest and Southwest regions by lawyers and teachers who complained of being marginalised by the French-speaking majority.\n\nIn the following months, protests turned violent. By 2017, newly formed armed groups were attacking army posts in the Anglophone regions. The army responded by burning down villages and shooting civilians, witnesses have told Reuters.\n\nThe oil, cocoa and timber-producing nation was among Central Africa\u2019s most stable until a few years ago. But, in addition to the separatist uprising, it also faces a insurgency by Boko Haram, a militant Islamist movement, which has spilled over from Nigeria into its northern territory.", "description": "Cameroon's President Paul Biya said he will drop charges against 333 prisoners arrested for their alleged roles in a two-year separatist uprising, but rebel leaders dismissed the move as a political stunt and pledged to keep fighting.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
