Now an activist group is taking the message further: they\u2019ll help ICE agents quit and find new jobs.\n\nSince its launch this summer, the immigrant-rights group Never Again Action has held regular protests outside Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities. There have been confrontational encounters with agents, but also conversations that left activists wondering whether ICE employees might abandon the agency.\n\nOn Monday, Never Again Action\u2019s Atlanta branch put that question to the test with a career services program for ICE agents who wanted to quit. Within 24 hours, two immigration employees had asked for help leaving their roles, the organization says.\n\nEmily Baselt, an organizer with Never Again Atlanta, began considering the program in July, after a protest outside ICE\u2019s Atlanta field office.\n\n\u201cA lot of the protesters were chanting \u2018quit your job,\u2019\u201d Baselt told The Daily Beast. \u201cI saw an interaction between one protester and a relatively young DHS [Department of Homeland Security] agent who was standing outside the building [...] The protester was asking him whether he was OK with what was happening at the border, if he was OK with kids in cages.\u201d\n\nThe agent seemed conflicted, she said. \u201cI could tell he was kind of wrestling with this a little bit.\u201d\n\nMorale in U.S. immigration agencies is reportedly low and sinking, likely a side effect of the Trump administration\u2019s aggressive policies. Though President Donald Trump signed an order purporting to end a policy of family separations at the border last year, the separations reportedly continue under a loophole. The recent deaths of at least seven children in Customs and Border Patrol centers highlighted inhumane conditions, and an August ICE raid on Mississippi chicken factories became the largest workplace mass arrest in at least a decade.\n\nIn the CBP, which is a separate agency from ICE, plunging morale has reportedly contributed to an outbreak of officer suicides.\n\n\u201cMy continuing thought has been that this level of activity combined with the disastrous policy of wholesale separating children from parents has a very negative impact on CBP personnel. They did not join to take a 2-year-old from his mother,\u201d former CBP commissioner Gil Kerlikowske told Quartz in July.\n\nBaselt said she is sure some people became ICE agents did so because they supported the agency\u2019s mission. But she wondered whether other agents were eyeing the exits.\n\n\u201cI spent a lot of time thinking about the fact that it\u2019s easy to say \u2018quit your job,\u2019 but it\u2019s not always easy to walk out like that,\u201d she said.\n\nShe and other Atlanta activists were inspired by the career services departments at universities, and wondered whether they could also provide career guidance for disillusioned ICE agents. On Monday, the Atlanta group launched a website that matches ICE agents with confidential career advisers, and held a demonstration advertising the website outside the Atlanta ICE field office. The launch date also had religious significance for Never Again Action, a Jewish-led group, since it went live the day before Yom Kippur, the Jewish day of atonement.\n\nThe launch went viral on Twitter\u2014mostly to a positive reception, although it caught some flak from the left. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a couple people criticize it, saying that if they want to quit, they should just quit,\u201d Baselt said.\n\nBut for at least two fed-up agents, the campaign was a welcome one. \u201cWithin maybe three hours of launching, we got our first request from a conscientious objector who wants help defecting,\u201d Baselt said on Tuesday.\n\nAlthough the campaign launched in Atlanta, both agents who asked for help changing careers worked elsewhere in the U.S., she added.\n\n\u201cBased on the two people who reached out to us, there are definitely people there who don\u2019t want to be there,\u201d Baselt added. \u201cThe defector who came in overnight is a Customs and Border Patrol agent who has been there for many years. The comment that person left was something like \u2018I\u2019m drowning in this place.\u2019\u201d", "description": "The organization says within hours of launching the campaign, two ICE employees asked for help getting different gigs.", "authors": ["Kelly Weill"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_3505,w_6232,x_0,y_46/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570566741/RTS2KODA_iu80j3", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
