However, the dog's condition dramatically improved and vets were able to fix his ear, which was 'hanging off'.\n\nMr and Mrs Williams said on crowd-finding website GoFundMe: \"[When we first saw the dog] he plonked himself down on the road waiting to get hit by our car.\n\n\"He was exhausted, dehydrated and had an ear infection so bad that not only was his ear hanging off, but maggots were eating away at his flesh.\n\n\"He had no mother or siblings in sight. He was all alone, terrified and ready to die.\"\n\n(Image: Solent News & Photo Agency)\n\n(Image: Solent News & Photo Agency)\n\nIt is believed the dog was abandoned by previous owners after he got ill and they could not afford the medical bills.\n\nMr and Mrs Williams are attempting to raise \u00a35,000 to pay for the dog's paperwork, flights, and certificates as it currently remains in the care of a veterinary surgeon in Bali, where it receives regular visits from the couple, who return to Britain next week.\n\nAs it is so young, a temporary foster home has been arranged until the dog is old enough to get vaccinations.\n\nThe couple have so far raised \u00a32,250, including a \u00a3600 donation from themselves, and any extra donations will go to the Balian Animal Welfare Association.\n\n(Image: Solent News & Photo Agency)\n\n(Image: Solent News & Photo Agency)\n\nThe couple have found a willing owner for Flash in one of their own employees, meaning the dog will spend a lot of time around the office.\n\nOne of Mrs Williams' three children, Becca Gouldbourne, 24, who works as an event manager at the company, said: \"I was absolutely heartbroken when they told me the story about the puppy.\n\n\"When he was first rescued he was really nervous and really shakey, but he's actually acting like a puppy now.\n\n\"We are a family of vegetarians and vegans and we are all massive animal-lovers, so there is no way we could watch this happen and not do anything about it.\n\n\"We actually have a 14-year-old blind chihuahua who we rescued in Bulgaria - she was only four-weeks-old, scared and, hungry in an overheated pet shop glass cage.\n\n\"Now we are just looking for like-minded animal-lovers to support us for that final step to get him back to his 'forever home'.\"", "description": "WARNING - UPSETTING IMAGES: Sarah-Jane Williams, 44, and her husband Simon Williams, 52, from Southampton, are attempting to raise \u00a35,000 to help get 'Flash' the puppy from Bali to the UK", "authors": ["Neil Murphy", "Image", "Family Solent News", "Solent News", "Photo Agency"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20688955.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-JS196560666.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
