Trump is a threat to American democracy that he or she published an anonymous New York Times op-ed essentially confirming that the deep state and government hacks' willfully attempt to thwart the will of the American people and block Trump's agenda on a daily basis, has announced that he or she is publishing a book titled, \"A Warning.\"\n\nThe announcement came on Tuesday afternoon via CNN. The book will be released on November 9.\n\nThe author will remain anonymous, and sources familiar with the book tell CNN that \"elaborate precautions have been taken to protect the author's identity.\" The sources say that the publisher and the author's literary agents at Javelin were provided verification that the author is the same person who penned the Times op-ed, titled \"I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration,\" on September, 5, 2018. A draft press release from the publisher obtained by CNN describes the book as \"picking up from where those first words of warning left off, this explosive book offers a shocking, first-hand account of President Trump and his record.\"\n\nThe author claims he is not doing this for the money.\n\n\"The Author of A WARNING refused the chance at a seven figure advance and intends to donate a substantial amount of any royalties to the White House Correspondents Association and other organizations that fight for a free press that seeks the truth,\" Javelin founder Matt Latimer told CNN. The book \"was not written by the author lightly, or for the purpose of financial enrichment. It has been written as an act of conscience and of duty.\"\n\nAccordingly, the author of the book says that his only intent is to dissuade the American people to not re-elect Trump.\n\nIf I were a betting man, I'd venture to guess that an anonymous book from a federal government staffer who details how he prevents a duly elected-president from fighting on behalf of the American people, and how that unelected staffer blocks a leader who campaigned on the idea that the swamp of D.C. needed to be drained of unelected bureaucrats, is perhaps the worst way to convince the American people that President Trump is bad for the country.\n\nOne would point out, that if he really did not care about making money, he could simply release the content of the book online for free.", "description": ".10/22/2019 16:40:11PM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Guy Benson", "Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/290/8a1a828f-d423-4180-b902-dc6f42b384ff.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
