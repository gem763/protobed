Still, analysts don\u2019t see China\u2019s gas and LNG demand starting to fall in the coming years and decades.\n\nDemand for natural gas in China will continue to grow in the coming years as Beijing favors increased use of cleaner-burning natural gas to clamp down on stifling pollution levels. Even at its slower pace, LNG import growth could help China outstrip Japan to become the world\u2019s top LNG importer as soon as in 2022. While analysts see no end to LNG import growth in the foreseeable future, experts and the Chinese government itself admit that growth it set to slow over the coming years, with a first such slowdown as early as this year.\n\nThe slowing economic growth in China is taking a toll on gas demand growth. The Chinese government has recently admitted that this year\u2019s gas demand growth would slow down from last year\u2019s growth pace\u2014to 10 percent from 17.5-percent growth in 2018. State-run Sinopec Gas Company chimed in with a similar forecast last week, saying that demand for natural gas is forecast to rise by 10 percent this year, at a slower growth rate than in previous years, due to slowing economic growth.\n\nSlowing growth pace, trade disputes undermining investor confidence and industrial output, and China\u2019s pragmatic policy position to manage the pace of coal-to-gas switching inevitably led to a slower rate of Chinese gas demand growth, Gavin Thompson, Vice Chairman, Energy \u2013 Asia Pacific at Wood Mackenzie, said earlier this month.\n\nAlso on rt.com Energy supernetwork: Putin approves Russia\u2019s new gas pipeline megaproject to China via Mongolia\n\nChinese gas demand is set to grow by 9 percent annually this year\u2014\u201chardly a poor performance, but not matching the 17 percent increase seen in 2018,\u201d Thompson said, but noted that he disagrees with commentators who have started talking about cracks emerging in China\u2019s LNG demand. China will continue with the coal-to-gas switching to reduce air pollution, but it will also look to avoid LNG price spikes seen in the winters of 2017 and 2018, said Thompson, who remains optimistic about China\u2019s natural gas and LNG demand growth in the long term.\n\nCommenting on the impact of more pipeline gas to China, Miaoru Huang, Senior Consulting Manager \u2013 China, APAC Gas and LNG at WoodMac, said last month:\n\n\u201cDespite higher flows of pipeline imports, LNG will be crucial to meeting China\u2019s gasification ambitions. LNG is more flexible than piped imports to counter demand and production uncertainty.\u201d\n\nThis article was originally published on Oilprice.com", "description": "The Russian pipeline that could derail China's LNG boom", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5daeb80385f54017363c643e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
