(Kimimasa Mayama/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nA Japanese court on Thursday found three former executives of Tokyo Electric Power Co. not guilty of professional negligence over the 2011 tsunami-induced reactor meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.\n\nFormer Tepco chairman Tsunehisa Katsumata, 79, and two former colleagues had been accused of failing to take adequate precautions to safeguard the plant against the magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami that struck the region on March 11, 2011. The disaster crippled the plant and resulted in the spread of radioactive contamination across a swath of northern Japan.\n\nThe trial at Tokyo\u2019s District Court marked the only criminal proceedings resulting from the nuclear explosions and meltdown that forced the evacuation of more than 165,000 people. Tens of thousands are still prevented from returning due to lingering contamination.\n\nThe court also found the trio not guilty of causing the deaths of 44 elderly patients who were forcibly evacuated from local hospitals.\n\n[Near site of Fukushima nuclear disaster, a shattered town and scattered lives]\n\nScientists had warned in advance that there was a significant risk of an earthquake and tsunami along Japan\u2019s northeast coast, putting the plant at risk, but the three men argued they couldn\u2019t have predicted a massive tsunami. Japan\u2019s government shut down the country\u2019s nuclear reactors following the disaster and imposed new safety rules, but in recent years Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has reopened some plants and pushed to restart more, partly to reduce Japan\u2019s reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nThere was anger at the verdict outside the courtroom, where former residents of the area and activists had gathered.\n\nGreenpeace condemned the court\u2019s decision, arguing Japan\u2019s legal system had failed to stand up for the rights of people affected by the meltdown.\n\n\n\nAn abandoned restaurant in Okuma town, Fukushima prefecture, on Jan. 24, 2019.

(Shiho Fukada/For The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cA guilty verdict would have been a devastating blow not just to Tepco but the Abe government and the Japanese nuclear industry. It is therefore perhaps not a surprise that the court has failed to rule based on the evidence,\u201d said Shaun Burnie, senior nuclear specialist at Greenpeace, in a statement. \u201cMore than eight years after the start of this catastrophe, Tepco and the government are still avoiding being held to full account for their decades of ignoring the science of nuclear risks.\u201d\n\n[Eight years after Fukushima meltdown, the land is recovering, but public trust is not]\n\nThe court heard evidence that Tepco executives ignored warnings that the Fukushima Daiichi plant might be susceptible to earthquake and tsunami danger and failed to invest in measures that might have prevented the catastrophe, such as raising the height of the sea wall protecting the plant and installing additional emergency generators, delaying action for cost reasons.\n\nThe power utility was warned that there was a 20 percent chance that an earthquake greater than magnitude-8 would trigger a tsunami higher than the sea wall that shielded the plant.\n\nThe tsunami that followed the earthquake flooded the plant and knocked out the electric power that cooled the reactors, causing multiple explosions and reactor meltdowns.\n\nRead more\n\nNear site of Fukushima nuclear disaster, a shattered town and scattered lives\n\nEight years after Fukushima\u2019s meltdown, the land is recovering, but public trust is not\n\nRadioactive sushi: Japan-South Korea spat extends to Olympic cuisine\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Three former Tepco executives had been accused of ignoring warnings and failing to take preventive measures to protect the plant from a tsunami.", "authors": ["Simon Denyer", "Tokyo Bureau Chief Covering Japan", "North Korea", "South Korea.", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/WxilgsqnAq15iDFp3LtXhEIjnT0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WPVOVVG2QYI6TJUIGA3JH62LBM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
