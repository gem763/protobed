I\u2019ve been doing this for 30-odd years. I knew I was coming to the end of the deal, but I was going to go out on my terms. That\u2019s not happening now.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\u201cBottom line, they fired me.\u201d\n\nMcCord, who began his CBS career at the 1986 Memorial Tournament, had an inkling what was coming after learning close friend and colleague Peter Kostis, who has been with CBS since 1992, was informed last Wednesday that his option was not being picked up, either. \u201cI looked at my phone, and I had a message from a 212 area code Wednesday night and thought, Uh oh,\u201d said McCord, who got the news from McManus on Thursday.\n\n\u201cHe [McManus] tells me, and he told Peter the same thing, that \u2018We think CBS golf is getting a little stale, and we need to go in another direction,\u2019 \u201d McCord told Golf Digest by phone from his home in Scottsdale. \u201cI\u2019ve been called a lot of things, but one thing I\u2019ve never been called is stale.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Gary McCord, Peter Kostis are no long part of CBS' golf team\n\nStory continues\n\nRumblings picked up by Golf Digest suggest that the network is going younger by making Trevor Immelman, the 2008 Masters champion, one of the new mainstays. He is expected to be join by his brother, Mark, a former All-American golfer and currently a college coach at Columbus State, who also does broadcasting on PGA Tour Live and on SiriusXM Radio. And 1997 PGA champion Davis Love III, a close friend of golf producer Lance Barrow, also could be in the mix at select events, including the Masters, according to sources.\n\nA CBS spokesperson declined to comment on future personnel moves. Another network spokesperson said that CBS had nothing to add about the situation with McCord and Kostis beyond its initial statement issued over the weekend and that in response to McCord\u2019s statements, McManus had no comment.\n\nKnown for his irreverence that eventually got him dropped from the network\u2019s coverage of the Masters beginning in 1994, McCord said he doesn\u2019t mind getting fired, \u201cbut when you tell me I\u2019m really doing well, when you tell me, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re so good for our brand and helping our brand,\u2019 when you tell me you love everything that I\u2019ve done for the golf coverage over the years\u2014and he [McManus] said I\u2019m doing fantastic\u2014and then in the next breath, you say you\u2019re firing me? And I\u2019m thinking, OK, why are they doing this? \u201d\n\nSam Greenwood\n\nMcCord, a former PGA Tour player and winner of three PGA Tour Champions events, is smarting over the decision mostly because he didn\u2019t have a chance to personally thank all his CBS teammates behind the scenes who have supported him through the years, people who have become like family. \u201cYou just don\u2019t do something like this,\u201d he said. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t do it this way. No chance to say thanks to the viewers, to all my CBS friends? That\u2019s what you get for 35 years?\u201d\n\nA CBS spokesperson said that the two men were offered the chance to work the first two events of 2020, the Farmers Insurance Open and the Waste Management Phoenix Open but both declined. McCord and Kostis are based in Scottsdale and are partners there in the Kostis McCord Learning Center at Grayhawk Golf Club.\n\nMcCord confirmed that he declined because, he said, \u201cThe way it was presented, I felt it was more for them than for us.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Recalling that time Gary McCord was banned from broadcasting the Masters\n\nMcCord has plans for an alternate farewell, however. Just pay attention, he said, to the Waste Management in late January, where he traditionally called the action at the raucous par-3 16th hole. That\u2019s all he said.\n\nWords from the late Frank Chirkinian, the famed producer who gave McCord his shot behind a microphone, still ring in his ears. It was a warning that has come to fruition. \u201cHe told me once to not get too comfortable. He said to me with that deep voice of his, \u2018You gotta remember something\u2014this is the company that fired f---ing Walter Cronkite.\u2019 That was after they fired him, too. He was right. Wow.\u201d\n\nWATCH: GOLF DIGEST VIDEOS\n\nOriginally Appeared on Golf Digest\n\n", "description": "Gary McCord says that he was surprised by CBS' decision and disappointed with the way the network handled the situation after working there 30-plus years", "authors": ["Dave Shedloski"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/PrRmHx3B_SONzjKEJYF2Vg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD05MjUuODY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/i767yW81uSKKkN8VVPNZlQ--~B/aD0yMjA4O3c9MzA1MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/golf_digest_7/b368f663db15168ae50665019ba83c13", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
