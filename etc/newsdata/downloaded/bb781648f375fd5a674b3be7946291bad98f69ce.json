(Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\nHurricane Dorian largely spared the southeastern U.S. coast after wreaking havoc on the Bahamas. But it dealt a blow to the string of peninsulas and barrier islands that make up North Carolina\u2019s Outer Banks. The damage was most pronounced on 12-mile Ocracoke, where the seven-foot storm surge flooded homes and left hundreds of residents without power and water.\n\nThe island was under mandatory evacuation, but authorities estimate most of the roughly 1,000 residents stayed behind. Many said they wanted to be there to quickly attend to damage and their neighbors.\n\nDorian causes tsunami-like surges in Outer Banks before heading to sea\n\nThe first crews reached the island by helicopter Friday, airlifting several residents with medical problems to mainland hospitals and shelters. Emergency responders arrived Saturday in ferries filled with utility crews, fuel trucks and vans packed with supplies.\n\n\u201cWe have Army trucks going around town with men in it \u2014 this is so unusual,\u201d said Mickey Baker, a 34-year island resident who spent Saturday drying dozens of shirts from her clothing store drenched by floodwaters. \u201cUsually there\u2019s men driving around pickup trucks with surfboards, dogs and kids in the back.\u201d\n\nAuthorities said crews were going door-to-door checking on residents and offering meals and clean water. They urged those who wanted to make donations to call the Hyde County Emergency Operations Center.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D) said many Ocracoke residents are still in a state of shock at how quickly the water inundated the island, flooding areas that no one could remember having flooded before.\n\n\u201cWe know how beautiful a place it can be and how it can become a part of your soul, so talking to a person who has lived in a home for 35 years who told me, \u2018I\u2019ve lost everything\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s tough,\u201d Cooper said at a news conference after he visited the island. \u201cBut then he said, \u2018I\u2019m so glad to be alive.\u2019 \u201d\n\nNOAA\u2019s support of Trump over scientists prompts uproar\n\nAt least 10 Ocracoke residents left Saturday for the mainland by boat, according to a spokesman for the ferry system. But most stayed behind to start what will surely be a lengthy cleanup effort after the worst storm in decades.\n\nThe island\u2019s only town converted its fire station into a makeshift emergency center, where volunteers distributed crackers, bananas and toiletries. Standing water reeked of fuel, sewage and mud. Uprooted cedar trees and debris littered the roads.\n\nIn a Facebook message, Ann Warner, who works at an island pub, said her house was surrounded by \u201cdoors, decks, piles of different sizes and shapes of wood, chairs, boogie boards, planters, signs, fish, mass quantities of seaweed, just about anything that was swept away.\u201d\n\nMany of the island\u2019s cars were destroyed, making the recovery extra challenging.\n\nCharles Temple, an English teacher at the island school, which also flooded, said he and his fiancee lost their cars to the flood. Now he\u2019s trying to figure out how to relocate two cats, two dogs, a portable fridge and a generator to a temporary home nearby, and made a plea for those who wanted to help to lend their pickup trucks when the island reopens.\n\n\u201cImagine trying to take something, but you don\u2019t have a car and your neighbor doesn\u2019t have a car and the people who do have cars are getting pulled six ways to Sunday,\u201d Temple, 46, said.\n\n\u2018Basically just a sand bar\u2019: Why the Outer Banks are especially vulnerable\n\nJerry Jennings, the region\u2019s chief engineer with the North Carolina Department of Transportation, said that crews are working to clear mounds of sand off washed-out sections of Highway 12, which runs the length of the Outer Banks.\n\nResidents who evacuated before Dorian were not allowed to return to Ocracoke and the southern reaches of Hatteras Island on Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe causeway leading onto Hatteras Island was lined with debris, piles of spartina grass and lines of utility trucks where crews are replacing the tilted, wrecked electricity line that left this island in the heat and dark.\n\nResidents trying to return to the southern, most damaged end of the island were turned away at a checkpoint by federal officials only allowing repair vehicles to pass.\n\nGeorge and Judy Basnett, longtime residents of hard-hit Buxton on Hatteras, left shortly before Dorian hit. They said neighbors told them their house sitting up 15 feet fared better than most in the neighborhood, but they wanted to get back before any wind or water damage could morph into mold.\n\nIt\u2019s one reason people don\u2019t leave, Judy Basnett said. \u201cIf you\u2019re there, then you can deal with a minor problem before it turns into a major problem,\u201d she said.\n\nThis is the first time the Basnetts decided to evacuate. They drove up the coast to ride out the storm with their children and grandchildren and plan to head back as soon as they can. As they sit in the sun and wait, they\u2019re convinced that wasn\u2019t the right call.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been through a lot worse hurricanes than that,\u201d George Basnett said. \u201cKnowing what I know now, I\u2019ll never leave that place again.\u201d\n\nRoss, a freelance journalist, reported from Hatteras Island, N.C.", "description": "Ocracoke Island in North Carolina\u2019s Outer Banks suffered its worst flooding in recent memory.", "authors": ["Fenit Nirappil", "Reporter Covering D.C.
