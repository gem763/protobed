It brought the total to $9.2 billion, though Boeing cited a boost in Q3 from higher defense and services revenue that helped offset losses from its flagship plane.\n\nThe company insisted that its base-case scenario involves getting the 737 Max back in the air sometime before year\u2019s end \u2014 even as it saw the departure of a high-ranking executive this week amid more questions about whether Boeing misled regulators about the plane\u2019s woes.\n\nAerial photos showing Boeing 737 Max airplanes parked at Boeing Field in Seattle, Washington, U.S. REUTERS/Gary He More\n\n\u201cOur top priority remains the safe return to service of the 737 MAX, and we\u2019re making steady progress,\u201d CEO Dennis Muilenburg said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ve also taken action to further sharpen our company\u2019s focus on product and services safety, and we continue to deliver on customer commitments and capture new opportunities with our values of safety, quality and integrity always at the forefront.\u201d\n\nUnderscoring its commitment to the embattled plane, Boeing also plans to gradually increase the 737 production rate from 42 per month to 57 per month by late 2020, it said.\n\nThe list of issues surrounding the 737 Max jets continues to grow. On Tuesday, Boeing said that it conducted more than 800 flights with updated 737 Max software, adding that it conducted a \u201cdry run\u201d of a Max certification flight test last week.\n\nHowever, Boeing also announced that Kevin McAllister, head of the jetliner division, is stepping down and will be replaced by Stan Deal, head of Boeing\u2019s global services business. Deal is someone with extensive sales and supplier-management experience and is seen as an executive that could help Boeing deal with one of the biggest crises in its more than 100 year history.\n\nMcAllister\u2019s departure is the first high-level departure since the start of the 737 Max crisis. The news comes on the heels of an announcement on October 11 that Muilenburg would be stripped of his chairman title, and a Wall Street Journal report suggested Boeing may not have been honest with regulators about the plane\u2019s troubles.\n\nThe stock, a Dow (^DJI) component, was volatile in pre-market action, falling by more than 1% before recovering. Boeing\u2019s shares may weigh on blue-chip stocks at the opening bell, given that fellow bellwether Caterpillar also missed expectations.\n\nBoeing\u2019s third-quarter results come after the industrial giant posted a larger-than-expected profit loss during the second quarter. During Q2, Boeing\u2019s commercial airplane deliveries fell 54% to 90 airplanes, down from 194 deliveries in the same period last year.\n\nA week before the company released second quarter earnings, it announced that it will be taking a $5.6 billion pre-tax, $4.9 billion post-tax, hit from the 737 MAX jet woes. The charge includes what Boeing estimates it would have to pay airline customers for groundings and delivery delays.\n\nAdditionally, Boeing also said that the cost to produce the 737 MAX jets will increase by $1.7 billion in the second quarter.\n\nIt is expected that until the 737 Max jets are able to fly again, Boeing\u2019s financial performance will continue to take a hit.\n\nWhile the main question will revolve around when the company estimates the 737 Max jet will be cleared to fly again, investors will also focus on the ballooning supply of new 737 Max planes that are being produced at a facility near Seattle. Boeing has reduced production by about 19%, but trimming production even further would seriously harm suppliers. It is estimated that about 335 brand new 737 Max planes are being stored in San Antonio.", "description": "Boeing's third-quarter results missed expectations, as fallout from the 737 Max deepens.", "authors": ["Heidi Chung"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/74LGa6PWZDnQoUeGjTOZXQ--~B/aD0zMzUyO3c9NTAyODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/66032590-f528-11e9-b7db-51b03ead40db", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
