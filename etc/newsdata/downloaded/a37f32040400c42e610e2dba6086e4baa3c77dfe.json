He has also spoken about how the peace process in Northern Ireland has been a model for other countries trying to bring divided communities together on the basis of recognising different traditions.\u2019\n\nThe Prime Minister has come under fire for dropping a planned amnesty for British soldiers from the Queen\u2019s Speech in favour of laws on \u2018sustainable cat litter\u2019.\n\nBoris Johnson had vowed to end the witch-hunt of soldiers facing historic allegations during the Northern Ireland Troubles as well as in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nYesterday, Lord Dannatt, a former Chief of the General Staff, said it was unacceptable that serving and former soldiers ran the risk of prosecution. And he said he was disappointed at reports the proposed new law had been ditched by the Government.\n\nA Whitehall source told The Daily Telegraph: \u2018You\u2019ll find more about sustainable cat litter in the Queen\u2019s Speech than you will about veterans.\u2019\n\nSenior military leaders and more than 150 MPs and peers had campaigned for the amnesty. Up to 200 former military personnel are under investigation for alleged offences during the Troubles.", "description": "Jeremy Corbyn (pictured in Northampton on Thursday) faces demands from nearly 40 victims of IRA atrocities to apologise for supporting Irish republicanism.", "authors": ["Brendan Carlin Political Correspondent For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/08/19648512-0-image-a-17_1570952769013.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
