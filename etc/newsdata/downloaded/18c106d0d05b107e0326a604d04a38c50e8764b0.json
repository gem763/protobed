A human rights monitor has claimed Turkey-backed proxy forces summarily executed nine civilians, including a female Kurdish politician.\n\nTurkey claims its objective is to sweep the Kurdish militia group leading the formerly U.S.-allied Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) \u2014which it regards as indistinguishable from the militant Turkey-based Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK)\u2014from its southern border. But U.S. lawmakers have accused Trump of leaving America\u2019s Kurdish allies to the \u201cslaughter.\u201d\n\nTrump has denied greenlighting any operation and has threatened Ankara with \u201cvery powerful\u201d sanctions. U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper told CBS\u2019 Face the Nation program on Sunday that Turkey \u201cappears to be\u201d committing war crimes, adding that all American troops would withdraw from northern Syria because of the danger of getting caught in crossfire.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Undersecretary General for Humanitarian Affairs Mark Lowcock in Gaziantep, near Turkey\u2019s southwestern border with Syria where he had been inspecting a cross border aid operation.\n\nIn an interview edited for length and clarity, Lowcock discussed how the new front in Syria\u2019s complex war is exacerbating an already dire humanitarian situation, and urged Turkey to \u201clive up to assurances\u201d made to the U.N. to protect civilians in harm\u2019s way.\n\nTIME: How many people are at risk of being displaced in northeast Syria? Where are those who have already fled going? And what is the U.N. doing to assist them as they seek safety?\n\nMark Lowcock: Our assessment, which I have corroborated with the Turks, is that there are about 800,000 people in the 32-km zone along the border. Those that are moving are mostly moving from the towns in the middle of the zone, and they are mostly moving south. They are largely going to friends and family, in many cases to Hasekah [in Syria\u2019s far northeast] and some other towns. We had already developed contingency plans to, for example, provide food for up to 650,000 people for a month or two. We\u2019ve been operating across the northeast for quite a while and we are used to situations evolving.\n\nTurkey\u2019s Foreign Minister has made assurances the operation will be restricted to the so-called safe zone. Are you confident Turkey will stick to its stated objective?\n\nWe\u2019ve listened to what Turkey has said about its intent. We\u2019ve called for restraint and de-escalation and for people to recognize Syria\u2019s territorial integrity and sovereignty, for people to comply with international humanitarian law. I have assurances from the Turkish authorities on their intention, in their words, to give maximum importance to the protection of civilians and humanitarian concerns. So, it\u2019s up to them to live up to those assurances.\n\n[On Sunday officials in Ankara signaled that Turkey\u2019s offensive may go beyond the 20-mile zone]\n\nThere are fears that ISIS prisoners and sympathizers could be freed as a result of the offensive. Are you seeing evidence of that on the ground?\n\nWe\u2019ve been concerned about residual Daesh [ISIS] elements for a while and we\u2019ve expressed concern about the position of both civilians and former fighters held in camps at the UN Security Council. Obviously, the current operation raises questions about the security of those camps, which have been essentially under the management of Kurdish authorities.\n\nOne thing we would like to see is for those countries whose nationals are for example in Al Hol [a prison camp in Northeast Syria that holds nearly 70,000 people, including thousands of ISIS family members]\u2014and the people in Al Hol are women and children, mostly under 12 years old\u2014to take responsibility for their citizens. We understand that\u2019s difficult, but the world needs to think about its legal responsibilities, its moral responsibilities and the long-term implications of leaving those people where they are.\n\n[Over the weekend, hundreds of ISIS families and supporters escaped from a holding camp in northern Syria]\n\nEven before this offensive commenced, Syria was in a dire situation. There are 1.8 million people in need of assistance and protection in northeast Syria and 2.8 million in North West. How did this perception the war is over come about?\n\nHow the perception came about, I don\u2019t know. We\u2019re seeing not just problems in the northwest and northeast, we\u2019re seeing residual problems from Daesh in various parts of the Euphrates valley, we\u2019re seeing signs of disturbances in the south. We\u2019re seeing lots of challenges.\n\nThe truth is that Syria has been less in the news in 2019 than some earlier years. For two reasons: First, existing crises\u2014Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan, northeast Nigeria\u2014are getting worse. Second, there are new crises, so the world\u2019s attention has been on some other things.\n\nThe U.N.\u2019s cross-border operations may not be renewed at the end of the year, what would that mean for the millions of people in need of humanitarian assistance?\n\nA failure to renew the mandate for the U.N. cross-border operation, which reaches all those millions of people in the northwest, would create an immense humanitarian problem. Those people are essentially entirely reliant for secure access to food, medical consumables, books that appear in schools, spare parts for water cisterns, for everything basically, on the cross-border operation. It\u2019s a very high priority to sustain that operation; it requires an agreement by the U.N. Security Council, which means nine votes in favour and no vetoes.\n\nAre you able to get aid to Syrians in areas controlled by Bashar al-Assad\u2019s government?\n\nMost people we\u2019re reaching every month are in government-controlled parts of Syria. A lot that works well but there are places under government control we\u2019d like better access to. They\u2019re especially places that have more recently come under government control, for example in northern rural Hama and Eastern Ghouta.\n\nDo you think Assad is restricting humanitarian aid in these places, to punish people who resisted the regime?\n\nIt\u2019s certainly easier for us to get to places that have been under government control for a long time. As for why it\u2019s more difficult for us to get to other places, I think is a question you need to pose in Damascus.\n\nThere are ongoing humanitarian crises in Syria, Yemen, Xinjiang, Myanmar and elsewhere. Is the international community losing its ability to check gross humanitarian abuses?\n\nThere is a paradox: for most people on the planet, life is still getting a little bit better, year-on-year. But if you\u2019re in the two percent of the world\u2019s population, 150 million that it\u2019s my job to worry about, caught up in these humanitarian crises, life is not getting better. And that number is growing. It grew by about 15% this year.\n\nWhy is that? Firstly, it\u2019s a commentary on the state of global geopolitics. Some of the issues that we\u2019re dealing with, 10 or 15 or 20 years ago would have been calmed down before they\u2019d got out of control by more effective collaboration.\n\nSecondly it is to do with the impact of climate change. A lot of the new issues that we are dealing with are droughts, like the ones in southern Africa and the horn of Africa. Or huge storms, like the Bahamas and Mozambique.\n\nSo, there are some underlying reasons why humanitarian needs are growing. They are all amenable to being addressed by human action. Human beings can deal with these problems and it will be a good idea for them to do so.\n\nWrite to Joseph Hincks at joseph.hincks@time.com.", "description": "The Turkish invasion of Syria comes at a time when the U.N. is overwhelmed by multiple humanitarian crises.", "authors": ["Joseph Hincks"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/syria-turkey-conflict-kurds.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
