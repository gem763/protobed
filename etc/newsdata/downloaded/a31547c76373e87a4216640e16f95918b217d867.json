(iStock)\n\nA family pet is being nursed back to health after it was found abandoned, malnourished and living in \u201cdeplorable\u201d conditions, which had led to disease, authorities said.\n\nAuthorities said the animal was discovered in a vacated home last month in Wilmington, a port city in North Carolina.\n\nThe pet? A freshwater fish.\n\nThe former owner, who has been identified by police as Michael Ray Hinson, was arrested Wednesday on three misdemeanor counts of animal cruelty. Hinson, who was released on a $4,000 bond, is set to appear in court Thursday, according to the New Hanover County Sheriff\u2019s Office. It\u2019s unclear whether he has an attorney in the case.\n\nAuthorities say it is thought to be the first time that animal cruelty charges have been brought in the county in a case involving a fish.\n\n[A seafood company killed a lobster \u2014 and was convicted of animal cruelty]\n\nLt. Jerry Brewer, a spokesman for the New Hanover County Sheriff\u2019s Office, said Hinson was evicted March 22 from his home in Wilmington.\n\nThree days later, deputies went to check on the home and discovered a fish tank in \u201cdeplorable\u201d condition, Brewer said. He said the oscar fish that was living inside it was not in good health; it was later determined the fish was suffering from hole-in-the-head disease, which is commonly caused by a parasite.\n\nAuthorities took the fish to the Fish Room, an aquarium in Wilmington, where employees have been treating it.\n\n\n\nMichael Ray Hinson (New Hanover County Sheriff\u2019s Office)\n\nFish Room employee Ethan Lane told NBC affiliate WECT that when this fish was brought in, \u201che was in pretty bad shape.\u201d\n\n\"Hole in the head is a parasite that starts in the intestines and works from the inside out, slowly killing the fish,\u201d he said.\n\n[Komodo Island is shutting down because people keep smuggling the dang dragons]\n\nLane told the State newspaper that the fish has since been put on a proper diet and is being treated with medication. Lane told the newspaper that the fish is suspected to have survived in its former home by eating cockroaches that fell into the tank, though police said that has not been confirmed.\n\nLane said oscar fish, which can grow longer than 12 inches and live up to 20 years, are \u201cgreat pets.\u201d He estimated that the recently rescued fish is about a year old.\n\n\u201cWe call them wet pets,\u201d the employee told WECT. \u201cThey are very trainable. They have huge personalities. Some of them can be aggressive.\u201d\n\nAuthorities did not say who would get permanent custody of the fish.\n\nRead more:\n\nA Texas man found a \u2018few\u2019 rattlesnakes under his home.
