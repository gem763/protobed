A third man, Kevin Edwards, drove Boone-Doty and Morgan to Dawes Park on the city's South Side and waited with Morgan in the SUV.\n\n\"Tyshawn brought a basketball to Dawes Park. Morgan, Doty and Edwards brought guns,\" Assistant State's Attorney Margaret Hillman said in opening statements.\n\nCook County Circuit Judge Thaddeus Wilson expressed frustration with the jury selection process, saying jurors were \u201ctrying to get off the jury.\u201d Several jurors and potential alternate jurors had expressed concerns about being away from work and family during the trial, which is expected to last four weeks, through Oct. 11.\n\nTyshawn Lee's murder horrified Chicago: Now, gang members will stand trial\n\nMoms were working to end shootings: Then they were fatally shot\n\nIn this Tuesday, Nov. 10, 2015, file photo, a mourner holds the program for the funeral of 9-year-old Tyshawn Lee at St. Sabina Church in Chicago. More\n\nTyshawn\u2019s mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, great-aunt and other family members were present in court. Tyshawn\u2019s grandmother, Teresa Wilson, 43, wore a tie-dye t-shirt featuring his fourth-grade school photo. Tears ran down her face as the prosecution proceeded with opening arguments.\n\nAfter school on Nov. 2, 2015, Tyshawn was sitting on a swing at the park down the street from his grandmother's house when a man approached him, dribbled his basketball, offered to buy him a snack and then led him to an alley, where he shot the child several times at close range, prosecutors said.\n\nThe execution-style shooting was an act of revenge, according to Hillman. Boone-Doty and Morgan, members of the same gang, believed that a rival faction had killed Morgan's 25-year-old brother and wounded his mother a month earlier.\n\n\u201cShooting Morgan\u2019s mom was beyond the pale. There weren\u2019t many rules in this feud. But family was off limits. Family was untouchable,\" Hillman said.\n\nAngered by the attack on his family, Morgan said that he \"was going to kill grandmas, mamas, kids and all,\" Hillman said.\n\nBoone-Doty initially retaliated by reportedly firing into a car occupied by a rival gang member, missing the rival but killing the 19-year-old woman who was sitting beside him, prosecutors said. Boone-Doty has pleaded not guilty in that attack.\n\nThis undated file photo provided by the Chicago Police Department shows Dwright Boone-Doty, 22.
