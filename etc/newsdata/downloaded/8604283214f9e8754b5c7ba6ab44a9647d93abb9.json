A person can only handle so much order, so much work, so much uncompromising focus. You might find yourself feeling worn out and emotionally drained. This is when Libra season arrives \u2014 lovely and social and kind \u2014 to offer some fresh air and some relief in the form of balance and beauty.\n\nWhile the sun is in Libra \u2014 from about September 23 to October 23 every year \u2014 it offers us an energy that is sociable, harmonious, and fair-minded. Libra is an air sign: communicative and charismatic. It\u2019s also suffused with the air element\u2019s focus on ideas and the mind. Instead of getting carried away by feeling or relying on intuition, justice-minded Libra is more likely to look at the world rationally, as fairly and with as little favoritism as possible.\n\nEven if you\u2019re usually a person with powerful and unshakeable opinions, in Libra season you might find yourself moved to reconsider what you had previously taken on faith. If you\u2019re a person whose judgment is often clouded by emotion, you might find yourself able to see situations with more clarity. And if you\u2019re usually a person able to leap quickly and boldly to decisions, in Libra season you might need a little more time before making a choice. Libra energy asks us to to be fair in our thinking; it asks us to look at issues from all sides and to consider all evidence before reaching conclusions.\n\nThis attitude of broad-minded openness makes Libra tactful and diplomatic. At its best, Libra is skilled at negotiation and restoring the social balance; at its worst, it can come across as wishy-washy or frustratingly noncommittal. While the Sun is in Libra, it might feel more difficult to rock the boat or make big decisions, but it\u2019ll also be easier to compromise, to forgive the people you love, and to solve problems collaboratively. Libra season can remind you to value your friendships and relationships, and it can motivate you to do the work of maintaining them. This is the time to reach out to your friends, to listen to them without judgment, to do the work \u2014 sometimes difficult, sometimes sweet \u2014 of connecting.\n\nLibra\u2019s desire for balance isn\u2019t only about fairness but also, more broadly, about harmony and beauty. Libra is ruled, after all, by Venus, the planet of beauty and love, and this influence gives Libra a natural sense for art, style, and appearance. This might manifest as a focus on personal appearance, or as a desire to be surrounded by beautiful things. It might manifest as a drive to create, to add beauty to the world.\n\nAll of these qualities combine to make Libra charming and immensely likable. Angela Lansbury\u2019s character Jessica Fletcher \u2014 liked by virtually every character she encounters in Murder, She Wrote, including the murderers themselves \u2014 embodies Lansbury\u2019s real-life Libran likability. Cher Horowitz in Clueless \u2014 as played by Alicia Silverstone, a Libra \u2014 is classically Libran too: a charismatic, if sometimes chaotic, force for social harmony, who also loves her beautiful clothes. (For that matter, Jane Austen\u2019s Emma was also played by a Libra: Gwyneth Paltrow.)\n\nBut that\u2019s not to say that Libra\u2019s energy is somehow frivolous or slight: Libra also looks like Serena Williams\u2019s continued grace and beauty (the outfits!) under nearly unbearable pressure. Nor is it to imply that the best thing you can do with Libra\u2019s energy is make yourself likable: Andrea Dworkin, whose unflinching quest for justice led to criticism from all sides, was a Libra too.\n\nAt its very best, Libra offers a surprising kind of magic, where seemingly impossible problems become solvable, not through force or cunning but through generosity of spirit, or through social connection, or through an unwavering belief that justice and beauty still matter.\n\nStay in touch.
