Members of the U.S. Congress have also voiced opposition.\n\nIn Europe, several regulators have all but ruled it out. \u201cA core element of state sovereignty is the issuance of a currency,\u201d German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said earlier this month. \u201cWe will not allow private companies to do it.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. bank executives who advise the Fed listed numerous risks of Libra and similar \u201cstablecoins,\u201d which are pegged to an underlying value such as one or more currencies. They included potential decreases in demand-deposit accounts and bank payment volumes, and a \u201cpossible challenge to the bank business model built on privacy.\u201d\n\nThe bankers also noted at the quarterly meeting that Facebook\u2019s proposal could have implications for national monetary policy, citing the \u201cpotential to reduce the ability of states to monitor, manage and influence local economies,\u201d the bankers said.\n\nThe Federal Advisory Council is a rotating group of 12 bank executives that advise Fed Board members on economic and financial topics. It was established at the suggestion of Woodrow Wilson, the U.S. president who signed the Federal Reserve Act into law in 1913.\n\nMembers this year include chief executive officers Rene Jones of M&T Bank Corp., Beth Mooney of KeyCorp, and Brian Moynihan of Bank of America Corp.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Craig Torres in Washington at ctorres3@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Margaret Collins at mcollins45@bloomberg.net, Jeff Kearns\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve asked some of the nation\u2019s biggest banks about Libra, the digital currency proposed by Facebook Inc., and the answer was simple: They don\u2019t like it.\u201cFacebook is potentially creating a digital monetary ecosystem outside of sanctioned financial markets -- or a \u2018shadow", "authors": ["Craig Torres"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
