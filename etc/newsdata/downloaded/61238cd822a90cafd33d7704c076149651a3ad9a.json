It\u2019s almost a cult worthy of Jonestown.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat Trump has done is indefensible, so it seems Mulvaney and his staff\u2019s strategy is to pretend it\u2019s normal,\u201d Whipple added. \u201cIf Trump does it, then it\u2019s fine\u2014get over it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis strategy does not serve the president well, of course.\n\n\u201cThe most important duty of the White House chief of staff is to tell the president what he does not want to hear,\u201d said Whipple. \u201cMulvaney\u2019s just thrown that to the wind and decided to be a sycophant.\u201d\n\nAt the briefing, which was ostensibly to defend Trump from accusations of self-dealing after his decision to hold the G7 at his Doral property, reporters wanted to know whether the congressionally allocated military aid to Ukraine had been held up in an effort to compel an investigation of Democrats for alleged corruption.\n\nIn the space of a few short minutes, Mulvaney admitted exactly that:\n\nMulvaney: \u201cDid [Trump] also mention to me, in the past, the corruption related to the DNC server? Absolutely. No question about that. But that\u2019s it. And that\u2019s why we held up the money\u2026. The look back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the thing that he was worried about in corruption with that nation. And that is absolutely appropriate.\u201d ABC News Correspondent Jonathan Karl: \u201cTo be clear, what you just described is a quid pro quo. It is: funding will not flow unless the investigation into the Democratic server happens as well.\u201d Mulvaney: \u201cWe do that all the time with foreign policy\u2026. This speaks to an important point\u2026. McKinney said yesterday that he was really upset with the political influence in foreign policy. That was one of the reasons he was so upset about this. And I have news for everybody: get over it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be political influence in foreign policy. \u2026That is going to happen,\u201d Mulvaney said. \u201cElections have consequences.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s small wonder that Trump\u2019s Department of Justice quickly distanced itself from Mulvaney\u2019s statement.\n\n\u201cIf the White House was withholding aid in regards to the cooperation of any investigation at the Department of Justice, that is news to us,\u201d a DOJ official told the Washington Examiner.\n\nTrump\u2019s personal attorney Jay Sekulow reacted with a one-sentence statement: \u201cThe President\u2019s legal counsel was not involved in acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney\u2019s press briefing.\u201d\n\nMulvaney spoke to reporters without having been briefed by the legal team, and based on other admissions he made, he didn\u2019t seem to have been prepped by a competent press staff either. The rumors that he\u2019s been feuding with White House counsel Pat Cipollone only bolsters the perception that the White House is completely, dangerously dysfunctional.\n\n\u201cIt was malpractice to send him out there, given his lack of experience, lack of skills and a clear lack of preparation,\u201d said Joe Lockhart, President Bill Clinton\u2019s former press secretary and no stranger to impeachment questions.\n\nThe White House press room is the \u201creddest, hottest room on Earth and you don\u2019t take that podium unless you\u2019re aware of every implication of every word, every sentence that you say,\u201d said former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.\n\nFurther compounding his media missteps, Mulvaney then went on Fox News Sunday to say he didn\u2019t say what he\u2019d said, even as the Trump campaign began selling shirts with the words \u201cget over it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAgain, that\u2019s not what I said, that\u2019s what people said I said,\u201d Mulvaney told Chris Wallace.\n\nWallace then played the tape and went back and forth with Mulvaney for several minutes.\n\n\u201cI hate to go through this but you said what you said,\u201d said Wallace. \u201cYou said what you said, and the fact is, after that exchange with Jonathan Karl, you were asked another time why the aid was held up. What was the condition for the aid? And you didn\u2019t mention two conditions, you mentioned three conditions.\u201d\n\nMulvaney also defended Trump\u2019s choice to use his own resort as the meeting place for the G7 in the worst way possible: \u201cAt the end of the day, he still considers himself to be in the hospitality business.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just have to pick up: you say he considers himself in the hospitality business?\u201d Wallace asked. \u201cHe\u2019s the president of the United States.\u201d\n\nOne of Trump\u2019s advisers called the interview \u201cself-immolation.\u201d\n\nIn reality, it is not the job of the chief of staff to appear on camera and defend the president. The most effective chiefs leave media to the press secretary and do their best to be seen and not heard. A successful chief of staff is a gatekeeper who heavily influences who the president sees, what the president reads, and what advice the president listens to.\n\nJim Baker, chief of staff to Ronald Reagan, represents the \u201cgold standard\u201d of chiefs because he was an honest broker, according to Whipple. Baker was always candid in his advice to Reagan, and he didn\u2019t care if he was hated for his pragmatism. Reagan wanted to get legislation passed, and he knew that compromise, and an empowered chief of staff, were necessary.\n\nMulvaney, on the other hand, has said that his strategy as chief is to let Trump be Trump, which \u201cis a prescription for disaster,\u201d said Whipple.\n\nWhen he took over from John Kelly, Mulvaney famously adopted a more hands-off approach than the former general, allowing easy access to the Oval Office. This lack of process is clearly a cost of having someone with no understanding of his job in the chief position.\n\n\u201cOne thing I do give him credit for, he covered himself,\u201d said Lockhart. \u201cHe was very clear that anything he did on Ukraine was at the direction of the president.\u201d\n\nWithin the White House, the cult-like delusion continues unphased by poor media performances. On Monday morning, Mulvaney received a round of applause from senior aides, according to CNN. On Tuesday night, Trump tweeted that word he was sounding out someone to replace Mulvaney was \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\nBarbara Boland is The American Conservative\u2019s foreign policy and national security reporter.
