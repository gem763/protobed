Since the themes have been very well received, Google built a new UI into Chrome to make it easier for users to apply them with just a few clicks, and without accessing the Web Store.\n\nImage:Google\n\nTab grouping and previews\n\nIn addition, the new Chrome 77 release also comes with some improvements to Chrome's tab management options.\n\nFor desktop users, the Chrome team is adding tab previews. The feature, which has been present in almost all other Chromium-based browsers, has been lacking in Chrome.\n\nOn other browsers, when users hover the mouse over a tab, they can see a preview of the tab's content. Google's live preview feature only shows the tab's title, but the company said the end goal was to added support for live image previews in the upcoming future.\n\nGoogle hopes this feature will help users find the tab they're looking for in crowded tab bars, especially when multiple tabs are opened at the same time.\n\nImage: Google\n\nOn Android, Google is rolling out a totally different feature, but one that the company has been testing since this spring. Called Tab Groups, this feature allows users to... uhm... group tabs.\n\nAfter today's update, Chrome for Android users will be able to drag tabs one on top the other on a grid-like view and organize tabs in a simpler way than before, when all tabs were bunched together in a hard to navigate vertical carousel.\n\nImage: Google\n\nThe Tab Groups feature is still in the works for desktop users, but it's definitely coming. ZDNet gave readers a first look at the Tab groups feature for desktop users in March.\n\nSince then, there have been some updates as engineers continued to work and improve it. The latest Tab Groups preview for desktop can be seen below.", "description": "Google rolls out major new UI features for Chrome users on desktop and mobile.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/19/8deab5f0-86e5-447c-8bdc-3db634cd24ff/thumbnail/770x578/f3f641d417386f682293e7d215e9eea1/chrome-ui-customizer.png", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
