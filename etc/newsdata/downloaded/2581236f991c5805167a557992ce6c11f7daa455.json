To call out abuse of power MORE, in a recent interview about his longstanding legacy with the organization.\n\nIn an interview with Yahoo Entertainment published earlier this week, Brooks said he wasn\u2019t at all surprised by Carter\u2019s sudden return to volunteering for the nonprofit shortly after the 95-year-old suffered a fall that left him with a black eye on Sunday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCarter, the longest-living U.S. president, had stunned many on Monday after footage emerged showing him with a drill in hand on a building site in Nashville, while also donning white bandage on his head and bruise over his left eye. Carter, who had fallen in his home in Plains, Ga., the day before, required stitches above his brow after the fall.\n\n\u201cYou don't expect anything different from the man,\u201d Brooks told the publication.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just one of those guys, and Ms. Rosalynn's the same way. They're just those people that you just have to be around to actually believe it,\u201d he added, referring to Carter's wife, former first lady Rosalynn Carter.\n\nHe then went on to say that he believed Carter and his wife stand for \u201cwhat we should all shoot for as human beings.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease forget \u2018Republican\u2019 or \u2018Democrat.\u2019 What they are standing for is as human beings,\u201d Brooks said.\n\n\u201cIf we're going to get anywhere as a human race, this is the path we want to follow. So anything keeping any kind of light on that path and those two people's dreams, then count us in. You've got to understand that when you get to heaven, nobody cares about \u2018Republican\u2019 or \u2018Democrat\u2019 in heaven at all.\u201d\n\nBrooks, who has worked alongside Carter on a number of Habitat for Humanity over the years, also spoke to about the former president\u2019s work ethic, telling the publication Carter is \u201cgoing to outwork you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm not being modest here, trust me. I'm not being humble. I'm being honest. He's going to outwork you every time he comes on the job site,\u201d he continued.\n\nHe then recalled a past building project he volunteered on with Carter in Haiti.\n\n\"We were down in Haiti, it's a hundred and I don't know, it's boiling down there, and the roofs are metal. So they're working on them, I'm working on the metal roof, and I've been up there for hours, so I finally get the roof on. And the great thing about getting the roof on is now you've got some shade,\u201d Brooks said.\n\n\u201cAnd I went down there and took my hat off, and stood in the shade, and I wasn't there two seconds when Jimmy comes walking in. And he goes, \u2018Need something to do, Garth?\u2019 I'm like, \u2018Dang it!\u2019 So you'd never want him to catch you ever trying to get a breath, because you can't outwork him,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cI can't imagine living in a house that you can tell your children, the president and the first lady did that, right there, in our house,\u201d Brooks added. \u201cThat's just so cool.\u201d", "description": "Garth Brooks\u00a0offered praise for his fellow Habitat for Humanity volunteer, former President Jimmy Carter, in a recent interview\u00a0about\u00a0his longstanding legacy with the organization.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/garth_brooks_jimmy_carter_habitat_for_humanity.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
