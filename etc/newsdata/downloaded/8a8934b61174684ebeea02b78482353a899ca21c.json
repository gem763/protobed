In \u201c1984,\u201d history has been obliterated. In \u201cFahrenheit 451,\u201d all books are banned, while in \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d reading is illegal for (most) women. The regimes in these books are smothering and all-encompassing, but facts could, at least theoretically, endanger them.\n\nFor a long time, the notion that truth threatens totalitarianism was taken for granted. In the Soviet Union, the regime jammed foreign radio broadcasts, and people risked prison to pass around forbidden books. \u201cLiving within the lie can constitute the system only if it is universal,\u201d wrote Vaclav Havel in 1978, a decade before he became the first post-Communist president of what was then Czechoslovakia. He continued: \u201cThere are no terms whatsoever on which it can coexist with living within the truth, and therefore everyone who steps out of line denies it in principle and threatens it in its entirety.\u201d\n\nThis is the case in Gilead, and it\u2019s what gives words their salvific potential. The heroine of \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d describes herself as \u201cravenous for news,\u201d and is sustained by the mock Latin phrase \u201cNolite te bastardes carborundorum,\u201d which translates to \u201cDon\u2019t let the bastards grind you down.\u201d It is scratched, presumably by one of her predecessors, on the floor of the closet in the room where she sleeps. (This phrase has since become totemic, reproduced on T-shirts and in tattoos, necklaces and needlepoint.)\n\nWords are even more important in \u201cThe Testaments.\u201d (If you don\u2019t want spoilers, you should stop reading now.) One of the book\u2019s great surprises is that the seemingly fanatical Aunt Lydia is actually Part of the Resistance Inside the Gilead Administration, and she does a better job of it than the anonymous Trump official who wrote the New York Times Op-Ed essay. An opportunist rather than a true believer, she joined the new regime to avoid being killed by it, and though she\u2019s complicit in its crimes, she helps take it down by publishing its secrets.\n\nLike \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d \u201cThe Testaments\u201d has a coda set far in the future, at a Gileadean studies academic symposium. The information released by Aunt Lydia, a scholar says, \u201ctouched off the so-called Ba\u2019al Purge that thinned the ranks of the elite class, weakened the regime, and instigated a military putsch as well as a popular revolt.\u201d It\u2019s this that makes \u201cThe Testaments\u201d feel so optimistic. Imagine: a world where exposing the misdeeds of a regime could unravel it!\n\nThat\u2019s been a constant hope of the Trump years. Those who abhor him have dreamed of seeing his depravity and corruption proven in a way that can\u2019t be denied, whether with the fabled pee tape, the Mueller report or rumored outtakes from \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d where he\u2019s said to spout racial slurs. Yet again and again, Trump\u2019s depravity and corruption are proven in a way that can\u2019t be denied, and it doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nWe\u2019ve all heard him boasting of sexual assault on tape. The Mueller report found that the Trump campaign \u201cexpected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts.\u201d A Times investigation documented abundant evidence of tax fraud by Trump, and showed that he owes much of his wealth to his father. Prosecutors said he directed hush money payments to a pornographic film actress and a former Playboy model, campaign finance crimes that helped land his former attorney in prison. You don\u2019t need a secret recording to prove the president is a racist; the evidence is on Twitter.", "description": "In the sequel to \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d the truth saves.
