Like millions of other people, I use it to write, edit, collaborate, and to archive my documents.\n\nThere\u2019s no arguing on the convenience that Google Docs provides, whether you\u2019re a professional writer, an account manager, an academic researcher, or just a random person taking inventory of your thoughts.\n\nBut like every other piece of useful technology, Google Docs can cause unwanted security and privacy problems. The convenience of Google Docs often leads users to let their guard down and ignore security issues. If you\u2019re using Google Docs to store business secrets, the next best-selling novel, or a future award-winning research paper, here are some tips that will make sure your documents are secure.\n\nA few notes on Google Docs security\n\nBefore we delve into our Google Docs security tips, some clarification is necessary. In this piece I\u2019ll be discussing ways to protect your Google Docs against unauthorized access.\n\nWe\u2019re not going to be discussing Google scanning your documents and mining your data to train its artificial intelligence algorithms or serve personalized ads. I suppose you already know that when you\u2019re not paying, you\u2019re the product.\n\nNeither is this a rant about Google sharing your data with government agencies. That too is an issue for a separate post on digital rights and privacy regulation.\n\nAnd finally, I\u2019m not going to discuss security incidents and data breaches at Google\u2019s data centers. Those are genuine concerns, but in my experience, Google has some of the strongest security practices. Most security incidents regarding Google Docs happen because of user negligence and misusing Google\u2019s own security features.\n\nIf you want to evade corporate or government snooping and surveillance, read our post on encrypting your entire life. If you\u2019re interested in keeping your Google Docs secure, read on.\n\nNote: All the tips in this post also apply to Google Sheets and Slides.\n\nDon\u2019t use Google Docs link sharing unless you absolutely must\n\nOne of the greatest features of Google Docs is to share them with colleagues and collaborate on them. Google supports two sharing modes: link sharing and individual sharing.\n\nIndividual sharing requires you to explicitly give access to each user who should have access to the document. When you turn on link sharing, anyone who has the link to your Google Doc will be able to access it.\n\nAs we\u2019ve previously seen in these pages, Google Docs link sharing is a privacy disaster. Even if you\u2019re careful to only share the link to the document with relevant people, there are several ways that uninvited people can get access to your Google Doc. For instance, when you click on a link in the text of the Google Doc, the analytics system of the website you\u2019re redirected to will register your document\u2019s URL. The owner will then be able to open your Google Doc.\n\nBad use of Google Docs link sharing is a perfect example of \u201csecurity through obscurity\u201d gone wrong.\n\nIn many cases, users turn on link sharing because the people they want to work with don\u2019t have a Google Account. In explicit sharing mode, Google Docs requires each user who wants to access a document to have a Google Account.\n\nWhen you turn on link sharing in Google Docs, anyone with the URL of your document can access it\u2014a very bad security practice!\n\nIn this case, I still believe the security tradeoff of turning on Google Docs link sharing is not worth the convenience of quickly making it available to a colleague. Fortunately, Google doesn\u2019t require you to have Gmail or G Suite to have a Google Account. Anyone can create one with their existing personal or corporate email in a few easy steps.\n\nIn case your colleague(s) can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to create a Google Account to access your Google Doc, I suggest downloading it as a Microsoft Word (.docx) document and sending it to them as an email attachment. It will deprive you of the possibility to collaborate on the document, but it will make sure your Google Docs are secure against unauthorized access.\n\nSo why does Google Docs have link sharing? I personally find very few cases where I want to turn on link sharing. But in the cases where you have a public document such as a press release or announcement, then using link sharing is justified. But even for such cases, there\u2019s usually a better place to publish the document, such as your company\u2019s website.\n\nBottom line: Google Docs link sharing is very insecure! Use it sparingly, if ever.\n\nUse Google Groups if you want to mass share\n\nUsers sometimes tell me that they turn on link-sharing when they must share several Google Docs with many people, even if it contains confidential and private information. Their excuse to compromise the security of their documents is that there\u2019s no efficient way to share the document with so many people. This is especially true for freelancers and people who don\u2019t have a corporate domain and don\u2019t have G Suite or other tools to create corporate workgroups.\n\nGoogle, however, already has an old tool that can help you create and manage working groups. Google Groups, which launched in 2001, has lost much of its popularity in the past years. But it is still a very useful tool for collaboration using the free version of Google Docs, Drive and Google\u2019s other creativity tools.\n\nTo avoid turning on link-sharing and undermining the privacy and security of your Google Docs, you can create a Google Group and add all the people you want to collaborate with. You can have different groups for different tasks and projects. Every time you want to collaborate on a new document, instead of manually typing or copy/pasting all the email addresses of your colleagues (or turning or the security nightmare \u201clink sharing\u201d feature), just share it with the email address of the relevant group or groups. It will give access to all the people who are members of those groups without compromising the security of your Google Doc.\n\nYou can use Google Groups to share Google Docs with many people\n\nTo make sure that Google Groups don\u2019t compromise your Google Docs\u2019 security, please take the following measures:\n\nManage your Google Groups regularly. If one person is off the team, remove them from the Google Group. This will immediately revoke their access from all Google Docs shared with that group. Always make sure to keep your Google Groups up to date to avoid any old users from taking advantage of their remaining access to your Google Docs.\n\nAlso, make sure your Groups are not public, unless you explicitly intend them to be so. My personal recommendation is to set your Group\u2019s visibility to \u201cmembers only\u201d and your join policy on \u201cinvite-only.\u201d This will make sure you have full control on the security of your Google Docs and who has access to them.\n\nConfigure your Google Group\u2019s visibility and join settings to ensure the security of the Google Docs you share with the Group.\n\nGoogle Groups is a very useful tool that can reduce the overhead of managing the security of your Google Docs by giving you a central access administration center.\n\nTurn off editor sharing rights\n\nBy default, if you give a user edit rights to your Google Docs, they will be able to share the document by other users. This can set the stage for accidental (or intentional) security mishaps. The editors might end up sharing the document with people that should not have access to it.\n\nAs a best security practice of minimum rights, Google should remove this right and only enable it if a user explicitly wants to give access management rights to their editors. Fortunately, you can turn it off. You can find it in the advanced sharing settings. By enabling the \u201cPrevent editors from changing access and adding new people\u201d checkbox, you\u2019ll make sure that your editors can\u2019t give uninvited people access to your document.\n\nEnable the \u201cPrevent editors from changing access and adding new people\u201d checkbox to prevent unauthorized access to your Google Docs\n\nWhile you\u2019re at it, I also suggest enabling the \u201cDisable options to download, print and copy\u2026\u201d checkbox. While it can\u2019t prevent viewers from stealing your documents, it will certainly make it harder for them.\n\nKeep your Google Account secure\n\nOne of the key overlooked measures to protect your Google Docs is keeping your Google Account secure. An insecure Gmail that falls victim to a phishing or spear-phishing attack will immediately give hackers access to all your Google Docs. (Though honestly, if your Gmail gets hacked, you\u2019ll probably have bigger problems to worry about than Google Docs security.)\n\nChoosing a strong password for your Google Account is a good place to start to secure your Google Docs. Long and complex passwords, unique passwords and using password managers are some of the techniques that will make your account more robust against hijacking. Also, if you\u2019ll be managing your Google Docs on the go, be very careful if you decide to connect to public wi-fi networks in libraries, hotels, and cafes. Eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks might enable hackers to steal your password and gain access to your documents.\n\nMy personal recommendation is to turn on two-factor authentication and secure your account with a physical key such as YubiKey, which Google has been supporting for several years now. Having a physical security key will make sure that your Google Docs remain secure even if some hacker manages to steal your password.\n\nA secure Google Account is an inseparable part of protecting your Google Docs. Without it, none of the other steps we mentioned can protect your confidential documents from unauthorized access.\n\nThis story is republished from TechTalks, the blog that explores how technology is solving problems\u2026 and creating new ones.
