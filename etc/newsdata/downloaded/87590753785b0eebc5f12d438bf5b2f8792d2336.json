The men bring out the competitor in the other on the ice.\n\nDoughty said before Tuesday\u2019s game: \u201cI think we both know who the better player is.\u201d\n\nHe was more conciliatory in victory and downplayed the friction between the two players.\n\n\u201cYou guys make a bigger deal of it than we do,\u201d Doughty told reporters. \u201cHe\u2019s just trying to play a good game.\n\n\u201cAs much as he doesn\u2019t want to say it, he knows I\u2019m a really good player and he\u2019s trying to get me off my game. But really, he\u2019s just feeding into my game.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re both good players. We just want to win games. That\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nSaid Tkachuk: \u201cI\u2019m excited for round two in two weeks in L.A.\u201d\n\nThe Kings picked up their first win after falling 6-5 in their season opener to the host Edmonton Oilers on Saturday.\n\nTyler Toffoli had a goal and an assist, with Sean Walker and Ilya Kovalchuk also scoring for Los Angeles (1-1-0). Jack Campbell made 26 saves.\n\nNoah Hanifin also scored for Calgary (1-1-1). David Rittich turned away 36 shots.\n\nWith Rittich pulled for an extra attacker, Tkachuk\u2019s second goal of the game pulled the Flames even with 64 seconds remaining. The winger tipped the puck in the air on a rebound and batted it by Campbell.\n\nThe Kings took a man advantage into overtime with Calgary\u2019s Sam Bennett serving a tripping minor.\n\nCalgary trailed 3-0 midway through the second period when Tkachuk and Backlund scored within a three-minute span.\n\nCampbell squeezed his pads too late on Hanifin\u2019s backhand at 13:33 to pull the hosts within a goal.\n\nTkachuk scored off a broken play in the offensive zone, beating Campbell low stick side at 10:51 of the second period.\n\nKovalchuk batted a rebound in the air by Rittich at 3:46 of the second period. The Kings\u2018 third goal was allowed to stand upon review.\n\nFlames forward Milan Lucic and Kings defenseman Kurtis MacDermid fought after Kovalchuk\u2019s goal.\n\nThe flat-footed Flames were outshot 20-3 in the opening period and failed to register a shot on net during a first-period power play.\n\nWalker\u2019s sharp-angled wrister from the boards fooled Rittich at 17:26.\n\nA scramble for a rebound from Doughty\u2019s shot squirted out to Toffoli, who beat Rittich glove side at 2:53.\n\nFans in the Saddledome booed Doughty whenever he had the puck.\n\nThe Flames gave their fans little to cheer about for half a game until Tkachuk\u2019s goal sparked the home club.\n\n\u201cThe personal rivalry between the two \u2026 the intensity that both of them bring, when you buy a ticket you\u2019re going to watch those two closely,\u201d Kings coach Todd McLellan said.\n\n\u201cNobody went home disappointed I\u2019m sure with Tkachuk\u2019s or Doughty\u2019s performances tonight.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Drew Doughty and Matthew Tkachuk lived up to the hype around their rivalry.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/09/kings_flames_hockey_98820_c0-164-4000-2496_s1770x1032.jpg?79dd707ce56e6e06d318a80b646dc306472c34bf", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
