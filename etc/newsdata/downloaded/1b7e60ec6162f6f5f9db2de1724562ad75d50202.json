At the Ideas Festival, my handlers created an internal schedule for me, shuttling me from the head of one initiative to the head of another. The institute was building high schools, educating the underprivileged, creating cultural dialogue across continents. The $US10,000 passes to the festival had paid for dozens of underprivileged youths \u2013 who comprised most of the racial diversity there \u2013 to travel to Aspen. These kids had been given the gift of \u201caccess\u201d, I was told. They were lucky to have the \u201cAspen experience\u201d. Did I have any questions?\n\nThe idea for the Aspen Institute first emerged after the second world war. In 1949 Walter Paepcke, a Chicago businessman, planned a bicentennial celebration of the life of German writer and statesman Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Paepcke and his wife, Elizabeth, chose Aspen because it was both beautiful and easily accessible from either coast. The couple felt there was an \u201curgent need\u201d to understand Goethe\u2019s thought: the world, still recovering from the war, had been cleft by the ideological battle between communism and capitalism.\n\nThe Paepckes saw Goethe as a prime advocate of the underlying unity of mankind. He also worried about the corrosive effects of rapidly proliferating wealth. The Paepckes imagined that Aspen could become an \u201cAmerican Athens\u201d, educating an upper-crust elite hungry for spiritual sustenance in the newly ascendant nation. Such work was vital \u201cif the people of America and other nations are to strengthen their will for decency, ethical conduct and morality in a modern world\u201d. Herbert Hoover, the former president, was named honorary chairman; Thomas Mann joined the board of directors.\n\nIn 1950 the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies was founded as a place of moral instruction for the \u201cpower elite\u201d. The Paepckes didn\u2019t want their creation to be merely a think-tank dedicated to policymakers. Nor were they interested in emulating business schools. They wanted to shape leaders, not merely improve managers. Back then, Aspen\u2019s version of inclusivity meant inviting the men in suits.\n\nThe new curriculum was modelled on what was known as the \u201cFat Man\u2019s Great Books Class\u201d, which Mortimer Adler, a philosopher who co-founded the Aspen Institute, had run in wartime Chicago exclusively for executives. The idea was that if thinkers and businessmen were forced into the same room they\u2019d be cured of their mutual suspicion and \u201cjoin together to supplant the vulgarity and aimlessness of American life\u201d. Through encounters with the classics, executives would learn to restrain the worst excesses of capitalism and politicians would be able to draw on the wisdom of the ages as they reached their decisions. The \u201cAspen method\u201d was born.\n\nAssociation with Aspen can endow you with the crispness, vitality and lucidity of the mountain air. Aspen Institute\n\nThe Aspen Institute gradually cemented its place in American political life. \u201cIf you are not a graduate of Harvard, membership in the Aspen Institute will qualify you for a place on President Kennedy\u2019s \u2018New Frontier\u2019 team,\u201d the Chicago Sun-Times quipped in 1961. The institute made a name for itself as a place where American values were defended, and where the virtues of democratic deliberation, meritocracy and leadership with moral purpose were championed. It promoted a set of attitudes that transcended party affiliations and defined the acceptable parameters of American politics: anti-communism, Atlanticism, faith in the rules-based international order and the power of capitalism to benefit all.\n\nAcolytes tend to describe the Aspen Institute and its workings in mystical terms. Porterfield, who was raised a Catholic, speaks with the zeal of a missionary about the institute he now runs: \u201cIt\u2019s possible to actually create the beloved community if people put their bodies and hearts and souls in motion for change,\u201d he told me, invoking Martin Luther King. Activities fall into three categories: leadership, policy and public events such as the Ideas Festival. Its leadership programmes include a variety of fellowships for executives and disrupters of all kinds, in politics, business, health and education. The fellowship experience revolves around the seminar room, where participants gather around in a \u201csacred circle\u201d, read classic works of literature and discuss humanity\u2019s greatest challenges.\n\nThe Prince, Thomas Hobbes' Leviathan, Ayn Rand\u2019s What is Capitalism? and Simone de Beauvoir\u2019s The Second Sex serve as leadership texts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe archetypal offering is the Aspen Executive Seminar, grandchild of the Fat Man\u2019s Great Books Class. It is \u201cthe basic genetic code that informs everything the institute does, from its leadership programmes to its policy programmes\u201d, as Walter Isaacson, a former head of the institute, put it. The experience is meant to imitate a university seminar. But instead of dwelling on scholarly niceties, discussions of Machiavelli, Hobbes, Virginia Woolf and Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar are designed to engage participants on a personal level, inviting them to reflect on the manner in which they conduct their lives.\n\nNiccolo Machiavelli's The Prince, Thomas Hobbes' Leviathan, Ayn Rand\u2019s What is Capitalism? and Simone de Beauvoir\u2019s The Second Sex serve as leadership texts. Philosophers Confucius, Amartya Sen and Jean-Jacques Rousseau are also part of the curriculum. (Aung San Suu Kyi has now been excised.) No political leader in recent memory has embodied Aspen\u2019s ethos of purposeful self-reckoning more ardently than Barack Obama. His successor, Donald Trump, is less given to introspection. That change in approach has consequences for the entire nation. How has the Aspen Institute responded? With more discussion (though it did make an effort to attract Trump supporters to the Ideas Festival to explore the future of conservatism). As the masses gather against the elite, the elite digs in.\n\nSome of my fellow-travellers told me that they went into the experience thinking that this would be a fun way to expand their networks and to learn how to sound and act like a leader. Aspen Institute\n\nFor a week in early June, the Aspen Institute allowed me to experience the Aspen method as a full participant in an executive seminar. I asked to take part after I found out that the seminar came with an intriguing, non-negotiable requirement: attendees must put on a dramatic staging of Antigone, a tragedy by Sophocles from the fifth century BC. All members must participate. The play tells the story of Creon, an uncompromising ruler, who forbids Antigone from burying her rebellious dead brother. For many, Antigone is the high point of Greek tragedy: Creon and Antigone embody the conflicting claims of public justice and private conscience.\n\nAntigone, a play that questions the right of those in power to demand unquestioning obedience, tends to be revived in uncertain political times. But in Aspen it is performed many times each year. For the inaugural performance (in 1950 or 1951, no one is quite sure), businessmen donned togas and recited the play. Since then everyone from Queen Noor of Jordan to Netflix boss Reed Hastings has performed the play, as well as a revolving door of intelligence directors, colonels and consultants. Participants are encouraged to reimagine the play, including altering the ending.\n\n\u201cOur year, I have to say, I was Antigone,\u201d Madeleine Albright, a former secretary of state who is also an Aspen trustee, told me over the phone. When she participated in the seminar, the Dalai Lama happened to be visiting Aspen, so her seminar group took a lighthearted approach and altered the play in his honour. \u201cI remember singing Hello, Dolly!\u201d Albright recalled, except her group changed the words to \u201cHello, Dalai-ah!\u201d, \u201cin honour of the Dalai-ah Lama\u201d. \u201cIt really was fun,\u201d she said. (The Dalai Lama, Albright said, has a great sense of humour.) In 2003, after leaving the State Department, she founded the Aspen Ministers Forum, which brings together senior diplomats and foreign ministers from around the world to discuss global challenges. In 2017 the group wrote to Congress urging it to keep supporting the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nA few weeks before my seminar began, I received a customised anthology, along with instructions to read each text twice before arriving. I was also to prepare to start a \u201ccollaborative journey\u201d and to \u201ctake three steps back from practical affairs\u201d. Via email, I had to respond to a questionnaire about my leadership style: where was I in my \u201cleadership journey?\u201d What was the \u201cgreatest leadership challenge\u201d at my organisation? \u201cIn one word, what is the greatest challenge facing our age?\u201d\n\nMuch of the complex that contains the Aspen Institute is, in fact, a four-star hotel called Aspen Meadows, operated by Wyndham Hotels & Resorts. (Elizabeth Paepcke reputedly remarked that it would break her heart for the Aspen Institute to be turned into a five-star hotel, so they\u2019ve had a narrow escape). I was presented with a schedule for the week and the names and biographies of my fellow leaders: the pillars of industry and culture were well represented. Among my colleagues were a Colombian oncologist, an air-force officer, a university president, a British investment manager, a cannabis executive, a social-media executive and a charter-school foundation president from New York.\n\nI was allowed to participate in the seminar as long as the identities of my fellow participants, who were not told in advance that I would be there, remained anonymous. We were led by two able moderators: Ami Dror, a former Israeli secret-service agent turned educational entrepreneur, and Ayanna Thompson, a Shakespeare scholar and professor of English. We got to know each other over an opening dinner of sea bass, strawberry flan and bottomless drinks. Some of my fellow-travellers told me that they went into the experience thinking that this would be a fun way to expand their networks and to learn how to sound and act like a leader. For many of us, it turned out to be far more revelatory.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Aspen bubble meant that reality receded into the distance. Ian Wagreich/Aspen Institute\n\nThe seminar began immediately after eating, with a discussion of An Agreement of the People, a manifesto written in 1647, during the English civil war, about the nature of the British constitution. The text focused on whether there should be universal male suffrage or whether property holders alone should have the vote, lest the people rise up and \u201ctake away all property\u201d. Thompson gave us our directions: the pamphlet concerned the question of who had a stake in society. Could we apply these same arguments to 21st-century America? We were split into two groups, assigned a side, and told to prepare talking points to debate.\n\n\u201cWhat we do is talk about texts out of context,\u201d she said. I followed the property defenders into an adjoining room where we developed our arguments against expanding the electorate. Democracy might be a good idea in theory, suggested the social-media executive, but it might not lead to the best \u201coutcomes\u201d. Our group nominated an education consultant from Memphis to speak on our behalf: \u201cThe law of man should be the law of the land,\u201d she said, in a cool, convincing manner. There was silence. We were unsettled by how commanding she was. Then a charter-school advocate, an African-American woman from Washington, DC, cut in: \u201cShut the fuck up.\u201d Everyone laughed. Thompson brought the group to order. \u201cWe start with a debate at the Aspen Institute,\u201d she explained, \u201cbecause we want to show there are multiple sides of the story.\u201d\n\nOver the next week, we raced through our anthology, frantically asking questions. Why was there so much inequality? Why were racism and sexism so persistent? What was happening to our world? We looked to these texts for solutions. We discussed an excerpt of the The Communist Manifesto that chronicles the development of rapacious capitalism. \u201cI read all of this and I think about Amazon,\u201d said the investment manager. The precarious state of politics hung over our conversation: Hobbes\u2019s description of life in the state of nature \u2013 \u201cnasty, brutish and short\u201d \u2013 prompted the president of a charter-school foundation to liken the vision of the Leviathan to \u201ca Donald Trump inaugural speech\u201d. Yet though we were urged to relate these books to our lives and the world, the Aspen bubble meant that reality receded into the distance. Sure, we checked our phones for the news during breaks, but it seemed like the tribulations of the world would never disturb the institute\u2019s Alpine idyll.\n\nNo one was allowed to shirk or whisper. Mobile phones were banned from the seminar room.\n\nAt our first rehearsal of Antigone, a box of props from previous productions was deposited against the wall and people start batting around ideas. \u201cWhat if the men are women and the women are men?\u201d \u201cWhat if Antigone is Siri?\u201d \u201cWhat if the Chorus is a Facebook group?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t like that Antigone dies,\u201d complained a valuation consultant. \u201cWell, there\u2019s a version of Romeo and Juliet where they both get better,\u201d said the university president.\n\nOver the course of our deliberations, everyone tried to steer the conversation towards their preferred outcome, which made me wonder if being a good leader is fundamentally a matter of strategically mobilising the syntax of politeness. \u201cIt would be great to have a statement that articulates our approach,\u201d said the social-media executive. Finally, the education consultant from Memphis suggested that we stage the play as a trial, with Antigone on one side and Creon on the other. Everyone liked this approach: instead of reading from the script we would distil it to its essence and turn the play into an arbitration between law and conscience (a full courtroom procedure was deemed too complicated). With this decided we broke for the day, reconvening a few hours later for a wine-tasting on a sunlit terrace.\n\nWe were told that by studying these books we would blossom into the \u201cvalues-driven\u201d leaders that Aspen reveres. On most days the programme ran from 8am to 8pm. People took it seriously. After all, the seminar costs $US11,350 ($16,900) in tuition, room and board. No one was allowed to shirk or whisper. Mobile phones were banned from the seminar room, though the charter-school advocate from Washington, a single mother, was given special dispensation: every day she worried whether her son, a tall black teenager, would make it home safely.\n\nWe repeatedly turned to Plato\u2019s Republic. We couldn\u2019t escape him: even the restaurant at the institute is called Plato\u2019s. When we discussed his allegory of the cave, the university president stood up and drew a picture of the cave and the men who lived their whole lives inside it. Bewitched by the shadows from their fire, they believed these made up the whole world. \u201cWhat is being described here?\u201d Thompson asked. \u201cFake news,\u201d said the university president. Only the enlightened can escape and discover the world outside. We considered our position: were terms like \u201cbest and brightest\u201d corroding society or strengthening it? Were we the chosen ones who had managed to see the light or were we still chasing shadows? \u201cThe problem is that you have this Aspen lens, and it makes you feel enlightened,\u201d the foundation president remarked. \u201cNo,\u201d said a former special-forces officer, \u201cthat\u2019s just the altitude sickness.\u201d\n\nThe Aspen method is supposed to make you uncomfortable. The seminar shapes you, I was warned, by breaking you. By the third or fourth day, people\u2019s walls start to crumble. There are tears. The Colombian oncologist, a man with a Jewish last name, confided that after he and his family moved to America, \u201cI felt safe.\u201d But when Trump praised white nationalists who had marched in Charlottesville, his wife had come to him and said, \u201cI think we made a mistake giving our daughter your last name.\u201d His voice broke as he said this. I tried to comfort him by telling him that my own family had had similar discussions, but found myself tearing up as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe winds of populism, anti-intellectualism and virulent nationalism have shaken the devotees of Aspen. Dan Bayer/Aspen Institute\n\nOn the fourth day we read Martin Luther King\u2019s Letter from Birmingham City Jail, in which he condemned the appalling silence of the good people. Several people silently cried. \u201cAre we the white moderates?\u201d Dror asked. \u201cYes,\u201d the global head of education, a white woman from San Francisco, answered. Later, the education consultant from Memphis, who is African-American, told us that she had been stopped three times by strangers as she walked around Aspen.\n\nA financial analyst, a white woman from New York, suggested that they were probably just curious, that their questions were innocent. The cannabis executive, also a white woman, pointed out to the analyst that no one had stopped to interrogate her in the same way. \u201cYou\u2019ve taken a risk in coming here that I did not,\u201d the cannabis executive said to the black woman. The financial analyst did not appreciate the tacit suggestion that she was racist. A chill descended. The investment manager intervened: \u201cWhat can we do that\u2019s not overthrowing the government tomorrow?\u201d\n\nI was surprised by the extent to which these committed professionals of all political stripes, Democrat and Republican, foresaw political upheaval. Though each had some stake in maintaining the status quo, they were largely pessimistic about the future. A few wondered aloud about the prospect of an uprising. The chief medical officer pondered if the \u201cshocks\u201d we were undergoing \u2013 Brexit, Trump and beyond \u2013 were in fact making our society \u201cmore resilient\u201d. The education consultant from Memphis confessed that she was a \u201cbaby prepper\u201d, planning for social unrest. There would be violence, she warned, and she wanted to be sure her stockpiles were maintained. Conversations kept coming back to the feeling that we stood at the brink.\n\nEarlier in the week, by way of Herman Melville\u2019s Billy Budd, we had considered how we would go about putting down mutinies among our staff. Yet just a few days later we found ourselves discussing whether we would take part in the coming revolution. (That the revolution was, indeed, coming was not a major point of dispute.) I asked my fellow participants: what exactly would they rebel against? And whose side would they take? But time was running out. We had been conversing civilly for too long. We broke for coffee, and the staff swept in to clear our plates.\n\nThe winds of populism, anti-intellectualism and virulent nationalism have shaken the devotees of Aspen. Its graduates no longer set the political agenda. Mortimer Adler, one of the co-founders of the institute, once remarked that Aspen was proof that, \u201cin the scale of values, the Platonic Triad of the true, the good and the beautiful takes precedence over the Machiavellian triad of money, fame and power\u201d.\n\nSometimes, I find myself wondering what we\u2019re actually doing here in Aspen. \u2014 Anand Giridharadas\n\nBut what Aspen views as the true, the good and the beautiful is not winning at the moment, and the institute is not entirely innocent. It has become a place where celebrities mingle so freely with businessfolk and politicians that they have come to believe that they could easily do each others\u2019 jobs. Along with the TED Talks, the Aspen Ideas Festival has turned policymaking into a form of entertainment in which the most authentic-sounding and emotive performers rack up ardent followings. In doing so, it contributed to the reinvention of the celebrity politician in the digital age. In this sense, the Aspen Institute is both political poison and cure. It may yet come up with solutions for our age of populism, but it is also inescapably part of its cause.\n\nWhen I spoke to Eric Motley, the institute\u2019s executive vice-president and a veteran of the George W Bush administration, he wondered aloud, \u201cHow do you safeguard yourself from the leaders who will destroy the very foundations of American democracy?\u201d He continued, though, to have faith: the executive seminar would help people grapple with this inflection point in American history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOthers believe that Aspen needs to change. The most forceful challenge to its worldview came in 2015 when Anand Giridharadas, a writer and former Aspen fellow, spoke at the institute before a largely hostile audience. He asked in advance for forgiveness. \u201cThe Aspen Consensus, in a nutshell, is this: the winners of our age must be challenged to do more good. But never, ever tell them to do less harm,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes, I find myself wondering what we\u2019re actually doing here in Aspen\u2026 Are we using our collective strength to challenge the powerful, or are we helping to make an unjust, unpalatable system feel a little more digestible?\u201d\n\nAlbright came up to him afterwards and \u201cgently disparaged\u201d his speech, he says. He expanded his lecture into a book, published last year, entitled Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World. \u201cIf you are a small group of business elites gathering in the hills in 2019, you have a very high risk of being on the wrong side of history,\u201d he told me. \u201cBubble-bath interviews are not the answer to an age of populism.\u201d He acknowledges that he is a product of the Aspen world, which is why he cares about its future. (I, too, am part of this world. At the festival I encountered contemporaries from high school, university and graduate school. I watched a former colleague of mine being interviewed. I have written for The Atlantic, which co-hosts the festival.)\n\nYet there is a more fundamental threat to the Aspen Institute than a prophet without honour such as Giridharadas: that the elite will continue to meet with the elite, and gradually grow irrelevant.\n\nZuckerberg took a breath and turned to face the crowd. His voice was deep if slightly harried, and his face impassive.\n\nThe executive seminar and the Ideas Festival are supposed to be complementary. \u201cThey balance each other,\u201d Isaacson told me. \u201cIt\u2019s useful to have both types of experience: very intimate, monastic ones and very public ones. Any good stable molecule ought to have two strong atoms to it.\u201d But unlike the executive seminar the Ideas Festival didn\u2019t have many moments of reckoning. Two days after we took our stroll together, Porterfield walked through campus with a new companion: Mark Zuckerberg had come to town as an unannounced special guest. It was a last-minute surprise for everyone, including the organisers.\n\nAfter years of declining invitations, Zuckerberg\u2019s team at Facebook had called up and asked for an audience. He was given a friendly interlocutor, in the person of Cass Sunstein, a legal scholar who has consulted for Facebook. Apart from a small press pool, reporters were excluded. Amy DeMaria, the institute\u2019s vice-president of communications, grabbed my arm and brought me in as her guest, ushering me past a private security guard who tried to stop me. So I got to see Sunstein ask Zuckerberg, gently, if he could \u201csay a little bit\u201d about why he is calling for governmental regulation and what \u201cinspired\u201d him to do so. Zuckerberg took a breath and turned to face the crowd. His voice was deep if slightly harried, and his face impassive. Fixing the social and political problems exacerbated by social media, he said, was not Facebook\u2019s prerogative alone. \u201cIt\u2019s above our pay grade,\u201d he said. He was briefly heckled and then applauded.\n\nFacebook is collaborating with the Aspen Institute on an adaptation of the Aspen method that will explore ideas around challenging conventional leadership. Participants will not be required to perform Antigone, but if they were, I wonder if they could replicate the ruthless efficiency with which my cohort tackled it. \u201cNine-Minute Antigone\u201d was our group name.\n\nWe\u2019ve spent the whole week talking about just government and we just decided to give one person power over the entire decision.\n\nWe distilled the arbitration into a series of questions: is it better to value discipline over morality? How do we distinguish between a just and unjust law? How do we define what is right and wrong? We selected quotations from our anthology that offered competing approaches. We chose a judge, and put Creon, the despotic ruler, on the side of law, and Antigone, the rebel, on the side of conscience. But we were divided about who should win. A handful of people identified with Creon. Antigone acted selfishly, one person remarked. She thought only of herself.\n\nThe plan was for the judge to mull over the case and tell us his verdict only during the performance. The investment manager raised his hand again: \u201cI just want to point out that we\u2019ve spent the whole week talking about just government and we just decided to give one person power over the entire decision.\u201d\n\nHe was right. It was an embarrassing oversight. We created a fix. The decision wouldn\u2019t be left to the expert judge but to the people. Instead of allowing Antigone to die gruesomely, as she does in the play, we would kill the judge, who we named Socrates, instead. And so, on the afternoon of the performance, we assembled near the marble garden, where a bar had been set up in the shade. We nursed our wine and beers as we ran through a full rehearsal. Then our moderators arrived, signalling that it was time for the show.\n\nOur appointed narrator stepped forward: \u201cWe are gathered here, in the light of the sun, to arbitrate the tensions between conscience and law. We are asking: what society do we want to live in?\u201d Antigone and Creon delivered their opening statements, and then one by one, we stepped forward to say our parts. When it was time for the judge to deliver his verdict, we strode towards him, armed with umbrellas, to prevent him from speaking. \u201cWe choose democracy!\u201d we half-heartedly chanted, as we acted out his murder. Revolution by the Beatles played as we took our bows. Justice was dead and we had killed him. We were Aspen leaders now.\n\nLinda Kinstler was a guest of the Aspen Institute on one of its executive seminars\n\n1843 Magazine", "description": "Barack Obama, George H W Bush and nearly 10 per cent of Ukraine's MPs have passed through the doors of the Aspen Institute, but is it losing relevance?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2149%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/fb2fcc37ab69d08e269c1878ea914c87d990913a", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
