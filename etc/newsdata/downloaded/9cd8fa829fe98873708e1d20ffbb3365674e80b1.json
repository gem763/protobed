(AP) - Kent State coach Sean Lewis insists Saturday\u2019s matchup at No. 8 Wisconsin isn\u2019t about him. But in some respects it is.\n\nLewis played quarterback and tight end for the Badgers from 2004-07. Now, the 33-year-old Lewis returns to Camp Randall Stadium to face Wisconsin (4-0) as the youngest head coach in the Football Bowl Subdivision.\n\n\u201cWhen we get up there, I know a lot\u2019s going to be made about that and my history going back there,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of great memories. But it ain\u2019t about me. It\u2019s about these kids. The games are about the kids. It\u2019s all about them.\u201d\n\nWisconsin coach Paul Chryst, who was the Badgers\u2019 offensive coordinator when Lewis was at Wisconsin, said he had no idea Lewis had aspirations to be a coach.\n\n\u201cI think at the time, he\u2019s one of those guys that you were glad he\u2019s in your room,\u201d Chryst said. \u201cI had a chance to be around him a lot. Whatever the team needed, he was going to jump in, and do whatever he could do. I couldn\u2019t say at the time I knew \u2018He\u2019s going to be a head coach,\u2019 but it didn\u2019t surprise me and I\u2019m glad that he did choose that. Obviously, he\u2019s done well.\u201d\n\nFLASHY OFFENSE\n\nLewis, who was named Kent State coach in December 2017, is also the play-caller for a Golden Flashes offense that racked up a school-record 750 yards (375 passing and 375 rushing) in a 62-20 win over Bowling Green on Sept. 21.\n\n\u201cPlays come alive because of the players,\u201d Lewis said, \u201cand we got great players. We got great young people in our program and because of that, that\u2019s what happens.\u201d\n\nQuarterback Dustin Crum leads the Mid-American Conference in completion percentage (70.9) and passing efficiency rating (158.2). The 6-foot-3 junior completed 26 of 31 passes for 310 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions in the record-setting victory for Kent State (2-2). Running backs Jo-El Shaw and Joachim Bangda combined for 223 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nSTOUT DEFENSE\n\nWisconsin has the No. 1 defense in the country. The Badgers lead the nation in scoring defense (7.3 points per game) and total defense (192.3 yards per game). Wisconsin has scored three defensive touchdowns while allowing just four touchdowns this season. The Badgers have allowed opponents to convert a nation-low 15.5% of their third-down attempts.\n\nInside linebacker Chris Orr was named Big Ten Defensive Player of the Week after recording nine tackles, two sacks and a forced fumble in the Badgers\u2019 24-15 win over Northwestern.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done a really good job of pressuring the quarterback,\u201d Orr said. \u201cI would say that\u2019s probably the biggest thing. \u2026 And also, we\u2019re just attacking the ball.\u201d\n\nTALYOR MADE\n\nHeisman hopeful Jonathan Taylor has rushed for at least 100 yards in nine straight games for the Badgers, the longest active streak in the country. The junior running back has 4,730 career yards rushing and is 186 yards shy of passing Melvin Gordon for third place on Wisconsin\u2019s all-time rushing list.\n\nLOOKING TO BOUNCE BACK\n\nWisconsin\u2019s Jack Coan won his sixth straight start last week despite a lackluster performance against the Wildcats. The junior quarterback finished 15-for-21 with 113 yards and an interception.\n\n\u201cThroughout my whole football career, I\u2019ve had a bunch of bad plays and things like that,\u201d Coan said. \u201cYou really learn to bounce back from those bad plays and have a short memory.\u201d\n\nFIRST MATCHUP\n\nKent State and Wisconsin have never played each other in football. The Golden Flashes will look to pull off the upset at Camp Randall Stadium, where the Badgers have won 48 of their last 49 nonconference games.\n\n___\n\nFollow Keith Jenkins on Twitter: https://twitter.com/MrKeithJenkins\n\n___\n\nFor more AP college football coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Kent State coach Sean Lewis insists Saturday\u2019s matchup at No. 8 Wisconsin isn\u2019t about him.
