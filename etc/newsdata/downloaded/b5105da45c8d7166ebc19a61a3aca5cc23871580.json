REUTERS/Ciro de Luca/File Photo\n\nItalian President Sergio Mattarella gave Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte a mandate on Thursday to try to form a new coalition following Matteo Salvini\u2019s decision to pull his right-wing League from its 14-month-old alliance with 5-Star to seek early elections.\n\nConte said the \u201cpolitical mood\u201d between 5-Stars and once bitter adversary PD was good.\n\n\u201cIt will be on Tuesday, Wednesday at the latest,\u201d he said in a video interview during a conference organised by Il Fatto Quotidiano newspaper, when asked when he would report back to Mattarella with a program and a lineup for the new government.\n\n\u201cObviously I am confident on a positive outcome.\u201d he added.\n\nIf no agreement is sealed in the coming week, Mattarella is expected to dissolve parliament and set a date for a new vote.\n\nIn a sign that a deal on the program might be closer, the 5-Star Movement said later on Sunday its members were called on Tuesday between 0700 and 1600 GMT to give a green light to a potential coalition accord with PD through a web-based ballot on the movement\u2019s internet platform, dubbed Rousseau.\n\nMembers will have to answer whether they agree that the movement should form a government with PD, chaired by Conte, the 5-Stars official blog said, in line with the party\u2019s credo of direct democracy.\n\nThe blog added that the government program agreed with PS would be available online to members when voting starts.\n\nStung by what it saw as betrayal and keen to avoid a return to the ballot box, the populist 5-Star has agreed to make an attempt to govern with centre-left PD, which is in the process of rebuilding after a string of election defeats.\n\nBut despite the differences over policy and ministerial roles, senior figures from both sides have been speaking in support of a coalition during the weekend as the talks have continued.\n\n\u201cI know it is difficult, but we\u2019re doing our best to give this country a new government,\u201d PD leader Nicola Zingaretti said on Sunday in a video post on Twitter.\n\nHe said on Friday after talks with Conte that Italy\u2019s next government must cut income taxes to boost consumption, relaunch investment and focus on health and education.\n\n\u2018LET\u2019S TRY TO DREAM\u2019\n\nThe former prime minister and former PD leader, Matteo Renzi, to whom many party lawmakers owe their allegiance, was quoted in Il Sole business daily as saying: \u201cWe do politics thinking of a common good. Italy needs a government that averts a planned VAT tax increase and pulls the country out of the isolation in Europe caused by Salvini.\u201d\n\nBeppe Grillo, the influential founder of 5-Star, came out in favour of a deal on Saturday, calling on the PD to seize the \u201cunique\u201d chance to form a coalition.\n\n\u201cAnother chance like this one will not come again,\u201d the comedian said in a video posted on his blog. \u201cLet\u2019s try to dream, to have a vision.\u201d\n\n5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio has also made a string of policy demands for a new government - including the confirmation of a decree clamping down on migrant sea rescues - setting an uncompromising tone for the negotiations.\n\nFILE PHOTO: 5-Star Movement founder Beppe Grillo gestures as he talks during a political rally with Luigi Di Maio in Torre del Greco, near Naples, Italy February 12, 2018. REUTERS/Ciro De Luca/File Photo\n\nThe PD has proposed scrapping the deputy prime minister\u2019s position, a job that both it and 5-Star wanted.\n\nSalvini\u2019s League remains the most popular party, despite toppling the government. A poll published on Saturday by Corriere della Sera daily newspaper showed support for the League fell to 31.8% from a mid-July record high of 35.9%.\n\nFive-Star rose almost 7 percentage points from mid-July to 24.2% according to the same poll, while PD rose only marginally to 22.3%.", "description": "Italy's prime minister said on Sunday he expected to finalise talks over a new government by Wednesday, as the 5-Star Movement and Democratic Party were in intense discussions during the weekend to hammer out a deal on a common agenda and Cabinet posts.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190901&t=2&i=1425140741&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF801ZB"}
