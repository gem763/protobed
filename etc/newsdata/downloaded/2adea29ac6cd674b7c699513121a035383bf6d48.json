Last month she sailed from Europe to the United States on a zero-emission yacht.\n\nAt an energy forum in Moscow Wednesday, Putin discussed Thunberg\u2019s recent speech at the United Nations, where she denounced world leaders for failing to combat climate change.\n\n\u201cI may disappoint you, but I don\u2019t share the common excitement about the speech by Greta Thunberg,\u201d Putin said, according to Reuters\u2019s translation of his remarks.\n\n\u201cNo one has explained to Greta that the modern world is complex and different,\u201d Putin continued. \u201cPeople in Africa or in many Asian countries want to live at the same wealth level as in Sweden.\u201d\n\nPutin said children who are passionate about environmental issues, like Thunberg, should be supported. But he also accused her parents of exploiting that passion.\n\n\u201cWhen someone is using children and teenagers in personal interests, it only deserves to be condemned,\u201d Putin said. \u201cI\u2019m sure that Greta is a kind and very sincere girl. But adults must do everything not to bring teenagers and children into some extreme situations.\u201d\n\nGreta Thunberg and Russian President Vladimir Putin (Photos: Jason DeCrow/AP, Alexei Druzhinin, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP) More\n\nThunberg\u2019s mother, Malena Ernman, is an opera singer; her father, Svante Thunberg, is an actor. They wrote a parenting book, called \u201cScenes From the Heart,\u201d that chronicles their daughter\u2019s climate awakening. An English-language version, under the revised title \u201cOur House Is on Fire,\u201d is due to be published next year.\n\nLast month, Thunberg excoriated attendees at the United Nations climate summit for their inaction.\n\n\u201cThis is all wrong,\u201d she said, reading from a piece of paper. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean, yet you come to us young people for hope. How dare you.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are suffering,\u201d she continued through tears. \u201cPeople are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are at the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump, whose administration has rolled back environmental protections and withdrew the U.S. from the Paris climate accord, seemed to mock Thunberg in a tweet that included a video clip of her speech.\n\n\u201cShe seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cSo nice to see!\u201d\n\nThunberg responded by changing her Twitter bio to read: \u201cA very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "After the Russian president described her as \"a kind and very sincere girl\" who doesn't understand the complexities of \"the modern world,\" the 16-year-old responded by changing her Twitter bio to mock his dismissive words.", "authors": ["Dylan Stableford", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/30SwSBsYhLpsXNYNKEVPLw--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/d4888910-e60a-11e9-af75-a2fdc3ae9b8e", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
