School for her was nothing like it is for her sons, 21-year-old Flynn and 16-year-old Cy, whose father is French financier Arpad Busson. \u201cYou just sort of went to school and came home and did your homework, or maybe you didn\u2019t.\u201d She played netball, goal attack, \u201cbecause I was tall and liked to shoot goals and run around\u201d, and swam, which she loved.\n\n\u201cI would get up at 5am every day and do my training and that was really important to me. It\u2019s been the foundation of my discipline as far as being camera-ready.\u201d I ask her about the rumour that she used to do 1000 sit-ups daily. \u201cI think at one point I did,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause it was what I thought was necessary to be professional.\u201d Now, her understanding of wellness has changed, she says, and is about consciously nourishing herself rather than doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.\n\nMacpherson with then husband Arki Busson in 2002. AP\n\nIt\u2019s an excellent segue into her latest business venture, the five-year-old \u201cthird child\u201d, WelleCo, a supplement line she co-founded with former friend Andrea Horwood. It\u2019s the holy grail of businesses, she says, because she gets to do what she loves, make a profit and make a difference in people\u2019s lives, in much the same way her life was transformed when she \u201cdiscovered\u201d a plant-based diet and began taking the supplements that would one day become WelleCo\u2019s line of powdered greens and so-called superfoods. Recently the company has suffered a blow: Macpherson and Horwood have parted ways, with Horwood alleging that Macpherson and other investors deliberately cut her out of the $21 million business.\n\nMacpherson can\u2019t comment since Horwood is suing Rolico, WelleCo\u2019s parent company. \u201cBusiness is a journey,\u201d Macpherson says, \u201cSometimes things fall together and sometimes they fall apart. Things evolve.\u201d She requests that we move on.\n\nMacpherson never set out to be a model. She was going to study law, she can\u2019t remember where, but thinks it was probably Macquarie University, and realised she would need to finance the study herself. \u201cI worked in a pharmacy when I was 13, then I was a waitress. I was very comfortable working to earn a living.\u201d A friend suggested modelling and she thought, \u201cWhy not? Let\u2019s give it a go.\u201d It\u2019s a refrain Macpherson repeats often during our conversation, and something she sees as the Australian way. \u201cIt\u2019s very Aussie, you know, that attitude of get up and get on with things. Australians are very courageous. We like giving things a go.\u201d\n\nMacpherson struck gold in a commercial for Tab cola, in which she appeared in a red bikini that mirrored the soda\u2019s can. At the end of a \u201cgap year\u201d of modelling, she got the chance to go to New York with an agency. \u201cOriginally it was for a few weeks, then it was a few months and \u2026 that was 37 years ago.\u201d New York in the early 1980s was rough and ready, she says; she felt nervous at night. She hung out with a band of artists and musicians and felt like she was part of a cultural hub. \u201cI was very blessed,\u201d she says. She doesn't regret skipping law. \"I still get to read lots of contracts!\"\n\nMacpherson scans the menu, mentioning that she \u201cloves vegetables\u201d, and settles on ratatouille, checking with the waiter that there is no meat in the dish and that the bread comes on the side (it does). I\u2019m tempted to eat steak frites in front of the supermodel but deep down I know I\u2019ll never do it; I choose the nicoise salad and am too afraid even to eat the croutons it comes with.\n\nWould Macpherson like a drink? It\u2019s Friday, after all.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t drink.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh. \u201cWhen did you stop?\u201d\n\nMacpherson graced five Sports Illustrated covers \u2013 more than any other model.\n\n\u201cSixteen years ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny particular reason?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I decided to stop drinking.\u201d\n\n\u201cWas it hard?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. It was just a decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you feel better for it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of a question is that? Bit leading.\u201d She pauses, looking down at the table in front of her. \u201cNo, I just don\u2019t miss it.\u201d\n\nAh. \u201cDid you drink a lot before?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going there.\u201d\n\nWe move on once more. In 1986, the then 21-year-old Macpherson married French photographer Gilles Bensimon, who was 42 at the time.\n\nThis is one of Macpherson's favourite images ever.\n\nHe was creative director for the French edition of Elle magazine and they worked together; she learnt what made a good image, how to navigate the fashion industry. \u201cOne of my favourite images ever is one that Gilles did for Elle. I had wet hair, a fringe, my hair was dark and I had fluorescent zinc on my nose. It was very surfer, very Australian, but something about the way Gilles did it, he made me look like a warrior, like it was war paint.\u201d Though they divorced in 1989, the pair remain close. In May this year, she posted a series of images he\u2019d taken of her in the '80s to Instagram to celebrate their wedding anniversary, even though they haven't been together for 30 years. \u201cWe speak every week,\u201d she says matter-of-factly. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been close.\u201d Was there a time, perhaps after their split, when they didn\u2019t speak? She shakes her head. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nOur salads arrive and Macpherson takes her plate into her hands, looking down into it. At first I think she is speaking to me as she says, \u201cThank you, universe, for this beautiful food. I am so blessed to be here sharing with you.\u201d I start to answer her before I realise that she hasn\u2019t finished. \u201cThank you for giving me your time today. Thank you for this magnificent food which Mother Earth has provided for us.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not sure how to answer except to ask if Macpherson is a spiritual person. Yes, she says. \u201cI consider myself to have a strong spiritual foundation.\u201d She eats (but only half of what's on her plate).\n\nHow did she move from modelling to business? In the early '90s, supermodels were big business themselves \u2013 Linda Evangelista, it was said, refused to get up for less than $10,000 a day \u2013 but without the associated brand extensions they now have. Elizabeth Taylor was shilling perfumes but there was no Kylie Jenner with her billion-dollar lip kits or Miranda Kerr selling organic skincare.\n\n\u201cI took a risk,\u201d she says. \u201cNecessity is the mother of invention. I wanted to evolve out of being in front of the camera to a position where I\u2019d seen a lot of sportspeople succeed, people like Greg Norman and John Newcombe.\u201d At the time, Norman had licensed his name to a line of Nike sneakers. Macpherson thought she could do the same and went into business with New Zealand corset-maker Bendon, manufacturing a line of lingerie with her name attached. In 2005, Vanity Fair reported that the range raked in more than $70 million in sales across Asia, Australia, New Zealand and the UK. When it launched in the US that year, Macpherson\u2019s good friend Gwyneth Paltrow gave the maternity bra her tick of approval on The Oprah Winfrey Show. Not a bad endorsement.\n\nMacpherson in 1998 with models dressed in her eponymous underwear range.\n\nStill, at first Macpherson wasn\u2019t sure it would work, and even now she says the success was more about being in the right place at the right time. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like I could say, here\u2019s another model who\u2019s done this, let\u2019s emulate what she\u2019s done. It was an intuitive move. I made choices because they felt right. There was no great intellect to it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer father, Peter Gow, owned a chain of electronics stores, Miranda Hi-Fi, and Macpherson considers him her business mentor. \u201cHe was self-made, resourceful, creative. He gave me an indication of what it would be like to be my own boss.\u201d\n\n\u201cI took a risk. Necessity is the mother of invention,\" says Macpherson. Janie Barrett\n\nOther licensing opportunities didn\u2019t quite hit the mark for Macpherson; she turned down a Barbie doll made in her likeness, for example. \u201cOh my gosh, I\u2019d forgotten about that,\u201d she says. \u201cI probably had some feeling about it, you know, objectifying women.\u201d\n\nShe sometimes feels misunderstood and says she is misquoted, like the time in 1992 when she reportedly told Good Weekend that she'd never read anything she hadn't written herself.\n\n\"That's actually a misquote,\" she says. \"As if I was going to say that! I don't even understand how they misconstrued it.\" Surely, she adds, people are smart enough to understand that the quote was a total fallacy.\n\nMacpherson dabbled in acting, too, appearing in six episodes of Friends and before that, securing a two-year deal with Miramax. What was her experience with Harvey Weinstein? \u201cWe made great projects together,\u201d she says. She counts them off on her fingers: \u201cSirens, my workout videos, a film called Jane Eyre.\u201d She looks me in the eye as she says, \u201cMy dealings with him were very professional and, actually, very good experiences.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou might be the only woman in Hollywood who can say that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe shrugs and throws her hands in the air, saying nothing.\n\nAnd this is the thing about Macpherson: you think you\u2019re getting somewhere, and then the wall goes up again, the defences raised. There is no penetrating those barriers. I tell her that Bob Hawke had a portrait of the two of them in his office when he was prime minister and she says, \u201cYou\u2019re kidding!\u201d She remembers taking the photo with him but says only, and dryly, \u201cYeah, it was at the peak of both of our careers.\u201d\n\nI ask her how she\u2019d like to be remembered: as a model, as a businesswoman, as an icon? And finally she allows a crack in the veneer. \u201cAs Flynn and Cy\u2019s mum,\u201d she says. \u201cIf that\u2019s all I ever did, I\u2019d be very happy indeed.\u201d\n\nThe bill\n\nSofitel Darling Harbour, 12 Darling Drive, Sydney\n\nRatatouille, $25\n\nNicoise salad, $22\n\n2 espressos, $8\n\n1 bottle sparkling water, $9\n\nTotal $64", "description": "Over Lunch with the AFR, the former supermodel talks about business break-ups, Harvey Weinstein and being misquoted.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2463%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c16ebaee780545467b4f86a84df4568c513a497a", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
