Instead, her goal is to claim a \"simple and basic right\" as for the first time since the establishment of the Islamic republic in 1979, Iranian authorities have allowed women to buy tickets to attend a men\u2019s football match.\n\n\"I can't deny how happy I am to finally be able to go to the stadium, and I know I will be very emotional once there,\" she said.\n\n\"It feels great to take back what's yours.\"\n\nAlong with Niloufar, segregated from a usually loud male crowd that has long monopolised the 79-000-capacity venue, more than 3,000 other women will be cheering on as the Iranian national team takes on Cambodia for a World Cup qualifier.\n\nThe first 850 tickets allocated to women were sold out in \"a few minutes\", leading the Iranian football authorities last week to put more on sale.\n\n\u2018Blue Girl\u2019\n\nPressure on Iran to allow women to attend men\u2019s football matches increased last month following the death of Sahar Khodayari, which sparked widespread outrage. The 29-year-old, dubbed \"Blue Girl\" online due to the colour of her team\u2019s jersey, died of her wounds after setting herself on fire outside a Tehran court upon learning she could be imprisoned for attempting to sneak into a stadium disguised as a man.\n\n190910170109925\n\nWhile it has never been a law, the ban on women attending men\u2019s football matches has been enforced since 1981 as part of a set of rules that discipline women\u2019s dress and presence in public spaces, according to the Iranian authorities\u2019 interpretation of Islam. The country\u2019s conservative leaders have also pointed to sports facilities not being appropriated for women as part of their reasoning for the move, citing the lack of female restrooms.\n\nThe ban, which also extends to volleyball and basketball matches, has been momentarily relaxed in the past, but activists concur that the match on Thursday is a \"first official step forward\".\n\nTheir enthusiasm, however, of women being allowed to buy tickets just like men was swiftly tempered by the imposition of a cap limiting their attendance to just five percent of the venue\u2019s capacity.\n\n\"As a matter of human rights and according to FIFA\u2019s own statues, the cap must not be in place,\" Minky Worden, director of global initiative at Human Rights Watch, said.\n\n\n\n\"That is gender discrimination which creates risks.\"\n\nCautious welcome\n\nMeanwhile, questions loom over what will happen to those women who are expected to show up at the stadium, even without a ticket.\n\n\n\n\"I prefer to be realistic because we have already been through a lot - from beatings, to arrests, to self-immolations,\" Niloufar said. \"So why not be worried?\"\n\nLike Niloufar, Maryam Shojaei, a women\u2019s rights campaigner and the sister of the captain of the Iranian national team Masoud Shojaei, prefers to be cautious.\n\n\"After decades, the taboo is broken,\" she said. \"But we have to be careful as the situation is unpredictable; we have to see how the authorities will react\".\n\nYears-long fight\n\nOften coming at a high cost, the women\u2019s fight against the ban - one of many undertaken in recent years by activists defying such practices or laws with acts of civil disobedience \u2013 stretches back many years.\n\n\"We would go to protest at every single national match,\" recalled Sara, a member of the OpenStadiums network of feminists, activists and journalists, who began demonstrating in front of Azadi Stadium in 2005. \"Sometimes they [the authorities] would beat us, throw us punches, kicks or arrest us.\"\n\nIn 2006, after top clerics adopted a harsher rhetoric over the ban and the authorities\u2019 response became more violent, OpenStadiums began documenting police behaviour, sending recorded materials and signed petitions to FIFA, the world football\u2019s governing body, and the Asian Football Confederation (AFC).\n\n\"It was hard to put our voice out there because there were no social media,\" Sara said.\n\nIn 2013, she decided to create the OpenStadiums Twitter account to attract the attention of former FIFA President Sepp Blatter before his arrival in the Iranian capital for a game.\n\nBlatter later said that in a meeting with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani during his Tehran visit, he urged him \"to consider that half of the nation who can\u2019t attend the match\". Blatter\u2019s successor, Gianni Infantino, has also mentioned the ban during talks with Rouhani.\n\n\u2018FIFA is responsible\u2019\n\nBut Iranian activists have long expressed disappointment with FIFA over their perceived failure to force change despite a number of petitions. And now, some fear the Iran-Cambodia match could turn into a publicity stunt to sedate international pressure in the wake of Khodayari\u2019s death before the ban is introduced again.\n\nIn June 2018, following the detention of several female fans at a game between Iran and Syria, Infantino wrote a letter to Iran\u2019s football authorities giving them a July 15 deadline to take \"concrete steps to ensure that all Iranian women will be allowed to buy tickets\".\n\nYet no concrete action followed. Then in November 2018, Infantino flew to Tehran for the AFC tournament final where some 800 women were selectively invited to attend the match. The FIFA president described their presence as \"great progress\", but activists decried it as a \"show\" to please the international guest as the ban was reimposed straight after his departure.\n\nIranian women wave Iranian flags during a ceremony of farewell for their national football team ahead of the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, at the hall of Azadi (freedom) sports compound in Tehran, Iran.

They are responsible for the fact that I don\u2019t feel secure in my own country,\" OpenStadiums said. \"They could have taken serious actions years ago, but they never did. They should have simply followed their own rules\".\n\nThe world body has never penalised Iran, despite its own statutes and human rights policy stating that any discrimination against women \"is strictly prohibited and punished by suspension or expulsion\".\n\nFIFA did not respond when asked about its readiness to sanction Iran if the country fails to lift the ban beyond Thursday\u2019s match, pointing to a statement it released following accusations by Iranian activists of lack of proper action.\n\n\"FIFA announced that it will, based on the operational plans and results of the 10 October 2019 game, collaborate with the FFIRI in developing an operational protocol and related requirements for matches in the Iranian football league to be opened for women as well,'' the statement said, referring to the Football Federation of the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n\n\u2018We are moving ahead\u2019\n\nAmid increasing international attention before Thursday\u2019s match, the current administration led by Rouhani, the Iranian president, appears to be in favour of the ban being lifted.\n\n\"I think we are moving ahead,\" Masoumeh Ebtekar, Iran\u2019s vice president of family and women\u2019s affairs, told Al Jazeera. \"I think the government has made serious efforts to that end and now we hope to see a game where we have women sitting in the stadium.\"\n\nBut the government has to deal with the opposition \"from conservatives, hardliners and some religious groups that are strong enough to create many problems along the way\", Saeid Jafari, a political analyst, said.\n\nOn Monday, about 50 religious hardliners demonstrated outside Iran\u2019s parliament, chanting slogans against the lifting of the ban.\n\nYet their opposition does not seem to deter the women who will attend Thursday\u2019s match - and also plan to chant their own slogans in support of their favourite team.\n\n\"The poor Cambodian team,\" Niloufar says jokingly. \"How unfortunate for them to have to face not only the Iranian footballers, but thousands of impassioned Iranian women.\"", "description": "After decades of struggle, female football fans say their presence at World Cup qualifier is just the beginning.", "authors": ["Virginia Pietromarchi"], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/9/46991858965040f1ab95a81b80032ff5_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
