Twitter/ @DDannfelt\n\nKuala Lumpur woke up to a not-so-sunny morning on Tuesday (September 10).\n\nThe air in parts of the country was heavily polluted and readings in most of Kuala Lumpur reached the \u201cunhealthy\u201d range (101 to 200) by 11am, according to the Department of Environment\u2019s Air Pollutant Index (API).\n\nAcross the entire nation, the highest readings were registered at Rompin, Pahang (194) and Sri Aman, Sarawak (192). According to the API, readings from 201 to 300 are considered \u201cvery unhealthy\u201d.\n\nKuala Lumpur, Malaysia\u2019s biggest city with a population of 7.2 million, recorded an API of 157, making visibility a problem. This is also believed to be the highest API reading in the city since the last haze crisis in 2015, the New Straits Times (NST) reported.\n\nSeveral Twitter users, including Sweden\u2019s ambassador to Malaysia, Dag Juhlin-Dannfelt, posted photos of the Malaysian capital shrouded in haze on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nHaze situation today in KL.

Not all of Sarawak was shrouded in haze though \u2013 API readings for places like Limbang and Sarikei were recorded at 53 and 79 respectively.\n\nAPI readings between 0 and 50 are categorised as \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cmoderate\u201d when between 51 and 100. Readings above 300 are considered \u201chazardous\u201d.\n\nOver in the southern part of the peninsula, Johor\u2019s air quality remained in the moderate range, as did neighbouring country Singapore\u2019s.\n\nSingapore\u2019s air still moderate \u2013 for now\n\nHowever, hazy conditions are expected to hit the island nation if hotspots continue to persist.\n\nAccording to the Singapore\u2019s National Environment Agency (NEA), the weather in Sumatra has been dry lately and a total of 380 hotspots were detected on Monday, mostly in central and southern Sumatra.\n\nPrevailing south-easterly winds could bring slightly hazy conditions to the Republic if the hotspot situation in Sumatra persists, NEA said.\n\nThe ASEAN Specialised Meteorological Centre (ASMC) \u2013 a regional collaboration programme among the National Meteorological Services (NMSs) of ASEAN member countries \u2013 said on Monday via its website that the build-up of moderate-to-dense haze is due to the further escalation of hotspot activities in Sumatra, particularly, Riau and Jambi.\n\nRead Also:", "description": "Business Insider - Most of Kuala Lumpur's air is in the unhealthy range today..
