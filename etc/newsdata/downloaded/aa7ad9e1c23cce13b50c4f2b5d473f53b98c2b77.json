A hearing there is due to begin Tuesday.\n\nAfter the ruling, opposition politicians urged the government to scrap the suspension and recall lawmakers to Parliament.\n\nA group of about 70 opposition lawmakers challenged the government\u2019s decision to prorogue, or formally shut down, Parliament, for five weeks until Oct. 14 \u2014 just over two weeks before Britain is due to leave the EU.\n\nJohnson claims he took the action so that he can start afresh on his domestic agenda at a new session of Parliament next month. But the suspension also gives him a respite from rebellious lawmakers as he plots his next move to break the political deadlock and lead Britain out of the EU by Oct. 31.\n\nOpponents argue that Johnson is trying to evade democratic scrutiny.\n\nLast week, a court in Edinburgh rejected the lawmakers\u2019 challenge, saying it was a matter for politicians, not the courts, to decide.\n\nBut that was overturned Wednesday on appeal.\n\nJolyon Maugham, a lawyer who is part of the claim, said he believed \u201cthat the effect of the decision is that Parliament is no longer prorogued.\u201d\n\nIt was unclear what that means in practice. Catherine Haddon, a senior fellow at independent think-tank the Institute for Government, tweeted that the ruling \u201cdoes not (yet) change the prorogation itself. Though of course will add to pressure.\u201d\n\nLabour Party Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer said the court\u2019s ruling was \u201cvery rare and it\u2019s very strong.\u201d He said the government should immediately recall Parliament.\n\nThe British government said it was disappointed by the decision and confirmed it would appeal to the Supreme Court.\n\nIn a statement, the government said it \u201cneeds to bring forward a strong domestic legislative agenda. Proroguing Parliament is the legal and necessary way of delivering this.\u201d\n\nIt noted that another challenge to the suspension, brought by transparency campaigner Gina Miller, was rejected at the High Court in London last week.\n\nThe court ruling deepens Britain\u2019s political deadlock, with Brexit due in about 50 days.\n\nJohnson says the country must leave the EU on Oct. 31, with or without a divorce deal to smooth the way. But many lawmakers fear a no-deal Brexit would be economically devastating, and are determined to stop him.\n\nJohnson says he wants to strike a new deal with the bloc after the agreement made by his predecessor Theresa May was rejected three times by Britain\u2019s Parliament. But EU officials say the U.K. has made no concrete proposals.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said Wednesday that \u201cit\u2019s my firm conviction that we still have a chance to achieve this in an orderly way.\u201d\n\nBut she told lawmakers in Berlin that Germany is also prepared for a Brexit without a deal that will result in \u201can economic competitor at our door.\u201d", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend Parliament less than two months before Britain is due to leave the European Union was unlawful, a Scottish...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR063_bojo_ZG_20190911063545.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
