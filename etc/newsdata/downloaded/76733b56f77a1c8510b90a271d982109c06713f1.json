Rugby World Cup team of round three 1/16 Team of round three From Scotland's demolition of Samoa to France's narrow escape against Tonga, who makes the team of round three? AFP via Getty Images 2/16 1. James Slipper (Australia) Ninety-three Tests had come and gone for the Wallabies loosehead, but it was 94th-time lucky for the Queensland-born prop as he finally scored his first international try in Australia\u2019s 45-10 victory over Uruguay. Getty Images 3/16 2. Mbongeni Mbonambi (South Africa) Mbonambi was excellent at the lineout, finding his jumper on every occasion, but it was his work around the pitch that really stood out in the win over Italy as he bagged himself a try in the process. PA 4/16 3. Angus Ta\u2019avao (New Zealand) The rookie All Blacks prop was thrust into the contest against Namibia early when his team were struggling to break down the African side following Nepo Laulala\u2019s yellow card, but not only did he settle straight into the match, he immediately bagged himself a try that convinced Steve Hansen to leave him on for the rest of the match. Getty Images 5/16 4. Wimpie van der Walt (Japan) The uniquely-named lock led Japan\u2019s defensive charge against Samoa and was dominant in the aerial battle with a 100 per cent lineout effort alongside James Moore, which was made all the more impressive as he didn\u2019t start either of their opening matches. AFP via Getty Images 6/16 5. Sam Whitelock (New Zealand) Captained New Zealand in the absence of Kieran Read and led by example. Whitelock bagged a try himself, didn\u2019t panic when New Zealand were clawed back in the first half and contributed well with the ball in hand. His aggression in kicking for the corner early on paid off with a 71-point return. EPA 7/16 6. Rhys Ruddock (Ireland) Ireland may have been criticised for a drab performance in their victory over Russia, but Ruddock proved the silver lining with a man-of-the-match display that could thrust him into the side for the big contests. AFP via Getty Images 8/16 7. Sam Underhill (England) Another flanker named man of the match, Underhill was England\u2019s defensive heartbeat against Argentina, but also an emphatic carrier who helped set up George Ford\u2019s bonus point-clinching try. PA 9/16 8. Kazuki Himeno (Japan) The Japanese No 8 was one of their top performers against Samoa, carrying well and showing a deft touch with his ability to offload from the tackle. Earmarked as a real star of Japanese rugby, he looks to have real captaincy potential. AFP via Getty Images 10/16 9. Frank Lomani (Fiji) A livewire showing as the beating heart of a Flying Fijian side back at full strength and firing on all cylinders.

Jordie Barrett (New Zealand) Stepped out of the shadow of older brother Beauden to play a starring role in the demolition of Namibia. Scored a try himself but it was the in which he created Anton Lienert-Brown\u2019s score that really stood out, combining power, vision, passing ability and athletic determination to send the centre over. Getty Images 12/16 11. Semi Radradra (Fiji) The star of the side this week. When Radradra is playing his best rugby he is simply unstoppable, and so he proved last week. The Bordeaux back scored twice against Georgia and led pretty much every attacking stats list as the European side failed to shackle is delightful talent. AP 13/16 12. Anton Lienert-Brown (New Zealand) His form is keeping Sonny Bill Williams out of the Test side when New Zealand play their crunch fixtures, but on the weekend\u2019s evidence it was easy to see why. Two tries, the first an eye-catching mazy run from halfway, secures him the No 12 shirt this week, and probably for the All Blacks in the quarter-finals. Getty Images 14/16 13. Timothy Lafaele (Japan) Kicked off the performance against Samoa with their first try, starring with teammate Kotaro Matsushima to tear the Pacific Islanders apart early on and pave the way to their bonus-point victory. AFP via Getty Images 15/16 14. Cheslin Kolbe (South Africa) How do you stop him? The answer is yet to be found, with Kolbe\u2019s low centre of gravity, stunning footwork and Habana-like pace leaving team after team in knots \u2013 this time Italy \u2013 with two tries to kick-start his tally at this World Cup. AFP via Getty Images 16/16 15. Elliot Daly (England) Possibly his best performance for England in the No 15 shirt to date, Daly linked up superbly with Jonny May \u2013 who is hard done by not to make the side this week \u2013 and Anthony Watson in what was a scintillating first half for the English back three.

Getty Images\n\nThis match will have next to no impact on the France game and it was still a fourth straight Welsh win, but the way Gatland\u2019s fringe players constantly tuned over possession and made basic handling errors at key moments was at best frustrating and at worst incredibly disappointing.\n\nIn the end tries from Nicky Smith, Josh Adams, a penalty score and replacements Tomos Williams and Gareth Davies were enough for a bonus-point success, but Gatland will want to put this behind him and focus on getting his main men ready for France. To their credit Uruguay were impressive, never shirking in defence despite near constant Welsh possession and scoring a deserved late try of their own through German Kessler even with 14 men on the field.\n\nWales were dominant from minute one, but spilled the ball with the line gaping. Aaron Wainwright\u2019s drop from a Hallam Amos pass was the most glaring of the missed opportunities.\n\nAaron Shingler had a try ruled out by the TMO for a foot in touch and it took until the 17th minute, but finally Wales broke through. Prop Smith was the one to burrow over from close range.\n\nLeigh Halfpenny converted, but when his team were penalised from offside Felipe Berchesi put Uruguay on the board with a penalty.\n\nAmos then had a try chalked off for a forward pass by the TMO.\n\nThings weren\u2019t sticking for Wales and Rhys Patchell inexplicably knocked on with the atmosphere at Kumamoto Stadium subdued given a Welsh win was always going to be inevitable.\n\nIt was bitty and messy and even though Wales never looked in danger, Gatland would surely have been disappointed with his team\u2019s failure to turn constant pressure into points.\n\nEven with 13 changes Wales didn\u2019t lack for cohesion or intent to play, they just produced errors at the worst times. Uruguay, to their credit, tackled relentlessly and just before the break Wainwright went off his feet at a ruck and Berchesi kicked the goal.\n\nA 7-6 half-time lead would have been far from Gatland\u2019s idea of a dream scenario and Uruguay captain Juan Gaminara seemed to revel in Welsh frustration as he ran off for the break screaming in the face of scrum-half Aled Davies.\n\nThere was a brief scuffle and Gaminara went flying following a playful Ross Moriarty shove.\n\nWales turned the ball over nine times in the first period and after Halfpenny surprisingly opted to kick for posts on the resumption, his long-range effort struck a post.\n\nA second Welsh try finally arrived with wing Adams crossing for his fifth of the tournament. He was given a simple finish from a long Patchell pass. Halfpenny kicked the goal.\n\nWales\u2019 inability to do even the basics well was then summed up to a tee. The ball was spread left and with numbers to spare out wide, Hadleigh Parkes somehow managed to pass forward to Amos for the second time in the game. Parkes \u2013 who normally does the nuts and bolts so well \u2013 continued his horror show by then knocking on.\n\nUruguay\u2019s Santiago Civetta was yellow carded for a breakdown infringement and Patchell kicked to the corner where the South Americans sacked the Welsh driving maul.\n\nThe result was a penalty try and an automatic seven points.\n\nBy that stage Wales had shuffled their pack with the disappointing Aled Davies among the men to leave the field and in the last 10 Uruguay finally got the score they deserved as Kessler sent his team\u2019s coaching box wild with delight. Berchesi kicked the conversion.\n\nReplacement scrum-half Williams waltzed through for Wales\u2019 bonus-point try, but Amos\u2019 late dropping of the ball in the act of scoring summed up a night to forget for Wales despite Gareth Davies marauding clear for the game\u2019s final act.\n\nIt made the final scoreline harsh on Uruguay and flattered Wales no end.", "description": "Wales\u2019 focus can now turn fully to a World Cup quarter-final with France in Oita on Sunday.
