I want it made safe.\u2019\n\nHe became concerned about the effects of electromagnetic frequencies following the death of his mother from a brain tumour.\n\nCampaign leader John Kitson claims the action by Totnes town council is a warning to ministers that they cannot bring in 5G without further research into its effects on health.

No one is being properly informed.\n\n\u2018We are immensely grateful to town councillors for approving the moratorium. It takes a lot of courage to stand up to government.\u2019 Local business coach Julie Harrison, 55, is giving talks to companies in Totnes and claims the Government message that 5G is just \u2018the next step\u2019 is misleading.\n\nShe added: \u2018There is evidence that 3G and 4G are not fine. But this is completely different technology. The antennae are going to be attached to lampposts. They are going to sit outside children\u2019s bedrooms, for goodness sake. The industry has not done meaningful research. Of course, there are billions of pounds at stake.\u2019\n\nArchitect Jonathan Burns, 63, said the telecoms industry was glossing over \u2018bio-effects on people\u2019.\n\nTotnes mayor Jacqi Hodgson, a Green Party county councillor, said: \u2018Our concern is that there will be a much higher blanket of radiation all around us.\u2019\n\nDespite reassurances from the Government, the campaigners are not convinced. In June, former digital minister Margot James insisted \u2018a considerable amount of research has been carried out on radio waves and we anticipate no negative effects on public health\u2019.\n\nBut a US Senate science committee was told this year that wireless network operators did not know of any independent scientific studies on the safety of 5G. Senator Richard Blumenthal said: \u2018We\u2019re kind of flying blind as far as health and safety is concerned.\u2019", "description": "5G is supposed to enable the fastest speeds and most reliable connections.
