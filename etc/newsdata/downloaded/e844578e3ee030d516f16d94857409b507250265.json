It\u2019s one win we need. Hopefully we can get that against Denmark and qualify \u2013 that\u2019s the main thing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cup final, it\u2019s a huge three points on the line, so there\u2019s going to be a big push.\u201d\n\nThe 19-year-old Brighton striker was the Republic\u2019s brightest spark after coming on as a late substitute in Saturday\u2019s 0-0 draw in Tbilisi, a cameo which earned him a place in the starting line-up at the Stade de Geneva.\n\nHowever the Swiss, who are ranked 11th in the world, some 17 places above Ireland, demonstrated their pedigree as Haris Seferovic fired them into a 16th-minute lead they rarely looked like relinquishing, particularly after Ireland skipper Seamus Coleman had been sent off for a second bookable offence.\n\nRepublic of Ireland striker Aaron Connolly was handed a first senior start in Switzerland (Simon Cooper/PA)\n\nConnolly had departed for Scott Hogan by the time keeper Darren Randolph saved Ricardo Rodriguez\u2019s 77th-minute penalty, awarded for handball against Coleman, and was a frustrated by-stander as Shane Duffy could only deflect substitute Edimilson Fernandes\u2019 late shot into his own net.\n\nAsked how big a night it had been for him, he said: \u201cIt was, but it ended in disappointment again after the last game and the missed chances.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing because I felt I could have done a bit more, maybe. It\u2019s obviously a tough night, but it\u2019s a proud night as well.\n\n\u201cThey are a good team. They pressed us back and it was tough for the lads to get up and play off me. I just had to do what I could, but it probably wasn\u2019t enough. It\u2019s a disappointing result.\n\n\u201cWe put in a good second-half performance, I think, and maybe deserved a draw. We didn\u2019t get that, so we just need to move on now to November, pick up the three points and then that\u2019s all forgotten about and we qualify.\u201d", "description": "The teenager played 70 minutes on his first senior start for his country.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/04/wire-19770744-1571196827-780_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
