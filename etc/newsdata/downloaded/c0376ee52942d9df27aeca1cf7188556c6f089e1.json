They move on from one beautiful young woman to the next MOST times without consequence. They are usually referred to as \u2018legends,\u2019 \u2018heart throbs,\u2019 \u2018G,\u2019 \u2018Ladies Man,\u2019 etc\u2026. where women are called sluts/whores!\u201d\n\nMiley Cyrus' Twitter | Miley Cyrus/twitter More\n\nMiley Cyrus' Twitter | Miley Cyrus/twitter More\n\nRELATED: Miley Cyrus Declares Cody Simpson Her \u2018Type\u2019 as She Addresses Their \u2018Morning Make Out Session\u2019\n\n\u201cI am trying to just THRIVE/survive in a \u201cmans\u201d world,\u201d the \u201cSlide Away\u201d singer continued. \u201cIf we can\u2019t beat em, join em!\u201d\n\nCyrus concluded with a poignant thought: \u201cIf our president can \u2018grab em by the p\u2014\u2019\u2026. can\u2019t I just have a kiss and an a\u00e7ai bowl?!?!\u201d\n\nCyrus was referring to her outing with Simpson on Thursday, as the pair were spotted at Backyard Bowls in Los Angeles kissing affectionately in a video published by TMZ.\n\nOn her Instagram Story Friday, shortly before she sent out her tweet, Cyrus declared that Simpson, being Australian, was her \u201ctype\u201d (ex-husband Hemsworth is also from Australia), and asked, \u201cCan a girl not get a f\u2014ing a\u00e7ai bowl and a morning make out session in peace?!?!\u201d\n\nCyrus received criticism for moving on so quickly from Kaitlynn Carter; their whirlwind romance ended two weeks ago, PEOPLE exclusively learned at the time.
