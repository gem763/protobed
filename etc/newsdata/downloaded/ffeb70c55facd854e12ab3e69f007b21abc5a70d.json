According to media reports, Fisher told the crowd that winning clients was like \u201ctrying to get into a girl\u2019s pants,\u201d among other things.\n\nEarly Wednesday, Alex Chalekian, who runs a smaller wealth management shop known as Lake Avenue Financial, posted a video about the encounter on Twitter.\n\nOther conference participants confirmed Chalekian\u2019s account.\n\nSonya Dreizler, founder of an impact-investing consulting firm called Solutions With Sonya, told industry publication ThinkAdvisor that Chalekian\u2019s comments were correct.\n\n\u201cThe conference content is supposed to be kept private, so that CEOs can be candid about internal business opportunities and challenges,\u201d Dreizler said. \u201cSince this content is not about business issues, I\u2019m choosing to break that code of privacy to confirm that the comments from the stage were indeed outrageous.\u201d\n\nBut in an interview with Bloomberg News after the social media backlash began, Fisher claimed to be confused. \u201cI have given a lot of talks, a lot of times, in a lot of places and said stuff like this and never gotten that type of response,\u201d Fisher said.\n\nHe also said that he thought his comments were taken out of context and added, \u201cmostly the audience understands what I am saying.\u201d\n\nBloomberg also obtained a recording of a talk Fisher gave last year, in which he said it\u2019s \u201cthe most stupid thing\u201d an asset manager can do is to \u201cbrag about performance in a direct mail piece,\u201d which is \u201ca little bit like walking into a bar and you are a single guy and want to get laid and walking up to some girl and saying: \u2018Hey you want to have sex?\u2019 You just turn yourself into a jerk.\u201d\n\nFisher told Bloomberg that on the one hand he feels targeted because he manages so much money, but also said \u201cI regret I accepted that speech invitation because it was kind of a pain in the neck.\u201d", "description": "Several conference attendees spoke out on Twitter after sexist comments at an event that was supposed to be kept private.", "authors": ["Andrea Riquier"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT028_fisher_ZG_20191010091319.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
