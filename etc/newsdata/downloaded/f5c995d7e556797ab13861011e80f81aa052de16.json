Rose gave a performance tonight\u2026 my goodness. Someone\u2019s got to get hold of that guy.\n\n'He was shocking, abysmal. I think he\u2019ll be the same in another three or four years. Some players don\u2019t learn from their mistakes. That\u2019s the biggest problem. At the highest level you will suffer for it.'\n\nSouthgate admitted his side were dealt a reality check but ordered an immediate response from the Three Lions.\n\n'In terms of a wake up call we have had a lot of plaudits but there is a lot of work to be done to be a really top team \u2013 tonight was clear evidence of that.\n\nGareth Southgate said his side were dealt a reality check but ordered an immediate response\n\n\u2018Clearly that is not a night we wanted to be a part of. We did not play well enough, we conceded possession too cheaply, we did not create chances, we did not take good chances and we were too open out of possession, we gave the ball away,\u2019 said Southgate.\n\n\u2018We have to respond in the right way, we have a couple of days to prepare and we have to reward our supporters with a better performance. There were not many positives. We accept defeat, and accept we have to be better than we were. We weren\u2019t good enough.\n\n\u2018It is going to be an interesting couple of days because we have not had a result like that or a performance like that and we will learn a lot about ourselves over the next 48 to 72 hours.\n\n\u2018We have to respond in the right way.\u2019", "description": "England's sloppy defending for both goals didn't go unnoticed and Keane was quick to point the finger at the Tottenham man for losing his concentration on multiple occasions.", "authors": ["Sam Mcevoy For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/22/19609582-0-image-a-30_1570831133504.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
