Early this year he could afford no more than R5 000 per month to pay his enormous VBS debt. Last month he suddenly had R1m and this week he had another R2m to throw at the problem. Where he got it, no one knows.\n\nEarly this year Brian Shivambu, brother of EFF deputy president Floyd Shivambu, begged the liquidator of VBS Mutual Bank to give him incredible leeway in repaying his R4.4m indebtedness to the bank.\n\nThrough his company Sgameka Projects he owed R1 580 154 on a mortgage from 2016 and R2 785 781 on a 2017 loan facility from the doomed bank. This was in January when liquidator Anoosh Rooplal came knocking for repayment.\n\nThese loans are separate from another R16m that flowed through other VBS accounts belonging to Sgameka.\n\nThe mortgage was to buy a house for the Shivamvu brothers\u2019 parents, while the loan was ostensibly to fund a wine bar.\n\n\n\nThrough his lawyers, Shivambu asked Rooplal if he could repay the loan debt at R5 000 per month \u2013 significantly less than the interest accruing on the balances or the terms of the mortgage which called for repayment of R190 637 per month.\n\n\"Our client can only afford this amount in the interim,\" Shivambu's lawyers wrote on February 27 in a letter contained in liquidation court papers.\n\nREAD | Brian Shivambu must pay R1.8m to VBS Bank's liquidators, court orders\n\nEven then someone had Brian's back.\n\nThat same month as the plea to reduce the repayments on the loan account to practically nothing was made, someone identified in court documents as Musa Shivambu paid R180 000 into the mortgage account which, according to Brian Shivambu's lawyers, brought him up to date with his repayments.\n\nAlthough Brian's lawyers give Musa's surname as Shivambu, his surname is Shibambu according to company records. AmaBhungane has previously reported on his being an apparent cousin of the Shivambus.\n\nWhen contacted by amaBhungane, Shibambu said he could not say what his relationship to Brian was as he (Shibambu) was \"travelling outside the country\".\n\nHe did confirm that it was he who had helped Brian out.\n\nMeanwhile, Rooplal was having none of the R5 000 per month repayment terms requested by Shivambu on the loan account.\n\nHe proceeded with a liquidation application against Sgameka. On August 5 the Johannesburg High Court dealt Shivambu a further blow \u2013 it ruled he would be personally liable for the loan debt.\n\nThis is when Shivambu's fortunes radically improved. On the same day as the court order, his lawyers paid R1m into the loan account.\n\nAmaBhungane asked Shivambu and his attorney where this money suddenly came from, but neither responded.\n\nFast forward to September 9.\n\nThe liquidation application was set down for later in the week when suddenly unknown parties again came to Shivambu's rescue. The full balance of the mortgage, R1 657 589 at that point, was paid off overnight.\n\nREAD MORE | VBS scandal: EFF's Ndlozi says report implicating Brian Shivambu has 'too much fiction'\n\nOn September 11, the night before the hearing was set to proceed, unknown parties paid another R340 000 into the loan account, leaving a debt of R1.3m. This is what remains of the debt Shviambu is personally liable for.\n\nIn court on Friday, Shivambu's advocate, Tshidiso Ramogale, claimed that all these payments \"clearly\" showed Sgameka was solvent and should not be liquidated. He said he \"would be shocked by a suggestion that the funds came from some other source\".\n\nThe court papers provide no clarity on this point \u2013 they show the payments coming via an attorney\u2019s trust account, suggesting the possibility a third party may indeed have stepped in.\n\nUp to the sudden windfalls, Shivambu\u2019s arguments have shifted radically.\n\nWhen he was begging for the R5 000 per month repayment deal, his lawyers incongruously claimed that he only fell behind on repayments \"because they did not know which account to utilise for such payments\" after VBS went into curatorship and then got liquidated.\n\n\"It is our firm instructions that our client was at all material times prepared to pay both the debts,\" they wrote to Rooplal\u2019s lawyers.\n\nShivambu\u2019s other argument was that he is not really even obliged to repay the loan (as opposed to the mortgage) because it was extended with the understanding that he would fund a business venture and repay his debt out of profits.\n\nThis was apparently a verbal agreement with someone at VBS who has not been identified in court proceedings.\n\n\"This proposal of payment [of R5 000 per month] is made in consideration of the fact that the objective of the loan is yet to be accomplished,\" wrote his lawyers.\n\nJudgment in the liquidation matter was reserved.\n\nThe amaBhungane Centre for Investigative Journalism, an independent non-profit, produced this story.
