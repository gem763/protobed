The U.S.-led coalition said an investigation is underway, adding that no coalition forces or assets were hit.\n\nSo far, at least 19 people have been reported killed and hundreds have been wounded since the violence and clashes between security forces and anti-government demonstrators first erupted on Tuesday.\n\nTen people were killed late Wednesday in the southern cities of Nasriyah and Amara. The dead were protesters and one policeman, according to security officials.\n\nThe protests, concentrated in Baghdad and in predominantly Shiite areas of southern Iraq are mostly spontaneous, without political leadership, and staged by disenchanted youth demanding jobs, improved services, such as electricity and water, and an end to Iraq\u2019s endemic corruption.\n\nThey have organized the protests on social media and have gradually escalated their demands and now want the government to resign. No political party has so far joined the campaign.\n\nThe demonstrations and the unrest are the most serious challenge to Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi\u2019s year-old government, which has been caught in the middle of U.S.-Iran tensions in the Middle East. Iraq is allied with both countries and hosts thousands of U.S. troops, as well as powerful paramilitary forces allied with Iran.\n\nThe curfew was announced early Thursday following a meeting of Iraq\u2019s top leaders to discuss anti-government protests that have engulfed the country.\n\nAuthorities say the curfew is meant to \u201cprotect general peace\u201d and protect protesters from \u201cinfiltrators\u201d who committed attacks against security forces and public property. It excludes travelers to and from the Baghdad airport and Iraqi Airways said flights were operating as scheduled.\n\nBaghdad\u2019s main streets were largely deserted Thursday morning. In central Tahrir Square, hundreds of young protesters were gathered, and police fired tear gas canisters every now and then.\n\nIraqi army vehicles were also seen moving in the streets of the capital and in some areas, they blocked side roads with barbed wire.\n\n\u201cWhether there is curfew or not we are going to continue,\u201d shouted one protester in Tahrir Square.\n\nWhen the demonstrators tried to reach a nearby bridge that leads to the Green Zone on Thursday morning, Iraqi security forces started shooting above the crowd from automatic rifles and also fired tear gas, according to an Associated Press cameraman at the scene.\n\nNetBlocks, which monitors cybersecurity and internet governance, reported that Internet access was cut off across much of Iraq and social and messaging apps blocked amid the growing unrest.\n\nThe U.S.-led coalition, which has a presence on the ground in Iraq, issued a statement saying it is monitoring the protests and added that \u201cwe call on all sides to reduce tensions and reject violence\u201d as the loss of life and injuries among civilians and Iraqi security forces was deeply concerning.\n\nCoalition spokesman Col. Myles B. Caggins III, said that explosions were heard in the Green Zone before dawn Thursday. He said Iraqi forces were investigating and that no coalition facility was struck. \u201cCoalition troops always reserve the right to defend ourselves, attacks on our personnel will not be tolerated,\u201d he said.\n\nAn Iraqi security official said two mortar shells hit the Green Zone, falling on open space and not causing any casualties. The official spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.\n\nDozens of university graduates unable to find jobs in the corruption-plagued but oil-rich country have also joined the rallies. Politicians denounced the violence and at least one, influential Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, called for an investigation.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, at least seven people were killed and dozens were wounded in clashes that spread across Iraq despite a massive security dragnet mounted by the government in an effort to quash the economically-driven protests. On Tuesday, protests had left two dead _ one in Baghdad and another in the city of Nasiriyah _ and over 200 wounded.\n\nCurfews were also announced in some of the southern provinces but they were not being observed.\n\nIn the southern city of Basra, unknown assailants shot and killed an Iraqi activist Hussein Adel Madani and his wife. Security officials said masked gunmen stormed the house early Thursday and killed the cartoonist and his wife while their two-year-old daughter, Zahra, was not harmed.\n\nThe well-known activists had been taking part in protests in the city Wednesday night.\n\nNo one immediately claimed responsibility for the killing of the actvists.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Bassem Mroue in Beirut and Nabil Al-Jurani in Basra, Iraq, contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Iraqi security forces fired live bullets and tear gas against protesters in Baghdad on Thursday, despite a curfew that was announced in the Iraqi capital hours earlier amid deadly violence gripping the country and anti-government protests that killed 19 people this week.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Qassim Abdul-Zahra"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/03/aptopix_iraq_protests_65557_c0-214-4627-2911_s1770x1032.jpg?0cda32a6e332560034439dbbaa7d2e7965af97f0"}
