The Senate previously supported an amendment by a veto-proof majority from the GOP leader that warned the administration against withdrawing troops from Syria.\n\nBut McConnell also backed Trump\u2019s decision to send Pence to Turkey and urged Ankara to \u201ctake steps to repair our important relationship.\u201d\n\nDemocrats are doubling down on the need to pass stronger sanctions.
