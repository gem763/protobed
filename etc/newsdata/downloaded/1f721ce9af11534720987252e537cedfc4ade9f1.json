Tough in the tackle and limpet-like over the ball, Pocock excelled in the 2011 World Cup as Australia reached the semi-final, and his partnership with Michael Hooper was fundamental to the Wallabies\u2019 progress to the 2015 World Cup final. The pair look set to be reunited at seven and eight in Japan.\n\nSocially conscious, the Zimbabwe-born back row has raised awareness of environmental issues and campaigned against homophobia and for marriage equality, with Pocock and partner Emma Palandri delaying their legal marriage until the latter was granted in Australia.\n\nPocock will leave the game earlier than some, but his stealing style has placed great strain on his body, with a number of serious knee problems and other injuries disrupting his career. Indeed, this weekend\u2019s game with Samoa will be his first since 8 March after a reoccurrence of a calf issue.\n\nAnd while he leaves a sizeable hole in Australia\u2019s back row, Pocock thinks there are a good group of potential successors.\n\n\u201cI think looking at the flankers coming through, I think we\u2019re in good hands and that\u2019s exciting for Australian rugby,\u201d\n\nScrum-half Will Genia, hooker Tatafu Polota-Nau and prop Sekope Kepu have also announced they will retire once World Cup business is concluded.\n\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve put a lot into it, I\u2019ve really enjoyed it, benefited a huge amount,\u201d Pocock concluded.\n\n\u201cAs an immigrant to Australia, rugby has provided me with somewhere to make friends, to feel like I belong and obviously gone on to get huge opportunities playing professional rugby.\u201d", "description": "Australia\u00a0back row David Pocock has announced that he will retire from international rugby at the conclusion of the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan.
