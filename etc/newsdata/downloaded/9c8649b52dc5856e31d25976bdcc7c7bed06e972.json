Our success here could trigger the dismantling of the coalition in Berlin,\u201d said Alice Weidel, leader of the AfD\u2019s national parliamentary party.\n\n\u201cThe other parties can\u2019t continue with business as usual.\u201d\n\nThe AfD\u2019s success will certainly make coalition building difficult for the CDU conservatives in Saxony, which they have governed for almost three decades, and for the SPD in Brandenburg where the centre-left party has ruled since 1990.\n\nOne of the SPD\u2019s interim leaders, Manuela Schwesig, expressed concern about the AfD\u2019s strength.\n\n\u201cOur task must be to work out why so many chose to protest in this way. We must all be aware that the AfD\u2019s results show we must take account of the concerns of people in the East,\u201d she said.\n\nREPRIEVE\n\nThere was still relief within the two ruling parties, given that a few months ago polls showed the AfD could become the strongest party in one or both of the two East German states.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s results are, in spite of the strong gains of the AfD in comparison to the last elections, a relief,\u201d said Andreas Umland, senior Fellow at the Institute for Euro-Atlantic Cooperation. \u201cThey indicate that, even in East Germany, the AfD remains a secondary political player.\u201d\n\nThe AfD, though, was looking on the bright side.\n\n\u201cToday is an historic day,\u201d Joerg Urban, AfD leader in Saxony where the AfD won its biggest-ever share of the vote, told jubilant supporters in the Dresden parliament.\n\n\u201cWe had the biggest rise in support,\u201d he said after preliminary results put his party on just over 27%, behind Merkel\u2019s CDU which shed more than 7 points. \u201cThis is our biggest ever victory.\u201d\n\nThe AfD has drawn on voters\u2019 discontent with Merkel\u2019s coalition and especially on her 2015 decision to let in refugees, many from war zones in the Middle East and Africa.\n\nOn the streets of Dresden, whose historical centre is still being renovated after it was almost completely obliterated shortly before the end of World War Two, the mood was more subdued.\n\nFritz Busch, 82, a CDU voter born in Dresden who was 8 years old when the city was firebombed, said he was worried the backlash against Merkel\u2019s 2015 decision was tearing at German democracy.\n\nAlternative for Germany (AfD) supporters react during an election campaign event ahead of the upcoming Brandenburg and Saxony state elections in Koenigs Wusterhausen, Germany August 30, 2019.

AfD supporters simply don\u2019t get this\u201d.\n\nAt the central train station at the other end of the city, one refugee family from Libya was unaware of the elections.\n\n\u201cThe AfD don\u2019t want us here,\u201d said Ashraf al-Haitham, standing next to his veiled wife and two children, adding: \u201cWe\u2019d rather live under AfD rule in Germany than go back.\u201d", "description": "An emboldened far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) warned Chancellor Angela Merkel's ruling coalition partners they could not carry on as before after luring many of their voters to come second in two regional elections in eastern Germany on Sunday.", "authors": ["Joseph Nasr", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425256989&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8107C"}
