Realistically, none of them are near the first team picture, highlighting Solskjaer\u2019s willingness to keep his first-choice players well rested.\n\nSolskjaer knows that the priority for United is to return to the Champions League as soon possible, and playing Premier League games with a rested side is the best way to achieve that.\n\nPogba and Mata are not enough\n\nWith Paul Pogba injured, Juan Mata is United\u2019s only true creative midfielder. Regardless of a rebuilding prospect at Old Trafford and not wanting to sign average players for inflated prices, that is not a situation that the club should have allowed themselves to be in.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

They were at their most dangerous from set-pieces and crosses, with Chong, Gomes and Rashford struggling to assert themselves on the game.\n\nThe midfield duo of Matic and Fred was functional at best. Matic was calm with possession, but offered little else. Fred always looked like he was about to do something exciting, before passing the ball square or giving it away. The Brazilian was also defensively suspect, and it is still unclear exactly what he brings to the side.\n\nIf one thing became clear from the game, it is that United badly need midfield reinforcements.\n\nChris Smalling made the right decision\n\nSmalling left United on loan for Roma in what was one of the more bizarre transfers of the summer. However, the move should at least allow him to play more regular football than he was going to be afforded at Old Trafford. He may choose to stay at Roma, or move elsewhere having reaffirmed that he is a capable footballer.\n\nPhil Jones remained, and that is not proving to be a good decision for him. He has not played any Premier League minutes this season, having been considered a valuable squad member since joining United in 2011.\n\nPlaying solely in the Europa League, as is expected this season, is not a good career move for the 27-year-old, who is entering his prime playing years. There is no upside for Jones on a personal level - the standard of the opposition negates any \u2018good\u2019 performance and a bad performance only sees his stock fall even further.\n\nIn truth, Jones had an average game. He was beaten too easily midway through the first half, allowing Roman Murtazayev through on goal and was lucky that the ball got stuck under his feet and the chance was wasted. He had little else to do, and may be wishing he had left Old Trafford when he had the chance.\n\nUnited needed a leader\n\nUnited laboured to their 1-0 win, and struggled badly to dominate the game in the manner expected of them. Although they created a few chances they were not down to good play, nor were they taken (save for Greenwood\u2019s goal). They should have broken down FC Astana with ease, but instead looked bereft of ideas after just 15 minutes.\n\nWhat they needed was a leader. Not necessarily a Rio Ferdinand leading from defence, but someone to take control of the game and set the tone in United\u2019s favour. They needed someone to demand the ball and lead by example - someone to inspire those around them into stepping up their own game. In United\u2019s line-up you would say that man could have been Marcus Rashford, but that is an unfair burden to place on a player who is only 21 and surrounded by inexperienced players.\n\nPogba\u2019s appetite for the ball was sorely missed, and this game highlighted the fact that United\u2019s squad is lacking the right kind of personalities.\n\nMason Greenwood saved everyone\n\nMuch is expected of Greenwood, despite being just 17. He has been compared to Robin van Persie, and there were shades of the Dutchman when Greenwood chopped onto his right foot in the box and fired home after 73 minutes. In doing so, he saved us all.\n\nHe saved Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and his teammates from having to deal with not beating FC Astana at home, a game believed to be a banker in the Group L.\n\nHe saved the thousands in the stadium, who up until that point had had their excitement piqued by a failed rabona attempt from Marcos Rojo.\n\nHe also saved the thousands watching on TV, who know that they could have caught up on Peaky Blinders or The Great British Bake Off had they decided this game was not worth watching.", "description": "Ole focused on the Premier League Ole Gunnar Solskjaer showed, perhaps unsurprisingly, that he is not prioritising the Europa League in its group stage.
