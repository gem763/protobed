Roughly two feet of rain has engulfed parts of this vast, highly populated area since Wednesday morning, while some areas have seen over three feet. Excessive rainfall is expected to continue into Thursday evening in Galveston and locations to the south in particular.\n\nMore than 1,000 high water rescues were conducted in Harris County alone, according to the county\u2019s fire marshal.\n\nThe rains are the result of the remnant circulation of Tropical Storm Imelda, and the rainfall totals, including a measurement of 43.15 inches southwest of Beaumont (at North Fork Taylors Bayou), vaulted the remarkably short-lived storm onto the top 5 list of all-time wettest tropical cyclones to strike the Lower 48 states. The storm\u2019s rainfall footprint was not as extreme as Harvey\u2019s but larger than Allison in 2001 and Claudette in 1979 - the other great tropical rain events in Texas weather records.\n\nThe National Weather Service described the event as \u201can incredibly dangerous, life-threatening situation\u201d in a tweet, while the Beaumont Police Department reported over 250 high-water rescues and 270 evacuation requests on Thursday morning. The heaviest rain had moved south of the Beaumont-Port Arthur region by Thursday late afternoon.\n\nThis is absolutely insane.

Do not venture on to any roads in these areas.\u201d\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) declared a state of disaster in 13 counties due to flooding from the storm.\n\nSevere flooding occurred in the greater Houston metropolitan area, as Tropical Depression Imelda traveled over eastern Texas. pic.twitter.com/UxmMltGZxi \u2014 WeatherNation (@WeatherNation) September 19, 2019\n\nIn Chambers County, up to eight feet of water had engulfed homes, while a hospital in the town of Winnie was evacuated overnight.\n\nMaking a major contribution to the unfolding disaster are astronomical rainfall rates \u2014 six inches per hour at times. Conroe, Tex., reported 5.16 inches between roughly 6 a.m. and 7 a.m.\n\nRain gauges just north of Houston recorded about 6.2 inches of rain in one hour shortly after 10 a.m., with a band of extremely heavy rain slated to move into the downtown through early afternoon. A flash flood warning was extended south to cover the entire city. In addition to the torrents, the complex of storms moving over the Houston area was a prolific lightning producer and unleashing wind gusts to 40 to 50 mph.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in school, if you\u2019re at work, [if] you\u2019re at home, stay there. If you are on the road look out for high water and if possible pull over to a safe place,\u201d tweeted Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner. Metro rail and bus services in the Houston area shut down by midday Thursday due to the widespread flooding.\n\nGeorge Bush Intercontinental Airport, just north of downtown Houston, recorded 2.08 inches of rain in just 27 minutes late Thursday morning and over 9 inches overall through the afternoon, making it the 5th wettest day on record. Flooding on the road leading to the terminals effectively turned the airport into an island by midday Thursday, although terminals were open and runways were not flooded.\n\nReports of flooding mounted in bayous on the north and east side of the city into the early afternoon.\n\nALL METRO BUS SERVICES SUSPENDED due to flooding in the Houston area.

Radar estimates an area about 20 miles across and 40 miles long \u2014 about a dozen times larger than Washington, D.C. \u2014 picked up two feet of rain or more. The majority of this rain came down in only 12 to 18 hours, and in many cases, much less than that.\n\nThis is I-10 east in west Jefferson County. Westbound lanes completely covered.

That weather station recorded an astounding 69-minute stretch of rainfall rates between 4 and 5 inches per hour.\n\nSimilar totals were seen at Mayhaw Bayou and Craigen Road at Taylors Bayou. These totals could climb a few inches higher, as amounts keep rising due to additional showers and thunderstorms.\n\nThree-day rainfall totals have been historic. The weather station at State Highway 124 and North Fork Taylors Bayou recorded a storm total of 42.9 inches of rain and climbing as of Thursday afternoon. This would put Tropical Storm Imelda at number 5 on the list of wettest tropical cyclones to make landfall in the Lower 48 states, and within striking distance of Tropical Storm Claudette, which dumped 45 inches of rain in Texas in 1979.\n\n72hr RAINFALL from #Imelda (through 1 PM CT per MRMS) vs. Claudette '79, Allison '01, and Harvey '17. Imelda *SO FAR* is covering an area as large as Claudette and bigger than Allison but falls short of Harvey.

Roughly a foot and a half fell at their location; significantly higher amounts have fallen just to the south and west. It\u2019s a scene eerily reminiscent of the evacuation of Houston\u2019s CBS affiliate KHOU during Harvey in August 2017.\n\nUpdate: We are having to end our wall-to-wall coverage on Imelda and evacuate our building due to flooding. @12NewsNow pic.twitter.com/rQWoGTqGJU \u2014 Ben Parsons (@BenParsons7) September 19, 2019\n\nFor days, forecasters had emphasized the wild variability in anticipated rainfall totals, as well as the possibility of extremely high rainfall totals in some spots. Just two or three miles from the 30-inch amounts, totals were closer to six inches \u2014 or less. The National Weather Service in Lake Charles, La., which serves Beaumont, warned that \u201cany additional rainfall will cause significant and life threatening flash flooding.\u201d\n\nIn Hamshire, Tex., about 12 miles southwest of Beaumont, there was a report of 25.75 inches of rain falling in just 12 hours, with a storm total of 33.58 inches as of about 6 a.m.\n\nThere are no words to describe the rain we\u2019re seeing in Winnie, Texas. It\u2019s relentless. It\u2019s unforgiving. We\u2019re on the ground bringing you LIVE coverage on -> https://t.co/TYCmBA6uYP. #BREAKING #abc13 #hounews pic.twitter.com/dCF7RBtMsK \u2014 Steve Campion (@SteveABC13) September 19, 2019\n\nThe magnitude and intensity of rainfall underscores the extreme, life-threatening, danger that exists across portions of the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coasts. If the rain band jogs just a couple miles north or south, it could bring extreme rainfall to regions that escaped the worst so far.\n\nIn addition to the rain, the Weather Service predicted the possibility of isolated tornadoes Thursday near Beaumont. The powerful thunderstorms spurring the flooding also take on some transient supercell characteristics, allowing them to drop sporadic tornadoes. That was the case near Highlands, Tex., on Wednesday, the shear imparted by Imelda\u2019s remnants adding a bit of extra twist to the air.\n\nThe rain should begin to taper down late Thursday night, largely dissipating by Friday morning.\n\nEvents like this are becoming increasingly frequent in part due to climate change. In nearby Houston, top-100 rain events have become twice as common since 2000 as before. Annual rainfall has also increased sharply. As the Gulf of Mexico warms and transfers more moisture into the air, it\u2019s likely that we\u2019ll be hearing about more top-tier rain events going forward.\n\nIt is likely, once analyses of this event are completed, it will be clear that this rainstorm will have had a likelihood of occurring of between 1 percent and 0.1 percent in any given year. Yet the odds for such extreme events may be shifting, so that what was once an exceptionally rare event is more common. This presents huge challenges for coastal Texas, where infrastructure is not designed with such shifts in mind.\n\nNeedless to say, these types of rainfall amounts we're seeing NE of Houston have a return period of well beyond 200 years.
