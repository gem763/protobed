How did it become ubiquitous?\n\nWho is the biggest player in movie soundtracks? How about some moody 13th-century monks? This at least appears to be the wisdom coming out of the kookier corners of the film soundtrack community. A few weeks ago, the British cinematic composer Daniel Pemberton was reading online comments surrounding his score for The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance. \u201cOne said: \u2018This is Dies Irae,\u2019\u201d Pemberton recalls, with some sense of disbelief. \u201cI was like: \u2018Well, is it?\u2019\u201d\n\nMaybe. According to the geeks on the internet, this chilling, antique leitmotif is everywhere. Dies Irae is a medieval Latin poem about the Last Judgment, set to music for Catholic requiems or funeral masses. The best-known part, which may qualify as one of the world\u2019s earliest earworms, is a spooky, descending four-note sequence, over which the monks chant the words \u201cdies irae\u201d; that\u2019s Latin for Judgment Day, or more directly \u201cthe day of wrath\u201d. That might not sound like box-office dynamite, but the tune has been reused for centuries since appearing in requiems by Mozart and Verdi. According to online commentators such as Vox\u2019s Bridgett Henwood, composer, arranger and blogger Brian LaGuardia and HowStuffWorks\u2019 The Soundtrack Show podcast, it can be heard in many hit movies.\n\nYou can pick it out in the more sombre, funereal and spooky bits of The Shining (Wendy Carlos\u2019s main theme pretty much reproduces it wholly), as well as Star Wars: A New Hope (weaved into John Williams\u2019s score when Luke discovers Uncle Owen has been offed by stormtroopers), It\u2019s a Wonderful Life (George begs for his life on the snowy bridge) and The Lion King when Scar orders the hyenas to kill Simba. Enthusiastic commentators also reckon they have found it in scores such as The Exorcist, Game of Thrones, Lost and Jaws.\n\nSo, are movies caught in an aural Groundhog Day of Wrath? Perhaps. The British choral composer, conductor and singer Bob Chilcott conducted the Verdi Requiem at the Royal Albert Hall earlier this year, and understands the music\u2019s enduring power. \u201cIt\u2019s about judgment, about the end of the world,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you believe what it says, then we\u2019re all stuffed.\u201d\n\nPemberton is more circumspect. He says he didn\u2019t consciously quote the phrase, and is sceptical as to whether quite so many of his colleagues have drawn on it, too. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about a sequence of notes that are very close together,\u201d he explains, playing a little over the phone. \u201cThese are not unbelievably unusual notes to use. It\u2019s not surprising that a lot of composers are using them in their work.\u201d One day perhaps, the good Lord will judge us all \u2013 film composers included \u2013 and find us wanting, but that day might not be here just yet, despite what you read online.", "description": "From The Shining to The Lion King, the haunting tones of Dies Irae crop up in many TV shows and films.
