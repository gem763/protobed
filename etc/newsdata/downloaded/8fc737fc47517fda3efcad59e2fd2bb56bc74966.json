(Jeenah Moon/For The Washington Post)\n\nWhen the National Rifle Association needed more legal firepower in New York state last year, the gun rights group brought aboard an unlikely lawyer: a Democrat who had no experience in Second Amendment litigation.\n\nBy this spring, William Brewer III had emerged as a top counselor to NRA chief executive Wayne LaPierre and a victor \u2014 for now, at least \u2014 in a civil war that he helped set in motion and that is ripping apart the powerful gun lobby.\n\nThe ugly public fight has led to an exodus of high-level officials and warring accusations of financial impropriety. At the center of the fray is Brewer, a brash lawyer who has drawn ethics complaints and has a reputation for escalating disputes into pricey legal battles.\n\nSeveral NRA veterans accuse Brewer of instigating an almost Shakespearean feud to protect his bottom line and growing influence. According to internal board correspondence, his small law firm billed $24 million in fees in 13 months \u2014 leading top NRA board members to demand early this year that the organization stop paying until they could review the bills.\n\nBut LaPierre sided with Brewer, saying that the lawyer\u2019s bills were appropriate and that he was bringing long-overdue scrutiny to the nonprofit group\u2019s workings.\n\n\u201cThe NRA has full confidence in Bill Brewer and his law firm,\u201d LaPierre said in a statement. \u201cThe firm is creative, dedicated, and effective \u2014 and is helping to protect and advance the NRA\u2019s interests in multiple venues.\u201d\n\nBrewer said he came under attack once he began examining lucrative financial deals inside the organization that he thought posed conflicts of interest. His firm said those complaining about its bills have a misinformed view of its work but declined to elaborate.\n\n\u201cQuestions regarding our fees \u2014 which arose almost one year after we were hired \u2014 came only after people, who long supported our firm\u2019s work, themselves came under scrutiny for their conduct,\u201d Brewer said in a wide-ranging interview last week, sitting in his suite on the 59th floor of his Dallas office with soaring views of the city.\n\n[NRA money flowed to board members amid allegedly lavish spending by top officials and vendors]\n\nToday, after helping to jettison NRA president Oliver North, rival lawyers and other key NRA lieutenants, Brewer counsels LaPierre on some of the group\u2019s most important decisions, including legal strategy, management and public relations, said multiple people familiar with his role.\n\nThose who have been pushed out shared a common concern: that Brewer ran up excessive fees and then cemented his role by overstating claims about the organization\u2019s legal jeopardy and the potential conflicts of his critics, according to the people and internal documents.\n\nWith Brewer\u2019s backing, LaPierre this spring turned against Ackerman McQueen, the marketing firm that had been the NRA\u2019s image maker for more than three decades \u2014 a company run by Brewer\u2019s own father-in-law and brother-in-law.\n\n\u201cMr. Brewer is orchestrating a purge of every person who disagrees with his flawed strategy,\u201d Ackerman McQueen said in a statement.\n\nBrewer rejected that. \u201cThe truth is, a handful of faithless fiduciaries tried to \u2018purge\u2019 the NRA of its elected leadership by extorting Wayne LaPierre,\u201d he said. \u201cThey failed.\u201d\n\nBrewer, whose eponymous law firm also has an office in New York, has a history of confrontational and high-priced legal fights, according to former employees and lawyers who encountered him in cases and a review of thousands of pages of court records.\n\nTed Lyon, a personal injury lawyer in Dallas who has battled Brewer in the past, said he was shocked that Brewer had \u201cconvinced the NRA that he was some type of star litigator.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, a Texas judge sanctioned Brewer, finding that he took actions that could have improperly tainted a jury pool. The court found Brewer\u2019s attempts \u201cto avoid responsibility and accountability for his conduct to be at the very least unpersuasive and at the worst in bad faith, unprofessional, and unethical,\u201d the judge wrote.\n\nFour lawyers\u2019 associations filed a friend-of-the-court argument in August in favor of the punishment.\n\nCiting the sanctity of the promise of a fair trial, the legal groups said they \u201ccan imagine nothing . . . more poisonous to this ancient ideal than William A. Brewer III\u2019s behavior.\u201d\n\nBrewer, who has appealed, says his firm represents \u201cour clients ethically but zealously.\u201d He said he is disappointed that his peers have lined up against him.\n\nBut, he added, \u201cit\u2019s not the first time we\u2019ve stood alone.\u201d\n\nAn unusual choice\n\nBrewer, 67, does not have the typical profile of a lawyer for the NRA, one of President Trump\u2019s staunchest allies. Campaign filings show that he has donated to numerous Democrats, including Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Beto O\u2019Rourke.\n\nBut in March 2018, the NRA was dealing with a challenge by New York state officials to its Carry Guard insurance, which provides coverage to firearms owners who shoot someone and claim self-defense. The state Financial Services Department found that the NRA had illegally marketed what critics call \u201cmurder insurance.\u201d Insurers, facing millions in state fines, demand that the organization cover the penalty.\n\nThe NRA wanted a lawyer with ties to New York Democrats. Steve Hart, the NRA board\u2019s lawyer, enlisted Brewer, according to people familiar with his involvement. Hart did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhen New York officials warned financial institutions and insurers that a relationship with the NRA could harm their corporate reputations and jeopardize public safety,Brewer urged the NRA to sue the state, arguing that state officials were targeting an advocacy group whose views differed from their own.\n\nFrom there, Brewer pressed to take on other matters, said people familiar with internal discussions. That included the organization\u2019s response to a broader threat: At the time, Letitia James, the leading candidate to become the New York state attorney general, was campaigning on a pledge to investigate the NRA\u2019s nonprofit status amid reports of financial irregularities.\n\nBrewer said he recommended to LaPierre that he prepare by auditing the group\u2019s spending and vendor contracts, including those of Ackerman McQueen, its largest. For 38 years, the Oklahoma City-based advertising agency had served as a powerful adjunct to the NRA, promoting the group\u2019s combative, no-compromise stance on gun rights.\n\nThe inquiry put him on a collision course with his father-in-law, Angus McQueen, who founded the firm \u2014 another larger-than-life figure of the same generation, who died in July. Brewer said he did not view the matter as a conflict of interest.\n\nBrewer said people within the NRA began raising questions about Ackerman\u2019s billing and its hiring of the group\u2019s officials, such as North. North had a multimillion-dollar contract to host a series produced by the firm, documents show.\n\nA lawyer for North declined to comment.\n\nThe McQueens grew suspicious of Brewer\u2019s questions and worried that he sought to take over some of the firm\u2019s public relations business, according to people familiar with their views.\n\nIn a statement, Ackerman McQueen accused Brewer of \u201cpursuing a personal vendetta against his own family and their business.\u201d The firm said it has cooperated with every audit requested by the NRA and never overcharged the group, adding that LaPierre approved all expenses.\n\nThe company alleges that Brewer went after Ackerman McQueen \u201cto serve as a distraction from the failure of NRA executives and its board to properly fulfill its oversight duties.\u201d\n\nCurrent NRA officials rejected that, saying the audit was part of a move to increase oversight. Brewer\u2019s firm said that the focus on Ackerman was not personal and that the agency stonewalled requests for information. And the firm dismissed as absurd the idea that it was trying to steal the public relations business.\n\n\u201cThe NRA pursued documents from several major vendors, not just Ackerman. But Ackerman, singularly, resisted,\u201d Sarah Rogers, a partner in the Brewer firm, said in a statement.\n\nThe audit set off a bitter legal fight, fracturing the alliance between the NRA and its longtime marketing agency. It also exposed lavish spending by LaPierre that flowed through Ackerman McQueen, such as hundreds of thousands of dollars in charges at a Beverly Hills clothing boutique and on foreign travel, invoices show. The NRA has defended the expenditures as necessary.\n\n[NRA chief sought purchase of $6 million mansion in wake of Parkland shooting]\n\n'Rambo tactics'\n\n\n\nBrewer in his downtown Dallas office in June 2016. (Shane Kislack)\n\nBrewer first made a splash in Dallas legal circles in the 1980s, when he co-founded a boutique litigation firm that offered big salaries and imported the brash tactics of Brewer\u2019s native New York to Texas.\n\nBickel & Brewer\u2019s hardball methods drew criticism from the traditional Texas bar.\n\nDepositions were drawn out for days, as Brewer\u2019s clients claimed they couldn\u2019t say for certain what their names were, where they were born or what they owned, records show. Judges complained about overly combative practices that seemed aimed at wearing down the court and opposing counsel.\n\nFellow lawyers called them \u201cRambo tactics\u201d \u2014 a term Brewer embraced.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe we should earn our living from being nice to other lawyers,\u201d Brewer told the Texas Lawyer in a 1988 article that described his firm as the poster child for \u201cscorched-earth\u201d litigation.\n\nWith Brewer and other lawyers deploying such maneuvers, the state bar sought to rein them in, and in 1989, the Texas Supreme Court adopted a new code threatening to sanction lawyers \u201cwho perceive that they are retained to win at all costs without regard to fundamental principles of justice.\u201d\n\nFriends say Brewer ruffled feathers because he challenged Texas\u2019s insular legal industry.\n\nHe \u201cwould do all that was within the bounds of ethics to advance the cause of his client \u2014 and the cause of justice,\u201d said John Sexton, a former president of New York University and dean of its law school.\n\nSome clients, too, praised Brewer\u2019s approach.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked with Bill for decades for two reasons: He delivers time and time again, and exemplifies the highest of ethical standards,\u201d said Howard Meyers, the head of a global lead manufacturing company that hired Brewer to fend off bondholders in a multibillion-dollar bankruptcy fight.\n\nBut some former associates said Brewer sought to maximize fees at the expense of clients.\n\nIn interviews, 10 former employees said the Brewer firm pushed lawyers to generate big bills and encouraged \u201cmake-work\u201d tasks.\n\n\u201cBill was an excellent lawyer from a strategy and content standpoint,\u201d said one lawyer who left the firm in the 1990s and, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution. But, the lawyer said, \u201cwe would do work that I considered clerical work\u201d to meet the billing goals. \u201cYou can always find something more to do. It was a lot more expensive for the client.\u201d\n\nMichael J. Collins, a partner in Brewer\u2019s firm, called that \u201ca misinformed view of the way we manage the firm and its professionals,\u201d adding that \u201call time charged to client matters is scrutinized internally for accuracy, transparency, and value.\u201d\n\nBrewer said his fees reflect the value of what he provides clients.\n\n\u201cFrankly, I\u2019m disappointed some don\u2019t always see the utility in the way in which we go through the process,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s generally not the clients.\u201d\n\nMethods under scrutiny\n\nAt times, Brewer\u2019s process has led to eye-popping totals.\n\nOver the years, his firm was paid $80 million for a wide range of matters by the Wyly brothers, Texas entrepreneurs who made billions in computers, energy and retail, according to a family adviser.\n\nWhen the brothers came under federal investigation for the use of offshore tax havens, Brewer urged them to fight the allegations, even as other wealthy figures settled similar cases by paying negotiated fines, according to people involved in the case and news reports at the time.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission ultimately charged the Wylys with fraudulently hiding half a billion dollars.\n\nAfter the death of Charles Wyly in 2011, the family parted ways with Brewer. The brothers were ordered to pay $198 million for tax fraud and Sam Wyly filed for bankruptcy protection. In 2016, he and his brother\u2019s estate were ordered to pay $1.1 billion in back taxes and penalties.\n\nA spokesman for the Wylys declined to comment, citing a pending federal settlement agreement.\n\nBrewer defended his work for the family.\n\n\u201cI thought we successfully represented the Wylys,\u201d he said. \u201cSome things turned out badly for them after I was no longer in charge.\u201d\n\nBrewer\u2019s methods also drew scrutiny in a 2014 case in which he represented Titeflex, a pipe manufacturer that had been sued by the family of a young man who died in a house fire.\n\nTexas state Judge Ruben Reyes found that Brewer\u2019s firm hired pollsters to conduct a telephone \u201cpush poll\u201d that provided misleading information to people involved in the case and could have tainted the trial.\n\n\u201cThe Court finds Mr. Brewer\u2019s conduct disrespectful to the judicial system,\u201d the judge wrote in 2016, adding that it \u201cfalls in the category of misconduct which is highly prejudicial and inimical to a fair trial by an impartial jury.\u201d\n\nThe judge ordered Brewer to attend 10 hours of remedial ethics classes and pay a $130,000 fine.\n\nBrewer and a fellow lawyer who worked on the case said they were conducting a neutral survey to prepare for trial, not a push poll. Brewer\u2019s lawyer, citing experts in survey research, argued that Brewer was using a widely accepted litigation tool.\n\nBrewer appealed the decision, which was upheld and increased to $177,000. His second appeal is set to be heard by the Texas Supreme Court next month.\n\n\u201cI just think he was wrong,\u201d Brewer said of the judge, adding that he is optimistic that the sanction will be reversed.\n\nTiteflex ended up settling the case with the family and homeowners. Internally, company officials complained that Brewer delivered an unsatisfactory outcome while charging steep fees, according to three people familiar with the concerns.\n\nLyon, who represented the family that sued Titeflex, said Brewer would \u201csend four lawyers to a deposition that one lawyer could easily handle.\u201d A Titeflex official and the Brewer firm declined to comment on its fees.\n\nIn another case, a Texas court disqualified Brewer from a suit in which he represented an heir to the Texas billionaire H.L. Hunt suing his father because Brewer was found to have represented the father. Brewer said in court papers that opposing counsel tried to push him out for \u201ctactical\u201d reasons, adding that his work helped resolve the case.\n\nIn September 2018, Brewer was reprimanded by a federal judge in Virginia, after he did not disclose the Texas court sanction to a federal court in Virginia as he represented the NRA in a lawsuit with an insurance broker.\n\n\u201cThese are very serious allegations,\u201d U.S. District Judge Liam O\u2019Grady told Brewer before ejecting him from the case. \u201cThey\u2019re findings of bad faith.\u201d\n\nBrewer told The Washington Post that he believed he disclosed what was necessary, noting that the matter is under appeal.\n\nAfter he was benched, the NRA settled the case for undisclosed terms in November 2018, court records show.\n\n'Draining NRA cash'\n\nLate last year, NRA budget officers began warning about staggering legal bills from Brewer\u2019s firm, according to people familiar with the communications. Since March 2018, his firm\u2019s fees had routinely topped $1.5 million a month, according to internal documents.\n\nIn a Feb. 26 letter, North and board vice presidents Richard Childress and Carolyn Meadows told LaPierre that they believed Brewer\u2019s retainer agreement was not properly executed and demanded that the NRA cease payments to him until they could discuss the matter.\n\n\u201cWe have a fiduciary duty that needs to be urgently addressed, with you and if you wish, Mr. Brewer,\u201d the three wrote in their letter, the contents of which were described to The Post.\n\n[Newtown massacre divided NRA leaders, foreshadowing split to come]\n\nBrewer moved quickly to demonstrate his value to the organization.\n\nIn internal presentations, the lawyer warned of impending legal threats that he said he was uniquely equipped to address, according to people familiar with the meetings.\n\nHe said the NRA could face significant criminal liability in an ongoing investigation of Russian gun activist Maria Butina, who had cultivated ties to the NRA, the people said, as well as exposure in congressional inquiries into Russian connections to the group.\n\nBrewer, who is not a criminal lawyer, claimed in one March meeting that North could be implicated, according to one of the people.\n\nFederal prosecutors had already told NRA lawyers that the organization and its officers were not under criminal investigation, according to the people familiar with the conversations.\n\nOthers familiar with Brewer\u2019s presentations said they greatly inflated the legal risk, with one former prosecutor warning other NRA advisers that Brewer was a \u201ccharlatan.\u201d\n\nBrendan Sullivan, a longtime white-collar defense lawyer representing North, later called Brewer\u2019s presentation something \u201ca fifth grader might have put together,\u201d according to people who heard his reaction. Sullivan declined to comment.\n\nBrewer declined to address the substance of his meetings, saying they were privileged. But he said he did not think the other NRA lawyers addressed the legal and reputational risks the group faced, adding that they were \u201cassuming away all of the problems that needed to be confronted.\u201d\n\nIn March, North pushed the NRA to hire an outside auditor to examine Brewer\u2019s bills, internal correspondence shows.\n\nBut LaPierre emailed Brewer to tell him to ignore the request, according to a message read to The Post.\n\n\u201cMy office, not any member of the board, has the authority to hire and oversee legal counsel,\u201d the NRA chief wrote in the email. \u201cYour engagement is valid, is vital to the survival of the NRA and is well known to the entire board. Please keep up the good work and disregard this and other missives you may receive.\u201d\n\nLaPierre had been warning North to stop inquiring about the legal bills, saying he had a conflict of interest because of his financial relationship with Ackerman McQueen, according to internal documents. But North kept up the pressure. \u201cThe Brewer invoices are draining NRA cash at a mindboggling speed,\u201d he and Childress wrote in an April letter to NRA officials obtained by The Post.\n\nThat month, the fight burst into the open.\n\nOn April 12, Brewer sued Ackerman McQueen on the NRA\u2019s behalf, accusing the firm of concealing how it was spending money under its $40 million contract. The suit also questioned the propriety of North\u2019s contract with NRA-TV and Ackerman McQueen, which North said LaPierre had authorized.\n\nThen LaPierre took on North directly. On the eve of the organization\u2019s convention in Indianapolis, he publicly released a letter to the board in which he claimed that the NRA president had tried to extort him by threatening to release a \u201cdevastating account\u201d of the group\u2019s financial status if LaPierre did not resign and drop the suit against Ackerman McQueen. LaPierre urged nominating committee members not to support North for another term, board members told their colleagues.\n\n\n\nNRA chief executive Wayne LaPierre, right, and Christopher Cox, then-chief lobbyist for the NRA, stand near an empty seat reserved NRA President Oliver North at the group\u2019s annual meeting in Indianapolis in April. (Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News)\n\nNorth was forced to relinquish his post as president. As he did so, he warned that the NRA was in \u201ca clear crisis.\u201d\n\nIn court filings this summer, the former NRA president said that he was blocked by Brewer when he sought to learn more about the group\u2019s finances.\n\n\u201cEach time that North raised concerns about potential financial misconduct and tried to retain professionals to correct any wrongdoing, North\u2019s efforts were thwarted by LaPierre and Brewer,\u201d his lawyers wrote.\n\nMeadows, North\u2019s successor, has defended Brewer in statements issued by his firm, saying her previous concerns have been assuaged.\n\n\u201cBill and his team operate with openness and transparency,\u201d Meadows said in a statement, adding: \u201cI have never worked with an outside law firm that is more on call, attentive and positively in tune to the needs of their client.\u201d\n\nThe NRA is now locked in legal battles on multiple fronts. Amid the turmoil, seven board members have resigned and some of the group\u2019s top strategists and advisers have been pushed out, including Christopher Cox, an NRA lobbyist whom LaPierre long described as his heir apparent. The NRA chief has accused Cox of conspiring with North, a charge Cox denies.\n\nLast month brought a new defenestration \u2014 this time of lawyers. LaPierre announced that the NRA was severing relations with Charles Cooper, its longtime Second Amendment defender. Michael Volkov, its outside lawyer who had been handling the Russia investigation, also resigned.\n\n[NRA shakes up legal team amid intensifying civil war]\n\nIn a statement released by Brewer\u2019s firm, the NRA chief accused the lawyers of being part of the conspiracy against him.\n\nCooper, who had represented the NRA for the past three decades, said he had always been loyal to the group, \u201cnot to any individual officers or directors of the organization.\u201d Volkov declined to comment.\n\nMeanwhile, the New York attorney general has issued subpoenas seeking records of LaPierre\u2019s jet-setting lifestyle, including his efforts to buy a $6 million mansion with NRA money, and has sought information about why some of his spending was kept a secret from the NRA board, according to people familiar with the requests.\n\nMeadows said in a statement that the NRA has offered to cooperate with the inquiry and called the claims of misspending \u201cbaseless allegations.\u201d\n\nIn late August, New York investigators spent a day interviewing North. Among their questions, according to people familiar with the matter, were queries about Brewer\u2019s fees and growing role in the NRA.\n\nBeth Reinhard, Anu Narayanswamy and Alice Crites contributed to this report.", "description": "After helping jettison his rivals, William Brewer III now counsels NRA chief executive Wayne LaPierre on some of the group\u2019s most important decisions.", "authors": ["Carol D.
