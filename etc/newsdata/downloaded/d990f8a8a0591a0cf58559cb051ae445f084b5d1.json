So, nothing I\u2019ve seen surprises me at all.\n\n\"We\u2019ve had him marked as a player from the first time I saw him at St George\u2019s Park. Chelsea would be the same on that, I think.\n\n\"Of course he\u2019s now been able to have the opportunity to play in the Premier League and display that against top teams.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nMount, who joined Chelsea at the age of six, made his Blues under-18s debut at 14 and in 2016-17 was featuring for both the U18s and U21s. That year he starred as Chelsea won a second successive FA Youth Cup, captaining the side before winning the golden ball at the Under-19 Euros, as England emerged victorious in Georgia.\n\nThe following season, the Under-23s wasn\u2019t seen as enough of a step up by club bosses at Stamford Bridge, and Mount was instead sent on loan to Vitesse Arnhem in the Eredivisie; 14 goals in 39 games followed, with Mount named the club\u2019s player of the year.\n\nHe also took the supporters\u2019 award, following in the footsteps of fellow Chelsea loan rangers, Christian Atsu and Slobodan Rajkovic.\n\nBut there was something different about Mount.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\n\u201cWe have been able to enjoy a great talent,\u201d stated Vitesse technical director Marc van Hintum.\n\n\"At Ajax there are no better players in the midfield, you know. No, not [Hakim] Ziyech either. Mason has everything: work rate, stamina, tactical ingenuity, technique, depth (determination?) and dynamics. He can put pressure and has scoring ability. He can even head.\n\n\"He has the right mentality and he is intelligent. All conditions for a top career.\u201d\n\n(Image: Wyscout SPA)\n\nVan Hintum\u2019s hope of taking him back to Holland were scuppered however, when Lampard came calling and took Mount to Pride Park.\n\nChelsea\u2019s record goalscorer - whose name a young Mount would wear on the back of his shirt - played a key role in Mount\u2019s move to the East Midlands; Ajax had also made a move, but the Championship slog and honing his craft under hero Lampard was seen as better for his development by both player and parent club.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t just about development. With Lampard looking to make his mark in his first managerial role, there was pressure on Mount to shine from the off; he wasn\u2019t joining Derby merely to grow, but to lead a side bidding for promotion and hoping for the Premier League.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"We are always crying out in England for talented midfielders that can link play, are intelligent and score goals,\u201d Lampard stated last August.\n\n\u201cThis is a great platform for him to play, at this club he\u2019s going to get the pressure of 30,000 people at home games and travelling round in a difficult Championship, so that\u2019s great grounding and work for him.\n\n\u201cI think Mason can have a big future. What he can bring us is good quality and energy; we\u2019ve seen it from the moment he walked through the door.\u201d\n\nAgain it wasn\u2019t long before he was impressing and within three months, as he learned of his call up to Southgate\u2019s squad for the first time, Lampard set him a daunting challenge.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s obviously got over 100 caps [Lampard boasts 106] so he said to see if I can break that.\u201d That tells you everything about the esteem in which Lampard holds a prodigious young talent who can already count 29 goals in 94 games in senior club football, who, in the fashion of his boss, focuses on keeping shots low and hitting the corners.\n\n(Image: Wyscout SPA)\n\nDerby\u2019s promotion hopes fell at the final hurdle, with a playoff final loss to Aston Villa at Wembley. But over the course of the campaign, Mount had stepped up to the plate.\n\nIn 44 games in all competitions he scored 11 goals and registered five assists, averaging 0.24 goals, 2.37 shots and 3.07 successful dribbles for every 90 minutes played.\n\nHe also showed a penchant for doing the dirty stuff, leading pressing schemes and winning back the ball in good positions from which to counter, averaging 2.5 interceptions and 4.68 recoveries per game.\n\nHis importance to Derby was showcased in a nine game spell between February and mid-March where the Rams won jut twice in 10 games, failing to score in five of those outings. On his return, against Rotherham, they won 6-1 with Mount scoring once and assisting another.\n\nBack at Chelsea, where Lampard replaced Maurizio Sarri in the summer, Mount has been handed his opportunity and has grasped it with both hands, first choice for Lampard whether Chelsea play 4-3-3, 4-2-3-1 or even 3-4-3 thanks to his talent but also his energy and work ethic, hustling and harrying.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nIn 11 appearances - 10 starts - he has thus far managed four goals and an assist, while in elevated company his underlying numbers in attack remain similar or are even better than last year: 0.4 goals, 2.59 shots and 3.38 dribbles per 90.\n\n\"He was brilliant for me at Derby,\" said Lampard last month. \"I did not expect this level but he he is improving daily.\"\n\nAt club level, his form and the return of Callum Hudson-Odoi have ensured Mount has taken Ross Barkley's place in Lampard's preferred XI. In Prague, it's a case of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu with his Chelsea colleague set to be the fall guy once more.\n\nEngland are well on course for the Euros next summer, but a failure to control midfield during the World Cup semi-final loss to Croatia and the Nations League semi-final defeat to Holland remains at the forefront of Southgate's mind.\n\nWith England cruising towards Euro 2020, the fixture in Prague would appear to represent a free hit.\n\nFor Southgate and Mount, it's been a long time coming.", "description": "CZECH REPUBLIC VS ENGLAND: Mason Mount will make his first England start in the Euro 2020 qualifier having been in Southgate's mind since the age of 16", "authors": ["Alex Richards", "Image", "Eddie Keogh For The Fa Rex", "Getty Images", "Getty", "Wyscout Spa", "Pa", "Action Images Via Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20561113.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_England-v-Bulgaria-UEFA-Euro-2020-Qualifier.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
