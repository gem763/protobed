Certain crops got so cheap that farmers famously dumped them in the river to lift prices.\n\nSome folks even burned corn instead of coal in their stoves.\n\nAt times, the entire countryside smelled like popcorn in a movie theater.\n\nI\u2019m telling you this because a similar scenario is playing out in the pot industry.\n\nAs I\u2019ll explain, companies like Aurora Cannabis (TSX: ) are \u201cdumping\u201d part of their harvest\u2026\n\nbecause they simply grew more pot than they could sell at a reasonable price.\n\nA New Chapter in Pot\u2019s History\n\nIn 2012, a wave of pot legalization hit America.\n\nThat year Colorado and Washington legalized recreational pot. It was the first time Americans could lawfully smoke pot for pleasure.\n\nSince then, a dozen states decriminalized pot.\n\nBut the last year marked by far the biggest milestone in America\u2019s pot decriminalization.\n\nPot became legal all over Canada. It was the second country in the world to legalize pot for all uses countrywide.\n\nCanada Opened Up the Biggest Pot Market\n\nAfter passing the historic legislation, Canada has become the biggest pot market on earth.\n\nHundreds of pot producers sprang up to take advantage of this once-in-a-century opportunity. This has led to a boom in \u201cpot stocks.\u201d\n\nTake a look at the mind-boggling performance of top Canadian pot producers until last spring.\n\nThis is Aurora Cannabis, America\u2019s favorite pot stock...\n\nSource: Mauldin Economics\n\nHere\u2019s Canopy Growth, the world\u2019s largest pot producer...\n\nSource: RiskHedge\n\nAnd Cronos Group Inc., the fourth-biggest pot stock\u2026\n\nSource: RiskHedge\n\nBut after peaking in the spring, most pot stocks crashed 50%+.\n\nMany investors took this as an opportunity to buy them for cheap\u2026 hoping they would soon recover.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing\u2026\n\nThe best days for pot stocks are over. Pot stocks will never recover to their prime-time heights. And there\u2019s one simple reason for that.\n\nIt All Comes Down to Demand and Supply\n\nLet me show you the most important chart in the pot industry.\n\nIt shows how pot inventories are growing\u2026 and growing\u2026 and growing\u2026 just like crop inventories did in the 1930s:\n\nSource: RiskHedge\n\nIn just a year after Canada\u2019s historic pot legalization, pot producers built up a massive surplus of pot.\n\nIn fact, only 4% of pot produced in Canada in July has been sold!\n\nThe rest is being stored in warehouses... just like crops during the Great Depression.\n\nFor much of the past century, laws held back pot production like a dam holds back a river.\n\nBut Canada threw those floodgates wide open, and the market was flooded with millions of kilos of pot.\n\nNow there\u2019s more pot in Canada than folks will probably ever need.\n\nAnd it\u2019s only getting worse.\n\nPot Producers Are Painting Themselves into a Corner\n\nHave you read the news about cannabis producers lately?\n\nAll they seem to talk about is \u201cincreasing production capacity.\u201d\n\nIs growing more pot the answer?\n\nWell, when there\u2019s too much product on the market, you want to offer the best price, so buyers choose to do business with you instead of other sellers.\n\nPot producers are now falling over themselves to ramp up their production capacity, which would push their costs and, in turn, pot prices down.\n\nAurora Cannabis plans to expand its production capacity from 150,000 to 500,000 kilos per year by mid-2020.\n\nCanopy Growth is also on track to produce 500,000 kilos of pot per year.\n\nThink about it\u2026 you could roll over 4 billion joints with the pot from these two companies alone.\n\nAnd many more pot producers will have the capacity to produce millions of kilos of pot in a year from now.\n\nThe thing is, the market doesn\u2019t need millions of kilos of pot. Pot producers are already making more pot than can ever be smoked.\n\nInvestors Can\u2019t Get Enough of Aurora Cannabis (ACB)\n\nAurora Cannabis is Canada\u2019s largest cannabis producer and one of the most popular pot stocks on earth.\n\nIn fact, this stock has recently topped Apple as the favorite stock among American Millennials, according to Business Insider.\n\nLike most pot stocks, Aurora Cannabis has taken a beating and crashed over 50% since the beginning of the year:\n\nSource: RiskHedge\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, most folks think this is a good buying opportunity.\n\nI think you\u2019d have to be nuts to touch this stock right now.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it gets cut in half again.\n\nAurora Cannabis Is Building \u201cGhost Greenhouses\u201d\n\nAurora Cannabis is losing an outrageous amount of money, and the losses are growing by the day. In Q3 2019, the company lost $160 million\u2026 that\u2019s 8X more than a year ago.\n\nThe company is investing millions into new farms and greenhouses spanning millions of square meters\u2026 most of which are simply unused.\n\nIn Q3 2019, Aurora Cannabis grew only 15,600 kilos of pot, which means it utilizes only 1/3 of its facilities.\n\nAnd as I mentioned before, it plans to expand 7X by 2020.\n\nA Dirty Secret Behind \u201cStrong Revenue\u201d\n\nAnd here\u2019s the key\u2026\n\nIf you look at Aurora Cannabis\u2019s most recent financial report, you\u2019ll see its revenue grew 52% in the last fiscal quarter, compared to the previous quarter.\n\nThat sounds good\u2026 but it\u2019s hiding a dirty secret.\n\nAurora Cannabis is actually dumping part of its harvest into \u201cwholesale,\u201d which means it is selling it for cheap\u2026 according to a line buried deep in the company's Q4 financials.\n\nIn fact, last fiscal quarter, the company dumped $20 million worth of pot, a 869% increase from the previous quarter.\n\nIt is doing this because there\u2019s not enough demand from consumers.\n\nI expect this trend to grow as pot companies continue to ramp up production and flood the market with more pot.\n\nMy recommendation: Stay away from Aurora Cannabis and other big pot producers.\n\nThe pot party is over.
