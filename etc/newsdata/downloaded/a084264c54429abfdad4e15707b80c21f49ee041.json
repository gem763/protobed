Islamic State has carried out atrocities against religious minorities and attacks on five continents in the name of a version of an ultra-fanatic Islam that horrified mainstream Muslims.\n\nHe was targeted in an overnight raid, a U.S. official speaking on condition of anonymity told Reuters, but could not say whether the operation was successful.\n\nThe Pentagon did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.\n\nBaghdadi has led IS since 2010, when it was still an underground offshoot of al Qaeda in Iraq. In recent years Islamic State has lost most of its territory, although it is still viewed as a threat. Baghdadi has long been believed to be hiding somewhere along the Iraq-Syria border and the United States has offered a $25 million reward for his capture.\n\nThe raid in the early hours of Sunday involved helicopters, warplanes and ground clashes in the village of Barisha in Syria\u2019s Idlib province bordering Turkey, a commander of a militant faction in the region said.\n\nThe attack was carried out using eight helicopters, according to observers in the area, in addition to surveillance planes, the commander said.\n\nTwo Iraqi security sources and two Iranian officials said they had received confirmation from Syria that Baghdadi had been killed.\n\n\u201cOur sources from inside Syria have confirmed to the Iraqi intelligence team tasked with pursuing Baghdadi that he has been killed with his personal bodyguard in Idlib (province) after his hiding place was discovered when he tried to get his family out of Idlib towards the Turkish border,\u201d one of the Iraqi officials said.\n\nIRAQI FOOTAGE\n\nIraqi state television broadcast night-time footage of an explosion and daytime images of a crater in the ground and what it said was the aftermath of the raid, including torn and blood-stained clothes.\n\nIraqi intelligence agencies had helped pinpoint Baghdadi\u2019s location, the broadcaster quoted an expert on terrorism as saying.\n\nThe commander of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said joint intelligence work with the United States had resulted in a \u201csuccessful operation\u201d, in another apparent reference to the raid.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based war monitor, said nine people were killed during a two-hour raid, including two women and at least one child. It could not confirm whether Baghdadi was among the dead.\n\nA house thought to be the target of the raid was struck from the air, and fighters then descended from helicopters and engaged in ground clashes, said the Observatory, which has a network of sources in Syria.\n\nA senior Turkish official said Baghdadi had arrived at the site of the U.S. raid some 48 hours before it took place, adding that Turkey\u2019s military - which has been waging its own offensive against Kurdish fighters in northern Syria - had advance knowledge of the U.S. operation in Idlib.\n\nTurkish and U.S. military authorities exchanged and coordinated information ahead of an attack in Idlib, Turkey\u2019s Defence Ministry said earlier, without elaborating.\n\nU.S. magazine Newsweek, which first reported news of the raid, said it had been told by a U.S. Army official briefed on the raid that Baghdadi was dead.\n\n\u2018SOMETHING BIG JUST HAPPENED!\u2019\n\nTrump gave an indication that something was afoot when he tweeted without explanation, \u201cSomething very big has just happened!\u201d\n\nFILE PHOTO: A man purported to be the reclusive leader of the militant Islamic State Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has made what would be his first public appearance at a mosque in the centre of Iraq's second city, Mosul, according to a video recording posted on the Internet on July 5, 2014, in this still image taken from video. Social Media Website via Reuters TV/File Photo\n\nWhite House spokesman Hogan Gidley announced that Trump would make a \u201cmajor statement\u201d at 9 a.m. EST (1300 GMT) on Sunday. Gidley gave no further details.\n\nTrump has faced withering criticism from both his fellow Republicans and Democrats for announcing that he was pulling out U.S. troops from northeastern Syria, which permitted Turkey to attack America\u2019s Kurdish allies as it sought to set up a \u201csafe zone\u201d.\n\nMany critics of the pullout have expressed concern both at the abandoning of the Kurdish forces who had been instrumental in defeating Islamic State in Syria and that the move might allow the group to regain strength and pose a threat to U.S. interests.\n\nAn announcement about Baghdadi\u2019s death could help blunt those concerns, as well as boosting Trump domestically at a time when he is facing an impeachment inquiry in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nLATEST MESSAGE\n\nU.S. officials had feared IS would seek to capitalize on the upheaval in Syria but they also saw a chance Islamic State leaders might break from more secretive routines, potentially allowing the United States and its allies to detect them.\n\nOn Sept. 16, Islamic State\u2019s media network issued a 30-minute audio message purporting to come from Baghdadi, in which he said operations were taking place daily and called on supporters to free women jailed in camps in Iraq and Syria over their alleged links to his group.\n\nBaghdadi also said the United States and its proxies had been defeated in Iraq and Afghanistan, and that the United States had been \u201cdragged\u201d into Mali and Niger.\n\nAt the height of its power, IS ruled over millions of people in territory running from northern Syria through towns and villages along the Tigris and Euphrates valleys to the outskirts of the Iraqi capital Baghdad.\n\nThousands of civilians were killed by the group as it mounted what the United Nations called a genocidal campaign against Iraq\u2019s Yazidi minority.\n\nIt also caused worldwide revulsion by beheading foreign nationals from countries including the United States, Britain and Japan.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nThe group has claimed responsibility for or inspired attacks in dozens of cities including Paris, Nice, Orlando, Manchester, London and Berlin, and in nearby Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Egypt.\n\nBut in 2017 IS lost control of Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria, and quickly thereafter almost all of its territory, turning Baghdadi into a fugitive.\n\nDuring a three-year push by a U.S.-led coalition, air strikes killed most of his top lieutenants and there were conflicting reports over whether Baghdadi was alive until IS published a video message by him in April.\n\nDespite losing its last significant territory, IS is believed to have sleeper cells around the world, and some fighters operate from the shadows in Syria\u2019s desert and Iraqi cities.", "description": "Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is believed to have been killed in a U.S. military operation in Syria, sources in the region said on Sunday and U.S. President Donald Trump was due to make a \"major statement\" at the White House.", "authors": ["Ahmed Rasheed", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191027&t=2&i=1445420297&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9Q06W", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
