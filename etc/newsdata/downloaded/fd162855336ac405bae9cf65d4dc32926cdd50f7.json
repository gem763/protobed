I saw my opportunity, and I hopped on it. I\u2019m a 100 percent finisher. I\u2019m going to finish, especially if you\u2019re hurt or I see any slight of you being hurt or staggered. I\u2019m a finisher, so the fight will get finished, for sure.\u201d\n\nFerguson lost on his MMA debut back at Bellator 165 in November 2016, but bounced back and set off on a three-fight winning streak, all by first-round finish. But that run was abruptly halted by Corey Browning at Bellator 207 in October of last year.\n\nWhen asked who he\u2019d like to face next, Ferguson said he\u2019d love to run things back with Browning and build a rivalry between the pair.\n\n\u201cOh, man, rematch!\u201d he grinned. \u201cI want Corey Browning, man. It\u2019s like a callout, so put that out. That\u2019s a callout, for sure. I definitely want that rematch, and we might as well start a rivalry. All the older guys are starting to retire, and there\u2019s no good rivalries right now, so let\u2019s get a rivalry going. Let\u2019s do it!\u201d\n\nAnd after a short, but sweet victory at Bellator 232, Ferguson said he can\u2019t wait to get back into the Bellator cage and compete again.\n\n\u201cI was out for a year \u2013 that\u2019s a long time \u2013 but I got better,\u201d he said. \u201cAs soon as possible. I\u2019m gonna talk to my manager and Bellator and see what they think, but I\u2019m going back to training next week. I\u2019m just staying at it now.\u201d", "description": "After his quickfire submission win at Bellator 232 Kevin Ferguson Jr. says he wants his next fight to be against the last man to defeat him.", "authors": ["Simon Head", "Matt Erickson", "Blue Corner", "Farah Hannoun", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Mike Bohn", "Abbey Subhan", "John Morgan", "The Blue Corner"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/kevin-ferguson-jr-bellator-232-post.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
