They've suffered a lot of loss of lives also. And they had to have it cleaned out,' Trump said.\n\nTrump critic George Conway, the husband of White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, condemned the rhetoric in a tweet on Thursday. 'Ethnic cleansing, assisted and ratified by the president of the United States,' he said.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, left, and Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, met in Jerusalem Friday amid turmoil over Turkey's attack on Kurdish forces in Syria\n\nNetanyahu warned last week: 'Israel strongly condemns the Turkish invasion of the Kurdish areas in Syria and warns against the ethnic cleansing of the Kurds by Turkey and its proxies.'\n\n'Israel is prepared to extend humanitarian assistance to the gallant Kurdish people,' he said.\n\nThe meeting came a day after a U.S. delegation led by Vice President Mike Pence and Pompeo reached an agreement with Turkey to halt its week-old offensive against Kurdish forces in northern Syria \u2013 although there was fighting along the border Friday.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, center, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, right, and U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman speak at a sukkah, a traditional shack built for the weeklong Jewish holiday of Sukkot, at the Prime Minister's residence in Jerusalem\n\nTrump said Thursday in remarks that echoed Turkey's view: 'They had terrorists, they had a lot of people in there they couldn't have \u2026. and they had to have it cleaned out'\n\nA Turkish army tank moves towards the Syrian border on October 18, 2019 in Ceylanpinar, Turkey. Turkish forces appeared to continue shelling targets in Northern Syria despite yesterday's announcement, by U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, that Turkey had agreed to a ceasefire in its assault on Kurdish-held towns near its border\n\nTrump son-in-law Jared Kushner will reportedly visit Israel later this month\n\nTurkey invaded after the U.S. moved its troops aside, abandoning the Syrian Kurdish fighters America had partnered with against the Islamic State group. Turkey views the Kurdish fighters as terrorists because of their links to an insurgency inside its borders.\n\nIsrael has strongly condemned the offensive. Others have expressed fear that President Donald Trump's stated desire to get out of 'stupid endless wars' in the Middle East makes him an unreliable ally as Israel faces threats from Iran.\n\nIn brief remarks after their meeting, Pompeo said 'the remarkable, close relationship between our two countries is as strong as it has ever been.' He said they discussed ways to push back against Iran, and 'efforts to jointly combat all the challenges that the world confronts here in the Middle East.'\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, left, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, speak at a sukkah, a traditional shack built for the weeklong Jewish holiday of Sukkot, at the Prime Minister's residence in Jerusalem\n\nNetanyahu thanked America for its 'consistent support' and said they discussed ways of making the alliance 'even stronger.'\n\nWhen asked about the agreement to halt the fighting in northern Syria, Netanyahu said 'we hope things will turn out for the best,' without elaborating. Pompeo declined to comment.\n\nLater, Pompeo met with officials from the Simon Wiesenthal Center, which works to combat anti-Semitism worldwide. The center said its representatives had shared with Pompeo the 'fears of millions of Americans over the plight of the Kurdish minority in Syria.' They said Pompeo assured them the United States was not abandoning the Middle East.\n\nNetanyahu has portrayed his close relationship with Trump as a godsend for Israel, pointing to the American president's decisions to withdraw from the Iranian nuclear deal and to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital.\n\nBut Israelis have expressed alarm over a series of recent decisions, culminating in the Syria pullout, that they fear portend an American withdrawal from the region. Trump's expressed willingness to open negotiations with Iran, which nearly resulted in talks with President Hassan Rouhani, raised fears that the U.S. would back away from tough sanctions on the Islamic republic. Trump's refusal so far to retaliate for an attack on Saudi oil facilities, which the U.S. blamed on Iran , sparked further concern.\n\n'Trump abandons allies without blinking and Israel is liable to be next,' the popular Yediot Ahronot newspaper said in an article earlier this week. 'The entire balance of power in the Middle East is built on a very delicate web of supports, pressures, understandings and agreements_and Trump is unraveling that web.'\n\nRapid advances by Turkish forces this week forced the Kurds to turn to Syrian President Bashar Assad for protection, and Syrian and Russian forces have already fanned out across the vast swathes of northeastern Syria held by the Kurds. That could allow Iran, a close ally of Assad, to further expand its presence, which already stretches across the Middle East to Israel's northern frontier.\n\nThe questions about the U.S. alliance come at a sensitive time for Netanyahu, who made his relations with Trump and other top world leaders a major plank of his campaign ahead of last month's elections. The vote left him deadlocked with his main opponent, with no clear path for either to form a government.\n\nOn Wednesday, a Yediot Ahronot columnist accused Netanyahu of placing all his eggs in 'Trump's basket,' saying the American president has become a 'flimsy crutch.'\n\n___\n\nFollow Joseph Krauss on Twitter at www.twitter.com/josephkrauss .\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, left, shakes hands with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, during a meeting at the Prime Minister's residence in Jerusalem, Friday, Oct. 18, 2019.
