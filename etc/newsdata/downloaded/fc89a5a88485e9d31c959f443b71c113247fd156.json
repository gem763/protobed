While potentially creepy, it\u2019s not unheard of; For all the existential fear we foist on smart devices and AI, they still require human input to \u201clearn.\u201d\n\nThe real issues, however, are how these recordings are obtained in the first place and whether they\u2019re securely stored, and it turns out Amazon\u2019s not doing a great job of either. Go figure.\n\nSomething doesn\u2019t add up\n\nAmazon claims that no Cloud Cam footage is viewable by anyone other than yourself unless you send a video recording in for troubleshooting purposes. Furthermore, nowhere on any product description page nor in the user agreement does it say Amazon employees can access your Cloud Cam recordings.\n\nYet, as the anonymous Amazon employees told Bloomberg, Amazon doesn\u2019t explain to employees how the clips are chosen, and based on their descriptions it seems highly unlikely the company is simply using \u201cvoluntarily submitted\u201d footage. Unsurprisingly, recordings often include information or subject matter most folks want to keep private\u2014including sex, phone conversations, and personally-identifying info.\n\nBut even if we give Amazon the benefit of the doubt and assume all footage being watched was voluntarily sent in by users, it\u2019s being woefully mishandled. While the report says Amazon forbids employees to use their smartphones in facilities where the footage is watched, Bloomberg\u2019s sources refute this, and even claim that footage is shared between employees and often makes its way onto the internet.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing, though: while alarming for customers, Bloomberg\u2019s report isn\u2019t surprising. I say this not to admonish Cloud Cam users or diminish Amazon\u2019s culpability\u2014the company clearly isn\u2019t being fully honest with its customers\u2014but there\u2019s a pattern, here. We know Amazon uses recordings to train its AI products, including Alexa devices and Ring security cameras, whether or not users were aware of it; the Could Cam is just the latest example.\n\nHow to make your Amazon AI products more secure\n\nTo be fair, Amazon isn\u2019t the only company guilty of mishandling user recordings. However, other companies Google and Apple have discontinued similar \u201ctraining\u201d methods for its AI-driven products and have expanded their privacy controls due to user outcry and government suspicion. Amazon has capitulated to giving users more control over their Alexa voice recordings, but the company has been routinely outed for how poorly it handles user privacy. There are ways to mitigate potential security concerns, however:\n\nAs we suggested for Ring camera users, always install your Cloud Cam in a place you don\u2019t mind being seen by others. Avoid areas like bedrooms and bathrooms unless, for whatever reason, it\u2019s absolutely mandatory you have a security camera present.\n\nIf possible, disable the device(s) while you\u2019re home during the day. Otherwise, tape those suckers up when you don\u2019t want something recorded.\n\nIf you ever have to send in a clip for review, be selective about what you send, and always assume someone is going to look through the footage. The wisest thing is to simply not send in any footage at all.\n\nIf you have an Alexa device: update your security settings, opt-out of letting your data be accessible to Amazon, and routinely delete your Alexa voice history.\n\nOther options\n\nIf you can\u2019t be bothered to micromanage your devices and recordings, or you\u2019re wary of the constant report of lacklustre privacy protocols, just don\u2019t use Amazon\u2019s products.\n\nAs I said earlier, Google and Apple have stopped some of their own human-based AI training programs. That\u2019s in no way full-throated support for either company\u2014both have their own privacy issues\u2014but they seem more receptive to user feedback and offer a bit more control over your data than Amazon in this regard. Google\u2019s Nest products are a decent alternative, in this regard (though when it comes to privacy in general, I still recommend going with Apple over Google when possible).\n\nFor the DIY audience, we also have tips for setting up your own self-made video security system\u2014just make sure you\u2019re following the legal requirements if you go this route.", "description": "A recent report from Bloomberg explains that Amazon employees in India and Romania use Cloud Cam recordings to \u201ctrain\u201d the device\u2019s AI so it can more accurately discern security threats\u2014like someone smashing a window, for example\u2014from mundane activity.
