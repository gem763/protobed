On Monday, Parliament passed legislation making it illegal for Johnson to take the U.K. out of the European Union without an agreement or the consent of lawmakers on the October 31 Brexit deadline.\n\nThe ruling overturned an earlier decision by a Scottish court not to challenge the legality of the prorogation.\n\n\"We are disappointed by today's decision, and will appeal to the UK Supreme Court,\" the prime minister's office said in response to the ruling.\n\nThe court called for Parliament to be recalled by Friday at the latest, BBC News reported.", "description": "Decision to suspend legislative body was motivated by the \"improper purpose of stymying Parliament,\" the court says", "authors": ["Haley Ott"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/09/778e1668-5a3a-4f1d-974c-e597d79b59a0/thumbnail/1200x630g8/7b682c981f6dbd74dcd81fdbf58d5b53/gettyimages-1166069804.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
