The sheer number of upcoming streaming services available \u2014 HBO Max, Disney+, Peacock, etc. \u2014 and the bundling that\u2019s beginning to happen (think: Verizon subscribers getting Disney+) are making it feel, more than ever, like we\u2019ve gone back to the bad old days of cable packages. And maybe we have. Further away from the spotlight, another set of wars is happening for the future of live television: Twitch, Mixer, YouTube, and now Caffeine are fighting over online audiences for the right to lock them into a vertically integrated ecosystem.\n\nCaffeine is a live-streaming platform, entering a market that\u2019s already crowded with companies vying for eyeballs. But what makes them different is their technology, their idea of who they want on their service, and their focus on doing everything that Twitch can\u2019t; the point is to build live TV for the kids who haven\u2019t really grown up with it.\n\nWhich means these are really just skirmishes in a proxy war \u2014 Twitch representing Amazon, Mixer battling on behalf of Microsoft, YouTube fighting for Google, and Caffeine competing for Fox and Disney. Whoever wins the most market share will get to decide the culture of how live, televised events will work in the future.\n\nRecently, Ben Keighran and Brian Howell \u2014 the World of Warcraft-playing founder / CEO of Caffeine and its VP of Marketing and Community, respectively \u2014 stopped by the Vox Media offices to explain a little more about Caffeine, the newest entrant. Keighran and Howell were there to announce the news that Offset (otherwise known as Kiari Kendrell Cephus, a member of Migos and Faze Clan) had made a deal with Caffeine to broadcast on their network. He\u2019ll have a live show, and is set to cast a mix of gaming, sports, and entertainment content to his audience, which he\u2019ll (presumably) bring over to that platform. Keighran has much bigger aspirations, though, and sees Offset\u2019s acquisition as something transformative and defining about Caffeine, its ethos, and its goals.\n\nThe point is to build live TV for the kids who haven\u2019t really grown up with it\n\n\u201cHe plays Call of Duty. And he\u2019s also going to be doing some entertainment streams. And he\u2019s also going to do some sports stuff as well,\u201d says Keighran, noting that Caffeine had also brought over rapper The Game and the sludgy Soundcloud star Lil Xan. \u201cThey\u2019re really at this intersection of gaming, sports, and entertainment,\u201d said Keighran. \u201cAnd I think much more appealing to the broadest possible demographic for Gen Z.\u201d\n\nKeighran thinks he can hook the youths with live TV. \u201cReally the most valuable thing on the cable network is live content. It\u2019s what sells live cable packages,\u201d he says. And he\u2019s focused on Twitch. \u201cTwitch is the biggest person in live streaming and gaming and they desperately want to be the place for all of your live TV,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s why you hear them trying to do an NBA deal, or a Thursday Night Football deal. But all the top content is hardcore gamers. Not even entertainment gamers, but like hardcore gamers.\u201d Caffeine, in other words, is trying to be everything Twitch isn\u2019t.\n\nCaffeine entered the market last year, and has been rolling along in beta ever since. Right now it exists as a website, a mobile app, a set of broadcasting tools, and a suite of studios in LA that currently create a couple Caffeine original shows. As Keighran takes pains to emphasize, the experience is aimed squarely at 13 to 25-year-olds, and is currently one of the top 100 apps on Apple\u2019s App Store in the entertainment category. (He declined to share broadcasting or viewership numbers.) Perhaps more important: the company raised $100 million from 21st Century Fox, and Fox Corp. CEO Lachlan Murdoch has a seat on the board. To understand why Caffeine is important, why it\u2019s entering the market now, and what it plans to do, it\u2019s helpful to start there.\n\nCaffeine\u2019s pitch is that it\u2019s a place for entertainment: the idea is to attract top talent from places like Instagram, Twitch, and YouTube, who\u2019ll then bring their audiences to the platform. The proposition seems to be that broadcasters on Caffeine will be able to do whatever they want. \u201cIf you talk to Offset, and you\u2019re like, \u2018well, why won\u2019t you go to Twitch?\u2019\u201d says Keighran, \u201che\u2019s like, \u2018because I can\u2019t.\u2019\u201d He can\u2019t, Keighran says, because Twitch doesn\u2019t have the kind of rights muscle that Fox and Disney do, and that they don\u2019t generally support sports, entertainment, and pop culture streaming.\n\nFox has a seat on Caffeine\u2019s board, and they\u2019re allowing broadcasters to stream content to which they own the rights. (Disney invested an undisclosed sum in the company.) Between both media giants, that\u2019s a lot of stuff. Crucially, whenever a broadcaster is streaming content that Caffeine has the rights to, the people who own the rights will also get paid a cut of whatever is made via the stream \u2014 that includes Fox and Disney, but also any game publisher that wants to participate.\n\n\u201cWhat that\u2019s doing is allowing us to create something that Twitch wants to become, but is really struggling to become, because they\u2019re so... it\u2019s like McDonald\u2019s saying we\u2019re the healthy choice,\u201d says Keighran. \u201cLike, \u2018we heard salads [are] a good thing. And we\u2019ll start selling salads now.\u2019 You just don\u2019t believe them.\u201d\n\nFox and Disney both have seats on Caffeine\u2019s board\n\nWhich means that Caffeine is Fox and Disney\u2019s way of securing their relevance with the zoomers. \u201cThey don\u2019t want \u2014 in six or seven years time when contracts with the NFL and things are up for renewal \u2014 for Amazon and Facebook to come in and buy it,\u201d Keighran says. \u201cThey\u2019d rather have an investment in us, and have us as a new distribution platform for that younger demographic.\u201d He compared Caffeine to the iPhone and then to Facebook, as a transformative piece of technology that upended what people thought phones or the internet could be. \u201cI want the world to have that moment when they really start to experience Caffeine. We all do. You know, we think that it\u2019s too important,\u201d he says. \u201cThe future of live television is at stake and I... it\u2019s just hard to leave that up to Amazon and Facebook.\u201d\n\nThe experience of using Caffeine is also totally different than using Twitch. There\u2019s no concurrent viewership numbers on the viewer side, for one, and there aren\u2019t any user-created emotes. It\u2019s also got much lower latency. The chatting system \u2014 which they call a \u201creaction system\u201d \u2014 is based almost entirely around what your friends are watching; you see their comments first, and then the other comments that have been upvoted, Reddit-style. Keighran likened it to going to a show with someone, where you can hear the person you came with and only occasionally can you make out anything the crowd is saying. The monetization aspect is also interesting: instead of having subscriptions or donations, you buy digital items that come up on-screen with gold, in a quasi-WoW scheme, and the revenue is split 50 / 50 with the broadcaster and the rights holders. (They got the idea from China\u2019s YY.)\n\nModeration, too, seems to be a priority for the Caffeine team. The whole app is built around social discovery, which means it\u2019s easy to find streams your friends are watching or live shows that the company promotes, and harder to brigade a random person who\u2019s streaming something like Fortnite. The company has internal moderators and Keighran told me they\u2019re using machine learning in tandem with the humans. What\u2019s more interesting is that you can\u2019t just broadcast anything without it being checked first. \u201cBefore you can get discovered on the platform we\u2019ll view your stream for a certain number of minutes,\u201d said Howell, the CMO / moderation chief. \u201cBecause we don\u2019t want certain types of stuff on the platform.\u201d\n\nWhich makes sense: if you want celebrities to use your online platform, you have to curate the experience so they\u2019re not experiencing the worst of the internet in real time.\n\nPersonally, I find Caffeine fascinating. The app is slick; the ambition is there, and so is the money. What I\u2019m a little less convinced by is the value proposition. Getting celebrities on a platform is a good way to drive engagement and boost user numbers, but I\u2019m not so convinced it helps build sustainable communities \u2014 because that\u2019s a bottom-up process. Twitch is many, many things, but the best places on the site are often the smaller communities that mimic the feel of the early internet: the ones that aren\u2019t in the spotlight, but have a tight, niche culture.\n\nAll that said, I think that Caffeine has a worthy goal: Twitch is the biggest name in live-streaming right now, but serious competition is healthy, both for the ecosystem and for the consumers. (As though in response to Caffeine, Twitch has recently begun testing a feature that allows broadcasters to stream Amazon Prime content to their viewers.)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not targeting anyone in particular with this, but there\u2019s just a lot of junk that\u2019s out there,\u201d says Keighran. \u201cAnd I want to be able to recommend this to my kids, I want to be able to recommend it to the next generation. And so [that means] really rethinking, reimagining every aspect: the chat, the moderation, the payment model, the content. Like every aspect.\u201d\n\nCorrection: Howell\u2019s title is VP of Marketing and Community, and while Disney invested an undisclosed sum in Caffeine, they do not have a seat on the company\u2019s board.", "description": "Caffeine is a livestreaming platform, entering a market that\u2019s already crowded with companies vying for eyeballs.
