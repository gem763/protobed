And so, the World Cup is set to begin in Japan with the two-time champion and four-time finalist ranked No. 6, behind Pool D rival Wales.\n\nMichael Cheika took over a team in turmoil in October 2014 after Ewen McKenzie\u2019s sudden resignation as coach amid an off-field player controversy and disharmony within the squad. Despite losing three of his first four tests in charge, he guided the Wallabies to the World Cup final 12 months later and picked up a Rugby Championship title along the way.\n\nIn doing so, he shaped a lineup that had been struggling for cohesion into a tight unit for the tournament.\n\nThe four-year cycle between the World Cups has been up and down for the Wallabies, who now have dropped to a winning rate of roughly 50% with Cheika at the helm. But the campaigning-style environment of a World Cup is suited to Cheika, and he\u2019s confident his squad can do it again.\n\n\u201cThis is the closest I\u2019ve seen the team from a camaraderie point of view since I\u2019ve been involved,\u201d Cheika said in a TV interview after a warm-up win over Samoa in Sydney. \u201cTo go through some of the things we\u2019ve had to go through off the field - that tests you.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been able to come out the other side. This is a very solid group, and they\u2019re eager to make the country proud of us.\u201d\n\nAustralia\u2019s wins over England and Wales in the group stage in 2015 contributed to the early exit of host England. That was followed by a contentious 35-34 quarterfinal result against Scotland, a 29-15 semifinal win over Argentina and a 34-17 loss to defending champion New Zealand in the final.\n\nCheika was voted international coach of the year that season, but his stocks started falling with five more test losses in a row as the rebuilding started.\n\nNow he\u2019s putting his job on the line starting Sept. 21, when Australia kicks off its campaign against Fiji in a group that contains some familiar rivals from 2015. The biggest expected test in the group stage is against the Six Nations Grand Slam-winning Welsh squad in Tokyo on Sept. 29, before matches against Uruguay and Georgia.\n\nThe Australians may not have held the Bledisloe Cup since 2002, or the Rugby Championship since 2015, but it\u2019s not all gloomy.\n\nInspirational backrower David Pocock returned from six months on the sidelines to lead a second-string Wallabies lineup to a 34-15 win over Samoa last weekend.\n\nAnd his return creates a selection quandary, with Cheika having the \u201ccompetition within the squad\u201d that he craves with the likes of Michael Hooper, Isi Naisarani, Lukhan Salakaia-Loto and Jack Dempsey available for backrow spots.\n\nBut the stocks there can\u2019t outweigh some problems areas, particularly around the scrum, the goal kicking and the playmaking positions.\n\nChristian Leali\u2019ifano and Bernard Foley have both played at No. 10 with varying success this season, but both struggled with the place-kicking duties. Folau\u2019s absence leaves Kurtley Beale as the leading candidate at fullback, from where he revels in dry conditions but struggles in the wet and on the high kicks that Folau had usually mastered.\n\nIn Samu Kerevi, the Wallabies have a potential game-breaker in midfield. Without him the attacking options would be less threatening, considerably less cohesive and heap more pressure on reinvigorated scrumhalves Nice White and Will Genia.\n\nWhile the pack has been troubled at scrum time, the likes of locks Rory Arnold, Adam Coleman and Izack Rodda make it strong in the lineout. And a mobile pack is also an advantage in the humid conditions expected in Japan.\n\nThe return of Pocock gives Cheika options to start two fetchers, or revert to a bigger backrow and have a fresh No. 7 coming off the bench.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll take him a few games to get reacclimatized to the pace but he\u2019s a very quick learner,\u201d Cheika said. \u201cJust to get him through that time off (on) the back of what\u2019s happened so far this season is a big tick for us.\u201d\n\nDuring a high-altitude training camp before a loss in South Africa in July, Cheika gambled his job on Australia winning the World Cup.\n\n\u201cI know most people would think that\u2019s a pipe dream, but we don\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cWe came second last time and if we come first next time I will have earned the right to stay on as the coach - and if I don\u2019t then someone else earns the opportunity. I think that\u2019s fair.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Adversity isn't necessarily a bad thing for the Wallabies leading into a Rugby World Cup.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Pye"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/12/australia_samoa_rugby_union_65585_c174-0-2813-1539_s1770x1032.jpg?d278b7e882150379ee8a63c6a7ba2242e2c6b6ba", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
