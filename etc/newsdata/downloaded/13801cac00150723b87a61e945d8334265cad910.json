Ivy is able to tell us which embryo is likely to result in a foetal heart meaning we can get patients pregnant sooner rather than later,\" she said.\n\nFrom a workflow perspective, Channon said with EmbyroScope and Ivy, embryologists no longer need to manually monitor each embryo.\n\n\"This frees us the embryologist in monitoring the embryo in a planned and structured time frame. The embryo remains undisturbed and improves the development environment for the embryo, which is really important,\" she said.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nAussie biotech Microba using AI to research gut microbiome\n\nLeveraging Google Cloud to identify associations between microorganisms and genes to predict different disease states.\n\nAI and ethics: The debate that needs to be had\n\nLike anything, frameworks and boundaries need to be set -- and artificial intelligence should be no different.\n\nCSIRO promotes ethical use of AI in Australia's future guidelines\n\n\n\nFor Australia to realise the benefits of artificial intelligence, CSIRO said it's important for citizens to have trust in how AI is being designed, developed, and used by business and government.\n\nSingaporean and Sichuan firms ink partnerships in medtech and logistics\n\nSingaporean medtech businesses are linking up with industry peers in Sichuan to enhance diagnostics and patient care, while local companies from other sectors look for opportunities in the Chinese province's transport and logistics sectors.", "description": "With the help of Harrison-AI, the IVF clinic is preparing to commence trials to validate the use of AI for IVF treatments.", "authors": ["Aimee Chanthadavong"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/08/26/a57d7046-0e1f-11e3-90a0-0291187ef9b6/thumbnail/770x578/da4ca81ba403d33593e278ec30433973/one-embryo_xvXkc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
