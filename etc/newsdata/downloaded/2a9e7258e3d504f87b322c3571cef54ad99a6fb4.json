Cummings (D-Md.), Hillary Clinton recalled that Cummings, at the end of his life, said, \u201cI am begging the American people to pay attention to what is going on because if you want to have a democracy intact for your children and your children\u2019s children, in generations yet unborn. We have got to guard this moment. This is our watch.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCummings was then, as Clinton was now, speaking about Trump and the House impeachment inquiry. Cummings was one of the chairmen leading that effort.\n\nClinton, the former secretary of state and 2016 Democratic nominee, said Cummings had \u201clittle tolerance for those who put party above country or partisanship above truth.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nShe received a rousing applause when she compared the Maryland Democrat to the old Testament prophet of the same name, who \u201cstood against corrupt leadership of King Ahab and Queen Jezebel.\u201d\n\n10:30 a.m.: Inspectors general take issue with Justice Department opinion\n\nThe group representing government inspectors general said in a letter released Friday that the intelligence community whistleblower\u2019s complaint about Trump\u2019s phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart should have been turned over to Congress, and the Justice Department was wrong to block it.\n\nAD\n\nThe letter from the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency asserts that the intelligence community inspector general was right to want to get the complaint in lawmakers\u2019 hands because it represented an \u201curgent concern,\u201d and the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel opinion that blocked its transmission was \u201cwrong as a matter of law and policy.\u201d Signed by dozens of inspectors general from an eclectic mix of government agencies, it asks Steven A. Engel, who heads the Office of Legal Counsel, to withdraw or modify the opinion.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf intelligence community employees and contractors believe that independent IG determinations may be second guessed, effectively blocking the transmission of their concerns to Congress and raising questions about the protections afforded to them,they will lose confidence in this important reporting channel and their willingness to come forward with information will be chilled,\u201d the group wrote.\n\nThe letter is likely to fuel allegations that the Justice Department sought to bury the complaint on specious legal grounds to protect the president. Justice Department officials have defended their handling of the matter, saying the complaint was more properly handled as a criminal referral because the complaint was about someone not inside the intelligence community.\n\nAD\n\n\u2014 Matt Zapotosky\n\nAD\n\n10:15 a.m.: Conway says those who get parking tickets have more rights than Trump\n\nWhite House counselor Kellyanne Conway continued the White House\u2019s attacks on the Democrat-led impeachment inquiry on Friday as she spoke to reporters.\n\n\u201cYou probably have more rights if you get a parking ticket or moving violation in terms of presenting evidence, disputing evidence, presenting witnesses, statements, challenging other people\u2019s witnesses, cross-examining them,\u201d Conway claimed.\n\nRepublicans have complained that Trump is not permitted to have attorneys present during closed-door depositions.\n\nDemocrats have compared this stage of the process to grand jury proceedings.\n\nAD\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) said Thursday that Trump will have ample opportunity to defend himself once a trial is held in the Senate.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFrankly, [Supreme Court] Chief Justice Roberts will preside over the trial,\u201d Hoyer said. \u201cThat\u2019s in America \u2026 where you get the chance to call witnesses, to present evidence, to cross-examine the people who are asserting wrongdoing. That\u2019s when you get that chance, not now.\u201d\n\n10 a.m.: Lineup for next week\u2019s impeachment inquiry depositions\n\nA congressional aide confirmed the next slate of witnesses to appear before House investigators next week.\n\nThe committees will first hear on Monday from Charlie Kupperman, Trump\u2019s deputy national security adviser, who worked alongside former national security adviser John Bolton.\n\nAD\n\nThen on Tuesday, Alexander Vindman, European affairs director at the National Security Council will appear. Vindman was in the U.S. delegation who attended Zelensky\u2019s inauguration ceremony in May.\n\nAD\n\nAnd on Wednesday, Kathryn Wheelbarger, acting assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs, will testify, probably about what the Pentagon knew about the White House\u2019s decision to withhold military aid from Ukraine.\n\nFinally, on Thursday, Tim Morrison, the National Security Council\u2019s Europe and Eurasia director, will face questioning. Acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine William B. Taylor Jr. told investigators that Morrison was on the July 25 call between Trump and Zelensky. Taylor said he spoke to Morrison several times about his concerns that Trump was using the aid as leverage to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.\n\nAD\n\n9:45 a.m.: Kerry weighs in on activities at State Department\n\nFormer secretary of state John F. Kerry said he isn\u2019t ready to draw conclusions about what transpired between Trump and Ukraine\u2019s president but noted that \u201cprofessional diplomats were seriously questioning what was going on,\u201d according to excerpts of an interview tweeted by reporter Christiane Amanpour.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey saw the politicization, the weaponization, of American aid,\u201d he said, as quoted by Amanpour.\n\nIn the interview with the former top U.S. diplomat to air on both CNN International and PBS on Friday night, Kerry calls the evidence against Trump \u201cmore powerful already than what we saw in the impeachment of Richard Nixon.\u201d\n\n9:15 a.m.: Biden, Trump aides spar over roles of the men\u2019s children\n\nWhite House counselor Kellyanne Conway took a shot Friday at former vice president Joe Biden, as his and Trump\u2019s adult children continued to be a flash point in the presidential campaign.\n\nHunter Biden\u2019s role on the board of a Ukrainian gas company has been central to the impeachment drama. Trump pressed Ukraine to investigate the company, and Republicans more broadly have argued that Hunter Biden would not have had a position that paid $50,000 a month if his father hadn\u2019t been the sitting vice president at the time.\n\nAD\n\nIn an interview with CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d a portion of which aired Thursday, Joe Biden sought to turn the tables on Trump.\n\n\u201cI can just tell you this, that if I\u2019m president, get elected president, my children are not going to have offices in the White House. My children are not going to sit in on Cabinet meetings,\u201d Biden said.\n\nTrump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, are both senior White House officials.\n\nConway responded to Biden during an appearance on Fox News on Friday.\n\n\u201cHis kids are not going to have an office in the White House because he\u2019s not going to have an office in the White House. He won\u2019t be elected president, so it\u2019s a moot point,\u201d Conway said.\n\nShe went on to tout issues on which Kushner and Ivanka Trump have worked during their tenures at the White House, echoing a statement Thursday night from Trump\u2019s campaign manager Brad Parscale.\n\nDuring the Fox News interview, Conway also took issue with the process being used during the Democrat-led impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cWe know what looks like a fair process, and this smacks of secretive and swampy to many in America,\u201d she said.\n\n8:55 a.m.: Trump shares Lou Dobbs\u2019s assessment that inquiry is \u2018illegitimate\u2019\n\nTrump went on Twitter on Friday morning to share the opinion of television commentator Lou Dobbs that the impeachment inquiry is \u201can illegitimate effort.\u201d\n\n\u201cDonald J. Trump is an absolutely historic President already, in less than 3 years in office,\u201d Trump tweeted, apparently quoting the Fox Business Network host. \u201cHis record is there for everyone to look at & to examine and compare. This is an illegitimate effort to overthrow a President, not a formal Impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you Lou,\u201d Trump added in his own words.\n\nTrump\u2019s tweet followed several on other topics, including his policy on Syria and the exit of Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) from the Democratic presidential race.\n\n8:50 a..m.: Reader questions about the Trump impeachment inquiry, answered\n\nAmber Phillips of The Fix tackles questions from Washington Post readers about the impeachment inquiry. Among them:\n\nCould the Republican members of Congress who stormed into the secure room with their cellphones be censured for their conduct?\n\nIs it possible to censure President Trump?\n\nWhat is the process for writing articles of impeachment?\n\nRead her answers here.\n\n8:40 a.m.: Republicans seize on Gabbard\u2019s criticism of closed-door depositions\n\nRepublicans seized Friday on a Democratic presidential contender\u2019s criticism of closed-door depositions.\n\n\u201cThe rebuke of Adam Schiff\u2019s Kangaroo Court is bipartisan,\u201d tweeted Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a leading defender of Trump, referring to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.).\n\nGaetz included a clip of an interview of Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) on Fox News on Thursday night in which she questioned the need to hold impeachment hearings in private.\n\n\u201cThat inquiry needs to be done in a very narrowly focused way, and it must be done transparently. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in those closed doors,\u201d said Gabbard, a 2020 White House hopeful. \u201cI think that the American people deserve to know exactly what the facts are, what the evidence is that\u2019s being presented as this inquiry goes on.\u201d\n\nSchiff and other leading Democrats have likened the early stages of the impeachment inquiry to closed grand-jury proceedings. They say transcripts will be made available later and some witnesses will be recalled to provide public testimony.\n\nBoth Democratic and Republican lawmakers on three House committees have been participating in the questioning of witnesses.\n\n8:15 a.m.: New poll shows Americans evenly divided over impeachment and removal\n\nA poll released Friday morning shows Americans evenly divided over whether President Trump should be ousted from office.\n\nForty-nine percent think he should be impeached and removed from office, and 49 percent are against it, according to an NBC News-SurveyMonkey poll.\n\nThe poll also underscored sharp divisions along party lines.\n\nNinety percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are against impeachment, and 89 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaners are in favor of impeachment.\n\nAmong independents who don\u2019t lean toward either party, 53 percent favor impeachment and removal while 44 percent do not.\n\nSupport for impeachment and removal in other national polls released this month has ranged from 43 percent to 52 percent.\n\n8 a.m.: How does this impeachment process compare with the Nixon and Clinton inquiries?\n\nAmid persistent complaints by Republicans that the Democrat-led House is conducting an impeachment inquiry against all precedent and tradition, The Washington Post\u2019s Fact Checker takes a look at how the proceedings compare to those involving Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton.\n\nRead more here.\n\n7:30 a.m.: GOP keeps focus on closed-door proceedings\n\nTrump\u2019s Republican allies continued to attack Democrats Friday for conducting closed-door dispositions in the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cWhat are Schiff and House Democrats hiding from the American people with their secret hearings?\u201d Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a tweet, referring to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.). \u201cIt\u2019s simple \u2013 their impeachment inquiry is just another partisan hoax, and they know it!\u201d\n\n7 a.m.: Trump highlights lack of testimony from whistleblower\n\nTrump went on Twitter late on Thursday night to highlight the absence of congressional testimony from the whistleblower whose complaint sparked the impeachment inquiry. His tweet came as Democrats say such testimony from the anonymous U.S. intelligence official may be unnecessary given what they view as ample testimony from senior Trump administration officials to back his claims.\n\n\u201cWhere is the Whistleblower, and why did he or she write such a fictitious and incorrect account of my phone call with the Ukrainian President?\u201d Trump wrote in his tweet.\n\nIn fact, the account of the whistleblower closely tracked a rough transcript of the July call in which Trump pressed Zelensky to investigate the Bidens at a time when U.S. military aid to Ukraine was being withheld.\n\nIn his tweet, Trump lashed out at both the inspector general of the intelligence community, who deemed the complaint \u201curgent\u201d and \u201ccredible,\u201d and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.).\n\nTrump repeated an unfounded claim that Schiff was an informant for the whistleblower.\n\n\u201cA giant Scam!\u201d Trump concluded in his tweet.\n\nHe also retweeted a series of tweets from Republican allies, including one by Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.), who contended the impeachment inquiry \u201chas produced NOTHING to impeach POTUS.\u201d\n\n6:30 a.m.: Trump wages battle against impeachment with a barrage of provocations, contradictions and exhortations\n\nAs the first full month of his impeachment investigation began to wane, Trump unleashed a rhetorical onslaught.\n\nHe announced that his Democratic rivals are \u201ccrazy,\u201d \u201chate our country\u201d and \u201cwant to destroy America.\u201d He apparently called the House speaker \u201ca third-grade politician\u201d to her face, labeled his GOP critics \u201chuman scum,\u201d knocked his first defense secretary as \u201cthe world\u2019s most overrated general,\u201d and argued that the Kurdish people of northern Syria \u201care no angels\u201d as they faced Turkish invasion and a possible genocide.\n\nWhile his lawyers argued presidents cannot be investigated for murder and threatened to sue CNN for claiming to produce journalism, Trump joked that he would defy the Constitution\u2019s 22nd Amendment to stay in office 20 more years, while dismissing \u201cthat phony emoluments clause\u201d in Article I, Section 9. He repeatedly implored Americans to vote for his former press secretary on \u201cDancing With the Stars,\u201d mistakenly called his current defense secretary \u201cMark Esperanto,\u201d instead of Esper, and threatened to get involved with a murder trial in Anguilla.\n\nRead more here.", "description": "Closed-door depositions are se to resume Saturday amid an onslaught of complaints about the process from the president and his Republican allies.", "authors": ["John Wagner", "National Reporter Leading The Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "Congress", "Campaigns", "Health Policy", "Pennsylvania Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/5mKUGpo9e9wg97qzu_uaJgEZ3KM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DG76DLHWU4I6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
