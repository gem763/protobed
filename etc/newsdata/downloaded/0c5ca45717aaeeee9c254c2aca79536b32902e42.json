Andrea hit a lot of winners and put pressure on me.\n\n\"I was fighting for every point, even at break points down, I just tried to get the serve in and make her play a point.\"\n\nGauff's popularity has soared since she became the youngest player to qualify for the Wimbledon main draw in the professional era and reached the fourth round in July, beating seven-times Grand Slam champion Venus Williams along the way.\n\nShe also enjoyed the home support at the U.S. Open before falling to Naomi Osaka in the third round.\n\nHaving dropped just one set in her main draw matches in Linz this week, Gauff has already ensured a place in the top 100 when the new WTA rankings are released on Monday.
