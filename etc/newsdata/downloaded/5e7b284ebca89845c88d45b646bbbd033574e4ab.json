This is clear in the tournament rules and not new at Rugby World Cup 2019.\n\n'Those contingency plans were in place, including back-up venues. But the rules do not allow for postponements to be affected in pool matches.\n\n'What became clear was the incredible size of the typhoon, with it being 1400km wide only three match venues were outside of the typhoon's path.\n\nScotland's match against Japan went ahead on Sunday and the hosts won the Pool A clash\n\n'We were not able to implement contingency plans that would treat all matches and teams consistently and fairly.\n\n'We would only vary those rules if we could treat all teams consistently and fairly. But we couldn't.\n\n'So that led to the difficult decision to cancel two matches on Saturday.\n\n'We did have contingency venue plans for the other three matches on the Sunday, but they were always dependent on damaged caused by the typhoon.\n\n'Pleasingly of course we played those three matches as scheduled.\n\n'We were consistent with everything laid out before the tournament.\n\n'While we had appropriate discussions with a number of unions, no decisions were based on pressure from any particular unions.\n\n'And it's also important to clarify that we did not have those discussions with Ireland.'", "description": "World Rugby has confirmed it will convene a hearing of its independent disputes committee, in light of Scotland Rugby Union (SRU) chief executive Mark Dodson threats to sue last week.", "authors": ["Nick Purewal"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/06/19723884-0-image-a-9_1571116278776.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
