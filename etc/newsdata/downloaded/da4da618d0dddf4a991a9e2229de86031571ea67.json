REUTERS/Tom Nicholson\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Britain has secured a good deal with the European Union which ensures the whole United Kingdom is one customs union and should provide comfort to the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), House of Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg said.\n\nThe DUP has said it could not support the deal proposed by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, but Rees-Mogg said the fact the Irish border backstop had been removed should provide reassurance.\n\n\u201cIt is a really exciting and positive deal. It removes the undemocratic backstop. It is a huge advance for the whole of the United Kingdom. It will ensure that we are one single customs territory,\u201d Rees-Mogg said in parliament.\n\n\u201cI hope my friends in the DUP will also find that what it does for the whole of the United Kingdom is something over which they can have comfort and support.\u201d", "description": "Britain has secured a good deal with the European Union which ensures the whole United Kingdom is one customs union and should provide comfort to the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), House of Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441846559&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G0XQ", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
