The last several seasons of \"Fortnite\" have launched on Thursdays, although because of the timing of Season 10's ending, it could happen sooner.\n\nIn a tweet posted after the \"Fortnite\" blackout, Sony said all in-game items and V-bucks, the currency used in the game to buy items like skins, are safe.\n\nVideo of the event shows what appear to be projectiles falling from the sky, concluding with a black hole sucking up every single piece of the game, then going dark.\n\nRod Breslau, an esports consultant, said the event drew more than 6 million concurrent viewers between streaming platforms Twitch and YouTube.\n\n\"Epic and Fortnite really have done such an incredible job of creating this entire story and narrative around what would be server maintenance to create what is the most hype I think i\u2019ve ever seen for a video game of all time,\" said Breslau during an interview with USA TODAY.\n\nOf course, because it's the internet, fans of \"Fortnite\" have been making memes to pass the time until the game's eventual return. Even TV series \"The Walking Dead\" got in on the fun.\n\nSo, what's going to happen when this \"Fortnite\" returns? A leak from the Italian version of Apple's iOS app store suggests the game will introduce a \"Chapter 2\" with a brand new map, reported video game site Polygon.\n\nFollow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23.", "description": "It's not technical problems: 'Fortnite' is down after the video game was sucked into a virtual black hole ahead of its eleventh season.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/14/USAT/1a03ca3d-ecc3-417a-bbcf-35b89f839cd0-Screen_Shot_2019-10-14_at_6.47.13_AM.jpg?crop=1205,1205,x0,y7&width=1197&height=1205&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
