USA TODAY\n\nThe nice thing about working in an office is getting to enjoy the camaraderie that comes with being part of a team. If you're lucky, you may even develop strong relationships with your colleagues that evolve into friendships.\n\nThough it's nice to shoot the breeze with your coworkers about weekend plans, sports teams, popular TV and food trends, it's less pleasant to find yourself in a situation in which all your colleagues gossip about the people you work with.\n\nOn a basic level, it can be uncomfortable for you as a nongossiper. On a more serious level, it could result in consequences if your coworkers disparage another employee and word gets back to HR. Here's what you can do to escape that nonstop gossip and preserve your professional reputation.\n\nSaving up: Can you get away with a small emergency fund if you have investments?\n\nSocial Security: These 3 dangerous myths could destroy your retirement\n\n1. Opt out\n\nGossiping is mean-spirited at its core. Though you won't get in trouble at work for thinking bad thoughts about your lazy coworker, you could face serious repercussions if you take part in a conversation that fuels rumors about the source of that coworker's laziness. The solution? Don't participate. Simply remove yourself from the conversation, and if your colleagues ask why, be honest about your feelings toward gossip.\n\nExpress those feelings nonjudgmentally, because, let's face it, gossip is a common practice, and you don't necessarily want to alienate your colleagues by coming off as holier-than-thou. Just say that gossiping makes you uncomfortable and that frankly, you're nervous about getting in trouble for it. In this approach, you're not chiding your coworkers for engaging in that behavior; you're just choosing not to be a part of it.\n\n2. Change the topic\n\nSometimes, all it takes is a little conversational strategy on your part to nip gossiping in the bud. Though this tactic may not work all the time, you can occasionally avoid gossip by taking the discussion in a different direction as opportunity allows for.\n\nFor example, if your colleagues are in the midst of badmouthing another coworker over her too-tight clothing, you could chime in with something like \"Speaking of clothing, my friend's pop-up boutique is having a major sale this weekend. Let me dig up the details.\" Chances are, that'll work at least some of the time.\n\n3. Know when to report it\n\nSometimes, gossip can reach the point where it evolves into harassment or violates company policy. If you don't want your gossipy coworkers to take you down with them, report their behavior to your manager or HR. If you can do so anonymously, that's probably ideal, but if the rumors spread about people you work with are dangerously derogatory, it's imperative that you protect yourself by making it clear you're not part of those discussions.\n\nAccording to LinkedIn, 21% of employees regularly gossip at work. If you're tired of being surrounded by gossip, use these tactics to free yourself from those conversations \u2013 and avoid getting in trouble needlessly.\n\nThe Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.\n\nThe Motley Fool is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news, analysis and commentary designed to help people take control of their financial lives.
