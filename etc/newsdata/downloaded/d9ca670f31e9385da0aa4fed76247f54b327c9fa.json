A 2017 study by the CDC found that 75% of teens were getting less than 8 hours of sleep per night, leaving them vulnerable to an increased risk of anxiety and depression.\n\nHowever, California's new bill has run into opposition by some lawmakers and school districts.\n\nState senator Connie Leyva recently told the Sacramento Bee that she believes each district should be able to set their own start times.\n\nA 2017 study by the CDC found that 75% of teens were getting less than 8 hours of sleep per night - with California's new law designed to help combat sleepy students in the classroom\n\n'We can all agree that our students need a sufficient amount of sleep, and that sleep time is a significant and important factor in overall health... [but] I believe that school start times should continue to be determined at the local level, because it is inappropriate to say that a one-size-fits-all approach should guide all schools or all communities,' she is quoted as saying.\n\nLeyva and other critics also noted that the time change will prove to be a hardship for many working parents who may not be able to adjust their schedules.\n\nMeanwhile, Janet Napolitano, president of the University of California, said the state would do better to carry out a pilot study on later start times before imposing it on school districts.\n\n'As much as I sympathize with sleepy students, we must also carefully consider how the change would affect families and schools,' she said.\n\nPublic high schools - including Beverley Hills High (pictured) - would be prohibited from starting the school day before 8.30 am\n\nAccording to numerous studies, there is a link between the amount of sleep adolescents get and school performance.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics says it 'recognizes insufficient sleep in adolescents as an important public health issue that significantly affects the health and safety, as well as the academic success, of our nation's middle and high school students.'", "description": "The new law, which signed on Sunday by Governor Gavin Newsom, calls for middle schools to ring in classes no earlier than 8:00 am and high schools no earlier than 8:30 am.", "authors": ["Andrew Court For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/04/19721418-0-image-a-14_1571110998762.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
