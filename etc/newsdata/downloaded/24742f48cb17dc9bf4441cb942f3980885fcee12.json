He even managed to put it in her palm while she was sleeping.\n\nFor more stories go to the Business Insider South Africa homepage.\n\nYou'd imagine someone gets very nervous and anxious when they're building up the courage to propose to their partner. Some may even go out of their way to keep their partner from guessing they're about to pop the question.\n\nBut Edi Okoro was so confident his girlfriend had no idea a proposal was coming, he managed to sneak her engagement ring into photos over an entire month before he finally asked her to marry him.\n\nOkoro posted the story of how he proposed to his girlfriend Cally Read on Facebook.\n\n\"I can finally put this out there,\" he wrote. \"Those who have gone through this (and those who will soon find out) you want to propose in a way that speaks to you as a person and couple. Some plan a flash mob, a fancy meal, or even arrange a marry me sign. I couldn't do this because 'Edi doesn't plan' .... I'm a spontaneous improviser!\"\n\nHe said Read would have known immediately that he was about to propose if he planned a holiday or a fancy meal, so he took the ring everywhere \"hoping the 'moment' would arise in line with my spontaneous style.\"\n\nOkoro ended up taking the ring everywhere with him, and then he thought he might as well start documenting the moments. He ended up with 23 photos and two videos, all with Read oblivious to the fact her future engagement ring was in the frame with her.\n\n\"The idea was to take as many photos, in more daring scenarios, until I found the perfect moment to propose, or until I got caught, at which point I would propose!\" Okoro wrote. \"Here are some of the photos I captured over the space of about a month before I found the right moment.\"\n\nHe shared some of the images with Insider.\n\nSome photos were taken in their home while Read faced the other way.\n\nOthers were taken while Read slept, completely unaware that the ring was nearby. It was even in her hand at one point.\n\nOkoro took the ring everywhere - to the shops and out on bike rides.\n\nIn the end, he really tested his luck with some of the photos.\n\n\"We met at athletics,\" Okoro told Bored Panda. \"We both competed at a very high level and traveled to competitions together ... I knew she was the one after I realised our conversations didn't dry up and we bounced off each other.\"\n\nHe said the picture with the binoculars was one of the closest calls.\n\n\"Only because she could have just looked up!\" he said. \"Also, walking around with it in my pocket I knocked into her a few times [but] she didn't notice it was a box.\"\n\nHe finally proposed after about a month.\n\nIn another Facebook post, Okoro revealed he'd finally proposed to Read.\n\n\"We took this photo not long after she said YES ....\" he wrote. \"She didn't know about this library until several weeks later ... My smile is a 'you know nothing Cally Read' smile.\"\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "Edi Okoro basically secretly proposed over the course of a month, even sneaking the ring into his girlfriend's hand while she was sleeping.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9178/bad7c82f198441c4ba9769ca424e948a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
