(AP) - Florida State coach Willie Taggart announced Monday that starting linebacker Jaiden Lars-Woodbey is out for the season with a leg injury.\n\nThe coach also said Seminoles quarterback James Blackman and left tackle Jauan Williams are listed day-to-day as they recover from injuries.\n\nLars-Woodbey, a sophomore who has played inside and outside linebacker, was injured in the second half of Saturday\u2019s 35-24 win over Louisville. He had 19 tackles, 1 tackle for loss and .5 sacks in four games.\n\n\u201cEverything happens for a reason,\u201d Lars-Woodbey posted on Twitter. \u201cJust know that when one door closes for me, another one opens as well. I know my teammates are going to hold it down for me for the rest of this year and I can\u2019t wait to be back with them soon!\u201d\n\nBlackman is 86 of 124 (69.4 for 970 yards, nine touchdowns and two interceptions in 2019. The redshirt sophomore was injured on Florida State\u2019s first drive of the third quarter and was later seen on the sideline icing his left knee.\n\nIf Blackman is not available, to start Saturday against North Carolina State (3-1), the Seminoles (2-2, 1-1 Atlantic Coast Conference) will turn to Alex Hornibrook. A graduate transfer from Wisconsin, Hornibrook completed 15 of 20 passes for 255 yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions in his Florida State debut against the Cardinals on Saturday.\n\n\u201cWhat we saw is what we had been seeing since training camp,\u201d Taggart said. \u201cHe comes to practice, he comes to meetings like a pro, like he\u2019s done it before. He has put the work in to be confident in what he\u2019s doing. Putting him out on the field, I don\u2019t think anyone on our staff or our players felt like we had to worry about anything.\n\n\u201cWe know that Alex was going to be prepared. And he showed it.\u201d\n\nFlorida State has lost two players for the season in Lars-Woodbey and defensive end/outside linebacker Joshua Kaindoh. With Lars-Woodbey sidelined, expect Emmett Rice and Jaleel McRae to see more playing time at inside linebacker.\n\nWilliams missed games against Virginia and Louisville. Senior Abdul Bello has started in his place.\n\n\u201cHopefully he can get back in the swing of things and be able to try to help our football team this week,\u201d Taggart said. \u201cBello is doing a good job for us.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: http://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Florida State coach Willie Taggart announced Monday that starting linebacker Jaiden Lars-Woodbey is out for the season with a leg injury.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Bob Ferrante"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/23/louisville_florida_st_football_97443_c0-181-2129-1422_s1770x1032.jpg?cfb9a4b04da9bdd0e97ed9167aea05b78b8a22ae", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
