For somebody like that to get to meet the Queen is brilliant.\"\n\n(Image: UK Press via Getty Images)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe Queen also chatted to a number of veterans who completed a 100-mile walk from Ypres to London - The Long Walk Home - last year, to mark the centenary of the Armistice.\n\nShe has been patron of Haig Housing since 1952 and was handed dozens of bunches of flowers and greeted by hundreds of local schoolchildren during her hour-long visit.\n\nThe Queen was even given a laugh when one child shouted \"you're the best Queen in the world\" as she greeted the crowds.\n\n(Image: UK Press via Getty Images)\n\nThe monarch wore a cornflower blue dress and coat from designer Angela Kelly, alongside a matching hat.\n\nHaig Housing is the country's largest military housing charity, with more than 1,500 properties across the UK.\n\nThe site in Morden first opened almost 100 years ago, following the end of the First World War.\n\nThe charity offers the opportunity for the most seriously injured veterans to get onto the property ladder and become joint owners of homes that have been specially adapted to suit their needs.", "description": "The Queen had a chat with 100-year-old \"Dambuster\" Ken Souter who flew with the RAF in north Africa during the Second World War during her first engagement after her summer break", "authors": ["Zoe Forsey", "Image", "Pa", "Jonathan Buckmaster", "Uk Press Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20561025.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Queen-Elizabeth-II-opens-Haig-Housing-Trust-development.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
