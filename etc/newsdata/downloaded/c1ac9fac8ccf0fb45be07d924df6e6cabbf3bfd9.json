Pictured: Model tanks at a stand of Rosoboronexport\n\nObservers say Moscow has been skillfully using a combination of arms exports and security expertise to expand its political and economic footprint in Africa.\n\nPaul Stronski, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said: 'Guns have opened many more doors for the Kremlin in Africa than butter.'\n\nNonetheless African leaders expressed warmth over Russia's revived interest in the continent.\n\nThe South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said: 'What stands Russia in good stead in the eyes of many African countries is that Russia was never a colonial power,' according to his spokeswoman.\n\nGeneral Abdel-Fattah Burhan, head of Sudan's transitional Sovereign Council, said: 'We hope that... you will help us, in particular, to build up our armed forces,' according to a Kremlin account of his meeting with Putin.\n\nHe spoke in the wake of an August power-sharing agreement between Sudan's army and a pro-democracy movement following the overthrow of autocratic former President Omar al-Bashir.\n\nPutin hailed the Russia-Africa summit as historic.
