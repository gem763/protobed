However, Sportsmail understands that \u2018Le Crunch\u2019 will be abandoned.\n\nThe fixture was due to take place at Yokohama Stadium on Saturday evening, at around the time that Hagibis is expected to pass through the area, wreaking havoc. The tropical storm is being classified as \u2018violent\u2019 by Japanese meteorologists, with wind speeds likely to exceed 160mph.\n\nEngland's Rugby World Cup Pool C decider against France has been called off\n\nTyphoon Hagibis is being put on par with a category 5 hurricane with 160mph winds expected\n\nEngland had been put through their paces on Wednesday morning with a training session\n\nWorld Rugby were poised to decide in the early hours on Thursday \u2013 UK time \u2013 if the Pool C fixture would go ahead as planned, or whether there would be an enforced change of time or venue.\n\nIt emerged on Wednesday that the initial contingency plan was to take the England-France fixture to Oita, in the southern island of Kyushu \u2013 where both teams will play quarter-finals next week. However, it appears that logistical problems have forced officials to abandon that option.\n\nThere was a mounting sense of chaos and confusion on Wednesday night in Japan as teams, supporters and media were left in the dark about what will happen this weekend. Rumours were rife about disruption affecting four countries in particular; England, France, Japan and Scotland.\n\nThere was growing speculation that both matches in Yokohama; \u2018Le Crunch\u2019 on Saturday and Japan v Scotland the following day, were set to be cancelled.\n\nYet, there were contrasting rumours that the latter match may be put back until Monday. However, Sportsmail understands that England v France is certainly being called off.\n\nOrganisers were considering moving the game from Yokohama due to Super Typhoon Hagibis\n\nEngland currently top Pool C, and would stay there if the game is recorded as a 0-0 draw\n\nIf that fixture and Japan v Scotland matches were cancelled at short notice, in theory that would mean both would be classified as scoreless draws, with each team receiving two points.\n\nWhile that would not significantly impact England and France, who have both already clinched quarter-final places, it would have a major bearing on the three-way tussle for qualification from Pool A, between Japan, Scotland and Ireland.\n\nWorld Rugby have emphasised their priority commitment to the safety of participants and spectators, but they will also be desperate to avoid a World Cup match being cancelled for the first time in the 32-year history of the tournament.\n\nEngland will now qualify in top spot in their pool, and will likely face Australia in the last eight\n\nWhile the governing body claim to have insurance which covers such freak occurrences, the loss of two fixtures at the 70,000-capacity Yokohama would lead to losses estimated at approximately \u00a330million.\n\nLast month, typhoon Faxai caused considerable damage and led to transport chaos in and around Tokyo, and that was not on the scale of Hagibis, which means \u2018velocity\u2019.\n\nWhile Tokyo was preparing for the latest storm \u2013 with early indications that the vast, busy rail network would shut down this weekend \u2013 there were also two earthquakes under the city, measuring 4.5 and 3.5 on the Richter scale. They could be felt in the Shinjuku district, where the England team are based until Friday.\n\nThe Red Rose management and logistical staff are understood to have been in regular contact with tournament officials, to prepare for all eventualities. There was a concerted attempt to play down the threat of what is coming.\n\nRWC chiefs wanted to try to relocate the game to Oita, 500 miles away from Yokohama\n\nDespite the magnitude of the storm, defence coach John Mitchell said: \u2018I think people are making it bigger than what it actually is. It\u2019s just weather. At the end of the day, we\u2019ve got a game of rugby to play and wherever it\u2019s going to be played, we\u2019ll deal with it. Whatever is thrown at us, we\u2019ll deal with it. We\u2019ll look forward to dealing with it.\n\n\u2018It is important to understand all the permutations and plan for those permutations. Should a decision be made, we can act. We\u2019ve definitely got awareness of the permutations, but we feel that whatever decision is made, we\u2019ll adapt to anything.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ll just wait and see. Unless we\u2019ve got something definite, we won\u2019t communicate anything otherwise to our players. We\u2019re preparing to play France at the moment in Yokohama and that\u2019s how we see it, so we won\u2019t be giving any information to our players that\u2019s not really definite.\u2019\n\nThe cancellation could leave Eddie Jones's men under-cooked heading into the quarter-finals\n\nPresumably, definitive information has begun to seep through to the England players. While they will finish top of their pool in the event of the cancellation being officially confirmed, this is not an ideal scenario for the Red Rose camp.\n\nIt means that they face the threat of going into a likely quarter-final against Australia in Oita next Saturday under-cooked.\n\nEngland\u2019s last match \u2013 last Saturday \u2013 became a procession to victory over 14-man Argentina, once Tomas Lavanini had been sent off for a high tackle on Owen Farrell.\n\nFollowing earlier, routine pool victories over Tier 2 sides Tonga and the USA, it means that the national team won\u2019t have been significantly tested at this tournament, and won\u2019t have played for a fortnight before they take on the Wallabies. It is not the way they would have wished to prepare for such a momentous encounter.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE BY CHRIS FOY IN TOKYO: With super typhoon Hagibis set to rage through Tokyo this weekend, tournament organisers are due to announce contingency plans.", "authors": ["Chris Foy For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/13/19489670-0-image-a-33_1570623142189.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
