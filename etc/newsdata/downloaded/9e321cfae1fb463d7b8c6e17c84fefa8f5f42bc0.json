Here's what you need to know. (Photo: Of A Kind)\n\nSad news, Of A Kind fans.\n\nThe artisanal retailer, known for curating one-of-a-kind products from emerging artists and designers, is set to shut down on Monday, following a decision from the brand\u2019s parent company, Bed Bath & Beyond.\n\nOf A Kind founders Erica Cerulo and Claire Mazur wrote a heartfelt goodbye to their customers in which they thanked them for their support.\n\n\u201cWe are, of course, very sad, but we also couldn\u2019t be more proud of what we\u2019ve built over the last nine years\u2014or more grateful to have had you cheering us on,\u201d they wrote. \u201cIt has been a privilege to get to create the business we wanted to see in the world and an honor to showcase the work and stories of 600+ designers and makers whose work we admire and are, frankly, in awe of.\u201d\n\nBed Bath & Beyond, which bought indie marketplace Of A Kind in 2015, announced Wednesday that it would close 40 Bed Bath & Beyond stores and 20 stores from concepts it owns by the end of 2019. The company is also looking for a new CEO to help address stagnant sales. Interim CEO Mary Winston has been at the helm of the business since May, when Steven Temares resigned from the role.\n\nBed Bath & Beyond did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment.\n\nIf you\u2019re a longtime Of A Kind fan, or (like me) perhaps just a lurker, you can browse the brand\u2019s remaining home products, fashion pieces and jewelry until Monday. Customer service support will be in place through Nov. 1, according to Mazur and Cerulo.\n\nTake a look below at some of the one-of-a-kind finds you can still snag from the brand.\n\nProfessional Enthusiast Tee\n\nChristine Alcalay Printed Scrunchie\n\nLizzie Fortunato Arp Earrings\n\nApparis Roxanne Faux Fur Scarf\n\nXenia Taler Incense Holder\n\nBaggu Giant Pocket Tote\n\nFavor Crescent Hair Pin\n\nAtelier Delphine Balloon Sleeve Sweater\n\nSundara Mar Fran Hoops\n\nProfessional Enthusiast Cap\n\nDevon Pavlovits Arya Pearl Bracelet\n\nGet it for $99.\n\nMaison Balzac Carafe And Glass Set\n\nHarp Voyage Earrings\n\nLoup Flora Corduroy Overalls\n\nSea + Pattern High Gloss Hair Clip\n\nRelated Coverage\n\n20 Pairs Of Eye-Catching Tortoise Earrings, From Amazon To Nordstrom\n\nWe Found Meghan Markle's Diamond Huggie Earrings For A Fraction Of The Price\n\nAmerican Eagle Has A New Line Of Affordable CBD Bath And Body Products\n\nSmall Pearl Gold Hoops\n\nGet them from Etsy seller FalaJewelry for $39.\n\nHammered Metal Pearl Hoops Earrings\n\nGet them from Etsy seller AdrianaSoto for $42.\n\nBeaded Elongated Pearl Hoops\n\nGet them from Etsy seller TheLittleStatementSH for $15+.\n\nHammered Metal Pearl Hoops\n\nGet them from Etsy seller LucinaElla for $25.\n\nlana Pearl Hoops in Rose, Silver or Gold\n\nGet them from Etsy seller MinimalistMagnolia for $36.\n\nDangle Pearl Gold Hoops\n\nGet them from Etsy seller FalaJewelry for $39.\n\nSmall, Medium or Large Pearl Hoop Earrings\n\nGet them from Etsy seller DelicateLayers for $29+.\n\nCrescent Mother Of Pearl Hoop Earrings\n\nGet them from Etsy seller TheBlissfulCo for $46.\n\n14K Gold Fill Pearl Hoop Earrings\n\nGet them from Etsy seller StephStargell for $29.\n\n18K Yellow Gold Pearl Hoop Earrings\n\nGet them from Etsy seller MissAudreyJewellery for $23.\n\nBaroque Pearl Hoop Earrings\n\nGet them from Etsy seller SimpleDaintyJewelry for $45.\n\nLove HuffPost?
