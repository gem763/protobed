Photo: Shutterstock\n\nWho doesn\u2019t get the willies descending into an abandoned subway station on the Bowery, with only one obvious exit? \u201cAre you one of those people whose first thought was to see how you\u2019ll get out in a fire?\u201d an editor, grinning, asked me last night at Tom Ford\u2019s show, held on the platform.\n\nSince we\u2019d all come down the same grimy stairs, I told him I would opt to run screaming down the darkened tunnel.\n\nHe grunted. \u201cHope you don\u2019t run into a rat.\u201d\n\nAh, New York in the new Age of Innocence, if that\u2019s indeed what it is. I borrow the handle not from Wharton but from Maria Cornejo, who used it to characterize the naivete and sense of discovery she hoped to impart in her collection, held in the late-afternoon breeze on a terrace at the Standard Hotel. \u201cThere was a time when the things that we now take so much for granted \u2014 mechanization, technology, global communications \u2026 were thrilling harbingers of a better future,\u201d Cornejo said in her show notes.\n\nAnother group of designers, the very young team behind Vaquera, were also in a reflective mood yesterday about the city. \u201cNew York City Dies on the Runway,\u201d the cover of their program declared, under a picture of Lady Liberty. \u201cWhen you love someone, you don\u2019t notice the smell.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen presented their line, The Row, in the solemn atmosphere of their showroom. But considering the rather spiritless results, maybe they should consider venturing out more.\n\nTom Ford Photo: Shutterstock\n\nFord, who worked as a design assistant in New York in the \u201980s before going to Gucci, drew on an eclectic bunch of images, citing the 1965 photo of Andy Warhol and Edie Sedgwick coming out of a manhole cover, Luc Besson\u2019s Subway, Isabelle Adjani\u2019s punk hair in that film, Ursula Andress in a shiny metal bra, Loulou de la Falaise in clashing pinks and red, the Beatles in Berlin, his young son Jack\u2019s love of basketball shorts and Ford\u2019s own dismay at them. As he said in his show notes, which actually provided insight into his design process, the question was \u201chow to make such a contemporary fixture in modern clothing chic.\u201d His shorts, in sumptuous jersey, took away some of the volume for a more graceful fit, and turned the elastic waist into a more considered detail.\n\nIn the past, some of Ford\u2019s attempts to do modern, relaxed clothes have looked awkward, like he was stranded between an American sportswear sensibility and a European sense of decadence. This collection showed a lot more confidence, beginning with the opening trio of long, lightly gathered skirts (with side pockets) worn with sleeveless T-shirts. It\u2019s a classic American look, buffed up with Ford\u2019s wonderful eye for fabrics with a sheen or a slightly oily effect. In the same offhand vein were sleeveless jumpsuits in white, gathered jersey or a dusty turquoise. The latter was terrific, with the elastic \u201csports\u201d bands again serving as a detail. He paired the basketball shorts with sleek blazers, and because he\u2019s the ultimate scene-setter, both as a designer and a filmmaker, he put them with black seamed stockings and strappy metallic heels.\n\nTom Ford Photo: Shutterstock\n\nAs for the glossy breastplates worn by Gigi Hadid and others, they\u2019re in molded plastic, their colors inspired by Jeff Koons\u2019s balloon dogs. Just as there is nothing new about showing in a subway \u2014 Martin Margiela did it 30 years ago, in Paris \u2014 so too does the breastplate have a long history. Saint Laurent, for one, showed them. Still, Ford\u2019s considered reduction of the elements \u2014 the lines, the materials \u2014 and his timing makes the style feel fresh. Who will wear it during the movie awards season?\n\nZero + Maria Cornejo\n\nThe Row and the essentially minimalist designs of Cornejo were not so much a study in contrasts as a difference in technique and connectedness with the world. Where the Olsens stressed an expensive simplicity \u2014 a plain black cotton camp shirt with black slim pants, a French blue shirt with a long navy straight skirt, a strapless black cotton dress \u2014 Cornejo was offering more texture and interest. Not a lot, just enough to show that things still delight and challenge her as a designer.\n\nMany of the garments are made in organic cotton and recycled polyester. Cornejo\u2019s skirts and dresses have always had a floaty quality, achieved through her skillful pattern making, but this season I particularly loved the raw, woven texture of a sleeveless, slim indigo-blue wrap dress blended with other blue-colored patterns, and, at the other extreme, the volume of a jacket in off-white cotton canvas with wide matching pants.\n\nPerhaps the Olsens saw this season as a pause after spring\u2019s ethereal layers and handsome coats. The problem is such plainness exposes minimalism\u2019s key pillars \u2014 Jil Sander, Zoran, Calvin Klein.\n\nVaquera\n\nThe designers of Vaquera \u2014 Claire Sullivan, Patric DiCaprio and Bryn Taubensee \u2014 decided to share a show venue (and expenses) with two other brands. I\u2019m sorry but I only had eyes for Vaquera\u2019s wonderful, knowing silliness. New York may have forgotten her history, as they said in their notes, and become jaded and fucked up, but the designers are magisterial in their wit. Their classics, from trench coats and flouncy smock dresses to bullet bras, are again super-sized, with the addition of some terrific denim. I came away with a new sense of control and pragmatism from the kids. They\u2019ve got something to say, and they\u2019re not afraid.\n\nEarlier this week, I mentioned the idea of a new aristocracy \u2014 not unlike the way fashion and art worked in the 18th century, with a rarefied group creating style for like-minded people. Looking at Vaquera\u2019s theatrical yet quite wearable looks, I think they belong in that vanguard.\n\nVaquera", "description": "Fashion critic Cathy Horyn reviews the spring 2019 Tom Ford, Zero + Maria Cornejo, and Vaquera collections seen during New York Fashion Week.", "authors": ["Cathy Horyn"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/10/cathy-horyn/10-cathy-lede.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
