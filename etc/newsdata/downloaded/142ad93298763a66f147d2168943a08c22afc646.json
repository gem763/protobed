Malek Public Service Leadership Lecture, and came as President Trump\u2019s administration tries to negotiate a new trade deal with China.\n\nThe vice president also sounded off on previous U.S. administrations, which he claimed had tolerated unfair trade terms for the U.S. and looked the other way as China mistreated its citizens.\n\n\"The political establishment was not only silent in the faces of China's economic aggression and human rights abuses, but enabled them,\" Pence charged.\n\nBut during Thursday\u2019s NBA pregame show on TNT, Barkley said Pence was guilty of hypocrisy on the subject of China.\n\n\u201cVice President Pence needs to shut the hell up, number one,\u201d Barkley said to a panel of his TNT colleagues as well as NBA commissioner Adam Silver. \u201cAll American companies are doing business in China. I thought the criticism of commissioner Silver and LeBron James was unfair.\n\nBarkley added: \u201cDaryl Morey, who I like, he can say whatever he wants to. But there are consequences. I don\u2019t understand why these holier-than-thou politicians, if they\u2019re so worried about China, why don\u2019t they stop all transactions with China?\n\n\u201cPresident Trump has been talking about and arguing with tariffs for China for the last two years,\u201d Barkley continued. \u201cI think it\u2019s unfair for them to do all their business in China and just because this thing happens try to make the NBA and our players look bad. All American companies do business in China. Period.\u201d\n\n\"President Trump has been talking about and arguing with tariffs for China for the last two years. ... All American companies do business in China. Period.\" \u2014 Charles Barkley\n\nMany NBA fans appear to take a different view than Barkley. Demonstrations in support of Hong Kong have taken place at NBA games in Brooklyn, N.Y., and Los Angeles, and in Philadelphia a fan was ejected over a pro-Hong Kong sign.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDuring Thursday\u2019s speech, Pence noted that the FBI has 1,000 active investigations underway regarding the theft of intellectual property, with the the majority involving China.\n\nLast December, Pence said, the Justice Department announced it had broken up a hacking operation in which Chinese officials stole the names and data of 100,000 U.S. Navy personnel as well as ship maintenance information \"with grave implications for our national security,\" Pence said.\n\nAt a separate cybersecurity event in Washington, the Justice Department's top national security official, John Demers, said any progress in U.S.-China trade talks would have no bearing on future prosecutions involving Chinese espionage or intellectual property theft. Only a change in behavior by the Chinese would affect those decisions, he said.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this story.", "description": "On Thursday night, Charles Barkley harshly criticized Vice President Mike Pence, after Pence weighed in on the NBA-China controversy earlier in the day.", "authors": ["Dom Calicchio", "Charles Barkley"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/061516-NBA-Charles-Barkley.vresize.-f4ee21ddfd595510VgnVCM100000d7c1a8c0____.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
