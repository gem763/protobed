What has happened since the referendum, initially slowly, but increasingly accelerated over the last few months, is that it has moved away from those values. It has become more intolerant.\u201d\n\nTaking aim at Mr Johnson in an interview with The Observer, he continued: \u201cThere is a scorched earth approach to delivering Brexit by 31 October at the risk of our institutions, at the risk of our democracy, at the risk of our economy. That should never be allowed to happen.\u201d\n\nBut his appointment could risk angering some Lib Dem activists, already dismayed at Dr Lee joining their ranks, after he caused controversy in 2016 for filibustering the Turing Bill \u2013 designed to pardon gay people convicted under now-abolished offences.\n\nHis defection takes the total tally of Liberal Democrat MPs to 18 \u2013 up from 12 after the 2017 election.
