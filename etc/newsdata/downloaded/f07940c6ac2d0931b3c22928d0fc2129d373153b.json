June's drive, ambition and knowhow will help further transform the BBC's programming to ensure that we truly reflect the public we serve.\"\n\nThe announcement comes after the BBC reversed a decision to partially uphold a complaint against BBC Breakfast presenter Naga Munchetty for comments she made about US President Donald Trump. However, the director of creative diversity job was planned before that, having been advertised in May.\n\nThe BBC has pledged to ensure 50% of on-air roles go to women by 2020, with targets of 15% for black, Asian and minority ethnic [BAME], 8% for disabled and 8% for LGBT staff\n\nOff air, the BBC has promised to increase the proportion of leadership roles filled by women from 44% to 50% by next year, and raise the share of such senior roles held by BAME staff from 11.5% to 15%.\n\nSarpong's appointment follows the departure in March of the corporation's head of diversity, inclusion and succession Tunde Ogungbesan. His role has been split in two - director of creative diversity and head of workforce diversity and inclusion.\n\nSarpong will begin her three-day-a-week job in November, continuing her other work alongside her BBC commitments. As well as presenting, she co-founded the Women - Inspiration and Enterprise (WIE) Alliance and the Decide Act Now summit.\n\nShe was made an MBE in 2007 for services to broadcasting and charity. In 2017, she published her book Diversify, followed by The Power of Women last year.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
