Bob embodies the highest values of our firm and profession. We\u2019re privileged to work alongside him once again.\u201d\n\nMueller said in a statement he was \u201cglad\u201d to be at WilmerHale again, calling it a firm with \u201ca tradition of honoring public service.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was an honor to serve as special counsel,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, I look forward to resuming my private practice alongside the talented lawyers at the firm.\u201d\n\nMueller deputies James Quarles and Aaron Zebely, who both worked at the firm prior to joining the special counsel\u2019s office, are also returning to WilmerHale.\n\nOther top investigators who worked alongside Mueller also have landed on their feet since shuttering the special counsel\u2019s office. Michael Dreeben joined Georgetown Law School; Andrew Weissman joined New York University Law and has signed a book deal with Random House; Andrew Goldstein joined Cooley law firm; Zainab Ahmad joined law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP; Greg Andres returned to Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP; and Jeannie Rhee, who formerly served at WilmerHale, joined Paul Weiss as a partner.\n\nMeanwhile, some former prosecutors on Mueller\u2019s team have returned to public service\u2014like Brandon Van Grack, who is now leading the effort at the Justice Department to enforce the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA).\n\nIn May, Mueller announced the closing of his office and detailed the findings of the Russia investigation, reporting that there \u201cwas not sufficient evidence to charge a conspiracy\u201d with regard to whether members of the Trump campaign coordinated with the Russian government during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nMueller, though, left the door open on whether the president obstructed justice.\n\n\u201cIf we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said that,\u201d Mueller said. \u201cWe did not determine whether the president did commit a crime.\u201d", "description": "Robert Mueller re-joined\u00a0the WilmerHale law firm on Tuesday, following a nearly three-year hiatus as he served as special counsel investigating Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates during the 2016 presidential election.", "authors": ["Brooke Singman", "Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News.
