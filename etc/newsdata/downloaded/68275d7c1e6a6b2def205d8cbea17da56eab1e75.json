(Picture: Rex Features)\n\nWhile Tony Stark was a very smart man, it seems he knew something big was coming the way of the Avengers way, way back.\n\nOne fan has unearthed a moment from an old Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) scene in which Iron Man \u2013 played by Robert Downey Jr \u2013 was talking about his Arc Reactor.\n\nWe\u2019re talking way back in the first MCU movie, 2008\u2019s Iron Man.\n\nIt seems this little (at the time what we thought was inconsequential) moment in the OG movie explains how Iron Man wasn\u2019t immediately incapacitated by the Snap, after he wielded the Infinity Gauntlet at the end of Avengers: Endgame.\n\nSure he eventually succumbed to the power the Snap created, however being human it\u2019s thought he should have fallen victim to its energy long before he did.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoing back over a decade, speaking to Shaun Toub\u2019s Yinsen about the artificial heart in Iron Man, Stark was told the reactor could \u2018run his heart for 50 lifetimes\u2019.\n\nIt was here he said: \u2018Or something really big for 15 minutes.\u2019\n\nWhile the Arc reactor ended up living in the suit and was what powered Iron Man, did it help absorb the energy from The Snap? Or are we just getting carried away?\n\nWhat does this mean? (Picture: WolverineKuzuri93/reddit)\n\nReddit user u/WolverineKuzuri93 made the revelation over the weekend as they shared a screenshot of the moment Stark appeared to foresee his future \u2013 or at least the threat of Thanos, perhaps.\n\n\u2018It just dawned on me how Tony was able to not only wield the stones but also do so without immediately being incapacitated like the Hulk was. His Arc reactor took the bulk of the energy,\u2019 the Redditor wrote.\n\nThey were challenged by the Avengers fans, who came up with their own theories as to how Stark kept kicking long enough for Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) to say her goodbye.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nOne chimed in: \u2018I think he lasted a bit longer because the nanoparticles kept on trying to repair the suit and took the main damage until the snap which was too much and eventually got to Tony\u2019s frail human body.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey might be on the money, but not dispelling this theory altogether \u2013 after the Russo Brothers, who directed Infinity War and Endgame, once confirmed Iron Man\u2019s suit\u2019s nanotech and that of the Infinity Gauntlet were one in the same.\n\nAnother fan was simply floored by how everything may tie in, despite the decade in between these two films.\n\n\u2018What\u2019s really amazing about this is how relevant everything from the first marvel movies still is, and how it ties into endgame,\u2019 a commenter wrote.\n\n\u2018Marvel did an amazing job at bringing everything back around. It\u2019s part of what made these movies so great.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
