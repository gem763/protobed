Luis Arroyo, 65, made the offer on Aug. 2 and handed over an initial check on Aug. 22 for the unidentified lawmaker\u2019s backing of the legislation in the Illinois Senate, the complaint says.\n\nThe Chicago Democrat\u2019s alleged willingness to arrange regular payments for legislative support stands out even in a state with a history of brazen public corruption.\n\nThe 12-page complaint describes the moment Arroyo gave the check to his colleague in a suburban Chicago restaurant, citing a federal wiretap that allegedly captured their conversation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to give you this here,\u201d Arroyo tells the senator, the complaint says. \u201cThis is, this is, this is the jackpot.\u201d\n\nWhen Arroyo asked at an earlier meeting if the lawmaker wanted the $2,500 checks each month for six months or each month for a year, the senator responds: \u201cA year sounds great.\u201d\n\nThe complaint describes Arroyo as having a vested interest in the arrangement as manager of Spartacus 3 LLC, a lobbying company, which included as its clients the owner of a firm that deals in video sweepstakes machines. There\u2019s no indication in legislative records that Arroyo introduced any sweepstakes legislation, and when the idea was inserted into a gambling-expansion measure 18 months ago, there was little enthusiasm for it.\n\nArroyo appeared in Chicago federal court Monday morning on one count of federal program bribery. He looked calm as he stood by his lawyer during the five-minute hearing, his hands folded in front of him. Released on a personal recognizance bond in the afternoon, he didn\u2019t speak to reporters as he left the courthouse.\n\nIf convicted, Arroyo faces a maximum 10-year prison term.\n\nFederal authorities have charged or raided the homes and offices of more than half a dozen Illinois Democrats this year. Some have been allies and confidants of Michael Madigan, turning up the pressure on the powerful state House Speaker who also heads the Democratic Party of Illinois.\n\nMadigan, who has not been accused of wrongdoing, has largely remained mum when Democrats have been accused of corruption. But his office issued a statement within hours of Arroyo\u2019s court appearance on Monday, urging him to immediately resign. If Arroyo refuses, Madigan said he would take the \u201cnecessary steps\u201d to force him out.\n\nThe complaint against Arroyo, who has represented the 3rd district on the West Side since 2006, refers to the senator only as a cooperating witness. It says the person chose to wear a wire in hopes of a reduced sentence for filing false income tax returns.\n\nAt one of their first meetings, the senator who secretly recorded their interactions listens to what Arroyo has to say about backing the legislation. But, the lawmaker asks Arroyo: \u201cWhat\u2019s in it for me?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for something, you know?\u201d the senator adds. \u201cI\u2019m in the twilight, you know.\u201d\n\nA little later, Arroyo assures his colleague he can be trusted to stay quiet about their arrangement.\n\n\u201cMy word is my bond and \u2026 my reputation,\u201d Arroyo says, according to the complaint.\n\nPuerto Rico-born Arroyo is chairman of a House appropriations committee and on the public utilities and transportation committees. He was elected the general assembly\u2019s assistant majority leader in 2017.\n\nArroyo is the third Illinois legislator charged in recent months.\n\nIn August, charges were announced against, state Sen. Thomas E. Cullerton, a distant cousin of the Illinois Senate\u2019s top leader, John Cullerton. Thomas Cullerton has pleaded not guilty to embezzlement charges for alleging receiving over $250,000 in salary and benefits from the Teamsters while doing little or no work.\n\nAnd in September, FBI agents raided the Capital building office of state Sen. Martin Sandoval, another Chicago Democrat. He hasn\u2019t been charged.\n\nEven as federal prosecutors have put an increasing number of Illinois Democrats in their sites, there\u2019s no sign Madigan is losing his more than 35-year stranglehold of the Legislature. Democrats in the state House have a 74-44 majority, and there\u2019s a 40-19 majority in the Senate. Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker is also a Democrat.\n\nFor the first time Monday, Madigan also commented on reports - based on court papers mistakenly unsealed this year in a separate case - that a businessman wore an FBI wire and secretly recorded Madigan in 2014. The documents said the businessman discussed a hotel project with Madigan and the possibility of the project\u2019s Chinese developer becoming a client of Madigan\u2019s private law firm, Madigan & Getzendanner.\n\nWhen asked Monday if he was a target of an investigation, Madigan told reporters: \u201cNo, I\u2019m not a target of anything.\u201d\n\n___\n\nO\u2019Connor reported from Springfield, Illinois.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Legal Affairs Writer Michael Tarm on Twitter at https://twitter.com/mtarm\n\nFollow AP Political Writer John O\u2019Connor on Twitter at https://twitter.com/apoconnor\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "An Illinois state lawmaker bribed a legislative colleague with an offer of $2,500 a month in exchange for the state senator's support of sweepstakes-related legislation, according to a federal complaint unsealed on Monday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Michael Tarm", "John O'Connor"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/28/illinois_lawmaker_public_corruption_54225_c0-700-2165-1962_s1200x700.jpg?f60cdd05e29562880b921271ce2f7254e9ec1411", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
