But a flat tire, dead battery, or another common vehicle problem is always a possibility. And while less likely, there's also the chance you'll find your car overturned and at risk of an engine fire, slowly sinking into a lake, or stuck deep in a snowbank on a frigid winter night.\n\nWhen you keep a carefully curated selection of tools in your car, you may be able to mitigate the severity of the situation you face. Just as important as the tools you choose, where you place them within your vehicle requires careful thought, too.\n\nYour emergency escape tool, for example, should be within easy arm's reach when your back is pressed against the driver's seat \u2014 think center console, as even the glovebox may be too far to reach when you're pinned by a seatbelt. A flashlight can be tucked into the glovebox, while that shovel, socket set, and other tools are best kept in the trunk and strapped down at that.\n\nRead on to find our selections for the best car tools to have on hand for both minor inconveniences and real emergencies.\n\nHere are the best tools you can buy to keep in your car:", "description": "When you're on the road you need to make sure you're set up with everything you need.
