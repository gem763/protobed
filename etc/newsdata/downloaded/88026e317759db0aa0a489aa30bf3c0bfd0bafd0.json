Everything went from under me. I\u2019d lost my manager, my husband, all my money, my self-respect and my work.\n\nI\u2019d gone from being at the very top to nobody wanting me any more. I felt my life was in the gutter \u2013 so it was sink or swim.\n\nI started working in London\u2019s West End and going out to clubs with youngsters from the cast. I grew my hair, lost weight and got my tiny hips back. The divorce diet worked for me. But I didn\u2019t tell anyone that Henrik had left. Millions of people had bought into my fairytale \u2013 now the dream was shattered and I was terrified of disappointing them.\n\nBut in 2003 the news came out and Loose Women asked me on to talk about the break-up. They showed a clip of our wedding \u2013 me, madly in love, with a gorgeous man by my side and a soaring career ahead of me.\n\nI remember longing for that lost love and tenderness, and I went to pieces pouring out my heart live on air. I left feeling a huge burden had been lifted.\n\n(Image: Dave J Hogan/Getty Images)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nI began to feel like my old self and launched a mini-tour and walking on stage felt like coming home.\n\nThen, in 2004 I was invited to join the Loose Women panel. It was a lifesaver, a fresh start, working with good, strong women who were my bezzie mates.\n\nLynda Bellingham, Jackie Brambles, Andrea McLean, Denise Welch, Carol Vorderman, Coleen Nolan, Kate Thornton, Lisa Maxwell, Sherrie Hewson and Carol McGiffin, among others.\n\nI felt that I could have rung any of them if I was in trouble, and they\u2019d have all been there. I used to love being on with Carol McGiffin. We were a brilliant double act because we never agreed on anything.\n\nAnd, God, I loved Lynda. She was so full of life and wise. I wore my Loose Women badge with pride and we started winning all the awards. We were like the girls in Sex and the City.\n\nThe number of letters I used to get saying, \u2018I\u2019d love to go out with you lot for a drink\u2019. I could understand why: it was always such a laugh, we had the best time!\n\n(Image: Handout)\n\nOne night I was out having dinner with Lynda Bellingham when Frank Allen from The Searchers came over. \u201cYou used to go out with our drummer, Ed,\u201d he said.\n\nI shook my head \u2013 I\u2019d never dated an Ed.\n\n\u201cYou probably know him as Wal Rothe.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh my God, Wal! How is he? I haven\u2019t seen him since I was 19!\u201d\n\nWe\u2019d first met in the 80s when I was waitressing at a Wakefield nightclub.\n\nDisco group, Liquid Gold were playing. The drummer, Wal, asked if we could have a drink. He was tall, blond and built like a god. We hit it off and started going out.\n\nI have a mental snapshot of Wal in the morning light walking naked across the room. \u201cWow, that\u2019s a body!\u201d I thought.\n\nHe was the one. And when he started pointing out rings in shops I couldn\u2019t help hoping... Until Ellie, the group\u2019s singer said: \u201cYou can\u2019t hold him back, Jane - and I can\u2019t see you twiddling your thumbs while he\u2019s off round the world.\u201d\n\nShe was right. I had things to do in my life and Wal needed rock and roll.\n\n(Image: Handout)\n\nI went to become a cruise-ship entertainer, and my life changed for ever. And, here I was in 2008 on TV.\n\nOne morning I was at the Loose Women studio when The Searchers appeared on This Morning. I looked up and there was Wal, as handsome as ever. \u201cJane!\u201d he cried, picking me up and swinging me around. The years just melted away.\n\n\u201cI just can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve met you again,\u201d Wal said, beaming at me. \u201cGive me a call.\u201d\n\nThe moment Loose Women was over, I went straight to phone Wal. We talked for ages and ages. He was just as lovely as ever and we couldn\u2019t stop laughing as we raked over our memories.\n\nI don\u2019t often fancy people but I thought Ed was gorgeous. He was tall and dashing, warm and friendly, and I felt proud to be by his side. I was falling in love with him all over again. But The Searchers did 250 gigs a year, so he was often away.\n\nThe deeper I fell in love with him, the scarier it felt. We\u2019d split up 30 years earlier because he always on the road.\n\nEd and I spent that Christmas together, but he seemed a bit jumpy on Christmas Eve.\n\n(Image: WireImage)\n\nWe went to my local Italian for dinner. Suddenly, Ed cleared his throat and put his hand in his pocket. \u201cJane, you are definitely the one for me and I should have done this 26 years ago,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWill you marry me?\u201d\n\nI was so overwhelmed that I started crying. Then Ed started crying!\n\nPeople around us were mortified \u2013 thinking we\u2019d split up.\n\n\u201cNo, no, he\u2019s just asked me to marry him!\u201d I said, laughing through the tears.\n\nIn 2013, midway through my new tour, Lynda rang me and said, \u201cLook, there\u2019s going to be something in the papers tomorrow, and you\u2019re not going to like it.\u201d\n\nOh no, what have you done now?\u201d I joked. \u201cI\u2019ve got cancer,\u201d she said. The world seemed to stop turning. I couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cOh no, love! Is there anything I can do?\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m going to beat it,\u201d she told me firmly. I believed her, because if anyone was going to beat cancer, it was Lynda. She was such a strong, loving, positive person.\n\nThings started changing at Loose Women in 2014. I enjoyed being with the other girls and staying was the safe option. But sometimes you\u2019ve got to jump off a cliff to see if you can fly. I decided to leave the show to focus on singing and touring but the girls and I have remained good friends.\n\nIt was a turbulent year and we were all affected when Lynda dropped the bombshell in September that her cancer was terminal. It was very, very sad news.\n\n(Image: WireImage)\n\nI was on tour and had to go on stage that night as if nothing had happened.\n\nBut when it came to singing \u201cI\u2019ll Be There\u201d, I couldn\u2019t help thinking of Lynda and crying. \u201cPicture me beside you and I\u2019ll be there, feel my arms around you and I\u2019ll be there...\u201d It was hard to sing that song. Lynda\u2019s funeral was held that November in Somerset. There was so much love in that church. Looking around at the packed pews I thought, \u2018How wonderful to have been so special to so many people\u2019.\n\nLynda was one of life\u2019s good people, and I\u2019m honoured to have known her.\n\nI lost a very good friend the day she died and her death had a profound effect on me. It made me think about my own mortality and ask myself, \u2018What do you want?\u2019\n\nI thought about Lynda. She knew how important it was to live well and nourish close relationships. She kept on about Ed \u2013 \u201cHe\u2019s a good one\u201d, she told me, several times. \u201cWe need them, you know.\u201d Now her words came back to me and I thought, \u2018Yes, I need to spend time at home.\u2019 Ed is more than my rock, he\u2019s my best friend and ally. I don\u2019t just love him, I admire and respect him. I have peace of mind and a beautiful partner with a kind heart, who adores me and lets me run the business.\n\nThe second bite of the cherry is so much sweeter than the first and I\u2019m determined to make the most of it.\n\n(Image: Elephant House Studios)\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nPolice made me stop fan meet and greets\n\nMeeting fans for autographs and photos after a show was always an important part of my tours because my fans mean the world to me.\n\nBut after the first series of Cruising With Jane McDonald, the crowds at the stage door kept growing.\n\nOne Saturday, my tour manager, Martin Hudson, was called to the stage door: the staff had received a menacing phone call from a man who said he was waiting outside for me.\n\nThe first I heard was Martin saying: \u201cYou can\u2019t sign tonight. Go in the dressing room, open a bottle of wine, but for goodness\u2019 sake don\u2019t leave until I come and get you.\u201d\n\n(Image: Handout)\n\nI could see people looking worried and running about. \u201cThe police have been called,\u201d somebody said.\n\n\u201cWhoa! I\u2019m sure it\u2019s only someone playing games,\u201d I said, taken aback. Then two police officers came to speak to us.\n\nIt was a shock when one of them said: \u201cYou should think twice in future about meeting your fans after the show. You\u2019re putting yourself in a very vulnerable position.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it would be terrible if I couldn\u2019t meet my fans,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cI would advise you to stop,\u2019 he replied firmly. \u201cWe will give you a police escort to the motorway and make sure no one is following you.\u201d\n\n\u201cA police escort? You\u2019re joking, aren\u2019t you?\u201d I said. It wasn\u2019t until the next day that it dawned on me the threatening caller might actually have wanted to hurt me.\n\nReluctantly, I had to decide no stage doors from now on.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Jane, 56, and her partner Eddie spent 27 years apart before they were reunited and fell back in love", "authors": ["Rachael Bletchly", "Image", "Dave J Hogan Getty Images", "Itv", "Handout", "Wireimage", "Elephant House Studios"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20724467.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Virgin-TV-BAFTA-Television-Awards-VIP-Arrivals.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
