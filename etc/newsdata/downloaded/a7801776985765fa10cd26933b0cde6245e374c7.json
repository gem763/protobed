Weird, right? (Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nDepression and sleep have a complex relationship. Often, said relationship is very all-or-nothing, with the sufferer either finding their sleep insufferably broken and disturbed, or finding that they\u2019re compelled to sleep for 17 hours a day.\n\nIt can be a bit of a chicken-and-egg situation, as the majority of people with depression will experience sleep disorders, but also a very high percentage of those with sleep disorders are depressed.\n\nIs one an after-effect of the other? Do they come hand in hand? Is it possible to have one without the other?\n\nFor a lot of people (including me), further investigation into disordered sleeping can be the first step on a path to a diagnosis of depression.\n\nWhen I was waking up at 3.45am every day, a quick Google (on my phone \u2013 not a great way to get back to sleep) suggested that I might be depressed and that disrupted sleep can often be a symptom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEqually, a list of search results for \u2018can\u2019t stop sleeping all day\u2019 suggest the same diagnosis \u2013 but how can one illness have two totally opposite side effects?\n\nIt\u2019s because depression is a tricksy little bitch that doesn\u2019t play by anyone\u2019s rules.\n\nDr Jane Woyka, Principal GP at Harrow Health Care Centre, tells Metro.co.uk: \u2018For some, depression can lead to severe insomnia, where patients struggle to sleep or find that they are very restless waking often with a lack of REM sleep, which is important for recovery.\n\n\u2018In cases of depression as well as a lack of sleep, some patients feel a need to sleep constantly and struggle to stay awake. Insomnia and a constant feeling of sleepiness are obviously connected, so people with depression can get into odd patterns.\u2019\n\nDepression can lead to sleep issues, sleep issues can lead to depression (Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nDr Woyka is keen to add that although there are a lot of medication options available to help you with any sleep dramas, medicine isn\u2019t actually the best option.\n\n\u2018There are a number of over the counter products that can be used to treat insomnia, which usually contain an anti-histamine,\u2019 she says. \u2018Phenergan is a popular choice, and Piriton is often used for hay fever and causes drowsiness.\n\n\u2018For some patients stronger medication is required. However, as a GP it\u2019s frowned upon if your patients are taking these sorts of drugs and we are advised to refer them to sleep clinics and psychiatrists to sort out the underlying issues.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUgh, underlying issues. You\u2019ve said a mouthful there, doctor.\n\nOf course, there could be any number of physical ailments that are stopping you getting your kip; you might have sleep apnea, or sleepwalk, or be someone who involuntarily pokes themselves in the eye every five minutes. However, if you have depression then it\u2019s likely that there are other factors contributing to your sleep patterns \u2013 it\u2019s a really good idea to talk to your GP about it.\n\nIn the meantime, though, there are small changes you can try to make to encourage your body to be ready for sleep at the time you need to be. Sleep is all about your circadian rhythm; the internal process that regulates your body clock. P\n\naying close attention to when you\u2019re processing lightness and darkness can really make a difference \u2013 which means putting down your phone when you\u2019re in bed, buddy. Honestly, how many people have text you to say they can\u2019t sleep? Unsurprising when you have a beam of bright light and all the information in the world held ten inches away from your face, mate.\n\nAnyway, Dr Kate Mason, a clinical psychologist, recommends tackling the following to make sure you really are giving yourself the best chance of a decent night of sleep.\n\nDr Kate Mason's five tips for sorting out your sleep: Remove distractions from your bedroom, and make it only about sleep Your bedroom should be a dedicated Zen palace of sleep. Too much noise, light or distraction can make sleep harder. So, make your room as dark as possible.\u201d Don\u2019t stay in bed if you\u2019re really not sleeping \u2018Don\u2019t lie in bed tossing and turning, if you can\u2019t sleep get up and move to another room. Do something that limits movement like reading a book or listening to some calming music. Then, when you are ready, return to your bedroom to sleep. This way, your brain will begin to associate your bed (and bedroom) purely with sleep and not sleep problems.\u2019 Get into a routine bedtime Ok, this one might be less achievable with work schedules and social lives, but if sleep problems are really affecting you then this is really worth a try. \u2018Research suggests that keeping a consistent bedtime is just as important as the length of time you sleep,\u2019 says Kate. \u2018Avoid naps in the day and don\u2019t clock watch \u2013 have some self-compassion don\u2019t tell yourself \u2018I should be asleep now\u2026 I\u2019ll only have 2,3 hrs sleep\u2019 \u2013 this will only serve to increase your anxiety.\u2019 Get outside (not at bedtime, though) \u2018Depression wants you to stay indoors and shut the world out (and everyone in it) The though of going outside may seem like an impossible feat but fight that feeling and get outside. \u2018Sunlight provides Vitamin D \u2013 a great mood enhancer. Not only that, seeing the sun frequently helps your circadian rhythms recalibrate and get back into a rhythm. \u2018If you truly can\u2019t face the outside world, at least open your curtains and let the day come to you.\u2019\n\nIf you or a loved one is struggling with mental health, you can find a qualified local counsellor in your area with Counselling Directory.
