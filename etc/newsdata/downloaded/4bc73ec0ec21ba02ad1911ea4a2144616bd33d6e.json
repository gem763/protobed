The media and political establishment were aghast \u2014 at President Trump\u2019s response. \u201cKathy Griffin should be ashamed of herself,\u201d the president (of course) tweeted. \u201cMy children, especially my 11 year old son, Barron, are having a hard time with this. Sick!\u201d Two years later, Ms. Griffin is back in the popular culture\u2019s good graces, bringing her caustic brand of stand up to theaters worldwide. Mr. Trump, meanwhile, was widely derided for taking offense at a video that showed his murder in graphic detail.\n\nLate last year, meanwhile, The New York Times book review published a graphic short story by the British novelist Zoe Sharp. The story, titled \u201cHow it Ends,\u201d depicted in detail the assassination of the president at the hands of his own secret service protection. The reaction of the popular culture to such a heinous, violent work appearing in the pages of one of the country\u2019s most important newspapers? Yawns all around.\n\nOver the weekend, meanwhile, those same elites who couldn\u2019t muster a care about vivid descriptions of the murder of the duly elected president of the United States found something to get exercised about. The New York Times published details of what it called a \u201cmacabre\u201d video that appeared at a conference of Trump supporters.\n\nThe New York Times decided its readers sensibilities were too delicate to handle posting the video, so it merely described it. What it was was a parody of a scene from the 2014 comedy/thriller \u201cKingsman,\u201d in which a character kills some 50 people in a manner of two minutes. In the version that played at the conference, President Trump\u2019s head is superimposed on the killer\u2019s, and various media and political figures are superimposed over the victims. The video had none of the realism of either Ms. Griffin\u2019s foray into assassination pornography nor the short story that appeared in the New York Times.\n\nThe conference at which the video appeared had nothing to do with the president or his campaign, and according to attendees, the video played to almost no people in an anteroom abutting the main event. But the reaction to it was still ferocious.\n\nWas the video that appeared at the conference in bad taste? Absolutely. (So too, by the way, was \u201cKingsman,\u201d an entertaining and well-made thriller that nonetheless includes horrific violence including the murder of former president Barack Obama.) But it was also a) obvious satire b) done for yuks and c) and seen by almost nobody at the conference. It was not a grave threat to the republic nor an incitement to violence. It was pure silliness, albeit of a particular kind.\n\nStill, the journalistic establishment rushed to the barricades. The White House Correspondents\u2019 Association professed itself \u201chorrified\u201d by the video. \u201cAll Americans should condemn this depiction of violence directed toward journalists and the President\u2019s political opponents,\u201d intoned WHCA honcho Jonathan Karl. CNN, whose logo appeared in the video said in a statement that the \u201cimages depicted are vile and horrific The Trump campaign need[s] to denounce it immediately Anything less equates to a tacit endorsement of violence.\u201d Or perhaps more accurately, a tacit endorsement of silly videos.\n\nCondemn the video the Trump White House did, by the way. That\u2019s all to the good. The video that played at the conference, while obviously intended as comedy and in no way realistic, probably crossed a line. But the selective outrage over what is and is not accepted by establishment and the popular culture is breathtaking to behold.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
