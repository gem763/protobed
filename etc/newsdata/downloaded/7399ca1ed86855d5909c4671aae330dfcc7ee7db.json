Chuck Grassley (R-IA). He released the findings on Friday afternoon.\n\nMore from Rolling Stone\n\nWhile the investigation found that the use of the private server \u201cincreased degree of risk of compromise,\u201d it also concluded that \u201cby and large, the individuals interviewed were aware of security policies and did their best to implement them.\u201d Therefore, according to the report, \u201cthere was no persuasive evidence of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information\u201d by Clinton or her staff.\n\nThe report continued, \u201cInstances of classified information being deliberately transmitted via unclassified email were the rare exception and resulted in adjudicated security violations.\u201d\n\nAlso, notably, Russians managed to breach the State Department\u2019s official, unclassified email system. The report on Clinton\u2019s server, however, found no evidence of outside hacking.\n\nOut of the 33,000 emails found on the server, the probe identified 38 individuals who committed a total of 91 \u201cvalid violations.\u201d As a result, each will receive a note in their file that will be considered when they renew their security clearances.\n\nPolitico spoke with former Clinton aides and current State officials who expressed concern that the conclusions of the investigation \u201ccould amount to an effort to alleviate pressure from Clinton critics who were disappointed that no one was prosecuted over the emails.\u201d And some told the publication they were worried \u201cit could be an attempt to strip the security clearances of former Clinton aides and allies.\u201d\n\nThe review began in 2016 when 22 emails on Clinton\u2019s server were found to be \u201ctop secret,\u201d following an FBI investigation which became a topic of President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign, despite no charges being filed. In fact, the subject of Clinton\u2019s emails remains a focus for Trump. As recently as two weeks ago, he tweeted, \u201cSo Crooked Hillary Clinton can delete and acid wash 33,000 emails AFTER getting a Subpoena from the United States Congress, but I can\u2019t make one totally appropriate telephone call to the President of Ukraine?
