I had a chance to get behind the wheel of one of the first right-hand drive examples in the UK to find out...\n\nUrus in the UK: Lamborghini officially released the new SUV almost a year ago, but it's taken until now for the first right-hand-drive models to arrive here. And we've driven one...\n\nPurists will hate the idea of a Lamborghini SUV\n\nFor those of you with good memories you'll know this isn't the first Lamborghini 'passenger ' (not including tractors) 4X4.\n\nThe original was the LM002 - the result of a failed military project that was turned into an exclusive offroader in 1986.\n\nJust 301 were built, each costing around \u00a396,000 new - the equivalent of \u00a3277,000 today - and they were powered by a 5.2-litre V12 engine that necked a gallon of fuel every five miles. It wasn't what you'd call a family car.\n\nBut the Urus is a whole different prospect. While it might not be Lamborghini's original offroader, it is the first SUV, aka sports utility vehicle, rubber stamped with a rampaging bull on the bonnet.\n\nAnd it\u2019s those three letters that have left traditionalists, enthusiasts and plenty others grinding their teeth in disdain.\n\nBecause while mainstream brands like BMW, Ford and Volkswagen have been forgiven for saturating the market with these jacked-up hatchbacks, sports car makers haven\u2019t received the same pardon when announcing their own stilted vehicles.\n\nFor a brand like Lamborghini, which has exotica pumping through its veins, to sell a wealthy family-focused SUV is, for many, sacrilegious.\n\nAnd the decision has been met with added scepticism since it was revealed that the Urus is heavily based on the Audi Q7 - a \u00a352,00 premium German SUV that's about as far from a rip-roaring Lambo as you can get.\n\nThe LM002 was the original Lamborghini 'passenger' 4X4, though it was a totally different prospect to the new Urus\n\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a The LM002 was first called the Cheetah and designed to transport military troops. However, once the project was canned, it was converted into a luxury offroader for the public. The Urus has been developed so you can transport your small army\n\nMany aren't overwhelmed that Lamborghini now sells an enormous SUV that weighs the same as two Ford Fiestas\n\nThe Urus has all the Top Trumps stats of a proper Lamborghini\n\nBut fear not, concerned Lamborghini aficionados, as the Urus' performance figures are most definitely more Aventador than Audi.\n\nUnder the bonnet is a 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8 engine - the Italian supercar maker's first eight-cylinder motor not to be naturally aspirated - with stats that obliterate every other SUV in a game of Top Trumps.\n\nHeadlining is a power output of 641bhp and 627lb ft of torque; enough grunt to accelerate from a standstill to 62mph in 3.6 seconds and to a top speed of 190mph.\n\nAll of this from a vehicle that tips the scales at 2.2 tonnes, has five seats (unless you request the four-seat option at a cost of \u00a33,150) and a boot big enough to laugh in the face of a fully-loaded Ikea trolley.\n\nThe Urus shares a platform and many parts with this - the Audi Q7 SUV. Looking at the pair, it's hard to believe the two models are mechanically related at all\n\nUnder the bonnet is Lamborghini's first turbocharged V8. The 4.0-litre unit produces 641bhp and 627lb ft of torque. Like most engines today it is hidden beneath a cover, however.\n\nMeasuring in at over 5.1 metres, the Lamborghini Urus is 30cm longer than the average UK parking space\n\nWhile it might be as roomy and capacious as a practical family car, it certainly doesn't look like one. Actually, it\u2019s difficult to imagine there's an Audi lurking underneath.\n\nJust as when Porsche first showed us the Cayenne in 2003, it can be a challenge to fully appreciate the extreme design cues when they're cloaking such an enormous canvas.\n\nAnd the Urus is enormous. Borderline ridiculous. Especially when you consider it's almost half a metre longer than the average UK parking space.\n\nIt undoubtedly won\u2019t be to all tastes, but there\u2019s no denying it has all the presence and wow-factor a Lamborghini needs to command stares.\n\nBut you have to pay a hefty premium for all this bravado. Costing from just under \u00a3160,000, the Urus' price tag is arguably the most Lamborghini statistic of them all.\n\nOur test car, fully loaded with extra kit, was a staggering \u00a3208,000. Still, it's fractionally cheaper than the LM002, once you factor in inflation.\n\nOur car came specced with the optional four-seat layout with fully-adjustable chairs. As you can see, there's plenty of rear legroom (as there should be considering the size of the car). The boot can hold up to 616 litres of luggage - ideal for Ikea trips\n\nLamborghini Urus specs at a glance On sale: now Price: from \u00a3157,800 Test car price: \u00a3208,000 Available from: Spring 2018 Engine: 4.0-litre, twin-turbo V8 petrol Transmission: 8-speed automatic Drive: 4WD with integrated front differential, central differential and active torque vecturing rear differential Power: 641bhp Torque: 627lb ft at 2,250-4,500rpm Top speed: 190mph Acceleration 0-62mph: 3.6 seconds Acceleration 0-124mph: 12.8 seconds Dimensions Lengths: 5,112mm Width: 2.016mm Height: 1,638mm Weight: 2,200kg Fuel tank size: 85 litres Boot capacity: 616 litres\n\nIt might look like an SUV, but the Urus doesn't drive like one\n\nIt's flabbergasting how unlike an SUV this behemoth feels to drive. Once the enormous optional 23-inch wheels (priced at an eye-watering \u00a34,725) start to turn, you quickly forget how high you had to lever your backside up into the driver\u2019s seat.\n\nThat\u2019s because it rides more like a slammed sports car than a raised up family wagon.\n\nNo matter how hard you mash the throttle into the floor, jump on the brake pedal or exuberantly fling all 2,200kg of bulk into a corner, there isn\u2019t a hint \u2013 not even a suggestion - of body roll, pitch or lean. It somehow defies SUV physics.\n\nAnd it\u2019s technological wizardry that helps mask all its mass.\n\nWe were blown away by how well the Urus handles, despite its hefty weight and raised cabin. No matter how hard you corner, there's no sense of body roll or the car leaning to one side\n\nThe Urus has an integrated front differential, central differential and active torque vecturing rear differential. Translated into English, that means it can decide exactly how much power needs to be delivered to which wheels to get best traction\n\nWe conducted a mini test on a muddy track to barely test the offroading abilities of the Urus. Not that many will see anything other than tarmac anyway\n\nFor instance, active roll stability control firms the suspension on the outside wheel when cornering, preventing the chassis dipping onto one side and keeping the centre of gravity pinned exactly where Lamborghini wants it to be.\n\nIt also features a unique differential setup to deliver power where it needs to. Somehow it punches the hefty Urus out of corners like a 100-metre sprinter with the bang of a starting pistol still ringing in their eardrums.\n\nWhat\u2019s most impressive, though, is the rear-wheel steering system that's been borrowed from the latest Aventador. Not only does it introduce a nimbleness to this obese bull at low speeds, but it increases stability when you\u2019re charging at turns as if each one is a matador dressed from head to toe in red.\n\nHow does it work? At pedestrian speeds the rear wheels turn three degrees in the opposite direction to the front to reduce the turning circle and rotate the car faster. And at high speed they turn three degrees with the front wheels in an effort to improve lateral stability.\n\nThis, with the complement of sticky Pirelli P Zero tyres, makes the Urus pivot with incredible agility in town - perfect for parking and navigating mini roundabouts - yet makes it unrelentingly grippy when you've got the hammer down.\n\nPrices start at \u00a3157,800 for a 'standard' Urus. However, the price will sky rocket once you add options. Ours, with bigger 23-inch wheels, the four-seat configuration, a head-up display, upgraded sound system and TVs in the back cost \u00a3208,000\n\nShocking acceleration; shocking deceleration\n\nWhile Lamborghini purists might be miffed there\u2019s not a V12 or V10 engine under the bonnet, the 4.0-litre twin-turbocharged V8 bolted into place is far from a weakling substitute.\n\nWhat it lacks in revs (with a redline of 6,800rpm) it makes up with monumental torque that will have your torso mercilessly recoiled into the seat back at the stomp of a throttle.\n\nIn a straight line, it will eat even Porsche's most potent Cayenne Turbo. The Urus is three tenths of a second quicker to 62mph and has 13mph extra to work with at the top end. It's a no contest.\n\nIt sounds fantastic, too. As every Lamborghini should.\n\nThis savage acceleration, when combined with tank-like bulk, means the Urus needs equally ferocious stopping performance too.\n\nFortunately, that is an area that's been addressed. The 440mm carbon brake discs at the front are bigger than the alloy wheels you\u2019d find on most family hatchbacks. Even the rotors at the back measure in at 370mm.\n\nA dab of the brakes and speed is scrubbed off suitably. A wholehearted thrust on the pedal with your sole and you\u2019ll instantly book yourself a facial-reconstruction appointment with Doctor Windscreen.\n\nThe styling won't be to all tastes, though it does grow on you after a while. However, the Urus certainly looks less Lamborghini like from the rear\n\nThe Urus does have a menacing look about it. No other car I've driven this year has commanded so many gazes from onlookers\n\nHow big is the Urus? Here it is eclipsing one of the Hull family members' Toyota MR2. The size difference is startling\n\nThe Urus isn't super-SUV perfection, though...\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to be impressed by how such a mammoth SUV goes, stops and pirouettes, but it does have its faults.\n\nThese criticisms start with the steering feedback, which is almost ghost-like it's so lacking of feel, and the automatic eight-speed ZF transmission can be sluggish to engage on downshifts.\n\nThen there's the complete lack of ride comfort. It's a direct result of the firm suspension setup, massive wheels and low-profile tyres.\n\nFor those of us without a Lamborghini at home in the garage, it feels harsh, translating the tiniest groove in the tarmac directly to your internal organs. For existing Lambo owners, though, it will probably feel relatively cloud like.\n\nIt\u2019s a similar story with the fuel economy.\n\nI averaged 21mpg covering over 300 miles of varying road types. If you're persistently heavy with the foot controls I'd imagine it could empty its 65-litre tank almost as quickly as you can pump super-unleaded into it. Again, this won\u2019t matter to your average Lamborghini customer, who would look at this sort of economy as frugal, so it doesn't feel right to lambast it for failing to be fuel efficient.\n\nThe final issue is the biggest. Those rear door handles and, more importantly, where they're placed - they look like a complete after thought.\n\nIs the Urus a proper Lamborghini? Now I know its capabilities on the road, I'd argue it's the most mental Lambo we've seen for some time\n\nIt definitely isn't economical. On a mix of roads, including driving in the city, on motorways and Lincolnshire's best routes, it returned 21mpg. Although, that's not bad for a Lamborghini\n\nThe Cars & Motoring verdict\n\nIs the Urus a great car? Unquestionably. Though if you\u2019re shelling out \u00a3160,000 and more on any vehicle, it should be exceptional.\n\nThe important question I wanted to answer was: if a Lamborghini that weighs over two-tonnes, doesn't have a V10 or V12 engine and is heavily based on an Audi family SUV, is worthy of carrying the iconic charging bull badge on its panels?\n\nAfter just a few days of driving, I can confirm that it is.\n\nAt no point does it let you forget you're in a Lamborghini. The gargling sound, the explosive power, the race-car-like cabin - everything about it steals your attention at every given moment - and at the same time commands an open-mouthed, finger-pointing reaction from passers by. It's still as special as a Lamborghini should be.\n\nSome purists hate it because it's not a supercar with oddball doors. In their eyes, it's too civilised. It's not crazy enough to be a proper Lambo.\n\nBut consider this: it turns, accelerates and stops just like the rest of Lamborghini's supercars. And the fact the Urus can do that and be a humongous SUV with a massive boot and room for the entire family makes it one of the most mental Lamborghinis for some time.\n\nGet off my patch: This dog doesn't seem as impressed with the Lamborghini Urus as I was...\n\n\n\n", "description": "Lamborghini, which once brought us low slung models like the Countach and Diablo, has backhanded its supercar heritage with the release of a 5-door SUV.
