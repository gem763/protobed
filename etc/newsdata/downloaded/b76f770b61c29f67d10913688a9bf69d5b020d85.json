Prosecutors announced they will seek to call 12 other women who allege groping misconduct as witnesses against Gooding at his trial.\n\nGooding appeared before Judge Curtis Farber for his arraignment and was released on his own recognizance.\n\nFarber set Dec. 13 for the next hearing in the case, when he will rule on whether prosecutors can call other accusers of uncharged crimes, called Molineux witnesses in New York, to help establish whether the defendant has engaged in a pattern of \"prior bad acts.\"\n\nThe new indictment of Gooding, unsealed Tuesday, adds another charge to the original misdemeanor charge of \"forcible touching\" stemming from an encounter with a woman in a Manhattan rooftop bar in June.\n\nCuba Gooding Jr. departs his arraignment in New York on Oct. 15, 2019, on a second charge of sexual misconduct.

The encounters they describe allegedly took place in bars or restaurants in New York, California, Texas and New Mexico. The crimes they allege range from groping, squeezing, rubbing, biting, kissing, licking, and grabbing genitals, all without consent.\n\nCuba Gooding Jr. departs his arraignment in New York on Oct. 15, 2019.

CLARY/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nMark Heller, one of Gooding's defense attorneys, said outside court that he is \"shocked, outraged and absolutely dumbfounded\" by developments in the case. He accused prosecutors of being \"unready\" to take the original charge to trial and rather than be \"embarrassed,\" they moved the case to a grand jury in order to add a second case that is \"even less credible charge than the first one.\"\n\nGooding, 51, who was charged in June with grabbing the breast of a woman in a Manhattan rooftop bar, returned to court because he was indicted last week on that charge, plus a new and separate misdemeanor sex crime involving a second accuser.\n\nWearing a dark suit and tie, he was handcuffed by New York police and escorted into the courtroom for the arraignment. His trial, originally set to start last week, has been indefinitely delayed.\n\nNeither prosecutors nor defense lawyers identified either the original accuser or the second accuser by name. The 12 other accusers also are not identified in court documents other than as MW#1 through 12.\n\nHeller claimed the second accuser approached Gooding through his lawyers after he was arrested in June and sought money from him in connection with an encounter in October 2018.\n\nCuba Gooding Jr. arrives at court in New York Oct. 10, 2019, for a proceeding on his groping case.

Heller, who accused prosecutors of delaying tactics, said he will demand the trial on the original charge start immediately.\n\n\"I'm confident this second misdemeanor added to the original case will be dismissed (eventually),\" Heller said.\n\nResponding on Monday to reports three more women came forward to police, Heller said he doesn't believe there are three other accusers with credible allegations, nor could prosecutors add such allegations to the tally against Gooding at an arraignment.\n\n\"They can\u2019t simply add, it has to be taken to a grand jury, and if they didn\u2019t do it now, it's not likely they'll do it again,\" Heller said. \"These 'other' cases, the district attorney did not have the confidence or the evidence that they are prosecutable, and that\u2019s why they were not (included) in the indictment.\"\n\nJustin Henry, a spokesman for the Manhattan district attorney's office, said Judge Farber's response to the Molineux motion is due Nov. 13, and prosecutors' reply to defense motions is due Dec. 2.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/15/cuba-gooding-jr-pleads-not-guilty-new-sex-crime-charge/3983411002/", "description": "Cuba Gooding Jr. was arraigned and pleaded not guilty to a new sex crime charge, as prosecutors sought to call 12 other accusers to testify at trial.", "authors": ["Maria Puente", "Published P.M.
