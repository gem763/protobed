The quality of his life had changed so dramatically and he was in more pain every day.\n\n\u201cHe was losing his sight. His body became weaker as he suffered mild fits. It was so distressing to see him deteriorating in this way.\"\n\nBut Mary, who still lives in the home given to her by the late star, says Freddie was \"peaceful\" at the end and \"died with a smile on his face\".\n\nAnd even though Freddie was famously gay, he has said he never stopped loving Mary - even after their relationship ended.\n\n(Image: Richard Young/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nIn a new book about his life, Freddie Mercury: A Life In His Own Words, the singer said: \"There have only been two individuals who have given back as much love to me as I gave to them. Mary, with whom I had a long affair, and our cat, Jerry.\n\n\u201cMy bond with Mary seems to grow and grow.\n\n\u201cI might have all the problems in the world, but I have Mary and that gets me through\u2026 I still see her every day and I am fond of her now as I have ever been.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll love her until I draw my last breath. We\u2019ll probably grow old together.\u201d\n\nAnd in his final days Freddie had one last request for Mary - and one she has followed to the letter.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nHe asked that she alone must be the one to collect his ashes after his body was cremated.\n\nFreddie, who died aged just 45, then asked Mary to dispose of them in a private plpace and make sure no one ever found out where.\n\nFor more than 20 years, Mary has never revealed Freddie Mercury's final resting place out of respect for the man she loved so deeply.\n\nAnd the Queen legend had a heartbreaking reason for his request in his last days.\n\nFreddie lost his battle against AIDS in 1991, at a time when the illness was still very much feared.\n\n(Image: INTERNET UNKNOWN)\n\nMary believes he was worried his final resting place would be targeted by vandals.\n\nIn an interview with Mail Online Mary said: \"He didn't want anyone trying to dig him up as has happened with some famous people.\n\n\"Fans can be deeply obsessive - he wanted it to remain a secret and it will remain so.\"\n\nMary took her vow to her former partner so seriously not even his parents know where his ashes are.\n\nAnd Mary took every care with her mission, not even telling her driver or the staff in the house that had been Freddie's what she was doing.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nFor two years after his tragic death, Mary kept Freddie's ashes in his bedroom.\n\nThen, one day, she slipped out of the home that was now hers and fulfiled one of Freddie's final wishes.\n\nEver since the rumours as to where Freddie's final resting place is have circulated.\n\nSome believe he was returned to Zanzibar, while others claim his ashes are buried under a cherry tree in the garden of his London home.\n\nSix years ago, when a plinth was built in Kensal Green cemetery, his fans believed this was where he was buried.\n\nThe only clue Mary will give as to the location of Freddie's ashes is that he is not there.\n\nAnd she insists it will always remain that way.\n\nMary said: \"Nobody will ever know where he is buried because that was his wish.\"", "description": "Mary Austin was the love of Freddie Mercury's life and when he died he left her with one very special task", "authors": ["Jane Lavender", "James Brinsford", "Image", "Alan Davidson Rex Shutterstock", "Richard Young Rex Shutterstock", "Getty Images", "Internet Unknown", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20669994.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Freddie-Mercurys-38th-Birthday-05-Sep-1985.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
