That plucky sitcom which catapulted her into the status of super, superstar in the 90s.\n\nThe star chatted with Jimmy Kimmel on Wednesday night and tried to recall the first moment she saw her face blown up to ridiculous proportions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I would want to say Friends\u2026 I\u2019m sure it was Friends,\u2019 the Morning Show star strained herself to think.\n\nJen stored the memory in her mind (Picture: BACKGRID)\n\n\u2018I had one vivid memory of [2004 film] Along Came Polly where I was driving on, I want to say, Fairfax or La Brea, right by the Wholefoods, and it was this huge\u2026\n\n\u2018That was the first time I saw a big, big horizontal poster with my name in the title.\u2019\n\nShe added with a cheeky grin: \u2018I thought it was pretty cool.\u2019\n\nIt was in the age before smartphones were the norm and well before Jennifer had joined Instagram \u2013 which happened on Tuesday, if you were wondering \u2013 as Jimmy joked she wasn\u2019t able to take a picture to share it for the world to see.\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t but I did it right here,\u2019 Jen laughed as she pointed to her head.\n\nAs Jimmy continued to joke it can\u2019t go online if it\u2019s in your head, she added, pointing to her heart: \u2018No, but it goes into here.\u2019\n\nCan\u2019t fault her logic.\n\nThe actor, 50, racked up over 11.5 million followers in one day after making her debut on the social media platform with a photo of her and the rest of the Friends cast, but has now admitted she\u2019s been using the site for a while.\n\nJen told Jimmy that she\u2019d been lurking on the site with a fake profile for ages, in order to get used to how it all works before making her debut.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe explained: \u2018It was a stalker account, yes. When I was thinking about doing this I figured it was time to kind of understand the world [of Instagram] and dip my toe into the social media pool.\u2019\n\nHer debut on Instagram actually broke Guinness World Records, beating even Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u2019s account for clocking up a million followers in just five hours and 16 minutes.\n\nJennifer admitted that the reason she decided to finally succumb to the \u2018Gram is that people kept asking her to create an account so she finally gave in.\n\nShe explained: \u2018I\u2019m like the most reluctant person to join Instagram. What you resist, persists so what the hey, just do it.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m just trying to build content as they say. I\u2019m going to try to be really good about it.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
