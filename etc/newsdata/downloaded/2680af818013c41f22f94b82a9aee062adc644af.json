For some young people, Christianity is associated less with love than with hate.\n\n\u201cPompous right-wing political chest-thumping, and an unwillingness to listen on matters like climate change or racism, has contributed to a perception by millions that Christianity is irrelevant, or worse yet, a threat to progress,\u201d the Rev. Richard Cizik, the leader of a group of self-described \u201cnew evangelicals\u201d with moderate views, told me. \u201cThat\u2019s a real burden to carry going into the 21st century.\u201d\n\nCizik, who was fired from the National Association of Evangelicals in 2008 after he expressed support for civil unions for gay people, added that Christianity\u2019s reputation suffers from backward views on women\u2019s issues and from the unwavering support among evangelical hard-liners for President Trump.\n\n\u201cTrump has played them like a fiddle,\u201d he said.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nicholas Kristof", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Sunday Christianity-United-States.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
