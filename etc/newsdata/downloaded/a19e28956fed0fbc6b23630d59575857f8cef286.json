They found out about it like Democrats, late at night and on Twitter.\n\nFor Republicans, it was a reminder that having the president\u2019s back can be a one-way proposition, especially with a commander in chief who likes to make decisions from his \u201cgut.\u201d\n\nEven as Turkish bombs fell Wednesday on northern Syria, Sen. Lindsey Graham, a frequent Trump golf club buddy and a presidential educator on foreign policy, talked to the president through television appearances and Twitter. He warned on \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d a program that Trump is known to make part of his morning routine, that he\u2019s making the \u201cbiggest mistake of his presidency.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is never wise to abandon an ally who has sacrificed on your behalf,\u201d Graham, a South Carolina Republican, tweeted at one point.\n\nHe was referring to U.S.-backed Kurdish forces fighting ISIS. But that advice might also apply to Trump\u2019s relationship with his GOP allies, most of whom lined up in rare agreement with Democrats against the president\u2019s Syria policy.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, whom Trump has referred to as \u201cmy Kevin,\u201d said on Fox that he would have to call the president. On Wednesday, the California Republican tweeted that the Turkish attack \u201cthreatens to halt momentum against ISIS, directly assaults\u201d partners in the Syrian Democratic Forces \u201cand could give the likes of al-Qaeda and Iran new footholds in the region.\u201d\n\nOne of the only Republicans in Congress supportive of a Syria withdrawal, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, told reporters on a conference call that he heard about Trump\u2019s shift of U.S. forces from the media.\n\nThe Republicans appeared to be as in the dark as a bipartisan delegation with several first-term House Democrats who heard about Trump\u2019s pullback in Syria while on a flight home from an official trip to Turkey, Afghanistan and Jordan. They quickly cobbled together a joint statement as they waited in customs at Dulles International Airport. Some sat on a bench at baggage claim to write it.\n\nSigning on was delegation member Elise Stefanik, a Republican congresswoman from New York, who also tweeted the condemnation of Trump\u2019s policy.\n\nTwo lawmakers on the trip said that even Trump appointees they met overseas did not indicate that they knew about the president\u2019s plans.\n\n\u201cQuite the opposite,\u201d said Democratic Rep. Jason Crow of Colorado.\n\n\u201cNowhere in the conversation (overseas) was what happens if the United States condones, accept or even encourages\u201d any moves by Turkey, said Rep. Abigail Spanberger, another first-term Democrat who was part of the delegation.\n\nIt all highlighted the unpredictability of Trump\u2019s foreign policy, which has confounded enemies and allies alike. The president likes to make decisions with little warning, often in the form of a tweet. Longtime U.S. allies are often the last to know.\n\n\u201cThe stupid endless wars, for us, are ending!\u201d Trump tweeted, pledging to punish Turkey economically if it goes too far in its assault.\n\nTrump\u2019s habit of abrupt U-turns and embellishment is part of his operating style.\n\n\u201cPredicting what Trump will do begins with accepting that he strives for surprise,\u201d said Trump biographer Michael D\u2019Antonio. \u201cHe also prefers to create both the problem and the solution, so he can appear to be a savior.\u201d\n\nGraham, a sharp-spoken critic of Trump during the 2016 election, has turned into a staunch ally. He frequently flatters the president, even kicking off his Syria criticism by saying earlier in the week, \u201cI like President Trump. I\u2019ve tried to help him.\u201d\n\nFor the third day running, Graham tweeted foreign policy lessons in staccato missives against Trump\u2019s isolationist tendencies.\n\n\u201cAmerican isolationism: (asterisk) Did not work before WWII. (asterisk) Did not work before 9/11.(asterisk) Will not work now,\u201d he wrote.\n\nGraham urged prayers for \u201cour Kurdish allies who have been shamelessly abandoned by the Trump Administration,\u201d adding, \u201cThis move ensures the reemergence of ISIS.\u201d\n\nThat followed a remark that seemed certain to get the president\u2019s attention, likening Trump\u2019s decision to one made by Democrat Barack Obama to stand down American forces in Iraq.\n\n\u201cNo matter what President Trump is saying about his decision,\u201d the South Carolina Republican tweeted, \u201cit is EXACTLY what President Obama did in Iraq with even more disastrous consequences for our national security.\u201d\n\nTrump did not back off.\n\nHe announced Tuesday that he and Erdogan will meet at the White House on Nov. 13.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press Writer Deb Riechmann contributed from Washington.\n\n___\n\nFollow Kellman on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/APLaurieKellman", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 For once, Republicans and Democrats in Congress were in the same place: out of the loop.
