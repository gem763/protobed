Sign up for the Today\u2019s WorldView newsletter.\n\nA year ago, Jamal Khashoggi \u2014 a Saudi commentator and dissident living in de facto exile \u2014 entered his nation\u2019s consulate in Istanbul, never to return. The months since Khashoggi\u2019s abduction and brutal killing by a Saudi hit squad have brought great uproar but insufficient justice. A handful of Saudi officials were indicted and punished by authorities in Riyadh for orchestrating a supposedly rogue operation. But U.S. intelligence officials believe Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had direct knowledge of the mission targeting Khashoggi, a Washington Post contributor. The Saudi royal denies the allegation and, with the support of President Trump and his allies, has been mostly rehabilitated on the world stage.\n\nBut the memory of Khashoggi\u2019s life and work endures. To honor the anniversary of his chilling death, my colleagues at The Post\u2019s Opinions section commissioned pieces on Khashoggi, his political views and the regime that sought to snuff them out. They underscore the legacy of a writer whose quest for freedom, democracy and tolerance didn\u2019t end in the torture chamber of a consulate.\n\nKhashoggi was hardly a fringe figure. He was born into privilege and first became known to Western journalists as a prominent Saudi author and editor with connections to the kingdom\u2019s princely elites. He was an insider, not a dissident.\n\nOver time, though, he came to espouse beliefs at odds with the court in Riyadh and those in most of the Arab world\u2019s other monarchies: an embrace of political liberalization, a hope for the opening of space for democratic rights and an interest in the ideas of political Islam. The upheavals of the pro-democracy uprisings in 2011 \u2014 and the crackdowns and conflicts that followed \u2014 created a new generation of Arab exiles. Khashoggi\u2019s relative fame in Saudi Arabia and desire for reform ultimately led him to join their ranks.\n\n\u201cJamal gave up on his government\u2019s will to change later than many; but his insider knowledge of the Saudi regime made clear that speaking up required getting out,\u201d wrote Tamara Cofman Wittes, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former State Department official.\n\nOne year later, our murdered friend Jamal Khashoggi has been proved right https://t.co/wHmEg8gGVA \u2014 Jason Rezaian (@jrezaian) October 1, 2019\n\nKhashoggi\u2019s semiregular column at The Post, which often took aim at Mohammed, made him a target. He opposed the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen, a pet project of the crown prince. And, while not rejecting outright the ambitious royal\u2019s plans to modernize and reform Saudi Arabia, Khashoggi stood against the crown prince\u2019s persecution of critics at home and attacks on Islamist political parties across the region.\n\n\u201cThe Saudi monarchy might claim to be forward-thinking with its Vision 2030 modernization plan and efforts to court Western leaders,\u201d wrote Hala Al-Dosari, a Saudi dissident and writer, who pointed also to the arrest of a number of female civil society activists under the crown prince\u2019s watch. \u201cIn reality, however, it has simply institutionalized a centuries-old monarchic legacy of violence, disenfranchisement and repression. Jamal\u2019s brutal murder and the torture of female activists have brought this all to light.\u201d\n\nBut Khashoggi wasn\u2019t exactly a revolutionary. \u201cFor the dissident Arab communities in exile and in the region, he offered an integral element that had been missing since the fall of the Arab Spring,\u201d noted Mohamed Soltan, an Egyptian American activist. \u201cUnlike many other dissidents, Jamal had experience championing reforms from within circles of power. He spoke often of the ways good people brought about positive change from within faulty systems.\u201d\n\nKhashoggi\u2019s friends overseas, including those who disagreed with his Islamist sympathies, welcomed his rigorous support for democracy and pluralism, for the building of a tolerant political space in Arab societies that has proved all too elusive in recent history.\n\n\u201cUnless Islamists and liberals are able to agree on the relationship between majority rule and individual rights, we will never be able to coexist peacefully \u2014 and ultimately will achieve neither majority rule nor individual rights,\u201d wrote Ezzedine C. Fishere, a visiting professor at Dartmouth College. \u201cDictators will be able to continue justifying their authoritarianism by arguing it is needed to maintain peace between two camps who can\u2019t agree on the fundamentals of peaceful coexistence. And they will be right.\u201d\n\nIn his gentle ripostes to the ruling authorities of his own country, Khashoggi hoped to prove the dictators wrong. Even in death, he has. In various Arab countries this year, people power movements have once more threatened the authoritarian status quo, no matter the powerful forces arrayed against them.\n\n\u201cThe Saudis and the UAE gave billions to prop up Sudan\u2019s military regime in the hope it would withstand a mass protest movement, only to see the generals strike a deal for a three-year transition to democracy,\u201d noted a Post editorial. \u201cAlgeria, too, has seen the rise of a powerful democracy movement, and Tunisia is holding a robustly competitive presidential election. Recently, protests erupted in Egypt, where another military regime has received billions in Saudi subsidies, after a dissident businessman\u2019s message went viral.\u201d\n\n\"Did you order the murder of Jamal Khashoggi?\" Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman talks with Norah O'Donnell about the 2018 murder of the Washington Post columnist, Sunday on \"60 Minutes\" https://t.co/TEJoJKwvfd pic.twitter.com/cacoxYXNKY \u2014 60 Minutes (@60Minutes) September 27, 2019\n\nYet that\u2019s a cold comfort. That Khashoggi, a figure with international clout and friends in high places, could be killed with such brazenness horrified onlookers and exiled dissidents elsewhere. Iyad el-Baghdadi, another Arab activist in exile, sees Riyadh\u2019s silencing of Khashoggi as part of a broader squeezing of dissent, one that has extended deep into online networks as well.\n\n\u201cWhen Jamal chose exile in the summer of 2017, it was a few weeks ahead of a wave of mass arrests that targeted dissidents and intellectuals,\u201d wrote el-Baghdadi. \u201cThere was one thing that many of the victims had in common: large social media followings. More than targeting the dissidents themselves, the arrests were part of a plan to degrade and conquer the last remaining open, inclusive Arab public sphere.\u201d\n\nNor has it helped that Western governments, especially the Trump administration, have placed their strategic interests in allying with Saudi Arabia ahead of a principled moral stand about the kingdom\u2019s behavior. Khashoggi\u2019s memory, argue his friends and supporters, will be a perennial thorn in the side of regional realpolitik.\n\n\u201cJamal, both in his long struggle to bring the perfidies of the Saudi regime to light and in the memory of his horrific death, will always symbolize the perseverance of the deep rebellion among Muslims against their dynastic dictators,\u201d wrote Turkish columnist Asli Aydintasbas. \u201cWestern leaders might continue to choose to work with these despots. But Jamal\u2019s example will always remind us that one day, they will have to deal with the restless reality of the region\u2019s people, too. The dictators might protect Western interests, but they cannot rescue the Western soul.\u201d\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday, along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions?
