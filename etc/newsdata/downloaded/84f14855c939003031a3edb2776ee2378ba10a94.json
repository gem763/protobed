U.S. GCcv1 dipped 0.3% to $1,508.80.\n\n\"Hopes that Saudi Arabia's production is going to come back online and oil prices will start to depreciate have boosted market sentiment, so we continue to see some calm across the markets ahead of the Fed meeting,\" said FXTM analyst Lukman Otunuga.\n\nOil prices retraced, having surged nearly 15% earlier in the week, after Saudi Arabia's energy minister said the country would restore its lost production by month-end, having restored customer supplies to levels they were prior to attacks on its key facilities.

However, we believe that price-supportive factors should gain the upper hand in the longer term.\"\n\nAmong other precious metals, silver slipped 1% to $17.84 an ounce, while platinum dropped 0.8% to $935.49 and palladium eased by 0.2% to $1,595.94.", "description": "PRECIOUS-Gold holds tight range as investors await Fed verdict", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEB5405E_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
