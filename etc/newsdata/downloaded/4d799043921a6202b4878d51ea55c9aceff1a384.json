Five other judges hearing cases are based at the Port Isabel detention center, a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement jail adjacent to Brownsville.\n\nThe courts opened this month to process some of the 42,000 migrants forced to remain in Mexico under the Trump administration's Migrant Protection Protocols. Some say they have been attacked and extorted in Mexico.\n\nThe U.S. government refuses to let observers inside the tent courts to watch proceedings, citing security concerns. ICE hasn't said if it will allow observers inside Port Isabel.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
