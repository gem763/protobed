REUTERS/Azad Lashkari\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said, however, that Washington aimed eventually to bring the troops withdrawing from Syria back to the United States.\n\nThe Iraqi military statement contradicted the Pentagon\u2019s announcement that all of the nearly 1,000 troops withdrawing from northern Syria are expected to move to western Iraq to continue the campaign against Islamic State militants and \u201cto help defend Iraq\u201d.\n\n\u201cAll U.S. forces that withdrew from Syria received approval to enter the Kurdistan Region so that they may be transported outside Iraq. There is no permission granted for these forces to stay inside Iraq,\u201d the Iraqi military said.\n\nEsper said Washington\u2019s objective was for the troops not to remain in Iraq.\n\n\u201cThe aim isn\u2019t to stay in Iraq interminably, the aim is to pull our soldiers out and eventually get them back home,\u201d Esper said at the Prince Sultan Air Base near Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\n\nEsper said the details had not yet been worked out on how long the U.S. troops would stay in Iraq and he would be having discussions with his Iraqi counterpart on Wednesday.\n\nIt is unclear whether the U.S. troops will use Iraq as a base to launch ground raids into Syria and carry out air strikes against Islamic State militants.\n\nThe additional U.S. troops would add to the more than 5,000 American troops already based in the country, training Iraqi forces and helping to ensure that Islamic State militants do not make a comeback.\n\n\u201cNOT A MERCENARY FORCE\u201d\n\nEsper, speaking in front of a Patriot missile battery where he was meeting U.S. troops, said Saudi Arabia had agreed to help underwrite the deployment to the kingdom. He did not provide details on what specifically Saudi Arabia had agreed to pay for.\n\nThe United States has deployed thousands of additional military forces in recent months to bolster Saudi defences, including an air expeditionary wing and air defence personnel.\n\nThat includes radar systems, Patriot missiles and support personnel to bolster Saudi Arabia\u2019s defences after the largest-ever attack on the kingdom\u2019s oil facilities on Sept. 14.\n\nSome experts have criticized President Donald Trump\u2019s administration for saying that Saudi Arabia will pay for the deployment of U.S. troops to the Kingdom, suggesting it makes the U.S. military a mercenary force.\n\nRelatives of a member of the Syrian Kurdish (YPG) militia, who was killed during clashes in Syria, react during a funeral in Kirkuk, Iraq, October 21, 2019.
