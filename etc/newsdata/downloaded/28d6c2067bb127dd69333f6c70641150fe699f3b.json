The incident sparked national outrage and was widely criticized as racist.\n\nThe Galveston Police Department released videos of Donald Neely\u2019s Aug. 3rd arrest on Wednesday taken by both officers\u2019 body cameras after calls from Neely\u2019s family and protestors for the footage to be made public.\n\nIn the videos, officers Patrick Brosch and Amanda Smith are seen arresting 43-year-old Neely for criminal trespass, as he appears to be lying down outside a building in downtown Galveston. \u201cYou were asked by the property manager not to come back here,\u201d officer Brosch says, alleging that Neely had already been arrested \u201cmultiple times\u201d for trespass at the location.\n\nThe officers then tie a rope around Neely\u2019s handcuffs, and tell him to walk ahead of them as they rode their horses. They led Neely to a parking lot where their horse trailer and truck were parked. The footage then shows him being transported to jail in a police squad car; he was later charged with misdemeanor criminal trespass and released on bond.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

You have to stay next to me,\u201d Officer Smith is heard saying in the video.\n\nAs the officers pass through a more populated area, they appear to consider the optics of their arrest. \u201cThis is going to look really bad,\u201d officer Brosch repeats throughout the video.\n\nAt one point, Brosch also asks Smith if she wants to divert to a street with less traffic. \u201cYeah, I want less eyesight,\u201d Smith said in the video.\n\nAfter photos of the incident began to circulate in August, Galveston police chief Vernon L. Hale III apologized for the officers\u2019 actions in a press statement, while arguing the method of the arrest was acceptable procedure.\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost I must apologize to Mister Neely for this unnecessary embarrassment,\u201d Hale said. \u201cMy officers did not have any malicious intent at the time of the arrest, but we have immediately changed the policy to prevent the use of this technique and will review all mounted training and procedures for more appropriate methods.\u201d\n\nThe Texas Rangers, a division of the state\u2019s Department of Public Safety, conducted an inquiry into the officers\u2019 actions. They found \u201cthere was nothing that warranted a criminal investigation,\u201d according to a statement from the office.\n\nOn Oct. 2nd, the Galveston Police Department said that they had received a second administrative report into the incident from the Galveston County Sheriff\u2019s Office. \u201cI am studying the report now and will use its findings to make decisions in the near future about the next steps for the department,\u201d Chief Hale said in a statement released by the city.\n\nNeither of the officers involved have commented on the incident, though the Houston Chronicle reports they have since been placed on \u201cmodified duty.\u201d Local news station KHOU11 also reports that Galveston\u2019s mounted patrol program is \u201cnot currently in use.\u201d (TIME has reached out to the Galveston Police Department with a request for comment.)\n\n\u201cDue to Civil Service rules, any discipline would be at the sole discretion of Chief Hale,\u201d Galveston city manager Brian Maxwell added in the city\u2019s statement. \u201cThe City supports the chief in any actions he deems to be appropriate; however, if the investigation identifies deficiencies in department policies or practices those will be addressed directly with the Chief.\u201d\n\nA march was held in Galveston on Sept. 15, during which Neely\u2019s family and their attorneys had called for the police to release the body camera footage. \u201cWe are here, brothers and sisters, for a teachable moment for America,\u201d prominent civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump said at the protest. \u201cWe are here because what has been seen cannot be unseen.\u201d\n\nWrite to Josiah Bates at josiah.bates@time.com.", "description": "Police in Galveston, Tex. have released the body camera footage from mounted officers who arrested a black man and walked him tied to a rope", "authors": ["Josiah Bates"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/police-horseback-arrest.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}
