It is part of the gig. But Trump\u2019s way of lurching into a room is inseparable from his propensity for creating chaos and obliterating meaning. \u201cThank you very much, thank you very much,\u201d he booms as he steps into the United Nations lobby. He seems to be addressing this thanks to everyone in the room, as if all those present have just burst into applause. (They haven\u2019t.) He is merely Being Trump, doing what he does when he shows up anyplace, whether it\u2019s a meeting of the Group of 7 or a wreath-laying commemoration at Arlington National Cemetery or a Super Bowl party at Mar-a-Lago: subjugating the entire purpose of the event to his own ego and id. It is a demeanor that announces that if anything is going to get done today, it will happen in spite, probably in defiance, of the president of the United States.\n\nTrump wound up attending the climate meeting for about 15 minutes. There were more pressing matters to attend to. He posted on Twitter a dozen times that day, including tweets mocking Mitt Romney, Joe Biden and Adam Schiff. He also directed a trolling tweet at Thunberg: \u201cShe seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!\u201d\n\nWe are not \u201call Greta Thunberg,\u201d but all of us know what it\u2019s like to be ambushed by Donald Trump. He pops up on your social media feed with hateful words and impulsive policy announcements. He flickers on TV screens in bus terminals and airport departure lounges, forever looming over your shoulder. He barges unbidden into your dreams. It is a condition of being alive in America in 2019. No matter who you are or what you\u2019re trying to accomplish, whether you\u2019re a 16-year-old working to save the planet or an ordinary citizen trying to make it through the day with some peace of mind intact, you will inevitably confront the specter of Trump, drifting into the frame in a cloud of disorder and bad vibes. Even the president\u2019s most dedicated enablers scan the sky warily, awaiting today\u2019s cyclone, the next reckless, capricious twist of the plot. The door swings open, the president enters, all heads turn. The camera whips around, and suddenly, everything else \u2014 better angels, higher ideals, common decency, common sense, beauty, truth \u2014 blurs into the background.", "description": "We all know what it\u2019s like to be ambushed by the president, at least in our Twitter feeds. That\u2019s why a clip of Greta Thunberg scowling at him went viral.", "authors": ["Jody Rosen"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/27/magazine/27mag-screenlandv2/27mag-screenlandv2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
