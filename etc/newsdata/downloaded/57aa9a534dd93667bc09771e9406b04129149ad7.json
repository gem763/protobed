What's trickier is spotting its root causes.\n\nNot hiring, or \"fixing,\" a toxic employee can save you more than hiring a top worker. So it's good for business to learn what's creating toxic employees.\n\nIf an employee is self-centered, overconfident, or constantly talks about following the rules, you may have toxicity on your hands.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nSpotting toxicity in a workplace isn't hard given its prevalence (an astounding 76 percent of bosses are considered toxic by their employees). But spotting what causes it, the unspoken rules embedded in a culture or the specific employee traits most likely to lead toxic behavior, can be trickier.\n\nUnless you follow the findings of a major study on workplace toxicity conducted at Harvard University in a 2015 groundbreaking study. The study came back into the limelight at a recent event I keynoted at, with exasperated clients asking me after the talk how to address a toxic culture that was emerging at their company.\n\n\n\nHere's why it matters. For the first time the Harvard study pegged a financial number to solving the problem of the toxic employee (defined as one who engages in behavior that damages the company or fellow employees).\n\nSpecifically, while a top worker can return more than $5,000 in cost savings to a company through increased output, avoiding hiring or \"fixing\" a toxic employee nets well over $12,000 in savings (not including savings from avoiding litigation, regulatory penalties, or decreased productivity in other employees due to low morale induced by the toxic individual).\n\nThe money factor pales in comparison to the overall damage caused \u2014 other employees quitting at a faster and more frequent rate, a loss of customers, and the tanking of a culture.\n\nNow, about spotting the kind of behavior that will most commonly lead to future toxic behavior. Here's what the study found are the three biggest warning flags to watch for.", "description": "Cutting off toxicity is good for business, as fixing a toxic employee can save you $12,000, according to a Harvard study.", "authors": ["Scott Mautz"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5bff154ef556fc3fe9462b6b?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
