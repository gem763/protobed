Meanwhile, the underlying technology and the legal concept were jointly developed by Deutsche Boerse and Commerzbank, the firm noted.\n\nThe prototype settlement performed a delivery-versus-payment transaction and the transfer of tokenized cash. According to the announcement, digital tokens in the transaction were issued using both commercial bank money and securities, generating cash tokens and securities tokens.\n\nNew milestone in DLT use in post-trade services\n\nCommerzbank further deployed tokenized cash as collateral at Deutsche Boerse-owned global exchange Eurex Clearing, which served as a central counterparty and tokenizer of cash.\n\nMeanwhile, MEAG acted as the buyer of securities and Commerzbank as the seller and the custodian of the securities tokens, Deutsche Boerse noted.\n\nAccording to Deutsche Boerse, achieving the simultaneous swap of tokens as a final and binding settlement was enabled by using blockchain technology. As such, the transaction participants have reached another milestone in exploring the potential of distributed ledger technology in post-trade services, the press release notes.\n\nRegulators yet to approve the type of transaction\n\nThe concept of the pilot transaction has been shared with regulatory authorities, while further implementation remains subject to their approval, Deutsche Boerse added.\n\nFrank Wellhofer, a member of the MEAG\u2019s board of management, noted that the post-trade blockchain pilot unlocked a number of benefits such as reducing the need for third parties and speeding up the transaction process of securities. Wellhofer said:\n\n\u201cThe involvement of tokens representing securities and money will facilitate network efficiencies and build a foundation for the creation of standards. This is important for the buy side as standards lead to broader market acceptance and thus create liquidity on DLT platforms in general.\u201d\n\nIn March 2019, Commerzbank and Deutsche Boerse completed a proof-of-concept for a legally binding repo transaction based on blockchain.", "description": "Deutsche Boerse, Commerzbank and MEAG have piloted a post-trade securities transaction via tokens", "authors": ["Helen Partz"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvZDM4ODM5NzcwMTIyOTNhNTg1ZjAyNGMyOWM4YWUzMjAuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
