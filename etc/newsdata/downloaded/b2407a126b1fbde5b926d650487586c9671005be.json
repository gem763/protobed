This is an ideal time to visit a growth market like China if you have export aspirations hence the theme for our event being Shanghai Nights.\"\n\n\n\nAt the Awards Transnet Port Terminals (TPT) acting chief executive Michelle Phillips launched the Emerging Exporters Development Programme, a joint initiative by TPT and the Durban Chamber to develop emerging exporters.\n\nThe beneficiaries of the TPT and the Durban Chamber Emerging Exporters Development Programme are Get2Natural Beauty; Gugu Mobile Boutique; Samac Engineering Solutions; Siyazenzela Trailers & Truck Bodies; and Zikhe.\n\n", "description": "Transnet Port Terminals and the Durban Chamber of Commerce recently announced the winners of the 2019 KZN Exporter of the Year Awards.", "authors": ["Compiled Carin Smith"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4044/6ebf3d2d792d48cbb1b0d467018cd5f8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
