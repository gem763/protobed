So we need to get to the bottom of what may have happened,\u201d he said.\n\nIntelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson appeared on Capitol Hill behind closed doors on Thursday and said the complaint was related to multiple acts but wouldn\u2019t confirm that it was connected to Mr. Trump, according to lawmakers.\n\nMr. Trump on Thursday said he wouldn\u2019t be stupid enough to make such promises on such a call with a foreign leader.\n\n\u201c[I]s anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially \u2018heavily populated\u2019 call. I would only do what is right anyway, and only do good for the USA!\u201d the president said on Twitter.\n\nEarlier this month, House Democrats had announced an investigation into whether a hold-up in $250 million in security assistance to Ukraine was part of an effort on the part of the president \u201cto coerce the Ukrainian government into pursuing politically-motivated investigations, including of former Vice President Joe Biden and his family.\u201d\n\nSeveral days later, the White House indicated it would release the funds.\n\nThe New York Times reported earlier this year that on a trip to Kiev in March 2016, Mr. Biden had threatened to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees if Ukrainian officials didn\u2019t dismiss a prosecutor who was reportedly eyeing an energy company. Mr. Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, was on the board of the company at the time.\n\n\u201cAll the reporting has indicated that there is not a single, solitary thing was inappropriate about what my son did. He never once talked to me \u2014 never once talked to anybody in the administration,\u201d Mr. Biden said in May.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
