What makes this even more frustrating is that the Switch has Bluetooth, but Nintendo only uses it for connecting the Switch\u2019s Joy-Con, not audio. So to address this issue, SteelSeries made the Arctics 1 Wireless headset, which the company claims is the world\u2019s first USB-C wireless gaming headset that not only works with the Switch, but with the PC, PS4 and tons of mobile devices.\n\nHere\u2019s everything that comes with the Arctis 1 Wireless (aside from a spare 3.5mm cable). (Photo: Sam Rutherford, Gizmodo)\n\nInstead of relying on Bluetooth, SteelSeries opted for an even simpler solution, a USB-C dongle that plugs into your gadget of choice, which then transmits audio over a 2.4-GHz wireless connection. That\u2019s it, no need to pair the headset to your device or dig through menus. And when you\u2019re done gaming, you can unplug the Arctis 1 Wireless\u2019 dongle, detach the removable mic, and then plug the dongle into a phone to use the headset as a pair of wireless headphones.\n\nNow, for Switch owners wondering what happens when you try to dock your Switch but still want wireless audio, SteelSeries thought of that too. The Arctis 1 Wireless includes a USB-A to USB-C adaptor that you can plug into the Switch\u2019s dock. So when you get home, you can remove the dongle from your Switch, dock your Switch, and then plug the dongle back into the included the adaptor connected to the dock. (The USB-A to USB-C adaptor is also what you\u2019d use with a PS4, since it doesn\u2019t have any USB-C ports.)\n\nPhoto: Sam Rutherford, Gizmodo Photo: Sam Rutherford, Gizmodo SteelSeries uses mesh fabric earcups instead of leather which helps keep your head cooler while gaming.

As a bonus, the Arctis 1 Wireless also works with Fortnite on Switch\u2019s in-game chat system.\n\nThe Arctis 1 Wireless uses the same ski goggle-style headband and drivers SteelSeries uses on its more expensive headphones but with a tiny of extra bass for slightly deeper lows.\n\nIf you want to adjust the headset\u2019s sound profile, you can connect them to a PC running the free SteelSeries Engine app, which allows you to personalise the headset\u2019s EQ and then save those settings for use on other devices.\n\nThe Arctis 1 Wireless also comes with an old-school headphone jack and a double-sided 3.5mm cable, so you can plug the headset into an Xbox One controller (or any other gadget with a headphone jack) if you want.\n\nPhoto: Sam Rutherford, Gizmodo\n\nWith battery life of around 20 hours, you might be able to go a week between charges, depending on how much you game. The one small incompatibility to note is that when used with Samsung phones up to the Galaxy S10, you can\u2019t use the Arctis 1 to answer calls or use voice chat, which is a somewhat strange restriction put in place by Samsung\u2019s software.\n\nBut with support for four of the five largest gaming platforms (along with a wide variety of mobile devices) and a price tag of just $119.99 ($175), the Arctis 1 Wireless looks like a good solution for anyone looking to embrace cord-free audio, especially on the Nintendo Switch.\n\nThe Arctis 1 Wireless is available now, but expect to pay a substantial shipping fee if buying through the SteelSeries website.", "description": "Even though Nintendo recently refreshed the standard Switch with new guts and made a smaller version of its portable console in the upcoming Switch Lite, both suffer from a major omission: the lack of support for wireless audio.
