Now he wants to help you.\n\nThe \u201cAri Gold of Politics\u201d on the Rules Every Man Should Live By\n\n\u201cThree years ago, an intern stopped me in the hallway and said that to him, I\u2019m the Ari Gold of DC,\u201d says Michael Hardaway. \u201cI\u2019ve been called many things since then, both good and bad, but I\u2019ve always thought that was the most accurate characterization.\u201d\n\nWe can\u2019t help but agree: Hardaway is a political superagent, having advised anyone from members of congress to pro athletes on brand building and political engagement.\n\nHardaway also helped propel the first Black president, President Barack Obama, into the White House \u2014 an incident, he says, that was an accident in its inception. \u201cI met Barack Obama in Chicago when he was running for the Senate. I was in college. I met him at my weekend job at a private business club \u2014 think Trading Places \u2014 and, on the spot, cooked up a pitch for how I could deliver the college vote for him. I\u2019m not sure where that came from, and am not even sure there was a quantitative outcome proving that it worked. But we won that race and he was President of the United States four-and a half years later,\u201d says Hardaway. \u201cThat\u2019s when I figured out my gift in life: I can sell anything to anyone.\u201d\n\nNow having discovered his gift for selling, Michael is, fittingly, the head of Messaging and Communications for House Democrats and their Chairman, Congressman Hakeem Jeffries of New York. He aids Democrats in navigating key issues, from the potential impeachment of the president to immigration and healthcare.\n\nHardaway describes his style as irreverent. \u201cMy signature is the lapel flower and patent leather loafers,\u201d he says. \u201cI am sockless all year, no matter the weather. Needless to say, I don\u2019t believe in rules.\u201d He says this while wearing white cotton trousers, a white button-down shirt with the sleeves rolled up (he means business), a pink bracelet he acquired in Taiwan and fuschia statement loafers. \u201cFit is everything. Quality is critical. Brands mean nothing.\u201d\n\nConvinced that there\u2019s a smarter way to marry celebrity advocacy and lawmaking, Hardaway urges us to stay tuned. In the mean time, we urge you to listen to the man and check out his rules for living below \u2014 they might just change your life (as well as the hangers in your closet).\n\nThe 7 rules every man should live by \u2026\n\n\n\n1. Be your own man. \u201cStand on your own two feet. Don\u2019t waffle. Don\u2019t complain. In the end, there are no asterisks \u2014 only scoreboards.\u201d\n\n2. Read the Financial Times. \u201cAll wheat. No chaff.\u201d\n\n3. Master the details. \u201cWhether it\u2019s remembering your kid\u2019s favorite basketball player or the name of every congressman who co-sponsored your first bill, mastery of the minutiae makes a massive difference.\u201d\n\n4. Learn how to sell. \u201cYou\u2019ll never make good money or amass real power if you can\u2019t.\u201d\n\n5. Get a dog. \u201c12 years ago, I adopted a dog from the shelter, gave him a proper bath and named him Alfie. Best decision of my life.\u201d\n\n6. Embrace silence. \u201cWhether it\u2019s early-morning meditation or walking to the office with headphones in and no music, silence is the foundation of all creative ideas. You brain needs space to breathe.\u201d\n\n7. Celebrate friends\u2019 success. \u201cThere\u2019s no better feeling than seeing your friends and loved ones win. Nothing.\u201d\n\nAnd the 7 things he should divest himself of immediately \u2026\n\n\n\n1. Vapid pleasantries. \u201cAsking others how they\u2019re doing when you don\u2019t actually care leaves no winners.\u201d\n\n2. Cold weather. \u201cClose your eyes and think of your favorite memory from childhood. A frigid winter wind is the opposite of that feeling.\u201d\n\n3. Scooters. \u201cThey\u2019re for latchkey pre-teens in the suburbs. Not tax-paying adults.\u201d\n\n4. Sweatsuits. \u201cI don\u2019t care if Kanye wears them. There\u2019s no way to avoid looking like a torpid sloth.\u201d\n\n5. Wire hangers. \u201cIt\u2019s suit abuse. Invest in oak.\u201d\n\n6. Excuses. \u201cThey\u2019re a disease.\u201d\n\n7. The suit and running shoes look. \u201cI don\u2019t care if it\u2019s comfortable. Have some self respect.\u201d", "description": "Political superagent Michael Hardaway, whose helped propel Obama into the White House, shares the style rules evey man should follow.", "authors": ["Austa Somvichian-Clausen"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Hardaway.png?fit=1200%2C800", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
