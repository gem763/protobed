I am very concerned the input many domestic abuse survivors put into the bill over the years could be lost. If the bill is scrapped, it is disrespectful to those survivors.\u201d\n\nA domestic abuse survivor herself, she added: \u201cI am particularly concerned about the legal duty for refuges being lost. For us, that was a massive announcement. It correlates to the news last week that domestic violence killings have reached a five-year high. It is no surprise murders have gone up when refuge spaces have gone down. The legal duty would give refuges more protection from cuts.\n\n\u201cI am also worried about the ban on cross-examination of victims being lost. For me, that was one of the most important elements, if not the most important element, of the bill. If you haven\u2019t been a victim of domestic abuse you can\u2019t understand the absolute terror it creates for victims to be cross-examined by their perpetrator in family court. It is a horrific practice.\u201d\n\nMs Kneer, whose violent partner was jailed for seven years in 2011, argued this practice skews the outcome of court cases because it is impossible to get an \u201caccurate response\u201d from a victim if they are \u201cterrified\u201d of the person cross-examining them.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

It would be unacceptable if the ban is not delivered now.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cThe previous bill was also set to deliver other crucial components of a much-needed safety net for survivors, including statutory duty on local authorities to deliver support to survivors in refuges and ratification of the landmark Istanbul Convention \u2013 an international treaty on violence against women. We need a law that will deliver these vital protections, and many more across housing, immigration, the welfare state and the family courts. Survivors have waited long enough.\u201d\n\nThe comments came as the government announced the appointment of Nicole Jacobs as Britain\u2019s first domestic abuse commissioner.\n\nMs Jacobs, who was previously chief executive of charity Standing Together Against Domestic Violence, said ending the \"postcode lottery\" of support services available for victims is a priority.\n\nShe told the PA news agency her \"predominant task is about the mapping of services across England and Wales\".\n\nShe added: \"We have a real postcode lottery, essentially, where you have pockets of very good practice provision \u2013 and that can be within specialist servicing commissioning provision but also what statutory services should be doing; health, housing, the criminal justice system. So you've got very good services in some areas, not so good in others.\"\n\nThe original domestic abuse bill included measures that would mean perpetrators would no longer be able to directly cross-examine victims in family courts \u2013 as well as provisions to place a legal duty on councils to offer secure homes for those escaping violence and their children.\n\nThe legislation also contained provisions to introduce the first-ever statutory definition of domestic abuse to include economic abuse and controlling and manipulative behaviour that is not physical.\n\nAdditional reporting by Press Association", "description": "Campaigners and survivors\u00a0have criticised the government for refusing to say if the new domestic abuse bill will include \u201clife-saving\u201d provisions that\u00a0were outlined in the original legislation. Victoria Atkins, the Home Office minister for safeguarding, would not confirm whether the legislation will ban the cross-examination of victims by their alleged abusers despite it being", "authors": ["Maya Oppenheim"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/02/12/15/domestic-violence-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
