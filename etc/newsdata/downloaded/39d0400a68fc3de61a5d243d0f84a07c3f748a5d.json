The world is changing at such a fast pace that the high paying jobs of today did not even exist five years ago \u2013 and it\u2019s hard to predict what kind of jobs we will be doing in another five years\u2019 time. The reason for this big change? Software.\n\nNow the question is how we prepare our kids for the future, there is only one answer to that question: Coding. Both parents and educators believe that in a country like India, where the education system grapples with lack of innovation, infrastructure, and archaic curriculum, coding is a well-structured way to introduce children to logical thinking and problem-solving. This also prepares them for a job market dominated by data science and computer science.\n\nBefore the Industrial Revolution, fewer than 10% of schools taught mathematics, After the tipping point, every school introduced mathematics because that was the center of the revolution. Coding skills are to us now what mathematics was to the Industrial Revolution: underrated at the time, but invaluable decades later. Now we are in the middle of the computer revolution, and it\u2019s the same phenomenon: Schools need to realize the importance of coding as a skill.\n\nFor Chinese parents, teaching kids to code has become as important as teaching them maths and Chinese. In fact, many Chinese children are exposed to coding even before they enter pre-school. Now many Indian parents are also teaching children coding in pre-school. Servicing these needs in India are a great number of coding and programming centers in Bengaluru, Delhi, Mumbai, Gurugram, and Chandigarh. Most of these places use a common pool of tools and platforms\u2014such as Code Studio, LightBot, Botley or MIT\u2019s Scratch\u2014which were created for a western market where teaching children to code is already a flourishing industry. The goal is to nurture in a child the skill to develop a meticulous set of instructions in a language that the computer understands.\n\nIn the next 5-10 years, it would not matter which school children attend schooling rather how digitally literate these children are, especially with the introduction of 5G technology which would be paradigm-shifting and would upend the traditional methods of Education. Economists estimate the global economic impact of 5G in new goods and services will reach $12 trillion by 2035 as 5G moves mobile technology from connecting people to people and information, towards connecting people to everything. Today\u2019s hi-tech kids learn from the same books I used during my time at school 10 years ago. Our education system promotes rote learning, and this promotes conformism rather than curiosity in children. There is a rote learning raj that governs our schools.\n\nIf we do not introduce Coding in schools, then our children will be at a huge disadvantage and the future would be precarious. In 2017, Eupheus Learning, an ed-tech startup from Delhi, launched Cubetto which has been introduced in about 300 primary schools across India. Cubetto\u2019s innovation is the block-based coding language designed for children in pre-literate years. It is a coding solution without screens that teaches the basics of programming to toddlers.\n\nIn today\u2019s digital age, most children learn to swipe and click before they can speak coherently or walk. Smartphones and tablets are their digital pacifiers, companions and entertainers. Kids do not need to be proficient in reading or writing to do this because stories and images are used to explain the concepts.\n\nCoding is about much more than teaching technology. It incorporates logic, problem-solving, and creativity in an engaging way for children of all ages. The non-cognitive skills that children develop through coding lessons are even more beneficial to young learners than the technical skills they acquire. Coding allows students to be creative without being wrong. If something doesn\u2019t work, students must figure out why and determine how to fix it. Coding is the process of continually making mistakes, learning from them and correcting them. Coding requires creativity and critical thinking \u2013 future-ready skills, that, along with collaboration and communication, are essential. Best of all, coding allows students to create content, rather than simply consume it \u2013 and that\u2019s a must-have skill for functioning in today\u2019s tech-driven world.\n\nThe new Annual Employability report by Aspiring Minds reveals that 80% of Indian engineers are not fit for any job in the knowledge economy and only 2.5% of them possess tech skills in Artificial Intelligence (AI) that industry requires. Skills gaps have become an issue to both employers and the unemployed. This trend is exacerbated by technological advancements which are rapidly replacing manual jobs, leaving millions of young people unprepared to participate in the 21st-century knowledge economy.\n\nAccording to a report submitted by Mckinsey at the Leadership Forum, there would be job cuts between 1.75 lakh and 2 lakh per year in next three years, due to under-preparedness in adapting to newer technologies. The report also mentions that nearly half of the workforce in the IT services firms will be \u201cirrelevant\u201d over the next 3-4 years.\n\nWe cannot wait for the government to formulate policy, top-down approaches are lethargic and byzantine which takes a lot of time to be implemented which our children do not have. Parents and educators would have to take a pro-active approach or else our children will be left behind in the 4th Industrial revolution.", "description": "The Future of Jobs Report by the World Economic Forum has predicted 65% of children entering primary school today will ultimately end up working in completely new job types that do not even exist yet....", "authors": ["Javaid Sofi"], "top_image": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DP.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
