Atmospheric CO2 is rising sharply, peaking at 415 parts per million this year, far above the level during most of human history, around 300ppm.\n\nThe foundation aims to restore this historical norm by 2050, saying success would be on a par with the moon landing or the eradication of smallpox. It warns that the current climate is leading us \u201cdown a path toward the probable extinction of our species and thousands of others\u201d.\n\n\u201cMother Earth will survive without us but we\u2019d like for humans to survive too,\u201d said Rick Parnell, chief executive of the foundation, which was created last year. \u201cThis is the beginning of a 10-year strategy to get governments and companies to understand the need to restore our climate now. Humanity got us into this situation, it can get us out of it.\u201d\n\nGlobal average temperatures have increased by around 1C in the past century due to the build-up of planet-warming gases from human activity. World leaders have agreed to limit this rise to 2C, and ideally 1.5C, although global greenhouse gases are not declining and major emitters such as the US and Brazil have shown signs of going backwards.\n\nAny realistic chance of avoiding highly dangerous levels of global heating will likely involve the removal of CO2 from the atmosphere, either through mass reforestation or nascent technology that either eliminates it from industrial processes or sucks it directly from the air.\n\nQuick guide What is the Upside? Show Hide Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame? This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.

It has more than a dozen projects under way and has partnered with an Icelandic project that injects CO2 deep underground into basalt formations.\n\nAnother avenue defined by the foundation as \u201cpermanent, scalable, and financeable\u201d is a company that turns CO2 into limestone that can be used in building. It recently supplied concrete for a new terminal at San Francisco\u2019s airport.\n\nThe report also mentions the intentional placing of iron in parts of the ocean to boost its ability to absorb CO2, as well as efforts to seed reflective sand across the Arctic to reduce escalating melting.\n\nSome environmentalists have rejected such approaches as radical geoengineering that will have harmful unintended consequences. Others have criticized the development of CO2 removal technology as distracting from the need to reduce emissions.\n\nHowever, the UN-hosted forum highlights the narrowing window to confront the climate crisis before scientists\u2019 warnings of severe societal impacts become reality.\n\n\u201cMitigation and adaptation are absolutely critical in climate change, the piece missing is restoration,\u201d said Parnell. \u201cIt\u2019s not about leaving things as business as usual, younger generations won\u2019t allow that. But we need a breakthrough, we need to go further.\u201d\n\nDavid Keith, a Harvard academic who has led solar geoengineering work, said it was \u201cencouraging\u201d that the ideas were being discussed but said the ambition of the forum may be a little unrealistic.\n\n\u201cI think the timescales they propose for deployment of carbon removal make little sense and seem ungrounded in the real-world politics of cutting emissions which ought to be our first priority,\u201d he said.\n\nKlaus Lackner, director of the Center for Negative Carbon Emissions at Arizona State University, said it would be difficult to restore the Arctic and that iron fertilization of the oceans \u201chas not been proven. In fact most data suggest that its contributions would be small, they also would have large ecological impacts.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think [the foundation] wants to do the right thing, but it is also important to do a careful analysis,\u201d Lackner said.\n\nThis article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.
