That\u2019s the aim of the latest Fairphone 3 \u2013 and on many counts it succeeds.\n\nEthically creating a phone is a lot harder than it may sound, but you have to start somewhere. Amsterdam-based Fairphone turned from an awareness campaign about conflict minerals into a phone company in 2013, and aims to source as many materials as possible in both human and environmentally kind ways.\n\nNow in its third iteration, the \u00a3420 Fairphone 3 is making progress, not only in responsible sourcing of materials, but in manufacturing and longevity, with a modular, repairable design. It even comes with its own screwdriver.\n\nChunky, translucent plastic\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Change is in your hands\u2019 proclaims Fairphone. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nThere\u2019s no two ways about it: the Fairphone 3 has a dated design. Big chunks of body at the top and bottom of the screen are reminiscent of smartphones from five years ago. The LCD display is fairly small by today\u2019s standards at 5.7in, but is reasonable with pretty good colours and excellent viewing angles, and is just about bright enough \u2013 most of the time you\u2019ll see the brightness cranked up to maximum. It\u2019s covered by Gorilla Glass 5, which isn\u2019t the latest, but at least should make it fairly scratch-resistant.\n\nThe rest of the body is utilitarian and boxy. At almost 1cm thick, the Fairphone 3 is certainly a chunky beast. The big chin and forehead, as well as fairly thick bezels each side of the screen, make the phone a lot larger than its small screen dimensions might suggest too. It\u2019s closer in size to a phone with a screen over 6.4in, and so requires similar hand-stretching to use it.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest All the buttons and the speaker are in the left side of the phone. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nThe translucent black plastic body feels well made and hard-wearing. Being able to see the usually hidden components through the plastic makes it all the more interesting. There\u2019s very little flex or give anywhere on the phone, which is all the more impressive give you can take the back off and remove modules.\n\nThe volume buttons and power button are all on the left side of the phone, which took some getting used to. The speaker, too, is mounted in the left side of the phone, which means you\u2019re more likely to block it with an errant finger.\n\nThrough the back of the phone you can see the phrase \u201cChange is in your hands\u201d written on the battery, which is a little bit self-congratulatory for my tastes.\n\nA USB-C socket in the bottom handles charging, while there is a (now rare) headphone socket in the top. There\u2019s also a fingerprint scanner on the back, which works fairly well but is a bit high up the back to be easily reachable without moving the phone down your hand a little each time you need to touch it.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The fingerprint scanner is almost at the top of the phone, which makes reaching it a bit of a stretch. At least you can see why: the battery takes up the rest of the space.

It has Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 632 chip from last year, which is a lower-performance mid-range processor, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, plus a microSD card slot for adding more.\n\nGeneral performance isn\u2019t terrible, but it certainly isn\u2019t fast, even compared with mid-range smartphones costing less. There are elements of lag and stutter all over the system. You quickly run into slowdown when simply trying to find your way to a meeting, as launching the calendar app to find an address, then Google Maps and Citymapper to compare directions was enough to repeatedly introduce significant lag. Press a button and nothing happens long enough to make you question whether you managed to actually activate the button.\n\nBattery life is equally middle of the road at about 26 hours between charges, meaning it lasts from 7am on day one until 9am on day two. That is while using the Fairphone 3 as my primary device with a total screen time of just over four hours, lots of email and messages, browsing in Chrome, four hours of Spotify via Bluetooth headphones, 40 minutes of offline Amazon Prime Video and a few photos.\n\nThe Fairphone 3 doesn\u2019t ship with a charger or cable. It charges in about 2 hours 10 minutes using a standard 30W USB-C charger, or faster using one that supports Qualcomm\u2019s QuickCharge 3 (\u20ac19.95 from Fairphone). But there\u2019s also the possibility of just swapping in another charged battery, given you can remove it in less than five seconds.\n\nFairphone OS\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Android 9 on the Fairphone comes duplicate app and bloat-free. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nThe Fairphone 3 ships with its own Fairphone OS, which is a standard version of Android, free of bloat or duplicated apps and all the better for it. The only minor disappointment is that it ships on Android 9, not the new Android 10, although Fairphone aims to provide security and software updates for five years from release.\n\nAnyone who has used Android in the last five years will be familiar with it, while switching to it from an iPhone is fairly straightforward. It\u2019s clear that Fairphone needs to do a better job at optimising the performance of the software, however, as the issues of lag are likely to be avoidable with a bit of work.\n\nCamera\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The camera can produce some good shots in good lighting, but struggles in low-light, while the camera app lacks a few features. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nThe Fairphone 3 has a fairly standard 12-megapixel camera on the back, which is technically the same as that fitted to Google\u2019s Pixel 3a, but doesn\u2019t come anywhere close, lacking the software magic that makes Google\u2019s camera so good.\n\nIn good lighting the Fairphone 3 shoots reasonable pictures with a solid amount of detail and colour. The same goes for selfies and portraits. Unfortunately that\u2019s not the case in middling to low light conditions. Shots taken indoors at night with a mixture of overhead and lamp lighting produced dark, grainy and indistinct images.\n\nOverall, the Fairphone 3\u2019s camera performance is similar to today\u2019s budget phones: fine on a sunny day, but poor indoors.\n\nRepair modules\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest All the various modules push fit into place and are secured by simple screws. Photograph: Fairphone\n\nOther than efforts from the company to source materials ethically, and to pay the factory workers who put together the phone a top-up to a living wage, the most exciting thing about the Fairphone 3 is its modular nature. It\u2019s not some Google Ara reinvention of the wheel, but rather the ability to take out and replace or repair parts when they go wrong.\n\nStarting from the removable back and battery, the rest of the phone can be pulled apart with standard screws. Fairphone even includes the correct screwdriver in the box. If a part breaks, buy a replacement module, screw it in place and away you go. That\u2019s the idea, anyway, and repair guide masters iFixit gave it a big thumbs up recently.\n\nThe individual parts aren\u2019t that cheap, of course, but given you can place them yourself without breaking everything else in the process it seems like a fair trade-off. A replacement camera costs \u20ac49.95, the speaker \u20ac19.95, the bottom module with the USB-C socket in it costs \u20ac19.95 and the top module with the selfie camera, headphone socket and other bits costs \u20ac29.95. Probably more widely used parts are the screen for \u20ac89.95, the battery for \u20ac29.95 or the back cover for \u20ac24.95.\n\nObservations\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Swapping the battery out is a 10-second affair, rather than a trip to a repair shop. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian\n\nFairphone includes a bumper case in the box that wraps the sides of the phone while leaving the back open\n\nThe vibration motor is strong but imprecise, feeling like one from four years ago\n\nBluetooth performance is poor, causing hiccups with headphones that are rock-solid with other devices\n\nThe Fairphone 3 is not water-resistant\n\nPrice\n\nThe Fairphone 3 costs \u20ac450 direct, or \u00a3420 from the Phone Co-op, and is available for pre-order now delivering in mid-September. The Fairphone 3 is also available on Sky Mobile on contracts starting at \u00a321 per month.\n\nFor comparison, Google\u2019s Pixel 3a costs \u00a3399, the OnePlus 7 costs \u00a3499 and the Motorola Moto G7 costs \u00a3220.\n\nVerdict\n\nThe Fairphone 3 is a device full of compromises with one massive advantage: being ethical.\n\nThe design is a bit more interesting thanks to its translucent finish, but it\u2019s chunky and dated-looking. The 5.7in screen is pretty good, but the big chin and bezels make the phone considerably larger and harder to use than it could be. It has USB-C and a headphone socket, both of which are welcome, but the odd speaker placement makes it easy to block.\n\nThe inside is the same. The clean, bloat-free Android software is good, but it\u2019s only Android 9 not the new Android 10, and it has performance issues. Dual-sim and microSD card support is great too, but Bluetooth performance was pretty poor.\n\nIf you were to look at the Fairphone 3 simply as a \u00a3420 smartphone, you\u2019d say it costs about \u00a3200 too much and isn\u2019t even a great \u00a3220 phone at that. You can buy a phone with more modern design, similar specifications, performance and software for around \u00a3220 such as the Motorola Moto G7, or phones that are infinitely better at \u00a3420.\n\nBut the Fairphone 3 isn\u2019t just another smartphone: it\u2019s an entirely different way of thinking about how a phone and its creation fits into the world.\n\nYou can genuinely repair this phone yourself with modular components you simply unscrew and replace. If the battery is worn out, swap it out for a new one in less than 10 seconds. The Fairphone 3 is arguably the most sustainable phone you can buy, and that\u2019s without even looking at the firm\u2019s efforts to source all materials and manufacture the phone in as ethical manner as possible.\n\nBut I worry that a phone that has performance issues now won\u2019t be serviceable in five years, and so all the reparability in the world won\u2019t make it a device people still want to use in 2024. If buyers use the Fairphone 3 for two years, then dump it for a new one, that defeats the object of the exercise.\n\nUntil now it\u2019s not been possible to put a real price on the ethical side of a smartphone in the same way you can with a Fairtrade chocolate bar. Thanks to the Fairphone 3, we now know it\u2019s about \u00a3200. So the question is whether people are prepared to pay \u00a3200 extra to support a worthy movement. I hope they are.\n\nPros: ethical manufacturing, sustainable materials, truly repairable, solidly built, dual-sim, microSD card slot, headphones socket, removable battery, bloat-free, software support for five years Cons: only Android 9, middling performance, chunky, expensive for the specs, average camera, poor Bluetooth\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Fairphone branding is strong, showing the in-the-know world that you\u2019re an ethical smartphone buyer.
