The word \u201cimpossible\u201d does not seem to belong in his vocabulary, perhaps because he is the son of a billionaire, and because he wears a Gucci suit to school. (He is still waitlisted by Harvard, who do not seem as convinced of his destiny as he is.) Payton is played by the Tony, Emmy and Grammy-award-winning Broadway actor Ben Platt, who earned renown for his performance as an anxious and neurotic teenager in the musical Dear Evan Hansen, and is now embodying an entirely different kind of teen: one who will stop at nothing, up to and including blackmail, to achieve his destiny as the most powerful, entitled white man on the planet.\n\nAt once babyish and solemn, Platt is 25-years-old but easily passes for a fussy and fastidious kid, his puppy fat and cartoon eyes making what ought to be unwatchably repellent\u2014a character fueled by ruthlessness, self-certainty, and an attitude towards his immediate peers that verges on the sociopathic\u2014bearable for a full season of high-voltage and high-volume television. He has the kind of slack, cherubic mouth that makes him appear credulous even when scheming, looking like the innocent boutonni\u00e8re and being the serpent under it. \u201cI am not a good person,\u201d Payton insists over and over again, and even as we see evidence that he is right, we do not entirely believe him. \u201cThe level of ambition I certainly could relate to,\u201d Platt recently told The New York Times. \u201cWe took ourselves very seriously in the arts and really wanted to make something of ourselves, and a lot of us are [somebodies] now.\u201d\n\nThe Politician may be the Ryan-Murphiest Ryan Murphy show to date. It is deranged, its pilot dense with improbable, hand-over-mouth twists.\n\nTo draw parallels between the politician and the theater kid, when we are more used to equating presidents with businessmen and reality TV stars, is an unusual move, and not a strictly inaccurate one: At their worst, stage school types are ersatz-seeming, all bared teeth and cloaked determination. Just in case we happened to forget that the United States\u2019 sixteenth president died at the theater, The Politician reminds us by including a high-school production of Sondheim\u2019s Assassins.\n\n\n\nThe Politician may be the Ryan-Murphiest Ryan Murphy show to date. It is deranged, its pilot as dense with improbable, hand-over-mouth twists as a particularly breakneck episode of Gossip Girl. I hesitate to reveal many of the intricacies of its eight-episode run, in part because of an especially detailed list of things I am advised not to discuss by Netflix, and in part because I believe that if you happen to be the target audience for the Ryan-Murphiest Ryan Murphy show to date, it may be best to go in cold. I will say that it has attempted murder, political intrigue, a plotline involving feral possum blood that is inspired by the myth of Philoctetes, a one-episode appearance from two boldface actresses beloved by the gay community, and several heartfelt, full-length songs. There is an argument over whether a queer black woman or a cancer patient might make a more sympathetic running mate, and at some point one character says to another, as if this were a completely normal observation: \u201cYou\u2019ve put on a few pounds since your boyfriend blew his brains out.\u201d It has a scene in which a breezy Gwyneth Paltrow, playing a billionaire\u2019s wife swaddled in cashmere, watches Dr. Pimple Popper for the first time. It has one in which she says, with brilliant, pitch-perfect sincerity: \u201cYes, that would have been two poisonings in one week, but he\u2019s a very polarizing figure.\u201d", "description": "Ryan Murphy\u2019s show about a super-elite high-school election could have made brilliant, cultish television.", "authors": ["Philippa Snow"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/7a831705acc0fd8e5f1453b474f064e383b7956b.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
