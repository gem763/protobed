They had all left by around 3:13 p.m., the JCS said.While the JCS added the Russian planes did not invade Korea\u2019s territorial airspace, Korean officials on Wednesday were expected to express strong regret at the Kadiz violation to their Russian counterparts.An air defense identification zone (ADIZ) corresponds to the airspace that extends beyond a country\u2019s national territory where a country can interrogate unidentified aircraft and possibly intercept them in the event it detects a threat to its sovereign airspace.While many countries operate such zones to enhance their airborne security, there are no international agreements that govern ADIZs, and often countries\u2019 ADIZs overlap - like those of China, Korea and Japan.Russia does not operate a formal ADIZ, and therefore does not recognize other countries\u2019 claims over their own.In July, three Russian military planes and two Chinese jets entered Kadiz, with one of the Russian jets even violating Korea\u2019s sovereign airspace over the Dokdo islets. The jets were running a joint exercise that military analysts said would only increase as China and Russia flex their muscles abroad with more frequency as a challenge to U.S. influence over the region.During Tuesday\u2019s flyby, the Russian planes avoided Korean airspace between Ulleung Island and Dokdo, but Korea responded by deploying 10 F-15K and KF-16 fighter jets, which relayed several warning signals to the Russian planes until they left Kadiz. Korea\u2019s Defense Ministry subsequently called Moscow to issue a complaint over the incident and urged that it does not recur.According to a Korean military official, the Russian planes\u2019 blatant flight over the East Sea, and the waters off Korea\u2019s western and southern coast, showed Moscow was flaunting over Korea\u2019s Kadiz.The two countries\u2019 Defense Ministries agreed in August to install a direct hotline between their air forces to deter such potential collisions in Kadiz, according to another military official who expressed uncertainty about how Tuesday\u2019s events could affect the talks.Korea\u2019s presidential office on Wednesday showed restraint over the issue, with a key official telling reporters that the Defense Ministry\u2019s briefing and the Foreign Ministry\u2019s summoning of the Russian Embassy\u2019s military attache over the incident showed the government had put out a timely response. \u201cWe will not further make a fuss over the matter,\u201d the official added.BY SHIM KYU-SEOK [shim.kyuseok@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
