Maybe he is even talking to Biden\u2019s staff,\u201d the former Trump administration official stated. \u201cMaybe it is innocent, maybe not.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Whistleblower\u2019s facts have been so incorrect about my \u2018no pressure\u2019 conversation with the Ukrainian President, and now the conflict of interest and involvement with a Democrat Candidate, that he or she should be exposed and questioned properly,\u201d President Donald Trump wrote Wednesday on Twitter.\n\nThe Whistleblower\u2019s facts have been so incorrect about my \u201cno pressure\u201d conversation with the Ukrainian President, and now the conflict of interest and involvement with a Democrat Candidate, that he or she should be exposed and questioned properly. This is no Whistleblower\u2026.. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 9, 2019\n\nIn a statement to members of Congress, Michael Atkinson, the Intelligence Community\u2019s inspector general, said the whistleblower had a \u201cprofessional\u201d tie to a 2020 Democrat presidential hopeful. Atkinson also said the whistleblower\u2019s complaint shows \u201csome indicia of an arguable political bias \u2026 in favor of a rival political candidate.\u201d", "description": "Joe Biden had a \"professional\" tie to the CIA Whistleblower, according to a report from the Washington Examiner.", "authors": ["Kyle Morris"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/VP-Joe-Biden-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
