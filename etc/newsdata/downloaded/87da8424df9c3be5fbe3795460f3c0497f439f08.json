Having passed 50 for a record eighth Ashes innings in a row, the headache that is this gifted right-hander has returned for Joe Root\u2019s side.\n\nSteve Smith and the rain frustrate England on first day at Old Trafford Read more\n\nStuart Broad did continue his stranglehold over David Warner and knocked over Marcus Harris cheaply in the morning and there was a wicket for the returning Craig Overton when he bowled Marnus Labuschagne for 67 and broke a stand of 116 with Smith.\n\nBut overall it was a tough day for the bowlers after Tim Paine won the toss, with 40mph crosswinds sending crisp packets and inflatables flying across the outfield, forcing a period of play without bails on the stumps and forcing run-ups to be aborted regularly. Jofra Archer experienced his first subdued outing as an England player.\n\nOverton said: \u201cSmith is obviously a world-class player and he\u2019s back as the Test No 1. He\u2019s always going to be difficult but we\u2019ve got our plans and we\u2019ll try to keep going to them. Hopefully we get him out tomorrow. Conditions really didn\u2019t suit running into bowl. It\u2019s just the rhythm of the run-up \u2013 you feel like you\u2019re getting to the crease and all of a sudden the wind hits you and it pushes you forward.\n\n\u201cWe all tended to struggle with the wind today. I wouldn\u2019t look too much into [Archer being down on pace]. He\u2019ll be raring to go again, firing in and bowling as quick as he can. Hopefully taking a few wickets as well.\u201d\n\nOverton\u2019s first Test wicket on home soil mirrored the one that opened his account on debut in Adelaide in late 2017, the only difference being it was Labuschagne \u2013 fresh from his fourth successive half-century \u2013 rather than the more prized Smith.\n\nThe 6ft 5in right-armer followed a string of outswingers with one that ducked in and clattered the top of off stump. The groundstaff at Old Trafford had earlier hammered nails into the bails for additional weight to prevent them being blown off by the gusts but they fell to the ground regardless.\n\nExplaining the words he offered Labuschagne after the breakthrough, Overton said: \u201cThe over before he cut me for four thinking it was the inswinger but I told him it wasn\u2019t. Then I bowled him the inswinger and it worked out quite well. It wasn\u2019t a send-off, it was just saying: \u2018That one was the inswinger; make sure you keep an eye on it.\u2019\u201d\n\nSteve Smith\u2019s craft dampens English hopes of fiery Jofra Archer rematch | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nThis was a strong comeback from Australia after the galling nature of their one-wicket defeat in Leeds. Labuschagne, speaking after play, explained how the tourists have not bought into the idea of England coming into this Test with any additional edge.\n\nThe newly promoted No 3 said: \u201cWe\u2019ve talked about that not being an issue for us at all. We\u2019re just focused on the process of winning a Test match and not necessarily the overall series.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t been getting too far ahead when we\u2019ve been doing well and we haven\u2019t been getting too far down when we\u2019ve been doing poorly. I think that\u2019s probably the key to not letting momentum take its course.\u201d\n\nOn batting in a Test with Smith, the man he replaced at Lord\u2019s as a concussion substitute, Labuschagne said: \u201cIt was good fun to sort of spend some time with him. I\u2019d never batted with him before and it was an experience to learn from him.\n\n\u201cWe were constantly talking out there. You can see when different bowlers come on he changes, with different guards or movements. That\u2019s what makes him the best in the world. He\u2019s always kind of one step ahead, not being reactive but proactive.\u201d", "description": "Australia\u2019s Steve Smith was seeing it like a beachball as a day of excellence from him and strong winds disturbing England\u2019s bowlers scotched the notion of momentum in this Ashes", "authors": ["Ali Martin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28bf3255a16256f02c2236072f603caa02421e6b/0_190_4300_2580/master/4300.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=248326adf137dcb371b63e92f6ea9014"}
