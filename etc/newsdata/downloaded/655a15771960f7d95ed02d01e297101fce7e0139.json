The image went viral", "language": "en", "text": "A fourth-grade boy who wasn't quite sure what to wear for school photos took his dad up on a bet \u2013 and the resulting photo has caught the attention of thousands on social media.\n\nJake Arsenault's mom, Kari, suggested the 9-year-old wear an old Halloween costume: A hot dog.\n\nJake wasn't sold on his mom's idea at first. That's according to Jake's father, Craig Arsenault, who spoke to USA TODAY on Saturday.\n\n\u201cDude, do it ... it\u2019ll be legendary,\u201d Arsenault says he encouraged. He remembers promising his son $10 if he went through with wearing the costume to the Biddeford Intermediate School photo day about three weeks ago in Maine.\n\nParenting: Little girl hilariously \u2018shocked\u2019 when her dad explains how sausages are made\n\nJake's parents didn't want to stand in the way if their son actually wanted to wear the costume. They even signed a parental letter to the school, asking that Jake be allowed to wear it. The note, written by Kari, said, \"We are aware and OK with Jacob Arsenault's intention to wear his hot dog costume for school pictures, if possible.\"\n\nJake Arsenault's Biddeford Intermediate School ID shows him posing in a hot dog costume \u2014 the result of a bet with his dad. (Photo: Photo courtesy Craig Arsenault)\n\n\"Please let this happen!\" Craig Arsenault wrote.\n\nThis week, Jake's school ID card came \u2013 complete with the hot dog suit photo.\n\nArsenault took a photo of the card Thursday and posted it to his professional Facebook page, which he uses for his work at a U.S. Army recruiter.\n\n\"The school let him do it, and I couldn't be happier,\" the caption says. Arsenault says he often mixes professional and some personal posts on this public page.\n\nSince Thursday, the post has attracted tens of thousands of shares. But as of Saturday, Arsenault still hadn't fully made good on his side of the bet: He's only given Jake $7 in spare cash \u2013 he still owes his son $3.\n\nScreen time: How to handle your children's smartphone, tablet and video game addictions\n\nCraig said Jake also posed for a photo in regular clothing, and that photo was used on another copy of Jake's school ID.\n\nWhile Arsenault said he has gotten some pushback from people concerned for Jake's safety who were worried about his decision to put his son's ID card on the internet, he told USA TODAY in a written statement and phone interview that such critics are living in fear and he is confident his son is safe.\n\nAs for Jake, Arsenault says his son loves the attention and is wowed by the national interest, but he does have one regret looking back. The day the photos were taken was only a half day of school \u2013 now he wishes he was able to wear the hot dog costume for a full day.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/19/boy-wears-hot-dog-suit-school-id-photo-dare-dad/4037116002/", "description": "Nine-year-old Jake Arsenault's mom\u00a0suggested he wear an old hot dog halloween costume for his school photo.
