Some of my players have already played 17 games with internationals \u2013 that is half a season in Germany,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat is no problem, we are not tired, not at all, but we have to change two positions already and let\u2019s see what we can do on top of that.\n\n\u201cIt is never just for changing. It is always being best prepared for our next opponent.\u201d\n\nAsked specifically about when they will see the best of Keita the German added: \u201cSoon. Naby is one-and-a-half or two weeks in full training. He looks good and that is why he played (against United).\n\n\u201cIn training, I see it a lot, so that was the best news. It will not be long.\u201d\n\nKlopp\u2019s first priority, however, it to arrest their woeful away record in the Champions League group stage.\n\nThey have lost the last four, scoring only once, and have not won any of the last five with their latest victory on the road in Europe in the group stage at Maribor two years ago.\n\nThat success in Slovenia remains their only win in the last 10 away group matches.\n\nLiverpool scraped through last season with a 1-0 win over Napoli in their final home game, three Anfield victories giving them nine points and second place in their group.\n\n\u201cLast year we were lucky with how tight the group was that we could lose three times away and still have a chance to make it through the group. That will not happen this year. It\u2019s completely different.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t rely on home games or whatever. Obviously we like to say European nights at Anfield are really special but other teams can make a special atmosphere as well.\n\n\u201cThey are not all the same. We could have won away games to be honest performance-wise which we didn\u2019t win for some reason.\n\n\u201cWe know it\u2019s not historically good what we have done (in the away group games) in the last few years, but in general, the Champions League was obviously really good.\n\n\u201cWe did the right things in the right moment but we don\u2019t rely on these things. We know we have to improve and we try again and again and again until it works out.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Liverpool\u00a0manager Jurgen Klopp is not keen on change for change\u2019s sake but he has hinted that he could be ready to let midfielder Naby Keita loose for a run in the team.
