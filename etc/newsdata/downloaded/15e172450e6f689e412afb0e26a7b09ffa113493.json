There\u2019s a good reason why cartridge shavers remain the most common method of shaving: They\u2019re easy to use, always being replaced by new styles that promise an even better shave, and typically what most people are familiar with. But according to most of the professional barbers we spoke to, the best way to shave at home \u2014 and avoid the irritation commonly caused by cartridge razors \u2014 is actually with a safety razor, a tool that\u2019s remained virtually unchanged since it debuted in 1903.\n\n\u201cIf anyone uses a cartridge razor and has irritation, I steer them towards safety razors,\u201d says Brian Porteous, owner of Heritage Barbershop in Portland, Oregon. He explains that safety razors are generally much safer on skin because they feature a \u201csingle blade,\u201d as opposed to the typical three-blade style you find in a cartridge razor. \u201cIt\u2019s really the first blade that\u2019s doing all the cutting\u201d with a cartridge razor, Porteous explains, \u201cand once that first blade gets a little dull, it\u2019ll start to pull the hair up,\u201d which leads to the second and third blades actually cutting under the skin. \u201cThat\u2019s what causes irritation and ingrown hair,\u201d he adds.\n\nBeyond causing less irritation, safety-razor shaving is also way more economical. Safety razors cost a bit more than cartridge razors upfront, but as Peter Solomon, the owner of Boston\u2019s Tweed Barbers explains, the blades for safety razors \u201cgenerally cost $.10 to $.20 each \u2014 while cartridges tend to go for at least $2 to $3 each \u2014 so the lifetime savings is significant.\u201d Plus, the double-edged blades used with safety razors will generally work with any model (as opposed to branded cartridges that only fit a specific brand of razor). To find the best safety razors and blades \u2014 and tips for how to use them \u2014 we spoke with Porteous, Solomon, and five other barbers, who all assured us that once you get your technique down (which really shouldn\u2019t take long) it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll want to use anything but a safety razor. Read on for all their recommendations, as well as for their tricks of the trade.\n\nBest overall safety razor\n\nMerkur 34C Heavy-Duty Short Handle Safety Razor German razor company Merkur came up more than any other brand, praised by six of our seven experts for its long history, good price point, and reputation for quality German manufacturing. Merkur makes a wide range of safety razors, but they\u2019re perhaps best known for this three-inch, roughly three-ounce model, which two of the experts specifically named as a great safety razor for beginners. Its handle is the shortest of any razor on this list, but Porteous says that\u2019s part of what makes it such a good option for someone new to safety-razor shaving. The shorter handle is \u201cwide and well-balanced,\u201d he notes, so it\u2019s \u201ceasier to grip\u201d and more maneuverable. \u201cWith a longer handle, some people might feel they have a little less control over the shave,\u201d adds Solomon. Incidentally, six years ago (roughly five years before I started writing for the Strategist), I started using a Merkur 34C as my go-to razor, and still use it \u2014 and recommend it to others \u2014 to this day. In addition to the way a razor feels in your hand, Solomon says one of the most important qualities to consider is the \u201caggressiveness\u201d of the shave, \u201cwhich is largely determined by how much space exists between the blade and the safety bar of the razor.\u201d The Merkur 34C is a closed-comb razor, a style that Solomon and all the other experts say is generally best for beginners because it \u201coffers a more protected shave,\u201d at least as far as safety razors are concerned. With open-comb razors, the blade is more exposed, which some say provides a closer shave, but will increase the risk of nicks and irritation. $40 at Amazon Buy $40 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest long-handle safety razor\n\nMerkur 38C Heavy-Duty Long Handle Safety Razor While Porteous says the 34C is a great all-around razor and his go-to recommendation for beginners, he personally prefers the 38C, also from Merkur, which has all the same features but a longer, almost 3.79-inch handle. (It also weighs more, at roughly four ounces.) It all comes down to personal comfort and what feels best in your hand, he says, adding that people with larger hands might find the 38C easier to grip. Master barber Angelo Ruscetta of American Haircuts in Kennesaw, Georgia, agrees: \u201cA lot of tall guys like longer handles,\u201d he says. But like Porteous, Ruscetta also says choosing the right safety razor ultimately comes down to feel. (He also favors the 38C\u2019s slightly longer handle and heavier weight.) $60 at Amazon Buy $60 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest (less expensive) long-handle safety razor\n\nMerkur 23C Classic Long Handle Safety Razor The 23C is another classic Merkur model with plenty of fans. Recommended by Paul Langevin, co-owner of the Lower East Side barbershop Mildred New York, it\u2019s the longest and lightest razor of the bunch (at 3.87 inches and just over two ounces, respectively). That makes it a good choice for someone who wants to smoothly transition from the feel of a lighter cartridge razor to the world of safety razors. $29 at Amazon Buy $29 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest butterfly safety razor\n\nParker 66R Butterfly Safety Razor Four of our experts recommended \u201cbutterfly\u201d safety razors as a great option, mentioning the unique one-piece head that makes swapping in new blades quick and easy. Most safety razors have a straightforward screw-off top for replacing the blade, but a butterfly razor head pops open and closes with a simple twist. Parker is one of the best known safety-razor manufacturers, and this four-ounce butterfly razor with a 3.8-inch handle, which came specifically recommended by two experts, is one of its signature models. \u201cIt\u2019s the cadillac of safety razors,\u201d says Ruscetta, who told us that it\u2019s what he uses at home. It\u2019s the heaviest razor on this list, but Ruscetta favors heavier razors because he likes to let the weight of the razor do some of the work. \u201cThat way, you don\u2019t have to force it\u201d and you can get a close shave without applying much pressure. Solomon also likes Parker\u2019s butterfly razors, but he recommends the 96R, which is quite similar. (It comes in a black finish, the handle is slightly longer, and it\u2019s a tiny bit lighter.) $30 at Amazon Buy $30 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest lightweight butterfly safety razor\n\nVikings Blade \"The Chieftain\" Butterfly Safety Razor Heather Manto, the owner of Austin\u2019s Independence Barber Co., is another fan of butterfly safety razors, which she says \u201cgive you that old-time, nostalgic shave experience.\u201d She recommends this model from Vikings Blade, another very popular safety-razor company, although perhaps not quite as well known as the old standbys, Merkur and Parker. It has a long, 3.75-inch handle about the same length as the Parker and Merkur 38C models shown above, but is 25 percent lighter than either of those two. $29 at Amazon Buy $29 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest open-comb safety razor\n\nMuhle R41 Open Comb Safety Razor All of the safety razors we\u2019ve listed thus far are closed comb, but if you\u2019re looking for an open-comb style, the Muhle R41 is widely regarded as one of the best available. Open-comb razors are generally used by more experienced shavers, because the exposed blade makes it easy to cut yourself if you don\u2019t have your technique down. Still, they have plenty of fans, and some shavers insist that if you want to get the closest shave possible, an open comb is the only way to go. Solomon also says that the open-comb design handles longer stubble better than a closed comb, so it might be a good option for people with thicker beards, or for those \u201cwho shave less frequently.\u201d As he explains, \u201can open comb has \u2018teeth\u2019 along the head of the razor where the blades protrudes, allowing longer stubble to pass through the teeth and reach the blade.\u201d Solomon cautions, however, that this razor is \u201cknown to be a very aggressive shave, so it\u2019s best for experts who know what they\u2019re doing.\u201d Its 3.7-inch handle is consistent with the other long-handle razors on the list, and it\u2019s on the lighter end, weighing in at just over two ounces. $56 at Amazon Buy $56 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest adjustable safety razor\n\nMerkur Progress 510 Adjustable Safety Razor As our experts have mentioned, the \u201caggressiveness\u201d of the shave is something common among all safety razors, most of which are rigid in their design, meaning you\u2019re generally stuck with whatever cutting angle is built into the razor and how it closes around a blade. While the rigid design of most safety razors simplifies how you use them, it also makes it impossible to experiment and find what type of shave works best without buying multiple razors. This is where adjustable safety razors come in handy, says Solomon. \u201cAdjustable razors let you control (by twisting the base) how much of the blade protrudes beyond the head, so in essence you can control how aggressive the shave is.\u201d He notes that there aren\u2019t a ton of options out there when it comes to adjustable razors, but the Merkur Progress is thought to be one of the best. The dial at the bottom has five settings to choose from, and the razor itself has some heft, weighing roughly three and a half ounces with a 3.7-inch handle. $58 at Amazon Buy $58 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest safety razor for sensitive skin\n\nBevel Safety Razor Bevel is one of a few companies taking the direct-to-consumer approach with safety razors. It has a whole line of products, including blades, pre-shave oils, shaving creams, and more. According to master barber Julien Howard at New York City\u2019s Blind Barber (who also does pop-ups around the country under the moniker The Velo Barber), Bevel makes one of the best safety razors out there for anyone prone to ingrown hair or with skin that\u2019s especially irritable. \u201cIt\u2019s tailored to work with African-American facial hair,\u201d he says, noting that it\u2019s designed to minimize ingrowns and irritation. It has one of the longer handles of the bunch, at four inches, and weighs just over three ounces. $37 at Amazon Buy $37 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest high-end safety razor\n\nFeather AS-D2 All Stainless Steel Safety Razor For something on the higher end of the price spectrum, Manto suggests this set from Feather, which has a stellar reputation in the barber community, and is famous for its made-in-Japan blades that every expert we spoke with says are the sharpest you can buy (more on those below). In terms of design, this razor, with a textured grip and closed comb, is similar to the Merkur 34C and 38C. And with a handle of 3.5 inches long and weight of just over three ounces, it lands somewhere in the middle of the two. But why spend $160 on this when you can buy other, quality safety razors available for less than a third of the cost? One reason, according to Manto, is that this is made entirely of stainless steel, whereas all the other razors on this list are steel-coated, or made from some sort of alloy. Porteous \u2014 who told us he collects and restores vintage safety razors when he\u2019s not working at his barbershop \u2014 explains that the Feather razor\u2019s high-quality material recalls the stuff used to make some of the old Gilettes from the \u201930s and \u201940s, which he says are \u201cas solid as can be.\u201d Short of purchasing a vintage safety razor, the Feather is the closest tool you can use to replicate the feel of shaving with one. $162 at Amazon Buy $162 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest double-edged razor blades for safety razors\n\nDouble Edge Razor Blade Sample Pack (7 Varieties, 3 of each) All the experts told us that choosing a blade is very personal, and to a large degree it comes down to comfort and preference. That\u2019s why Porteous says he \u201calways directs people to buy a sample pack and try some out to figure out what\u2019s best for your face.\u201d Ruscetta agrees, adding that a sample pack of various brands lets you \u201cfeel the differences in thickness between the blades.\u201d It\u2019s worth the trial and error, he says, because \u201cthe right blade can be a gamechanger.\u201d Still, there are still certain brands that consistently came up in our conversations with the pros, so we\u2019re mentioning some of those below, too. (And this particular sample pack includes every blade that one or more experts recommended, plus a couple of other options for good measure). $7 at Amazon Buy $7 at Amazon Buy\n\nFeather Hi-Stainless Double Edge Razor Blades (100 Count) Feather blades are known in the industry as the sharpest blades available, so it\u2019s no surprise that they were the most recommended of all, with five experts singing their praises. \u201cFeather is the sharpest on the market, period,\u201d says Howard. And although the pros love a sharp blade after spending years perfecting their technique, it\u2019s important to note that what works best for them might not work best for a nonprofessional shaving at home. As many experts also note, the sharpness of these blades can be irritating to sensitive skin, and of course sharper blades carry an increased risk of nicks and cuts. Still, if you want a close shave, the experts say you can\u2019t do better than Feather. $22 at Amazon Buy $22 at Amazon Buy\n\nDerby Extra Double Edge Razor Blades (50 Count) Derby blades were the runner-up, recommended by four of our experts, all of whom say the brand is something of a barbershop staple. As Patrick McLaughlin, Senior Barber at Fellow Barber Dumbo told us, \u201cThey\u2019re very consistent. I never have any snags. Other brands of blades I\u2019ve used sometimes have bends or folds, but [Derby\u2019s] are always sharp and really consistent.\u201d Arthur Iskhakov, owner of Barber\u2019s Blueprint in New York City, seconds that, saying, \u201cThey\u2019re very popular with barbers. Very sharp and reliable.\u201d $6 at Amazon Buy $6 at Amazon Buy\n\nAstra Platinum Double Edge Razor Blades (100 Count) $8 (was $10, now 20% off) The bronze medal goes to Astra blades, which were mentioned by three experts, all of whom described them as thicker than other blades they\u2019ve used. According to Iskhakov, Astra blades are \u201creally sharp and durable and they\u2019re really strong because they\u2019re double-coated in steel.\u201d Roscetti says the thicker Astra blades are particularly useful for shaving down dense beards, or facial hair that\u2019s been growing out for a while. $8 at Amazon Buy $8 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
