The incident occurred in central Thailand's Khao Yai National Park, where reportedly, a baby elephant slipped over the waterfall.\n\nJust a couple of days after that, five more elephants were found dead, at the exact same location.\n\nNakhon Nayok governor, Natthapong Sirichana, informed of the discovery of five dead elephants by a drone, which was supposed to track location of the two elephants previously saved. It is believed that the five belonged to the same herd as the six who died before.\n\nDisaster Response Associations Thailand\n\nThe discovery brings the toll to 11, which is one of the \u2018biggest losses to Thailand's wild elephant population in recent memory\u2019, according to Bankok Post.\n\nThe waterfall is known as Haew Narok (Hell's Fall) and this incident is not the first of its kind to have occurred there. Authorities were called to the scene when a group of eight elephants were found blocking a road that led to the waterfall.\n\nDon't Miss 18.5 K SHARES 81.7 K SHARES 25.2 K SHARES 14 K SHARES 18.3 K SHARES\n\nThe important question is, when the deaths happening at the waterfall are not unknown, why have the authorities not already taken steps to curb the area in some way. It is obviously a dead end, death of 11 elephants in two days is not something to be taken lightly. The death of the first six should itself have been a wake up call for the authorities to restrict the area, the loss of the five elephants later is a human error.", "description": "Just a few days ago a very tragic and heartbreaking incident came to light when it was found that six elephants fell to their deaths while trying to protect each other from a waterfall.
