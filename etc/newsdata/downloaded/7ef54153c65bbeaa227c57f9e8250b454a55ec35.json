It is crazy to put a club in this position,' he told The Athletic.\n\n'I'm sorry but you can't put the blame on Rashford, you can't put the blame on Martial, you can't put the blame on the newcomers.\n\n'Who is big enough in that squad to be saying, \"This is falling down?\" Apart from Pogba. It is unfair on him, unfair on the squad.\n\nSaha has also insisted that it is 'crazy' to put so much pressure on midfielder Paul Pogba\n\n'I'm sorry but I think three-quarters of the players are not committed to the club as much as Gary Neville was.\n\n'It is an era. It is not just about the squad of United. Players now have a sense of the individual.\n\n'They look for themselves a bit more. It is down to social media. My account, my this, my that. Players have more followers than clubs, so it means how much power they have. It changed.'\n\nSaha won two Premier League titles during his four-year spell at the Red Devils but United's last title-winning campaign was back in 2012-13.\n\nSolskjaer's side are currently languishing in 12th place, 15 points behind league leaders Liverpool.\n\nAnd up next for United is Jurgen Klopp's Reds on Sunday afternoon at Old Trafford.", "description": "Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has come under pressure but his former team-mate Saha has put United's struggles down to how much power players have nowadays.", "authors": ["Kate Mcgreavy For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/10/19732340-0-image-a-61_1571131032535.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
