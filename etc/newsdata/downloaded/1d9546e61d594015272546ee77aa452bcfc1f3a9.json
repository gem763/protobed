Getty Images\n\nSpeaking to Italian station Radio Marte, Thies Bliemeister, the Tottenham star\u2019s agent, revealed the player\u2019s love for Italy could see him make the move to Serie A.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never brought a player to Napoli, but I\u2019d like to because [Diego] Maradona, my favourite player, played for them,\u2019 Bliemeister told Radio Marte, as reported by Goal.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve talked to Napoli in the past, with executives who are no longer at the club. I\u2019ll take advantage of this double-header with Salzburg to talk to them.\n\n\u2018As for Son at Napoli, why not? You can never say never in football. Son likes Italy, the food and Italian people. It\u2019s not easy to take him from Tottenham because he costs a lot but, one day, who knows?\u2019\n\nElsewhere, Manchester United\u2019s search for a striker goes on, with summer target Mario Mandzukic still linked to an Old Trafford move.\n\nHe\u2019s joined in the Manchester rumour mill by Bournemouth striker Callum Wilson, as reported by Sky Sports.\n\nHe has been in fine form this season on five goals in seven league games.\n\nIn the last 18 months, the England international reportedly attracted interest from Chelsea and Everton more recently.\n\nHis pace and dynamism would make him an ideal like-for-like backup for Marcus Rashford.\n\nOver in Istanbul, loanee Besiktas keeper Loris Karius has claimed he can play for Liverpool again despite his checkered past at Anfield.\n\nHe said: \u2018Will I play for Liverpool again? Of course it\u2019s an option and a good option to still be there,\u2019 he said. \u2018Maybe I\u2019ll play for them again, you never know. It\u2019s still far ahead. If it\u2019s not Liverpool, it will be another decent team, so I\u2019m not worried about any scenario.\n\n\u201cThe Premier League is the best league so it is interesting of course. If you play in England you\u2019re always a bit more in the spotlight, but I\u2019m at a good club now so we will see what happens at the end of the season.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think about Kiev anymore, it\u2019s so long ago, nearly two seasons now.. There were so many circumstances. I had a bad injury and nobody was talking about it. People can say what they want, it doesn\u2019t really concern me anymore.\u201d\n\nBack in North London, or shall we say southern France, Laurent Koscielny has revealed wy he left Arsenal, citing playing time and family reasons as his main motives.\n\nHe told L\u2019Equipe: \u201cA Premier League season is very long. It requires a lot physically and mentally. I didn\u2019t feel I could play 40-50 matches and I didn\u2019t want to end my career with injuries. I\u2019ve gone down a level, but to take more pleasure.\n\n\u201cEither I finished there or changed clubs. With my family, we felt it was time. Everything was in my thinking: football, my physical state, my wife, my children, the daily life we could have.\n\n\u201cI can only say that I left with my head held high. All of those I worked with for nine years... everyone respected my decision to return home with my family.\u201d\n\nAnd finally, Pep Guardiola has claimed Man City will not spend in January despite an injury crisis in his back four.\n\nWith Aymeric Laporte out for a long spell and John Stones also injured, Nicolas Otamendi has stepped in and has been partnered by midfielder Fernandinho at centre-back.\n\nPep clearly trusts his players, but with the resources at the club\u2019s disposal and a title race to win, it would be strange to see no movement in the January window.", "description": "Son Heung-min\u2019s Spurs future is up in the air with his agent claiming this week \u2018you can never say never\u2019 to Serie A move.
