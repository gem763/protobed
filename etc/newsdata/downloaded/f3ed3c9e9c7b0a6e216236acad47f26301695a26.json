And all of these things, they require effort and they cost more money, but my bosses never presumed to know better than I did about what I needed in order to do my job and honor Gwen Verdon.\"\n\nThe story behind Patricia Arquette\u2019s moving Emmy speech calling for transgender rights\n\nShe went on to thank FX and Fox 21 Studios \u201cfor supporting me completely and for paying me equally.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey understood that when you put value into a person, it empowers that person to get in touch with their own inherent value. And then, where do they put that value? They put it in their work.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, Williams found herself the face of Hollywood\u2019s gender pay inequality problem.\n\nAs Williams was prepped for the release of her latest film at the time, Ridley Scott\u2019s \u201cAll the Money in the World,\u201d several men stepped forward to accuse her co-star, Kevin Spacey, of sexual misconduct. Spacey was ultimately replaced by actor Christopher Plummer, which meant co-stars like Williams had to return to reshoot scenes before the film could wrap.\n\nBut then came the bombshell: USA Today reported that Williams was paid a per diem of $80 \u2014 roughly the union minimum rate \u2014 for the 10 days of work. Mark Wahlberg, meanwhile, received an additional $1.5 million, of which Williams was never told.\n\nMichelle Williams is getting a fraction of Mark Wahlberg\u2019s $2 million payday in \u2018All the Money in the World\u2019 reshoots\n\nSpeaking to Vanity Fair the following year, Williams recalled that the revelation she was receiving 1 percent of her male co-star\u2019s salary left her feeling \u201ctotally devalued.\u201d She added that she hoped \u201ca private humiliation\u201d might become \u201ca public turning point.\u201d\n\nAccording to the latest data from the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research, women in full-time, year-round jobs earn just under 82 cents on the dollar compared to white men. When broken down by race, however, the figures are especially grim for black and Latinx women, who earn 62 and 55 percent, respectively, of what white men earn.\n\nRead more:\n\nEmmys 2019: 12 things to know, from a quiet end for \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 to that Jenny McCarthy red-carpet disaster\n\nWhy the gender pay gap persists (and what we can do about it)\n\nWomen don\u2019t just face a gender pay gap.
