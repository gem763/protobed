Bloomberg reported this week that the Treasury Department, in a development sure to gladden the hearts of the corporate class, was considering a rollback of rules written by the Obama administration to prevent the very kinds of shenanigans Mr. Trump once condemned.\n\nWhile Congress focuses on the question of whether to impeach Mr. Trump, the potential change in tax policy is a reminder that the wheels of the government grind on \u2014 and that Mr. Trump\u2019s administration continues to make decisions that are bad for most Americans.\n\nIn recent months, the Agriculture Department has decided to reduce inspections at the slaughterhouses that process the nation\u2019s pork; the Environmental Protection Agency has decided to let farmers and factories dump toxic chemicals into thousands of acres of previously protected wetlands; and the Labor Department has ruled that states can perform drug tests on applicants for unemployment benefits, allowing Texas, Mississippi and Wisconsin to begin efforts to curtail aid for people who need help.", "description": "As impeachment commands the spotlight, the Trump administration continues to gut the rule book to hurt millions.", "authors": ["The Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/12/opinion/12inversionWeb/12inversionWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
