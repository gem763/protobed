But Mr Johnson dismissed this as \u201chumbug\u201d.\n\nHe also rebuffed fears voiced by friends of murdered Labour MP Jo Cox after he drew criticism for referring to a law banning a no-deal Brexit as \"the Surrender Act\u201d and claiming that parliament had \"betrayed\" Leave voters.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

But never to demonise the other side and always hold onto what we have in common.\"\n\nAnd Anna Soubry, leader of the Independent Group for Change, said the language used in the Commons had reduced her to tears and forced other MPs to leave the Palace of Westminster, \"such has been the distress\".\n\nJohn Bercow, the Commons speaker, had asked Mr Johnson to remain in the chamber as MPs voiced their concerns but he refused, instead waving his hand dismissively in the air and walking out.\n\nLabour\u2019s Paula Sherriff, a friend of the Ms Cox, had earlier told the prime minister that people sending MPs abuse and death threats often echoed the language he used, and said he should be \u201cabsolutely ashamed of himself\u201d.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

He should be absolutely ashamed of himself.\"\n\nHer speech received a round of applause from Labour MPs.\n\nBut Mr Johnson dismissed her concerns, saying: \u201cI have to say, Mr Speaker, that I have never heard so much humbug in my life.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
