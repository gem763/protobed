REUTERS/Adriano Machado\n\nBEIJING (Reuters) - The Chinese defence minister said on Monday that resolving the \u201cTaiwan question\u201d is China\u2019s greatest national interest, and that no force can prevent China\u2019s \u201creunification\u201d.\n\nSeparatist activities are doomed to failure, Defence Minister Wei Fenghe said at the opening in Beijing of the Xiangshan Forum, which China styles as its answer to the annual Shangri-La Dialogue security forum in Singapore.\n\nTensions between China and Taiwan have ratcheted up ahead of a presidential election on the island in January. Taiwan is China\u2019s most sensitive territorial issue.\n\nProudly democratic Taiwan has lambasted China for its authoritarian rule and for being a threat to regional peace, while China has heaped pressure on Taiwan, whittling away at its few remaining diplomatic allies.\n\nChina regards Taiwan as its sacred territory, to be brought under Beijing\u2019s rule, by force if needed, a message President Xi Jinping reiterated at the start of this year.\n\nDefeated Nationalist forces fled to Taiwan in 1949 at the end of a civil war with the Communists. The People\u2019s Republic of China has never governed Taiwan, whose people have shown no interest in being run by autocratic Beijing.", "description": "The Chinese defence minister said on Monday that resolving the \"Taiwan question\" is China's greatest national interest, and that no force can prevent China's \"reunification\".", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443176108&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K02L", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
