Throughout the five rooms, there are allusions to some of the Grimms\u2019 gorier stories, such as \u201cThe White Bride and the Black One\u201d and \u201cOne-Eye, Two-Eyes and Three-Eyes,\u201d as well as Rapunzel\u2019s tower and Cinderella\u2019s Insta-ready glass slipper.\n\nAD\n\nThe food and drink are German, with sausages and pretzels from the Berliner, and several cocktails with the Black Forest\u2019s Monkey 47 gin. Pub Grimm is open nightly, but special events include Drag Queen Story Hour on Saturdays at 5:30 p.m., and a ticketed Halloween party ($15) with drink specials and free candy. Opens at 5 p.m. through Nov. 3. Closed Mondays. Free admission. Drinks $7-$14.\n\nAD\n\nCostumes and Cocktails at Suns Cinema\n\nA creative costume is a must for a party thrown by Washington\u2019s most idiosyncratic art house cinema. Head to the first-floor bar to sip horror movie-themed cocktails and listen to creepy music while clips and images from classic films are screened on the walls. (The featured film in the upstairs theater, \u201cMidsommar,\u201d is sold out.) Oct. 25 at 9 p.m. Free admission.\n\nAD\n\nSoul Strolls at Congressional Cemetery\n\nThe final resting place of politicians, warriors, spiritualists and one of the conspirators in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, Congressional Cemetery is full of stories. During the cemetery\u2019s annual Soul Strolls tours, visitors come face-to-face with some of Congressional\u2019s \u201cpermanent residents,\u201d and learn that the dead, in fact, do tell tales. Flashlights are encouraged, and a pop-up bar is available. VIP tickets include three cocktails in the spooky Public Vault, which has served as the resting place of three presidents and first lady Dolley Madison. Oct. 25 from 7 to 10 p.m., Oct. 26 from 6 to 10 p.m. $25 adults, $12 ages 12 and younger. VIP $60. A limited number of $30 general admission tickets will be sold on a first-come, first-served basis each night.\n\nAD\n\nI Put A Spell on You at the Folger Library\n\nWitches have been associated with Halloween since the beginning, but the Folger Library\u2019s celebration wants to go beyond the usual black cats and broomsticks. Poets Kiki Petrosino (author of the acclaimed \u201cWitch Wife\u201d) and Annie Finch (\u201cThe Poetry Witch: Little Book of Spells\u201d) read poems about witchcraft, magic and the natural world. The Folger\u2019s curators are assembling a special display of books about witches from the library\u2019s collection for the night. So don\u2019t be surprised to see a few weird sisters. Oct. 28 at 7:30 p.m. $15.\n\nHall-O-Screen Party: 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' at the Reach\n\nThe Kennedy Center\u2019s new expansion gets into the Halloween spirit with an outdoor alternative to trick-or-treating. It begins with dance instructors teaching the moves to \u201cThe Monster Mash,\u201d \u201cThriller\u201d and the decidedly-not-family-friendly \u201cTime Warp\u201d from \u201cThe Rocky Horror Picture Show,\u201d followed by an outdoor screening of Tim Burton\u2019s \u201cThe Nightmare Before Christmas\u201d on the Reach\u2019s video wall. Bring a picnic or purchase something from food trucks and bar stations. Oct. 31: Dance lessons from\n\n6 to 7 p.m., film at 7:30 p.m. Free.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRed Derby Pumpkin Carving Contest\n\nFor 12 years, the Red Derby has encouraged its regulars to carve pumpkins and drink beers and shots. Thank heaven for kid-safe carving tools, eh? This night of arts and crafts for adults finds talented artists creating intricate designs on their pumpkins, while others work on more rudimentary jack-o\u2019-lanterns. The Derby provides pumpkins to the first 10 singles or groups, so you might want to bring your own gourd to ensure you get one. Important rules: No carving allowed before 7 p.m., and the judging begins promptly at 9, with bar tabs and other prizes up for grabs. Oct. 31 at 7 p.m. Free.\n\nHalloween at the Line Hotel\n\nThere\u2019s a multimodal Halloween party going on at the Line Hotel in Adams Morgan: Local muralist Kasey O\u2019Boyle leads a free, colorful pumpkin painting class for families on the hotel\u2019s front steps from 4 to 6 p.m., with free cider and sweets, while all ages can trick-or-treat inside with Erik Bruner-Yang\u2019s restaurant Brothers and Sisters.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe final rooftop Camp at the Line party of the season, which runs from 7 to 11 p.m., features performances by the Gay/Bash queens, music and costume contests, all in support of the Whitman-Walker Clinic. Admission is $15 at the door and includes one drink.\n\nThe night is capped with an immersive party at Brothers and Sisters and the hotel\u2019s Full Service Radio studio, hosted by the BLCKNLIT podcast team, with themed snacks and drinks from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m. While admission is free, capacity is limited, so early arrival is suggested. Oct. 31 from 4 p.m. to 1 a.m.\n\nAD", "description": "Why waste your clever new costume at a ho-hum party?", "authors": ["Fritz Hahn", "Reporter Covering Bars", "Drinks", "Nightlife For The Washington Post'S Weekend Section"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/UtLm0f1SfhDa56_9e-Dx1TnlPR8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/56NQ6RDGXMI6TAV27T7P6IZOR4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
