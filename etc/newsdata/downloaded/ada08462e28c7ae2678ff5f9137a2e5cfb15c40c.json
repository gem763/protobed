On Monday, it barely moved, inching along about 14 miles in 11 hours. Such slow movement meant that the Bahamas stayed within Dorian's eyewall, the strongest part of the hurricane, for over a day, which few places on Earth have ever experienced.\n\nAt least five people have been killed, neighborhoods and roads have been flooded, and thousands of homes are ruined.\n\nThese photos show what the damage from Dorian is like in the Bahamas.", "description": "Hurricane Dorian stalled over the Bahamas on Tuesday morning.
