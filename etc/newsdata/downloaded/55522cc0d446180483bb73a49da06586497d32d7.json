A farmer\u2019s son who left school at 14, he turned a region of dark hedgerows and stony farms, of poverty and emigration, into a thriving industrial hub.\n\nHe started by selling gravel from the family farm and expanded, creating one company after another. Quinn Cement, Quinn Glass, Quinn Energy, Quinn Manufacturing, Quinn Thermos, Quinn Packaging, Quinn Rooftiles, Quinn Building Products, Quinn Innovation Academy, the name so ubiquitous that some signs simply said Q.\n\nThe empire straddled the border between County Fermanagh, in Northern Ireland, and County Meath, in the Republic of Ireland. Despite disruption during the Troubles, it created thousands of jobs and a \u00a33bn fortune that made Quinn the 177th richest person in the world.\n\nThen he made a disastrous bet on a toxic bank and in 2011 he lost control of his companies. He was declared bankrupt. A vertiginous rise and fall, but not the end of the Quinn story.\n\nLast month masked men abducted Kevin Lunney, a father of six, from his home near Derrylin, in Fermanagh. They slashed his face, broke a leg, tore out fingernails and poured bleach on the wounds. Before dumping him bloodied but alive on a road across the border, there was a final, sadistic touch: they carved QIH on his chest. Quinn Industrial Holdings.\n\nThe attack on 17 September shocked Ireland. The cruelty, the barbarity. And the fact it turned out to be part of a wider campaign of intimidation against executives who run remnants of Quinn\u2019s empire.\n\nLunney, 50, is the operations director of QIH. In 2014 the company acquired Quinn Building Products and Quinn Packaging with money from US-based private equity funds. Many managers, like Lunney, are local men who used to work for Quinn.\n\nSince 2011 they have experienced about 70 incidents of intimidation: vehicles stolen and burned; Facebook groups calling them usurpers; roadside signs branding them traitors; a pig\u2019s head left on a doorstep; an assault in a cafe.\n\n\u201cThe states on both sides of the border have been challenged as to whether the rule of law still applies here,\u201d said John McCartin, a non-executive director. \u201cIf people can be run out of town by a criminal entity, well, the states have surrendered the region.\u201d\n\nThe saga is playing out amid unprecedented scrutiny on the border, with technocrats and politicians from across Europe and the US visiting to study the great riddle of Brexit. Yet few outsiders have noticed that this bucolic landscape \u2013 an inspiration for Seamus Heaney \u2013 harbours a sinister mystery worthy of Cosa Nostra.\n\nPolice said a gang of professional criminals abducted and tortured Lunney. The question is why. Nothing was stolen, no ransom demanded.\n\n\u201cThe untouchables in the region have to be called to account for their actions. They\u2019re still untouchable. No one has been arrested,\u201d said Father Oliver O\u2019Reilly, the parish priest of Ballyconnell, a town just inside the republic.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Father Oliver O\u2019Reilly, parish priest of Ballyconnell, County Cavan Photograph: Rory Carroll/The Guardian\n\nO\u2019Reilly caused a sensation on 29 September when from the pulpit of Our Lady Of Lourdes church he denounced Lunney\u2019s assault as a \u201cmodern form of crucifixion\u201d akin to those deployed by the likes of Islamic State. \u201cThis tactic is used to frighten, intimidate and terrorise ordinary people.\u201d\n\nThe priest said a \u201cgodfather\u201d was overseeing a mafia-style campaign against QIH executives. He said he and the community should have spoken out long ago. \u201cFriends, there is now an obvious cancer of evil in our midst \u2026 we can no longer behave like the ostrich by putting our heads in the sand and pretend that life is normal in our area.\u201d\n\nThe congregation gave thunderous applause. When the Guardian accompanied O\u2019Reilly around Ballyconnell last week, parishioners sought him out to shake his hand.\n\nNot all welcomed the homily, he said. \u201cA small section of the community has other loyalties. They told me it wasn\u2019t my place to say such things.\u201d\n\nQuinn, 71, who lives in a gated mansion in Ballyconnell, did not respond to an interview request for this article, but he told a local radio station, Northern Sound, that the attack was \u201cbarbaric\u201d and that he feared he and his family would be blamed. \u201cSome people will look in our direction at it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe fallen tycoon vehemently denied any responsibility for the assault or the intimidation against his former proteges. \u201cThese guys pushed me out, sacked me three and a half years ago, and I\u2019ve had no correspondence, no dealings, no arguments, no fights or anything with them since. It\u2019s a pity that people are coming back to me all the time and asking me to condemn it. Sure of course I\u2019ve condemned it dozens of times.\u201d\n\nAt his peak Quinn owned a private jet \u2013 registered G-KWIN \u2013 and was busy expanding into insurance, banking and hotels across Europe and Asia. There was talk of him bequeathing \u20ac1bn to each of his five children.\n\nAn audacious gamble on Anglo-Irish Bank proved catastrophic when the bank\u2019s share price collapsed in 2008, wiping out much of the Quinn family fortune and embodying the Celtic Tiger\u2019s economic crash. Quinn was declared bankrupt in 2011 and a year later jailed for three months for contempt of court after trying to block the seizure of international assets. Upon his release and return home, a forklift truck held up a giant poster saying \u201cWelcome home Se\u00e1n Quinn\u201d.\n\nFacebook groups and roadside signs denounced the executives who took over from Quinn as \u201cgrabbers\u201d and demanded Quinn\u2019s reinstatement. Several hundred people attended a rally in support of Quinn in 2018.\n\nIntimidation escalated this year. In February a man in a service station cafe broke Lunney\u2019s nose and threw hot water in the face of Dara O\u2019Reilly, QIH\u2019s chief finance officer. In May an anonymous letter threatened company executives with a \u201cpermanent solution\u201d.\n\nMcCaffrey said there had been \u201cgaps\u201d in the police response, but he welcomed the greater number and visibility of officers in the area since Lunney\u2019s ordeal. The company would continue, the CEO vowed. \u201cWe try to justify to our families that we\u2019re right to keep going. We don\u2019t want to become hermits.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A sign protesting Se\u00e1n Quinn\u2019s exclusion from Quinn Industrial Holdings. Photograph: Rory Carroll/The Guardian\n\nA few hundred yards from the company\u2019s HQ a roadside sign accuses McCaffrey, Lunney and his brother Tony, another director, of having inflated salaries (McCaffrey calls the figures exaggerated). Underneath, in red, the sign adds: \u201cSe\u00e1n Quinn zero \u00a3pounds.\u201d\n\nThe sign has stood in front of a tile shop for several years. When the Guardian asked the shop\u2019s employees about it, they looked blank. \u201cWe know nothing about it.\u201d", "description": "Mystery surrounds vicious abduction of manager of former companies of failed businessman Se\u00e1n Quinn", "authors": ["Rory Carroll"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2017b7fb5495259258cedd7e18d9802349753c04/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e620e688689d7487f1a0f6a38e34a044", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
