First, it directly contradicts Gordon Sondland\u2019s own testimony that John Bolton and top advisor Fiona Hill supported what he was doing on Ukraine. \u201cWe went over the entire Ukraine strategy with Ambassador Bolton, who agreed with the strategy and signed off on it,\u201d said Sondland of a phone conference he had with Bolton in June. \u201cIndeed, over the spring and summer of 2019, I received nothing but cordial responses from Ambassador Bolton and Dr. Hill. Nothing was ever raised to me about any concerns regarding our Ukrainian policy.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not what WaPo\u2019s sources say, as you\u2019re about to see.\n\nSecond, the story claims that Sondland pressed two visiting Ukrainian officials about the \u201cinvestigations\u201d Trump was interested in during a meeting on July 10 \u2014 in Bolton\u2019s office, with Bolton sitting right there, along with Hill and Alexander Vindman. As far as I know, that\u2019s the first time anyone\u2019s claimed that Bolton himself had firsthand knowledge of what Sondland and presumably Trump were up to. He\u2019s a direct witness to the \u201cquo\u201d side of the alleged quid pro quo.\n\nAnd he didn\u2019t react well to it.\n\nThe two [Ukrainians] were ushered into a meeting in Bolton\u2019s office in the West Wing [on July 10] along with Sondland, Volker, Hill, Vindman and others, according to witness accounts. The American team was working through standard U.S.-Ukraine talking points, including the United States\u2019 desire to see Kyiv crack down on corruption, when officials familiar with the meeting say Sondland went off script. Sondland turned the conversation away from ongoing corruption probes to reviving specific investigations that were important to Trump, according to testimony from Hill and Vindman. Although the remark was cryptic, they understood Sondland to be reflecting Trump\u2019s desire to see Ukraine train its investigative resources on an energy company, Burisma, that had hired Hunter Biden, the former vice president\u2019s son, to serve as a board member for about five years. Bolton was so alarmed by the exchange that he ended the meeting abruptly and ordered those gathered out of his office, officials said. As the group filed out, Sondland instructed the Ukrainians to follow him to the Ward Room, a space in the basement of the West Wing used for meetings by national security officials.\n\nBolton then told Hill to follow everyone down to the Ward Room and watch Sondland. Hill testified that she entered the room \u201cas the follow-up meeting was already underway and heard Sondland say the word \u2018Burisma\u2019 as he resumed pressing the Ukrainians to pursue certain investigations. She then ordered that meeting to an immediate close.\u201d Vindman reportedly corroborated that yesterday in his own testimony, claiming that after they arrived in the Ward Room Sondland pitched the Ukrainians on \u201cinvestigations into the 2016 election, the Bidens and Burisma.\u201d It was afterward that Vindman claims he told Sondland that those were \u201cinappropriate\u201d subjects to raise. And it was later, when Hill told Bolton what Sondland had said, that Bolton allegedly uttered his now-famous line about not being part of the \u201cdrug deal\u201d that Giuliani and Sondland were working on.\n\nSondland claimed in his own testimony that neither Bolton nor Hill \u201cshared any critical comments with me, even after our July 10, 2019 White House meeting.\u201d Either that\u2019s an outright lie or the WaPo story is false. Or, I suppose, it\u2019s a *very* lawyerly description of what happened on July 10. Kicking someone out of your office in alarm and disgust technically isn\u2019t a \u201ccritical comment,\u201d is it? And are we to believe that Hill said nothing critical to Sondland even after ordering him to end the Ward Room meeting where the Bidens were being discussed?\n\nWe\u2019re going to need to hear from Bolton. I know Democrats feel pressure to wrap this up ASAP so that impeachment doesn\u2019t bleed into the start of the Democratic primaries but there\u2019s now reason to believe that an official as high-ranking as the National Security Advisor saw the attempt to pressure the Ukrainians over the Bidens with his own eyes. Remember, some Democrats in the House maintain that that in itself is an impeachable offense even if it can\u2019t be proved that Trump tried to use Ukraine\u2019s military aid (or the prospect of a meeting between him and Zelensky) as leverage over them. He was using his office to try to damage a potential electoral opponent with help from a foreign state. A quid pro quo would make that worse, but it\u2019s not necessary to justify impeachment.\n\nTrump would respond (and has responded) that investigating possible corruption by a former U.S. official like Joe Biden is in the public interest. If Joe used his influence over foreign aid to get the Ukrainians to back off Hunter Biden\u2019s company, as Trump suspects, then Americans need to know that. That\u2019s where Bolton comes in: Why did he react so strongly to Sondland leaning on the Ukrainians about Burisma? Doesn\u2019t he want to fight corruption by the Obama administration? Or does he suspect, or have reason to believe, that Trump\u2019s motive really was electoral and improper?\n\nI\u2019d be keen to hear him, Hill, Vindman, and Sondland answer this question: When and how, exactly, did they first come to realize that investigating Burisma was a priority for the president in Ukraine diplomacy? Bolton had been on the job since April 2018. By the time the meeting in his office on July 10 of this year had occurred, he\u2019d spent 15 months dealing intermittently with Ukraine issues. Had Burisma come up at any point in 2018? At any time during the first three months of 2019? Or, coincidentally, did the interest in exposing Joe Biden\u2019s alleged corruption only materialize around the time this spring that Biden began moving more intently towards running for president? The earlier we can place Trump\u2019s interest in Burisma, the more credible his \u201cfighting corruption\u201d motive will seem.\n\nAlthough that would still leave us wondering which other former or current U.S. officials he\u2019s asked for foreign help in investigating. The Bidens aren\u2019t the sum total of corruption to be found within the federal government, past or present, of course. If this isn\u2019t about damaging an election opponent, then who else is on the president\u2019s radar right now in terms of unearthing their corrupt schemes overseas whose exposure *wouldn\u2019t* directly serve his political interests? Any Bush administration officials? Mitch McConnell?\n\nThe July 10 meeting isn\u2019t the only information Bolton allegedly has that might be useful to clearing up what Trump did or didn\u2019t know. Remember that he also reportedly warned the U.S. trade representative in August that Trump would probably turn down his request to restore full trade privileges to Ukraine, although he didn\u2019t give a reason as to why. August was when the White House was withholding Ukraine\u2019s military aid; the timing suggests that trade privileges may also have been backburnered in order to increase the pressure on the Ukrainians to \u201cfight corruption.\u201d When is he going to testify?", "description": "\"Bolton was so alarmed by the exchange that he ended the meeting abruptly...\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/b-8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
