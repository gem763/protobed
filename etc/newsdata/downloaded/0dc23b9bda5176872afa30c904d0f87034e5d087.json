Jefferies Financial Group Inc. isn\u2019t so sure.\n\nThe global headwinds that pushed the central bank to cut rates in July and September have abated somewhat, according to the firm\u2019s money market economist Thomas Simons. U.S.-China trade tensions and Brexit uncertainty have also diminished, while the gap between the Fed\u2019s policy stance and that of other central banks has narrowed, he said.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Simons believes policy makers are likely to keep rates unchanged in the days ahead and leave a December cut on the table. While holding rates may spur a \u201ctemper tantrum\u201d in markets, it would push back against aggressive Fed pricing and cement the idea of a mid-cycle policy adjustment, Simons said.\n\n\u201cIf they continue with so many consecutive rate cuts, they can never break the cycle of market expectations thinking more are coming,\u201d Simons said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the Fed to take a step back and see if the prior cuts are going to have an effect before moving forward with another one.\u201d\n\nBenchmark 10-year Treasury yields rose to a six-week high of 1.86% on Monday as President Donald Trump touted trade progress and the European Union granted the U.K. a three-month Brexit delay. Rates on 2-year Treasuries climbed by about three basis points.\n\nTemper Tantrum\n\nFed fund futures are currently pricing in almost 22 basis points of easing on Wednesday, and 30 basis points by year-end. The Fed\u2019s September meeting minutes showed policy makers were split about the need for further rate cuts.\n\nA knee-jerk response to the Fed standing pat would likely see U.S. stocks -- which rallied to record highs on Monday -- sink and the yield curve \u201ctwist,\u201d according to Simons. In other words, while the Fed\u2019s bill purchases and lower inflation expectations should continue to suppress short- and long-dated yields, 3- to 7-year Treasuries may sell off, he said.\n\n\u201cThere will be a little bit of a temper tantrum, but I think the volatility will be short-lived,\u201d Simons said. \u201cStocks won\u2019t like it, but it isn\u2019t exactly going to set off a prolonged sell-off.\u201d\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Katherine Greifeld in New York at kgreifeld@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Benjamin Purvis at bpurvis@bloomberg.net, Michael P.
