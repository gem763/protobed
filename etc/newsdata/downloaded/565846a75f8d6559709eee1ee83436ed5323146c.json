But it\u2019s not yet clear whether he will seriously considering yanking the federal prosecutor-turned-star lawyer from a case that has drawn worldwide attention and sparked debate about whether Chicago authorities have been too hard on Smollett or given him favorable treatment.\n\nStakes in the investigation are high. While Smollett maintains he was the victim of a real attack in January, the special prosecutor could seek to reinstate charges or bring new ones if he concludes the original charges were improperly dropped. Any such finding could also politically damage Foxx, who in 2016 became Cook County\u2019s first black female state\u2019s attorney.\n\nWebb\u2019s investigation includes looking into whether Foxx\u2019s calls with a Smollett relative and ex-aide of former first lady Michelle Obama influenced the decision to dismiss charges. While Foxx recused herself before that March decision, communications released later by her office showed she continued to weigh in on the case. Webb is a Republican; Foxx is a Democrat.\n\nWebb, 74, is a widely respected, even legendary figure to many in legal circles. As U.S. attorney in the 1980s, he played a central role in a watershed corruption investigation called \u201cOperation Greylord,\u201d which sent dozens of Chicago judges and lawyers to prison.\n\nAnd Webb has been the go-to for years for judges, agencies and companies seeking someone with legal gravitas to oversee their investigations. He was hired by the city of Chicago to review how City Hall attorneys handle excessive-force lawsuits against police, and issued a report in 2016 that concluded they don\u2019t regularly hide or obstruct access to evidence. Many civil rights lawyers sharply criticized Webb\u2019s conclusions, saying ample evidence disputed his findings.\n\nThe risk in not replacing Webb is that it could foster an impression that Cook County\u2019s justice system is controlled by establishment figures who watch out for each other and occasionally pull strings to get VIP defendants like Smollett out of legal trouble.\n\nThe close-knit nature of Chicago\u2019s legal profession _ where apparent conflicts of interests crop up often _ was demonstrated by Judge LeRoy Martin Jr. decision in May to transfer the decision to appoint a special prosecutor to Toomin because Martin\u2019s prosecutor son works for Foxx.\n\nWhile members of the public may see Webb\u2019s donations as tainting any findings by him, there\u2019s no indication either Foxx or Smollett\u2019s lawyers will press for his replacement. Smollett\u2019s legal team opposed the appointment of any special prosecutor, arguing the case was handled properly and should have stayed closed.\n\nWebb, in many ways, is the consummate insider. Co-chairman of the high-powered Winston & Strawn, his clients have included ex-Illinois Gov. George Ryan and tobacco giant Philip Morris. Last year, President Donald Trump asked Webb to represent him. Webb declined \u201cdue to business conflicts,\u201d his law firm said at the time.\n\nWebb\u2019s explanation for why he didn\u2019t mention the financial support of Foxx earlier was that he didn\u2019t remember it until someone recently brought it to his attention. Such fundraisers at Winston & Strawn, he said, are common. Webb added that he had \u201cno recollection\u201d of attending the fundraiser.\n\nMichael Helfand, a Chicago-based lawyer who runs a lawyer referral service in the region, says he understands why such a donation by Webb to Foxx might raise eyebrows. He said it\u2019s common for Chicago lawyers to donate to candidates for the county\u2019s top prosecutor.\n\n\u201cAnd when you look on his career as a whole, Webb doesn\u2019t have a blemish,\u201d he said. \u201cFor anyone in the know, his reputation is beyond reproach.\u201d\n\nToomin could try to replace Webb with a lawyer or state\u2019s attorney from elsewhere in Illinois without deep ties across Chicago\u2019s legal profession. But even if Toomin were inclined to offer the job to someone else, there may be few takers.\n\nWhen he announced Webb\u2019s appointment in August, Toomin said attorneys from other counties showed little interest in an investigation that, no matter how it plays out, will inevitably spark outrage in some quarters.\n\n___\n\nFollow Michael Tarm on Twitter: https://twitter.com/mtarm\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A Chicago judge could decide this week whether the special prosecutor investigating possible conflicts of interest in Jussie Smollett's criminal case has a conflict himself, the latest twist in a saga marked by turns and reversals since the \"Empire\" actor reported a racist, homophobic attack that police say he staged against himself.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Michael Tarm"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/03/31/ap_essay_the_politics_of_certainty_00196_c0-54-2896-1742_s1770x1032.jpg?9acc71020c90df7ccc0823cddcdd4cc7c4c69a85"}
