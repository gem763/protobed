There was a lot of passion in that rink,\u201d she added. \u201cLast spring, when we had the announcement of the (Canadian Women\u2019s Hockey League) folding, I don\u2019t think too many of us thought we\u2019d have this kind of event put together in the short time that we did. So to see the talent out there, to see the fans supporting us, it was a pretty special day.\u201d\n\nHistoric, perhaps as well, Jenner added, because it provided players validation that they just might be on to something.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s knowing what we\u2019re doing is something that\u2019s bigger than ourselves,\u201d said fellow national team member Kacey Bellamy. \u201cAnd 50 years from now, we\u2019re going to look back and say, \u2018Wow, we started this.\u2019\u201d\n\nThough it might be premature for anyone to get ahead of themselves, the tour got off to a solid start.\n\nThe game began with a ceremonial faceoff featuring Hockey Night in Canada television fixtures Don Cherry and Ron MacLean, and PWHPA executive and Hockey Hall of Famer Jayna Hefford. And it ended with Jenna McParland stuffing in a rebound to break a 3-3 tie with 3:20 remaining.\n\nJust as important was the turnout, both games were played in front of a mostly packed arena with single-game tickets costing $15.\n\nMore impressive was the large collection of corporate sponsors the union assembled to not only pay for the players\u2019 travel, lodging and food, but also outfit them with jerseys and track suits emblazoned with the PWHPA logo.\n\nUnifor, Canada\u2019s largest private sector union, served as the title sponsor, and has also committed to paying for the four Canada-based teams\u2019 practice times. Adidas provided the clothes. Budweiser was on board, while also offering up a lounge for fans. The NHL Players\u2019 Association provided enough of a commitment to have its logo placed on the upper right chest of the jerseys.\n\nOther sponsors included Secret, Bauer, Tim Hortons and the Toronto Maple Leafs.\n\nThe \u201cDream Gap\u201d name of the barn-storming tour represents the missing link for young girls who fear being limited to competing in college or the Olympics while never having a shot to play professionally.\n\nThe PWHPA is also made up of U.S. and European players and has already scheduled tour stops in New Hampshire and Chicago next month with more in the planning stages. American players also made their union debuts this weekend by playing games against Boston College and San Jose Sharks alumni.\n\nHefford, who served as the CWHL interim commissioner when it folded last spring, estimated the PWHPA has already attracted more financial support from sponsors than the Canadian league did in its final year.\n\n\u201cCompanies are coming on I believe because they\u2019ve come to understand the current circumstance of the game where you have a player like Marie-Philip Poulin or a Hilary Knight making $3,000 a year. People didn\u2019t understand that,\u201d Hefford said.\n\nThe players\u2019 movement was borne out of the CWHL\u2019s demise after a 12-year run in which it out-grew its limitations in relying on volunteers and how much it could pay players under Canadian tax laws. Another issue was players accepting the status quo of little-to-no compensation, with players spending their own money on everything from tape to airport parking for away games.\n\nSarah Nurse was dismayed by the playing conditions during her one CWHL season after completing her four-year college career at Wisconsin. She noted Badgers players were treated far better than the pros.\n\n\u201cWhen I came to the CWHL and I saw everybody so satisfied with what they had, it shocked me and it made me sad because it was like, \u2018You guys, we\u2019re so much better than this,\u2019\u201d Nurse said. \u201cSo when the CWHL folded it was honestly just the kick in the butt we needed to really put this thing in motion.\u201d\n\nWhat remains unclear is what the women\u2019s pro hockey landscape will resemble a year from now, and whether the PWHPA can generate enough momentum to gain the attention of the game\u2019s stakeholders, in particular Hockey Canada, USA Hockey and the NHL. Another question is the stability of the five-team, U.S.-based National Women\u2019s Hockey League, which is embarking on its fifth season without many of its most high-profile players.\n\nNHL Commissioner Gary Bettman has repeatedly said he doesn\u2019t want to be viewed as \u201ca bully\u201d in pushing a women\u2019s league out of business. He\u2019s also said the NHL doesn\u2019t believe in either of the league\u2019s business models. Though the NHL provides funds to the NWHL, the league is mostly backed by private investors.\n\nThe players are pushing for the NHL to step in because it can provide them stability and the necessary infrastructure - from marketing to man-power - to promote and grow women\u2019s hockey.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about them just doing us a favor,\u201d Hefford said of the NHL. \u201cWe bring content. We bring diversity and inclusion. We bring some entertainment value that people love.\u201d\n\nThough Jenner said every option is on the table, the NWHL isn\u2019t considered a realistic option with players having already gone through the disappointment of the CWHL folding.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about someone coming in and saying, \u2018I have $20 million. I want to start a pro league, beautiful\u2019\u201d Hefford said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what these players want. They want something that they know in 10 years, 15 years, 20 years down the road is going to be there, and it\u2019s going to continue to grow and it\u2019s going to be strong. So to me, you need that infrastructure and we never had that with the CWHL.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The reality of what the new women's pro hockey union was launching didn't resonate with Brianne Jenner until she came out of the locker room and saw the crowd - many of them young girls - in the stands of the 700-seat arena.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Wawrow"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
