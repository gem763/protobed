It contains the standard Whopper toppings \u2014 onions, pickles, lettuce, tomatoes, ketchup and mayonnaise \u2014 but unlike the classic Whopper, the spooky version features a white\u2013cheddar cheese flavored sesame seed bun.\n\n(Courtesy of Burger King) More\n\nYahoo Finance got its hands on the Ghost Whopper for a taste test. There was broad consensus that the promotional photo (juicy and appetizing) and the actual product (flat and dry) looked extremely different.\n\nUpon tasting the burger, we found the Ghost Whopper much less impressive than Burger King\u2019s other new menu item, the meatless Impossible Whopper. \u201cI\u2019m just not sure this is as amazing as the Impossible Whopper, which tasted very good,\u201d YFi PM host Zack Guzman said.\n\nIn addition, not everyone who tasted the Ghost burger noticed the cheddar flavor in the bun, and we all agreed that the original Whopper and Impossible Whopper are far superior in taste and appeal. The suggested retail price for the Ghost Whopper is $4.59.\n\nInnovation\n\nBurger King has been focused on innovation over recent quarters, and its efforts appear to be paying off, as seen in parent company Restaurant Brands International\u2019s (QSR) third quarter financial results. Monday morning, Restaurant Brands reported that same-store sales, a key metric for restaurants, far exceeded Wall Street expectations.\n\nBurger King\u2019s nationwide rollout of the Impossible Whopper in August boosted food traffic significantly for the burger chain during the last quarter, and Restaurant Brands CEO Jose Cil boasted 15% international sales growth and 5% comp sales domestically \u2014 the company\u2019s best since 2015.\n\nShares of Restaurant Brands have soared 26% in 2019, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 23% in the same time period.\n\n\u2014\n\nHeidi Chung is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
