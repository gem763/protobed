Her friends told her the nuggets were Sunfed brand vegan chicken.\n\n'They tasted off to me but I figured it was just because I was drunk. I was wrong,' the alleged victim confessed.\n\nThe woman said her sister messaged her a day later telling her to check her friend's Snapchat story, which featured a video of her friends showing the chicken nuggets' packaging before convincing her to eat them.\n\nLater the pranksters mocked their alleged victim by pretending to be her - after finding out she'd eaten meat.\n\n'[They were doing] things like fake crying and yelling \"the CHICKENS!!!\"' the user wrote.\n\nBut the self-described vegan captured the video using her phones screen recording function before taking it to police.\n\n'Now 3 of my (ex) friends are facing charges,' she said.\n\nThe anonymous Reddit user did not immediately respond to DailyMail.com's request for comment Wednesday night.\n\nHer post has received more than 31,500 up or down votes since it was posted.\n\nMany Reddit users praised her for taking action against her so-called friends.\n\n'Spongebob taught me that pranks are for the enjoyment of the pranksters,' wrote Reddit user 247Brett. 'They did it for themselves at the expense of their friend, making it worse by mocking her and posting it on Snapchat.'\n\nOthers said the vegan overreacted to a tasteless, but ultimately harmless prank.\n\n'You\u2019re pressing charges over chicken nuggets,' wrote Reddit user GroundhogNight. 'You have a moral stance against meat. That\u2019s fine. But it\u2019s not a life threatening allergy. It\u2019s absolutely a sh*tty thing for them to do. They aren\u2019t friends. They should be ashamed. But pressing charges is just way too much.'", "description": "A group of pranksters may be looking at criminal charges after their self-described vegan friends told police they tricked her into eating real chicken nuggets, according to an anonymous Reddit post.", "authors": ["Chauncey Alcorn For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/02/19518192-0-image-a-34_1570669969435.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
