By the time it sped up it was too close to a nearly full moon for astronomers to detect, according to the emails.\n\nA planetary defence officer at Nasa had written that 2019 OK appeared to be the largest asteroid to pass so close to earth in the last century. Another such event was not expected to occur until 2029, they said.\n\nWhile there was never a chance the asteroid would have collided with Earth, a news release sent out weeks later by Nasa said: \u201cIf 2019 OK had entered and disrupted in Earth\u2019s atmosphere over land, the blast wave could have created localised devastation to an area roughly 50 miles across.\u201d\n\nThe failure to identify the space rock as a near-Earth object highlights the need to better fund detection efforts.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
