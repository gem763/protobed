I have a brother with autism, and the phrase is pretty versatile and, I thought, inoffensive.\n\nBut things change.\n\nBack in April, I wrote a piece for Offspring called \u201cHow to Parent a Typical Child When You Also Have One With a Disability.\u201d Yes, it\u2019s a mouthful, but \u2014 as I learned during the editing process \u2014 I should not use the phrase \u201cspecial needs child.\u201d\n\nWhy? Because, as the National Centre on Disability and Journalism\u2019s Disability Language Style Guide points out:\n\nThe term \u201cspecial needs\u201d was popularised... in the early 20th century during a push for special needs education to serve people with all kinds of disabilities. The word \u201cspecial\u201d in relationship to those with disabilities is now widely considered offensive because it euphemistically stigmatises that which is different. The term \u201cspecial education\u201d is still widely used when referring to public school programs, although some government entities use titles like \u201cexceptional student services.\u201d\n\nAlthough I am a journalist and I have a brother with a disability, I had no idea this style guide existed. Which is to say, don\u2019t feel badly if you\u2019re not up on all the appropriate phrasing and terminology. It\u2019s not about getting it perfect \u2014 it\u2019s about trying and being open to learning how to be better.\n\nInstead of \u201cspecial needs,\u201d the style guide advises \u201cto cite the specific disability or disabilities in question. The term \u2018functional needs\u2019 is preferred when a term is required. For example, \u2018addressing the functional needs of people with disabilities\u2019 could be used when referring to a facility or program.\u201d\n\nThe style guide acknowledges from the get-go that things change quickly, which makes it tough for journalists \u2014 and people wanting to be mindful that they don\u2019t cause accidental offence \u2014 to keep up.\n\nSome specifics\n\nIn general, the guide recommends person-first language. That means you recognise the person before the disability, so \u201cthe person, who has a disability\u201d instead of \u201cthe disabled person.\u201d\n\nThe guide is 41 pages, so this isn\u2019t going to be a comprehensive look, but here are some other guidelines to keep in mind:\n\n\u201cDwarfism\u201d is a medical condition for anyone shorter than 4-feet, 10-inches tall. Once commonly used in pop culture and general speech, \u201cmidget\u201d is considered derogatory. The Little People of America suggests the terms \u201cshort stature,\u201d \u201clittle person\u201d or \u201csomeone with dwarfism.\u201d When used in a non-medical way, however, \u201cdwarf\u201d is often considered offensive.\n\nAvoid using \u201cdifferently abled.\u201d Many find it condescending and offensive. Instead, stick with \u201cperson with a disability.\u201d\n\nIf someone uses a wheelchair, avoid saying she is \u201cwheelchair bound\u201d or \u201cconfined to a wheelchair,\u201d which \u201cdescribe a person only in relationship to a piece of equipment.\u201d Instead, use simply \u201csomeone who uses a wheelchair.\u201d\n\nThe World Federation of the Deaf adopted the official terms \u201cdeaf\u201d and \u201chard of hearing\u201d in 1991. Some people who are deaf and identify with the deaf community prefer \u201cdeaf\u201d to \u201chard of hearing.\u201d Meanwhile, others who don\u2019t have a cultural affiliation with the deaf community may prefer \u201chard of hearing.\u201d The Disability Style Guide also suggests capitalising the D when referencing the Deaf community.\n\nUse \u201clegally blind\u201d only when someone has nearly complete loss of sight and \u201cblind\u201d in other cases. Other terms such as \u201climited vision,\u201d \u201cvisually impaired\u201d and \u201clow vision\u201d may also be used \u2014 it\u2019s best to ask people what they prefer.\n\nThe general point\n\nYou may notice a trend here: If you don\u2019t know, just ask. It can be difficult to do \u2014 we don\u2019t like to appear na\u00efve, and we don\u2019t want to make anyone feel uncomfortable (including ourselves). However, it\u2019s worth a moment of discomfort to make another feel valued and heard.\n\nIf you can\u2019t ask the person directly, ask a caregiver. My brother, for example, can\u2019t tell you how he likes to be identified \u2014 he\u2019s nonverbal \u2014 but my family doesn\u2019t mind if you call him \u201cautistic,\u201d which is a debate the guide recognises: Some people object to using \u201cautistic\u201d as an adjective and prefer \u201csomeone with autism.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not an exact science, but simply being aware can go a long way in preventing hurt feelings and helping a person with a disability.\n\nThis is by no means the only guide like this. The Diversity Style Guide, put out by the Centre for Integration and Improvement of Journalism at San Francisco State University, is another tool for journalists that can help you use sensitivity to navigate a complex world.", "description": "I have used the term \u201cspecial needs\u201d freely and often throughout my life.
