We suppose she does a good enough job of it all on her own but still \u2026 noooo.\n\nSay it ain\u2019t so, Tulsi!\n\nNo, don't do that. Better to speak up at the debate against it. \u2014 Nick Flor-ProfessorF (@ProfessorF) October 10, 2019\n\nIf you decide to boycott, you'll make Elizabeth Warren and DNC's day.\n\nMay as well fire up the 3rd party candidacy\u2026 \u2014 I.

It will be more powerful to call out dnc and everyone right in front of them with millions of people watching ! Please reconsider \ud83d\ude4f \u2014 Grumpy Birdie Sanders (@grumpybirdieS) October 10, 2019\n\nThis grumpy person is right you know. Tulsi would make a far bigger \u2018dent\u2019 if she brought this up during the debate instead of boycotting.\n\nTulsi, go and SPEAK UP! \u2014 Bee (@Dahntahn7) October 10, 2019\n\nYup.\n\nPlus we\u2019ll be honest, we really want to see her drag Kamala and the other Democrats at least one more time \u2026\n\nRelated:\n\nOOPSIE!
