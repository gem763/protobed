(AP) \u2014 \u201cTarzan\u201d actor Ron Ely\u2019s wife was stabbed to death in their California home by their 30-year-old son, who was then shot and killed by sheriff\u2019s deputies, authorities said Wednesday.\n\nDeputies summoned to the home by a 911 call found Valerie Lundeen Ely, 62, dead with multiple stab wounds shortly after 8 p.m. Tuesday, a Santa Barbara County sheriff\u2019s statement said.\n\nThe deputies talked to Ron Ely and identified his son, 30-year-old Cameron Ely, as the suspect, and found him outside the home in Hope Ranch, a suburb of luxury homes outside Santa Barbara, authorities said.\n\nCameron Ely posed a threat to deputies, four of whom opened fire and killed him, the statement said. It did not say what he had done that was threatening.\n\nRon Ely, 81, played the title character on the NBC series \u201cTarzan,\u201d which ran from 1966 to 1968.\n\nHe was host of the Miss America pageant in 1980 and 1981 and later married Valerie Ely, a former Miss Florida. The couple had three children.\n\nThere was no report of Ron Ely being injured. Authorities confirmed he was at the home during the stabbing and the shooting, and an earlier sheriff\u2019s statement said an elderly man in the home was taken to a hospital for evaluation.\n\nThe home where the killings took place is one of two addresses listed in public records for Cameron Ely. It is not clear whether he had been living with his parents.\n\nThe tall, musclebound actor Ron Ely was not quite as well-known as Johnny Weismuller, the Olympic swimmer who played \u201cTarzan,\u201d the character created by novelist Edgar Rice Burroughs, in movies in the 1930s and 1940s. But Ely formed the image of the shirtless, loincloth-wearing character remembered by many in the baby-boom generation.\n\nEly said in interviews that he did his own stunts on the show, working directly and precariously with the tigers, chimps and other wild animals that were Tarzan\u2019s friends and servants.\n\nEly\u2019s Tarzan didn\u2019t speak in the monosyllabic grunts often associated with the character. He was instead an educated bachelor who had grown sick of civilization and had returned to African jungle where he was raised.\n\nEly also played the title character in the 1975 action film \u201cDoc Savage: The Man of Bronze,\u201d but otherwise had mostly small roles in TV and films including the 1958 movie musical \u201cSouth Pacific.\u201d\n\nEly retired from acting to focus on his family in 2001. But he returned briefly in 2014 in the TV movie \u201cExpecting Amish.\u201d", "description": "SANTA BARBARA, Calif.
