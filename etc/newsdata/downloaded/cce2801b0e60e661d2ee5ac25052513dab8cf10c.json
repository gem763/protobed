I needed therapy'", "language": "en", "text": "As his mobster-in-therapy masterpiece is named the best TV of the century, its creator says he was just thrashing out his own issues with his domineering, suffocating mother\n\nThe first image David Chase had in mind for the show that became The Sopranos was a closeup of Tony Soprano opening his eyes, \u201cwaking up for the day\u201d. That scene ended up falling later in the pilot. The opening scene, as any of the show\u2019s superfans will happily inform you, watches Tony eyeing up a sculpture in a therapist\u2019s waiting room with baffled rage. The show is 20 years old this year, and if that makes you feel ancient, \u201cthink how I feel,\u201d says creator David Chase, who, at 74, is ferocious looking, with beady black eyes and the intense, long-suffering air of the protagonist whose name has become synonymous with his own.\n\nIf The Sopranos was groundbreaking at its debut two decades ago, it now occupies an even rarer category: a show that has become more admired and beloved with time. The Guardian has named The Sopranos the best TV show of the century so far, and its influence continues to be felt across viewing platforms that didn\u2019t exist at the time of its conception. The prestige TV series, which unspools like a Russian novel but engages like a telenovela, set the tone for the boom in high-quality binge-programming \u2013 funny, smart, acutely well-observed and immensely addictive \u2013 that has reinvented the form.\n\nChase conceived of The Sopranos after decades of writing for network shows such as The Rockford Files and Northern Exposure. He was entirely unsurprised when Fox turned down the idea. \u201cThey don\u2019t trust their audience at all,\u201d he says. The Sopranos was too indeterminate; not a straightforward mob drama but not a mob comedy, either, although it is funny. In terms of character development, it\u2019s too slow for network tastes. And then there was Tony himself. \u201cI think they were afraid of it. Because how could you like this guy?\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Tony is too fat, he\u2019s too crude\u2019 ... David Chase. Photograph: Ali Smith/The Guardian\n\nThe Sopranos ended up at HBO. Surprisingly, Chase thinks it would have a tough time being commissioned today, in spite of the fact that, after six seasons and 86 episodes, it is credited with changing audience tastes. \u201cIn this landscape? Sure,\u201d he says. \u201cTony Soprano is too fat. He\u2019s too crude. Who cares about New Jersey? I\u2019ve seen these guys before.\u201d There is a long pause. \u201cIt\u2019s not dystopian enough. Everything seems to be dystopian now, and this isn\u2019t.\u201d Plus, I suggest, nobody in television can predict what\u2019s going to work.\n\n\u201cRight, exactly. They buy something then they hate it. They hate whatever they buy. They\u2019re all excited when they buy it, a week goes by and then they hate it. They hated Seinfeld. All that.\u201d\n\nWe are in Chase\u2019s office in midtown Manhattan, where he is working on his new project, The Many Saints of Newark: a movie prequel to The Sopranos set in 1967 that follows Tony and the other protagonists as young men. The young Tony will be played by James Gandolfini\u2019s son, Michael. Chase originally wanted to work in film; until his own show changed the balance of power, he and almost everyone else in Hollywood considered TV the inferior medium. Now that his wish has come true, he finds himself, with effortless pessimism, missing some elements of the HBO experience. \u201cIt made me appreciate the fact that we could write so quickly, on command, for a deadline. Sort of like journalism. Crank it out.\u201d Is making a movie agonising? \u201cYes it is. I read the other day that Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n wrote Roma in six days or something.\u201d He looks immensely depressed. \u201cI could never do that.\u201d\n\nReturning to Tony\u2019s childhood has been a strange experience. By the end of filming The Sopranos, Chase and James Gandolfini, who died in 2013, were thoroughly sick of each other. \u201cHe was tired of me, for sure. And I was kind of tired of him. But then we went on to make a movie together [2012\u2019s Not Fade Away] and things were fine. It was refreshed.\u201d So too, after two decades, is Chase\u2019s interest in the show\u2019s backstory, although revisiting the characters has not been simple. Not only is the film is set in a different era, but the setting \u2013 downtown Newark, as opposed to the New Jersey suburbs where Chase grew up \u2013 is unfamiliar. To tell the story of Tony\u2019s childhood, Chase is ranging further outside his own experience than he did while concocting some of the show\u2019s more outlandish plot lines.\n\nThe common factor, of course, is the psychological acuity with which Chase writes. The success of The Sopranos lies in the instantly recognisable relationship between Tony and his toxic mother Livia, which Chase based on his relationship with his own mother. The sense of Tony\u2019s mid-career burnout drew on Chase\u2019s own experience too, although when he rewatches early episodes now, what strikes him is how young Gandolfini was \u2013 only 35 in the pilot. \u201cI see him now and he looks like a kid.\u201d\n\nIt was Gandolfini\u2019s charm, says Chase, that accounted for so much of the show\u2019s popularity, particularly the tricky act of getting audiences to sympathise with a killer. \u201cI could tell you a million reasons, but one of them, I\u2019m pretty sure, is that Jim Gandolfini was a magnet. He was impeccable. His eyes are sad. They\u2019re alive. His problems are our problems.\u201d\n\nChase\u2019s mother was already dead when he wrote The Sopranos; he doubts he could\u2019ve written the show had she still been around. Looking back, he thinks he went overboard in characterising his childhood as bad. In fact, it was largely happy, a childhood in which he was \u201cfree to roam and do what I wanted. Break windows.\u201d His father owned a hardware store and his mother, although difficult, didn\u2019t interfere in his life too much at that stage. He wrote about her before The Sopranos, he says, and \u201cshe didn\u2019t recognise herself. I did an episode of The Rockford Files that was kind of like The Sopranos, about an Italian mother and her son who\u2019s a hit man. They were going to give him up so that the mob boss would give her a house. It was a similar tone. She didn\u2019t get it.\u201d\n\nWas she proud of his TV career? \u201cNot particularly. She didn\u2019t understand it. My mother was a great one for saying, \u2018who do you think you are?\u2019 I took her to the airport one time in Los Angeles and we were waiting for the plane. I said, \u2018Did you ever have Thai food?\u2019 I was crazy about Thai food at that time. She said no. I said, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s great.\u2019 She said\u201d \u2013 Chase\u2019s tone sharpens into sarcasm \u2013 \u201c\u2018Oh really? You\u2019re becoming quite a man of the world.\u2019\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cAnd her last words to me as she got on the plane were: \u2018Don\u2019t get too cocky.\u2019\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The doctor will fear you now \u2026 Gandolfini with Lorraine Bracco as therapist Dr Jennifer Melfi. Photograph: HBO/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nOne of the mistakes Chase says he made while writing the original pilot for The Sopranos was trying to make it palatable to network tastes: \u201cIt was a mob show but I didn\u2019t have anybody murdered. And I think that might\u2019ve been one of the reasons why it didn\u2019t sell.\u201d For a while, he had been happy turning out formulaic scripts on hit shows with big mainstream audiences, not least because it was so well paid. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s the problem: the money. The money was attractive, particularly when you\u2019re raising a family. And I was lucky in that I was working with people who made shows that weren\u2019t disgusting to work on.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd yet, \u201cthere was always a grain of something else, bugging me. I just didn\u2019t feel I was right for that medium. I was very lucky, but I was just never happy, never content.\u201d\n\nSome of this was because of Chase\u2019s ornery nature. But he also chafed against the more absurd notes that came down from network executives. \u201cI remember one time on The Rockford Files, we had a meeting before the season started. And the guy who was our new liaison with the network gave us a list of story ideas they\u2019d like to see for the season. One was Jim\u2019s real daughter, Gigi, is kidnapped and Jim has to go find her. Another was a baby is left on Jim\u2019s doorstep. Stuff like that.\u201d He shakes his head in what-a-world fashion. \u201cIt\u2019s absurd.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Don\u2019t get too cocky ... Nancy Marchand as Tony\u2019s mother Livia. Photograph: HO/Reuters\n\nMost of Chase\u2019s work is character driven, and his first idea for The Sopranos came from the central dynamic between Tony and \u201cthe mother who was problematic and sent to a nursing home; she was his real enemy. That was the first thought. I had that idea for a movie, but my agent at the time told me that mob comedies weren\u2019t happening, so I put it aside.\u201d Around that time, he was asked if he\u2019d be interested in doing a TV version of The Godfather. Chase refused \u2013 \u201cbecause it had been done\u201d \u2013 but it revived his interest in his own mob idea. \u201cI was thinking, not The Godfather, but I have that thing about the guy going to therapy. Maybe I\u2019ll try that.\u201d\n\nA mobster-in-therapy was a funny idea, but Chase didn\u2019t see it as a sendup. He himself had been saved by therapy; without it, he would almost certainly have driven away his wife, Denise Kelly, to whom he has been married for almost 50 years: \u201cShe saved my life.\u201d He first saw a therapist when he was 31, after his wife\u2019s sister died of a brain aneurysm. Kelly was grieving, but on the way back from the funeral, all Chase could do was complain about how awful his mother had been. She had been pretty awful; when he rang her to break the news of his sister-in-law\u2019s death, \u201cshe said, \u2018She died from what?\u2019 I said, \u2018A brain aneurysm.\u2019 She said, \u2018You see David? She was too smart.\u2019\u201d\n\nHis mother\u2019s response was beside the point, of course. \u201cMy wife had lost her sister and all I could talk about was my parents and the problems they created for me. I was just totally selfish. And my wife said to me, \u2018You need help.\u2019\u201d He was in therapy on and off for years and says it helped him immeasurably, although he is still constitutionally inclined to be \u201cgnawed to death by doubt\u201d \u2013 the main antidote to which is his wife. \u201cIt\u2019s not that she is Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm, she\u2019s not a Pollyanna. But she\u2019s not subject to this endless dismal terror and negativity. She doesn\u2019t think that way.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Jim was a magnet\u2019 ... Chase and Gandolfini in 1999. Photograph: Jill Connelly/Associated Press\n\nThese days, Chase understands that happiness is a moving target. At the height of The Sopranos\u2019 success, life was pretty good \u2013 even the pressure was thrilling, compared to the somewhat problematic ease of his life now. \u201cYou just had to keep going; you had a deadline. Nowadays, when I\u2019m writing, it gets to the point where if I don\u2019t like it, I throw it aside and don\u2019t finish it. There\u2019s nothing to force me to finish it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s one of the reasons he likes directing; it doesn\u2019t leave room for doubt. \u201cI have trouble making decisions. Should I have the veal cutlet, should I have something else? Waiter! I\u2019m going to change my order! But directing, you have to make decisions quickly.\u201d\n\nThe one thing Chase has no anxiety about is The Sopranos\u2019 endlessly deliberated ending. It ended the show with a precise degree of ambiguity that honoured the subtleties of the preceding six series, although its lack of resolution left some viewers complaining that they wanted closure. \u201cI would say that there\u2019s more symmetry than meets the eye,\u201d he says. But the whole point of the ending was to avoid wrapping it up too neatly.\n\nChase\u2019s bullishness evaporates when it comes to new projects, however, and he looks anxious again. Writing the prequel has been enjoyable \u2013 and also the usual nightmare. \u201cI am like that,\u201d he says gloomily. \u201cI worry about the future. I worry: is it going to be any good?\u201d He furrows his brow with a hint of amusement at his own absurdity and says: \u201cThat comes from my mother.\u201d", "description": "As his mobster-in-therapy masterpiece is named the best TV of the century, its creator says he was just thrashing out his own issues with his domineering, suffocating mother", "authors": ["Emma Brockes"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9f201a98b8562d0b14d7dcea23c11eeb96b542e/366_180_3226_1936/master/3226.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5ba8cd073205f00c11c39d70754c0152", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
