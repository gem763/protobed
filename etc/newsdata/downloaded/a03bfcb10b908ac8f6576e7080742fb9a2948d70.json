In the National Football League, teams can challenge a call on the field\u2014but there\u2019s a risk. If instant replay doesn\u2019t merit overturning the call, the challenging team loses one of its three timeouts. That discourages frivolous challenges and keeps the game flowing, while also providing a way to reverse egregious errors.\n\nWhy not amend the Constitution so that any president who is impeached and acquitted is permitted to serve a third term? That would allow him to make up for the time lost advancing the agenda that voters elected him to enact. It would preserve impeachment for genuine offenses but discourage its use for disputed ones and for mere politics. Absent such an amendment, and in an era when government is divided more often than not, impeachment seems likely to become an increasingly common means of opposition.", "description": "", "authors": ["William Mattox", "Wsj.Com Articles Mod"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
