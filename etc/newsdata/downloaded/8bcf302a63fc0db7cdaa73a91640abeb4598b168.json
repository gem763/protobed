The Dearborn, Michigan-based company will be under pressure to avoid a work stoppage while it\u2019s going through a high-stakes strategic revamp of its operations. S&P Global Ratings downgraded Ford\u2019s debt to one level above junk on Friday, saying the overhaul will be difficult to pull off.\n\nThe prolonged strike, which began on Sept. 16, dented revenue up and down the automotive supply chain, and potentially shaved tens of thousands of workers from an October jobs report due out next week from the Labor Department.\n\nGM and the UAW reached their agreement last week, awarding workers pay raises, $11,000 ratification bonuses and a route for temporary employees to reach full-time status. The contract also preserves the automaker\u2019s generous health-care plan.\n\nMaking Up Lost Time\n\n\u201cGM is proud to provide good-paying jobs to tens of thousands of employees in America and to grow our substantial investment in the U.S.,\u201d Mary Barra, GM\u2019s chief executive officer, said in a statement. \u201cAs one team, we can move forward and stay focused on our priorities of safety and building high-quality cars, trucks and crossovers for our customers.\u201d\n\nNow GM needs to make up for lost time. The automaker built up inventory before the strike, especially with its new full-size pickup trucks, but it will take a week to get production up to full capacity, said Jeff Schuster, senior vice president of forecasting for research firm LMC Automotive.\n\nThe company reports earnings on Oct. 29 and is likely to detail the impact of the strike and address how much can be recouped. Of the $2 billion lost, it could recover $431 million of that by year\u2019s end, Credit-Suisse analyst Dan Levy wrote in a recent research note. But GM is unlikely to hit its adjusted earnings estimate of $6.50 to $7 a share, said David Whiston, a Morningstar Inc. analyst.\n\nShares of the automaker rose 2.6 per cent to $36.74 on Friday, the highest close in almost a month.\n\nGM is proud to provide good-paying jobs to tens of thousands of employees in America and to grow our substantial investment in the U.S\n\nElectric Hummer\n\nThe new contract is expected to raise the automaker\u2019s labor costs by at least $100 million a year, though it allows the company to follow through with closing all but one of the four U.S. plants it announced plans to shutter almost a year ago.\n\nWhile the deal likely won\u2019t help reduce the $13-an-hour premium that the Center for Automotive Research estimates GM pays workers over foreign automakers\u2019 wage rates, it\u2019s unlikely to lead to an increase in vehicle prices. Labor expenses only account for about 5 per cent of the cost of a car.\n\nGM committed to investing $7.7 billion in U.S. plants and create or retain 9,000 jobs as part of the deal. The automaker will save a factory that sits on the border between Detroit and the town of Hamtramck, where it will build a new line of electric trucks and sport utility vehicles. Among the models under consideration are SUVs that would revive the Hummer brand.\n\nThe automaker also plans to build a new joint-venture facility in Lordstown, Ohio, that will make battery packs for electric vehicles. That\u2019s still a setback for workers at a now-idled assembly plant in Lordstown that once made Chevrolet Cruze compact cars. GM has no new work for that facility or two former transmission plants in Baltimore and Warren, Michigan.\n\nBenchmarking GM\n\nThe contract \u2014 which the UAW will use as a benchmark for its negotiations with Ford and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV \u2014 included the following concessions to workers:\n\n$60,000 early-retirement bonuses for up to 2,060 eligible employees who leave between Dec. 31 and Feb. 28$11,000 ratification bonus for senior employees; $4,500 for temporary workers, hourly pay raises from $18 to $32.32 for entry-level workers within four years or less, three per cent wage increases in the second and fourth year of the contract, and 4% lump sums in first and third years, one-time company contribution of $1,000 to personal savings plan for members with defined pension plans.\n\nThose payments were enough to seal what started out as a tense set of negotiations.\n\n\u201cThe ratification vote is decisive,\u201d said Harley Shaiken, labor professor at the University of California at Berkeley. \u201cWorkers were out for a long time and they had to consider how much longer they would have to stay out and what they would get. That calculation was swayed by the money up front.\u201d", "description": "GM and the UAW reached their agreement, awarding workers pay raises, $11,000 ratification bonuses and a route for temporary employees to reach full-time status", "authors": ["David Welch", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/webp.net-resizeimage-4-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
