I was so happy when I heard,\u201d says Saad Salmo, a 21-year-old Yazidi and former Isis captive from Sinjar, the minority community\u2019s historic homeland.\n\n\u201cBut Isis still has 22 of my relatives, including three of my brothers and one sister. Nothing will change until we get them back.\u201d\n\nToday, Salmo lives in a refugee camp in northern Iraq while her hometown still lies in ruins. She spent years in Isis captivity after being kidnapped along with thousands of other women and kept as slaves on Baghdadi\u2019s orders. She was moved around Syria, from Tal Afar to Raqqa, and finally to Deir ez-Zor, where she was rescued last year.\n\nIsis fighters rampaged through the town of Sinjar in northern Iraq in the early hours of 3 August 2014. They massacred thousands of men where they stood, and took an even greater number of women and children into slavery.\n\nThose who managed to escape the first wave of killings were chased up the winding roads of Mount Sinjar, which has been a place of refuge for the Yazidis throughout their history. Many died of thirst as they fled.\n\nIt is estimated that thousands of Yazidis are still missing. Thousands more are living in limbo in refugee camps, unable to return to their destroyed homes. Mass graves are still being discovered in Sinjar to this day.\n\n\u201cFor years we Yazidis have had so much suffering, so this news alleviates our pain,\u201d says 25-year-old Naveen Rasho of Baghdadi\u2019s death.\n\nRasho, a former radio announcer, was held captive for five years by Isis. She lived every day in fear. And initially, when the caliphate fell, she was too afraid to reveal her identity.\n\nShe ended up in Al-Hol camp with thousands of willing Isis wives, where she finally came forward to reveal her identity. But even today, having managed to flee the camp, she still lives in fear.\n\n\u201cAs long as there are Isis fighter alive our pain will not end,\u201d she says. \u201cWe wish Baghdadi had been killed by Yazidis.\u201d\n\nUnder Baghdadi\u2019s reign, Isis massacred and persecuted religious minorities. But the vast majority of its victims were Muslims in Iraq and Syria \u2013 people who were forced to live under the brutal caliphate.\n\nIn the Isis capital of Raqqa, the group would murder those who stood against it. The city\u2019s central square became a macabre execution site where bodies would hang for days.\n\nLike Salmo, Hussam Hammoud, a 27-year-old Raqqa native, is also displaced from his home. The ramifications of the terror group\u2019s onslaught and occupation continue to reverberate today.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a victory for the Syrian people in general. He was the boss of the organisation who killed the most people from Raqqa,\u201d he tells The Independent by phone.\n\n\u201cBut we cannot consider that his death is the end of Isis. There are thousands of Isis members and families without anyone to guard them, people like them will form the cells. They are rebuilding already.\u201d\n\nHammoud recently had to flee his home following a deal struck between Kurdish forces and the Syrian government. Many in the city now fear a return of government control in Raqqa.\n\n\u201cWe had to make a lot of sacrifices because of Daesh (Isis). We lost our houses, we lost our relatives. We lost everything for nothing,\u201d he says.\n\nIsis fighters parade in Raqqa, which became the group\u2019s de-facto capital in Syria in August 2014 (AP) More", "description": "From the Sinjar Mountains of northern Iraq to San Bernardino in California, from Raqqa to London, Istanbul and Colombo: it is a testament to the evil perpetrated by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi that his death has been celebrated across continents, ethnicity and faith.But for the victims of Isis across the Middle", "authors": ["Richard Hall"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/e90BLn4i3VEIIcnXDtFHKQ--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/e4aca38ff4e4d579e5dc1e14b1216cee", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
