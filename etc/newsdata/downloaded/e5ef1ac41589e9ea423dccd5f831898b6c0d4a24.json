Some lung illnesses have been reported by patients who only used nicotine vapes, so it is unclear if that is behind the illnesses.\n\nVaping groups worry, however, including devices in the take back is a step toward government overreach. They are concerned the DEA will start scrutinizing vaping products like narcotics.\n\n\u201cWhat we don\u2019t want to see occur is a mission creep, wherein the DEA starts to believe they can act like the [Food and Drug Administration] and spend the public\u2019s money on activities related to nicotine vaping products,\u201d said Greg Conley, president of American Vaping Association, a nonprofit that advocates for sensible regulation of vaping products.\n\nAs the death toll quickly rises, U.S. officials have begun cracking down on vaping. Last month, the Trump administration forced e-cigarette companies to take flavored vaping products off the market hoping to reduce the allure for young people.\n\nThe FDA earlier this month strengthened its warning to stop using THC vaping products.\n\nNow the government is attempting to tie e-cigarettes to opioids by including devices in National Drug Take Back Day, an annual event that allows the public to safely dispose of unwanted and expired medications.\n\n\u201cThis may not have a lot of practical import, but it is something symbolic to let people know these devices can be taken back like any other drug,\u201d said Dr. Richard Blondell, vice chairman for addiction medicine at the University of Buffalo.\n\n\u201cThese things are drugs and people don\u2019t look at it that way,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt is a good way to alter public perception and raise awareness.\u201d\n\nMr. Conley said that\u2019s unfair. He noted the DEA will not accept devices containing lithium ion batteries, an important distinction he said.\n\nIllicit THC cartridges sold on the street use lithium ion batteries, unlike nicotine devices, which run on internal batteries.\n\n\u201cThe DEA should reassess how they communicate about vaping products, as we know many Americans do not recognize the dangers of using illicit THC vaping products,\u201d he said. \u201cGeneralized messaging sends a dangerous message to adult smokers that vaping products warrant similar concerns to those for opioids and other illegal drugs.\u201d\n\nMr. Conley said the lack of specificity is confusing the public by lumping together the illegal cartridges with legal devices.\n\n\u201cThe DEA\u2019s messaging could be greatly improved,\u201d he said. \u201cThe majority of vaping devices contain internal batteries so rather than focus attention on standalone devices the DEA cannot dispose of, they should be offering specifically to dispose of vaping cartridges that may contain illegal drugs,\u201d he said.\n\nErika Sward, an American Lung Association official, said she hopes the DEA\u2019s message of linking vaping to drugs will sink in with high school students.\n\n\u201cI think, overall, this is a recognition that this is a very addictive and dangerous product for kids,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t change what needs to be done from the FDA or Congress, but it certainly can ensure that adults who don\u2019t want these products around anymore have a good way to get rid of them.\u201d\n\nVaping has jumped dramatically among high school students, rising by nearly 21% between 2017 and 2018, according to a study by the National Institute on Drug Abuse. The total number of high school students who vape is expected to exceed 25% by the end of 2019.\n\nThe youngest patient linked to a vaping illness is 13, according to the CDC. It was reported last week a 16-year woman was placed on life support because of a vaping-related injury. It is not yet known if THC was a factor in their injuries.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
