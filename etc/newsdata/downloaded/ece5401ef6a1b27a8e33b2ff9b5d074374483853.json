Cummings (D-Md.), who was admired on both sides of the aisle.\n\nAD\n\nThe resolution, introduced by Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), takes issue with Schiff\u2019s remarks at a Sept. 26 hearing.

Mueller III into possible coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign during the 2016 election.\n\nShortly after 6:30 p.m., House Democrats are expected to move to table the resolution.
