Fending off the assault, the veteran officer pulled his gun and fired six times, hitting Ashun at least once in the head.\n\nAshun was declared dead at the scene. The rookie was treated for ringing in his ears. The veteran was rushed to Brookdale Hospital with head injuries, and placed in a medically induced coma.\n\nPolice say that Ashun (above) attacked the officers as they were trying to arrest the man who urinated all over the salon. The Taser had no effect on Ashun and police shot him\n\nPolice representatives blasted the assault on the officers, the latest such incident in New York.\n\nLast week, two uniformed officers were assaulted from behind while attempting to detain a man in Brooklyn.\n\nOver the summer, numerous uniformed officers had buckets of water dumped on them by unruly gangs.\n\n'An attack on a uniformed officer doing his duty is an attack on society at large,' Benjamin Tucker, the first deputy police commissioner, said at a news conference after the incident on Friday. 'And we can't have that.'\n\nPat Lynch, head of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, was even more outspoken.\n\n'Once again we had police officers responding to a call for help from the public and was set upon,' Lynch said.\n\n'This police officer spent his career in our busiest precincts serving the community. And he was set upon. For no reason!'\n\nFriends and family of Ashun (above) were outraged at his death, wailing and screaming at NYPD officers at the scene\n\nHowever, friends and family of Ashun were outraged at his death, wailing and screaming at NYPD officers at the scene.\n\n'He struggled with mental illness and we tried desperately to get help for him to no avail,' his sister, Ama Bartley, 35, told the New York Post.\n\nShe said that Ashun had an October 14 appointment with a mobile crisis team from the city Department of Health.\n\nBut health workers determined after a short visit that he was not a threat to himself or others, she said.\n\n'Eleven days later, this is what happens,' she said. 'We tried, we really tried to get him help. He was a beautiful soul. He was just battling some heavy things.'\n\nAshun was known to run a sidewalk stand selling T-shirts and caps that he hand embroidered.", "description": "The suspect, identified as 33-year-old Kwesi Ashun, was shot dead by officers after he attacked them as they tried to arrest another man in the Goldmine Nail Salon in Brooklyn on Friday.", "authors": ["Keith Griffith For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/14/20216786-0-image-a-10_1572097591646.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
