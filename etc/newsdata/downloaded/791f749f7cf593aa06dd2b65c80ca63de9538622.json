[...] The hackers then utilized their control over Mr. Shapiro\u2019s AT&T wireless number [...] to access his personal and digital finance accounts and steal more than $1.8 million.\u201d\n\nAll accounts compromised\n\nThe document states that these actions allowed the hackers to also access Shapiro\u2019s personal accounts on several cryptocurrency exchanges:\n\n\"While third parties had control over Mr. Shapiro's AT&T wireless number, they used that control to access and reset the passwords for Mr. Shapiro's accounts on cryptocurrency exchange platforms including KuCoin, Bittrex, Wax, Coinbase, Huobi, Crytopia, LiveCoin, HitBTC, Coss.io, Liqui, and Bitfinex.\"\n\nThe plaintiff also claims to be in possession of chat logs in which AT&T employees and hackers discuss how the stolen money should be routed and brag about how much they took.\n\nHistory repeating\n\nShapiro also claims that he fell victim to SIM-swapping multiple times, therefore his personal information and online accounts were already leaked in the past. The complaint states:\n\n\u201cAT&T\u2019s Repeated Failures to Protect Mr. Shapiro\u2019s Account from Unauthorized Access Are a Violation of Federal Law.\u201d\n\nMore precisely, Shapiro alleges that AT&T is in violation of the Federal Communications Act for failing to protect the confidentiality of his account information.\n\nHe also claims that the telecom giant violated several California state\u2019s laws, including the Unfair Competition Law, the Constitutional Right to Privacy and the Consumers Legal Remedy Act. Lastly, Shapiro also accuses AT&T of two acts of negligence.\n\nNotably, this is not the first lawsuit against AT&T over SIM-swapping. As Cointelegraph reported on July 27, the federal judge overseeing the Terpin v. AT&T case dismissed the motion. At the time, this was the latest development in a legal battle pertaining to cryptocurrencies stolen via SIM-swapping that has been going on for almost a year.", "description": "California resident files a lawsuit against AT&T alleging that its employees helped to perpetrate a SIM-swap resulting in the theft of over $1.8 million, includ...", "authors": ["Adrian Zmudzinski"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvOWIyNWZjMDZlZTRkMjIwOWM3NmE1YmFlNzU4Mzc1NWYuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
