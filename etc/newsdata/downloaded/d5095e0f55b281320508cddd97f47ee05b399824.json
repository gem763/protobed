(Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nHere are the biggest moments from the Redskins\u2019 33-7 loss to the Patriots on Sunday at FedEx Field. Scroll down to see a full recap of the game.\n\nRedskins take the early lead (9:26 First Quarter): Before the Patriots scored 33 unanswered points in what turned out to be a long day for the home team, the Redskins surprised New England with a creative play-call. Rookie wide receiver Steven Sims Jr. showed off his speed and shiftiness by taking a handoff on an end-around on Washington\u2019s second possession and racing 65 yards down the right sideline for a touchdown. Tony Bergstrom and Trey Quinn made key blocks on the play, the Redskins\u2019 longest run of the season.\n\nTom Brady answers for New England (7:09 First Quarter): The Patriots needed only six plays and a little more than two minutes to respond. On second and goal from the Washington 6-yard line, Brady found wide receiver Julian Edelman on a slant pass between linebackers Jon Bostic and Cole Holcomb. Patriots kicker Mike Nugent, who was signed last week to replace the injured Stephen Gostkowski, missed the ensuing extra point, but it wouldn\u2019t much matter in the end.\n\nWashington makes a fourth-down stop (2:20 First Quarter): The maligned Redskins defense was respectable in the first half and made several key plays to keep Washington in the game. On fourth and one from the Washington 22-yard line, Patriots Coach Bill Belichick left his offense on the field and ran a direct snap to running back James White. Holcomb and safety Landon Collins combined to tackle White for a loss, resulting in a turnover on downs.\n\n[Even Tom Brady thought it was \u2018ridiculous\u2019 how many Patriots fans were at FedEx Field]\n\nMontae Nicholson intercepts Brady (5:24 Second Quarter): Greg Manusky\u2019s defense made yet another potential momentum-changing play after being put in a difficult position late in the second quarter. The Patriots were looking to add to their 9-7 lead after a Trey Quinn fumble gave them a first down at the Washington 16-yard line, but Montae Nicholson made a leaping interception just outside of the end zone on an off-balance throw by Brady.\n\nColt McCoy throws an interception before halftime (0:58 Second Quarter): Washington\u2019s offense, which struggled to move the ball after Sims\u2019s long touchdown run, committed another costly mistake just before halftime. McCoy, who finished 18 for 27 for 119 yards, threw a pass over the middle that was intended for Sims but picked off by Jason McCourty. The Redskins\u2019 defense would keep New England out of the end zone, but Nugent\u2019s short field goal allowed the Patriots to take a 12-7 lead into halftime.\n\nPatriots open the second half with a score (10:57 Third Quarter): The Redskins evidently reached their quota of defensive stands in the first two quarters, because the wheels fell off after halftime. The Patriots marched 75 yards on seven plays after receiving the second-half kickoff. Running back Brandon Bolden capped the drive by running past linebacker Ryan Anderson on a wheel route and hauling in a 29-yard touchdown pass from Brady.\n\n[Patriots\u2019 offense \u2018can be a lot better,\u2019 Tom Brady says after big win over Redskins]\n\nBrady passes Brett Favre (7:03 Third Quarter): Brady started the Patriots\u2019 second straight touchdown drive in the third quarter with a 15-yard completion to Edelman that moved the 42-year-old quarterback into third place on the NFL\u2019s all-time passing yards list. Brady, who threw for 348 yards Sunday, finished 17 yards shy of Peyton Manning for second place after being replaced by rookie Jarrett Stidham midway through the fourth quarter.\n\n\n\nNew England Patriots running back Sony Michel (26) scores a third quarter touchdown. (Jonathan Newton / The Washington Post)\n\n[Redskins drop to 0-5 after ugly home loss to Patriots, as pressure mounts for Jay Gruden]\n\nFinal: Patriots 33, Redskins 7\n\nNew England scored 33 consecutive points after the Redskins took a 7-0 lead on a 65-yard touchdown run by rookie wide receiver Steven Sims Jr. in the first quarter.\n\nPatriots quarterback Tom Brady completed 28 of 42 passes for 348 yards, three touchdowns and one interception. The 42-year-old moved past Brett Favre and into third-place on the NFL\u2019s all-time passing yards list with a third-quarter completion to Julian Edelman.\n\nRedskins quarterback Colt McCoy struggled in his first start since he broke his leg last December, completing 18 of 27 passes for 119 yards and an interception. McCoy also took a beating, getting sacked six times.\n\nExcluding Sims\u2019s touchdown run, Washington, which finished with 220 total yards, averaged three yards on its 52 plays.\n\nThe Redskins are 0-5 for the first time since 2001. Next up: a trip to Miami to play the 0-4 Dolphins.\n\n[Three takeaways from the Redskins\u2019 33-7 loss to Patriots]\n\nFourth Quarter\n\nJarrett Stidham is in at QB for New England: Tom Brady is 17 yards shy of passing Peyton Manning for second place on the all-time passing yards list, but he apparently won\u2019t get the chance to do it in front of his adoring fans at FedEx Field. With New England\u2019s fifth straight win well in hand, the rookie Stidham replaced Brady midway through the fourth quarter. The Patriots play an actual home game on Thursday against the Giants. (Patriots 33, Redskins 7, 6:11 Fourth Quarter)\n\nPatriots add to their lead: Tom Brady\u2019s third touchdown of the game was his easiest thus far, a 10-yard toss to tight end Ryan Izzo, who didn\u2019t have a Redskins defender within five yards of him in the back of the end zone. New England has scored 33 consecutive points since the Redskins took a 7-0 lead. (Patriots 33, Redskins 7, 9:14 4th Quarter)\n\nThird Quarter\n\nColt McCoy ends the third quarter with a sack: The Redskins stopped the Patriots for the first time in the second half after Daron Payne registered Washington\u2019s fourth sack of the game. Trailing by 19 points, a Washington offense that has managed only eight first downs and 105 passing yards needs to get going in a hurry in the fourth quarter. The Redskins will open the fourth quarter facing second-and-19 after McCoy took his fifth sack. (Patriots 26, Redskins 7, End of Third Quarter)\n\n\n\nRedskins quarterback Colt McCoy (12) recovers his own fumble while being sacked by Patriots outside linebacker Jamie Collins (58) during the fourth quarter. (Jonathan Newton / The Washington Post)\n\nNew England is starting to pull away: Washington\u2019s defense has had no answer for the Patriots in the second half. Tom Brady moved past Brett Favre and into third-place on the all-time passing yards list with a 15-yard completion to Julian Edelman early in a six-play, 88-yard drive that culminated in Sony Michel\u2019s 14-yard touchdown run. Brady, who is over 300 yards passing in the game, has had plenty of time to operate in the third quarter after being sacked three times in the first half. (Patriots 26, Redskins 7, 4:35 Third Quarter)\n\nRedskins\u2019 drive stalls after another crucial penalty: Washington moved quickly into New England territory on Colt McCoy\u2019s 22-yard completion to Terry McLaurin before a one-yard loss by Adrian Peterson and a an illegal use of hands penalty on lineman Ereck Flowers set up third-and-long. McCoy\u2019s ensuing pass intended for McLaurin, who leads the Redskins with three receptions, sailed well over the rookie\u2019s head and out of bounds, leading to Tress Way\u2019s sixth punt. Jay Gruden was not pleased. (Patriots 19, Redskins 7, 7:40 Third Quarter)\n\nPatriots open second half with touchdown drive: New England extended its lead by going 75 yards on seven plays on its first possession of the third quarter. Tom Brady capped the drive with a 29-yard touchdown pass to Brandon Bolden, who beat linebacker Ryan Anderson down the right sideline. After rushing only seven times in the first half, the Patriots had four carries on the drive, which lasted four minutes. (Patriots 19, Redskins 7, 10:57 Third Quarter)\n\nHalftime: Patriots 12, Redskins 7\n\nThe Redskins managed only four first downs in the first half, but they\u2019re within a touchdown of undefeated New England at home behind a strong defensive effort that limited the Patriots\u2019 ability to capitalize on mistakes. New England will get the ball to start the second half.\n\n\n\nWashington Redskins safety Montae Nicholson (35) makes an interception during the second quarter. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nSecond Quarter\n\nPatriots turn an interception into points: The Patriots went three-and-out for the first time and punted the ball away to Washington with less than a minute to play in the first half. On first down from the Redskins\u2019 25-yard line, Jason McCourty intercepted Colt McCoy\u2019s pass over the middle and returned it to the Washington 11. Greg Manusky\u2019s defense stood strong yet again, forcing a pair of Tom Brady incompletions after a six-yard gain on first down. New England settled for a 23-yard Mike Nugent field goal to take a five-point lead. (Patriots 12, Redskins 7, Second Quarter)\n\nPenalty bug bites Redskins again: After Colt McCoy completed a 17-yard pass to Terry McLaurin to give Washington some breathing room deep in its own territory, the Redskins sandwiched a couple of offensive holding penalties around a false start on their next three snaps. The second holding penalty was declined, but the damage was done, and Washington was forced to punt after Jeremy Sprinkle picked up 11 yards on third-and-15. The Patriots had one timeout remaining as they looked to add to their lead before the half. (Patriots 9, Redskins 7, 2:00 Second Quarter)\n\nRedskins giveth, Redskins taketh away: Patriots cornerback Jonathan Jones forced a fumble by Redskins wide receiver Trey Quinn that linebacker Jamie Collins recovered at the Washington 16-yard line. With New England looking to extend its lead on third down, Redskins safety Montae Nicholson intercepted an off-balance Tom Brady pass at the Washington 1-yard line. (Patriots 9, Redskins 7, 6:03 Second Quarter)\n\nWashington\u2019s pass rush gets to Tom Brady again: The Redskins entered the game with five sacks in the first four weeks. They have three in less than a half. Tim Settle\u2019s sack of Brady on first down put New England behind the chains and the Patriots elected to punt on fourth-and-one from the Washington 48-yard line three plays later. (Patriots 9, Redskins 7, 6:18 Second Quarter)\n\nRedskins go three-and-out: With the exception of Steven Sims\u2019s 65-yard touchdown run in the first quarter, Washington has done nothing against the Patriots\u2019 defense. After their second three-and-out, which began with Sims being tackled in the backfield for a loss of four, the Redskins have managed 15 total yards on their other 16 plays. Colt McCoy is 3 for 5 for 12 yards and has been sacked three times. (Patriots 9, Redskins 7, 8:38 Second Quarter)\n\nPatriots take their first lead on a field goal: On second down from the New England 33-yard line, Tom Brady unleashed a deep pass along the left sideline intended for Julian Edelman. Redskins safety Montae Nicholson was called for pass interference on the play and the questionable 40-yard penalty was upheld upon review after Coach Jay Gruden challenged the ruling. Three plays later, Mike Nugent drilled a 37-yard field goal to give New England the lead. The Patriots only have eight rushing yards, but Brady is 15 for 21 for 168 yards and a touchdown. Washington is out of challenges. (Patriots 9, Redskins 7, 6:35 Second Quarter)\n\n\n\nWashington Redskins wide receiver Steven Sims (15) runs 65 yards for a touchdown. (Nick Wass)\n\nFirst Quarter\n\nWashington forces a turnover on downs: After a false start on wide receiver Julian Edelman set up third-and-nine at the Washington 30-yard line, Tom Brady connected with Josh Gordon, who was well covered by Quinton Dunbar, for a completion over the middle. Officials initially ruled that Gordon\u2019s forward progress was enough for a New England first down, but Redskins Coach Jay Gruden challenged the spot. Upon replay review, Gordon was ruled down one yard shy of the line to gain. Bill Belichick left his offense on the field for its first fourth-down attempt of the season, a direct snap to James White. Redskins rookie Cole Holcomb and safety Landon Collins combined to drop the running back for a loss of two yards, giving the ball back to Washington. (Redskins 7, Patriots 6, 2:30 First Quarter)\n\nRedskins go three-and-out: Washington went backward on its third possession, after Danny Shelton sacked Colt McCoy for a loss of seven yards on first down. The drive ended with consecutive incompletions and the following note from CBS play-by-play man Greg Gumbel: The Redskins have yet to convert a third down of 10 yards or more this season. (Redskins 7, Patriots 6, 6:11 First Quarter)\n\nPatriots answer with a touchdown: New England went 75 yards on six plays in a little more than two minutes, and Tom Brady found Julian Edelman for a six-yard touchdown pass on a slant route that pulled New England within one. The Redskins maintained the lead after kicker Mike Nugent, signed earlier this week to replace Stephen Gostkowski, who underwent season-ending surgery, pushed the ensuing extra point wide right. (Redskins 7, Patriots 6, 7:09 First Quarter)\n\nSteven Sims Jr. gives Redskins the early lead: Rookie wide receiver Steven Sims Jr. took a handoff on an end-around and, thanks to a key block by center Tony Bergstrom, got to the edge and raced 65 yard down the right sideline for a touchdown on the second play of Washington\u2019s second possession. The Redskins\u2019 longest run of the season has the Patriots playing from behind for the first time all year. (Redskins 7, Patriots 0, 9:26 First Quarter)\n\nRedskins force a punt: Washington\u2019s league-worst third-down defense allowed a conversion on New England\u2019s first opportunity of the game, but buckled down on its next chance, with Ryan Kerrigan and Matt Ioannidis combining to sack Tom Brady. The Redskins caught a break when Brady overthrew Josh Gordon, who was open on a post route, earlier in the drive. The Patriots\u2019 next rushing attempt will be their first of the game. (Redskins 0, Patriots 0, 10:18 First Quarter)\n\nSack ends Redskins\u2019 opening drive: The Redskins won the toss and elected to receive, and Colt McCoy went right to work against the league\u2019s top-ranked defense. McCoy completed his first attempt since last December to rookie wide receiver Terry McLaurin for 12 yards. Adrian Peterson and Chris Thompson combined for one yard on Washington\u2019s next two plays before Chase Winovich sacked McCoy for a loss of eight yards. The rookie defensive end has four sacks this season. (Redskins 0, Patriots 0, 12:28 First Quarter)\n\nPregame updates\n\nSome good news for the Redskins: Rookie wide receiver Terry McLaurin, who was questionable with a hamstring injury, is active. Quarterback Case Keenum is out, which means Dwayne Haskins will back up Colt McCoy.\n\nA lot of Patriots fans made the trip to Landover to see Tom Brady and Co.\n\nPats fans are DEEP around the tunnel entrance. pic.twitter.com/CvjMPUeCLP \u2014 Kareem Copeland (@kareemcopeland) October 6, 2019", "description": "New England scored 33 unanswered points after Washington's lone score of the game: a 65-yard touchdown run by wide receiver Steven Sims in the first quarter.", "authors": ["Scott Allen", "Reporter Covering D.C.
