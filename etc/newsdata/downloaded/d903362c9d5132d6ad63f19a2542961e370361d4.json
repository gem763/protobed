USA TODAY\n\nJim Harbaugh can\u2019t swing the narrative of his football season this Saturday in Ann Arbor. He probably needs to beat Ohio State to do that.\n\nBut a loss to Iowa at Michigan Stadium would be good business for all the dispensaries in town. Not that I know where they are, or what their hours are, or whether lemon \u201cgummies\u201d go on sale Tuesday or Wednesday.\n\nHow dare you!\n\nBesides, I lean toward chocolate.\n\nTwo weeks ago in Madison, the Wolverines played as if someone mixed edibles into their pancakes. Last week against Rutgers, they played as if someone mixed Red Bull into their orange juice. This Saturday against Iowa, U-M shouldn\u2019t need anything.\n\nMichigan coach Jim Harbaugh watches his team during their game against Middle Tennessee, Saturday, August 31, 2019 at Michigan Stadium.

Which means that Harbaugh will get a chance to see if his emphasis on physicality in practice the last couple of weeks will make a difference.\n\nBecause Iowa is good. And a good test at the right time. Beat the Hawkeyes and the conversation about Harbaugh\u2019s handle on this program quiets.\n\nFor now. Or at least until Michigan travels to Penn State in a couple of weeks.\n\nBOLD PREDICTIONS: What unexpected result to watch for Saturday\n\nSTAFF PICKS: Our experts predict Auburn-Florida and the rest of Week 6\n\nBIG GAMES: Five Week 6 matchups with College Football Playoff impact\n\nBut lose to Iowa? Or, worse, get manhandled for the second time this season?\n\nDoubt returns. Maybe even resignation.", "description": "Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh is under pressure of some big losses after high expectations.
