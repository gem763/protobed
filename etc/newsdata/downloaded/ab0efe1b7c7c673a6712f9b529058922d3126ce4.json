Residents fear it could lead to politically motivated extraditions into China's much harsher judicial system. Large public demonstrations start as thousands march in the streets to protest against the extradition bill. Hong Kong lawmakers scuffle in parliament during a row over the law. Hong Kong's leader, Carrie Lam, introduces concessions to the extradition bill, including limiting the scope of extraditable offences, but critics say they are not enough. The scale of protests continues to increase as more than half a million people take to the streets. Police use rubber bullets and teargas against the biggest protests Hong Kong has seen for decades. Lam says the proposed extradition law has been postponed indefinitely. The protests continue as demonstrators storm the Legislative Council, destroying pictures, daubing graffiti on the walls and flying the old flag of Hong Kong emblazoned with the British union flag. The protests coincide with the 22nd anniversary of the handover of Hong Kong from the UK back to China. Armed men in white T-shirts thought to be supporting the Chinese government attack passengers and passers-by in Yuen Long metro station, while nearby police take no action. 44 protesters are charged with rioting, which further antagonises the anti-extradition bill movement. By now the protest movement has coalesced around five key demands: complete withdrawal of the proposed extradition bill, withdrawal of the use of the word \"riot\" in relation to the protests, unconditional release of arrested protesters and charges against them dropped, an independent inquiry into police behaviour and the implementation of genuine universal suffrage. The mass protests enter their fifteenth week, with police resorting to teargas and water cannon against the demonstrators, and a wave of \"doxxing\" using digital techniques to unmask police and protesters as a new front in the battle. Police shoot a protester with live ammunition for the first time, as demonstrations continue on the day marking the 70th anniversary of the declaration of the People's Republic of China. The first charges are brought against protesters for covering their faces, after authorities bring in new laws banning face masks in order to make it easier to identify or detain protesters. Hong Kong officials spark outrage in the city as it revealed that nearly a third of protesters arrested since June have been children. Seven hundred and 50 out of the 2,379 people arrested were under 18, and 104 were under 16.\n\nHowever, she was forced to withdraw amid calls for her resignation, with the pro-democratic legislator Claudia Mo shouting: \u201cCarrie Lam, you are a liar.\u201d\n\nThe protests began in response to a now-withdrawn extradition bill that would have allowed criminal suspects to be sent for trial in Communist party-controlled courts in mainland China.\n\nThe movement then ballooned to encompass broader clamours for universal suffrage, an independent inquiry of the policing methods used against protesters and other demands, including ending the description of protesters as rioters.\n\nSham has been one of the public faces of the protest movement as a leader of the Civil Human Rights Front, which has organised large demonstrations. He was on his way to an evening meeting in Kowloon district when four or five attackers pounced on him, leaving him with bloody head injuries but conscious, the Front said on its Facebook page.\n\nIt suggested the assault was politically motivated, linked \u201cto a spreading political terror in order to threaten and inhibit the legitimate exercise of natural and legal rights\u201d.\n\nMo and other opposition legislators on Thursday suggested the attack on Sham may have been designed to deter others from protesting, or even to help provide a pretext for the government to call off district council elections scheduled for next month.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t help but feel that this entire thing is part of a plan to shed blood on Hong Kong\u2019s peaceful protests,\u201d Mo was quoted as saying for the government broadcaster RTHK. \u201cIf you think you\u2019re being peaceful and you\u2019re safe, you\u2019re not.\u201d\n\nSham spent the night in hospital and his wounds to the head and arm were not considered life threatening, according to the station.\n\nThe assailants escaped in a vehicle and their identities remained unknown, although organised crime elements have long been accused of engineering attacks on protesters and leaders of the pro-democracy camp.\n\nLast month police arrested two people, including a 15-year-old boy, over an assault on Sham and his assistant while they were dining in a cafe. Sham was not injured in that attack.", "description": "Carrie Lam abandons chamber again after lawmakers decry assault on protest leader", "authors": ["Associated Press In Hong Kong"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/941f312e41c7bd4ed32857bf2f72e6415fcfc6b3/0_292_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=85e6bf7d3d75656493d778527945b9c1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
