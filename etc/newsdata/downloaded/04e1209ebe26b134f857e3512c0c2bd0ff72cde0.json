John Hansman, professor of aeronautics and astronautics at MIT.\n\nSwedish defence company Saab has been trialling remote air traffic control for around a decade, with testing taking place everywhere from Ireland to the US to Australia.\n\nBetter surveillance\n\nAt Scandinavian Mountains Airport, multiple cameras and sensors around the airfields and its immediate surroundings will relay data to a control center at Sundsvall in central Sweden.\n\n\"From a tech standpoint we have better surveillance,\" explains Hansman.\n\nHigh-definition screens will give the operators 360-degree views, but condensed to a 225-degree arc, meaning this virtual window can in some ways offer a more comprehensive overview than a traditional tower.\n\nAugmented reality allows the operators to see identifying flight and radar information overlaid over the live video feed, while the external sounds of the airport proper are played over speakers to its remote control center.\n\nAnother advantage of the remote technology is that vision is improved at night and in adverse conditions, and operators can also zoom in and out with ease.\n\nScandinavian Mountains Airport will open in December 2019.

More airports will look like Scandinavian Mountains Airport in the future. Courtesy Scandinavian Mountains Airport\n\n\"Virtual towers are coming to the US as part of the NextGen modernization program,\" says Gillen. \"They are in place in Scandinavia due to cost, the number of small remote airports and low traffic volumes -- this is not a technology for LaGuardia, O'Hare or Heathrow! It allows a single team to operate a number of remote airports and, in principle, could optimize an airport system.\"\n\nWhile the idea of operators not being on site may spook some, there are backup systems in place and -- in the event of a disaster or emergency which could shut down a traditional on-site tower -- it may actually be beneficial to have operators at a safe remove.\n\n\"Even today, busy airports will have approach and departure control that are not located on the airfield but in low-rise buildings elsewhere,\" says Gillen. \"They operate using radar and other sensitive information transfer devices. The move to virtual towers is a relatively small step technically and operationally.\"\n\nGillen predicts remote air traffic control is going to become more common, especially if we switch to small aircraft -- such as VTOL (Vertical Take Off and Landing) jets -- which have the flexibility to land in multiple locations, such as regional airfields.", "description": "In Sweden, Scandinavian Mountains Airport is one of the first in the world to be built without an air traffic control tower.
