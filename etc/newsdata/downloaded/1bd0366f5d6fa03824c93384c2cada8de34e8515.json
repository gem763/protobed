Some of the protesters carried signs calling for Harris to leave South Korea and characterized U.S. troops as an occupying force.\n\n\u25c6 Pockets of Anti-U.S. Sentiment\n\nAlthough polls show South Koreans overwhelmingly support the alliance with Washington, pockets of anti-U.S. sentiment remain. In 2015, a knife-wielding South Korean man with a history of militant Korean nationalism ambushed then-U.S. Ambassador Mark Lippert outside a building in downtown Seoul. Lippert sustained cuts to his arm and face.\n\nMore sporadic, minor disturbances have occurred since then. \"We note with strong concern that this is the second instance of illegal entry into the ambassador's residential compound in 14 months,\" a U.S. embassy official in Seoul said Saturday. \"We urge [South Korea] to strengthen its efforts to protect all diplomatic missions to [South Korea].\"\n\nThe group that broke into the compound Friday says it is a coalition of progressive college students. Reuters reports the group recently held a forum to present \"research findings\" on the achievements of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, and said it would welcome a visit by Kim to Seoul.\n\nThe students also attempted to break into the U.S. Embassy in Seoul last January before being stopped by police, Reuters reported. Seoul's foreign ministry said attacks on diplomatic facilities will not be tolerated, adding it will take \"all appropriate measures\" to prevent further incidents. Seoul police said they will increase security around the U.S. Embassy, according to the Yonhap news agency.\n\n", "description": "Protesters Scale Walls Outside U.S. Ambassador's Residence", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/21/2019102100388_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
