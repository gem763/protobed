This was followed by markets, which enjoyed an uptick of 52 per cent amid high demand.\n\nTattooing and piercing services increased their high street presence by 44 per cent, cafes and tea rooms by 35 per cent and hair and beauty services by 31 per cent.\n\nMeanwhile, the majority of hardest hit sectors - all showing signs of retrenching from the high street - were categorised as retailers.\n\nThe worst off, with a 70 per cent reduction in stores over the five-year period, were book and map sellers, which were among the first businesses to be hit by the rise of Amazon.\n\nComputer stores, shops selling second hand supplies and art and antique stores all suffered declines in premises too.\n\nEastbourne and Hastings, both on the coast, saw considerable decreases in the number of retail outlets on their high streets. However both also saw significant increases in the presence of 'personal service' businesses.\n\nMarkets and food specialists enjoyed an uptick on the high street between 2014 and 2019\n\nMany department stores and fashion chains, like Primark, have started offering hair and beauty services or coffee shops in stores, as high street stalwarts grapple to keep pace with the fast-changing landscape.\n\nMeanwhile, a number of phone or computer shops, are also now offering repair and advice services to attract footfall.\n\n'While it's concerning to have seen so many well-loved brands disappear from UK high streets in recent years, our research suggests the future of our town centres isn't necessarily as bleak as the reports of store closures would have you believe,' said Which? Magazine editor Harry Rose.\n\n'As shoppers needs and habits evolve, it's vital that businesses keep up with these changing trends and consider how they can grow with them, in order to continue thriving on the high street.'", "description": "Hair and beauty salons, tattoo parlours and markets are booming on Britain's high streets, while the future of some major retail chains remains at risk,\u00a0a study by Which? has found.", "authors": ["Emily Hardy For This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
