Trump has denied wrongdoing and assailed the probe.\n\nPompeo said he was proud to work with the State Department's Ukraine team, including former special envoy Kurt Volker, who connected Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani to an aide of Zelensky, to help the country fight corruption and combat Russian aggression.\n\nWatch: U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo confirms he was on the call\n\nPompeo says the call between the leaders was a legitimate conversation that focused on U.S. policy priorities. 2:02\n\n\"It's what our team, including Ambassador Volker, were focused on,\" Pompeo said. \"It was taking down the threat that Russia poses there in Ukraine. It was about helping the Ukrainians get graft out and corruption outside of their government, and to help now this new government in the Ukraine build a successful, thriving economy.\n\n\"It's been what State Department officials that I have had the privilege to lead have been engaged in, and it's what we will continue to do even while all this noise is going on.\"\n\nVolker resigned abruptly from the special envoy position last Friday after Giuliani suggested the department was well aware of his efforts to get Ukraine to open a corruption probe into Biden's son.\n\nPompeo faces increasing scrutiny\n\nPompeo is under increasing scrutiny from House Democrats leading impeachment. On Tuesday, he pushed back on House demands for interviews with State Department officials about the administration's dealings with Ukraine that are at the centre of the inquiry.\n\nHe defended his response to House committee chairmen, who have suggested that Pompeo's participation in the Trump-Zelensky call should require him to recuse himself from decisions on how to deal with Congress.\n\nPompeo asserted that House investigators contacted \"State Department employees directly\" and told them not to contact State Department lawyers for advice. He said the State Department would \"do our constitutional duty to co-operate\" with Congress, but wouldn't tolerate \"bullying and intimidation.\"\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared Wednesday in Rome, where he met with Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio.

That's unacceptable, and it's not something that I'm going to permit to happen.\"\n\nOver the past few days, Democratic chairmen of the House foreign affairs, intelligence and oversight committees issuing subpoenas to both Pompeo and Giuliani, and scheduled depositions with a series of other current and former officials, as well as associates of Giuliani, as they seek to unearth more evidence of potential wrongdoing by Trump.\n\nAnnouncements of more subpoenas and requests for depositions are expected as the impeachment investigation casts a shadow over Trump's re-election effort.\n\nAs I learn more and more each day, I am coming to the conclusion that what is taking place is not an impeachment, it is a COUP, intended to take away the Power of the.... \u2014@realDonaldTrump\n\nOn Twitter on Tuesday, Trump repeated his assertion that his call with Zelensky was \"perfect,\" and attacked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and California Rep. Adam Schiff, the House intelligence committee chairman.\n\n\"This is just another Fake News Media, together with their partner, the Democrat Party, HOAX!\" the president tweeted.\n\nPompeo also took to Twitter on Tuesday to address the investigation. He posted a letter accusing New York Rep. Eliot Engel, the House foreign affairs chairman, of requesting depositions as \"an attempt to intimidate, bully and treat improperly\" State Department employees.\n\nI\u2019m concerned with aspects of the Committee\u2019s request that can be understood only as an attempt to intimidate, bully, & treat improperly the distinguished professionals of the Department of State, including several career FSOs. <a href=\"https://t.co/QRtMaXlhQM\">pic.twitter.com/QRtMaXlhQM</a> \u2014@SecPompeo\n\nImpeachment probe gains steam\n\nMeanwhile, two former officials who were engaged in the Trump administration's dealings with Ukraine will meet with U.S. congressional committees starting this week.\n\nCongressional staff were also due to attend a briefing at the Capitol on Wednesday by the State Department's inspector general, Steve Linick, according to two sources familiar with the situation.\n\nStaff members from the Senate and House of Representatives oversight committees were invited to the briefing. The session was expected to address Ukraine-related documents that have been subpoenaed by House committees.\n\nTrump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, faces subpoenas over his involvement in efforts to open a corruption probe into the business dealings in Ukraine of the son of former vice-president Joe Biden.

That would lead to a trial in the Senate on whether to remove him from office. But the president's fellow Republicans control that chamber and have shown little appetite for removing him.\n\nYovanovitch was ordered back to Washington two months before the end of her three-year tour in Kyiv. The career diplomat, who had served during both Republican and Democratic administrations, had been the subject of attacks in right-leaning media and Democrats had suggested her recall was politically motivated.", "description": "U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo confirmed he was on a telephone call between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President\u00a0Volodymyr Zelensky that is at the\u00a0centre of an impeachment inquiry into Trump's actions.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5305498.1570016873!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/usa-italy-pompeo.jpg"}
