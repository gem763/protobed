And no celebration in the festive season is complete without loads of sweets. A month down the line and we are no longer proud of our waistlines!! The festive season brings with it a heavy intake of processed foods for meals, snacks and the in-betweens. All good things come with a price, which in this case means added sugar and tons of calories.\n\nA quick look at the dietary recommendations first. Good health indicators tell us that we need to limit the total added sugar intake to less than 10% per day. Without playing a spoilt sport in the festive season, we must remember that white sugar consumption is the main cause of lifestyle-related disorders like obesity and type 2 Diabetes. None of these is good news and before we dig into the sweets around us, we must remember a saying I live by. Once on the lips, forever on the hips!!\n\nIt\u2019s not all that disappointing actually. The recent influx of low-calorie sweeteners (LCS) can make you feel far less guilty before you dig into your next piece of besan ladoo. These sweeteners are food additives that provide sweetness with minimal calories. Low-calorie sweeteners act as a wonderful replacement to traditional sugars without affecting the taste of the food. I have been studying these sweeteners and the options available for quite some time now and have spoken to doctors, health experts and chefs who use them. My view is that it can be safely concluded that LCS may benefit blood glucose levels and are effective in weight management. A healthy diet or low-calorie diet has minimal or no free sugars. Low-calorie sweeteners are a safe alternative to free sugars when consumed within permissible limits.\n\nAt a recent forum on low-calorie sweeteners and healthy living, there was a debate on how these additives are safe for consumption. Noted chef Sanjeev Kapoor had a take on this. While he did agree that replacing most high-calorie food products is difficult, yet sugar which adds free calories to the diet can be replaced easily with low-calorie sweeteners. His take was that if we try low-calorie sweeteners for two to three weeks, we get habituated to the taste.\n\nWith Diwali in the next few days, you would want to indulge in yummy traditional sweets and distribute the same to your friends and family. While one is merry-making and pleasing the sweet tooth, one needs to be cautious of the sugar intake and at the same time doesn\u2019t have to give it up as well.\n\nSo here are some tips to go sugar-free this Diwali:\n\nOne could opt for home-made sweets, made out of low-fat organic milk or almond or coconut milk and replace white sugar to sugar-free sweeteners which are safe for consumption and ideal for people watching weight, diabetes or overall health. One can also opt for other healthier options like jaggery or honey\n\nGo for foods with natural sweeteners like dates, figs, raisins and replace it to white sugar in a recipe\n\nUse healthier ingredients like ragi, jowar, bajra, quinoa etc. These are high in protein, fibre and low in calories.\n\nAdopt different methodology to cook or prepare items instead of deep \u2013frying or shallow frying opt for air-fryer or baking\n\nDuring festivities, it is important to plan your meals, if eating out a meal, strike a balance by keeping other meals light or grab a healthy snack like a soup or a salad before stepping out to avoid binge eating\n\nPortion control and eating in moderation also helps to prevent putting on those extra kilos\n\nBe mindful, pick up food sensibly, instead of going for fried, go for grilled, baked, roasted food items. Pick up dry fruits instead of deep-fried namkeen or calorie-dense sweets\n\nSharing some healthy sugarfree recipes:\n\nApple / custard apple kheer\n\nIngredients:\n\n3 cups low fat milk\n\n\u00be cup grated apple or custard apple\n\n\u00bc tsp cardamom (elachi) powder\n\n\u00bc tsp nutmeg\n\n1 tea spoon sugar free\n\nMethod:\n\nBring the milk to boil, in a non stick pan, stirring continuously Add grated apple / custard apple.
