REUTERS/Hannah McKay/File Photo\n\nBanks, insurers and asset managers in Britain currently have unfettered access to customers across the EU but this will end after Britain leaves the bloc.\n\nFuture EU access for UK financial firms will almost certainly be based on \u201cequivalence\u201d, whereby Brussels deems that a foreign firm\u2019s home rules are aligned enough with those in the bloc to protect financial stability and customers.\n\nSimon Lewis, who stands down as chief executive of the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME) this month after a nine-year stint, said that for equivalence work, good regulatory links were needed.\n\n\u201cYou need to have structures in place like the EU-U.S. dialogue, and they probably need to go beyond that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey need to get on with that. That work hasn\u2019t started. The sooner we can have that discussion about how equivalence is going to work and be adapted, the better.\u201d\n\nEU and UK markets watchdogs are, however, at loggerheads over whether swathes of trading in euro-denominated shares can continue in London if there is a no-deal Brexit.\n\nThere is also tension over how much EU regulators should be allowed to regulate UK clearing houses with EU customers.\n\nClose regulatory dialogue would help clear up \u201cmisunderstandings\u201d and avoid equivalence decisions \u201cgoing the wrong way\u201d, Lewis said.\n\nWhile few jobs or activities have moved so far from London to new EU hubs, it was \u201cearly days\u201d.\n\n\u201cBanks are looking at how they can minimise the cost of moves by where possible local hires or deferring decisions,\u201d he said.\n\nMuch could hinge on what asset managers in London do, with many having opened hubs in Dublin and Luxembourg.\n\n\u201cIf over time the asset managers physically move from London, then that will make quite a difference.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a golden rule of any business that you should be close to your customers. That again is not entirely clear how that is going to play out,\u201d Lewis said.\n\nBanks also need to rebuild public trust shattered by taxpayer bailouts during the financial crisis a decade ago.\n\n\u201cThe industry has been seen to have overlobbied on certain issues and there was a degree of distrust about that,\u201d Lewis said.\n\n\u201cThere was a feeling that the industry was taking it for granted that its voice would always be heard. The rebuilding of trust in the industry will take quite a long time.\u201d", "description": "Intense dialogue between British and European Union financial regulators must start now or London risks being cut off from the bloc after Brexit, a top banking lobbyist said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Huw Jones", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444088196&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M0YM", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
