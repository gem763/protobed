And while he has technically handed over operation of the family business to his sons, he still benefits financially from its revenue.\n\nDemocrats have accused Trump of potentially running afoul of the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clause, which says a president can\u2019t take payments from a foreign government. Several international delegations have stayed at Trump\u2019s hotel while visiting Washington. Trump has recently suggested global leaders and their staff stay at his Doral, Fla., resort next year when the United States hosts the annual Group of Seven meeting.\n\n\u201cPeople like my product, what can I tell you, can\u2019t help it,\u201d Trump said on Wednesday. \u201cGuess they say they want to stay at a place that is better than someplace else.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "He said people choose his properties because \u201cthey\u2019re the best.\u201d", "authors": ["Congress", "Campaigns", "Health Policy", "Pennsylvania Politics", "David A.
