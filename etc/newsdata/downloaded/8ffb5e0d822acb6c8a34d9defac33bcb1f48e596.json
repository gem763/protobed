It\u2019s also personal.\n\nThe images above show bullet-resistant doors installed in a school to protect children in the event of a shooting\n\nThe new doors which have been installed in dozens of school replace old wooden doors (like the one on the left) which would be rendered ineffective by rounds from an assault rifle\n\nHis two young children attend school in the Harrington Park School District.\n\nSo he was pleasantly surprised when the district superintendent, Adam Fried, who oversees all grades up to and including middle school, reached out to him.\n\n\u2018These are military-grade products that weren't designed to be installed in schools,\u2019 Barnes told CNN.\n\n\u2018They were meant for businesses and the government.\u2019\n\nFried told Barnes about the lockdown drills that children were being put through in the schools.\n\n\u2018In the 1950s and 60s, we had drills to prepare students and staff in the event of a nuclear incident,\u2019 Fried told CNN.\n\n\u2018But now we have to protect them in the event of a shooting.\u2019\n\nThe Bnos Menachem Jewish girls day school in Brooklyn (above) was among the first to install bullet-resistant doors\n\nThe lockdown drills had children lock the classroom door, turn off the lights, pull down window blinds, and huddle together for about 20 minutes.\n\n\u2018I couldn't believe it,\u2019 Barnes said. \u2018I said \u201cMy kids, too?\u201d\n\n\u2018I was very upset that day.\n\n\u2018Can you imagine how terrifying and traumatic it must be for kids to sit there in silence?\u2019\n\nSo far this year, there have been at least 23 shootings at or near a school in the United States where at least one person was killed.\n\nFried said he wanted to bolster security for children at his schools in a way that did not detract from their daily routine.\n\n\u2018We've been through Columbine and all the school shootings after it. We know we have to improve school security,\u2019 said Fried.\n\n\u2018The question was: How do we do it so our school doesn't feel like a jail, with metal detectors? It's not healthy for kids.\u2019\n\nFried said that asking Barnes\u2019 company to install 50 new doors was a \u2018no-brainer.\u2019\n\nDespite weighing 150 pounds, the doors are easy to open, even for children, according to Barnes.\n\nThey also appear to be regular doors that come in a number of colors and finishes, blending easily into a school setting.\n\nAside from the bullet-resistant 18-gauge galvanized steel, the doors also have shatter-proof glass.\n\nIn the event of an emergency, the doors can be locked from the inside, triggering a mechanism in which 12 different metals make it virtually impossible to open from the outside.\n\n\u2018It will stop the first few bullets from penetrating all the way through,\u2019 Barnes said.\n\n\u2018And the lock will jam if you shoot at it to try to open it.\u2019\n\nBarnes said that the doors can also resist fires for up to 90 minutes.\n\nThough Barnes charges companies $3,900 for each door, he has slashed the price for school districts that are tight on cash, charging $2,500.\n\nAnother company, the South Carolina-based R2P Innovations, began selling bullet-resistant doors to schools late last year.\n\n\u2018After Sandy Hook, our engineering team decided to challenge themselves to find a way in which we could help defend school children, teachers and administrators in the event of another active shooter situation,\u2019 said founder and CEO Tony Deering.\n\n\u2018It's an unfortunate reality that school shootings are so prevalent in America.\n\n\u2018So it's crucial to be able to buy that critical 10 minutes of safety before law enforcement arrives in such a situation.\u2019\n\nAt an average cost of $4,000 each, R2P Innovation\u2019s doors weigh 260 pounds and can withstand 100 rounds from any assault rifle, according to Deering.", "description": "A Jewish girls school in Brooklyn, a public school district in New Jersey, and dozens of other schools have fortified classrooms with military-grade steel doors capable of resisting assault rifle rounds.", "authors": ["Ariel Zilber For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/16/20138170-0-image-a-28_1571931111445.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
