Drop the British media and look for other European sources", "language": "en", "text": "Politics in Western European countries these days is hopelessly divided and poisonously partisan. However, under no circumstances, is it advisable to resort to an ad hominem response to populist politics. It often backfires.\n\nFirst, constant criticism of Donald Trump as a person, instead of expanding the debate and discussion on policy-related matters, seems biased to observers of politics, who are not even sympathetic to Trump\u2019s views. Why has the Trump administration decided to rely more on Saudi Arabia and less on a Turkey, even though Turkey is a member of NATO? This and many such questions need more coverage than the constant smear campaign against the Trump administration. After all, there are many things that his political base views as positive, and on the contrary, there are policy-oriented issues raised by democrats that need scrutiny. For example, it is pertinent to ask why Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a leading Democratic presidential candidate, wants to break up major tech firms such as Facebook. What about the advantage that Facebook offers and would that benefit USA or China?\n\nA second example can be given from U.K. where the unsolvable Brexit dilemma has resulted in overemphasis on Boris Johnson\u2019s hair style instead of staying focused on the stark choices facing the British society.\n\nDonald Trump stays remarkably popular despite attempts to ridicule him and his political base. His base is still loyal to him and according to recent polls, his popularity is likely to remain more or less stable till the 2020 elections. Trump\u2019s approval among his loyal supporters jumped to 49 percent, its highest mark this year. The nationwide survey was conducted on Sept. 28 and 29, less than a week after House Democrats launched a formal impeachment inquiry. These are domestic issues. When it comes to coverage of foreign policy and and international relations, the credibility of especially the British media, which has enjoyed a status as unbiased, is also found dilapidated. BBC is now jokingly referred to as Biased Broadcasting Corporation because of its biased and neocolonial coverage of the abrogation of article 370 in Kashmir. They constantly invite guests who are left-leaning liberals, unable to understand the quagmire of nuclear brinkmanship played by Pakistan. Even other Muslim countries have stopped paying attention to the Pakistani tribal dance of nuclear threat, but not Britain.\n\nBritain\u2019s credibility as a nation is threatened by the never-ending Brexit melodrama, while the British media like The Guardian and BBC are still acting as if they were spokespersons for their colonial masters. Their inability to understand the geopolitical changes taking place in South Asia has created a vacuum and need of an unbiased media channel in Europe, which can give an unbiased report on the region.\n\nIndia is itself to blame for its treatment. Instead of putting all its eggs in the British basket, we could have easily bifurcated our attention to other European countries and established stronger ties with them. The dynamics of European politics is experiencing a tectonic shift and India\u2019s fixation on U.K., politically speaking, can be compared to the proverbial tail wagging the dog. Let\u2019s give the British news media a break and let them realize that they are no longer the colonial masters who are invited to interfere in India\u2019s internal matters.\n\nFrance is proving to be a better ally. French people understand the dilemma of urgency to fight Islamic radicalism. Why have we never given attention to Greece and Cyprus? The city of Athens is often referred to as the cradle of Western civilization. Democracy in ancient Greece served as one of the first forms of self-rule government in the ancient world. The original ideas implemented by the ancient Greeks had profound influence on the emerging democracies of the world. Students in Scandinavia have to compulsorily learn Latin and ancient history, which is more about Greece and less about Britain.\n\nGermany is economically far more powerful and far more receptive to the idea of alternative medicine whose origins lie in India. News about India in German, French and Scandinavian media is becoming far more nuanced and balanced. Despite the fact that Indians now constitute the largest immigrant group in U.K., BBC\u2019s coverage of India disappointingly remains biased.\n\nI am reiterating, it is a price Indians are paying because of overemphasizing the importance of Britain as if India is still tied to the umbilical cord of its colonial past. It\u2019s time for India to grow up. Let us see how they sort out their Brexit mess. Until then, India could use this golden opportunity to initiate good contact with rest of the European countries, which need skilled labor, are friendly towards India, and understand India\u2019s position on Kashmir.\n\nIf India improves its ties with European countries such as Germany and France, their media could serve as a source of counter-narrative to the monopolized narrative of India being hatched from London. Let\u2019s visit Hamburg, Berlin, Paris, Athens and Nicosia.\n\nLet\u2019s give the option of learning French, German, Norwegian, Greek and Italian in higher secondary schools of India. We are after all masters in learning multiple languages in India. Federico Fellini, an Italian film director and screenwriter once said, \u201c A different language is a different vision of life.\u201d English has had a monopoly on the narrative of India\u2019s political vision, it is time to give other European languages a chance now.", "description": "Politics in Western European countries these days is hopelessly divided and poisonously partisan.
