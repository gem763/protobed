In that time, a police spokesman said, more than 200 shops and public utilities had been damaged and police fired 367 tear gas rounds.\n\n\"Rioters' level of violence has been escalating, without showing any sign of abating from week to week, and has reached a very critical level,\" said Kwok Yam-yung, a regional police commander.\n\n\"Such ruthless and reckless acts are pushing the rule of law to the brink of total collapse,\" he told a news conference.\n\nMs Lam would not be drawn on what specific circumstances would be required for her to call for assistance from Beijing, only stating that the constitutional instrument was there to allow her to do so.\n\n\u201cI still strongly feel that we should find the solutions ourselves,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is also the position of the central government, that Hong Kong should tackle the problem on her own, but if the situation becomes so bad, then no options could be ruled out if we want Hong Kong to at least have another chance.\u201d\n\nTourism to the city has been devastated by the scenes of unrest in what is usually a major travel hub. But with investors\u2019 confidence rocked, the MTR train services regularly closed and businesses forced to shut amid rallies, Ms Lam said the whole economy was being severely affected.\n\n\u201cHong Kong's various sectors will enter a severe winter season,\u201d she said.\n\nThe city\u2019s protests began with outrage at Ms Lam\u2019s attempts to pass a bill that would have made it easier to extradite criminal suspects to mainland China, as well as other jurisdictions.\n\nThe unrest spiralled out of control even as the city\u2019s government agreed to first suspend and then finally withdraw the bill altogether, as protesters demanded assurances that their democratic freedoms would be protected from encroachment by Beijing.\n\nBut the protests also come at a bad time for the global financial hub, suffering keenly the impacts of a US-China trade war that is showing few signs of abating.\n\nUS President Donald Trump urged his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to ensure a \u201chumane solution\u201d in Hong Kong during a call on Monday, the White House said. He warned that any \u201cbad\u201d outcome could hurt trade talks ahead of the resumption of negotiations in Washington on Thursday.\n\nRead more\n\nNBA in grovelling apology after Hong Kong \u2018freedom\u2019 tweet backlash\n\nLast British governor of Hong Kong warns \u2018people going to get killed\u2019\n\nHong Kong protesters devise face-covering hairstyle to bypass mask ban\n\nWho are the foreigners demonstrating in Hong Kong?\n\n14-year-old boy 'shot by police officer in Hong Kong'", "description": "Hong Kong\u2019s leader Carrie Lam has warned that the Chinese military could step in to quash pro-democracy protests if the city\u2019s unrest continues to deteriorate, saying that \u201cno options could be ruled out\u201d.The chief executive\u2019s comments come after foreign envoys in the city expressed concern that China", "authors": ["Adam Withnall"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/UD1vviNGLUa9Ds83temRFw--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/c6098c4f37e226257d39c9aae2001d40", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
