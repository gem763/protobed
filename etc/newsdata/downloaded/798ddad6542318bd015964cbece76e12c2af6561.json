But it will serve at least two good ends: First, it will make it clear to diehard racists that they\u2019re not welcome over here. Second, it will protect impressionable young conservatives from being wooed by them.\n\nWhat\u2019s needed is not mere \u201coutreach\u201d to black, Hispanic, or Jewish voters. Conservatives ought to make elevation of African Americans, immigrants, and religious minorities so central to conservatism that all dedicated racists will be thoroughly repelled. If we can\u2019t make them stop calling themselves the \u201cAlt-Right,\u201d because they won\u2019t want to be associated with us, we can at least disgust them with such a focus.", "description": "", "authors": ["Timothy Carney", "Washingtonexaminer.Com Opinion Columnists Its-Time-To-Create-A-Conservative-Ecosystem-That-Doesnt-Welcome-Racists"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
