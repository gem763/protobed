It won\u2019t be at all. Alliances are very easy,\u201d Trump responded.\n\nSuch transactional coalition-building is not new. But these transactions rarely occur in a political vacuum. The United States trained and equipped Kurdish forces for decades, and established deep political ties with the Kurdish leadership. All these investments are lost. Further, the Kurds are officially allying with the Syrian government, and Russian troops are patrolling where the United States withdrew from, between Turkish and Syrian forces. This might benefit some of America\u2019s most serious foes: Russia and Iran.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe U.S. has sponsored transactional military coalitions for decades.\n\nMuch political science research finds that key ingredients for successful military partnerships involve two things: convergent threat perceptions, meaning similar ideas among coalition partners about what crises merit attention, or common security identities, meaning shared norms and values about how to address these crises. Many scholars also argue that reliability and reputation matter greatly for military cooperation. That\u2019s especially true for formal alliances, which are different from coalitions, as Mira Rapp-Hooper recently noted here at TMC.\n\nBut my research, published recently in my book and an International Security article, finds that U.S. governments have repeatedly practiced transactional military cooperation. In other words, despite rhetoric about shared threats and common values, the United States pays countries to serve in U.S.-led coalitions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nU.S. governments generally dole out two types of payments. First are deployment subsidies, which include compensation for the costs the coalition partner incurs to conduct the operation such as transport, equipment, allowances and deployment bonuses, health, disability, and life insurance, and predeployment military training.\n\nThe second type of payment involves political side deals, which encompass many kinds of political bargains including debt relief, sanctions relief, loan or trade agreements, or military equipment deals. Coalition partners can use these assets to defray deployment expenses, but the U.S. government does not check whether this is done. Sometimes, these political side deals are not spelled out in detail. Rather, they take on the form of a promise: For example, if you join this coalition, we will support your quest for an independent state.\n\nFor instance, during the Korean War, the United States compensated Turkey, Ethiopia, Thailand, Colombia, the Philippines, South Africa, Greece, Australia and New Zealand. During the Gulf War, the George H.W. Bush administration was able to convince other countries such as Germany, Japan, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia to pay for much of these payment packages. Overall, the United States collected more than $16 billion to be distributed to coalition members.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor the George W. Bush administration\u2019s 2003 coalition to invade Iraq, the U.S. government spent roughly $1.5 billion on coalition partners from 2003 to 2006, according to Government Accountability Office (GAO) estimates. Further, the Obama administration subsidized forces supporting U.S.-led operations in Afghanistan from 2010 to 2015 by roughly $9.4 billion. Kurdish forces in Syria received similar financial and military aid through, for example, the Counter-Islamic State of Iraq and Syria Train and Equip Fund.\n\nBut even these transactional coalitions only work when there are ties that bind the partners.\n\nThe U.S. government doesn\u2019t relate this way with just anyone. Since the Korean War, successive administrations have tended to offer these payments to governments with whom they have plentiful diplomatic connections. The U.S. government prefers to pay its friends and partners, not random strangers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhy? These network ties provide an insurance policy. Without them, coalition partners might be tempted to pocket the cash or other incentives and then limit their coalition commitments to the absolute minimum. After all, the United States can\u2019t watch what\u2019s going on in the deployment theater at all times and places. And if a subsidized ally failed to deliver much support \u2014 especially in situations where there are few available coalition partners \u2014 the United States doesn\u2019t have many options for punishing that failure.\n\nNetworks help with these problems. Ongoing ties give the United States more possible \u201cretaliatory linkage\u201d opportunities (i.e., the United States can manipulate exiting ties, for example, aid or trade ties and punish defection). That makes it more costly to renege on an agreement. Moreover, these ties over time can also build trust, leading to compliance.\n\nDoes all this matter for the situation in Syria?\n\nTransactions are a normal part of building military coalitions. That is a reality of world politics.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut making them work requires having social and political networks in place to ensure the agreement is actually put into action. With the Kurds, the United States has cultivated ties over the past decade \u2014 resulting in successful cooperation against the Islamic State. By abandoning the Kurds, Trump is throwing away these decade-long investments. Further, memories of U.S. abandonment may well make it impossible to ever reactivate those networks.\n\nWhat\u2019s more important, however, is that the United States has no equivalent networks in the region. Technically, it has a formal alliance with Turkey through NATO, but U.S.-Turkish relations have been spiraling downward since Turkey refused to join the Iraq War coalition in 2003, a spiral worsened by the radical turn of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s regime away from the West.\n\nPresident Trump appears determined to leave the region \u2014 though realistically, full abandonment is unlikely. The United States will thus likely feel the loss of its Kurdish partnership in the future \u2014 in Syria and beyond.\n\nAD", "description": "Alliances are based on trust, not just U.S. assistance.", "authors": ["Marina E.
