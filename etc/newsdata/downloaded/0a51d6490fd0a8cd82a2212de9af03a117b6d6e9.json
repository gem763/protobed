But after watching Trump\u2019s performance on Sunday, I went back and watched Obama\u2019s 2011 announcement of Osama bin Laden\u2019s death. It was dignified and eloquent. And then I watched George H.W. Bush\u2019s February 1991 announcement of victory in the gulf war, when he said this was \u201ccertainly not a time to gloat.\u201d What a contrast these two presidents provide! What depressing reminders of what presidential behavior used to look like!\n\nGail: We\u2019re witnessing the birth of a new, 21st-century bottom line for presidential performances. Imagine the most awful loudmouthed bully in your high school. If it\u2019s better than that it\u2019s achieved the new minimum.\n\nBret: I\u2019m as glad as anyone that al-Baghdadi is dead, and glad also that he was killed thanks to American action. I\u2019m also sorry he murdered three children in the bargain. But whatever we accomplished against ISIS with his death we undermined with our withdrawal from northern Syria, which has jeopardized the continued imprisonment of thousands of captured ISIS terrorists.\n\nGail: Truly the bottom line rule of this administration is that no news is ever going to be really good. DJT will always find a way to make it awful.\n\nBret: May I switch the subject, though? As bad as things are going for Trump, I fear they are going worse for Democrats. The presidential field is just a mess.\n\nGail: So glad you asked. When I\u2019m out on the road, everybody asks if there\u2019s any problem having these political arguments, given that you and I clearly get along so well. I always say that the main difficulty is fighting with someone who despises Donald Trump even more than I do. Then I add that if things get too convivial, I just bring up Elizabeth Warren.\n\nBret: Thank goodness for that.\n\nGail: I don\u2019t find the field all that disheartening. I think Warren could be a very good president. I do worry about electability. But she\u2019s getting to be a better campaigner every day. And if Biden demonstrates over the next months that he can hang in there and take care of business, I\u2019m fine with him. Buttigieg is too young and green, but if the primary voters don\u2019t care, I\u2019m good with him as president. The only serious candidate I have real reservations about is Bernie Sanders, who does not seem to play all that well with others. But compared with Donald Trump, he\u2019s Franklin Roosevelt.", "description": "Does Trump\u2019s path of destruction include the Democratic Party and its presidential candidates?", "authors": ["Gail Collins", "Bret Stephens"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/29/opinion/29conversation-1/29conversation-1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
