You\u2019ll know that burning, aching pain, and the constant feeling of needing to pee. You might also have to be extra careful about sex, and make a point of leaping up to go to the bathroom right after\u2014just another fun way that sex can be painful and dangerous for people with vaginas. About 30-40 percent of people with vaginas who get a UTI will get another one within a few months, and for some, they become a chronic problem.\n\nSo if you\u2019ve seen the ads on TV or Instagram for Uqora, the \u201cUTI Prevention Company\u201d that sells products it claims will \u201cprevent your next UTI,\u201d you might be tempted. Thanks to America\u2019s appalling healthcare system, millions of uninsured or underinsured people can\u2019t afford to see a doctor, or don\u2019t have one they trust. It\u2019s easy to imagine how a few taps on the iPhone and the price of a co-pay at the doctor\u2019s office\u2014without the hassle of actually going\u2014might entice UTI sufferers to try Uqora.\n\nBut appealing as it seems, the claim that Uqora can prevent a UTI is troubling. It\u2019s not just claiming to \u201chelp\u201d prevent your next UTI, like how your shampoo claims to \u201chelp prevent flakes,\u201d but to fully prevent it, period. Because Uqora\u2019s products are dietary supplements and not drugs, these claims fall into a legal and ethical gray area: Bold claims like that are meant to be reserved for drugs that have been FDA-approved, which Uqora\u2019s products haven\u2019t. Yet Uqora, and thousands of other dietary supplement companies, benefit from laws that make it all too easy to make these kinds of boundary-pushing claims.\n\nAn Instagram ad for Uqora products, served to the author. Photo by Libby Watson\n\nUqora makes three products: Target, a powder added to water that\u2019s meant to be taken after sex or every three days; Control, a pill meant to be taken daily if you \u201caren't always sure what causes your UTI\u201d; and Promote, a probiotic pill to restore good bacteria after a course of antibiotics, the usual treatment for a UTI (which is causing problems with growing antibiotic resistance). Target and Control contain d-mannose, a type of naturally-occurring sugar that has been shown in some trials to possibly reduce the chance of UTIs by binding to bacteria that cause them, often E. coli, and helping flush it out in the stream of urine. Target also contains vitamins and minerals, like Vitamin B6, meant to act as a diuretic, and Control contains other natural plant extracts that Uqora claims will help with UTIs, like curcumin (found in turmeric) and black pepper extracts. Each product costs $30 for a 30 day supply.\n\nUqora isn\u2019t alone in the medicine-via-Instagram market. Mail-order prescription drug services like Hers, Hims, and Roman flood the platform with ads, selling things like birth control, erectile dysfunction meds, and blood pressure drugs used to treat performance anxiety. These provide a younger, debt-laden audience with an easier way to get the drugs they believe they need, even if it ends up being with a questionable level of medical guidance.\n\nUnder the law and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations, dietary supplements that make certain claims about what their products do must include a disclaimer that the product is not intended to \"diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease,\" because \u201conly a drug can legally make such a claim,\u201d according to the FDA. Uqora is not a drug, nor has it been through the approval process that a drug would go through. And yet, there the claim is, in all their marketing materials: Uqora will prevent your next UTI.\n\nUqora\u2019s websites\u2014though not its ads\u2014include the standard legal disclaimer for dietary supplements at the very bottom of the page, that its \u201cstatements have not been evaluated by the FDA\u201d and the product \u201cis not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.\u201d This is weird, because I am pretty sure describing yourself as \u201cThe UTI Prevention Company,\u201d and claiming the product is \u201cUTI prevention that works,\u201d and that it will \u201cprevent your next UTI,\u201d are claims that the product will prevent disease.\n\nThe homepage of Uqora's website.\n\nThanks to a 1994 law introduced by Sen. Orrin Hatch, who represented the home state of many dietary supplement companies and took plenty of their money, manufacturers don\u2019t have to prove that a supplement is effective in the way that prescription drugs do. Companies only need to state their supplement products have not been tested by the FDA, essentially telling consumers that it\u2019s up to them to decide if the product works. Critics of the law describe this disclaimer as the \u201cquack Miranda warning\u201d\u2014a meaningless phrase invoked automatically to mask a range of unsupported medical claims.\n\nIn a statement, the FDA reiterated to me that \u201cproducts claiming to cure, treat, mitigate, or prevent diseases are drugs\u2014and are subject to all requirements that apply to drugs\u2014even if they are represented as \u2018dietary supplements,\u2019\u201d and added that while it wouldn\u2019t comment on Uqora specifically, the agency is \u201cauthorized to take action against violative products.\u201d\n\nWhen I asked Uqora about how it can make claims that are directly contradictory to the FDA disclaimer printed at the bottom of their site, co-founder Spencer Gordon told me that \u201cdietary supplements sit in sort of a gray area between two regulatory bodies, the FDA and the FTC,\u201d with \u201cthe FDA regulating product packaging and labeling, specifically, and the FTC regulating actual marketing claims.\u201d This means, he argued, \u201cas far as the FDA, our packaging doesn't say anything about prevent[ing] UTIs because that's not an approved FDA claim for the dietary ingredients inside the formula at this time.\u201d To clarify, I asked if he meant that because packaging itself doesn\u2019t make claims about preventing UTI, it doesn\u2019t matter that all the marketing materials do make that claim; Gordon said that was correct. Presumably, Orrin Hatch would be thrilled to hear that Uqora remains free to make contradictory claims under the law he authored.\n\nBut Gordon\u2019s understanding doesn\u2019t appear to be true: The FDA has sent many warning letters in the past to dietary supplement companies over online marketing, not just literal product packaging. In July, the FDA sent a warning letter to a company called Curaleaf for claims it made about its CBD products on its website, Facebook, and Twitter about being designed \u201cfor chronic pain\u201d and aimed at \u201creduc[ing] anxiety symptoms.\u201d Many other similar warning letters from the FDA cite website claims. The FTC does regulate marketing claims for supplements too, and neither the FDA nor FTC would comment on Uqora specifically, but even the logic of Gordon\u2019s argument is strained: How would a consumer even see the packaging and labeling of an online product before they purchased it?\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say that Uqora necessarily does nothing. One 2014 randomized controlled trial published in the World Journal of Urology tested the same dose of d-mannose that Target contains on 308 people, and did find that it \u201csignificantly reduced the risk of recurrent UTI.\u201d The UK\u2019s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence said in 2018 that this 2014 trial provided \u201chigh quality\u201d evidence for d-mannose\u2019s effectiveness, and suggested that non-pregnant people with vaginas with recurrent UTIs \u201cmay wish to try D-mannose, as a self-care treatment,\u201d but noted that the trial was \u201csmall.\u201d In 2018, the American Urogynecologic Society\u2019s Best Practice Statement for recurrent UTIs said there was \u201climited\u201d evidence for d-mannose\u2019s effectiveness. The same paper said there is \u201cinsufficient\u201d evidence to recommend the use of Vitamin C, another ingredient in Uqora\u2019s Target. As for curcumin, even a post on Uqora\u2019s own site says turmeric is only \u201crumored\u201d to prevent UTIs, and notes that \u201cwhether or not curcumin is effective at killing E. coli in humans is not certain, and requires more research.\u201d\n\nUqora keeps information sheets outlining the scientific basis for its claims that cite studies on the products\u2019 various ingredients, such as one that shows curcumin can break up infection-causing \u201cbiofilms.\u201d But there are no studies cited that demonstrate curcumin\u2019s effectiveness in treating UTIs. Chris D\u2019Adamo, the Director of Research at the Center for Integrative Medicine at the University of Maryland who has served as principal investigator on many studies of dietary supplements, said the evidence Uqora offered was \u201cpretty typical of the industry,\u201d and that while it was \u201cbetter than most companies,\u201d Uqora was nonetheless \u201cconnecting some dots that aren\u2019t really there.\u201d The studies merely establish the mechanism by which the ingredient might work to prevent UTIs, not that they actually do.\n\nDavid Seres, director of medical nutrition and associate professor of medicine at the Institute of Human Nutrition, Columbia University Medical Center, said that Uqora\u2019s arguments are \u201cnot medically credible without direct testing\u201d of the actual product to make a prevention claim. Uqora is conducting a clinical trial of its products, but the results won\u2019t start to become available until 2020; D\u2019Adamo noted that the \u201cstudy on their finished product would connect the dots and would be commendable.\u201d Until then, the products are still on sale, still making the same claims.\n\nUqora is hardly the worst offender in the dietary supplement industry. The law is set up to make it easy for companies to make claims that skirt the law, if not actively flout it, and the deluge of products making health and wellness claims online has shown that the FDA doesn\u2019t have the capacity to go after most cases. And the industry has worse problems than misleading claims: The FDA\u2019s own data shows that unapproved prescription drugs exist in 20 percent of dietary supplements. But the fact remains that Uqora is making a claim that it shouldn\u2019t be making, and there\u2019s a reason we\u2019re meant to have laws in place to regulate the strongest claims about treating and preventing diseases, which is that we can\u2019t trust companies to be responsible in making claims to sell products.
