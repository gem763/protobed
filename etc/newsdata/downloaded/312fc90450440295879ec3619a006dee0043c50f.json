The leader was BDP with five seats and UDC with three just before 6pm.\n\nThe Alliance for Progressives (AP) \u2013 which was formed after its leader and presidential candidate Ndaba Gaolathe left the UDC \u2013 had at the time won a National Assembly seat in Francistown South.\n\nA breakaway party from BDP \u2013 the Botswana Progressive Party (BPF) \u2013 was yet to score any seat.\n\nThe party was contesting in 19 constituencies with 18 of them based in Central District which is historically a BDP stronghold but includes Serowe areas where former president, Ian Khama, reins as Paramount Chief of Bangwato.\n\nKhama and his brother, Tshekedi Khama, followed each other out of the BDP which was co-founded by their father and Botswana\u2019s first president, Sir Seretse Khama, and joined the BPF.\n\nTshekedi was contesting for a parliamentary seat in Serowe.\n\nResults from many areas in their district were yet to be released to determine whether voters from Khama\u2019s area remained loyal to his father\u2019s party, BDP, or decided to vote and send candidates from his new party to parliament instead.", "description": "Botswana could wake up having a new president as vote counting continues amid a tight contest between the governing party leader, Mokgweetsi Masisi, and opposition leader, Duma Boko.", "authors": ["Poloko Tau"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9518/2b148accfcf8409c9f114cc4ae362166.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
