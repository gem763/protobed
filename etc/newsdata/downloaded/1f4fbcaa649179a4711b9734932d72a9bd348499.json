The larger Pixel 4 XL starts at $899. It'll be available in three colors: black, white, and a limited edition orange.\n\nThe new Motion Sense feature, powered by the company's Soli radar technology, makes it possible to dismiss a call just by waving your hand, or lower the volume of your morning alarm as you reach for your phone. Google also says it provides the fastest face unlock on a smartphone since it can start the verification process before you pick up your phone.\n\nThe Pixel 4 comes with a dual-lens camera that consists of a 12.2-megapixel lens and a 16-megapixel lens. It's noticeably lacking the third ultra-wide-angle lens found on other recent smartphones, like the iPhone 11 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S10.\n\nBut Google showcased the new software-based computational photography features coming in the Pixel 4, such as Live HDR+, which shows HDR+ adjustments in real-time in the camera viewfinder rather than after the photo is taken. Improvements to Night Sight make it possible to better capture images of stars in the night sky.\n\nThe Pixel 4 will come in two sizes: the 5.7 inch Pixel 4 and the 6.3-inch Pixel 4 XL. The display on both phones will support a refresh rate of up to 90Hz, which should make scrolling and navigating the phone feel more smooth.", "description": "Google announced the Pixel 4, a new Pixelbook, a new Nest Mini smart speaker, Pixel Buds, and much more during its event.", "authors": ["Lisa Eadicicco"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da5f579cc4a0a6ecb156168?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
