While the central bank is widely expected to deliver its third rate cut this year, traders are eager to find out if that would be the end of the easing cycle, or if more cuts are on the cards.\n\nThe Fed rate decision is due just hours after a report on U.S. third quarter GDP, which is expected to show that the economy grew 1.7% in the three month to September, slowing from 2% in the second quarter.\n\nThe pair rose 0.2% to 108.76.\n\nThe Bank of Japan is set to announce its latest policy decision on Thursday.
