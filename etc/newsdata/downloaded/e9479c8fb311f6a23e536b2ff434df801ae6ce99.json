And security experts cautioned that there could be many reasons for Monday\u2019s failure. North Korea could be pre-emptively taking its systems offline to prepare for an attack, some said.\n\nChris Nicholson, a spokesman for Akamai, an Internet content delivery company, said it was difficult to pinpoint the origin of the failure, given that the company typically sees only a trickle of Internet connectivity from North Korea. The country has only 1,024 official Internet protocol addresses, though the actual number may be a little higher. That is fewer than many city blocks in New York have. The United States, by comparison, has billions of addresses.\n\nBut when the sun rose in North Korea on Tuesday morning, the few connections to the outside world \u2014 available only to the elite, the military, and North Korea\u2019s prodigious propaganda machine \u2014 were still out.\n\nAs the morning wore on, however, some of the connections began to come back after a blackout of nearly 10 hours, though there was still very little traffic, according to CloudFlare, an Internet company in San Francisco.", "description": "While perhaps a coincidence, the failure, which lasted about 10 hours, began after President Obama said the U.S. would respond to an act of \u201ccybervandalism\u201d against Sony Pictures.", "authors": ["Nicole Perlroth", "David E.
