The 16-year-old Thunberg, a Swedish high school student, has rocked the world with her blunt denunciations of generations that have failed to slow climate change. The 81-year-old Fonda, who says she was moved reading about Thunberg, believes she can have her own impact.\n\nWhen Thunberg studied climate change, \u201cshe realized what was happening and that this was barreling at us like an engine,\u201d Fonda said. \u201cIt so traumatized her that she stopped speaking and eating. And when I read that it rocked me, because I knew that Greta had seen the truth. And the urgency came into my DNA the way it hadn\u2019t before.\u201d\n\n\u201cGreta said we have to behave like it\u2019s a crisis,\u201d Fonda added. \u201cWe have to behave like our houses are on fire.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nFonda has a distinguished acting career, including political films such as \u201cComing Home\u201d about Vietnam War wounds both mental and physical, \u201c9 to 5\u201d about working women, and \u201cThe China Syndrome\u201d about a nuclear power plant that was released shortly before the Three Mile Island nuclear accident.\n\nAD\n\nShe has history of political activism, too. She supported the Black Panthers and marched for the rights of Native Americans, soldiers and working mothers. In 1970, she went to Fort Meade to hand out antiwar pamphlets to soldiers, but was arrested before she was able to. In 1972, she went to North Vietnam and sat on an antiaircraft gun, earning the nickname \u201cHanoi Jane.\u201d She has repeatedly apologized for the photo and to veterans of the war. She has been active on women\u2019s issues.\n\nThis time Fonda is planning to go about things differently. Every Thursday evening, starting Oct. 17, there will be online teach-ins featuring climate scientists talking about different aspects of global warming. Fonda said she would like to \u201cdraw connections\u201d by discussing how violence against women increases in communities suffering from climate change.\n\nAD\n\nThen on Fridays, she will go to the steps of the Capitol building holding a placard and will refuse to obey three requests by the Capitol Police to cease and desist. She\u2019s not expecting a mass rally, more like a handful of people. This Friday\u2019s launch coincides with bigger protests scheduled worldwide.\n\nAD\n\nShe has invited some of her celebrity friends: Actor Ted Danson of \u201cCheers\u201d fame, who has become involved in ocean conservation; \u201cThe Vagina Monologues\u201d playwright Eve Ensler; and actresses Kyra Sedgwick and Catherine Keener.\n\nShe\u2019s reached out to leaders of Black Lives Matter and the Sunrise Movement. Ben Cohen, co-founder of Ben & Jerry\u2019s ice cream, will join the demonstrations, which will start at 11 a.m. Fridays on the side of the Capitol facing the Supreme Court.\n\nAD\n\nFonda said she also intends to make demands.\n\n\u201cThe number one thing is cutting all funding and permits for new developments for fossil fuel and exports and processing and refining,\u201d she said. She said that if efforts go into discouraging demand for oil and gas and coal, \u201cit\u2019s not going to do any good\u201d if companies are still developing prospects. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to make any difference,\u201d she said.\n\nAD\n\nFonda also wants to get out the vote, not only for presidential ballots but down to local government to make climate policy a litmus test.\n\nIt\u2019s not Fonda\u2019s first climate protest. In 2016, she spent Thanksgiving with protesters gathered in an effort to block an oil pipeline through land claimed by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in North Dakota. She has protested in Los Angeles, Vancouver and Seattle.\n\nAD\n\nKlein opens her book with an essay about Thunberg and her Asperger\u2019s syndrome. Fonda says it showed her that some people on the autism spectrum are \u201ctotally laser focused\u201d and \u201cinformation comes at them pure and direct.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s as simple as this. We have according to the [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] 12 years, but that was a year ago,\u201d Fonda says. \u201cSo according to their report we have 11 years left. Eleven years to do something that has never been done in human history. And if we don\u2019t do it, huge parts of the planet are going to be uninhabitable, by the way.\u201d\n\nFonda drives an electric car and has solar panels on her home. She\u2019s getting rid of plastics.\n\nAD\n\nBut she says she\u2019s \u201cnot quite vegan.\u201d And unlike Thunberg, who took a sailboat across the Atlantic to avoid using jet fuel, Fonda says she\u2019ll fly when she needs to. She has a speaking tour with her television co-star Lily Tomlin that requires taking planes. And she doesn\u2019t think climate activists should alienate potential activists who, for example, eat beef.\n\nAD\n\nDoes Fonda, who has a three-month old grandson, have a lesson from her earlier participation in political protests? She says, \u201cI feel far braver now than I did before. I\u2019ve got nothing to lose and this is it.\u201d\n\nFonda will mark her 82nd birthday on a December Friday, and she\u2019s planning on celebrating by getting arrested in Washington.\n\nAsked whether she could weather partisan attacks from President Trump or others, Fonda said, \u201cYou don\u2019t see it but I have armor around me. It\u2019s invisible but it\u2019s my special power like Greta and her Aspergers. I\u2019m 82 years old. There\u2019s nothing they can do. It doesn\u2019t matter what they do.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Film and television star to bring Thursday night teach-ins and \u201cFire Drill Fridays.\u201d", "authors": ["Steven Mufson", "Reporter Covering The Business Of Climate Change"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/n2PfwzuHjCtzMEx1uYIAqyJ3XWM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UJBVIBXLAII6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
