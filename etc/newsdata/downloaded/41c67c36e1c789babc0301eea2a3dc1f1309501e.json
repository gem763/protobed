CBD sellers at the event pointed to challenges around obtaining transparent payment services, mentioning high fees from other processors and a prior reliance on check payments.\n\nCBD is the non-psychoactive ingredient in the cannabis plant that is widely held to have wellness properties. Merchants were hoping that the substance would be approved as part of last year\u2019s Farm Bill, which legalized hemp. But CBD was not legalized because it is the main ingredient in the only cannabis-based drug to win approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, GW Pharmaceuticals PLC\u2019s GWPH, +4.69% Epidiolex, a treatment for severe forms of childhood epilepsy.\n\nThe FDA is working on a set of regulations for CBD but until they are ready, companies are not allowed to add it to food or drink and cannot make medical claims for topicals and other products. Massachusetts-based Curaleaf Holdings was sent an FDA warning letter in July for claiming CBD-based products would treat a range of serious diseases, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Unlike THC, the psychoactive ingredient in the cannabis plant, CBD has not been widely researched.\n\nSquare will charge CBD sellers 3.90% plus 10 cents per transaction for in-person tap, swipe, and dip payments. Online payments will cost 4.20% plus 30 cents per transaction. Sellers will also be able to access other Square business services, including payroll and inventory-management offerings.\n\nWhiteley said that Square\u2019s program was \u201cborn out of the compliance team\u201d and that Square worked with traditional credit-card partners that \u201chad the same questions\u201d on whether card processing for CBD merchants could be done responsibly. She explained that Square does due diligence on these customers to see whether they comply with federal regulations around labeling, marketing, and medical claims. Square specifies in a blog post on the matter that CBD products \u201cmust be hemp-derived and have less than 0.3% THC.\u201d\n\nIn response to a question about whether Square faces risk if its CBD-merchant customers don\u2019t adhere to the rules around sales and marketing of CBD products, Whiteley said it was \u201cgenerally on the sellers\u201d to make sure they comply with all laws and drew a parallel to food-service businesses that must also make sure they abide by all the rules governing their own industry.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re opening a restaurant, there are tens of thousands of laws that you have to comply with,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just decided to take the extra step to do enhanced due diligence but at the end of the day, sellers are responsible for their own compliance.\u201d\n\nWhiteley also told media attendees that Square\u2019s decision to open up processing for CBD merchants \u201cdoesn\u2019t per se open up any opportunities\u201d to support cannabis sellers or others in related areas due to a lack of clarity on regulations at the federal level.\n\nSquare shares are up 0.9% in Thursday trading. The stock has risen 8% so far this year, compared with a 16% climb for the S&P 500 SPX, +0.80%.", "description": "Square Inc. announced Thursday that it was officially opening up payment-processing capabilities to CBD sellers, after initially offering this service as...", "authors": ["Emily Bary"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GK997_Square_ZG_20180615113010.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
