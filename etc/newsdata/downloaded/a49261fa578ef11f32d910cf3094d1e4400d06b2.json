Add Interest\n\nGiuliani repeatedly urged Trump that the U.S. government should eject Fethullah Gulen from the country, a top priority of the Turkish president.\n\nThe former senior official told ABC News that White House officials stepped in and stopped any action from ever happening.\n\nAides told Giuliani he should tell the Turkish government that if they wanted this individual extradited they should directly contact the United States Department of Justice, which would evaluate the request, according to the source.\n\nThe Washington Post was first to report the story.\n\nGulen, a Muslim cleric, has been living in exile in Pennsylvania.\n\nErdogan has long accused Gulen of plotting a coup in 2016 against him, a charge that he denies. Bringing Gulen back to Turkey for punishment has been a top goal of Erdogan.\n\nIn a text exchange with The Post Tuesday afternoon, Giuliani declined to discuss whether he advocated for Gulen\u2019s extradition, writing: \u201ccan\u2019t comment on it that would be complete attorney client privilege but sounds wacky.\u201d\n\nWhen told that multiple people described those conversations to The Post, Giuliani responded \u201cBull,\u201d and then liked the question with a thumbs-up emoji.\n\nChris Post/AP\n\nMetin Topuz, a Turkish translator for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, is currently under trial in Turkey for alleged connections to Gulen's supposed coup attempt.\n\nTwo ex-business associates of Michael Flynn, Trump's former campaign adviser, were charged by the government with acting as foreign agents in a plot centered on smearing the Turkish cleric.\n\nU.S. Department of Justice attorneys alleged in December 2018 that the two business associates, Bijan Rafiekian and Kamil Ekim Alptekin, \"sought to discredit and delegitimize the Turkish citizen in the eyes of politicians and the public, and ultimately to secure the Turkish citizen\u2019s extradition.\"\n\nFlynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in December 2017 in connection with Robert Mueller's investigation into meddling in the 2016 campaign, and is scheduled for sentencing in December.\n\nDiplomatic relations between Turkey and the U.S. are currently highly strained over the former's decision to invade Syria and pursue Kurdish forces previously allied with America in the fight against the Islamic State. Trump issued a decision to pull troops out of northern Syria after a call with Erdogan last week, opening the door for the invasion.", "description": "In early 2017, Rudy Giuliani urged President Donald Trump to extradite a Turkish cleric living in the U.S., a former senior administration official confirmed to ABC News.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/rudy-giuliani-mo_hpMain_20191015-224027_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
