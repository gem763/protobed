Sour grapes, mostly.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s commentary and behavior are becoming more erratic, in ways that matter. On the economy, Trump has now personalized his trade war with China and amplified policies that are the political equivalent of a brat\u2019s temper-tantrum. He has also now branded the head of the Federal Reserve an \u201cenemy,\u201d ramping up his attacks on a central bank that refuses to politicize its policy for Trump\u2019s political gain.\n\nAfter a week of outbursts and more self-defeating tariffs, serious analysts are now questioning Trump\u2019s lucidity. \u201cThere\u2019s a growing sense that Trump is spinning out of control,\u201d Greg Valliere, chief strategist for AGF Investments, wrote to clients recently. \u201cThis is not normal behavior, especially for someone who holds the nuclear codes.\u201d Valliere, like others, has revived speculation about whether Trump can be removed under the 25th Amendment to the Constitution, which provides procedures for doing so. The outlook, for now: It would be tough.\n\nBut Trump is helping build the case. He Twitter-raged against China this week, raised tariffs yet again, and like a mad king declared, \u201cOur great American companies are hereby ordered to immediately start looking for an alternative to China.\u201d That single tweet drove the Dow Jones stock average down 400 points, or 1.5%.\n\nWhether Trump is losing his grip on reality or not, his trade war is becoming a costly quagmire, while he demonstrates the strategic agility of a log. For these reasons, the Trump-o-meter registers another poor grade this week: FAILING, the second-lowest.\n\nSource: Yahoo Finance More\n\nTrade may end up being Trump\u2019s undoing as president. On Aug. 23, China announced it was raising tariffs on $75 billion worth of U.S. imports, a highly expected tit-for-tat response to the new tariffs Trump imposed on Chinese imports earlier in the month.\n\nHow dare they!\n\nLater the same day, Trump raised his own tariffs on Chinese imports by five percentage points, effective September 1, October 1 and December 15 for various classes of products. \u201cWe don\u2019t need China,\u201d Trump sneered on Twitter. He also asked whether Fed Chair Jerome Powell is a bigger enemy than Chinese president Xi Jinping.\n\nTariff meltdown\n\nIt\u2019s all loony. The Fed chair is nobody\u2019s enemy, and Powell is more important to the stability of the U.S. economy than Trump will ever be. And Trump can\u2019t order U.S. companies out of any given country. All he can do is, well, what he\u2019s doing\u2014impose tariffs, raise costs for everybody and cause chaos.\n\nTrump\u2019s tariff meltdown may be explained by his growing anxiety over a slowing economy that threatens his reelection odds. In the space of just two days, Trump said he was considering a new tax cut to stimulate growth, then said we don\u2019t need a tax cut because the economy\u2019s so strong. That\u2019s the incoherence of a Tariff Man who thinks \u201ctrade wars \u2026 are easy to win\u201d and can\u2019t understand why the real economy and the stock market don\u2019t agree with him.\n\nThis all happened in the same week Trump declared himself the \u201cchosen one\u201d and endorsed a claim that he is \u201cKing of Israel.\u201d He enraged Jews everywhere by insisting they\u2019re disloyal to Israel if they support Democrats. Oh, and he snubbed the prime minister of Denmark\u2014ordinarily, a tight U.S. ally\u2014because she won\u2019t sell him Greenland. Maybe Trump will order her to do it.", "description": "As Trump fulminates against China, serious analysts are beginning to wonder if he's losing it.", "authors": ["Rick Newman", "Senior Columnist"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/uIudBj0ygfR8viIhh7ArGw--~B/aD0yMDcyO3c9MjAzNztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-08/e6db5570-babd-11e9-aeff-f477f9dfabdb", "published_at": "2019-08-23"}
