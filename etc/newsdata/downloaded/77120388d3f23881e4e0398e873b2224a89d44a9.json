United are 12th in the league, with nine points from eight games under Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r.\n\nDebt \u00a3511m but dividends galore: the Glazers\u2019 legacy at Manchester United | David Conn Read more\n\nMatt Judge, head of corporate development, is involved in the business side of recruitment and Woodward signs off all transfers, but Woodward defended the structure.\n\n\u201cThere is a myth that we have non\u2011football people making football decisions, and it\u2019s insulting to the brilliant people who work on the football side in this club,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of the senior staff on the football side of the club have been in their roles for over 10 years. Some of our scouts have worked with us for more than 25 years.\u201d\n\nJim Lawlor was appointed as chief scout in 2005 so has worked under Sir Alex Ferguson, David Moyes, Louis van Gaal and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho.\n\nWoodward admitted recruitment was not \u201cefficient\u201d when Ferguson stepped down in May 2013, forcing a long-term overhaul.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve expanded our recruitment department in recent years and we believe this now runs in an efficient and productive way,\u201d Woodward said. \u201cPlayer recommendations and decisions are worked on by this department and by the first-team manager and his staff, not by senior management.\u201d\n\nPrivately the hierarchy accept that Moyes had almost no chance of success because United retained the structure that had worked so productively for Ferguson, his predecessor. There is a further acknowledgment that the prevailing reason for the flatlining of the side and failure to challenge for the title in the six years since Ferguson left is errors in recruitment.\n\nFor example, Van Gaal\u2019s vision of a United player differed from the club\u2019s, resulting in a disjointed squad. Daley Blind is cited as a very fine footballer who did not possess the requisite X factor and so should not have been signed.\n\nWoodward admitted core values, too, had slipped. \u201cOle has also instilled the discipline back into an environment where we may have lacked it in recent years,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is building a squad that respects the club\u2019s history, in which players work hard and respect their teammates. No one is bigger than the club.\u201d\n\nIn the summer the 21-year-olds Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Daniel James were signed, as well as Harry Maguire, who is 27. Alexis S\u00e1nchez, 30, Chris Smalling, 29, Romelu Lukaku, 26, and Ander Herrera, 30, left or went on loan. Regarding S\u00e1nchez, who is on loan at Internazionale, the hierarchy have questioned whether the Chilean had the mentality to play for United.\n\n\u201cThe changes we saw over the summer have resulted in a very young squad,\u201d Woodward said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also a squad, with the players and the culture, that provides a base camp for us to build and grow from as we start our new journey. Ole\u2019s vision maps exactly to the core three football objectives we have: we must win trophies, we must play attacking football and we must give youth its chance.\u201d\n\nOle Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r needs more time and respect at Manchester United | Rob Smyth Read more\n\nSince Solskj\u00e6r was appointed permanent manager in late March United have won only five league games. Woodward pointed to 14 victories in 19 matches in all competitions when the Norwegian was caretaker as reason for optimism.\n\n\u201cThe middle section of last season, after Ole\u2019s arrival [in mid-December], feels most relevant to what we want to achieve and where we want to be,\u201d he said. \u201cWe saw a team playing fast, fluid football, with a clear representation of the style and philosophy the manager wants.\u201d\n\nWoodward denied that financial profit was more important than success to the Glazers, United\u2019s owners. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is the commercial side is never allowed to take priority over the football side. We are an incredible 141-year footballing institution with all that history, all that legacy, all that tradition and that tradition of success. That can never, ever change. We need to keep that protected.\n\n\u201cThen, like other football clubs, our commercial business allows us to reinvest in the football side. It\u2019s how these two interact with each other at Manchester United that results in us having a competitive advantage in this area.\u201d", "description": "Ed Woodward, the Manchester United chief executive, said \u2018non-experts\u2019 are not deciding their football policy", "authors": ["Jamie Jackson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26970a7d0478f6cd96f6833b92c3fc47f453286b/0_163_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=97afa20b0393d43e7daa17d1b2ee8f2d", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
