The lid smashed open and the kids jumped in [to his grave]. When lifting the coffin out it just fell to bits.\n\n\"We paid extra for a solid oak coffin with strong gold handles. We found out after that it was a replica MDF coffin that just shattered when it was dropped.\n\n\"Imagine that happening to your loved one. It is not private, 400 to 500 people were able to see him laid there.\u201d\n\nThe pallbearers responsible allegedly fled the scene leaving the couple's children to leap into the plot to recover Gavin's body.\n\nHeartbroken Debbie and her family rearranged Gavin\u2019s funeral, which was held for a second time in two days, using a different funeral director.\n\n(Image: Debbie Swales)\n\nBut for the mother-of-eight the damage had already been done. The memory of her husband had been tarnished and it is something she says she can never forgive Clark Pearson for.\n\n\"When I saw Gavin he just didn't look the same,\" she said. \"He had a cut across his face as a result of the coffin breaking. It has haunted me ever since.\n\n\"I can't get on with living my life because I've been grieving for so long. I've had no closure to this and it's just been terrible for us all.\n\n\"It is not just the fact they dropped him. Of course it was an accident. But who would run away? You would front up to what happened and not leave the family to jump into the grave.\n\n\u201cWe have been treated dreadfully ever since. I recall standing there and I cried and cried.\"\n\n(Image: Newcastle Chronicle)\n\nThe dad\u2019s ordeal started in 2013 when he was told he had a 9.5cm tumour in his right kidney. It was while undergoing pre-assessment tests that doctors discovered he was also battling leukaemia.\n\nBrother Frankie stepped in to donate his bone marrow and Gavin\u2019s health started to improve. But the dad\u2019s progress was halted when he got pneumonia.\n\nJust months after undergoing a second transplant, Gavin died - which crushed the family.\n\nDebbie, who also has six grandchildren, said: \"Gavin has left a massive gap in my life, my kids' lives. My husband was known as the gentle giant all his life. He was always there to help people.\n\n(Image: Gavin Swales)\n\n\"If I had one wish in the world it would be to bring him back.\n\n\"He idolised me, his children and grandchildren. He was a great man who has been robbed of his life, and I have been robbed of my time with him.\"\n\nSince the funeral, Debbie and her children have received counselling, with the grieving mum saying she is stuck in the past and unable to move on.\n\n\"The last four years have been hell,\" Debbie added.\n\n(Image: Newcastle Chronicle)\n\n\"I have had many sleepless nights. Every time I see Gavin I just see the image of him in a broken coffin with people running around chaotically and family members being left to get him out.\n\n\"Without my kids and grandkids I don't know what I would have done. Instead of grieving for my husband I have had to fight for four years for justice for my Gavin.\n\n\"I haven't been to another funeral since, not even my best friend's.\n\n\"The kids can't go to Gavin's grave because they have flashbacks.\"\n\nIn August, the family reluctantly accepted a settlement of \u00a3136,500 with the funeral directors. But a \u00a377,000 legal bill and other fees meant the Swales family ended up with around \u00a347,000.\n\n(Image: Newcastle Chronicle)\n\nTo this day Debbie claims to have never received an apology from Clark Pearson, which is still operating in Newcastle.\n\nDebbie said: \"It means after all we've been through me and my children have ended up with just over \u00a35,000 each. It\u2019s an absolute insult.\n\n\"All I've wanted is justice for my husband. It has not, and never will be, about the money. But my family has been through hell the past four years and Clark Pearson needed to realise what they have done to us.\n\n\u201cPeople say that time heals, but I don't feel any different now to what I did on the day of his funeral. I feel empty and I just can't be happy. I am always going to be carrying this sadness around for the rest of my life. I feel like half of me has gone.\n\n(Image: Newcastle Chronicle)\n\n\"Gavin didn't deserve any of this and I'm disgusted that it has taken so long.\"\n\nNewcastle City Council took no action against Clark Pearson for the incident. Instead, the authority confirmed they met with all funeral directors in the area to remind them of their roles and responsibilities as a result of the incident.\n\nA statement from Clark Pearson's solicitor said: \"Clark Pearson deeply regrets this unfortunate incident and the distress that was caused to the family.\n\n\"Settlement of the claims was agreed at mediation, so it would be inappropriate for Clark Pearson to comment any further.\"", "description": "Mum-of-eight Debbie Swales, 52, from South West Denton in Newcastle, and her family have received counselling after the horrific ordeal at the funeral of 'gentle giant' Gavin, 55", "authors": ["Kieran Murray", "Amber Hicks", "Image", "Newcastle Chronicle", "Debbie Swales", "Gavin Swales"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20572175.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Wife-of-man-whose-coffin-was-dropped.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
