And I mean enjoying this from the beginning, from day one, when one of our fine editors asked me to look at the brewing Ukraine scandal and my response was to LOL at how stupid it all is/was/will be forever.\n\nI\u2019m concerned that if we don\u2019t impeach this president, he will get re-elected. \u2014 Rep. Al Green (D-TX) on MSNBC\n\nCome on, this whole thing is super-lame, and the anticipation of awaiting its unraveling was almost as delicious as watching the unraveling.\n\nAnd I\u2019m no genius. I\u2019m no sage. My skills are no different than anyone else\u2019s. One of the things that makes humans human is our ability to recognize patterns. This unique skill of ours created the wheel, put a man on the moon, gave us the iPhone and Hogan\u2019s Heroes.\n\nSo, after all of this\u2026\n\nHispanic George Zimmerman: The White Racist Killer\n\nHands Up, Don\u2019t Shoot!\n\nTrump Can\u2019t Win\n\nBrett Kavanaugh: Serial Rapist\n\nThe KKKids from KKKovington High School\n\nTrump Colluded with Russia\n\nBrett Kavanugh: Serial Rapist Part Deux\n\n\u2026only a chimp with a learning disability could fail to recognize another yet-another *yawn* pattern pointing to a desperate conspiracy orchestrated by the Deep State, Democrats, and the media to take out the Bad Orange Man.\n\nAnd this one was truly desperate: poorly planned from the beginning, and so poorly executed that every one of the conspirators, especially Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo and Jake Tapper, MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow and Lawrence O\u2019Donnell, sound like used car salesman with one day left to hit their monthly quota.\n\nRush-rush-rush you gotta impeach now-now-now or you don\u2019t get the free undercoating!\n\nAnyway, the whole thing is now unraveling, and here\u2019s why:\n\nSchiff Busted Lying, Conspiring, Being Even More Pencil Neckier Than Usual\n\nSchiff getting caught lying about his contacts with this phony Deep State \u201cwhistleblower\u201d is the least surprising thing about any of this. Of course he was working with the fake whistleblower to fabricate this non-scandal. Of course he lied about it. Of course other Democrats were involved. Of course the establishment media were in on it.\n\nWe have not spoken directly with the whistleblower. We would like to. But I\u2019m sure the whistleblower has concerns that he has not been advised, as the law requires, by the Inspector General or the Director of National Intelligence just as to how he is to communicate with Congress. \u2013 \u2013 Rep. Adam Schiff to MSNBC\u2019s Sam Stein Schiff did appear to lie here in previously saying that his office had not spoken directly with the whistleblower. But if you care more about this stuff than the actual substance of the whistleblower complaint than you\u2019re being a hack. \u2014 Real Journalist Sam Stein\u2019s tweet after it was revealed Schiff did indeed work with the \u201cwhistleblower,\u201d which is a clear violation of the whistleblower statute.\n\nFor reasons no one should have to explain, the whistleblower rules make it painfully clear you keep the politicians out of this process. But Schiff was brought in early so the complaint would be a bulletproof roadmap for an impeachment hearing.\n\nHearsay, Hearsay, Hearsay\n\nEveryone is arguing the whistleblower\u2019s complaint is weak because it is all based on second and third-hand information. No, this is exactly wrong.\n\nThat was The Plan.\n\nThat was always The Plan.\n\nSchiff, the media, and the Deep State deliberately went this route because it means witnesses hauled before an impeachment inquiry are immediately put on defense, have to prove a negative, have to prove they did not do or say something without meeting their accuser \u2014 the whistleblower.\n\nThis is already backfiring, though, because of the things the phony whistleblower got wrong \u2014 like who was on the call with Trump and what exactly was said. And this is all thanks to reporting from new media and Trump out-maneuvering his enemies by releasing the transcript of the call in question and the full whistleblower complaint.\n\nDeep State Changed Whistleblower Rules to Get Drumpf\n\nOddly enough, until recently, a whistleblower complaint required first-hand as opposed to second and third-hand knowledge.\n\nGee, wonder why those rules were suddenly changed\u2026?\n\nQuid Pro Ah, No\n\nThe phony whistleblower told us Trump would threaten Ukraine with the withholding of crucial U.S. aid unless Ukraine agreed to help him politically \u2014 which, oddly enough, is exactly what Joe Biden did.\n\nInstead, as the transcript of the phone call proves, it was Ukraine\u2019s president who brought up the issue of corruption and all Trump did was ask him to look into Biden\u2019s threat to withhold U.S. aid if Ukraine refused to fire a prosecutor who was digging into the energy company that hired Biden\u2019s son Hunter for $50,000 a month \u2014 a month! \u2014 even though Hunter knows nothing about Ukraine or energy.\n\nQuid Pro Uh, Oh\n\nIt gets worse! When the call took place, Ukraine was still fully expecting the U.S. to keep sending aid. Even the far-left BuzzFeed has been forced to admit this.\n\nHow can there be a threat or quid pro quo when Ukraine thought it was still raining American dollars?\n\nThere can\u2019t be, so the whistleblower lied.\n\nAustralia, Australia, Australia\n\nThe media recycling an old nothingburger into a BOMBSHELL made it pretty obvious the Ukraine Hoax was already running on fumes just a few days after it launched.\n\nThe Cover Up and the Secret Server!\n\nDid you hear that Drumpf \u2014 whom the walls are closing in on \u2014 tried to hide his call with Ukraine on a secret server so that he could cover up all his threats and quid pro quodom?\n\nNot to keep tooting my own horn, but *toot* I toldja we\u2019d find out Obama used the same \u201csecret server\u201d and \u2026 lo and behold.\n\nVictim Says He Was Not Victimized\n\nWe\u2019re told that the victim in all of this is Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who was threatened, strong-armed, and blackmailed by Drumpf.\n\nOnly the transcript of the phone call says that didn\u2019t happen, and\u2026\n\nSo does the victim.\n\nBiden Lies and Lies and Lies and then Lies Again\n\nWhat the Deep State, the media, and Democrats saw in this whole debacle was a two-fer: 1) get Drumpf and 2) save Biden from the brewing Ukraine scandal involving his rent-seeking son Hunter.\n\nWell, we already know part one has imploded, but somehow part two has imploded even more.\n\nAll this failed coup attempt has done is to put a glaring spotlight on Joe and Hunter and Hunter\u2019s $50,000 a month \u2014 a month! \u2014 salary to sit on the board of a company he knows nothing about in a country he knows nothing about.\n\nAnd then there is The Video of Dumb Daddy bragging about his successful quid pro quo, his threat to withhold aid from Ukraine if a prosecutor investigating his son\u2019s company was not fired.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s this 2014 bombshell photograph of then-Vice President Joe golfing with Hunter and a board member of the Ukraine company that hired Hunter for $50,000 a month \u2014 a month! \u2014 even though Joe assured us just last month he had never-ever-ever-ever \u201cspoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.\u201d\n\nTalk about a backfire.\n\nOh, My \u2014 Look at All the Fake News\n\nJust like with the Russia Collusion Hoax, the fake media are using fake news to cover up the fact that this is all a lie, a con, a hoax, a grift\u2026\n\nOn top of that hilariously desperate Australia, Australia, Australia thing, there was ABC News lying about an adviser to Ukraine\u2019s president saying the \u201cBiden Issue\u201d was a \u201cprecondition\u201d to any phone calls with Trump.\n\nWell, except for the fact that there was no precondition and the source was not an adviser, great work ABC!\n\nAnd then the far-left Washington Post reported that Trump\u2019s acting Director of National Intelligence threatened to resign over all of this.\n\nWell, except for the fact he didn\u2019t, great work Washington Post!\n\nJake Tapper Revs Up His Hoax Machine\n\nWatching Jake Tapper melt down and scream lies at Trump supporters is always a dead giveaway that the hoax is unraveling.\n\nTHE UKRAINIAN PROSECUTOR WAS NOT INVESTIGATING HUNTER BIDEN\u2019S COMPANY WHEN MY PRECIOUS JOE BIDEN GOT HIM FIRED!!!!\n\nWell, except for the fact that this same prosecutor signed an affidavit under penalty of perjury saying he was investigating Hunter Biden\u2019s company when your precious Joe got him fired, great work Jakester!\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.
