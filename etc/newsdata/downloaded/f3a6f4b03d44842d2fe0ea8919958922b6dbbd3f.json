In Judy, what we see is culmination of everything that happened to Garland behind the scenes of her illustrious career, including the horror inflicted on her by greedy studios and the self-destructive behavior that followed.\n\nWhile Ren\u00e9e Zellweger presents the Hollywood icon\u2019s struggle with great care, it\u2019s the way that she reckons with Garland\u2019s star power that makes the performance award-worthy. Zellweger captures Garland\u2019s miraculous natural talent \u2014 she was a one-woman orchestra whether she was playing a sold-out concert hall or the girl next door.\n\nOz was only the beginning for Garland, whose career included Technicolor musicals, contemplative black-and-white dramas, meta musical numbers, and recurring collaborations with the likes of Mickey Rooney, Gene Kelly, and director Vincente Minnelli. On the occasion of Judy\u2019s release, here are 15 definitive roles from across Garland\u2019s filmography.\n\nPigskin Parade (1936)\n\nIt all started with a football movie: Garland made her feature debut as a scene-stealer with colossal talent in Pigskin Parade, a football-based lark about a hillbilly star quarterback; Garland plays his little sister, who joins him on his ride to college prominence. In the last of her three music sequences, she provides pregame entertainment with the rousing ballad \u201cIt\u2019s Love I\u2019m After,\u201d and the way she holds that first open vowel in the title lyric proclaims a voice that\u2019s mature beyond her years. Even at 14, Garland was already captivating audiences with her full-throated singing and outstretched arms.\n\nThe Wizard of Oz (1939)\n\nThe Wizard of Oz has long held the imagination of moviegoers since its release, with Garland acting in her first feature lead role as Dorothy, a surrogate into the wonders of author Frank L. Baum\u2019s world. But lingering longer than the film\u2019s dreaminess is its sense of humanity, which comes directly from Garland\u2019s profound innocence and curiosity. It\u2019s a stunning display of empathy within Garland\u2019s girl-next-door persona \u2014 she hangs on every worried word from her new friends, and urgently wants to help. Garland embodies one of the film\u2019s most famous quotes: \u201cA heart is not judged by how much love, but by how much you are loved by others.\u201d The performance is all the more impactful, and tragic, given the abusive environment behind the scenes (detailed powerfully in flashbacks in Judy), with The Wizard of Oz inspired by a degree of tenderness that was not afforded Garland in real life.\n\nPresenting Lily Mars (1943)\n\nAnyone who wants to see an especially high-energy Garland show off her silly side should seek out Presenting Lily Mars, which has her playing an underdog actor fumbling to get the attention of curmudgeonly play producer John Thornway (Van Heflin). In this bouncy performance, a blonde Garland shows off her comic fearlessness and is particularly funny when overacting a monologue from Macbeth, or dashing around a party in high heels, chased by an angry Thornway. On two occasions, her character finds herself randomly in front of an orchestra, and in one highlight performs \u201cWhen I Look at You\u201d with an array of gauche accents, but a bigness that\u2019s all Garland.\n\nGirl Crazy (1943)\n\nFor all of her onscreen moments, only once did Garland introduce herself by emerging from under a car chassis, in Girl Crazy, voluminous curls and all. This out West college comedy would mark the final time she\u2019d be paired onscreen with Mickey Rooney (after three Andy Hardy movies, Babes in Arms, and more), but Garland is once again the main event, especially as she puts her own touch on George and Ira Gershwin classics like \u201cEmbraceable You\u201d and \u201cI Got Rhythm.\u201d Rooney plays Danny, an insatiable playboy who settles his gaze on Garland\u2019s incredibly charismatic Ginger Gray \u2014 not only is she the local postmistress who can fix her own car, she\u2019s also one of the few women around. Along with her entrance, Girl Crazy has other delightful moments of Garland kookiness, like the dry comedy-musical number \u201cBidin\u2019 My Time.\u201d Seemingly liberated by her self-amusement, a guitar-carrying Garland sings and saunters with a few other drowsy cowboys, sneaking in different funny faces that culminate in a big smile, and then a wink.\n\nMeet Me in St. Louis (1944)\n\nGarland is but another bright color in the Technicolor palette of Vincente Minnelli\u2019s period classic Meet Me in St. Louis, but she\u2019s at the center of the film\u2019s best moments, performing the now-classic tunes \u201cThe Trolley Song\u201d and \u201cHave Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.\u201d She even gets away with one of the film\u2019s cheesiest lines \u2014 \u201cOh no, John. I don\u2019t hate you. I just hate basketball!\u201d \u2014 legitimizing it within her character\u2019s undeniably wholesome emotional palette. Her best moment is the opening ballad \u201cThe Boy Next Door,\u201d a fitting number for Garland playing yet another girl next door, but injected with a grandiose sense of longing.\n\nZiegfeld Follies (1945)\n\nBefore taking on the reflective characters in later films A Star Is Born and I Could Go on Singing, Garland addressed her star power with an appearance in Ziegfeld Follies, playing a woman billed as The Star. In her flawless ten-minute sequence (titled \u201cA Great Lady Has an Interview\u201d), Garland toys with an uppity accent and a sarcastic self-importance, embodying the type of movie star that was alien from her own persona. Garland talk-sings through musings about her career, including her screen potential: \u201cI\u2019d like to be pin-up girl, a cheesecake girl too / and what is Ginger Rodgers that I am not?\u201d In a mint-green gown, she\u2019s a true Hollywood queen who seemingly hypnotizes the male reporters that circle her, and glides around them while using an Oscar as a prop. The self-referential winking gives the sequence an irresistible playfulness, as if Garland was finally getting ahead of the machine that long controlled her image.\n\nThe Clock (1945)\n\nFor her first nonmusical role, Garland displayed the grounded side of being an empathetic girl next door in this two-hander directed by Vincente Minnelli. She stars opposite Robert Walker in this New York romance, where his anxious soldier on leave, Joe, bumps into Garland\u2019s Alice at a train station and convinces her to show him around the city. Soon after, he asks her to marry him before he goes back to war. Garland\u2019s function is often to merely soothe Walker\u2019s inner turmoil, but she comes out as the more nuanced performer, especially with a painful, wordless moment of silence for their ill-fated attempt at marital bliss. The bittersweet undertone in The Clock is thanks to Garland, who reveals the vulnerability of a character that could easily be one-dimensional.\n\nThe Harvey Girls (1946)\n\nGarland played an Ohioan who joins a team of waitresses in Arizona in the Technicolor Western-comedy The Harvey Girls, which won an Oscar for the now classic tune \u201cAtchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe.\u201d The film places Garland at the center of some comic gems, including a sequence where she tries to rob a saloon, even though she keeps fumbling with two guns and is still wearing her waitress apron. The Harvey Girls also has the not-too-common spectacle of Garland sharing big scenes with other leading women, as with the gorgeous trio \u201cIt\u2019s a Great Big World\u201d with Virginia O\u2019Brien and Cyd Charisse, or a main plotline that has her going up against the leader of the enemy \u201cdance-hall girls,\u201d played by Angela Lansbury. Even in the musical\u2019s token romance, in which Garland is paired up with the particularly drab John Hodiak, Garland mines the contrived connection with flashes of sadness and regret, before taking us back into the sunny delights of this underrated romp.\n\nThe Pirate (1946)\n\nIn what\u2019s far and away the silliest of the three musicals they made together, Judy Garland and Gene Kelly pulled some gaudy magic out of The Pirate, a Caribbean adventure with Cole Porter songs, directed by Minnelli. The movie is largely steered by Kelly\u2019s vivacity and silliness, playing an obnoxious actor named Serafin who hypnotizes Garland\u2019s Manuela, and pretends to be the fugitive pirate that she adores. Garland eventually gets the upper hand when she finds out the actor\u2019s true identity, and the two practically try to out-ham each other in a scene where an angry Garland tries to smash every vase in the room over Kelly\u2019s head. Their best moment comes at the very end with the slap-happy song \u201cBe a Clown,\u201d with Garland kicking up her heels in clown makeup. The film is essentially a disaster, but Garland\u2019s work has a hammy enthusiasm that\u2019s tough to beat.\n\nEaster Parade (1948)\n\nEaster Parade is one of Garland\u2019s more grandiose MGM musicals, featuring her only onscreen collaboration with Fred Astaire. The two have infectious fun with its ridiculous premise \u2014 Astaire\u2019s Broadway fixture Don Hewes thinks he can make anyone into a star, and is lucky to stumble upon Garland\u2019s Hannah Brown. As they build their act, they shine with catchy gems like \u201cSnookey Ookums,\u201d and charm in raggedy clothes and dirty, smiley faces in \u201cA Couple of Swells.\u201d Hannah upgrades their relationship from dance partners to lovers when she sings \u201cIt Only Happens When I Dance With You\u201d to Astaire. It\u2019s a top-notch ballad, delivered poignantly in Garland\u2019s sensitive performance, as she resists eye contact with Astaire\u2019s loving gaze until the final measure.\n\nSummer Stock (1950)\n\nThe most iconic aspect of Summer Stock arrives at the end \u2014 a rendition of \u201cCome On, Get Happy\u201d performed by Garland in a tuxedo, a slanted fedora, and salacious black nylons. But before that, Garland doles out her charisma as a farmer with a penchant for song-and-dance, like in the musical number \u201cHowdy, Neighbor (Happy Harvest),\u201d which has Garland singing her heart out while driving a tractor. When Gene Kelly\u2019s theater director comes to her barn with his troupe, Summer Stock unlocks the chance for a spontaneous tap-dance duet between Kelly and Garland, \u201cThe Portland Fancy.\u201d The two keep the movie light on its feet, especially with its sunny culture clash of theater kids being thrown into farm life. Garland is a constant delight, especially with the wistful ballad \u201cFriendly Star,\u201d which is snuck in between Kelly\u2019s more bombastic numbers.\n\nA Star Is Born (1954)\n\nAfter a four-year hiatus, Garland returned to the silver screen at full force in George Cukor\u2019s remake of A Star Is Born. Her role as Esther Blodgett, a star with \u201cthat little something extra\u201d reaching Hollywood prominence after getting support from actor Norman Maine (James Mason), is a pure celebration of Garland\u2019s gifts; massive, intricate show numbers like \u201cBorn in a Trunk\u201d and \u201cSwanee\u201d pulse with her innate energy. The story\u2019s emphasis on contrasting authentic talent with the phoniness of Hollywood allowed Garland to shrug off the unabashed schmaltz of her earlier work. The film has everything viewers loved most about Garland, while providing her more of a chance to bare the complicated soul behind behind the master entertainer.\n\nJudgment at Nuremberg (1961)\n\nShe was only onscreen for approximately 18 minutes, and yet Garland is one of the most memorable characters of the powerhouse cast in Stanley Kramer\u2019s three-hour Judgment at Nuremberg. Garland plays a German woman named Irene Hoffman, who is brought to the post\u2013World War II military tribunal to testify in a miscegenation case involving an elderly Jewish man during Nazi-era Germany. She begins her testimony stoically, but she\u2019s progressively broken down during her two trips to the stand. In her last scene, Garland radiates sadness and fear \u2014 her answers carefully doled out while being cross-examined by a comparatively over-the-top defense attorney played by Maximilian Schell. Schell won an Oscar for the role, and Garland was nominated, with even her brief screen time proving her potency as a dramatic actress. Hollywood missed an opportunity in not casting her in similar roles.\n\nA Child Is Waiting (1963)\n\nGarland gave one her most somber performances in John Cassavetes\u2019s A Child Is Waiting as a concert pianist who starts working at a school for mentally challenged children. After failing to help one boy named Reuben (whose mother is played by Gena Rowlands, in a standout scene), she\u2019s persuaded by the headmaster (Burt Lancaster) to use her skills to lead a musical. Toward the end of the film, she guides the children in a singalong, playing the melody note by note, her fingers forcefully pressing each piano key, accompanied by an urgency in her voice. A Child Is Waiting is by no means a musical, but it includes one of the greatest examples of Garland\u2019s alternating delicacy and forcefulness performing any scene or song.\n\nI Could Go on Singing (1963)\n\nGarland\u2019s last film role was a meta sendoff, the character of Jenny Bowman being not so different from her: a popular singer and actor playing sold-out shows in London, but whose emotional emptiness renders her vulnerable offstage. In the movie (the time period in which Judy is set), Bowman tries to gain some autonomy and reconnect with her estranged son in London. Despite her drug and alcohol use, when she is onstage, she dominates with bombastic, perfect musical numbers. This is a performance built from the raw parts of Garland\u2019s charisma while offering a less-bleak look at Garland\u2019s true strife. In musical numbers like \u201cHello Bluebird\u201d and especially the grand finale, \u201cBy Myself,\u201d her voice defies her character\u2019s pain in a way that\u2019s equally gorgeous and heartbreaking. She appears onstage \u2014 on the last occasion, dangerously late \u2014 gives the crowd every note she\u2019s got inside of her, and then returns to a life far less rosy than her songs would suggest.", "description": "Oz was only the beginning for Garland, whose career included Technicolor musicals, contemplative black and white dramas, meta musical numbers, and recurring collaborations with the likes of Mickey Rooney, Gene Kelly, and director Vincente Minnelli.", "authors": ["Nick Allen"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/26/26-judy-garland-list.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
