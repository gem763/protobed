The shoes were designed by Brooklyn-based creative arts company MSCHF and they come with holy water in the soles.\n\nMSCHF bought a normal pair of Nike Air Max 97 sneakers at market value, the company's head of commerce, Daniel Greenberg, confirmed to CBS News. A plain pair of men's Air Max 97s go for about $160, but MSCHF completely revamped the shoe and added a golden Jesus on a crucifix as a shoelace charm.\n\nMSCHF also sourced holy water from the River Jordan, which was blessed by a priest in Brooklyn and added it to the soles of the sneaker.\n\nThe new \"Jesus Shoes\" went on sale for $1,425 Tuesday and sold for that price within a minute, Greenberg said. The buyer has now listed the sneaker on the resale website StockX for $4,000.\n\nMSCHF claims they sourced holy water from the River Jordan and had it blessed by a priest in Brooklyn. MSCHF\n\nGreenberg said the company does not personally know the buyer of the Jesus Shoe, but they are aware that person listed the sneaker on StockX.\n\nMSCHF is a \"a counter-culture media/product brand, playing in a gray area that isn't yet defined by traditional approaches,\" Greenberg said. The company's objective is to drop a new project every second and fourth Tuesday of the month.\n\nPast projects include \"Times Newer Roman,\" a new font that is the classic Times New Roman, only each letter is 5 to 10 percent bigger \u2013 making it easier for students to fill up the pages of their term papers.\n\nThe company also created an internet plug-in that makes Wikipedia pages look like real sources \u2014 another cheat method for those who are still writing papers in school.\n\nThe Jesus Shoe, however, is possibly MSCHF's most viral creation \u2014 and it received both positive and negative feedback. Greenberg says the shoes were designed as a response to ridiculous brand collaborations, such as Arizona Iced Tea and Adidas.\n\n\"We set out to take that to the next level,\" Greenberg said. \"We asked ourselves, 'What would a shoe collab with Jesus look like?' Obviously, it should let you walk on water. 'Well, how can we do that?' You pump holy water into the pocket of a pair of Air Max 97's and with that, you get Jesus Shoes \u2014 the holiest collab ever.\"", "description": "The lucky owner can now literally walk on water", "authors": ["Caitlin O'Kane"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/10/c10e71d7-8f32-4485-bf8d-8666e04005a1/thumbnail/1200x630/104310b882aeea87123e5606bc31576b/screen-shot-2019-10-10-at-3-05-25-pm.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
