Unfortunately my mother had passed away a couple of months before we found out my partner was pregnant and it was very much a case of one going out and one coming in. I had a catalyst of dealing with a death and then obviously a child coming into the world.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always thought there is a stigma around a father having to be there 'to be the rock' for the partner. Sometimes men can crumble just as much as anyone else. That\u2019s why I really champion the fact that mental health is being talking about in a much wider spectrum and there is a no longer a stigma that men have to be silent.\n\n\u201cIn my own situation it was really difficult. I remember being curled up in a ball on the sofa. I wasn\u2019t able to move because of the anxiety being that high. The panic attacks were coming in three or four times a day. And at one stage my partner didn\u2019t even know if I was going to be at the birth because it was that bad.\n\n\u201cEveryone has friends. Everyone has people they can open up to about their feelings. But, I believe firmly that even though talking helps, it\u2019s the guidance you need through mental health that will help you deal with the circumstances and understand what is happening within your body.\"", "description": "BBC Radio 5 Live's Nihal Arthanayake programme hears from dads.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p07l6bbw.jpg"}
