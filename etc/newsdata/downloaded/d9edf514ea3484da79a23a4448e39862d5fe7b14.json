What is needed now is appropriate and adequate support for all affected.'\n\nAndy Waters has fathered up to 110 children after donating his sperm, several of whom have tracked him down through ancestry websites.\n\nTwo children have found him in the past year, and he recently met up with a son, who traced him using AncestryDNA.\n\n'The genie is out of the bottle,' the 54-year-old, from Hemel Hempstead, told the BBC. 'Donor anonymity is dead.\n\n'Because of these websites, it no longer matters whether you as an individual choose to join in. If your relatives do, genetic matches to you can be identified.'\n\nMr Waters started donating sperm as a 19-year-old student. He went on to raise two children of his own.\n\nIt made him consider how important it may be for his children to contact him - and he has now put his details on the donor-conceived register so that his other children could find him if they wanted to.\n\nHe said: 'It is time to tell our kids where they come from, before they find out themselves, and hate us for it. The later we leave it, the more distress and anger it causes.'\n\nThe HFEA told BBC Radio 5 Live it had seen a 200 per increase in the number of people requesting information on their biological parents since 2010.\n\nARE SPERM AND EGG DONORS ANONYMOUS? If a person donated after 1 April 2005, children conceived from those eggs or sperm will be able to find out who they are biologically related to when they reach 16 and 18 years of age. The donor will have to provide information at the time of your donation. Anyone conceived from a donation at a clinic licensed by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority between 1 August 1991 and 31 March 2005 has a legal right to find out about their genetic origins. They can\u2019t, however, get any information that would identify the donor, such as their name or address. At 16 years of age, they can find out information such as their donors occupation, religion, ethnicity and basic description.\n\nBecause of this, the HFEA has made it possible for donors to remove their anonymity from its register.\n\nIt is also asking clinics to highlight the risks of being found through ancestry websites and DNA kits to donors.\n\nSally Cheshire, chair of the HFEA, said: 'The recent rise in the number of people using DNA testing websites to trace their ancestry means that more people may inadvertently find out that they were conceived through a donor.\n\n'We are talking to these companies about making sure they provide clear information on their websites about the potential risks of using their DNA matching services and that they signpost their users to appropriate support.'\n\nA survey in June this year revealed a third of people conceived using a sperm or egg donor are discovering the truth from DNA-testing websites.\n\nSupport group We Are Donor Conceived, which surveyed 312 people, found that 37 per cent found out after using a genealogy site.\n\nBy the start of 2019, more than 26million consumers had added their DNA to four leading commercial ancestry and health databases, according to estimates by MIT Technology.\n\nMore than 4million people in Britain are believed to be signed up and about 3,500 children a year are born from donated sperm and eggs.\n\nFrom 2023, due to the 2005 law change, those who turn 18 will be able to find out the name and recent address of their donor-parent.\n\nMailOnline have contacted AncestryDNA for comment.\n\nIt has previously said in a statement: 'We take our responsibility towards our customers \u2013 and the potential impact of complex discoveries \u2013 very seriously.\n\n'Ancestry works hard to help our customers understand that some of what they learn about themselves might be unexpected.'", "description": "The UK health fertility regulator have suggested waiving anonymity to save emotional stress as a growing number of people are reaching out to their biological parents with the use of DNA tests.", "authors": ["Vanessa Chalmers Health Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/10/20320138-0-image-a-3_1572345231147.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
