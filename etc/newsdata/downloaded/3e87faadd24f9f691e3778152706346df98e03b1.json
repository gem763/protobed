And that's not just bad for the Democratic Party \u2014 that's terrible for America,\" Bennet said.\n\nBennet also responded to a question about the whistleblower complaint alleging that President Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Joe Biden and his son. He called Mr. Trump a \"grifter\" and accused him of \"extorting\" Ukraine.\n\n\"I think he feels completely unconstrained by the rule of law,\" said Bennet. \"The president takes the view that whatever he can get away with is what's appropriate.\"\n\nBennet spoke with Garrett on Tuesday, a few hours before Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the launch of a formal impeachment inquiry. It was also recorded before the White House released a summary of the call with Zelensky, before the whistleblower complaint was made public, and before acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified before the House and Senate Intelligence Committees about the complaint.\n\nWhen asked by Garrett whether he supported opening a formal impeachment inquiry into the president, Bennet said he hasn't decided yet.\n\n\"I haven't made up my mind on anything. I'd like to see the report,\" Bennet said, referring to the complaint. Bennet told MSNBC later on Tuesday evening that the House was \"right\" to open an impeachment inquiry.\n\nBennet also hit back at Mr. Trump for calling Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, corrupt.\n\n\"He's a grifter,\" Bennet said. \"This is his pattern of approaching things like this, and it's to obscure the truth, to lie about it, and then to point in another direction.\"\n\nFor more of Major's conversation with Michael Bennet, download \"The Takeout\" podcast on iTunes, GooglePlay, Spotify and Stitcher.
