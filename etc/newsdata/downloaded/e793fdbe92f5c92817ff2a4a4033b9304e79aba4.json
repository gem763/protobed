A reading below 50 indicates contraction.\n\nWith lingering trade tensions weighing on exports, the U.S. data mirrored similar patterns in the euro zone, Japan, the United Kingdom and China.\n\nThe S&P industrials index .SPLRCI dropped 2.4%, the most among the 11 major S&P sectors. The materials .SPLRC and energy .SPNY indexes both fell 2.3%. All 11 sectors lost ground.\n\nA jobs report on Friday is expected to shed further light on U.S. economic strength.\n\n\u201cThis is a bad number, fitting in with the world\u2019s manufacturing recession,\u201d Jim Bianco, head of Bianco Research in Chicago, said of the ISM report. \u201cI think the market is right to be concerned, but we will have to see whether other manufacturing numbers in the U.S. bear that out, not the least of which being the manufacturing payroll numbers on Friday.\u201d\n\nDespite a prolonged U.S.-China trade war that has hammered global growth, confidence in the domestic economy has helped the benchmark S&P 500 .SPX climb about 17% this year.\n\nThomas Simons, a Jefferies economist, said the manufacturing contraction does not underpin a wider softening in the U.S. economy, as it was the result of several factors, including Boeing Co\u2019s (BA.N) production issues relating to its best-selling jets.\n\n\u201cManufacturing itself is in a recession, but it does not mean that the overall economy is in a recession.\u201d\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 1.28% to end at 26,573.04, while the S&P 500 .SPX lost 1.23% to 2,940.25. Both indexes had their biggest one-day dip since Aug. 23, when U.S. President Donald Trump demanded that American companies seek alternatives to doing business with China.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 1.13% to end at 7,908.69.\n\nThe Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX .VIX, an options-based gauge of investor anxiety, rose 2.3 points to 18.56, its highest close in about a month.\n\nShares of online brokerage E*Trade Financial (ETFC.O) tumbled 16.4%, the most on the S&P 500, after rival Charles Schwab Corp (SCHW.N) said it would remove commissions for online trading of stocks, ETFs and options listed on U.S. or Canadian exchanges. Charles Schwab\u2019s shares slumped 9.7%.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s Corp (MCD.N) dropped 2.7% after JP Morgan said the fast food chain\u2019s third-quarter same-store sales would be softer than analysts\u2019 estimates.\n\nShares of chipmaker Xilinx Inc (XLNX.O) declined 4.1% after KeyBanc lowered its rating to \u201csector weight.\u201d\n\nIn one of the few bright spots, Ulta Beauty Inc (ULTA.O) advanced 6.1% after an independent director bought shares.\n\nStitch Fix (SFIX.O) rose 1% in extended trade after the apparel seller\u2019s quarterly earnings per share beat analysts\u2019 estimates.\n\nAs the final quarter of 2019 kicks off, investors will be focusing on a range of factors, beginning with the high-stakes Sino-U.S. trade talks in early October, corporate earnings and the Fed\u2019s next policy meeting.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., September 23, 2019.
