She was 84.\n\nMonty Python at 50: a half-century of silly walks, edible props and dead parrots Read more\n\nCarroll\u2019s daughter, Susan Kay, told the Associated Press her mother died on Friday in Los Angeles of cancer. During her long career, Carroll earned a Tony award for the musical No Strings and an Academy Award nomination for Claudine.\n\nBut she was perhaps best known for her pioneering work on Julia. Carroll played Julia Baker, a nurse whose husband had been killed in Vietnam, in the groundbreaking situation comedy that aired from 1968 to 1971.\n\nAlthough she was not the first black woman to star in her own TV show (Ethel Waters played a maid in the 1950s series Beulah), she was the first to star as someone other than a servant. NBC executives were wary about putting Julia on the network during the racial unrest of the 1960s, but it was an immediate hit.\n\nIt had its critics, though, including some who said Carroll\u2019s character, who is the mother of a young son, was not a realistic portrayal of a black American woman in the 1960s. \u201cThey said it was a fantasy,\u201d Carroll recalled in 1998. \u201cAll of this was untrue. Much about the character of Julia I took from my own life, my family.\u201d\n\nNot shy when it came to confronting racial barriers, Carroll won her Tony portraying a high-fashion American model in Paris who has a love affair with a white American author in the 1959 Richard Rodgers musical No Strings. Critic Walter Kerr described her as \u201ca girl with a sweet smile, brilliant dark eyes and a profile regal enough to belong on a coin\u201d.\n\nShe appeared often in plays previously considered exclusive territory for white actors: Same Time, Next Year, Agnes of God and Sunset Boulevard (as faded star Norma Desmond, the role played by Gloria Swanson in the 1950 film).\n\n\u201cI like to think that I opened doors for other women, although that wasn\u2019t my original intention,\u201d she said in 2002.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A still from Claudine, for which Carroll received an Oscar nomination.\n\nPhotograph: Ronald Grant Archive\n\nHer film career was sporadic. She began with a secondary role in Carmen Jones in 1954 and five years later appeared in Porgy and Bess, although her singing voice was dubbed because it wasn\u2019t considered strong enough for the Gershwin opera. Her other films included Goodbye Again, Hurry Sundown, Paris Blues and The Split.\n\nThe 1974 film Claudine provided her most memorable role. She played a hard-bitten single mother of six who finds romance in Harlem with a garbage man played by James Earl Jones.\n\nShe was asked why she didn\u2019t make more films after Claudine. \u201cHave you seen another film script with a starring role with the character of Claudine? I haven\u2019t.\u201d She also said to another reporter: \u201cI\u2019m sometimes amazed at how few people realize what it takes for a black woman to survive in this business.\u201d\n\nIn the 1980s, she appeared in the long-running prime-time soap opera Dynasty for three years. More recently, she had a number of guest spots and small roles in TV series, including playing the mother of Isaiah Washington\u2019s character, Dr Preston Burke, on Grey\u2019s Anatomy.\n\nIn her 1998 memoir Diahann, Carroll traced her turbulent romantic life, which included liaisons with Harry Belafonte, Duke Ellington, Miles Davis, Sammy Davis Jr, Sidney Poitier and David Frost. She even became engaged to Frost, but the engagement was canceled.\n\nAn early marriage to the nightclub owner Monte Kay resulted in Carroll\u2019s only child, Suzanne, as well as a divorce. She also divorced her second husband, the retail executive Freddie Glusman, later marrying the magazine editor Robert DeLeon, who died.\n\nHer most celebrated marriage was in 1987, to the singer Vic Damone, and the two appeared together in nightclubs. But they separated in 1991 and divorced several years later.\n\nAfter she was treated for breast cancer in 1998, she spoke out for more money for research and for free screening for women who couldn\u2019t afford mammograms. \u201cWe all look forward to the day that mastectomies, chemotherapy and radiation are considered barbaric,\u201d Carroll told a gathering in 2000.", "description": "Actor and singer was first black woman to star in a non-servant role in a TV series and was also known for Dynasty and Grey\u2019s Anatomy", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38e75aa2580fee0343a0ea0129706dcd35e7fd1a/0_340_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=55e5e4166364d23968b2c33cdda7b25c", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
