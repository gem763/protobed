Getting through passport control", "language": "en", "text": "Today\u2019s puzzle concerns passport control, the delegation of uniformed and often surly officers at ports and airports whose job it is to check your travel document is valid.\n\nLet\u2019s say that 1 in 10,000 people who present themselves at UK passport control have invalid passports, and let\u2019s say that UK passport control is pretty good at detecting invalid passports. When presented with an invalid passport, an officer will pick this up 99 times out of 100. Travellers found with invalid documents are sent to a holding cell. Let\u2019s also imagine that UK passport control will, out of caution, very occasionally send someone to the holding cell whose passport is perfectly valid. These \u201cfalse positives\u201d occur just 0.1 per cent of the time.\n\nWhat proportion of travellers in holding cells are there because they genuinely had an invalid travel document?\n\n[To clarify: if you are in a holding cell then either you have been found out as having an invalid passport, or you are a false positive.]\n\nToday\u2019s puzzle was devised by Kit Yates, senior lecturer in mathematical biology at the University of Bath and the author of The Maths of Life and Death, a book he says is about \u201cthe places in which mathematics can have a real impact on people\u2019s lives, perhaps without them even knowing it.\u201d\n\nHis puzzle reveals a piece of mathematics that can have a great impact on people\u2019s lives \u2013 whether at passport control or not \u2013 and I will discuss this in the solution post that I will launch at 5pm today.\n\nMeanwhile, NO SPOILERS PLEASE. Instead talk about your brushes with customs officials.\n\nI set a puzzle here every two weeks on a Monday. I\u2019m always on the look-out for great puzzles. If you would like to suggest one, email me.\n\nThanks to Kit Yates for suggesting today\u2019s puzzle . His book The Maths of Life and Death is an accessible and thorough introduction to ideas in statistics and probability that crop up in areas such as health and justice. I recommend it.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Walker Books Ltd\n\nI\u2019m the author of Football School, a book series for 7 to 12 year olds that opens up the curriculum through football.
