And no matter how many pit masters I visit, the dish always evokes the high holidays for me.\n\nWhile a delicious brisket is a thing of beauty, a bad brisket can be\u2026well, I wouldn\u2019t wish such a shande (shame) on you. To ensure that your Rosh Hashanah meal is delicious I consulted Andrew Zimmern, host of the Travel Channel\u2019s show Bizarre Foods, who is a fount of brisket knowledge and cooking techniques.\n\n\u201cBrisket wisdom skips generations,\u201d he jokes. \u201cSo, my grandmother made a great brisket and I then in turn made a great brisket.\u201d Here are a few tips to ensure that your brisket is as good as his.\n\nDON\u2019T OVER COOK\n\nCooking brisket is an all-day kind of affair but you can still over cook the meat. \u201cMost people understand that a lot of these cuts have to be cooked for a long time\u2014low and slow,\u201d says Zimmern. \u201cBut what happens is that people get nervous and they actually cook the brisket too long.\u201d The meat is perfectly tender when it\u2019s \u201cnot falling apart and when you slice it, you could cut it with a fork, but it\u2019s able to be sliced. And that\u2019s that beautiful window of brisket perfection.\u201d\n\nTO TENT OR NOT TO TENT?\n\n\u201cI tent my brisket,\u201d he says. Why? \u201cI want some evaporation, because ultimately I\u2019m going to reduce that sauce.\u201d He doesn\u2019t use a lid while the meat is in the oven but instead a piece of aluminum foil that\u2019s just smaller than the pan.\n\nSLICE RIGHT\n\nIt really does matter how you slice the meat. \u201cIt is very, very important as to how you cut the brisket,\u201d says Zimmern. \u201cAnd I always go lengthwise because it\u2019s longer than it is wider. And I go at about a 25- to 30-degree angle.\u201d While that may sound complicated, \u201cas long as you\u2019re going against the grain, you\u2019re okay.\u201d\n\nTHE RIGHT RECIPE\n\nStill have questions? Try the Zimmern family recipe for the dish, which Andrew learned from his grandmother.\n\nBraised Brisket\n\nBy Andrew Zimmern\n\nINGREDIENTS:\n\n1 Tbsp. Fine sea salt, plus more for seasoning\n\n1 Tbsp. Fresh ground pepper\n\n2 Tbsp. Dried thyme\n\n2 Tbsp. Sweet paprika\n\n2 Tbsp. Dried sage\n\n1 9 to 10-pound whole beef brisket\n\n.25 cup Grapeseed oil\n\n8 medium onions (3 pounds) sliced\n\n1 tsp Black peppercorns\n\n3 Bay leaves\n\n10 Garlic cloves, peeled\n\n1 cup Tomato puree\n\n2 cups Beef stock\n\n1 cup Banyuls vinegar or aged red wine vinegar\n\n3 Fennel bulbs, each cut through the core into one-and-a-half inch wedges\n\nDIRECTIONS:\n\nIn a bowl, whisk together the salt, pepper, thyme, paprika and sage. Rub the spice mixture all over the brisket and let stand at room temperature for 1 hour.\n\nPreheat the oven to 300\u00b0. In a large flameproof roasting pan set over 2 burners, heat the oil. Add the brisket to the roasting pan and cook over moderately high heat, turning once, until browned, about 6 to 7 minutes per side. Transfer the brisket to a large baking sheet.\n\nAdd the onions and a generous pinch of salt to the roasting pan. Cook over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until the onions are softened and well browned, about 15 minutes. Add the peppercorns, bay leaf, garlic cloves, tomato puree, stock and vinegar. Bring to a simmer. Return the brisket to the roasting pan, placing it fat side up. Nestle the fennel in the braising liquid around it.\n\nTent the brisket with foil and bake for 6 to 7 hours depending on the size of your brisket, or until very tender. Transfer the brisket to a carving board, tent with foil and let rest for 20 minutes. Skim the fat off the braising liquid and discard the bay leaf. Carve the brisket and transfer to a platter. Serve with the onion gravy pan juices.\n\nYou can find additional Andrew Zimmern brisket recipes and cooking demos on his site AZ Cooks.", "description": "Just in time for the holiday, we got the celebrity chef and TV host to give us his advice and family\u2019s brisket recipe.", "authors": ["Noah Rothbaum", "Half Full Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1505705308/170915-andrew-zimmern-tease_kwog9w", "published_at": "2017-09-18"}
