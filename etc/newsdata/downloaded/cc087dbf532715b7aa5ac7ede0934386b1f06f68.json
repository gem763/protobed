One support goes down through 138 feet of soft earth.\n\nAD\n\nOver its seven decades of life, the structure has been affected by the vagaries of its location and the capricious piece of ground on which it sits.\n\nAD\n\nAs early as 1941, two years before its dedication, some of the supports under the memorial\u2019s main steps began shifting. They had to be lashed together with steel cable and turnbuckles, according to an engineering report done for the Park Service in 1965.\n\nSettlement also caused other supports under the steps to bend slightly, the report says. The steps moved so often that park rangers once kept a special tool at the site to realign them, the report says.\n\nLesser settlement continued during the 1940s and \u201850s.\n\nAD\n\nBy the 1960s, the front plaza, which was not supported by pilings, began to sink \u2014 by as much as three feet \u2014 and a $1.1 million engineering project was undertaken to bolster it with more pilings and supports.\n\nIn 2010, a $12.4 million repair project shored up the memorial\u2019s poorly supported sea wall, which also had been sinking into the tidal ooze.\n\nAD\n\nLast year, Rubenstein announced a donation of $18.5 million to help fund what is probably the biggest overhaul of the Lincoln Memorial since the structure was dedicated almost a century ago. The project began in 2016, and the Park Service hopes to have it finished for the memorial\u2019s 2022 centennial.\n\nIn 2015, Rubenstein pledged $5.37 million to refurbish the U.S. Marine Corps War Memorial, the 100-ton bronze sculpture of the flag-raising at Iwo Jima during the war.\n\nAD\n\nIn 2014, Rubenstein announced the donation of $10 million to Montpelier, President James Madison\u2019s historic Orange, Va., home, for reconstruction, refurnishing and archaeology.\n\nHe has also donated $5 million to the White House Visitor Center; $12.3 million to Arlington House, the home of Robert E. Lee; and $7.5 million to help fix the Washington Monument after the 2011 earthquake.\n\nAD\n\nThe donation for the repairs of the memorial will go to the National Park Foundation, which will distribute the funds.\n\n\u201cHopefully what we\u2019ll be able to do is make the experience of visiting the Jefferson Memorial even better than it has been,\u201d Rubenstein said as he sat at a table before the memorial Tuesday afternoon.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhile Thomas Jefferson is not without some things that we can question today, clearly he did some great things for our country,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cA very incredible person, a great intellect, a great Renaissance man and one of our greatest Americans, so I\u2019m very pleased to be able to do this,\u201d Rubenstein said.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The donation will be used to upgrade lower-level exhibit space and create new exhibits on the main level of the ailing memorial, which is already undergoing an $8.2 million external overhaul.", "authors": ["Michael E.
