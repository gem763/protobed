There are a few big fixtures coming up for the club and hopefully I can be part and contribute,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhile watching some of their recent games I am impressed with the character of the team to pull off a couple of close wins. I believe I will also learn a lot playing in a different league and different conditions from what I am use to which makes this couple of months with Ospreys even more exciting.\"\n\nOrie is waiting for his visa before heading north to a club that already has three South African familiar faces in Tom Botha, Hanno Dircksen and Shaun Venter playing for them.", "description": "Springbok lock Marvin Orie has joined the Ospreys on a short-term loan until the end of December.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8630/f1cf6c6883a54d1591327e518ec0f1bf.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
