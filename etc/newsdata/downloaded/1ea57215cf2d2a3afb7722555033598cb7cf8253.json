His only two appearances before Saturday were in relief last season.\n\nAntti Raanta was equally sharp in his first start of the season, stopping 29 shots. Michael Grabner and Nick Schmaltz scored for the Coyotes.\n\nBurakovsky got the winner after a back-and-forth extra period. Burakovsky collected the puck close in and sent a high shot past Raanta for his second goal and second winner in as many games.\n\nAfter nearly 50 minutes without a goal, the teams combined for three in a span of 2 minutes, 30 seconds.\n\nThe Avalanche scored first at 6:57 of the third on Kadri\u2019s first of the season. With Jason Demers off for tripping, Cale Makar took a shot from the point that Raanta stopped. Kadri grabbed the rebound on the left side, avoided defenseman Jordan Oesterle and beat Raanta high.\n\nThe second goal came 1:49 later when Jost, battling in front, knocked in another rebound, giving Colorado a 2-0 lead with his first of the season.\n\nGrabner made it 2-1 41 seconds later with a blast from the right circle that beat Francouz to the top corner. The Coyotes tied it at 16:03 on Schmaltz\u2019s second goal of the season.\n\nNOTES: Arizona RW Phil Kessel played in his 1,000th NHL game and 778th in a row Saturday night. Kessel is the 21st active player with a 1,000 games played and his consecutive games streak ranks third among current players. \u2026 Avalanche LW J.T. Compher missed his second straight game with a lower-body injury. \u2026 Coyotes LW Lawson Crouse was out of the lineup with an upper-body injury.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCoyotes: At Winnipeg on Tuesday.\n\nAvalanche: At Washington on Monday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://www.apnews.com/NHL and https://www.twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Andre Burakovsky scored at 3:29 of overtime and the Colorado Avalanche beat the Arizona Coyotes 3-2 on Saturday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Michael Kelly"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/13/coyotes_avalanche_hockey_31750_c0-196-3199-2062_s1200x700.jpg?0c2b149b34a673dc440d5e1448ba46aba6de15ef", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
