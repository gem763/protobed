It\u2019s an odd strategy to take, to be honest.\n\nWhile corporate honchos have long intersected with politics, it\u2019s usually been in regard to things that directly impact the companies they run. Auto safety would call for the CEOs of the Big Three to head to offer their thoughts. Banking regulations would spark comments from Financial CEOs. Things like that make sense in the grand scheme of things.\n\nMake a stand on gun control, not so much.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, however, had some thoughts on this development.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) on Thursday warned that corporate CEOs are making a mistake by wading in the charged political debate over gun control in Washington. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a positive thing to see big corporations shifting their focus from their customers and actually doing what they were created to do into trying to become political players on divisive social issues,\u201d Cruz said at a breakfast sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor. \u2026 Cruz said he thinks the CEOs are more motivated by a desire to win approval from their \u201ccountry club\u201d friends than a full understanding of gun violence and public policy.\n\nThe problem is, none of these proposals have been shown to really make anyone safer, except maybe from themselves.\n\nUniversal background checks don\u2019t stop the vast majority of criminals from getting guns and there\u2019s not a single mass shooting that would have been stopped by them either. The only potential case was the Odessa shooting, and that was a gun built for sale by an unlicensed manufacturer. He was breaking the law just by selling the gun. Does anyone really think a background check would have been conducted even if required?\n\nOf course not.\n\nThe thing is, most of the CEOs don\u2019t even seem to understand what they\u2019re talking about. Cruz knows. He\u2019s spoken to them.\n\n\u201cI will note with at least one of those banks that came out with one of those oh-so-brave corporate letters, when I sat down with their leadership and actually asked them about it, the people who wrote the letter didn\u2019t know the first thing about the substance,\u201d Cruz said. Cruz recalled that when he asked a bank engaged in a business boycott of companies that manufacture certain types of semi-automatic rifles to explain its action, the executives he met with couldn\u2019t even define what made a firearm an \u201cassault rifle.\u201d \u201cI asked what seemed like a fairly reasonable follow-up question \u2026 I said, \u2018Can you tell me what\u2019s an assault weapon?\u2019 I tell you the people who wrote the letter had absolutely no idea,\u201d Cruz said. Cruz said he\u2019s highly skeptical whether the CEOs who signed Thursday\u2019s letter to the Senate have a strong grasp of the issues being debated.\n\nRecently, I wrote about how a lot of people seem to like various propositions until the rubber meets the road. They love universal background checks until it\u2019s time to actually vote on them, then they see all the ways the legislation is a complete trainwreck.\n\nThese CEOs aren\u2019t immune to that by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nFurther, there are a couple of other facts that I think we should reflect on. For one, these CEOs have a broad knowledge base on how to run a company. I\u2019ll give them that. However, that doesn\u2019t mean they have any particular knowledge on anything outside of it. To be sure, some probably do, but not necessarily. There\u2019s absolutely nothing about them that warrants us giving them any more attention than if 145 auto mechanics or 145 bus drivers asked for the same thing. Their status doesn\u2019t imply expertise beyond the business world.\n\nAnother point worth remembering is that while they say they\u2019re taking this action on behalf of their employees, and effort to keep those employees safe, not all of those employees are going to agree with that. Many are Second Amendment supporters who would prefer not be drawn into this in such a way. Pretty much every company in the nation has a fair number of Second Amendment advocates employed there to some degree or another. These CEOs don\u2019t need to try and speak for them. They don\u2019t have that kind of authority.\n\nPlus, as Cruz points out, most of them don\u2019t know what the hell they\u2019re talking about anyway.\n\nPretty typical, actually.", "description": "Cruz notes that many times, these individuals lack a deeper understanding of the laws they're trying to advocate for.
