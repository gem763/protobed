We\u2019re so excited that Jake chose to share his Wienermobile ride with his friends and family,\u201d Matt Riezman, Oscar Mayer\u2019s associate director of marketing, said in a statement.\n\nThe fourth grader\u2019s picture day outfit choice made mustard waves when his dad, Craig, shared a picture of the school-issued ID card on Oct. 17. \u201cMy wife and I dared our son to wear a hotdog costume for school pictures,\u201d Craig Arsenault wrote. \u201cThe school let him do it, and I couldn\u2019t be happier.\u201d\n\n32,000 people shared the post, with thousands more liking and commenting.\n\nThe dare came along with a promise of a $10 payment for his son, Arsenault told USA Today. \u201cIt\u2019ll be legendary,\u201d he remembers telling his son while encouraging the costume.\n\nIt seems one Alexander Hamilton was worth it for a ride on that infamous orange drive-able hot dog.\n\nWrite to Rachel E.
