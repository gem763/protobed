The F-35B Lightning jet is the first to combine radar-evading stealth technology with supersonic speeds and short take-off and vertical landing capability.\n\nThe fighter planes will be jointly manned by the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy and can operate from land and sea.\n\nThis follows successful developmental trials last year with US Lightning jets, where forces conducted 500 take offs and landings over their 11-week period at sea.\n\nThese trials include \u2018end-to-end\u2019 testing of the aircraft and their personnel to ensure they work with the next generation carrier. The tests involve mission planning, arming the aircraft using the ship\u2019s Highly Automated Weapon Handling System, flying missions and debriefing on completion.\n\nDefence Secretary Ben Wallace said: 'The Lightning aircraft operates with a cutting-edge design. It is the first jet to combine radar evading stealth technology with supersonic speed, as well as the ability to land vertically.\n\nBritish F-35 Lightning jets, capable of supersonic speeds, have taken off and landed on the HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier for the first time, as part of advanced trials with the US military off the East coast of the US mainland\n\nThe MoD released images of the multi-role advanced aircraft hovering above and landing on the 65,000 tonne carrier for the first time on Sunday\n\nDefence Secretary Ben Wallace said: 'The Lightning aircraft operates with a cutting-edge design. It is the first jet to combine radar evading stealth technology with supersonic speed, as well as the ability to land vertically\n\nThe fighter planes will be jointly manned by the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy and can operate from land and sea, and are currently undergoing rigorous testing to ensure their compatibility with the next generation aircraft carrier\n\n'Given its ability to conduct missions both from land and sea, the jets act as a formidable spine to the \u2018carrier strike\u2019 capability. The UK currently owns 18 aircraft, with an additional order placed for 30 jets,' Mr Wallace added.\n\nFirst to land onboard, Wing Commander Adam Curd, Royal Air Force, said: 'The trials will be led by the joint Royal Navy - Royal Air Force 17 Test and Evaluation Squadron from the Air Warfare Centre. The Squadron will be operating alongside personnel and aircraft from the UK Lightning Force, based out of RAF Marham.'\n\nThe UK will declare Initial Operating Capability for Carrier Strike by the end of 2020. The first operational deployment for HMS Queen Elizabeth 617 Squadron and a squadron of US Marine Corps Lightning jets is due to take place in 2021.\n\nAir Officer Commanding Number 1 Group, Air Vice-Marshal Harvey Smyth, Royal Air Force, said: 'WESTLANT19 marks an extremely significant milestone on our 10-year journey to establishing our renewed Carrier Strike capability.\n\n'Bringing our own Lightnings onboard HMS Queen Elizabeth for the first time gives us the opportunity to conduct critical operational testing. With the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force operating so closely together, these are incredibly exciting times for embarked Combat Air.'\n\nThe UK will declare Initial Operating Capability for Carrier Strike by the end of 2020.
