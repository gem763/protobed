Taylor revealed he was told directly by Sondland that not only the meeting with Trump in the White House, but military funds the president was withholding \u2014 \u201ceverything\u201d \u2014 were contingent on Zelensky making a public statement about launching investigations. Those probes were to include the Burisma gas company \u2014 whose board once included Joe Biden\u2019s son \u2014 and an investigation into the unfounded theory that Democrats and Ukraine somehow interfered in the U.S. presidential election.\n\nSondland, a Trump appointee, testified that he was unaware of a link between the withheld military aid and Zelensky launching an investigation, his lawyer told the Journal.\n\nTaylor\u2019s account of what happened in Ukraine raised questions about Sondland\u2019s earlier testimony, and some House lawmakers have talked of calling Sondland back for more questioning.\n\nSondland would likely return for further questioning if asked, Luskin told the Journal.\n\nRead the entire Wall Street Journal report here.\n\nAlso on HuffPost\n\nLove HuffPost?
