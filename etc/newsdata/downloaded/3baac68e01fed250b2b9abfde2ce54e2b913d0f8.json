December 2015. When did he beat Eddie? November 2016. For those 12 months he ruled the world, not just UFC.\n\n\"The one thing I can remember and take away from that time was his focus. He was so focused; he decided what he wanted.\n\n\"He said stuff, he pointed to the sky, he reached for the stars and he reached for the moon and he made it happen, it was magical. That\u2019s what drew in the world for him.\n\n(Image: Zuffa LLC via Getty Images)\n\n\"I don\u2019t see that same focus. If you\u2019re going after everything, you\u2019re not focused on anything.\n\n\"Am I interested in a pay day fight to fight him? Sure. But I\u2019m really not interested in competing with him if he\u2019s not at his best. He doesn't seem healthy; he doesn\u2019t seem right.\n\n\"If he comes back and says, \u2018Hey, I beat Max when he was a kid, I want to beat him in his prime to prove I\u2019m the best ever, then yeah, I want that chance. I want that champ, that 2015 to 2016 mentality and focus.\n\n\"For now it\u2019s not interesting for me. Even for his fans, they want him focused. I wanna fight the best Conor McGregor ; he can go figure things out and let us know.\"", "description": "McGregor beat Holloway by unanimous decision in 2013 before going on to win two world titles", "authors": ["Martin Domin", "Image", "Getty Images", "Zuffa Llc Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20542337.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_UFC-Fight-Night-McGregor-v-Holloway.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
