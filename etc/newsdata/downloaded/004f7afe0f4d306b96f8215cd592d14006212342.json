REUTERS/Thilo Schmuelgen/File Picture\n\n(Reuters) - Amazon Web Services said on Monday it was creating 500 jobs in Germany and opening a new office in Munich that will showcase what cloud computing can do for potential clients in Europe\u2019s largest economy.\n\nAWS, which grew out of the technology that runs Amazon\u2019s e-commerce platform, is gaining scale in Germany after addressing concerns about privacy that led many manufacturing firms to keep their servers on-site.\n\n\u201cThose clients have overcome those compliance and security constraints and are now in catch-up mode,\u201d said Klaus Buerg, general manager of AWS in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.\n\n\u201cBecause of that kind of constraint, habit and behaviour in the past, they are now working more like a fast follower than a front runner,\u201d he told Reuters in an interview.\n\nAWS has received a cloud computing security certification from Germany\u2019s cyber-security authority, providing assurances that data is safe even if it is hosted on remote servers outside the country.\n\nAWS is establishing a Digital Builders showroom at its Munich office, in partnership with Boston Consulting Group, that will offer hands-on opportunities to demonstrate applications to prospective clients.\n\nAnd, together with Siemens, it is setting up an Industrial Software showcase to illustrate how cloud computing can support manufacturing automation.\n\nThe new jobs at AWS are part of 2,800 already announced in Germany by Amazon and will be dispersed across its operations and research units in Germany, said Buerg.", "description": "Amazon Web Services said on Monday it was creating 500 jobs in Germany and opening a new office in Munich that will showcase what cloud computing can do for potential clients in Europe's largest economy.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430361239&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F0D2", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
