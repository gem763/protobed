The SDF has said the truce was limited to the 120 km strip between the border towns of Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ayn. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says the deal requires Kurdish fighters to withdraw from an area 444 km long and 32 km deep.\n\nThe U.S. fought with the SDF for years to defeat Islamic State but withdrew from the area as Turkey began a long-threatened offensive this month to clear a part of northeastern Syria of Kurdish groups it considers a threat to national security. Abandoned by the U.S., the Kurds made a deal with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad who\u2019s troops have deployed to the border with Turkey, upending old alliances and pushing the eight-year-old Syrian war into an unpredictable new phase.\n\nHere is a rundown of major events in Turkish local time:\n\nKey Developments\n\nKurdish-led SDF accused Turkey of violating the five-day U.S.-brokered cease-fireTurkish markets rally a day after the U.S.-Turkey deal.
