The hand-drawn addition, which indicated the storm would move from Florida into Alabama, made it appear that Trump\u2019s Sunday tweet was correct, despite officials with the National Weather Service and updated forecasts saying otherwise.\n\nPresident Trump showed a doctored hurricane chart. Was it to cover up for \u2018Alabama\u2019 Twitter flub?\n\n\u201cI mean, don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m impressed that Trump can locate Alabama on a map,\u201d Noah said. \u201cBut still, the president of the United States just changed a map with a Sharpie to make himself look right, and he thought we wouldn\u2019t notice.\u201d (White House spokesman Hogan Gidley confirmed that a Sharpie was used, but who drew the line remains a mystery.)\n\nTONIGHT: Did Trump think he could change the path of the hurricane with a Sharpie and we wouldn\u2019t notice? pic.twitter.com/GFtXIEvYbF \u2014 The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) September 5, 2019\n\nThe illustration, shown in a video released by the White House Wednesday afternoon, instantly caught the attention of many, including late-night hosts, who ridiculed the president for once again appearing to distort facts. By early Thursday, \u201c#sharpiegate\u201d and other similar hashtags were still trending on Twitter.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not even trying to hide the lies anymore,\u201d ABC host Jimmy Kimmel said. \u201cNot only do we have fake news, we now have fake weather, too.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s war on reality enters bizarre new terrain\n\nOn their respective shows, Noah and Stephen Colbert both cracked jokes about how the enhanced map reminded them of a breast augmentation surgery.\n\n\u201cBefore I did that, it was a Category 5,\u201d said Colbert, speaking in his Trump voice on CBS. \u201cNow, she\u2019s a Category 10.\u201d\n\nFor Seth Meyers, Wednesday\u2019s Oval Office briefing only raised more questions about Trump.\n\n\u201cAfter this, I have to wonder if his high school report card was legit,\u201d the NBC host said, showing a photo of a fake document covered in F\u2019s that were turned into A\u2019s with black marker.\n\nFrom tonight\u2019s #LNSM: What else is Trump scribbling with Sharpies? pic.twitter.com/D7YriukxGY \u2014 Late Night with Seth Meyers (@LateNightSeth) September 5, 2019\n\nBut as the jokes and memes poured forth on Wednesday, many stressed that changing an official government weather forecast isn\u2019t just, as one person put it, \u201cMASSIVELY dangerous and irresponsible,\u201d it\u2019s also illegal. According to U.S. Code, \u201cWhoever knowingly issues or publishes any counterfeit weather forecast or warning of weather conditions falsely representing such forecast or warning to have been issued or published by the Weather Bureau, United States Signal Service, or other branch of the Government service, shall by fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ninety days, or both.\u201d The hurricane chart Trump showed featured the official logos of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Weather Service.\n\n\u201cOh my God, do you know what this means?\u201d Colbert gleefully asked his audience. \u201cWe finally caught Trump doing something wrong.\u201d\n\nColbert continued: \u201cMr. President, you\u2019re going to weather jail.\u201d\n\nThe host also came up with a new name for the gaffe.\n\n\u201cNow, because of the fact that the president misinterpreted where the water would go, I\u2019m calling this scandal \u2018Water-gate,\u2019\u201d he quipped.\n\nMeanwhile, on social media, the hurricane map inspired many people to show off their own artistic abilities, tagging their marked-up images with #sharpiegate.\n\nBlack stick figures appeared on aerial photos from Trump\u2019s inauguration. Crudely drawn walls popped up in the desert. Trump was shown with comically large hands.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, I give you the very best of #Sharpiegate !!

When pressed about the unusual marking, Trump responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh he did it,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cYou know how I know? Because Trump has never ever ever said he doesn\u2019t know anything. That\u2019s a sure tell that he knows something.\u201d\n\nMore from Morning Mix:\n\nConservative activist Jacob Wohl charged with felony in California\n\nThe FBI\u2019s terror watch list violates the Constitution, federal judge says\n\n\u2018I smacked my lips\u2019: Rep.
