The skeletons still had some clothing on them, and items of clothing suggest two may be women.\n\nFour full days of digging at the spot, about 5 miles (8 kilometers) from Puerto Pe\u00f1asco, revealed only two of the bodies were relatively recent and still had decomposing flesh on them.\n\nDrug and kidnapping gangs use such pits to dispose of the bodies of victims or rivals.\n\nThe clandestine burial pit was originally located by groups of volunteers known as the Searching Mothers of Sonora and the Searchers of Puerto Penasco. The groups are made up of relatives of missing people who investigate reports of clandestine burial sites.\n\nPuerto Penasco had been relatively quiet compared to many other parts of Mexico, but the Sinaloa drug cartel is known to be active in the area.\n\nProsecutors have offered to take DNA samples from Puerto Pe\u00f1asco residents whose relatives are missing to see if the samples match any of the skeletons.", "description": "A total of 42 bodies and skeletons have been pulled from a clandestine burial pit in the Mexican desert near the Gulf of California beach town of Puerto Penasco, which is known to U.S. tourists as Rocky Point.
