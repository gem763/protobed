Best wishes, Paul Gallen.'\n\nThe two former footballers will meet in the ring for a one-off heavyweight stoush dubbed the 'code war' at Melbourne's Margaret Court Arena on November 15\n\nGallen explained the nickname was inspired by Hall's requirements in the ring.\n\n'Barry refuses to fight three-minute rounds. We're fighting two-minute rounds. So I've nicknamed him ''two-minute noodles'',' Gallen said.\n\nThe recently retired NRL star will take on Hall in the 10th professional fight of his career, but says the 42-year-old's refusal to do it over three minute rounds isn't fair.\n\n'This fight has been spoken about for two or three years, so it's not like he just started training for it. That's why I'm so disappointed in the fact that he's only fighting two minute rounds,' Gallen said.\n\n'Everything is in his favour. He's six foot six, big long reach, can jab me, and he gets to work for two minutes and then gets a minute rest. It's not right.'\n\nThe two former football stars will face off at Margaret Court Arena in Melbourne on November 15 in an event billed as 'Code Wars'.\n\nPaul Gallen (pictured) said he nicknamed the AFL legend 'noodle' while speaking at the launch for his autobiography Heart and Soul on Monday\n\nGallen explained the nickname was inspired by Hall's requirements in the ring. 'Barry refuses to fight three-minute rounds. We're fighting two-minute rounds. So I've nicknamed him 'two-minute noodles',' Gallen said\n\nIt will be Hall's first professional fight, but Gallen says the two-minute rounds will work to his advantage.\n\n'I've messaged, emailed, rang the promoters over and over,' Gallen said.\n\n'I'm there to win. I'm not trying to sit here and make excuses, I'm more annoyed that other people around boxing seem to not like me fighting or other people fighting for whatever reason.\n\n'When they see us fighting two-minute rounds, I can understand it. It's embarrassing. I don't think it's right. I'm still going to win the fight. Whether I knock him out or do what I have do for six rounds, I'll win. I just think for an event this big it should be a real fight.'\n\nGallen (pictured with wife Anne) said he won't pursue a career in boxing after the Hall bout\n\nGallen has confirmed he won't pursue a career in boxing after the Hall bout despite hanging up the boots with Cronulla in September.\n\nHowever, he has long spoken of his desire to fight former NRL and rugby union champion Sonny Bill Williams, and would jump at the chance to get in the ring with him.\n\n'The Sonny Bill one, that's the one we want. I do hospital visits, school visits, business visits, luncheons, two weeks in the UK, everywhere I went I was asked about it. Everywhere I go. I'm not the one you've got to ask, it's him,' he said.\n\n'It would just be a spectacle and a professional event. I would just love to give the people what they want to see.'", "description": "The former Cronulla Sharks captain said he nicknamed the AFL legend 'noodle' while speaking at the launch for his autobiography, Heart and Soul.", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press", "Zoe Zaczek For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/12/20323786-0-image-a-20_1572351434105.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
