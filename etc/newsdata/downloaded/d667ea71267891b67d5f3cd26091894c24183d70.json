Letts is still a citizen of Canada, where his father comes from.\n\nSally, 57, spotted her son in the photo last week, after the Kurds allowed TV stations on both sides of the Atlantic to broadcast film from the jail.\n\nHe was shown at the start of a report by the US network CBS.\n\nSally said that stripping Jack of his citizenship had solved nothing.\n\n(Image: CBS This morning)\n\nA Home Office source is reported to have told the Mail on Sunday: \"Jihadi Jack signed up to join people who hate this country, hate our beliefs and hate our way of life.\n\n\"His parents, who have been convicted of funding terrorism by the British courts, are wasting their breath. Law-abiding Brits will think he's got off easy in that squalid prison. The thousands of victims of Jack's terrorist friends weren't that lucky.\"\n\nCanada's government also has a policy of refusing to allow IS detainees home.", "description": "Jack Letts, 23, is being held in a prison in northern Syria alongside dozens of fellow Islamic State (IS) prisoners and his parents spotted him in footage from inside the prison", "authors": ["Tom Davidson", "Image", "Cbs This Morning", "Joe Newman", "Swns.Com"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20470812.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_THP_CHPP_051019Slug_2441JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
