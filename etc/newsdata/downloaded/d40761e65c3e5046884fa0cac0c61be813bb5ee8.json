In other words, this is the most likely world to host alien life out of the thousands of exoplanets that have been catalogued by astronomers.\n\nThe discovery is a major breakthrough for research into exoplanets, which are worlds that orbit other stars, and has important implications for the search for life beyond Earth, according to a study published on Wednesday in Nature Astronomy.\n\nK2-18b, a planet located 110 light years from Earth, is \u201cthe only planet that we know of outside the solar system that has the correct temperature to support water and has an atmosphere [with] water in it,\u201d said lead author Angelos Tsiaras, an astronomer at University College London, in a teleconference on Tuesday.\n\nThe planet is \u201cthe best candidate for habitability\u201d known beyond our solar system, Tsiaras added. Because liquid water is such an essential ingredient for life on Earth, scientists judge the potential habitability of other planets based on the likelihood of surface water. It is not yet known whether K2-18b is covered in oceans or lakes, or if it currently hosts alien life.\n\nWater has previously been discovered on large gassy exoplanets, but this is the first instance of a detection on a so-called \u201csuper-Earth\u201d world. Planets in this category are bigger than Earth, but smaller than gaseous worlds like Uranus or Neptune.\n\nK2-18b is about twice the size of Earth and eight times as massive, which means it is way too large to be considered \u201cEarthlike.\u201d The planet\u2019s skies also contain a lot of hydrogen gas, in addition to the traces of water vapor, which is substantially different from Earth\u2019s nitrogen-dominant atmosphere.\n\nHowever, Tsiaras and his colleagues calculated that K2-18b is about as dense as Mars, which means it is highly likely to be a terrestrial planet with a rocky surface\u2014another major indicator of habitability.\n\nScientists have been looking for traces of water in the atmospheres of rocky super-Earths for years with no luck. That suddenly changed when Tsiaras\u2019 team used an algorithm to comb through Hubble Space Telescope observations of K2-18b during transits, which are periods when a planet passes directly in front of its star from our perspective on Earth. As its skies are backlit by the star, astronomers can sometimes detect chemical elements in its atmosphere by studying the filtered light.\n\nAccording to study co-author Ingo Waldmann, who is also an astronomer at University College London, the discovery went down over the winter holidays of 2017.\n\n\u201cThe algorithm ran on our cluster computer around Christmas, and on Christmas Eve, it popped out the signature of water in a habitable atmosphere that we publish today,\u201d Waldmann said in an email. \u201cQuite a nice Xmas present, I must say!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was unbelievably exciting initially (and still is!),\u201d he continued. \u201cIt took us over a year to do all the checks but whatever we threw at it, the feature would remain the same.\u201d\n\nNow that this milestone has been achieved, researchers hope to follow up on it with more detailed observations of K2-18b that might shed light on whether it hosts alien life.\n\nA new generation of sophisticated space observatories will be essential to finding \u201cbiomarkers,\u201d or chemical signatures of life, at the planet. NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope and the European Space Agency\u2019s ARIEL are both due to launch within the next decade, and will be especially adept at resolving fine details about molecules in exoplanet atmospheres.\n\nWaldmann said \u201cthe holy grail\u201d of this quest would be to find an irregular molecular signal that cannot be explained by geological processes. \u201cWhat these chemical signatures are, we don\u2019t know yet,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe know what it is for Earth, but life may well have evolved differently on that planet.\u201d\n\nThe detection of water vapor at K2-18b is also likely to inspire scientists to redouble efforts to find water vapor in the atmospheres of other rocky exoplanets. NASA\u2019s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), which launched in 2018, is designed to root out small terrestrial worlds within the habitable zones of their stars, so there will be plenty more candidates to investigate.\n\n\u201cThese observations are the first direct evidence that these potentially habitable atmospheres exist, and that searching for habitable conditions on super-Earths orbiting small dwarf stars is indeed the way forward in finding water vapor on other terrestrial planets,\u201d Waldmann said.\n\n\u201cWe will find many more of these systems, so K2-18b is hopefully just the first of many exciting targets we will characterize.\u201d", "description": "K2-18b is the \"best candidate\" to host alien life outside the solar system.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d791f8b44c425000871f3db/lede/1568219120215-Screen-Shot-2019-09-11-at-122443-PM.png?crop=1xw:0.6215xh;0xw,0.0889xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
