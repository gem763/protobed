The last bastion of support in the lowest zone lies around $7,400. For van der Poppe, that area forms the obvious destination if current levels break down further.\n\n\u201cIf lost -> below at $7,500 main area to look for,\u201d he added.\n\nAltcoin investors see flat performance\n\nAltcoin markets remained choppy as Bitcoin fought off its latest turbulence.
