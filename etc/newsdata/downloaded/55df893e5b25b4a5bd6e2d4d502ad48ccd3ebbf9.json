Last month, Trump, in his personal capacity, filed a lawsuit in federal court against Mazars and Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance (D) in an effort to block the subpoena.\n\nTrump is requesting that a judge temporarily enjoin Mazars from complying with the subpoena as the case is adjudicated, while the Manhattan district attorney's office is arguing that the case should be dismissed, and that any legal challenge to its subpoena should take place in state court rather than federal court.\n\nThe parties in the lawsuit have agreed for the DA's office to suspend enforcement of the subpoena until either 1 p.m. two business days after a judge's ruling on pending motions or 1 p.m. on Oct. 7, whichever comes first.\n\nIn its filing on Wednesday, DOJ argued that the federal court can be involved in the case.\n\n\"Congress has provided both subject-matter jurisdiction and a cause of action that authorize this Court to hear the President\u2019s claims, and neither of the District Attorney\u2019s objections to this Court\u2019s exercise of that jurisdiction has merit,\" DOJ wrote.\n\nDOJ also urged the judge handling the case to establish \"a briefing schedule that will permit the type of considered deliberation appropriate for the serious constitutional issues at stake in this proceeding\" and to temporarily block the subpoena if needed to preserve the status quo while the case is being considered.\n\n\"Doing so will prevent irreparable harm to the President\u2019s asserted constitutional interest in not having his records subjected to state criminal compulsory process in these circumstances, while the District Attorney has identified no prejudice from a short delay to this discrete portion of the grand jury investigation at issue,\" DOJ said.\n\nIn his complaint, Trump argued that the subpoena violates the law because sitting presidents can't be criminally investigated or prosecuted. DOJ did not say in its filing whether it agreed with this argument.\n\nThe judge hearing the case is Victor Marrero, who was appointed by former President Bill Clinton William (Bill) Jefferson ClintonCNN's Van Jones: Democrats in 'lose-lose' situation on impeachment New York prosecutors blast DOJ filing in lawsuit over tax return subpoena Ignore the hype \u2014 this is not an impeachment inquiry MORE.", "description": "The Department of Justice (DOJ) on Wednesday intervened in President Trump's lawsuit over New York prosecutors' subpoena for his tax returns.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/doj_050919gn3_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
