Only Lib Dems will stop Brexit.'\n\nAfter the rally, Boris Johnson tried to distance himself from a legally required request for a Brexit extension by stressing to the EU it was sent to Brussels at Parliament's bidding.\n\nAfter suffering an embarrassing defeat in the Commons over his Brexit plans, the Prime Minister got a senior diplomat to send an unsigned photocopy of the call by MPs to delay withdrawal from the bloc.\n\nIn a second note to European Council president Donald Tusk, the PM said a Brexit extension would be 'deeply corrosive'.\n\nThe stance is likely to spark a fierce political row.\n\nAfter the letter asking for a Brexit delay was sent to the EU, Mr Corbyn tweeted: 'I told the Prime Minister to obey the law and despite his petulant posturing and bluster he finally has - he's asked for an extension.\n\n'His damaging deal was defeated.'", "description": "Speaking at a raucous party rally in Liverpool on Saturday night, the Labour leader said his party would reject Prime Minister Boris Johnson's deal with the European Union as he mobilised for an election.", "authors": ["James Wood For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/22/19938536-0-image-a-11_1571521985176.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
