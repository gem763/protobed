He tells how he isolated himself, did not wash, barely ate and, when he did, would vomit afterward.\n\nIt was at this point that he realized he would either have a heart attack or an overdose if he carried on.\n\nHe writes: \u201cI had no idea how to live, but I didn\u2019t want to die.\u201d\n\nSo on July 29, 1990, he checked into rehab in Chicago at the age of 43. It was said to be the first time in his pampered life he had learned how to operate a washing machine.\n\nElton has now been clean for 29 years.\n\nOn his famous friends\n\nOver a 50-year career, Elton has rubbed shoulders with pretty much every celebrity going.\n\nHe once gave John Lennon a rather rude cuckoo clock \u2013 where the bird had a wooden penis that popped in and out.\n\nHe writes how actress Liz Taylor would charm him into giving her his expensive jewelry.\n\nAnd he was once gobsmacked when the Queen gave him a conspiratorial wink before jokingly slapping her nephew Viscount Linley around the face.\n\nRod Stewart, who adopted the alter ego of \u201cPhyllis\u201d to Elton\u2019s \u201cBeryl\u201d in their friendship, sent him a domed hair dryer, like the sort used by pensioners in salons, when news of Elton\u2019s hair loss hit the headlines.\n\nTheir banter and friendly rivalry led to Elton arranging for a blimp advertising one of Rod\u2019s gigs to be shot down \u2013 and he suspects it was Rod who later stole one of his own promotional banners.\n\nBut one star he does not have much affection for is Tina Turner, after she criticized his clothes, hair and even the color of his piano ahead of a planned joint tour in 1997.\n\nThe straw that broke the camel\u2019s back was a heated argument over her song \"Proud Mary\" when Elton told her to \u201cstick her f---ing song up her ar-e\u201d.\n\nNot surprisingly, the tour was cancelled, although the pair did later make up.\n\nOn being a dad\n\nElton and husband David are parents to Zachary, 8, and Elijah, 6, who were both conceived using the same donor eggs and surrogate.\n\nBut fatherhood was not something Elton had yearned for, especially considering his own troubled childhood.\n\nELTON JOHN HIJACKED ROLLING STONES CONCERT HIGH ON COCAINE; KEITH RICHARDS WAS NOT HAPPY\n\nIn the book, he writes: \u201cIf you\u2019d tried telling the Elton John of the Seventies or Eighties that he could find more fulfillment on a deep and profound level in changing a nappy than in writing a song or playing a gig, you\u2019d probably have had to exit the room at high speed immediately afterwards, with crockery flying past your ears.\u201d\n\nSo it was a surprise when he found parenting such a pleasure.\n\nHe writes: \u201cI even found the toddler tantrums weirdly charming.\n\n\u201cYou think you\u2019re being difficult, my little sausage? Have I ever told you about the time I drank eight vodka martinis, took all my clothes off in front of a film crew and then broke my manager\u2019s nose?\u201d\n\nAnd it is the simple pleasures, such as going to see a family movie or taking them to watch his beloved Watford FC, he enjoys the most.\n\nSo much so he is winding down from music to spend more time being a dad. It was when David presented him with their sons\u2019 school schedule, charting their lives, that he realized he could not be an international rock star as well as the kind of dad he wanted to be.\n\nHaving taken pride in still performing 120 gigs a year, he planned for retiring from the stage.\n\nHe is currently in the middle of a 300-date Farewell \"Yellow Brick Road\" tour, ending in 2021.\n\nHe said earlier this year: \u201cBy the time I finish I\u2019ll be at least 75. That will be a chance to reassess what I want to do. I just owe it to those children to be there for them.\u201d\n\nHe also writes in the book about the time he was diagnosed with cancer in 2017 and needed surgery to remove his prostate.\n\nWhen a subsequent infection left him 24 hours away from death, he prayed to live to see his kids again. It was as he was recovering that he realized he had to stop touring.\n\nHe writes: \u201cMusic was the most wonderful thing, but it still didn\u2019t sound as good as Zachary chattering about what had happened at Cubs or football practice.\u201d\n\nOn his friend Princess Diana\n\nElton first became friends with Princess Diana in 1981 at an awkward 21st birthday party for Prince Andrew, and he recalls how he found her company and thirst for gossip irresistible.\n\nHe tells a fascinating story about a party years later, after she had separated from Prince Charles, during which Hollywood A-listers Sylvester Stallone and Richard Gere competed for her attention.\n\nELTON JOHN WRITES QUEEN ELIZABETH SLAPPED HER NEPHEW ACROSS THE FACE IN FRONT OF HIM IN NEW BOOK\n\nElton\u2019s husband David found the actors \u201csquaring up to each other\u201d and preparing to trade blows.\n\nAction-man Sly then stormed off, saying: \u201cI never would have come if I\u2019d known Prince f---in\u2019 Charming was gonna be here.\u201d\n\nAddressing his fall-out with Diana, Elton reveals it was over a photography book featuring nearly naked men, by fashion designer Gianni Versace \u2013 the proceeds of which were going to Elton\u2019s Aids Foundation.\n\nDiana had agreed to write the foreword but he says she pulled out at the last minute.\n\nThe pair made up in July 1997 after Versace was shot and killed. It was just seven weeks before Diana herself lost her life.\n\nElton famously played a special tribute of \"Candle In The Wind\" at her funeral but admits he has only listened to that version once since.\n\nHe also says he felt uncomfortable that the single, which is the biggest-selling UK song of all time, stayed at No. 1 for five weeks as it meant footage of Diana\u2019s funeral was repeated on \"Top Of The Pops.\"\n\nOn love\n\nThe singer\u2019s huge hits, such as \"Tiny Dancer\" and \"Your Song,\" might be about love but Elton\u2019s experience with it has been as turbulent as the rest of his life.\n\nHe admits he would chase straight men as well as fall \u201chopelessly in love\u201d with someone he spotted in a gay bar, convinced he was The One.\n\nHe lavished his love interests, including ex Hugh Williams, with expensive gifts, before tiring of them after a few months \u2013 and getting someone else to ditch them.\n\nHe writes: \u201cIt was absolutely dreadful behavior. I\u2019d have one leaving at the airport at the same time as the new one was flying in.\u201d\n\nHe even attributes the time he overdosed on Valium pills as probably due to \u201csome catastrophic love affair gone wrong\u201d.\n\nIn 1993, he met film-maker David Furnish. The pair entered a civil partnership on December 21, 2005 \u2013 the day the UK\u2019s Civil Partnership Act came into effect. That partnership has now been converted into a marriage.\n\nOn his mother Sheila\n\nWhen he was 13, Elton\u2019s parents split up. Many of their arguments had been about his upbringing, so Elton blamed himself for their toxic relationship.\n\nHis own relationship with his mum Sheila was also turbulent. He describes how she often delivered hidings and even toilet-trained him by beating him with a wire brush.\n\nYet he says she could also be fun and was supportive of his career and of him when he came out as gay.\n\nBut when he married David, things took a turn for the worse.\n\nHe recalls how she turned up to their civil partnership at the Guildhall in Windsor, Berks, \u201cin character as a raving sociopath.\u201d\n\nShe proceeded to moan, snap, storm off and complain about everything to everyone she met.\n\n\"X-Factor\" judge Sharon Osbourne, a guest at the bash, told Elton: \u201cI want to kill her.\u201d\n\nHe also describes having to tiptoe around Sheila, never knowing what would enrage her next.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTowards the end of her life, they had a bitter falling-out, which lasted seven years.\n\nAccording to an interview with Sheila in 2015, it was sparked when she said to him: \u201cYou think more of that f---ing thing you married than your own mother.\u201d\n\nSheila then auctioned off many of the gifts he had given her \u2013 and even hired \"The Ultimate Elton Tribute Band\" for her 90th birthday.\n\nThe pair reconciled ahead of her death, aged 92, in 2017.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Sun.", "description": "From tripping naked on drug-fuelled binges to rowing with Princess Diana and sharing a joke with the Queen, Sir Elton John does not hold back in his new autobiography, \"Me.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/01/24/694940094001_5718811040001_5718803862001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
