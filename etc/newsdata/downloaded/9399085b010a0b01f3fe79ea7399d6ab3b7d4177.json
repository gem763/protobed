With the Finn\u2019s Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton in third it ensures the German team secured the constructors\u2019 championship. Red Bull\u2019s Alexander Albon was in fourth, with Carlos Sainz in fifth for McLaren and Charles Leclerc in sixth.\n\nBottas\u2019s win has just kept his championship hopes alive, although Hamilton is still on course to take his sixth title. The British driver leads the Finn by 64 points and will take the championship if he is 78 in front after the Mexican Grand Prix.\n\nJapanese Grand Prix: Formula One 2019 \u2013 Bottas wins, Mercedes secure constructors' championship - live! Read more\n\nThe result means Mercedes now have their sixth consecutive constructors\u2019 championship with four races remaining, another remarkable display of dominance from the team. It equals the record set by Ferrari between 1999 and 2004 and now that only Hamilton and Bottas can take the drivers\u2019 title they are assured of becoming the first team to secure six consecutive drivers\u2019 and constructors\u2019 doubles.\n\nBottas has been bullish of late that he had to start taking his opportunities if he was to end the season strongly and backed his intent with a confident and controlled drive to deny his teammate and Ferrari the win.\n\nThis is Bottas\u2019s sixth career victory, his third this season and his first win at the Japanese Grand Prix. The victory also continues the Mercedes hegemony at Suzuka, the team remain unbeaten here since the turbo-hybrid era began in 2014. Bottas delivered a strong performance during weekend when he has looked quick in every session.\n\nBottas took the win having started from third on the grid after qualifying was postponed until Sunday morning because of Typhoon Hagibis. In a tight session run just four hours before the race it was Vettel who took pole with fine a lap. In Ferrari\u2019s fifth consecutive pole Vettel was just under two tenths clear of Leclerc as the Scuderia locked out the front row for the third time this season. They had looked superb through every sector, finding time that they had not shown in practice, while Hamilton was fourth.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Valtteri Bottas (bottom left) overtook Ferrari\u2019s Sebastian Vettel into the first turn of Lap 1.

They had brought minor upgrades to the race which appeared to be working well. Their car, strong through the corners all season and working its tyres well, was again in its element here. Ferrari however, who have enjoyed a resurgence as they found performance over the last five meetings, once again could not convert their clear qualifying pace with Vettel making a mistake at the start and Leclerc hitting Max Verstappen on the opening lap.\n\nBottas made a blistering start from third to take the lead, while Vettel only crept away having moved before the lights went out but then checked the car. The German was investigated for a jump start, no action was taken but the damage was done.\n\nCharles Leclerc brings winds of change to Ferrari in move on No 1 spot Read more\n\nLeclerc from second then hit Verstappen through turn one. The Ferrari driver took wing damage and was forced to pit for a replacement after his wing shed debris into the path of Hamilton who had remained in fourth. Verstappen, who had been blameless, had to retire because of the damage on lap 15. The incident will be investigated after the race.\n\nBottas promptly opened up a two second gap on Vettel, who was comfortably matching the Finn\u2019s lap times, while Hamilton was edging up in third. Ferrari pitted Vettel first on lap 17 to take the soft tyres, committing to a two-stop race. Mercedes reacted and pitted Bottas a lap later as the team confirmed he would be also be two-stopping with Hamilton initially on a one-stop strategy.\n\nHamilton stayed out while Bottas threw down quick times on his new rubber. Mercedes brought the world champion in on lap 22 for the mediums \u2013 able to one-stop \u2013 and emerged in third but he was immediately concerned at the time he had lost staying out and whether he could make it to the end on his tyres. The team switched him to two-stop and told him to push.\n\nVettel made his second stop on lap 32, followed by Bottas on lap 37, leaving Hamilton leading until he too came in on lap 43. Emerging in third he set off chasing down Vettel on fresher rubber but although he caught the German could find no way past with the Ferrari\u2019s straightline speed. Bottas however had maintained his composure out front from the moment he took the lead and held it to the flag for a well-deserved victory.\n\nDaniel Ricciardo was an impressive seventh from 16th on the grid for Renault, with his teammate Nico H\u00fclkenberg in 10th. Toro Rosso\u2019s Pierre Gasly was eighth, with Racing Point\u2019s Sergio P\u00e9rez in ninth.", "description": "Valtteri Bottas claimed victory at the Japanese Grand Prix to help Mercedes win their sixth consecutive constructors\u2019 championship with four races remaining", "authors": ["Giles Richards"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e20a32d965ef987dc16c32ad5b0d8c9f0d3e150/0_190_4729_2838/master/4729.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=28b6a82a9a496f9eb17256a28fd328b2", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
