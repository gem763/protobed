But his 1966 motorcycle accident delayed publication and made the book a kind of underground legend, with unauthorized versions turning up. By 1971, Dylan\u2019s influence had waned and reviewers were unimpressed. Village Voice critic Robert Christgau called \u201cTarantula\u201d an unsatisfying and aimless throwback to Dylan\u2019s 1960s writings, and Dylan himself would say the book was his manager\u2019s idea, although it still has a cult following.\n\nThe audio of \u201cTarantula\u201d comes out December 3.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Bob Dylan's \"Tarantula,\" a stream-of-consciousness work first released in 1971, is finally coming out in audio.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
