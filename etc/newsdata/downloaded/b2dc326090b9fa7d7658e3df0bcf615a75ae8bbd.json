Satterfield | Adem Altan/AFP via Getty Images Turkey summons US ambassador over Armenian genocide resolution Ankara expresses anger at move by House of Representatives.\n\nTurkey has summoned the U.S. ambassador after lawmakers in Washington voted to recognize Ottoman-era mass killings of Armenians as a genocide and called for sanctions against Ankara.\n\nOn Tuesday, the U.S. House of Representatives approved a resolution recognizing the genocide \u2014 which Ankara denies \u2014 and passed a bill aiming to impose fresh sanctions on Turkey over its military operation against Syrian Kurdish forces.\n\nIn response, the Turkish government on Wednesday morning summoned David Satterfield, the U.S. representative in Ankara, the state news agency Anadolu reported.\n\nThe Turkish foreign ministry rejected the genocide recognition as \"meaningless\" and \"devoid of any historical or legal basis\" in a statement issued late Tuesday, suggesting that lawmakers had approved the resolution to \"take vengeance\" against Turkey over its incursion into Syria.\n\n\"Undoubtedly, this resolution will negatively affect the image of the U.S. before the public opinion of Turkey as it also brings the dignity of the U.S. House of Representatives into disrepute,\" the statement added.\n\nThe Armenian genocide \u2014 the massacre and deportation of hundreds of thousands of Armenians at the hands of Ottoman Turks in 1915 \u2014 is a sensitive issue in Turkey.\n\nTurkey accepts that many Armenians in the Ottoman Empire died during World War I, but denies that the killings were systematic and firmly rejects the label genocide.\n\nMost modern historians say that the killings do constitute genocide. In the EU, many countries and institutions have recognized the killings as genocide, often prompting outrage from Turkey.\n\nThe U.S. resolution comes amid deteriorating ties between Ankara and Washington following disputes over a number of issues, in particular Turkey's recent Syria offensive.\n\nThe Turkish foreign ministry on Tuesday also condemned the U.S. lawmakers' Syria sanctions bill, which passed with an overwhelming bipartisan majority of 403 to 16. The draft legislation \"is incompatible with the spirit of our NATO Alliance,\" the ministry said.\n\nTo enact the sanctions \u2014 which target senior Turkish officials and would restrict weapons sales to Turkey \u2014 the bill still needs to pass the Senate and be signed off by President Donald Trump.", "description": "Ankara expresses anger at move by House of Representatives.", "authors": ["Zia Weise", "Quint Forgey"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1165944403-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
