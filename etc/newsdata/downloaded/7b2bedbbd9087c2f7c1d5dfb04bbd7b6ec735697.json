They come after you,\" Mr Giuliani can be heard saying in a September voicemail.\n\nAn unidentified man replies, \"You got the truth on your side.\"\n\nMr Giuliani says \"it's very powerful.\"\n\nCongress has launched an impeachment probe investigating Mr Trump's alleged abuses of power in his dealings with Ukraine, which include a phone call with the country's president that appears to offer military aid in exchange for dirt on Mr Biden, potentially his Democratic rival in the 2020 election.\n\nTwo of Mr Giuliani's associates recently pleaded not guilty to donating to campaigns in an attempt to influence US officials in the interest of foreign agents.\n\nIn the September conversation, Mr Giuliani tells the other person that \"there's plenty more to come out\" about the Bidens.\n\n\"He did the same thing in China. And he tried to do it in Kazakhstan and in Russia,\" he said. \"It's a sad situation. You know how they get? Biden has been been trading in on his public office since he was a senator.\"\n\nMr Giuliani continued: \"When he became vice president, the kid decided to go around the world and say, 'Hire me because I'm Joe Biden's son.' And most people wouldn't hire him because he had a drug problem.\"\n\nMr Giuliani also brought up Mr Kerry's stepson, Christopher Heinz, an early business partner of Mr Biden's son before cutting ties when he entered Ukraine.\n\n\"Secretary of State and the vice president for the price of one,\" Mr Giuliani can be heard saying.\n\nThough the audio is difficult to discern through muffled voices in a second voicemail from earlier this month, Mr Giuliani discusses his apparent business dealings with Bahrain.\n\nMr Giuliani once met with the Persian Gulf nation's King Hamad Bin Isa al-Khalifa, and the former New York mayor told The Daily Beast that he planned to advise the country's police force on counter-terrorism measures through his security consulting firm.\n\nOne of Mr Trump's donors \u2014 Imaad Shah Zuberi, who gave nearly $1m to the president's inauguration committee \u2014 was recently indicted for election fraud for funnelling millions of dollars from Bahrain. Among Mr Zuberi's lobbying schemes was a plan to lift sanctions in Bahrain, where he falsely said his firm was investing in a resort. But he didn't disclose that he was using funds from a Bahrain national to make the argument.\n\nIn the voicemail, Mr Giuliani says that \"Charles would have a hard time with a fraud case 'cause he didn't do any due diligence.\" It's unclear who that \"Charles\" is.\n\nHe also says he's going to \"call Robert again tomorrow\" and asks \"Is Robert around?\"\n\nThe voice responds, \"He's in Turkey.\"\n\nGiuliani tells him, \"The problem is we need some money.\"\n\nFollowing a nine-second pause in their conversation, Giuliani clarifies that \"we need a few hundred thousand.\"\n\nAccording to NBC News, that \"Robert\" is likely to be Robert Mangas, a lawyer at a firm where Mr Giuliani once worked that was also registered to lobby the US on behalf of Turkey.\n\nRead more\n\nTrump lawyer associates Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman plead not guilty\n\nGiuliani 'asked Trump to extradite Muslim cleric wanted by Erdogan'\n\nPence and Giuliani refuse to cooperate with impeachment inquiry\n\nGiuliani says he will not comply with congressional subpoena\n\n\u2018Giuliani\u2019s a grenade who\u2019ll blow everyone up\u2019, John Bolton rages", "description": "President Donald Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani can be heard discussing Joe Biden, his son Hunter Biden, former secretary of state John Kerry and a need for cash on two voicemails accidentally left on a reporter's mobile phone.Mr Giuliani had reportedly \"butt dialled\" NBC reporter Rich", "authors": ["Alex Woodward"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/U6hD7B9PrBUgkl5o4.raRw--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/a4d5d2bf41126c943c50bd5cc2dd684f", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
