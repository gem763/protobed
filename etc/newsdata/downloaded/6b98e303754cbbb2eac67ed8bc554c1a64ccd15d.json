In the later months of his tenure Trump openly questioned his job performance.\n\n\u201cCertain things I love that he does, and there are certain things I don\u2019t love,\u201d Trump said in a November 2018 interview on Fox News Sunday. \u201cHe\u2019s doing an excellent job in many ways. There are a couple of things where it\u2019s just not his strength.\u201d\n\nKelly was replaced by current acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney.\n\n\u201cThe system that should be in place, clearly \u2014 the system of advising, bringing in experts in, having these discussions with the president so he can make an informed decision, that clearly is not in place. And I feel bad that I left,\u201d Kelly said in his Friday interview.\n\nMulvaney found himself in hot water earlier this month after admitting the Trump administration withheld military aid from Ukraine to pressure the country to investigate interference in the 2016 presidential election. He walked back his comments the next day, stating that \u201cthere was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election.\u201d\n\nTrump is currently the subject of an impeachment inquiry by House Democrats into whether he withheld military aid from Ukraine to pressure Ukrainian officials to look into corruption allegations against political rival Joe Biden.\n\nRepublicans on Capitol Hill have been privately complaining about Mulvaney\u2019s response to the impeachment inquiry, according to the Washington Post. Mulvaney\u2019s seeming inability to restrain the president or build a targeted messaging campaign against impeachment have rattled Republicans, who, the Post writes, are actively contemplating replacements for the embattled chief of staff.", "description": "Kelly, a retired four-star Marine general, served as Trump's chief of staff from July 2017 to January 2019.
