It was the second straight month of weaker year-on-year data. China expects annual GDP growth of 6% to 6.5% this year, down from last year\u2019s 6.6% growth.\n\nStill, investors appeared relieved the numbers weren\u2019t worse, considering the ongoing tariff war with the U.S. and signs of a global slowdown.\n\n\u201cWhile the GDP is testing the lower bound of the official annual 6-6.5% target, today\u2019s data suggests there is a very limited risk of breaching the lower bounds of that target this year,\u201d Stephen Innes, Asia-Pacific market strategist for AxiTrader, wrote in a note. \u201cWhile risk asset is not flashing all green, markets can breathe a sigh of relief.\u201d\n\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei NIK, +0.56% rose 0.5% as a core inflation reading fell to 0.3% in September, the lowest level since April 2017, but in line with analysts\u2019 expectations.
