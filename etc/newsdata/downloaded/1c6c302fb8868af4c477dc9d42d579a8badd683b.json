The opening weekend of action in Japan saw the tournament\u2019s officials widely criticised for a series of poor decisions where players escaped red cards despite their dangerous play.\n\nReece Hodge case provides unwanted World Cup distraction for Wallabies | Bret Harris Read more\n\nAustralia\u2019s wing Reece Hodge went unpunished for a high tackle on Fiji\u2019s Peceli Yato, although he was retrospectively cited and has now been banned for the rest of the pool stage.\n\nThe Samoan pair Rey Lee-Lo and Motu Matu\u2019u did likewise in their win over Russia and Lee-Lo has now been banned for three weeks.\n\nWorld Rugby took the unprecedented step of criticising its own referees in the wake of those incidents and there is a feeling a spate of red cards could now be the result.\n\nSpeaking before Wales\u2019 crunch match with Australia in Tokyo on Sunday, the flanker Tipuric said: \u201cWe spoke about the laws before coming into the tournament and about tackle techniques. Shaun Edwards did quite a bit with us about being aware and adjusting our tackle height a little bit because, with the new laws coming in, you have to be extra careful.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ken Owens is expected to be fit to play for Wales against Australia after picking up a knock against Georgia.

The governing body expressed its concern at Hodge\u2019s admission which raises serious questions about the Wallabies\u2019 preparations. It is a direct contrast to Wales\u2019 detailed approach.\n\nThe forwards coach, Robin McBryde, said: \u201cThe communication between World Rugby and ourselves has been excellent. Everyone is more than aware of the crackdown on certain rules. Players know they will have to do their utmost to keep their focus and concentration to not make silly errors.\u201d\n\nWarren Gatland knows Wales cannot afford to lose a man if they want to beat Australia in what is viewed as a straight shootout to see who will ultimately top Pool D.\n\nWales beat the Wallabies the last time they met in November 2018 and in doing so broke a 13-match losing streak dating back to 2008. Over the course of those 14 games, the average gap between the two sides has been only seven points and another tight battle is expected in the Japanese capital.\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\nTipuric added: \u201cBefore we even came here you knew this was going to be a big one. Now we\u2019re here it\u2019s time to perform. Momentum is important. If you keep on building that and put in good performances you are going to be flying and tough to beat.\n\n\u201cIdeally we will win on Sunday and it would put us top of the group and make life a little bit easier for the rest of the games.\u201d\n\nWales have been boosted by positive injury updates on Ken Owens and Hadleigh Parkes who will be fit for the match after picking up knocks in Monday\u2019s 43-14 thrashing of Georgia.", "description": "Warren Gatland\u2019s side, who face Australia in a key Pool D match on Sunday, have put in extra tackle technique training", "authors": ["Alex Bywater"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6e3d37b9ea696d492723f0e7501502203758ab4/0_35_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=42e49ddabf0b3f2e8c4a6cb341c3ec13", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
