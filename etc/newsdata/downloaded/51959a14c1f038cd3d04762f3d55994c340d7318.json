(Which is fine, we got plenty of 2053 Joanie last week, though an update on that storyline is hopefully coming soon, given the inconclusive way it ended previously.)\n\nIt\u2019s Helen\u2019s birthday across both parts of this episode, which catches us up on two important situations: Sierra struggling with motherhood, and Noah\u2019s potential impending cancellation. That\u2019s because, while many people choose to make their birthdays all about themselves, Helen instead is focused on the needs of others \u2014 perhaps because she hates her birthday, or perhaps because of her deeply rooted need to help others.\n\nThe day starts off as a good one for Helen, as she manages to get a job with an interior design firm despite a falling-out with a key client. But then she has to contend with a social worker investigating Sierra after the car accident from Episode 505 (which, to be fair, is justified \u2014 that was a messed-up situation), and doles out some rough talk to her next-door neighbor/baby mama of her deceased partner.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s all to try to make sure that Sierra continues to be Eddie\u2019s caregiver, which is not a given after a poor performance in front of the social worker (even though, to Sierra\u2019s credit, she did get off the couch and clean up her house). Sierra is clearly overwhelmed, and Helen wants to help, which is why she invites her to stay over for an unspecified period of time.\n\nThis conflicts, however, with Sasha Mann\u2019s effort to surprise Helen \u2014 and when the movie star finds out that his girlfriend won\u2019t abandon her pre-existing low-key birthday plans to be whisked away for a romantic dinner at the legendary French Laundry, he gets pretty pissy. It ties in pretty well with something the daughter of his deceased fianc\u00e9e tells Helen during a clandestine meeting earlier in the day: He needs control.\n\nAs a factor in that, Helen learns that Christianna is quasi-blackmailing Sasha with the story of his relationship with her mother \u2014 or, from her point of view, she\u2019s trying to get the money her mother left to her, which Sasha controls. Helen thinks Sasha should just let it go, give Christianna the money and let her write her book; Sasha, though, is worried that she\u2019d try to destroy his career. It was clear a couple of episodes ago that Sasha is just as flawed and messed up as any of the other characters on this show, and this week, he\u2019s never been uglier, especially when Helen steps up to protect Sierra from her mother\u2019s influence (as Adeline, another movie star obsessed with her image, wants to institutionalize her).\n\nWhether or not Helen\u2019s making the right choice in taking Sierra in is unclear, but at least she\u2019s behaving like an adult. The same cannot be said of Noah, who over the course of his section of the episode is a petulant child. It\u2019s honestly hard to watch someone who\u2019s theoretically intelligent make the worst possible decisions. In this episode, Noah is surrounded by people who are giving him good advice \u2014 his old school friend Ariel, his publishing associates, his lawyer \u2014 and he doesn\u2019t just ignore it, he actively rejects it.\n\nWhy? Because he is convinced that he did nothing wrong, once again proving himself to be the platonic ideal of straight white male privilege. Except this time, he\u2019s doing so during the Me Too era, and he might \u2026 actually face some consequences for his actions over the previous seasons? It\u2019s a shocking idea, especially in an era when the men who do get \u201ccanceled\u201d for far worse acts actually don\u2019t experience much in the way of real repercussions.\n\nBut as Petra from Vanity Fair picks through Noah\u2019s past and pinpoints elements that highlight some of his worst decisions and actions, his reaction is to get more and more defensive, making things worse and worse for himself. Noah\u2019s story checks off perhaps every clich\u00e9 about men defending themselves against allegations of this sort, to an almost shocking degree \u2014 reader, I howled when he told Eden that \u201cI have two daughters!\u201d, because the \u201cI am a father of daughters\u201d defense in the context of sexual harassment scandals has basically become a joke. (Because, after all, it implies that a man can\u2019t see women as people unless he\u2019s fathered some.)\n\nThe most fascinating thing about so many of Noah\u2019s POV segments is that you\u2019d assume that he\u2019d put himself in the best possible light \u2014 and, instead, he actively makes himself seem worse. Imagine Eden\u2019s POV on Noah coming to her work event and accosting her over coming forward! It would be a literal horror film.\n\nIn the episode\u2019s final moments, with Noah surrounded by his family, Helen happily telling him that their son made the dean\u2019s list \u2014 \u201cwe did good, Solloway\u201d \u2014 before getting the call from Petra, I did feel a little sorry for him, knowing that the happiness and success he\u2019d been so close to achieving was about to slip away. But also, it\u2019s hard not to say that thanks to ego, hubris, and poor judgement, he ultimately did it to himself.\n\nThere Is No Objective Truth (Just Bullet Points)\n\n\u2022 Two! Two West Wing alumni in the same episode! Always lovely to see returning players Janel Moloney and Richard Schiff, even if they don\u2019t share a scene together.\n\n\u2022 A key detail, one the show will hopefully loop back to explore, is the fact that it wasn\u2019t Eden who went to the Vanity Fair reporter with her story, but the other way around. That means someone tipped the reporter off to the fact that Eden would have something to say, and who that person is could be an interesting reveal.\n\n\u2022 Real talk: Why, in Helen\u2019s POV, does Noah remember to bring lasagna for Helen\u2019s birthday, while his version of the evening includes her getting a birthday cake? Perhaps for the same reason that this scene includes Helen telling him about Martin making the dean\u2019s list at school and in general congratulating him on doing a good job raising their children together \u2014 it\u2019s like, in Noah\u2019s memory, all the happiness of their lives got mashed up in one scene.\n\n\u2022 Of course Sasha and Adeline know each other. Hollywood is the tiniest town.\n\n\u2022 Did anyone else go from \u201coh cool, good for Christianna for writing a book!\u201d to \u201coh, no, she just wrote a tell-all about her almost-stepdad?\u201d Between this, Descent, and the memoir written by Noah\u2019s student, it seems like no one involved with The Affair believes that authors sometimes make stuff up.\n\n\u2022 While writing this recap, I joked with a friend that I was struggling because \u201cI am pretty sure Vulture won\u2019t accept an Affair recap where I just type NOAH DUMB 500 times.\u201d His response: \u201cI dunno, it\u2019s undoubtedly accurate.\u201d", "description": "Noah is surrounded by people who are giving him good advice, and he doesn\u2019t just ignore it, he actively rejects it.
