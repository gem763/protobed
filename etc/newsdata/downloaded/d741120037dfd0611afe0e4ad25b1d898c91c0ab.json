A large economy gives its government the ability to invest in new technology.\u201d\n\nHe added that Beijing was clearly prioritizing technological progress as a political strategy to keep the ruling Communist Party in power.\n\nHe accused China of \u201caggressively trying to steal technology\u201d and \u201cmake it Chinese.\u201d He quoted Department of Justice figures that show that in 90% of industrial espionage cases reported in America, Chinese parties are involved.\n\nBrown opined that Beijing leaders \u201cwant to develop a [technological] base so they don\u2019t need to go outside.\u201d\n\nAnd he slated successive American administrations for failing to invest in IT, a factor that may compromise national security. He said,\n\n\u201cThe private sector isn\u2019t going to take the risk to invest in long-term technologies where the payoff is uncertain \u2013 that is the role of government. Since the 1960s, government-funded R&D has declined [\u2026] We need more long-term investment [\u2026] in technologies where we need to be a global leader to fuel economic prosperity \u2013 because that is what ensures national security.\u201d\n\nBrown\u2019s comments come hot on the heels of claims by Facebook\u2019s CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who yesterday told a hearing convened to discuss his company\u2019s proposed Libra token,\n\n\u201cI hope we can talk about the risks of not innovating. While we debate these issues, the rest of the world isn\u2019t waiting.\u201d\n\n\"China is moving quickly to launch similar ideas in the coming months. Libra will be backed mostly by dollars and I believe it will extend America\u2019s financial leadership as well as our democratic values and oversight around the world. If America doesn\u2019t innovate, our financial leadership is not guaranteed,\" the CEO added.\n\nLast week, Facebook\u2019s blockchain chief David Marcus took a similar tone, warning that Washington efforts to block global stablecoins like Libra would lead to \u201cChina re-wiring [much of the world] with a digital renminbi running on their controlled blockchain.\u201d", "description": "The head of an American government security agency\u2019s tech unit says China has surpassed the United States in cryptocurrency technology \u2013 and warns that his country could face security risks if it continues to shirk away from public spending on innovation.", "authors": ["Tim Alper"], "top_image": "https://cimg.co/w/articles/0/5db/16312afb04.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
