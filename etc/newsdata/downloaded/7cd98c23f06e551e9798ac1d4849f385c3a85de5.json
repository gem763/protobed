And they've dubbed it \u201cCosmic Yeti.\u201d\n\nExperts accidentally spotted the \u201cfootprints\u201d of the huge galaxy. \u201cLike a Cosmic Yeti, the scientific community generally regarded these galaxies as folklore, given the lack of evidence of their existence,\u201d the researchers explained in a statement.\n\nThe signal from the galaxy has taken 12.5 billion years to reach Earth, according to the research, which is published in The Astrophysical Journal.\n\nSPRAWLING GALAXY CLUSTER DISCOVERED 'HIDING IN PLAIN SIGHT'\n\nThe study\u2019s lead author, Christina Williams, an astronomer at the University of Arizona, noticed \u201ca faint light blob\u201d in observations made by the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) telescopes in Chile. \"It was very mysterious because the light seemed not to be linked to any known galaxy at all,\" Williams, a National Science Foundation postdoctoral fellow at the Steward Observatory, said in the statement. \"When I saw this galaxy was invisible at any other wavelength, I got really excited because it meant that it was probably really far away and hidden by clouds of dust.\"\n\nExperts think that the emission observed was caused by the warm glow of dust particles heated by stars that were forming in the galaxy. However, clouds of dust obscure the light from the stars themselves, which made the galaxy \u201ccompletely invisible.\u201d\n\n\"We figured out that the galaxy is actually a massive monster galaxy with as many stars as our Milky Way, but brimming with activity, forming new stars at 100 times the rate of our own galaxy,\u201d co-author Ivo Labb\u00e9, of the Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne, Australia, said in the statement.\n\n'DRAMATIC' BLACK HOLES STUN SCIENTISTS AS 'WIMPY' GALAXIES QUICKLY TRANSFORM INTO 'RAVENOUS' QUASARS\n\nThe discovery could boost scientists\u2019 understanding of how giant galaxies form, the researchers said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFollow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogers", "description": "Astronomers in the U.S. and Australia have spotted a gigantic galaxy from the universe\u2019s dawn that they have dubbed a \u201ccosmic Yeti.\u201d", "authors": ["James Rogers"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/CosmicYeti.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
