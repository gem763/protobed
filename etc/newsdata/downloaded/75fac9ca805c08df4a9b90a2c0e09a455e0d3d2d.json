But less is understood about the issue underlying it all: What drives people to sexually abuse children?\n\nScience in recent years has begun to provide some answers. One thing most pedophiles have in common: They discover, usually as teenagers, that their sexual preferences have not matured like everyone else\u2019s. Most get stuck on the same-age boys or girls who first attracted them at the start of puberty, though some retain interest in far younger children.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t choose what arouses them \u2014 they discover it,\u201d said Dr. Fred Berlin, director of the Johns Hopkins Sex and Gender Clinic. \u201cNo one grows up wanting to be a pedophile.\u201d\n\n[Read The New York Times\u2019s investigation into the spread of online child sex abuse.]\n\nOver the past generation, psychologists, forensic specialists and others have studied pedophilia, a disorder characterized by \u201crecurrent, intense arousing fantasies, urges or behaviors involving sexual activity with a prepubescent child,\u201d according to psychiatry\u2019s diagnostic manual. These experts have interviewed patients in depth, piecing together life histories and performing a variety of psychological and anatomical measures.\n\nWhile no study offers a complete picture, a portrait is emerging \u2014 one that helps elucidate the mental dynamic behind the surge in abuse images and the deepening depravity they depict. These findings also defy common stereotypes about what pedophilia is, and what the risks are for engaging in physical abuse.\n\nA majority of convicted offenders are men who prey on children ages 6 to 17. But women also commit hands-on offenses; rough estimates put the rate of pedophilic attraction at 1 to 4 percent in both men and women. Studies suggest that a small subset of male and female pedophiles have an interest in toddlers, or even infants.\n\nAs scientists seek to understand how the disorder develops, there is growing consensus that the origin is largely biological. This view is based in part on studies pointing to subtle physical traits that have a higher incidence among pedophiles.\n\n\u201cThe biological clues attached to pedophilia demonstrate that its roots are prenatal,\u201d said James Cantor, director of the Toronto Sexuality Center. \u201cThese are not genetic; they can be traced to specific periods of development in the womb.\u201d\n\nPsychological and environmental factors may also contribute, though it is not yet clear what those are or how they interact with developmental conditions.\n\nBy contrast, the common presumption that pedophiles were themselves abused as children now has less support. Child victims are at far greater risk of future substance abuse, depression, persistent traumatic stress or criminal aggression than of becoming molesters. The vast majority of offenders deny any sex abuse in their childhood, even though they could garner sympathy in court by doing so, experts say. \u201cA chaotic childhood increases the likelihood of a chaotic adulthood, of any kind,\u201d Dr. Cantor said.\n\nThe relationship between viewing or collecting images and committing hands-on abuse is a matter of continuing debate among some experts, and one that is critical to evaluating the risk an offender poses. Until recently, the prevailing view was that only a minority of people caught viewing such images, between 5 and 20 percent, also committed physical abuse.\n\nThat perception began to change in 2007, when a pair of psychologists at the Federal Bureau of Prisons reported that 85 percent of convicted online offenders acknowledged in therapy that they had raped or otherwise sexually abused children.\n\nThat finding circulated widely before the study was formally published, creating an uproar among therapists, researchers and law enforcement specialists. The prisons bureau balked at publishing it at all, and withdrew it from a peer-reviewed journal close to its release date.\n\nMany cited concerns that the study sample was biased: It was based on the confessions of 155 convicts who had sought out therapy in prison, not on a representative sample of pedophiles, a much broader group with diverse habits.\n\n\u201cIt was what we call a convenience sample \u2014 that was a legitimate criticism,\u201d said Michael L. Bourke, a co-author of the study with Andres E. Hernandez, in a telephone interview. Dr. Bourke is now chief of the behavioral analysis unit of the United States Marshals.\n\nSince then, several other studies have supported the prison finding, if not precisely the 85 percent number. In one, inspectors from an array of government agencies interviewed 127 online offenders shortly after their arrests. Less than 5 percent admitted to previously molesting at least one child.\n\nWhen agents followed up with more in-depth, polygraph-assisted methods, another 53 percent admitted to hands-on offenses, for a total of nearly 60 percent.\n\n\u201cThis was not a convenience sample; these were offenders, some of whom had downloaded just a single image, with no known history, from all over the country, interviewed by people from different agencies,\u201d Dr. Bourke said. \u201cThey had zero incentive to admit to a previous offense \u2014 very much the opposite.\u201d\n\nThe high rate of previous, hands-on offending undermines another common assumption about pedophiles. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t assume that viewing online images leads to abuse of a child victim in person,\u201d said Joe Sullivan, a specialist in sex crimes against children in Ireland and Britain. \u201cIn my clinical experience, it\u2019s the other way around. Most of these men have already committed hands-on offenses.\u201d\n\nFrom this point of view, downloading abuse images \u2014 and especially connecting with groups of like-minded pedophiles online \u2014 does not awaken latent desires. The desires are very much awake and, in many cases, have already been acted on. But the images and online communities can help erode inhibitions further, drawing pedophiles into more frequent or more aggressive acts, Dr. Bourke said.\n\n\u201cWhat you see, in their search histories,\u201d he said, \u201cis that they learn how to evade law enforcement, they become more confident and they begin to use cognitive distortions to overcome their moral inhibitions.\u201d\n\nSome therapists and researchers say these findings from law enforcement threaten to unfairly tar people who never act on their desires. This group certainly exists \u2014 they\u2019re sometimes called \u201cvirtuous pedophiles\u201d \u2014 but in an era of increasing alarm over the proliferation of online abuse, they are going only further underground.\n\n\u201cThat is a shame, a tragedy,\u201d Dr. Cantor said. \u201cThat is the group we need to learn about. That\u2019s the kind of person we\u2019d like our clients to become, a person who\u2019s aware of the urges and learns to effectively manage them.\u201d\n\nLearning to manage a drive as visceral, and often consuming, as sexual desire is possible, therapists say, but it cannot be shut off; nor can it be replaced, the way heroin can be swapped for methadone. Treatment can require drugs that reduce circulating testosterone and software that limits online browsing habits.\n\nOften, therapy addresses substance abuse as well. Studies suggest that at least 40 percent of sex offenders were using drugs or alcohol when they committed their crimes.\n\n\u201cThe important thing, I think, is that people know that treatment is possible,\u201d Dr. Berlin said. \u201cThere\u2019s a subgroup out there, they refer themselves here, and they are quite convinced that they do not want real-life sex with children.\u201d", "description": "Images of child sex abuse have reached a crisis point on the internet.
