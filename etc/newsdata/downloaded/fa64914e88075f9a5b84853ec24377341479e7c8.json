The group believes prominent conservative journalists, public figures and those with ties to President Donald Trump were being monitored by the State Department in Ukraine under the direction of ousted U.S. Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, who was appointed to her post by President Barack Obama.\n\n\"Judicial Watch has obtained information indicating Yovanovitch may have violated laws and government regulations by ordering subordinates to target certain U.S. persons using State Department resources,\" the watchdog group said in a press release. \"Yovanovitch reportedly ordered monitoring keyed to the following search terms: Biden, Giuliani, Soros and Yovanovitch.\"\n\nSpecifically, Judicial Watch believes the following people were being monitored:\n\nJack Posobiec, One America News Network Host\n\nDonald Trump Jr., son of President Donald Trump\n\nLaura Ingraham, Fox News Host\n\nSean Hannity, Fox News Host\n\nMichael McFaul, President Obama\u2019s Ambassador to Russia\n\nDan Bongino, Fox News Contributor\n\nRyan Saavedra, Reporter at the Daily Wire\n\nRudy Giuliani, President Trump's Personal Attorney\n\nDr. Sebastian Gorka, Former Strategist for President Trump and host of Salem's \"America First\" Radio Program\n\nJohn Solomon, Executive Vice President at The Hill\n\nLou Dobbs, Fox Business Host\n\nPamela Geller, Political Commentator\n\nSara Carter, Investigative Reporter and Fox News Contributor\n\nThe FOIA includes any documents relating to the \"monitoring of any U.S.-based journalist, reporter, or media commentator by any employee or office of the Department of state between January 1, 2019 and the president.\"\n\nAlthough the watchdog group is waiting for the State Department to return paperwork outlining this specific issue, those on the list aren't surprised at the possibility.\n\n\"Don is aware of the report and looks forward to Judicial Watch getting to the bottom of what exactly may have happened here,\" a spokesman for Donald Trump Jr. told Townhall.\n\nFor Dr. Sebastian Gorka, this appears to be the last straw. The Obama administration spied on the Trump campaign and now others in the conservative movement may be under illegal surveillance as well.\n\n\"Not only did Obama\u2019s CIA and FBI illegally surveil the Trump campaign and our White House, we now find out his Ukrainian ambassador had leading conservative names spied upon too,\" Gorka told Townhall. \"The victims of Obama\u2019s latest conspiracy are considering a group legal action action Obama and his accomplices.\"\n\nOne America News Network's Jack Posobiec served in the intelligence community and knows very well that, if true, this surveillance is a direct violation of people's Constitutional rights.\n\n\"I wish I could say I was surprised, but after everything that has come out over the past few years regarding government monitoring for political purposes, I am not. Having served in the intelligence community I am well aware of the restrictions of using national security assets on U.S. persons,\" Posobiec told Townhall. \"These tools must not be used for partisan purposes, regardless of party affiliation.\"\n\n\"If true this is a violation of the First and Fourth Amendments,\" Posobiec said.\n\nHere's a full copy of the FOIA request:", "description": "Wow..10/15/2019 0:24:36AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/256/fe004ad1-7770-42dd-baf4-1b5d338132e4.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
