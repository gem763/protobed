Andy Vasquez, Staff Writer, @andy_vasquez\n\nFLORHAM PARK, N.J. -- Jets general manager Joe Douglas tried to smooth things over with Jamal Adams on Wednesday. Coach Adam Gase tried to talk to his star safety, too.\n\nBut less than 24 hours after publicly criticizing the team on social media, and accusing Douglas of trying to trade him after he asked to remain with the team, Adams wasn't interested in talking to his coach or GM.\n\n\"I'm not ready to talk,\" Adams said. \"That's just where I'm at with it. I'm not in that place right now.\"\n\nAdams admitted Wednesday that he's still angry and hurt that the team \"shopped\" him before Tuesday's trade deadline. And the 24-year-old Pro Bowl safety, who is one of the team's most popular players and has been viewed as one of the cornerstones of the franchise going forward, said he's no longer sure he sees a long-term future with the Jets.\n\n\"I'm excited to be here right now as we speak,\" Adams said. \"But for the future, I don't know. I really don't. I thought I did, but I really don't right now.\"\n\nAdams tweeted later on Wednesday that he was \"past everything,\" though he did not address his long-term future with the team.\n\nNot saying I\u2019m the greatest ever. But you shouldn\u2019t tell a guy you are the cornerstone of the team on Friday, that you won\u2019t be moved, and then negotiate terms with other teams 3 days later...\n\nBut look, I\u2019m at peace with everything! It\u2019s all Luv! https://t.co/uUrZ6lzMAi \u2014 Jamal Adams (@TheAdamsEra) October 30, 2019\n\nLocked in! My focus is on this team and the Dolphins game Sunday. I\u2019m past everything. Looking forward to taking the field and competing. \u2014 Jamal Adams (@TheAdamsEra) October 30, 2019\n\nThe trouble started late last week, when Adams arranged a meeting with Douglas and Gase. Adams has not been able to hide his frustration with losing -- the team is 10-29 in his two plus-seasons -- but he told Douglas and Gase that he didn't want to be traded and he was committed to the franchise long-term.\n\nNFL TRADE WINNERS, LOSERS: Who missed opportunities at deadline?\n\nMORE: Back in the NFL, Steelers QB Paxton Lynch hopes to revive career\n\nBut Adams said on Monday morning he woke up was told by his agent that he was being \"shopped around.\"\n\nDouglas denied that claim multiple times on Tuesday, saying that he had taken calls from teams that were interested in trading for Adams and had \"listened\" to their offers, but never seriously considered making a deal.\n\nThat seems like part of any general manager's job requirement. Picking up the phone when another team calls, listening to offers and gauging the market.\n\nBut Adams didn't see it that way.\n\nHe felt betrayed that the Jets would consider trading him after he called a meeting to tell them he wanted to stay. And he felt offended that the team would even consider dealing a player of his talent level.\n\n\"I know he has a job to do and I respect it,\" Adams said. \"But I hold myself in a high regard. I've done everything they've asked me to do since I've been here for the three years, so I didn't take that lightly. I really didn't.\n\n\"It definitely hurt me. I hold myself at a high level. You know, the Rams, they don't take calls on Aaron Donald. The Patriots don't take calls on Tom Brady. You know what I mean? That's where I hold myself, in that regard. So regardless of how I understand that you have a job to do. That's how I took at it.\"\n\nDouglas said that he never came close to trading Adams, and it has been widely reported that a deal was never imminent. But it clearly wasn't perceived that way by Adams, who made it clear that once he told the Jets he wanted to stay, they should have made him untouchable to other teams.\n\n\"My feelings were definitely hurt. I can strongly say that,\" Adams said. \"Like I said, I hold myself at a high standard. I thought that I was that guy for them. I didn't see them even having talks about it after I told them that I wanted to be here. That's just how I felt about it.\"\n\nHe felt that he \"was on the verge\" of being traded Tuesday, he confirmed the veracity of an ESPN report that he would have been interested in playing for the Cowboys.\n\n\"People got to understand man, I'm born and raised in Dallas,\" Adams said. \"I told [ESPN] that was definitely a spot that I would love to land. But that's not my focus, my focus is right here on the Jets. I'm a Jet. I'm excited to be a Jet. I'm excited to go back out there with the fellas.\"\n\nAdams' remark about being excited to play for the Jets isn't exactly convincing when it preceded a sentence earlier by him saying he would \"love\" to play for another team. And he'll definitely have to smooth things over with some of his teammates, who had no problem with their names being included in trade deadline rumors. And there will be some work to do with the fan base as well.\n\nBut the biggest question is if the relationship between Adams and the Jets can be fixed. Adams said he plans to meet with Gase and Douglas once he's cooled off.\n\n\"There needs to be a talk when I'm ready,\" Adams said. \"Can I say I'm going to fix it? I don't know. I don't know how they're feeling right now. But all I can do is continue to be a professional, continue to be that leader that I am. I'm going to continue to be myself.\"", "description": "Jets general manager Joe Douglas tried to smooth things over with\u00a0Jamal Adams on Wednesday.
