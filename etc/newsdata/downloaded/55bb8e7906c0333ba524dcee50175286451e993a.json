For many of us, it means a string of reviews to write and games to cover. I\u2019ve gone from Monster Hunter to Greedfall and beyond.\n\nGetting the time to circle back and play a game that you missed out on is a fun treat. But hopping back into a game after some time away from it often means you\u2019ve lost the plot, which can be particularly tricky if a game such as Judgment, which is packed with crimes, backstabbing and twists.\n\nWhen Judgment released earlier this year, I enthusiastically jumped in. A new game from the makers of Yakuza, set in the same neon-lit district of Tokyo? A story with murder and fist fights and investigations? Sign me up.\n\nFollowing the tale of private detective Takayuki Yagami as he tangles with yakuza and solve murders was great, but then I had to put the game down to focus on some other games I had to play for work.\n\nAs a result of that, it\u2019s been a while since I jumped back in, and even though I remembered the broad details, and although the game gives bite-sized summaries of recent happenings at the start of each chapter, I\u2019d lost track of the plot.\n\nAlright, Yakuza captain Himura committed a murder but our investigation got him off the hook. Got it. There\u2019s a serial killer called the Mole who is carving out their victim\u2019s eyes. Sure, I remember that.\n\nOK, wait. The masked kid I met was a burglar, and now I have to go to a nightclub to talk to a girl who\u2026 maybe knows something? Crap, what was her name? And how is she connected to this? Oh, no. I am the worst detective.\n\nAt least Judgment\u2019s plot isn\u2019t as convoluted as something like Yakuza 6: The Song of Life. That game started with a simple mystery: Who attacked protagonist Kazuma Kiryu\u2019s daughter-figure and who was the father of her newborn child?\n\nIt ballooned out, as Yakuza games do, into a complicated affair involving warring triads, vengeful criminals and some type of battleship hidden in Hiroshima. Those exaggerated schemes are part of Yakuza\u2019s soap-opera charm.\n\nJudgment is closer to a crime procedural, so the high-level plot is straightforward. There\u2019s a serial killer and Yagami\u2019s on the case, even as it seems that the murderer is less a random criminal and instead tied to a major pharmaceutical company. The little details are where things get hazy.\n\nYagami is always in the middle of his investigation, always chasing a lead no matter how big or small. That might mean getting new evidence from a crooked cop or following a suspicious person through the streets. Imagine playing Phoenix Wright and leaving a case half-finished. That\u2019s what returning to Judgment feels like.\n\nI also feel excited when I do manage to remember the details. By returning after so much time, I can experience the sense that I\u2019m not just progressing the investigation but reacquainting myself with likeable characters and getting back on the same page as them.\n\nMuch like getting lost in a big open world can lead to new discoveries or comfortable wandering, resubmerging yourself into a twisty plot offers a chance to let the imagination flex. Judgment is a fabulous game and each new swerve only heightens my investment. Relearning the plot and characters has been a lot of fun, and I can\u2019t wait to see where it goes next.", "description": "The end of the year is always busy here at Kotaku.
