who characterises himself as an anti-sexual abuse campaigner, said he did not meet Assange in person because he was being held in an isolation unit due to safety concerns.\n\nBut in an interview with his former employer Rebel Media, Robinson said Assange\u2019s room in a separate health ward overlooked an exercise yard he used.\n\nHe claimed they spent half an hour talking through a window, in one session shortly before his release.\n\nThe Independent understands that the layout of HMP Belmarsh makes such conversations possible, but none were formally witnessed or recorded by prison staff.\n\nSome of Robinson\u2019s supporters said they would write letters of support to Assange, after characterising both men as \u201cpolitical prisoners\u201d.\n\nAssange\u2019s representatives could not immediately confirm Robinson\u2019s account.\n\nSince his release, Robinson has also announced his support for the prime minister, and said the 21 \u201cpurged\u201d MPs \u201caren\u2019t actually Conservatives\u201d.\n\n\u201cI actually like Boris Johnson, I think he\u2019s shown himself as a very strong leader,\u201d he said. \u201cThe battle that\u2019s commencing is Boris Johnson, Eton-educated, representing the people [over Brexit].\u201d", "description": "Tommy Robinson has announced his support for\u00a0Julian Assange\u00a0after being freed from prison.\u00a0 The English
