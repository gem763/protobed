Picking up a year and a half after the events of the previous game, Trails of Cold Steel III stars a compelling mix of new and old characters and features a slick new streamlined battle system I can\u2019t wait to dive into. But I have to wait. Try as I might, I can\u2019t bring myself to play this game until I finish the first two.\n\nWith our resident The Legend of Heroes fan, Jason Schreier, on leave, I figured I would tackle the latest entry in the Trails of Cold Steel quadrilogy. Though I missed The Legend of Heroes\u2019 Gagharv trilogy on the PSP, I\u2019ve played a whole lot of the nigh-legendary Trails in the Sky.\n\nI\u2019ve also played the first couple of hours of The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel I, which Jason called \u201cbasically Suikoden meets Persona,\u201d which to me is one of the best-sounding endorsements for any game ever. I\u2019m also a huge fan of Nihon Falcom\u2019s other massive RPG series, Ys, which is a series of standalone games featuring the same protagonist. How hard could hopping directly into Trails of Cold Steel III possibly be?\n\nPretty hard, at least for me. The opening sequence of the game, a pitched battle in a military fortress, introduces me to a gaggle of anime-style characters with colourful hair. They\u2019re the latest students in Thors Military Academy\u2019s Class VII, a special class made up of a mix of super-talented commoners and nobles from throughout the Erebonian Empire, established in the first Trails of Cold Steel game. The students from the first two games are now instructors, having grown and matured over the course of two 60+ hour role-playing games that I\u2019ve not finished playing.\n\nI have no clue how Rean Schwarzer, Alisa Reinford, Elliot Craig, Laura Arseid, Machias Regnitz, Emma Millstein, Jusis Albarea, Gaius Worzel and Fie Claussel, the original Class VII, have fared over the events of the first two games. I can find out easily enough.\n\nI could hop on a wiki page or watch let\u2019s play videos on YouTube. Trails of Cold Steel III includes an extensive \u201cStory Summary\u201d section. It features multi-chapter summaries for each game and character bios for students, teachers, enemies, and other characters. It\u2019s even got a \u201cWorld Introduction\u201d section that goes over the geography, politics, religion and technology of the world of Zemuria.\n\nMost people would be satisfied with that amount of background. I just can\u2019t help feeling that I am missing out not having experienced the adventures of Rean and crew firsthand. As I played through the first 20 minutes of Cold Steel III, seen in the video above, I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that I would get much more out of it had I experienced the previous games directly.\n\nOne day I will get to enjoy Cold Steel III\u2019s sweet new battle interface.\n\nI\u2019m nearly a dozen hours into The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel (the first one, not the third one). I\u2019m having an amazing time getting to know the first batch of students from Class VII. I\u2019m speeding a little, but I can\u2019t help it. From what I\u2019ve played so far, there\u2019s a really cool third game waiting for me once I get through these first two.", "description": "The third game in Nihon Falcom\u2019s The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel JRPG series finally arrives in the West for the PlayStation 4 today.
