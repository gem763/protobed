Through years of research and interviews with a diverse cross-section of men, she explores the ways that toxic ideas about masculinity push men into undue suffering, stifling their emotions, their friendships, their health, their professional and social fulfillment, their interactions with women, and their literal lifespans.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re forcing people into boxes that don\u2019t serve them or society,\u201d Plank said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m interested in how transformative it can be for us to just have 1 percent of this conversation. Just for one guy to ask himself one question, I think, would be fundamentally huge for our society.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the Love of Men\u201d effectively makes the case that the time for talking openly and honestly about masculinity was forever ago, and therefore we need to start immediately. And the stakes could not be higher. As Plank writes in the introduction to her book: \u201cThere is no greater threat to humankind than our current definitions of masculinity.\u201d\n\nWe got into what that means for men, how Gen Z is changing prevailing cultural ideas about gender, and how women can responsibly participate in the dialogue about masculinity.\n\nHuffPost: So why write a book about masculinity?\n\nLiz Plank: A lot of people were surprised that I would write about men, and I was not as surprised as everyone else. Once I started reading about it and researching and talking to men, I realized that in my own education around feminism and gender theory \u2015 I have a master\u2019s degree in gender \u2015 there was so much I\u2019d actually not learned about masculinity. And it made me really angry, because there\u2019s a whole half of the population that is missing from conversations around gender theory, and there\u2019s no way for us to really solve any of our problems if we\u2019re not talking about men and how they also have a relationship with their gender. We equate gender with women, when actually, everyone has a gender.\n\nWe talk a lot about the pain that women are experiencing as a result of men, but we don\u2019t really talk about how a lot of the pain that men are inflicting is coming from pain that they\u2019re experiencing. Liz Plank\n\nWas there any particular moment that lit the spark for this book?\n\nPlank: I was eating spicy ramen with my sister in the East Village, where all good ideas happen. It is actually a good [reminder] that our most creative ideas happen when we\u2019re relaxed and having fun and not necessarily trying to come up with your next book that you\u2019re going to spend four years working on. My sister and I were joking about how we have struggled a lot with men in our lives, and at the time she was dealing with a particular man in her life. And we were joking there should be a guidebook so that men know how to be men. And a woman should write it, because men are always telling us what to do and how to be women.\n\nAnd so it started a journey. I rewrote [the book] three times, because the more research I did, the more interviewing I did, the more I realized how much was missing from this conversation. We talk a lot about the pain that women are experiencing as a result of men, but we don\u2019t really talk about how a lot of the pain that men are inflicting is coming from pain that they\u2019re experiencing. And that gives you a very different perspective on men from a feminist perspective, when you\u2019re not just mad at them and assuming that they\u2019re bad, but assuming that they are good and that something makes them engage in bad behaviors.\n\nWhat does the pressure to constantly prove one\u2019s masculinity over and over and over again do to men, specifically perhaps North American men?\n\nPlank: There aren\u2019t a lot of studies about masculinity, but there are a lot of studies that show the link between when men absorb these messages around traditional masculinity. So I don\u2019t think masculinity is a problem, I think masculinity is the solution. I grew up understanding this idea of the man who\u2019s invulnerable and who\u2019s silent and who\u2019s alone and never asks for help. The classic example is the Marlboro Man. Try and imagine [him] or someone like Donald Trump going to therapy. The reason why you can\u2019t imagine that is because men like Donald Trump don\u2019t go to therapy. But imagine what the world would look like if Donald Trump had gone to therapy.\n\nOh man. The number of men I would love the power to personally send into therapy...\n\nPlank: Right, exactly. And so there\u2019s huge power there. But the men who identify the most with traditional masculinity and with these ideas that I was talking about are the least likely to seek psychological help, they\u2019re the least likely to go to the doctor, they\u2019re the least likely to seek preventative care. That should worry everyone. And you see how that plays out in all of our society. Men are less likely to wear sunscreen, men are less likely to wear seatbelts, men are more likely to drown.\n\nI was a lifeguard, and in our lifeguard training, we learned that 80 percent of deaths related to drowning involve men, so it\u2019s almost a uniquely male experience. And yet we don\u2019t talk about drowning as a gendered experience! And the only reason is not because men are worse at swimming than women, they have equal aquatic abilities. But men take more risks. Men are less likely to wear life jackets. They are also more likely to think that they\u2019re better swimmers than they actually are. By the way, the studies found that women and men [both] overestimate men\u2019s abilities at swimming. These are not things that are biologically ingrained, these are things that are socially learned. And so if we are to challenge some of those ideas and some of those preconceptions, imagine how different the world will look.\n\n\u201cToxic masculinity\u201d is a term that gets thrown around a lot, both in academia and online, but it appears very infrequently in the book. Why is that?\n\nPlank: Originally, I had it [in the book] maybe 267 times. It was a challenge to figure out a way to talk about this problem without using the term because that\u2019s the term that\u2019s most widely used. I reached out to Michael Kimmel and I reached out to Jackson Katz, who are two of the foremost experts on masculinity, and they both separately confirmed to me that it was a term that they would not really use when they were working with men. I had a lot of pushback for this, but I decided to not use it. I think it shows up only in the quotes that men use, because I obviously am not going to change the way that people express themselves. And maybe a few times [there are references to] \u201ctoxic ideals of masculinity\u201d or \u201ctoxic ideas.\u201d But I try not to use it because it\u2019s loaded.\n\nThe first person who really challenged me in an interview was [gun control activist] David Hogg. I asked David Hogg if he believed that there was a link between toxic masculinity and school shootings. And he said, \u201cYou know what? I don\u2019t really think this term useful.\u201d He is one of the hugely important people challenging beliefs around gun violence and gun safety, and he\u2019s very aware of terms that make people listen to you or not listen to you. And he challenged me to think about that.\n\nWas there anything else striking you learned about masculinity from interviewing younger men like Hogg?\n\nThey don\u2019t even think gender is a thing. They know that it\u2019s made up. As children, we believe that gender is flexible and changeable. So if you ask children before the age of six, they believe that if Emma\u2019s wearing a dress, then she\u2019s a girl. And if Emma wears pants, well, she can be a boy. So gender can be something that changes. But then somehow when we grow up, we watch TV, we talk to our friends, we get called names, and we adopt these beliefs that are not rooted in science and not rooted in truth and we make up these rules. And so it was really nice to be challenged by a younger generation.\n\nThat\u2019s one of the reasons why I\u2019m really excited about this conversation about masculinity, because to me it\u2019s not just a conversation about masculinity, it\u2019s a conversation around making the feminist movement gender-neutral. Is it productive to equate feminism with women and to equate women-only spaces with feminism? I don\u2019t think so. If the whole point of feminism is gender equality, then shouldn\u2019t everyone be welcome to the table? And gender non-binary people too, who are already left out of all of these conversations. When we just make it about women, we\u2019re just excluding so many people who have so much value to add.\n\nDid the process of writing this book change the way you personally talk about masculinity?\n\nPlank: I think that there\u2019s been a lot of counterproductive conversation around men and masculinity, and I regret some of the things [I\u2019ve said]. We all regret tweets. I want to put it out there right now before someone goes on a tirade and says, \u201cLook, she tweeted \u2018cancel men\u2019 in 2014.\u201d And I probably did, because I was mad and enraged and sad and traumatized. But I think it\u2019s important for us to process our pain, because I want men to process their pain so that they stop inflicting it on us.\n\nD. Picard Author and journalist Liz Plank spent four years researching and writing her new book on masculinity.\n\nHow did you go about finding men to interview? Because you obviously dedicated a lot of time and energy to finding men to speak to, and specifically finding a very diverse cross-section of men to speak to.\n\nPlank: A lot of the people that I ended up interviewing were people that I was working with or people I was friends with, or men that I really admired. D\u2019Arcee Cherrington is one example \u2015 he\u2019s gay, black, and has a disability. I interviewed him for an article a couple years ago when he had to crawl out of a United flight because they didn\u2019t bring him his wheelchair. And so he was one of the first people that I thought of for the book. if there\u2019s a person that I want to talk about masculinity with, it\u2019s not, I don\u2019t know, some white guy. It\u2019s not Joe Biden. Although I would still like to talk to Joe Biden about masculinity.\n\nJoe Biden, if you are reading this interview, you can hit Liz up.\n\nPlank: You can DM me. But I think the conversation around masculinity is so much more rich when you talk to people who don\u2019t fit neatly into the standard of masculinity that we have in our society.\n\nSome of the most fascinating conversations were also with men on Facebook. I love my Facebook community. I would be reading something, and writing a book is spending a lot of time on your own and being alone with your thoughts and going crazy. And so sometimes I would just ask them really simple questions, like, \u201cWhat was a toy that you wanted to play with as a child that you were told you weren\u2019t allowed to play with?\u201d The thread that ensued was just totally heartbreaking and beautiful. So many [men] denied Easy Bake Ovens. Because God forbid men would know how to cook or be interested in cooking. There are very simple questions [about gender] that women are asked all the time and women ask themselves all the time. And so why aren\u2019t men asking each other these questions?\n\nWhat are some of the biggest takeaways from your years of research?\n\nPlank: I think one of the biggest takeaways for me in terms of the \u201cjourney\u201d of this book, if this book was \u201cThe Bachelor,\u201d [is] that we far undersell the benefits of feminism to the lives of men. The way we talk about gender equality is all wrong and the framing of these conversations is all wrong. I grew up believing that if we are talking about women and you bring up men in this conversation, you are doing a disservice to women. And I realized that is actually fundamentally wrong. And in fact, we have been hurting women by not talking about men.\n\nAnd [one of] the other big takeaways, which I end on, is the idea of Marie Kondo-ing your gender. That we just need to tidy up. And with men, it feels huge and it feels like, \u201cI need to go through this whole transformational journey of understanding my trauma.\u201d And it\u2019s like, yeah, but what you really gotta do is just learn to get to know yourself a little bit. It\u2019s really just about self-discovery. Open up the closet, go in the back where you don\u2019t often go and things have been piling up for years. And some junk you might want to keep, and that\u2019s great. You should keep whatever you want to hold on to. But there\u2019s a lot there that you might not want to hold on to it and you didn\u2019t even know you were holding onto. So it\u2019s about empowering people to have the freedom to be who they want to be in the world and the freedom to let go of things that don\u2019t serve them. And questioning a lot of the \u201ctruths\u201d that we have about men.\n\nIt\u2019s still commonly believed that men think with their penises, and testosterone makes men violent, and testosterone is what caused the financial crisis, and if you put men together, they\u2019re just going to create chaos. But there\u2019s one human species and we\u2019re more identical than we are different. We\u2019re forcing people into boxes that don\u2019t serve them or society. And I\u2019m interested in how transformative it can be for us to just have 1 percent of this conversation. Just for one guy to ask himself one question, I think, would be fundamentally huge for our society.\n\nSo then what role do women play in this conversation? How can women productively engage the men in their lives \u2015 and each other \u2015 on these topics?\n\nPlank: Women are oppressed and [many of] our lives are traumatic. I am white, middle class, able-bodied, cisgendered and just came out as queer. And I feel I\u2019ve had so many different deplorable experiences with men and boys. So that doesn\u2019t go away and that will always stay with us.\n\nAt the same time, [I write about] realizing how I was playing into some of these myths about masculinity, and how I was expecting men to be very similar to the false expectations that we had of them. I talk about going on a chivalry diet and basically deciding I\u2019m not going to let guys pay any more, I\u2019m not going to accept these grand gestures. And then being like, but I want the guy to open the door for me, and realizing how fundamental that was to my identity, or how fundamental it was to my relationship with men, and that I valued those things. So how could I, on the one hand, say, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? You don\u2019t have to be the provider, you don\u2019t have to be the strong guy, you don\u2019t have to do these things. Women just want you to be sensitive and caring.\u201d And it\u2019s like, no, we don\u2019t just want those things. We don\u2019t just want you to be sensitive and caring.\n\nWe were raised in the system. It\u2019s all of our responsibility to disrupt it. But that\u2019s exciting. That means we have the power. Liz Plank\n\nWe\u2019re all raised in this culture.\n\nWe\u2019re all raised in this culture and we\u2019re all products of it. And so we have to take responsibility, but also take away this individual guilt that we have that we\u2019re participating in this. We were raised in the system. It\u2019s all of our responsibility to disrupt it. But that\u2019s exciting. That means we have the power. Yes, there\u2019s a system, but we\u2019re all part of the system. And so if we don\u2019t like the system and we don\u2019t like the way that things are going, we can change it.\n\nAnd the positive thing about that is that yeah, I gave up all my free drinks, but I also got so much more from those relationships and I learned so much about myself. And once you don\u2019t fall into predetermined rules, you decide which rules you want to hold in the relationship, and the power dynamics are very different. And it opened up a whole new world in terms of relationships for me.\n\nWhy is it urgent for men to be confronting their gender identity and for women to be engaging with men of on the topic of gender?\n\nWe\u2019re really late, but that doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s too late. It is like climate change. I feel like we\u2019re at a time that\u2019s really transformative but also stressful, because we\u2019re realizing how fucked we are. You can put that in. We\u2019re really screwed and we have accepted a version of reality that is false. We\u2019ve accepted that, for example, politicians are supposed to take money from lobbyists, and politicians are supposed to fund their campaigns through the coal mining industry, and men are supposed to die on the job more than women and do these really dangerous jobs. Men are supposed to make more money than women.\n\nAnd then when they don\u2019t, when we realize that that\u2019s not a sustainable model and that\u2019s not true, that requires us figuring out how to work toward finding an alternative. And that\u2019s exciting. But like all big changes, it requires a lot of work.\n\nJust in terms of the environment, if we were to look at one thing, men are less likely to recycle than women. Men are less likely to use tote bags than women because they\u2019re viewed as feminine. We can laugh at that because it\u2019s ridiculous. But then you think about the consequences of that. And so yeah, it\u2019s absolutely urgent for anyone to be free to care about the survival of the human species.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.", "description": "Liz Plank's \"For the Love of Men\" makes the case for a compassionate and urgent dialogue about, between and for the benefit of men.", "authors": ["Senior Women'S Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7686c83b0000a984d0c3a1.jpeg?cache=0ghcxi2l3v&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
