We may think we\u2019re talking about the same innate quality of mind, but one person\u2019s \u201csmart\u201d is another person\u2019s \u201cstupid.\u201d As much as we use \u201cintelligence\u201d to describe technical expertise and reasoned judgment, it has also been the go-to explanation for success. Depending on who has successfully secured power, different qualities have been called intelligence at different points in history.\n\nGiven the instability of intelligence, it\u2019s no use trying to claim that Trump is stupid. Instead, the best way forward for Democrats is to move beyond intelligence and speak to the specific judgment and capabilities a candidate must have \u2014 the kind of intelligence we want in a president \u2014 in order to face the enormous challenges of leading the country.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne of the most historically significant elections in the United States involved loud debate over what constituted intelligence. John Quincy Adams, the well-educated incumbent president smeared his 1828 Democratic opponent and heated rival by accusing him of bad spelling. That opponent was Andrew Jackson, who like Trump overcame charges of being dangerously ignorant and crass to win the presidency.\n\nJackson\u2019s supporters responded to allegations that he was unfit for the presidency by arguing that while it may be true that Adams was the \u201cable diplomatist and elegant writer,\u201d Jackson\u2019s \u201cvigorous judgment,\u201d \u201cfrank temper,\u201d \u201cfree hand\u201d and \u201cvaliant heart,\u201d made him an example of \u201cintellectual superiority,\u201d and a \u201cman of genius.\u201d Jackson launched an age of expanded white male suffrage and with it, a more democratic meaning of intelligence as natural charisma and force of will: something altogether different from the refinement, knowledge and circumspection Adams offered.\n\nEvery campaign since has involved talk of intelligence, but in each case, the concept was sufficiently malleable to promote the virtues of very different candidates. Nathaniel Hawthorne boosted Franklin Pierce, the 1852 Democratic presidential nominee, by claiming he had \u201cthe stately endowment of administrative genius,\u201d apparently a natural talent for managing the government. Abraham Lincoln was, on the one hand \u201cHonest Abe, the Rail Splitter,\u201d and at the same time the natural-born lawyer \u2014 a mark of distinction in lawyer-obsessed America. One campaign biography in 1860 claimed that \u201chis strong, natural, direct, and irresistible logic marked him \u2026 as an intellectual king.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe late 19th century saw the rise of a new paragon of mental ability that would eventually seep into politics: the businessman. University-trained psychologists had very little regard for men of business. Francis Galton, a cousin of Charles Darwin and the inventor of the word \u201ceugenic\u201d placed men of commerce in a middling stratum in his 1869 treatise Hereditary Genius. In the 1920s, psychologist Catherine Miles Cox compiled a list of historical geniuses with Shakespeare, Goethe and Lincoln at the top the list; \u201ccaptains of industry\u201d like Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller were nowhere to be found.\n\nBut outside university halls, genius and business did go hand in hand. In 1886, The Christian Union, the organ of Henry Ward Beecher, a Congregationalist preacher and promoter of free enterprise, declared that \u201cMr. Carnegie shows real genius.\u201d Ubiquitous pocket guides carried around by ambitious clerks celebrated business acumen, defining genius as \u201cjudgment and an intuitive perception of the fitness of traffic and the relationship of demand and supply, with executive ability.\u201d According to the survival-of-the-fittest logic of the late 19th century, many believed business success was the ultimate evidence of native intelligence. So in 1920, the United States elected its first businessman to the presidency: Warren Harding, a Republican newspaper magnate.\n\nAs the ineffectual Harding\u2019s election proves, the ever-changing concept of intelligence did little to dispel the ambiguity about who really had the capacity for office. This was true even in an age that featured the use of the new IQ test. Originally developed in France to determine which children needed extra help in school, it was composed of a series of fill-in-the-blank questions that demanded quick comprehension and prediction. According to its originator Alfred Binet, it wasn\u2019t true that those who did poorly were dangers to the gene pool; they simply had trouble paying attention, an ability that his own teaching methods proved can be developed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFar from becoming the great judge of merit psychologists hoped it would be, in the United States, IQ did little more than serve as a flimsy excuse to set up immigration quotas and justify the forced sterilization of people deemed \u201cfeeble minded.\u201d When Trump uses the term, he invokes this racist and xenophobic legacy of IQ rather than its practical applications.\n\nThe New Deal era saw the rise of the \u201ctechnocracy,\u201d a new veneration for highly trained, and technically competent government officials whose decisions were driven by science. But even this veneration for expertise did not corner the market on the sort of \u201cintelligence\u201d that voters looked to when choosing a president. While Democrats chose the U.S. Naval Academy-educated engineer Jimmy Carter, the Rhodes Scholar Bill Clinton and the Harvard-trained lawyer Barack Obama as presidential standard bearers, Republicans in the late 20th century gravitated more toward politicians with swagger and non-bookish success like the Hollywood actor Ronald Reagan and the proud C-student and baseball team owner George W. Bush. What Democrats celebrated as technical expertise came across to critics as pretentious, empty and ineffectual, and what Democrats saw as signs of ineptitude and ignorance Republicans interpreted as marks of intuition, persuasive power and guts.\n\nThis complicated history of what constitutes intelligence or proof of intellectual prowess helps explain how many of Trump\u2019s critics can see him as grossly unqualified and lacking the knowledge and capacity to be president, while his supporters respect his acumen and see him as a man whose intelligence is proven by his success.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat we mean by \u201cintelligent\u201d or \u201cgenius\u201d ultimately depends on the kind of proof we look for. Trump\u2019s supporters see him as smart because he\u2019s formidable and has a long history as a prominent businessman: his unscrupulous business practices and ethical foibles are explained as being shrewd, his unwillingness to release his tax returns like past presidents, a symbol of his business success and by extension, a sign of his intelligence.\n\nBy contrast, his opponents focus on his stumbles: from claiming that there were airports during the Revolutionary War, to his run of the mill day-to-day inaccuracies, to his constant spelling errors and typos, all offer up proof of mental inferiority.\n\nThe history of intelligence shows that no matter how many of these stumbles there are, Trump\u2019s critics will never be able to convince his supporters that the president is not smart enough to be president.\n\nAD", "description": "The definition of genius has never been stable.", "authors": ["Ittai Orr", "Ittai Orr Is A Doctoral Candidate In American Studies At Yale University Studying The History Of Intelligence."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ZHfIrh0UEG7R5R-cRWgDuIS_L8U=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/O2TQY3G6MMI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
