Instead, consumers are opting for larger sport utility vehicles.\n\n\u201cOur industry is eager to move as fast as possible towards zero-emission mobility. But this transition is a shared responsibility,\u201d said PSA Group Chief Executive Carlos Tavares, who is also president of European auto industry association ACEA. \u201cIt requires a 360 degrees approach.\u201d\n\n\u201cGovernments across the EU need to match the increasing pace at which we are launching these cars by dramatically stepping up investments in infrastructure. Moreover, they also have to put in place sustainable purchase incentives that are consistent across the EU,\u201d Tavares said.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Ilona Wissenbach; Writing by Edward Taylor; Editing by Mark Potter)", "description": "Europe's carmakers are telling governments they must help build electric car charging points and provide consumer subsidies to boost sales of battery-powered vehicles and assist the industry in meeting stringent new emissions rules.
