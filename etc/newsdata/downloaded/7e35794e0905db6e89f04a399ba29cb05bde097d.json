But $US12 billion had already fled the country since the primary and economists say Argentina remains vulnerable to a market meltdown unless the election victor acts quickly.\n\n\u201cThe agenda is the same whoever wins,\u201d says one chief executive of a major Argentine company. \u201cExchange controls will have to stay in place, debt needs to be rescheduled and the market remains closed for now to Argentina and its companies ... then there is high public spending, the budget deficit and runaway inflation: any economic programme has to lower inflation.\u201d\n\nThere are fears a Peronist return to power would mean a repeat of interventionist, big-state policies. Getty Images\n\nThe most urgent need is to renegotiate Argentina\u2019s debt, which shot up under Mr Macri\u2019s administration, largely as a result of the record $US57 billion IMF bailout programme which he sought amid a currency crisis last year.\n\n\u201cThere is very little that a new government can do without a deal with the IMF and the rescheduling of [bondholder] debt,\u201d says Eduardo Levy Yeyati, dean of the school of government at Torcuato Di Tella university in Buenos Aires. \u201cWithout this double deal, it is very hard for Argentina to grow.\u201d\n\nIn need of a debt deal\n\nThe problem, Levy says, is that Argentina needs a debt deal quickly to avoid running out of money, and private sector creditors are unlikely to agree to one unless they are offered generous terms. The fund, however, is smarting from the travails of its biggest-ever loan and is likely to press for bondholders to take sizeable losses to ensure that it is not accused of lending public money to rescue private investors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Catch-22 with the timing,\u201d says Levy.\n\nThe IMF has not made further disbursements on its loan to Argentina since August\u2019s market crash. Its new head, Kristalina Georgieva, said last week that the fund remained \u201cfully committed to work with Argentina\u201d and was \u201cvery interested to see what policy framework would be put in place\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut with Fern\u00e1ndez the likely election victor, the fund is preparing for uncomfortable talks. The Peronist candidate has been sharply critical of the IMF during his campaign, alleging that it should share responsibility for the country\u2019s plight with Macri, and accusing it of facilitating capital flight with its record-breaking loan. \u201cBut nothing [Fern\u00e1ndez] has said so far indicates that it will not be possible to work out an agreement,\u201d says an international financier close to the discussions.\n\nA wider concern among the business community in Buenos Aires is over the policies Fern\u00e1ndez may follow to revive the sickly economy.\n\nAs cabinet chief under the 2003-07 Peronist presidency of N\u00e9stor Kirchner, Fern\u00e1ndez was known as a pragmatic moderate. He continued in the post when Kirchner\u2019s wife and his current running mate, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, became president, only to resign in July 2008 over her decision to impose heavy export taxes on the country\u2019s farmers.\n\nFern\u00e1ndez has since largely stayed out of the limelight, juggling his time between working as a political consultant, a lawyer and a university lecturer, until Fern\u00e1ndez announced in May that she would run as vice-president on a ticket with him. The move was widely seen as a masterstroke, allowing Fern\u00e1ndez a partial return to power despite high voter rejection rates after presiding over a period of poor economic management and rampant public corruption.\n\nSo far, the strategy has worked. Fern\u00e1ndez has campaigned across the country while his vice-presidential candidate has been largely absent, often abroad in Cuba visiting a sick daughter.\n\nPolitical analysts say this dynamic could change after the pair win power. \u201cAlberto Fern\u00e1ndez is a transparent Trojan horse,\u201d says Tonelli, the political scientist. \u201cYou can see straight through him: in his belly is Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner.\u201d\n\nTerribly complicated\n\nPedro S\u00e1nchez, a trucker in the northern city of Resistencia is, like many voters, backing Fern\u00e1ndez through gritted teeth.\n\n\u201cI have my doubts about Alberto. After all, he is from the Kirchners\u2019 inner circle,\u201d says S\u00e1nchez, who voted for Macri in 2015 because he was tired of the corruption and authoritarianism associated with the Kirchners. He feels \u201ccheated\u201d over the dire economic situation but is not optimistic that the new president will do any better. \u201cGoverning Argentina must be very difficult. It is very unpredictable and Argentines are terribly complicated people \u2014 but that is just how we are.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTonelli says one of Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s first challenges after a win would be to define his relationship with his running mate. \u201cThey hated each other [when he resigned] and they still hate each other,\u201d he says. \u201cBut she has most of the political structure of Kirchnerism and most of the votes, and Alberto has nothing ... It will be very difficult for him. He is caught between the rock of the IMF and the hard place of Kirchnerism.\u201d\n\nOpinions differ on how active Fern\u00e1ndez might be as vice-president but there is general agreement that she will want to extricate herself from nine separate corruption investigations dating back to her time in power.\n\n\u201cHer No. 1 priority is to get herself and her family out of legal trouble,\u201d says Walter Stoeppelwerth, chief investment officer at Portfolio Personal Inversiones in Buenos Aires. \u201cAnd Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s No. 1 priority is to make her problems go away. He is many things but he isn\u2019t dumb. He is very smart, although he is not surrounded by the smartest people.\u201d\n\nAs well as the potential tension with his former boss, analysts fear Fern\u00e1ndez will struggle to hold together a disparate coalition that ranges from orthodox economists to radical social activists with little in common apart from an interest in seeing the end of Macri\u2019s government.\n\nMauricio Macri has been criticised as a man who governs for the rich. Bloomberg\n\n\u201cThis coalition will not be a long-lasting one,\u201d says Jimena Blanco, head of Americas research at Verisk Maplecroft, a risk consultancy. \u201cIt will eventually fracture because of conflicting policy and ideological views within it \u2014 the question is not if but when.\u201d\n\nPowerful union movement\n\nMany are concerned about how much sway La C\u00e1mpora \u2014 a militant youth movement founded by Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s son, M\u00e1ximo Kirchner \u2014 could hold in a Peronist administration.\n\nArgentina\u2019s powerful union movement has also long been a thorn in the side of governments, leveraging industrial action into higher wages.\n\nThe new president will also have to deal with groups such as the Workers\u2019 Confederation of the Popular Economy (CTEP). Fiercely independent and capable of mobilising large numbers of discontented jobless workers, CTEP strikes fear in the heart of Argentina\u2019s middle classes, recently leading noisy protests in upmarket shopping malls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere is a question mark over how Alberto\u2019s political personality will develop once he becomes a leader. No one knows,\u201d says Juan Grabois, a pugnacious 36-year-old lawyer and outspoken leader of CTEP, which is aligned with Fernandez\u2019s Peronist coalition. \u201cI hope he will try to relieve the pain of the most poor and contain the voracity of some economic groups that want fast and easy profits.\u201d\n\nGrabois recently proposed radical land reform that included expropriating 50,000 plots of land and banning any Argentine from owning more than 5,000 hectares. Fern\u00e1ndez distanced himself from the proposals.\n\nFern\u00e1ndez has almost entirely avoided interviews or news conferences with international media during his campaign and has only sketched vague outlines of his economic policy, which centres on renegotiating debt, a national pact to control inflation and reviving growth by boosting domestic consumption. Perhaps his most important decision, assuming he wins, will be the choice of finance minister. The appointee will lead the complex debt renegotiations with the IMF and private bondholders, as well as having the task of reviving the floundering economy.\n\nThe inner circle\n\nThe two names most often mentioned from his inner circle are his economic advisers Matias Kulfas and Cecilia Todesca, who held senior roles at the central bank during Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s presidency but are considered inexperienced. Martin Redrado, Guillermo Nielsen and Emmanuel Alvarez Agis, all senior economic officials during the Kirchner years, are seen as more \u201cmarket-friendly\u201d candidates.\n\nAnother decision will be how open Argentina remains to the rest of the world for trade and investment. \u201cBeing open to the world doesn\u2019t mean being stupid,\u201d says one source close to Fern\u00e1ndez. \u201cMacri surrendered to the world naked. We want a relationship with the world that benefits Argentina.\u201d\n\nGustavo Grobocopatel, chief executive of the Grupo Los Grobo agribusiness, says one of the most important aims after the election is to achieve a calm handover. \u201cEvery time the government changes, there is a crisis and everything starts again from zero.\u201d\n\nArgentina, adds Tonelli, is \u201cnot so much a stop-go economy as a crash-go economy\u201d.\n\nThere is little optimism about the capacity of a new government to tackle deeply rooted economic problems. \u201cThe state of Argentina\u2019s economy is no more than a symptom of our culture,\u201d says Eduardo Costantini, a billionaire real estate developer and art collector. \u201cIt is not a [question of] technical error.\u201d\n\nAt the heart of Argentina\u2019s problem is its refusal to live within its means, he argues, pointing out that the peso has lost 98 per cent of its value against the American dollar in successive devaluations since 1991.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t accept here the trade-offs needed to reduce inflation,\u201d he says, joking drily that in Argentina austerity is a \u201cforbidden word\u201d.", "description": "The winner of Sunday's election will be left with one of the world's biggest economic messes and will have to urgently renegotiate the IMF deal.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4215%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_338%2C$y_268/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1ff803ec8dd5746845542a8aca1418ed86b8238e", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
