And while the choice of tournament might seem surprising \u2013 especially given that Murray has never played here before \u2013 it makes sense in terms of his personal life.\n\nMurray\u2019s wife Kim is expecting their third child imminently, he revealed last week. And after the tension of the 2016 Australian Open \u2013 which he spent nervously waiting with his bags packed, in case his eldest daughter Sophia should arrive early \u2013 he wanted to be nearer at hand this time.\n\n\u201cThe main reason is that it\u2019s the closest tournament to home for me, and my wife is quite pregnant right now,\u201d said Murray on Monday, in his first interview at Antwerp\u2019s Lotto Arena. \u201cThe last time I was in that situation I found myself in Australia and I didn\u2019t want to be in that position again.\u201d\n\nMurray will open his campaign on Tuesday night against a local Belgian wild card, world No 158 Kimmer Coppejans. He has climbed to No 243 in the world himself, after picking up four wins in China in the last few weeks, and is likely to call a halt to his season \u2013 with the exception of the Davis Cup in late November \u2013 after this tournament.", "description": "This week in Antwerp, a resurgent Andy Murray will appear in his first ATP event in Europe for 16 months.", "authors": ["Simon Briggs", "Tennis Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/tennis/2019/10/14/TELEMMGLPICT000213010015-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
