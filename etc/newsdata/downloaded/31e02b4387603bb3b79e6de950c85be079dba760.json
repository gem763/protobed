Analysts Esther Rajavelu and Benjamin Fages lowered their 2019 to 2020 revenue forecasts based on new patient acquisition rates and dosing regiments, increased their mid-term revenue forecast -- defined as for 2021 to 2024 -- based on a higher proportion of maintenance patients versus new ones, and lowered their long-term revenue forecasts -- for the 2025 to 2030 period -- based on gradually rising attrition rates and a declining net price. \"These changes lower our PT to $233 from $239, and we maintain our outperform rating as we believe Epidiolex US uptake continues to progress well, and we await management comments on EU pricing/commercial strategy,\" the analysts wrote in a note to clients. The third-quarter forecast assumes 3,400 new patients for the drug, raising the total to 15,400 from 12,000 in the second quarter.
