USA TODAY\n\nHigh ankle sprain. Out \u201ca week or two.\u201d\n\nThose words from Nick Saban, describing what he knew of the injury suffered by Tua Tagovailoa, sent people immediately to the calendar: Alabama plays Arkansas. Then a bye week.\n\nPhew!\n\nWill that be enough time for healing before the big bracket-buster with LSU? Probably so, and we all hope so \u2014 but the point here is, even as the Football Four remains unchanged this week, everything can take a scary turn with an ankle.\n\nEven without Tua, Alabama beat Tennessee, because of course. But just outside the bracket, there was a radical twist (Wisconsin, what?). And who would even try to predict the next one? The events of the last couple of weekends might simply be foreshocks. So let\u2019s enjoy a season that, even with a lot of familiar names in and just beyond the bracket, has at least shown potential for chaos.\n\nWinners and losers: Week 8 in college football led by Wisconsin, Oregon\n\nWeek 8 observations: Wisconsin exposed as fraud in title chase and that could hurt Big Ten\n\nAs always, remember we pick the bracket as if the season was over today.*\n\nFootball Four\n\n1. Ohio State \u2013 The Buckeyes are big and fast and very complete, as Northwestern found out Friday night. Given developments elsewhere, Ohio State looks clearly like the best team in the Big Ten \u2026 and beyond.\n\n2. LSU \u2013 Joe Burrow set a new school record for TD passes in a season (in the seventh game), which is an illustration of his superlative play and of how LSU has emerged from the Stone Age. Auburn\u2019s defense gets the next shot at slowing LSU.\n\n3. Oklahoma \u2013 Thankfully no one was hurt when the Sooner Schooner tipped over. But the football team was never in danger of that from West Virginia. Jalen Hurts had a very big day as Oklahoma hung half a hundred.\n\n4. Alabama \u2013 Fire up the cigars, fellas, Tua\u2019s going to be fine! (Or so we\u2019re told.) Despite the lopsided final score, the Crimson Tide didn\u2019t exactly cruise against Tennessee. But assuming Tagovailoa can get healthy in these next couple of weeks, Bama remains on track for a Big 12-style shootout with LSU.\n\nAlabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa walks off the field during the game against Tennessee.

But the Tigers had plenty of, uh, punch anyway in another lopsided ACC win, this time at Louisville.\n\n6. Penn State \u2013 White-outs in Happy Valley are so, so cool, huh? The Nittany Lions couldn\u2019t put Michigan away, and got a little lucky \u2014 but they won, and they\u2019re unbeaten.\n\n7. Notre Dame \u2013 After an idle weekend, the Irish head to Michigan. It\u2019s not the massive showdown we might have anticipated a few weeks ago, but that\u2019s not Notre Dame\u2019s fault.\n\n8. Georgia \u2013 In a steady rain, the Bulldogs finally found the end zone to pull away from Kentucky. But it took a very long time. And although the dismal weather was a very good excuse, Georgia\u2019s issues remain real, and pressing.\n\nA Few More After That***\n\nOregon \u2013 With each win \u2013 including a rally to win Saturday at rival Washington \u2014 losing that 21-6 lead against Auburn back in the opener becomes more regrettable. But these Ducks have a real shot to get back into the Football Four conversation.\n\nFlorida \u2013 It didn\u2019t come easy at suddenly solid-ish South Carolina, but the Gators rebounded from the loss to LSU. Up next? A weekend off, followed by a little meeting in Jacksonville with Georgia that could decide the SEC East.\n\nAuburn \u2013 A trip to Arkansas \u2014 51-10, just a little tune-up \u2014 provided the perfect bounce-back after that loss to Florida a couple of weeks back. Now the Tigers can turn their full attention to LSU.\n\nBaylor \u2013 Matt Rhule\u2019s Bears are 7-0 \u2026 and if you questioned the Bears before (soft nonconference schedule, some fortunate wins in Big 12 play)? A very, very impressive performance to beat Oklahoma State in Stillwater. Don\u2019t look now, but they\u2019re likely to be 9-0 for what would be a huuuuuuge home game against Oklahoma.\n\nFutile Four****\n\nTennessee \u2013 The Vols actually played fairly well in Tuscaloosa. But trying to pull within one score, Jarrett Guarantano fumbled trying to extend the ball across the goal line \u2026 and it was returned 100 yards for a touchdown \u2026 and Jeremy Pruitt went off on the QB, including a tug on his facemask \u2026 and it was all so Tennessee.\n\nMichigan \u2013 Remember when the Wolverines were in the preseason Top 10? Fun times \u2014 but these are not. Credit Michigan for scrappily hanging tough with Penn State, but the goal was not scrappy, hanging-tough losses.\n\nWisconsin \u2013 Just when we all thought the Badgers were real, genuine Football Four contenders, they lost to Illinois. It could be worse (could\u2019ve lost to, say, Rutgers) \u2014 but it could not be much worse. Ugh.\n\nMiami \u2013 Yeah, it took a fake punt and a fumble recovery and a blocked field goal (along with other missed field goals) to lose to Georgia Tech in overtime. But Miami just lost to Georgia Tech in overtime. The Manny Diaz era is off to a very, very shaky start.\n\n* The season is not over today.\n\n** Don\u2019t be worried that your team sits just outside the cut. This is a weekly snapshot. And what do we know, anyway?\n\n*** See the previous note, but it\u2019s OK to be slightly concerned or very angry. But what do we know, anyway?\n\n**** No note necessary.", "description": "Tua Tagovailoa's ankle injury could be a problem for Alabama if it lingers as the Crimson Tide have LSU on the horizon in early November.", "authors": ["George Schroeder", "Published A.M.
