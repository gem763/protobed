Virgin added that it regularly reviews its product offerings.\n\nThe news come after Virgin Mobile have removed all PAYG Sim cards from their website, confirming that this is something they have no longer provided since September.\n\nThe price increases for existing PAYG customers suggests that Virgin is trying to encourage these customers to move onto different plans.\n\nAn email sent round to Virgin customers said: 'If you'd like something that might work better for you, try our monthly JAM Packs.\n\n'They give you better value on calls, texts and data, and refresh automatically every 30 days, as long as you have enough top-up credit in your account.'\n\nThe JAM packs are much better value for money, with customers able to choose 250 minutes, 250 texts and 250MB data for \u00a35 \u2013 a much better deal than the ones PAYG customers are being moved to.\n\nExisting customers and those looking to take out new PAYG contracts have taken to social media to complain about the changes.\n\nOne Twitter user was unhappy with the change saying prices have got worse since she joined\n\nUnhappy: This customer said that the changes were 'showing contempt to loyal customers'\n\nAnnoyed: This customer was unhappy about 'being forced' onto Virgin Mobile's daily plan\n\nOne customer has said they believe Virgin are trying to 'hawk their bundled PAYG packages'\n\nA Virgin Media spokesperson said: 'We're making adjustments to some of our Pay As You Go tariffs. Customers impacted by any changes will be notified of alterations to their mobile plan in a clear and timely way.'\n\nWhilst anybody who uses multiple texts and minutes a day is likely not going to be overcharged by too much, the majority of people are likely not going to use that many.\n\nThe good news is that any existing PAYG customer can either switch to Virgin's JAM packages or switch provider altogether.\n\nFor those who want to switch, it will still be possible to keep your existing number by getting your PAC code from Virgin and giving it to your new provider.\n\nTo find the best value Sim only deals, visit This is Money's guide.", "description": "Thousands of customers could now be paying a massive \u00a36 a day after Virgin decided to increase its prices.", "authors": ["Grace Gausden For This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
