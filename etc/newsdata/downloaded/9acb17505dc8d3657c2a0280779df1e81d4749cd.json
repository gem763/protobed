The central bank cut borrowing rates in late July for the first time since the financial crisis.\n\nThe moves are part of an effort to keep borrowing cheap, credit widely available and businesses and consumers confident.\n\nA so-called inverted yield curve is flashing an economic warning sign\n\n12 % Inversion U.S. Treasuries 10 8 Inversion Inversion 6 10-year 4 Inversion 2 2-year 0 1990 2000 2010 2019 12 % Inversion U.S. Treasuries 10 8 Inversion Inversion 6 10-year 4 Inversion 2 2-year 0 1990 2000 2010 2019 12 % Inversion U.S. Treasuries 10 8 Inversion Inversion 6 10-year 4 Inversion 2 2-year 0 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 2019 12 % Inversion U.S. Treasuries 10 8 Inversion Inversion 6 4 Inversion 10-year 2 2-year 0 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 2019\n\nLonger-term bonds have been trading at interest rates that are lower than those on short-term securities \u2014 what is known as the yield curve inverting. It\u2019s an unusual occurrence that often happens before recessions, and one that could signal that investors have become pessimistic about the economic outlook.\n\nThe global economy is slowing as manufacturing activity weakens, and political tensions, including President Trump\u2019s trade war with China, are creating uncertainty for businesses. That is slowing down investment, which could hold back growth.\n\nThe Fed keeps a close eye on how fast the economy is expanding because the pace of growth is crucial to its two main goals: reaching maximum employment and maintaining stable inflation around 2 percent. A slowdown could prevent policymakers from hitting their long-elusive inflation goal, and a downturn might lead to higher unemployment.\n\nFor now, consumers are powering the economy ahead. Unemployment is low, wages are rising and households are spending. But surveys in recent months have shown consumer sentiment may be wavering, a cause for concern if it bleeds into real-life behavior. Consumers fuel about 70 percent of the economy.\n\nRates are being lowered around the world\n\nMost recent central bank rate cuts . . . . . . and increases Current rate G.D.P.

Last week, the European Central Bank cut one of its policy rates to a record low and rolled out a broader package of monetary stimulus.\n\nAfter the Fed\u2019s move on Wednesday, the focus will quickly turn to whether it will continue cutting rates before the year\u2019s end, or if this move will be enough to keep the American economy humming along.\n\nBased on economic projections released Wednesday, a growing number of Fed officials expect one more reduction this year \u2014 in-line with investor and economist expectations.", "description": "The Federal Reserve lowered interest rates for the second time this year, as it tries to guard the United States economy against trade-related uncertainty and slowing global growth.", "authors": ["Karl Russell", "Jeanna Smialek"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/18/us/fed-second-rate-cut-promo-1568827337935/fed-second-rate-cut-promo-1568827337935-facebookJumbo-v3.png", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
