Australia started off strong with a win over Canada, and Team USA beat the Czech Republic by 21 points.\n\nNBA players are abound in this tournament, and as such we are lucky to get some great highlights in the dog days of summer that are top quality. Sunday morning came with an offering from Washington Wizards rookie Rui Hachimura over another NBA player that was better than that first sip of coffee.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nWith 45 seconds to go in the second quarter against Turkey on Sunday, Hachimura threw down a dunk off a steal over Ersan Ilyasova that was pretty dang powerful.\n\nVia Twitter:\n\nRui Hachimura ended NBA veteran Ersan Ilyasova at the FIBA World Cup. pic.twitter.com/SufIt0wQX4 \u2014 Chase Hughes (@ChaseHughesNBCS) September 1, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nHachimura raised quite a few eyebrows when the Wizards took him at No. 9 overall. The World Cup doesn\u2019t necessarily have a direct correlation to how players will play in the NBA, but it is an elevated talent pool over the college ranks and even Summer League.\n\nJapan lost by 19 to Turkey in this game, and Ilyasova finished with 19 points and 10 rebounds in a leading effort. Still, Hachimura\u2019s dunk was pretty sweet, and Wizards fans are tentatively hoping he starts to round into shape. Washington could use all the talent they can get.", "description": "Japan lost by 19 to Turkey in this game, and Ilyasova finished with 19 points and 10 rebounds in a leading effort.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ME3GpcjkJKEysOFzNvmdfw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjEuMDY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/zwpLRsL5R8Nf9HT_uonZqQ--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkxODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/09f3b1bbcd1b9566ae1030deee4c0d9e"}
