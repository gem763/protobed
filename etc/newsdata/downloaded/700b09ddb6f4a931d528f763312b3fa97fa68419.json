While giants like Visa and MasterCard charge interest and late fees for overdue payments, for example, the Stockholm, Sweden-based company Klarna \u2014 which allows shoppers to buy now and pay later \u2014 makes money through retailer transaction fees and late fees but doesn\u2019t charge interest fees. Similarly, Max Levchin\u2019s lending company, Affirm, doesn\u2019t charge late fees when its customers rack up big charges but it does charge interest rates (sometimes as high as 30 percent).\n\nUpgrade is slightly different in that that it doesn\u2019t invite customers to defer their payments when they buy something using dollars from Upgrade. But it still largely fits into the same mold in that it markets itself as better for lending customers and more mindful of them. Its flagship personal loans product, for example, is largely used by customers to pay off credit cards and it features credit health tools that ostensibly teach people how to improve their credit scores.\n\nIt also charges up to 35.89% interest annually.\n\nA brand-new credit product \u2014 the Upgrade Card \u2014 takes things even further on the feel-good front. As Laplanche explains it, the card \u201cbasically combines the payments capabilities of a credit card with the low cost of a bank loan into one single product.\u201d\n\nAdds Laplanche of this hybrid creation: \u201cLending Club created a $100 billion industry with personal loans 12 years ago; I think this is 10 times bigger \u2014 and 10 times cheaper for consumers.\n\nWe\u2019re inherently skeptical of most lending products being good \u2014 or \u201ccheap\u201d \u2014 for customers. But here\u2019s how it works: instead of asking a cardholder to pay a minimum amount each month from the balance they owe on their card, Upgrade breaks down the balance into an installment plan with equal monthly payments \u2014 plus an interest payment \u2014 that can be completed in a year to three years\u2019 time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a mortgage or a car loan with a clear payment schedule,\u201d says Laplanche. \u201cYou can budget for it and it sort of forces you to pay down the balance over a reasonable period,\u201d unlike credit cards where customers can run a balance for as long as they like \u2014 which can wind up costing them an arm and a leg in interest payments alone over time.\n\nThere is no prepayment penalty and the card replenishes as it is paid off.\n\nMore, unlike many credit cards that reward users for spending with cash back and other perks, Upgrade customers receive 1% cash back each time they make a payment toward their balance.\n\nStill, there is an annual percentage rate as with most credit cards, and it\u2019s not much kinder than other alternatives, with an annual interest rate that ranges from 6.49% to 29.99%\n\nLaplanche further concedes that, as with any lending product, customers who miss payments or start with a lower credit score are more likely to confront a higher interest rate than someone who is able to pay off their card as they use it.\n\nUpgrade partnered with Cross River Bank on its new offering. The 11-year-old, Fort Lee, N.J.-based institution has itself raised at least $128 million over the years, including via a $100 million round led by KKR that closed late last year and a $28 million round put together in 2016 with funding from Battery Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, and Ribbit Capital, among others. In fact, Cross River has become the go-to institution for a lot of fintech startups, including Affirm, Transferwise, and Coinbase \u2014 startups that want to stay compliant with consumer protection regulations and that might have wanted to steer clear of large banks, especially when starting out.\n\nUpgrade, which closed its last round, is probably due for a new funding round itself, having closed its $62 million Series C round in August of last year. Asked about this, however, Laplanche says only that, \u201cWe\u2019re good.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, it\u2019s planning ahead with the resources it has. Beyond the Upgrade Card, the San Francisco-based company expects to introduce a savings account in the first quarter of next year, a move similar to the that which Robinhood announced earlier this week when it unveiled a high-yield cash management account.\n\nIt makes sense. If the economy turns \u2014 and it seems likely given the ongoing spat between China and the U.S., not to mention other unanswered questions \u2014 consumers are likely to look increasingly for safe havens like savings and cash management accounts.\n\nWhether the moves are enough to insulate Upgrade (or these other fintech startups) in a serious downturn remains to be seen. But Laplanche has weathered worse before.\n\nThough LendingClub was among the first peer-to-peer lenders and enjoyed a splashy debut on the public market in the summer of 2014, by the spring of 2016, Laplanche was asked to resign and was soon after charged by the SEC with fraudulently inflating the company\u2019s returns.\n\nHe settled with the agency last year without admitting wrongdoing. He also paid a fine and agreed to be barred from the securities industry for three years.", "description": "Three years ago, the founder of LendingClub, Renaud Laplanche, took the wraps off his second act, a consumer lending venture called Upgrade that now employs 350 people, has lent roughly $2 billion to 200,000 people, and has raised $142 million from outside investors.
