(Simon Dawson/Reuters)\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday signaled that he is prepared to call a high-stakes snap election next month if his political opponents try to block his plans for Britain to exit the European Union on Oct. 31.\n\nJohnson on Monday said publicly that he did not want an election. But he made his intentions clear to his cabinet and other staff amid a rising and emotional stalemate over his handling of Brexit. A senior member of his government said that if Johnson\u2019s opponents are successful in delaying Brexit, \u201cthe inevitable consequence of that will be an election.\u201d\n\nA general election would be a serious gamble for Johnson and his opponents, headed by Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, in the bitter Brexit debate that has raged in Britain since 2016, when a slim majority voted to leave the E.U.\n\nJohnson, who took office in late July on a defiant pledge to deliver Brexit by Halloween \u201cdo or die,\u201d could see his government crash and burn quickly in a national vote, or he could potentially emerge in a far stronger position.\n\nBut an election could also see Corbyn, a far-left leader and harsh critic of President Trump, end up as prime minister, leaving Brexit and the U.K.\u2019s relations with the United States filled with uncertainty.\n\n\u201cThe risks are huge,\u201d said Robert Ford, a politics professor at the University of Manchester. \u201cBut then, it\u2019s 4 a.m. in the casino if you\u2019re the Conservative prime minister at this point. Every option is a high-stakes gamble, every option is a risk.\u201d\n\nBritain\u2019s next general election is scheduled for 2022. But under the British system, a general election can be called at virtually any time, as long as two-thirds of Parliament supports it.\n\nThe government official said it should be possible to get a two-thirds vote because Labour is likely to support a move to potentially unseat Johnson. The most likely date for an election would be about Oct. 14, ahead of a key European Council meeting on Oct. 17, the official said.\n\nIn a speech Monday, Corbyn said he would support an election.\n\n\u201cWhen a government finds itself without a majority, the solution is not to undermine democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe solution is to let the people decide, and call a general election.\u201d\n\n[Britain\u2019s Johnson, Corbyn headed for ferocious Brexit showdown when Parliament returns Tuesday]\n\nHe said his priority Tuesday, when Parliament returns from its summer recess, is to introduce legislation to block Britain\u2019s departure from the E.U. without an agreement in place to regulate trade, border security and other critical issues \u2014 the so-called no-deal Brexit.\n\nMost lawmakers in Parliament oppose leaving without an exit plan, something many analysts say could be economically damaging and lead to food and medicine shortages. Johnson has dismissed those predictions as fearmongering.\n\nCorbyn\u2019s efforts to block a no-deal Brexit, or seek an extension beyond Oct. 31, will be aided by a faction of Conservative members of Parliament opposed to Johnson\u2019s position.\n\nA cross-party group of a dozen members of Parliament plans to propose legislation on Tuesday asking the government to seek a three-month extension of the Brexit deadline, according to a draft of the proposal circulated Monday evening by Labour legislator Hilary Benn.\n\nJohnson accused his opponents of seeking \u201cyet another pointless delay.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are no circumstances in which I will ask Brussels to delay. We are leaving on 31 October, no ifs or buts,\u201d he said.\n\nBenn said that it was \u201cabsolutely extraordinary\u201d for Johnson to say that under no circumstances would he ask for a delay. \u201cIf the bill passes, it would require him by law to do that,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cEither we have a prime minister who accepts the rule of law, or we don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\n\nBritain\u2019s opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn attends a shadow cabinet meeting in Salford on Monday. (Pool/Reuters)\n\nJohnson has a tiny working majority in Parliament \u2014 just one vote. He was not elected by the British people, but by a vote of Conservative Party members choosing a new leader after Theresa May stepped down as prime minister over her failure to deliver Brexit.\n\nJohnson has employed tough tactics, threatening on Monday to kick members of Parliament out of the Conservative Party if they don\u2019t support him.\n\nConservative rebels reacted angrily to Johnson\u2019s threat, which would mean they could not run as Conservative candidates in any upcoming election.\n\nNick Boles, a former Conservative legislator who quit the party over Brexit, told the BBC that Johnson\u2019s tactics mean the party has been \u201ctaken over\u201d by the \u201chard right.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Conservative Party has fallen prey to an almost religious obsession with the hardest form of Brexit, which is obviously a Brexit with no deal,\u201d he said in a radio interview Monday.\n\nJohnson insisted Monday that Britain was making progress and that \u201cchances of a deal are rising,\u201d partly because Johnson\u2019s government had made it clear to Brussels that it was \u201cutterly determined\u201d to leave the E.U. on Oct. 31 \u201ccome what may.\u201d\n\nHe said his opponents\u2019 attempts to block any no-deal Brexit would \u201cchop the legs out from under the U.K. position and make any further negotiation impossible.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so I say, to show our friends in Brussels that we are united in our purpose, MPs should vote with the government against Corbyn\u2019s pointless delay,\u201d he said.\n\nA key Johnson opponent, Nicola Sturgeon, leader of the Scottish National Party, tweeted after Johnson\u2019s statement: \u201cPlainly obvious from that statement that Johnson has no plan to get a deal. If MPs blink tomorrow, he will drive the UK off the no deal cliff on 31 October. He must not get away with it.\u201d\n\n[Could Johnson\u2019s \u2018no-deal Brexit\u2019 break up the United Kingdom?]\n\nFormer Labour Party prime minister Tony Blair warned in a speech Monday that opponents should be cautious about seeking an election. He said that could be an \u201celephant trap\u201d laid by Johnson. He noted that Corbyn is so unpopular with many voters, and the opposition is so divided, that the Conservatives might win a general election.\n\nThis week\u2019s battles in Parliament will also center on Johnson\u2019s plan to suspend Parliament for five weeks, starting sometime next week. Corbyn and other enraged opponents have called that an attack on Britain\u2019s democracy.\n\nA suspension of Parliament is not unusual, but the length of this year\u2019s shutdown \u2014 at a time when Britain is facing its biggest political decision in decades \u2014 is highly unusual.\n\nAs Johnson spoke outside his office Monday night, protesters loudly chanted \u201cStop the coup!\u201d\n\nCorbyn said Monday that he feared Johnson\u2019s willingness to accept Brexit without a deal.\n\n\u201cA no-deal Brexit is really a Trump-deal Brexit, leading to a one-sided United States trade deal that will put us at the mercy of Donald Trump and the biggest American corporations,\u201d he said.\n\nCorbyn said that in Johnson, \u201cTrump has found a compliant British leader who will dance to his tune.\n\n\u201cUnless we stop Johnson\u2019s Tory government now it\u2019s a headlong rush into the arms of Donald Trump,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more\n\nBoris Johnson seizes momentum on Brexit with combative move to suspend Parliament\n\nCould Boris Johnson\u2019s \u2018no-deal\u2019 Brexit break up the United Kingdom?\n\nBoris Johnson asked the queen to suspend Parliament.
