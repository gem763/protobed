Yet his Northern Irish allies are opposed to a deal and the three main opposition parties have pledged to vote it down.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a great new deal that takes back control \u2014 now parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday,\u201d Johnson said ahead of the first Saturday sitting of parliament since the 1982 Argentine invasion of the Falkland Islands.\n\nIf he wins the vote, Johnson will go down in history as the leader who delivered Brexit - for good or bad. If he fails, Johnson will face the humiliation of Brexit unraveling after repeatedly promising that he would get it done.\n\nGoldman Sachs said it thought the deal would pass and raised its estimate of Brexit with a deal on Oct. 31 to 65% from 60%. It cut its odds on a no-deal departure to 10% from 15% and kept unchanged its 25% probability of no Brexit.\n\nThe pound held at five-month highs of $1.2874 against the dollar, down from Thursday\u2019s peak of $1.2988.\n\nJohnson won the top job by staking his career on gettingBrexit done by the latest deadline of Oct. 31 after his predecessor, Theresa May, was forced to delay the departure date. Parliament rejected her deal three times, by margins of between 58 and 230 votes.\n\nDowning Street is casting the Saturday vote as a last chance to get Brexit done with lawmakers facing the option of either approving the deal or propelling the United Kingdom to a disorderly no-deal exit that could divide the West, hurt global growth and trigger violence in Northern Ireland.\n\n\u2018PRETTY CLOSE\u2019\n\nTo win the vote, Johnson must persuade enough Brexit-supporting rebels in both his own Conservative Party and the opposition Labour Party to back his deal.\n\nConcerned about the potential impact of a no-deal departure, Johnson\u2019s opponents have already passed a law demanding he delay Brexit unless he gets a withdrawal deal approved by Saturday.\n\nThe government has said both that it will comply with this law and that Britain will leave the EU on Oct. 31 whatever happens. Johnson has not explained how he plans to take these two apparently contradictory steps.\n\nThe message from Johnson\u2019s advisers is: \u201cNew deal or no deal but no delay.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister was due to hold a cabinet meeting at 1500GMT on Friday.\n\nAs lawmakers mull one of the United Kingdom\u2019s most significant geopolitical moves since World War Two, hundreds of thousands of demonstrators are due to march towards parliament demanding another referendum on EU membership.\n\nParliament will sit from 0830 GMT on Saturday. Johnson will make a statement to lawmakers, after which there will be a debate and then a vote. The debate was originally scheduled to last 90 minutes, but is no longer time-limited.\n\nNORTHERN IRISH OPPOSITION\n\nThe Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) said it would oppose the deal and lobby a faction of around 28 hardlineBrexit supporters in the Conservative Party to do the same.\n\n\u201cWe will be encouraging (other lawmakers to vote against)because we believe it does have an impact on the unity of theUnited Kingdom, will spark further nationalist sentiment inScotland and will be detrimental to the economy of NorthernIreland,\u201d the DUP\u2019s Sammy Wilson said.\n\n\u201cVoting this down tomorrow is not the end of the game, in fact it probably opens up possibilities for the government which are not available at present after a general election.\u201d\n\nWithout the DUP\u2019s 10 votes, Johnson will need Brexit-supporting Labour Party rebels to support his deal.\n\nSaturday\u2019s vote will be \u201cpretty close\u201d but likely just fall short of approval, said John McDonnell, the second most powerful person in the Labour Party.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it will pass, I think it will be defeated but... the numbers are going to be pretty close,\u201d McDonnell toldSky News.\n\nIf the vote is a tie, then the speaker of parliament, John Bercow, would hold the deciding vote. According to vague convention, the speaker would seek to keep the issue open for further discussion.\n\n(Additional reporting by Elizabeth Piper and William JamesWriting by Guy Faulconbridge Editing by Frances Kerry)", "description": "The British PM clinched a new deal, but now he needs to get it ratified in parliament, where he has no majority.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5daa8229210000f917ad3467.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
