America needs an iron constitution for the era of great power competition now upon us.\n\nSo warns conservative scholar Colin Dueck in his new book, \"Age of Iron: On Conservative Nationalism\" (Oxford University Press, 2019).\n\nDueck, a former \"Never Trumper,\" starts and ends his book with an unexpected assertion that Founding Fathers George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and the rest of the cast of \"Hamilton\" would have been perfectly content with President Trump's foreign policies.\n\nWhat's more, he argues, Trump policies will help 21st century America deal effectively with modern threats posed by the likes of China, Russia, Iran and North Korea.\n\nTUCKER CARLSON: OUTRAGE OVER TRUMP'S SYRIA DECISION SHOWS WASHINGTON'S PERVERSE PRIORITIES\n\nWhen America opened for business, Dueck argues, \u201cconservative nationalism\u201d was American foreign policy \u2013 a set of core beliefs held in common. Back then, they just called it nationalism.\n\nNationalism included a shared civic creed. Our Founding Fathers had a belief in the rule of law, individual liberty, free enterprise, equality and limited government. They believed in popular sovereignty. And they expected that foreign policy would foster the state\u2019s national interests.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThey saw this organization of principles and policies as unique and exceptional and welcomed the mantle of America as the \u201cexceptional nation.\u201d\n\nDueck doesn\u2019t argue that American orthodoxy demands one-size-fits-all foreign policy. President George Washington campaigned for no \u201centangling alliance,\u201d not because he was a libertarian or an isolationist, but because he recognized the danger of a young republic getting embroiled in Europe\u2019s perpetual power struggles.\n\nIn contrast, after the Spanish-American War, President William McKinley became a reluctant imperialist, annexing the Philippines because the U.S. believed it needed a Pacific foothold to defend its Asian interests against the Japanese and the Europeans in China.\n\nOver the years, some presidents fought wars, while others shrank from the global stage. Still, they all pursued foreign policies rooted in the basic belief of nationalism fostered by the Founding Fathers.\n\nThe big break, Dueck argues, came with President Woodrow Wilson. As Wilson watched the nation-state sink in the aftermath of World War I, he embraced internationalism as a life raft. This touched off the great, bipolar struggle for American foreign policy, pitting globalists and populists against what Dueck calls conservative nationalists, those who cling to traditional American foreign policy.\n\n\u201cAge of Iron\u201d commits many pages to analyzing Trump\u2019s first term. It concludes that, while his rhetoric may be populist, the president\u2019s policy fits well within the scope of traditional conservative foreign policy.\n\nTrump is neither a warmonger nor an isolationist. His game plan is to ramp up the pressure and \u201cde-escalate on favorable terms.\u201d He shows the other side that America has skin in the game, and is willing to protect its interests; then, if the other side recognizes our equities, he does a deal \u2014 if there is a good deal to done.\n\nIn practice, Dueck finds, Trump is doing what the vast majority of American conservatives want. They are unlikely to part ways with their president.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOn the other hand, there is no guarantee about where America goes from here. The nation might well veer off into isolationism or go all globalist. But, \u201cAge of Iron\u201d concludes, it is just as likely that we stay on the path we are on.\n\nThat\u2019s all to the good, Dueck finds, because he sees Trump\u2019s formula of prudent pressure and engagement as the right mix for mixing it up in era of great power competition.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JAMES CARAFANO", "description": "Our Founding Fathers had a belief in the rule of law, individual liberty, free enterprise, equality and limited government.
