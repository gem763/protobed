It did not break down sales by geography in the report.\n\nThe company, however, surprised investors with a quarterly profit, making good on Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk's promise, as it delivered a record 97,000 cars.\n\nThe company has said it plans to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles for all of 2019, and that it was 'highly confident in exceeding 360,000 deliveries this year.'\n\nThe drop in sales in its domestic market in the latest reported quarter compares with a 55 percent rise in the second quarter ended June.\n\nA Tesla Model 3 is seen in the general assembly line at the Tesla factory in Fremont, California\n\n'The 40 percent drop in sales shows there is a ton of work to do to meet guidance,' Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin said.\n\nTesla is expanding its service in other markets including China and Europe, as Musk is under pressure to make Tesla sustainably profitable, while still spending on major initiatives ranging from a Shanghai factory and assembly-line to upcoming models such as the Model Y SUV and a Semi commercial truck.\n\nThe company's shares dropped 3.5 percent to $3.16.22 on Tuesday.", "description": "U.S. sales, which account for the biggest share of the company's total revenue, fell to $3.13 billion from $5.13 billion a year earlier.
