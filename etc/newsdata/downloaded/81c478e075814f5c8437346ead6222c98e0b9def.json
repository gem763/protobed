The pact runs to March 2020 and the producers meet to set policy on Dec. 5-6.\n\nShould OPEC+ call for deeper cuts, it would be further proof that the only way to fetch higher oil prices these days would be to crimp supply instead of trying to spur demand.\n\nIt\u2019s been a remarkable few weeks in oil after the Sept. 14 attack on Saudi energy infrastructure that briefly knocked out 5% of daily global supply and sent beyond $70 per barrel before the market\u2019s quick return to previous pricing on assurances that Riyadh\u2019s production has been fully restored.\n\nSeparately, the Wall Street Journal reported that investment bankers could deliver as soon as Friday a valuation much lower than the $2 trillion expected by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for the initial public offering of the kingdom\u2019s state oil company Aramco.\n\nCrude prices were also supported Thursday by reports that Russia and Saudi Arabia will sign more than $2 billion of deals and discuss the OPEC+ oil output agreement during President Vladimir Putin's first visit to the kingdom in more than a decade next week.\n\nBut some analysts pointed to continued rumblings on U.S.-China trade and how that could weigh on the market again before the week ended.\n\nHigh-level negotiations between the White House and Beijing began with fanfare again on Thursday after being stalled for five months, lending to higher risk appetite on Wall Street and across markets.\n\nBut many traders were also pessimistic about real gains from the talks given continuous diplomatic offensives fired by the Trump administration against China in recent days.\n\n\u201cOil traders are looking at the world through China-colored glasses,\u201d Phil Flynn of Chicago\u2019s Price Futures Group said, commenting that conflicting headlines on U.S.-China talks were causing whipsaw moves, just when the market thought that cross currents in oil couldn\u2019t get any more complicated.", "description": "Oil up as OPEC Hints Further Supply Cuts; Eyes on Trade Talks", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC0R0QY_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
