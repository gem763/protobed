They sound good and look sleek. They have built-in voice assistants and offer multi-room wifi capabilities. But despite all this likability, the newest member of the family, the Bose Portable Home speaker, feels like a worse version of the latest Sonos invention. That sucks for Bose, since the company is clearly trying to sell some Sonos killers.\n\nThe $499.95 Bose Portable Home speaker is a handsome little thing that\u2019s designed with versatility in mind. It works as a wifi speaker through the Bose Music app, so you can easily connect it to other speakers in the Bose Smart Home Family, including the Bose Home Speaker 500 and the all-new Bose Home Speaker 300. There\u2019s also AirPlay 2 support and a Bluetooth option for when you take the speaker out of wifi range. Moving it about is made easier with a wireless charging cradle that, unfortunately, is sold separately for $39.95.\n\nBose Portable Home Speaker WHAT IS IT? A portable wi-fi speaker (with Bluetooth) COST $499.95 LIKE Sounds fine, looks good NO LIKE Too expensive\n\nOn the audio end of things, Bose likes to brag that its new Home speaker comes with 360-degree sound. If you\u2019ve been following the play-by-play of the portable wireless speaker market, this might sound like a dig at Sonos, which recently released its own Move wireless speaker, which has a front-facing woofer and not much of a 360 experience. If Bose is trying to differentiate itself with sound quality, however, it stopped short of building anything memorable. In a side-by-side comparison, the Bose Portable Home speaker sounded underpowered and hollow compared to the Sonos Move. It\u2019s also about half the size.\n\nNevertheless, in the week or so that I spent testing out the Bose Portable Home speaker, I found myself wondering the same thing that made me second-guess the Sonos Move. Who exactly is this speaker for? It\u2019s much more expensive than the best Bluetooth speakers I\u2019ve used, and it doesn\u2019t sound as good as non-portable wifi speakers at the same price point. What\u2019s the point?\n\nBrand loyalty, maybe. Some people love that hollow Bose sound and have filled their homes with Bose products so that they can hear it in every room. This hobby has undoubtedly been difficult for those Bose enthusiasts who have invested in the company\u2019s SoundTouch ecosystem because new products like the Portable Home Speaker aren\u2019t compatible with those products. But if you\u2019re buying up Bose\u2019s latest smart speaker family, the pricey new Portable Home Speaker is a new addition that you can take with you on the road, where nobody will know to be impressed by how your whole house is full of Bose products. If you\u2019re the sort of passionate Bose fan who just wants the newest things from the company, don\u2019t let me discourage you.\n\nAs far as Bose loyalists are concerned, it doesn\u2019t matter that the Sonos Move is a better speaker. Bose fans will want the Bose version of this do-it-all device. In case you\u2019re considering switching ecosystems; however, I would like to point out that the Sonos Move offers richer bass and superior tuning, including a new feature called Auto TruPlay that optimises the tuning of the speaker whenever you put it in a new location. At $649, the Sonos Move is more expensive than the Bose Portable Home Speaker, but if you want the Bose with a charging cradle, we\u2019re talking about a $110 price difference. (A charging cradle is included with the Sonos Move.) Seriously, though, there\u2019s a very good chance that the only people who really want to buy the Sonos Move already own some Sonos speakers.\n\nPhoto: Adam Clark Estes, Gizmodo The Sonos Move (left) and the Bose Portable Home Speaker (right) Photo: Adam Clark Estes, Gizmodo The top of the Bose Portable Home Speaker has many buttons.

Sonos used to rule the space, but lately, all kinds of new competitors like Bose and Amazon and Apple are getting into the wireless speaker market. The Bose Portable Home Speaker isn\u2019t a particularly excellent or affordable wireless speaker, but it does let Bose compete more directly with Sonos. For now, the Sonos version of a portable wifi speaker is better. The Bose version is just fine. You won\u2019t even care if you\u2019re a huge Bose enthusiast. It\u2019s got that Bose sound!\n\nIn all seriousness and given what\u2019s out there right now, I think most people will be totally satisfied with a regular Bluetooth speaker for their portable music-making needs. The Ultimate Ears Boom 3 is my favourite and costs just $199.95. If you want to add Alexa capabilities, you can get the UE Blast for $279.95. The extra functionality you get with wifi capabilities just doesn\u2019t add up to an extra $300 for each speaker. Most people will be happy with a wired Sonos One or Bose Home Speaker. They\u2019re both great speakers. Even if you\u2019re a super fan of the brands, though, you should consider saving your hard-earned cash and wait for the price of the Sonos Move and the Bose Portable Home Speaker to drop. For now, just go buy a Boom. You won\u2019t regret it.\n\nREADME", "description": "There\u2019s a lot to like about Bose\u2019s Smart Home speaker lineup. They sound good and look sleek.
