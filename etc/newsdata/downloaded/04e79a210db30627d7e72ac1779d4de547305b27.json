Republican arguments that Democratic freshman would face blowback if an impeachment inquiry were launched in the House were clearly mistaken. There\u2019s no polling downside thus far, and the growing bulk of the public evidence argues that the people taking the damage from this will be Trump\u2019s mouth-breathing cadre of dumbass defenders.", "description": "The morons in the House \u2018led\u2019 by Kevin McCarthy are storming the SCIF, but Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans have had about enough of this noise.", "authors": ["Rick Wilson"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571932289/191024-wilson-trump-clown-possee-tease_vukz9s", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
