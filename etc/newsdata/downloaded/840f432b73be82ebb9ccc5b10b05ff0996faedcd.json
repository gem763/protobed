It was well below the 100-picogram threshold the UFC has adopted for its anti-doping program. The UFC adopted thresholds for some substances in August after a rash of cases of contamination involving SARMs.\n\nDiaz caused a stir on Thursday when he tweeted that he would not be fighting because of a failed test. He gave no specifics and suggested he was told to be quiet.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\u201cThere is nothing guesswork about the Nate Diaz case,\u201d said Jeff Novitzky, the UFC\u2019s senior vice president of athlete health and performance. \u201cThere is as rock-solid of evidence as I\u2019ve seen in the history of my anti-doping career when it comes to contamination.\u201d\n\nDiaz took an organic, plant-based vegan multivitamin capsule that was found to be contaminated with LGD4033 by the Sports Medicine Research & Testing Laboratory in Salt Lake City. Matthew Fedoruk, the science director of USADA, sent a letter to the New York State Athletic Commission in which he said the amount of LGD4033 in Diaz\u2019s system was roughly 10,000 times less than one therapeutic dose. UFC officials provided Fedoruk\u2019s statement to Yahoo Sports.\n\nSMRTL confirmed that two bottles of the multivitamin Diaz had been taking was contaminated with LGD4033, also known as Ligandrol.\n\nUFC president Dana White said he was certain there was a misunderstanding when he first learned of Diaz\u2019s positive test.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThere was never a thought in my mind that Nate would cheat,\u201d White said. \u201cAnd I never doubted for a second that this fight wasn\u2019t going to happen. The team did a great job looking into this and I\u2019ll see you guys in New York [on Nov. 2].\u201d\n\nKim Sumbler, the executive director of the New York State Athletic Commission, could not be reached for comment Friday. Hunter Campbell, the UFC\u2019s chief business officer, said he had been in constant communication with Sumbler and said he believes the commission will have no issue sanctioning the fight.\n\nHe said NYSAC officials were aware of things from the moment the UFC learned of the adverse finding.\n\n\u201cBased on all the information they have in front of them, it\u2019s been conveyed to me that there\u2019s a high degree of comfort ... that Nate in no way was seeking an unfair competitive advantage,\u201d Campbell said.\n\nUSADA released a statement late Friday:\n\n\u201cFollowing Mr. Diaz\u2019s public comments on Thursday we can confirm that he has not been sanctioned or provisionally suspended by USADA. \u201cAs the independent administrator of the UFC Anti-Doping program, USADA always provides every athlete the presumption of innocence. If the athlete publicly speaks of a potential violation first, then USADA may choose to comment.\u201d\n\nDiaz\u2019s is the fifth case this year of a UFC fighter testing positive for a SARM as a result of a contaminated supplement. Neil Magny was pulled from a card in May and provisionally suspended for the same reason, but he was cleared of an anti-doping violation by USADA.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "UFC officials provided the USADA\u2019s statement to Yahoo Sports.", "authors": ["Kevin Iole"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/83DFoIGhvfeaNO20VZH13A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/yafscNdydhAaIlgZ_60gtw--~B/aD0zMjcxO3c9NDkwNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/97bb89c0-f7a7-11e9-b17d-fca7b388a5b3", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
