Officials didn't immediately explain how Barr's infamous version, performed before a San Diego Padres game, was set.\n\nThe letter says the district usually plays the national anthem before sports games as a way to honor the U.S. and its armed forces. It says the district will play the district-approved version in the future.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nInformation from: The News Journal of Wilmington, Del., http://www.delawareonline.com", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
