Here are 13 potential answers to that question.", "language": "en", "text": "In the summer of 1950, physicist Enrico Fermi posed a simple question to his colleagues over lunch: \"Where is everybody?\"\n\nFermi was referring to alien life in the universe.\n\nArguably, he said, in the 4.4 billion years it took for intelligent life to evolve on our planet, the rest of our galaxy should have been overrun with similarly smart, technologically advanced aliens. But despite decades of searching the Milky Way for signs of extraterrestrials, we haven't found anything or anyone.\n\nThis conundrum has come to be known as the Fermi Paradox.\n\nScientists have offered myriad potential answers to the question, including that aliens are hibernating or deliberating hiding from us. Some researchers have also suggested that highly advanced technological civilizations destroy themselves before they have the opportunity to get in contact with other intelligent life in the universe.\n\nRead More: Alien civilizations may have explored the galaxy and visited Earth already, a new study says. We just haven't seen them recently.\n\nIn his new book, \"End Times,\" author Bryan Walsh discusses 13 theories as to why we've yet to make contact with aliens and why we might never do so. Here's how each one addresses the Fermi Paradox.", "description": "Scientists have been monitoring radio waves for signs of alien life for decades without success.
