In Embudo, New Mexico, a region bordering the Rio Grande River and the Carson National Forest, 67-year-old Ra Paulette has spent the last 25 years using a pickaxe to hack a labyrinth of 14 caves into sandstone cliffs just an hour\u2019s drive from Santa Fe. And now, a 208-acre parcel of land in Northern New Mexico that includes two of the caves, referred to as underground \u201ccathedrals or meditation chambers,\u201d is on the market for nearly $1 million.\n\n\u201cI have a history of going into my extended back yard and exploring it very thoroughly and if I find a beautiful place I make a spot for myself,\u201d Paulette, a self-described \u201cfriendly hermit,\u201d told a historian a decade ago. Part-archaeologist, part-sculptor and full-time eccentric explorer, he calls his painstaking tunneling into a mountainside, \u201cthe dance of digging,\u201d describing it on his website as mental, emotional, and physical labor. Balancing the three, he writes, is \u201cthe secret of how this old man can get so much done.\u201d\n\nHis work, done with a pickaxe, shovel, and wheelbarrow, involves massive excavation of the soft sandstone and incredibly detailed artistic carving. It\u2019s work that\u2019s both at odds, and surprisingly in line, with his background as a Vietnam veteran and farm laborer, during which he \u201cwas known as the human backhoe,\u201d a fit, gray-haired Paulette says in CaveDigger, a new documentary short by Jeffrey Karoff competing for an Oscar at the 2014 Academy Awards. In the dramatic expanse of New Mexico\u2019s desert, Paulette is pitted against a seemingly inhospitable terrain of stone and dirt. But a vista stretching as far as the eye can see doesn\u2019t deter him. \u201cI\u2019m totally obsessed, I\u2019m thinking about it all day long,\u201d he says in the film of his work.", "description": "An artist in New Mexico has spent decades chiseling out fantastical caves from the mountains, one pickaxe swing at a time.", "authors": ["Nina Strochlic"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1439,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1492203970/articles/2013/12/12/new-mexico-s-amazing-man-made-caves/131211-cavedigger_spw79k", "published_at": "2013-12-12"}
