I only did it when I really needed it,\" he said.\n\nEventually, his parents found out and put a stop to it. He never talked to anyone else, including a subsequent girlfriend, about what had happened.\n\nHe now has a job, but says he is not in a position to preach to other students who are struggling for money.\n\n\"I regret it looking back. But if I was put back in that same situation, I might do the same thing,\" he said.\n\nEmergency cash\n\nA survey of students suggested that one in 25 undergraduates have tried adult work, including sugar dating by going out with older men, selling used underwear and having sex for money.\n\nThe National Student Money Survey, by website Save the Student, gathers the views of more than 3,000 people currently studying.\n\nThe proportion of those asked - who had done some kind of adult work - was double the proportion of the previous year.\n\nAn additional 6% of students said they would try adult work if they needed emergency cash.\n\nNearly four in five students worried about making ends meet, according to the survey which was published in August.\n\nGETTY Stress and student finances \u00a3807 a monthUK students\u2019 average living costs 79% worry about making ends meet\n\n71% of students turn to parents for cash in an emergency\n\n4%have done some kind of adult work Source: Save the Student, National Student Money Survey\n\nAnother student, who wished to remain anonymous, said she was shocked how many of her fellow students were involved in adult work of some kind to make ends meet.\n\n\"I've never been as poor in my life as I was as a student, the rent was so high. I went to the shops and all I could afford was an oven pizza for the day,\" she said.\n\nIn desperation, she found information on social media on how to sell photos on an online fetish site. She made \u00a3100 or more a week selling pictures and videos of her feet to men.\n\n\"I was open about it. My Dad knew, my boyfriend knew. I do not regret it because I was finding a way to make money to eat,\" she said.\n\n\"But uni was horrific because it pushed me to that work, which is so unfair. I will always be bitter about it.\"\n\nThe National Student Money Survey found that 57% of those asked said they suffered poor mental health because of money worries - up 11 percentage points from the previous year.\n\nPsychotherapist Hannah Morish said that intimate work could easily lead to anxiety and depression.\n\n\"Adult work can feel isolating because of the stigma attached to it, meaning that if the student has a negative or dangerous experience they might feel unable to talk about it, leading to a deeper sense of loneliness,\" she said.\n\n\"Universities and student unions need to review whether they have advice and safe spaces on campus or online to support students who are considering or actively involved in this kind of work.\"\n\nJake Butler, from Save the Student, said that student funding should be given a top priority.\n\n\"The doubling of students involved in adult and sex work over two years is alarming and very concerning. But it's not all that unexpected, given the financial situation students are put in,\" he said.\n\n\"It is more important than ever for students to be aware of the financial pressures from the outset, so they can plan and budget effectively.\"", "description": "A growing number of students sell intimate pictures online or more to pay for university life, a survey says.", "authors": ["Kevin Peachey", "Personal Finance Reporter"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/13D47/production/_109332218_couple2_getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
