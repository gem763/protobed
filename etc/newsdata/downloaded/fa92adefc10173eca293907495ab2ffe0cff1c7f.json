I haven't been engaged in real life or onscreen,\" says Fanning, who admits the \"Maleficent\" sequel (in theaters Friday) has set the proposal bar impossibly high. \"Harris is the perfect prince. And we wanted to make it as authentic and magical a fairy-tale proposal as possible. We wanted to bring the happiness and joy of it.\"\n\nThe battle for Angelina's lip color: A perfect Russian Red in 'Maleficent 2'\n\nReview: Angelina Jolie's 'Maleficent 2' is like a dark and magical 'Meet the Fockers'\n\nElle Fanning's Princess Aurora gets a fairy-tale engagement with Harris Dickinson's Prince Phillip in \"Maleficent: Mistress of Evil.\" (Photo: JAAP BUITENDIJK/DISNEY)\n\nSure, there were multiple takes of the scene. And when Aurora speaks to fairies, they were added later through CGI (\"Sometimes you feel a little crazy talking to nothing, but it's my job\"). But the nature-filled set was very there and very alive for the proposal.\n\n\"The set was huge and built of real grass, real flowers and even real trees. Everything,\" Fanning says. The climate had to be maintained for temperature and humidity, and stagehands had to water the plants during breaks. \"So I did feel it, especially with the smells of nature. Even the river was realistic.\"\n\nThen there was the silk tulle dress, with hand-embroidered layers in baby blue, pink and lavender, \"so that depending on the light, you might see a different color,\" costume designer Ellen Mirojnick says. Fanning also wore a wreath with real flowers on her head and held the ensemble together with a daisy chain belt.\n\n\"The entire overdress was hand embroidered one leaf at a time, in a way only fairies can make it,\" Mirojnick says. \"It was important to have the most magical feel. Aurora is Queen of the Moors. These are robes of her queendom.\u201d\n\nPrince Phillip (Harris Dickinson) pops the question to Aurora (Elle Fanning) amid a beautiful nature setting. \"We wanted to make it as authentic and magical a fairy-tale proposal as possible,\" Fanning says. \"We wanted to bring the happiness and joy of it.\" (Photo: JAAP BUITENDIJK/DISNEY)\n\nThe scene is crucial. When Fanning signed on for the first \"Maleficent,\" she was only 14, playing the goddaughter of the titular dark fairy played by Angelina Jolie. Now Aurora is grown and making decisions on her own, as established immediately with her quick yes to her prince.\n\n\"This is Aurora's introduction,\" Fanning says. \"If you don\u2019t believe the romance and love Aurora and the prince have for each other, then you don\u2019t believe their journey.\"\n\nMaleficent, as the trailer shows, isn't pleased her goddaughter is getting married, especially to the son of Queen Ingrith (Michelle Pfeiffer), who becomes a blood rival. The affairs of the kingdom go south as war breaks out between Maleficent's fairy kingdom and humans.\n\nPrince Phillip (Harris Dickinson, left) introduces his fiancee Aurora (Elle Fanning) to dad King John (Robert Lindsay) and Queen Ingrith (Michelle Pfeiffer) in \"Maleficent: Mistress of Evil.\" (Photo: JAAP BUITENDIJK)\n\nIt all puts a crimp in the wedding plans. But the fight for motherly affection between Ingrith and Maleficent leads to three beautiful potential wedding dresses. The one bestowed by Maleficent is made of layered chiffon, covered with flowers fashioned from laser-cut feathers.\n\nScenes where Aurora tries on this dress were shot outdoors amid muddy surroundings. Fanning spent her downtime in the relative safety of a stable to protect the gown.\n\n\"So I'd stand alone in this horse barn,\" Fanning says. \"But I was so happy in there, because I was wearing the most beautiful dress.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/10/16/maleficent-2-elle-fanning-cherishes-her-disney-perfect-engagement/3988045002/", "description": "Angelina Jolie's \"Maleficent: Mistress of Evil\" sequel begins with Elle Fanning's Princess Aurora and her stunning storybook engagement to a prince.", "authors": ["Bryan Alexander", "Published P.M.
