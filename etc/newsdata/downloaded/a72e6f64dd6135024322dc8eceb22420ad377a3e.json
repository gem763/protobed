Typhoon Hagibis' arrival is imminent in Japan, but thankfully this match remains unaffected.\n\nAustralia will qualify for the quarter-finals if they win today. A victory, too, will mean the Wallabies will top Pool D if Wales fail to beat Uruguay on Sunday. Georgia, meanwhile, need a win today to put themselves in contention to finish third in the pool, but Uruguay will have a chance to finish third if they beat Wales with a four-try bonus point.\n\nThe ulterior motive for today's match, however, assuming the results in both of Pool D's remaining matches go as expected, is to keep an eye on England's probable quarter-finalists, Australia. The Wallabies are almost at full-strength today - a notable absentee is captain Michael Hooper, who has been rested - and they will be hoping to accelerate into the quarter-finals with solid winning momentum after a mixed campaign so far.\n\nMatt Toomua will run the show from fly-half, which is an intriguing selection by head coach Michael Cheika. Traditionally a centre, Toomua has been given a shot to display his fly-half credentials, as regulars Foley and Lealiifano have failed to set this Wallaby side alight thus far in the tournament. A strong showing today, following his emphatic introduction off the bench in the spirited second-half comeback against Wales, could see Toomua handed he No 10 shirt for the expected quarter-final against England.\n\nGeorgia, meanwhile, have shown signs of their menacing selves in patches this tournament, but are yet to string a full 80-minute performance together against a top side, a side to which they aspire to compete with regularly. A good win against Uruguay came after an abysmal opening 40 minutes against Wales, while their match against Fiji was close for 60 minutes until the rampant Fijian backs pulled away in the final quarter. Although a win today might not be on the agenda for coaches Milton Haig, Graham Rowntree and Joe Worsely, an improved performance extended over the full course of the match will be a priority.", "description": "Australia lurched into the World Cup quarter-finals with an unconvincing 27-8 bonus-point victory over Georgia in their Pool D clash on Friday amid swirling winds and rain at Shizuoka Stadium as Typhoon Hagibis started to make its presence felt.", "authors": ["Charles Richardson", "Will Greenwood", "Mike Davison", "Sir Ian Mcgeechan"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/rugby-world-cup/2019/10/11/TELEMMGLPICT000212723702-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqM37qcIWR9CtrqmiMdQVx7PVyrEkZLfZX-l1bJVAr838.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
