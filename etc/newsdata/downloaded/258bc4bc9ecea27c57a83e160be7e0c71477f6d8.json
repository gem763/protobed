The price band from R700 000 to R1.8 million was the best performing segment, with volumes increasing by 5% year on year, followed by the price band between R1.8 million and R3.5 million, which reflected growth of 2.4% over the same period.\n\nAdds Day: \u201cToday\u2019s home buyers are increasingly tech-savvy, as borne out by our website statistics, which reflected 129% more page views as well as 129% more buyer leads in August compared to the monthly average for the year to date.\n\n\u201cAs the fixed-fee method of selling homes becomes entrenched in the marketplace, we anticipate further growth in sales activity.\u201d\n\nFor further information contact Eazi on 0860 000 777 or email claire.leske@eazi.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe post Increasing Activity In Price Band Below R3 Million, Says Eazi appeared first on iAfrica.com.", "description": "Increasing Activity In Price Band Below R3 Million, Says Eazi", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/news_six_pile_69x52._800x533_L_1419494215.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
