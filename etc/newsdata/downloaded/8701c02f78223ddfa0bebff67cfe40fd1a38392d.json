The next closest were Indiana and Georgia, with 6 percent of meetings each, according to Chao\u2019s calendar records, the only ones that have been made public.\n\nAt least five of Chao\u2019s 18 meetings with Kentuckians were requested in emails from McConnell staffers, who alerted Chao\u2019s staffers which of the officials were \u201cfriends\u201d or \u201cloyal supporters,\u201d according to records obtained under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nThe emails from McConnell\u2019s office to Chao\u2019s staff sometimes included details about projects that participants wanted to discuss with the secretary, or to ask her for special favors. Some of the officials who met with Chao had active grant applications before the Department of Transportation through competitive programs and the emails indicate that the meetings sometimes involved the exchange of information about grants and opportunities for the officials to plead their cases directly to Chao.\n\nAfter a meeting in the spring, the mayor of Owensboro, Ky., a McConnell stronghold that had earlier received $11.5 million in DOT funding, thanked Todd Inman, a former McConnell campaign staffer working with Chao, for assembling \u201cso many high level staffers. . . [to] answer questions and give advice on transit, roads and the political process needed to move our projects along such as I-165.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen, the icing on the cake, time with Secretary Chao herself. What a kind and generous lady, not to mention extremely smart, a true public servant, and a great friend to OBKY,\u201d the Owensboro mayor, Tom Watson, wrote in May, 2019.\n\nThe fact that Chao\u2019s calendar shows that 1 out of every 4 meetings with local officials was with Kentuckians is significant because the department has long maintained that it, and she, have shown no favoritism to the state represented by her husband, even while local officials from other states have complained about having trouble getting to see her.\n\nThe meetings also cast light on the ethical challenges of having a married couple as Transportation secretary and Senate majority leader. Federal ethics rules strictly prohibit any actions by government officials that benefit them personally or their close family members; McConnell and Chao\u2019s political and personal fortunes are inextricably tied, and his re-election campaign frequently cites his ability to deliver federal dollars to his home state.\n\n\u201cThe marriage is the thing that underlies all of this,\u201d said Mel Dubnick, a professor of government ethics and accountability at the University of New Hampshire. Home-state bias in the federal government is a common issue in federal grant-making, he said, but Chao\u2019s marriage to the country\u2019s most powerful lawmaker makes the arrangement almost unprecedented.\n\nMcConnell \u2013 who, like many congressional leaders, has faced complaints from constituents of devoting more time to national issues than local concerns \u2013 points to his role in obtaining funds for local Kentucky communities as proof that he\u2019s not lost touch with folks back home, and that his leadership post furthers their interests.\n\nIn a recent Morning Consult poll, only 36 percent of Kentuckians approved of his performance, the lowest of any senator facing re-election in 2020. But McConnell answers his critics by citing his support for President Donald Trump and his ability to deliver grants \u2013 some of which are from the department his wife leads.\n\n\u201cThere are some distinct advantages to having me as the majority leader of the United States Senate,\u201d he said at the August 2018, Fancy Farm picnic in western Kentucky. \u201cI\u2019m in a position to take special care of Kentucky.\u201d\n\nJesse Benton, who was McConnell\u2019s campaign manager for the bulk of the 2014 race, said the senator\u2019s ability to flex his power in Washington resonates with Kentucky voters, even if he isn\u2019t particularly well-liked.\n\n\u201cI started off thinking we needed to do things to. . . make people see what a warm guy he is,\u201d said Benton. \u201cPeople didn\u2019t care. What they wanted to see was a McConnell who was powerful, strong and putting Kentucky first, whether it means keeping Kentucky in national conversations, or whether he\u2019s making sure they take their fair share of federal program money.\u201d\n\nThat apparently includes his ability to help constituents get meetings with his wife, who controls one of the richest sources of federal outlays. Chao and other Transportation officials declined through the department\u2019s media office to be interviewed. In an emailed statement, a DOT spokesperson said, \u201cThe Office of the Secretary has an open-door policy, and welcomes meetings from all state and local officials across the country. Any suggestion to the contrary is not based in fact.\u201d\n\nThe spokesperson added that \u201cin the past week alone, the Department met with 28 state, local, and tribal delegations\u201d but, when asked, declined to say how many of those meetings, if any, the secretary herself had sat in on.\n\nSome local officials, however, say they have found it nearly impossible to reach Chao personally, even to discuss the largest projects in the country.\n\n\u201cEver since she came in, it\u2019s been very hard to figure out how to get time with her,\u201d said Beth Osborne, executive director of Transportation for America, an organization which advises cities on transportation and urban planning. \u201cAt the beginning of the administration we got a lot of questions about what it takes to meet with the secretary. People don\u2019t ask anymore. It\u2019s like they\u2019ve given up.\u201d\n\nOsborne, who was deputy and then acting assistant secretary for transportation policy under Transportation Secretaries Ray LaHood and Anthony Foxx in the Obama administration, noted that Chao\u2019s light schedule of meetings with state and local officials \u201cstands in stark contrast\u201d to those secretaries, who instructed aides to accommodate as many meeting requests as possible.\n\nRather than ask to meet with Chao in Washington, Osborne said, she often recommends that local leaders invite the secretary to their town to see the project for herself, so that then when she has a grant application in her hands she\u2019ll remember her personal experience with that project. \u201cAnd while I was giving that recommendation I kept hearing from folks, \u2018Oh, she doesn\u2019t accept invitations to such things. She just doesn\u2019t do that.\u2019 And I heard that repeatedly: \u2018We offered and we were told she just doesn\u2019t do trips. That\u2019s just not her thing.\u2019\u201d\n\nA DOT spokesman said Chao has traveled to 31 states during the two-and-a-half years she\u2019s been in office and meets with state and local officials on most of those trips.\n\nThe DOT spokesman also defended Chao\u2019s meetings with officials from Kentucky, saying it\u2019s natural for her to meet with them \u201cgiven her home-state ties \u2014 she\u2019s a proud Kentuckian.\u201d\n\nKentucky, however, is an adopted home for Chao, who married McConnell in 1993, during his second term in the Senate. She was raised in New York after having emigrated from Taiwan at the age of eight. Many of her close family members still live in New York, and her family\u2019s shipping business is based in New York City.\n\nYet officials from the New York and New Jersey area say they yearn for the kind of attention she gives to her husband\u2019s constituents. While officials from small towns in Kentucky got to sit down with the secretary in the ninth-floor Lincoln conference room at department headquarters to discuss riverfront projects and highway improvements, she has given the cold shoulder to those advocating for one of the country\u2019s largest infrastructure projects: the repair and replacement of the bridges and tunnels connecting New York and New Jersey that together are known as Gateway.\n\n\u201cOne can\u2019t help but think: Would we have already broken ground on Gateway if it were located in Kentucky, not New Jersey and New York?\" Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-N.J.) said last June in reference to previous POLITICO reporting on Chao\u2019s favoritism toward Kentucky.\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, said he has had better luck getting time with President Donald Trump than Chao.\n\n\u201cI've spoken to the president on a couple of occasions,\u201d he said at a roundtable on Gateway in May. \u201cAs a general matter, I have gotten a sense of goodwill in those conversations from him, but the direction has been to take it up with Secretary Chao. I have attempted, at his direction, we have attempted to get on the phone. I've offered to come and sit before her and so far that has not happened. We had a call scheduled that was canceled, at least once if not twice. So it's been frustrating.\u201d\n\nMurphy did speak with Chao by phone shortly after he made these comments.\n\nMeanwhile, Chao has yet to meet with another entity with a tense relationship with DOT: the California High-Speed Rail Authority, from which DOT clawed back nearly $1 billion in rail funds earlier this year. The authority is looking to build a high-speed connection between the cities of San Francisco and Los Angeles, which is intended to compress a six-hour car ride into a two-hour-and-forty-minute train trip.\n\n\u201cWe have made numerous attempts to meet with the secretary and the administrator\u2019s office, and we hope such a meeting can still occur,\u201d said California High-Speed Rail Authority spokeswoman Annie Parker.\n\nWhen asked whether Chao had met with the high speed rail authority, a DOT spokesman responded that she had spoken with California Gov. Gavin Newsom at the White House, which Newsom's office said was a reception for the National Governor's Association.\n\nThe American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, a coalition of state transportation departments, on the other hand, says Chao has been \u201cvery accessible.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t heard anything from our members to say that they feel like there\u2019s been any preferential treatment one way or the other,\u201d said Lloyd Brown, communications director at AASHTO, noting that Chao has met with the group\u2019s entire board of directors.\n\nThough POLITICO\u2019s analysis extends only for the 14-month period covered by the calendars that DOT released following an open records lawsuit brought by liberal watchdog group American Oversight, local news reports show that Chao continues to give facetime to Kentuckians. In September 2019, the Paducah, Kentucky, Chamber of Commerce traveled to Washington to ask DOT for $15 million for local riverfront and riverport improvements as well as funding for a new terminal at Barkley Regional Airport.\n\nAfter having met with McConnell and others in the state\u2019s congressional delegation, according to local reporting, \u201cChao surprised the group and welcomed the west Kentucky contingent,\u201d noting that \u201cthe grant application process is competitive\u201d and that \u201cshe loves the entire Paducah riverfront area.\u201d\n\nShe signaled that DOT was giving the city\u2019s grant request close attention.\n\n\u201cAs we go forward for new and additional needs for the airport, we want to be helpful,\" she told the group, according to WPSD, a western Kentucky TV station. \"I can't promise anything right now, but I can say for the first time in a long time Paducah's going to have a fair shot.\"\n\nAfter noting how competitive it can be to get federal transportation money, the station\u2019s report added, \u201cThat\u2019s why it goes a long way to shake hands and meet face to face with the people making the decisions.\u201d\n\n***\n\nChao\u2019s meetings with Kentucky officials included state legislators, mayors, county executives, airport directors and other elected officials, nearly all of whom had grant applications or other official business before the department.\n\nOne county official emailed a McConnell staffer discussing how he wanted to head off the Federal Highway Administration, which was advocating for a highway sewer pipe upgrade that he said would cost the county $1 million. Another official hoped to pitch Chao on a transportation project in Southeastern Kentucky that would help put \u201ccoal miners back to work.\u201d\n\nMcConnell\u2019s staff noted when meeting requests came from officials with close ties to the majority leader.\n\nOne constituent, a private consultant who sits on the board of Kentuckians for Better Transportation, an umbrella advocacy group composed of politicians, chambers of commerce and businesses, relayed in an email to McConnell\u2019s office that the majority leader himself had suggested a meeting with Chao.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s staffers typically forwarded the requests directly to Inman of DOT, whom Chao had hired as her Director of Operations in early 2017. POLITICO has previously reported that Inman served as a special point-of-contact for Kentuckians with business before the Secretary \u2014 a claim the department has repeatedly denied.\n\nInman, who has now advanced to be Chao\u2019s chief of staff, helped arrange meetings once he received the forwarded requests. In one instance, Inman helped set up a meeting that DOT staff had planned to decline when it was initially requested through other channels. He reconsidered after the request came directly from McConnell's office.\n\n\u201cI will revisit with her as we initially were going to decline,\u201d Inman wrote to McConnell\u2019s Kentucky State Director Terry Carmack.\n\n\u201cSo in cases like this, if [Elaine Chao] can\u2019t do it, is it possible to host them at DOT, and get an assistant secretary or 2 to meet with them?\u201d Carmack replied. \u201cThat way it is not taking up the Secretary\u2019s time but they feel special. Just a thought.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Chao held the meeting as requested in May 2017.\n\nAccording to Chao\u2019s official calendar logs, Inman was listed as an attendee for nearly 90 percent of her meetings with Kentucky state and local officials, but fewer than half of her meetings with officials from other states.\n\nA Department of Transportation spokesperson said that the attendee lists do not necessarily reflect who actually attended a particular meeting, and that many staffers are added to calendar events simply for awareness.\n\nHowever, public records obtained by POLITICO show that Inman followed up with meeting participants via phone and email, offering extra information and useful favors from his position in the department.\n\nInman was frequently in contact with local officials from his hometown of Owensboro, which successfully applied for an $11.5 million grant after multiple meetings with Chao. Over email, Inman gave local leaders advice about securing letters of support for their project from McConnell\u2019s and Rep. Brett Guthrie\u2019s offices, and then forwarded those letters to Chao through a direct channel, \u201cso she will see it tonight,\u201d according to Inman.\n\nIn another exchange, an Owensboro official asked Inman if the city\u2019s initial application for a grant had been successful, or if they should begin spending resources on a second application. While the grant winners had not yet been announced, Inman suggested that an award was unlikely this round \u2014 referencing his knowledge of high-level DOT decision-making \u2014 and advised the official to begin work on a second application.\n\nInman also offered access to higher ranking DOT officials after learning that the Owensboro official was planning to meet with lower-ranking contacts in the Maritime Administration.\n\n\u201cI can see about getting your meeting elevated,\u201d Inman wrote, \u201cthe Administrator and Deputy Administrator are good friends and always welcoming.\u201d\n\nInman\u2019s efforts were also appreciated elsewhere in Kentucky.\n\nInman phoned and emailed with Boone County Judge-Executive Gary Moore, who met with Chao in December 2017. After winning a $67 million transportation grant in 2018, Moore wrote to Inman to express his gratitude for \u201cyour work and the valuable advise [sic] along the way.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was back in Kentucky doing some state visits in August and your name came up during some of my meetings,\u201d a McConnell staffer wrote to Inman in September 2017. \u201cEveryone is very appreciative of the great work you are doing up here.\u201d\n\n***\n\nThe attention Chao has shown toward her adopted home state dovetails with the electoral objectives of her husband, who for years has boasted about his ability to leverage his influence in Washington to help Kentucky \u2014 including as he gears up for his 2020 reelection.\n\n\u201cAs the only one of the four congressional leaders who isn\u2019t from the coastal states of New York or California, I view it as my job to look out for middle America and of course Kentucky in particular,\u201d he wrote in a May op-ed for Kentucky Today, the online publication of the Kentucky Baptist Convention. \u201cThat means I use my position as Majority Leader to advance Kentucky\u2019s priorities.\u201d\n\nThat could be especially important as Democrats target his seat, having recruited the heavily financed former fighter pilot Amy McGrath to run against him, and as he increasingly relies on his ties to Trump to argue for reelection. When he appeared at Fancy Farms in 2018, a key stop for campaigns in the Bluegrass State, the Senate majority leader had to strain to be heard above the heckling of activists in the crowd.\n\nWhile Steve Robertson, a former state GOP chairman, said he doubts that Kentucky voters specifically view McConnell\u2019s marriage to Chao as a sign of his influence, the senator\u2019s clout \u201cabsolutely contributes to his ability to withstand what people inside the beltway think are political headwinds,\u201d he said.\n\nAs such, Chao\u2019s efforts to give special attention to Kentucky officials \u2014 even if couched in terms like giving them a \u201cfair shot\u201d \u2014 concern experts in government ethics.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s delivering transportation time and resources to Kentucky citizens in a manner that\u2019s not consistent with other states,\u201d said Virginia Canter, chief ethics counsel at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a watchdog group.\n\n\u201cIt looks like constituent services,\u201d she continued.\n\nMcConnell, never one to apologize for his brand of politics, has done little to clear up perceptions of special treatment for Kentucky.\n\nWhen asked for comment for this story, McConnell said in an email, \u201cCommunities throughout Kentucky were awarded competitive federal grants, bringing critical resources to projects in our state. I was proud to support many of these applications. If you are interested in applying for competitive federal grants, I hope you will contact my office.\u201d His office also sent a rundown of other federal grants McConnell helped secure, including $743,000 for drone technology and $11 million for the Blue Grass Airport near Lexington.\n\nIn June, when reporters asked the senator if he was getting special treatment from his wife\u2019s department, McConnell quipped: \u201cYou know, I was complaining to [Chao] just last night, 169 projects and Kentucky got only five.\u201d\n\nFederal ethics regulations stipulate that employees in the executive branch should not participate in matters in which family members or business associates have a stake: \u201cWhere the employee determines that the circumstances would cause a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts to question his impartiality in the matter, the employee should not participate in the matter,\u201d the regulations state.\n\nBut there\u2019s no statutory mechanism to mandate recusals at such senior levels in the department, at least not for cases like this, Dubnick, the University of New Hampshire professor, said.\n\nAs such, while Chao\u2019s coziness to Kentucky interests could help her husband win elections in a historically poor state where federal dollars have long carried extra weight, she may not be breaking any rules.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing illegal about what\u2019s going on, as long as there\u2019s no quid pro quo,\u201d Dubnick said.\n\nMcConnell, as he\u2019s done in the past, can point out that he\u2019s simply helping his state. The department, as it\u2019s done in the past, can point out that Kentucky ranks roughly in the middle in the amount of DOT program money it receives, and that, of course, Chao loves her adopted home state.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not so much an issues state so much as a patronage state,\u201d said longtime political columnist Al Cross. \u201cWe want things from the federal government. I look at patronage in the larger sense, it\u2019s bringing home the bacon. And Kentuckians appreciate his ability to bring home the bacon.\u201d\n\n", "description": "In her first 14 months as Transportation secretary, Elaine Chao met with officials from Kentucky, which her husband Mitch McConnell represents in the Senate, vastly more often than those from any other state.
