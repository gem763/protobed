He pledged to make reforms, but this drew a scornful response from demonstrators.\n\nThe violent protests have escalated by the day since they first erupted on Tuesday, sweeping across the country spontaneously without public backing from any organised political group and taking the authorities by surprise.\n\nPlay Video Iraq protests intensify amid 'near-blackout' of internet \u2013 video\n\nSecurity forces have fired live ammunition at crowds of mainly young men, and gunmen have occasionally fired back. Hundreds of people have been wounded, including members of the security forces as well as demonstrators.\n\nPolice and medical sources told Reuters the death toll included 18 people killed in the southern city of Nassiriya, 16 in the capital, Baghdad, four in the southern city of Amara and four in Baquba, north of the capital. Other deaths were reported in two more southern cities, Hilla and Najaf.\n\nCurfews were imposed in a number of cities. Authorities shut roads into the capital from the north and north-east and were sending reinforcements to Baghdad\u2019s densely-populated east. Military convoys were being sent to Nassiriya, the city worst hit by the violence.\n\nProtesters in Baghdad gathered in darkness by a bonfire set among the flaming wreckage of an armoured vehicle, across the Tigris River from the government compound.\n\n\u201cThey are shooting live fire at the Iraqi people and the revolutionaries.

It is also the first test for Abdul-Mahdi, installed last year by Shia parties that have dominated Iraq since the 2003 fall of Saddam Hussein.\n\nIt comes on the eve of the Arbaeen Shia pilgrimage, which in recent years has drawn as many as 20 million worshippers, trekking for days on foot across southern Iraq in the world\u2019s biggest annual gathering, 10 times the size of the Mecca Hajj.\n\nBaghdad was quieter early on Friday ahead of Muslim prayers, although police fired live ammunition again in the morning to disperse small crowds. As well as the ongoing curfew, defied by thousands of demonstrators on Thursday, army and special forces were deployed around central squares and streets.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Protesters in Baghdad\u2019s central Tayeran Square on Thursday.

He said a basic wage for poor families would be discussed by the government, but said there were no \u201cmagic solutions\u201d.\n\nOther politicians were awaiting a pronouncement from Iraq\u2019s most senior Shia clergy, expected as part of Friday sermons. The protests could grow if they receive formal backing from the opposition political bloc of the cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who has long denounced corruption and the political elite.\n\n'Iraq is dying': oil flows freely but corruption fuels growing anger Read more\n\nTwo years after the defeat of the Islamic State Sunni militant movement, Iraq has finally been at peace and free to trade for the first extended period since the 1970s. Oil production is at record levels providing windfall income for Baghdad. Yet after decades of war and sanctions, its infrastructure is still decrepit, cities are in ruins and there are few employment opportunities for a population of 40 million.\n\nProtesters say funds are being siphoned off by political parties who have a firm grip on power in Baghdad.", "description": "Fourth day of protests against living standards as PM says there are no \u2018magic solutions\u2019", "authors": ["Reuters In Baghdad"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bde82cba64ee15d978c41c1e319e48c2fcc4dfa8/0_99_2768_1661/master/2768.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d9c7cc41309be4d84c7e8086e92d64f8", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
