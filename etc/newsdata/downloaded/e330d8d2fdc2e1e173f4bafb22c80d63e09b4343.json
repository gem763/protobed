Not Chinese Crypto Traders, Apparently", "language": "en", "text": "Bitcoin has seen an absolute whirlwind of the past 48 hours. As you likely know, the leading cryptocurrency has traded within a massive $3,300 price range as crypto markets have incurred their latest bout of volatility after weeks of lull. At its local peak, Bitcoin was trading for $10,500; now, BTC is changing hands for $9,300.\n\nDue to the absurd strength of this move, investors were quick to ask, \u201cwhat the hell caused Bitcoin to shoot to the moon?\u201d\n\nThe most obvious answer to this pressing question was President Xi Jinping\u2019s endorsement of blockchain technologies.\n\nOn Friday, Oct. 25, Chinese state media outlets reported that President Xi called for the adoption of blockchain \u201cas an important breakthrough for independent innovation of core technologies\u201d in a meeting of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s Central Committee.\n\nState-run outlet Xinhua revealed that Xi lauded the potential benefits of blockchain technologies in a swath of industries, including finance, education, health care, food security, and more.\n\nBitcoin rallied shortly after this story was released. But according to Dovey Wan, Primitive Ventures founding partner, it wasn\u2019t Chinese traders reacting to this story that sent BTC rocketing higher.\n\nBitcoin Boom Unlikely Caused by President Xi\u2019s Love for Blockchain\n\nSpeaking to cryptocurrency television outlet BlockTV in a recent interview, Wan stated that her hypothesis is that it is western traders that drove \u201cthe majority of the Bitcoin price rally\u201d from $7,300 to $10,600. She added that western traders overreacted to this news.\n\nBacking her sentiment, Wan later remarked that Tether\u2019s USDT has seen no premium on OTC markets in China, the price didn\u2019t move immediately after the release of Xinhua\u2019s aforementioned article, the price pumped as the U.S. woke up and shared President Xi Jinping\u2019s statements, and the Bitcoin buying volume was not centralized on Huobi or OkEX.\n\nAlex Kr\u00fcger pointed out a statistic that may corroborate Wan\u2019s analysis. The macroeconomy and crypto researcher noted that on Baidu \u2014 China\u2019s equivalent of Google \u2014 searches for the Chinese equivalent of the term \u201cblockchain\u201d exploded and hit an all-time high as the trend for \u201cBitcoin\u201d moved higher, but only marginally.\n\nInterest in Bitcoin in China has barely edged up. Chart shows Baidu searches for Bitcoin (blue) vs Blockchain (red). Looks very conclusive to me, particularly so given the price spike. pic.twitter.com/UGwU5416jO \u2014 Alex Kr\u00fcger (@krugermacro) October 26, 2019\n\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "description": "Bitcoin has seen an absolute whirlwind of the past 48 hours.
