It likely isn\u2019t his first date, but the man keeps a pretty low profile so this is the first time he\u2019s been papped with a lady friend.\n\nAfter weeks of hiding out back home in Byron Bay with brother Chris and his family, the 29-year-old actor has popped up in NYC holding hands with a new girl.\n\nWhile Miley\u2019s type is famous Aussies, it\u2019s clear that Liam\u2019s a pretty big fan of drop-dead gorgeous blonde bombshells.\n\nAccording to the sleuths in the After Work Drinks Podcast\u2019s closed Facebook group, the mystery girl appears to be fellow Aussie Maddison Brown. Maddison is a model and actress, most famous for her work in The Kettering Incident and Dynasty.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s not confirmed, the mystery girl sure does look a lot like Maddison.\n\nHemsworth and maybe Maddison shared some laughs over a meal and some cheeky bevvies at Sant Ambroeus, then went for a cute stroll around the city, which is pretty daring when you\u2019ve got TMZ on your back.\n\nUnlike Miley, who has been very public with her new whatever-the-fuck-is-going-on-with-Cody-Simpsonship, Liam prefers to keep it a little more low key.\n\nIt\u2019s been a wild ride since Miley and Liam (aka our favourite teenage couple) called it quits back in August. We\u2019ve seen Miley and Kaitlynn, then they called it quits. Now we\u2019re seeing Miley and Cody Simpson, but this is the first time we\u2019re seeing Liam with a new lady friend. So what does it mean? I MUST KNOW.\n\nIt was just a few days ago that sources told Cosmopolitan that Liam is open to meeting new people, so maybe there will be no need for a Hemsworth Bachie season.\n\nWe couldn\u2019t afford to hire our own personal paparazzi to follow Liam\u2019s every move, but apparently TMZ can, so you can check out the pics here.", "description": "Aussie hunk and Miley Cyrus' ex-husband Liam Hemsworth has been spotted on a date with a mystery woman & fans have their guesses as to who it is.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1144489852.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
