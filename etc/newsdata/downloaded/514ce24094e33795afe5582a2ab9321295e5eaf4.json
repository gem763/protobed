And audiences are coming to their shows in respectable numbers.\n\nAmong the latest productions in this vein are \u201c Derren Brown : Secret\u201d and \u201cFreestyle Love Supreme.\u201d\n\nThe former brings the British mind-reader and illusionist, who has played sold-out runs in London\u2019s West End, to Broadway for the first time. The latter is a show that blends hip-hop and improvisation and was created by \u201cHamilton\u201d composer Lin-Manuel Miranda in collaboration with Thomas Kail and Anthony Veneziale.\n\n\u201cDerren Brown: Secret\u201d opened Sunday to positive reviews. The show is also off to a solid start at the box office, according to figures from the Broadway League, an industry trade group. It drew an audience of 94% capacity during the past week\u2019s run of seven shows, which included six preview performances. (Attendance did, however, include several members of the press as is typical during the preview period.)\n\n\u201cFreestyle Love Supreme\u201d started playing previews this past week. Over four preview performances, it played to an audience of 89% capacity.\n\nOther nontheatrical shows have had notable runs on Broadway in the past year. Most notably, a series of presentations at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre, including those by such high-profile acts as Barry Manilow and Dave Chappelle, did fairly well. In particular, Mr. Chappelle played a nearly sold-out run of 10 shows.\n\nMichael Rego, a partner in the Araca Group, one of the producers behind the Lunt-Fontanne series, said it \u201cfar exceeded our expectations.\u201d He added that he hopes to bring more nontheatrical presentations to Broadway.\n\n\u201cOur model is something we\u2019re going to keep utilizing for years to come,\u201d he said.\n\nIn many ways, the precedent for this approach is Bruce Springsteen \u2019s massively successful 14-month stint on Broadway, which ended in December 2018. His show, which was something of a concert-play hybrid, sold out every performance and grossed $113 million for the run.\n\n\u2018Derren Brown: Secret\u2019 opened Sunday to positive reviews.

Mr. Springsteen\u2019s show was presented at the Walter Kerr Theatre, a Jujamcyn venue.\n\nSome nontheatrical shows have already been announced for the months ahead. Among them is a return of \u201cThe Illusionists,\u201d a magic-themed show that has become a fixture on Broadway during the winter holiday season.\n\nAlso on tap: Veteran jazz and popular musician Harry Connick, Jr. , will present a tribute to Cole Porter, with previews slated to begin in December.\n\nWrite to Charles Passy at cpassy@wsj.com", "description": "Concert stars, comedians and other nontheatrical artists are finding their way to the Great White Way.
