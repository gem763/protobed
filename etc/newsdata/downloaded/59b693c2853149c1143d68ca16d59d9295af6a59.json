Ted Cruz, Texas Republican, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, New York Democrat, may not have much in common, but they do agree on this: They want the NBA to place its activities in China on hold.\n\nIn a letter Wednesday to NBA commissioner Adam Silver, eight lawmakers urged the league to \u201c[s]uspend NBA activities in China until government-controlled broadcasters and government-controlled commercial sponsors end their boycott of NBA activities and the selective treatment of the Houston Rockets.\u201d\n\nThe letter also called on the league to \u201creevaluate the NBA\u2019s training camp in Xinjiang, where up to a million Chinese citizens are held in concentration camps as part of a massive, government-run campaign of ethno-religious repression.\u201d\n\nThe letter came with Mr. Silver headed to Shanghai after Chinese broadcasters suspended airing preseason games and cancelled several NBA Cares events after Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted support for the pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cWe believe that any speech that challenges national sovereignty and social stability is not within the scope of freedom of speech,\u201d said the statement by China\u2019s CCTV.\n\nAfter the NBA issued an initial statement expressing regret over Mr. Morey\u2019s tweet, Mr. Silver took a stronger stance Tuesday, saying \u201cthe NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues. We simply could not operate that way.\u201d\n\nIn their letter, the members of Congress noted that \u201cNBA players have a rich history of speaking out on sensitive topics of social justice and human rights inside the United States, and the NBA takes pride in defending their right to do so.\u201d\n\n\u201cYet while it is easy to defend freedom of speech when it costs you nothing, equivocating when profits are at stake is a betrayal of fundamental American values,\u201d the letter said.\n\nThe CCP wants to dictate the parameters of acceptable speech worldwide. As Americans, we have an obligation to stand tall in defense of our values. Read my bipartisan letter to the @NBA with @SenSasse, @RepMalinowski, @AOC, @SenTomCotton and colleagues.https://t.co/GBzoUX4kGp \u2014 Rep. Mike Gallagher (@RepGallagher) October 9, 2019\n\nThe letter also urged the league to clarify its commitment to free speech, and that \u201cpublic commentary on international human rights repression\u2014including in Tibet, Hong Kong, and Xinjiang\u2014falls within expected standards of public behavior and expression.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Mr. Cruz and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, the members of Congress signing the letter are Sens. Tom Cotton, Arkansas Republican; Ben Sasse, Nebraska Republican; Ron Wyden, Oregon Democrat; and Reps. Jim Banks, Indiana Republican; Mike Gallagher, Wisconsin Republican, and Tom Malinowski, New Jersey Democrat.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
