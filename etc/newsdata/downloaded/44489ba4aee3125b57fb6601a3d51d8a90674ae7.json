On Thursday night the president tweeted: \"As the President of the United States, I have an absolute right, perhaps even a duty, to investigate, or have investigated, CORRUPTION, and that would include asking, or suggesting, other Countries to help us out!\"\n\nYates, however, sees it differently.\n\nBIDEN: 'THE IDEA OF DONALD TRUMP ATTACKING ANYONE'S INTEGRITY IS A JOKE'\n\n\"After being caught secretly strong-arming Ukraine, POTUS is trying to hypnotize the American people into believing it can\u2019t be wrong if he says it out loud,\" Yates said in a tweet of her own.\n\n\"And if he actually thinks he has the 'absolute right' to sic foreign powers on political rivals, he\u2019s even more dangerous.\"\n\nYates served as acting attorney general for 10 days in January 2017 following the departure of Loretta Lynch on January 20.

Mitt Romney, R-Utah.\n\n\u201cWhen the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China\u2019s investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process, it strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated,\u201d Romney tweeted.", "description": "Former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates blasted President Trump on Friday, accusing him of attempting to \"hypnotize the American people\" into thinking his actions are \"absolutely right.\"", "authors": ["Joseph Wulfsohn", "Joseph A.
