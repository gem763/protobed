The impassioned 16-year-old climate activist is now the subject of countless news articles, angry tweets, and not surprisingly, a whole host of uncharitable memes.\n\nA polarizing force, you either love her for her devoted climate fervor or you hate her for the public spanking that she unleashed on world leaders for not taking the impending climate doom seriously enough. She has shamed politicians and individuals and has unapologetically called on the world to panic along with her.\n\nBut does Greta really buy what she\u2019s selling? And does her carbon footprint line up with this passion that is made clear by the static pained expression that lingers on her face?\n\nRegardless of your personal thoughts on what Greta believes is a climate catastrophe, it\u2019s rather plausible that Greta believes what she\u2019s saying. But let\u2019s look at her carbon footprint\u2014the amount of greenhouse gases produced to support her activist lifestyle.\n\nThe three biggest sources of greenhouse gas emissions from human activities in the United States stem from burning fossil fuels to generate electricity and heat, and burning fossil fuels for transportation, according to the United states Environmental Protection Agency. Of those three, transportation is the biggest, accounting for 29 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions, at least in the US.\n\nPart of Greta\u2019s activist lifestyle has her jet setting\u2014or more appropriately sail setting\u2014around the globe to a major degree. She most recently traveled to the United States, and is now about to embark on a whirlwind tour as part of her global climate strike, and won\u2019t return to Europe for nine months. She\u2019ll now be heading to Canada, then Mexico, and then in December Greta will head to Chile for the UN climate conference. That\u2019s a lot of traveling.\n\nSo how does Greta get around to all her speaking engagements on behalf of the planet?\n\nYou might be surprised to learn that Greta didn\u2019t come to the US by air. No, Greta came by boat. And not just any boat\u2014we\u2019re talking about a zero-emissions sailboat called the Malizia II, which took her weeks. Malizia II has solar panels and underwater turbines that generate electricity onboard. Experts say that the Malizia II offers the lowest-carbon way to cross the Atlantic. Fantastic!\n\nThat\u2019s the picture that Greta supporters would like you to focus on. But there\u2019s another side to this eco-friendly journey: Two crewmembers had to fly across the Atlantic to New York to bring the boat back, and two of the crewmembers that made the original voyage had to fly across the Atlantic from the US to return home. That\u2019s four flights to keep Greta from making two. We won\u2019t even mention the train trip Greta took to get to Plymouth, England, in order to set sail, nor will we mention the numerous freeze-dried meals, which we assume are encased in some single-use plastic product, which by our estimations, the two-man crew, Greta, her father, and some cameraman documenting the experience equated to over 200 meals. We also won\u2019t talk about how Greta will return home, since the boat has since returned to Europe.\n\nIn a nutshell, the 5,337-kilometer flight times four people generated 2,134,800 grams of C02 by our calculations, just for the flights alone.\n\n\u201cWe added the trip to New York City at very short notice, and as a result two people will need to fly over to the US in order to bring the boat back,\u201d a Team Malizia spokeswoman told the Times, adding that \u201cThe world has not yet found a way to make it possible to cross an ocean without a carbon footprint.\u201d\n\nRelated: $300 Oil: What If The Attacks In Saudi Arabia Had Destroyed Production?\n\nAin\u2019t that the truth. Which is why people fly instead of bumming a ride on the only zero-emissions racing yacht in the world when they want to cross the ocean. Even if that opportunity was available to everyone, the cost would be \u201castronomical\u201d according to a University of London lecturer. While this fact should not stop the world from finding new ways to travel, perhaps the flight-shaming can be toned down a bit.\n\nGranted, Greta\u2019s showy sea voyage, while generating C02 through the flights of the very people who sailed her to New York, is having an effect in spurring people to abandon or at least reduce the number of miles they choose to travel by air. In the end, we suspect that the four flights generated by her trip to the US have been more than offset by shamed people who have since forgone flying. Some may still see this as an act of hypocrisy, but the resulting math still comes out ahead in favor of reduced C02 generation.", "description": "Greta Thunberg has captured the attention of the world with her climate change rhetoric, but is she practicing what she\u2019s preaching?", "authors": ["Julianne Geiger"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/170rsXUpa1mBMWkZmis49w--~B/aD00NTA7dz00MDc7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/oilprice.com/ae365100a0c1d6090564aee713bcb705", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
