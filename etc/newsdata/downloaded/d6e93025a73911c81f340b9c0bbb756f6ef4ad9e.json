It was Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar. The attacker failed to get past the perimeter gate of the synagogue, and then allegedly shot and killed a passerby before driving off while apologizing for his incompetence to his livestream audience: \u201cSorry guys \u2026 like the loser I am \u2026 One time loser, always a loser.\u201d He continued to a nearby kebab shop where he killed one person before making an escape. Police later arrested him following a car chase.\n\nWhat at first sight may appear as an isolated attack in an obscure German city is anything but. The manifesto the attacker posted online \u2014 as well as his comments during the livestream \u2014 make clear that this is just the latest in a series of interconnected far-right terrorist attacks that have taken place across the world. It follows on from attacks in Pittsburgh (United States), Christchurch (New Zealand), Poway (United States), El Paso (United States) and B\u00e6rum (Norway), attacks that have killed 85 people in total over the last year. All of them speak to the same audience of white nationalists online, hoping to inspire them to commit their own acts of violence.\n\nOf those, the March 2019 Christchurch massacre in New Zealand \u2014 which left 51 worshippers dead in two mosques \u2014 has proven to be most influential. Wednesday\u2019s attack in Germany featured many of the same hallmarks: the use of a livestream, the stated aim of a mass-casualty attack with \u201chigh score\u201d kill counts, the posting of an online manifesto, the use of meme music and the language of relatively obscure internet image boards.\n\nBeyond the similar modus operandi, the Halle shooter also invoked the unifying grand narrative of white-nationalist terrorism today: the \u201cwhite genocide\u201d conspiracy theory. This is the idea that a Jewish conspiracy is orchestrating the mass immigration of non-whites into Europe and North America with the ultimate aim of destroying the white population. Euphemistically labeled \u201cthe great replacement,\u201d this was cited as motivation by the Christchurch, Poway, and El Paso shooters. And the Halle attacker explicitly referred to this in his live stream, blaming Jews for feminism, declining birth rates, and mass immigration, as well as denying the Holocaust.\n\nThere are, however, differences. While the Christchurch shooter wanted to kill as many Muslims as possible, he also had secondary and tertiary aims: for New Zealand and the United States to ban guns (the reaction), causing people to rise up (the counter-reaction). He said he hoped to have \u201caccelerated\u201d that process. New Zealand did ban assault rifles following the Christchurch massacre, though there was no popular uprising as Tarrant anticipated. The Halle attacker, meanwhile, had no such secondary or tertiary aims. His manifesto makes no mention of possible government reactions or counter-reactions. Instead, he only hoped to inspire more mass-casualty attacks by white nationalists on Jews, Muslims, and other \u201cenemies.\u201d\n\nThe Halle attacker had constructed an arsenal of improvised weapons, including a submachine gun and hand grenades. In his manifesto he explicitly states he wanted to prove the viability of such improvised weapons, and therefore inspire others to do the same. Yet much to his frustration, his firearms jammed throughout the attack, giving several people a chance to escape. Had his weapons proved more reliable, and had he managed to enter the synagogue, the attack would have been deadlier. His failure to do so has already become the subject of ridicule among white nationalists online.\n\nThe trend of livestreaming attacks leads to difficult questions for tech companies, particularly over whether more can be done to stop them. The Christchurch shooter used Facebook Live, while Wednesday\u2019s attack was streamed on the gaming-platform Twitch. For its part, Twitch said that it had shared the video\u2019s hash with the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism, a partnership of leading tech companies formed in 2017 that uses hashing technology to automate content takedown. While the audience for these livestreams is relatively small \u2014 the Halle attacker\u2019s stream was only viewed live by a handful of people \u2014 members of an online subculture quickly downloaded and shared this content on more obscure platforms. Tackling those may prove more difficult.", "description": "The attack in Halle, Germany may seem isolated, but it fits into a broader pattern of far-right white nationalist violence around the world.", "authors": ["Rajan Basra"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/fE1tRPx0C74LCE3muL31GA--~B/aD02NDM7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/c7ca26a54bec32b38d72b5ca89e33f22", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
