According to Dow Jones market data, the average decline of the Dow Jones Industrial Average in September is 1%, while the Nasdaq Composite generally sees an average fall of 0.5%.\n\n\u201cAugust was a burst of volatility for most investors, and we expect that to continue in September,\u201d LPL Financial senior market strategist Ryan Detrick said in an analyst note on Friday.\n\nMarkets enter the month expecting a second rate cut by the Federal Reserve but weighed down by uncertainties surrounding the U.S.-China trade war, as well as fears that slowing global growth could spill over into the U.S.\n\nAugust, the worst month for the major indexes since May, was already tumultuous for investors.\n\nThe volatility began Aug. 1, when President Trump announced his administration intended to impose a 10% tariff on $300 billion worth of Chinese goods, the latest escalation in the year-long trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies. Amid the heightened tensions, both countries continued to hit back at each other with tariffs over the course of the month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe two sides are still discussing whether to proceed with talks previously scheduled for September, but any positive developments in the trade war could provide a boon to the markets.\n\nThe September effect, however, is largely an anomaly \u2014 there\u2019s no specific reason that stocks perform poorly in this month.\n\nIt might not be an entirely dark outlook for investors, either. September\u2019s track has been moderately better lately, with the S&P averaging a 0.9% gain over the past 10 years. Plus, the past 15 times that stocks ended lower in August, the rest of the year was higher every time, Detrick said in the note.\n\n\u201cNonetheless, we continue to expect volatility to continue, especially since more defensive areas of the market are leading right now,\u201d the note said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Markets enter the month expecting a second rate cut by the Federal Reserve but weighed down by uncertainties surrounding the U.S.-China trade war.", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/08/0/0/Wall-Street-generic.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
