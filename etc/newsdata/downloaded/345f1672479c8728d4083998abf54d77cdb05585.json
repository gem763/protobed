China is India\u2019s second-largest trading partner with current two-way trade of $87 billion, and the two sides have targeted $100 billion in trade by 2020.\n\nIndia is under increasing pressure to decide whether it will be a part of the RCEP -- which aims to create the world\u2019s largest trading bloc -- as China seeks to conclude the negotiations by November. India\u2019s primary concern is the pact may lead to an influx of cheap Chinese goods, which could further widen New Delhi\u2019s nearly $55 billion trade deficit with Beijing.\n\nXi and Modi discussed how best to identify opportunities to enhance investment in each other\u2019s country and how to increase trade, Gokhale said in an earlier briefing that followed their talks on Friday, noting the pair also discussed the issue of trade deficits and agreed to work together to ensure terrorism and radicalization don\u2019t affect their nations.\n\nThe summit comes as China navigates a trade war with the U.S. and months-long protests in Hong Kong, while India is trying to revive an economy that\u2019s seeing the slowest expansion in six years. New Delhi has also expressed annoyance over China\u2019s support of neighbor and rival Pakistan regarding India\u2019s decision to revoke the special autonomous status of Kashmir, a region both Islamabad and New Delhi claim.\n\n(Updates with details from third paragraph)\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Bibhudatta Pradhan in New Delhi at bpradhan@bloomberg.net;Archana Chaudhary in New Delhi at achaudhary2@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Ruth Pollard at rpollard2@bloomberg.net\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreed to set up a new mechanism to discuss trade at their informal talks in southern India.India raised its concerns about the China-led Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, Indian foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale", "authors": ["Bibhudatta Pradhan", "Archana Chaudhary"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
