On Monday, he called any suggestion of cooperation with the impeachment investigation \u201cfake news\u201d and appended the hashtag \u201c#shamprocess.\u201d\n\nHe cited a White House letter on Oct. 8 declaring that officials would refuse to participate in the impeachment process.\n\nVought has also retweeted Republican criticisms of the investigation.\n\nBrechbuhl, a close ally of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, is one of the few State Department officials eyed by the House who has not appeared voluntarily or relied on a subpoena to evade the Trump administration\u2019s blockade.\n\nBrechbuhl\u2019s attorney, Ron Tenpas, was not immediately available for comment. An auto reply from his email account indicated he would be traveling outside the country with limited access to email until Oct. 29. Democrats are demanding Brechbuhl appear for a deposition on Nov. 6.\n\nDemocrats have demanded Duffey appear on Nov. 5 and Vought to appear on Nov. 6, the same day as Brechbuhl.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/86/39/05ee99804710882134d0fbf79578/191025-russ-vought-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
