This could, at the very least, be partially true. But also true? Hosting is a thankless job and there are fewer and fewer reasons for comedians and stars of note to make the commitment. And those who'd be willing to take the job aren't the sort of marketable names networks aim to recruit for the gig.\n\nWho is presenting?\n\nThe list of those expected to appear includes Jon Hamm, Regina King, Hugh Laurie, Lin-Manuel Miranda and Kerry Washington, to name a few.\n\nMoreover, Adam Devine is expected to present a musical tribute to variety programming.\n\nHalsey is also set to take the stage for a performance to accompany the In Memoriam tribute.\n\nWho's nominated and who will win?\n\nIn the drama race, it's the Seven Kingdoms versus spies as \"Game of Thrones\" and \"Killing Eve\" spar, with the odds on the former to claim the top prize. They are joined in the category by \"Succession,\" \"Better Call Saul,\" \"Ozark,\" \"Bodyguard,\" \"Pose,\" and \"This is Us.\"\n\nIn comedy, eyes are on \"Veep\" to close out its run with one more win, unless \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\" the buzzy \"Fleabag,\" or \"Barry\" swoop in. \"The Good Place,\" \"Russian Doll,\" and \"Schitt's Creek\" are also nominated.\n\nMore on the nominees and who might win here\n\nHow do I watch?\n\nThe 71st Emmy Awards will air live across on Fox starting at 8 p.m. ET. (You can search for your local station here .)\n\nThe show, taking place at the Microsoft Theater at LA Live in downtown Los Angeles, is expected to run three hours.\n\nThe official network pre-show begins at 6:30 p.m. ET and red carpet arrivals begin at 7 p.m. ET.\n\nE! will also be doing its thing starting at 4:30 p.m. ET, with its Countdown to the Red Carpet, and the parade of fancy people starting at 6 p.m. ET.", "description": "It's almost time for the Emmy Awards.", "authors": ["Sandra Gonzalez"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190919110156-20190919-emmys-tv-nomination-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
