It comes amid a crisis prompted by the Trump administration\u2019s withdrawal last year from the Iranian nuclear deal forged by his predecessor and the launch of a campaign of maximum pressure against Iran.\n\nMr Trump has vowed to punish any country or entity which buys oil from Iran, crippling the country\u2019s economy. Iran has described the US policy as \u201ceconomic terrorism\u201d and vowed to retaliate.\n\nYemen\u2019s Houthi rebels, which are closely allied with Iran and battling the Saudis for control of their country, have claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it was launched with drones and the assistance of friendly forces inside the kingdom.\n\nBut Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has cast doubt on that claim, and unnamed US officials have told Washington journalists that they suspected the attacks were launched from either Iraq or Iran using both drones and missiles.\n\n\"There's no doubt that Iran is responsible for this,\u201d one US official was quoted as saying by Reuters. \u201cNo matter how you slice it, there's no escaping it. There's no other candidate. Evidence points in no other direction than that Iran was responsible for this.\u201d\n\nABC News cited an unnamed US official as saying that Iran launched nearly a dozen cruise missiles and over 20 drones from its own territory in the attack, but provided no evidence substantiating the claim.\n\nLate on Sunday, US vice president president Mike Pence and Defence Secretary Mike Esper were seen leaving the White House after a meeting with Mr Trump about the attack on Saudi facilities, prompting speculation that the military officials were drawing up targets. The US came close to attacking Iran in June, after Iranian forces downed an expensive American drone, but backed off at the last moment.\n\nSaudi Arabia is one of the world's biggest oil producers (Statista) More\n\nSaturday\u2019s attack on the oil facility operated by Saudi Aramco was unprecedented in its accuracy and scale. Satellite photos released by the US showed meticulously punctured oil infrastructure at the Aramco site in eastern Saudi Arabia. Independent analysts have said the attack exceeds the range and capabilities of the Houthi rebels.\n\nBut Iran has strenuously denied it was behind the attack.\n\n\"Iran has explicitly declared its support for Yemeni people and their rights, but accusing Iran of such measures is in line with maximum deceit, and is totally baseless,\" foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said on Monday.\n\nWhether Iran or the Iranian-allied Houthis were behind the attack, the timing puts pressure on the US to either defend its staunch ally and risk a major confrontation with an unpredictable adversary, or refrain and risk looking weak, fraying trust in Washington by longtime partners.\n\nStory continues", "description": "The Middle East moved closer towards a broad armed conflict on Monday following US accusations that Iran was behind a sophisticated multi-faceted attack on major Saudi oil facilities at the weekend.President Donald Trump warned in a tweet late on Sunday that the US was \u201clocked and loaded\u201d in response", "authors": ["Borzou Daragahi"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ZOCeM79pbkg3a7KIWsTr5Q--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/908c614c886fbb4a4a8ff5c38ed44915", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
