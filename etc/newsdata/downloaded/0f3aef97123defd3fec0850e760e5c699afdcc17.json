We will decide cases according to the Constitution and our laws, without fear or favor,\" he said.\n\nCindy Ord/Getty Images for The Temple Emanu-El Streicker Center\n\nRoberts said much of the criticism directed at the court stems from a \"misperception\" about a clear partisan divide among the justices. \"We don\u2019t go about our work in a political manner,\" he insisted.\n\nOf the 19 decisions last term decided by a 5-4 vote, just seven were decided by the majority of justices appointed by Republican presidents, Roberts noted.\n\n\"The point is: When you live in a politically polarized environment, people tend to see everything in those terms,\" Roberts said. \"That\u2019s not how we at the court function, and the results of our cases do not suggest otherwise.\"\n\nRoberts addressed a near-capacity crowd of several thousand ticketed guests. The conversation was moderated by Lipson, a longtime Roberts family friend.\n\nThe chief justice will officially open his 15th term leading the Court on Oct. 7, when the justices convene to begin hearing oral arguments on a docket of hot-button cases involving gay rights, immigration and guns.", "description": "As a partisan battle over impeachment grips Washington, Chief Justice John Roberts, in a rare public appearance, defended the independence of the U.S. Supreme Court.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/john-roberts-nyc-mo_hpMain_20190924-214341_16x9_992.jpg"}
