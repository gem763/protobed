There is no lack of beautiful words. But when it comes to our actual emissions and our ecological footprints per capita... then it's a whole other story,' Thunberg said.\n\nGreta Thunberg speaking at the start of the 2019 Climate Action Summit in September at the UN headquaters in New York where she lambasted world leaders over inaction on climate change\n\nThunberg posted about the rejection of the Nordic Council's award on Instagram, in which she criticised her home country's response to climate change\n\nShe went on to criticise Nordic nations' record on cutting harmful emissions.\n\nShe wrote: 'In Sweden we live as if we had about 4 planets according to WWF and Global Footprint Network. And roughly the same goes for the entire Nordic region.\n\n'In Norway for instance, the government recently gave a record number of permits to look for new oil and gas.\n\n'We belong to the countries that have the possibility to do the most. And yet our countries still basically do nothing.\n\n'So until you start to act in accordance with what the science says is needed to limit the global temperature rise below 1.5 degrees or even 2 degrees celsius, I - and Fridays For Future in Sweden - choose not to accept the Nordic Councils environmental award nor the prize money.'\n\nThunberg can be seen (centre) marching during a climate rally in Vancouver last Friday\n\nStill only 16 years old, Thunberg rose to prominence after she started spending her Fridays outside Sweden's parliament in August 2018, holding a sign reading 'School strike for climate'.\n\nThunberg was in Vancouver, British Columbia, last Friday, taking part in climate protests, the same day as London's Natural History Museum said that it had named a minute species of beetle after her.\n\nLast week she also slammed Facebook for not curbing 'constant lies and conspiracy theories' after being targeted by 'death threats and ultimately violence'.\n\nIn a post on the social media platform she questioned whether she should continue to use Facebook.\n\nThe campaigner's book, No One Is Too Small To Make A Difference, which is a collection of her speeches, is up for the book of the year prize, up against Margaret Atwood's The Testaments.", "description": "Teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, who is currently touring California, was honoured by the Nordic Council in her absence at a ceremony in Stockholm.
