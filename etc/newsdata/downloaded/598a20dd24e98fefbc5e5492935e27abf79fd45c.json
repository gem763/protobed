This week, that intervention has taken the form of ominous letters by Democratic members of the powerful U.S. Senate Banking Committee, who warn payment service companies to \u201cexpect a high level of scrutiny\u201d if they take on the risks of Libra.\n\nIt was additionally announced on Thursday that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg will be the sole witness at a hearing before the U.S. House Financial Services Committee later this month.\n\nThese moves come amid reports about waning support among companies that committed funding to join the Libra Association, the Geneva-based nonprofit overseeing the project, and Facebook\u2019s own failure to assuage concerns over the stability of the global financial system.\n\nIn the letters, Sen. Sherrod Brown, the ranking Democratic member of the Senate Banking Committee, and Sen. Brian Schatz, another Democratic member, urge the CEOs of Visa, MasterCard, and Stripe \u2014 all of which are Libra Association member organisations \u2014 to proceed with caution.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned because key questions remain unanswered about the risks the project poses to consumers, regulated financial institutions, and the global financial system,\u201d the letters say. \u201cWe urge you to carefully consider how your companies will manage these risks before proceeding, given that Facebook has not yet demonstrated to [U.S.] Congress, financial regulators \u2014 and perhaps even your own companies \u2014 that it is taking these risk seriously.\u201d\n\nThe letters go on to state that Facebook has failed to address how it will prevent its new digital currency from being used to finance crime and terrorism, or how it will protect consumers from risks currently faced exclusively by accredited investors.\n\n\u201cFacebook is currently struggling to tackle massive issues, such as privacy violations, disinformation, election interference, discrimination, and fraud, and it has not demonstrated an ability to bring those failures under control,\u201d they say.\n\nThe letters also warn the financial companies that Facebook\u2019s troubles could soon become their own: \u201cYou should be concerned that any weakness in Facebook\u2019s risk management systems will become weaknesses in your systems that you may not be able to effectively mitigate.\u201d\n\nFacebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Zuckerberg previously said Libra will not move forward without the blessing of financial regulators.\n\nLast week, PayPal, one of Libra Association\u2019s original 28 founding member organisations, announced it was dropping its support. \u201cPayPal has made the decision to forgo further participation in the Libra Association at this time,\u201d the company told Gizmodo, adding that it \u201cremains supportive of Libra\u2019s aspirations.\u201d\n\nThe news came shortly after David Marcus, who is leading the project at Facebook, told reporters that he had \u201cno knowledge\u201d of any specific organisation\u2019s plans not to participate.\n\nEarlier this year, U.S. House Democrats circulated legislation aimed at halting Facebook\u2019s plans, citing concerns over the use of cryptocurrencies to skirt anti-money laundering rules. The bill, known as the \u201cKeep Big Tech Out of Finance Act,\u201d would prohibit any U.S. tech company with an annual revenue of over $37 billion from issuing digital currencies. The legislation is expected to be a topic at the House hearing where Zuckerberg will testify.\n\nAt a press conference in July, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin called cryptocurrencies, including Libra, a matter of \u201cnational security,\u201d and pointed to the use of Bitcoin and other digital currencies in a litany of criminal behaviour, including \u201ccybercrime, tax evasion, extortion, ransomware, illicit drugs, and human trafficking.\u201d", "description": "As anxieties mount over Facebook\u2019s plan to launch a cryptocurrency called Libra, Capitol Hill lawmakers are facing increasing pressure to intercede.
