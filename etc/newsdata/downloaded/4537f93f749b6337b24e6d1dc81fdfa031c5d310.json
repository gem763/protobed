Jackson is not the first celebrity to feature on Alexa, but previous celebrity voice features have relied upon pre-recorded audio.\n\nSchoolchildren in China work overnight to produce Amazon Alexa devices Read more\n\nJackson\u2019s delivery of expletive-laden one-liners in films such as Pulp Fiction, Shaft, A Time To Kill, Die Hard With A Vengeance, the Star Wars prequels and The Avengers, have entered cultural canon. In some cases \u2013 such as his plea to \u201cget these motherfucking snakes off this motherfucking plane\u201d in the 2006 B-grade romp Snakes on a Plane \u2013 his lines have become synonymous with the films themselves.\n\nJackson has said in the past that he is asked by fans weekly to reproduce his famous performance in Pulp Fiction, in which he recites biblical passage Ezekiel 25:17.\n\nThe Alexa feature promises to make liberal use of Jackson\u2019s reputation for colourful language, but users will have the capacity to turn swearing on and off.\n\nAmazon suggested on Wednesday that more celebrity voices will be added in 2020.\n\nThe feature was one of a number of updates to Alexa announced at Amazon\u2019s annual hardware exhibition in Seattle on Wednesday.\n\nOther updates included new privacy options such as auto-deletion of voice recordings, and new commands that force the program to reveal the data it has collected.\n\nThe privacy features come in the wake of concerns about the company\u2019s retention and treatment of users\u2019 data, and the ability of its devices to record conversations.\n\nA suite of new gadgets was also unveiled on Wednesday, extending the company\u2019s reach into its customers\u2019 homes and lifestyles, including earbuds, glasses, a pet tracker and a smart oven.", "description": "Hollywood star is the first celebrity voice to be rolled out on the virtual personal assistant", "authors": ["Guardian Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a9b9a196f807e9b1afa13ecc726a4be4a84ad5d/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=85b319699e2f8ba53a787f6040843103", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
