According to the news website, the letter said US military spending at Prestwick, the closest airport to the resort, appeared to have \u201cincreased substantially since the election\u201d.\n\nIt follows reports of the airport offering \u201ccut-price rooms for select passengers and crew\u201d, along with free rounds of golf at Turnberry for US military staff and civilian air crews.\n\nThe committee is demanding to see all the financial documents from the US Department of Defense relating to Trump Turnberry, in addition to details of all communications between the two parties. However, reports from the US suggest there has not yet been any response.\n\n\u201cTwo years before the 2016 election, President Trump spent hundreds of millions of dollars to purchase and renovate the Turnberry golf course in Scotland,\u201d said the letter, which was also signed by the Republican congressman Jamie Raskin. \u201cTo date, the property has continued to suffer financial losses and has not turned a profit for the president of his companies.\n\n\u201cThe airport closest to the Trump Turnberry golf course - Glasgow Prestwick airport - has been viewed as integral to the golf course\u2019s financial success, yet it too has lost millions of dollars every year since its purchase by the Scottish government in 2013.\u201d\n\nIt cited Defence Logistics Agency records showing 629 fuel purchase orders worth $11m since October 2017. \u201cGiven the president\u2019s continued financial stake in his Scotland golf courses, these reports raise questions about the president\u2019s potential receipt of US or foreign government emoluments in violation of the US constitution and raise other serious conflict of interest concerns.\n\n\u201cIn order to fulfil its responsibilities under the constitution, the committee is seeking information related to expenditures at both Prestwick airport and the president\u2019s nearby Scotland golf resorts.\u201d\n\nCNN reported that a Democratic committee aide said the defense department had not cooperated with the investigation or produced any of the requested documents.\n\nBoth Trump Turnberry and the airport have operated at significant losses in recent years, with the Scottish government putting Prestwick up for sale after taking it into public ownership in 2013.", "description": "Conflict of interest concerns over military spending at Prestwick airport and discount offers at president\u2019s resort", "authors": ["Mattha Busby"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03d93c32946de6357953147ea173e3643dae0d94/0_268_4040_2425/master/4040.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e1def478e0913ed9ebe07664f2ffab90", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
