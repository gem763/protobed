For both teams, their exuberance on and off the field has been propelled by the joy often seen in Latin baseball culture. USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Every year, it seems, some little-known player unexpectedly grabs the October spotlight by turning in the performance of his life.\n\nIn Game 4 of the 2019 World Series, that player was Jose Urquidy of the Houston Astros.\n\nThe rookie right-hander \u2013 with a total of 41 major league innings under his belt \u2013 held the Washington Nationals to just two hits in five shutout innings Saturday night as the Astros evened the series with a 8-1 victory and ensured the two teams will return to Houston next week.\n\nDormant during the first two games of the series, the Houston offense struck early against Nationals starter Patrick Corbin, who had been brilliant (8-2, 2.40 ERA) at home during the regular season.\n\nFour consecutive singles \u2013 by Jose Altuve, Michael Brantley, Alex Bregman and Yuli Gurriel \u2013 produced two runs and forced Corbin to throw a total of 26 pitches in the first inning.\n\nCatcher Robinson Chirinos padded the Astros\u2019 lead with a two-run homer off Corbin in the fourth, making him the first player in this World Series to hit multiple homers \u2013 and the first catcher to go deep in consecutive World Series games since Ted Simmons of the Milwaukee Brewers in 1982.\n\nAfter the Nationals got a run back in the bottom of the sixth to cut the margin to 4-1, Alex Bregman broke the game open with a grand slam off Fernando Rodney in the top of the seventh to put the Astros on cruise control with an 8-1 lead.\n\nAlex Bregman grand slam pic.twitter.com/g6uYItkGaC \u2014 USA TODAY MLB (@usatodaymlb) October 27, 2019\n\nMan of the moment\n\nThe Nationals seemed to have a distinct advantage in Game 4, sending $140 million free-agent signee Patrick Corbin to the mound against rookie Jose Urquidy and the Astros bullpen.\n\nBut the 24-year-old right-hander from Mexico had other ideas. Urquidy, who posted a 4.46 ERA in the minors this year, held the Nationals scoreless for the first five innings while his teammates roughed up the veteran Corbin.\n\n\u201cI would love for Urquidy to go five, six innings, whatever he can do. And maybe we don't have to use as many pitchers,\u201d Astros manager A.J. Hinch said before the game. \u201cI don't even know if I want to call this a bullpen game because Urquidy is a starter.\u201d\n\nLike a seasoned veteran, Urquidy repeatedly got ahead of the Nats hitters and turned an expected negative into a positive. He yielded just two hits and no walks in his five innings of work\n\nHe threw a total of 67 pitches, 45 of them for strikes, and left with a 4-0 lead.\n\nJose Urquidy pitched five scoreless innings.

But with Urquidy out of the game in the sixth, they mounted an immediate rally against Astros reliever Josh James in a bid to cut into Houston\u2019s 4-0 lead.\n\nPinch-hitter Gerardo Parra drew a leadoff walk. After Trea Turner struck out, Adam Eaton also coaxed a free pass to chase James. An infield single by Anthony Rendon off Will Harris loaded the bases and brought Juan Soto to the plate as the tying run.\n\nSwinging at the first pitch, Soto tapped the ball toward first baseman Yuli Gurriel, who stepped on the bag himself. Although Parra scored the Nationals\u2019 first run on the play, the big inning never materialized when Harris struck out Howie Kendrick for the third out.\n\nNeeding a mulligan\n\nThe Nationals\u2019 woes with runners in scoring position continued for a second consecutive game.\n\nAfter going 0-for-10 with runners in scoring position in Game 3, the Nats were 1-for-9 in Game 4. The only hit was Rendon\u2019s infield single in the sixth, which didn't score a run.\n\nState of the Series\n\nWith a win in Game 4, the Astros not only continued the streak of the visiting team coming out on top in every game of this World Series, but also made sure they will play at least once more at home in Houston.\n\nBut first, there\u2019s another game to play in Washington on Sunday \u2013 a rematch of Game 1 and a battle of aces: Gerrit Cole for the Astros and Max Scherzer for the Nationals.\n\nScherzer had the upper hand in the series opener, allowing two earned runs in five innings as the Nationals handed Cole (5 ER in 7 IP) his first loss since May.\n\n\u201cI still feel that I could execute better and give their hitters just a little bit different look even though they did get to see me pitch against them and what it looks like,\u201d Scherzer said before Game 4. \u201cNo matter what, it's always going to be a battle.\u201d", "description": "The Astros won their second game in a row in Washington to even the World Series and guarantee that the Fall Classic will head back to Houston.", "authors": ["Steve Gardner", "Published P.M.
