Olson lost his job over it. The thing was, Olson\u2019s post was actually mocking anti-Semites like Paul Nehlen. Anyone who isn\u2019t a thoroughly dishonest hack could see that, so, naturally, Penn (with Bloomberg\u2019s blessing) pressed on. Many people accused Penn of carrying out a politically motivated hit job on Olson \u2014 and based on lawyer and Olson\u2019s friend Ted Frank\u2019s findings, those people would appear to have been correct:\n\n\ud83d\udd25 \ud83d\udd25 \ud83d\udd25@blaw refused to answer my questions about their abusive journalism fail on the Leif Olson story, so we FOIA\u2019ed Penn\u2019s emails to DOL to see how it happened. As you can see, this was a total hit job, @benjaminPenn truncated & mischaracterized the Facebook posts. pic.twitter.com/CzTsMKWUBN \u2014 tedfrank (@tedfrank) October 3, 2019\n\nFrom my September 3 thread, here\u2019s the original Facebook post, plainly meant to be sarcastic. https://t.co/TUItsf2j8d \u2014 tedfrank (@tedfrank) October 3, 2019\n\nAs I noted September 3, Penn shaded his story by asking innocuous questions from Olson\u2019s friends while allowing opponents to smear his litigation work. https://t.co/xzqZaK2g6O \u2014 tedfrank (@tedfrank) October 3, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s all there in black and white.\n\n.@tedfrank FOIA'd DOL to find the email from @benjaminpenn. @BLaw still has not added any sort of disclaimer on its hitjob about Leif Olson. https://t.co/IPI3SWQ6y8 \u2014 Josh Blackman (@JoshMBlackman) October 3, 2019\n\n.@FrankBednarz compiled a partial list of the factual errors in the story\u2014coincidentally every single one of them makes Olson look worse than reality. It\u2019s 30 days later, and @blaw and @ChrisOpfer still haven\u2019t corrected them. https://t.co/g3kDAUmadD \u2014 tedfrank (@tedfrank) October 3, 2019\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if they continue to stand by Penn in light of this. It would certainly be in line with their brand journalistic integrity.\n\n\"Does the Labor Department find comments that are disparaging to Jews acceptable for a senior appointee?\" Seriously, @blaw, this is not journalism, right? https://t.co/797n2TJt84 \u2014 S D Winkler (@sdwinkler) October 3, 2019\n\nThis looks veeeeeery bad for Bloomberg Law. https://t.co/oHlnjwpn0N \u2014 Seth Mandel (@SethAMandel) October 3, 2019\n\nI had assumed this all came about because of a vague and sloppy email to Labor. Instead looks a lot like a planned hit job indeed. \u2014 Seth Mandel (@SethAMandel) October 3, 2019\n\nPlease explain to me again why @benjaminpenn is still employed as a journalist. The FOIA is damning. https://t.co/xdDyocJxdD \u2014 Esoteric Jeff (@EsotericCD) October 3, 2019\n\nGood work.
