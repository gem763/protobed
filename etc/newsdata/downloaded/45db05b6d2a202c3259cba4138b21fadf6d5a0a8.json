White women are consistently dying at the same rates in Nebraska, Texas and Virginia.\n\nAlthough breast cancer is the most common cancer among women, lung is typically the most deadly form of the disease to them.\n\nIn most states, that remains true, but in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi and South Carolina breast cancer is now the top killer of black women.\n\nLung and breast cancer kill about the same number of black women in Alabama, Massachusetts, New York and Texas, the study authors report.\n\nIn Utah, breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for white women.\n\nThe report authors argue that there are complex factors driving the increases or slowing declines in death rates among certain populations.\n\nThey suggest that, at least in black women, contributing factors may be late-stage diagnoses, type of tumor, obesity and pre-existing conditions.", "description": "Breast cancer death rates have declined by 40% since 1989, but those declines have slowed to 1.3% per year, the American Cancer Society reports - and remain higher among black women.", "authors": ["Natalie Rahhal Deputy Health Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/02/15/19210898-0-image-a-12_1570027994831.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
