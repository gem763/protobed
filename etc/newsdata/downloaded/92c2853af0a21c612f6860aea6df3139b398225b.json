Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and former Vice President Joe Biden at the top in New Hampshire, with 25 percent support, 22 percent, and 24 percent, respectively.\n\nFranklin Pierce University/Boston Herald poll of New Hampshire (Oct 9-13, +/- 4.8 MOE).\n\n\n\n25% Warren\n\n24% Biden\n\n22% Sanders\n\n9% Buttigieg\n\n5% Harris\n\n2% Klobuchar\n\n2% Booker\n\n\n\n[others \u2264 1%]https://t.co/IwCs3c22wr \u2014 wideofthepost (@wideofthepost) October 14, 2019\n\nAdding Obama into the mix, however, changed that. If she hypothetically entered the race she would have 26 percent support of likely Democratic primary voters in the state, while Warren and Biden would have 20 percent support and Sanders, 15 percent.\n\nThe FP/Boston Herald poll also has Bernie down by 8 points, with the top of the field now Warren at 24%, Biden 24%, and Sanders 22%.\n\n\n\nLast but not least, they asked some hypotheticals: pic.twitter.com/kb1z0AUfbk \u2014 Jake Lahut (@JakeLahut) October 14, 2019\n\nAt this point, the poll is nothing but wishful thinking for Obama fans. The former first lady has said there is \u201czero chance\u201d she would run in 2020.\n\n\"There are so many ways to improve this country and build a better world, and I keep doing plenty of them, from working with young people to helping families lead healthier lives.
