It\u2019s owned by Andr\u00e9s Torres and Mauricio Rengifo, the duo behind \u201cDespacito.\u201d I\u2019m sitting in their home studio to talk to them about one of the key techniques they use to make many of their hits: sampling.\n\nSampling started as a way to cut up an existing recording to use bits of that audio in a new way. It\u2019s helped spawn entire genres of music and has been used to make hit records for decades. The catchy melody in Drake\u2019s \u201cHotline Bling\u201d? That\u2019s a Timmy Thomas sample from 1972. Those horns from Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cCrazy In Love\u201d? That\u2019s a Chi-Lites sample, also from the \u201870s. Everyone from The Beastie Boys to Stevie Wonder to Oasis has used samples in their songs, and it\u2019s still a common practice today.\n\nAndr\u00e9s and Mauricio hail from Colombia, and they\u2019ve been making Latin-infused pop hits as a pair since 2015. \u201cWe\u2019ve been obsessed with samples for a long time,\u201d Mauricio tells me as he opens up the Ableton file for \u201cDespacito\u201d and points out all of the samples that go into a single song. Some samples are sounds they\u2019ve purchased online, while others, like the metallic brush of a g\u00fcira, are ones they\u2019ve made themselves. \u201cA lot of percussion that we have used [is from] real people that we recorded,\u201d says Andr\u00e9s.\n\nA sample can be anything from a melody to a snippet of a drum beat, and as professionally recorded sounds become easier to access and software becomes cheaper, they\u2019re increasingly routine as a part of the song-making process for bedroom and Top 40 producers alike. \u201cI can hear something I love in a piece of media, and I can co-opt it and insert myself in that narrative or alter it even,\u201d said musician Mark Ronson in his 2014 TED Talk on sampling. \u201cIn music, we take something that we love and we build on it.\u201d\n\nSometimes, you can clearly hear a sampled work in a new song, but other times, artists chop up samples, process them, or add so many effects that the origin can be unrecognizable. The classic drum break in Lyn Collins\u2019 1972 single \u201cThink About It\u201d has been sampled in over 2,000 songs. It can be heard in an obvious way in Rob Base & DJ E-Z Rock \u201cIt Takes Two,\u201d but it\u2019s also hidden in Jaime XX\u2019s \u201cGosh,\u201d and many wouldn\u2019t know it because of how the sounds have been warped.\n\nThere are a million reasons why someone might use samples in a track. Sometimes it helps hook people in if they hear something recognizable, like how Katy Perry\u2019s \u201cSwish Swish\u201d begins with a classic Fat Boy Slim vocal. Or someone might not have access to an instrument they want to use in a track. Or a producer might simply get captivated by a sound and want to use it as a point of inspiration. Whatever the case, because of the burgeoning sample marketplace industry, musicians can now find almost any sound they need in a matter of seconds.\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s fair. It\u2019s just creativity.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can come in and just browse what\u2019s new, see what\u2019s hot in the charts, or do an exact search for, \u2018I need a flute in the key of B right now,\u2019\u201d says Steve Martocci, CEO of sample marketplace and music collaboration platform Splice. \u201cWhat we watched was it just really evolved the way people think about creation and songwriting.\u201d These marketplaces are becoming so popular, Martocci tells me, that on Splice alone, people listen to over 60 million samples each week.\n\nThe way people have grabbed samples has changed over time. Historically, a sample is audio taken from an existing recording, and the way that is done has evolved with tech. In the \u201840s, musique concr\u00e8te artists modified and spliced recordings of natural sounds to create musical collages. In the \u201860s, Jamaican producers like King Tubby used mixing board techniques \u2014 like feedback loops and flanges \u2014 to remix reggae songs, creating a genre called dub. In the \u201870s, the first commercially available samplers popped up, including the Fairlight CMI (Computer Musical Instrument), which let you edit sampled waveforms with a built-in light pen. Since then, samples have been lifted from vinyl, CDs, YouTube rips, and anywhere else sounds exist.\n\nAnyone can now legally buy some of the exact sounds used in Top 40 songs like \u201cDespacito\u201d\n\nBut sampling this way poses risk because, like most things in life, if you take something without permission, you can get in trouble. And that applies to music, too. While sampling was new and exciting for many years, the pressures to deal with copyright infringement started to appear by the early \u201890s. The line for what is considered stealing in music has never been clear-cut, and it continues to be a hotly debated topic both in and out of court. One of the most famous copyright infringement cases involves Vanilla Ice, who eventually settled for lifting the bass line in Queen and David Bowie\u2019s \u201cUnder Pressure\u201d to use in \u201cIce Ice Baby.\u201d\n\n\u201cBack then, if you really wanted to clear something when you pulled it from a track, it could never get done,\u201d Martocci says. \u201cThe normal process is people would try to extract it from the sound where they heard it and hope no one notices and release their track. And if they\u2019re successful, get sued.\u201d\n\nNow, the term \u201csample\u201d can also mean a new sound created specifically to be a sample. In recent years, there\u2019s been a boom in online sample marketplaces like Splice and Sounds.com \u2014 places where producers can buy and sell recorded sounds that can be legally used in works, royalty-free. These sites court producers to create packs for their sites, like Diplo, WondaGurl, and Andr\u00e9s and Mauricio. Then, users pay a subscription fee (average of $10 a month or less) to get credits that can be exchanged for samples.\n\nAndr\u00e9s and Mauricio have their own sample pack on Splice, with hundreds of sounds including reggaeton drum loops, salsa-inspired horns, and tropical pop-inspired synth plucks. I ask Andr\u00e9s and Mauricio if any sounds from \u201cDespacito\u201d are in their Splice sample pack. There are, along with other sounds they\u2019ve made and used in \u201cRunaway,\u201d their latest hit with Sebasti\u00e1n Yatra, Daddy Yankee, Natti Natasha, and the Jonas Brothers.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty amazing that anyone can now legally buy some of the exact sounds used in Top 40 songs like \u201cDespacito,\u201d and for cheap. \u201cThat\u2019s so fair,\u201d says Andr\u00e9s, \u201cbecause when we were starting, a big producer that had a lot of success will always sound better than a small producer because they had money to buy all these expensive things. Now it\u2019s fair. It\u2019s just creativity. Who is the most creative person that can make the most interesting song? Because everybody can sound good.\u201d\n\nThe pair has already heard some of their samples used by big acts. Billboard-charting boy band Why Don\u2019t We used one of their guitar loops in recently released \u201cCome To Brazil,\u201d which has already racked up millions of streams across various platforms. \u201cWe\u2019re so proud,\u201d says Andr\u00e9s. Mauricio grins and nods in agreement. \u201cWe feel super cool about it.\u201d\n\nSample marketplaces provide instant and legal access to millions of sounds\n\nSample marketplaces are beneficial for musicians on both ends. They provide instant and legal access to millions of sounds, and they have also become a way for more established artists to make money. Producers like Andr\u00e9s and Mauricio get paid an advance to make a sample pack for Splice, and they are paid again when someone downloads one of their sounds.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at this era where software is the primary instrument,\u201d Martocci tells me. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a huge record deal to break or get enough money to go into a studio.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have access to the same things that we have, and everybody can do the same quality of music,\u201d Andr\u00e9s says. \u201cAnd that, for me, is the world evolving and being a better place for art.\u201d\n\nMake sure to check out other episodes of The Future of Music here.", "description": "In the third episode of The Future of Music season 2, Dani Deahl visits the studio of top latin pop producers Mauricio Rengifo and Andr\u00e9s Torres, most famous for their hit Despacito, to see how they make and use samples to create music.", "authors": ["Dani Deahl", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sma39TXIwpMr96knL3CzYuH7eno=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19129154/rmanning_190709_3629_0013.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-03"}
