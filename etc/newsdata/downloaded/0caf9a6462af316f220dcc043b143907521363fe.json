President Trump also likes weaker dollar. A beneficiary of weak dollar will be gold. Many central banks are buying gold for reserve diversification. Consider a small allocation to gold.\n\nDemocratic candidates Warren and Sanders have proposed graduated wealth tax to fund ambitious social programs. In recent years, France, Germany, Sweden, Netherlands, Austria have repealed wealth tax because they weren\u2019t effective; Switzerland, Norway, Spain still have modest levels of wealth tax. A significant amount of wealth is hard to value [private businesses, collectibles].\n\nPg 9, Streetwise: Outlines how to pretend/fake to understand Brexit. [FWIW, I am not impressed by the attempted humor. Those who really want to understand it should check recent posts in the Brexit Developments thread in M* Off-Topic forum.]\n\nPg 12-13: Canadian elections are on Monday. FB CEO Zuckerberg is before House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday. The ECB announces monetary policy on Thursday \u2013 it is the last policy meeting for Draghi; Lagarde takes over on Nov 1.\n\nBernstein Research has published its 10-stock Quant+Fundamental portfolio since 2016 and updated it every 6 months. It has outperformed SP500.\n\nOrthodontics company SmileDirectClub [SDC] IPO was at $23 last month and it is now at $9,46. Dentists, orthodontists, ADA have asked the FTC to investigate false and misleading claims by SDC. CA has passed a bill requiring orthodontists to review recent patient dental x-rays.\n\nData this week: Existing home sales on Tuesday; durable goods, PMI, new home sales, consumer sentiment on Thursday.\n\nBullish Recommendations: E&P ConocoPhillips [COP; yield 3.1% and growing; fwd P/E 14.5; buybacks; E&P segment has sold off sharply (XOP -50% in 1-yr); stake in Canadian CVE; note that refining, chemicals, marketing are in a separate company Phillips 66 (PSX) since 2012; pg 14].\n\nBearish Recommendations: Boeing [BA; stock fell on delayed disclosure of damaging internal documents on anti-stall MCAS to DOT/FAA; 737 Max has been grounded since March and there is no clear timeframe for its service resumption; huge backlog; earnings and the CEO testimony before Congress are ahead; CEO Muilenberg was demoted with his Chairman title taken away; pg11];\n\noptical chain National Vision [EYE; fwd P/E 36; stock has sold off sharply; large short interest; WMT contract expiring in August 2020; stores America\u2019s Best (67% revenue), Eyeglass World , 226 WMT Vision Centers (10% revenue; WMT runs own vision centers in rest of its stores); low/discount prices mean that it uses cheaper lens materials that are not good for stronger prescriptions; KKR took it private in 2014 and the IPO was in late-2017 \u2013 KKR is totally out of it now; pg 15].\n\nPg 17: The most expensive Medigap Plan F is being phased out for new retirees by 2019 yearend; those already in Plan F can continue. It is popular [60% of supplemental plans] because it provides first-dollar-coverage [no deductibles/copays] and has the broadest possible coverage. The closest is Plan G [with Part B deductibles; 27% of supplemental plans]. There are several Medigap Plans, A to N, but not all are available in all states. Switching is possible but may require health assessment, so beware that one may be stuck with the initial Medigap Plan selected.\n\nPg 23: Enterprise tech stocks [IGV, -10% from July high] have cooled down due to worries about slowing global economy and continuing trade war. Enterprise capex is down. At risk are CSCO, IBM, CRM, ADBE. Semis [SOXX, only -2% from high] are at even greater risk but the best-in-class TSM may do fine. On the other hand, cloud-computing stocks remain strong as the shift to the cloud continues.\n\nPg 24: Philippe Bodereau, Preferreds PFANX likes bank preferreds in the US and Europe [AT1s; 40% are investment-grade]; banks have benefitted from post-financial-crisis regulations. Fund uses top-down and bottom-up analyses \u2013 for example, due to mismatches in those outlooks, it has avoided Ireland, Greece, etc. It is overweight in the US, UK, Spain. In the US, it likes preferreds that are issued at fixed rates but convert to floating rates after 5-10 years [from BAC, etc].\n\nPg 26: House-brand/in-house ETFs have many issues: conflicts of interest; large assets from single sponsor; high ERs; poor liquidity. Examples include JHEM, HTRB, FXU, TILT, etc. Schwab low ER ETFs are also mentioned noting that Schwab\u2019s robo-advisor SIP favors them. M* Ben Johnson was among the critics of such ETFs but Barron\u2019s also included FlexShares M* TILT in the problem list.\n\nPg 27: Fed\u2019s recent buying of T-Bills to shore up money market repos isn\u2019t QE4. The Fed is addressing shortage of cash in the system [due to newer banking regulations] and the Fed balance sheet has expanded some. This is just reversing some of the previous QT [-QE]. In future, the Fed may look at both the fed fund rates and the size of its balance sheet. It may also establish a standing facility to provide cash for Treasury securities as the ECB, BOE, BOJ already do.\n\nPg 28: High current-dividend stocks/funds [VYM] have lagged YTD but have rebounded lately. It is mentioned that this rebound may not be sustainable in view of the unresolved trade issues and potential volatility. It is suggested to look beyond high current-dividend stocks/funds by considering growth, momentum, etc.\n\nPg 30: Denise Chisholm, Fidelity sector strategist. She looks for trends and patterns for rates, oil/energy, sectors, economy; her formal background is in statistics. Current global slowdown is actually good for stocks as many governments are stimulating and that should kick in in 6-9 months; real-rates are negative in most places [ignore nominal negative rates in Europe and Japan] and much of the bad news is in the stocks. These will benefit cyclicals [consumer-discretionary, tech, financials, homebuilders, energy]; on the other hand, defensive sectors [consumer-staples, utilities] are expensive and will lag. Yield-curve inversion by itself isn\u2019t a good indicator of recession but be watchful of other shocks; there may also be rolling recessions affecting some sectors. Tariffs so far can be absorbed but more tariffs in a short timeframe may become problematic.\n\nPg 32: Income. Many investors are buying dividend-paying stocks instead of low-yielding bonds. But if the rates fall too much [e.g. 10-yr yield below 1.4%], that would mean investors fear of a recession.\n\nPg 34: Adam Levinson [ Graticule Asset Management ], Sriram Vasudevan [ Graticule Asset Management ], Parag Khanna [ FutureMap ]. Argument is made that the energy production and distribution is no longer concentrated with the OPEC. With fracking, off-shore production, and strategic petroleum reserves, there are now many sources of energy production and distribution in the US, Europe, Latin America. Alternative sources of energy are also growing [nuclear, solar, wind, natural-gas/LNG]. Demand from utilities and consumers is shifting to less polluting and cleaner fuels. These present new opportunities in the energy sector, considered broadly.\n\nExtras from Friday \u2013 I try to guess on Friday which features will make it in the weekend edition but the following guesses didn\u2019t make it. Almost 75-80% of the weekend edition is now available by 9:00 PM Central on Friday. Barron\u2019s revised website has \u201cInterests\u201d tabs similar to columns topics and that makes it easier to find potential items for the weekend edition. This is also the reason for earlier postings on Saturday \u2013 I do wait for my paper delivery [typically between 5:00-6:30 AM Central] to fill in some data.\n\nNone\n\nYBB", "description": "Pg 5, Up & Down Wall Street: The Fed may cut rates on Oct 30; it has also started buying T-Bills that some call mini-QE but the Fed doesn\u2019t like to use - 27220", "authors": ["Contributor"], "top_image": "https://zwcdr85544.i.lithium.com/html/assets/favicon.ico?15D4DC4041FDD3CD56F6121736C9C68D", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
