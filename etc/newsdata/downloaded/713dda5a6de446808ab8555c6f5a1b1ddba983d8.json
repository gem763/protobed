The automaker provided few details to accompany the photo of the plug-in model but said it will be the most powerful RAV4 yet.\n\nIf Toyota is planning to use a version of the Prius Prime's powertrain into the RAV4, we're expecting a pair of electric motors, a gasoline engine that runs on the Atkinson cycle, and an all-electric driving range of around 20 to 25 miles. The RAV4 PHEV may also come standard with all-wheel drive like the regular non\u2013plug-in-hybrid model with an electric motor driving the rear wheels.\n\nThe plug-in hybrid appears to share much of the styling of the regular RAV4, with blocky wheel wells, a squared-off front grille, and a floating roofline. Toyota's preview picture (above) shows the SUV in a new shade called Supersonic Red.\n\nWe'll know more about the future plug-in hybrid, including an estimated on-sale date, when the SUV is officially unveiled on November 20. For plug-in enthusiasts interested in seeing the RAV4 PHEV as soon as the sheet is pulled off, you can watch Toyota's live stream from the show floor.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "Toyota says it will be the most powerful RAV4 to date, and it will make its debut in November at the Los Angeles auto show.", "authors": ["Drew Dorian"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ARjUEw2_i_slf38DR1YdwQ--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/car_and_driver_581/d56482e7d6843b79a9c424808b6c0797", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
