Last week\u2019s announcement of a new iPad Air and iPad mini means that Apple\u2019s tablet lineup includes five different screen sizes, each of which has its own storage or LTE options on top of that. Apple has an iPad at price points that range from $329 for a basic iPad all the way up to (an absurd) $1,899 for a maxed-out 12.9-inch iPad Pro.\n\nIf you\u2019re trying to choose among them, you might think that\u2019s too many iPads, but I think there\u2019s a surprising amount of coherency to the lineup. More importantly, there\u2019s a clear standout best choice for people looking to get more than the basics without spending iPad Pro prices. That choice, if you haven\u2019t guessed, is the new iPad Air.\n\nStarting at $499, the iPad Air brings all of the features that actually matter to most people down to a price point that\u2019s much more reasonable. It\u2019s also just an excellent tablet on its own merits, but you probably could have guessed that on your own.\n\nIt is, after all, an iPad.\n\nThe new iPad Air feels instantly familiar. It has the same basic iPad form factor we\u2019ve been living with for years and years. The screen is surrounded by bezels that look large in 2019 but really aren\u2019t too bad, with a physical Touch ID button on one side and a camera on the other. The back is tapered to the edges, making the whole thing feel thinner, and I really like that there\u2019s no camera bump to speak of.\n\nWhat\u2019s \u201cnew\u201d about the Air is the screen size: 10.5 inches. That\u2019s slightly bigger than the basic iPad, but it\u2019s exactly the same size as the old (and now-discontinued) 10.5-inch iPad Pro from 2017. That means the body is slightly larger than traditional 9.7-inch iPads \u2014 not enough to really feel but just enough to make your old cases incompatible.\n\nThe screen is noticeably better than what you get on the basic iPad\n\nThe screen is great, though. It\u2019s a clear step up from the basic iPad and not just because of the slightly larger size. It\u2019s laminated to the glass, which means that there\u2019s nearly no air gap between where you touch and where the pixels are. It also supports Apple\u2019s True Tone technology, which adjusts the color temperature of the screen to the lighting in the room you\u2019re in. It\u2019s subtle, but it really works, and I really do miss it when I look at another screen.\n\nThe theme of the iPad Air is that it takes the features you actually would have wanted from an iPad Pro and brings them down to a more reasonable price point. That absolutely applies to the screen. The Pro-level iPads have two things this iPad Air lacks: larger, fancy curved-corner screens and Apple\u2019s ProMotion technology for varying the display\u2019s refresh rate to make scrolling ultra smooth. Both of those things are very nice, but neither is the sort of thing I\u2019d tell you to spend hundreds of dollars more to get.\n\nI came to this iPad Air after a couple of years of using that old 10.5-inch iPad Pro, and it\u2019s so similar that I hardly noticed the change. There is one thing that\u2019s disappointing by comparison, though: the speakers. Apple reserves having four speakers (two on each side) for the Pro models, and it was weird to only have sound coming out of the right-hand side while watching movies.\n\nIn fact, if you can find that (now-discontinued) 10.5-inch iPad Pro for a discount (or at the same price), I\u2019d probably recommend that you snap it up instead of this iPad Air. It\u2019s basically the same thing but with a couple extra speakers. (I think the processor difference is a wash.)\n\nReally great performance and battery life\n\nThe iPad Air has the same A12 processor as the latest iPhones, and in use, that means everything felt snappy and fluid, even when multitasking. Battery life has been really great, too. There are cameras. They are definitely fine, but not good or bad enough to worry about. (Your phone cameras are almost surely better.) The iPad\u2019s cameras are perfectly adequate for \u201cscanning\u201d pictures of documents, which is where they make the most sense anyway. You really don\u2019t need me to tell you much more about what the experience and performance is like because it\u2019s great. It\u2019s an iPad.\n\nThat said, I still think iOS 12 doesn\u2019t make the case that it can replace your Mac or Windows laptop, but that conflict isn\u2019t as angsty on the Air as it is on the Pro. At this price, you don\u2019t really have to worry about all of that. We\u2019ll argue about this all over again when iOS 13 comes out, but until then, let the iPad Pro people kvetch about it.\n\nThe other formerly \u201cPro-only\u201d feature you get on the iPad Air is a keyboard connector. I still think it\u2019s dumb that the basic iPad still requires a Bluetooth keyboard, so I\u2019m really glad it\u2019s available here. It uses the old \u201cOrigami\u201d-style Smart Keyboard, which still costs a whopping $159. It\u2019s not backlit, but it\u2019s great to type on (better than a MacBook!), and I love that it allows you to position the iPad in both easel and drawing modes. The new iPad Pros can\u2019t do that, which is nuts.\n\nYou also get support for the Apple Pencil, but it\u2019s the first-gen Pencil with its silly cap, silly charging method, and silly proclivity to roll off any surface you set it on. The Pencil still retails for $99, too. It works well with this iPad, but if you really want a stylus and don\u2019t think you\u2019ll miss the pressure sensitivity, I think the Logitech Crayon might make more sense.\n\nA word about the Lightning connector: I think the vast majority of people who will buy this iPad Air will be very happy that it uses Lightning and not USB-C. They likely will have iPhones or will be upgrading from an older iPad, and so they will have one less new cable to worry about. Lightning is a great plug: it\u2019s small and durable and simple.\n\nI am not in that majority, though. It\u2019s silly to claim that USB-C is a \u201cPro\u201d feature reserved for \u201cPro\u201d iPads. It\u2019s a common plug now on a wide variety of devices from headphones to laptops to every single modern Android phone. I understand why Apple didn\u2019t want to inflict that transition on potential iPad Air customers, but I also would like the entire industry to just get this transition done and over with. Lightning is great, but it would be even better if I could use the same fast-charging cable and brick I use to charge my MacBook to charge this iPad.\n\nSpeaking of ports, the iPad Air has an honest-to-goodness headphone jack. As it should.\n\nBefore this Air, buying an iPad led to a difficult choice. The basic iPad was (and is) very good, but if you wanted to step up and get something with a keyboard connector, the Pro used to start at $649. Now, the Air is a very obvious and very reasonable upsell. At $499, you get almost all of the \u201cPro\u201d features that really matter in day-to-day use.\n\nCompared to the new Pro, these bezels on the Air sure are big, and not having Face ID on an iOS device is starting to feel a little antiquated. But those futuristic hardware features don\u2019t really do that much more for people, and you\u2019ll only miss them if you already have an iPad Pro. The only thing you\u2019re missing out on is having a tablet that feels like it comes from the future. It doesn\u2019t mean the tablet you have today isn\u2019t excellent.\n\nWith the iPad Air, most of the features that most people really want from a Pro machine become available without paying Pro prices. The iPad Air floats in the middle of the iPad lineup, and if you can afford it, you should get it over the basic iPad.\n\nI initially had a lot of questions about what \u201cAir\u201d meant after Apple brought back the moniker for this iPad and the MacBook Air. But after using this iPad, I think I finally get it. This is what Air is supposed to mean now: the best all-around choice for most people.", "description": "With the iPad Air, most of the features that most people really want from a Pro machine become available without paying Pro prices.
