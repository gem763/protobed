Every game at this club should be a win game.\n\n\u201cWe have to raise our game and raise our supporters mood with Liverpool next.\n\n\u201cConfidence is a big thing. Performance and results give you confidence. When there is a decision to make they don't do it instinctively. It effects everyone.\n\n\u201cWe are unhappy with the result. That brings out the mood of everyone. That is down to us starting a rebuild. We are going through a very difficult period.\"", "description": "Manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is desperate for another forward with his side struggling for goals", "authors": ["Alex Milne", "Image", "Francois Lo Presti Afp Getty Images", "Afp Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20527819.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FBL-EUR-C1-LEIPZIG-LYON.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
