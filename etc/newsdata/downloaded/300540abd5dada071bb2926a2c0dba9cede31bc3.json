VanDyke, 41, graduated from Harvard Law School in 2005 and also clerked for federal appellate Judge Janice Rogers Brown.\n\nVanDyke was on the job for less than a year before he gave his notice to Fox in January. He told the AP he had not planned a Supreme Court run when he resigned, nor did he know what his next job would be, but he decided to quit because the work environment had become strained.\n\nBlack has been an attorney for 25 years and with the Department of Justice for the last three years. Fox wrote a recommendation when Black applied for a Supreme Court vacancy earlier this year to replace former Justice Brian Morris, with Fox calling Black an \u201caccomplished litigator with considerable court room experience.\u201d\n\nWhen Black questions VanDyke\u2019s maturity, he said he means his lack of experience. The current Supreme Court justices spent an average of 28 years practicing law before they were elected or appointed to the Supreme Court, according to the justices\u2019 biographies.\n\nBy work ethic, Black said VanDyke didn\u2019t seem interested in gaining the skills and experience to work on the cases assigned to him.\n\nTheir dispute came to a head in a case they were both involved with opposing a lawsuit that sought married benefits for same-sex couples. It is captured in hundreds of pages of emails released by Fox\u2019s office in a public-records request by the Great Falls Tribune.\n\nBlack said one email in particular underscores VanDyke\u2019s lack of experience and concerns him about his Supreme Court candidacy.\n\nThe Jan. 23 email from VanDyke to his bosses at the attorney general\u2019s office, VanDyke said he wanted off the same-sex benefits case in part because he has little experience or expertise in matters such as discovery issues, dealing with experts, stipulations and conferring with opposing counsel.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to be sitting on Montana\u2019s highest court judging what those lawyers do,\u201d Black told the AP. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have experience dealing with that, I think you\u2019ll have a difficult time doing it well.\u201d\n\nAnother email from Black to his bosses accused VanDyke of avoiding work and not having the skills to perform or desire to learn how to perform the work of a lawyer. Attorney general chief of staff Scott Darkenwald told Black in the email chain that \u201cyour frustration does not exceed ours.\u201d\n\nA separate email from Fox to Mattioli says he believed Black was putting his personal grudges against VanDyke above his responsibilities to the office.\n\nDepartment of Justice spokesman John Barnes declined to assess VanDyke\u2019s performance as solicitor general, saying it would not be appropriate \u201cto do or say anything that could be construed as injecting itself in a political race between two candidates for the court.\u201d\n\nVanDyke said Supreme Court justices mainly deal with constitutional questions and reviews of lower decisions that don\u2019t require those skills as a trial lawyer.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got lots of people with lots of trial experience on the court,\u201d VanDyke said. \u201cI think what we need is somebody who actually focuses on the law and the constitution, has some expertise in that.\u201d\n\nLee Newspapers of Montana previously reported that of 6,600 cases to go to the Supreme Court since 2006, there were only 34 notices of constitutional challenges. Supreme Court Clerk Ed Smith confirmed those numbers Wednesday.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://gftrib.com/1wsBG9H", "description": "A former co-worker of Montana Supreme Court candidate Lawrence VanDyke is questioning whether the ex-solicitor general has experience", "authors": ["Published P.M.
