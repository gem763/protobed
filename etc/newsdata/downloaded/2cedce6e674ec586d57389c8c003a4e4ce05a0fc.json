Something that has been catching shoppers\u2019 eyes are the neon lights in spooky shapes.\n\nDon\u2019t skip out on the Dollar Spot section at Target during your next visit, because that\u2019s where you\u2019ll find the pumpkin, bat, witch\u2019s hat, ghost, and candy neon lights. They\u2019re battery-powered and only $5 each. So you can snag a bunch and give your bedroom or living room an eerie glow to accompany your Halloween movie bingeing.\n\nSadly, the neon lights aren\u2019t available on Target\u2019s website, so you\u2019ll just have to head there yourself. But don\u2019t buy anything without signing up for the store\u2019s new loyalty program! You\u2019ll feel better about stocking up on all its fall must-haves.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "It's about to get ~spoOoOky~ up in here.", "authors": ["Caitlyn Fitzpatrick"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/bcwttS52cfKkfRQe0G0XOQ--~B/aD01MDA7dz0xMDAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmopolitan_438/962b3ccea71c5276576a38b79e8d6e42", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
