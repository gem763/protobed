The regulator had sued Kraft Heinz Co. and Mondelez International Inc. over alleged manipulation of the wheat-futures market.\n\nTo settle the CFTC\u2019s allegations, Kraft and Mondelez\u2014which were one corporate entity when the agency announced its civil charges in 2015\u2014had agreed to pay $16 million.\n\nIn a move the CFTC called unprecedented, Judge Blakey in August ordered the three commissioners and a group of CFTC lawyers to appear at a hearing on whether the agency had violated an unusual provision prohibiting parties to the settlement from making certain public comments about the deal.\n\nDespite the prohibition, the CFTC published a press release and two statements a day after the settlement was completed, causing Kraft and Mondelez to ask Judge Blakey to hold the agency in contempt.\n\nFollowing the order, the CFTC filed a series of emergency requests, which were kept under seal, asking Judge Blakey\u2019s court as well as the appeals court to delay or cancel the hearing. The regulator argued there are legal issues around forcing its commissioners\u2014high-ranking executive branch officials\u2014to testify.\n\nThe motions were unsealed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit on Wednesday. The CFTC argued Judge Blakey was acting as an \u201cinquisitor\u201d by attempting to personally investigate Kraft and Mondelez\u2019s claims, adding the judge should be disqualified from conducting a contempt hearing because he had participated in the settlement negotiations.\n\nA lawyer for Kraft and Mondelez didn\u2019t return a request for comment.\n\nThe appeals court last week agreed to hear the CFTC\u2019s request and ordered Judge Blakey to halt proceedings until it reached a decision.\n\nJudge Blakey\u2019s order would cause serious disruptions and divert public resources away from its heavy enforcement workload, the CFTC said in one of the unsealed motions.\n\nExtensive coverage of the settlement would have occurred regardless of the CFTC\u2019s press release and statements, the agency\u2019s lawyers also argued.\n\n\u201c[Media] coverage of the settlement...was inevitably going to be terrible for Kraft,\u201d they said.\n\nOne focus of the legal battle is whether the gag provision in the settlement with Mondelez and Kraft applies to the CFTC\u2019s commissioners.\n\nThe CFTC has argued that it is required to publish additional statements made by a commissioner about an enforcement decision, beyond the commission\u2019s official statement.\n\nAlong with the initial press release about the settlement, the five-member commission had released a statement about the settlement. Its two Democratic commissioners, Rostin Behnam and Dan Berkovitz, also released a separate statement in which they touted the settlement and noted the restriction on public statements.\n\nKraft and Mondelez have disputed the CFTC\u2019s characterization that the commissioners weren\u2019t parties to the settlement, saying it is at odds with the regulator\u2019s process for approving enforcement actions, which require a vote by the commissioners.\n\nRecords unsealed Wednesday revealed that the unusual gag provision was formulated during a confidential hearing in March, when Judge Blakey had acted as a mediator in an effort to help the CFTC and the two companies reach a settlement agreement.\n\nAfter the hearing, CFTC lawyers had approached counsel for Kraft and Mondelez on several occasions to relay a request by its commissioners that the clause be removed. The companies refused, according to the declaration of a lawyer for Kraft and Mondelez.\n\nThe requests showed the commissioners knew they would be subject to the gag provision, Kraft and Mondelez wrote in their brief.\n\n\u201cThe CFTC\u2019s new interpretation is nothing more than an attempt to manufacture an excuse and blur what was unambiguously clear to all sides when the parties\u2019 agreed to the consent order and the court entered it,\u201d they wrote.\n\nWrite to Dylan Tokar at dylan.tokar@wsj.com", "description": "The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has asked an appeals court to block an order requiring three of its commissioners to testify over statements the agency published following a market-manipulation settlement.", "authors": ["Dylan Tokar"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-113042/social", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
