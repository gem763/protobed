I am boycotting them over their Hong Kong censorship | Dylan Curran", "language": "en", "text": "There\u2019s a unifying factor between companies; it brings people of all political ideologies together, unites the left, the right, and everything in-between. Executives and shareholders alike may not agree with one another on abortion, or human rights, or freedom of speech, or social welfare, or pretty much any divisive issue you can imagine, but they can most certainly agree that one thing is more important than all the concerns of the little people: the profit margin.\n\nBlizzard, the creator of massively popular games such as World of Warcraft and Hearthstone, proved exactly that this week. Chung Ng Wai, a Hong Kong-based player who is known by the name Blitzchung, won a game in the Hearthstone Grandmasters tournament and gave an official interview. In the interview, he said \u201cLiberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time,\u201d which is the standard protest slogan in the city. He was also wearing the goggle and face mask combo used to protect Hong Kong protesters\u2019 from facial recognition and tear gas.\n\nBlizzard has a rule against expressing a political opinion that displeases any portion of the public, so this was clearly against the rules. However, rather than empathize with a young man in a struggle for his human rights, they chose to take a leaf out of the Chinese government\u2019s book and respond with full force. They suspended him for a year, took back all his winnings for the year, condemned him on social media, and even fired the two casters who were simply interviewing him. To use the colloquial term, shit hit the fan. Longtime supporters of Blizzard, including myself, were outraged. How could an American company take such a harsh stance against free speech? Not the kind of free speech where you say slurs, either \u2013 literally the most important form: criticizing an authoritarian government.\n\nProfessional gamer Chung \u201cBlitzchung\u201d Ng Wai appeared in an interview after a Hearthstone tournament. Photograph: Blizzard\n\nEmployees staged a walkout, covering up two of the \u201ceight core values\u201d of Blizzard which are engraved outside their HQ \u2013 \u201cthink globally\u201d and \u201cevery voice matters\u201d. US senators have condemned the company\u2019s action, citing China leveraging access to its vast market as a way to reduce free speech globally. The former team lead Mark Kern, who helped spearhead the original World of Warcraft, began accelerating a scattered boycott by cancelling his subscriptions. He tweeted an emotional thread. He is ethnically Chinese and lived in Hong Kong for a time. He spoke of the corruption of Chinese gaming companies, claiming that they offer bribes for big budget titles and saying they tried to ruin his career with planted press stories because he refused kickbacks. \u201cChinese money now dictates American values,\u201d he said, and I have to agree with him.\n\nIn China, every movie, game, app or book has to go through the General Administration of Press and Publication in order to be released to the public. it has strict censorship protocols, in which nothing negative can be said about China, past horrors committed by the government can\u2019t be mentioned, and the publication cannot offend the culture of China. This means a big no-no on blood and gore, which means games censor bones, blood and guts. Blizzard actually does this, releasing censored versions of their games in China.\n\nAmerican companies comply with these ridiculous rules to get access to the colossal Chinese market. The NBA is experiencing this right now: the manager of the Houston Rockets simply stated his support for Hong Kong, and China blacklisted the Rockets from being shown on Chinese television. The country can cut your access at any time, for pretty much any reason they deem appropriate. Such as \u2026 a player of your game expressing support for a rebelling territory.\n\n'Chinese money now dictates American values,' Mark Kern said, and I have to agree with him\n\nI can understand from a business perspective why Blizzard would cave, and undoubtedly the Chinese government explicitly asked it to heavily punish everyone involved. Blizzard gets up to 12% of its revenue from Asia, and presumably a huge portion of that is from China. Losing that much of your revenue tonight could destroy your company by tomorrow. So is it justified? Was Blizzard just making the smart business decision?\n\nPerhaps, but we should all be deeply worried about how tied up western companies have gotten with authoritarian regimes. They, and they alone, put themselves in a position where the Chinese government can gut their company at their leisure. Every company that willingly aids Chinese government repression should be deeply ashamed. We all know that it\u2019s really corporations that run the world, and these corporations could cut their margins by a few per cent and stand up for values such as freedom of speech, but they won\u2019t, because they don\u2019t care about the little people.\n\nOh, they\u2019ll throw the people a bone every now and then. They\u2019ll make characters gay, they\u2019ll make their conferences accessible to those who are hard of hearing, they\u2019ll use buzzwords like \u201cdiversity\u201d and \u201cinclusion\u201d, they\u2019ll invent company values like \u201cevery voice matters\u201d and \u201clead responsibly\u201d, but when the rubber hits the road and they have to actually stand up and fight for basic human rights at the expense of investor profits, they fall, and they fall hard. Had Blitzchung said \u201cFuck Trump\u201d on a Blizzard livestream, do you really think he would have received the same punishment? I doubt it. Try saying \u201cXi Jinping looks like Winnie the Pooh\u201d and see how far you get.\n\nIt\u2019s easy for ordinary people to feel that they are powerless. But we can all do something small, and the small gestures from thousands \u2013 or millions \u2013 of us will add up. I loved Blizzard; up until two days ago I was playing Classic World of Warcraft daily. I\u2019ve spent hundreds, if not thousands, of hours in its games. However I couldn\u2019t, in good faith, continue giving it a single cent of my money. Its actions and complete disregard for human rights have disgusted me, and the entire community that plays its games.\n\nIt\u2019s sad, it\u2019s unfortunate, but I think we should all cancel our WoW subscriptions. Delete Battle.net from your computer, uninstall Hearthstone, delete your account, it doesn\u2019t matter. Stop giving this company money. When you\u2019re cancelling your subscription, mention Hong Kong, mention Blitzchung, condemn Blizzard on every medium you know. Get your friends to cancel their subscriptions, encourage each other to stop playing, find something new. Find a company that hasn\u2019t picked profits over freedom, and give it your money instead.\n\nWhat Blizzard gains in revenue from China, it must lose from the rest of the world. Gaming is normally a medium used to escape from a harsh world, but sometimes you have to stick to your principles and say \u201cNo, Diablo 4 isn\u2019t going to fix this\u201d. The company won\u2019t change unless you do. We have to speak in the only language it knows: money.", "description": "The company won\u2019t change unless we make them.
