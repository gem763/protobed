While the sport has evolved dramatically over the decades, most matchups are still played on Sundays. And come Monday, die-hard fans eagerly dissect every play and on-field move.\n\nFor nearly the NFL\u2019s entire history there has been a name for this sort of second-guesser: a \u201cMonday morning quarterback.\u201d Over the years, the phrase has been extended to label anyone who passes judgment on the actions of others with the benefit of hindsight.\n\nThe position of \u201cquarterback\u201d dates back to the British game of rugby as played in the late 19th century. It was then imported into the rugby-like game that Americans were developing at Ivy League schools. Walter Camp of Yale University enshrined the position of quarterback as the offensive play caller in rules drafted for colleges in 1880.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for a certain critical breed of fan to emerge and question what transpired on the field. In a 1927 column, New York Evening Telegram sports editor Joe Williams recalled Percy Haughton, head coach at Cornell, Harvard and Columbia, observing that \u201cthe stands surrounding the football fields held several hundred times as many quarterbacks as ever got into uniform.\u201d Williams termed these fans \u201cgrandstand quarterbacks.\u201d\n\n\u201c In 1931, a Harvard quarterback faulted \u2018Monday morning quarterbacks\u2019 in the stands with overinflating the importance of the game. \u201d\n\nThat same season, a columnist for the Journal and Courier of Lafayette, Ind., suggested another name, observing that the ranks of \u201cSunday morning quarterbacks\u201d were swelling \u201cwith every loss on the gridiron.\u201d The name made sense since college football games were mostly played on Saturdays. It evolved into the \u201cMonday morning\u201d incarnation a few years later, but still referred to fans of the college game; professional football had not yet caught on beyond the Midwest. Harvard quarterback Barry Wood used the expression in a widely reported speech in 1931 where he faulted \u201cMonday morning quarterbacks\u201d in the stands with overinflating the importance of the game.\n\nStill more variations sprang up in sportswriting in the 1930s. Recently, researcher Peter Reitan (who blogs under the name Peter Jensen Brown ) has documented terms that reflected how games were increasingly enjoyed on radio: \u201cdrugstore quarterback\u201d (a cousin of \u201cdrugstore cowboy\u201d), \u201carmchair quarterback,\u201d \u201ceasy chair quarterback,\u201d \u201cradio quarterback,\u201d \u201cparlor quarterback,\u201d and \u201cliving room quarterback.\u201d\n\nMost of these faded away, however, when the NFL began making inroads with the advent of television in the 1950s. \u201cMonday morning quarterbacks\u201d won out, though \u201carmchair quarterbacks\u201d also remained popular, in the same family as \u201carmchair critics\u201d and \u201carmchair warriors.\u201d\n\nWhile the hypercritical yet inexperienced \u201cMonday morning quarterback\u201d has spread as a put-down to other fields like the military and politics, among football commentators the label has been embraced with a whiff of self-deprecation. In 1997, Peter King started an online column for Sports Illustrated called \u201cMonday Morning Quarterback,\u201d which eventually transformed into the magazine\u2019s NFL-centered webpage, dubbed \u201cThe MMQB\u201d for short. (Last year, Mr. King moved on to NBC Sports, where he re-christened his column \u201cFootball Morning in America.\u201d)\n\nIn the age of social media, however, the idea of waiting until Monday morning to analyze Sunday\u2019s games feels anachronistic. Mr. Reitan suggests a more instantaneous idiom: \u201cthe Twitterback.\u201d", "description": "It didn\u2019t take long for fans to become experts in the game of second-guessing", "authors": ["Ben Zimmer", "Bgzimmer Wsj Gmail.Com"], "top_image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OG-DD617_201909_SOC_20190905161545.gif", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
