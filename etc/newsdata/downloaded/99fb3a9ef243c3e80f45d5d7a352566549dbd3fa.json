Bill Daley, who was White House chief of staff during the bin Laden raid, was seated next to then-President Barack Obama as he monitored the raid in a secure White House room with a small group of senior officials.\n\nAndrew Card, former President George W. Bush\u2019s longtime chief of staff, said the exclusion of Mulvaney from a moment of such magnitude in the presidency is difficult to grasp because the chief of staff typically would be in national security meetings leading up to it and tasked with coordinating with other top officials on everything from a communications strategy to a plan in case the raid failed.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nbcnews.Com Politics White-House"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
