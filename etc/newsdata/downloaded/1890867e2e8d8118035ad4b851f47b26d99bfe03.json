She\u2019d soon learn that because of an error by the hospital, the thumb would need to be amputated \u2014 and replaced with her toe.\n\n\u201cIt was an uncomplicated fracture, an uncomplicated surgery and a pretty awful mistake,\u201d Tom Ballantyne, a lawyer who represents Thomas, told The Washington Post.\n\nThe shocking medical mishap was first reported this week in an investigation by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation into problems at regional hospitals in Australia, where routine injuries have had dire consequences for patients. Doctors at other hospitals have ignored necrotic infections and misplaced breathing tubes, leaving patients severely disabled or even dead, the channel reported. The series has spurred several regional hospitals to publicly account for shortcomings.\n\nThomas\u2019s gruesome case came after she played in a cricket match in Hong Kong in late March 2018, when she split a bone in her left thumb. An orthopedic surgeon corrected the fracture in a routine surgery, then set the injury in a plaster cast.\n\nWhen the teen returned days later with intense pain in her hand, the doctor found her thumb was swollen and dark purple. The problem was obvious: It was still bound with an elastic tourniquet mistakenly left in place after the surgery.\n\n\u201cThey pulled the plaster off and it was very dark, looked very dead,\u201d Leanne Keating, Thomas\u2019s mother, told a reporter the ABC.\n\nThe prognosis shocked Thomas, who keeps her cricket trophies on her bedroom dresser and dreamed of becoming a professional player.\n\n\u201cThey took me into emergency and they were like, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re probably going to lose your thumb,\u2019\u201d Thomas told ABC. \u201cI was in so much disbelief.\u201d\n\nMost of her thumb had died, she learned. Doctors first applied leeches to try to encourage blood to return to the dead tissue and then sewed it to Thomas\u2019s groin in hopes of restoring the thumb\u2019s blood flow and nerve response. Eventually, a surgeon amputated the maimed appendage, then cut off Thomas\u2019s big toe to replace it.\n\n\u201cPeople ask me, they\u2019re like \u2018Oh why does your thumb look so weird?\u2019\u201d Thomas told ABC reporter Louise Milligan. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, \u2018Because it\u2019s not my thumb, it\u2019s my toe.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe hospital\u2019s mistake left Thomas with severely limited use of her left hand. Her foot had to be significantly altered in surgery, too. To replace Thomas\u2019s big toe, doctors took a piece of her hip and created a new bone for her foot.\n\n\u201cIt was a really basic, gross error of leaving the tourniquet on,\u201d Ballantyne told The Post.\n\nLatrobe Regional Hospital is the main medical facility in the Gippsland region of southeastern Victoria, Australia, where Thomas lives. Ballantyne says it is the regional hospital where most people go for serious medical treatments such as chemotherapy or orthopedic surgery, unless they travel all the way to Melbourne.\n\nLatrobe Regional Hospital later launched an investigation that found the surgical team had checked a box indicating the tourniquet had been removed, but it had not. Hospital officials did not immediately return a request for comment, but the hospital\u2019s chief executive, Peter Craighead, spoke to ABC.\n\n\u201cI felt sick in the stomach,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very devastating, you know, that you see something happen like that.\u201d\n\nThomas, meanwhile, missed so much class during her medical crisis she dropped out of school. She can hardly hit a cricket ball now.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t grip the bat,\u201d she said, while showing a reporter how her toe-turned-thumb cannot bend at the knuckle.", "description": "After doctors forgot to remove a tourniquet, killing Brittany Thomas's thumb, they decided to replace the finger with her big toe.", "authors": ["Katie Shepherd", "Morning Mix Reporter"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HLYO4Y5LTJHR5G6GLTZQAI22NY.png", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
