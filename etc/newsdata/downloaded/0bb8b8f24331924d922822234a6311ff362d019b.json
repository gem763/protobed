The question has been part of the show\u2019s DNA since it premiered in 2018. There are, after all, only so many ultra-rich families who could have provided a basis for the satire, and they have all made headlines \u2013 some more frequently than others.\n\nEven a cursory glance at America\u2019s most ludicrously wealthy suggests several potential real-life inspirations for the Roys, from the Trumps (more on them in a minute) to the Gettys, the Redstones and the Hearsts. And if you look beyond the US \u2013 and why wouldn\u2019t you, since Logan Roy was born in Dundee, Scotland, much like Brian Cox, who portrays him \u2013 another significant name attaches itself to the list: the Murdochs.\n\nWhile the Murdochs\u2019 name is often floated as the most accurate real-life equivalent of the Roys, the family at the centre of the HBO black comedy is evidently a composite clan that shares similarities with other nouveau riche tribes. Logan, Kendall, Roman, Shiv, Greg, Tom and Marcia all seem to have been born out of various family histories and tabloid sagas.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe show\u2019s mastermind, Peep Show creator Jesse Armstrong, previously wrote a screenplay titled Murdoch, which centered on an imagined family gathering for the media mogul\u2019s 78th birthday. Armstrong has acknowledged that the Murdochs have been a talking point among the show\u2019s writers (a summary of the screenplay published by Forbes in 2011 closely resembles the Succession pilot), while also bringing up several other names in an interview with Variety. \u201cThis is a fictional family,\u201d he said of the Roys. \u201cThere\u2019s loads of succession stories to draw on. We wanted to draw on all the good, rich stories there are about succession and about media and high politics.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth attempting to place the show in a real-life context, if only to better inform one\u2019s reading of what has been deemed the best show currently on TV. Here\u2019s a breakdown of how the Roys relate to some of the most high-profile fortunes of our time.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 29 TV shows that have been made into bad films Show all 29 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. 29 TV shows that have been made into bad films 1/29 The A-Team Joe Carnahan\u2019s dusty and grimy adaptation retained the catchphrases and character personalities of the original series, while surrounding them with an entirely incoherent plot and noisy sub-Michael Bay action. Liam Neeson made for a fun Hannibal Smith and UFC fighter Quinton \u201cRampage\u201d Jackson did his best as BA Baracus, but a never-more-slappable Bradley Cooper and the chronically unappealing Sharlto Copley were the pits. 20th Century Fox 2/29 Aeon Flux A sad-all-round adaptation of the cult MTV animated series from the 1990s, Aeon Flux abandoned the avant-garde, largely dialogue-free sensuality of its source material for generic action and dodgy special effects. If it weren\u2019t for the classy presence of Charlize Theron and director Karyn Kusama, whose early cut was radically altered by producers, this would have basically been a bargain-bin Milla Jovovich joint. And that, honestly, would have been a lot more fun. Paramount Pictures 3/29 The Avengers Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman must have been grateful when Marvel came along and helped scrub 1998 film The Avengers even further out of cultural memory. But for those who had to endure their hammy 1998 adaptation of the classic spy series, it\u2019d take a lot more than Iron Man and Captain America to make us forget the image of Sean Connery inexplicably dressed in a giant bear costume and trying to control the weather. Shudders. Warner Bros 4/29 Bad Education Although The Bad Education Movie arrived in a similar summertime slot to the successful Inbetweeners film, this sitcom adaptation was nowhere near as popular. Jack Whitehall\u2019s performance was panned by critics who said he appeared \u201cdesperate to shock\u201d as delinquent teacher Alfie Wickers and described the whole movie as a \u201cfarce\u201d. Endemol UK 5/29 Are You Being Served? This 1977 film based on BBC sitcom Are You Being Served? took its inspiration from a theatre production in Blackpool. While it found success on stage, the big screen version was met with hostility, with one critic calling it \"guilty of violating almost every law of comedy and film\". EMI 6/29 Baywatch David Hasselhoff is unforgettable as the hunky chief lifeguard Mitch Buchannon patrolling a sunny beach in Baywatch. After a rocky start when the first season was cancelled on NBC, it became the world's most-watched TV show, running in its original format for 10 years until 1999. The unnecessary big-screen version of the show starred Dwayne Johnson in Hasselhoff\u2019s role and Zac Efron as a new recruit. Even the nostalgic cameo from the show's former star didn\u2019t make up for the paper-thin plot. Paramount Pictures 7/29 Bewitched Because nose-centric glory for Nicole Kidman couldn\u2019t happen twice, this adaptation of sparkly magical sitcom Bewitched arrived two years after the actor won her Oscar for The Hours, and promptly became a key component in her Queen of Flops reputation throughout the late-2000s. This had brilliance written all over it, from Nora Ephron behind the camera to Will Ferrell, Steve Carell, Jason Schwartzman and Shirley MacLaine in the supporting cast, but still somehow managed to stink. Columbia Pictures 8/29 Keith Lemon Leigh Francis character Keith Lemon received the big screen treatment in 2012's Keith Lemon: The Film, one of the only titles to have ever received zero per cent on Rotten Tomatoes. Putting pins in one's eyes is rumoured to be a better experience. Lionsgate 9/29 Dad's Army Despite an all-star cast that included Bill Nighy, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Michael Gambon and Tony Jones, the poorly judged spin-off of the much-loved BBC sitcom Dad's Army (2016) took a pounding from critics, who derided the attempt at an homage to a TV show that had nothing wrong with it in the first place. Universal Pictures 10/29 Dark Shadows The nadir of Tim Burton\u2019s career, Dark Shadows was a film nobody was particularly crying out for, most of the fans of the original 1960s fantasy soap opera long dead and the general public having by then grown tired of Johnny Depp\u2019s \u201cheavily made-up comedy weirdo\u201d schtick. Most egregious, however, was the film\u2019s failure to properly utilise Michelle Pfeiffer 20 years after she played Catwoman in Burton\u2019s Batman Returns. Warner Bros Pictures 11/29 Downton Abbey Julian Fellowes took the beloved TV drama about the lives of the aristocratic Crawley family and the people who serve them \u2013 and turned it into one long fawning session about the royals. Absolutely nothing happens in this film where an entire sub-plot involves a boiler being fixed, and another, completely implausible storyline about an assassination attempt on the king. The only real intrigue is why Thomas, the butler, has suddenly acquired a very orange tan. This is what happens when British institutions get a Hollywood makeover, folks. Focus Features 12/29 The Dukes of Hazzard There was a time when Johnny Knoxville, Seann William Scott and Jessica Simpson were the hottest cast in town. There was never a time this unwanted cinematic revival of the action comedy series wasn't entirely stupid. Warner Bros Pictures 13/29 Entourage Life imitated art when the main stars at the heart of HBO show Entourage hit the red carpet for the film version. Sadly, it lacked the vim that was present in most seasons of the show and ultimately felt like a mediocre feature-length episode. Warner Bros Pictures 14/29 Harry Enfield's Television Programme Kevin and Perry Go Large was no doubt adored by teens everywhere upon its released in 2000, which is why it's gained a cult following in the years since. In all honesty, the film is so terrible it's actually brilliant. Icon Film Distribution 15/29 The League of Gentlemen 2005 film The League of Gentlemen's Apocalypse is proof that Steve Pemberton, Reece Shearsmith, Mark Gatiss and Jeremy Dyson can do wrong. On the bright side, it's reassuring to know the multi-talented quartet are indeed human after all. United International Pictures 16/29 The Magic Roundabout It's not exactly clear who The Magic Roundabout film was intended for considering kids at the time would have had no idea who Dougal, Zebedee or company were. Save for providing work for Robbie Williams, Tom Baker and Bill Nighy, this version wasn\u2019t much use for anyone. Path\u00e9 Distribution 17/29 Mrs Brown's Boys We are all to blame for the abysmal Mrs Brown's Boys D'Movie. If the sitcom's Christmas specials weren't the most-watched episodes of television in the UK every year, then Brendan O'Carroll probably wouldn\u2019t have ever thought a film could be possible. Universal Pictures 18/29 The Office Ricky Gervais just couldn't stay away from his Office character David Brent and gave him the big screen treatment in 2016's Life on the Road. Every second paled in comparison to ever single episode of the classic BBC series. Entertainment One 19/29 Pok\u00e9mon The experience of watching the first ever Pok\u00e9mon film \u2013 titled Pok\u00e9mon: The First Movie \u2013 can be likened to watching a YouTube tutorial of someone playing a Pok\u00e9mon video game, only somehow more boring. Toho 20/29 Postman Pat The charming story of Postman Pat and his black and white cat in the fictional and busy village of Greendale first screened on the BBC in 1981. What a shame that Postman Pat: The Movie in 2014 \u2013 the 3D animated feature film version \u2013 managed to stray so far from its original simplicity. It sees Postman Pat (voiced by Stephen Mangan) enter an X-Factor style-singing contest, and despite featuring an impressive array of voice actors, including Rupert Grint, Jim Broadbent and David Tennant, the film was too scary for the under-fives \u2013 especially the scene that sees Pat turn into a sinister robot. Lionsgate 21/29 Sex and the City Sex and the City had all the ingredients for a great movie: starry cast, cult fanbase, glamorous setting. Alas, both films were an embarrassment to the original series. Not enough happened in the movies to warrant anything longer than a 30-minute episode and unfortunately we can never unsee Sarah Jessica Parker and co doing that bizarre slo-mo walk through the desert. Warner Bros Pictures 22/29 Spooks The problem with 2015 film Spooks: The Greater Good is that is arrived about 10 years too late. Spooks was a decent BBC drama that ended in 2011 and that's how it should have stayed. Entertainment One 23/29 SWAT Based on the 1975 series of the same name, this action crime thriller starred Samuel L Jackson, Michelle Rodriguez, LL Cool J, Jeremy Renner, and Colin Farrell in one of his early box office hits. There was plenty of high-octane drama and Farrell was convincing as a hot-shot cop taking on a French drug lord (Olivier Martinez), but it\u2019s also completely predictable and, ultimately, extremely pointless. Columbia Pictures 24/29 The Sweeney An updated version of BBC crime series The Sweeney starring Ray Winstone sounds like something from spoof heaven. The finished film, released in 2012, didn't really do much to convince anyone that it wasn't. Entertainment One 25/29 Thunderbirds Sure, Ben Kingsley as The Hood is a great spot of casting, but practically everything else in the film version of Gerry Anderson's Thunderbirds failed to make the grade. Anderson himself was most damning; he called it \"the biggest load of crap I have ever seen in my entire life.\" Universal Pictures 26/29 The Twilight Zone There are some interesting things in Twilight Zone: The Movie, but it loses points for featuring one of the worst pieces of work from Steven Spielberg: a segment set in a retirement home titled \"Kick the Can\". Warner Bros 27/29 Veronica Mars Just because the Veronica Mars cast and its loyal fans really wanted a movie spin-off to be made, it doesn\u2019t mean it should have ever actually happened. The TV show was revived thanks to funds raised by star Kristen Bell on Kickstarter, but the film was criticised for making literally no sense for anyone who hadn\u2019t watched the series. Warner Bros. Pictures 28/29 Wild Wild West Famously bad, Wild Wild West was adapted from the 1960s TV show and was the 2000 recipient of the golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture. Warner Bros Pictures 29/29 The X-Files You\u2019d have thought that taking The X-Files to the big screen, midway through the show\u2019s original run, would result in some major revelations about the show\u2019s oft-maligned alien mythology at its centre. Alas, it only opened up another barrel of questions to which series creator Chris Carter always struggled to answer. 20th Century Fox 1/29 The A-Team Joe Carnahan\u2019s dusty and grimy adaptation retained the catchphrases and character personalities of the original series, while surrounding them with an entirely incoherent plot and noisy sub-Michael Bay action.

Alas, it only opened up another barrel of questions to which series creator Chris Carter always struggled to answer. 20th Century Fox\n\nThere\u2019s no denying that the Roys make for a pretty accurate fictional version of the Murdochs. Both families revolve around a patriarch \u2013 Logan Roy / Rupert Murdoch \u2013 and while Murdoch himself was born in Melbourne, Australia, his grandfather, the Presbyterian minister Patrick John Murdoch, is a native of Aberdeenshire, Scotland, which mirrors Logan\u2019s origins. Naturally, both men have built media empires (Murdoch\u2019s News Corp vs Logan\u2019s Waystar Royco) \u2013 though Logan is understood to have grown up in relative poverty, while Murdoch was the Oxford-educated son of a local newspaper owner.\n\nOn paper, News Corp and Waystar are comparable: both are multi-billion mass media and entertainment companies, though News Corp is currently more focused on newspapers while Waystar tends to favour TV channels and the occasional digital venture (when Kendall gets involved). A corporate spin-off resulted in the 2013 creation of 21st Century Fox, News Corp\u2019s film and TV entity, which was purchased in March 2019 by The Walt Disney Company. Disney, of course, operates a cruise line and an impressive catalogue of theme parks, similarly to \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 Waystar.\n\nSpeaking of Waystar\u2019s cruise division, both Logan\u2019s and Murdoch\u2019s business empires have been marred by scandal. News Corp was a key player in the phone-hacking scandal, which led to the 2011 closure of the News of the World. Waystar, meanwhile, has cruise-ship-shaped skeletons in its closet \u2013 just ask Tom Wamsgans about the terrible crime cover-ups the division has orchestrated over the years.\n\nMurdoch\u2019s personal life somewhat echoes Logan\u2019s (Murdoch has been married four times and has six children; Marcia, Logan\u2019s spouse on the show, is his third wife, and the media mogul has three sons and one daughter), but structurally speaking, the Roy siblings are more reminiscent of another powerful family: the Trump clan.\n\nKendall, perhaps the most dogged of the Roy children (Shiv might disagree with this assessment), has strong Donald Trump Jr energy. The US president\u2019s eldest child is also an executive vice-president at the Trump Organisation, his father\u2019s conglomerate, as is Eric Trump, Don Jr\u2019s younger sibling (remember in season one, when Kendall and Roman were respectively CEO and COO of Waystar?). A key difference, however, is Don Jr\u2019s apparently limitless loyalty to his father. In real life, the president\u2019s eldest has always been prompt to defend him on social media or during guest appearances on Fox News, while Kendall spends 90 per cent of his awake time (at least in season one) plotting to take down Logan and replace him at Waystar.\n\nOf course, the Roys have plenty of political connections, mainly through Logan\u2019s decades of endearing himself to the most powerful people in America, as well as through Shiv\u2019s career as a political consultant. (The Trumps\u2019 ties to the political world need either no explanation at all or way too many to fit them all here.) Shiv is a somewhat startling fictionalised version of Ivanka Trump. Both work in politics, though the former\u2019s career tends to push her away from her father, while the latter\u2019s is a direct result of her father\u2019s ascent to the White House. And in a blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it season one jab, one of Shiv\u2019s brothers bitterly claims that she\u2019s Logan\u2019s favourite, which echoes a long-accepted status quo as to Ivanka Trump\u2019s position in her family\u2019s pecking order.\n\nCox himself drew a comparison between the Roys and the Trumps in a recent interview with the LA Times, telling the publication: \u201cThe artistic responsibility is to see it as it is, which is a morality tale. It\u2019s about entitlement and about the time we live in. You look at Ivanka, you look at [her husband Jared] Kushner, and the fact that they are in positions which they have never been elected to. There\u2019s nothing democratic about where they\u2019ve come from.\u201d\n\nIf the Trump parallels are pretty obvious for three of the four Roy siblings, they are less so for Connor. He is the only child born from Logan\u2019s first marriage, while Kendall, Roman and Shiv were all born from his union with Caroline Collingwood, his second spouse. In that regard, Connor is in a similar situation to Tiffany Trump and her sibling Barron, born respectively from Donald Trump\u2019s marriage to Marla Maples and Melania Trump (the Connor-Tiffany comparison has been supported by Jezebel, who painted both of them as the \u201ckind of eccentric\u201d children of their otherwise predictable families). Donald Jr, Eric and Ivanka, meanwhile, were all born from his union with Ivana Trump, making her the de facto Caroline Collingwood in this configuration.\n\nWhile the Murdochs and the Trumps\u2019 shadows loom rather inescapably over Succession, another family kept springing to mind as I fell further and further down a Roy-shaped rabbit hole over the course of the show\u2019s first season: the Gettys. At first, it was hard to pinpoint why my brain kept making that connection \u2013 sure, the Gettys are very rich, as are the Roys, and like most wealthy tribes, they orbit around at least one patriarch and many children, but surely, there had to be more to the comparison. And yet, the Gettys\u2019 family tree is more complex than the Roys\u2019, and their fortune came from oil, not media ventures (though Mark Getty eventually co-founded the photo agency Getty Images in 1995). So why did it feel like the Gettys had left their mark on the show?\n\nThe answer came as I watched \u201cPre-Nuptial\u201d, the ninth episode in the drama\u2019s first season, when the Roys travel to England for Shiv\u2019s wedding (scenes for the episode were shot at Eastnor Castle in Ledbury, Herefordshire). I was having flashbacks from All the Money in the World, the 2017 film about the kidnapping of John Paul Getty III in the Seventies. While rooted in America, the Getty family has strong ties to Europe, more specifically to Britain. Notably, the Minnesota-born J Paul Getty resettled in Surrey, England, and more recently, his great-granddaughter Natalia, better known as Nats Getty, moved to England as a child and attended a boarding school in Oxford (she now lives in her native Los Angeles). All this is to say, the way in which the Roys express their wealth \u2013 their tastes, their aesthetics \u2013 are much, much more redolent of the Gettys than, say, the Trumps. The Gettys\u2019 sprawling estate in the Chilterns, Wormsley Park, which was acquired by the family in the Eighties, could conceivably have served as a wedding venue for Shiv, had Eastnor Castle not been available. The Roys might be ultra-wealthy, but rarely do they appear outwardly nouveau riche; rather, they seem to have become adept at adopting the codes of European wealth in Logan\u2019s lifetime. Logan and Marcia\u2019s residence in New York City, a clearly expensive yet tasteful flat, is miles away from the gaudy, gold-and-marble-decked penthouse in Trump Tower.\n\nBecause wealthy families all seem to follow similar patterns of behaviour, it\u2019s possible to liken the Roys to some other clans, too. At the heart of Succession is the question of what should happen to the family fortune when the health of the person who amassed it begins to deteriorate, an issue faced in a very public manner by the Redstones. In 2016, a headline-making lawsuit questioned the mental competency of media magnate Sumner Redstone, in a set-up that calls to mind Kendall\u2019s bid to launch a vote of no confidence against his father in season one (although Redstone\u2019s lawsuit was brought by his former girlfriend Manuela Herzer). The Redstone case was dismissed in May 2016.\n\nIt\u2019s also tempting to compare the Roys to the Hearsts, the family behind Hearst Communications (whose catalogue includes Cosmopolitan, ELLE, Marie Claire, as well as several newspapers and cable channels), or to the Maxwells (the family of British media proprietor Robert Maxwell, whose publishing empire toppled after his death in 1991). Both names have been floated by Armstrong as inspirations for Succession. Still, the Roys, as brilliantly written and realistic as they might be, remain a fictional amalgam of some of our most high-profile fortunes \u2013 and perhaps that\u2019s for the best.", "description": "It\u2019s hard to watch Succession, the gilded US comedy drama about a dysfunctional media family empire, without wondering if Logan Roy\u2019s dynasty has a real-life counterpart. The question\u00a0has been part of the show\u2019s DNA since it premiered in 2018. There are, after all, only so many ultra-rich families who could have provided a basis for the satire, and they have all made headlines", "authors": ["Cl\u00e9mence Michallon"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/18/15/shutterstock-editorial-9744108s.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
