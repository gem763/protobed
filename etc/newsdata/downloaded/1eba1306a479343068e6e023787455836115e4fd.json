The pipeline has been moving North Dakota oil through South Dakota and Iowa to Illinois for more than two years.\n\nThe Standing Rock Sioux want the pipeline shut down and more study done. The tribe fears an oil spill could contaminate the Missouri River.\n\nThe Bismarck Tribune reports that a Justice Department attorney argues that the Corps \"carefully and reasonably considered the environmental impacts\" before it permitted the pipeline.\n\nPipeline developer Texas-based Energy Transfer says the line is safe.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nInformation from: Bismarck Tribune, http://www.bismarcktribune.com", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
