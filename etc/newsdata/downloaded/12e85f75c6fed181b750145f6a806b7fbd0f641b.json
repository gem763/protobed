And much of it has been in the opposition dug-out.\n\n\u201cSome of the teams we play every year it\u2019s a different fella in charge,\u201d he says, during a rare free moment at Lancaster University\u2019s Sports Centre, where the club rents training facilities. \u201cTo give you an example, against Oldham I\u2019ve come across four different managers in the last 12 months.\u201d\n\nIt is not like that at Morecambe. Bentley is the manager who has been in office the longest of any among the 91 league clubs. Not that he has been around for decades. Indeed there is perhaps no statistic more telling of the game\u2019s short-termism than the fact that Bentley rose to top the longevity list after just seven years in charge of the Shrimps.\n\n\u201cWhen I first got the job, there was Alex Ferguson at the head of the list, 20-plus years, Arsene Wenger next, 20-odd years; you\u2019re thinking: that\u2019s proper stints. To get to the top after seven? It shows you the game\u2019s gone mad.\u201d\n\nBut it is a mark of his survival instincts \u2013 and a sharp ability to coach, which is in evidence as he puts his players through a set-piece training session later - that Bentley has been the longest serving manager in the game for 17 months now, since Paul Tisdale resigned from Exeter City in June 2018.", "description": "Jim Bentley has seen some change in his time as manager at Morecambe.", "authors": ["Jim White", "Oliver Brown"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/11/TELEMMGLPICT000212489070-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqaRL1kC4G7DT9ZsZm6Pe3PUPXbRlaI4_qh_dM2Z5d688.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
