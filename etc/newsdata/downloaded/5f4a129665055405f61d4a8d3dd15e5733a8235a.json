Asked about his expectations for the new emperor, he said: \u201cSimply by existing, rather than by doing something, the emperor is a support for our hearts.\u201d\n\nYOSHIKAZU ARAI, 74, RETIRED SURGEON\n\n\u201cThere is no need to make such a big fuss ... everyone knows it is happening, it\u2019s been reported. There is no need for such an elaborate ceremony. Traffic has been restricted and it is causing inconvenience for ordinary people,\u201d Arai said.\n\nAsked about his hopes for the new emperor, he said he had none. \u201cThe emperor is necessary now as a symbol of the people, but at some point, the emperor will no longer be necessary. Things will be just fine without an emperor.\u201d\n\nRYOYA SUZUKI, 25, COMPANY EMPLOYEE\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be nice if the new emperor will be as kind-hearted as the former emperor and stay close to the people,\u201d Suzuki said in front of the palace. He said he was a car buff and had come especially to see the emperor arrive in his limousine.\n\nTOMOKO SHIRAKAWA, 51, KYOTO RESIDENT\n\n\u201cAs he is young and energetic with outstanding leadership, I hope he\u2019ll support the people of Japan, which has faced continuous disasters and typhoons,\u201d said Tomoko Shirakawa, 51, who was waiting in front of the palace.\n\nShe said she was visiting Tokyo from the ancient capital of Kyoto, in western Japan, so decided to come to the palace.\n\nJUNKO CHIJIWA, 64, HOUSEWIFE AND DAUGHTER, NATSUKI, 30\n\n\u201cI would like the new emperor to be close to us, the people, and stand with us, just like his father did. I am always moved to see them console disaster victims,\u201d said Chijiwa, who came from her home in Kyushu, southwestern Japan, in hopes of seeing the parade that had been scheduled for after the ceremony.\n\nThe parade was cancelled after Typhoon Hagibis caused huge flooding in parts of northeast Japan.\n\n\u201cI was born in the first year of the Heisei era,\u201d said Chijiwa\u2019s daughter, Natsuki, referring to the imperial era that began in 1989, when Naruhito\u2019s father Akihito inherited the throne and ended when he abdicated on April 30.\n\n\u201cSo, this is the first time for me to see a new emperor taking the throne. I have been watching the former emperor standing by the people, and I want the new emperor and empress to inherit that spirit.\u201d", "description": "Japanese Emperor Naruhito, 59, the nation's first monarch born after World War Two, officially proclaimed his enthronement to the world on Tuesday in a centuries-old ceremony attended by hundreds of dignitaries.", "authors": ["Kwiyeon Ha", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
