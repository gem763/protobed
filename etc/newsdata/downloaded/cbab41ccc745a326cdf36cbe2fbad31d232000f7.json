As measured by the Economic Policy Institute in 2015, the top 1% of residents earned an average of $16.2 million, more than 132 times the average income of the bottom 99% of families.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, are seen during the three-day \"Challenges for Monetary Policy\" conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, U.S., August 23, 2019.

In addition to DJ-ing weddings with his production company, Muldoon has also served as the mayor of Jackson since 2017.\n\nPete Muldoon sits on a baggage claim belt after his shift at the Jackson Hole Airport.

And instead of spending their money on park entrance fees or ski lift tickets, they are throwing money into rising housing costs.\n\nFor the Fed, the question remains: If people have jobs and prices are not suffering from runaway inflation, is the average worker on Jackson\u2019s Broadway Ave or any Main Street in America truly better off?\n\nMaking the drive\n\nJackson is not like the average U.S. small town. As the gateway to the Tetons, Jackson relies on the high-volume summer months to drive economic activity.\n\nWhen souvenir shops and restaurants open for the high season, jobs can be found nearly everywhere, which is why the unemployment rate in Teton County was a remarkably low 2.3% in June. With a census-estimated population of only 10,429, Jackson relies on importing labor from abroad \u2014 through J1 and H2B visas \u2014 for temporary summer work.", "description": "The Fed descends on Jackson Hole every August to discuss the pressing issues facing central bankers.
