He wants to defeat Spence, then challenge Manny Pacquiao.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nShawn Porter is the forgotten fighter in the media's rush to anoint a new Floyd Mayweather, leaving him feeling \"overlooked\" despite proclaiming to be \"the best welterweight in the world.\"\n\nThe American boxer Porter has 30 wins (17 by knockout) against two losses and one draw. His record has featured a who's who of top 147-pounders for more than five years. He has even posted good victories over Devon Alexander, Adrien Broner, Andre Berto, Danny Garcia, and, most recently, Yordenis Ugas.\n\nBut Porter is not seen as the best in the world in his division, he is not heralded as one of the top pound-for-pound fighters, and his ability to win against elite opponents has failed to see him attract comparisons to Mayweather.\n\nNo.\n\nThose honors are instead reserved for Errol Spence, the unbeaten Texan who is favored to beat Porter at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on Saturday. The LA Times even published an opinion piece this week asking, \"Can Errol Spence be the new Floyd Mayweather?\"\n\n\"I think I'm the best welterweight in the world,\" Porter told Business Insider. \"I have to continue proving myself against other great fighters. But I don't really concern myself with rankings, just winning. I'm only worried about beating Errol.\"\n\nRead more: English travellers like Tyson Fury are taking over boxing but there's a good reason why they fight nothing like Brad Pitt's character in 'Snatch'\n\nSpence, Porter said, \"is sharp, smart, patient and he picks his punches.\" He added: \"A lot like me, he likes to dictate tempo. Where he'll fall short is that I'm just hard to prepare for. I'm extremely versatile and he won't have all of the pieces to solve this puzzle.\"\n\nPorter's confidence comes from his experience. He said his level of opposition is superior to Spence's. \"Errol only has 25 fights,\" Porter said. \"I don't know how many of those opponents were champions \u2014 I think only a couple. I've faced lots of top guys and I have all the experience that I need to beat Errol. I expect that to show up on fight night.\"\n\nShawn Porter feels avoided\n\nOf the best match-ups to make in world boxing, a dream all-American affair between Spence and welterweight rival Terence Crawford has long been touted. It would pit two champions, both unbeaten, against one another. The winner could be seen as this era's Mayweather.\n\nOne man not mentioned in that match-up is Porter, who feels Crawford will do his best to avoid him should he continue winning. \"I get it,\" he told us. \"We're all human and people look to the future. But Terence Crawford said that when Shawn Porter beats Errol Spence, he'll still want to fight Spence.\"\n\nFloyd Mayweather.

And yes, he's overlooking me because he wants that future that he sees for himself.\"\n\nPorter finished by saying he has his own dream match-up. \"After I win this fight against Spence, it should be [Manny] Pacquiao next for me,\" he said. \"I'd love to take another belt from one of the greatest of all time.\"", "description": "Shawn Porter fights unbeaten American fighter Errol Spence on Saturday, with the winner one step closer to being this generation's Floyd Mayweather.", "authors": ["Alan Dawson"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8f3e8e2e22af2bd87894c0?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
