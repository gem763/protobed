It is a prelude to a judicial review and Extinction Rebellion (XR) described the ban as a \u201cdisproportionate and unprecedented attempt to curtail peaceful protest\u201d.\n\nPoliticians, civil rights campaigners and environmentalists have condemned the police crackdown on the protests, saying the London-wide ban was \u201cchilling and unlawful\u201d.\n\nSadiq Khan, the London mayor, issued a statement that appeared to distance himself from the Met\u2019s decision to ban further protests.\n\nA City Hall source said they feared the ban could backfire and be struck down if legally challenged. Sources also said that the protests, which are in their second week, were petering out but could galvanise as a result of the ban.\n\nKhan said: \u201cI am seeking further information from senior officers about the operational decision to impose a section 14 order on the Extinction Rebellion Autumn Uprising \u2013 including at Trafalgar Square \u2013 and why this was necessary.\n\n\u201cI believe the right to peaceful and lawful protest must always be upheld. However, illegal action by some protesters over the past eight days has put undue pressure on already overstretched police officers, and demonstrators should bear this in mind when considering any further actions.\u201d\n\nThe attempt to end the week-long demonstrations began when hundreds of police officers cleared protesters from Trafalgar Square on Monday night. It came as the Metropolitan police issued a revised section 14 order stating \u201cany assembly linked to the Extinction Rebellion \u2018Autumn Uprising\u2019 ... must now cease their protests within London (MPS and City of London Police Areas)\u201d.\n\nDespite the ban, XR protests continued on Tuesday as civil liberty groups and MPs condemned the police strategy.\n\nThe group announced a direct challenge to the police ban, promising a large rally in Trafalgar Square on Wednesday to put police and government \u201cin a dilemma as to whether they are going to arrest public figures for peaceful, democratic assembly\u201d.\n\nThe civil rights group Liberty said banning the protests was \u201cgrossly disproportionate\u201d and an \u201cassault on the right to protest\u201d, while Amnesty said it was \u201can unlawful restriction on the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly \u2026 that would have a chilling effect on rights\u201d.\n\nLabour\u2019s shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, tweeted: \u201cThis ban is completely contrary to Britain\u2019s long-held traditions of policing by consent, freedom of speech, and the right to protest.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Police officers carry away an activist as Extinction Rebellion protesters block a road with a caravan in central London on Tuesday.

One of the organisation\u2019s co-founders, Gail Bradbrook, led a protest at the Department for Transport, where she was arrested for climbing on to the entrance to highlight the contradiction between the expansion of roads and airports and the need to reach zero carbon emissions.\n\nAnother group of XR protesters was later arrested near the MI5 building, on Millbank, where people were gathering for a demonstration to highlight the impact of the crisis on food supplies in the UK. Later in the day, the XR grandparents group was planning its launch and XR academics were due to stage another action.\n\nAt one of the remaining camps, at Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens, protesters were quietly packing away tents on Tuesday after police had apparently enacted a \u201cfive-step warning\u201d with the threat of arrest if they failed to leave.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Emergency services remove Gail Bradbrook, a co-founder of Extinction Rebellion, from the top of the entrance of the Department for Transport, in central London, on 15 October 2019.

If we lose then everyone loses.\u201d\n\nActivists at the site said they would set up camp elsewhere in the city, and keep relocating until the end of the week, when the scheduled two-week rebellion is due to finish.\n\nThe non-violent XR protests aim to highlight the escalating climate and ecological emergency and have led to more than 1,400 arrests in the past week. They have drawn support from scientists, doctors, grandparents and religious leaders \u2013 many of whom were among those arrested.\n\nThe group has three demands: for the UK government to tell the truth about the climate and ecological emergency; for it to adopt a target of zero carbon by 2025 and for the government to set up a citizens assembly to decide future policy on the environment.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Extinction Rebellion protesters outside MI5 HQ, on Millbank, in London, on 15 October 2019. Photograph: Aaron Chown/PA\n\nAt the London assembly\u2019s police and crime committee on Tuesday morning, the Met deputy commissioner, Sir Stephen House, denied a suggestion by the Green member Sian Berry that the revised order was disproportionate.\n\n\u201cWe are not saying, Extinction Rebellion you cannot protest in future. What we are saying is that, in relation to this demonstration, it must now cease, because it\u2019s been going on for 10 days,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Met was paying a heavy financial and operational price for policing the protests, House said. The decision had been taken with the approval of the commissioner, Cressida Dick, and XR was given 48 hours notice that Trafalgar Square would be cleared, the committee heard.", "description": "Group threatens legal action against police and says ban \u2018a chilling assault\u2019 on civil rights", "authors": ["Matthew Taylor", "Vikram Dodd", "Jessica Murray", "Damien Gayle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3db0c12b0c8469920f668d4f0031924b2007910c/0_311_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=06129aca5691e7b2e1b7ec09920dbae7", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
