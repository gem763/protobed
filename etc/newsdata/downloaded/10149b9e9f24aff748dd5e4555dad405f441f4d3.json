And at a conference in Nairobi next month, the UN's population agency is going to present a draft agreement on committing governments to uphold the right to abortion, which is also a politically fraught area.\n\nThese are all important views that matter to elected conservative governments and, as Kevin Rudd noted in The Australian Financial Review this week, each country has the right not to agree to such recommendations or proposals.\n\nWith plenty of fear around global markets, populist left campaigns for such concepts as modern monetary theory are also springing up.\n\nThis is true, but we still need to think about the optics of such recommendations and proposals from bodies such as the World Trade Organisation and the UN, and how they are cast in the media.\n\nWhen Morrison delivered that critical speech at the Lowy Institute in Sydney, listening intently was Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe, who happened to be sitting next to Finance Minister Mathias Cormann.\n\nLowe sits on the international oversight body of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. It is the equivalent of the World Rugby Council for central banks trying to tackle record low interest rates, among other things.\n\nIn a speech of his own in Armidale, NSW, last month, Lowe gave an insight into what these central bankers talk about when they pack their own scrum.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"When I get together with my colleagues from other central banks, which I do at least every two months ... the issues we\u2019ve been discussing more frequently than other issues is whether monetary policy is carrying too much of the burden globally.\"\n\n\"And the answer the central bankers come to, probably not surprisingly given who we are, is that we do feel there is too much burden being placed on monetary policy.\"\n\nIn other words, these bankers felt as though governments needed to do more on fiscal stimulus. In fact, in a landmark report chaired by Lowe and released by the Bank for International Settlements this week, they specifically state: \"One key lesson is that the tools are most effective when used together with a broader set of policies, like fiscal and prudential measures.\"\n\nBut is the fiscal ramp-up recommendation something that Morrison and Treasurer Josh Frydenberg might respond to in the same way they respond to recommendations from other international organisations?\n\nOne key lesson is that the tools are most effective when used together with a broader set of policies, like fiscal and prudential measures. \u2014 Bank for International Settlements report\n\nGiven their imperative of achieving the first surplus in 12 years, they may well respond in the same way.\n\nWhen the Reserve Bank cuts interest rates \u2013 which it has done three times this year \u2013 it has the effect of depreciating the Australian currency, which is good for exports and the economy. But as Stephen Kirchner, economist and director of trade at Sydney's United States Studies Centre points out, when the Reserve Bank pressures the government to ramp up fiscal stimulus and borrow more, this has the effect of appreciating the Australian dollar, which is not good for exports and the economy.\n\nWhen governments borrow by issuing bonds, this creates a capital inflow and foreigners race to get their hands on Australian currency to lend to the government. This appreciates the currency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo big fiscal stimulus through borrowing would hamper the RBA's efforts to get the dollar down, and this is why Lowe has been careful to emphasise the need for productivity reform \u2013 not just marginally more sweet fiscal stimulus.\n\nWith plenty of fear around global markets and the use of quantitative easing, populist left campaigns for such concepts as modern monetary theory are also springing up.\n\nBernie Sanders' senior economic adviser Stephanie Kelton is one of MMT's chief promoters.\n\nThe theory basically puts the workings of central banks into the hands of governments. Governments take over the balance sheets of central banks to kick-start massive stimulus programs that drive much greater employment and fire inflation back up again.\n\nDoing this clearly reduces the independence of central banks.\n\nMorrison hasn't so far made any speeches about how central banks need to change, but he does have control over the mandates of the RBA in an agreement drawn up between the bank and every new government when it comes to power.\n\nWhile MMT is unlikely to come into play anytime soon, it is something that could gain traction with the populist left agenda at organisations such as the International Monetary Fund.\n\nThe IMF hasn't had so much media scrutiny since its former managing director and French Socialist Party member Dominique Strauss-Kahn assaulted a maid in a hotel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut this week the current IMF managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, made headline-grabbing comments to the effect that when countries think about \"what is good for me\" they also need to think about \"what is good for you\".\n\nShe said when it comes to preparing for the possibility of a co-ordinated response to economic troubles people should \"remember the advice of Shakespeare: \u2018Better three hours too soon, than a minute too late\u2019.\u201d\n\nHer quote comes from The Merry Wives of Windsor, in which two elite women embarrass a vain, boastful and financially constrained man named Falstaff.\n\nThe warning here, though, is that if anyone is planning on embarrassing such financially constrained types on the world stage, they \u2013 including the many conservative leaders \u2013 might not prove to be as forgiving as Falstaff.", "description": "From rugby referees to the world's central banks, high-level experts are being blindsided by the trend of recent politics.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4023%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_230%2C$y_247/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/3e95bbf3ff485f116518e5beb56be45fb6d2cf7a", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
