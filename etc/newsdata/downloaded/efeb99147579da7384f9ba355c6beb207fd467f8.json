Photo: Sony Pictures\n\nIf you\u2019re heading off to college this fall, or are the parent of an incoming freshman, you\u2019re probably neck deep in packing lists full of dorm-room staples like twin extra-long sheets and bed risers. While most of the lists you\u2019ll find online or in big-box stores are fairly generic, we were curious about what actual students find most useful, and which things are truly functional on campuses. To find out, we consulted with 13 resident assistants from nine different colleges, who together have looked inside hundreds of dorm rooms. Our seasoned experts are so familiar with outfitting these spaces, they told us, that they\u2019re often the first source students consult when it comes to furnishing their rooms.\n\nInterestingly, one common piece of advice from our RAs is to avoid overpacking. \u201cDon\u2019t buy extra furniture until you\u2019ve seen the room you\u2019re going to be in,\u201d says recent Barnard graduate Alice Min, who was an RA for three years. \u201cOn move-in day, there were so many fed-up parents lugging futons and nightstands home.\u201d Sabrinna Fabi, who graduated from Marymount Manhattan College in May and was an RA there for one year, agrees: \u201cIt\u2019s super important to only bring items you really need to get through the year. Saving space will not only create less roommate problems \u2014 it will also allow you to declutter your life.\u201d For what\u2019s actually essential, read on to discover the space-saving hangers, portable speakers, plush mattress toppers, and more that our panel of RAs recommend.\n\nTo make it even easier, we\u2019ve organized the list into categories. Click here to jump to bedding, storage and organization tools, school supplies, d\u00e9cor, tech and appliances, kitchen supplies, bathroom supplies, or cleaning supplies.\n\nBest Bedding\n\nLucid 3-inch Gel Memory Foam Mattress Topper Twin XL For many college kids in small dorm rooms, the bed is a kind of home base \u2014 not just for sleeping, but for studying, watching Netflix, or hanging out with friends. So it\u2019s not surprising that several of the RAs we spoke with stressed the importance of making sure your bed is comfortable. \u201cThe beds that most colleges provide don\u2019t tend to be that comfortable, so a lot of students buy mattress toppers,\u201d says Justin Feliciano, an RA at the University of Connecticut. Fellow University of Connecticut RA Klajdi Sosoli agrees that a mattress topper is \u201cextremely important,\u201d and recommends this memory-foam option. $75 at Amazon Buy $75 at Amazon Buy\n\nTempur-Pedic TEMPUR-ProForm Supreme 3-Inch Twin XL Mattress Topper $218 (was $299, now 27% off) It\u2019s more expensive than the Lucid mattress topper, but Hannah Maier-Katkin, a former RA at Brown University, says this plush Tempur-Pedic one \u201cwill make your dorm mattress not only tolerable, but genuinely comfortable.\u201d $218 at Amazon Buy $218 at Amazon Buy\n\nPottery Barn Teen Essential Lounge Around Pillow Insert $39 at Pottery Barn Teen Buy\n\nPottery Barn Teen Cozy Lounge Around Pillow Cover $23 (was $50, now 54% off) From $23 at Pottery Barn Teen Buy\n\nSince maximizing your bed\u2019s comfort is a priority, you\u2019ll likely want additional pillows for support. Sarah Rebarber, who\u2019s been an RA for two years at Columbia University, recommends this upright pillow that\u2019s perfect for reading or working on your laptop in bed. The ultrasoft covers come in neutral and pastel shades and are machine washable, making it easy to clean up the occasional spill.\n\nDecroom Memory Fiber Full Body Pillow $30 (was $100, now 70% off) A classic body pillow works, too, especially for getting some much-needed rest. \u201cCollege students love to nap and body pillows are popular because of how comfortable they are,\u201d says Feliciano, who often sees this style in his residents\u2019 rooms. $30 at Amazon Buy $30 at Amazon Buy\n\nThe Northwest Company Officially Licensed NCAA College Label Throw Blanket $36 (was $40, now 10% off) A few RAs talked about students buying blankets for staying cozy, and Feliciano says, \u201cI have seen a lot of students get one with their school logo or mascot.\u201d This plush blanket, which he calls \u201cperfect for my dorm room,\u201d can be ordered in dozens of different school colors. (If you don\u2019t see your school on Amazon, there are many more available here.) $36 at Amazon Buy $36 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest Storage and Organization Tools\n\nRoom Essentials 3pc Y-Weave Medium Value Pack \u201cUnder-the-bed storage is great because it doesn\u2019t take up any space but allows you to utilize what\u2019s already yours,\u201d says Fabi. Since most dorm-room beds are already lofted (or easily can be with a set of bed risers), she thinks stashing bins and boxes under your bed is a helpful way to add more room to a cramped space. Brittany Waugh, an RA at Michigan State University, turns to Target for affordable under-the-bed storage pieces, and Jolene Addi, who\u2019s starting her second semester as an RA at the University of Connecticut, agrees. \u201cThey have a whole brand [Room Essentials] tailored to college dorms,\u201d says Addi. These woven-style bins create less visual clutter than your standard clear plastic ones, and a set of three will only set you back $13. $13 at Target Buy\n\nRoom Essentials 3-Drawer Medium Cart For a workhorse storage piece, Rebarber likes this cart from the Room Essentials line, because it \u201cmoves easily, [isn\u2019t] heavy, and gives you easy access.\u201d Perfect for keeping snacks, school supplies, or accessories like scarves or belts visible and within reach, this piece is a good alternative to the \u201cbig drawers and bulky furniture\u201d often provided by colleges. $10 at Target Buy\n\nLipper International Bamboo Wood Space-Saving Desk Organizer $25 (was $43, now 42% off) Staying organized can be a struggle for lots of students, according to Addi, so she recommends a desk organizer for corralling pens, post-its, and other school supplies. \u201cIt comes in handy because you can keep your most frequently used folders and notebooks accessible, and you can put other notebooks that you open less frequently in your drawers,\u201d she says. With all of your essentials at hand, Addi likes that this wood organizer keeps students from wasting time digging around for what they need. $25 at Amazon Buy $25 at Amazon Buy\n\nSorbus Desk Organizer 5-Piece Set Both Addi and Feliciano say metal desk organizers are popular as well, and this set allows you to configure the pieces in a way that works best for your studying style. $23 at Amazon Buy $23 at Amazon Buy\n\nMoon Phase Metal Over-The-Door Multi-Hook Recent grad Kira Sommer spent two years as an RA at George Washington University, and says one of the best things residents can do to maximize space is use wall hooks for hanging towels, bags, coats, and more. But unlike hooks that stick to, or have to be nailed into, a wall, her preferred over-the-door ones \u201cdon\u2019t leave any marks on walls and won\u2019t get you in trouble with housing at the end of the year.\u201d Sommer adds that this gold-plated one \u201ccan honestly make cute d\u00e9cor.\u201d $39 at Urban Outfitters Buy\n\nStudio 3B 24-Pocket Over-the-Door Shoe Organizer Storing shoes can be tricky, and Rebarber says it\u2019s common for students to leave pairs \u201cscattered on the floor.\u201d As an alternative, she recommends this over-the-door organizer that holds up to 12 pairs of shoes and can be hidden on the inside of a closet door. $15 at Bed Bath & Beyond Buy\n\nA shoe rack like this one used by University of Connecticut RA Samantha (who asked that we not use her last name) is another option for storing your footwear. \u201cI like that it is expandable, so I can make it smaller or larger depending on how I want to store my shoes,\u201d she says. \u201cI also really like that it is easy to take apart and put back together [so] it takes up less space when I am storing it at home over the summer.\u201d She suggests pairing it with a boot tray to keep your floors clean when it\u2019s wet or snowy outside. \u201cLeaving your stuff in the hall is a fire and security hazard, so bringing a boot tray will protect the floors in your room,\u201d she says.\n\nAmazonBasics Velvet Suit Hangers Trying to stuff all of your clothes from home into a small dorm-room closet can be a rude awakening for first-year students. \u201cCollege dorm closets \u2014 if you\u2019re even lucky enough to get a real closet (I only had a rickety wooden wardrobe) \u2014 are tiny,\u201d explains Min. \u201cThese hangers are thinner so you can fit more clothes,\u201d she says, \u201cand an added perk is that the velvet has great grip so your cute sundresses won\u2019t slip off.\u201d While around half of her residents started the year using them, she says that \u201cby the end, everyone was a convert,\u201d and hers lasted all four years of college. $25 at Amazon Buy $25 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest School Supplies\n\nAcademic Passion Planner Medium Aug 2019 - Jul 2020 \u201cI recommend students buy a planner their first year because it\u2019s going to feel like you have a thousand things going on and it\u2019ll make your life easier,\u201d says Feliciano. He adds that it\u2019s best to get in the habit of organizing your time early, before your coursework starts ramping up. Sommer loves this planner because it provides \u201can hourly breakdown of your day,\u201d which is useful for college students who divide their time between classes, extracurricular activities, and part-time jobs. She also appreciates that it has sections for \u201ctasks, lists, plans, and much more than just academics.\u201d $35 at Amazon Buy $35 at Amazon Buy\n\nMoleskine Classic 18 Month 2019-2020 Weekly Planner If you don\u2019t need the hourly breakdown and want more space for note-taking, Min says she \u201creally like the Moleskine weekly ones, and so do most college humanities students.\u201d $17 at Amazon Buy $17 at Amazon Buy\n\nMoleskine Cahier Journal, Soft Cover, Large (5\" x 8.25\") Ruled/Lined (Set of 3) Rebarber is also a fan of Moleskine notebooks, because of their compact size. \u201c[They\u2019re] easier to take notes in due to the tiny desks in lecture halls,\u201d she says. $11 at Amazon Buy $11 at Amazon Buy\n\nPilot G2 Retractable Premium Gel Ink Roller Ball Pen, 12-Count $11 (was $25, now 56% off) Kim Tang, a second-year RA at The College of New Jersey, calls the Pilot G2 \u201cevery college student\u2019s dream pen,\u201d because it\u2019s easy to write with and doesn\u2019t smudge. Available in extra-fine through bold-point sizes, the pen provides an option for everyone\u2019s preferred style. $11 at Amazon Buy $11 at Amazon Buy\n\nPaper Mate Clearpoint Mechanical Pencils with Refills 2-Pack $5 (was $8, now 38% off) When it comes to pencils, Rebarber says \u201cI rarely see people with regular No. 2 pencils \u2014 mostly all mechanical pencils.\u201d She pointed us toward these neon ones with refillable leads and erasers. $5 at Amazon Buy $5 at Amazon Buy\n\nFjallraven Kanken Mini Three RAs \u2014 Reabrber, Tang, and Min \u2014 say the Fjallraven Kanken is one of the most popular backpacks on college campuses. It\u2019s the perfect size for toting to class, the dining hall, or the library. Min says it\u2019s \u201csmaller but cuter,\u201d than the backpack she had in high school, and she still uses it today. $70 at Zappos Buy\n\nHerschel Supply Co. Little America Mid-Volume Backpack $88 (was $100, now 12% off) Another campus staple, this Herschel Supply Co. backpack is a top pick for both Rebarber and Min, who says it has a \u201cmore professional\u201d look, and thus is popular among students going between classes and jobs or internships. $88 at Zappos Buy\n\nL.L.Bean Mountain Classic Cordura Pack A more heavy-duty option, this nice-looking, color-blocked bag comes recommended by Sommer, who calls it \u201ca solid, reliable backpack that can withstand heavy books and a laptop.\u201d It\u2019s ideal for busy days when you\u2019ll be away from your dorm and need to tote your essentials for different classes and activities. \u201cIt\u2019s worth the money and will last you for years,\u201d she says. $89 at L.L.Bean Buy\n\nBest D\u00e9cor\n\nAnjaylia LED Fairy String Lights Nearly all the RAs we spoke with mentioned string lights as a way to improve a dorm room\u2019s aesthetic. \u201cThey add good, soft lighting, compared to the harsh overhead ones, and are generally very pretty,\u201d says Tang. Abby Wolfe, a former RA at Colgate University, calls these battery-operated LED lights \u201cdainty and lightweight.\u201d Unlike traditional, electric Christmas-style lights, they\u2019re not a fire hazard so they\u2019re generally allowed by more colleges. $8 at Amazon Buy $8 at Amazon Buy\n\nUmbra Hangit Photo Display $16 (was $20, now 20% off) \u201cPeople love to hang photos of friends, family, and pets,\u201d says Rebarber, and Min thinks it\u2019s especially popular among first-year students feeling homesick. \u201cBefore I left for college, I got together with my high-school friends and we printed out a ton of photos and made goodbye collages,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was an uplifting reminder of home whenever I felt down, and it was a pretty good conversation starter for any new college friends that saw it in my room.\u201d To make your own, Rebarber likes this hanging frame that lets you easily switch up your photos on little wooden clothespins. $16 at Amazon Buy $16 at Amazon Buy\n\nVIPMOON LED Photo Clip Remote String Lights $12 (was $20, now 40% off) This set, also recommended by Rebarber, lets you combine your photos with your string lights. She particularly likes it for its \u201ctwinkly\u201d lights. $12 at Amazon Buy $12 at Amazon Buy\n\nRoom Essentials Over-the-Door Mirror Like wall hooks and over-the-door shoe holders, this mirror is a dorm-room essential because it doesn\u2019t take up any floor space. It\u2019s the most common style Tang sees among her residents, and she thinks it\u2019s a smart buy since most rooms don\u2019t come with full-length mirrors. \u201cKnowing how you look is something people take for granted,\u201d she says, and some students don\u2019t realize they need a mirror until they see their dorm for the first time. $15 at Target Buy\n\nThe Succulent Cult Live Succulent Plants Fully Rooted in Planter Pots with Soil (5 Pack) Hardy succulents offer a way for students to bring some plant life into their dorm without having to worry too much about care. \u201cLots of people have started to keep succulents in their dorm rooms because they are easy to maintain,\u201d says Rebarber. Wolfe recommends scattering a few mini-plants around your room to add \u201ca fresh, homey vibe, without consuming too much space.\u201d $16 at Amazon Buy $16 at Amazon Buy\n\nU Brands Contempo Magnetic Dry Erase Board $7 (was $8, now 13% off) Rebarber says her residents will usually have dry-erase boards on their walls or doors, and this affordable one is a favorite of both Feliciano and Tang. \u201cI see these on my residents\u2019 doors all the time,\u201d says Tang. Feliciano says they\u2019re useful for floormates to share messages with each other, or even just their social-media handles. They\u2019re mounted with Velcro strips, which Tang says makes them easy to set up and take down without damaging your wall. $7 at Amazon Buy $7 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest Tech and Appliances\n\nApple AirPods with Charging Case $170 (was $199, now 15% off) \u201cPlease, please, please invest in a good pair of headphones,\u201d implores Sommer, who says residents listening to music or playing video games with the sound blasting can be a big problem in shared spaces. \u201cYour roommates will thank you and in turn your RA will thank you.\u201d Tang says AirPods are currently the pair of choice among students, and Rebarber notices the same at her school, saying that since they\u2019re wireless and Bluetooth-enabled, they\u2019re \u201cgreat for exercising and studying.\u201d $170 at Amazon Buy $170 at Amazon Buy\n\nApple Macbook Pro 13-Inch $1,223 (was $1,299, now 6% off) Most students also opt for Apple laptops because, as Tang says, \u201cthey\u2019re reliable and IT at schools know how they work.\u201d Rebarber agrees that \u201ceveryone has a Mac,\u201d and says, \u201cyour life is so much harder if you have a different type of computer because if you need a charger almost everyone has the same one.\u201d Your computer will likely be your main source of entertainment because, as Rebarber says, these days, \u201cno one really brings a TV or watches TV on [an actual] TV.\u201d $1,223 at Amazon Buy $1,223 at Amazon Buy\n\nIn addition to, or instead of, a laptop, you might want an iPad, which RAs say are quickly becoming more common in college classrooms. \u201cMore and more people now take notes on their laptops or on their iPads with the Apple Pencil,\u201d says Rebarber. Sosoli agrees that they\u2019re \u201cvery popular and easy to take notes [on].\u201d\n\nUltimate Ears Wonderboom Portable Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker Maier-Katkin says this \u201clight and transportable\u201d speaker makes it easy to take your music out onto the quad if you\u2019re hanging out with friends, and can \u201ctransform your dorm room into a comfy pre-game or party room.\u201d It\u2019s waterproof, too, in case you want to bring it into the bathroom with you while you shower, which Feliciano says students often do. $75 at Amazon Buy $75 at Amazon Buy\n\nMainstays Metal Gooseneck Desk Lamp Samantha has and loves this simple desk lamp. \u201cA lot of other residents have similar lamps, and I believe that\u2019s because it\u2019s an affordable and durable option,\u201d she says. You can also use it as a bedside reading lamp, which Fabi recommends for keeping the peace between roommates. \u201cMore often than not, roommates won\u2019t have the same sleeping habits or even study habits,\u201d she says. \u201cA bedside lamp is really great if your roommate goes to sleep early and wants all the lights out, but you\u2019re a night owl and study late.\u201d $10 at Walmart Buy\n\nWest Elm Cylinder Wireless Charging + USB Task Lamp With both a charging pad for wireless charging and a USB port for plugging in your phone, this lamp is one of Maier-Katkin\u2019s space-saving favorites. \u201cYou\u2019ll want the extra lighting and you\u2019ll likely barely have enough charging outlets in your dorm, so it\u2019s an ideal combo,\u201d she says. It is pricey, but the white lacquer lamp is sophisticated enough to transition to a desk or nightstand in your first apartment. $199 at West Elm Buy\n\nTW Lighting The Ivy LED Desk Lamp with USB Port Here\u2019s a less expensive option, chosen by Feliciano, that takes up minimal space on your desk and features a charging port. $17 at Amazon Buy $17 at Amazon Buy\n\nVornado VFAN Mini Classic Personal Vintage Air Circulator Fan Rebarber says a fan is \u201ca must, especially for those without AC in the beginning and end of the semester.\u201d Yiyun Wang, currently an RA at Barnard, says Vornado fans are very popular in dorm rooms, and this one \u2014 which we\u2019ve written about before \u2014 would look cute on your desk or dresser. She adds, \u201cif you put frozen bottles of water in front of the fans, the air also comes out cooler.\u201d $40 at Amazon Buy $40 at Amazon Buy\n\nLasko 20-inch Power Plus Box Fan If you want a fan with some more oomph, Feliciano suggests this larger box-style one that should fit in the window of most dorm rooms and provides much-needed relief from heat and humidity at the start of the school year. When we asked hardware store owners to recommend the best window fans, lots of them also chose Lasko models. $30 at Walmart Buy\n\nComfort Zone Oscillating Tower Heater/Fan If you go to school in a colder climate, you might want to invest in a fan-heater combo like this one suggested by Rebarber. She says that it\u2019s not unusual for heaters to break down in older dorm buildings, so students often rely on space heaters in the winter. $50 at Bed Bath & Beyond Buy\n\nBest Kitchen Supplies\n\nOvente BPA-Free Electric Kettle 1.7 Liter with Auto Shut-Off and Boil-Dry Protection While many students \u2014 and most freshman \u2014 will likely eat meals in a dining hall, our RAs recommended keeping some personal kitchen supplies in your dorm room that can help hold you over in between classes or meals. Both Rebarber and Sommer say an electric kettle is not just useful for tea or coffee, but can help make your room a social hub. \u201cMy roommate had one freshman year and would use it to make tea, which was a great way for us to bond with our new hallmates,\u201d says Sommer. She went on to buy her own to make hot chocolate once a week for her residents. Rebarber likes that this one shuts off automatically once the water boils and \u201cmakes it so easy to make coffee or oatmeal in the comfort of your dorm room.\u201d Some schools don\u2019t allow electric kettles in dorms, though, so make sure to check before buying. $14 at Amazon Buy $14 at Amazon Buy\n\nIkea Dinera Mug You likely won\u2019t need a full set of dishes for your dorm room, but RAs think it\u2019s a good idea to start with at least one mug. \u201cMugs were probably the dishes I used the most in college,\u201d says Sommer. Rebarber agrees that while bowls and plates aren\u2019t necessary, \u201ceveryone has a mug.\u201d She says, \u201cI have seen people use mugs for making cakes in the microwave, bringing coffee to class, or sipping on tea late at night.\u201d Wang likes IKEA mugs, and this one is so affordable that you can get a matching one for your roommate. $2 at Ikea Buy\n\nFrigidaire 3.1 Cu. Ft. Mini Fridge You can find a smaller mini-fridge, but according to Wolfe and Feliciano, a 3.1 cubic-foot fridge with a built-in freezer is ideal for most dorm rooms, hitting the sweet spot of compact size with generous capacity. \u201cHaving a slightly larger fridge can come in handy,\u201d says Wolfe. \u201cIt is a bit of a hassle come move-in day, but can function as a side table of sorts, and having a separate freezer is unbeatable for late nights studying, when ice cream is the snack of choice.\u201d She adds that she used her Frigidaire all four years of college, making it worth the investment. $199 at Amazon Buy $199 at Amazon Buy\n\nWhirlpool 3.1 cu ft Mini Refrigerator Stainless Steel $140 (was $180, now 22% off) For an identically sized fridge at a slightly lower price point, Feliciano likes this Whirlpool style because \u201cthere is a freezer component, storage drawers for produce and dairy, and an adjustable knob to change how cold the fridge gets.\u201d He says it\u2019s lasted him three years so far and is still in great condition. $140 at Target Buy\n\nS'well Vacuum Insulated Stainless Steel Water Bottle, 17 oz $28 (was $35, now 20% off) To stay hydrated \u2014 and be environmentally friendly \u2014 RAs say reusable water bottles are a campus necessity. Rebarber says S\u2019Well bottles are popular among students, and Samantha says kids like them because \u201cthey come in so many different colors and patterns [so] they\u2019re an interesting conversation starter and way to express yourself.\u201d Since they\u2019re vacuum-sealed and insulated, Wang says S\u2019Well bottles are ideal \u201cif you like really hot or cold stuff,\u201d and Tang adds that S\u2019Well fans like that the bottle is \u201csmall enough to fit in a bag without being heavy.\u201d $28 at Amazon Buy $28 at Amazon Buy\n\nHydro Flask 18 oz. Wide Water Bottle Rebarber says Hydro Flask bottles are popular as well, and Feliciano likes that they \u201ckeep drinks cold, are durable, and come with a lifetime warranty.\u201d Tang has also noticed more and more Hydro Flask bottles around campus. \u201cPeople like them because they can hold more water than [S\u2019well], and also they\u2019re just trendy now,\u201d she says. $30 at Amazon Buy $30 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest Bathroom Supplies\n\nMesh Shower Tote For storing everything from shampoo and conditioner to toothpaste and face wash, RAs say a shower caddy is essential for trips to a communal bathroom. This multi-compartment, mesh tote is a top pick for Feliciano, Addi, and Maier-Katkin. Addi says she prefers this style to a plastic caddy because it has a compartment for everything (including your cell phone), dries fast, and won\u2019t start to smell if water lingers on it. Plus, you can hang it up in the shower to keep it off the floor. $10 at Bed Bath & Beyond Buy\n\nMost RAs recommend wearing flip-flops in the dorms\u2019 shared showers to keep your bare feet off the germy floors. Tang says she and most of her residents opt for these cheap ones from Old Navy, often picking up more than one pair at a time because, as she says, \u201cthey can get gross.\u201d Feliciano agrees that the Old Navy sandals are \u201ccomfortable, cheap, and long lasting, [and] can help prevent a student from acquiring things like a fungal infection.\u201d\n\nShevalues Shower Sandal Slippers If you\u2019re looking for something sturdier that will better protect your feet from the gunk in a communal shower, Min likes these slide sandals, which she prefers to standard flip-flops. \u201cThey drain well and the soles are thicker than the usual flip flop, so your feet never accidentally touch a stray hair ball,\u201d she says. \u201cI had a lot of people ask me where I got them.\u201d (The answer to that question, she told us, was while visiting her grandma in China.) From $12 at Amazon Buy From $12 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest Cleaning Supplies\n\nSimple Houseware Foldable Laundry Hamper Basket with Lid Instead of a flimsy bag for laundry, the RAs we spoke with suggested going with a sturdier hamper, because you\u2019ll want something that\u2019ll be able to hold a heavy load without ripping and withstand a trip to the laundry room. \u201cIf you get lazy and don\u2019t do laundry for a week, you don\u2019t want it ripping,\u201d says Addi, who recommends a durable, stand-up style. Feliciano agrees, saying to look for one with handles \u201cbecause you will need to carry your dirty clothes from your dorm room to the laundry room.\u201d $18 at Amazon Buy $18 at Amazon Buy\n\nBissell Featherweight Stick Lightweight Bagless Vacuum Wolfe says it\u2019s a good idea to have a vacuum in your room to \u201ctidy up snack crumbs, paper bits, or dirt and mud from shoes.\u201d Addi, who told us that residents frequently ask to borrow her vacuum, agrees it\u2019s useful to have your own. Tang calls this bagless model \u201cthe vacuum\u201d for college students since it\u2019s cheap and lightweight. \u201cIf you have a rug or your dorm is carpeted, it\u2019s useful to vacuum here and there,\u201d she says. \u201cOtherwise your room gets super gross superfast.\u201d $30 at Amazon Buy $30 at Amazon Buy\n\nLysol Disinfecting Wipes, Lemon & Lime Blossom $12 (was $13, now 8% off) For quick cleanups, Addi and Sosoli advise keeping cleaning wipes on hand. As Wolfe says, \u201cdisinfectant wipes can be used to tackle any mess, from a coffee spill to dust bunnies, but they are also a must during flu season, [as] germs spread like crazy on campus.\u201d $12 for 4 at Amazon Buy $12 for 4 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
