If racism persists, the referee should take the players off and if necessary would abandon the game.\n\nSouthgate said: \u2018We\u2019re very clear. It was a little less clear to me in Montenegro and the incident happened so late in the game. But we\u2019ve seen in the last few weeks a couple of games have been stopped in Italy, where the referee stopped the game and made an announcement to the crowd, a warning to the crowd.\n\n\u2018The next stage of that would be the game stops, the referee takes the players off the pitch and the third step would be an abandonment of the game. That is the process. So we are very clear to all of our staff and we discuss what needs to happen, what that procedure needs to look like.\n\n\u2018We think it\u2019s important to pick that up with the players because we haven\u2019t done that post Montenegro, because we had two home games last time. So we didn\u2019t think it was relevant to them but we think it\u2019s now a good moment to do that. \u2018It will be in the early part of the week [when they speak to the players] \u2014 as far away from the game as possible and it will be dealt with calmly.\n\n\u2018I know our guys really want to focus on the football and they want the stories to be about the football. That is their desire but this is clearly a serious topic, so we\u2019ve got to make sure that we are giving it the respect it deserves.\n\n\u2018In Montenegro, a couple of the players were aware of something in the first half, lots of the others weren\u2019t. Even at the end of the game, I was very aware of what happened but there were some other people that were on the bench that didn\u2019t even hear it, so that is probably the difficulty of the situation that night.\n\n\u2018We all hope that we\u2019re not discussing this at the end of the game. And it\u2019s important that our players have been prepared if it were to happen.\u2019\n\nThe games will also be the first chance to judge England fans\u2019 conduct after widespread disorder and anti-social behaviour at the UEFA Nations League in Portugal last summer. About 3,000 England fans are expected at each game.", "description": "Gareth Southgate will sit down with his England players this week to discuss their strategy against racism, which could result in the team leaving the pitch if players are racially abused.", "authors": ["Rob Draper For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/22/19343458-0-image-a-117_1570310182078.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
