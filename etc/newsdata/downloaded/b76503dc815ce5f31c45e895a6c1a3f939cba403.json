Given the shake up at the top, reports of job losses- it might be fair to assume some difficult quarterly results.'", "description": "Any job cuts implemented in this new round would come on top of the redundancies announced by the bank earlier in the year, when it said it will be laying off about 4,000 people.", "authors": ["This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
