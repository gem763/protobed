Be it losing or gaining weight for a film or just the make up that sometimes takes several hours, actors have to go through a lot to get into the skin of their characters.\n\nBut one astonishing fact that is bound to surprise you is that Joaquin Phoenix's transformation into the Joker took just 15 minutes.\n\nYes, we are not kidding. Makeup artist Nicki Ledermann revealed in an interview that the 44-year-old actor (Joaquin Phoenix) could not sit for a long time at a stretch.\n\nDon't Miss 402 SHARES 8.9 K SHARES 5 K SHARES 24.7 K SHARES 33.6 K SHARES\n\nTalking to Dazed beauty, he said, \"It took an average of 15-20 minutes to apply the makeup. Partly because it was hard for Joaquin to sit still but also because I didn't want it to look too precisely thought out.\"\n\nThis habit of not being able to sit still for long also means that Joaquin's transformation to Joker is by far the fastest Joker transformation, beating Heath Ledger and Jared Leto's time. Reports claim that Heath's makeup would take an hour maximum, and Jared Leto's would stretch for over three hours.\n\nLedger's makeup artist John Caligone Jr. spoke to The Hollywood Reporter in 2016 and revealed that he was not just \"amazing\", but he was also collaborative during filming for \"The Dark Knight.\" He was quoted as saying,\n\n\"Heath would contort his face while I was laying makeup on it so it would look like it was lived in. It created cracks and crevices. It was kind of like a dance in the makeup chair.\"\n\nAnother drastic transformation which is Leto's in \"Suicide Squad\" has been touted as more extensive and in-depth. His makeup routine included six or seven layers and took three hours to finish. His artist Alessandro Bertolazzi revealed in an interview to The Hollywood Reporter that Leto was \"completely in connection with me.\" He was quoted in the report as saying,\n\n\"Jared was amazing. We had a special makeup department only for Jared. When he arrived in the morning, he'd come straight to the makeup department.\"\n\nWell, in case you're gearing up for Halloween and want some Joker-worthy transformation, artist Lederman has some tips for you. She added, \"The main products I used for the Joker and all the clowns were the MAC Chromacakes in Cyan, Pure White, Basic Red, Landscape Green, and Black Black.\"\n\nYes, you can thank her later!", "description": "The transformation that actors often go through for their roles is praiseworthy.
