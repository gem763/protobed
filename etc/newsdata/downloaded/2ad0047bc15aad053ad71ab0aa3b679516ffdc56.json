The identical twins never spent more than 12 hours apart, before the man sitting feet from her strangled Jholie last year.\n\nZhane had already explained at the sentencing hearing how Jholie, 16, had been in love with her first boyfriend, Nebiyu Ebrahim, then 17, before he grew abusive. It culminated on Jan. 12, 2018, when he choked her until she grew limp, then choked her twice more. He hid her body in a park.\n\nZhane began reading from her cellphone, compressing her anger, grief and loss into a handful of lines. She used her final words to wrest back control of the tragedy from her sister\u2019s killer, who pleaded guilty to first-degree murder in June.\n\n\u201cAt one point, I felt like you ruined my life, but I\u2019m not giving you the power anymore,\u201d Zhane read calmly. \u201c\u2019Cause no one in this situation has to suffer but you. You think you won by ending my sister\u2019s life, but you are in for a rude awakening.\u201d\n\nThat moment probably came sooner than anyone anticipated as Circuit Court Judge Randy I. Bellows issued a rare life sentence for a juvenile offender, imposing the maximum sentence on Ebrahim, now 19. Jholie\u2019s family members, many of whom wore \u201c#justice4Jholie\u201d T-shirts, burst into applause in the courtroom.\n\nSyreeta Steward, Jholie\u2019s mother, said afterward that the sentence was as \u201cgood as it\u2019s going to get\u201d but that it did not erase the loss she had said in earlier testimony \u201crocked our family to the core.\u201d\n\n\n\nJholie Moussa was killed by her onetime boyfriend, who was given a life sentence on Wednesday. (FBI)\n\n[Man pleads guilty to murder in strangulation death of girl, 16]\n\nJholie was braiding her sister\u2019s hair on the afternoon of Jan. 12, 2018, when she suddenly told Zhane she needed to leave their Mount Vernon-area home, Zhane testified. Jholie vanished, sparking an extensive search that went viral online and generated help from hundreds of volunteers.\n\nFamily members\u2019 suspicions immediately turned to Ebrahim, whom Jholie had met at Mount Vernon High School. He was a stellar student who had been accepted to multiple colleges and played basketball, but he had anger issues.\n\nIn September 2017, he assaulted Jholie, an incident that led to his removal from Mount Vernon High School. Ebrahim then blamed Jholie for his landing in a school for troubled teens. Prosecutors said that anger grew into hatred.\n\nZhane testified that roughly a month before her sister\u2019s slaying, Jholie told her that Ebrahim had choked her into unconsciousness.\n\n\u201cShe said she knows how death feels,\u201d Zhane said Jholie had told her of the choking incident. \u201cShe remembered it so vividly.\u201d\n\nJholie told her twin she would cut off contact with Ebrahim, but she never did.\n\nProsecutors said Ebrahim thought at the time that he had killed Jholie and even texted a friend to say that he needed to find a place to hide. The incident was never reported to police. Chief Deputy Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney Casey Lingan told the judge that Ebrahim could have stayed away from Jholie after that burst of violence but didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cHe has a second chance after the first choking,\u201d Lingan said. \u201cThis is the fork in the road where he tells us who he is.\u201d\n\nOn the day of the slaying, Jholie met Ebrahim at a park near her home, where they argued about his placement at Bryant High School, an alternative school. Ebrahim put Jholie in what he would tell detectives was an \u201cMMA-style chokehold\u201d until she passed out.\n\nHe lowered her body to the ground and then choked her again for nearly a minute with both hands. He then propped her body up and choked her a third time for another three to five minutes, until his hands grew tired and he stopped.\n\nEbrahim covered Jholie\u2019s body in some leaves. In the days that followed, he would return with a butcher knife and scratch out a shallow grave. By then, the search was well underway.\n\nOn the night of the slaying, to buy some time, Ebrahim texted Zhane from Jholie\u2019s phone, writing as Jholie, to say she was headed to a party in Norfolk. He initially told police that he had not talked with Jholie, before eventually admitting that he killed her. Jholie\u2019s body was found in the park two weeks after her slaying.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Ebrahim told Jholie\u2019s family before he was sentenced. \u201cI apologize for not treating your daughter with the utmost respect.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nFound insane in one killing, police say D.C. man killed again\n\nA teen was killed because man thought he was a gang member using black magic to control a girl, detective testifies\n\nTour bus driver pleads guilty in December crash that killed two tourists\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Zhane Moussa, 18, had a message for the man who took Jholie Moussa\u2019s life.", "authors": ["Justin Jouvenal", "Reporter Covering Courts", "Policing", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/aRszZtN7evVflh-XRsBZVG9He6E=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/A3IA2DFMVMI6RGT5ZUYFAT7ZAI.jpg"}
