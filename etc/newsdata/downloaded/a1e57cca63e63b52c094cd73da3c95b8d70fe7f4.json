These ideas can help you stay on top of your mental health.'\n\nThe campaign has started offering tailored 'mind plans' based on an online five-question quiz\n\nEvery Mind Matters is backed by a coalition of mental health charities and groups including, including Mind, Samaritans and the Royal College of GPs (the logo is pictured)\n\nSeveral ideas ranging from keeping fit to trying a new hobby will appear, with the option to swap this suggestion if it's 'not for you'.\n\nIn addition, separate advice based on your response to the fifth question will also be offered.\n\nFor example, if you were to select 'relationships' as the cause of your worries, it would provide a link to a separate page focusing on dealing with bereavement and loneliness.\n\nHealth and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock hailed the dedication and 'bravery' of the Royals for throwing their weight behind the campaign.\n\nFrom today, millions of Britons can use the Every Mind Matters website to receive a tailored 'action plan' containing clinically-proven steps to improve their mental health.
