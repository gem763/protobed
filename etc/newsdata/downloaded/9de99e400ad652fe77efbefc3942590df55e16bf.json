The task force presented a series of recommendations last year, including an avenue to involve citizens in oversight of the Police Department and recommendations to diversify the police force.\n\nThe City Council in September authorized several of the task force recommendations, including a police monitor position, a police cadet program and the creation of a diversity and inclusion program.\n\nMs. Jefferson was killed weeks after the sentencing of Amber R. Guyger, a white former Dallas police officer who shot her unarmed black neighbor in his apartment last year and was sentenced to 10 years in prison this month. The case was one of a handful of police shootings to go to trial in the Dallas-Fort Worth area in recent years. In another case, a police officer shot an unarmed black 15-year-old as he sat in the passenger seat of a car; the officer was sentenced to 15 years in prison last year.\n\n\u201cBetween these shootings and the trials of all of these different things, we literally have not had a chance to recover,\u201d said Omar Suleiman, an imam and activist in the Dallas area. \u201cThere is just this deep anger and hurt in the streets that you can\u2019t be safe in your apartment, you can\u2019t be safe in your home, you can\u2019t be safe in your car.\u201d\n\nChief Kraus said he regretted that the Police Department had released photographs of a gun found on the floor below the window in Ms. Jefferson\u2019s bedroom after she was killed \u2014 though he declined to say if she was holding it, or if the officer saw it before he shot her.\n\nShe had every right to have a gun in her bedroom, the chief said. \u201cWe\u2019re homeowners in the state of Texas,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine most of us \u2014 if we thought we had somebody outside our house that shouldn\u2019t be and we had access to a firearm \u2014 that we wouldn\u2019t act very similarly to how she acted.\u201d\n\nFort Worth is at least a 30-minute drive from Dallas and very much its own community, with its own local politics, cultural identity and history of relations with the police. But the two cities \u2014 flashy Dallas and down-home Fort Worth \u2014 are the anchors of a sprawling metroplex, where people commute from the smaller suburbs for work and meet in the middle for Dallas Cowboys games.", "description": "Aaron Dean, the officer who killed Atatiana Jefferson as she was playing a video game with her nephew, resigned hours before he was going to be fired.", "authors": ["Marina Trahan Martinez", "Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs", "Sarah Mervosh"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/14/us/14FORTHWORT-jefferson/merlin_162675498_03a9abdb-352f-46a9-9131-01518bf1a148-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
