A Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) spokesperson declined to comment on a timeline.\n\nAfter ditching a proposed merger with Renault (RENA.PA) in June, FCA Chairman John Elkann confirmed the group\u2019s bid to pursue an alternative alliance as carmakers face huge investments in electrification, emission reduction and autonomous driving technologies.\n\nMilan-listed shares in FCA rallied more the 10% on Wednesday, after ending up more than 7.5% on Tuesday in New York. Peugeot share rose more than 6% to hit their highest in more than 11 years.\n\nEven if a combination of PSA and FCA succeeds in overcoming political, financial and governance hurdles, the new enterprise would still face substantial challenges.\n\nThe deal is being put together as automakers face a global downturn in demand at a time when the cost of investments into low-emission technologies are rising as deadlines to meet ever more stringent anti-pollution rules loom.\n\nMorningstar senior equity analyst Richard Hilgert said in a note that total volumes of FCA and PSA, including China joint venture partners, amounted to 8.7 million vehicles last year, ranking the eventual combined group fourth behind Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), Toyota (7203.T) and the Renault/Nissan Alliance (7201.T), each at more than 10 million vehicles.\n\n\u201cWe view the combination of these two companies as reasonable given global competition, high capital intensity, and industry disruption from electrified powertrain as well as autonomous technologies,\u201d Hilgert said.\n\nFrance is closely monitoring the merger discussions, with special attention given to governance matters, a French finance ministry source told Reuters on Wednesday. Paris has a 12% stake in PSA through state bank BPI.\n\nItaly\u2019s Industry Minister Stefano Patuanelli said on Wednesday that Rome - which has no stake in FCA - was following talks between the two groups but declined to comment further on a \u201cmarket operation\u201d.\n\nRome is keen to avoid major job losses in Italy, where 58,000 workers are employed by FCA, and with most of its Italian plants heavily underused.\n\nClosing factories is politically problematic, but carmakers can glean savings by combining vehicle platforms and plants, pooling research and development efforts and increasing economies of scale in procurement.\n\nEMISSIONS CRUNCH\n\nThe talks come as European carmakers struggle to meet tough carbon dioxide emissions targets.\n\nStrategy firm PA Consulting has forecast FCA faces a fine of 700 million euros ($777 million) unless it radically changes its emissions profile to sell more electric and hybrid cars.\n\nFCA, which lacks adequate green technology, has agreed to pay Tesla hundreds of millions of euros to pool emissions credits in an effort to escape penalties.\n\nIt has also announced a 5-billion-euro investment plan in Italy to 2021, to help the group launch its first electric and hybrid models, revamp luxury brand Maserati and fill capacity at its Italian plants.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Carlos Tavares, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Managing Board of PSA Group, attends a news conference to announce the company's 2018 results at their headquarters in Rueil-Malmaison, near Paris, France, February 26, 2019.

FCA said in its statement it had nothing more to add for the time being.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The logo of Fiat carmaker is seen in Nice, France, June 3, 2019.
