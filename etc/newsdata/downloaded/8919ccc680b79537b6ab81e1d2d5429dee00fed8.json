That\u2019s because this letter wasn\u2019t fully written by lawyers.\n\nIt was crafted, in large part, by President Donald Trump himself.\n\nAccording to two people familiar with the process, White House Counsel Pat Cipollone had multiple meetings with President Trump in the days leading up to the issuance of the letter. During those meetings with Cipollone, the president would get especially animated when names such as Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), chair of the House Intelligence Committee leading the probe into the whistleblower complaint, came up. The sources said that Trump enthusiastically suggested adding various jabs at Democratic lawmakers and would request that their \u201cunfair\u201d treatment of him be incorporated into the letter.", "description": "", "authors": ["Suebsaeng", "Thedailybeast.Com Trumps-Favorite-Impeachment-Lawyer-Is-Trump-Himself"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
