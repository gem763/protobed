REUTERS/Mike Segar/Files\n\n(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) beat Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit by a wide margin on Tuesday, underpinned by strength in bond trading, underwriting and home lending revenue.\n\nThe bank\u2019s quarterly reports are closely watched for signs about the health of U.S. consumers and businesses as it is a major residential and commercial lender as well as an asset manager.\n\nRevenue at three of the bank\u2019s four main businesses rose. The only business to report a fall was commercial banking, where lower interest rates hampered results.\n\n\"The consumer remains healthy with growth in wages and spending, combined with strong balance sheets and low unemployment levels,\" Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said in a statement.
