REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\n\nUber Technologies Inc\u2019s move to lock out drivers at times and in areas of low demand comes just months after rival Lyft Inc implemented similar measures in response to city regulation.\n\nBoth companies oppose the unprecedented rules, saying they will prevent drivers from earning money and cut off low-income New Yorkers in remote areas not serviced by regular taxis, a claim the city rejects.\n\n\u201cTime and again we\u2019ve seen Mayor (Bill) de Blasio\u2019s TLC pass arbitrary and politically-driven rules that have unintended consequences for drivers and riders,\u201d Uber said in a statement on Monday.\n\nNew York City\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) last year implemented several laws challenging the way ride-share companies operate in North America\u2019s largest city, one of the industry\u2019s largest markets.\n\nThe agency\u2019s acting commissioner, Bill Heinzen, in a statement on Monday defended the laws, saying they held companies accountable and prevented Uber and Lyft from oversaturating the market at drivers\u2019 expense.\n\nNew rules cap the number of app-based, for-hire cars and established minimum pay for the city\u2019s 80,000 ride-share drivers based on how much time they spend transporting passengers.\n\nThe laws also limit the time drivers spend \u201ccruising\u201d - driving to or waiting to pick up new passengers. Starting in February, ride-share companies have to reduce cruising rates by 5% and later by 10%, down from currently 41%. Non-compliance can result in fines or even the inability to operate in the city.\n\nThe rules are aimed at reducing congestion in Manhattan, where ride-share vehicles make up close to a third of peak time traffic, according to the TLC.\n\nUber said there was no evidence showing the steps would ease congestion. The company supported a $2.75 congestion surcharge implemented for Manhattan ride-share trips earlier this year.\n\nLyft in June changed its app to lock out drivers during low demand. The company said it supports drivers during the change, for example by showing them areas with high demand or times during which restrictions are lifted.\n\nThe New York Taxi Workers Alliance, a union representing taxi and app-based drivers, said the companies were trying to scare drivers.\n\n\u201cUber is now spreading fear and disinformation to New York drivers, attempting to convince workers that rules protecting their livelihoods are to blame for Uber\u2019s greedy policies,\u201d the union said in a statement.", "description": "Uber on Tuesday will begin limiting drivers' access to its app in New York City to comply with regulation aimed at boosting drivers' pay and easing congestion in Manhattan, laws that Uber says will have unintended consequences.", "authors": ["Tina Bellon", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430595028&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F1OF", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
