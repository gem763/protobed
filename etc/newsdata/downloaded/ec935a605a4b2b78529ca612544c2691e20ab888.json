Debunked: Moon landing conspiracy theories 1/8 Flag waves but there is no wind on the moon The theory goes that as the flag is waving in the wind, it must have been on earth as there is no wind on the moon. If it were on the moon it would simply droop. The truth is that it is not waving, rather it is being held in place by a telescopic pole running through the top of the flag and it is crumpled as it had been screwed up for days en route to the moon Nasa 2/8 Boot doesn't match the boot print It is suggested that this picture of a boot print on the moon is fake because it does not line up with the tread of this boot from Neil Armstrong\u2019s spacesuit. That\u2019s right, it doesn\u2019t NASA 3/8 Boot doesn\u2019t match the boot print The print does however match that of the outer boots, the ones worn by the Apollo crew when walking on the moon. And while we\u2019re at it: the print is from Buzz Aldrin, not Armstrong. NASA 4/8 No stars in outer space? Why are there no stars in sight when this picture was taken on a rock in outer space that has no atmosphere? Answer: camera settings. In order to capture this photo in direct sunlight, the camera would have to have a very narrow aperture and the shutter would only stay open for a minuscule amount of time. This means that the camera will not take in the light of the distant stars, only that of the much nearer, brighter sun. NASA 5/8 Astronauts couldn\u2019t survive the radiation belts The Van Allen belts are regions of extremely high energy charged particles are trapped in the earth\u2019s magnetic field.

If you\u2019ve ever done firewalking, you\u2019ll know the one thing you don\u2019t do is linger around in the middle of the firepit. You cross as quickly as you can... as long as you walk across quite quickly, looking at the thermal conductivity of your feet, you are not going to have enough thermal energy going into the soles of your feet to burn you. You\u2019re absolutely fine. Just don\u2019t hang around in the middle! In a similar way, the transit time through the Van Allen radiation belt right at the beginning of the Apollo voyages was incredibly short.

NASA\n\nInfowars did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The first video uploaded to the channel was available for about 17 hours, according to Vice, which first reported the news.\n\nThirteen videos were uploaded before the channel was removed. Vice said one of the videos was titled, \"Breaking! YouTube CEO says 'Alex Jones' and 'Infowars Ban Is Over'.\" Ms Wojcicki's letter did not mention Infowars or Jones.\n\nIn a statement, YouTube spokeswoman Ivy Choi said the company is \"committed to preserving openness and balancing it with our responsibility to protect our community\".\n\nShe added that YouTube removed the War Room channel for violating its terms of service, but did not expand on why the channel had been permitted to relaunch, or what specifically led to its removal Thursday.\n\nSocial media companies in recent years have struggled to balance free speech with policing hate, violent crimes and other problematic content which show up on their sites. They have introduced new rules and banned a number of controversial figures from their platforms.\n\nThey have also hired thousands of contractors around the world to review and delete violent or offensive content, something that introduces its own problems, including the psychological toll on the contractors.\n\nStill, policy violating content gets through, illustrated recently by grisly video recorded by the alleged perpetrator of March's bloody massacres at two New Zealand mosques, which was published on YouTube and other social media platforms.\n\nGoogle-owned YouTube, the world's largest video platform with nearly two billion people logging in monthly, in particular has faced fierce backlash from critics who say it is enabling hateful and inappropriate content to proliferate.\n\nWith each crisis, YouTube has raced to update its guidelines for which types of content are allowed. But it has lagged behind Facebook and Twitter in hiring moderators, and has faced criticism for double standards when it comes to moderating content from its biggest stars.\n\nStill, it has worked to strengthen its approach, including broadening its view of hate speech in its policies this summer, specifically banning videos that espouse racial supremacy or discrimination.\n\nMs Choi said YouTube counts on users to flag content that violates the company's guidelines, and that the company removed 8.3 million videos in the first quarter of this year alone.\n\nYouTube banned Jones in 2018, long before the company implemented its new policy. Jones is well-known for, among other things, espousing theories about the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting that caused survivors and their families to be harassed and threatened.\n\nYouTube, along with Apple and Facebook, told news outlets at the time that Jones was banned for repeated community standards violations. Jones, in turn, accused the companies of censorship.\n\nWhile having a \"robust community\" is a laudable goal for YouTube, the company's actions on Thursday show that \"platforms continue to be naive about how bad actors will exploit their words\", said Angelo Carusone, the president of liberal media watchdog group Media Matters for America.\n\nThe Washington Post", "description": "Far-right outlet Infowars made a short-lived return to YouTube on\u00a0Thursday after its banishment last year, briefly illustrating social media's struggle to remove rule-breaking content while still maintaining a forum for free expression.
