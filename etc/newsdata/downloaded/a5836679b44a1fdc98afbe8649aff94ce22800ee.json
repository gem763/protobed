Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, escalated his battle with Democratic lawmakers on Tuesday by defying a congressional subpoena for documents about his rogue campaign that pressured Ukraine\u2019s president to dig up dirt on President Trump\u2019s political rivals.\n\nIn a letter to the House Intelligence Committee, Mr. Giuliani\u2019s lawyer, Jon A. Sale, said that he would not hand over documents to the Democrat-led impeachment inquiry because the information requested was \u201cbeyond the scope of legitimate inquiry\u201d and a violation of attorney-client and executive privilege.\n\nIn a confrontational tweet that echoed the president\u2019s condemnation of the investigations, Mr. Giuliani said that he \u201cwill not participate in an illegitimate, unconstitutional, and baseless \u2018impeachment inquiry.\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Giuliani appeared to reject the idea that his decision to defy the subpoena will place him in any legal jeopardy. He said in his tweet that Mr. Sale would no longer be representing him on impeachment matters.", "description": "The president\u2019s personal lawyer said he would not hand over documents to the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry, calling it \u201cillegitimate, unconstitutional, and baseless.\u201d", "authors": ["Michael D.
