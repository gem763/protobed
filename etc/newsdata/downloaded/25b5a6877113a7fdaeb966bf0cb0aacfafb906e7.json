(Photo courtesy of Nikon)\n\nNikon Instruments Inc. today announced the winners of the forty-fifth annual Nikon Small World Photomicrography Competition. First place was awarded to microscopy technician Teresa Zgoda and recent university graduate Teresa Kugler for their visually stunning and painstakingly prepared photo of a turtle embryo. Captured using fluorescence and stereo microscopy, the colorful final image is a masterful example of image-stitching.\n\nImage-stitching is an imaging technique that required the 2019 winning pair to stack and stitch together hundreds of images to create the final image of their turtle. Adding to the challenge was the size and thickness of the turtle embryo. Creating the final image required precision, patience, and deep imaging expertise, as the organism\u2019s size meant only very small parts of the turtle could be imaged on the focal plane at a time.\n\nBoth Kugler and Zgoda are passionate micro-photographers, saying microscopy is a hobby that allows them to spend time on their dual passions of science and creative pursuits. Their winning image perfectly exemplifies the blend of science and art Nikon Small World aims to bring to the public each year. Zgoda currently resides in Boston, Massachusetts, Kugler in New York.\n\n\u201cMicroscopy lets us zoom in on the smallest organisms and building blocks that comprise our world \u2013 giving us a profound appreciation for the small things in life that far too often go unnoticed,\u201d said Kugler, \u201cIt allows me to do science with a purpose.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are inspired by the beautiful images we see through the microscope,\u201d added Zgoda, \u201cIt\u2019s humbling and deeply fulfilling to be able to share that science with other people.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Nikon Small World competition has been bringing stunning scientific images to the public for 45 years now,\u201d said Eric Flem, Communications Manager, Nikon Instruments, \u201cOur goal has always been to show the world how art and science intersect. As new imaging and microscopy techniques develop over the years, our winners showcase these technology advances more and more creatively. First place this year is no exception.\u201d\n\nSecond place was awarded to Nikon Small World veteran Dr. Igor Siwanowicz for his composite image of three single-cell freshwater protozoans, sometimes called \"trumpet animalcules.\u201d He used confocal microscopy to capture the detail of the cilia, tiny hairs used by the animals for feeding and locomotion.\n\nIn third place is Mr. Daniel Smith Paredes, who placed for his image of a developing American alligator embryo. He snapped this photo at around 20 days of development using immunofluorescence and is studying the development and evolution of vertebrate anatomy.\n\nIn addition to the top three winners, Nikon Small World recognized 86 photos out of thousands of entries from scientists and artists across the globe.
