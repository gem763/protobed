Commercial cranes dropped back in the CBD from 25 to 21, as greater Melbourne's tally slipped to 24, from 27.\n\nBut the total remains higher than its level a year earlier and it also excludes cranes working on large mixed-used projects, such as Cbus Property's 447 Collins Street \"Pantscraper\" project.\n\n\"That market has softened a little bit but there is still strong demand in 20- to 25-storey buildings out in suburbs and around the CBD,\" Caelli says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd even without the same number of new office projects in Melbourne as in the NSW capital, the city remains busy, he says.\n\n\"We haven't seen the office demand as strong in Melbourne as they are getting in Sydney because there is still enough coming through to bolster the market.\"\n\nCharter Hall managing director David Harrison at the topping out of 130 Lonsdale Street.\n\nIt's taken time for central Melbourne to digest the source of new supply that has come in Docklands, on the western edge of the traditional Hoddle Grid, but that era is now ending, Harrison says.\n\n\"You\u2019ve obviously had nearly one million square metres of office added to Docklands in the last 20 years which has somewhat removed the viability of new development in the CBD,\" he says.\n\n\"As Docklands has filled up ... people like us with Wesley have been able to make newer development viable.\"\n\nCharter Hall this month topped out its 35-level tower at 130 Lonsdale Street in the developer's Wesley Place precinct, and the demand for newer-style CBD office accommodation is why the 60,000sq m tower is fully leased well ahead of its mid-2020 completion, he says.\n\n\"We\u2019ve got three major super funds \u2013 Telstra Super, Cbus and AustralianSuper \u2013 all moving out of buildings they\u2019ve been in for 20 years,'' Mr Harrison said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven so, the lack of suitable sites to develop \u2013 and planning considerations such as the state government's so-called C270 rules limiting floor space ratios and requiring setbacks \u2013 will be a curb on activity in the CBD.\n\nDevelopers are already being forced to amalgamate sites to get suitable size, as Dexus did last year with the Reserve Bank's 60 Collins Street tower and the neighbouring 52 Collins Street.\n\nThey are also competing for new sites coming to market, such as rail utility VicTrack's Treasury Square site, currently up for grabs.\n\n\"I\u2019ve been doing commercial real estate in Australia for 32 years and in all my career you could have always identified 20 or more development sites to build office projects in Melbourne, and in the last five years I think the number of sites has probably diminished to less than three,\" Harrison says.", "description": "Sites remain scarce, making it tougher for developers to create projects big enough to meet the demand.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_445%2C$y_145/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/877c755fd20aa8244bcaa06f3ff8441e19a8d380", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
