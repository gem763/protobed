And that's OK. Between what I lose and what I would've made, I would've made a fortune, if I just ran my business. I ran it really well. I have a great business. I have the best properties.\"\n\nHe said he planned to use Doral \"at no cost or give it free\" and listed Doral's amenities in defence of his choice, \"but the Democrats went crazy\".\n\nMr Trump also called the Congressional impeachment inquiry into his dealings with Ukraine \"illegitimate\" and mocked Democrats' efforts to introduce another whistleblower.\n\nThe Trump family has been accused of using the White House for its business interests; Mr Trump says he has handed control of the Trump empire to his sons while his assets are held within a blind trust\n\nRead more\n\nWhy Trump is still angry that he can't host G7 leaders at Doral\n\nLive: Trump rages over having to drop Miami resort as next G7 venue\n\nNew account details Trump outburst during his first Pentagon briefing\n\nTrump misspells his defence secretary\u2019s name in rambling rant\n\nTrump's actions worse than Nixon's, says Bush's former ethics lawyer", "description": "A question about Donald Trump's scuttled plans to host the international G-7 summit at his Florida golf resort devolved into a seven-minute defence of his presidency and the dismissal of a US constitutional clause that prevents presidents from profiting from their own presidency as \"phoney\"", "authors": ["Alex Woodward"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/lDXVWnbnTyN_X7Hy4_HynA--~B/aD0yOTY7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/a666393f393c19415647348c81fa6420", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
