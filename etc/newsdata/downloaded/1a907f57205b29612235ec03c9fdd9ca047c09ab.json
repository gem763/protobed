I also found them very credible,\u201d House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., told reporters. \u201cI want to thank the whistleblower for coming forward. I think what this courageous individual has done has exposed serious wrongdoing.\u201d\n\nThe White House, which had initially blocked the release of the complaint to Congress, delivered the still-classified complaint to Capitol Hill on Wednesday afternoon. The release of the document, which was mandated by law, came hours after the administration made public a summary of a July 25 phone call in which Trump urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, who served until earlier this year on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. The call between the two leaders was reportedly part of what prompted the whistleblower\u2019s complaint against Trump.\n\nRep. Mike Quigley, D-Ill., compared the whistleblower\u2019s description of Trump\u2019s behavior to his infamous boast during the 2016 campaign that he could \u201cstand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody\u201d without losing the support of his base.\n\nPresident Trump speaks at the U.N.

Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., said that the complaint gives the panel new leads to investigate.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said that after reading the complaint that he was \u201ceven more worried about what happened than I was when I read the memorandum of the conversation. There are so many facts that have to be examined.\u201d\n\nTheir descriptions of the complaint come a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ceded to mounting calls within her caucus, announcing a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump's behavior.\n\n\"The president has admitted to asking the president of Ukraine to take actions which would benefit him politically,\" Pelosi said. \"The actions of the Trump presidency revealed the dishonorable fact of the president\u2019s betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections.\"\n\n\"The president must be held accountable,\" Pelosi added. \"No one is above the law.\"\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "After a whistleblower\u2019s complaint against President Trump was delivered to Congress on Wednesday, several top Democrats who reviewed it described the contents as damning \u2014 and said that it reinforces their calls for his impeachment.", "authors": ["Dylan Stableford", "Senior Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0GDW3GSspUDAOB6Mb1xIIw--~B/aD0xMTkzO3c9MTc5MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/c035b1c0-dfe5-11e9-9f5f-f2f835f33d54", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
