In addition to getting high analytic marks, all the aces that are getting set to toe the mound also have passed the old-school eye test.\n\n\u201cWhat this is, is the making of a classic,\u2019\u2019 ex-World Series champion manager Jim Leyland told USA TODAY. \u201cEverybody is looking forward to this. It\u2019s great for baseball. Look at the matchups. It\u2019s baseball at its best, and the way the game was meant to be played. You need horses to win championships. What I personally believe is that your best bullpen is a seven-inning starter. You\u2019re then only using your bullpen because you want to, not because you have to. These two teams are proving how valuable good starting pitching means to teams. This has got a chance to be a hell of a matchup.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Astros, who are seeking their second World Series in three years, opened as 2-1 favorites over the wild-card Nationals, who are making their Series debut.\n\nSubscribe here for our free daily newsletter.\n\nRead the full story at FiveThirtyEight", "description": "With Gerrit Cole taking on Max Scherzer in Game 1 tonight and more great pitching matchups to follow, the 2019 World Series will be a true Fall Classic.", "authors": ["Evan Bleier"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1176176177-e1571769049332.jpg?fit=775%2C517", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
