When Anthony Rizzo told him on TV that he was \u201can emotional wreck\u201d and Ross advised him \u201cjust continue to breathe,\u201d Cub fans tried to breathe, too. Ross had given up two runs on a wild pitch that bizarrely bounced off his mask and now he\u2019s telling me, contrary to the instructions of every Little League coach, that \u201cI was trying to hit the [solo] homer.\u201d It was, he says, \u201cnice to get one back.\u201d\n\nAs we chat about his being the oldest player ever to hit a World Series home run, he mentions how much he loves Chicago and Chicago fans\u2014family people rooting for a team with family ownership and a family feeling among players. I babble in a way just short of embarrassing about how I had grown up within walking distance of Wrigley Field, how my late grandfather had taken my late father to the 1945 World Series and my father had taken me to my first Cubs game more than half a century ago, and how starting at age 9 I had spent my summer days in the bleachers watching the Cubs lose before passing the fever on to my kids.\n\nRoss stands up from the Cubs bench and says: \u201cYou need a hug, too,\u201d then wraps me in his arms, the sweet rain and sweat of his championship T-shirt transporting me home.", "description": "I get a bear hug from John Cusack and suddenly we\u2019re talking joyfully with Bill Murray and Michael Wilbon about the epic dimensions of what we have just witnessed.", "authors": ["Jonathan Alter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1439,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1492107346/articles/2016/11/04/how-it-felt-to-be-in-the-dugout-with-the-chicago-cubs-after-they-won-the-world-series/161103-alter-baseball-tease_kosqip", "published_at": "2016-11-04"}
