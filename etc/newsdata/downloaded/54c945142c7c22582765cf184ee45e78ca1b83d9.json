But asking your husband to vacuum is not, in my eyes, a criminal offence.\u201d\n\nValerie later accepted a two-year restraining order against her now ex-husband, who subsequently dropped the case.\n\n\"I appreciate our marriage was on the rocks but for Mike to treat me the way he did, after all the love and care I put into the relationship, was devastating.\"\n\nThe mother of two is now in a new relationship and said she wished she\u2019d had her day in court to prove she did nothing wrong.\n\nSources: Mirror UK, Sun UK, Daily Mail", "description": "A woman who was arrested last year for nagging her husband to clean the house has spoken out.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9492/14dafff654bb4ff3a79501f250fc9b78.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
