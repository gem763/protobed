Like Lewis, he took over at a time of unprecedented crisis, and like Lewis, he has managed to stabilize the ship and turn it around, if with (another parallel with Tesco\u2019s savior) less obvious momentum than it had before: the shares have only eked out a modest 4% in the last three years.\n\nIn Dudley\u2019s case, the crisis was the Deepwater Horizon disaster, which killed 11 people and created the greatest oil-related environmental catastrophe in history. After his predecessor Tony Hayward\u2019s crass failure to recognize the gravity of the situation, Dudley acknowledged BP\u2019s responsibility and, while he defended its shareholders\u2019 interests legitimately in court, has complied with enough grace to at least ensure that the company can keep operating in the U.S., its most important market. Had he not done so, it's hard to see how BP would have been allowed to buy BHP Billiton's U.S. shale assets, as it did for $10.5 billion last year.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to argue with the company\u2019s statement on Friday morning that Dudley \u201crebuilt BP as a stronger, safer company ... This company, and indeed the whole industry, owes him a debt of gratitude.\"\n\nHis management of the Deepwater Horizon affair has, inevitably, overshadowed his other achievements, nowhere more than in Russia. Here Dudley made a virtue out of necessity, selling its joint venture stake at a top-of-the-cycle valuation to raise money to cover the Deepwater liabilities. He was forced to cede direct control of the company\u2019s best cash cow, but still kept a deep and close relationship with Rosneft \u2013 including a 19.75% stake that has enormous latent value, if ever Russia is inclined to replace its current management with one more enlightened.\n\nA further parallel with Tesco \u2013 not to be understated - is that the succession has again been smoothly planned, with a hand-picked successor \u2013 upstream operations head Bernard Looney - already in place. The key difference here is that Looney is a BP lifer, while Tesco went for an outsider in Walgreens\u2019 Ken Murphy. Keeping an upstream expert at the very top goes against the grain these days in Big Oil, but makes plenty of sense in BP\u2019s case, given the uniqueness of the Deepwater Horizon legacy.\n\nBP shares were up 1.1% by 5:30 AM ET, on a day when most European stock indexes were content to wait for the monthly U.S. report. The was up 0.3%, while the was up 0.1%.", "description": "StockBeat: Another FTSE Titan Bows Out as Dudley Leaves BP", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC810D5_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
