They bemoan the end of summer, seeing the season as a time of mourning. But those glass-half-empty people are wrong.\n\nFall is a season for rejoicing, because while the weather cools off in the Northern Hemisphere and birds begin their long slog south, travel to Europe is at its best. Gone are the hordes of tourists in sweat-soaked tank tops. You\u2019re looking at sweater weather. Better yet, you\u2019re looking at European scarf weather.\n\nThe perks go beyond climate considerations, too. If you take a peek at airplane fares year-round, prices dip in the fall. The only time you\u2019ll find lower prices is in the dead of winter.\n\nOnce you\u2019re ready to start packing your layers, you\u2019ll need to plan out your autumnal trip across the pond. We checked in with our expert local guides in Europe\u2019s best fall destinations to find out what makes their cities great this time of year.\n\nParis\n\nIn the summer, Paris is a minefield of tourists. Walking along the Seine is still beautiful, but it\u2019s harder to enjoy when you\u2019re dodging a family of four on rental bikes barreling down the sidewalk. Come fall, most of those families are back at home settling into the new school year, leaving the banks of the famous river to you and the perfectly dressed Parisians.\n\n\u201cSounds a bit cliche, but Paris is the perfect city to enjoy fall because you can sit at any coffee place and feel immediately in an old rom-com movie or like you were a famous novel writer,\u201d says By The Way\u2019s Paris City Guide writer Jennifer Padjemi in an email. \u201cEven if you want to stay outside, waiters give you some blankets to keep warm.\"\n\nPadjemi has many recommendations for fall in the City of Lights. Strolling the Seine and the various canals and parks is a must-do. If you\u2019d like to get outside the city for some leaf-peeping, an hour\u2019s drive away you\u2019ll find the forest of Fontainebleau.\n\n[A local\u2019s guide to Paris]\n\nTracking down seasonal produce, such as pumpkins and squash, is on Padjemi\u2019s list as well. She recommends Marche d\u2019Aligre, one of the most famous local markets.\n\nBerlin\n\nBerlin is an incredible walking city, even more so in the fall. The vines creeping up the city\u2019s historical buildings complement the colorful street art. Cooler temperatures also complement binge-eating currywurst and schnitzel.\n\n\n\n(iStock) (Washington Post illustration; iStock/Washington Post illustration; iStock)\n\n\u201cWhereas summer may be the best time to experience Berlin\u2019s wide range of outdoor activities, fall is when Berliners turn to the other aspects that make this city so livable,\u201d Rick Noack, By The Way\u2019s author of the Berlin City Guide, writes in an email. \u201cTourists and locals alike head to art exhibitions or reflect on the turbulent historic days of German reunification and the fall of the Berlin Wall \u2014 the dates fall into October and November, respectively.\u201d\n\n[A local\u2019s guide to Berlin]\n\nNoack also says there\u2019s no shortage of bars, restaurants and cozy cafes that are ideal for a fall escape.\n\nRome\n\nSummer tourism in Rome has gotten so extreme that the city\u2019s government has had to step in with new fines and regulations to protect its treasured monuments. Avoid contributing to overtourism by skipping a trip during the summer and visiting Rome a few months later.\n\n\u201cBy the beginning of October, the city returns to the residents in full force,\u201d the Rome writer for By The Way, Erica Firpo, told us. \u201cEverything is back in business, including the buses and politics. Even if it feels a bit chaotic, it\u2019s the kind of chaos we know and love because the city is alive following the summer snooze.\u201d\n\n[A local\u2019s guide to Rome]\n\nFirpo notes Rome\u2019s perfect fall weather as another draw \u2014 bright and sunny in the daytime, a bit chilly at night \u2014 along with a new lineup of exhibitions and events during the cooler season.\n\nDublin\n\nLeaf-peepers, fall in Dublin is for you. Pack a raincoat to don over your new Irish wool sweater and find a pub to nestle into for a warming whiskey.\n\n\u201cDublin is beautiful in fall \u2014 or autumn, as we call it,\u201d says Yvonne Gordon, writer for By The Way\u2019s guide to Dublin. \u201cThe trees all along the canals and rivers, and in parks like the Phoenix Park and St. Stephen\u2019s Green, turn yellow and gold, and the ground is carpeted with soft leaves. The autumn light is spectacular, especially early in the morning and in the evening. There\u2019s also a slight chill in the air, so knitted woolies come out, and the first crackling fires are lit.\u201d\n\n[A local\u2019s guide to Dublin]\n\nThe joys of Europe in fall aren\u2019t exclusive to these four cities. The continent has a wealth of options for the fall traveler to explore for fractions of the prices you would pay during the summer.\n\nTo find inspiration for where to go, try plugging in fall dates to Skyscanner.com\u2019s flight-searching function, and type \u201cEverywhere\u201d into the \u201cto\u201d form. See what the most affordable destinations are from your closest airport, and plan your European jaunt accordingly.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of traveling during the fall\n\nWhat do you think of By The Way?
