Hughes recognised the trio of winemakers as kindred spirits, and their wines \u2013 wild-yeast fermented, unfiltered, funky \u2013 blew his mind. He invited them back to his place and they bonded over a bottle of Slovenian amber-coloured skin-contact wine made by Stanko Radikon, one of the stars of the natural movement then emerging in Europe. The four conspirators were soon plotting to revolutionise Australia\u2019s wine culture.\n\nThe group called themselves Natural Selection Theory. Hughes started fermenting Hunter Valley semillon on skins in ceramic eggs, playing music to each of the ferments like some vinous art installation. Van Klopper, Shobbrook and Erskine put raw, young unsulphured wine into 30-litre demijohns and delivered them by hand to the new bars then springing up in Sydney: wine distribution as performance piece.\n\n\u201cIt was a punk attitude,\u201d says Erskine. \u201cWe wanted to shake the system.\u201d\n\nSkin contact, wild ferment, lower sulphur additions, blending white and red grapes are all mainstream winemaking practice now.\n\nAt every available opportunity, at tastings, dinners and seminars, Hughes would share his definition of natural wine in dramatic fashion: \u201cNatural wine is like hot pants,\u201d he\u2019d declaim, pulling down his trousers to reveal a pair of bright pink short-shorts. \u201cWhat you see is what you get!\u201d\n\nNatural Selection Theory wasn\u2019t the only group of winemakers tapping into the global natural trend, but they were the most energetic and, thanks to Hughes, the most theatrical. A new generation of sommeliers and consumers fell in love with these wines, and a host of other winemakers soon jumped on the natural bandwagon. But not everyone was quite so enthusiastic.\n\nWhen I poured one of van Klopper\u2019s funkier, more provocative wines \u2013 the appropriately labelled Wild Man pinot noir \u2013 at a masterclass in 2012, James Halliday, doyen of Australian wine writers, picked up his glass, sniffed at it like it was a dead thing the cat brought in, and melodramatically refused to even taste it.\n\nA decade on, natural wines continue to polarise: for every supportive sommelier, there are plenty of Hallidays for whom the funkier, cloudier bottles are simply beyond the pale. And the market for these wines is still small: van Klopper, Shobbrook and Erskine are producing less wine now than they were a couple of years ago. But the category\u2019s influence on broader wine culture in Australia has been undeniable.\n\nBy pushing the boundaries of what\u2019s acceptable, natural winemakers have shown the rest of the industry that breaking rules, trying new styles and being brave with experimental winemaking can all be commercially successful \u2013 that consumers are more adventurous than previously thought.", "description": "After a decade of disruption, the case for natural wines is becoming more palatable.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5279%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_202%2C$y_405/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/35813d58d495ee149eb218bd366c14ab5c9f4799", "published_at": "2019-07-12"}
