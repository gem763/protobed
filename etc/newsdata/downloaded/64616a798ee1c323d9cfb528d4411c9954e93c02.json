Soon.\n\n\"Naby is one and a half or two weeks in full training around about.\n\n(Image: 2019 Liverpool FC)\n\n\"He looks good and that is why he played [against Man Utd]. They all did, that is why we made the changes (Keita, Lallana and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain).\n\n\"We made them because we really knew they could have an impact in that game, it was the best news of the whole day at Man Utd.\n\n\"Not the result, not the goalscorer, which was nice, but these three guys who are important players for us can perform like this in a game where they don't have rhythm and they don't play that much, that they can perform like this in a game.\n\n\"In training, I see it a lot, so that was the best news. It will not be long.\u201d\n\nLiverpool bid to claim just their second Champions League group stage win away from Anfield in 11 outings tonight.\n\nDefeat to Napoli last time out meant that they have won just once in Europe in the group stage - at Maribor two years ago - in 10 group games.", "description": "Keita came off the bench and produced an impressive cameo against Manchester United on Sunday", "authors": ["Alex Richards", "Image", "Liverpool Fc Via Getty Images", "Wyscout Spa", "Liverpool Fc"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20703845.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Liverpool-Travel-to-Genk-Ahead-of-Their-Champions-League-Match.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
