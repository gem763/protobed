It's a safety decision, I know \u2014 touchscreens are incredibly distracting while driving \u2014 but it's still annoying.\n\nThe bottom line: The Mazda CX-9, starting at $32,280, is a family car you'll enjoy driving.", "description": "The CX-9 nails luxury, but others crossovers beat it in roominess.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/c3cr4Lu78QA238_evy0-SgD07wM=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/10/04/1570215919113.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
