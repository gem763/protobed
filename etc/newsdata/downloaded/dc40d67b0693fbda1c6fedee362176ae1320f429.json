To put this in perspective, Usain Bolt manages four.\n\nWhat's more it does it in the hottest place on Earth \u2013 where the sun rules mercilessly.\n\nThe vast wilderness, as big as the United States, is the toughest part of Africa.\n\nThey venture from their nests to scavenge the corpses of dead animals at the peak of the day - when the sand can reach 60\u00b0C (140F).\n\nThe silver hairs on their back act as the ultimate sunshade - reflecting the rays and repelling the heat back towards the sky.\n\nLead author Professor Harald Wolf, an arthropod expert at the University of Ulm, said: 'Even among desert ants, the silver ants are special.'\n\nFootage of a Saharan silver ant (Cataglyphis bombycina) running highlighting when the legs are in contact with the ground and when they are swinging\n\nBut little was known about how they scamper at such blistering speeds across the sand.\n\nSo Prof Wolf and colleagues captured the enigmatic desert dwellers on camera after finding them thriving in the dunes during a visit to the salt pans of Tunisia.\n\nLocating the inconspicuous nests was far from easy. Explained lab member Dr Sarah Pfeffer: 'We had to look for digging ants or follow a foraging ant back home.'\n\nBut once the researchers had located a nest, it was simply a matter of connecting an aluminium channel to the entrance - and placing a feeder at the end to lure them out.\n\nDr Pfeffer said: 'After the ants have found the food - they love mealworms - they shuttle back and forth in the channel and we mounted our camera to film them from the top.'\n\nThe researchers also excavated a nest, returning with it to record the insects running more slowly at cooler temperatures.\n\nSaharan silver ant (Cataglyphis bombycina) workers in the desert at Douz, Tunisia\n\nInterestingly, they only managed a more sedate 57 millimetres a second at 10\u00b0C in the lab - as it was not the temperature they were used to.\n\nIn contrast, their larger cousin known as Cataglyphis fortis, which also lives in the Sahara, only gets up to 620 millimetres a second - or 50 body lengths.\n\nIt makes the Saharan silver, known scientifically as Cataglyphis bombycina, the world's fastest ant.\n\nIt also places it close to the top of the list of world record breaking creatures - alongside the Australian tiger beetle's and California coastal mite's 171 and 377 body lengths a second, respectively.\n\nThe study published in the Journal of Experimental Biology also compared the leg length of the Sahara silver and Cataglyphis fortis - and found the former is truly extraordinary.\n\nIts limbs are almost 20 percent shorter. Wondering how it outstrips its bigger relatives, the team then focused on its footwork.\n\nThis showed it takes up to 47 strides a second - around a third more than Cataglyphis fortis.\n\nFurther analysis found they quadrupled from 4.7 to 20.8mm - as the ant shifts up through the gears.\n\nAnd instead of simply running it switches to a gallop - with all six feet off the ground at once.\n\nThe ant's coordination was also impressive. It synchronises the movements of the three legs that work together as tripods as it walk.\n\nEach foot only contacted the ground for as little as 7 milliseconds before initiating the next stride.\n\nAdded Prof Wolf: 'These features may be related to the sand dune habitat. They could prevent the animal's feet from sinking too deeply into the soft sand.'\n\nHe now plans to find out more about how they pull off their astounding feats - which he suspects must require muscle contraction speeds close to physiological limits.\n\nAtom Ant was a popular TV cartoon series that thrilled youngsters in the US and the UK.\n\nThe indestructible character operated out of an anthill in the countryside, where he had a computer and exercise equipment. He could even fly to Batman style assignments he got from the police.", "description": "Named the Saharan silver, after its home, it can cover almost a yard - in a single second.
