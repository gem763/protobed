The Rise of Skywalker - 155 minutes\n\n2. The Last Jedi - 152 minutes\n\n3. Attack of the Clones - 142 minutes\n\n4. Revenge of the Sith - 140 minutes\n\n5. The Force Awakens - 138 minutes\n\n6. The Phantom Menace - 136 minutes\n\n7. Solo: A Star Wars Story - 135 minutes\n\n8. Rogue One: A Star Wars Story - 133 minutes\n\n9. Return of the Jedi - 131 minutes\n\n10. The Empire Strikes Back - 124 minutes\n\n11. Star Wars (A New Hope) - 121 minutes\n\nIt is notable that the original trilogy films are the shortest entries in the entire franchise.\n\nWe are sure director J.J. Abrams has a good reason for the long run time, including an emotional goodbye to everyone's favourite protocol droid, C-3PO.\n\nStar Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is released in UK cinemas on December 19, 2019.\n\nAre you excited for The Rise of Skywalker?
