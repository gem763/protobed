O\u2019Rourke when asked how he planned to take away assault weapons from American gun owners, registered or unregistered. O\u2019Rourke in a previous debate said, \u201cHell, yes,\u201d he would as president establish a mandatory government buyback program for AK-47 and AR-15 rifles but without going into details of how it would be enforced.\n\n\u201cI expect my fellow Americans to follow the law,\u201d he said Tuesday. \u201cThe same way that we enforce any provision, any law that we have right now. We don\u2019t go door to door to do anything in this country to enforce the law. I expect Republicans, Democrats, gun owners, non-gun owners alike to respect and follow the law.\u201d\n\nPete Buttigieg, left, and Beto O'Rourke.

I believe in this country, I believe in my fellow Americans. I believe they will do the right thing.\u201d\n\nWhile fellow candidates have praised O\u2019Rourke\u2019s response to a shooting that devastated his hometown of El Paso, Texas, some Democrats raised alarms that his mandatory gun buyback proposal plays into Republican hands.\n\nButtigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., charged the former lawmaker with needing \u201cto pick a fight in order to stay relevant\u201d and calling his buyback plan a \u201cshiny object.\u201d\n\n\u201cCongressman, you just made it clear that you don\u2019t know how this is going to take weapons off the streets. If you can develop the plan further I think we can have a debate about it,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t wait,\u201d he added. \u201cPeople are dying in the streets right now.\u201d\n\nButtigieg, who has spoken out against gun confiscation, repeated his calls for universal background checks, a ban on the sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and \u201cred flag\u201d laws to authorize law enforcement agencies to temporarily confiscate weapons from owners deemed to pose a threat.\n\n\u201cWe cannot wait for purity tests,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to get something done.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not a purity test,\u201d O\u2019Rourke fired back. \u201cThis is a country that loses 40,000 of our fellow Americans every year to gun violence. This is a crisis and we\u2019ve got to do something about it. And those challenges you described are not mutually exclusive to the challenges that I\u2019m describing.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo use the analogy of health care, it would be as though we said, \u2018Look, we\u2019re for primary care but let\u2019s not talk about mental health care because that\u2019s a bridge too far,\u2019\u201d he continued. \u201cNo, let\u2019s decide what we are going to believe in, what we are going to achieve and let\u2019s bring this country together in order to do that.\u201d\n\nReferencing gun reform groups like March for Our Lives, O\u2019Rourke added, \u201cLet\u2019s follow their inspiration and lead and not be limited by the polls and the consultants and the focus groups. Let\u2019s do what\u2019s right while we have time to do what\u2019s right.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe problem isn\u2019t the polls, the problem is the policy,\u201d Buttigieg responded. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone on this stage recognizes, or at least I thought we did, that the problem is not other Democrats who don\u2019t agree with your particular idea of how to handle this. The problem is the National Rifle Association (NRA) and their enablers in Congress, and we should be united in taking the fight to them,\u201d Buttigieg added, drawing applause from the audience.\u201d", "description": "At Tuesday night\u2019s Democratic primary debate, presidential candidates Beto O\u2019Rourke and Pete Buttigieg escalated their disagreement over Buttigieg\u2019s proposal for mandatory buybacks of assault weapons.", "authors": ["Kadia Tubman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6qZPmJMqj7GOVNjH8RLV3g--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/9144fbc0-efbf-11e9-bbde-e801474e9b00", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
