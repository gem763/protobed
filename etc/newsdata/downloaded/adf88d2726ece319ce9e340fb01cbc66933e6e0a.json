It\u2019s a velvety rag\u00f9 that relies on chicken thighs, bacon and onions for flavor. It takes a couple of steps \u2014 browning the chicken, letting it cool after it braises and then shredding it \u2014 but it is not too challenging for a weeknight. The recipe is versatile. Over egg noodles, it serves six for dinner, but it can also make a nice dinner for two or four. The leftovers freeze well, or can turn into a filling for hand pies, which are terrific tucked into lunchboxes the next day.\n\nFeatured in: My Quest For Lunchbox Supremacy.", "description": "This is a simplified riff on a popular recipe that the food editor Andy Baraghani developed for Bon App\u00e9tit magazine It\u2019s a velvety rag\u00f9 that relies on chicken thighs, bacon and onions for flavor It takes a couple of steps \u2014 browning the chicken, letting it cool after it braises and then shredding it \u2014 but it is not too challenging for a weeknight", "authors": ["Kim Severson", "Melissa Clark", "Genevieve Ko", "David Tanis", "Margaux Laskey", "Sarah Digregorio", "Colu Henry", "Martha Rose Shulman", "Erin Jeanne Mcdowell", "Samin Nosrat"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/25/dining/23lunchrex1/merlin_160763217_e6d0be5a-8dec-4af8-9150-208889ef2d29-articleLarge.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
