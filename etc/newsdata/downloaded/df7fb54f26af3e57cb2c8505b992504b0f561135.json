The three congregations now worship at two nearby synagogues. Last week, Tree of Life leaders unveiled their vision for the damaged building: a rebuilt space for places of worship; memorial, education and social events; and classrooms and exhibitions.\n\nThe commemoration\u2019s theme is \u201cRemember. Repair. Together.\u201d It includes a private Jewish service, studying the portion of the Torah that was to be read when the shooting happened, opportunities to do community service, and a public memorial service.\n\nSeveral hundred people have registered to volunteer at various community organizations on Sunday. In Germany, the Clarion Quartet, comprised of Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra musicians, will perform at a special event in Berlin.\n\nThousands are expected to participate in Sunday\u2019s remembrance through Pause With Pittsburgh, a virtual memorial event created by the Jewish Federations of North America.\n\nAuthorities charged Robert Bowers, 47, a truck driver from Baldwin, Pennsylvania, in the massacre. Investigators say he used an AR-15 rifle and other weapons, and posted criticism of an immigrant aid society on social media before the attack, claiming the Jewish charity \u201clikes to bring invaders that kill our people.\u201d\n\nFederal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.", "description": "PITTSBURGH (AP) \u2014 The first anniversary of the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history is being marked around the world Sunday with community service", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/27/9b2b8a_synagogue-shooting-anniversary-72016-flower-pots-one-11-worshippers-killed-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
