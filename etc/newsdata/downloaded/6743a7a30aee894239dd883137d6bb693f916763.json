Members of Congress are organized to hold hearings to explore the cancer on the presidency. Reporters, like dobermans, are bred to sniff it out.\n\nWhat if there is no cover-up, no need to meet with Deep Throat in an underground garage to get to the bottom of a break-in of Democratic headquarters? What if shame has gone the way of the landline, an artifact of White Houses past?\n\nThese aren\u2019t hypothetical questions. It upends the moral universe to have a president who brags about a call to the point of releasing the transcript in which he shakes down the Ukrainian president in a weapons-for-dirt-on-Biden deal as if it were perfectly normal. True enough, it didn\u2019t contain the words \u201cquid pro quo,\u201d as if the absence of a Latin phrase no one uses in conversation supports Trump\u2019s assertion that he wasn\u2019t withholding money to fight Vladimir Putin\u2019s invading army until he got what he wanted.", "description": "The president isn\u2019t intelligent but he is wily, confusing the third and fourth estates with his admissions against interest.", "authors": ["Margaret Carlson"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2700,w_4800,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571810270/191022-Carlson-trump-tease_s3me6v", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
