At the time I was a \u201cfunctionary\u201d at a Washington, D.C. think tank. Getting more specific, I was a fundraiser. Eager to become an economic policy writer despite no background in economics, fundraising paid the bills while I read and wrote at night and on weekends. Notable about 2004 is that no organization wanted me for my writing, which meant that the footer on my op-eds was \u201cJohn Tamny is a writer in Washington, D.C.\u201d\n\nAll of what\u2019s been written so far rates mention simply because in 2004 I asked Fisher to meet via e-mail about the organization I was raising money for. Naively trying to appear somewhat credible, I attached a recent opinion piece that yet again indicated my status as a writer whom no one was ready to be affiliated with.\n\nDespite this Ken Fisher, the 2nd longest serving columnist in the history of Forbes magazine, the bestselling author of countless books, and the world famous investor, took a meeting with me. Even more amazing to me was that this wasn\u2019t some ten minute hello/goodbye meeting; rather the billionaire Fisher spent over an hour with me talking the economy, the markets, and my favorite topic of discussion at the time, Sarbanes-Oxley.\n\nI left the meeting walking on water. Despite overseeing tens of billions of client dollars for his eponymous firm, Fisher took the time to get to know me, to discuss all manner of subjects with me, plus he listened to me. He did this even though there was plainly nothing to gain from spending time with this most mid-level of workers. See above. Ken was just being Ken. So genuine, so interested, so unlike what most would expect a billionaire to be. He didn\u2019t have handlers shooing me away, he just sat with me in a conference room and treated me like a somebody. This is how Ken does things.\n\nAs the meeting was ending, I asked Ken if I could add him to my distribution list for the opinion pieces I was writing, and he said yes. We\u2019ve been in contact ever since, and I\u2019m exceedingly proud to say I consider him a very good friend.\n\nNotable about my first meeting with Ken, and numerous meetings since then, is that he hasn\u2019t changed one bit. He remains this extraordinarily kind person who makes time to read my columns, to discuss them with me, he tells where me where I\u2019m wrong, cheers me when I\u2019m right, he makes time to have dinner with me when he's in Washington, D.C., plus he always makes a point of asking endless questions about what\u2019s going on with me as a person. Ken knows my wife, who adores him, and always asks about her along with my daughter. All of this rates mention simply because it\u2019s the experience that those lucky enough to know Ken similarly confirm.\n\nIndeed, in my capacity as an economics and market-focused writer I\u2019ve gotten to know a number of former and existing Fisher Investments employees over the years. To say Ken is venerated by those who know him, who worked for him, and who still work for him, is an understatement.\n\nAlong these lines, I received an e-mail from one of Ken\u2019s former employees last month. This was before what happened happened, which is worth bringing up for it showing what those lucky enough to know Ken think of him. In other words, this e-mail wasn\u2019t a defensive response to what happened on October 8th. The ex-employee wrote:\n\n\u201cKF is the real deal - always goes out of his way to support his troops anytime something goes terribly wrong... best leader I\u2019ve ever been around.\u201d\n\nThe comments from the ex-employee were a preface to a post put up on LinkedIn by an existing Fisher Investments employee who wrote the following:\n\n\u201cSo my wife passed away this past weekend, leaving behind a grieving husband and two young kids.\n\nThroughout this process my work Fisher Investments has been more than accommodating, and hundreds of my \u201cFisher Family\u201d have reached out to offer me their support.\n\nToday I received a personal letter in the mail from our founder Ken Fisher offering me his condolences and any support I needed. It\u2019s not often you get letters in the mail from a billionaire.\n\nThis just confirms again how lucky I am to work at such a great and supporting place where I can build my lifelong career. I\u2019ve never worked a better place, and I don\u2019t plan on going anywhere until I retire.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year I asked Ken if my friend Bill Walton and I could interview him for Bill\u2019s eponymous show, and Ken being Ken, he said yes. Once again no handlers. No chauffeurs. I picked him up at his hotel in my eleven-year old car, and we proceeded to drive for 45 minutes, talking most of the time about me. All that changed once we got to Bill\u2019s studio, and the two-part interview began. This requires mention because those who know me know that I\u2019m rarely at a loss for words. The \u201cproblem\u201d is that Ken fascinates me when he talks about politics, the economy and the markets, and this meant Bill conducted the interview largely solo. Thank goodness Bill is a true pro as I was too interested in what Ken was saying to even bother forming questions. Ken isn't just one of the nicest people I know. He\u2019s also truly fascinating.\n\nIt's stories like this that those \u201cnew\u201d to Ken, who only became aware of him based on quotes taken out of context, and past utterances taken out of context, are seemingly unaware of as they presently form opinions about him. They quite simply don\u2019t know him, and because they don\u2019t know they\u2019re unaware of how little their perception squares with reality.\n\nThe media aren\u2019t helping in the matter as they write about \u201clewd remarks he made this month at a financial services industry conference in San Francisco,\u201d as though Ken just made a point to talk in locker-room fashion about women because, well, the billionaire can. And that he somehow doesn\u2019t know any better. The \u201clewd\u201d quote comes from the New York Times, and it\u2019s a reminder of how very much media members can warp perception. They clearly have in this case as the very excellent Abigail Shrier made plain in a recent Wall Street Journal opinion piece. Shrier brought context to a \u201cstory\u201d that has so far lacked it. Shrier informed readers that what Ken actually said was very meaningful, and respectful to everyone, including women. In Shrier\u2019s words,\n\n\u201cThe advice he [Fisher] gives his employees is to approach potential investors sensitively. Otherwise, he said, it\u2019s like \u2018going up to a woman in a bar and saying, \u2018Hey, I want to talk about what\u2019s in your pants.\u2019\u201d\n\nOne wouldn\u2019t know it from reading about Ken\u2019s much commented on speech, but he was explaining to those in attendance that money for most people is a very uncomfortable subject to discuss. And because it is, those seeking to manage the money of others need to approach the situation delicately. In Shrier\u2019s words, Ken was telling his audience that in approaching potential clients, \u201cDon\u2019t be a jerk; talk to them like people, woo them, win them over. Don\u2019t be that guy.\u201d\n\nSadly, it\u2019s not just Ken\u2019s comments at an investor conference earlier this month that are being mangled. Eager to create a narrative out of nothing, journalists have unearthed other past assertions to build their weak case. Since Ken made \u201clewd remarks\u201d about women, he must be a rabid right winger who hates politicians and charity; the latter more than the former. The truth has been cast aside amid media attempts to create a horrid narrative.\n\nIndeed, the same New York Times piece that reported about \u201clewd remarks\u201d well out of context, noted that Ken had said at a 2011 investor conference that entrepreneurs had contributed more to society than any politician. This was reported in damning fashion, but any sentient being would acknowledge that Ken is absolutely right. Without getting into limited government versus big, the simple truth is that life absent individuals like Edison, Ford, Kroc, Jobs, Dell and Bezos (to name a microscopic few) would be defined by relentless drudgery.\n\nOther media accounts have focused on Ken\u2019s disdain for charity as being indicative of some miserly, hateful individual. In truth, Ken\u2019s just being realistic: what powers the economy forward is investment, the matching of capital with the talented, ambitious, visionary, and usually all three. There are no companies, no jobs, and there is no progress without investment, so Ken thinks it unwise to give money away. At risk of putting words into his mouth, he despises cancer, poverty, and addiction, but is not so arrogant as to presume that he knows how to fix the maladies mentioned. Since he doesn\u2019t, he allows market actors to direct his immense wealth to its highest use. Ken\u2019s disdain for charity is born of powerful compassion. He correctly thinks the investment that has improved our lives in countless other ways will similarly speed us along much more quickly to cancer and heart disease cures, along with erasure of poverty and addiction.\n\nIn short, the remarkable, brilliant, kind and compassionate truth about Ken Fisher has been lost amid media attempts to create villainy where it doesn\u2019t exist. This is shameful, and it demands correction. Those who know the wonderful truth about Ken owe it to reason and justice to correct a false narrative that has nothing to do with the person they know.", "description": "I first met Ken Fisher in 2004.
