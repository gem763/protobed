During the interview, she was asked about Trudeau wearing blackface makeup.\n\n\"Those in the black community have told me how much more love they have for the prime minister, that he wanted to have a black face. That he took great pride in that, too,\" Sgro said. \"And that it's the media that have blown this into something that it shouldn't be and that they're very supportive.\"\n\nSgro said nearly everyone has made \"poor choices\" in the past.\n\nIn an interview with a local radio station, Ontario Liberal candidate Judy Sgro suggests that black voters in her riding like Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau more because of his history with blackface. 1:39\n\nA video clip from that interview resurfaced today and is being widely shared online.\n\nSgro acknowledged on her Facebook page today that those comments were insensitive.\n\n\"I should have known better, and I apologize. The history of blackface is deeply racist and it is nothing other than discriminatory,\" she wrote.\n\n\"This issue has sparked an important conversation in our country and needs to be treated with great seriousness and sensitivity. I will continue to have these important conversations with my constituents.\"\n\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh called her comments \"ludicrous.\"\n\n\"It is embarrassing and shameful that she would suggest that people like Mr. Trudeau more because he did blackface,\" he said during a media availability today.\n\n\"That shows a massive disconnect between the Liberal Party, and in fact Mr. Trudeau, and what real people are living and experiencing.\"\n\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh reacts to Ontario Liberal candidate Judy Sgro suggesting black voters in her riding like Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau more because of his history with blackface. 0:24\n\nThe federal election campaign was upended last month when Time magazine reported that Trudeau dressed in blackface and a turban back in 2001 for a gala event at West Point Grey Academy, the B.C. private school Trudeau taught at 18 years ago.\n\nTrudeau subsequently admitted to wearing blackface at a high school talent show.
