This is all starting to feel like a spy movie or something, it\u2019s nuts. And gosh, it sounds like Ukrainians think Hillary is far easier to deal with than Trump.\n\nWonder why that is?\n\nWe love how Glenn seems as shocked as we are while watching it. Heh.\n\nRe-up this on Sunday or Monday morning, please. This will get ignored or lost on a late Friday night. \u2014 themiddleamerican (@theOKamerican) October 5, 2019\n\nYour wish is our command.\n\nThis episode was an excellent breakdown of the situation. The mainstream media in this country are unacceptably ridiculous \u2014 Studzmckenzy (@studzmckenzy) October 5, 2019\n\nAnd they have a narrative and agenda to push.\n\nSorry, not sorry.\n\nThis is one of the most informative videos I have watched in a long long time. It seems so simple when it\u2019s laid out to see exactly who needs to be taken down, yet they make it so damn convoluted intentionally. I have to wonder does @realDonaldTrump & will @TheJusticeDept use it \u2014 stephsboys (@ripjohnnyboy) October 6, 2019\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more.\n\n.@glennbeck does a spot-on impression of the media covering the Ukraine scandal wearing Trump-goggles. \"Nothing to see here\u2026\" If you missed the Ukraine special, it's up on YouTube now: https://t.co/hM6QqKugaU pic.twitter.com/USY6xwNUJt \u2014 TheBlaze (@theblaze) October 4, 2019\n\nSkip skip skip skip skip \u2026 TRUMP MADE A PHONE CALL.\n\nPerfect.\n\nThat\u2019s why the recording of Sytnik is such a big deal. The media (and Democrats) are conveniently leaving out the whole story in hopes they can sort of gloss over how dirty they\u2019ve been when it comes to Ukraine and magically oust Trump over a phone call.\n\nAnd as Glenn says, it doesn\u2019t work.\n\nRelated:\n\n\u2018What are YOU hiding?\u2019 AOC\u2019s attempt at pushing conspiracy theories on Trump\u2019s WH not doing Sunday shows BACKFIRES\n\n\u2018File under B for BATSH*T\u2019: Joy Reid\u2019s panel has a plan to make Nancy Pelosi president and OMG these people are insane (watch)\n\n\u2018This TYRANT abused his power\u2019: Dan Bongino eviscerates John Brennan using Romney to shame Republican Senators", "description": "Sounds like the Ukrainians were rooting for Hillary ... hrm.", "authors": ["Sam Janney", "Posted At Am On October", "Sam J."], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Beck.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
