The bloop single was the second postseason RBI of Maldonado\u2019s 20-game postseason career.\n\nThe shot came after Yuli Gurriel reached on a throwing error and Carlos Correa belted a double to left field giving the Astros two runners in scoring position.\n\nCorrea also added another run with an RBI in the bottom of the eighth.\n\nSTATE OF THE SERIES\n\nThe ALDS heads to Tropicana Field for a Monday matinee for Game 3, scheduled for 1:05 p.m. Eastern.\n\nThe Rays are set to throw former Astros pitcher Charlie Morton, who was the winning pitcher of the AL Wild Card game in Oakland, with their season on the line. Houston will counter with another ace, Zach Greinke, who was acquired midseason in a trade with the Diamondbacks.\n\nIn his final regular season start, Greinke came two outs away from a no-hitter in a 3-0 Astros\u2019 win over Seattle, Sept. 25.", "description": "Gerrit Cole mystified Rays batters with a club playoff record 15 strikeouts in a 3-1 win in Game 2 of the American League Divisional Series.", "authors": ["Quinton Martinez", "Published A.M.
