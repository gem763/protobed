But that same evening, the update disappeared \u2014 probably because of numerous reports that it was bricking HomePods. Thankfully, it appears there\u2019s now a new iOS 13.2.1 update, rolling out now, that picks up where 13.2 left off.\n\nAs MacRumors notes, iOS 13.2.1 has the exact same changelog, which suggests the only actual change is a fix for the bug. It\u2019d be nice if Apple came out and said that, but perhaps the company\u2019s hoping we\u2019ll forget there was ever an issue at all.\n\nKeep in mind that we don\u2019t actually know if this update comes with a fix \u2014 it\u2019s just highly unlikely that Apple would resume updates if it hadn\u2019t fixed the problem. We\u2019re installing it on a HomePod right now, but that won\u2019t be a definitive test either, since 13.2 didn\u2019t brick any of our personal units the first time around.\n\nIf you\u2019ve already got a bricked HomePod, there are reports that Apple will replace it, even out of warranty, if you contact Apple Support now.", "description": "After reports that iOS 13.2 was bricking some HomePod speakers, Apple reportedly pulled the update \u2014 but now, there\u2019s a brand-new 13.2.1 update with the same list of features that is newly available for download.", "authors": ["Sean Hollister", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Yaisr6tsysTZBmBC1YPetTY8q9Q=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10159641/jbareham_180202_2266_0136.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
