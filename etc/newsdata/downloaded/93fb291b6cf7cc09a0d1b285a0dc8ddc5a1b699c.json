REUTERS/Andres Martinez Casares\n\nThe neighbouring Solomon Islands and Kiribati decided to recognise China earlier this month, dropping self-ruled and democratic Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its own province with no rights to state-to-state relations.\n\nThe small developing nations lie in strategic waters that have been dominated by the United States and its allies since World War Two, and China\u2019s moves to expand its influence in the Pacific have angered Washington.\n\nIn a statement, the Marshall Islands said it had adopted a resolution to show its \u201cprofound appreciation to the people and government of Taiwan\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all seen China\u2019s attempts to expand its territory and footprint, and this should be of great concern to democratic countries,\u201d President Hilda Heine said.\n\nThe Foreign Ministry in Taiwan, which has denounced China for luring its allies with promises of easy loans, expressed \u201cdeep thanks\u201d for the message of support and pledged to further deepen cooperation with the Marshall Islands.\n\nIn Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said cooperation was warmly welcomed and had brought the Pacific island nations real benefits.\n\n\u201cAnyone who understands the situation and is not prejudiced can see this very clearly,\u201d he told a daily news briefing, when asked about Heine\u2019s criticism of China\u2019s role.\n\nSelf-ruled Taiwan now has formal relations with only 15 countries, many of them small, less developed nations in Central America and the Pacific, including Belize and Nauru.\n\nSeven countries have dropped Taiwan as a diplomatic ally since 2016, when Tsai took office. So the show of support from the Marshall Islands will provide some relief for her ahead of presidential elections in January.\n\nLast week parliament in the tiny South Pacific country of Tuvalu elected a new prime minister, making a change that analysts say could give China a chance to further undermine Taiwan in a region that has been a pillar of support.\n\nHaving retained his seat at a general election earlier this month, Tuvalu\u2019s pro-Taiwan leader Enele Sopoaga had been expected to keep the premiership, but the 16-person parliament instead selected Kausea Natano.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s embassy in Tuvalu said that its ambassador there, Marc Su, met Natano and Foreign Minister Simon Kofe on Tuesday, having met with all members of the new Cabinet late last week.\n\nIt did not provide details of their conversations.", "description": "The Marshall Islands confirmed it was maintaining diplomatic ties with Taiwan on Wednesday, a welcome show of support for President Tsai Ing-wen who has seen two other Pacific nations drop ties in favour of China in a matter of weeks.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1433956934&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P01K", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
