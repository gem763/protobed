He shuttled back and forth to the Ukrainian capital, coordinating U.S. aid packages and cajoling the officials to enact reforms even as the country fought off Russian-backed rebels in the country\u2019s east.\n\nMr. Biden\u2019s son Hunter took a board position with a Ukrainian natural gas extraction company, Burisma Holdings Ltd., in May 2014, months after the vice president took on his role in the country, which some anticorruption advocates feared would undermine the elder Mr. Biden\u2019s work. According to one official with ties to the company, Hunter Biden \u2019s compensation was around $50,000 a month. His position at the company expired in April 2019.\n\nThe White House said at the time there was nothing wrong with Hunter Biden\u2019s work, and that it didn\u2019t create a conflict of interest since he was a private person. Joe Biden denied ever helping with his son with the job, has called his son\u2019s work in Ukraine a sign of U.S. confidence in the country\u2019s future. Also serving on Burisma\u2019s board was a former president of Poland.\n\nPresident Trump in a July phone call repeatedly pressured the president of Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden, according to people familiar with the matter, urging Volodymyr Zelensky about eight times to work with his lawyer Rudy Giuliani on a probe.\n\nMessrs. Trump and Giuliani have suggested that Joe Biden pushed for the firing of Ukraine\u2019s general prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, in March 2016 to stop an investigation into Burisma. In Ukraine, government officials and anticorruption advocates say that is an outright misrepresentation. Neither Mr. Biden nor his son have been accused of any wrongdoing.\n\nThe owner of Burisma, Mykola Zlochevsky, has been under the scrutiny of prosecutors. A former minister of natural resources until 2012, Mr. Zlochevsky was accused of improperly granting gas extraction licenses to firms affiliated with him, and at times was investigated for alleged abuse of power, illegal enrichment and money laundering. Mr. Zlochevsky was never convicted of any crimes and denied any wrongdoing. His lawyer also denied that Mr. Zlochevsky ever benefited from his position in government.\n\nMr. Shokin had dragged his feet into those investigations, Western diplomats said, and effectively squashed one in London by failing to cooperate with U.K. authorities, who had frozen $23.5 million of Mr. Zlochevsky\u2019s assets. In a speech in 2015, the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt, called the Ukrainian prosecutor \u201can obstacle\u201d to anticorruption efforts, and mentioned the U.K. case, which he said led to the escape of illicit assets.\n\nBut Ukraine\u2019s government was slow to fire Mr. Shokin, despite warnings from the International Monetary Fund and others that Western aid to the country would be cut off if didn\u2019t act. Mr. Biden, in one of his trips to Ukraine in 2016, pressured the government, telling them the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees. At an event at the Council on Foreign Relations two years later, Mr. Biden said he told Ukraine officials: \u201cIf the prosecutor is not fired you\u2019re not getting the money. Well, son of a bitch. He got fired.\u201d\n\nMr. Shokin denied any misconduct, and said he was fired illegally. In an interview with a Ukrainian new service, he blamed his dismissal on Ukrainian \u201cgrant-eaters\u201d\u2014nonprofit groups seeking to curry favor with the West.\n\nAnders Aslund, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council in Washington. D.C., said that Mr. Biden was making the same demands that other lenders to the Ukrainian government were making.\n\n\u201cEveryone in the Western community wanted Shokin sacked,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole G-7, the IMF, the EBRD, everybody was united that Shokin must go, and the spokesman for this was Joe Biden.\u201d\n\nWrite to Alan Cullison at alan.cullison@wsj.com", "description": "Joe Biden\u2019s involvement with Ukraine and his son\u2019s work in the country began when the former vice president was serving as the Obama administration\u2019s point man on relations with Ukraine and rooting out corruption.", "authors": ["Alan Cullison", "Alan.Cullison Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109701/social", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
