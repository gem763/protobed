Further, the bottom line was 19% higher than the year-ago figure.\n\nResults reflect First Horizon\u2019s improved loan portfolio and lower expenses. In addition, efficiency ratio contracted during the quarter, indicating increased profitability.\n\nHowever, shares of First Horizon declined 4% post earnings release, reflecting investors\u2019 concern over lower net interest income and worsening credit quality.\n\nAfter considering certain non-recurring items, net income available to common shareholders came in at $109.5 million, down 59% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nSegment wise, quarterly net income for regional banking climbed 4% year over year to $132.7 million.

Corporate segment incurred net loss of $36.3 million.\n\nRevenues Decline, Loans Rise, Costs Fall\n\nTotal revenues for the third quarter came in at $472.4 million, down 28% on a year-over-year basis.

Net interest margin shrunk 23 basis points (bps) to 3.21%. Also, non-interest income came in at $171.7 million, down 51%.\n\nNon-interest expenses increased 5% year over year to $307.7 million.\n\nEfficiency ratio was 65.14% compared with 66.55% in the year-ago quarter. It should be noted that a fall in the efficiency ratio indicates increase in profitability.\n\nTotal period-end loans, net of unearned income, totaled $31.3 billion, up 5% from the previous quarter. However, total period-end deposits were $31.9 billion, down 1%.\n\nCredit Quality Worsens\n\nAllowance for loan losses was up 4% year over year to $193.1 million. However, as a percentage of period-end loans on an annualized basis, allowance for loan losses was 0.62%, down 6 bps year over year.\n\nNonetheless, the quarter witnessed net charge-offs of $14.6 million compared with $1.5 million in the prior-year quarter.

Additionally, total capital ratio came in at 10.99%, down from 12.02%.\n\nOur Viewpoint\n\nContinued growth in loans is likely to be conducive to First Horizon\u2019s top-line performance. Further, improvement in the efficiency ratio is anticipated to support profitability. Also, prudent cost management supports bottom-line expansion. Nevertheless, rising provision for loan losses remains a drag.\n\nFirst Horizon National Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nFirst Horizon currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
