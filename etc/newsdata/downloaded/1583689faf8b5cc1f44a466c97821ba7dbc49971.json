With a Russian-backed insurgency in the east of his country, and the Crimea region seized by Vladimir Putin in 2014, Zelensky will have been eager to please his American counterpart, who had suspended vital military aid before their phone conversation. He says there was no pressure on him from Trump to do him the \u201cfavour\u201d he was asked for. Zelensky appeared at an awkward press conference with Trump in New York during the United Nations general assembly, looking particularly uncomfortable when the American suggested he take part in talks with Putin. AFP/Getty 6/19 Mike Pence The vice-president was not on the controversial July call to the Ukrainian president but did get a read-out later. However, Trump announced that Pence had had \u201cone or two\u201d phone conversations of a similar nature, dragging him into the crisis. Pence himself denies any knowledge of any wrongdoing and has insisted that there is no issue with Trump\u2019s actions. It has been speculated that Trump involved Pence as an insurance policy - if both are removed from power the presidency would go to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, something no Republican would allow. AP 7/19 Rick Perry Trump reportedly told a meeting of Republicans that he made the controversial call to the Ukrainian president at the urging of his own energy secretary, Rick Perry, and that he didn\u2019t even want to. The president apparently said that Perry wanted him to talk about liquefied natural gas - although there is no mention of it in the partial transcript of the phone call released by the White House. It is thought that Perry will step down from his role at the end of the year.

Trump says that Biden pressured Ukraine to sack a prosecutor who was investigating an energy company that Biden\u2019s son Hunter was on the board of, refusing to release US aid until this was done. However, pressure to fire the prosecutor came on a wide front from western countries. It is also believed that the investigation into the company, Burisma, had long been dormant.

Getty\n\nA criminal investigation of Mr Giuliani raises the stakes of the Ukraine scandal for the president, whose dealings with the country are already the subject of an impeachment inquiry. It is also a stark turn for Mr Giuliani, who now finds himself under scrutiny from the same US attorney\u2019s office he led in the 1980s, when he first rose to prominence as a tough-on-crime prosecutor and later ascended to two terms as mayor of New York.\n\nIt was unclear how far the investigation has progressed, and there was no indication that prosecutors in Manhattan have decided to file additional charges in the case. A spokeswoman for the US attorney in Manhattan, Geoffrey S Berman, declined to comment.\n\nMr Giuliani said that federal prosecutors had no grounds to charge him with foreign lobbying disclosure violations because he said he was acting on behalf of Mr Trump, not the Ukrainian prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, when he collected the information on Ms Yovanovitch and the others and relayed it to the US government and the news media.\n\n\u201cLook, you can try to contort anything into anything, but if they have any degree of objectivity or fairness, it would be kind of ridiculous to say I was doing it on Lutsenko\u2019s behalf when I was representing the president of the United States,\u201d Mr Giuliani said. Mr Lutsenko had chafed at Ms Yovanovitch\u2019s anti-corruption efforts and wanted her recalled from Kiev.\n\nMr Giuliani also said he was unaware of any investigation into him, and he defended the pressure campaign on Ukrainians, which he led, as legal and above board.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

But he re-emerged in the centre of the political stage last year, when Mr Trump retained him for the special counsel\u2019s investigation into Russian election interference.\n\nRussia\u2019s sabotage also ushered in a new focus at the Justice Department on enforcing the laws regulating foreign influence that had essentially sat dormant for a half-century and under which Mr Giuliani is now being investigated.\n\nMr Giuliani said that because Democrats had questioned his business consulting for foreign clients, his contracts explicitly say he does not lobby or act as an agent of foreigners.\n\nThrough his two associates who also worked to oust the ambassador, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, Mr Giuliani connected early this year with Mr Lutsenko, who served as Ukraine\u2019s top prosecutor until August. Mr Parnas and Mr Fruman had previously connected Mr Giuliani to Mr Lutsenko\u2019s predecessor, Viktor Shokin, late last year.\n\nMr Parnas had told people that Ms Yovanovitch was stymieing his efforts to pursue gas business in Ukraine. Mr Parnas also told people that one of his companies had paid Mr Giuliani hundreds of thousands of dollars for an unrelated US business venture, and Mr Giuliani said he advised Mr Parnas and Mr Fruman on a Ukrainian dispute.\n\nMr Lutsenko had sought to relay the information he had collected on Mr Trump\u2019s targets to US law enforcement agencies and saw Mr Giuliani as someone who could make that happen. Mr Giuliani and Mr Lutsenko initially spoke over the phone and then met in person in New York in January.\n\nMr Lutsenko initially asked Mr Giuliani to represent him, according to the former mayor, who said he declined because it would have posed a conflict with his work for the president. Instead, Mr Giuliani said, he interviewed Mr Lutsenko for hours, then had one of his employees \u2013 a \u201cprofessional investigator who works for my company\u201d \u2013 write memos detailing the Ukrainian prosecutors\u2019 claims about Ms Yovanovitch, Mr Biden and others.\n\nMr Giuliani said he provided those memos to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo this year and was told that the State Department passed the memos to the FBI. He did not say who told him.\n\nMr Giuliani said he also gave the memos to the columnist, John Solomon, who worked at the time for The Hill newspaper and published articles and videos critical of Ms Yovanovitch, the Bidens and other Trump targets. It was unclear to what degree Mr Giuliani\u2019s memos served as fodder for Mr Solomon, who independently interviewed Mr Lutsenko and other sources.\n\nMr Solomon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe lobbying disclosure law contains an exemption for legal work, and Mr Giuliani said his efforts to unearth information and push both for investigations in Ukraine and for news coverage of his findings originated with his defence of Mr Trump in the special counsel\u2019s investigation.\n\nHe acknowledged that his work morphed into a more general dragnet for dirt on Mr Trump\u2019s targets but said that it was difficult to separate those lines of inquiry from his original mission of discrediting the origins of the special counsel\u2019s investigation.\n\nMr Giuliani said Mr Lutsenko never specifically asked him to try to force Mr Yovanovitch\u2019s recall, saying he concluded himself that Mr Lutsenko probably wanted her fired because he had complained that she was stifling his investigations.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t say to me, \u2018I came here to get Yovanovitch fired.\u2019 He came here because he said he had been trying to transmit this information to your government for the past year, and had been unable to do it,\u201d Mr Giuliani said of his meeting in New York with Mr Lutsenko. \u201cI transmitted the information to the right people.\u201d\n\nThe president sought to distance himself earlier Friday from Mr Giuliani, saying he was uncertain when asked whether Mr Giuliani still represented him. \u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to Rudy,\u201d Mr Trump told reporters. \u201cI spoke to him yesterday quickly. He is a very good attorney, and he has been my attorney.\u201d\n\nMr Giuliani later said that he still represented Trump.\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "Federal prosecutors in New York City are investigating whether President Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani broke lobbying laws in his dealings in Ukraine, according to two people familiar with the inquiry.", "authors": ["Michael S Schmidt", "Ben Protess", "Kenneth P Vogel", "William K Rashbaum"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/12/08/rudy-giuliani-ukraine.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
