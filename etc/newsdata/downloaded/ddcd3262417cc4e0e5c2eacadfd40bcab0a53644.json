A progressive mansion tax on home sales over $2 million that went into effect on July 1 is largely blamed for the steep slowdown in agreed-to sales.\n\n\n\nSince the tax went into effect, pending deals over $4 million are down 27% compared to the same period last year, according to Olshan\u2019s calculation.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, total sales last week rang in at $80.81 million, about $12 million higher than the week prior but still fairly anemic for this time of year.\n\n\n\nThe most expensive deal last week was a triplex condo in a historic building on the Upper West Side, asking $12.8 million.\n\n\n\nThe nearly 5,000-square-foot home\u2014which includes five bedrooms and a garden terrace\u2014is located in the former St. Agnes Boys High School, a landmarked Beaux-Arts building that developers Tamarkin Co. and CL Investment Group are converting into 13 homes, called 555 West End Avenue.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: Bespoke Wine Events for the High-End Consumer\n\nThe second most expensive home in Manhattan to find a buyer was a condo, asking $10.495 million, at the riverside Tribeca development 70 Vestry St. The nearly 3,000-square-foot apartment at the Robert A.M.
