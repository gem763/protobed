Really we know it will be very difficult and we need to be very competitive in the 90 minutes.'\n\nAway from Arsenal - but not too far from Sheffield - is Gunners highly-rated forward Eddie Nketiah, who is currently on loan at Championship promotion hopefuls Leeds.\n\nHe struck a hat-trick for England Under-21s on Tuesday to highlight his obvious potential, but a lack of game time at Elland Road is beginning to prove a problem.\n\nSpeaking after his treble against Austria, Nketiah admitted: 'It's been disappointing for me not to start in the league, I went there to play games.'\n\nMeanwhile, the Arsenal boss had his say on Eddie Nketiah's game time at Leeds United\n\nWhen called upon for Leeds, the 20-year-old has impressed; scoring against Salford and Stoke in the Carabao Cup and in league wins over Brentford and Barnsley, but he was only listed as a substitute for the league fixture with Birmingham this weekend, coming on at half-time.\n\n'Firstly I respect his coach (Marcelo Bielsa) and his decision. I think he is going to play more. He is going to deserve it,' Emery added.\n\n'Each match he plays with Leeds and the national team is important for him and important for Arsenal also because we want him to get confidence and take experience and use it in the future for us.\n\n'He is doing it. He is maybe playing less than we want, but I am sure he will play more.'", "description": "Arsenal boss Unai Emery said of Monday's opponents, Sheffield United: 'They were in Premier League and they lost that in 2007, but they came back with big motivation.'", "authors": ["Pa Sport Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/23/19938976-0-image-a-27_1571523253481.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
