Pence replied that had he never discussed the Bidens with Zelensky.\n\nWhen pushed on whether he knew as a member of the administration about Trump\u2019s request, Pence responded: \u201cWhat I can tell you is, all of our discussions internally, between the president and our team, and our contacts and my office with Ukraine, were entirely focused on the broader issues of the lack of European support and corruption.\u201d\n\nPence also emphasized a Trump defense that Zelensky did not feel pressured to investigate the Bidens. The timing of Trump\u2019s call, along with a sudden suspension of U.S. military aid to Ukraine, raised suspicions of a quid pro quo. Trump\u2019s critics have postulated that the president held up vital help for Ukraine to hold back Russian aggression in exchange for dirt on a presidential rival.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be very clear that President Zelensky said there was no pressure,\u201d Pence said, according to a report from the press pool traveling with him. \u201cI think his words were, no one pushed. And a clear reading of the transcript shows that there was no quid pro quo in the president\u2019s call with President Zelensky.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have argued that regardless of any carrot or stick Trump may have used, the fact that he asked for foreign assistance that could help him in a U.S. election was grounds for impeachment. The Trump administration has also refused to cooperate with House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry, a move that could result in articles of impeachment against the president for obstructing a congressional investigation.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/14/73/b1ae5dff4b7e99deb65e8aab07ab/191009-pence-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
