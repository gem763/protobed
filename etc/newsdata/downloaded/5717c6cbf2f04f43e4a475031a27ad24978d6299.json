Yet even if a Lee-Abe meeting is arranged, the sources continued, there\u2019s \u201ca high chance\u201d it would only last about 15 to 20 minutes.The sources said Lee has told people around him several times that he sees the enthronement ceremony as \u201cone of several important opportunities\u201d to mend strained ties between Seoul and Tokyo. Abe has not held any one-on-one meetings with President Moon Jae-in or Lee since Japan announced export restrictions against Korea on July 1.Lee\u2019s office is also considering a meeting between Yoshihide Suga, Japan\u2019s chief cabinet secretary, who\u2019s considered the second-highest official in the Abe administration, according to the sources.Last Friday, in response to a statement from Pyongyang\u2019s Foreign Ministry that North Korea may resume intercontinental ballistic missile tests, Suga said that Tokyo, Washington and Seoul were \u201cclosely interacting with each other on several levels\u201d and that Japan hopes to support the Korean Peninsula denuclearization process between Washington and Pyongyang - which could mean that Lee and Suga may reach some common ground in their talks on North Korea.All eyes will be on Lee to see if he manages to make any breakthrough with Tokyo as the Nov. 22 deadline for the termination of the bilateral intelligence-sharing pact, the General Security of Military Information Agreement (Gsomia), nears.Local media had wondered whether Moon would be visiting Japan for the emperor\u2019s enthronement ceremony, but sources with information about the decision-making process said while Tokyo did send an invitation for the ceremony to the Korean Embassy in Japan - like it did for all the other countries it has diplomatic ties with - it did not specifically ask for Moon to attend. As Tokyo doesn\u2019t appear to be so eager about Moon attending the ceremony, the sources said, the government thought it would make Moon look bad to travel to Japan for a 15-minute meeting with Abe.BY BAEK MIN-JEONG, LEE YU-JEONG AND LEE SUNG-EUN [lee.sungeun@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/13212339.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
