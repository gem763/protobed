Brown, who is visually impaired, was arrested at Heathrow last month after a protest which saw some Extinction Rebellion activists try to fly a drone near the airport. The 54-year-old, who won a bronze medal at London 2012, glued himself to the top of a British Airways Embraer 190 jet.\n\nAGGRESSIVE CLIMATE CHANGE PROTESTS HIT MAJOR CITIES IN EUROPE, AUSTRALIA, MORE THAN 300 ARRESTED\n\n\u201cHere I am on top of a f****** airplane at City Airport. I hate heights, I\u2019m s******* myself, I managed to get on the roof. I am so shaky,\u201d he said in a Facebook video.\n\n\u201cThis is all about the climate and ecological crisis, we\u2019re protesting against government inaction on climate and ecological breakdown. They declare a climate emergency and then do nothing about it.\n\n\u201cIn fact they go the opposite direction, they sanction the expansion of airports, Heathrow, Bristol and others. We can\u2019t let this go on, we can\u2019t have our cake and eat it.\u201d\n\nHe later noticed security were approaching and said, \u201cOh good security are coming. I hope they don\u2019t take too long because this is f****** scary.\u201d\n\nHe was eventually removed. A spokeswoman for British Airways said, \u201cWe are investigating what happened as a matter of urgency.\u201d Meanwhile another protester managed to ground a flight from London City Airport to Dublin today \u2014 to the fury of the passengers on board. The Aer Lingus flight this morning was on the runway and about to take off when a smartly dressed man stood up and gave a lecture on climate change.\n\nFilming himself on his phone, the man said, \u201cI don\u2019t wish to travel with you, but I don\u2019t wish to get off. I\u2019m extremely sorry for the inconvenience.\u201d\n\nFurious passengers responded saying, \u201cYou\u2019re not sorry at all.\u201d As their flight was held up, travelers pleaded with crew to remove the bespectacled man from the plane.\n\nContinuing to address those on board, the man said, \u201cWe have two generations of human civilization left if we carry on doing what we are doing.\u201d\n\nAnother passenger then asked him, \u201cWhy are you filming yourself?\u201d\n\nThe man was later seen being led away from the aircraft by police officers. The flight, scheduled to depart at 9.40am, was delayed by 10 minutes.\n\nPassenger Warren Swalbe tweeted, \u201cJust about to take from London City airport. Our flight was infiltrated by a climate change protester.\u201d\n\nNicholas Watt, the political editor of BBC Newsnight, wrote, \u201cMy flight from London City airport to Dublin has just been grounded by a climate change protester. On runway and about to take off when smartly dressed man in late middle age stood up with iPhone to deliver lecture on climate change up and down aisle.\n\n\u201cCabin crew calmly and very politely asked protester to resume his seat. Politely but persistently he declined and proceeded to deliver his lecture on climate change in aisle. Plane was at the end of runway. So the pilot taxied back to gate where plane was met by throng of police. They came on board and escorted the protester off the plane.\n\n\u201cThe final irony of the climate protest on our flight. We cannot take off until we have taken on extra fuel \u2026 to replace the fuel used up during the protest, our pilot notes with humor.\u201d\n\nAer Lingus said the passenger was removed \u201cdue to disruptive behavior on board\u201d and a full security check of the aircraft was completed before the plane departed.\n\nThe climate change group started their three-day \u201cHong Kong-style\u201d shut down of London City Airport this morning, gluing themselves to the terminal building and dancing on a roof \u2014 but ultimately failing to cancel flights.\n\nThe latest protest is against the climate impact of flying and the government\u2019s ongoing support of airport expansion. Hundreds of environmentalists attempted to block the entrance to the airport from the DLR by sitting together on the ground and singing \u201cFly today, gone tomorrow\u201d.\n\nActivist Phil Kingston, 83, was among those arrested \u2014 the third time he has been arrested as part of Extinction Rebellion protests in the past week.\n\nProtesters were seen being dragged out the airport by officers after failing to break through security into the terminal. One was heard saying, \u201cPlease stop you\u2019re hurting me.\u201d\n\nOne activist climbed onto part of the roof of the terminal building where he was cheered by fellow protesters. Standing on the roof, he bellowed down, \u201cShut the airport down! Rebellion!\u201d\n\nHe then danced on the roof as a live band played clarinet music below.\n\nThose arriving for flights were redirected to a second terminal entrance by security workers and were not allowed to enter the building without showing their boarding cards first.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nTaxi driver Jason Lempiere said that the protests had disrupted his work in and around the city. \u201cIt\u2019s disturbing everyone\u2019s everyday life \u2014 working, travel in and out of the airport. Yeah, have a voice, but not disrupt people\u2019s lives like this,\u201d he said.\n\nThis report was originally published in The Sun.", "description": "An Extinction Rebellion protester glued himself to the top of a British Airways plane at London City Airport today.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/new.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
