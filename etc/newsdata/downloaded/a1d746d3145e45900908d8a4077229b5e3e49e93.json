The #PioliOut hashtag quickly trended worldwide on Twitter thanks to the angry reaction from Milan fans unhappy at lack of trophies.", "description": "Milan (AFP) \u2013 Fallen Italian giants AC Milan have appointed Stefano Pioli as their new coach a day after his predecessor Marco Giampaolo was sacked", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/09/31fcc5_inter-milan-fiorentina-lazio-coach-stefano-pioli-has-agreed-terms-ac-milan-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
