CBP\u2019s request includes a request for information on camera durability, cloud storage for the footage, information security, redaction of personal information, and other technical specifications.\n\nBorder Patrol agents do not currently wear body cameras. A bill introduced in the House of Representatives in February would require them to do so. The agency tested them last year at nine locations.\n\nFacial recognition used on footage taken by law enforcement has proven controversial in the past. California banned the use of facial recognition software on video from police body cameras on Oct. 8. Several cities around the country have banned its use by municipal authorities altogether.\n\nCBP, meanwhile, has expanded its use of facial recognition in other areas. The agency already uses the technology to identify and track travelers at more than a dozen international airports in the U.S., at checkpoints along the U.S.-Mexico border, and at major ports.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "description": "The agency is interested in wearable systems that can match faces to databases.", "authors": ["Blake Montgomery"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_3553,w_6317,x_0,y_42/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571337622/GettyImages-1158345705_bixicq", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
