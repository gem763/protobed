But as it starts another major rebellion this week, it might find the challenge ahead is even greater.\n\nExtinction Rebellion\u2019s April protests were an enormous success. Together with the BBC\u2019s Attenborough documentary and the school climate strikes, they created a surge in public concern about the environment. The climate emergency is now established in the top five most important issues facing the UK today, at around the same level as the economy. Since the April protests, the government has legislated for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and Labour is moving towards a much more ambitious target.\n\nFew people could have predicted that a two-week blockade of central London would be met with so much support or have such political impact. So the natural question is whether a new round of protests can repeat the success.\n\nHow Extinction Rebellion put the world on red alert Read more\n\nThe fact this month\u2019s rebellion won\u2019t be such a novelty could make things harder. It\u2019s the difficult-second-album problem: repeat your material and you\u2019re boring; innovate and you may lose the magic. And with the police preparing to move faster against protesters this time, it\u2019s inevitable that opponents of climate action will call for tougher law enforcement.\n\nBut difficult though it will be for the protests to recapture the novelty and public support of the April protests, that is far from the biggest problem. Ironically, the greatest threat to the movement is its apparent success over the past six months. If the public believe the protesters have already won, continued street blockades could look unnecessary.\n\nIt\u2019s here that public opinion turns from being helpful to being a problem for Extinction Rebellion. The overwhelming majority want action to limit climate change and support a net-zero target; most even support bringing that target forward from the government\u2019s current date.\n\nPlay Video Extinction Rebellion protesters stage 'die-in' outside London fashion week venue \u2013 video\n\nBut most people\u2019s attention stops there. Few people pay attention to the details or punish politicians who don\u2019t have a plan. This means there\u2019s not much incentive for politicians to go beyond simply pledging to tackle the climate crisis with ambitious-sounding targets.\n\nTake the government\u2019s net-zero law. It would just about make the UK compliant with the Paris agreement\u2019s goal of avoiding dangerous warming (although it is too slow for that if you consider the UK to have a responsibility to clean up faster than less- affluent countries). But the government wasn\u2019t even on course to meet its old, weaker target; we are nowhere near meeting the new one.\n\nOr take Labour\u2019s conference motion to meet the net-zero target by 2030. This is close to Extinction Rebellion\u2019s demand, but the party shouldn\u2019t get much credit for environmental saviourhood until it shows how it would deliver. Scrapping its support for Heathrow expansion will be hard enough for Labour \u2013 with the party\u2019s union funders firmly behind more tarmac and more planes \u2013 and that would be among the simplest of the policy switches needed to decarbonise in 11 years.\n\nSo apparent allies of the protesters can actually be a threat to faster climate action. Emission-cutting pledges can be useful \u2013 but if they aren\u2019t combined with a plan they can undermine the cause by making it seem like the battle has been won. The next wave of Extinction Rebellion protests will be a success if it forces climate-friendly politicians to show their proposals. When a politician says they will stop the climate crisis from escalating, the first question that needs to be asked is: \u201chow?\u201d\n\nAnswering that question requires politicians to expose the fact that avoiding dangerous warming will be disruptive and difficult. Many people will look for reasons to find a way out and so the debate may return to \u201cwhy?\u201d But this is Extinction Rebellion\u2019s specialist subject: its explanation of the climate emergency may be terrifying but it is well-evidenced.\n\nThis challenge \u2013 to force apparently \u201cgreen\u201d politicians to come with a plan \u2013 is daunting. But few people would have imagined that a climate change protest could occupy central London and be met with widespread public backing. The protesters might just be the people who can do it.\n\n\u2022 Leo Barasi is the author of The Climate Majority: Apathy and Action in an Age of Nationalism, published by New Internationalist", "description": "The challenge this week is to force \u2018green\u2019 politicians into concrete proposals, says activist Leo Barasi", "authors": ["Leo Barasi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3807c13ab33299519664601a765ff0697ca3dd67/0_233_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=634aec2e578814009d15d1d3b749af47", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
