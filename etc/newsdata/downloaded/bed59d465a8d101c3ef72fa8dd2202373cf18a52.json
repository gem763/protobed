The moves will help trim the pension shortfall by $5 billion to $8 billion and reduce GE\u2019s industrial net debt by as much as $6 billion.\n\nGE\u2019s pension deficit ranks among the worst in corporate America, complicating Culp\u2019s efforts to help the Boston-based company regain its footing. The CEO, who took the helm a year ago, has said debt remains one of the thorniest problems, alongside a slumping power business and lingering insurance liabilities.\n\nGE rose 1.4% to $8.69 before regular trading in New York. The shares advanced 18% this year through Friday, matching the S&P 500 Index.\n\nGE, which closed its pension plan to new entrants in 2012, will offer a lump-sum payment to eligible former employees who haven\u2019t started receiving their monthly pension payments.\n\n\u201cReturning GE to a position of strength has required us to make several difficult decisions, and today\u2019s decision to freeze the pension is no exception,\u201d GE\u2019s chief human resources officer, Kevin Cox, said in the statement.\n\nAbout 700 employees will also have supplementary pension benefits frozen, GE said. The moves will take effect Jan. 1, 2021. GE had 283,000 employees worldwide at the end of last year, including about 97,000 in the U.S.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Richard Clough in New York at rclough9@bloomberg.net;Frank Connelly in Paris at fconnelly@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Brendan Case at bcase4@bloomberg.net, Tony Robinson\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- General Electric Co. took a bold step to cut the debt hampering Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp\u2019s effort to turn around the struggling manufacturer, freezing pension benefits for about 20,000 employees in the U.S.The company also plans to pre-fund $4 billion to $5 billion of its estimated", "authors": ["Richard Clough", "Frank Connelly"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3VSY_fpvc43dOVzm1qf4jw--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/4d4ff86b202c4568e3f6a1ce365ed96b", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
