Md. poll finds", "language": "en", "text": "A slimmer 51 percent majority of Marylanders support Gov. Larry Hogan\u2019s (R) plan to add express toll lanes to Interstate 270 and the state\u2019s part of the Capital Beltway, according to the poll conducted earlier this month. Support drops to a combined 45 percent in Montgomery and Prince George\u2019s counties, where the highways are located.\n\nAD\n\nThat\u2019s a drop from 55 percent of residents in both counties who supported the toll lanes in a Post-Schar School poll in May. However, it is higher than in a 2018 Post-U. Md. poll that found a combined 41 percent of registered voters in Montgomery and Prince George\u2019s supported express toll lanes. The 2018 poll question did not specify that the highways\u2019 existing lanes would remain free.\n\nAD\n\nThe latest poll, conducted by The Washington Post and the University of Maryland\u2019s Center for Democracy and Civic Engagement, finds support for another Chesapeake Bay crossing spans party lines. A 58 percent majority of registered Republicans favor the idea, as do 53 percent of Democrats and 57 percent of independents.\n\nSupport for adding a third span to the Bay Bridge ranges from 52 percent in Baltimore city and county combined, 55 percent in Prince George\u2019s and Montgomery counties, 63 percent in Anne Arundel and Howard counties together and 55 percent among residents in other parts of the state.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about infrastructure \u2014 that\u2019s something that seems to be neglected around the country today,\u201d said Jeff Davis, 63, a retired mail carrier who lives in Upper Marlboro.\n\nAD\n\nIn addition to an expanded Bay Bridge and toll lanes, Davis said, he\u2019d like to see better mass transit options to reduce traffic.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about moving people and commerce,\u201d Davis said. \u201cWe spend so much time in traffic around here. I think we need a comprehensive transportation system.\u201d\n\nOverall, Marylanders rank transportation as one of the state\u2019s less pressing problems, with 10 percent citing road and transit issues as their chief concern. That is about even with those who consider taxes and affordable housing as the top issue and below those who name crime (22 percent) and public education (20 percent).\n\nIn follow-up interviews, respondents had plenty of opinions about how the state should alleviate traffic congestion, which studies have shown is some of the worst in the country.\n\nAD\n\nSome said massive delays related to the recent start of a two-year deck rehabilitation project on the Bay Bridge\u2019s westbound span have highlighted the need for an additional crossing. A spokesman for the Maryland Transportation Authority, which operates the bridge, also said recently that the eastbound span will need lane closures for similar work within the next five to 10 years.\n\nAD\n\nDeirdre Harash, 53, of Stevensville, said she\u2019s \u201c100 percent\u201d for building an additional span. She said she lives near the bridge\u2019s eastern end in Queen Anne\u2019s County and uses it several times a week to shop and visit family. Her husband crosses it daily to commute to Bowie.\n\n\u201cThe volume of traffic that uses the bridge on a daily basis has just grown tremendously over the last 20 years,\u201d said Harash, a patient service coordinator for a cardiology practice in Stevensville.\n\nAD\n\nHarash said the state needs to help local roads that get jammed during bridge backups, which she said have become a \u201cnightmare\u201d since the repairs started in late September. Her husband\u2019s 40-minute commute can take 1 \u00bd hours, she said, and bridge-bound traffic using local roads to circumvent Route 50 has increased \u201c20-fold.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother bridge needs to be built,\u201d Harash said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way around it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe state is conducting a $5 million federally required study to assess the potential environmental impacts of building a third span. It would augment the original two-lane span, built in 1952, that carries eastbound traffic and the three-lane westbound span that opened in 1973. Both are about four miles long.\n\nAD\n\nState officials haven\u2019t said how much a new crossing would cost or how the state would pay for it. However, a top state official told the Baltimore Sun in 2018 that it could cost up to $10 billion. The poll did not ask whether Marylanders would be willing to pay higher tolls or taxes to fund a bridge expansion but instead whether they would support the project when \u201cconsidering state government budget priorities.\u201d\n\nDouglas Boline, 61, a federal worker who lives in Annapolis, said there\u2019s \u201cnot enough bridge\u201d to meet the cross-bay traffic demand.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care where it goes,\u201d said Boline, who sees the backups on the western shore. \u201cI just want more bridge.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSome residents say an additional span shouldn\u2019t come before other state needs.\n\nVinay Sharma, 28, a lawyer who lives in Columbia, said he recently got stuck in a two-hour bridge backup while heading home from a weekend wedding in Cambridge. He said he appreciates that some motorists rely on it more regularly to commute, but he believes the state should first address more pressing issues, such as improving public education and reducing crime in Baltimore.\n\n\u201cTo me, traffic on the Bay Bridge is part of life,\u201d said Sharma, who grew up in Montgomery County. \u201cYou plan for it, you deal with it, and then you enjoy Ocean City or wherever you\u2019re going.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear why support for Hogan\u2019s plan to add toll lanes to I-270 and the Beltway dropped compared to the May poll.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe proposal has come under criticism from environmental groups and leaders in Montgomery and Prince George\u2019s, who say widening the Beltway east of I-270 would destroy homes and environmentally sensitive parkland while doing too little to encourage mass transit use.\n\nSupport for the toll lane plan varies according to income levels. Nearly 6 in 10 residents with a household income of $100,000 or more favor the lanes. But support falls to half for those making $50,000 to $100,000 and to about 4 in 10 for those earning less than $50,000.\n\nBoline, of Annapolis, said he supports adding toll lanes to I-270 as long as they reach Frederick and eventually beyond to Hagerstown. Having lived in Damascus, he said, he knows that upper I-270 is \u201ca mess.\u201d He said he\u2019s fine with the state charging tolls because motorists would have the option of not using the toll lanes.\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s what you need to build the lanes, then fine,\u201d Boline said. \u201cThey need it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOthers said they were concerned that many motorists would be priced out, especially if the Maryland tolls reached $30 to $40 and more, as they have at peak times on express lanes in Northern Virginia.\n\nLisa Tompkins-Brown, who lives in Silver Spring, said she\u2019s \u201cvery much against\u201d toll lanes in Maryland. They might be handy for her commute to Tysons, she said, but any toll above $5 would be too expensive.\n\n\u201cI worry about people who have lower or more moderate incomes,\u201d said Tompkins-Brown, 50, a health strategist. \u201cThey\u2019d still be stuck in traffic while those who are more affluent can pay the tolls. It just increases the divide between the haves and the have-nots.\u201d\n\nIdette Brumbaugh, 53, a registered nurse who lives in Damascus, said she\u2019s concerned about the economic fairness of express toll lanes but believes motorists need an alternative to sitting in traffic.\n\n\u201cI like convenience,\u201d Brumbaugh said, \u201cand I\u2019m willing to pay for convenience.\u201d\n\nThe poll was conducted by phone Oct. 9-14 among a random sample of 860 Maryland residents. The overall results have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.\n\nScott Clement contributed to this report.", "description": "A slim majority favors adding express toll lanes to the Capital Beltway and Interstate 270.", "authors": ["Katherine Shaver", "Reporter Covering Urban Planning", "Transportation Issues", "Emily Guskin", "Polling Analyst At The Washington Post Specializing In Public Opinion About Politics", "Elections", "Public Policy."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/IaHOYEJApmDZFRs_6qgLwobl_Xk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MGBRO2HLWUI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
