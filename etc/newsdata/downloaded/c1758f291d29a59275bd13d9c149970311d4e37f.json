Breck made an initial appearance in Clark County Superior Court, the Columbian newspaper reports . Police say Breck killed a 75-year-old man and wounded two women Thursday in the lobby of a 15-story senior living building in Vancouver, then barricaded himself in his apartment before surrendering.\n\nAccording to court documents, the shooting stemmed from a dispute Breck had with the man. Authorities say one of the women shot used to be Breck's caregiver. Court documents say Breck had offered her money to become his mistress, she refused and he later fired her.\n\nAuthorities say the man who was killed had told Breck on Wednesday to stop spreading rumors about the woman.\n\nA PeaceHealth Southwest Medical Center spokeswoman said Friday that one of the women was treated and released while the other has been transferred to another hospital after receiving lifesaving care.\n\nThe judge ordered Breck held without bail after a prosecutor argued Breck was a substantial threat to the community. Breck's arraignment was set for Oct. 10.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nInformation from: The Columbian, http://www.columbian.com", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
