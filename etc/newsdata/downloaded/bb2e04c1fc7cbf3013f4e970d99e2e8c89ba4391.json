People always ask me about sexuality and all those things, right from the early days, but I couldn\u2019t fall in love with a man the same way as I have with Mary.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe concluded: \u2018All my lovers asked me why they couldn\u2019t replace Mary, but it\u2019s simply impossible.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
