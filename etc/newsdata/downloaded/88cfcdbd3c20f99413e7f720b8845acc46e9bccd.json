REUTERS/Washington Alves/File Photo\n\nThe governance standards would help ensure independent reviews of dams and adequate disclosure of risks, said Tom Butler, president of the International Council on Mining and Metals.\n\n\u201cThe engineers know what they\u2019re doing with these things but the implementation and the management and the change management, that all involves humans,\u201d Butler told Reuters in an interview in Brazil.\n\n\u201cTherefore it involves governance and that\u2019s where there\u2019s potential for things to go wrong if the governance is weak or the right hand is not talking to the left.\u201d\n\nA draft version \u201cis almost ready to go out\u201d and is expected by late September or early October, Butler had earlier told a mining conference in Belo Horizonte, about 20 miles (30 km) from the site of January\u2019s disaster.\n\nThe dam rupture in the town of Brumadinho killed nearly 250 people, sparking a push to establish global rules for building and inspection of such facilities, which contain the muddy detritus from mining iron ore, gold, copper and other minerals.\n\nThat collapse came less than four years after another at a joint venture of Vale and BHP Group (BHP.AX), which are both Council members, Butler said.\n\nAn inquiry showed one factor behind the collapse was a loss of know-how over the structure\u2019s lifespan of more than 40 years, he added.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to make sure you transfer that knowledge and I think the industry recognizes that\u2019s a critical part of it we haven\u2019t been getting right,\u201d Butler said.\n\nWhile the cause of the Brumadinho disaster is still under review, some experts have suggested governance failings at the miner are partly to blame. In February, Vale\u2019s chief financial officer said senior executives had never been shown internal security documents indicating the dam was at risk of collapse.\n\nThe ICMM represents about a third of the mining industry but Butler said the standards, being drawn up by a panel of eight members with expertise on tailings, health, risk and law, could influence the wider sector.\n\nA public consultation period will follow the release of the draft, with the new standards likely to be finalized and disseminated in the first quarter of 2020, he said.\n\nPanel members visited Brazil in July and more recently, British Colombia, the site of a 2014 breach at Imperial Metals Corp\u2019s (III.TO) Mount Polley Mine, which sent billions of gallons of wastewater and sludge into waterways.", "description": "New safety standards being drawn up by a global mining industry panel will include rules to better define management accountability after Vale SA's January tailings dam disaster, a top industry official said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Christian Plumb", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428790582&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A1NL", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
