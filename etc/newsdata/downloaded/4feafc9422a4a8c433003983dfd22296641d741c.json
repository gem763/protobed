France recorded its highest ever temperature of 114\u00b0F (46\u00b0C) this summer\n\nData analysed from weather records with at least 40 years of historical numbers found that national records had been broken across much of Europe, the BBC revealed.\n\nIntense heatwaves hit the UK, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany and the Netherlands, which all reported new all-time highs in July.\n\nNotably, France saw its highest temperature ever \u2013 114.8\u00b0F (46\u00b0C) in July \u2013 which also marked the first time the mercury had passed 113\u00b0F (45\u00b0C) there.\n\nThe Dutch national statistics agency, CBS, showed record-breaking temperatures across the continent may have killed 400 people in the Netherlands in a single week.\n\nA total of 2,964 people died during the week commencing July 22, marking a 15 per cent spike compared to an average summer week in the country.\n\nJuly was the hottest month ever recorded worldwide.\n\nDr Robert Rohde, lead scientist at Berkeley Earth told the BBC: 'Some places in Europe have histories of weather observations going back more than 150 years, and yet still saw new all-time record highs.'\n\nFormal review by climate agencies is to be carried out, which may discredit anomalies in the readings.\n\nBusy Brighton beach as Britain experienced some of its hottest ever temperatures for July\n\nFor the first time since records began topped 40\u00b0Celsius (104\u00b0F) in the Netherlands on July 25 (pictured) and in the same week 400 people may have died from the heatwave\n\nOver 30 hottest temperature records were topped in the US and 10 were set in Japan, where 11 people died during heatwaves.\n\nDr Rohde explained that the frequency of new all-time high records has increased due to the 'earth warming'.\n\nHe said: 'In the past, we would usually only see about 2 per cent of weather stations recording a new record high in any given year.\n\n'But, recently, we sometimes see years, like 2019, with 5 per cent or more of the weather stations recording a new all-time record high.'\n\nPeople swim in the sunshine in the Yorkshire countryside as temperatures soared in July\n\nMost records broken were made in 2010 or 2003.\n\nDr Friederike Otto, director of the Environmental Change Institute at the University of Oxford, said studies show that the extreme heatwaves in Western Europe have been brought on by human activities.\n\nShe told the BBC: 'This July 2019 heatwave was so extreme over continental Western Europe that the observed magnitudes would have been extremely unlikely without climate change.'", "description": "Intense heatwaves hit the UK, Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany and the Netherlands which all reported new record highs in July.
