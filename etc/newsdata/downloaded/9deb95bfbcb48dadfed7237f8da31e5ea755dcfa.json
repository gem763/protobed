We are asking them to make additional efforts,\" a French official said. \"Negotiation cannot be opened in October 2019, we will need to reassess the situation somewhere in 2020.\"\n\nUnanimity among the 28 member states is required to launch accession talks.\n\nEU ministers will discuss the matter again in Luxembourg on Tuesday before national leaders meet in Brussels for a summit on Oct.17-18. The move was already delayed repeatedly.\n\n\"This is very frustrating for most of the member states. Our credibility is at stake,\" said a diplomat from a country willing to open the doors to the Western Balkan candidates.\n\n\"North Macedonia and Albania have done a lot. Yes, a lot more remains to be done but opening membership talks is just the first step, the process would take years and they would have to fulfill all the criteria before they are allowed in.\"\n\nSources said the Netherlands and Denmark were also clearly opposed to Albania's bid when EU ambassadors discussed the matter behind closed doors in Brussels on Thursday, though the Dutch have signaled potential flexibility on North Macedonia.\n\nDutch Foreign Minister Stef Blok said on Tuesday Skopje needed to pass legislation to set up an independent public prosecution body. \"For the Netherlands that would have to pass in order to open accession talks,\" he said.\n\n(Additional reporting by Stephanie van den Berg, Writing by Gabriela Baczynska; Editing by Gareth Jones)", "description": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - France told its European Union peers this week it was against launching membership negotiations with North Macedonia and Albania for now, diplomatic sources told Reuters, casting a shadow over the countries' ambition to integrate with the West.", "authors": ["Gabriela Baczynska"], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
