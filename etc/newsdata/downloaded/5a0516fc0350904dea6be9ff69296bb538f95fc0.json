His initial foray was modest, by current standards; he paid $8.6 million dollars to acquire National Indemnity. On the surface, it didn\u2019t look like such a great deal. National was worth $6.7 million, so Buffett paid a premium of $1.9 million to control the company. But controlling the company was not his main goal.\n\nWhat Buffett was really after was National\u2019s float \u2013 the cash the company controlled as a result of the natural lag between receiving premiums and paying policies. At the time, National Indemnity controlled $19.4 million in float \u2013 that is, it had collected that much in premiums and had not yet received customer claims against it. In controlling the company, Buffett controlled the float. Instead of putting it into safe, low-yield investments \u2013 as insurers usually did \u2013 Buffett started on his current path, of investing other people\u2019s money into higher-yielding investments. The capital was the customer\u2019s, of course, but the profits on it were Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s (BRK.B \u2013 Get Report).\n\nNational Indemnity remains, to this day, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway. Buffett prefers owning or controlling insurance companies outright, rather than investing in the stock, as ownership comes with control of the float \u2013 and Berkshire\u2019s float totaled $114.5 billion at the end of 2017. Some of that money, however, gets invested in insurance companies, and there are currently two insurers in Buffett\u2019s portfolio.\n\nWe\u2019ve dipped into TipRanks\u2019 Stock Screener database to find out where some of Buffett\u2019s favorite \u2018float\u2019 stocks stand in today\u2019s market.\n\nGlobe Life, Inc.\n\nFormerly known as Torchmark, the company changed its name and stock ticker in August of this year to become Globe Life (GL \u2013 Get Report). Globe Life is a holding company, owning in its turn a variety of life and health insurance providers. It\u2019s a microcosm of Buffett\u2019s own attitude toward the insurance industry \u2013 control the companies that sell the policies, and in your turn control the float.\n\nGlobe Life, as an investment, is a good fit for Warren Buffett. He has held the stock since 2001, and has enjoyed the 10.5% annualized return it has brought in. GL pays out a modest but reliable dividend of 0.73%, paying 69 cents per share annually. The stock has appreciated 84.7% in the last five years, and is up 27% year-to-date.\n\nSo, the long-term fundamentals of the stock look healthy, which is what Buffett has always said he looks for in an investment. In an oft-quoted quip, Buffett says, \u201cOur favorite investment horizon is forever.\u201d The most recent review, however, doesn\u2019t rate the stock as highly. GL holds a Moderate Sell rating, and the average price target of $86 suggests a 9% downside from the current share price of $94.\n\nDespite the low rating, GL continues to be a solid performer in its industry. In its last reported quarter, the company showed EPS of $1.67, a 1.2% positive surprise from the $1.65 forecast and a 5% increase from the year-ago quarter. Sales were also robust, adding 4% in Q2. In short, the fundamentals show why Buffett continues to own over 6.35 million shares of GL, worth more than $568 million.\n\nTravelers Companies, Inc.\n\nWith Travelers, we get to the second largest casualty insurer in the US, and the third largest underwriter of personal insurance. Travelers (TRV \u2013 Get Report) is an industry leader and blue chip giant of the stock market, and the company\u2019s stock performance shows why Buffett has invested over $890 million in 5.9 million shares.\n\nTRV is up 22% year-to-date, notably higher than the S&P 500\u2019s 19% gain, and the five-year gain is an impressive 75%. Like most of the stocks that Buffett keeps, TRV pays out a dividend, 2.23% with an annualized payment of $3.28 per share. Travelers has been a Berkshire investment since 2018, but expect Buffett\u2019s company to hold this stake for the long haul. Berkshire Hathaway is already Travelers\u2019 seventh largest investor, with 2.3% of the company\u2019s stock.\n\nA weak second quarter pushed TRV shares down in the analysts\u2019 estimation, and the stock currently gets a Hold from the consensus rating. 5-star analyst Mark Dwelle, of RBC Capital, described the company\u2019s situation after the Q2 report: \u201cThe quarter was weighed down by higher commercial auto severity and non-catastrophe weather-related claims, even though neither is seen as a significant drag for Travelers' future quarters.\u201d Dwelle gave TRV a hold, but raised his price target by 10% to $160. His target suggests an 8.8% upside to the stock.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Earlier this year marked 52 years since Warren Buffett first bought into the insurance industry.
