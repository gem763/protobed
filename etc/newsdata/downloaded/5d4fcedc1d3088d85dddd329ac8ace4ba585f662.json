GOP senators criticize the impeachment process, while avoiding extended discussions of the president\u2019s underlying behavior. Fifty of 53 Republican senators have joined Lindsey Graham\u2019s call for the House to authorize its impeachment inquiry.\n\nRepublican opinion of Trump has to turn squarely against him for impeachment to succeed. What are the chances of this happening? Not great.\n\nSamuelson acknowledges that public opinion is sticky. People don\u2019t like changing their minds. \u201cPeople define themselves by their beliefs. It\u2019s who they are and want to be.\u201d Their views of Trump are like hardened concrete. \u201cAt least for his core supporters, Trump has seemed remarkably adept at controlling the narrative of his presidency.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSamuelson offers two examples of shifts in public opinion: same-sex marriage and marijuana legalization. The public changed its mind about both. But advocates of impeachment shouldn\u2019t get their hopes up. The comparison between cultural issues and political figures is misguided.\n\nThe timeline for cultural change is much longer than the political calendar. It took decades for the public to accept same-sex marriage and pot. The rising generation is responsible for much of the difference in attitude.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHouse Democrats hope to vote on impeachment by the end of 2019. Absent some technological breakthrough, there is not enough time for a pro-conviction GOP youth movement to be born, come of age, and displace Senate Republicans.\n\nThe Democratic strategy, Samuelson writes, \u201cis premised on the hope that further shocking revelations will alter the political climate. Trump\u2019s image will be so shattered that Republican senators will feel free to join the revolt against him.\u201d This assumes the aim of the Democratic strategy is Trump\u2019s removal, and not simply weakening him ahead of reelection while putting at-risk Republican senators like Susan Collins and Cory Gardner in difficult positions.\n\nThe record is clear that not much Donald Trump does shocks conservative Republicans. They are prepared to tolerate a high degree of instability and dysfunction simply to prevent the Democratic left from gaining power. They would have to reject this bargain rapidly, wildly, stunningly, and decisively for the Senate to remove the president from office.
