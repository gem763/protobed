Pat Toomey speaks with President Donald Trump more than once a week about gun reforms in his push, along with Sens. Chris Murphy and Joe Manchin, to tighten background checks | Alex Wong/Getty Images Congress Inside the drive to flip Trump on gun background checks An unusual coalition of senators is working to persuade the president to stand up to the NRA.\n\nPat Toomey approached Chris Murphy on the Senate floor this week with an urgent warning: We\u2019re running out of time to sway President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cThe president's likely close to making up his mind and he\u2019s getting a lot of pressure from the other side,\u201d Toomey told Murphy. \u201cWe need to get before the president and make our pitch before he has a decision-making meeting.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWith opposition growing to their fledgling effort to expand background checks on gun sales, Murphy (D-Conn.), Toomey (R-Pa.) and their partner Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) decided to call Trump, Murphy recounted.\n\nThe three senators were soon on the phone with the president, speaking for 40 minutes and promising to stand firmly behind any agreement they could forge with him on background checks.\n\nThe trio\u2019s alliance spans the ideological spectrum \u2014 and might bring home the elusive 60 votes needed for the first move to curb gun violence in decades.\n\nThe odds remain slim that Trump and a Republican-controlled Senate will act amid stiff resistance from the NRA. But if background checks legislation becomes law, this unusual coalition will be key.\n\nSen. Chris Murphy holds a June news conference to discuss the Equal Access to Justice for Victims of Gun Violence Act. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nA hard-nosed Republican critic of Trump\u2019s trade policy and a doctrinaire fiscal conservative, Toomey speaks with the president more than once a week about gun reforms and trades text messages and phone calls with Murphy.\n\nA lonely Senate moderate, Manchin is suddenly back in Trump\u2019s orbit after the president did all he could to oust him in the 2018 midterms.\n\nThen there\u2019s Murphy, a 46-year-old liberal, who recently said the president \u201cbehaves like a child\u201d and is censoring himself whenever Trump veers off gun violence in their conversations.\n\n\u201cThe president said a lot of things I deeply disagreed with. I tried my best to hold my tongue,\u201d Murphy said of his recent talk with Trump. \u201cI did my best to stay focused on finding common ground on guns.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t expect this Gang of Three to partner up the next time the Senate needs to pass immigration, health care or economic legislation. But they\u2019ve become a rock-solid group pushing the president, conservatives and liberals to do something that\u2019s long appeared impossible even as the death toll rises from mass shootings.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a three-dimensional example of politics making strange bedfellows,\u201d said Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), a close friend of Murphy\u2019s. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine them finding common ground on very much outside of this space. But they\u2019re working hard to find it now.\"\n\nToomey and Manchin developed the first iteration of the proposal in 2013, but their push with Trump marks the most serious attempt in Congress since their background checks bill failed under mostly GOP opposition a half-dozen years ago. The Trump White House engaged with Senate negotiators as recently as Thursday night.\n\nAnd while Murphy supported the Manchin-Toomey measure at the time, the senator representing Newtown has since sought a far more expansive set of new gun regulations, describing himself as a \u201chard-liner\u201d on the matter.\n\nThe unlikely negotiating crew began to take shape during a phone call the president made to Toomey after the August shootings in Texas and Ohio.\n\n\u201cThe president called me and he wanted to discuss what I thought we ought to do,\u201d Toomey said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t put it as bringing back Manchin-Toomey per se but knowing of my interest in this space, he called.\u201d\n\nAfter a series of piecemeal conversations among themselves and the president, the senators approached Trump this week with what they say is a compelling message: If they and Trump can sign off on a deal, it will signal to Democratic and Republican leaders that a package can pass. As they see it, uniting the progressive Murphy, conservative Toomey, centrist Manchin and volatile president is the secret sauce the Senate needs to get to 60 votes.\n\nSen. Joe Manchin. | Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got Toomey on one side, you\u2019ve got Murphy on the other, me in the middle,\u201d Manchin said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d\n\nThough their colleagues are wishing the trio well, expectations are low.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t bet my house on it. If I were betting your house it would be a \u2018maybe.\u2019 This is going to be tough,\u201d said Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.). \u201cI don\u2019t want to see people pulling something out of their orifices.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m skeptical. This president changes his mind every 15 minutes,\u201d added Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.). \u201cIt\u2019d be nothing short of a political miracle.\u201d\n\nToomey, Manchin and Murphy are the key players on Capitol Hill in what\u2019s become an ensemble cast trying to put together a firearms package with the mercurial president. But Trump is also receiving competing advice from White House officials, complicating the debate.\n\nWhite House legislative director Eric Ueland, a former top Senate staffer, is moderating the wide-ranging and lengthy discussions. Still, Murphy said Trump is aware that background checks unite \u201ca lot of folks across the political spectrum.\u201d\n\nSens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) are working on a proposal that would provide grants for states to implement so-called red flag laws. Sen. Martha McSally (R-Ariz) wants to make domestic terrorism a distinct federal crime. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) embraces cracking down on straw purchases.\n\nCollins is also working on background checks. But she too realizes the importance of the Murphy-Manchin-Toomey triumvirate.\n\n\u201cWhen you get too many people on it, it can be difficult,\u201d Collins said of the call with Trump, which she knew of beforehand. \u201cIt was better to have those who were leading on background checks.\u201d\n\nExpanding background checks is the most ambitious response to the latest wave of gun violence being discussed in Congress, and one that remains deeply controversial in the GOP. But some Republicans appear to be more open to the idea given the president\u2019s softening, including Graham, a close Trump ally who previously opposed Manchin-Toomey.\n\n\u201cThese are the most meaningful talks that I\u2019ve seen on this issue in a long time,\u201d said retiring Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.), who also previously opposed background check expansions.\n\nBut Isakson knows how tough moving the president and his own party can be on core issues. He joined a small group of Republicans and most Senate Democrats last year to try and cut an immigration deal with the president, only to see the White House topple the plan.\n\nGuns may be even more challenging.\n\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

That earned an icy retort from Toomey, who tweeted that the former Texas congressman\u2019s \u201crhetoric undermines and hurts bipartisan efforts.\u201d\n\nEven with Toomey\u2019s whipping and Trump\u2019s support, a number of Republicans are certain to rebel against any firearms package. Many believe, as Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) said, \u201cI don\u2019t think more gun control is the answer.\u201d\n\nMurphy, meanwhile, has the difficult task of holding his own party together.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) is advocating passage of the House\u2019s universal background checks bill, which Republicans oppose. If Murphy, Toomey, Manchin and Trump can come up with something, it\u2019s certain to fall short of that, and Democrats may balk.\n\nIt\u2019s a reality that weighs on the senators even as they say they are closer than ever to what would be a historic achievement.\n\n\u201cThe trouble is Manchin-Toomey kind of has to move both ways at the same time,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cI think Republicans want some changes that would get more conservatives on board. ... But I don\u2019t think you can get Democratic votes for something that\u2019s fundamentally less than Manchin-Toomey.\u201d\n\n", "description": "An unusual coalition of senators is working to convince the president to stand up to the NRA.", "authors": ["Burgess Everett", "Marianne Levine"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/45/0d/337cc7494a17b260676919a58c1b/20190913-toomey-trump-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
