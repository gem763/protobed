The news was first reported by the nonprofit news organization Voice of San Diego.\n\nIn the charging documents , the board accuses Dr. Tara Zandvliet of gross and repeated negligence for granting a permanent vaccine exemption for a 4-year-old girl based on irrelevant family medical information. The board also alleges Zandvliet failed to maintain adequate and accurate medical records and conducted herself in an unethical and inappropriate way that \u201cdemonstrates an unfitness to practice medicine.\u201d\n\nAs Ars reported earlier this year, an investigation by Voice of San Diego found that Zandvliet had issued 141 of the area\u2019s 486 medical vaccine exemptions since 2015. The second-highest number of medical exemptions by a single doctor in the area was 26. In the charging document, the board noted that Zandvliet admitted to issuing around 1,000 medical exemptions as of June 2019.\n\nMedical vaccine exemptions are the only type of exemption allowed in the state of California. State lawmakers banned exemptions based on personal and religious beliefs in the wake of a massive measles outbreak in 2015. Since then, the state has seen an explosion in medical exemptions, with the numbers more than tripling. Lawmakers and health experts have blamed unscrupulous doctors for catering to anti-vaccine or vaccine-hesitant parents with bogus exemptions, often charging hefty fees.\n\nDr. Zandvliet charged $180 for evaluations for vaccine exemptions, and her practice did not accept insurance.\n\nConditions\n\nLast month, California\u2019s lawmakers passed new laws to crack down on such suspect medical vaccine exemptions. The laws grant the state oversight of the exemptions and require doctors to use only federally accepted criteria in determining which children are eligible. Medical conditions that warrant a vaccine exemption include previous history of a serious allergic reaction to a vaccine or having a compromised immune system, such as cancer patients on chemotherapy.\n\nIn the charging documents, the board alleges that Zandvliet was not using medically accepted criteria for issuing exemptions. Instead, she claimed without evidence that patients with family histories of common conditions such as asthma, psoriasis, and eczema should be exempt because they might be more likely to have adverse reactions to vaccines.\n\nIn the case of the 4-year-old girl mentioned in the charging document, the board outlined how Zandvliet granted a permanent exemption because\u2014according to the girl\u2019s father\u2014four of the girl\u2019s relatives had histories of asthma and psoriasis. Those relatives included her great-grandmother and her father\u2019s half-brother.\n\nZandvliet issued the exemption without conducting a physical exam on the girl or finding any evidence that she had an autoimmune disorder. Zandvliet also did not document whether the child had been vaccinated previously. The girl had, in fact, received vaccines before\u2014and had no adverse reactions.\n\nThe board will determine Zandvliet\u2019s fate. It could strip her of her license, suspend her, or put her on probation.\n\nThe board has only sanctioned one doctor over similar charges, so far\u2014that is, the infamous Dr. Robert Sears, who came to prominence as a vaccine skeptic and anti-vaccine sympathizer. He is currently on probation for negligence.", "description": "She wrote around a thousand exemptions, charging $180 each.", "authors": ["Beth Mole"], "top_image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/48546114182_fac945c547_c-760x380.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
