(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nDiplomats who have closely observed the International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s (IAEA) work in Iran said that investigators discovered traces of uranium at a Tehran-based storage facility, Reuters reported on Monday, and that Iran has yet to issue any explanation why.\n\nAccording to Reuters, vague reports that radioactive material had been detected at the site have been known for some time, but now two diplomats tasked with assisting international oversight of Iran\u2019s nuclear programs have confirmed that it was uranium.\n\nWhile uranium is one of only two materials that can be used to manufacture a nuclear warhead, one of the diplomats said that the IAEA had determined whatever material was stored there was not highly enriched, \u201cmeaning it was not purified to a level anywhere close to that needed for weapons,\u201d Reuters wrote. There are also numerous explanations for the presence of the material, including that it predates the 2015 nuclear deal\n\nThe find comes at a time when tensions in the region have grown following the Trump administration\u2019s decision to walk away from the nuclear deal and apply a policy of maximum pressure against Iran and increased sanctions on its economy, which Iran has met with a series of provocations in turn.\n\nBehrouz Kamalvandi of the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran recently stated that Iran was activating advanced uranium enrichment centrifuges prohibited by the deal, and the country has also began enriching uranium above the terms of the agreement, according to the Associated Press.\n\nPer Reuters, while inspectors have waited months for an explanation regarding the trace amounts of uranium, this delay is not unusual:\n\nIn a speech a year ago Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who vehemently opposed the deal, called on the IAEA to visit the site immediately, saying it had housed 15 kg of unspecified radioactive material that had since been removed. Reuters first reported in April that the IAEA, which is policing the nuclear deal, had inspected the site - a step it had said it takes \u201conly when necessary\u201d - and environmental samples taken there were sent off for analysis... The process of seeking an explanation from Iran has lasted two months, the IAEA\u2019s safeguards division chief told member states in a briefing on Thursday, diplomats present said. But he described what it was seeking an answer to far more generally as questions about Iran\u2019s declaration of nuclear material and activities, since the details are confidential.\n\n\u201cIt is not something that is so unique to Iran,\u201d a senior diplomat told Reuters. \u201cThe agency has these cases in many other situations. Depending on the engagement it can take two months, six months.\u201d\n\nIAEA Acting Director General going to Iran just as IAEA informs its Board that #Iran may be concealing nuclear material and/or activities. We join with other @iaeaorg Board member states eager to get a full report as soon as possible. \u2014 John Bolton (@AmbJohnBolton) September 7, 2019\n\nWe are confident that the UK, France, and Germany - indeed, all civilized nations - will take decisive actions to stop Iran's nuclear extortion. \u2014 Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) September 6, 2019\n\nAccording to a recent report in the New York Times, many outside observers believe Iran\u2019s breach of certain terms of the deal is designed to compel European nations that were signatories to the 2015 agreement to find ways to relax pressure on its economy rather than restore its prior nuclear capabilities.\n\nThe French government had presented Iran with the possibility of gaining access to a $22 billion line of credit to blunt the impact of U.S. sanctions, but the Times wrote that was apparently \u201ccontingent on an agreement with the United States not to penalise countries or companies involved in the extension of what amounts to a loan to Iran.\u201d The U.S. State Department has indicated that they see no possibility of such an arrangement coming to fruition.\n\nThe Times wrote that Iran has so far only enriched uranium to 4.5 per cent purity, \u201cmodestly\u201d above limits set in the deal, but that in statements this weekend, did not indicate whether they would enriching to higher levels such as 20 per cent purity.\n\n\u201cWe have started lifting limitations on our research and development imposed by the deal,\u201d Kamalvandi said on Saturday, per the Times. \u201cIt will include development of more rapid and advanced centrifuges.\u201d\n\nAs for going beyond 20 per cent, the Times wrote, Kamalvandi told Iranian media that \u201cRight now there is no need for that,\u201d but left open the possibility for the future.\n\n[Reuters]", "description": "Diplomats who have closely observed the International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s (IAEA) work in Iran said that investigators discovered traces of uranium at a Tehran-based storage facility, Reuters reported on Monday, and that Iran has yet to issue any explanation why....", "authors": ["Sarah Basford", "Tegan Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/dkm2ktlugajicbqbjtbh.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
