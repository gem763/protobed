The Board of HKEX continues to believe that a combination of LSEG and HKEX is strategically compelling and would create a world-leading market infrastructure group.\n\n\u201cDespite engagement with a broad set of regulators and extensive shareholder engagement, the Board of HKEX is disappointed that it has been unable to engage with the management of LSEG in realising this vision, and as a consequence has decided it is not in the best interests of HKEX shareholders to pursue this proposal.\u201d\n\nShares in the LSE plunged by over 6% in early trading after the bid withdrawal.\n\nChart: Yahoo Finance More\n\nLast month, HKEX made the surprise move to bid for the LSE and shares soared by more than 10% on the news at the time.\n\nCharles Li, chief executive of HKEX, which also owns the London Metal Exchange, said the move would \u201credefine global capital markets for decades to come.\n\nHKEX made clear its offer would only go ahead if the LSE abandoned its plans to buy financial Refinitiv. The LSE agreed to the purchase of the financial information provider a few weeks ago, in a deal aimed at offering trading across regions and currencies.\n\nREAD MORE: Surprise \u00a332bn takeover bid from Hong Kong for London Stock Exchange\n\nLi said at the time: \u201cBringing HKEX and [LSE] together will redefine global capital markets for decades to come. Both businesses have great brands, financial strength and proven growth track records. Together, we will connect East and West, be more diversified and we will be able to offer customers greater innovation, risk management and trading opportunities. A combined group will be strongly placed to benefit from the dynamic and evolving macroeconomic landscape, whilst enhancing the long-term resilience and relevance of London and Hong Kong as global financial centres.\"", "description": "HKEX withdraws bid saying it has come to a conclusion that despite the merit of the deal pursuing it won't be in the interests of its shareholders.", "authors": ["Lianna Brinded", "Head Of Yahoo Finance Uk"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6zcCtxAphMtxx_kCPNsrew--~B/aD0yMDI4O3c9MzI0ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/f2b15700-e998-11e9-bfff-4c152543af3b", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
