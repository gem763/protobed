And thus everyone knows who these tweets are aimed at, including Nancy.\n\nLooks like the Speaker\u2019s truce with the Squad is officially over.\n\nRemember that a majority of House Democrats (137 at last check, to be exact) already supported impeachment before the whistleblower news started bubbling. The remaining holdouts may hold out a bit longer to see if the whistleblower complaint is released and if it\u2019s as bad as it\u2019s cracked up to be, but unless it\u2019s a total bust the political calculus may have changed on impeachment even for centrist Dems. At some point it becomes more perilous to them in a purple district to defy their base by opposing impeachment than to defy right-leaning swing voters by supporting it.\n\nAt this point, the bigger national scandal isn\u2019t the president\u2019s lawbreaking behavior \u2013 it is the Democratic Party\u2019s refusal to impeach him for it. \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 22, 2019\n\nIt is one thing for a sitting president to break the law. It\u2019s another to let him. The integrity of our democracy isn\u2019t threatened when a president breaks the law. It\u2018s threatened when we do nothing about it. The GOP\u2019s silence & refusal to act shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Ours is. \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 22, 2019\n\nAs expected, Trump has already begun the process of admitting to part of what he\u2019s accused of, just as he famously did in the Lester Holt interview after firing Comey when he acknowledged that the Russia probe was on his mind when he dropped the axe. He hasn\u2019t copped to threatening Ukraine\u2019s president with a cut-off of U.S. military aid, but as to whether he asked him to investigate the son of the Democratic frontrunner for president, sure:\n\nKEY TRUMP QUOTE:\n\n\"The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place. It was largely the fact that we don't want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine.\u201c pic.twitter.com/yojLgXRaM6 \u2014 Jennifer Jacobs (@JenniferJJacobs) September 22, 2019\n\nWhether he admits things against his own interest because he\u2019s impetuous or because he\u2019s calculated that misconduct seems less sinister when you frankly confess to it (\u201che wouldn\u2019t admit to it if it were wrong, no?\u201d) is unclear but a source of endless fascination. In any case, it was clear to all sides before the July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelensky that Trump viewed Ukraine dimly:\n\n[T]he Trump administration has held Zelensky at arm\u2019s length since his election in April. Trump refused to set a firm date for an Oval Office meeting with the newly minted Ukrainian president at the White House \u2014 a sit-down that Ukraine has urgently sought to demonstrate Washington\u2019s backing as it fights a long-simmering war with \u00adRussian-backed proxies in its east. U.S. officials and members of the Trump administration wanted the meeting to go ahead, but Trump personally rejected efforts to set it up, according to three people familiar with the discussions. By the time Trump and Zelensky spoke during the July 25 telephone call, the meeting at the White House still hadn\u2019t been set. Soon after, it was disclosed that the White House had put a hold on $250 million in military aid for Ukraine after Trump ordered a review of the assistance package.\n\nUkraine is a stumbling block to better U.S.-Russia relations, which is one of Trump\u2019s foreign policy goals, and Trump resents the fact that Ukrainian officials allegedly tried to help Hillary in 2016. Having been frozen out by the White House, with the president bearing a grudge towards his country and U.S. military aid hanging in the balance, Zelensky must have understood that he was in no position to turn down a \u201crequest\u201d from Trump whether or not it was framed explicitly as a threat. Telling Trump no when he asked about reopening the Biden probe would have risked a complete rupture of U.S.-Ukraine relations.\n\nBut what did Trump say to him, exactly? POTUS says he\u2019s considering releasing the transcript of his call with Zelensky. Biden is demanding it, and even Trump allies are urging him to do it in hopes of putting the matter to bed. Pelosi, however, wants more than just the transcript of the call \u2014 she wants to see the whistleblower complaint, which, you may remember, allegedly involves a series of actions, not just the call between Trump and a still-unnamed foreign leader. Within the past few hours she issued a new statement about it, this time sounding more impeach-y than ever:\n\nPotentially significant. In new letter to lawmakers, PELOSI says if the admin fails to turn over whistleblower complaint, the investigation will enter \u201ca whole new stage\u201d pic.twitter.com/nsY8qbDtAo \u2014 Jake Sherman (@JakeSherman) September 22, 2019\n\nAs you\u2019ll see below, Adam Schiff sounds more resigned to impeachment than before too, telling Tapper this morning that Democrats may have no choice but to cross the Rubicon this time. If they\u2019re going to do it, Pelosi will want them to do it as soon as possible in order to mitigate any electoral backlash that may result. Democrats know that acquittal in the Senate is a foregone conclusion and they don\u2019t want impeachment drama interfering with the Democratic primary campaign next year. If the whistleblower complaint is released and the left\u2019s impeachment push becomes irresistible by leadership, they\u2019re better off rushing impeachment through and letting McConnell kill it before New Year\u2019s so that the party can turn the page to the election and angry right-leaning voters will have time to cool off. \u201cI did my duty,\u201d Pelosi will tell AOC and progressives. \u201cNow get off my back.\u201d", "description": "Soon?", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/p-3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
