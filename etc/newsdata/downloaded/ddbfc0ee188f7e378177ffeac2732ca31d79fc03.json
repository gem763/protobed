You look at what that candidate stands for, the integrity of that candidate, the history of that candidate.\u201d\n\nMr. Sanders\u2019s campaign aides were heartened that the first polls since his hospitalization did not show a significant drop in his support. But the candidate and his wife have not been revealing much to the public, or even some of his own staff, about when he would get back to the campaign trail and how aggressive he would be once he does return.\n\nIt is now almost certain that he will have a far more difficult path to the nomination. Democrats are overwhelmingly focused on finding a candidate they believe can defeat Mr. Trump, having made clear in surveys that ousting a president they loathe is their top priority. Now, in addition to questions about whether he is too far to the left to win over general election voters, Mr. Sanders will have to face doubts about his physical capabilities as he nears his eighth decade.", "description": "The Vermont senator vowed to slow his grueling campaign pace.
