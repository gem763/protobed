This adds to the mystery swirling around the American businesswoman before this week\u2019s Tory conference and raises further questions for the government.\n\nOne person who knew Arcuri was \u201cstunned\u201d to learn that company accounts show her loaning Hacker House \u00a3713,354 last year. Other firms set up by Arcuri are in the red or have been dissolved. Her main company, Innotech Network, has negative assets of more than \u00a3350,000 and she is reportedly being sued in the US over an unpaid $100,000 student loan.\n\nQuestions have now emerged as to how the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport established that the company was viable. The DCMS has admitted waiving a rule that any grant should not exceed half the company\u2019s revenue. \u201cThe department needs to explain how their due diligence procedures were followed,\u201d said Lib Dem MP Layla Moran.\n\nDepartment guidelines say grants are available only for companies based in the UK, and that trainees should remain and work here. Hacker House has given addresses in London and Macclesfield, but its website lists a California telephone number. Calls to a UK number are met by an answering service with an American accent.\n\nArcuri and her husband, Matthew Hickey, originally listed their countries of residence as England and the UK respectively in Companies House filings in 2016 and 2017. Last Friday, following questions in parliament about the company, updated filings confirmed that the pair now list their country of residence as the US. Hacker House is one of several companies set up by Arcuri, who is now under scrutiny after allegations surfaced that Johnson was once a regular visitor to her flat in London\u2019s Shoreditch.\n\nIn February this year, the DCMS awarded the firm a \u00a3100,000 grant to develop an IT training portal. Arcuri said she was \u201cthrilled\u201d as the money would help it develop new IT professionals. This was a coup for the US businesswoman, who shot to prominence when she persuaded Johnson to speak at a summit she organised in 2012. She then attended three overseas trade missions led by Johnson while he was mayor. Johnson appeared at three more of Arcuri\u2019s conferences. Innotech received more than \u00a310,000 in sponsorship from one of the mayor\u2019s funds in 2013.\n\nThat year, Arcuri was awarded \u00a315,000 and a place on the government-sponsored Sirius programme, which encourages foreign entrepreneurs to set up in the UK. According to a 2014 article on tech website Level39, Innotech worked \u201cin tandem with UKTI [UK Trade and Investment] to launch the Sirius programme\u2019s second cohort of graduate entrepreneurs.\u201d It goes on: \u201cJennifer, who has brought Boris to Level39 as part of the Innotech Summit 2013, was keen to share the love when it came to starting up in the UK.\u201d\n\nJohnson has denied suggestions that Arcuri\u2019s companies had preferential treatment because of her friendship with him. A spokesman for the Department for International Trade \u2013 which took over UKTI \u2013 declined to answer questions on the relationship between the trade body and Innotech.\n\nSeveral inquiries have been launched since the allegations were revealed by the Sunday Times last weekend. The Greater London Authority (GLA) has asked the Independent Office of Police Conduct to assess whether Johnson, as a former police commissioner, should face a criminal investigation for misconduct in public office.\n\nJohnson supporters said the referral was politically motivated, but Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: \u201cA wholly independent assessment has looked at evidence of the payments made by the mayor\u2019s office to one particular company and says there are serious questions to answer.\u201d\n\nThe GLA oversight committee has also called on Johnson to explain his relationship with Arcuri.\n\nThe DCMS has suspended payment of a second tranche of the grant to Hacker House pending its investigation. A DCMS spokeswoman said: \u201cFunding for this scheme was awarded through open and fair competition. We regularly monitor grant initiatives and treat any allegations of impropriety with the utmost seriousness.\u201d\n\nRequests for comment from Hacker House and Arcuri went unreturned.", "description": "New revelation about Hacker House entrepreneur as prime minister heads to Tory conference", "authors": ["Jamie Doward"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f87068e9e2a01de14b6ac44f5d67005b3989b61e/47_14_2283_1370/master/2283.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=154b2540fb60cacad2d8bcfed100ae51", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
