You are forever and ever friend.'\n\nThe suit states that with her words Mel 'knew how to tug' on Gary's heart strings and 'make him feel like he was the difference on her life and that he was a valued friend and employee.'\n\nIt added: 'In truth however, Mel B did not care for Plaintiff. Mel did not respect Plaintiff's rights and dignity as an employee or a human. As it turned out, for Defendant Mel B, Plaintiff was a convenient pawn to use and abuse and take advantage of.'", "description": "Mel B's sister Danielle Brown has slammed the songstress' former\u00a0close friend and confidante Gary Madatyan after he filed a bombshell lawsuit against her.", "authors": ["Jabeen Waheed For Mailonline", "Ryan Parry West Coast Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/11/19291696-0-image-a-57_1570183923721.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
