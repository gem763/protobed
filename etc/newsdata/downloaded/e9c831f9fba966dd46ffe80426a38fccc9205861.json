But what about El Camino: A Breaking Bad movie, was it as satisfying as the show?\n\nA lot of people said that El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie was like the post-credit scene that we all probably didn\u2019t need. Did we really need to watch a 2 hour movie to know how Jesse Pinkman ran off? Most fans are disappointed.\n\nvia GIPHY\n\nBut it has been six years since the epic cult show, which is also holds a Guinness World Records as the highest-rated TV series ever, was released. Six years later, you might have forgotten the little details that were showed in El Camino: A Breaking Bad movie.\n\nThese little details that you might have missed answered a lot of questions. For die hard fans, the film was full of references from the show.\n\nvia GIPHY\n\n#1 Do you remember Jesse always wanted to go to Alaska? Now, we finally know why!\n\nIn season five, when Saul Goodman is trying to sell him the idea of getting a new identity and asks him as to where he would want to go, Jesse\u2019s answer is Alaska.\n\nNetflix\n\nDon't Miss 23.2 K SHARES 4.6 K SHARES 1.9 K SHARES 3.2 K SHARES 3.1 K SHARES\n\nIn El Camino, Mike tells him, in the flashback scene, that he wants to start over again in Alaska if he could. So, it was originally Mike\u2019s idea. Jesse just followed his plan. If you remember, it is after this scene that Walter had shot Mike.\n\n#2 Jesse said his iconic line! \u2018Yeah, bitch! Magnets\u2019\n\nRemember when Jesse on the show excitedly screamed, \u201cYeah, bitch! Magnets.\u201d If you don\u2019t, here\u2019s a flashback.\n\nHe did that again in El Camino, when the junkyard owner is surveying his car. For old times sake, he says, \u201cMagnets\u201d,\u201d recalling that scene. He adds, \u201cYeah, that was a good one.\u201d\n\nNetflix\n\n#3 That Beetle had a reference!\n\nIn one of the episodes of Breaking Bad, Jesse is admiring a beetle crawling on the ground just moments before Skinny Pete stomps on it for no reason. In El Camino, Jesse is once again shown admiring a similar beetle, whose fate is much sunnier. This proved that Jesse Pinkman is no killer. Also, bugs are very important on the show.\n\n#4 The tarantula also had a connection with Breaking Bad.\n\nNetflix\n\nThe tarantula that we saw in El Camino was the same on that the kid Drew Sharp had. Drew was the boy who was murdered because he was at the wrong place at the wrong time.\n\nIn season five, remember when Jesse stole a thousand gallons of methylamine from a moving train with the help of Walt, Todd, and Mike? No one saw him but the young boy, who was shot at by Todd later.\n\nNetflix\n\nIn El Camino, we saw that Todd kept the tarantula in a glass tank. That\u2019s the reason why the movie kept focussing on the Todd\u2019s pet tarantula.\n\n#5 Los Pollos Hermanos was replaced by Twisters\n\nRemember Los Pollos Hermanos, which was basically Gus Fring\u2019s cover-up operation? That in the movie was replaced with Twisters.\n\nNetflix\n\nFun Fact: In the real world as well, the Los Pollos Hermanos location has long been a Twisters. In fact, in 2013, it was reported that fans would often go to Twisters and ask about Gus Fring.\n\n#6 Saul Goodman\u2019s office was replaced with a sports bar!\n\nNetflix\n\nThe place where Saul Goodman\u2019s office used to be, it was replaced by a restaurant Duke City Sports Bar. This is shown on the news on TV.\n\n#7 Police connected Lydia\u2019s death with that of Walter White.\n\nNetflix\n\nRemember when Jesse was listening to the radio in the car, police is talking about a woman who was poisoned in Houston. Her death was being connected to that of Walter White. The woman was Lydia Rodarte-Quayle.\n\nIn the show, the last we saw her was when Walt calls her to inform that he had swapped out her Stevia for ricin, a deadly poison. So, now we know she died at her home.\n\n#8 Jesse\u2019s plan to look for money at Todd\u2019s apartment was nothing short of a flashback!\n\nindiewire.com\n\nHe starts off by stripping off the wallpaper because that's where Walt would hide his money in between the walls, remember? He then checks under the sink, because that\u2019s where he hid his own meth in season 2.\n\n#9 The paper-weight that Jesse was looking at had Todd and Lydia\u2019s toy versions.\n\nNetflix\n\nTodd was obsessed with Lydia, remember?\n\n#10 Do you know, Jesse tells Ed that he was 96 percent sure that he is in the right place?\n\nNetflix\n\nHe just didn\u2019t make that number. That\u2019s the reference to purity level of meth he used to cook \u2013 96 percent.", "description": "Six years later, you might have forgotten the little details that were showed in El Camino: A Breaking Bad movie.
