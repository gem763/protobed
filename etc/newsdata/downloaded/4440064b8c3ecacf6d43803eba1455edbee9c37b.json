In mice used to model the disease, the therapy appears to boost the activity of the brain\u2019s immune cells, making them clear the aberrant proteins that build up in Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nLi-Huei Tsai, a neuroscientist who is leading the trial at MIT, told the Society for Neuroscience meeting in Chicago on Tuesday that the therapy improved the survival and health of the animals\u2019 neurons, boosted their connectivity, and dilated blood vessels, all of which may benefit patients. \u201cWe would like to see if our approach slows Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d Tsai told the Guardian.\n\nDementia poses threat to health similar to HIV and Aids, summit told Read more\n\nThe patients enrolled on the trial will have cognitive tests every three months to assess their brain function and regular scans to measure their brain activity and the connectivity of neurons across the organ.\n\nTsai told the conference that the light and sound sessions had boosted the amplitude and synchrony of 40Hz brain waves in the trial patients, but that it would take a year to gather data on whether the sessions helped to keep the disease at bay. The researchers call the exposure \u201cgamma entrainment using sensory stimuli\u201d, or Genus.\n\nA further 40 patients are to be recruited for a second trial that will examine directly whether the light and sound waves reduce levels of amyloid protein plaques and tau protein tangles \u2013 the hallmarks of Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2013 in the patients\u2019 brains and cerebrospinal fluid.\n\nThe unusual approach to combating Alzheimer\u2019s draws on the ability of light and sound waves to affect electrical activity in the brain. In a series of papers published since 2016, Tsai and her colleagues have shown that light and sound waves oscillating at 40Hz strengthen waves of the same \u201cgamma\u201d frequency in the brain.\n\nIn mice, at least, this appears to have multiple effects on cells in the brain, including ramping up the activity of the organ\u2019s immune cells, making them more effective at clearing protein plaques and tangles.\n\n\u201cWe hope our findings in mice will translate to helping people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, though it\u2019s certainly too soon to tell and many things that have worked in mice have not worked in people,\u201d Tsai said.\n\nJames Pickett, head of research at the Alzheimer\u2019s Society, said: \u201cBrain rhythms and their role in conditions like dementia are still mysterious, but this work begins to outline their impact on different types of brain cells and the mechanisms involved.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very early days, but we look forward to seeing how this area of research develops.\u201d\n\nIn a separate development, a US company that declared its experimental Alzheimer\u2019s therapy a failure in March has revived the drug after a fresh analysis found that it helped some patients. Biogen said it will ask the US drug regulators to approve aducanumab after it identified a statistically significant slowing in the decline of cognitive ability and basic activities of daily living in a subset of patients on high doses of the drug.\n\nPickett said: \u201cThis is hugely exciting news. After the trial being stopped earlier this year because it appeared not to work, further analysis suggests that it does benefit people with dementia in the earliest stages.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re waiting for further data but this could be the first new treatment for Alzheimer\u2019s disease in over 15 years, and as such, has the potential to be a transformative discovery.\u201d", "description": "Tests at MIT have shown a boost to the activity of the brain\u2019s immune cells", "authors": ["Ian Sample"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5cba6010ad99dc9eebd4c0a3dc421a70a690aa64/0_242_5149_3090/master/5149.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ad746a4ae7360d755fa33949dcf299ce", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
