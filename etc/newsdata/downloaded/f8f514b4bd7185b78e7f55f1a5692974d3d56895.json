He arrived at the project site with a bandaged face \u2014 and a black eye.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCarter also fell in May while leaving his house to go turkey hunting. That accident required hip replacement surgery, though the Carter Center said at the time that the low-key former president\u2019s \u201cmain concern is that turkey season ends this week, and he has not reached his limit.\u201d\n\nCarter has celebrated multiple record-breaking milestones in recent years: The 40th anniversary of his inauguration was in 2017; he joined George H.W. Bush as the only other president to reach the age of 94; and in March, at 94 years and 172 days, he became the longest-living former president in U.S. history.\n\nLast week, Carter reached yet another milestone: the longest presidential marriage.\n\nAD\n\nYears earlier, Carter thought he was nearing death, after doctors discovered a form of melanoma that spread to his brain.\n\n\u201cI just thought I had a few weeks left, but I was surprisingly at ease,\u201d Carter said at a news conference in 2015. \u201cI\u2019ve had an exciting and adventurous and gratifying existence.\u201d\n\nHe received his first radiation treatment at 90. Four months later, he was \u2014 remarkably \u2014 cancer-free.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The 95-year-old former president was admitted to Phoebe Sumter Medical Center for observation and treatment. \u201cHe is in good spirits and is looking forward to recovering at home,\u201d the Carter Center said.", "authors": ["Brittany Shammas", "General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/RYrBcwcDREMoaQUL8_aQgqQPY9g=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/10-07-2019/t_74b0cae7083744438961e297599b3890_name_20191007_CarterInjury.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
