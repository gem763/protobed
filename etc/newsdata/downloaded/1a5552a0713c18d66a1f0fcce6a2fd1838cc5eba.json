(Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)\n\nWhile most of Washington is consumed with impeachment, the operation against ISIS leader al-Baghdadi, and the Nationals being on the brink of botching a championship, Congress still faces a decision on the Export-Import Bank and a variety of expired tax cuts referred to as \u201ctax extenders.\u201d\n\nTo refresh your memory, the Export-Import Bank is supposed to help American companies export more goods, but ends up giving taxpayer assistance to some of America\u2019s biggest companies, like General Electric, John Deere, Caterpillar, and especially Boeing. George Will calls it a downright socialist government allocation of capital, Representative Jim Jordan calls it a waste of money, and here at NR, Veronique De Rugy, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, makes the argument against the Export-Import Bank, year after year after year.\n\nThe taxpayer-funded bank was slated to expire on September 30, but a provision in the continuing resolution keeps it going until November 21.\n\nConservatives usually like tax cuts, but some budget and tax policy-watchers find the \u201ctax extenders\u201d that House and Senate negotiators are considering to be narrowly targeted preferences for specific economic interests. If the tax breaks are really that worthwhile, they ought to be made permanent, not just given another extension.\n\nJust in time for Halloween, Americans for Prosperity is unveiling a new fake movie trailer calling the bank a \u201ccorporate welfare horror show.\u201d\n\nThey also sent a fake movie poster to every congressional office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLike Dr. Frankenstein building his monster away from the prying eyes of the townsfolk, Congress is trying to renew the Export-Import Bank and tax extenders without anyone knowing what they\u2019re doing,\u201d AFP Vice President of Economic Opportunity Russ Latino said in a released statement. \u201cBoth sides of the aisle should put a final nail in the coffin of this zombie corporate welfare that just won\u2019t die. We urge Congress to help unrig the economy and vote \u2018No\u2019 on EX-IM and vote \u2018No\u2019 on tax extenders.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRonald Reagan famously said, \u201ca government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life we\u2019ll ever see on this earth.\u201d Who knew he meant zombies?", "description": "Congress still faces a decision on the Export-Import Bank and a variety of expired tax cuts referred to as \"tax extenders.\"", "authors": ["Jim Geraghty", "Zachary Evans", "Kevin D.
