Cooking fans may like to add in a Japanese santoku knife for precision slicing, dicing and mincing.\n\nNext, think about how you\u2019ll store your new wares: a block is popular, but small kitchens might appreciate something wall mounted or that can be put away. Of course, there are unlimited styles, materials and finishes to consider, so whether a traditional crafted wood block or a high gloss minimalist stand floats your boat, there is choice aplenty.\n\nHere are our favourite sets, at a variety of price points, styles and selections so you\u2019re sure to find the set that\u2019s top of your blocks.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

Made from high carbon stainless steel for super strong, hardwearing blades, each of the five professionally designed knives has full tang (where the steel goes right through the centre of the handle for extra power) while managing to be not too heavy. The blades are tapered for extra precision and make light of most kitchen tasks from heavy-duty butchery to peeling and careful chopping.\n\nThe handles are non-slip with a classic industrial style three rivet design and are presented in a light wood block which is gently curved and would suit traditional or wood-heavy kitchens. Possibly not the most exciting of the lot but you really can\u2019t go wrong with these.\n\nBuy now\n\nTaylor\u2019s Eye Witness Brooklyn rose gold five piece knife block set: \u00a350, Bakewell Cookshop\n\nRose gold is going nowhere when it comes to interiors trends, so these pretty rose gold knives from Taylor\u2019s Eye Witness are sure to tickle many people\u2019s fancy. Housed in a black and transparent acetate fan-style stand with rose gold finger guards and detailing, this set of five knives are part of a range, so there are lots of other rose gold pieces should you wish to accessorize your kitchen further.\n\nThe knives themselves have hard, sharp titanium plated blades which are designed to be difficult to deaden and easy to sharpen, while the handle have a comfy soft grip. These are probably not for the keenest of cooks and won\u2019t last forever, but they are good value, lightweight and attractive enough to appeal to many first setting up a kitchen.\n\nBuy now\n\nBrabantia knife block plus tasty+ dark grey knives: \u00a360, Brabantia\n\nExactly what you\u2019d expect from Brabantia, the tasty+ knife block is a no-nonsense, practical yet understatedly stylish affair that will coordinate with most kitchens with its charcoal grey hues. We like the fact the bottom is removable for cleaning too. The five knives included are the standard chef\u2019s knife, bread knife, carving knife, utility knife and paring knife which are all made from corrosion-resistant steel, then ice-hardened to keep their edge for longer.\n\nWhile the handles don\u2019t feel as pleasing as others to hold, the grip is seamless with easy-grip ridges and the plastic means they are easier to clean than more temperamental wood. This is part of a wider collection so you can add matching kitchenware should you wish.\n\nBuy now\n\nRichardson Sheffield one80 five piece knife set: \u00a3185, Argos\n\nHailing from steel city, Richardson Sheffield has harnessed the skill and quality of British design over 180 years of business and ploughed it into this range of knives and block. The stand, or block, is a serviceable yet stylish and slender enough to fit into and under all nooks and kitchen crannies \u2013 but we we\u2019d have it slap bang in the middle of the kitchen.\n\nThe knives are ice hardened, stainless steel blades developed with professional chefs in mind and you very much feel the part when handling any of the five; you can feel the quality. Each has an attractive non-slip white glossy handle with just a hint of shimmer \u2013 so much more impressive in person, take our word for it \u2013 and the selection of knives is classic and useful for all kitchen purposes. They\u2019re strong, insanely sharp, durable and make us feel like we know what we\u2019re doing.\n\nBuy now\n\nZyliss comfort six piece knife set: \u00a336.99, Lakeland\n\nA cheery and useful six piece selection from Zyliss here; a peeling knife, two serrated parers, utility, 18cm santoku and a large 18.5cm chef\u2019s. So, yes you might want to invest in a separate bread knife, but for rolls or smaller loaves you could use a serrated parer (an under-appreciated knife in our book that is useful for tomatoes, soft veg, cake and frozen foods alike). They\u2019re made from Japanese stainless steel and are as comfortable as they say on the tin.\n\nThere\u2019s no storage offering with these, which is great for students as they can be kept in a drawer within their individual plastic sheaths to prevent blunting against other utensils; plus the bright colours make it easy to find the right knife quickly. If six knives are overwhelming, they also do a great value three piece.\n\nBuy now\n\nVenn five piece knife block set: \u00a379.96, Harts of Stur\n\nVenn is known for its multifunctioning pieces and this set incorporates clever space-saving design whereby you choose whether to store your knives on the work surface, folded away in a drawer or mounted on the wall within the fan-style block.\n\nContaining five professional-standard knives \u2013 parer, utility, bread, carving, chef\u2019s \u2013 each with a soft grip handle and a tapered stainless steel edge for sharpness, this set is in a dark grey colourway with brightly coloured collars for quick identification. Very handy if you\u2019re short on kitchen space and sensibly priced too.\n\nBuy now\n\nAndrew James coloured knife set with stand: \u00a319.99, Andrew James\n\nThis stand is a fan-style black acrylic storage block with plenty of transparency so you can select your very colourful knife with ease \u2013 we like how the whole knife is coloured rather than just the handle or collar.\n\nChoose from the usual selection of chef\u2019s, bread, carving, utility and paring, though most of the knives are slightly shorter than the expensive brands, making this set a more compact option. The knives are weighty enough to feel sturdy in your hands and have ergonomically designed handles, making these are a good all-rounder.\n\nBuy now\n\nTower Damascus rose gold edition five piece knife set: \u00a327.49, Tower\n\nThis is another on-trend metallic hued set worth considering if you\u2019re looking for something style-led without the accompanying price tag. This five piece bundle comprises a chef, carving, bread, utility and paring knife and easily stores away in its minimalist acrylic stand to best display the prettily patterned knives (the blades have an unusual Damascus effect).\n\nNo, they won\u2019t last forever at this price, but they\u2019re still made from titanium coated stainless steel, have impressively sharp blades that will maintain their precision if you look after them. The handles are as comfy as any others with some handy subtle non-slip quilting.\n\nBuy now\n\nRobert Welch signature book oak knife block set: \u00a3250, Robert Welch\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to really invest in your knives, we\u2019d point you towards this swish six piece set from Robert Welch. Here, you\u2019ll get a paring knife, a 11cm santoku knife, utility, chef\u2019s, bread and carving all designed in conversation with professional chefs. The blades are fully forced German stainless steel with Japanese-style blade edges and a full tang; in short the sharpest and strongest knives we came across.\n\nThe handles are formed from tactile duPont and are comfortable to hold. The accompanying block is made from solid oak designed to hold the knives vertically without damaging knives edges, but we think the knives are worth the price alone.\n\nBuy now\n\nProCook elite ice X50 knife set eight piece: \u00a3279, Pro Cook\n\nProCook has covered everything here. The set features a paring knife, utility, 15cm chef\u2019s knife, 20cm chef\u2019s knife, small and large santoku, bread and a carving knife to be getting on with. All are professionally crafted from German stainless steel containing carbon then ice hardened to keep those edges razor sharp.\n\nThe handles are an attractive light wood resin and have been contoured for comfort but they are definitely one of the heavier sets we tried; the weight of these alone makes you feel like you\u2019re a proper chef. There are various purchase options including individual knives and blocks for you to make up your own perfect set, but we\u2019ve fallen in love with the leather knife storage case; the portable wrap adds to the professional chef fantasy and is space-saving.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Kitchen knife sets\n\nAlthough this is a tough one to call as everyone has different needs and budgets, the Richardson Sheffield set is our top pick. If you\u2019re looking for something cheaper, the set from Brabantia is a reliable option.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
