Unfortunately, they also lost infielder Charlie Culberson, who was carted off the field after being hit in the face by a 91 mph pitch from Nationals reliever Fernando Rodney.\n\nThe frightening scene played out during the seventh inning. Culberson was squaring around to bunt when Rodney\u2019s pitch sailed in and struck him below the right eye.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nHome plate umpire Tim Timmons immediately called for medical attention. Athletic trainers from both teams quickly arrived and held towels to Culberson\u2019s face.\n\nCulberson was able to stand with assistance before being helped to the cart. He gave a thumbs up to the concerned crowd in Washington before being taken off the field.\n\nCharlie Culberson of the Atlanta Braves is taken off the field after getting hit by a pitch in the seventh inning.

The Braves are expected to provide an official update on his condition on Sunday morning.\n\n\u201cHe was good when he went to the hospital. I mean, he was alert and all of that stuff,\u201d Atlanta manager Brian Snitker said, via USA Today. \u201cI think it was bones around his eye.\n\n\u201cWe just don\u2019t (know) any of the extent of what\u2019s going on yet. We are just praying for him and his family. That\u2019s scary.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, moments like this are part of baseball. So too is the responsibility of the players and umpires to play on. In this instance, that required Timmons to make a judgment call on whether Culberson made an attempt to bunt the same pitch that struck him.\n\nThe veteran umpire ultimately decided that Culberson did make an attempt, meaning he was charged with a strike and not awarded a hit-by-pitch.\n\nBraves manager Brian Snitker was ejected soon after for arguing the call.\n\nStory continues\n\nSnitker has been ejected after furiously arguing with the umps who called a strike because Culberson was squaring when he was hit in the face with Rodney's pitch \u2014 Mark Bowman (@mlbbowman) September 14, 2019\n\nAdam Duvall finished the at-bat on Culberson\u2019s behalf. He struck out. The Braves went on to score four runs in the inning with Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr.\u2019s two-run double being the key hit.\n\nCulberson, 30, has been a key player for the first-place Braves. He\u2019s filled in at multiple positions while other players have been sidelined by injuries. He entered Saturday with a .259/.294/.437 batting line over 144 plate appearances.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The frightening scene played out during the seventh inning.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/sxfFwtDoWtD7TeWQv0cWbg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Hq0X8PoEWemh_DeeqLging--~B/aD0yMDAwO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/b9db03b0-d74e-11e9-9a7b-fb39764bd8fc", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
