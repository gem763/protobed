It is always special - it is 'Le Crunch' - and the game has lots of personal feelings attached to it.\n\nEngland humiliated France in the Six Nations in February as they secured a 44-8 victory\n\n'It's going to be a tough match for everyone - that's how it is. At the end of the game we are going to shake hands. France and England may be best friends, but not on the pitch.'\n\nFrance's three victories so far have followed a similar pattern. In all of them they have started strongly but then stopped playing, allowed the opposition back in before clinging on to wins.\n\nOnly against the USA did the bench rescue them with a couple of late tries.\n\nDespite this theme Slimani is sure France will improve when it matters.\n\nSlimani insists that there is more to come from France and is certain that they will improve\n\n'There's definitely more to come,' he added.\n\n'We can do better, we know we can. We can progress - we haven't shown all we are capable of yet.\n\n'We know when you play against a team like England you need to be at the top of your game for the whole match, not just the first half or whatever. We need to play at a high level for the whole game.'\n\nSlimani is set to face Mako Vunipola and Joe Marler and rates England's scrum highly\n\nThe prop will likely be up against Mako Vunipola and Joe Marler in the scrum, and rated England's set piece highly.\n\n'Their scrum has been good so far following on from what they did in the Six Nations,' Slimani said.\n\n'We need to work on some of our aspects of the game, and now have five days to prepare, so that's what we're going to do.\n\n'Even though the Tonga game was tough we had a goal, to get to the quarter-finals. It's done.' While both sides have made it through to the last eight, France will not let England off the hook on Saturday in Yokohama.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE BY WILL KELLEHER IN KUMAMOTO: France are desperate to heal the wound England inflicted on them in the Six Nations at the World Cup, according to Rabah Slimani.", "authors": ["Will Kelleher For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/21/19413056-0-image-a-62_1570480410474.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
