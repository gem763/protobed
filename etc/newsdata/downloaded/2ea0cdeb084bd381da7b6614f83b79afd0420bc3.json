The ones that are operational are a handful of upper-stage elevators and a utility elevator.\n\nThe long pole in the tent, as they have previously been described by Navy officials, remains the lower-stage elevators built to rapidly move ordnance from the internal magazine complexes to the flight deck, a critical capability that directly affects the aircraft sortie rate and the overall lethality of the ship.\n\nWhile all of the elevators were expected to be ready by the end of the PSA, the task has proven to be a far greater challenge than previously anticipated.\n\nOpenly expressing his frustration with this problematic aspect of the Ford's development, Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer sharply criticized HII Wednesday, accusing the shipbuilder of having \"no idea\" what it is doing with respect to this project.\n\nThe Navy dispatched the Linked and Integrated Fix Team (LIFT), a team of government and industry experts, to the shipyard three months ago to look for answers to the elevator problems.\n\nThe service will continue to work on the Advanced Weapons Elevators over the next 18 months during post-delivery tests and trials off the Virginia coast in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nA way forward is still in the works\n\nUSS Gerald R Ford. US Department of Defense\n\nDuring the coming sea trials, the Navy will carefully evaluate the work performed during the PSA.\n\nThe Ford's crew and industry shipbuilding engineers will work together to validate systems that were repaired, maintained, or modified during the recent maintenance availability. They will also certify the carrier's fuel systems, conduct relevant aircraft compatibility testing, certify the flight deck, and test the onboard combat systems.\n\nFollowing post-delivery test and trials, CVN-78 will go through full ship shock trials, a planned incremental availability, and deployment workups. The schedule for post-PSA development phases are currently under review.\n\nConstruction of the Ford began in 2005, and the keel was laid down four years later. The ship was launched in late 2013 with an expected initial delivery date of 2015, a date that was pushed back to 2017. At that time, it began sea trials that would inform decisions made during its recent PSA.\n\nThe ship is currently over budget with a total cost of more than $13 billion, making it the most expensive warship ever built. It is also behind schedule, as deployment with full operational capability is expected to be several years late.\n\nThe Navy is, however, taking the lessons learned during the development of the Ford and applying it to future ships in this class.", "description": "The first-in-class ship has wrapped up its post-shakedown availability and is headed into the Atlantic Ocean for another round of tests and trials.", "authors": ["Ryan Pickrell"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db2eaf1dee01975cb53c6a2?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
