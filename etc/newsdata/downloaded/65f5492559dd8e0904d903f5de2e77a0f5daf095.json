(AP)\n\nCarol Lynley, who appeared on Broadway in her early teens, then became a film actress whose best-known role was as a ditsy, shrieking lounge singer in the 1972 cult-classic disaster movie \u201cThe Poseidon Adventure,\u201d died Sept. 3 at her home in Pacific Palisades, Calif. She was 77.\n\nThe cause was an apparent heart attack, said a friend, actor Trent Dolan.\n\nMs. Lynley was a child model and actress who was featured on the cover of Life magazine in 1957, when she was only 15.\n\nKnown for her pert good looks, she soon moved to Hollywood and became a minor star in mostly minor films. She appeared in a series of lightweight sex romps, such as \u201cUnder the Yum Yum Tree\u201d (1963) with Jack Lemmon and \u201cThe Pleasure Seekers\u201d (1964), about the romantic adventures of three young American women in Spain.\n\nIn one of her more challenging dramatic roles, Ms. Lynley shared the screen with Laurence Olivier and Noel Coward in Otto Preminger\u2019s 1965 psychological thriller \u201cBunny Lake Is Missing,\u201d playing a young mother searching for a lost daughter.\n\nBut her most recognizable role was as a shipboard singer in the star-studded \u201cThe Poseidson Adventure.\u201d The film was part of a series of blockbuster disaster movies in the 1970s, including \u201cAirport,\u201d \u201cThe Towering Inferno\u201d and \u201cEarthquake.\u201d\n\n\n\nMs. Lynley, shown in 2006, appeared in dozens of television shows, including \u201cThe Man From U.N.C.L.E.,\u201d \u201cRun for Your Life\u201d and \u201cFantasy Island,\u201d and starred in a 1975 production of John Steinbeck\u2019s \u201cOf Mice and Men\u201d at the Kennedy Center. (David Livingston/Getty Images)\n\nThe film takes place on New Year\u2019s Eve, as the festivities aboard the SS Poseidon are thrown into turmoil when the ship is capsized by a 90-foot tidal wave. Ms. Lynley is among the Poseidon passengers attempting to survive the disaster, along with other cast members, including Gene Hackman, Shelley Winters, Jack Albertson, Stella Stevens, Ernest Borgnine, Red Buttons and Leslie Nielsen.\n\nIn the movie, Ms. Lynley sings the movie\u2019s Oscar-winning theme song, \u201cThe Morning After,\u201d although her voice was dubbed by singer Ren\u00e9e Armand. Dressed in a clinging orange blouse, white hot pants and go-go boots, she spends much of the film climbing through the wreckage, screaming and getting drenched by water.\n\n\u201cIt was the most physically demanding role you can possibly imagine,\u201d she told Chicago Sun-Times film critic Roger Ebert in 1972. \u201cWe had to swim underwater, climb across tiny catwalks, walk over flames . . . They hosed us down at least 20 times a day. And there were no safety precautions for the first two weeks of shooting. I\u2019d be up there on a catwalk, and if I slipped, it was six stories straight down through flames to a concrete floor.\u201d\n\nParts of the movie, directed by Ronald Neame, were filmed on a cruise liner, but most of it was shot on a Hollywood sound stage, inside a huge tank that took three days to fill with water. The claustrophobic setting seemed to intensify the egos and fears of the cast.\n\n\u201cEverybody hated something,\u201d Ms. Lynley told The Washington Post in 1972. \u201cI hated the heights. Red Buttons hated the water. Stella [Stevens] hated the dirt and so did Ernest Borgnine. Shelley Winters hated being fat and Jack Albertson hated Shelley Winters.\u201d\n\nCarol Ann Jones was born Feb. 13, 1942, in New York City. Her parents divorced when she was a toddler, and her mother worked as a waitress. Ms. Lynley became a child model, under the name Carolyn Lee, and by age 10 was her family\u2019s primary breadwinner.\n\n(She later took the name Carol Lynley because another actress had the name Carolyn Lee.)\n\nShortly before her 15th birthday, Ms. Lynley was appearing on Broadway in Graham Greene\u2019s \u201cThe Potting Shed\u201d and soon thereafter was featured in Life magazine. During the day, she had dance lessons and up to five modeling assignments before going to the theater at night.\n\n\u201cHer career leaves her no time for school or social life,\u201d the article noted. (She had a private tutor.)\n\n\u201cTo fend off threatening ounces, she limits herself to a Spartan two meals a day: tea and grapes for breakfast, steak or fish, ice cream and more grapes for dinner.\u201d\n\nIn 1958, Ms. Lynley appeared on Broadway in \u201cBlue Denim,\u201d a play by James Leo Herlihy and William Noble in which she portrayed a teenage girl who becomes pregnant and is considering an abortion. A year later, in a film adaptation of the play, her performance was described as \u201ctender and poignant\u201d by New York Times critic Bosley Crowther.\n\nShe was considered a rising star in Hollywood, but other than \u201cBunny Lake Is Missing\u201d and \u201cThe Cardinal,\u201d a 1963 religious drama also directed by Preminger, her film roles were often forgettable. In 1961, she was in \u201cReturn to Peyton Place,\u201d a film \u201cso awful,\u201d Post critic Richard L. Coe wrote, \u201cI can\u2019t decide whether to laugh or cry.\u201d\n\nMs. Lynley appeared in dozens of television shows, including \u201cThe Man From U.N.C.L.E.,\u201d \u201cRun for Your Life\u201d and \u201cFantasy Island,\u201d and she posed nude for Playboy magazine in 1965. She also continued to work in the theater, including a 1975 production of John Steinbeck\u2019s \u201cOf Mice and Men\u201d at the Kennedy Center.\n\nHer only marriage, to publicist Michael Selsman, ended in divorce. Survivors include a daughter, writer and filmmaker Jill Selsman of New York. Ms. Lynley later had a long relationship with talk-show host David Frost.\n\n\u201cI think marriage limits a woman\u2019s growth,\u201d Ms. Lynley told The Post in 1972. \u201cI\u2019m willing to live with a man, but I\u2019m not interested in all the paperwork that goes with matrimony and divorce.\u201d\n\nMs. Lynley was gratified but puzzled by the continued popularity of \u201cThe Poseidon Adventure,\u201d which inspired a devoted following. She and other cast members sometimes appeared at gatherings of the film\u2019s fans, many of whom memorized the dialogue, made tribute (and spoof) videos or constructed elaborate models of the doomed ship.\n\n\u201cThe movie has a life of its own,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI went through 10 or 15 pairs of shorts because they kept shrinking,\u201d she told the New York Times about the making of the film. \u201cAt the end of it, we had the choice of taking our costumes home. But after three and a half months, you don\u2019t want them.\u201d\n\nShe came to regret her decision.\n\n\u201cI could sell them on eBay for a fortune.\u201d", "description": "She appeared on Broadway at 15 and acted in dozens of Hollywood films and TV shows.", "authors": ["Matt Schudel", "Obituary Writer", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/7DMYxDoR5uRVVn14oJOTqC6LmCs=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5DTMZWGQX4I6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
