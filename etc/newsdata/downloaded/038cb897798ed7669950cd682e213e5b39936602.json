Instead, he\u2019s finding it harder to meet his visa\u2019s financial stipulations because of the strong baht.\n\nThe former aircraft technician easily bought a townhouse, pickup truck and motorcycle when he arrived at the age of 55 two decades ago. Back then the pound bought about 60 baht, but now it fetches a little less than 38 baht.\n\n\u201cIt was a cheap place to live then,\u201d Maxey said in an interview in the coastal city of Pattaya, which is popular with European retirees. \u201cIt\u2019s not anymore.\u201d\n\nThe pressure on foreign pensioners is just one example of how the baht\u2019s sharp appreciation is rippling through Thailand. The currency is the world\u2019s top-performer against the dollar over five years, hurting export competitiveness and putting the economy on course for the weakest growth since 2014.\n\nThe Thai government issued almost 80,000 retirement visas last year, a climb of 30% from 2014. To qualify, foreigners must show a deposit of 800,000 baht ($26,261) in a Thai bank or have a monthly income of 65,000 baht. Another route is to have income and deposits totaling 800,000 baht combined.\n\nBritons accounted for the largest number of retirement visas in 2018, Immigration Bureau data shows. They were followed by Americans, Germans, Chinese and Swiss pensioners seeking affordable, sun-dappled golden years.\n\nOnce best known for crashing and sparking the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the baht is today seen as a haven by global investors. A trade surplus and annual foreign tourism receipts exceeding $60 billion underpin its resilience.\n\nThe currency has appreciated more than 6% against the dollar so far in 2019, the best performer in a basket of Asian economies tracked by Bloomberg.\n\nIt\u2019s likely to stay resilient, said Masakatsu Fukaya, an emerging-market currency trader at Mizuho Bank Ltd. in Tokyo. There could be more upward pressure if firms relocate production to Thailand to skirt U.S. tariffs on China-made products, according to Fukaya.\n\nSome pensioners are already voting with their feet, according to Niels Colov, who moved from Denmark about 40 years ago and helps to organize a club for expats in Pattaya.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an exodus of foreigners from this area to Vietnam, Cambodia and the Philippines,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking thousands of people.\u201d\n\nUp until six months ago, it was common to see overflowing queues of foreigners at Pattaya\u2019s immigration office, but now there\u2019s no line, according to Colov.\n\nSome of those remaining may have to cut back spending, said Christian Foerster, an Austrian who retired to Thailand 20 years ago.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an enormous change,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything is more expensive. But it\u2019s about adjusting, adapting and living modestly.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, the cost of living in Thailand remains lower than in developed nations such as the U.S. or in Europe, and officials continue to promote it as a retirement destination.\n\nBaht strength leaves Pattaya retiree Maxey\u2019s 1,000-pound ($1,235) pension far short of the minimum monthly requirement. As a result, he maintains the equivalent of a 22,000-pound deposit to satisfy the bank savings rule when renewing his visa.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of money to hold in a bank account that you can\u2019t touch,\u201d Maxey said, while adding he wants to stay on in Thailand despite the difficulties as he\u2019s settled in the country.\n\n(Updates with more comments in the 12th paragraph.)", "description": "Surging Thai Baht Shatters Expat Dreams of Easy Retirement", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/piccc2949eb8488137e63b40ab8fa025409.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
