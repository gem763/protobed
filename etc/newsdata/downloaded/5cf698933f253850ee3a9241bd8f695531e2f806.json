Why should I go to his funeral? I don't have fuel,\" a Harare resident told AFP. \"We don't want to hear anything about him anymore. He is the cause of our problems.\"\n\nWhen and where will Mugabe be buried?\n\nZimbabwe's former President Robert Mugabe will be buried in the National Heroes Acre monument in Harare, his family says, following a row with the government over his final resting site.\n\nFamily spokesman and nephew Leo Mugabe says this should be in about a month, when the new mausoleum has been built.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Members of the Mugabe family prepare to view the body of the late Zimbabwean president\n\nEarlier plans to have a burial on Sunday appear to have been cancelled.\n\nMr Mugabe, who was 95, died last week while being treated in Singapore.\n\nHis body is now lying in state at the Rufaro football stadium in the capital before the funeral on Saturday.\n\nWho was Robert Mugabe?\n\nMr Mugabe was Zimbabwe's first leader after the country became independent in 1980. He held on to power for almost four decades before being ousted in the 2017 coup.\n\nDuring his early years, he was praised for broadening access to health and education for the black majority.\n\nHowever his later years were marked by violent repression of his political opponents and Zimbabwe's economic ruin. An increasing number of critics labelled him a dictator.\n\nHe seized land from white owners in 2000.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Mugabe: From war hero to resignation\n\nMr Mugabe famously declared that only God could remove him from office.\n\nIn 2017 he was placed under house arrest and, four days later, replaced as the leader of his party Zanu-PF by his former vice president, Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\nMr Mugabe initially refused to resign. But, on 21 November, as a motion to impeach him was being debated in the Zimbabwean parliament, the speaker of the House of Assembly announced that he had finally left office.\n\nMr Mugabe negotiated a deal which protected him and his family from the risk of future prosecution and enabled him to retain his various business interests. He was also granted a house, servants, vehicles and full diplomatic status.", "description": "The state funeral comes amid controversy over the former Zimbabwean leader's burial.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07n5n71.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
