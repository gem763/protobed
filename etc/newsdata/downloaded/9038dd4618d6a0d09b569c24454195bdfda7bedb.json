As a result, Judge John Kastrenakes, of the state's 15th Judicial Circuit, ordered Somerville to spend 10 days in jail, serve a year of probation and perform 150 hours of community service.\n\nSomerville served his 10-day sentence in September, and his lawyer, Daniel Eisinger, told the Sun-Sentinel that time behind bars \"was pretty shocking and scary\" for the 21-year-old.\n\nTEXAS COMPANY REMOVES MURDER SUSPECT'S GPS MONITOR DUE TO UNPAID FEES WITHOUT TELLING AUTHORITIES: OFFICIALS\n\nOn Friday, however, Kastrenakes reduced Somerville's terms to three months of probation and 30 hours of community service. On Monday, the judge said he reflected further on the case and decided to vacate Somerville's probation entirely \u2014 but he maintained Somerville acted carelessly not showing up for jury duty and for not calling the court to tell them what happened.\n\n\u201cGiven the abundant publicity surrounding Mr. Somerville\u2019s case, I have concluded that the importance of a sworn juror abiding by the law has been made clear,\u201d Kastrenakes wrote in his order. \u201cTherefore, there exists no reason to continue Mr. Somerville on probation.\u201d\n\nHe added: \"I know he now understands and respects our system of justice and the critical role jurors play in that system. In conclusion, I do not want even a finding of contempt to be gleaned from a perusal of his background or record.\"\n\nGERMAN BANK ROBBER'S 20-HOUR-LONG COURT RANT CUT OFF BY JUDGE BEFORE PRISON SENTENCE\n\nThe judge said Somerville \"has been totally rehabilitated\" and isn't the same person \"who refused to come to court and intentionally violated his oath as a sworn juror.\" He insisted he wasn't singling Somerville out, and that he \u201cwould have punished anyone who behaved the way Mr. Somerville behaved in the same manner.\u201d\n\nSomerville, who had no previous criminal record, said what he did \u201cwas an immature decision that I made, and I paid the price for my freedom.\"\n\n\"As a result of my irresponsible actions, my life has been forever changed,\" the 21-year-old read from an apology letter Friday. \"Everything I've gone through, I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.\"\n\nCLICK TO VISIT THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nKastrenakes on Monday said he found the man's apology letter \u2013 which, according to The New York Times, the judge ordered him to write \u2013 to be \"moving, sincere and heartfelt.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "A Florida man who spent 10 days in jail for\u00a0missing jury duty has had his record vacated by the judge who initially doled out the punishment.", "authors": ["Nicole Darrah", "Nicole Darrah Covers Breaking", "Trending News For Foxnews.Com.
