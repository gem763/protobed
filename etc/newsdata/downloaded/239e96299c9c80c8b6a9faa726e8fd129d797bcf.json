Although Wakefield and his co-authors admitted that they \u2018did not prove a causal relationship\u2019 \u2013 my italics \u2013 between MMR and autism, it would be more accurate to say that they did not present any evidence of a causal relationship.\n\nThey simply reported that the parents of eight of the 12 children in the study believed there was such a link.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the four-stage mechanism through which MMR was supposed to produce both autism and inflammatory bowel disease seemed, to me, entirely speculative.\n\nJames is pictured with mother Mary Langan, who discovered with her husband Dr Fitzpatrick that their son had the MMR jab without any apparent adverse effects about four months before they noticed the signs of what doctors call his \u2018autistic withdrawal\u2019, in his baby book\n\nMMR researcher Wakefield is pictured making a statement at the General Medical Council headquarters in London\n\nPutting all this together, I was swiftly unconvinced by the theory that the MMR jab had been a factor in causing autism in James or in any child. Other parents, of course, were not so sure.\n\nGiven that the MMR jab is usually administered at around the time features of autism often first appear, it was understandable that some parents would suspect a causative link \u2013 especially when this was suggested by what seemed to be a reputable doctor.\n\nI knew immediately that Wakefield and his supporters should be called to account.\n\nThe impact of his paper, revealed more than 20 years ago, is still being felt today. Britain has recently lost its measles-free status amid a growing barrage of online propaganda from \u2018anti-vaxxers\u2019 while the Government has seemed to take its eye off the ball on the subject.\n\nMany parents have delayed or refused vaccination from GP practices and instead opted for expensive, separate measles, mumps and rubella jabs at private clinics (pictured the MMR vaccine)\n\nWakefield, though disgraced in the medical community and rightly struck off, is now enjoying a second life in America, paid well for peddling his discredited, shadowy conspiracy theories in the world of quack autism therapists \u2013 and, indeed, enjoying a relationship with supermodel Elle Macpherson.\n\nBut back to the early 2000s. By then, our family was struggling with James\u2019s increasingly challenging behaviour and the difficulties of finding a school that could cope with him. Wakefield\u2019s campaign, however, seemed to be going from strength to strength.\n\nPlummeting vaccination rates have led to an \u2018alarming upsurge in measles cases in all regions\u2019, including the UK, experts said (stock image of child with measles rash)\n\nIt frustrated me that the medical authorities seemed to think it was enough to expose the lack of serious evidence for Wakefield\u2019s and other anti-vaxxers\u2019 claims at scientific conferences and in specialist journals. What was needed \u2013 and what is still needed today \u2013 is a proper countering of these claims in the public sphere.\n\nTo our discredit, many of us doctors have been too slow to realise that anti-vaxxers do not truly operate in the world of scientific research. Wakefield is a perfect example of this: Though his scientific talents are negligible, his PR skills are formidable.\n\nI have since come to know several parents who found themselves dragged into ill-fated litigation against vaccination companies based on Wakefield\u2019s claims, and many more who were afflicted with guilt and anxiety over giving their children the MMR jab.\n\nBy 2004, thanks to the efforts of a spectrum of campaigners including doctors, journalists and others, the tide began to turn against the Wakefield campaign.\n\nAs a result of his failure to come up with evidence that convinced anybody but himself of the MMR-autism link, the Legal Services Commission withdrew funding for the litigation \u2013 effectively bringing it to an end.\n\nThe lawyers and their expert witnesses shared \u00a315million among themselves \u2013 and 1,500 families ended up with nothing but bitterly disappointed hopes. If only that had spelled an end to the matter.\n\nGraphic shows where jab uptakes are the lowest across London (top) and the UK as a whole (bottom)\n\nBut the myths about vaccination did not die down. At the end of 2004, I pulled together numerous criticisms of the anti-MMR campaign I had written in both the medical and popular press over the preceding five years.\n\nI wrote a book, MMR and Autism: What Parents Need To Know, to expose the pseudo-science of these claims. My aim as a doctor and as a campaigner on this issue has always been to reassure parents worried about vaccination, and to relieve the anxieties of parents of autistic children.\n\nMy last encounter with Wakefield took place at a conference organised by a parents\u2019 anti-vaccination group in Bournemouth in 2007.\n\nHe was greeted with a standing ovation and delivered a highly technical presentation which would not have persuaded his scientific peers, but clearly impressed this lay audience.\n\nWhen it came to the Q&A after the talk, I asked Wakefield how he explained the fact that, in nearly a decade since he had first advanced his MMR-autism hypothesis, this had failed to win the endorsement of a single British scientist or practising specialist in autism, gastroenterology or paediatrics.\n\nHe refused to answer \u2013 and the security guards were summoned to remove me from the hall.\n\nMy application to attend a subsequent conference by the same group was refused.\n\nThese heavy-handed tactics are typical of the hypocrisy of an anti-vaxxer movement that spurns free enquiry and open debate.\n\nSo, now that Britain has lost its measles-free status, what should we \u2013 as doctors and as parents \u2013 be doing?\n\nSome call to ban anti-vaxxer websites and online forums, or to make vaccination mandatory for school entry. I think that while the information war must be played out on the web, compulsory vaccinations are a step too far.\n\nBut as a GP, I see that the real challenge is to improve the organisation of Britain\u2019s baby clinics.\n\nWe need to address shortages of the key professionals involved \u2013 health visitors, practice nurses and GPs. We need to improve systems to alert parents when vaccinations are due, to ensure clinics are at convenient times and that staff have sufficient time \u2013 and adequate training \u2013 to deal with parental concerns.\n\nWe need better IT systems to cope with a more tech-savvy population, and for keeping accurate vaccination records.\n\nNone of these measures will change the past, of course.\n\nThe fact that our son James is now 27 gives us a ready reminder of how long this controversy has been running \u2013 and how much more we need to do.\n\nDr Michael Fitzpatrick is the author of MMR and Autism: What Parents Need to Know", "description": "Physician Andrew Wakefield's PR skills are 'formidable' as he claimed a link between autism and MMR 20 years ago -and Dr Michael Fitzpatrick's autistic James (pictured) was told he had signs.", "authors": ["Dr Michael Fitzpatrick For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/22/19665280-0-image-a-18_1571000481967.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
