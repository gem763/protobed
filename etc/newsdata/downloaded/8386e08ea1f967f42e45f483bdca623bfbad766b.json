For that you\u2019ll have to talk to an attorney in California.\n\nAD\n\nBut here\u2019s one thought to consider: There\u2019s a fine line between avoiding a tax and evading a tax. If you can avoid paying tax, it might be legal, but when you evade tax payments, it\u2019s probably illegal.\n\nAD\n\nOur California readers will know this, but for everybody else, here is some context: California Proposition 13 (officially named the People\u2019s Initiative to Limit Property Taxation) was approved by voters in 1978. It reduced property taxes on homes, businesses and farms substantially, by around 57 percent, rolling back property values (for tax purposes) to where they were in 1976. Prior to that move, Californians paid property tax at a rate of just under 3 percent of market value, one of the highest property tax rates in the country.\n\nProposition 13 capped real estate property taxes at the rate of 1 percent of the sales price of the home. Property taxes are only reassessed when the property is sold, and as long as it isn\u2019t sold, tax increases are limited to 2 percent. Here\u2019s a simple example: Suppose a home was worth $100,000 in 1976. The homeowners paid $1,000 in property taxes after 1978, increasing at a rate of 2 percent every year since. If the home was sold last year for $2 million, the property taxes would be around $20,000.\n\nAD\n\nCalifornia may have certain allowances to transfer home ownership to spouses and even children (in the event of divorce or death) that may have a limited effect on assessment of the real estate taxes. And California homeowners may have the ability to transfer the low tax basis from their existing home to a new home they purchase. For example, under certain conditions of other California laws, seniors may have two years to sell their homes and buy or build a replacement property and receive a property tax break.\n\nAD\n\nBut it doesn't seem like that's what you're really asking. We read your question as wondering whether you can sell the underlying ownership structure in the home to a third party and keep the low real estate taxes you're currently paying.\n\nIn many parts of the country, municipalities have addressed these change-of-control situations by specifically stating that a change in control of the underlying ownership is considered a sale for purposes of real estate taxes and real estate transfer taxes. If you do some digging, or speak with a reputable real estate attorney, you\u2019ll probably find out that California has a change-of-control provision in its regulations. Otherwise, you\u2019d see everyone setting up trusts and selling trust interests without triggering the increase in real estate taxes.\n\nAD\n\nYou aren\u2019t the first one to ask this question, by the way. And kudos on thinking creatively. However, over the course of Sam\u2019s law practice, he saw commercial property owners who avoided paying hefty real estate transfer taxes on the sale of commercial properties by doing what you describe but using corporations or limited liability companies instead of trusts. It didn\u2019t take long for the local municipalities to cry foul and pass ordinances or rules stating that a change of control in the underlying entity would be equivalent to the sale of the property itself.\n\nWe hope this helps.\n\nAD", "description": "REAL ESTATE MATTERS | There\u2019s a fine line between avoiding a tax and evading a tax.
