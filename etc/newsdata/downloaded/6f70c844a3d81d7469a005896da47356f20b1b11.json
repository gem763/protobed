These spaces often require us to raise the floor height, level the floors between ramps and incorporate design techniques that bring natural light into the space.\"\n\n\u2014 Diane Hoskins, Gensler co-CEO\n\nChanging old zoning codes, which require a lot of parking, could allow developers to put the money for parking decks or garages (upwards of $15,ooo per space) toward affordable housing or other uses, writes Angelo Carusi of Cooper Carry, an architecture and design firm.\n\nWhat's happening: Parking garages are morphing into more colorful, productive, resilient and surprising uses.\n\nIn Chicago, a parking garage under Millennium Park is being converted into an e-commerce delivery logistics center.\n\nUnderground parking garages in L.A. and other cities are turning into shared commercial kitchens for on-demand, delivery-only food services.\n\nThe roofs of parking garages are being used as urban greenhouses and farms in Denver and Seattle. And in Paris, an abandoned garage was converted into a growing space for mushrooms and roots that don't need sunlight.\n\nNear the World Trade Center site in New York, a parking garage known as the Vehicle Security Center now plays a key role in protecting the area's transportation and communication infrastructure from storm surge. (It also has a living wall of plants and its roof doubles as an elevated park.)\n\nA neglected garage in Wichita was turned into 44 high-end apartment units, but other efforts to turn old parking garages into affordable housing haven't gotten far.\n\nSan Francisco's plan to redevelop a 732-space garage into a mixed-use complex with 100 affordable housing units was nixed after opposition.\n\nL.A. worked with Gensler to redevelop a parking garage as supportive housing with pre-fabricated modules, but it hasn't moved past concept stage.\n\nWhen parking structures can't support residential or office loads, they can be turned into parking spaces for autonomous vehicles and charging stations for electric vehicles.\n\nGo deeper: The companies trying to re-imagine parking spots", "description": "Developers are looking for new ways to use all that space.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/E8nXtSpg-y97nQ_M4sEF46_Mmek=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/10/29/1572386830455.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
