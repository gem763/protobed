The suspect, whose identity is being withheld, will not face incarceration.\n\nIf convicted, the suspect will likely undergo mandatory therapy, psychological evaluation and counseling, according to Minger.\n\nThe fire at the Timberline Mobile Home Park in Goodfield claimed the lives of Kathryn Murray, 69; Jason Wall, 34; Rose Alwood, 2; Daemeon Wall, 2; and Ariel Wall, 1. Two others managed to escape.\n\nThe Woodford County State\u2019s Attorney Office did not respond to ABC News' requests for comment.", "description": "The mobile home in Goodfield, Illinois, fire left 5 people dead, including three children.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/police-01-as-gty-190813_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
