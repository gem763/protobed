But by the time the contract would have been awarded, because of the lengthy government contracting process, Relativity Space had grown to 110 employees with a launch pad at Cape Canaveral in Florida.\n\nThis discrepancy between the speed of government and speed of Silicon Valley means the government could miss out getting in on the ground floor of innovative technologies if the companies are moving too fast for the federal contracting process.\n\n\u201cThe sticking point I usually see is if there\u2019s some kind of government award or policy process that takes six to 18 months to enable, you can apply for those things or be talking about policy changes but six to 18 months later you\u2019re an entirely different company,\u201d said Ellis, who designed his own Lego rockets as a child and worked at Blue Origin before founding Relativity Space in 2015.\n\nThe company announced this week it has raised $140 million in late-stage, or Series C, funding to fully finance its Terran 1 rocket, which is expected to fly for the first time in early 2021. Commercial launches are also expected to begin that year at a cost of $10 million per launch, Ellis said.\n\nEllis, the youngest member of the National Space Council's User Advisory Group, also spoke about how unlike traditional space launch vehicles the company's rockets can be updated following each launch in much less time and at lower cost than in a traditional factory, as well as how the firm is working to overcome lingering resistance to the company's innovative approach.\n\n\"You always find pockets of hesitancy for sure,\" he says. \"That still exists. But our biggest argument there is \u2026 the opportunity exists for Relativity to be the first [3D printed rocket,] entirely designed, built, and operated in the U.S. If we are not the first to build it, someone else will be, so that\u2019s been our argument.\"\n\nThis transcript has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhat does it mean to complete this Series C funding?\n\nWe\u2019ve closed $140 million in Series C funding. It\u2019s a milestone for Relativity, because now we\u2019re fully funded to launch Terran 1 to orbit. That\u2019s our rocket launch vehicle for satellites and the first 3D printed rocket ever made anywhere in the world. It\u2019s going to be not just an iconic milestone for serving the growing ... small satellite launch market, but also an iconic milestone for the 3D printing industry.\n\nWhat are your next steps now that you\u2019ve received funding?\n\nOver the past year, momentum has been growing. \u2026 We have a 220,000 square foot factory at NASA Stennis. We have a launch site secured at Cape Canaveral at Launch Complex 16. All of the infrastructure is in place to finish development of Terran 1. The next steps are finishing development of the Stargate factory, that\u2019s the world\u2019s largest 3D metal printing factory. We\u2019re using that to print the first flight version of Terran 1 \u2026 with the first launch in early 2021 and commercial service also beginning in 2021.\n\nWho are your new investors?\n\nThe new funding round is led by Bond together with Tribe Capital. Bond is really a world class venture capitalist. \u2026 The entire team at Bond has an incredible track record funding some of the largest companies in the world that are privately owned, so having their buy in to what we're building is a huge sign of confidence in both the technology and our business case.\n\nOther new investors include Lee Fixel on the Forbes Midas list [of top tech investors], Michael Ovits who founded Creative Artists Agency and was briefly president of Disney. Spencer Rascoff was a co-founder of [real estate website] Zillow.com, and we have [actor and tech investor ] Jared Leto. \u2026 That shows we have a diversity of capital sources. It\u2019s not just Silicon Valley venture capitalists, but it\u2019s also people who have very significant political and financial connections in many different industries. \u2026 It shows there\u2019s more people who are very sophisticated who believe in what we\u2019re doing.", "description": "Government programs designed to incubate promising new technologies can\u2019t keep pace with the rapid growth of venture-backed space start-ups, says the CEO of Relativity Space, a small launch company that is building 3D printed rockets.
