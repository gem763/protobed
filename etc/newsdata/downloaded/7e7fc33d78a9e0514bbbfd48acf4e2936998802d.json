The Lira programming language, recently referred to* as one of the \u201cmost imaginative things happening in DeFi today\u201d is one of only two such open source solutions on the market, and is all the more exclusive since it is formally verified.\n\nResponding to the announcement, eToro CEO Yoni Assia commented: \u201ceToro has long held the belief that we will eventually see all tradable financial assets tokenized. Lira, our open source programming language, is a step towards making this a reality, enabling the entire community to write and deploy secure financial contracts on Ethereum. The workshop where this was announced was a central event at Devcon, which is significant in demonstrating how the blockchain community shares our vision for open finance.\u201d\n\nDr. Ross commented: \u201cI am delighted to see the excitement of the community in response to this project. Developers will now be able to use Lira to create new business protocols, with the aim of improving inefficiencies within the traditional financial industry, thereby opening it up yet further.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the launch of Lira version 2.0, Nicolas Arqueros, CTO of Emurgo said: \u201cI believe that Lira is an innovative and important breakthrough in the world of DeFi, with real promise to open up the traditional financial world.\u201d\n\nYoav Weiss, CTO of Tabookey added: \u201cI am certain that over the next couple of years, we will see many people using Lira and helping it develop, to achieve real progress in financial business efficiency, and realize the goals to open up finance.\u201d\n\nLira is secure, easily programmable and allows contracts between assets on the Ethereum Blockchain to settle instantly, enables automated programmable trades and monitoring, and reduces transaction costs and the need for middle parties.\n\n* Lex Sokolin, Global Fintech Co-Head, ConsenSys\n\nAbout eToroX\n\neToroX is a subsidiary of the eToro Group.
