He denies any 'sexual contact or relationship' with her or any 'impropriety with underage minors'\n\nOn Wednesday in Perth the sole onlooker arriving to cheer the Duke's visit to Murdoch University was Renae Grljusich-Poolman, a teacher and Royal hunter.\n\nThe Prince waved during his visit but there was only one well-wisher there\n\nShe told The Australian she was not surprised by the turnout. 'It is disappointing. It has marred his credibility,' she said.\n\nMeanwhile the challenge faced by Andrew in restoring his role promoting pet causes was highlighted in an analysis of his Australia trip by Daniela Elser, a former Marie Claire executive who described the low turnout in Perth as 'a new, deeply embarrassing low point'.\n\nElser wrote: 'On Monday night, Andrew slipped into the country, landing in Perth.\n\n'There was no fanfare. No lead-up press coverage.\n\n'It was an extraordinarily subdued and unusual arrival that looked a lot like he was trying to steal into the country without attracting media attention.'\n\nAndrew was in Australia to promote a 'boot camp' for his entrepreneurs' initiative Pitch@Palace.", "description": "Teacher and 'royal hunter'\u00a0Renae Grljusich-Poolman was the only well-wisher when Andrew visited Murdoch University in Perth on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Joel Adams For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/10/19386998-0-image-a-2_1570438831082.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
