A federal grand jury in Manhattan has been hearing evidence for the past year in a probe that is being led by the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the paper reported. Investigators are looking closely at the money trail between USA Swimming, the organization that represents amateur swimming across the U.S., including local clubs, right up to the selection of the Olympic team, and its insurance company and foundation, the paper said. A spokeswoman for USA Swimming said it \"supports any government investigation that goes toward protecting athletes,\" and that it stands by the integrity of its finances. The probe is one of several to stem from sexual-abuse scandals that have erupted in Olympic sports in the past few years, including one of gymnastics that found hundreds of young girls had been abused over years by team doctor Larry Nassar.", "description": "Federal prosecutors in New York are investigating USA Swimming over allegations that it suppressed sexual-abuse claims, concealed its assets and improperly...", "authors": ["Ciara Linnane", "Corporate News Editor"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png"}
