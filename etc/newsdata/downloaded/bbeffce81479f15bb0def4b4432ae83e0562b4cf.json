At 6pm at the Estadi Johan Cruyff, for the first time ever, FC Barcelona Femen\u00ed will play Real Madrid \u2013 even if they are not actually called that yet. By popular demand Madrid have finally joined the women\u2019s professional game and they make their debut in Catalonia against the team set to be their great adversaries, last season\u2019s league and Champions League runners-up. Tickets are on sale from \u20ac5 and they anticipate a full house for a historic rivalry with an entire history still to be written, starting right there.\n\nOfficially Barcelona face Club Deportivo Tac\u00f3n but their opponents will play in white; they have been preparing for this match \u2013 their first in the first division \u2013 at Real Madrid\u2019s Valdebebas training ground, where they will also play their home games; they made gal\u00e1ctico signings over the summer; and they have been integrated into the structure at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u. Soon, they will change their name too: next season, CD Tac\u00f3n will be known as what they have become: Real Madrid\u2019s women\u2019s team.\n\nAmy Rodgers: 'It felt as if I'd been a Liverpool fan all my life' Read more\n\nMadrid announced a \u20ac400,000 deal to take over Tac\u00f3n in June, although the move has to be ratified by the club\u2019s assembly this month. Madrid had been under pressure to found a women\u2019s team for some time and, while there were doubts about the best way to do so, Tac\u00f3n\u2019s promotion to the first division was an opportunity to finalise an agreement that they had been working on for some time.\n\nTac\u00f3n\u2019s name comes from the words trabajo (work), atrevimiento (daring/bravery), conocimiento (knowledge), organizaci\u00f3n (organisation) and notoriedad (notoriety) and spells out high heel \u2013 the logo of the club until Real Madrid\u2019s replaces it. The club\u2019s president, Ana Rosell, is a former player at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid but was both a socio (member) and a compromisario at Real Madrid \u2013 one of those chosen members with a voice and vote at the club\u2019s assemblies. The vice-president is Sergio Ramos\u2019s brother, Ren\u00e9.\n\nTac\u00f3n initially began with girls\u2019 youth teams in 2014 but merged with Canillas, a team from the north-east of the city, in 2016. That allowed for a senior team. Rossell had first proposed collaboration with Real Madrid three years ago.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Former Real Madrid player Roberto Carlos (bottom row, right) and current Real Madrid players and staff watch Tac\u00f3n\u2019s friendly against Sevilla.

Ulloa said he was not sure about \u201cselling\u201d the club to Real Madrid; he would have preferred to collaborate with them.\n\nRosell will continue to run Tac\u00f3n/Real Madrid following the \u20ac400,000 deal and the new team is expected to have a budget of around \u20ac2m \u2013 more than any side in Spain other than FC Barcelona. This summer they signed the US-English striker Chioma Ubogagu, Swedish internationals Kosovare Asllani and Sofia Jakobsson, and the Brazilian international Thaisa.\n\nTwenty-one per cent of Real Madrid\u2019s socios are women and demands for them to have a women\u2019s team go back five years. Barcelona\u2019s women\u2019s team was founded in 1998, Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s in 2001 and Athletic Club Bilbao\u2019s in 2002. The club was unsure of the best way to found the side: president Florentino P\u00e9rez had said he favoured building a team from scratch, starting at youth level, yet he had also said on other occasions that there was little point in having a women\u2019s team unless it was built to \u201cwin\u201d. That idea has prevailed with the move to bring Tac\u00f3n on board following their promotion and the subsequent signings.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kosovare Asllani, one of Tac\u00f3n\u2019s summer signings, in action. Photograph: Cordon Press/Alamy Live News\n\nIf there could be some unease at the appropriation of a women\u2019s team, it is a process that has been followed before \u2013 Atl\u00e9tico and Barcelona built their own sides, but Betis, Sevilla, Deportivo and Valencia all merged with existing clubs \u2013 and these moves were widely welcomed as raising the profile of the women\u2019s game, which has grown enormously in recent years.\n\nOn the day the deal was announced, the sports daily Marca led on a photoshopped image depicting Real Madrid women\u2019s players celebrating a goal in the club\u2019s kit. \u201cWomen\u2019s football goes into another dimension,\u201d the headline said.\n\nSome criticised that headline. After all, it had already come a long way and there had been other breakthroughs. Spain\u2019s women had only narrowly been knocked out by the world champions USA in the World Cup, which was a big TV success this summer; Barcelona, who had the England striker Toni Duggan among their ranks, had reached the Champions League final; and a match between Atl\u00e9tico and Barcelona had attracted 60,738 to the Wanda Metropolitano. And yet few doubted that it was true: this was a significant step.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Barcelona\u2019s players celebrate a goal during last season\u2019s match against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid at the Wanda Metropolitano in Madrid.

It\u2019s a great club and they\u2019ll bet heavily on women\u2019s football,\u201d the Barcelona player Andrea Pereira said. Her teammate, the Spain international Mapi Le\u00f3n, insisted: \u201cIt is good for women\u2019s football to have Real Madrid there.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a club with a lot of \u2018pull\u2019,\u201d the Atl\u00e9tico captain, Amanda Sampedro, joked. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have them but only if we can beat them; if not, don\u2019t come.\u201d", "description": "The Spanish women\u2019s football season opens this weekend with Barcelona v Real Madrid, though the visitors are strictly not yet called that", "authors": ["Sid Lowe"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77aa05d94b08b1f92179314a5a5af35f34b94a17/0_335_7086_4253/master/7086.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=16c825b979912420c438e9e9f4397220", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
