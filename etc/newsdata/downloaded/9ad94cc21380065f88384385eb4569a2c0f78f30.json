He also listed a number of complaints against China, which he said had abused its membership in the World Trade Organization by using it to carry out an unfair trade agenda.\n\n\"People are worried about 2020 and the global trade war and overlapped with that, you've got these issues of impeachment,\" said Patrick Spencer, managing director at U.S. investment firm Baird. A trade deal with China \"may be watered down, but it's going to happen,\" he said.\n\nBrent crude oil, the global benchmark, shed 1.6% to $61.13 barrel on signs that U.S. inventories may have climbed. Energy Information Administration data due out later will be closely scrutinized for similar signals, strategists at ING said.\n\nThe trade and political tensions added to concerns about global economic growth and weighed on the commodity's price. Saudi Arabia has tried to reassure the market about repair work at its damaged facilities following attacks earlier this month. The oil market has been volatile since those attacks raised concerns about disruptions to global supply.\n\n\"It's a tug of war between supply side news and demand side news, \" said Marco Valli, head of macro research at UniCredit Bank in Milan, adding that markets are being driven by \"risk-off sentiment\" and concerns that U.S.-China trade tensions and slowing global growth could weigh on appetite for oil.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 equity index dropped 0.5% and the British pound declined 0.9% against the U.S. dollar. On Tuesday, Britain's Supreme Court ruled that Prime Minister Boris Johnson acted unlawfully by suspending Parliament, ramping up pressure on him to reach a Brexit deal with the European Union. The ruling hurts Mr. Johnson's authority and could complicate negotiations with Brussels, reducing the chances of a Brexit deal being reached by the end of October, according to analysts at UniCredit.\n\n\"What we're watching for is what the next move is from the Johnson government, what tone they decide to take going forward,\" said Lyn Graham-Taylor, a rates strategist at Rabobank.\n\nAmong the biggest losers in European equities was EDF, whose shares dropped 6.9%. The company said the estimated cost of nuclear reactors it is building in the U.K. will be higher than it had projected earlier.\n\nIn U.S. off-hours trading, shares in Nike rose 4.8% after the company posted higher sales, boosted by gains in China. Philip Morris shares rose 7.2% in premarket trading after talks regarding a merger with Altria Group ended. Altria rose 2.1%.\n\nLater in the day, investors will watch for the latest data on sales of new homes in August from the U.S. Commerce Department to gauge the impact of recent rate cuts. Economists are forecasting a 3.8% increase, after a drop in purchases in July.\n\nThe yield on 10-year U.S. Treasurys rose to 1.646% from 1.632% on Tuesday, while the WSJ dollar index gained 0.4%.\n\nWrite to Avantika Chilkoti at Avantika.Chilkoti@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 25, 2019 09:16 ET (13:16 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
