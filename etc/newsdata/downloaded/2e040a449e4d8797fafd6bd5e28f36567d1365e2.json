An applicable plug-in point will replenish the battery to 75% capacity in an hour\n\nVolkswagen claims the all-electric car has a top speed of 93mph, though you won't want to drive it at those speeds for too long as the range will quickly disappear\n\nAs one This is Money reader points out, VW might have missed a trick calling it the e-Beetle...\n\nThis means the batteries can be boosted up to 75 per cent capacity in around an hour.\n\nThe removal of the rear-mounted petrol engine from the car also means the Beetle - for the first time ever - offers a usable amount of boot space.\n\nNo price has been revealed for the conversion, with details being withheld until this gorgeous Cabriolet conversion car is presented at the Frankfurt Motor Show next week.\n\nThe claimed range for the converted e-Beetle is 124 miles, says Volkswagen\n\nReplacement of the rear-mounted engine means the classic Beetle now gets a decent about of boot space\n\nNo price has been revealed for the conversion, with details being withheld until it appears in Frankfurt next week\n\nOwners will be able to charge the car from a public charge point or a socket at home\n\nIt has been reported that eClassics and VW will also work together on future electric takes on the legendary Camper and even the 365 sports car and could begin using parts from Volkswagen's upcoming I.D. range of electric vehicles, which promise much longer driving distances and shorter charge times.\n\nThis isn't the first time brands have offered to electrify their iconic models.\n\nJaguar will convert a Jaguar E-Type into an EV for the sum of \u00a3350,000. The launch car for the Jaguar Classic project was even used by Harry and Meghan to drive to their wedding reception last year.\n\nThe traditional dials in the cabin will be replaced with ones that show the remaining range available to drivers\n\nWould you want to convert a classic car into an electric vehicle for the future?\n\nIf you happen to have an old Jaguar E-Type laying around (because we all do, right?), you can give Jaguar Classic \u00a3350,000 and they'll convert it into an electric model", "description": "Beetle owners now have the chance to future-proof their vehicles by swapping out the internal-combustion engine and replacing it with a battery and electric motor from VW's current e-Up! model.", "authors": ["Rob Hull For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
