We have no doubt that our sister would have been holding and hugging him to the last, protecting and comforting her little boy, despite knowing that there was no hope for them inside that tower.\n\n'Biruk entered this world greeted by love, the love of his mother's face, and we are sure he left this world looking at the love of that same beautiful face. These thoughts sustain us in our darkest hours.'\n\n\u2013 Gloria Trevisan (floor 23)\n\nItalian architect Gloria Trevisan, 26, was robbed of the chance to fulfil a promising career when she died with her boyfriend Marco Gottardi.\n\nAt the inquiry her employer Peregrine Bryant said 'even in that short time she demonstrated what she could do and demonstrated what talent she had'.\n\nGloria Trevisan\n\nA voiceover in a video tribute package said Gloria was a 'beautiful girl' whose kindness and big heart 'didn't go unnoticed for anyone who met her'.\n\nHer mother told the inquiry: 'Gloria was a girl full of life.
