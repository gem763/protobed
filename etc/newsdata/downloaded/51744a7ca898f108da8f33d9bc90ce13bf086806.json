Saudi Arabia mobilized a military coalition in 2015 to back Yemen\u2019s internationally-recognized government against the Shiite rebels.\n\nThe Houthis, in a statement carried by the Saba news agency, said they destroyed three enemy brigades after \u201cjust 72 hours of the operation.\u201d\n\nThousands of people have been taken prisoners, including \u201cmany Saudi commanders, officers and soldiers.\u201d A spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen didn\u2019t immediately return a request for comment.\n\nThe announcement comes almost two weeks after the Houthis took credit for the devastating attack on key Saudi Aramco oil facilities that briefly halved the country\u2019s output and rattled global markets this month. The U.S. and Saudi Arabia blamed Iran for the attack, which they said wasn\u2019t launched from Yemen.\n\nYahya Saree, a spokesman for the Houthi-controlled forces, said those captured would be paraded on the group\u2019s TV network on Sunday, the BBC reported.\n\nLast week, the Houthis announced a unilateral halt to the hundreds of drone and missile attacks that have targeted OPEC\u2019s largest producer in recent years. An official with the Saudi-backed Yemeni government said Friday that the kingdom has agreed to a ceasefire in several areas of Yemen including the capital Sana\u2019a.\n\nSaudi Arabia views the conflict with the Houthis as a proxy war with Iran.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Mohammed Hatem in Dubai at mhatem1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alaa Shahine at asalha@bloomberg.net, Ros Krasny\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels said they captured many Saudi soldiers and officers in a large operation near the border between the two countries on Saturday, shortly after the kingdom agreed to a limited ceasefire with the Iranian-backed group.If true, the escalation will likely deal a blow to", "authors": ["Mohammed Hatem"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
