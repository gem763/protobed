Madonna and Sandra Bernhard, who used to order the Cosmo at Odeon straight from the drink\u2019s creator, Toby Cecchini.\n\n\u201cThey could never remember the name of it, so they would just call it the \u2018pink drink\u2019 and call me \u2018boyfriend,\u2019\u201d Cecchini says, reminiscing about the drink\u2019s origins earlier this month at his Brooklyn cocktail den The Long Island Bar over a retro soundtrack of Rick Astley and New Order. \u201cAnd Sandra scared the hell out of me.\u201d\n\nThirty-one years since the drink\u2019s debut, the Cosmopolitan is not-so-improbably making a comeback. Some of it has to do with the tipple\u2019s association with Cointreau (the French liqueur in Cecchini\u2019s drink recipe), which has recently pushed out new recipes and prioritized the cocktail at press and promotional events.\n\nA Cosmo class with Toby Cecchini and Alfred Cointreau (Benjamin Lozovsky/BFA.com)\n\nBut some of the reclaimed interest comes with time. The cocktail renaissance may have happened years after the Cosmo originated, but it\u2019s still a drink with a purpose, fresh ingredients and measured, consistent proportions.\n\nOf course, if you\u2019ve ordered a Cosmopolitan in the last two decades, chances are you had a bad, cloyingly sweet version. That is the fault of bad bartending \u2014 not the cocktail itself. To set things right, we recently took a Cosmo class at Cecchini\u2019s bar and talked with the drink\u2019s creator about common misperceptions, weathering the Sex and the City association and where the Cosmo fits in with the 21st century cocktail scene.\n\nWhat we learned \u2026\n\nThe Cosmopolitan was inspired by a drink called \u2026 The Cosmopolitan\n\n\n\nBartending at Odeon in 1988 (where Basquiat, Warhol and Keith Haring were regulars), Cecchini was introduced to a drink called The Cosmopolitan by a female coworker. \u201cShe went to San Francisco and came back and showed me this drink that was being consumed in all the gay and leather bars. It was made with rail vodka, Rose\u2019s lime juice and Rose\u2019s grenadine. I thought it was amazingly pretty, super cute and \u2026 disgusting. Cecchini remixed the drink, added a citrus vodka (\u201cit was new and cool at the time\u201d), fresh lime juice and Cointreau, which was being used for the restaurant\u2019s margaritas. Cranberry juice was also added to maintain the drink\u2019s pink hue.\n\nThe original proportions were a bit off\n\n\n\n\u201cMy drink\u2019s spec [ratio] was 2, 1, 1 and \u2018some\u2019 at the time\u201d says Cecchini, referring to the citrus vodka, Cointreau, lime juice and cranberry juice, respectively. \u201cIt was only a few years ago when I sat down and realized \u2018some\u2019 wasn\u2019t an actual spec.\u201d That some became 1, and the proportions were slimmed down to 1.5 oz. of vodka and .75 oz of the modifiers, partially so the drink wouldn\u2019t have to be contained in an oversized martini glass. \u201cThe original drank came in 10.5-oz glasses! It was such an \u201880s pour. That was a drink like the hair was in the 80s.\u201d\n\nThe Cosmo was a hit well before Samantha, Carrie et al. discovered it\n\n\n\nCecchini originally made the drink for the Odeon staff. Then a few regulars started asking for it. \u201cIt was even weirder when someone I didn\u2019t know asked for it,\u201d he says. Soon bastardized variations began popping up in the area. Says Cecchini: \u201cIt was a downtown New York phenomenon for about 2-3 years. But like all trends, it waxed and waned.\u201d It certainly was not the drink of the moment when Sex and the City debuted a decade later.\n\nIt\u2019s the rare drink with a history you can source\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen you start researching the history of different drinks, there are a lot of false starts and apocrypha,\u201d says Cecchini. \u201cThings get muddy. Fortunately for me, I know where this drink came from! But that\u2019s not how the entire world sees it. I had to take ownership at one point, and that wasn\u2019t too tough, because there were enough people and regulars around me to remember when it was created.\u201d\n\nCointreau and Cecchini making Cosmos at The Long Island Bar (Kirk Miller)\n\nWhatever you think of the taste of the Cosmo, remember the source\n\n\n\nAs noted above, The Cosmopolitan is a very proportionate drink. It\u2019s also not sweet when made to the original recipe. \u201cIt\u2019s built on the same specs as any sour you can think of, like a margarita or sidecar,\u201d says Cecchini. \u201cI skew toward dry and tart. I made this to be a punch in the teeth. It makes a statement.\u201d He adds: \u201cPeople have made fun of me for this drink, but made properly, this is an adult cocktail.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a cocktail with vodka, and that\u2019s just fine in 2019\n\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to apologize for vodka anymore,\u201d says Cecchini. \u201cEverything that goes around comes around. Vodka got a bad rap because every generation has to reject what their parents embraced. And the \u201890s was about nothing but vodka! Now, people have no recollection. Soon, they\u2019ll be like, \u2018Enough with the rye! Vodka\u2019s something new, right? It\u2019s so clean and pure.\u2019\u201d\n\nSex and the City has made no difference in Cecchini\u2019s life\n\n\n\nBesides not being able to patent a cocktail, the second coming of the Cosmo during the HBO series\u2019 heyday didn\u2019t do much for the drink\u2019s creator. \u201cTo this day, I have never seen an episode.\u201d\n\nYou can stray from the original recipe\n\n\n\nCecchini recently introduced two variations on the original Cosmopolitan, one with ginger (which makes everything better) and one completely deconstructed take that\u2019s redone as a highball. \u201cThat\u2019s very much in the zeitgeist right now,\u201d says Cecchini, and hey, the man should know.\n\nBelow, you\u2019ll find both of those recipes along the timeless original. And if you\u2019re in Cecchini\u2019s neck of the woods, remember to order them the way Madonna and Bernhard did: \u201cBoyfriend!
