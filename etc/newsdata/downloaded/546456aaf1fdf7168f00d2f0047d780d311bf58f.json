A badge of honor is a badge, be it a medal or pin or a piece of cloth, given by the government or some other authority to honor or praise someone for some heroic deed or other notable contribution or achievement.\n\nFor example, a soldier may be awarded a badge of courage for his bravery on the battlefield. A teacher may get a badge upon retirement for an exemplary career.\n\nAnyways, a badge is so designed that the receiver can wear it on the chest or the shoulder or the arm.\n\nNow, back to our topic, the quote in which someone opines that we \u201clive in a culture that wears lack of sleep like a badge\u201d.\n\nThis means that people are actually proud of the fact that they don\u2019t get enough sleep at night.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause, because, well, because if they don\u2019t get enough sleep at night, they must be very busy and, by extension, they must have a lot of things to do, they must be important in some way or other.\n\nIn other words, they must be in the thick of things.\n\nPeople, for instance, have a lot of meetings at the work place, especially in a government agency. When you call someone on the phone in the morning, he or she will say \u201cI\u2019m in a meeting.\u201d You call them an hour later, and they\u2019re still in a meeting. You call them in the afternoon, and they\u2019re still in a meeting, perhaps a different one.\n\nI\u2019ve heard various people sum up their working day this way: \u201cI\u2019m either in a meeting or on my way to one.\u201d\n\nThese people certainly wear their meeting-to-meeting existence at work like a badge, like a badge of honor, like a badge of pride.\n\nOr in case they\u2019re just being humorous, like a badge of irony.\n\nIn short, to wear one\u2019s lack of sleep like a badge is to refuse to feel ashamed of that fact.\n\nQuite to the contrary, they tend to feel proud.\n\nPerverts, you say?\n\nWell, that says a lot about the society we live in, a society that drives people so hard that in order to succeed and succeed even more they have to sacrifice their sleep.\n\nAnd forced to feel good about it, too.\n\nWell, lack of sleep is a big negative, period. If you really want to view it as a positive, you do so at your own peril.\n\nAll right, here are media examples of people who wear this and that like a badge, metaphorically speaking, i.e. usually defiantly reinterpreting something negative said about them as something positive:\n\n\n\n1. Jenna Dewan Tatum isn\u2019t forcing veganism on her 4-year-old daughter, but it sounds like the child is becoming a proud vegetarian.\n\n\u201cI eat mostly vegan, but I\u2019m very accommodating, maybe because I\u2019ve lived with a man for 11 years who\u2019s not vegetarian. Evie is a vegetarian, mostly because I cook for her and it\u2019s what I feel to be healthy for her and easiest,\u201d the \u201cWorld of Dance\u201d host explained in the March issue of Health.\n\n\u201cShe loves it and wears it like a badge. She will tell everyone, \u2018I\u2019m a vegetarian. I don\u2019t eat meat,\u2019 and I tell her, \u2018Ev, you can try anything you want,\u2019 but she\u2019s like, \u2018Ugh\u2019\u2014very much a chip off the old block in that way.\u201d\n\nThough husband Channing Tatum will do meatless meals, including pasta and risotto, Dewan Tatum, 37, notes there are additional ingredients to a happy marriage besides meals at the dinner table.\n\n\u201cWhen people say you guys have such a perfect life, I want to scream and tell them no one\u2019s perfect,\u201d she said. \u201cI think there are such things as great fits. It is a great fit as long as you are growing together, and I think up until this point we\u2019ve really grown together. Even if one starts to grow, the other catches up and vice versa.\u201d\n\n- Jenna Dewan Tatum raising daughter as a vegetarian, PageSix.com, February 6, 2018.\n\n\n\n2. In high school and university, I was an absolute coffee addict. I used to down shots of espresso without feeling a thing. I had at least a cup a day, if not two or three \u2014 usually with four sugars and some milk. That all changed when I became vegan and began taking better care of myself. I have eczema, and in the process of healing my skin, I discovered that drinking coffee or tea seemed to make it worse. I decided to cut out caffeine for good.\n\nIt was only after giving up coffee that I realized how much I relied on it. I had grown accustomed to staying up super late, knowing that an energy drink, espresso, or cup of coffee would be waiting for me in the morning. By midday, I\u2019d crash and have another. Eventually, I built up such a tolerance that I\u2019d come home from class and immediately fall asleep. Needless to say, those first days without caffeine were tough \u2014 everywhere I went, it seemed to be taunting me \u2014 but after a few weeks, the idea of having a cup of coffee barely crossed my mind.\n\nI knew I had to make some changes, so I trained myself to go to bed two to three hours earlier. (Turns out, sleep is the best solution for being tired.) I started a new morning routine, practicing yoga or doing some quick stretches to get the juices flowing. At a cafe, I substituted my usual coffee for a smoothie or caffeine-free tea (chamomile is my favorite). And most importantly, I stopped wearing my exhaustion like a badge of honor.\n\nFor years I had felt that I needed to push my body to the limit to be good enough. Then I picked up a book called The Tao of Pooh by Benjamin Hoff, in which Taoist principles are explained through the beloved cartoon. In one chapter, Hoff writes about the \u201cBisy Backson,\u201d someone who\u2019s constantly doing something, who never has a moment to waste. He notes that the Bisy Backson feels important and productive, but their actions are actually counterproductive, because they only cause unnecessary stress. If I wanted to feel better without caffeine, I had to change my mindset, too.\n\n- I Gave Up Caffeine For a Year, and I\u2019m Actually More Energetic, by Michelle Ku, PopSugar.com, September 20, 2018.\n\n\n\n3. Joanna Lumley has said Brexit has distracted politicians from focusing on environmental issues, as she called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to introduce a levy on single-use plastic bottles.\n\nThe Absolutely Fabulous actress said the reliance on water bottles made of plastic is causing an environmental crisis which will destroy the planet.\n\nShe told PA: \u201cI think it sometimes is extremely hard when there is something grabbing the headlines.\n\n\u201cBut I am now going to say something a bit controversial, I think that women are able to cope with lots of different things at the same time so the single issue thing might be a man thing, I\u2019m just thinking of Brexit, I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t think of anything else.\n\n\u201cWe (women) are always having to think of a thousand different things and I think women go \u2018Brexit, I wonder what is going to happen then\u2026 but look about this water\u2026\u2019 and I think we can do that and at the same time we can wonder what time the children are coming back from school and what we are going to cook for supper and how we are going to do stuff on top of that.\n\n\u201cWe can do a lot of those things, so maybe this is something that women have to wake up to.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cYou\u2019ve got water in your home, it\u2019s called tap, so it is largely up to the women and if in the fridge there is always a jug of delicious water or a bottle of water, cold and ready for you to take out, maybe women at home have to do that.\n\n\u201cWhether you\u2019re a mother or a housewife or a single person or a person like me, just caring, just do it. It\u2019s not so hard.\n\n\u201cWe all hated wearing safety belts and guess what, we do it, it\u2019s just as simple as that. Just change now, do it today.\u201d\n\n...\n\nLumley said she believes it is important to use her platform to draw attention to issues she cares about, adding: \u201cAlmost the only benefit of fame, I would say, is being able to draw attention to things.\n\n\u201cThat is all fame is worth, it\u2019s worth nothing else. But if you\u2019ve got it for whatever reason it\u2019s usually just from being on things, like on television shows.\n\n\u201cA prima ballerina is not famous, she will walk down the street and you won\u2019t notice her, an opera singer won\u2019t be noticed, but television makes you famous so now you\u2019ve got it, you\u2019re wearing it like a badge and you can\u2019t get it off, it\u2019s more like a tattoo.\n\n\u201cSo use the tattoo beautifully and make sure that what you espouse is a true and good cause, put that in the front of your heart.\n\n\u201cMoney is always lovely but make sure that behind it is something that you truly believe in and if you can influence a few people to think \u2018I will try that\u2019, that sounds like a good thing.\u201d\n\n- TV.BT.Com, Joanna Lumley calls on Boris Johnson to tax single-use plastics, August 12, 2019.\n\n\u672c\u6587\u4ec5\u4ee3\u8868\u4f5c\u8005\u672c\u4eba\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u4e0e\u672c\u7f51\u7acb\u573a\u65e0\u5173\u3002\u6b22\u8fce\u5927\u5bb6\u8ba8\u8bba\u5b66\u672f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c0a\u91cd\u4ed6\u4eba\uff0c\u7981\u6b62\u4eba\u8eab\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u53d1\u5e03\u4e00\u5207\u8fdd\u53cd\u56fd\u5bb6\u73b0\u884c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6cd5\u89c4\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\n\nAbout the author:\n\nZhang Xin is Trainer at chinadaily.com.cn.
