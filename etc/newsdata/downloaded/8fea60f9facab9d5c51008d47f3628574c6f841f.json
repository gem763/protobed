The government sees brick and mortar as more of a dying industry.\"\n\nBut Walmart isn't going anywhere. It has transformed into a 21st-century company that's doing everything Amazon is doing \u2014 and it's neck-and-neck with Amazon in a few high-tech areas that are considered the tech giant's home turf, like drone delivery and same-day shipping.\n\nInvestigators are under intense political pressure from lawmakers and consumers to do something about Big Tech, says Hubbard. But \"the political pressure just isn't there to investigate Walmart. The places where Walmart has large grocery market share are not places where policy activists live.\"\n\nAmazon is new to the U.S. grocery business, of which Walmart already owns 13%.\n\nIn many parts of America, Walmart's dominance is far more pronounced. The retailer has more than 50% market share in 203 cities and towns, and more than 70% in 38 of those places, per a recent report from the Institute for Local Self-Reliance (ILSR).\n\nMany of these towns are among the most economically distressed in the nation.\n\n\"No other grocer in the history of the country has ever had this kind of market share,\" says Stacy Mitchell, co-director at ILSR, a nonprofit research and advocacy group that opposes concentrated economic power.\n\nWhen it comes to all U.S. retail spending, Walmart takes 8.9% and Amazon 6.4%.\n\nJeff Bezos has become the American billionaire archetype. But also consider the Walton family of Walmart fortune: six members of the family have more wealth than the bottom 41% of Americans.\n\nWhat to watch: Not only is Walmart avoiding the antitrust spotlight, but it is also helping fuel the techlash against its competitors.\n\nThe Free and Fair Markets Institute, which called itself a \"grassroots campaign\" to topple Amazon, is funded by Walmart, reports WSJ.\n\nWalmart is also part of the Retail Industry Leaders Association that has written to the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department with concerns that Amazon and Google stifle competition, the LA Times reports.\n\nWorth noting: A major driver of the global antitrust probes into Amazon is the fact that it simultaneously operates as an e-commerce platform and an individual seller \u2014 it's the mall, but it also has its own store within the mall, in the best location.\n\nWalmart's online platform isn't nearly as powerful as Amazon's. \"When we ask sellers who are fed up with Amazon why they don't switch to Walmart.com, they say the volume just isn't there,\" Hubbard says.\n\nThe bottom line: \"The fad to hate Walmart has been overshadowed,\" says Eleanor Fox, an NYU antitrust law professor.", "description": "Smart, efficient news worthy of your time, attention, and trust", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://assets.axios.com/203e9f932cc97836ac2ff4c6c982676c.png", "published_at": "2019-02-25"}
