Quinn of ESPN is reporting that Major League Baseball could fine the Los Angeles Angels up to $2 million \u201cif Major League Baseball determines that team employees were told of Tyler Skaggs\u2019 opioid use prior to his July 1 death and didn\u2019t inform the commissioner\u2019s office.\u201d\n\nThe fine would be pursuant to the terms of the Joint Drug Agreement which affirmatively requires any team employee who isn\u2019t a player to inform the Commissioner\u2019s Office of \u201cany evidence or reason to believe that a Player \u2026 has used, possessed or distributed any substance prohibited\u201d by MLB.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAs was reported last weekend, Eric Kay, the Angels Director of Communications, told DEA agents that he and at least one other high-ranking Angels official knew of Skaggs\u2019 opioid use. The Angels have denied any knowledge of Skaggs\u2019 use, and the other then-Angels employee Kay named, current Hall of Fame President Tim Mead deny that he know as well, but Kay\u2019s admission that he knew \u2014 he in fact claims he purchased drugs for and did drugs with Skaggs \u2014 would, if true, constitute team knowledge. Major League Baseball would, of course, want to make its own determination of whether or not Kay was being truthful when he told DEA agents what his lawyer says he told them.\n\nWhich raises the question of why, apart from a strong desire to get in criminal jeopardy for lying to DEA agents, Kay would admit through his lawyer that he lied to DEA agents. Still, the process is the process, so giving MLB a little time here is probably not harming anyone.\n\nAs for a $2 million fine? Well, it cuts a number of ways. On the one hand, that\u2019s a lot of money. On the other hand, (a) a man is dead; and (b) $2 million is what the Angels\u2019 DH or center fielder makes in about 11 minutes so how much would such a fine really sting?\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the third hand, my God, what else can be done here? No matter what happened in the case of Skaggs\u2019 death, this is not a situation anyone in either the Commissioner\u2019s Office nor the MLBPA truly contemplated when the JDA was drafted. We live in a world of horrors at times, and by their very nature, horrors involve that which it is not expected and for which there can be no adequate, pre-negotiated remedy. It\u2019s a bad story all around, no matter what happens.\n\nStill, it would be notable for Major League Baseball to fine any team under the \u201cteams must report players they suspect used banned substances\u201d rule. Because, based on what I have heard, knowledge of players who use banned substances \u2014 which includes marijuana, cocaine, opioids and other non-PED illegal drugs \u2014 and which have not been reported to MLB is both commonplace and considerable.\n\nBut that\u2019s a topic for another day. Perhaps tomorrow.", "description": "That may seem insufficient, but there are limits to what MLB can do here.", "authors": ["Craig Calcaterra"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/_Jc8DjGsYPLVLPeKG4diOg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/03NHaD9Ie3cHMQSARhNdHg--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/38beb14720ae8e53b21a2b50fd811f8f", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
