He has denied any wrongdoing with regards to the activities of the jailed prolific paedophile Barry Bennell, with whom he worked at Gresty Road.\n\nCrewe Alexandra announced Dario Gradi has retired - three years after the FA suspended him\n\nA separate independent inquiry, carried out on behalf of Chelsea, concluded that Gradi had information that may have stopped another serial abuser who worked as a scout at the London club during his time there.\n\nAccording to the QC-lead investigation, Gradi failed to report Eddie Heath in the 1970s when they were both at the club after receiving a complaint his co-worker \u2013 feared to have preyed on 25 victims, assaulted one boy in the showers.\n\nInstead, he visited the boy\u2019s parents and admitted he did not wish for the matter to go any further. Heath would go on to abuse a number of other victims.\n\nGradi was accused by Charles Geekie QC, who oversaw the inquiry of providing \u2018somewhat unlikely and unconvincing evidence\u2019.\n\nCrewe made no mention of Gradi's three-year suspension in the announcement he was retiring\n\nIn a gushing statement, Crewe hailed Milan-born Gradi for his contributions to the club.\n\nIt read: \u2018Crewe Alexandra would like to thank Dario for his outstanding 36 years of service to the football club and are pleased to know that he would be happy to continue to assist the club\u2019s senior coaching staff with his invaluable experience in the future.\u2019\n\nSources have told Sportsmail that should Gradi return to the game, his suspension will become active again.\n\nMeanwhile, Cheshire Police are continuing to investigate 65-year-old Bennell, a former Crewe youth coach.\n\nGradi has always denied any wrongdoing when he was spoken to about the child abuse cases\n\nHe was jailed for 30 years last February and branded the \u2018devil incarnate\u2019 by a judge for abusing 12 boys.\n\nHowever, a large number of other former players have come forward to say that they were abused by Bennell at both Crewe and Manchester City, another of his former clubs.\n\nDetective Inspector Sarah Oliver said: \u2018This is very much an ongoing investigation.\n\n'There are a number of outstanding complainants and our enquiries are continuing with a view to submitting a file to the Crown Prosecution Service for their consideration.\u2019", "description": "Dario Gradi has retired from his role as director of football at Crewe Alexandra - despite being suspended from footballing activity three years ago by the Football Association.", "authors": ["Mike Keegan For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/15/16963598-0-Gradi_s_reputation_is_irretrievable_now_The_fact_he_is_still_emp-a-15_1570458923407.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
