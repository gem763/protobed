Protesters often wear gas masks and other face coverings to protect themselves from tear gas fired by police, as well as from being identified.\n\n\"Almost all protesters who carry out vandalism and violence covered their face,\" Lam said when she announced the face mask ban. \"The purpose was to hide their identity and evade the law and they have become more and more daring.\"\n\nStill, some have questioned the validity of the anti-mask ban.\n\nPro-democracy lawmaker Claudia Mo took to social media on Sunday to rebut Lam's decision to ban masks, saying that \"the Chief Executive has no power to enact regulations in the manner she has.\"\n\nMo said it is \"in the immediate public interest for Legco to publicly scrutinize, vet and/or debate the matter.\" The Legislative Council, or the local assembly, is informally referred to as Legco.\n\nThe city has been roiled by increasingly violent protests for over four months. The turmoil was sparked by a now withdrawn bill that would have enabled suspects in Hong Kong to be extradited to mainland China for trial.\n\nHong Kong is not the first to introduce a ban on masks during mass protests. Earlier this year, France introduced a similar ban in response to the country's \"yellow vest\" movement that swept the European country starting last November.", "description": "Pro-democracy lawmaker, Claudia Mo, says \"the Chief Executive has no power to enact regulations in the manner she has.\"", "authors": ["Grace Shao"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106166870-1570408631759gettyimages-1173911134.jpeg?v=1570408674", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
