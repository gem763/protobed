Under coach Ernesto Valverde, Barca have seen 14 debutants from their famed academy, La Masia.\n\nBarcelona are in the midst of a renovation plan dubbed 'operation future' by the Spanish press\n\nThe side have balanced this with the signing of the established Antoine Griezmann and deploying the likes of Junior Firpo, 23, in defence, along with the capture of one of Europe's hottest young talents in Frenkie de Jong.\n\nThe former Ajax man, 22, has played in all eight of his new side's league games this season, also playing twice in the Champions League - scoring once and assisting once.\n\nLuis Suarez, Gerard Pique, Sergio Busquets and Ivan Rakitic have all passed the 30-year-old mark and Barca have this season already deployed the likes of Ansu Fati, 16, Carles Perez, 21, and Jean-Clair Todibo, 19, lowering the average of the side to 25.58.\n\nBarca also have several other young talents on their books that can come into Valverde's side in the mid-to-long-term, identified by Mundo Deportivo as the 'pearls' of the future, Sportsmail takes a closer look...\n\nANSU FATI, 16, FORWARD\n\nHe's not 17 until the end of the month, but the boy born in 2002 has enjoyed somewhat of a meteoric rise since the start of the season, when injuries to Messi, Suarez and Ousmane Dembele meant the U19s star was drafted into the first team.\n\nAnsu Fati is the youngest player ever in La Liga to register a goal and assist in the same game\n\nHe became the youngest player in La Liga history to register a goal and an assist in the same game in Barca's 5-2 demolition of Valencia last month. More impressively, he needed just seven minutes to do so.\n\nFati has scored two goals in five La Liga games now and also appeared in the Champions League, coming on for the last half-hour against Dortmund.\n\nThe Guinean-born striker is now a Spanish citizen, after completing his 10 years of residency, and is already being lined up for the national team.\n\nPEDRI, 16, ATTACKING MIDFIELDER\n\nPedro Gonzalez Lopez doesn't officially join Barcelona until July this year. The Canary Islander is still honing his skills at his home side Las Palmas but the Catalans are watching with a keen eye after paying nearly \u00a34.5million for the 16-year-old.\n\nLionel Messi has himself identified Pedro Gonzalez Lopez as his successor at the Camp Nou\n\nAccording to reports, five-time Ballon d'Or winner Messi has himself identified the youngster as his successor at the Nou Camp.\n\nThe attacking midfielder has scored three times in nine appearances in Spain's second tier, assisting once.\n\nRIQUI PUIG, 20, CENTRAL MIDFIELDER\n\nThe Barcelona youth product, who is a veteran in comparison to Fati and Pedri at 20 years old, is impressing for Barcelona B in the Spanish third tier.\n\nRiqui Puig is impressing for Barcelona B in the Spanish third tier, he has notched two goals\n\nThe central midfielder has notched two goals and assisted once in six appearances and won the Young Player of the Year award at Catalan Player of the Year awards in August.\n\nPuig gave a standout performance in a friendly for the first team against Arsenal in the same month and is also said to have attracted attention from their rivals, Spurs.\n\nILAIX MORIBA, 16, CENTRAL MIDFIELDER\n\nAnother 16-year-old, another Guinean-Spaniard.\n\nThe centre midfielder, who has been compared to World Cup winner Paul Pogba, would actually cost the same as the Frenchman did when he joined Manchester United in 2016 if he were to leave Barcelona.\n\nBarcelona have inserted a near \u00a390 million release clause into Ilaix Moriba's contract\n\nBarca think so highly of the youngster, who plays for their Under 19s, that they inserted a near \u00a390m release clause into his contract.\n\nHe has scored once and assisted once in seven games this season.\n\nJEAN-CLAIR TODIBO, 19, CENTRAL DEFENDER\n\nWith Clement Lenglet banned from playing against Sevilla after being handed a red card against Getafe and Samuel Umtiti still injured, 19-year-old Todibo partnered Gerard Pique in central defence on Sunday.\n\nJean-Clair Todibo partnered Gerard Piqu\u00e9, at just 19-years-old, in central defence on Sunday\n\nThe defender who signed from Tolouse had played three league matches for Barca before the 4-0 win, but all had been away games, except a non-official match in pre season.\n\nThis was the Frenchman's official Nou Camp debut but he was subbed after 73 minutes due to tiredness. He will have another chance at a top-flight game due to injuries and suspensions, at Eibar after the international break.\n\nRONALD ARAUJO, 20, CENTRAL DEFENDER\n\nThe man who replaced Todibo against Sevilla, but was then wrongly sent off.\n\nThe Uruguayan joined Barca B last year and came on for his debut in La Liga at the weekend, but played just 14 minutes before he was adjudged to have fouled ex-Manchester United man Javier Hernandez and given his marching orders.\n\nThe Uruguayan joined Barca B last year and came on for his debut against Sevilla on Sunday\n\nThe 20-year-old is tall, imposing and strong and joined Valverde's side's tour of Japan this summer, starting against Andres Iniesta's new team Vissel Kobe.\n\nHe is so highly thought of at the Nou Camp that he too has a \u00a390m release clause that will double should he become a regular feature in the first team.\n\nCARLES PEREZ, 21, WINGER\n\nPerez outshone the usual stars in Barca's 2-0 win in the aforementioned Kobe game in the summer, bagging both goals.\n\nCarles Perez has featured in Barca's La Liga campaign, scoring once and assisting twice\n\nThe winger was too much for the Japanese side and their Barcelona alumni, Iniesta, Sergi Samper and David Villa.\n\nA Catalan by birth, he joined Barcelona's youth set-up in 2012 from city rivals Espanyol and often draws comparisons to Arjen Robben.\n\nHe has featured in the La Liga campaign, scoring once and assisting twice in six games.\n\nHe netted nine goals in 26 appearances from the wing last season, finishing as Barca B's top scorer. He also has a \u00a390m release clause.\n\nALEX COLLADO, 20, ATTACKING MIDFIELDER/WINGER\n\nCollado has scored two goals in six games with Barcelona B this season, capped by a cheeky headline-grabbing backheel against Atletico Levante last month.\n\nAlex Collado has scored two goals in six Segunda Division B, Group Three games this season\n\nThe goal, which also included a ridiculous nutmeg, was Messi-esque and the La Masia product is another being touted as an heir to the Argentinian's throne.\n\nHe got his chance in the first team after Dembele was forced off after just six minutes in a 2-0 loss to Celta Vigo late last season and will be hoping for more opportunities this campaign.", "description": "The Catalan giants won La Liga last season by a stretch of 11 points but their side is now ageing, with even the\u00a0effervescent Lionel Messi coming into the twilight of his career at 32-years-old.", "authors": ["Leigh Mcmanus For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/11/19485922-0-image-a-4_1570616712437.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
