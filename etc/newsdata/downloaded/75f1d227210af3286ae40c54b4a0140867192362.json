The story has been compared to that of a \u201cRobin Hood\u201d tale in that the ladies would argue they were stealing from the rich and giving to the poor.\n\nJENNIFER LOPEZ'S 'HUSTLERS' INSPIRATION THREATENS LAWSUIT FOR USE OF HER STORY IN THE HIT FILM\n\n\u201cI hate it,\u201d Barbash told Fox News. \u201cI didn\u2019t want all of this media. I wasn\u2019t in the media for years since everything happened. I wanted to remain low-key. I\u2019m a business owner, I\u2019m married \u2014 I\u2019m not looking for fame.\u201d\n\nVanity Fair previously reported Barbash has made headlines for the first time since 2017 when she pleaded guilty to conspiracy, assault and grand larceny in exchange for five years\u2019 probation. She, along with other colleagues, allegedly drugged men and stole at least $200,000 from them.\n\nBarbash said she was long in the process of writing her book titled \u201cUnderscore\u201d and was gearing up to turn her life story into a series when the production company behind \u201cHustlers\u201d reached out to her about the film. However, Barbash said they made an offer she quickly refused \u2014 for good reason.\n\nJENNIFER LOPEZ RESPONDS TO EMILIA CLARKE'S EMMYS COMMENTS ABOUT HER \u2018HUSTLERS\u2019 CHARACTER\n\n\"I\u2019m a business owner, I\u2019m married \u2014 I\u2019m not looking for fame.\" \u2014 Ramona Barbash\n\n\u201cThe production company contacted my lawyer several times, but Jennifer doesn\u2019t work for free so why should I?\u201d she said. \u201cI denied their offer. I didn\u2019t want to partake in the movie because I wasn\u2019t going to give up my TV and film rights. I knew that I wanted to do this series and that I was going to do it. I wasn\u2019t going to give up my rights to use my story on TV or film. I had already known at that point that I was going to do a series. And besides that\u2026 I don\u2019t even want to embarrass them and say what they were trying to offer me\u2026 I guess that\u2019s Hollywood for you.\u201d\n\nBarbash also claimed that Lopez, 50, never reached out about portraying her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to badmouth Jennifer,\u201d said Barbash. \u201cI respect her as an actress. She looked beautiful in the film. But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a storyline. There wouldn\u2019t be a movie without Jennifer\u2026 Even though I didn\u2019t want to partake in the movie, she never took the time to shadow me, to study my mannerisms. And as an actress playing that type of movie, based on someone\u2019s life \u2014 that\u2019s just what you do as an actress. So I was very disappointed in that, especially since she knows my friend\u2019s father extremely well.\u201d\n\nJENNIFER LOPEZ SLAMMED GWYNETH PALTROW, MADONNA IN RESURFACED 1998 INTERVIEW\n\nThere was also one scene in \u201cHustlers\u201d that rubbed Barbash the wrong way \u2014 so much so that she walked out of the theater.\n\n\u201c[The scene] where they\u2019re cooking drugs with the child in the house \u2014 that never happened,\u201d said Barbash. \u201cI felt like the movie defamed my character and defamed me as a mother. I walked out of the movie theater because I was very upset.\u201d\n\nA rep for Lopez did not return to Fox News\u2019 request for comment. But according to Barbash, the damage is already done.\n\n'HUSTLERS' STAR JENNIFER LOPEZ GETS SLAMMED BY ALLEGED RINGLEADER SAMANTHA BARBASH: \u2018JLO BETRAYED ME\u2019\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really have a comment,\u201d said Barbash on what she would tell Lopez if the star were to call her today. \u201cI don\u2019t have too many nice things to say. To be honest, they\u2019re making millions off of something that I and my son suffered for. And I\u2019m very remorseful. I took a guilty plea. But there are two sides to every story. And the movie didn\u2019t really portray what went down with the girls and I\u2019m very disappointed. They would have had such a better storyline if they really just focused on the truth.\u201d\n\n\"I felt like the movie defamed my character and defamed me as a mother. I walked out of the movie theater because I was very upset.\" \u2014 Ramona Barbash\n\n\u201cI thought Cardi B should have played me from the beginning,\u201d continued Barbash. \u201cShe was in the strip club business so she knows, she gets it\u2026 She played a good 10 minutes. She would have portrayed me better because she lived that life\u2026 Again, I\u2019m not going against Jennifer\u2019s acting skills because she acted great in the film. She looked beautiful, but it\u2019s not reality. I understand the story had to be fabricated for Hollywood, but it was very fabricated to the point where I just walked out of the movie.\u201d\n\nVariety reported Barbash\u2019s attorney Bruno Gioffre sent STX, the production company behind \u201cHustlers,\u201d a letter earlier this month demanding it works out a deal to compensate his client within 10 days or face a lawsuit. In response, the outlet reported STX defended its rights to make movies about actual events.\n\n'HUSTLERS' STAR JENNIFER LOPEZ'S STRIPPER MOVES CAN'T BEAT 'IT' AT BOX OFFICE\n\n\u201cWe will defend our right to tell factually based stories based on the public record and look forward to resolving this matter before a judge,\u201d said an STX spokesperson.\n\nSTX did not respond to Fox News\u2019 request for comment. Barbash wouldn\u2019t further elaborate on the matter.\n\nBut one thing Barbash did approve in \u201cHustlers\u201d was Lopez\u2019s pole dancing.\n\n\u201cThat was the whole film,\u201d Barbash chuckled. \u201cAs soon as she came out in that outfit, she looked gorgeous. She did amazing on the pole. I don\u2019t even know how to do stuff like that. So I commend her.\u201d\n\nJENNIFER LOPEZ MOVIE \u2018HUSTLERS\u2019 MAY TAKE IN $32M ON OPENING WEEKEND: REPORTS\n\nStill, Barbash stressed the strip club scene \u201cHustlers\u201d depicted was completely different from the world she knew.\n\n\u201cThe ones I worked at, and I\u2019m going back years and years, they didn\u2019t even have a stripper pole,\u201d she explained. \u201cYou had to wear long gowns. You had to cover up your tattoos\u2026 When I went to the Hustler club, there was a pole there, but it wasn\u2019t like the clubs of today, the clubs Cardi B knew where the girls did pole tricks. And we weren\u2019t dancing for dollars \u2014 we were dancing for thousands\u2026 It was a totally different time.\u201d\n\nBarbash said that despite the film\u2019s success, she\u2019s still going to move forward with her plans to release a series based on her life. And she insisted her take will depict the truth.\n\nTOM HANKS FANBOYS OVER JENNIFER LOPEZ AND MEETING THE 'HUSTLERS' CAST\n\n\u201cNobody really knows why we pursue a job like this,\u201d said Barbash. \u201cI was a single mom. I had no choice but to do what I had to do to survive. In my series, it\u2019s going to be based on my life story. It\u2019s not only going to show the glamorization. It will show the girls making lots of money, but it\u2019s also going to show all the downfalls of the clubs and how these girls are taken advantage of. Some girls get caught up on drugs because of the money they\u2019re making.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou cannot let the money make you,\u201d continued Barbash. \u201cYou can\u2019t get caught up with the wrong people. You can\u2019t let the clubs rule you because that\u2019s what happens. That\u2019s where it all fell apart for me.\u201d\n\nFox News' Tyler McCarthy contributed to this report.", "description": "The real-life inspiration for Jennifer Lopez\u2019s character Ramona in \u201cHustlers\u201d insisted she despises the newfound attention she\u2019s receiving after the hit film made over $33 million in its opening weekend.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nolasco", "Ramona Barbash"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/06/694940094001_6084066475001_6084069148001-vs.jpg"}
