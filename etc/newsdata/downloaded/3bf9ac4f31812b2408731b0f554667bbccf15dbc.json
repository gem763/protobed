I found change totally exhilarating and, I\u2019ve got to say, the color suited me extremely well. Having said that, I went back to my natural color eight months ago, but my texture and moisture levels have not quite yet recovered. Two things have helped move the process along, though: Getting monthly trims, and keeping a bevy of products that deeply nourish, moisturize, and condition my hair in my shower caddy. As my colorist Emaly Braum says: \u201cHalf the battle is at home.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve written before about my obsession with just about everything Christophe Robin: His Prickly Pear Recovery and Baby Blonde Mask are two of the best hair-care products I\u2019ve ever used, end of story. After applying either of these masks, my hair is smoother, silkier, intensely moisturized, and air dries like a dream. But it is a painful kind of love: Christophe Robin hair care is very, extremely, gut-wrenchingly expensive. Because of this, I constantly keep my eyes peeled for masks that are cheaper, but equally \u2014 or almost equally, who are we kidding here \u2014 effective.\n\nOver the past few months, I noticed that Briogeo\u2019s Don\u2019t Despair Repair Mask was mentioned again and again on various Into The Gloss Top Shelf articles, had become a best-seller on Sephora\u2019s website, and was often praised in our very own Facebook community \u201cThe Beauty of it All.\u201d It felt like the universe was telling me to try it out, so I listened.\n\nAnd I\u2019m glad I did, because I fell in love! Over time: Every review I read (and the instructions on the box, for that matter) made it clear that this was a product you had to use multiple times before seeing results, which I found extremely true. I wasn\u2019t mesmerized after the first time I used it (it wasn\u2019t bad, just not game-changing), but after about four uses, I noticed my hair felt smoother and less tangled, and was air drying beautifully, instead of turning from wet into a scary broom.\n\nI was especially delighted because this mask, which is formulated with rosehip and argan oils, algae, and biotin, replicates the thing I love most about the Christophe Robin masks \u2014 the ability to moisturize my sad hair without creating any heaviness (which many ultra-moisturizing masks, like Oribe\u2019s Moisture Mask and Gisou\u2019s Honey Mask, do). It has not weighed my bob down in the least, and is a lot more moisturizing than any of the other non\u2013Christophe Robin masks I\u2019ve tried in the past, like Ouai\u2019s Hair Mask.\n\nI\u2019ve been using the Briogeo mask twice a week for about a month now; after shampooing, I run about a teaspoon amount (enough for anyone with a bob) through my hair and let it sit for ten minutes. And my hair has never been so low maintenance \u2014 texture sprays, oils, and leave-in conditioners have become basically superfluous. While I know the mask\u2019s $36 price is not cheap, it is a whole lot cheaper than the $71 price tag of the Christophe Robin mask, and it truly is very nearly as good as that more expensive product. So if you\u2019re a bleach victim, or just have perennially, annoyingly dry hair, consider making it your new best friend.\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
