Ford and Toyota didn't.\n\nOnly 3% of sales are hybrids. Why bother?\n\nWith that hard to fault logic, GM and Volkswagen Pull the Plug on Hybrid Vehicles.\n\n\u201cIf I had a dollar more to invest, would I spend it on a hybrid? Or would I spend it on the answer that we all know is going to happen, and get there faster and better than anybody else?\u201d GM President Mark Reuss said in an interview. GM\u2019s view contrasts with other auto-making giants, including Toyota Motor Corp. and Ford Motor Co. which are working on full electrics but also expanding their U.S. hybrid offerings. The differing strategies show a division within the auto industry over what is the best path to full electrification, as manufacturers pivot from their more than century-old reliance on gas-powered vehicles. Last week, Continental AG, one of the world\u2019s biggest car-parts makers, said it would cut investment in conventional engine parts because of a faster-than-expected fall in demand\u2014yet another sign the industry is accelerating the shift to electric vehicles. Hybrids, which were popularized by Toyota\u2019s Prius last decade as a social statement, accounted for about 3% of U.S. sales in 2018, according to research firm LMC Automotive.\n\nAggressively Chasing the 3% \"Social Statement\" Crowd\n\nDavid Filipe, Ford\u2019s head of powertrain engineering. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be aggressively chasing this space of hybrids.\u201d\n\nHow can aggressively chasing 3% of the market make any sense?\n\nHybrids never made any sense to begin with.\n\nThey appealed to yuppies who wanted to make it appear they were doing something for the environment without really doing a damn thing.\n\nCar Engine Technology\n\nElectric vehicles account for only 1% of the market,even less than hybrids, but eventually the market will be electric.\n\n\u201cOur strong preference is to go all-in where the market is heading, as opposed to hybrids as a way to hedge our bets,\u201d said Scott Keogh, VW\u2019s U.S. chief.\n\nIn contrast, Bob Carter, Toyota\u2019s sales chief for North America, said that with U.S. electric-vehicle sales expected to lag behind Europe and China, the company needs a nearer-term remedy. \u201cThat\u2019s why we feel so confident in hybrids,\u201d Mr. Carter said.\n\nConfident of the need to compete for 3%?! For the near term? Why bother?\n\nThree Electric Issues\n\nTechnology: Batteries technology needs more miles per charge and that will happen.\n\nCost: The battery cost needs to come down and it will.\n\nConvenience: There need to be more charging stations and that will happen too.\n\nA hybrid system can add roughly $2,000 to a vehicle\u2019s cost, while a fully electric version costs an additional $6,000 to $10,000, said Alan Baum, an independent Detroit-area auto analyst.\n\nThe Big Bet\n\nToyota and Ford bet on Hybrids. GM and Volkswagen bet on Electric.\n\nFord should let Toyota have the whole market.\n\nOnce price, performance, convenience are good enough, mass adoption of electric will take off.\n\nTime Frame?\n\nI don't know, but I am sure it will happen.\n\nMeanwhile, judging from 3% market penetration, the hybrid hedge offers too little improvement at too great a cost to bother with. That consumer choice seems rational to me.", "description": "GM and Volkswagen pulled the plug on hybrid cars.
