In it, she reveals that she doesn\u2019t really need anyone to water her because, like the role model she is, she remembers to water herself every morning:\n\nI\u2019m real bizarre, but I believe in water first thing. Water is really important for face and hair. I go to the bathroom and, believe or not, hit myself with some Evian spray to the face.\n\nI believe it! Many a glowy famous person cites magical, life-transforming water as their go-to beauty secret, and the best part is, it works in almost any state or form: almost hot, room temperature in a reusable bottle, cold and carbonated, and completely frozen. Now we can add the Lizzo method to the list.\n\nLizzo also belts \u201cI moisturize it daily\u201d in the aforementioned bop, and we now know that said moisturizing comes in form of a shelfful of Sunday Riley. \u201cI have the whole Sunday Riley system now. I don\u2019t mix systems. I would mix if I felt like it, but if it works for me, I don\u2019t mess with it.\u201d A self-described \u201coily bitch,\u201d Lizzo is particularly fond of Sunday Riley\u2019s vitamin C and turmeric-packed C.E.O. Glow Oil (\u201cit\u2019s so sick\u201d).\n\nWhile the new Urban Decay ambassador is \u201creally into my skin looking naked\u201d these days, she did sprinkle in some helpful makeup tips here and there, including the importance of taking the time to build a lash with mascara if lash extensions aren\u2019t it, and dipping one\u2019s face \u201cin a tub of Urban Decay All Nighter makeup setting spray\u201d and putting a dryer to it for pro-level staying power.\n\nIf you buy something through our links, New York may earn an affiliate commission.", "description": "In a new interview with The New York Times, Lizzo reveals that she waters herself first thing in the morning with a spritz of Evian spray and follows up with a lot of Sunday Riley products.", "authors": ["Erica Smith"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/04/4-lizzo-bg.w1200.h630.jpg"}
