I have been at the top since 2014, before I joined Nike academy, they can go check my background. What do they think, that the world anti-doping doesn't test me?\"\n\nA defiant Hassan said she was inspired to join the NOP by watching Britain's world and Olympic champion Mo Farah, who was also coached by Salazar.\n\n\"He always does (did) well in championships, I believe in him,\" the 26-year-old said, adding that she had \"never seen anything\" at the NOP.\n\n\"Since I joined, I have seen nothing, they have never offered anything to me,\" she said. \"I believe in clean sport, the group is clean, they work very hard, they have really amazing staff, especially the physio. They have good people.\"\n\nAsked about her tactics for the 1,500 metres final, which she led from the end of the first lap, she said: \"I did not discuss a strategy as I had no one to discuss it with.\" (Writing by Brian Homewood, editing by Ed Osmond)", "description": "By Gene CherryDOHA, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Sifan Hassan repeated that she was a clean athlete after winning the world 1,500 metres title on Saturday, days after...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
