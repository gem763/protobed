Pollard converted to make it 17-3 at half-time.\n\nIncredibly, Italy lost a third prop at the start of the second period, loosehead Andrea Lovotti sent off for a needless tip-tackle after the whistle on Vermeulen.\n\nIt was the third red card of the World Cup after American John Quill and Uruguay's Facundo Gattas were both dismissed for high tackles.\n\nPollard hit a second penalty as Italy struggled to cope with the Springboks' all-encompassing defensive line speed and power runners in midfield.\n\nThe floodgates opened after centre Damian de Allende sparked a slick offloading attack before Pollard crosskicked on the recycle, Kolbe picking up on the second bounce to cross for his brace.\n\nThe flyhalf sliced that conversion, but made no mistake after centre Lukhanyo Am grabbed an opportunistic intercept try, Italy's Gloucester flank Jake Polledri forcing an inside pass with no one home.\n\nLeft winger Makazole Mapimpi then gathered a chip to cross for a deserved try after a great individual game, Pollard converting.\n\nWith Italy under the cosh Kolbe defied his size to bundle Minozzi touchwards with such force the Italy fullback attempted to keep the ball alive.\n\nBok replacement RG Snyman was on hand to intercept for the simplest of tries before Malcolm Marx popped over for the final word from an line-out maul.\n\nSouth Africa will now look forward to putting Canada to the sword to line up an October 20 quarter-final game in Tokyo against the winner of Pool A, where things are yet to be decided between Ireland, Scotland, Japan and Samoa.\n\nScorers:\n\nSouth Africa\n\nTries: Cheslin Kolbe (2), Makazole Mapimpi, Bongi Mbonambi, Lukhanyo Am, RG Snyman, Malcolm Marx\n\n\n\nConversions: Handre Pollard (4)\n\n\n\nPenalties: Pollard (2)\n\n\n\nItaly\n\nPenalty: Tommaso Allan\n\nTeams:", "description": "The Springboks have all-but secured their progression to the quarter-final stage of the 2019 Rugby World Cup with a comfortable victory over Italy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9437/c4c448749b1646f7a6f27813216707b4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
