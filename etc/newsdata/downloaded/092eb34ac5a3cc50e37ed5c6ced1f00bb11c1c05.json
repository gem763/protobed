asked for selfies at gynaecologist \"with legs in stirrups\"", "language": "en", "text": "The video will start in 8 Cancel\n\nGet the biggest Strictly Come Dancing stories by email Subscribe Thank you

set of eyelashes.\n\nAnd, even though when we meet her she\u2019s low-key in black leggings, a jumper and a fresh face, she still has the lashes and a little diamond stuck to her tooth.\n\nAnd reapplies lashings of lip gloss before anyone takes any pictures.\n\nShe\u2019s even drinking water from a pink rhinestone goblet.\n\nFitting, then, that a woman who adores all things adorned is part of the glitziest show in history, Strictly Come Dancing .\n\nWe meet her at the dance studios where she\u2019s about to be put through her paces by pro partner Giovanni Pernice (who wheels into the chat on a scooter, must save that leg power, eh?), and after wowing the judges week after week, the pair are determined to take that glitter ball.\n\nShe\u2019s known for her feisty attitude, and we\u2019re worried she\u2019ll eat us alive.\n\nBut she\u2019s sweet, funny, calls everyone \u2018honey\u2019 or \u2018girl\u2019, and is an official mother of the LGBTQ community, hosting Drag Race for eight years alongside best pal Ru Paul.\n\nThe show is in its first series in the UK and has become an instant hit, with Ms Visage\u2019s infectious laugh and booming personality bigger than some of the wigs.\n\nLiving in LA with husband of 22 years David and daughters Lola and Lillie, she\u2019s an Anglophile desperate to ship them over and start a new life in London.\n\nShe talks dancing, drag and acting tough\u2026\n\nYou look like you\u2019re loving every second of Strictly\u2026\n\nI so am, but it\u2019s the hardest thing I have ever done.\n\nAnd I gave birth twice.\n\nBut I\u2019m not 20 any more and I\u2019ve never done this before ever.\n\nI\u2019m no dancer.\n\nI was a club girl Vogue-ing in my 20s, and anyone who challenges that as proper dancing can go and have a look at me on YouTube.\n\nDo you get nervous?\n\nI\u2019m not bricking it, but I\u2019m not cool as a cucumber either.\n\nGio works so hard to make me look the best I can look.\n\nHe could look 20 times better, but he dumbs himself down to be on my level.\n\nI know I have a family, but I calm any nerves to make sure I make him proud.\n\n(Image: Adrian_Brooks 07768696197)\n\nThe glamorous side must be a plus for you\u2026\n\nThat\u2019s the only part that\u2019s familiar to me.\n\nSitting down and having a sh*t-tonne of glitter and sequins thrown at my face.\n\nAn everyday occurrence in my life.\n\nWhat\u2019s it like hanging out with the rest of the gang?\n\nOh, there\u2019s zero socialising, honey.\n\nI spend every day rehearsing, and then I\u2019m so exhausted I just lie in the bath and catch up with Supermarket Sweep.\n\nMy husband said I don\u2019t speak to him any more, so I spoke to him on FaceTime for the first time in weeks yesterday.\n\nI\u2019ve just been too tired.\n\nAnd I had a rare day off recently, so I went to Westfield in London to buy some new outfits.\n\nI need clothes for all these TV appearances, must look my best.\n\nYou don\u2019t have anyone to help you with that?\n\nNo, I do it all myself.\n\nAnd I do my own make-up, as I\u2019m brilliant at it.\n\nHair, no, I\u2019m useless.\n\nYou\u2019ll know I\u2019ve done my own hair if it\u2019s in a top knot.\n\nAnd you have Drag Race UK to glam up for now too\u2026\n\nI know, how brilliant!\n\nI\u2019m so pleased that all the folk who thought a UK version would ruin it have been shut down and have shut up.\n\nThe girls are superstars.\n\nRu and I were sat there in awe.\n\nDo you both get the British humour and references on the show?\n\nI fully get it, and he\u2019s been my best friend for 30 years so it\u2019s rubbed off.\n\nBut he loves Australia, which has a very British sense of humour, and I\u2019m an Anglophile.\n\nI know all the references more or less.\n\nI know Kim Woodburn, that lady who cleans on the telly, I\u2019m pretty clued up.\n\nI just didn\u2019t know who Tracy Beaker was, sue me.\n\nIs it nice having best pal Ru in the UK with you?\n\nIt\u2019s a joy, because he\u2019s falling in love with the place too.\n\nI took him for his first Nando\u2019s the other day.\n\nHe was in heaven.\n\nI laid out all the sauces so he had a xylophone of Peri sauces and he sampled every spice level.\n\nHe tried halloumi for the first time.\n\nIt was a real moment.\n\n(Image: BBC/Ray Burmiston)\n\nWhat\u2019s your favourite thing about the UK?\n\nEverything.\n\nMainly the people and the dry, sarcastic wit.\n\nBenidorm is my favourite ever show, it is hysterical.\n\nGet me to that salon.\n\nI love a northern accent and do a good Huddersfield accent myself.\n\nI\u2019ve never had a day here where I felt I didn\u2019t belong.\n\nI never belonged in LA, I\u2019m too edgy for that place.\n\nI\u2019m a ball-busting New York broad and it feels like home here.\n\nI\u2019ll 100% move my family over when my kids are ready.\n\nI was definitely a gay British man in a past life.\n\nWhat confuses you about us?\n\nYou\u2019re all so conservative in front of each other!\n\nWhy is it so British to not say how you really feel?\n\nBecause that isn\u2019t who you are \u2013 when I get you behind closed doors I hear it.\n\nSo why not say it at the time? Say it!\n\nAnd the saying bye 20 times on the phone thing?\n\nIt\u2019s weird but adorable.\n\nI say bye once and the phone is hung up, trust me, honey, much more effective.\n\n(Image: BBC/World of Wonder/Guy Levy)\n\nYou\u2019re known to be quite feisty, how do the public take to you?\n\nOh, they\u2019re terrified of me.\n\nI get the odd person who is rude if they\u2019re drunk, but mostly people are scared to death.\n\nBut you\u2019re not scary\u2026\n\nI\u2019m sweet, right?\n\nIt\u2019s just my character on Drag Race who isn\u2019t as much.\n\nPeople say I\u2019m harsh, but I wish when I was younger I\u2019d had someone to critique me to have helped me.\n\nIt\u2019s a gift to be critiqued and I give the advice I do to make their careers last longer.\n\nIn this industry, you win a show, you\u2019re good for a year and then you\u2019re done.\n\nI\u2019m trying to stretch their 15 minutes to 15 hours.\n\nPeople approach me and ask me to tell them how horrible they look.\n\nEw, as if I\u2019d do that!\n\nAre you a softie deep down?\n\nI\u2019m stoic.\n\nThe only thing that makes me cry is talking about certain things to do with my kids.\n\nI\u2019m a mother figure to lots of kids who have issues, who have not been loved the way they should have been because of their sexual orientation.\n\nThose stories touch me, but it touches me even more when I have a parent come up to me who thanks me for what I\u2019ve publicly spoken about \u2013 helping them to understand their gay, trans, or bi child.\n\nNobody asks to be born and nobody asks to be different, so all you have to do is love unconditionally.\n\nEven if you don\u2019t approve, you have to accept.\n\nWhat kind of mother are you?\n\nVery open.\n\nI have a great relationship with my daughters, to the point they tell me everything and my friends are like, \u2018Oh my God, I\u2019d never tell my mother that!\u2019\n\nAnd I wouldn\u2019t either.\n\nBut I\u2019m a mum before a friend, and I\u2019m tough.\n\nI don\u2019t let them get away with things.\n\nI don\u2019t care about being their friend.\n\nMum first and if they want to be friends after that, sure.\n\nHow do you deal with negativity, being in the public eye?\n\nI don\u2019t even block, I mute people.\n\nThen they carry on and have no idea I can\u2019t see it.\n\nI\u2019ve had people telling me to kill myself online, and sometimes it\u2019s 13- or 14-year-old kids saying it.\n\nSo if you\u2019re vile you get muted.\n\nI don\u2019t care what you say about me personally because, trust me guys, I\u2019ve heard it all.\n\nBut if it\u2019s about my kids or my community \u2013 no.\n\nThey\u2019re innocent, leave them out of it.\n\n(Image: BACKGRID)\n\nWhat might surprise us about you?\n\nI don\u2019t drink.\n\nAnd people think I\u2019m a party girl.\n\nI\u2019ve been drunk three times in my life, the last time I was 21.\n\nI have never taken drugs either.\n\nIt\u2019s a control thing.\n\nI\u2019m pretty quiet and I like to be at home and relax.\n\nI just pretend to be a tough girl.\n\nAre you dressed up 24/7?\n\nWell, there\u2019s always a lip gloss or something to keep the fabulousness, I can\u2019t totally just let it go!\n\nI think people on Strictly expected me to be out of control, though, but I\u2019m low-maintenance.\n\nIt\u2019s just water in my dressing room.\n\nMost glitzy moment of your life?\n\nI worshipped [American actress] Patti LuPone when I was little.\n\nI got to go to a rehearsal and she sang for me and I was crying like an idiot.\n\nWhen I was a child she made me realise when I was on stage nobody could call me fat or ugly.\n\nAnd nobody could tell me I couldn\u2019t sing, because I could.\n\nShe inspired my life.\n\nMadonna is my idol too, but I don\u2019t want to meet her.\n\nShe\u2019s total high risk.\n\nPeople who have met her have said don\u2019t do it.\n\nSo no way am I doing it.\n\n(Image: NJ)\n\nIf it all went away tomorrow, what would change?\n\nI\u2019d still be asked for selfies in gynaecological visits with my legs in stirrups, I\u2019m sure.\n\nAnd I\u2019d still say yes to them, when my legs are closed.\n\nBut I\u2019d hope I could still live this \u2018pinch me\u2019 lifestyle.\n\nStill have people want to come and hug me.\n\nStill use my voice to try to stop bullying.\n\nI am absolutely living my dream and I hope it never ends.\n\n- Michelle Visage won the Specs Star Style award at Specsavers\u2019 2019 Spectacle Wearer Of The Year Awards in support of Kidscape.
