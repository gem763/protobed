It dropped to 2.04 after, the researchers found.\n\n\"What that translates to is about a 69% reduction in the rate of concussion,\" said Douglas Wiebe, first author of the research letter and a professor of biostatistics and epidemiology at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine\n\nIn comparison, the researchers found that for other play types, the average annual concussion rate was 2.56 before the rule change and 1.18 after, which was not a significant difference.\n\n\"To see that rate of concussion went down that much, very strongly in kickoff returns relative to other types of plays over the same period, we think it's an example of a public health intervention that was part of a large collaboration between injury epidemiologists and coaches and athletic trainers,\" Wiebe said.\n\nThe kickoff return play poses a risk of concussion -- a type of traumatic brain injury caused by a blow to the head -- because it involves players running at speed toward each other over a long distance, the researchers noted.\n\nIn 2015, kickoffs accounted for 6% of all plays but 21% of concussions in the Ivy League conference, the researchers said, referencing data published in the journal Injury Prevention\n\nThe next year, the rule change called for moving the kickoff line from the 35-yard line to the 40 and the touchback line from the 25-yard line to the 20.\n\nSmall change tied to significant reduction\n\nFor the study, researchers analyzed data from the Ivy League's concussion surveillance system, identifying concussions occurring during in-conference regular season games from 2013 through 2017.\n\nThe Ivy League itself includes eight schools: Princeton, Dartmouth, Yale, Columbia, Pennsylvania, Harvard, Brown and Cornell.\n\nThe researchers evaluated each concussion by what type of play caused it and when it occurred, whether before or after the 2016 rule change.\n\nJUST WATCHED Researchers: 96% of ex-NFL players had brain disease Replay More Videos ...

Yet an expert warns that it may be too soon to attribute the decline in concussions to one rule.", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150918153642-nfl-brain-study-concussion-cte-brain-disease-gupta-sot-nr-00014630-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2018-10-02"}
