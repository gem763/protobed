Trump being blamed for Kaepernick\u2019s lack of a job", "language": "en", "text": "Somehow I don\u2019t think the Intelligence Committee will have time to get around to investigating this one, what with all of the Ukraine stuff going on, but you never know.\n\nDonald Trump gets blamed for all manner of things by the mainstream media (and their friends in the Democratic Party). Global warming, children in cages and the general decline and fall of civilization are all things he\u2019s typically held responsible for. But this weekend a new \u201cscandal\u201d was tossed onto the pile. The President is apparently the reason that Colin Kaepernick doesn\u2019t have a job as a starting quarterback in the NFL this year. This showed up last night at Yahoo News.\n\nESPN analyst Stephen A. Smith explained on Hot 97\u2019s Ebro in the Morning that team owners could potentially lose billions of dollars in revenue if they went against Trump, who has been vocal in his hatred of Kaepernick. The NFL is currently trying to get gambling legalized, and that requires the thumbs up from the President and Congress. \u201cWell, what was going on on Capitol Hill is that the owners, the NFL owners were trying to get involved with that, where they were trying to get a percentage of the bets and all of this other stuff that was going on. So what happens is, we\u2019re talking billions. Well, guess what? In order for that to happen, you need Congress to sign off on it and you need the President to sign off on it. What you don\u2019t need is the President turning his attention towards you and going against you just because he doesn\u2019t like you.\u201d\n\nIn case you\u2019re wondering where this latest flap originated, it all appears to have stemmed from one article at an outlet called Pop Culture. And what was their source for this exclusive, breaking news story? A radio interview with an ESPN sports analyst.\n\nStephen A. Smith is saying that the President holds a lot of influence with the NFL franchise owners. (Possibly true in some cases, but there\u2019s not a lot of intersection there.) From that starting point, he launches into a story about how the NFL wants to see sports gambling further legalized so the league can pick up a big cut of that action. This is also not really in doubt. They\u2019ve been pushing the idea for a while now.\n\nFrom there, Smith goes on to claim that Trump probably let the owners know if any of them hired Kaepernick he\u2019d be \u201cangry\u201d with them. And if the President is angry, he might not agree to sign off on any deal that would let the legalized gambling move forward.\n\nWhat evidence does the ESPN analyst offer to show that this actually happened? None. Zero. Zilch. Nada. It\u2019s just a \u201cfeeling\u201d that he has. The claim is described as something that Smith \u201cbelieves.\u201d The social media uproar that followed all quoted him as \u201csuggesting\u201d or \u201chinting\u201d that this happened.\n\nThis is extraordinarily obvious. Every NFL owner knows that if they allow Kap on their team they are going to be excoriated by Trump. \"Analyst Hints President Trump Impacted Colin Kaepernick\u2019s NFL Return\"https://t.co/m6SykWip27 via @heavysan \u2014 Mike Farquad (@FarquadMike) September 29, 2019\n\nAnd yet not one shred of evidence has been offered. But hey, who needs evidence of anything in 2019?\n\nThere is no movement on further gambling legislation that would benefit the NFL currently in danger of being sent to the President\u2019s desk. There\u2019s not much indication that he even pays any attention to football except where the players do things that intersect with cultural politics and then he rants about it for a while on Twitter. Trump picks on Kaepernick because he\u2019s become something of a cultural touchstone on the right.\n\nMeanwhile, Kaepernick finished his last pro season with a rather mediocre record and there were a lot of seasoned, experienced quarterbacks available out there, along with some highly anticipated rookies. Was he good enough to land a position somewhere? Probably. But as I\u2019ve stated here countless times, there is an unofficial but very real rule in the NFL. The amount of crap your team is willing to put up with regarding your off-field antics is directly proportional to how likely they believe you are to get them to the Super Bowl. (That\u2019s why Antonio Brown still had a job at the beginning of the season. The guy creates endless horrible headlines but he\u2019s a yardage machine.) Kaepernick came out on the losing end of that calculation and that\u2019s why he\u2019s watching the season from home.", "description": "But can we blame him for the Jets' crappy season too?", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Kaepernick.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
