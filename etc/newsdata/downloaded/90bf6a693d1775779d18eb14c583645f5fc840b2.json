Thank you @HillaryClinton. You, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, have finally come out from behind the curtain. From the day I announced my candidacy, there has been a concerted campaign to destroy my reputation. We wondered who was behind it and why. Now we know \u2014 it was always you, through your proxies and powerful allies in the corporate media and war machine, afraid of the threat I pose. It\u2019s now clear that this primary is between you and me. Don\u2019t cowardly hide behind your proxies. Join the race directly.\"\n\nThe big picture: Gabbard's foreign policy stances significantly differ from other top Democratic candidates, especially on Syria. She has controversially defended Syrian dictator, Bashar al-Assad, and met with him on a secret trip to Syria in 2017.\n\nThe New York Times reported that alt-right internet stars, white nationalists and Russians have praised her campaign.\n\nCNN analyst Bakari Sellers called Gabbard a \"puppet for the Russian government.\" He said, \"That's not just an allegation. I firmly believe that Tulsi Gabbard stands on that stage and is the antithesis to what the other 11 individuals stand for \u2014 specially when it comes to issues such as foreign policy.\"\n\nAt this week's Democratic debate, Gabbard condemned news outlets like the the Times and CNN, saying it was \"completely despicable\" to call her an asset to Russia.\n\nWhat else Clinton said: She told Plouffe that Jill Stein, the Green Party nominee for president in 2012 and 2016, is a \"Russian asset \u2014 I mean, totally.\"\n\nAnd she said that President Trump is Russian President \"Vladimir Putin's dream,\" implying that she believes that Russia has some sort of leverage on the president. \"I don't know what Putin has on him \u2014 whether it's both personal and financial. I assume it is.\"\n\nGo deeper: Tulsi Gabbard on the issues, in under 500 words", "description": "Gabbard tweeted at Clinton later, calling her the \"queen of warmongers.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/m5PTIaSeBFHho4Nm3_bL6Y9lM-E=/0x166:5116x3044/1920x1080/2019/10/18/1571409631304.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
