There was no onshore trading as Monday is the\n\nlast day of China's long holiday break for its national day.\n\nOther trade-exposed currencies such as the Australian dollar\n\nAUD=D3 and the Korean won also fell on doubts that much\n\nwill be achieved at the trade negotiations.\n\nDeputy-level meetings will be held on Monday and Tuesday,\n\nwith top-level talks scheduled for Thursday and Friday, when\n\nChinese Vice Premier Liu He meets U.S. Trade Representative\n\nRobert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in\n\nWashington.\n\nGlobal markets have been on a roller coaster ride this year\n\nas hopes for a deal have waxed and waned, while weak economic\n\ndata in Europe, the United States and China have added to\n\nevidence that the tensions are dragging on global trade and\n\ngrowth.\n\nThe jitters knocked the dollar from a two-year high last\n\nweek, and it remained subdued on Monday. Against a basket of\n\nmajor currencies it was steady at 98.818 - almost a\n\npercentage point below its week-ago peak.\n\nSignals from both sides in the lead-up to the trade talks\n\nhave been mixed.\n\nTrump last month delayed hiking levies on $250 billion worth\n\nof Chinese imports from Oct. 1 to Oct. 15, \"as a gesture of good\n\nwill,\" while China has again begun purchasing U.S agricultural\n\ngoods.\n\nBut administration sources late in September also said the\n\nU.S. was considering imposing restrictions on investing in\n\nChinese companies.\n\n\"The odds remain low for a trade deal,\" analysts at DBS Bank\n\nin Singapore said in an emailed note.\n\n\"Washington wants to get the whole deal done but Beijing is\n\nunwilling to do so without the U.S. rolling back tariffs.\"\n\nAs the dollar has lost momentum, the euro stood at $1.0979\n\n, up 0.03% in Asia, recovering little by little after\n\nhaving hit a near 2-1/2-year low of $1.0879 last Tuesday.\n\nSterling was little changed at $1.2325 GBP=D4 , with\n\nuncertainties over Brexit keeping many investors on the\n\nsideline.\n\nWith only a few weeks until UK's scheduled exit from the\n\nEuropean Union on Oct. 31, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson\n\nis seeking significant changes to how the contentious issue of\n\nthe Irish border is dealt with. The European Union and Ireland said last week that his\n\nproposals were unlikely to yield a deal.", "description": "FOREX-Yen creeps higher amid caution over Sino-U.S. trade talks", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/usd_chf_800x533_L_1411988236.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
