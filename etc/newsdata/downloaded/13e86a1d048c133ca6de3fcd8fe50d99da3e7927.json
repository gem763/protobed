In the place of factories, Samsung will rely on local original device makers to develop and produce their devices instead.\n\nMeanwhile, compatriot LG Electronics is expecting operating profits of 781 billion won and revenues of 15.7 trillion won, a rise of 4.3% and 1.8% from a year ago, respectively.\n\nLG's home appliance business is expected to contribute the lion's share of the company's profits and revenue yet again, while the mobile business is likely to report a significant reduction in its losses despite it being the main thorn in its overall profit for years. LG transferred its phone production from South Korea to Vietnam earlier this year in a bid to better control costs.\n\nBoth Samsung and LG will release their full earnings report at the end of the month.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nSamsung reorganises Chinese phone production\n\nBy closing all of its phone factories in China, Samsung will rely more on original device makers to create its phones going forward.\n\nFold fight! Can Surface Duo deliver more productivity than Galaxy Fold?\n\nIt looks like Microsoft may have just stalled some Galaxy Fold sales with the Duo announcement. The Duo brings two larger displays, pen support, and a more robust design, but it's not as functional as a phone.\n\nSix days with the Samsung Galaxy Fold: Is it really as fragile as Samsung warns?\n\nSamsung's new Galaxy Fold is an engineering marvel and presents a huge leap forward in smartphone innovation.
