I listened to people whose wisdom I respected. I read. I weighed what I heard at church and found in the Bible against what I saw in the world around me. I thought things through. I made my choices.\n\nAll of us do that, to one degree or another. We come to our own conclusions and \u2014 soon enough \u2014 we come to realize that not everyone shares them. People think differently. They place their faith in different ideas and in different kinds of people.\n\nWASHINGTON SUPREME COURT RULES AGAINST FLORIST WHO REFUSED SERVICE FOR GAY COUPLE'S WEDDING\n\nOur ideals run up against each other. We disagree. Sometimes we debate. Sometimes we end up avoiding each other, or smiling and gently steering around the more sensitive points of disagreement. That\u2019s how we respect each other's freedom. That\u2019s how we get along.\n\nBut sadly, my home state of Washington has chosen not to get along with me. In June, my state Supreme Court reaffirmed what it said just over two years ago: that I must use my skills as a creative professional to express messages and to celebrate and participate in events that violate my faith.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why I\u2019m appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court once again. As a floral artist, I am required by law to use my soul and imagination, as well as my mind and hands, to design original floral arrangements that celebrate events and ideas I don\u2019t believe in.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nAnd because I chose not to create custom floral arrangements for a long-time customer\u2019s same-sex wedding \u2014 a customer I considered a friend \u2014 I am required to pay the American Civil Liberties Union attorneys who are suing me. While the exact sum has not yet been determined, it will likely be so high as to cost me everything I\u2019ve saved over my lifetime.\n\nThe legal officers of my state government have the power to destroy not only me, but the life of any person whose personal beliefs don\u2019t match their own. I can\u2019t think of anything more contrary to freedom, or more dangerous to the things you believe in.\n\nI did not refuse to sell my friend flowers. I didn\u2019t throw him out of my shop. I gently explained my beliefs, told him of other nearby floral shops, hugged him and wished him luck.\n\nHis friendship is important to me, even now. He and his partner and their feelings are important to me. But this was not about selling them a product. This was about investing part of me in celebrating something that conflicts with my faith.\n\nMy flowers come from a garden. But my talent for designing flowers comes from a much deeper place: my heart and soul. I can\u2019t separate my art from who I am. And if I were to create art celebrating an idea that runs counter to my deepest beliefs, I\u2019d be violating those beliefs.\n\nWhile the Washington Supreme Court doesn\u2019t get this, the U.S. Supreme Court seems to understand. Last year, in Janus v. AFSCME, the high court said that it is \u201calways demeaning\u201d to force someone to support messages they reject.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the justices of the high court sent my case back to the Washington Supreme Court, with specific directions to reconsider its earlier ruling against me based on the Masterpiece Cakeshop decision. But instead of recognizing that anti-religious hostility infused the state\u2019s crusade against me, the Washington court repeated verbatim much of what it said the first time around.\n\nAnd since then, in two other cases involving creative professionals, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and the Arizona Supreme Court have affirmed the freedoms I am seeking to preserve for everyone.\n\nAs the Arizona court said so well, beliefs like the ones I hold about marriage \u201cmay seem old-fashioned, or even offensive to some. But the guarantees of free speech and freedom of religion are not only for those who are deemed sufficiently enlightened, advanced, or progressive. They are for everyone.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIf you have convictions \u2014 faith in God, or deep-down beliefs about anything else \u2014 the Washington Supreme Court\u2019s decision should give you pause. The Constitution doesn\u2019t just apply to me. If we lose this case, you'll lose your freedoms as well.\n\nThe legal officers of my state government have the power to destroy not only me, but the life of any person whose personal beliefs don\u2019t match their own.
