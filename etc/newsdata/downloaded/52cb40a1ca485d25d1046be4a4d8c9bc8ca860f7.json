The latest update for the battle royale game features a new crossover event with the upcoming shooter Borderlands 3. That includes expected additions, like a Psycho skin and Claptrap backpack you can purchase, along with free rewards like weapon wraps and sprays.\n\nMore interesting, though, is an entirely new area that\u2019s popped up near Paradise Palms that\u2019s based on Pandora, the strange planet where the Borderlands series takes place. The area appears as a rift zone \u2014 a new kind of temporary space introduced in season X \u2014 and it looks an awful lot like Borderlands, complete with cel-shaded visuals for Fortnite characters. If you stay in the zone long enough without taking any damage, you\u2019ll start generating a shield.\n\nFortnite has become a popular home for film crossover events, including blockbusters like Avengers: Endgame and John Wick: Chapter 3. But this marks the first major collaboration with another video game. (Unless you count the brief life of the Infinity Blade.) Outside of the crossover event, Fortnite is also getting a fairly large update; the most notable addition is the new Shield Bubble item. You can check out the full patch notes right here.\n\nThe Borderlands 3 event will last until September 10th, just a few days before the game\u2019s September 13th launch date.", "description": "After crossover events with Avengers: Endgame and John Wick: Chapter 3, the latest collaboration for Fortnite features Borderlands 3 characters like Psycho and Claptrap.", "authors": ["Andrew Webster", "Aug"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/03QLpgySkYWZnACNp_xHMG5pP3g=/0x38:1920x1043/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19122290/Fortnite_blog_mayhem_comes_to_fortnite__EN_10BR_Mayhem_Social__1__1920x1080_24596d7b451f94454d9404904c41e72a503930ee.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-27"}
