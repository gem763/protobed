Shear\n\nOn the morning of Jan. 11, 2018, Senator Richard Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, received a phone call from the president of the United States, Donald J. Trump, summoning him to the White House. Durbin had been working for months with Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, on a deal to grant legal status to the so-called \u201cDreamers\u201d \u2014 children who had been brought illegally into the country by their parents when they were very young, had grown up here and knew only the United States as home. The news from Trump was encouraging. \u201cWow,\u201d Durbin told an aide. \u201cI think we may actually have a deal.\u201d\n\nDurbin and Graham \u2014 who received a similar call that morning \u2014 expected a private meeting with the president, but as they waited in the West Wing lobby a phalanx of hard-liners arrived, led by Stephen Miller, the young mastermind of Trump\u2019s draconian immigration policies. Were they being ambushed? Durbin wondered. Indeed, they were. The meeting lapsed into a notorious Trump rant \u2014 about accepting immigrants from \u201cshithole countries.\u201d The president seemed amazed by the Durbin-Graham proposal: \u201cWait a minute \u2014 why do we want people from Haiti here?\u201d Why not more people from Norway? Graham was flabbergasted: What had happened between 10 a.m., when the president called offering the deal, and noon, when the historic Oval Office tirade had taken place? \u201cI don\u2019t know where that guy\u201d \u2014 the more amenable Trump \u2014 \u201cwent,\u201d Graham told the homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen days later. \u201cI want him back.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s bigoted eruption was instant news. But the context provided by the New York Times journalists Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Michael D. Shear in their exquisitely reported \u201cBorder Wars\u201d reveals the shattering horror of the moment, the mercurial unreliability and instability of the president. Davis and Shear perform this contextual service time and again throughout their book, which is essential reading for those searching for the \u201cbeating heart\u201d of the Trump administration. The authors argue it is immigration policy, and who can dispute that? From his very first news conference as a presidential candidate, when he denounced Mexican border-crossers as rapists and criminals, a rancid nativism \u2014 aimed at people who have darker skins than Norwegians \u2014 has been Trump\u2019s tribalist weapon of choice, his scalpel prodding the worst impulses of the American spirit.\n\nNativism isn\u2019t as American as apple pie \u2014 indeed, it is the very opposite of our country\u2019s heterogeneous intention \u2014 but it has been with us since the Irish began arriving in droves in the mid-19th century. It has almost always been a minor chord in American politics, but it has flared from time to time \u2014 with the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882, the harsh restrictions on southern and eastern Europeans in 1924, and again today, 50 years after Lyndon Johnson liberalized immigration policy in 1965.", "description": "\u201cBorder Wars,\u201d by Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Michael D.
