TAP HERE TO LISTEN\n\nNow Pick 10 is expected to be the centrepiece of a deal for Fremantle star Bradley Hill, with Blake Acres flying west to consider whether he\u2019ll join the Dockers and help the deal along.\n\nIn essence, the Saints will be swapping Picks 6 and 59, a future third-round pick and potentially a second-round pick, for Bradley Hill, Paddy Ryder and Dougal Howard.\n\nPOTENTIAL BRADLEY HILL TRADE\n\nFremantle gets: Pick 10, future second-round pick, Blake Acres\n\nSt Kilda gets: Brad Hill and late picks\n\nThe Saints are also set to add Zak Jones from Sydney in exchange for a second-round pick while Richmond\u2019s Dan Butler may also join the club.\n\n\u201cI think this has been awesome work by St Kilda,\u201d dual premiership Kangaroo David King said on Fox Footy\u2019s Trading Day.\n\n\u201c(List manager) James Gallagher has done a fantastic job.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got him (Bradley Hill) effectively for going back four picks, from 6 to 10, and for a future second rounder - which is in a weak pool next year.\n\n\u201cWe know 2020 is going to be a heavily compromised draft. And maybe the numbers don\u2019t really equate, at this stage, as to what the talent you\u2019re actually going to get.\u201d\n\nNicks signs 3 year deal 9:51\n\nKing described Dougal Howard as a \u201cpotential All-Australian\u201d, while Herald Sun journalist Jon Ralph was also full of praise for the Saints\u2019 work.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the great trade periods we\u2019ve seen in a decade,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cJames Gallagher comes in, a first-year list manager, right now Dougal Howard for a decade, Jones and Hill as A-graders, they\u2019ll get Ryder and Butler as well.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an exceptional trade period.\u201d\n\nHawks make Giant move 0:27\n\nSt Kilda champion Leigh Montagna was on the same page.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a great win for St Kilda,\u201d he said of the trade with Port Adelaide.\n\n\u201cDougal Howard, 200 centimetres, athletic intercept defender. Probably what St Kilda really need, Nathan Brown\u2019s getting late in his career, Jake Carlisle also.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a great get and really ... they haven\u2019t given up a great deal to get these players. I think Gallagher and Simon Lethlean have done a great job.\u201d\n\nEmotional return for Betts 2:30\n\nWhile Blake Acres has shown potential at the Saints, most agree he\u2019s yet to live up to it, which means if he heads to Fremantle it could be the best scenario for both parties.\n\n\u201cIf Jack Martin has been the number one tease in the AFL, then this bloke in Blake Acres is on the podium,\u201d Ralph said.\n\n\u201cFor that reason - only two Brownlow votes in 75 games - if you\u2019re a St Kilda fan, you\u2019ll think, I just don\u2019t think we\u2019re ever going to see the best of him.\n\n\u201cHe might well flourish at another football club.\u201d", "description": "St Kilda is having \u201cone of the great trade periods we\u2019ve seen in a decade\u201d with two players already joining the club and three more likely to arrive on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Staff Writers", "Source", "Fox Sports"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/6cebc41ddd728cf8984ab8b1f91ad0a8", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
