His sons, Luke, age five, and Max, age three, are going as Han Solo and Chewbacca.\n\n\u201cParents always want to do something special for their kids,\u201d Lehmkuhl told \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d\n\nSean Lehmkuhl via Storyful\n\nHe said he spent a month and a half building the costume, using weekends, weeknights and even lunch breaks to finalize his masterpiece. He modeled his to-scale version of the starship after the original 1977 Millennium Falcon toy, and he published a video showcasing his step by step process.\n\nA lifelong \u201cStar Wars\u201d fan, Lehmkuhl has been collecting vintage toys from the series with his brother since the 90s.\n\n\u201cMy kids don\u2019t even have to go out and walk to get candy. They just drive down the street, and everybody wants to come out and see the costumes. It\u2019s a draw for the neighborhood,\u201d Lehmkuhl added.\n\nThis is the fourth year that Lehmkuhl has created a detailed mobile costume for his sons. Last year, he built an Ecto-1 from \u201cGhostbusters,\" and the year before, he made them a Batmobile.\n\nThis year\u2019s \u201cStar Wars\u201d theme is a family affair. Lehmkuhl said that he is going as Obi-Wan Kenobi, and his wife is going as Princess Leia.\n\nLehmkuhl emphasized that not only was this project a great creative outlet for him but he also wanted to give his sons a memory that they\u2019ll carry with them well after Halloween is over.\n\n\u201cMy kids are at the ages now where they\u2019re excited, and for them, it\u2019s more the experience of driving (the Millennium Falcon) and going outside and playing and pretending that they\u2019re \u2018Star Wars\u2019 characters,\u201d Lehmkuhl said. \u201cWhen they get older, I think they\u2019re going to appreciate how much time and effort I put into it so that they could have those memories.\u201d", "description": "One Cincinnati father is taking Halloween to a new- almost intergalactic level- by building a mini Millennium Falcon for his sons this Halloween.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/millenium-falcon-01-ht-jef-191028_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
