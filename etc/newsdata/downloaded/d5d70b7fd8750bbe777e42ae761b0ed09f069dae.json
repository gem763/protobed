Legislators say the law covers all electronic smoking devices and their parts and accessories. Fourteen other states have similar legislation seeking to prevent young people from getting hooked on nicotine.\n\nThe law is taking effect as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention investigates a mysterious lung illness that has killed some vapers.\n\nThe Baltimore Sun reports enforcement will focus on sellers, not underage buyers. Retailers that break the law face fines that escalate from $300 for a first offense to $3,000 for subsequent violations.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
