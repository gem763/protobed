At first, I think his fan is a hotel guest and wonder how on earth she recognises the screenwriter and playwright behind the Bafta-winning National Treasure, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child and the much-anticipated BBC adaptation of Philip Pullman\u2019s His Dark Materials. But then I recognise her as the teenage star Jade Croot from his harrowing new Channel 4 drama, The Accident. She couldn\u2019t look less like the tough and rebellious character she plays in the gripping four-parter about a community tragedy in a Welsh village.\n\nBut as I walk over to Thorne, it turns out he is also in awe of someone in the room. He gets up to greet me, looking meek and mild \u2013 slightly nervous, even, as he says hello. \u201cDo you watch Succession?\u201d he whispers excitedly, gesturing to his right. \u201cThat is the guy from Succession over there. [Creator] Jesse Armstrong \u2013 he\u2019s a genius.\u201d\n\nThorne has been spending a lot of time recently with another writer discussed with similar reverence \u2013 Philip Pullman. \u201cThat is the biggest thrill of working on adaptations \u2013 spending time with the authors,\u201d Thorne says. He describes the children\u2019s author as a \u201cvery kind and exacting man\u201d whom he met at his \u201cbeautiful farmhouse \u2013 well, I think it\u2019s a farmhouse\u201d outside Oxford many times while adapting His Dark Materials, which will air next month with a starry cast that includes James McAvoy, Ruth Wilson and Lin-Manuel Miranda.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cPhilip\u2019s been the person who has created Lyra\u2019s story and I\u2019m trying to be as faithful to her as he was,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m trying to treasure the good stuff, all of it is beautiful, but there are some demands of the medium that mean that sometimes you have to step away. But I do it reluctantly and I do it as faithfully as I possibly can.\u201d\n\nThorne carried out what he refers to as a \u201cPhD in Philip Pullman\u201d to create the TV script, finding clues in all the hefty tomes. \u201cPhilip has got an incredible mind. And one of the things we tried to do was to sort of pick him up and shake him to get all the stories out. We would go there armed with different things we had taken from different bits of the story and go, \u2018So what is the thread that connects these things?\u2019 And he would tell us little unheard stories that had occurred in gaps of the chapters.\u201d\n\nHaving Pullman on tap made a change from getting \u201cstuck\u201d, he says, as writers often find themselves. \u201cHe just gives you the answers to everything.\u201c\n\nIt was a different process working as a storyteller with JK Rowling in a \u201cbeautiful writing hut\u201d at the back of her house in Edinburgh on their Harry Potter stage hit, before he went off and wrote the script himself.\n\n\u201cWith Philip my job is to serve the books. But with Jo it was serving the characters \u2013 but 19 years later.\u201d The idea for the show stemmed from Rowling\u2019s last chapter of the last Harry Potter book, 19 Years Later, about an older Harry who is 40.\n\nThorne was starstruck by Rowling and drafted in his wife to read his emails to the author before he sent them. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to sound too desperate to be her friend. That thing of writing to somebody you really admire and just not making yourself sound like a dick.\u201d\n\nCollaborating seems to come naturally to Thorne, who made his name as one of the writers on the era-defining E4 teen drama Skins, and would later co-write with Shane Meadows much of the latter\u2019s This is England TV series, as well as their well-received The Virtues, based on Meadows\u2019s repressed childhood memories of sexual abuse. But he\u2019s also known for solo works, including a heap of plays \u2013 most recently one about his parents in The End of The World at the Royal Court earlier this year, which is his most personal work to date and had rave reviews.\n\nHis latest fast-paced TV drama, The Accident, is the final part of a trilogy that included National Treasure (2016), which was inspired by Operation Yewtree and Kiri (2018) about the abduction of a nine-year-old girl.\n\nThe Accident tackles justice in the aftermath of a community tragedy in a Welsh village, caused when Jade Croot\u2019s Leona, armed with graffiti aerosol cans, leads her mates into a construction site, which then dramatically explodes. Sarah Lancashire, who starred in Kiri, plays Leona\u2019s mum.\n\nAll three TV shows take a peek behind the UK\u2019s curtains and at \u201cour blame culture\u201d, Thorne says, as well as at issues including \u201cguilt, innocence, justice, and gender, race, class \u2013you know, the things that define us slightly\u201d.\n\n\u201cI just feel like this has been my opportunity to say \u2018This is how I feel about our world\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m aware that my shelf life is limited. That there is going to be a time, probably quite soon, when I\u2019m not wanted. This is the sort of writer I want to try and be.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 35 times actors fell in love on set Show all 35 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

When the two split up in 1993, he had the tattoo changed to \u201cWino Forever\u201d. Apparently Hairspray director John Waters, was ordained as a minister just to officiate their wedding, but he talked them out of it, as Ryder, then aged 19, was so young. 10/35 Mia Goth and Shia Lebeouf \u2013 Nymphomaniac (2012) Goth, a then-unknown British actor, met Hollywood star Lebeouf on the set of Lars von Trier\u2019s sexually provocative film Nymphomaniac.

They managed to get through the film, and became one of Hollywood's favourite real-life couples for the next three years \u2013 until they split in 2007.

Although they met in 1966 on set of a Disney movie, it was during the filming of this World War II romance film that Russell said to her, \u201cMan, you've got a great figure.\u201d Not the most romantic of sentences, but it did the trick. The couple have vowed not to marry, but they have a son together, as well as Hawn\u2019s two children from her marriage to Bill Hudson. Hawn said: \u201cI like waking up every day and seeing that he is there and knowing that I have a choice.

She's so fierce and brave... it kind of bowled me over.\" They married in a private ceremony in Spain in 2017, and now reside in Lisbon, Portugal. Getty\n\nThorne lives in London with his wife, Rachel, who does IVF counselling and their son Elliot, 3, whom they finally had after seven rounds of IVF.\n\nTheir fertility struggles inspired his play The Solid Life of Sugar Water at the National Theatre in 2016 after he felt \u201can inability to reach [Rachel]\u201d. But now with these trials behind him, he wants to discuss Peppa Pig.\n\n\u201cHave you been to Peppa Pig World?\u201d he asks me. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing. I took Elliott yesterday. I really recommend it. Elliott went nuts for it. He didn\u2019t want to leave. I was on the ride \u2013 you know the Windy Castle story in Peppa? And you are spiralling higher and higher \u2013 and they were doing this thing where they are playing with you being in the wind \u2013 and I was terrified. And I was thinking that fundamentally [The Accident] is a show about being a parent and losing your kid. I don\u2019t think I could have written The Accident without being a dad.\u201d\n\nBut for all his apparent time off to hang out with his son, he is actually \u201cthe hardest-working man I have ever met\u201d according to Meadows and a self-confessed workaholic: \u201cI\u2019ve got an addiction problem and I\u2019m trying to deal with that addiction problem which is work. I\u2019m still working it out to be honest,\u201d says Thorne.\n\n\u201cI have been a terrible friend \u2013 a friend of mine emailed me at Christmas time last year to say \u2018Where the f**k have you been? I\u2019ve been in pain and you haven\u2019t been anywhere near\u2019 and that really stuck with me. I have been a bad husband. I\u2019ve been an OK dad. I have always made time for Elliot.\u201d\n\nThere was a time when Thorne used to write all night as a bachelor in Luton, until he got married and pencilled in half a day off to spend with his wife, but now, as a parent, it has all changed.\n\n\u201cWork and Elliott became my life for about three years and now I\u2019m emerging from that and trying to work out how to be more than just a dad and a writer,\u201d he says.\n\nBorn in Bristol, Thorne started writing plays \u2013 about 22 in total \u2013 during his time at Cambridge University and while attending the Royal Court young writers\u2019 programme. When You Cure Me was his debut proper, performed at the Bush Theatre in 2005.\n\nWhat made him persevere with playwriting? Thorne had the \u201damazing luck\u201d, he says, to meet his close friend Laura Wade, who wrote the smash hit Posh, on the young writers\u2019 programme.\n\n\u201cShe became a superstar very quickly. So as I was watching her become venerated, she was also reading everything I did. She was telling me I was worth something and she was supporting me \u2026and to have someone like that \u2013 someone on the one hand I thought was a great writer but on the other hand other people knew was a great writer, who was prepared to put that time into me \u2013 that was crucial and I may not have stuck it without her.\u201d There are other mentors along the way, he says, including Teresa Topolski who was a reader at the Bush, \u201cwho made me a better writer\u201d and \u201cgave me good advice\u201d.\n\nBut it was when he was asked to write an episode of Skins, the raucous, groundbreaking teen drama, that his career took off. \u201cIt was like being given the keys to the kingdom,\u201d he says about the show that premiered in 2007. \u201cAnd it happened so quickly \u2013 you know, bewildering fast \u2013 and then it was on telly and people went really wild. It was just one of those things, when suddenly all your dreams are coming true. How has this happened to me?\u201d\n\nThorne wrote five episodes \u2013 \u201cit was an incredible ride,\u201d he says \u2013 including stand-out episode \"Effy\", in which quiet runaway teen Effy blurts out a profound statement: \u201cSometimes I think I was born backwards... you know, come out of my mum the wrong way. I hear words go past me backwards. The people I should love I hate, and the people I hate\u2026\u201d\n\nHe credits Skins\u2019 creator Bryan Elsley, who wrote the show with his son, Jamie Brittain, with teaching him to write for TV. \u201cBryan was very kind and always gave space to other writers. He is a brilliant writer and an equally brilliant script editor. He taught us all how to screen-write because he basically had a bunch of people \u2013 Lucy Kirkwood (Chimerica), Ben Schiffer (Stan Lee\u2019s Lucky Man), Dan Kaluuya (the Get Out star) who had never written before for telly. And he taught us all how to do it. These people who are capable of teaching others have such an incredible legacy. There are not many of them in telly, but Bryan is the best of them.\u201d\n\nKirkwood went on to do great things after Skins, but has he come across sexism in the industry? \u201cYes, I suspect I have seen quite a lot of it, I suspect I have been aware of some of it. I couldn\u2019t identify moments when I\u2019ve seen it sort of with a hammer blow, but I think that is what prejudice is \u2013 it is subtle,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI have seen writers fall by the wayside that shouldn\u2019t have fallen by the wayside. It\u2019s a structural problem \u2013 so you would encounter other people being blocked.\u201d\n\nHe lists his close female friends who were luckier and \u201ccaught fire\u201d, not just Wade and Kirkwood, but also Fleabag\u2019s Phoebe Waller-Bridge, whom he met when she was in her second year at Rada.\n\n\u201cI noticed it a lot more with disability, I\u2019d say \u2013 I see just straightforward prejudice. I think the inherent bias against people with disability is still incredibly disgusting.\u201d\n\nAfter a writing stint on Skins and Shameless, Thorne met Meadows through the drama department of Channel 4. They had turned down a script he had written, but offered to put him forward as Meadows\u2019s co-writer on This is England \u201886.\n\n\u201cActually in a cab on the way back from Channel 4, the first time we met, we came up with the ending of This is England \u201886 \u2013 how it was going to work with Combo [who is sent to jail for a crime he didn\u2019t commit]. We were just talking and talking and talking. It always felt good and fruitful.\u201d\n\nThorne always writes about real people with real issues. I wonder if there is more appetite for social realism now in the current climate of political disillusionment and reality TV? \u201cWhen I left Skins in 2007-2008, nothing was being made. It was like there was a barren landscape.\n\n\"If you wanted to get your own drama series, you were sort of throwing a pebble into a really deep well,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was exclusively Britain\u2019s Got Talent and The X Factor and everything else \u2013 then Downton Abbey came along in 2010. Suddenly there was an appetite for drama \u2013 and when there is an appetite for it \u2013 suddenly there is an appetite for lots of different things, including social realism. Now there is room for diversity of content.\u201d\n\nThorne admits he is in a very privileged position and wants to help more writers coming up through the ranks. \u201cI see it as my responsibility to make the time.\u201d Soon, though, he will be back at his desk writing series three of His Dark Materials. Series two has already been filmed.\n\n\u2018The Accident\u2019 begins on Channel 4 on 24 October at 9pm. \u2018His Dark Materials\u2019 starts on BBC1 on 3 November", "description": "I\u2019m sitting in a London hotel lounge and a young timid looking Welsh girl has just curtsied to Jack Thorne, with an adoring look in her eyes.", "authors": ["Charlotte Cripps"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/16/18/jack-thorne.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
