The atmosphere in Liberty Plaza is extraordinary. I can\u2019t think of another dance company in the world that could draw so large and so festive a crowd. Most of the audience have brought picnics, many enduring a day of rainstorms to bag a position close to the stage. Yet, although this is a special performance \u2013 one of the last before Cloud Gate\u2019s founding director Lin Hwai-min steps down \u2013 such devotion has been normal for the company almost since it was formed.\n\nCloud Gate was named as the outstanding company at the British National Dance awards last year and is a headline attraction of the new Sadler\u2019s Wells season. Lin\u2019s success in turning a small experimental dance company into a national icon and international brand is a remarkable story. Now 71, with a fierce energy and a huge crinkled smile, Lin acknowledges that he had almost no experience of professional dance when he staged his first programme back in 1973, and discovered that he\u2019d sold 3,000 tickets for just two shows. \u201cI almost had a nervous breakdown,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought, \u2018My god, now I have to learn how to choreograph.\u2019\u201d\n\nI am from a generation who believe it is their duty to make a difference Lin Hwai-min\n\nIn the south of Taiwan, where Lin grew up, there had been very little dance to see. At the age of five he fell in love with the film The Red Shoes but nine years later, when he took his first ballet class, it proved a huge disappointment: \u201cI had a book, All You Need to Know About Ballet, and I could tell that the teacher wasn\u2019t doing things correctly.\u201d Already a precociously literary teenager, inspired by Hemingway, Fitzgerald and classical Chinese poetry, Lin focused his energies on becoming a writer. By the age of 22, he\u2019d published his first collection of short stories and had been offered a fellowship at the International Writers\u2019 Programme in Idaho.\n\nOnce he arrived in the US, though, contemporary dance grabbed his imagination. Lin was able to see the companies of Paul Taylor, Merce Cunningham and Jos\u00e9 Lim\u00f3n \u2013 and take classes at the Martha Graham school. He even created his first work: a tortuously complicated piece, he now realises, about \u201ca philosopher who dreams he becomes a butterfly\u201d. When he returned to Taipei, he was by default the local expert on contemporary dance. With musicians, dancers and artists all curious to know more, he was persuaded to set up a company.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Beckoning by Cloud Gate 2, a sister company set up to enact grassroots change.

They also drew on distinctively Taiwanese subject matter: Portrait of the Families addressed the massacre of political and intellectual dissidents under Chiang Kai-shek; the pastoral masterpiece Rice evoked the rhythms and landscape of rural Taiwan.\n\nThis choice of local subject matter was radical in itself: during the 28 years of Chiang\u2019s regime, as well the Japanese rule that preceded it, the island\u2019s language and culture had been brutally repressed. When Lin created his 1978 work Legacy, about early Taiwanese settlers, he had to stage the premiere in the south of the island, far away from the National Security Bureau in Taipei.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mentor \u2026 Lin Hwai-min, left, with Cheng Tsung-lung.

In 1996, we had our first direct presidential election. Now we have a woman president and we have legalised gay marriage.\u201d It matters profoundly to him that he has been an instrument for change, helping to found a flourishing dance department at the National Arts University and using a second company, Cloud Gate 2, to bring dance classes and performance to impoverished regions of Taiwan.\n\nThe love he\u2019s earned is palpable. Back in the early 90s, when he tried to shuck off the exhausting burden of Cloud Gate, Lin was shamed into returning by a reproachful taxi driver, who said to him: \u201cThere is hardship in every profession, Mr Lin. It is hard for me to earn a living in the traffic of Taipei. But we need Cloud Gate. So drive on.\u201d\n\nIn 2008, when the company\u2019s rehearsal base was destroyed by a fire, Lin did not have to ask for help in building a new home: more than 4,000 people spontaneously sent donations, including one small boy who offered all of his pocket money. While others might cling on to such love, Lin is adamant that he\u2019s \u201csimply looking after a public property\u201d: his final gift to Cloud Gate will be to step down at the end of this year having created as smooth a transition as possible for his successor.\n\nLin has been mentoring Cheng Tsung-lung for years, watching him develop as a dancer and choreographer, appointing him director of Cloud Gate 2 in 2014, but he\u2019s delighted that Cheng is a very different artist from him. \u201cI came from a family of poets and scholars but Tsung-lung came from mud,\u201d he says. \u201cI envy him that.\u201d Lin points to that fact that, while his mother made him listen to Schubert and Beethoven after school, Cheng\u2019s parents had him working the street markets from the age of eight, selling slippers made at his father\u2019s factory.\n\nThe two men do, however, share a childhood interest in dance. Cheng, talking through a translator, says he was \u201ca very active little boy, always bumping into things, with too much energy\u201d and was sent to dance classes to calm down. He describes how rapidly he learned that showing off his moves in the market brought business to his stall. Even though he endured a troubled adolescence, getting involved with serious drugs and sentenced to two years\u2019 probation and community service, Cheng continued to stick with dance.\n\nWhen there was a choice between going into the slipper factory or going to university, he opted to study dance at degree level. \u201cIt was the only thing I was good at,\u201d he laughs, although he says it was only when a back injury forced him to focus temporarily on choreography that he discovered a true sense of vocation. \u201cWhen I was a child, I used to make up stories about the people on the street. I didn\u2019t have many opportunities to go to cinema, and it was like making my own films.\u201d Once Cheng realised that creating dance was like an extension of those childhood fantasies, his work developed rapidly.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Against the grain \u2026 a performance of Song of the Wanderers by Cloud Gate. Photograph: Yu Hui-hung\n\nLin says it\u2019s been one of the highlights of his career to watch Cheng mature: \u201cHe gets scared, turns into a skeleton during the creative process, but it is wonderful to see. His work is very different from mine, very dark, and he can speak to the internet generation in a way that I can\u2019t.\u201d\n\n13 Tongues, which Cloud Gate will bring to London next year, is typical of Cheng\u2019s work in its fusion of local Taiwanese culture, contemporary music and a sophisticated digital sensibility. It\u2019s a fantastical but deeply urban piece, redolent both of ancient superstitions and the clamour of modern Taipei, with black-clad dancers massing in ritualised patterns against a digitally created art work, calling out the raucous rhythmic chants of street hawkers and singing Taoist chants.\n\nAmazing grace: 45 years of Cloud Gate Dance Theatre \u2013 in pictures Read more\n\nCheng, aged 43, talks and dresses like a member of modern, edgy Taipei, but he brings a very old-fashioned sense of commitment to his job: \u201cMy responsibility is about how I can keep on working for dance and connecting it with all the people here,\u201d he says, recalling his first experiences of community work with Cloud Gate 2. \u201cWe were going into remote parts of Taiwan to help people liberate what\u2019s inside of them, and it reminded me of when I was a child, when the street vendors would start playing their cassettes and everyone would be dancing and enjoying their bodies.\u201d\n\nHis reverence for Cloud Gate\u2019s contribution to the island as a whole is touchingly direct. \u201cIt has brought us inspiration and dignity. At first, when people came to watch the company, they didn\u2019t know how to behave in a public place, they didn\u2019t know about not talking or not leaving their trash. This society loves Cloud Gate and Mr Lin \u2013 but Mr Lin has also brought society to a higher place.\u201d", "description": "Lin Hwai-min has spent 46 years tackling revolt, repression and rice in his fast-changing homeland.
