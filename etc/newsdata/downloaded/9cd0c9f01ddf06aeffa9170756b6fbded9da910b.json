The recall follows legal losses and an investigative report linking asbestos exposure to the company\u2019s talc products.\n\nThe recall will affect only one lot of baby powder, which still amounts up to 33,000 bottles. According to the company, it was prompted by the FDA finding \u201csub-trace levels of chrysotile asbestos contamination\u201d in a sample taken from a bottle bought online; another lot tested by the FDA turned up negative. There seem to have been no reports of injury linked to the products. But in a statement by the company Saturday, the company said that the recall was made \u201cout of an abundance of caution.\u201d\n\nEditor's Note: It is unlikely that these recalled bottles were sold in Australia.\n\nThe company added that it \u201chas a rigorous testing standard in place to ensure its cosmetic talc is safe and years of testing, including the FDA\u2019s own testing on prior occasions \u2014 and as recently as last month \u2014 found no asbestos.\u201d\n\nLast December, however, an investigative report by Reuters uncovered evidence showing that the company knew for decades that some of its own and independent tests had detected asbestos in its products; J&J also took steps to conceal these results from the public as well as the FDA, Reuters reported. The company has outright denied these allegations and argued that the overall scientific evidence does not point to a link between talc-based consumer products and cancer.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s thought to be no safe level of exposure to asbestos in humans. And because talc is often mined near sources of asbestos, there\u2019s always a risk of cross-contamination.\n\nThis March, a jury sided with a California woman who argued that she had developed cancer from decades of using J&J\u2019s baby powder, awarding her $43 million; the company also failed to overthrow a $7 billion verdict rendered in another case involving 22 women last December. The plaintiffs in these more recent cases, unlike previous attempts to sue the company over its baby powder products, have explicitly argued that talc-related asbestos could have caused their cancer.\n\nIn 2018, the FDA embarked on a new fact-finding mission, testing a variety of talc-based cosmetic products for asbestos. While a final report is still pending, the agency has periodically sent public advisories and pushed for recalls of products that contained asbestos.\n\nIn June, for instance, the cosmetics store Claire\u2019s announced a recall of products that the FDA had detected asbestos in, while another recall by Beauty Plus Global followed in September.", "description": "Johnson & Johnson\u00a0announced a voluntary recall of its talc-based baby powder products on Saturday, after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration found traces of cancer-causing asbestos in sample testing.
