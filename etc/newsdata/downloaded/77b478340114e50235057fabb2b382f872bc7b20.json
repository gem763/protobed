He gave Queen Elizabeth II \u201cunlawful\u201d advice to pause the legislature, an act that prevented Britain\u2019s elected politicians from carrying out their job of scrutinizing his government\u2019s actions at a critical time, the court found.\n\nThe ruling marks an extraordinary constitutional moment. It means many more questions about Johnson\u2019s approach to government in general and Brexit in particular. It blows a hole in his political authority and calls into question his ability to remain in office as the Queen\u2019s principal adviser. Senior politicians, including former Conservative Prime Minister John Major, demanded that he apologize to Parliament.\n\nJeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party, went further, calling for Johnson to resign.\n\n\u201cIt demonstrates a contempt for democracy and an abuse of power by him,\u201d Corbyn told party supporters. That call was echoed by other party leaders.\n\n\u2018Strongly Disagree\u2019\n\nOthers went less far, but suggested that, variously, Leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg, Attorney General Geoffrey Cox and Johnson\u2019s senior aide Dominic Cummings should resign.\n\nThe prime minister\u2019s office was determined to tough it out, saying he had confidence in his ministers and aides. Johnson himself said he would \u201cobviously\u201d respect the verdict, but also hit back at the judges. \u201cI have to say that I strongly disagree with what the justices have found,\u201d he told reporters in New York. \u201cI don\u2019t think that it\u2019s right, but we will go ahead and of course Parliament will come back.\u201d\n\nHow Brexit Has Unleashed a U.K. Constitutional Crisis: QuickTake\n\nThe immediate impact of the ruling is that Parliament resumes sitting at 11:30 a.m. Wednesday, the suspension voided. It has already passed one law blocking Johnson from pursuing a no-deal Brexit, and now has an opportunity to bolster that.\n\nCollateral Damage\n\nBut the deeper impact may be the damage to the prime minister\u2019s authority. Johnson won the contest to succeed Theresa May in July by promising to take a more confrontational approach to Brexit, and to threaten both the EU and Parliament in an effort to get his way.\n\nFar from delivering results, that strategy has yielded little from the EU, and has blown up in his face at home. More than 20 members of Parliament have left the Conservative Party rather than follow his lead, he has lost every House of Commons vote he has contested, and now the courts have ruled against him.\n\nThe prime minister is due to land back in London from New York, where he\u2019s been attending the United Nations General Assembly, shortly before Parliament resumes sitting. His officials wouldn\u2019t say whether he was planning to address the House of Commons himself -- it could depend what time he lands -- but he\u2019ll not be able to avoid an appearance for long.\n\nHe will face questions about the immediate issue, including what he told the Queen when asking her for the suspension, and challenges about his Brexit plans. Johnson continues to insist that he will get Britain out of the EU, without a deal if necessary.\n\nIf You\u2019re Wondering How Hard a \u2018Hard Brexit\u2019 Could Be: QuickTake\n\n\u2018That Objective\u2019\n\n\u201cThe most important thing is we get on and deliver Brexit on Oct. 31, and clearly the claimants in this case are determined to frustrate that and to stop that,\u201d he told reporters after the verdict. \u201cI think it would be very unfortunate if Parliament made that objective which the people want more difficult, but we will get on.\u201d\n\nFurther court battles could lie ahead. Johnson\u2019s team have threatened to ignore the new law that was designed to stop a no-deal divorce by forcing him to seek a Brexit delay by Oct. 19 if he is unable to reach agreement with the bloc.\n\nIf they did, it would likely trigger another court challenge. Johnson\u2019s aides are also braced for attempts in Parliament to pass laws potentially canceling Brexit altogether.\n\nThe ruling overshadowed the final day of the prime minister\u2019s visit to the UN. He was awake at 5:30 a.m. New York time for the damning verdict. Later in the day, he spoke by phone to the Queen -- his office refused to say what they discussed -- and then had a half-hour conference call with his cabinet.\n\n\u2018This Crisis\u2019\n\nAccording to several people familiar with the discussion, speaking on condition of anonymity, the call found ministers divided on how to respond to the court. Rees-Mogg attacked the ruling, calling it a constitutional coup. But Justice Secretary Robert Buckland warned colleagues not to attack the impartiality of judges.\n\nIn New York, the prime minister has been meeting EU leaders in an attempt to persuade them to give ground so a deal can be done. Officials on both sides regard it as a make-or-break round of talks for the chances of getting a deal. His Irish counterpart, Leo Varadkar, said afterward that their discussion Tuesday had been \u201ca good meeting -- no agreements by any means, but we got into some more details.\u201d\n\nNot everything is against Johnson. Back in Britain, his opponents are divided both over their desired Brexit destination and the way to get there. Some want Britain to leave the EU, but with a deal. Others want a second referendum, with the goal of overturning the 2016 result. Some want to remove Johnson and replace him with a caretaker government to deliver that referendum.\n\nJohnson wants an election, in which he would pit himself as the peoples\u2019 champion against Parliament and the courts. Speaking for Labour, Corbyn said they too wanted an election -- but not yet.\n\n\u201cThis crisis can only be settled with a general election. That election needs to take place as soon as this government\u2019s threat of a disastrous no-deal is taken off the table,\u201d Corbyn said in a speech to Labour\u2019s annual conference.\n\nThat\u2019s a signal that Labour would support an election after Oct. 31. But that is five weeks away, which in British politics is turning out to be a very long time indeed.", "description": "Boris Johnson Flies Into His Gravest Crisis After Brexit Court Defeat", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic8017e7a583093d4b0bc59d1c529961b4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
