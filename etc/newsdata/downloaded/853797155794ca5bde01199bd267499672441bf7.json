The act requires sites to get parental consent before collecting the personal information of users who are under 13 years old.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nGoogle agreed to pay $34m to New York and $136m to the FTC \u2013 the largest penalty ever received by the US agency in a child privacy case. However, the sums are still a tiny fraction of YouTube\u2019s revenues, with the company estimated to have made $3.36bn in US ad revenue alone last year.\n\nThe settlement was passed in a 3-2 vote by the FTC \u2013 the two Democrats who voted against it claimed the fine was insufficient punishment for YouTube. Child advocacy groups who helped bring about the government investigation also criticised the size of the fine.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

YouTube \u201cbaited kids with nursery rhymes, cartoons, and more to feed its massively profitable behavioural advertising business\u201d, Mr Chopra tweeted. \u201cIt was lucrative, and it was illegal.\u201d\n\nHe said in his dissent that the settlement offered no individual accountability, insufficient remedies and a fine amount that \u201cstill allows the company to profit from its lawbreaking\u201d.\n\nJosh Golin, executive director of the Campaign for a Commercial Free Childhood, said: \u201cIt\u2019s extremely disappointing that the FTC isn\u2019t requiring more substantive changes or doing more to hold Google accountable for harming children through years of illegal data collection.\u201d\n\nIn a statement following the ruling, New York attorney general Letitia James said Google and YouTube \u201cknowingly and illegally monitored, tracked, and served targeted ads to young children\u201d in order to boost advertising revenues.\n\n\u201cThese companies put children at risk and abused their power, which is why we are imposing major reforms to their practices and making them pay one of the largest settlements for a privacy matter in US history,\u201d she said.\n\nFTC chair Joe Simons added: \u201cYouTube touted its popularity with children to prospective corporate clients. Yet when it came to complying with Coppa, the company refused to acknowledge that portions of its platform were clearly directed to kids. There is no excuse for YouTube\u2019s violation of the law.\u201d\n\nGoogle is already under a 2011 agreement with the FTC that barred it from misrepresenting its privacy policy and subjected the company to 20 years of regular, independent privacy audits. Google was fined $22.5m in 2012 for violating that settlement when the FTC found it improperly used tracking cookies on Apple\u2019s Safari browser.\n\nA Google spokesperson told The Independent that the firm had no further comment on the latest ruling but shared a blog post detailing changes it has made to the way it handles children\u2019s data.\n\n\u201cResponsibility is our number one priority at YouTube, and nothing is more important than protecting kids and their privacy,\u201d the blog post stated.\n\nOne of the main changes that Google is introducing will mean that anyone watching children\u2019s content on YouTube will be treated as a child, meaning any data collected on the viewing habits will be limited and no targeted ads will be served.\n\nComments and notifications on these videos will also be switched off, though some users say this measure will negatively impact content creators who have built businesses on producing and sharing child-focused content on YouTube.\n\nTo help support any YouTube channels affected by the changes, Google said it would establish a $100m fund dedicated to the creation of original children\u2019s content.\n\nThe FTC\u2019s fine against YouTube now needs to be approved by a federal court in Washington DC.\n\nAssociated Press contributed to this report", "description": "US regulators have fined Google\u00a0$170m\u00a0(\u00a3139m) for allegedly failing to protect children\u2019s privacy on YouTube.
