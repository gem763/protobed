Corley, a certified public accountant and certified financial planner, spent five years studying millionaires and gathered his insights in multiple books, including \"Change Your Habits, Change Your Life.\"\n\nCorley interviewed 233 people with at least $160,000 (roughly R2.4 million) in annual gross income and $3.2 million (roughly R48.5 million) in net assets, 177 of whom were self-made. He also interviewed 128 Americans with $35,000 (roughly R530,000) or less in annual gross income and $5,000 (roughly R75,000) or less in liquid assets.\n\nThrough these conversations and further analysis, he was able to identify two types of habits: those that helped people build wealth (\"rich habits\"), and those that worked against them. The latter habits have the power to cause financial, emotional, and mental destruction in a person's life, he says. To achieve success, one must identify these habits and replace them.\n\n\"Adopting one rich habit has the effect of eliminating many poor habits. That's why the rich habits are so powerful. Each one you adopt is like a double or triple in baseball,\" he writes.\n\nBelow are seven habits that won't lead to wealth, according to Corley.\n\n1. Overspending\n\nYou simply can't get rich spending more money than you make, whether it's buying a car or house you can barely afford or racking up a credit-card bill.\n\n\"Ninety-five percent of the poor in my study did not save and most accumulated debt to subsidize their standard of living,\" Corley wrote. True wealth comes from saving and investing a portion of what you earn, no matter the size of your salary.\n\n2. Reading only for entertainment, or not at all\n\nReading with intention is a top habit of millionaires.\n\nIn Corley's study, 92% of people with minimal assets did not read to learn. \"Success requires growth. That growth comes from reading and educating yourself on a daily basis,\" he writes.\n\n3. Toxic relationships\n\nIt's hard to sever ties with people who may be holding you back. But if you're serious about setting yourself up for a rich future, it has to be done, Corley says.\n\nHe found that only 4% of the low-income people he studied associated with \"success-minded\" people.\n\n\"You are only going to succeed in life if you surround yourself with the right type of people,\" he writes. That is to say, people who are encouraging, positive, curious, and helpful.\n\n4. A single stream of income\n\nMany of us rely on one job to make money, but that's not how future millionaires operate.\n\nSixty-five percent of the rich people in Corley's study had at least three different streams of income set up prior to making their first $1 million. This not only supercharges earning potential, it acts as a safety net against job loss.\n\n\"Poor people have one income stream. Their eggs are all in one basket,\" Corley writes.\n\n5. Engaging in negative self talk\n\n\"I'm not smart or educated enough.\" \"It's not my fault.\" \"Life is a struggle.\"\n\nThese are examples of negative self-talk, Corley writes. These internal conversations fill us with doubt and act as a directive for our actions.\n\n\"When you allow negativity to rule your thoughts, you are programming your brain for failure,\" he writes. \"You'll have no chance in life at breaking out of your current financial or life circumstances. These negative thoughts will become beliefs that act like computer programs.\"\n\n6. Having no plan\n\nYou don't need resources beyond your own imagination and determination to make a plan for the future. The plan - what you want to accomplish and where you want to be in 10, 15, or 20 years - is the first step to achieving any type of success, especially financial success.\n\n\"Ninety-five percent of the poor in my study had no life plan,\" Corley writes. \"Without a blueprint, without long-term goals, we are like leaves on a fall day, floating in the air aimlessly.\"\n\n7. An unhealthy lifestyle\n\nUnhealthy lifestyle habits - like excessive drinking, unhealthy eating, and minimal exercise - don't lead to wealth, according to Corley.\n\n\"Poor health habits create detrimental luck,\" he writes. \"This is a type of luck that is a byproduct of poor habits, poor behavior, and bad decision making.\"\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "Through his interviews, Thomas C.
