I thought it would have been easier than dealing with the bullies.\u201d\n\nIn support of the campaign, Andre revealed on video that he was seen as an \u201coutcast\u201d when he moved to Australia and was labelled a \u201cw**\u201d even by his teachers.\n\n\u201cI remember these kids tied me up to a fence and took turns throwing stones at me trying to see who was going to hit me in the head. They were laughing and calling me a \u2018greasy w**\u2019, it was horrific. I was really scared, I was petrified,\u201d Andre said.\n\n\u201cBullying is a horrible thing. It really is horrible.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, a major new study conducted by child and adolescent mental health charity YoungMinds highlighted the \u201chuge gaps\u201d that exist within early support for young people who are experiencing mental health problems.\n\nIn August, the charity surveyed more than 7,000 people across the UK, all of whom were under 25 and had previously attempted to search for mental health support.\n\nAccording to the researchers\u2019 findings, more than two-thirds of the respondents said that they were unable to find mental health support when they were first in need of it.\n\nIf you are a young person in need of mental health support, you can contact the free YoungMinds Crisis Messenger service by texting YM to 85258 or contact Childline by calling 0800 1111 for free.\n\nIf you are an adult in need of mental health support, you can contact the free Samaritans helpline on 116 123.", "description": "Almost one in five children have contemplated suicide because of bullying at school, a new study has revealed.", "authors": ["Sarah Young"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/13/16/boy-sad-depressed.jpg"}
