The panel has demanded that Mr. Maguire bring with him a copy of it. Now, lawmakers also want a decision by Mr. Pompeo \u2014 and by extension, Mr. Trump \u2014 by that day on whether he will furnish a transcript of the presidential conversation, as well as other materials they have requested.\n\nMindful that Democrats may have only a brief window to decide their course, Speaker Nancy Pelosi summoned the leaders of six House committees involved in investigations of the president to meet on Tuesday, telling the lawmakers to come without aides. Afterward, she planned to convene a special meeting of the Democratic caucus to discuss impeachment.\n\nTheir decisions could have grave implications for Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nA growing number of House Democrats \u2014 including some previously reluctant to back impeachment \u2014 said on Monday that the new revelations all but demanded the move. They warned that a decision by the Trump administration not to hand over documents about a matter of urgent national security would leave the House with no choice but to initiate full-bore impeachment proceedings. At the same time, they said, any material that corroborated news reports about Mr. Trump\u2019s actions could lead to the same outcome.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that the sitting president of the United States placed his own personal interests above the national security interests of the United States,\u201d said Representative Angie Craig of Minnesota, who flipped a Republican seat last fall. She called for impeachment proceedings to begin \u201cimmediately, fairly and impartially.\u201d\n\nMs. Craig did not act alone. Her announcement came alongside that of another Minnesota freshman, Dean Phillips, who warned, \u201cIf the reports are corroborated, we must pursue articles of impeachment and report them to the full House of Representatives for immediate consideration.\u201d Other, more veteran lawmakers, issued similar statements.", "description": "The president denied accusations that he withheld security aid from Ukraine in an attempt to force it to investigate a political rival.", "authors": ["Nicholas Fandos", "Michael Crowley"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/23/us/politics/23dc-prexy1-promo/23dc-prexy1-promo-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
