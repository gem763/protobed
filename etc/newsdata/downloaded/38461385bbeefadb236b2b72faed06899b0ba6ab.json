Photo: Tim Mosenfelder/Getty Images\n\nCharlotte rhymer DaBaby\u2019s breakout hit \u201cSuge\u201d is like a tiny Hadron Collider, all light-speed bars racing through claustrophobic space. It shouldn\u2019t work; like those skeletal middle aughts Neptunes tracks, it seems like assembly was achieved with pieces missing. The rapper keeps time, filling out spaces in the drum programming. Capable rhymers ride the beat, locking into cadences that play off patterns laid out by a producer. But Baby\u2019s the bucking bronco in \u201cSuge.\u201d It\u2019s more like the beat is riding him. He\u2019s off to the races in the first six seconds; you\u2019re lost if you even blink. This is true of the star-making string of guest appearances that has rocketed the artist, born Jonathan Kirk, to the top of his class. He stole the show on Post Malone\u2019s album, eclipsed Chance on his own song, and matched North Carolina big dog J. Cole for bars on Revenge of the Dreamers III. This year\u2019s XXL Freshman cypher gave him two whole minutes to show out. Coronations like these occur every year or so in hip-hop. (See also: Megan Thee Stallion\u2019s breakout year.) A single catches, and a tipping point happens. Suddenly, a local talent is a national one.\n\nWhat happens next is always fascinating: Either the artist surrenders to the expectations of the audience and gloms onto the network of producers, singers, engineers, and fellow rappers needed to make the next record most likely to succeed, or the artist attempts to scale the sound of the early mixtapes to work at radio. There\u2019s albums like Travis Scott\u2019s Rodeo-Birds-Astroworld trilogy, where the objective is serving every possible demographic, and there\u2019s albums like the Migos\u2019 Culture, a short, smart distillation of the hypnotic simplicity that made the trio\u2019s early tapes great. There\u2019s Cardi B crushing killer trap tunes on Invasion of Privacy, and there\u2019s Tekashi 6ix9ine lost among the wan hooks and megawatt guest spots on his own debut Dummy Boy. On KIRK, DaBaby\u2019s second album this year after March\u2019s gold-certified Baby on Baby, he mostly sticks to the fleet, two-minute fight songs that made him popular, but the collaborations in the album\u2019s midsection point to an interest in growing out of his signature sound.\n\nThe Kevin Gates team-up \u201cPop Star\u201d stresses these concerns out loud: \u201cThey\u2019ll prolly tell you I went pop / Until a n**** play with me and he get popped.\u201d DaBaby is on the cusp of his first No. 1 album in the country, but he wants us know he still loves to fight. (The sooner the chaotic energy around him cools, the better.) This kind of thing is KIRK\u2019s bread and butter, these impossibly fast punchline raps about capers DaBaby plans to pull on you and your girlfriend. In \u201cBop,\u201d he\u2019s weighing options for major label deals while kicking dudes out of the club for asking for pictures. \u201cThere He Go\u201d is your textbook \u201cBack then they didn\u2019t want me\u201d rap, spiced with snark for label executives sniffing around rappers because their daughters like the guys making the music. Passive-aggressive bars like these only work if your form is on point. At his best, DaBaby mixes the side-splitting rudeness of early Ludacris, the playful-but-still-imposing image of Busta Rhymes, and the melodic sensibilities of Kevin Gates. (Baby is more of a chameleon than his signature flow might suggest; he nails Gates\u2019s gruff melodic phrasings on \u201cPop Star,\u201d gets thoughtful trading lines with Chance on \u201cGospel,\u201d and ramps up jokes and triplet flows with the Migos on \u201cRaw Shit.\u201d)\n\nIn cuts like \u201cBop\u201d and \u201cOff the Rip,\u201d KIRK paints DaBaby out to be the kind of rude but powerful asshole superhero you might see in a series like The Boys, but there\u2019s more to the record and the artist than that. The album\u2019s dedicated to the rapper\u2019s father, who passed away in spring, as painstakingly recounted in \u201cIntro\u201d: \u201cThinking \u2018bout my grandmama and shit / I got the No. 1 record, they acknowledged the jit / They going crazy when they play it, head-bobbing and shit / And I\u2019m just somewhere fucked up thinking \u2018bout my father and shit.\u201d \u201cGospel\u201d stresses out about how life changes when you come into money: \u201cI ain\u2019t had time to think, I ain\u2019t had time to breathe / I\u2019ve been praying to the Lord, I\u2019ve been talking on my knees / I been thinking \u2018bout my pops, I been thinking about my opps.\u201d In \u201cXXL,\u201d which revisits the verse from the freshman list freestyle series, Baby boasts about simple pleasures like coming home to a happy family and treating them to steak dinners and beach getaways. He\u2019s got range, but he also has pet sounds.\n\n\u201cSuge\u201d producer JetsonMade\u2019s stark and menacing style gives KIRK its blueprint. His beat for \u201cBop\u201d is a dizzying loop that wheels around Baby like a Rube Goldberg machine. \u201cOff the Rip,\u201d \u201cVibez,\u201d and \u201cProlly Heard\u201d favor bass drums that revisit the blown-out speaker vibe that made \u201cSuge\u201d hit harshly next to the busier music heard alongside it on playlists and radio. DaBaby is developing a sound that\u2019s identifiable but not yet limiting. Rap fan chatter\u2019s harsh but mostly good spirited: one listener said the beats \u201csound like when fat villains be tiptoeing in cartoons,\u201d and last week, Miami New Times motioned in earnest to call this music \u201cfart rap.\u201d KIRK works at branching out by adding players like London on da Track and Kenny Beats to the expected array of grimy beats by JetsonMade and Sean da Firzt. Paradoxically, it\u2019s on cuts like the \u201cRaw Shit\u201d and \u201cReally,\u201d return trips to the minimalist smirk of \u201cSuge,\u201d that he seems to be having the most fun. Thing is, the songs about sex and fighting start to run together after a while; a 35-minute album shouldn\u2019t have room for filler. You wonder what DaBaby might accomplish if the hard, introspective honesty of \u201cIntro\u201d was the rule rather than the exception. Until then, these punchlines will do.", "description": "\u2019KIRK paints DaBaby out to be the kind of rude but powerful asshole superhero you might see in a series like \u2018The Boys,\u2019 but there\u2019s more to the record and the artist than that.", "authors": ["Craig Jenkins"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/30/30-dababy.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
