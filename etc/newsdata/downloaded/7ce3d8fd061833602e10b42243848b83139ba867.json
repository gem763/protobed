Who to have children with", "language": "en", "text": "The past few years have been tough for Miriam Gonz\u00e1lez Dur\u00e1ntez, otherwise known as Lady Clegg, though she hates to be called that.\n\nFirst, her husband, Sir Nick, lost his job as deputy prime minister when his Lib Dems were virtually wiped out in the 2015 election. The following year, both were horrified by the Brexit referendum result; then, in 2017, Nick lost his seat of Sheffield Hallam.\n\nBut all that fell into insignificance because, by then, the couple\u2019s eldest son Antonio, now 17 (he has two brothers, Alberto, 15, and Miguel, ten), had been diagnosed with lymphoma, a cancer of the white blood cells that needed to be fought with endless, gruelling rounds of chemotherapy.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s well now,\u2019 beams Miriam, 51, with her fruity Spanish accent. \u2018But yes, it was a tough time.\n\nMiriam Gonzalez Durantez, 51, who is the wife of former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg (pictured together) reflected on balancing a career with family life\n\n\u2018But, to me, the biggest surprise is how you can go through these times, not only through your child\u2019s illness, but also the deaths of people you love, these big things, and in the moment you think: \u201cI know now what is and isn\u2019t important, I will never worry about those little things again.\u201d\n\n\u2018But then life goes on, and routine and the same old dynamics take over and you find yourself getting upset about the traffic or something silly. I think we do it just to survive. It\u2019s a human being\u2019s coping mechanism; it\u2019s healthy.\u2019\n\nAntonio is now in the clear, but Miriam always refused to be haunted by the prospect of his cancer returning. \u2018You should not live with an illness you no longer have, just because you might have it,\u2019 she says firmly.\n\nCertainly, the Clegg family now seem to have bounced back from their anni horribili. At the beginning of the year, they moved to California to start afresh, with Nick taking on the hugely lucrative job of vice president of Global Affairs at Facebook.\n\nNow, the family is living in a \u00a37 million house with a pool and hot tub in Atherton, the most expensive postcode in the U.S. \u2018The boys are enjoying it,\u2019 Miriam says. \u2018For them, it\u2019s an adventure. For me, as well.\u2019\n\nThe impression I have is that Miriam is thriving, thousands of miles away from the memories of so much personal and professional upheaval.\n\nDespite the change in circumstances, she\u2019s working as hard as ever for an international law firm, and says she wants to scream when \u2014 now her husband is finally the breadwinner (when he was in government she earned approximately five times more than him) \u2014 people constantly ask why.\n\nAfter years of upheaval, Miriam (pictured) and Nick Clegg are now living in a \u00a37m house with pool and hot tub in the U.S\n\n\u2018When that was the case, nobody ever asked him that question,\u2019 she says. Nor does it mean that she hasn\u2019t been tracking our Brexit rollercoaster intently. \u2018I follow it very closely \u2014 I cannot help it, it really matters to me. I always think it must be wonderful to live without being engaged in the world, but it\u2019s not the way I am.\u2019\n\nShe rolls her eyes at the mention of Boris Johnson, whom she\u2019s known since he was a young reporter in Brussels, where she and Nick were working for the European Commission.\n\nWere they ever friends? \u2018No,\u2019 she says bluntly. \u2018I\u2019ve given up on understanding Boris. God knows what he is planning to do.\u2019\n\nShe\u2019s even more dismissive of her husband\u2019s former colleague David Cameron. Has she read his new autobiography? \u2018No.\u2019 Does she want to? \u2018It seems very big and we have too much on,\u2019 she says with one of her trademark dazzling smiles.\n\nWell, that\u2019s true. We meet during Miriam\u2019s whistlestop visit to London, for the global summit of Inspiring Girls, her charity which aims to expand the ambitions of girls aged ten to 15 in 14 countries ranging from Brazil to the UK, with a new video hub containing interviews with women from a wide cross-section of careers.\n\nMiriam has known Boris Johnson (pictured with Nick) since he was a young reporter in Brussels, she claims to have given up on understanding him\n\n\u2018We started with women going into schools to talk to classes of girls, but now if they can\u2019t physically come in, they can still talk to them either live or pre-recorded using technology. So you could be talking to girls in Kenya who want to know about journalism. Why should we look at geographical boundaries?\u2019 she says.\n\nMiriam certainly managed to garner a dazzling array of women to the launch of this new initiative, including Radio 4\u2019s Mishal Husain, historian Mary Beard and, via video link, former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg.\n\nBut the inescapable fact is the charity would never have got off the ground had Miriam not been married to a political bigwig. She admits she levered the situation to her advantage and that the original idea was inspired by the surprised way people reacted to her as the full-time working wife of a party leader.\n\nOn Boris Were they ever friends? \u2018No. I\u2019ve given up on understanding Boris.\u2019\n\n\u2018People had categorised me as the \u201cprofessional wife\u201d,\u2019 she says with a flash of scorn in her dark eyes. \u2018And they kept asking me, \u201cDo you think that there are enough female role models?\u201d and I\u2019d say what a weird question, because I knew thousands of amazing women.\u2019\n\nBut then she saw research from the Girl Guides saying that 55 per cent of girls felt they lacked role models. \u2018I had a bit of public exposure so I thought, \u201cWell, this is something we can harness.\u201d\u2019\n\nYou certainly couldn\u2019t ask for a more impressive role model than the tall and glamorous Miriam, the daughter of two school teachers from the small Spanish town of Olmedo who became a high-powered trade lawyer.\n\nIn a blue dress and pink stilettos (\u2018they\u2019re not for walking in, I have other shoes in my bag for that\u2019), it\u2019s obvious why Nick recalled being \u2018bewitched the first time I saw her\u2019 in Belgium, where both were students. \u2018I didn\u2019t speak English and Nick didn\u2019t speak Spanish, so we started our relationship in French,\u2019 chuckles Miriam, who comes across as much less soppy than her husband. \u2018We still don\u2019t know what we told each other!\u2019\n\nMiriam (pictured with Nick) says she refused to move the family from their home in Putney when Nick was government, because she wanted to maintain as normal life as possible\n\nAs Nick climbed the greasy political pole, she caused shockwaves with her insistence that (though they had a nanny) he still shared the school run, saying that men who did childcare had \u2018more cojones\u2019 than \u2018dinosaurs\u2019 who refused.\n\n\u2018It was always very clear to us that ours was a very equal relationship,\u2019 she says. \u2018For me, the most important career decision you make is who you have children with, so make sure it\u2019s someone who thinks you\u2019re not second rate.\u2019\n\nHow do you choose such a paragon? \u2018I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a conscious decision: I think you know if respect is there from the very beginning.\u2019\n\nA new book, Couples Who Work, advises those in relationships where both have jobs actually to draw up contracts on how to make their lives function smoothly.\n\nOn Cameron Has she read his book? \u2018No. It seems very big and we have too much on\u2019\n\n\u2018It\u2019s never occurred to me to do that, but probably because I\u2019m a lawyer, I\u2019d have all the advantages with a contract,\u2019 she jokes.The Cleggs take a more ad hoc approach to sharing the domestic burden. \u2018We don\u2019t wake up every morning and go through the list of \u201cThis is how you can be a good feminist.\u201d It\u2019s more about the values you have as a family.\u2019\n\nWhen Nick was in government, Miriam further ruffled feathers by refusing to move the family from their home in Putney, South West London to official accommodation in Westminster.\n\n\u2018That was about trying to maintain as normal a life as possible and it was one of the best decisions we ever took,\u2019 she says. \u2018Politics isolates you a lot at that level, and I think staying in a place surrounded by your friends, your neighbours, grounds you. It was good for the children; it\u2019s healthy for politicians, too.\u2019\n\nMiriam believes having had female prime ministers has helped to change the culture surrounding the role of politicians' partners\n\nMiriam also refused to sit on the stage gazing dewy-eyed at Nick during party conferences, calling such behaviour a \u2018tiny humiliation.\u2019\n\n\u2018Every culture comes with baggage and it\u2019s hard to dismantle that. In Spain, the partners of politicians don\u2019t play a role at all,\u2019 she explains. \u2018But I do think that culture here is changing now anyway, partly because we\u2019ve had a female prime minister and the male partners don\u2019t do those things like coming onto the podium and kissing them, so there\u2019s less of that and I think it\u2019s a thoroughly good thing.\u2019\n\nShe consistently set herself apart from Samantha Cameron, sharply responding when asked why, unlike her Tory counterpart, she wasn\u2019t quitting work to join Nick on the election campaign trail: \u2018I don\u2019t have the luxury of a job I can abandon for five weeks.\u2019\n\nShe refused to socialise with the Conservatives and expressed disdain for Samantha\u2019s menu at a get-to-know-you dinner of deli roast chicken with a jar of Hellmann\u2019s mayonnaise.\n\nWhen the Camerons came to dinner at the Cleggs, Miriam reciprocated by serving a sea bass, filled with fiddly bones. Was she trying to choke them? \u2018No, it wasn\u2019t intentional. It was a funny thing. I was very proud of that sea bass,\u2019 she sighs.\n\nFood is hugely important to Miriam, to the point where alongside the mega job and family duties, she also writes a cookery blog, mumandsons.com. (She\u2019s said Nick is \u2018an appalling cook\u2019.)\n\nMiriam (pictured) admits she struggled when she began speaking to big audiences because she's not a native English speaker\n\nThe blog started as a project with the boys. Do they still cook with her? \u2018Less now,\u2019 she admits. \u2018But everybody needs to learn to do basic stuff like cooking, to take care of themselves.\u2019\n\nPeople are often surprised that a mother of boys is dedicating so much time to girls\u2019 empowerment. \u2018But I want my children to be in a place where girls are not thinking they are a little bit less than boys and can\u2019t do certain professions,\u2019 she exclaims.\n\nOn equality Nick and I don\u2019t wake up every day and go through how you can be a good feminist\n\nHer feminism has its roots in her Spanish childhood during the dying days of Franco\u2019s regime.\n\n\u2018Then, women didn\u2019t have a current account in my country, they couldn\u2019t have a business, they couldn\u2019t travel without the permission of the husband. When my mother became a teacher, people suggested she was diminishing my father by working.\u2019\n\nYou can definitely see the formidable Miriam inspiring girls, but it\u2019s hard to imagine her ever suffering from the impostor syndrome, which she says hinders so many young women.\n\n\u2018Oh yeah, I definitely have those moments of lacking confidence,\u2019 she says. \u2018For example I\u2019m not a native English speaker and that was hard for me when I started speaking to big audiences.\u2019\n\nIf any more demons haunt Miriam, she\u2019s not saying. After all, she always advises girls to \u2018fake self-confidence, until you\u2019ve done something twice.\n\n\u2018Because, after the second time, you realise, OK you can do this.\n\n\u2018The third time you realise that not only can you do it, but if you make a mistake it\u2019s not the end of the world. There is always a way to come back from failure.\u2019\n\nGreat advice for girls of any age \u2014 and even better for Sir Nick, formerly of Westminster, now of Facebook.", "description": "Lawyer Miriam Gonzalez Durantez, 51, is the wife of former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg.
