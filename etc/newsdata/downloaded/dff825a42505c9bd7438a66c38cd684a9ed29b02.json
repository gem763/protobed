We have a government in turmoil, a country in crisis, domestic violence incidents are on the rise and a convicted domestic abuser has been awarded a knighthood. It\u2019s a confusing time, especially for women.\n\nThe announcement that ex-cricketer Geoffrey Boycott would be knighted in Theresa May\u2019s resignation honours list has been widely condemned. In 1998, Boycott was convicted in a French court of pinning down his then-girlfriend, Margaret Moore, and punching her repeatedly in the face. Despite repeated denials, Boycott was ordered to pay a \u00a35,000 fine and given a three-month suspended sentence.\n\nAdina Claire, co-acting chief executive of Women\u2019s Aid described the knighthood as \u201cextremely disappointing\u201d. But when Radio 4\u2019s Martha Kearney put Claire\u2019s comments to Boycott, his condescending response \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t give a toss about her, love\u201d \u2013 merely reinforced the misogyny.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nTheresa May\u2019s landmark domestic abuse bill this year set out to protect victims from further trauma and implement strategies to protect and support women and children fleeing abuse. The bill is badly needed: this week it was announced that there were 173 domestic violence related murders in 2018 \u2013 the highest level since the BBC began collating data from police forces five years ago. Three quarters of these victims were women, and the perpetrators were predominantly men. For many, these numbers are seen as evidence that austerity and the cuts to women\u2019s services, including abuse refuges, are killing women.\n\nDespite it being 101 years since women fought for and won the vote, we are still infantilised, silenced, shut down and locked out. And we don\u2019t need to look further than our elected leaders.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 14 women using social media to change the world Show all 14 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

What followed was a viral social media campaign, #1000blackgirlbooks, calling for titles featuring black girls as protagonists to be donated. Nearly 4,000 books were donated, and Dias now tackles prejudice and advocates for diversity in literature. Getty 2/14 Rina Sawayama @rinasonline Rina Sawayama came in a blaze of neon and sci-fi coolness in early 2016 when she released the single 'Where U Are', which explored how humans interact with digital media. Since then, the singer and model from north London has been a trailblazer for intersectional feminism. Whether it\u2019s singing about her experiences as a pansexual woman or starting Twitter conversations about cultural appropriation in the media, Sawayama has taken both the music world and social media by storm with her politically vibrant work. A quick look at her Instagram account (@rinasonline) will reveal a confident woman who is not afraid to voice her opinions to her 141,000 followers. Getty 3/14 Chidera Eggerue @theslumflower At only 24 years old, Eggerue came to prominence with her viral 2017 social media campaign #SaggyBoobsMatter. 'It was only small-boobed women who were \u2018allowed\u2019 to not wear a bra,' the author said in an interview with The Guardian. \u201cI couldn\u2019t understand why \u2026 I had to challenge it.\u201d Her decision to not wear a bra shouldn\u2019t be deemed radical, yet here she is in 2019 challenging the ideas that women are pressured to confirming too. Women of all ages and shapes use the hashtag to show pride in themselves, as a result of the body positivity Eggerue championed. Her blog, The Slumflower, also discusses sexism, feminism and racism. Getty Images 4/14 Scarlett Curtis @scarcurtis You may know her as the writer who exposed Philip Green\u2019s willingness to profit off feminism but reject the idea of having a pink pop-up stall in Topshop back in October 2018. However, Scarlett Curtis is a trail-blazing feminist in other ways too. The author of Feminists Don\u2019t Wear Pink & Other Lies co-founded The Pink Protest \u2013 a collective helping young feminist activist to take action online \u2013 in 2017, all while using her social media to challenge misogyny whenever she encounters it. Getty 5/14 Tarana Burke @TaranaBurke Also known as the mother of the #MeToo movement, Tarana Burke is an American social activist who is largely responsible for the international movement against sexual harassment that went viral in October 2017. The phrase was first used in 2006 on Burke\u2019s Myspace account after she responded to a 13-year-old girl who had been sexually assaulted. The hashtag gained traction after actress Alyssa Milano encouraged victims of harassment to tweet the phrase. The call-out followed sexual abuse allegations against disgraced film producter Harvey Weinstein and has been used at least 19 million times on social media. Burke is a life-long activist for victims of sexual assault and harassment and continues to campaign such issues on social media. She has single-handedly changed the conversation on sexual violence. Getty 6/14 Sophie Sandberg @catcallsofnyc Tired of being unable to walk down the street without being constantly catcalled by men, activist Sophie Sandberg took to Instagram to expose an epidemic rife in society. Armed with multi-coloured chalk, she began documenting the horrific words that had been said to her all over New York in late 2016. Talking to the BBC about the project she stated: 'By writing [catcalls] in the same place that it happened, I hope the words may remember and think \"Oh those were my words\".' Women around the globe have been inspired by Sandberg\u2019s work and Instagram accounts of women chalking messages have since sprung up from Columbia to Bangladesh. Sophie Sandberg 7/14 Hannah Witton @hannahwitton Hannah Witton is a sex-positive YouTuber and author who has vlogged candidly about sexual health, relationships and women\u2019s issues since 2011. Over the years, the Mancunian has amassed over 500,000 subscribers. Witton is inspirationally confident and isn\u2019t afraid of talking about her sex life to her thousands of subscribers in videos such as 'How Many People Have I Slept With?' and 'The Benefits of Porn'. The vlogger is also a champion for body positivity (her most viewed video with over 8 million views is about the struggles of large boobs) and invisible illnesses \u2013 as she herself suffers from ulcerative colitis and proudly wears a stoma. Getty 8/14 Adwoa Aboah @adwoaaboah British model Adwoa Aboah is no stranger to the crippling effect of depression having suffered from it herself. This is why the star established the mental health community Gurls Talk. It began in 2015 with an Instagram account and now serves as a place to discuss topics affecting women without any fear of judgement. It has since grown into a weekly podcast and a series of organised events that have brought women together from across the globe. Talking to the BBC about the project, Aboah noted: 'At school there still isn\u2019t a place for girls and boys to realise they\u2019re not alone \u2026There is a light at the end of the tunnel. I promise that.' Getty 9/14 Laci Green @gogreen18 YouTuber Laci Green has been educating her subscribers on the nuances of sex education for over 10 years and has amassed over 1.4 million subscribers. The vlogger's videos, which are prominent in the sex-positive movement due to their candour, cover topics such as birth control, hormones and abortion in an attempt to remove the stigma surrounding them. Green is also very outspoken against slut-shaming and sexual harassment, being one of the first YouTubers to address the sexual harassment claims levied against vlogger Sam Pepper in 2014. Getty 10/14 Ash Sarkar @AyoCaesar From describing broadcaster Piers Morgan an 'idiot' to declaring herself a communist on Good Morning Britain, Ash Sarkar is a dynamic journalist making waves on the internet and TV. The north London native champions the rights of women and immigrants on social media, with a Twitter account that is rife with political commentary with a humorous edge. Meanwhile, her Instagram showcases all her campaigning work including protests on climate change and Brexit. Sarkar is also a senior editor at Novara Media \u2013 an independent, radical left-wing news organisation. Ash Sarkar 11/14 Gina Martin @ginamartin Writer and activist Gina Martin hit national headlines when she began a viral campaign to make 'upskirting' illegal. Taking to Facebook, Martin explained how a man took photos of her crotch without her permission and got away with it in a post that subsequently went viral in 2017. She then launched a petition for her case to be reopened and for the action to be made part of the 2003 Sexual Offences Act. Using the hashtag, #StopSkirtingTheIssue, the petition managed to get over 100,000 signatures. As of 2019, 'upskirting' is now illegal and this is largely down to the efforts of Martin. The activist continues to promote feminist causes to her 40,000 Instagram followers. AFP 12/14 Rowan Blanchard @rowanblanchard When Rowan Blanchard isn\u2019t taking over the world of acting, she\u2019s taking to Twitter and Instagram to talk to her 5.1 million followers about various activist pursuits. The 17-year-old uses her platform to discuss social and economic issues, with topics as diverse as human rights and gun control, and isn\u2019t afraid to give a voice to those who haven\u2019t been heard. Blanchard was very vocal in the aftermath of the Stoneman Douglas shootings earlier this year, talking with activists and highlighting their plight on social media. Getty 13/14 Liv Little @livlittle As the founder of Gal-dem, a magazine produced by women of colour, Liv Little has gained international recognition for her work in diversifying print media. After becoming frustrated with the lack of representation at Bristol University where Little attended, the 25-year-old created the publication in an attempt to give women of colour a voice in the media. Her business is growing rapidly, alongside Gal-dem\u2019s social media following which stands at more than 111,000. Little can be found on Twitter talking about everything from activism to literature. Getty 14/14 Kat Blaque @kat_blaque Blaque is a transgender activist who forged her career calling out racism, transphobia and white privilege on her successful YouTube channel of the same name.

In the US, Donald Trump was elected president amid a string of sexual assault accusations, and his referring to women as \u201cugly dogs\u201d and \u201cdisgusting\u201d.\n\nSexist language pervades the political classes and trickles down to our streets, our playgrounds and bedrooms. And as misogyny is legitimised by those in power, crimes against women are on the rise. In 2016, the Nottingham Police force became the first in the UK to categorise crimes against women as hate crimes. Research carried out with the Nottingham Women\u2019s Centre found that over 93 per cent of participants experienced behaviour defined as misogyny. Of hate crimes reported last year, more than half were due to gender.\n\nWith men such as Johnson and Trump representing countries on a global stage, is it any wonder that misogyny is a pandemic? Crimes against women are symptomatic of a culture that disbelieves the value of women and their basic human rights. Those politicians educated in the privileged, cloistered world of upper-class, single-sex schools, are the poster children of male chauvinism.\n\nAccording to the United Nations Information Centre women\u2019s empowerment is synonymous with economic growth and political stability, so is misogyny in politics to blame for our current shaken democratic state? The number of female MPs is rising, but women still account for less than 30 per cent of parliament. As of this summer, the number of women in the cabinet has dropped to its lowest level since 2014. It\u2019s difficult to confront and tackle derogatory views when women are not in the room, never mind at the table.\n\nIn the face of increased gender-based violence and widening inequality, it is imperative that we hold those in positions of power and influence to account. Unfortunately, with men still ruling power institutionally, we look to them to quite literally have our backs, to uphold the laws already in place and provide support for victims. Not knighting abusers. Not using feminine pronouns as derogatory insults thrown across party lines.\n\nIn December 2018, the role of domestic abuse commissioner was advertised. Ten months later, the job remains unfulfilled.\n\nIt is time we held men in power to account and stop the language of misogyny. We need to stop the lauding of abusers.\n\nIn short, we should give a toss, love.", "description": "The year is 2019.
