REUTERS/Murad Sezer/File Photo\n\nTurkey announced on Thursday that it had sent an oil-and-gas drilling ship to waters off southern Cyprus where Greek Cypriot authorities have already awarded hydrocarbon exploration rights to Italian and French companies.\n\nAnkara, defiant of growing European criticism, said the drill ship would launch new operations next week even as a British diplomat said that Britain \u201cdeplored\u201d any drilling in waters close to the island.\n\nThe two sides have been shadow-boxing over offshore rights for years, but the simmering dispute between countries that have spurned diplomatic relations has moved closer to boiling over.\n\nTurkey says some of the areas where Cyprus is exploring are either on its own continental shelf or in zones where Turkish Cypriots have equal rights over any finds with Greek Cypriots.\n\nTurkey has already drilled two wells in waters to the east and west of the island, triggering strong protests from Nicosia and the European Union in recent months, including EU sanctions.\n\nBut the latest development is the first time the two sides have zoomed in on the same area.\n\nIn a strongly worded statement on Friday, the Cypriot presidency accused Turkey of \u201cbullying tactics of an era long gone\u201d and called on Turkey to withdraw from the area.\n\n\u201cThis new provocation is exemplary of Turkey\u2019s defiance of the European Union\u2019s, and the international community\u2019s, repeated calls to cease its illegal activities,\u201d it said.\n\nThe statement also urged Turkey to respect the sovereign rights of the Republic of Cyprus to explore and exploit its natural resources within its maritime zones.\n\nIt said the move was more proof of \u201cthe utterly provocative and aggressive behavior of Ankara, which has chosen to speedily and irreversibly depart from international legality, thus putting security and stability in the Eastern Mediterranean at risk\u201d.\n\nCOMPETING CLAIMS\n\nOn Friday morning the drill ship Yavuz had stopped about 51 nautical miles southwest of Cyprus.\n\nA Turkish diplomat said on Twitter that the Yavuz would start a new round of drilling operations south of Cyprus on Oct. 7, adding that this would be within Turkey\u2019s continental shelf.\n\n\u201cThe drilling area lies within the Turkish continental shelf registered with the United Nations and in the permit licences that the (government) granted to Turkish Petroleum,\u201d said Cagatay Erciyes, head of the foreign ministry\u2019s department looking into the eastern Mediterranean.\n\nErciyes said Turkey does not recognize the maritime boundary claims of the Greek Cypriots, adding that \u201cunilateral actions\u201d by Greek Cypriots violated the rights of Turkey and Turkish Cypriots.\n\n\u201cTurkey doesn\u2019t recognize the continental shelf/exclusive economic zone maritime boundary claim of the Greek Cypriots despite their efforts to portray this claim as EU waters or boundaries, which is a blatant violation of international law,\u201d he said.\n\nGreek diplomats say Athens will raise the issue during U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2019s visit to Greece on Saturday. Ankara\u2019s actions were in \u201ccomplete contravention to any concept of legality\u201d, its foreign ministry said in a statement.\n\nSpeaking in Nicosia on Friday, the British Minister of State for Europe, Christopher Pincher, said that any oil wealth should be extracted to the benefit of all Cypriots.\n\n\u201cI made it very clear that Great Britain deplores any drilling in waters close to Cyprus but supports Cyprus\u2019s right to extract oils in its exclusive economic zone,\u201d Pincher said.\n\nThe island of Cyprus was split in a Turkish invasion in 1974 triggered by a brief Greek-inspired coup.\n\nThe internationally recognized Greek Cypriot government represents Cyprus in the European Union, while a breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the north is recognized only by Ankara.", "description": "Tensions between Cyprus and Turkey over offshore drilling intensified on Friday, with Nicosia accusing Turkey of a \"severe escalation\" of violations of its sovereign rights.", "authors": ["Michele Kambas", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1436916654&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF930CL", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
