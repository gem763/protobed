REUTERS/Mark Blinch\n\nAt 09:37 a.m. (1337 GMT), the Canadian dollar CAD=D4 was trading up 0.1% at 1.3114 to the greenback, or 76.26 U.S. cents.\n\nCanadians vote on Monday to determine whether Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who swept into office four years ago as a charismatic figure promising \u201csunny ways,\u201d will remain in power after two major scandals.\n\nTrudeau\u2019s Liberals and the main opposition Conservatives led by Andrew Scheer are in a neck-and-neck race, according to opinion polls.\n\n\u201cDomestic attention is squarely on the 43rd Federal election today,\u201d Shaun Osborne, chief market strategist, at Scotiabank in Toronto, said in a note.\n\n\u201cHistorically, Federal elections do not appear to have had a significant impact on the underlying trend in the CAD and we suspect that 2019 may be little different,\u201d Osborne said.\n\n\u201cAfter some noise around the vote, we think FX players will refocus attention on the Bank of Canada policy outlook, the Fed and international backdrop pretty quickly,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Monday, trade sensitive currencies were firmer and the safe-haven greenback was slightly weaker amid fresh signs of progress in a long-awaited resolution to the U.S.-China trade war.\n\nWhite House adviser Larry Kudlow said in an interview with Fox Business that tariffs scheduled for December could be withdrawn if trade negotiations continue to go well.\n\nTrade-related tensions have been a big worry in recent months for investors who fret about its impact on global growth. Canada runs a current account deficit and is a major exporter of commodities, including oil, so its economy could benefit from a pick-up in global growth.\n\nCanadian government bond prices crept lower on Monday, with the two-year CA2YT=RR falling 3 Canadian cent to yield 1.655% and the 10-year CA10YT=RR falling 18 Canadian cents to yield 1.565%.", "description": "The Canadian dollar edged higher against its U.S. counterpart on Monday, hitting a new three-month high, as millions of Canadians cast their ballots in the country's 43rd general election.", "authors": ["Saqib Iqbal Ahmed", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443374653&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K12D-OCABS", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
