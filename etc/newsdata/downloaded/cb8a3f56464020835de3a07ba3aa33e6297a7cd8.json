However, they were chowing down very close to a lioness.\n\nThere was another vehicle from Somalisa Camp at the sighting (it can be seen in the video) and both vehicles had around four guests on safari. The wild dogs had killed a kudu and spent most of the day resting and cooling off in the pan. However, in the afternoon they were spotted by a female lion. The lioness is one of Cecil's daughters who is nursing cubs not too far from Chris pan, where the sighting took place, and she is a bit of a celebrity in Hwange National Park.\n\nREAD: This is the only place in the world where you can do a solo-walking safari\n\nWith her eyes fixed on the pack, Cecil\u2019s daughter crouched and started to stalk, and in a flash she pounced and managed to grab one of the dogs. As you can hear on the audio of the video, the Somalisa guests were in a slight state of shock, as the attack of the lioness came rather immediate and as a big surprise.\n\nThe lioness held onto the wild dog for a long time which seemed lifeless in her grip and many already believed it was already dead, as it stayed completely still. The Somalisa guests felt helpless for the captured wild dog and had almost given up hope for him. When another member of the pack approached the lioness, she sprang into action, attacking the other wild dog ferociously.\n\nWATCH: This warthog might just beat Caster after bolting from seven sneaky lions\n\nThen, to the surprise of everyone watching, the previously caught wild dog got up and was able to make his escape. The guests were very relieved at this and were amazed to see how the wild dog was able to pretend to be dead for so long.\n\nBoth wild dogs survived the attack unharmed.\n\nThis incident took place two or so weeks ago and our follow up sees that the wild dog, named 'Notch' is still alive and seemingly healthy, which is a relief as he is the alpha male of the pack, which we call the 'Kennedy pack'.The alpha female, called 'Storm' is very pregnant, so some pups are hopefully on the way as well.\n\nThis is an extremely rare sighting and Calvet himself has never seen such a scenario in over ten years as a safari guide. His advice to someone who might have this same experience one day is to \u201ckeep an eye out for the underdog and to never underestimate wild dogs!\u201d\n\nFind Your Escape by .
