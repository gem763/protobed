That\u2019s down from 11.4% the month prior, representing the lowest bidding-war rate Redfin has recorded since at least 2011.\n\nIt\u2019s a far cry from a year earlier, when 42% of Redfin-written offers faced competition. The national bidding war rate reached its all-time high in March 2018, when 59% of Redfin\u2019s offers were met with competing bids.\n\nAnd though popular housing markets like San Francisco, Los Angeles and Boston still see elevated bidding-war rates, competition is much less fierce even in those locales. Nearly a third of Redfin-made offers (31%) in San Francisco saw competition in August \u2014 but that\u2019s less than half the share that faced a bidding war a year earlier (73.5%).\n\nThe relative lack of bidding wars isn\u2019t likely to please most home sellers, as competition among offers can boost the ultimate selling price of a home.\n\nAlso see: The surprising ways foreclosures make housing-market downturns even worse\n\nThe report from Redfin RDFN, -2.31% adds to the mixed signals the housing market has been sending in recent weeks. There\u2019s been some evidence that the precipitous drop in mortgage rates throughout the summer has led to an uptick in sales activity. At the same time, affordability and inventory-related constraints persist, keeping many prospective home buyers out of the market. Recent geopolitical concerns have also represented a downer for the housing market.\n\n\u201cRecession fears have been enough to spook some would-be buyers from making the big financial commitment of a home purchase,\u201d Redfin chief economist Daryl Fairweather said in the report. Fairweather noted though that consumers could acclimate to the volatility in markets if a recession doesn\u2019t occur this fall or winter \u2014 and if they do get used to that new normal, they may begin to start taking advantage of the low rates in earnest.\n\nRedfin shares are up 3.06% over the last three months. That\u2019s in line with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.71% and the S&P 500 SPX, -1.64%, which are up 3.04% and 3.69% respectively over that same period.", "description": "A new report from Redfin found that the bidding-war rate has dropped to an eight-year low.", "authors": ["Jacob Passy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HF311_sanfra_ZG_20190307211532.jpg"}
