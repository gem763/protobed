Some of the financial disclosures that the letters took aim at had even been reviewed and approved by McKellar, the suit states.\n\nAlso Read: Trump Will 'Take a Look' at Peter Thiel's Claims Google Was 'Infiltrated' by China\n\nThe suit further says that McKellar breached multiple agreements made through her severance, which included a courtesy title and consulting agreement in exchange for her agreement not compete with, disparage, communicate with Mithril investors or companies without approval, or represent herself as a Mithril executive. In addition to the anonymous letters, McKellar began working for other V.C. companies and, in July, created her own called Anathem Ventures, according to the suit.\n\n\u201cI have not been served with a copy of the complaint, as Mithril appears to have only provided it to the media,\u201d McKellar told TheWrap in a statement. \u201cBased on the media coverage, I can state that the allegations of wrongdoing are unequivocally false, and it will be a simple matter to prove them false if it gets that far.\u201d\n\n\u201cI left Mithril earlier this year when it became clear to me that Mithril\u2019s leadership was lying to its investors and that the promises it had made were not going to be kept,\u201d she continued. \u201cUndoubtedly this is not the last of the backlash I will experience from Mithril. It\u2019s ok. My integrity is worth it.\u201d\n\nMithril is seeking more than $1 million in damages.\n\nRead original story Former \u2018Wonder Years\u2019 Star Accused of Undermining Peter Thiel\u2019s VC Fund At TheWrap", "description": "Former child actress Crystal Scripps McKellar \u2014 best known for playing Becky Slater on \u201cThe Wonder Years\u201d \u2014 has been accused of conducting a \u201cwhisper campaign\u201d to \u201cundermine\u201d Mithril Capital Management, the venture capital firm co-founded by Peter Thiel and Ajay Royan she was previously employed at.In", "authors": ["J.
