Apparently the almighty steered the \u201cJesus Is King\u201d singer toward a hefty IRS refund as part of that plan.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s using me to show off,\u201d West said. \u201cLast year I made $115 million and still ended up $35 million in debt. This year I looked up and I just got $68 million returned to me on my tax returns.\u201d\n\nWest and Corden flew on a jet with more than 100 members of the rapper\u2019s chorus. They sang material from the new album \u201cJesus Is King,\u201d plus the older tune \u201cJesus Walks.\u201d\n\nBut the flight really took off when West riffed on his life. Speaking of his five years of marriage to Kim Kardashian, he said, smiling: \u201cMarriage years are different than human. ... Every marriage year is like 100 years. It\u2019s like 500 years of marriage.\u201d\n\nCorden scoffed at West\u2019s notion that he made marriage cool again, saying \u201ceverybody\u201d thought it was cool for him to marry Kardashian.\n\n\u201cNot Kris Humphries,\u201d West shot back.\n\nIf God could fire off a rimshot, that would have been the perfect moment.\n\nFly with West and Corden above.", "description": "The \"Jesus Is King\" singer and James Corden enjoy a high-flying singalong -- and a confession.", "authors": ["General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db80bd72100001c3bad4377.png?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
