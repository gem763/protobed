She\u2019s got a lot to say. I hope you\u2019ll watch.\u201d\n\nCarlson\u2019s announcement of the booking\u2014which he nailed down last week without prior approval from his Fox News bosses or, for that matter, from their boss, Lachlan Murdoch\u2014was arguably not the bombshell that Shepard Smith\u2019s on-air resignation surely was last Friday.\n\nBut\u2014in part because Smith\u2019s sudden departure from the 3pm time-slot will require a programming adjustment, if not a shakeup, in the Fox News daytime schedule, and Kelly has been actively seeking employment optionsin recent months since NBC News Chairman Andy Lack fired her on Oct. 26, 2018 over her apparent on-air endorsement of Halloween blackface\u2014it caused more than a stir.\n\nBy most accounts, Fox News\u2019 chief executive, Suzanne Scott, was compelled to re-assure each nighttime host individually throughout the day on Tuesday that their jobs were safe and that Kelly\u2019s appearance on Carlson\u2019s show was a one-time-only event.\n\nLate Monday night in response to Carlson\u2019s promo, the network also issued this statement: \u201cMegyn Kelly\u2019s forthcoming guest appearance on Tucker Carlson Tonight was coordinated weeks ago and is a one-time occurrence. Any future programming changes we are considering do not involve her.\u201d\n\nA source familiar with Kelly\u2019s thinking told The Daily Beast that Kelly \u201chas a good relationship with Lachlan and Tucker, among others, but left Fox News for good reason and has no intention of going back.\u201d\n\nKelly\u2019s temporary return to the TV studio comes at a moment when she is once again a trending topic. The Hollywood Reporter revealed on Tuesday that she has been in talks with CBS and Viacom vice-chair Shari Redstone about the possibility of joining a new conservative television outlet that Redstone hopes to launch as a rival to Fox News.\n\n\u201c Before her abrupt career implosion at NBC last year, Kelly, who turns 49 next month, was one of the most celebrated\u2014and highest paid\u2014personalities in television news \u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Kelly will be portrayed by Charlize Theron in the upcoming film Bombshell, which dramatizes the professional demise of Ailes (portrayed by John Lithgow) after he was sued for sexual harassment by Gretchen Carlson (Nicole Kidman), and Kelly, then the biggest star at Fox News, sealed his fate by reporting Ailes\u2019 misconduct to Lachlan Murdoch and the outside law firm hired to investigate Gretchen Carlson\u2019s allegations.\n\nBefore her abrupt career implosion at NBC last year, Kelly, who turns 49 next month, was one of the most celebrated\u2014and highest paid\u2014personalities in television news.\n\nBut after Lack lured her to NBC News from Fox for a three-year contract reportedly worth $69 million\u2014to helm the third hour of the Today show\u2014Kelly\u2019s ratings never measured up to the hype, and the \u201cblack face\u201d scandal capped a series of missteps, and public challenges to NBC News management.\n\nMost notable was her on-air criticism of NBC for clearing its executives, including Lack and NBC News President Noah Oppenheim, for their handling of the allegations against Matt Lauer without hiring independent outside investigators.\n\nBoth an NBC News spokesperson and Kelly declined to comment Tuesday on her planned Fox News appearance.", "description": "Fox News stars Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham are reportedly irked by Megyn Kelly\u2019s Carlson show appearance, but a source says she \u201chas no intention of going back\u201d to the network.", "authors": ["Lachlan Cartwright", "Lloyd Grove", "Senior Reporter", "Editor At Large"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_675,w_1200,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571175471/191015-grove-megyn-kelly-hero_gd2esm", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
