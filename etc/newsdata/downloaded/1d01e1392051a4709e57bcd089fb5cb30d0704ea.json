But in a brief report issued late Friday afternoon, CCTV cited President Trump\u2019s move on Thursday to delay Washington\u2019s new tariffs by two weeks so that they would take effect after trade talks scheduled for early October.\n\nDepending on the amount of agricultural products exempted, China\u2019s move could be warmly welcomed by Mr. Trump. Some farmers in the United States have been hit hard by tariffs imposed by Beijing on American goods, a retaliation against the White House\u2019s mounting tariffs on Chinese goods. The 2020 presidential election is approaching, and the farming vote is critical in some of the states that supported Mr. Trump in 2016.\n\nThe move could also help China with its own problems. Food inflation has been rising as Chinese authorities battle an epidemic of swine fever, which has forced China to cull more than a million pigs. Pork is a staple of the Chinese diet.", "description": "Details were scant, but the move could help ease Chinese food prices and comes as trade talks between the two countries are set to resume next month.", "authors": ["Alexandra Stevenson"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/13/world/13chinatrade1/13chinatrade1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
