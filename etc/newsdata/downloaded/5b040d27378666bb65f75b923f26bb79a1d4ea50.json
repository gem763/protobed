What comes next is less clear.\n\nFed officials lowered borrowing costs in July and September in an effort to guard against mounting risks, including President Trump\u2019s uncertainty-inspiring trade war and a global manufacturing slowdown. They likened the moves to taking out insurance to protect the economy.\n\nWhile officials have been less direct in signaling a cut this month than they were in arguing for those earlier moves, policymakers have done little to crush investor\u2019s expectations for a quarter-point reduction at the Oct. 29-30 meeting. Many Fed watchers view that silence as a sort of confirmation, because the central bank tries to avoid surprising markets. Doing so can cause market gyrations that ultimately restrain growth.\n\nThe central question now is whether the economy will need further insulation going forward. Economic data look decent and unemployment is at a half-century low. Mr. Trump has indicated that a \u201cPhase 1\u201d trade deal with China could be signed next month, which could give businesses slightly more certainty.", "description": "The Fed is poised to lower interest rates for a third time since July.
