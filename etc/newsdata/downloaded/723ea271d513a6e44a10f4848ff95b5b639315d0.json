The man who opened fire on the crowd of marchers was beaten to death and then burned by demonstrators.\n\n\u201cAn unidentified individual was shot dead,\u201d the Haitian police said in a statement. \u201cThe angry crowd set fire to his attacker.\u201d\n\nWith their faces hidden, several plainclothes police fired in the air near the anti-government protesters.\n\nSeveral large bursts of gunfire from unidentified individuals were then heard right next to the area where protesters were marching.\n\nPrior to the protests, police officers had presented their grievances at the headquarters of the Haitian National Police.\n\n\u201cOur wages are miserable. We don\u2019t have insurance.
