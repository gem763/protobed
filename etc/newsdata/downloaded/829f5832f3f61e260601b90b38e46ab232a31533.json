The show was led by a crew of nerdy misfits, all scientists on the west coast of the United States.\n\nDuring the finale, the show's friends took one last trip together to support married couple Sheldon (Jim Parsons) and Amy (Mayim Bialik) after they won the Nobel Prize in physics. The couple waited anxiously by the phone while friends prank-called them before receiving the actual decision.\n\nHansson said he hoped the fans of the show liked this year's Nobel Prizes.\n\n\"I hope that Sheldon and Amy are not too disappointed today.\"", "description": "Life imitated art Tuesday when \"The Big Bang Theory\" \u2014 the popular U.S. television show that is \u2014 made its way into the annals of Nobel history.
