Mandatory credit Kyodo/via REUTERS\n\nThere were also 16 people missing, public broadcaster NHK said, as Typhoon Hagibis left vast swaths of low-lying land in central and eastern Japan inundated and cut power to almost half a million homes.\n\nLanding restrictions at Tokyo\u2019s Narita and Haneda airports were lifted but more than 800 flights were canceled for the day, NHK said, as were some Shinkansen bullet train services to the worst-hit areas.\n\nAuthorities lifted rain warnings for the Kanto region around Tokyo, where stores reopened and many train lines resumed operations, but they warned there was still the risk of rivers in eastern Japan overflowing and inflicting fresh damage.\n\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe convened an emergency meeting and sent the minister in charge of disaster management to the affected areas.\n\n\u201cI extend my condolences for all those who lost their lives and offer my sympathy to all those impacted by Typhoon No.19 (Hagibis),\u201d Abe said.\n\n\u201cWith respect to blackouts, water outage and suspension of transportation services, we intend to exert all-out efforts for the earliest recovery ... we ask the public to remain vigilant of landslides and other hazards,\u201d he said.\n\nSome 27,000 members of Japan\u2019s self-defense forces as well as firefighters, police and coast guard members were sent to rescue stranded people in central Japan\u2019s Nagano prefecture and elsewhere, the government said.\n\nNHK said the full extent of the widespread damage was only beginning to emerge because many areas remained under water.\n\nSome 425,000 homes were without power, the government said, reviving fears of a repeat of the weeks-long power outages suffered after another typhoon hit east of Tokyo last month.\n\nRelated Coverage Japan cancels maritime fleet review after typhoon: spokesman\n\nIn Fukushima, north of the capital, Tokyo Electric Power Co (9501.T) (Tepco) reported irregular readings from sensors monitoring water in its Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. The plant was crippled by a 2011 earthquake and tsunami.\n\nTepco spokeswoman Emi Iwasa said the typhoon triggered 11 leak alerts at the plant. Of those, eight were confirmed as being triggered by rainwater and the rest were still being investigated. Iwasa said the operator had so far not confirmed if any radioactive water leaked into sea.\n\nFLOODS, LANDSLIDES\n\nHagibis, which means \u201cspeed\u201d in the Philippine language Tagalog, made landfall on Japan\u2019s main island of Honshu on Saturday evening and headed out to sea early on Sunday, leaving behind cloudless skies and high temperatures across the country.\n\nNHK showed fields and vast residential areas in parts of central and eastern Japan covered in brown water, with some of the worst damage caused by Chikuma river in Nagano prefecture.\n\nMilitary helicopters airlifted stranded people from homes near the river, some cradling their children, after they were trapped by water reaching the roofs of their houses.\n\nIn Kawagoe, north of Tokyo, rescuers took residents from a flooded aged care facility by inflatable boats and carried them on their backs to safety. They also searched for survivors in homes destroyed in landslides near Tokyo\u2019s suburbs and in Fukushima prefecture, NHK showed.\n\nAuthorities at one point issued evacuation advisories and orders for more than 6 million people across Japan as the storm unleashed the heaviest rain and winds in years. Some 166 people were injured in the aftermath, NHK said.\n\nThe storm, which the government said could be the strongest to hit Tokyo since 1958, brought record-breaking rainfall in many areas, including the popular resort town of Hakone, which was hit with 939.5 mm (37 inches) of rain over 24 hours.\n\nJust last month, another strong storm, Typhoon Faxai, destroyed or damaged 30,000 houses in Chiba, east of Tokyo, and caused extensive power outages.\n\nSlideshow (24 Images)\n\nThe Rugby World Cup match between Namibia and Canada in Kamaishi on Sunday was canceled, although the crucial Japan-Scotland match was set to go ahead. Two matches were canceled on Saturday.\n\nFormula One Grand Prix organisers had also canceled all practice and qualifying sessions scheduled for Saturday but the race went ahead on Sunday.", "description": "Japan sent tens of thousands of troops and rescue workers on Sunday to save stranded residents and fight floods caused by one of the worst typhoons to hit the country in recent history, which killed 23 people and briefly paralyzed Tokyo.", "authors": ["Antoni Slodkowski", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191013&t=2&i=1440285918&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9C05R", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
