Read more\n\n\u201cI am afraid that Ukraine could become as toxic as Russia was during the Mueller investigation,\u201d said Alyona Getmanchuk, director of the Kyiv-based New Europe Center. \u201cWe understand that every move that Trump does in Ukraine will be seen through this scandal. Every \u2018no\u2019 to Ukraine will be seen as an act of revenge. Every \u2018yes\u2019 is a sign that he wants to prove people wrong.\u201d\n\nTrump had ordered White House staff to withhold nearly $400m in aid to Ukraine shortly before a 25 July telephone call with Zelenskiy, according to the Washington Post, in an apparent bid to put pressure on the new Ukrainian leader. Much of that aid would be directed toward military equipment and training.\n\n\u201cI think [Vladimir] Putin is now applauding what is happening,\u201d Getmanchuk added.\n\nAfter giving a speech at the United Nations general assembly on Wednesday morning, Zelenskiy made an awkward appearance with Trump before reporters.\n\nThe Ukrainian president said that he didn\u2019t want to get involved in American elections, but added: \u201cNobody pushed me.\u201d Trump chimed in: \u201cIn other words, no pressure.\u201d\n\nThe White House on Wednesday released a memorandum of the telephone call between Trump and Zelenskiy. During the call, Trump asked Zelenskiy to \u201clook into\u201d the closed investigation of Biden\u2019s son, telling him repeatedly he would put him in touch with Rudy Giuliani, a lawyer with ties to Trump and a former mayor of New York City.\n\nZelenskiy appeared eager to please Trump in the call, calling him a \u201cgreat teacher\u201d and echoing his criticisms of European leaders and the former US ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, whom Zelenskiy called a \u201cbad ambassador\u201d. Zelenskiy also assured Trump that the next Ukrainian prosecutor would be \u201c100% my person\u201d and would \u201clook into the situation\u201d surrounding Biden and the company Burisma. It is not clear whether Zelenskiy did speak with Giuliani.\n\nHe also pointedly told Trump that he had stayed at Trump Tower in New York City. Foreign delegations are thought to stay at Trump properties to curry favour with him.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, Zelenskiy had sought to clear the air with a statement saying he wanted Kyiv\u2019s relations with Washington to be \u201cawesome\u201d and that he planned to invite the US president to visit Ukraine. If Trump accepts, it would be the first visit by an American president since George W Bush in 2008.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing is that [people] speak about Ukraine, that nobody forgets about Ukraine,\u201d he said in the public remarks.\n\nPavlo Klimkin, the previous Ukrainian foreign minister, wrote with an acid sense of pride: \u201cUkraine will remain in the history of the United States as the country that led to the impeachment of the US president. Not a very fun prospect. But now everyone understands what we are capable of.\u201d\n\nQ&A How do you impeach the US president? Show Hide Article 1 of the United States constitution gives the House of Representatives the sole power to initiate impeachment and the Senate the sole power to try impeachments of the president. A president can be impeached if they are judged to have committed \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\" \u2013 although the constitution does not specify what \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d are. The process starts with the House of Representatives passing articles of impeachment. A simple majority of members need to vote in favour of impeachment for it to pass to the next stage. Democrats currently control the house, with 235 representatives. The chief justice of the US supreme court then presides over the proceedings in the Senate, where the president is tried, with senators acting as the jury. For the president to be found guilty two-thirds of senators must vote to convict. Republicans currently control the Senate, with 53 of the 100 senators. Two presidents have previously been impeached, Bill Clinton in 1998, and Andrew Johnson in 1868, though neither was removed from office as a result. Richard Nixon resigned in 1974 before there was a formal vote to impeach him. Martin Belam\n\nUkrainian diplomats and Zelenskiy himself have sought to downplay the scandal. In remarks to Russian journalists in New York on Wednesday morning, Zelenskiy denied that Trump pressured him in the 25 July call. \u201cNobody can put pressure on me because I am the president of an independent country,\u201d he said. The only person who could pressure him, he added, \u201cis my son, who is six\u201d.\n\nThat contradicted an account by Chris Murphy, a member of the US Senate foreign relations committee, who described both Zelenskiy and his administration in recent meetings as \u201cconfused\u201d about \u201cthe nature of these demands they were getting from the Trump administration \u2026 and that they worry that the aid that was being cut off to Ukraine by the president was a consequence for their unwillingness, at the time, to investigate the Bidens\u201d.\n\nA European diplomat in Kyiv called Zelenskiy\u2019s predicament a \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d where \u201cthere is almost no middle ground\u201d between Trump and the Democratic party.\n\nVolodymyr Fesenko, a political analyst, said that Zelenskiy\u2019s administration had chosen a strategy of \u201cstrict neutrality\u201d in order to avoid angering Trump or a possible Democratic administration, should Biden or another candidate win in 2020.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats or Trump could be offended, in particular Trump, by the lack of support, but it\u2019s a necessary position for Ukraine,\u201d he said.\n\nIronically, Fesenko said, the announcement of a formal impeachment inquiry could take some pressure off Zelenskiy this week, as Trump\u2019s actions were closely scrutinised by the press.\n\n\u201cTrump would have to be crazy to come out and put pressure on Zelenskiy now [about Biden],\u201d he said.", "description": "Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s country, dependent on US aid, is now caught in the middle of a Washington row", "authors": ["Andrew Roth"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a40ef0d1870f0aab932aaf71bba0df56d641110/0_144_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0f07ddcc73a6434b9cb6d6e338d10da9", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
