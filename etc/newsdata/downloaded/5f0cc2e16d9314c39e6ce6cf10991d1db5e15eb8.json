But that wasn\u2019t it.\n\nThe looks I saw on the \u00adEngland players\u2019 faces were looks I knew well. They were the same looks my team-mates and I had ahead of our Olympic final three years ago.\n\nWe had just beaten New \u00adZealand in a very physical \u00adsemi-final, which was stopped at one point so that blood could be washed off the pitch. When the final whistle blew, much like the \u00adEngland lads did, my team \u00adexchanged glances, handshakes, smiled, then retired to the changing room.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nOnce there, we sat in our usual places, packed up, and got ready for the bus. Not one person mentioned the word final, or medals, or celebrated in any way, shape or form.\n\nWe didn\u2019t congratulate each other, we merely acknowledged that we had played well and had another game to go.\n\nLooking back, I realise just how mentally focused our coach Danny Kerry and his psychology team had us.\n\nGetting to the Olympic final had been a dream all my life and I also knew I was guaranteed at least a silver medal.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nYou would think that would be a huge deal \u2013 and as for playing for a gold medal, well, the mind should boggle. But it didn\u2019t. Nowadays, few things irk me more than when a team celebrates making a final.\n\nThat\u2019s amateur hour. It\u2019s like they \u00adforget their only aim should be to win the whole thing. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s a pre-tournament long-shot either.\n\nWe were 12-1 to win the Olympics, but any good team will tell you that your \u00adexpectations and goals are fluid and constantly upgraded during a tournament.\n\nI left celebrating semi-final wins to the fans and, truth be told, if I saw an opponent \u00adcelebrating reaching a final, I often drew strength from it.\n\nPsychology in sport is so underappreciated, but not by Eddie Jones. Pre-game, he \u00adreminded his team that even the mighty All Blacks were human. They still drop passes, miss tackles, were far from insurmountable \u2013 and so it proved.\n\nPost-game, his players looked equally prepared.\n\nThe key now is to stop the players \u00adbecoming what sports psychologists term \u201coverly aroused\u201d. You have to stop them realising what they have accomplished.\n\nYou need to stop them \u00adbecoming aware of the media hype or getting wrapped up in the nation\u2019s excitement.\n\nThere is still a job to do \u2013 but I can assure you, as someone who has been there before, the England boys know they haven\u2019t won anything... yet.", "description": "SAM QUEK COLUMN: England reached the Rugby World Cup, where they'll face South Africa, by beating New Zealand", "authors": ["Sam Quek", "Image", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Getty Images", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20728770.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_RUGBYU-WC-2019-MATCH45-ENG-NZL.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
