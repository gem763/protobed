Maybe it\u2019s your first time hiring people, or maybe you\u2019ve been doing it for a while with less than stellar results. Maybe you\u2019ve had your own terrible interviewers and want to make sure you don\u2019t inflict that on someone else \u2014 or inflict bad hires on your colleagues. Here\u2019s your primer on how to be a good interviewer.\n\n1. Don\u2019t wing it.\n\nA startling number of interviewers don\u2019t prepare much for interviews. They might read a candidate\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 for the first time a few minutes before the interview, and they don\u2019t put much time into figuring out what to screen for and how to do that. Instead, they rely on informal, unstructured conversations, which lead them to make hires based more on gut feeling than on any kind of rigorous assessment.\n\nTo interview well, you\u2019ll need to put real thought into what you\u2019re looking for in a candidate and how you\u2019ll suss it out.\n\n2. Get clear on your must-have qualifications.\n\nIt might sound obvious: When you\u2019re hiring, you need to know what qualifications you\u2019re looking for. But hiring managers often don\u2019t do the serious reflection needed to distinguish the true must-have qualifications from those that are nice to have or not relevant at all. The most obvious example of this are job postings that require college degrees for work that doesn\u2019t really require a degree at all. (Does your communications manager really need a bachelor\u2019s degree? Or does she need great writing and social-media skills, along with a track record of getting stories placed?) But you see this with other things too, like interviewers who deduct points for shyness for jobs that don\u2019t require an outgoing personality, or screeners who reject people over typos for jobs that require little written communication.\n\nYou should also be thoughtful about what qualities would be hard to teach in the amount of time you have available (like critical thinking, meticulousness, or initiative) and what skills are feasible for the right person to develop (like expertise in a particular software).\n\n3. Figure out how you\u2019ll assess your must-have\u2019s.\n\nOnce you have a clear idea of the essential skills, experiences, and qualities for the job, your primary goal in an interview is to find out how well the candidate matches up with that list.\n\nThat means you need to devise interview questions that really probe the candidate about the traits and experiences you\u2019re interested in. In doing this, be sure to focus on the candidate\u2019s actual experience, rather than asking hypothetical questions. Don\u2019t ask, \u201cHow do you think you\u2019d handle X?\u201d Instead, ask how the person has actually handled X, or situations close to it, in the past. It\u2019s easy for candidates to come up with good answers to hypothetical questions about how they think they might act. You\u2019ll get much more useful insight if you instead delve into how they have actually operated.\n\n4. Ask follow-up questions.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve figured out what you want to ask candidates, you\u2019ll have a starting point for questions, but it\u2019s crucial that you don\u2019t see that list as your complete interview script. To interview well, you\u2019ll need to go beyond surface answers and explore the nitty-gritty of how a candidate thinks and operates. To do that, you\u2019re going to need to listen to what they say and ask a lot of follow-up questions based on what you hear. For example: \u201cX sounds like it would have been an obstacle \u2014 how did you approach that?\u201d \u201cWas it successful?\u201d \u201cWhat was most challenging?\u201d \u201cHow did you navigate that?\u201d \u201cWhat happened after that?\u201d \u201cWhat would you do differently if you were doing it again?\u201d\n\n5. See candidates in action.\n\nIn addition to direct questioning, it\u2019s crucial to create ways to see candidates in action during your hiring process \u2014 so that you\u2019re not relying on candidates telling you what they can do but are actually seeing them do it. You can\u2019t effectively assess candidates through interview questions alone; you also need to employ exercises and simulations so you can see candidates\u2019 real work.\n\nFor example, you might have applicants for communications positions write a press release for a fake event, or have analyst candidates research and summarize their findings about a piece of legislation, or ask prospective assistants to role-play a tricky situation. (It\u2019s important that you don\u2019t use any of this work for real; it\u2019s for assessment purposes only, unless you pay them for it.)\n\nOften in doing this, you\u2019ll find that a person with an impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and polished interviewing skills isn\u2019t as strong as they had appeared. You also might find the reverse \u2014 that a candidate is stronger than you had assumed from their r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\n6. Put people at ease.\n\nInterviews are inherently high-pressure situations, but it\u2019s in your best interest s to put candidates at ease as much as possible. You want to see what people will be like to work with day-to-day, not what they\u2019re like when they\u2019re nervous and in \u201cinterview mode.\u201d To give yourself the best chance of getting an accurate sense of candidates, you should be warm and friendly and try to lower some of the pressure.\n\n7. Don\u2019t ask silly interview questions.\n\nIf you\u2019re following the advice above, hopefully you\u2019re not going to ask oddball questions like \u201cIf you were a tree, what kind would you be?\u201d or \u201cWhat song would you sing on American Idol?\u201d But in case you\u2019re tempted, let me say in clear terms: Don\u2019t do it. These questions are irrelevant to your must-have\u2019s, and they\u2019ll irritate good candidates.\n\n8. Know that bias is a real thing \u2014 and work to combat it.\n\nAs an interviewer, you have a responsibility to actively work to combat bias in yourself and your colleagues as you assess candidates. Most of us are drawn to candidates who remind us of ourselves or whom we\u2019d feel comfortable getting a beer with, but this can blind you to people\u2019s weaknesses or to other candidates\u2019 strengths. And unsurprisingly, this is how companies end up with homogenous staffs with little diversity.\n\nBeing vigilant about assessing all candidates against the same list of must-have\u2019s can help mitigate some of the biases that creep into the interviewing process, but it\u2019s also worth doing things like taking the (free) Harvard Implicit Association Tests and learning about how bias plays out even among well-intentioned interviewers.\n\n9. Commit to truth in advertising.\n\nIt\u2019s natural to want to present your organization and the job you\u2019re hiring for in the best light, but it\u2019s crucial that candidates have a thorough and realistic understanding of what they\u2019d be signing up for: the job, the organization, the culture, the manager, and the people. Resist any temptation to downplay less appealing aspects of the job (like long hours, tedious work, or difficult clients). In fact, on the contrary, be proactive about disclosing those things. Otherwise you\u2019ll end up with a hire who feels misled \u2014 and who might not stick around.\n\n10. Realize candidates are assessing you as much as you\u2019re assessing them.\n\nSome interviewers approach interviewing as if they hold all the cards and will treat candidates in ways they\u2019d never treat, say, clients \u2014 like starting the meeting very late, checking email and taking calls throughout, or being dismissive or even hostile. But good candidates have options, and they\u2019ll be assessing you right back. They\u2019ll pay attention to things like how respectfully you treat them, whether you\u2019re focused or distracted, how interested you are in answering their questions (and whether your answers sound thoughtful or canned), whether you can clearly describe how you\u2019ll measure success in the role, and how they see you interact with colleagues during the hiring process. So, as you\u2019re deciding which candidate to choose, don\u2019t forget the candidate must choose you as well.\n\nGet Ask a Boss delivered every week Email Terms & Privacy Notice By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice and to receive email correspondence from us.\n\nOrder Alison Green\u2019s book Ask a Manager: Clueless Colleagues, Lunch-Stealing Bosses, and the Rest of Your Life at Work here.
