Dr Singh denied any wrongdoing.\n\nIn 1999 Singh took up a Senior House officer post in psychiatry at the Millbrook Mental Health Unit at Kings Mill Hospital in Nottinghamshire.\n\nIn 2012 he decided to retrain as a GP worked at Hellesdon GP Practice between February 2014 and January 2015.\n\nPatient A claimed she was molested at the Millbrook Unit in 2000 after being admitted there following a tablets overdose. She further claimed the doctor had fondled her on two other occasions - even when she brought her boyfriend along.\n\nShe claimed she would 'tell anyone who would listen' but medical records made by various clinicians and therapists Patient A saw after being examined by Dr Singh made no mention of inappropriate behaviour by him.\n\nA second woman known as Mrs C said she was molested in May 2014 after she booked in for an emergency appointment at GP's practice with her son who was suspected to have the Croup virus.\n\nShe claimed the doctor was 'manspreading' in front of her and claimed the doctor 'leaned over and his left hand swept down to her left breast as he went to pick her child up.'\n\nPatient D a healthcare assistant, claimed she was reduced to tears when Dr Singh pulled her breast out of her bra during a chest examination in January 2015 when she went for treatment for a cold.\n\nDr Ashok Singh, 53, (pictured outside the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester) said his patients may have perceived the examinations to be intimate\n\nDuring the hearing experts said it was possible Dr Singh could have inadvertently come into contact with Mrs C's breast whilst examining her son. They said he would have touched Patient D's breast when conducting a chest examination and putting the stethoscope over her nipple if the heart sounds could be heard there.\n\nWhen asked about Patient D, Dr Singh himself said: 'It's her body, it's her breast and I'm sure what she's saying is right - however my job was basically to listen to her heart sound. I was not expecting to completely undress her but to make skin to skin contact.\n\n'I have to listen to her chest and hear a sound which I'm intending to listen to. I was aiming to listen, put my stethoscope, just below her nipple so that I can have a clear listening of that and to reduce her inconvenience. The stethoscope has to be in touch with the skin.\n\n'With hindsight, however, in my view of the way I did this examination on that day, I should have considered that the patient herself might perceive the examination to be an intimate one, even if I did not.\n\n'The only thing perhaps, which will be my learning from here is that perhaps tell people that while I'm listening to your chest I might end up touching your nipple. So, they may be forewarned.'\n\nThe MPTS panel criticised Dr Singh for failing to get consent from Patient D or offering her a chaperone ahead of her examination but accepted his intentions were clinical.\n\nChairman Mr Lindsay Irving said: 'Each of the elements of the allegation found proved are interrelated and concern a single examination of a single patient on a single occasion.\n\n'He had conducted it in an inept manner but with good intent and attempted consideration for the patient's dignity in that he was trying to avoid her having to undress. The tribunal considered therefore, his failings in relation to the issue of communication, obtaining consent and offering a chaperone in the context of a well-intentioned but clumsy and rushed examination.\n\n'In all the circumstances and taking into account the legal principles set out earlier, the Tribunal concluded that this places Dr Singh's conduct at the lower end of the spectrum so as not to amount to misconduct.'", "description": "Dr Ashok Singh, who lives in the village of Eaton in Norfolk, was subjected to both criminal and disciplinary investigations during a four year battle to clear his name.", "authors": ["Terri-Ann Williams For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/09/19386854-0-image-a-40_1570438498134.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
