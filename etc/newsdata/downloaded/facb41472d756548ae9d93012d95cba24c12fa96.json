The percentage of positive responses among people with a year 11 education or lower, and rural residents - the least likely in their respective categories to support free trade - was 69 per cent or higher.\n\nThe Australian Election Study measured the level of support for a more specific statement: \"Australia's trading future lies in Asia\".\n\nIn 2016, about 62 per cent of Australians said they agreed while 10 per cent said they disagreed. The remainder chose \"not sure\", according to data prepared by University of Sydney research fellow Sarah Cameron.\n\nLike the Lowy Institute results, the AES findings were robust across class and rural-urban lines.\n\nLittle disquiet\n\nThe highest levels of disagreement with the proposition were among residents of small country towns (fewer than 10,000 people) at 11 per cent, and individuals with an income between $40,001 and $80,000 at 9 per cent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAustralian National University professor Ian McAllister, who leads the AES study, said the broad-based support for free trade stemmed from a recognition that Australia is a \"medium-ranked economy that's very dependent on trade\".\n\nHe added that the constancy of the support, which has largely held since the study began in 1993, reflected both a compulsory voting system that sidelined pro-protectionist minor parties and the country's economic prosperity.\n\n\"When things are not good in the economy, people want to draw up the drawbridge,\" Professor McAllister said.\n\nLowy Institute research fellow Natasha Kassam said part of the explanation for the level of positive sentiment may be the reliance of regional and blue-collar industries on trade, especially with China, which accounts for 30 per cent of exports.\n\n\"Regional Australia is very much engaged in trade. People who work in factories and farms talk about the importance of the Chinese market,\" she said.\n\nHowever, Ms Kassam said growing wariness over China's rise could also weigh on this enthusiasm, citing Lowy's finding that three-quarters of Australians believe the country is too economically dependent on China.\n\nProfessor McAllister said growing concerns about the security implications of some trade could feed into a broader scepticism about free trade. \"I don't think people make such a fine distinction,\" he said.", "description": "Support for free trade among Australians remains robust across income, education, and rural-urban divides, according to two long-standing opinion studies.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3922%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_517%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c40b2d3bbc41fc055645e67de79598b7e44038f2", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
