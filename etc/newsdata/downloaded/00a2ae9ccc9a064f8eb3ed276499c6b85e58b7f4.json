This time around, that will take place at January\u2019s auction in Scottsdale, Ariz., with all of the proceeds earmarked for the Detroit Children\u2019s Fund.\n\nTHE 2020 CHEVROLET CORVETTE STINGRAY CONVERTIBLE AND ITS PRICE HAVE BEEN REVEALED\n\nAnd there should be plenty of them because the last front-engine Corvette was auctioned by Barrett-Jackson in June for $2.7 million.\n\nAccording to the Detroit Free Press, that car has yet to be built due to the ongoing United Auto Workers strike, which has also delayed the start of production for the mid-engine model at the Bowling Green, Ky., factory that\u2019s been the Corvette\u2019s home since 1981.\n\nTHE 2020 CHEVROLET CORVETTE STINGRAY HAS A FEATURE THAT LETS YOU ANNOY EVERYONE\n\nWhen it does get around to building Corvette VIN 001, it will be a Stingray equipped with the Z51 performance package, according to Barrett-Jackson. The base price for that particular configuration is $64,995.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "A slight markup, but for a good cause.", "authors": ["Gary Gastelu", "Gary Gastelu Is Foxnews.Com'S Automotive Editor.
