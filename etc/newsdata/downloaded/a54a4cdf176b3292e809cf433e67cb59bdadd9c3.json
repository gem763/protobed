But she was loath to make redundant one of the most skilled groups of staff in London.\n\n\u201cMy priority was to keep the team together,\u201d she says. \u201cI knew they would be demotivated and quickly bored by not working and, at the same time, they were so highly qualified that our competitors would want to hire them.\u201d\n\nMore than 100 firefighters were called to the Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park when a fire broke out on June 6, 2018. John Stillwell/AP\n\nHyndman, a veteran GM of Mandarin Oriental hotels in Bangkok and Washington, decided to retain her staff on full pay and benefits. Some were seconded to properties overseas, but most stayed in London, where they began volunteering for charities. Over nine months, Hyndman\u2019s team donated 40,000 man-hours to local organisations, from Oxfam shops to food banks.\n\n\u201cWe received a great deal of support from the London community during the fire emergency,\u201d Hyndman says, \u201cand giving away working hours to the city was a simple way to express our gratitude. But it also strengthened the bonds within our team.\u201d\n\nIn April this year, the Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park London finally reopened, revealing at last that pricey new look by designer-du-jour Joyce Wang, who cites both legendary architect Frank Lloyd Wright and macabre filmmaker David Lynch as key influences.\n\nThe reimagined property is home to London\u2019s most expensive hotel suite (a cool \u00a342,000, or $77,000, a night), two restaurants by Michelin-starred chefs and what is arguably the city\u2019s most impressive spa.\n\nBut Hyndman reckons its real competitive advantage lies elsewhere. \u201cOur vision is to become one of the finest hotels in the world by offering kind and generous service,\u201d she declares.\n\nOf course, claims of superior service are common in the world of five-star hospitality \u2013 but Hyndman and her team have form. Their above-and-beyond mentality is chronicled in the 2017 TV series A Very British Hotel, which shows staff flying an American businesswoman\u2019s breast milk back to her baby in Boston, and displaying remarkably good cheer as they deep-clean a suite that has been trashed by Middle Eastern royalty.", "description": "A year after a blaze ripped through the Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, the reimagined hotel has risen from the ashes and is ready to impress.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3259%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_67/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e25e13373fa553aeb050424e0647eb51bc42a851", "published_at": "2019-05-14"}
