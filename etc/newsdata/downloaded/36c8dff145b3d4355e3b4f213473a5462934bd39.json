And as Robert\u2019s deceit collapses around him, leading him into an even messier situation, Michelle prepares to have her revenge.\n\nKnowing that the man who has promised to marry her is up to no good, she watches him from afar with Carla (Alison King) as they witness him rowing in the Street with Vicky, who seems to now know that he has betrayed her too.\n\nIt was clear that Robert was never going to get away with his double life forever as both Tristan and Kym are leaving the soap \u2013 and the chances of them heading off into the sunset together as a happy couple seem to be dashed as Michelle discovers what he has done.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut as she sits with Carla and digests the extent of Robert\u2019s twisted web, how will she react to him \u2013 and will she make him pay?\n\n(Picture: Paul Cousans/Zenpix)\n\nKerri recently suggested to Metro.co.uk that she would like to see Vicky and Michelle team up to bring Robert down, given that both women have been wronged by him. She said: \u2018Vicky and Michelle are both quite strong fiery women, I would be terrified if I was Robert, but I would also be really sorry for him \u2013 just come clean! Vicky\u2019s pregnant so I suppose killing each other\u2019s not really an option but we still don\u2019t know!\n\n(Picture: Paul Cousans/Zenpix Ltd)\n\n\u2018We\u2019re hearing stories but nothing set in stone, so I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to play out but I\u2019m sure they will eventually find out about each other. It would be lovely if they were to team up.\u2019\n\nShe added: \u2018I think you get the impression that Vicky\u2019s had it tough, she\u2019s been flying solo for a bit and you find that Jed left her for someone else, so I think if she has sniff of that, she would be on that and I think she\u2019d do the right thing by Michelle. That\u2019s my take. I don\u2019t think it should be that the two of them are ripping each others\u2019 heads off.\n\n\u2018I think it\u2019s more interesting to see a common ground and that would work better for my character because then you will see a different side of Vicky if she is trying to do the right thing.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJudging by Vicky\u2019s explosion of rage and the dark look in Michelle\u2019s eyes as she witnesses Robert\u2019s betrayal first hand, we think it\u2019s fair to assume that he is in for a well deserved rough ride.\n\n(Picture: Paul Cousans/Zenpix)\n\nCorrie will air these scenes in winter.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "The Corrie favourite has a shock in store.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-79-a652_1570442532.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
