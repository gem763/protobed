He added that in the previous month he had raised concerns in a staff meeting about the company's intent to resell expired pods that had been returned by a distributor.\n\nIn response, Burns allegedly said: \"Half our customers are drunk and vaping like mo-fo\u2019s, who the fuck is going to notice the quality of our pods.\"\n\nBreja alleges that he was fired on March 21 after he continued to raise concerns.\n\nA Juul spokesperson called the Breja's claims \"baseless.\"\n\n\"He was terminated in March 2019 because he failed to demonstrate the leadership qualities needed in his role,\" the spokesperson said. \"The allegations concerning safety issues with Juul products are equally meritless, and we already investigated the underlying manufacturing issue and determined the product met all applicable specifications. The company will vigorously defend this lawsuit.\"\n\nBreja claimed he was fired just \"days\" after blowing the whistle on the company's illegal activity.\n\n\"This cold and calculated act was an attempt to silence him and to set an example for other employees,\" he said in the lawsuit.\n\nBurns stepped down in September shortly after the Food and Drug Administration accused Juul of illegally marketing its products as being less harmful than cigarettes.\n\nHe was replaced with former Altria executive K.C. Crosthwaite, drawing criticism from anti-tobacco advocates who say Juul's tactics mirror those used by the tobacco industry decades ago.\n\nAltria owns a 35 percent stake in Juul.\n\nCongress and the Federal Trade Commission are also investigating Juul's marketing tactics, including whether it purposely marketed its products to minors.\n\nGovernment data shows teen vaping rates have doubled in the past two years, a worrying stat for public health advocates who warn of another generation becoming addicted to nicotine.\n\nThe Trump administration is expected to ban the sale of all flavored e-cigarette products in an effort to keep them away from kids.\n\nJuul has tried to change its public image in the last few months, suspending the sale of fruit-flavored products and ceasing advertising efforts.\n\nUpdated at 4:31 p.m.", "description": "E-cigarette company Juul knowingly\u00a0shipped 1 million \"contaminated\" pods\u00a0to retailers this year and refused to recall the products or warn consumers, a former executive claimed in a lawsuit he filed against the company this week.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/juul_062519getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
