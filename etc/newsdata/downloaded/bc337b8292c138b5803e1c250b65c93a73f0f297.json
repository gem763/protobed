Foreign ministers of the treaty\u2019s 19 member nations are due to meet later this month to decide which measures are necessary to stem the threat.\n\n\u201cIf your neighbor\u2019s house is burning down, do you stand and shout you should not intervene, or do you help your neighbor put out the fire?\u201d Carlos Trujillo, U.S. ambassador to the Organization of American States (OAS), said in a heated debate on the issue Wednesday.\n\nColombia has charged that Maduro, who announced military exercises on their shared border last week, is hosting and arming Colombian guerrillas who have threatened to reignite a terrorist campaign, including what Colombia\u2019s intelligence service contends are plans to begin bombing central sites in Bogota, the capital, according to U.S. and Latin American officials.\n\n[Maduro\u2019s ex-spy chief lands in U.S. armed with allegations against Venezuelan government]\n\nPresident Trump has expressed frustration at Maduro\u2019s staying power, eight months after the administration recognized a new, opposition-led government in Venezuela and began imposing heavy sanctions on Maduro officials and the country\u2019s oil-dominated economy. Last week, he criticized his fired national security adviser, John Bolton, who was orchestrating the policy. Mocking him as \u201cMr. Tough Guy\u201d on a variety of issues, Trump said Bolton was \u201cholding me back\u201d on Venezuela.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who has long advocated a more muscular approach to Venezuela, spoke Thursday in support of Trump\u2019s comments after what he said was a conversation with the president.\n\n\u201cIf in fact the direction of policy changes\u201d in the wake of Bolton\u2019s departure, Rubio said on Twitter, \u201cit won\u2019t be to make it weaker.\u201d\n\nAdministration officials, while acknowledging that the treaty includes provisions for the use of military force, said their immediate goal was to escalate sanctions \u2014 including the possible interdiction at sea of ships carrying Venezuelan oil \u2014 and provide a legal framework for other countries in the hemisphere to join them.\n\n\u201cThe treaty provides a playbook, from a political, sanctions and military perspective,\u201d a senior administration official said. \u201cWhat it does is provide resoluteness in the direction that the region is headed.\u201d This official and others discussed the sensitive issue on the condition of anonymity.\n\nBut U.S. zeal, and the history of American military intervention in the region, has made some treaty members wary of invoking the pact.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a slippery slope. You do it for sanctions, but then you find yourself with this possibility of conflict as well,\u201d said a senior official of one major Latin American country with close ties to the United States. \u201cYou can make it stop at sanctions, fine, but then you leave the door open to further activity.\u201d\n\nInterdictions at sea or closing airspace to Venezuela, another contemplated action, both imply the possible use of force, this official said.\n\nMexico, which withdrew from the treaty in 2004 but participated in Wednesday\u2019s OAS debate, was more publicly pointed.\n\n\u201cMexico will not remain silent during the irresponsible convocation of this treaty,\u201d said the country\u2019s OAS ambassador, Luz Elena Ba\u00f1os Rivas, who called it a \u201cpretense\u201d for the use of force.\n\nFar from the outside intervention that the treaty was designed to protect against, she said, Venezuela\u2019s conflict was an internal one, and \u201cthere is no conflict that requires military defense.\u201d\n\nTrump administration officials, as they have for many months, insist Maduro\u2019s grip on power and the loyalty of those around him \u2014 including the military \u2014 is close to cracking.\n\nBy moving more troops to the border and providing support for Colombian guerrillas, the senior administration official said, Maduro is creating an \u201cexistential crisis\u201d for his own armed forces, whose loyalty is already in doubt.\n\nBut those forces, Colombian and U.S. officials said, are under the thumb of Cuba \u2014 which has thousands of intelligence officials in Venezuela \u2014 and Russia, which has provided Venezuela with one of the most formidable arsenals in South America. Havana has acknowledged there are thousands of Cubans in Venezuela but says they are health-care and educational workers.\n\n[As Venezuela\u2019s misery grows, U.S. focus shifts to Cuba\u2019s role]\n\nThose external powers, U.S. officials maintain, are responsible for Maduro\u2019s persistence amid economic collapse and international opposition. As his government prepares to defend itself, Russians have supplied and trained the military. Among the Russian weapons in Venezuela are thousands of 9K38Igla portable surface-to-air missiles.\n\nThe Colombians and the Trump administration also say Russia may be upgrading the sophisticated missile defense system it has installed in Venezuela, officials said.\n\nVenezuela has long provided support and refuge for Colombia\u2019s National Liberation Army, known as the ELN for its initials in Spanish. Late last month, a breakaway group of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC \u2014 the country\u2019s separate, far larger guerrilla group \u2014 announced it was withdrawing from a 2016 peace agreement with the Colombian government that ended Latin America\u2019s longest conflict.\n\nThat internal war left the country in a state of crisis for decades, as leftist rebels kidnapped prominent figures, bombed urban areas, extorted those in the countryside and engaged in extensive narcotics trafficking to support their efforts \u2014 activities that were sometimes matched by the Colombian military and the brutal right-wing militias that were formed to combat them.\n\nUnder the peace deal, negotiated in Cuba between FARC and the government, the guerrillas agreed to lay down their arms and join the political process in Colombia, in exchange for amnesty and economic benefits.\n\nIn a video posted online, which Colombia charged was filmed in Venezuela, the breakaway group declared a \u201cnew chapter\u201d in the armed struggle against a government it said had betrayed the deal and not lived up to its obligations.\n\nSurrounded by 20 heavily armed FARC members, top leader Luciano Mar\u00edn \u2014 known by the nom de guerre Iv\u00e1n M\u00e1rquez \u2014 condemned the killing in the past two years of more than 500 left-wing community leaders and 150 former fighters.\n\n\u201cThe state has not fulfilled its most important obligations, which is to guarantee the life of its citizens and especially avoid assassinations for political reasons,\u201d Mar\u00edn said. He said the group would \u201ccoordinate\u201d its efforts with the ELN.\n\nColombian President Iv\u00e1n Duque, a conservative elected after the peace deal was implemented, responded by saying, \u201cColombia doesn\u2019t accept threats from anyone, much less from drug traffickers.\u201d He called those in the breakaway FARC group a \u201cband of criminals\u201d supported by Maduro.\n\nBut many Colombians, already pressured by the presence of nearly 2 million Venezuelans who have crossed the border seeking refuge from economic collapse and growing violence, fear their country is about to regress from nearly two years of welcome peace.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve already rehired my bodyguards,\u201d said one prominent Colombian, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for security reasons.", "description": "The United States and others in the region invoked a mutual defense pact, which allows joint action ranging from sanctions to military force.", "authors": ["Karen Deyoung", "Associate Editor", "Senior National Security Correspondent", "September At Pm", "Karen Deyoung Is Associate Editor", "Senior National Security Correspondent For The Post.
