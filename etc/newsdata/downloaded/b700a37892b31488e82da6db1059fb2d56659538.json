I've been crying a LOT! And laughing\u2026and everything in between.\"\n\nOn the subject of laughter, he added, \"Her audacious sense of humor blessed many, shocked a few, but allowed us to laugh in the face of adversity.\"\n\nWhang, who was born in Arlington, Virginia, earned a bachelor's degree in psychology from Yale and a master's degree in cognitive psychology from Brown, according to CBS Los Angeles.\n\nShe had a nearly 30-year acting career and continued to take roles into 2019.
