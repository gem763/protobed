(AP) - Sean Manaea matched his career high by striking out 10 in his second start following shoulder surgery, and the Oakland Athletics beat Detroit 3-1 on Sunday to give the Tigers their first 100-loss season since 2003.\n\nManaea (1-0) pitched five scoreless innings against the New York Yankees on Sept. 1, his first big league outing since winning at Minnesota on Aug. 24 last year.\n\nHe allowed two hits over seven innings against the Tigers, who didn\u2019t get a hit until Christian Stewart homered leading off the fifth. The 27-year-old left-hander struck out seven of his first 11 batters, including Dawel Lugo to end the first after back-to-back walks by Jeimer Candelario and Ronny Rodr\u00edguez.\n\nManaea worked around a leadoff double in the sixth, then needed just six pitches to work through the seventh. He has a 0.75 ERA after two starts.\n\nKhris Davis had a two-run double for Oakland, which remained one game behind Tampa Bay for the top AL wild card and 1\u00bd games ahead of Cleveland for the second wild card.\n\nAt 42-100, Detroit is headed to its poorest record since going 43-119 in 2003, the team record for losses. Baltimore, Miami, Kansas City and Toronto also are on pace to lose 100 games; the big league record of four clubs was set in 2002.\n\nYusmeiro Petit pitched around a walk in the eighth and Liam Hendriks threw a perfect ninth for his 19th save in 24 chances, completing a two-hitter.\n\nOakland won six of seven games against Detroit this season.\n\nSemien doubled and scored on Mark Canha\u2019s groundout in the first, and Davis stopped an 0-for-19 slide in the fourth with a double off Drew VerHagenth.\n\nDetroit starter Daniel Norris (3-12) was removed after three innings for his sixth straight start, part of the Tigers\u2019 plan to limit his workload.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nTigers: Jordy Mercer (right wrist) went 0 for 3 after missing two games.\n\nAthletics: Ram\u00f3n Laureano was given a planned day off. Laureano came out of Saturday\u2019s game with cramps in his right leg, one day after coming off the injured list.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nTigers: RHP Edwin Jackson (3-9, 9.16 ERA) enters Tuesday\u2019s game against the New York Yankees needing two strikeouts to reach 1,500. Jackson has lost his last four starts.\n\nAthletics: RHP Mike Fiers (14-3, 3.51) has won a career-high 12 straight decisions heading into Monday\u2019s start against AL West-leading Houston. That\u2019s one shy of the Oakland record set by Hall of Famer Catfish Hunter in 1973.\n\n__\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Sean Manaea matched his career high by striking out 10 in his second start following shoulder surgery, and the Oakland Athletics beat Detroit 3-1 on Sunday to give the Tigers their first 100-loss season since 2003.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Michael Wagaman"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/08/tigers_athletics_baseball_47284_c0-166-3960-2474_s1770x1032.jpg?e4fb9f09fe3cad1a75f791d2507dd52c555a5352", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
