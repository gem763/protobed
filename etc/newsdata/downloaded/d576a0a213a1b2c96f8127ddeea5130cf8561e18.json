Congress returns to Washington on Oct. 15 after a two-week recess.\n\n\"There's no question in my mind that she would have the votes,\" Democratic Representative Jim Himes said on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday.\n\nThe impeachment investigation could lead to the approval by the House of formal charges against Trump.\n\nA trial on whether to remove him from office would then be held in the Republican-controlled Senate, but few Republicans have broken ranks with Trump so far for asking Ukraine and China to launch investigations of Biden, a former vice president and leading contender for the Democratic nomination to face Trump in the November 2020 presidential election.\n\nSECOND WHISTLEBLOWER\n\nOn Sunday, lawyers said a second whistleblower had come forward to substantiate an August complaint from an unnamed U.S. government official, which touched off the investigation.\n\nDiplomatic text messages released by Democrats last week show that U.S. officials were involved in the effort to secure a public commitment from Ukraine to look into the business dealings of Hunter Biden.\n\nTrump has alleged that Hunter Biden profited in his business dealings in both Ukraine and China from his father's position, and that Joe Biden, as vice president, pushed Ukraine to fire a prosecutor to impede a probe of a company tied to his son.\n\nThere has been no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of either Biden.\n\nThose texts show Sondland seeking to downplay the concerns of another U.S. diplomat, William Taylor, that the United States was withholding $400 million in aid in order to secure Ukraine's cooperation.\n\n\"The President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo's of any kind,\" Sondland wrote. \"I suggest we stop the back and forths by text.\"\n\nSondland is expected to testify on Tuesday before the three House committees leading the impeachment probe. State Department counselor Ulrich Brechbuhl is also scheduled to testify that day.\n\nDeputy Secretary of State George Kent is scheduled to testify on Monday. Yovanovitch is due to appear on Friday.", "description": "U.S. diplomats to testify about Trump-Ukraine efforts as Democrats build impeachment case", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF96077_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
