FOREX-Dollar steadies as markets hit holding pattern, eyeing U.S-China trade talks\n\n* Dollar mostly holds overnight gains\n\n* Moves slight as markets in holding pattern, watching trade\n\ntalks\n\n* Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh\n\nBy Tom Westbrook\n\nSINGAPORE, Oct 8 (Reuters) - The dollar found support on\n\nTuesday while investors waited for an outcome from Sino-U.S.\n\ntrade talks in Washington, with caution the catchcry as neither\n\nside showed any signs of giving ground at the negotiations.\n\nThe greenback had gained overnight as risk aversion, and low\n\nexpectations for a breakthrough trade deal, drove trade-exposed\n\ncurrencies such as the Australian and New Zealand dollars, the\n\nChinese yuan and Korean won lower.\n\nThe dollar mostly held those gains Asian morning trade, but\n\nmoves were slight as currency markets find themselves in a\n\nholding pattern. Traders are looking to news from the\n\ndiscussions, and a Chinese service-sector survey, due out at\n\n0145 GMT, to drive sentiment.\n\n\"No-one can be confident about these talks, except our\n\ninclination has long been that the talks are more likely to\n\ndisappoint than to please market expectations,\" said Sean\n\nCallow, currency strategist at Westpac in Sydney.\n\n\"The U.S. and China are just too far apart on key issues,\"\n\nhe said, leaving only a very limited deal in prospect.\n\nThe dollar retreated marginally from a week-high touched on\n\nthe Japanese yen overnight to sit at 107.30 yen . It edged\n\nlower on the euro to steady around $1.0971 as the single\n\ncurrency slowly climbs from a 2-1/2 year low hit last week.\n\nIt was flat against the Australian dollar at $0.6728\n\nand steady against the New Zealand dollar at $0.6286.\n\nAgainst a basket of currencies the dollar steadied at\n\n98.976.\n\nThe Chinese yuan, the most sensitive currency to the trade\n\nnegotiations, was flat in offshore trade at 7.1330 per dollar\n\nCNH= , with onshore trade to resume at 0130 GMT after a\n\nweek-long break for China's national day holidays.\n\nDeputy-level meetings between U.S. and Chinese trade\n\nnegotiators began in Washington on Monday, with little immediate\n\nsigns of progress. Top-level talks are scheduled to resume on Thursday, when\n\nChinese Vice Premier Liu He meets with U.S. Trade Representative\n\nRobert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.\n\nThe talks are getting underway about a week before a\n\nscheduled increase in U.S. tariffs on $250 billion worth of\n\nChinese goods, to 30% from 25%.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has said the tariff increase\n\nwill take effect if no progress is made in the negotiations. The\n\nU.S. also added another 28 Chinese public security bureaus and\n\ncompanies to a trade blacklist on Monday.\n\n\"It seems the best we can hope for this week is for a truce\n\nto continue and for Trump to extend the deadline for the next\n\nlift in tariffs,\" said Tapas Strickland, an economist at\n\nNational Australia Bank in Sydney.\n\nSterling slipped slightly as investors grow increasingly\n\nconcerned about a lack of progress between Britain and the\n\nEuropean Union to agree a Brexit withdrawal deal. Sterling last\n\ntraded at $1.2287 per pound.", "description": "FOREX-Dollar steadies as markets hit holding pattern, eyeing U.S-China trade talks", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEE4D0BB-ORUBS_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
