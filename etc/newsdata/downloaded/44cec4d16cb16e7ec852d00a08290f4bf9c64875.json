Chicken Dance digs deep under @KarisTeetan to give the handler his third win today! #HKracing pic.twitter.com/9dPuECdEdb \u2014 HKJC Racing (@HKJC_Racing) October 6, 2019\n\n\u201cYou can only send them around the trotting ring here and you can gallop them there so you can have them more forward,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTwo seasons ago it was great, last season it was not so great but that is just Hong Kong, a few of the handicaps were adjusted on those younger horses so we just keep the head down and the bum up.\u201d\n\nBand Of Brothers looked all but certain to be beaten in the Sai Ying Pun Handicap (1,400m) before jockey Zac Purton lifted the five-year-old in the last 50m to a hard-fought victory over Blake Shinn on War Room.\n\nWinning off a rating of 74, O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s charge could find himself rising to Class Two, a task which he could be capable of on his day, his handler believes.\n\n\u201cHe has done a great job, he is not winning by far which suggests the handicapper is starting to get him,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cLogically, you think there is more to come, but there is going to come a time where there\u2019s not. He has been a super-honest horse, very tractable. He has done a good job.\n\n\u201cZac said he got to the front and then kind of waited for them, in his last two starts he was going to get picked off both two times and he has found something.\n\n\u201cIn time you can see him being a good, hard Class Two horse, if you can get a horse to that in Hong Kong you have done a very good job.\u201d\n\nChicken Dance bettered his stablemate\u2019s effort just 30 minutes later in the Shek Tong Tsui Handicap (1,200m), holding off the likes of Lone Eagle and California Gungho to win under Karis Teetan.\n\nWith the four-year-old carrying just 117 pounds on his back, he is certain to stay in the grade, where O\u2019Sullivan will look to step him up in distance.\n\n\u201cI think he is quite a promising horse, Chicken Dance, especially when he starts to go a little bit further like 1,600m,\u201d he said.\n\nIt takes his combined winning margins in his last two starts to four-and-a-half lengths.\n\nThe win also rounded out a solid double for Teetan, who also rode Hidden Spirit to victory for the Kiwi trainer.", "description": "New Zealand trainer Paul O\u2019Sullivan had Sunday\u2019s meeting at Sha Tin circled on the calendar for some time and delivered in spades, landing his first treble in more than 18 months....", "authors": ["Trenton Akers", "Tom Biddington", "Sam Agars"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/700x400/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/06/f6e3fa12-e826-11e9-8a10-b9721f28293e_image_hires_192217.JPG?itok=eXrk41Ng&v=1570360945", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
