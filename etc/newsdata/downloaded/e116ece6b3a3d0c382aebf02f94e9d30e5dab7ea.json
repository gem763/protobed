However, the BBC then picked up the torch by trying to soften people\u2019s look at pedophiles. Not long ago, the sexualization of children continued with the push for child drag queens in a video that sexualized young boys. Young boys in drag would go on to appear in photos next to naked men, which were openly passed around Twitter with zero reaction from the network.\n\nI could go on, but you get the idea. The sexualization of children is well underway, and now they\u2019re trying to teach it in colleges.\n\nAccording to a tweet by Alex Mazzara, a student in San Diego, the topic of pedophilia as a sexual orientation was being brought up. According to Mazzara, his class began discussing this as a topic after they were put through watching an eight-minute video from Vice News that featured a \u201cshowcasing\u201d of \u201cself-identified pedophiles.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn actual topic we discussed in class today at a State University after watching an 8 minute Vice News video showcasing self identified pedophiles. This is going to be mainstreamed,\u201d tweeted Mazzara.\n\nAn actual topic we discussed in class today at a State University after watching an 8 minute Vice News video showcasing self identified pedophiles.

There are entire communities of these people who promote their filth publicly. Sadly I\u2019d predict this is going mainstream in the next 10 years,\u201d said Mazzara.\n\nI've had out and proud pedophiles in my mentions for 2 days now.

With the mainstream media and colleges now attempting to push pedophilia as a \u201csexual orientation,\u201d I imagine it won\u2019t be long until people begin to openly declare themselves pedophiles and their community becomes defended as part of the LGBT community.\n\nWhat is being overlooked is that our children will become more in danger than they ever were. Pedophilia is not a sexual orientation, it\u2019s a predatory sickness. Normalizing it is to normalize rape and abuse.\n\nWhile I do think pedophilia is evil, those who are pedophiles need to be studied and profiled in the same way we did with serial killers. They\u2019re definitely sick, and their desires need to be treated as a sickness, not just another sexual preference.", "description": "The Normalization of Pedophilia is Underway, and a California University Is Already Trying to Push It On Students", "authors": ["Brandon Morse", "Alex Parker", "Sister Toldjah", "Jennifer Van Laar", "Elizabeth Vaughn", "Posted At Am On September"], "top_image": "https://www.redstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/siblings-817369_1280.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
