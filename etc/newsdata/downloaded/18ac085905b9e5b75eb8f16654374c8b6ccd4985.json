In this case the monthly chart is appropriate as the objective is a long-term position.\n\n\u2022 The chart shows that the stock of AT&T jumped on activist investor Elliott Management taking a $3.2 billion stake in AT&T.\n\n\u2022 Elliott Management says AT&T stock could be worth at least $60 per share by the end of 2021.\n\n\u2022 Coincidently, the chart also shows the long-term target of $60.\n\n\u2022 Elliott\u2019s $60 target is based on the sale of non-core assets, an increase in strategic focus, an improvement in operational efficiency, better capital allocation and better governance.\n\n\u2022 Compare AT&T\u2019s stock to S&P 500 ETF SPY, -0.02% on a chart and you will readily see that AT&T has been underperforming. Underperforming stocks often revert to the mean.\n\n\u2022 The chart shows the first target is around $44. In due course, we will provide to our subscribers more precise target zones.\n\n\u2022 The chart shows AT&T\u2019s stock has traced higher lows.\n\n\u2022 Relative strength index (RSI) on the chart shows that the stock is overbought and may pull back.\n\n\u2022 Although the Elliott news caused an increase in volume, the stock closed near the low of the day when the news was released. This is a negative. This indicates a pullback may occur in the near future.\n\n\u2022 Overall, the chart shows that volume is not high. This also indicates that a pullback may occur in the near future.\n\nAsk Arora: Nigam Arora answers your questions about investing in stocks, ETFs, bonds, gold and silver, oil and currencies.

In contrast, popular stocks such as Facebook FB, -1.37%, Netflix NFLX, -2.16% and AMD AMD, -0.89% are over-owned. Of course, Amazon and Apple are very over-owned.\n\nWhen a stock is very over-owned, everybody who is going to buy it has already bought it. On negative news, sellers appear but there are no buyers. This can cause a major drop in a stock totally disproportionate to the news. Our long-time readers are already familiar that we have used this information and logic numerous times to give sell signals in popular stocks right at the top.\n\nSince AT&T is under-owned by institutions, there is plenty of room for it to run up as they start taking new positions or adding to exiting small positions.\n\nPay attention to this scenario\n\nStart with Arora\u2019s Second Law of Investing and Trading: \u201cNobody knows with certainty what is going to happen next in the markets.\u201d\n\nScenario analysis has been, in part, responsible for The Arora Report\u2019s success. When various scenarios are analyzed in advance, investors are able to act before the crowd with conviction when one of the pre-analyzed scenarios starts unfolding. Think of the following scenario:\n\n\u2022 China enters a major recession.\n\n\u2022 Exports from Europe to China fall, and Germany enters a recession.\n\n\u2022 The U.S. economy is about 70% consumer-based. At first Americans keep on consuming, preventing the U.S. from going into a recession, but after a while the U.S. also dips into a recession.\n\n\u2022 Trade war with China escalates. China retaliates by making an example of Apple.\n\n\u2022 The momo (momentum) crowd starts wholesale selling of expensive stocks such as Amazon. The recent aggressive selling in cloud stocks such as CrowdStrike Holdings CRWD, +6.78%, Zoom Video Communications ZM, +2.16%, Okta OKTA, -1.87% and Twilio TWLO, -1.67% should give less experienced investors a small taste of what may happen. Popular momo crowd stocks such as Shopify SHOP, -5.97%, The Trade Desk TTD, -1.69%, Fastly FSLY, +5.18% and Veeva Systems VEEV, +0.42% may lose 50%-80% of their value.\n\n\u2022 The Federal Reserve responds by cutting interest rates to zero.\n\n\u2022 Investors move into high-dividend-paying stocks such as AT&T.\n\n\u2022 AT&T succeeds in selling non-core assets at good prices.\n\n\u2022 Investors start perceiving AT&T as a safe stock.\n\nUnder such a scenario or even under less drastic scenarios, AT&T stock may end up outperforming Apple and Amazon.\n\nWhen and how to buy\n\nInvestors ought to consider scaling in on dips. As appropriate, we will be providing precise buy zones and the quantity to buy in each buy zone.\n\nInvestors ought to resist the temptation of buying their normal full core position size on the positive Elliott news. There will be pullbacks.\n\nDisclosure: Subscribers to The Arora Report may have positions in the securities mentioned in this article or may take positions at any time.
