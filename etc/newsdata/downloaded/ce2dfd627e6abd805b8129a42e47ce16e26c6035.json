Westbrook spent the first 11 years of his career in Oklahoma City where he was the face of the franchise before moving to Houston in the deal the Rockets hope will help bring them their first title since 1995.\n\nStory continues\n\nGilgeous-Alexander had 22 points and Dennis Schroder added 22 points to lead the Thunder, who fell to 1-3.\n\nDanilo Gallinari made a 3-pointer to get the Thunder within 4 with about 3 1/2 minutes left, but Westbrook added a jump shot seconds later to push Houston\u2019s lead to 106-100.\n\nPaul hit a 3 for the Thunder after that before a turnover by Westbrook.\n\nHarden made two free throws with about 90 seconds left to leave Houston up 108-103.\n\nPaul added a basket, but Westbrook drove into the lane before kicking it out to P.J. Tucker for a 3 to push the lead to 6 with a minute left.\n\nHouston used a 39-point third quarter to take an 11-point lead into the fourth quarter. Both teams had trouble getting going on offense to start the quarter and the only points either team scored in the first three minutes of the fourth came on two free throws Gallinari at the start of the quarter.\n\nPaul made the first field goal of the fourth quarter on a 3-pointer with just over eight minutes remaining before a layup by Schroder cut the lead to 91-87.\n\nHouston scored its first points of the quarter when Harden made two free throws about a minute later.\n\nThe Rockets led by 4 soon after that when Harden was fouled on a 3-pointer and made all three free throws to make it 96-89. That was the start of a 7-4 run that left Houston up 100-93 with five minutes to go.\n\nThe Rockets opened the third quarter with a 17-4 run to erase a 10-point halftime deficit and take a 69-66 lead with about seven minutes left in the quarter. A 3-pointer by Tucker put Houston on top and Westbrook punctuated the run with a dunk before screaming and flexing as he passed the Thunder bench.", "description": "James Harden scored 40 points and Russell Westbrook scored 21 and fell an assist shy of a triple-double.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/QFk6BAnvqPUFp1FZ89uYzw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjAuMDg3MDUxMTQyNTQ2Mg--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Ps8j5_pMuTJnpCnLS_kUIw--~B/aD01MTc7dz05MTk7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/5433bb3a38b9ff800e0a47e562cee0c2", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
