It\u2019s a sense of helplessness.\n\n\u201cThe conservative will continue to vote for the rightist Umno and PAS, and the progressive may not be bothered to vote, which would only benefit the conservative camp.\n\n\u201cThe statement doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s the whole sad scene now, that mainly, PH is not spending much time fixing the economy, but (instead) indulging in power struggles,\u201d he said.\n\nUM associate professor Awang Azman Awang Pawi said that people will continue to support PH as long as they see the ruling coalition make real changes in terms of coming up with economic policies rather than politicking.\u2015 Picture by Farhan Najib More\n\nStory continues", "description": "KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 25 \u2014 Pakatan Harapan (PH) leaders need to stop attacking each other or risk losing more support and drive away local and foreign investors, analysts have warned.\u00a0 Referring...", "authors": ["Soo Wern Jun"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ywofl5HdY5VufoY.ChNxqQ--~B/aD02NjY7dz0xMDAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/mmail.com.my/6cf843b151bd680d771a5f28b5517f7b", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
