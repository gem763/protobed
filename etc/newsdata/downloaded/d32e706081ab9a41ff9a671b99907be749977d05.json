He got on his message track and never really broke from it.\n\nThe message had a few variations, but basically it was: \"Hey Quebecers, we're like you, and we're the only ones you can trust to have your back.\"\n\nBloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois supporters in Montreal celebrate after a strong showing. The party was on pace to win 32 seats, up from 10 at dissolution. (Charles Contant/CBC)\n\nAdd three confident debate performances, two unpopular national leaders and scant references to sovereignty, and voil\u00e0! You've got a comeback for the ages.\n\nNow with a caucus of 32 MPs and the expectations of 1.4 million Quebecers, things are about to get significantly more difficult for Blanchet.\n\nAnd as it gets down to doing things, the Bloc will have to confront some existential questions.\n\nHeading toward a new identity\n\nThe Bloc owed its earliest success, of course, to the failures of the Meech Lake and Charlottetown accords and the corresponding rise in support for Quebec sovereignty.\n\nBut even as support for independence faltered after 1995 and founder Lucien Bouchard left the party he founded to become Quebec's premier, the Bloc remained a major presence in the House of Commons.\n\nThough Bouchard and many of the original party members were former Tories, the party began to identify more openly with the left under Gilles Duceppe.\n\nBloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Leader Gilles Duceppe, right, shakes hands with former Quebec premier and Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois leader Jacques Parizeau in 2000. (Fred Chartrand/The Canadian Press)\n\nBut if the two pillars of the Bloc's identity have been sovereignty and social democratic values, those pillars were far from the foundation of the party's success in this campaign.\n\nBlanchet aligned his party with the Coalition Avenir Qu\u00e9bec, the nationalist centre-right provincial party that swept to power for the first time last year.\n\nIn his speech to supporters in Montreal, Blanchet implicitly acknowledged the bargain he struck to ensure the Bloc's revival: shelve talk of sovereignty and trade it for the more palatable rhetoric of nationalism.\n\n\"We understand the depth of our mandate, but we also understand its limitations,\" he said. \"This time, for this time, the realization of sovereignty is not our mandate.\"\n\nInstead, Blanchet pledged to be the voice of the \"consensus\" in Quebec's legislature, the National Assembly.\n\nLeaving the left behind?\n\nBy hewing to the CAQ, the Bloc will also have its commitment to social democratic values challenged.\n\nBlanchet spent the campaign insisting the Bloc is a progressive party. But it's not clear how it can be that while also serving as the voice of a legislature dominated by a party devoted to tax cuts, trimming the civil service and lowering immigration levels.\n\nThe challenge will be particularly acute when it comes to the environment \u2014 a major plank of the Bloc's platform.\n\nOpposing a cross-country oil pipeline that would go through Quebec was a no-brainer for Blanchet; it has little support anywhere in the province, including within the ranks of the CAQ government.\n\nBut Blanchet avoided taking such a firm position on other environmentally dubious projects \u2014 such as the natural gas project in the Saguenay which the CAQ supports.\n\nThe Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois was the only party in the federal campaign to support Quebec's Bill 21, the controversial law that bans some civil servants from wearing religious symbols. (Kate McKenna/CBC)\n\nBlanchet's commitment to environmental protection could soon find itself in conflict with Legault's desire to wean the province off equalization payments as quickly as possible.\n\nAnd then there is the identity question.\n\nThe Bill 21 issue almost certainly contributed to the Bloc's gains. But it also committed the Bloc to advocating a conception of nationalism that is at odds with many left-wing parties in 2019.\n\nIn its slogans \u2014 \"Quebec is us,\" choose politicians \"who are like you\" \u2014 the party conveyed a narrower conception of Quebec identity than it has in the past.\n\nAnd when the Journal de Montr\u00e9al exposed four candidates for having made Islamophobic comments, Blanchet's decision to keep those candidates on despite their remarks was widely condemned, even by pundits normally sympathetic to the party.\n\nOne of those candidates \u2014 Val\u00e9rie Tremblay in Chicoutimi\u2013Le Fjord \u2014 was narrowly defeated on Monday by the Conservative incumbent Richard Martel.\n\nThere is no question that Blanchet led his party to impressive gains. But some might wonder whether he may have sacrificed the soul of the party in the process.", "description": "Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Leader Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet had a fairly easy run of it during the campaign.
