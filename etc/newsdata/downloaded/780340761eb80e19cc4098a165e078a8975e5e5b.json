A 2017 report from arms control group Conflict Armament Research found that ISIS had captured \u201csignificant quantities\u201d of NATO weaponry after looting Iraqi weapons depots in 2014. The lion\u2019s share of \u201cfound\u201d ISIS weapons were Warsaw Pact-era firearms and ammo caches that likely originated in Russia and China, but many more foreign-pattern arms \u201cwere purchased by the United States and Saudi Arabia\u201d from E.U. nations to equip Syrian opposition forces \u201cwithout authorisation\u201d\u2014that is, without getting permission from the supplying government to redistribute the weapons. \u201cSupplies of materiel into the Syrian conflict from foreign parties\u2014notably the United States and Saudi Arabia\u2014have indirectly allowed IS to obtain substantial quantities of anti-armor ammunition,\u201d according to the CAR report. \u201cThese systems continue to pose a significant threat to the coalition of troops arrayed against IS forces.\u201d\n\nThe types of American weaponry flowing into the chaotic region are alarming\u2014particularly, anti-tank guided weapons like the BGM-71 TOW and FGM-148 Javelin missile. The Defense Department made a point of funneling these arms to Kurdish allies in northern Syria at the height of the anti-ISIS campaign, starting in 2017; the Pentagon\u2019s fiscal 2018 budget request included funding for AT-4 anti-tank rockets and other weapons \u201ccapable of defeating specific threats that forces are expected to encounter,\u201d as DOD spokesman Eric Pahon put it at a time. It\u2019s not clear what exact chain of custody got those premier weapons systems in Kurdish hands, but at least 500 TOW missiles were reportedly transferred through Saudi Arabia to the Free Syrian Army in late 2015 through the CIA\u2019s covert \u201cTimber Sycamore\u201d program.\n\nAs I have previously written, such weapons transfers are the U.S.\u2019s go-to vehicle for shoring up partner forces abroad in order to free up U.S. forces\u2014and when American weapons end up in the hands of our allies, some inevitably end up in the hands of our enemies. In late 2016, a year after Timber Sycamore kicked into high gear, an ISIS force near the Syrian city of Al Bab used guided anti-tank weapons\u2014probably mostly Russian, but possibly some American\u2014to make mincemeat of roughly 10 tanks, three infantry fighting vehicles, and an armored personnel carrier, according to open-source investigatory group Bellingcat. Just three months after the U.S. announced heavy weapons transfers to the Kurds in 2017, video footage showed a Javelin missile and launcher among an ISIS cache of weapons recovered outside the Iraqi city of Tal Afar.\n\nIn one case CAR studied, another guided anti-tank missile \u201cwas manufactured in the EU, sold to the United States, supplied to a party in the Syrian conflict, transferred to IS forces in Iraq... The full chain of transactions occurred within two months of the weapon\u2019s dispatch from the factory.\u201d Researchers called it \u201cthe most rapid case of [weapons] diversion following unauthorised retransfer\u201d they had seen. The Trump administration may have held up delivery of anti-tank missiles to Ukraine this summer over campaign politics, but Islamic State militants had no problem getting one within eight weeks of production.*\n\nIn 2017, investigator Damien Spleeters told Wired that the flow of arms, ammo, and other military-grade materiel into ISIS hands had presaged an \u201cindustrial revolution of terrorism,\u201d in which militants scavenge munitions and raw materials like ammonium nitrate to engineer newer, deadlier weapons of warfare. To keep it going, he said, \u201cThey need raw material in industrial quantities.\u201d\n\n", "description": "Trump\u2019s hasty troop withdrawal could trigger a second \"industrial revolution\" in terrorism.", "authors": ["Jared Keller"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/73842524ddfde26a23cb6e10e30d2e0cb95bd18a.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
