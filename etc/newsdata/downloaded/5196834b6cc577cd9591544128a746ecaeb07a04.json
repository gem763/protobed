The shot came off Miguel Castro (1-3), who was charged with all six runs.\n\nGuerrero Jr. was removed in the ninth after being shaken up making a hard slide into second base.\n\n\u201cIt was the rib,\u201d manager Charlie Montoyo said.\n\nGuerrero was wearing a bandage over his left rib cage, but it was unclear if he would miss any or all of Toronto\u2019s final 10 games.\n\nBrock Stewart (4-0) worked the eighth and Derek Law finished for his fifth save, retiring Trey Mancini on a bases-loaded grounder to end a game that lasted 4 hours, 8 minutes.\n\nHomers by Jonathan Villar and Anthony Santander in the fourth inning put Baltimore ahead 7-1 and ended another disappointing outing by Buchholz. He allowed 10 hits, seven for extra bases, in 3 2/3 innings and left with a 6.48 ERA.\n\n\u201cTerrible,\u201d Buchholz said. \u201cIt\u2019s what I told (catcher) Reese (McGuire) whenever Charlie came out and got the ball from me. I tapped him on the facemask and told him \u2018That\u2019s what happens when you don\u2019t execute your pitches when you need to execute them.\u2019 It\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve given up seven runs.\u201d\n\nThe oldest man on a team rebuilding with youth, Buchholz has spent more days on the injured list than on the active roster. The 35-year-old started on the IL with an elbow strain and was sidelined with right shoulder inflammation from May 9-Aug. 24.\n\nThis was the shortest of his 10 starts this season. Buchholz missed time last year with Arizona because of elbow and oblique injuries, and in 2017 he had season-ending elbow surgery after making two starts in April.\n\nNow, 12 years after throwing a no-hitter against the Orioles for Boston in his second major league start, Buchholz faces an uncertain future after he completes the final days of a one-year deal he signed in March.\n\nSince going 81-61 with the Red Sox during a 10-year span, Buchholz is 8-8 over the past three seasons.\n\nIn an eventful first inning, Dylan Bundy struck out Teoscar Hernandez with the bases loaded to end the top half and Derek Fisher opened the bottom half by reaching over the left-field wall to rob Villar of a home run. With two outs, Santander, Rio Ruiz and Austin Hays doubled in succession for a 2-0 lead.\n\nIt was 4-1 in the fourth before Villar hit his 23rd homer , Trey Mancini singled and Santander sent a 1-2 pitch deep into the right-field seats.\n\nBuchholz never turned to follow the path of the ball. He simply motioned for another baseball, caught it barehanded and trudged back to the mound.\n\nAn instant after that, Montoyo went to the mound and took that ball from Buchholz.\n\nBut Baltimore couldn\u2019t hold the lead.\n\n\u201cMiguel Castro has been throwing the ball great the past couple months,\u201d manager Brandon Hyde said. \u201cHe just had a tough night.\u201d\n\nFAMILY TIES\n\nNot long after hitting for the cycle in Tuesday\u2019s 8-5 victory, Toronto 2B Cavan Biggio received a message from someone who knows what it\u2019s like to accomplish the feat in the majors: His father Craig, who did so April 8, 2002.\n\n\u201cHe shot me a text after the game and said \u2018Congratulations, welcome to the club,\u2019\u201d Cavan Biggio said.\n\nThe Biggios are the second father-son duo to hit for the cycle in the majors, joining Gary and Daryle Ward.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nBlue Jays: LHP Tim Mayza underwent surgery to reconstruct the ulnar collateral ligament and repair the flexor tendon in his left elbow. Mayza, who was 1-3 with a 4.91 ERA in 68 relief appearances, will miss all of next season and hopes to return for spring training in 2021.\n\nOrioles: RHP Hunter Harvey has been shut down for the rest of the season. The prospect has hit his quota of innings, Hyde said. \u2026 Renato N\u00fa\u00f1ez is day-to-day after being hit on the left hand with a pitch Monday in Detroit. He\u2019s one HR shy of 30. \u2026 A collision with the outfield wall Tuesday night while chasing Biggio\u2019s triple did not give Mason Williams a concussion but left him with a sore shoulder and knee.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBlue Jays: LHP Anthony Kay (0-0, 6.30 ERA) makes his third major-league start in the series finale Thursday night.\n\nOrioles: RHP Gabriel Ynoa (1-8, 5.74) makes his 12th start and 35th appearance. His only win of the year came in a relief role on July 17 against Washington.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "After Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Clay Buchholz left the game under radically different circumstances, Randal Grichuk delivered the decisive blow in an improbable Toronto victory.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "David Ginburg"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/18/blue_jays_orioles_baseball_24704_c0-132-3165-1977_s1770x1032.jpg?97217ce18d37d94776837944cbf75fdc1561fed8", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
