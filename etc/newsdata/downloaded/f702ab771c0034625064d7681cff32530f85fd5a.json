Is he an L.A. type of guy now?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m versatile,\u201d he said \u201cI can drop some Jersey on you when the situation calls for it. But I feel very comfortable in L.A. I still live in Atlanta. My family is still in Atlanta. I only spend between 30 and 45 days a year here [there]. I spend most of my time in L.A, and I move around quite comfortable.\u201d\n\nSo he is an \u201cA-list\u201d guy, right?\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say that,\u201d Kasten said. \u201cI move around quite comfortably gawking at A-listers.\u201d\n\nIf his success as president of the Dodgers is any measure, Kasten is very comfortable there.\n\nSince he joined with Magic Johnson and Mark Walter to purchase the Dodgers in 2012, the franchise has won seven straight National League West division titles and the last two NL pennants. This year they finished 106-54.\n\nHe has overseen the upgrade of Dodger Stadium, which had fallen into disrepair, with plans to finish the additions in time to host the 2020 All-Star Game\n\nThey have also led baseball in attendance all seven years under Kasten, and this year drew 3.9 million fans \u2014 almost 50,000 per game.\n\nFor a little perspective, that\u2019s 22,000 a game more than his old team, the Nationals drew this season.\n\nGranted, it\u2019s the Dodgers, one of baseball\u2019s crown jewel franchises. But they had fallen into disarray under the ownership of Frank McCourt, and had driven away loyal fans. In 2011, the Dodgers drew just 36,236 per game.\n\nI remember the moment I knew that Kasten would wind up as the Dodgers owner. He had resigned as Nationals president after his five-year contract was up in 2010, and was looking for other opportunities. I was with him at an off-season event when he asked me if I had been following the bitter divorce case between Frank and Jamie McCourt, of which the ownership of the Dodgers was part of the dispute.\n\nI knew then that Kasten would wind up in Los Angeles \u2014 just as I knew during the early stages of the bidding for the Nationals after Major League Baseball relocated the franchise to Washington, the ownership group that brought in Kasten would likely wind up with the team. Fortunately for the Lerner family, they recruited Kasten, who is one of the most powerful and influential behind-the-scenes figures in the business of baseball.\n\nHis time in Washington didn\u2019t work out as he hoped when he discovered the Lerner family had different ideas on how to run a franchise than the executive who had run three sports teams in Atlanta \u2014 the Braves, the NBA Hawks and the now-defunct NHL Thrashers. Kasten won 14 straight division titles, five National League pennants and one World Series championship during his time with the Braves.\n\nStill, Kasten speaks fondly of Washington. \u201cI loved all my time in D.C.,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m back there as often as I can be because I love the city and the fans and the organization.\u201d\n\nBut, let\u2019s face it, the Nationals were not the Dodgers. Nor were the Braves.\n\nRunning an iconic club like the Dodgers \u2014 the franchise of Jackie Robinson, Branch Rickey and Sandy Koufax \u2014 that\u2019s a different game.\n\n\u201cDoing what I am doing now is the best thing I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d Kasten said. \u201cIt\u2019s the most fun I\u2019ve ever had, it\u2019s also the most important thing I\u2019ve ever done, because the opportunity to restore an iconic franchise to some of its former glory is a dream come true. For a guy who does what I do, it\u2019s the coolest thing imaginable.\u201d\n\nIt hasn\u2019t all been smooth. The Dodgers have been in a television battle going on six years now. The deal they made with granting Time Warner Cable exclusive marketing rights for SportsNet L.A., which the team owns, for $8.35 billion, keeps them off some cable distributors, leaving a large group of viewers blacked out, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nKasten also took some heat this winter when he was put on the spot in the team\u2019s FanFest about the lack of spending on players this offseason \u2014 specifically Bryce Harper, who many believed was destined for the Dodgers in free agency \u2014 and his lack of response to those questions.\n\nBut he has helped build a progressive front office, led by president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman (whose contract is up this season), that has been at the forefront of the new age of player development.\n\n\u201cI recognized that we had to get ahead of that wave because if we weren\u2019t ahead, we were going to fall behind,\u201d Kasten said. \u201cSo I had to change our front office. That transition was very successful. Any success I\u2019ve had in baseball is because we were able to put together good front offices, like we had in Atlanta, like what you still see in Washington and now here in L.A. We caught up and sped ahead to be one of the teams at the forefront of this new way of playing and developing players.\u201d\n\nThe speed at which the game is changing is challenging for long-time baseball executives, he said.\n\n\u201cI had this conversation with (Phillies president) Andy MacPhail,\u201d Kasten recalled. \u201cHe was out of the game for about two years while I was doing this. When he came back, I told him, \u2018Let me tell you something. Here is what you need to prepare for, because the game is different than even you will recognize from two years ago.\u2019 He found that hard to believe, but pretty soon he saw what I was saying. All of us had to make changes and adapt. We did it, and I think Andy is in the process of doing it. I can see ahead where they will be very successful.\u201d\n\nWell, they have Bryce Harper, I said. You don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d he sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t. That\u2019s good. I have other players you know. I don\u2019t know if you noticed.\u201d\n\nYes, he does \u2014 including MVP candidate Cody Bellinger. He has arguably the best collection of players in baseball.\n\nThis is the second time Kasten has faced his old team in the postseason, as the Dodgers defeated the Nationals in five games in the 2016 division series.\n\nWhile Kasten didn\u2019t assemble a stellar collection of players during his time in Washington, he did one thing that saved the franchise and put them on the path to four division titles and Tuesday\u2019s wild card win \u2014 he hired Mike Rizzo as assistant general manager.\n\nKasten found himself up against the wall with the Lerners, who loved the self-destructive Jim Bowden, their general manager. Hiring Rizzo was Kasten\u2019s hedge against the inevitable failure and departure of Bowden.\n\n\u201cWe hired Mike, but all the people that we brought in, starting with Mike, who are still there, like Doug (Harris, the assistant GM), up and down the organization,\u201d Kasten said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great front office, they\u2019ve had a lot of success, and I expect that will continue for quite a while.\u201d\n\n\u2981 Hear Thom Loverro on 106.7 The Fan Wednesday afternoons and Saturday and Sunday mornings and on the Kevin Sheehan Show podcast.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
