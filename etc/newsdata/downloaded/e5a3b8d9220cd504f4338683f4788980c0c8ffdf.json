He appealed in September for national reconciliation and a unity government, but protesters rejected his \"truce.\"\n\nFollowing a request from the Dominican Republic, which shares the Caribbean island of Hispaniola with Haiti, the UN Security Council held a televised meeting Thursday on the Haitian crisis.\n\n\"The situation on the ground is very worrying,\" said one member of the Council, of which the Dominican Republic is a non-permanent member.\n\n\"Authorities are not up to the task,\" another diplomat said.\n\nPlagued by multiple corruption scandals, Haiti's government fell in February. Local and legislative elections originally scheduled for the end of October will not take place, due to the lack of a vote on the electoral law.\n\n\"Security incidents and roadblocks have disrupted the UN and NGOs' humanitarian programs,\" with \"hospitals facing significant challenges to operate,\" Dujarric said the previous day.\n\n\"Fuel shortages, lack of safe water and other essentials are also affecting orphanages, civil protection units and other emergency services, which are also functioning with limited capacity,\" he said, adding that many schools have been closed for the past two weeks, leaving about two million children without access to education.\n\n\"Thousands of people already facing the consequences of severe food insecurity could be further impacted, with food assistance unable to reach them,\" the spokesman said.\n\nOn October 15, the UN will officially shut down the 1,000-strong police force known as MINUJUSTH and replace it with a smaller UN political presence, even though it admits the Caribbean nation faces major problems.\n\nMINUJUSTH was deployed in 2017, replacing the full-fledged MINUSTAH peacekeeping mission, which was sent after a devastating 2010 earthquake.", "description": "The United Nations called Thursday for calm in crisis-wracked Haiti, eight days before the end of its police mission in the country.
