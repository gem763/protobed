HBO has chosen not to move forward with its intended Game of Thrones prequel series, which starred Naomi Watts as a \u201ccharismatic socialite hiding a dark secret.\u201d Per Deadline, the network reportedly didn\u2019t love the pilot that was shot earlier this year in Northern Ireland because of various filming \u201cissues,\u201d and showrunner Jane Goldman has been contacting the cast and crew to inform them that the series is really, truly dead. The pilot, co-written by Goldman and GoT\u2019s very own George R.R. Martin, was set about 10,000 years prior to the start of the original series, near the end of the Age of Heroes. Don\u2019t be too bummed, though: There are four other GoT-adjacent shows still floating around the network, and Martin seems pretty optimistic about their success. Still, justice for Watts is required!", "description": "HBO has decided it won\u2019t move forward with a Game of Thrones prequel starring Naomi Watts, despite heavy buzz.", "authors": ["Devon Ivie"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/29/29-naomi-watts.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
