Vazquez was expected to be arraigned Wednesday in Westmoreland County, though it was uncertain whether he would attend the hearing in person or do it via video from the Allegheny County Jail. Vazquez has been in the jail since surrendering to authorities Tuesday on a felony warrant issued in Florida stemming from illicit electronic communication with the same girl.\n\nVazquez began talking to the girl on social media in 2017 before driving to her house in Westmoreland County, outside Pittsburgh, a state police trooper wrote in court papers.\n\nIn an interview with troopers last month, she said she got in Vazquez's car, he removed her pants and tried to have sex with her, the trooper wrote. On Tuesday, troopers interviewed Vazquez at his residence and wrote that he admitted to driving to the girl's house and trying to have sex with her. Troopers also said Vazquez admitted receiving explicit photos of the girl by cellphone and texting her explicit messages as recently as July.\n\nDenied bond\n\nPennsylvania authorities began investigating the 28-year-old Vazquez in August after being contacted by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The victim's mother contacted Florida officials after learning of an alleged sexual relationship between Vazquez and a teenage girl living in Lee County, Fla.\n\nThe arrest warrant from Florida accuses Vazquez of one count of computer pornography/solicitation of a child and one count of providing obscene material to minors. Pennsylvania officials do not plan to pursue extradition until their investigation is completed.\n\nVazquez was denied bond during a hearing Tuesday on the Florida charges, with the judge saying the Venezuelan-born Vazquez was a flight risk.\n\nMajor League Baseball placed Vazquez on administrative leave under its agreement with the players' association on handling domestic violence, sexual assault and child abuse. Administrative leave is not considered discipline. Vazquez goes on the restricted list and continues to receive his $4 million US salary but is ineligible to play.\n\nWorkers removed a banner depicting Vazquez from outside PNC Park before the Pirates lost to Seattle on Tuesday night. Team president Frank Coonelly, general manager Neal Huntington and manager Clint Hurdle addressed the players in a pre-game meeting and there was a sombre mood in the clubhouse afterward. By the time the game ended, Vazquez's locker had been cleaned out and given to another player.", "description": "Pittsburgh Pirates closer Felipe Vazquez was being held Wednesday in a Pennsylvania jail on multiple felony charges after allegedly telling investigators he attempted to have sex with an underage girl during a meeting at her house in 2017.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5288739.1568834278!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/vazquez-felipe-190220-1180.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
