The company confirmed to The Verge that the new Pixel 4 phone won\u2019t support Daydream, and Google told Variety and The Verge that it will also no longer sell the Daydream View mobile headset. It will continue to support the app \u2014 which only works on older phones \u2014 for existing users.\n\n\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been the broad consumer or developer adoption we had hoped, and we\u2019ve seen decreasing usage over time of the Daydream View headset,\u201d a spokesperson said. Although the system had potential, \u201cwe noticed some clear limitations constraining smartphone VR from being a viable long-term solution,\u201d said the spokesperson. \u201cMost notably, asking people to put their phone in a headset and lose access to the apps they use throughout the day causes immense friction.\u201d That echoes similar complaints about Daydream\u2019s biggest competition, the Samsung Gear VR.\n\nGoogle launched the Daydream View alongside the first Pixel phone in 2016, and several other phone makers \u2014 including Samsung \u2014 added support for it over the years. But Google\u2019s midrange Pixel 3A wasn\u2019t compatible with Daydream, and no phones released this year have supported it either. Google has made forays into releasing standalone virtual reality headsets with the Lenovo Mirage Solo, but it\u2019s largely shifted its focus away from VR hardware, focusing on phone-based augmented reality and on VR apps like the painting tool Tilt Brush.", "description": "Google will stop selling the Daydream View mobile virtual reality headset, and its new Pixel 4 phone will not support the platform, following low adoption among Android users.", "authors": ["Adi Robertson", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ed3yVOAIRoNRq9mspp1FDIRPVcw=/0x0:2040x1068/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9474759/akrales_171013_2063_0131.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
