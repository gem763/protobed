But a planned sale of the facility to a new electric truck startup called Lordstown Motors, which is partially owned by struggling electric vehicle maker Workhorse Group, is still on, The Verge has learned.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still our intention to sell the plant to Lordstown Motors,\u201d Jim Cain, GM\u2019s senior manager for sales and executive communications, tells The Verge.\n\nNews of the sale to Workhorse was first announced by President Trump in May, who touted it as \u201cGREAT NEWS FOR OHIO!\u201d The president had previously berated GM for wanting to close the Lordstown plant, which was used to build the Chevy Cruze sedan, even going so far as to threaten that his administration would treat the automaker poorly.\n\nRelated GM is trying to sell a closed factory to troubled EV startup Workhorse\n\nThe potential sale was initially seen as a boon for Workhorse, which was in some serious financial trouble at the time of the announcement. Despite having struck deals selling electric vans to Ryder and UPS, Workhorse has never been profitable. It is in competition to be selected as the vehicle maker for the United States Postal Service\u2019s new vehicle, but in the meantime, the company posted a $36.5 million loss in 2018, and has seen losses accelerate in the first two quarters of 2019. Workhorse also recently sold off its budding passenger drone division for $4 million cash.\n\nWorkhorse itself isn\u2019t trying to buy the factory, though. Instead, former Workhorse CEO Steve Burns founded a new startup called Lordstown Motors, which is partially owned by Workhorse. He\u2019s spent the last few months trying to solicit investment for the purchase, and even recently hired Tesla\u2019s former director of manufacturing operations.\n\nRepresentatives for Workhorse and the UAW did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nBeyond the financial barrier, the deal between GM and the UAW still needs to be ratified by the union\u2019s workforce \u2014 some of whom have already tried to push back on the closure of the Lordstown plant as a union shop.", "description": "General Motors has reached an agreement with the United Auto Workers to end a month-long strike, and the automaker\u2019s idling manufacturing facility in Lordstown, Ohio will officially close as part of the deal.
