High Level Panel on Digital Cooperation established by Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to have the United Nations be the convening power to bring together the private sector, public sector, academia, researchers, scientists, developers and civil society to discuss problems in digital technology.\n\n\"The technology is going too fast, and we have not yet a clear solution to the challenges,\" she said.\n\nCompanies now go to their ethics offices with problems, she said, but ethics differ in different parts of the world.\n\n\"We need to have a common response. So that's why many people are thinking, do we need some regulations? Do we need to respond to this global challenge in a more concerted and multilateral way?\" Bachelet said.\n\nOn the global climate crisis, Bachelet said she is determined to help countries and organizations prevent, mitigate and adapt to climate change \"with human rights based policies\" and to encourage greater acceptance of \"the human right to a healthy environment.\"\n\nShe said her office is working with the U.N. Environment Program and with the U.N. World Health Organization \"to advance the human right to health.\"\n\nBachelet rejected the contention of some countries that climate change isn't in her agency's mandate. \"Climate change today is producing lots of human rights violations and lots of challenges,\" she said.\n\nAs an example, she cited droughts and floods that in many instances mean food insecurity, internal displacement, conflicts and fights over water in many parts of the world. All are human rights issues, she said.", "description": "The U.N. human rights chief said Tuesday the world is witnessing increasing hate speech, rising challenges to international cooperation, and pushbacks on women's equality and the rights of minorities.", "authors": ["Edith M.
