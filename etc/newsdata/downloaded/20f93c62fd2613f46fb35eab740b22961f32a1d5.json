It is really rare.\n\n\u201cIt not that I want to see players sent off. The best players are quick technicians and it should not be possible if you take them down this way you get a second chance.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it. It is more a general thing than this. It looked to me in the moment completely on purpose - he is away, stop the situation.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nLiverpool waited until swelling around Salah's ankle had reduced to run scans, but were fairly hopeful of there not being a severe outcome.\n\nSalah now has the international break to recover from his injury, after he was left out of the Egypt squad for their friendly with Bostwana in order to rest.\n\nLiverpool are not due in action again until they face Man Utd at Old Trafford on October 20, giving him a full fortnight to prepare.", "description": "The Liverpool forward limped out of Saturday's game after a robust challenge from the Leicester man", "authors": ["Darren Wells", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20528845.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Premier-League-Liverpool-v-Leicester-City.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
