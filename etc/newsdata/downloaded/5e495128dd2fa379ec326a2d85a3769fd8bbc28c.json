He know, he knows, that there were a bunch of different reasons why the election turned out the way it did and I take responsibility for those parts of it that I should,\" Clinton said on \"CBS Sunday Morning.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s like applying for a job and getting 6 million of letters of recommendation and losing to a corrupt human tornado. And so, I know that he knows that this wasn't on the level,\" she continued, adding that is the reason, \"he\u2019s obsessed with me and I believe it\u2019s a guilty conscience in so much as he has a conscience.\"\n\nWith the new whistleblower complaint and the release of the transcript of Trump's call between him and Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky, Clinton voiced her support for opening an impeachment inquiry. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi officially endorsed the inquiry this past week.\n\n\"There should be an impeachment inquiry opened. I don\u2019t care who you're for in the Democratic primary or whether Republican. When the president of the United States has taken an oath to protect and defend the Constitution and by that, defend the American people and their interests, uses his position to in effect extort a foreign government for his own political purposes, I think that is very much what the Founders were worried about,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen asked what would happen if there is another four years of a Trump presidency, Clinton replied, \"I don\u2019t accept that or believe that will happen. I believe there were many funny things that happened in my election that will not happen again and I\u2019m hoping both the public and press understand the way Trump plays this game.\"\n\nWhen talking about elections in Afghanistan on Friday, Clinton made a jab at the integrity of elections within the United States because like Afghanistan, \"you know we have little experience ourselves with not perfect elections.\"", "description": ".09/29/2019 19:25:20PM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/272/fe7dd799-c8c5-4cc8-88be-012e61f8a451.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
