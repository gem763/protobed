Neumann was the face and voice of the company, but his questionable leadership style coupled with the astronomical losses WeWork was racking up created what the CEO acknowledged was a \"significant distraction\" for the business.\n\nThe co-CEOs named to replace him, Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham, are veterans of the media and tech industries but have never held the top position at prior employers. They're now tasked with righting a 15,000-person company that recorded more than $800 million in revenue in the latest quarter and, according to Tuesday's press release, is generating over $4 billion in annualized sales, but lost over $600 million in the June quarter.\n\nThe IPO is now unlikely to take place this year, though it's still a possibility, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the plans are confidential. WeWork said in a statement last week that it still planned to go public in 2019.\n\nAs WeWork reworks its story for Wall Street and determines what public market investors are willing to pay, here's what you need to know about Minson and Gunningham.", "description": "In announcing that co-founder Adam Neumann is stepping down, WeWork elevated Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham to the co-CEO positions.", "authors": ["Ari Levy Eugene Kim", "Ari Levy", "Eugene Kim"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106146559-1569347184445gettyimages-528264528.jpeg?v=1569347244", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
