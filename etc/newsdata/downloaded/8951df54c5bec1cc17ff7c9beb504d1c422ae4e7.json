The figure is slightly up on the series five opener which hit 3.7 million.\n\nSeries four, which was shown on BBC Two along with the previous three series, had an average of 3.3 million viewers.\n\nIn her four-star review for Metro, Tilly Pearce was already looking forward to season six.\n\n\"We've somehow blinked and an entire season of Peaky Blinders is over and done with for another season, but dear God what a way to go,\" wrote Pearce.\n\nImage caption Sam Claflin as Tommy's political rival Oswald Mosley was a central figure in the series\n\n\"The mental health of the Shelby boys has been at play throughout the past six episodes.\n\n\"There is a lot to tie up next season... it would be good to have someone around to take the sting out of the bleakness.\n\n\"This episode is Peaky at its best - surprising even with the expected, keeps you on your toes and leaves you wanting more. Bring on season six gang, we'll be waiting.\"\n\nMeanwhile Louisa Mellor, writing for Den of Geek, enjoyed the series but was left exhausted by the twists and turns in the plot.\n\n\"It was a heady, chaotic series, with multiplying plotlines and more enemies than we could count, in total contrast to the neat, simplified threat of Luca Changretta and his men in series four,\" she said.\n\nLoose ends\n\nMellor also noted that this series had mainly focused on the unravelling of Tommy Shelby, played by Cillian Murphy.\n\nThe unanswered questions from this series also proved a stumbling block for Michael Hogan in The Telegraph.\n\nHogan said the \"disappointing\" finale left viewers \"dangling\" in his two-star review.\n\n\"[Previous] Peaky Blinders finales had become a little formulaic, certainly,\" he added.\n\nImage caption Helen McCrory, who plays Polly, is the Shelby family matriarch\n\n\"The fifth was jarringly different, as writer Steven Knight shook up his own formula.\n\n\"But lots of loose ends were left dangling... roll credits and doom-laden Nick Cave theme song. Now bring on series six and soon. We need answers.\"\n\nHogan's thoughts were echoed by some fans on Twitter (spoiler alert).\n\nSkip Twitter post by @GeorgiaEH17 Who\u2019s the black cat?
