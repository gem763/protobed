Your contact was unnecessary, flagrant and should have been avoided. For your actions, you were penalized and disqualified from the game. Following each of your previous rule violations, you were warned by me and each of the jointly-appointed appeal officers that future violations would result in escalated accountability measures. However, you have continued to flagrantly abuse rules designed to protect yourself and your opponents from unnecessary risk,\u201d Runyan wrote.\n\nRaiders coach Jon Gruden, who wasted no time signing Burfict the day after he was released by the Cincinnati Bengals in March, isn\u2019t happy with the league.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not happy about it\u2019\n\nSpeaking after the Raiders\u2019 practice in London on Wednesday, Gruden was asked about Burfict\u2019s punishment.\n\n\u201cI'm not really gonna say anything,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cI've talked to Runyan and the league office, he knows how I feel. It hurts our team really bad. I'm anxious to see what the appeal says. I'm not happy about it \u2014 at all. I don't want to say anything else, I'm obviously upset about it.\u201d\n\n(No word on him being upset with Burfict, who, you know, could have prevented all of this.)\n\nBurfict had been fined 11 times and suspended for a total of 10 games before joining Oakland, so it\u2019s not like the Raiders didn\u2019t know the player they were getting. Of course, Gruden and general manager Mike Mayock also signed Richie Incognito, so high-character veterans don\u2019t seem to be a priority.\n\n\u2018I think that\u2019s a little excessive\u2019\n\nGruden wasn\u2019t the only one defending Burfict. Raiders quarterback Derek Carr called Burfict \u201cmisunderstood\u201d on Wednesday, which is an odd choice of words since Burfict wasn\u2019t suspended for having a quirky personality, he was suspended for repeatedly ignoring the rules meant to keep his opponents and himself safer.\n\n\u201cI don't think he was trying to hurt that man,\u201d Carr said of Burfict's hit on Doyle. \u201cWe see other people choking people out [Baltimore\u2019s Marlon Humphrey on Cleveland\u2019s Odell Beckham Jr.] and they're going to play this Sunday. We see other people hitting people in the helmets and they're going to play this Sunday. And Vontaze Burfict won't play the rest of the year, I think that's a little excessive if you ask me. I don't think it's fair.\n\n\u201cHe's a great person, his heart is broken because he's not playing football. The guy just wants to play football.\u201d\n\nA dozen games might be excessive, and Burfict will appeal. But it\u2019s disingenuous to act as though Burfict got the suspension he did out of the blue.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Derek Carr also isn't happy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/NPA3ndcNl7CMUwRmDqsIuA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03ODEuODY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KN824YiQfZE_Dz8YfnGUHw--~B/aD0zNjY0O3c9NTk5NztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/87d08720-e552-11e9-b2ff-adc58af613b9"}
