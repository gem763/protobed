Just last week Apple had approved the HKmap.live app, after rejecting it earlier this month.\n\nIn a statement, Apple said it withdrew the app because it had been used to ambush the police and endanger citizens.\n\n\u201cThe app displays police locations and we have verified with the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau [CSTCB] that the app has been used to target and ambush police, threaten public safety, and criminals have used it to victimize residents in areas where they know there is no law enforcement,\u201d the statement said, according to Reuters.\n\nA Twitter account purportedly run by the developers disagreed with the claims. \u201cThere is 0 evidence to support CSTCB\u2019s accusation that HKmap App has been used to target and ambush police, [or] threaten public safety.\u201d\n\nThe app does not \u201csolicit, promote, or encourage criminal activity,\u201d they added.\n\nHkmap.live, which debuted a desktop version in early August, continued to load on web browsers Thursday. Previously downloaded versions of the app also appeared to still be working.\n\n\u201cThe majority of user review[s] in App Store \u2026 suggest HKmap IMPROVED public safety, not the opposite,\u201d the tweets said.\n\nThe app removal comes after Communist Party mouthpiece People\u2019s Daily accused Apple of enabling illegal behavior in Hong Kong and \u201cnot telling right from wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs Apple \u2026 opening the door for the violent protesters that are ruining Hong Kong, with the intention of being an \u2018accomplice?'\u201d says the strongly worded commentary published Tuesday.\n\nThe state media outlet also warned Apple that it may endanger its reputation among Chinese consumers. \u201cThis recklessness will cause much trouble for Apple,\u201d it said. \u201cApple needs to think deeply.\u201d\n\nRead more: The China-NBA Spat Underscores Just How Far Sino-U.S. Relations Have Deteriorated\n\nApple has joined a growing list of international brands that have had to navigate Beijing\u2019s ire while chasing access to China\u2019s 1.4 billion potential consumers. Last Friday, after Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted support for the city\u2019s protests, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV cut ties with the NBA and announced it would not be broadcasting preseason games on its network.\n\nEarlier this week, video game company Blizzard Entertainment banned a professional Hearthstone gamer after he donned a gas mask and chanted \u201cLiberate Hong Kong, Revolution of our time,\u201d a slogan commonly chanted by the city\u2019s demonstrators.\n\nWrite to Hillary Leung at hillary.leung@time.com.", "description": "Apple said the app, HKmap.live, has been \"used in ways that endanger law enforcement and residents in Hong Kong\"", "authors": ["Hillary Leung", "Hong Kong"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/hong-kong-police.jpg?quality=85&crop=0px%2C128px%2C1024px%2C536px&resize=1200%2C628&strip", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
