Jason Wambsgans/Chicago Tribune via AP)\n\nChicago's effort to make former \"Empire\" actor Jussie Smollett pay a six-figure civil fine for allegedly wasting police time on an alleged hoax hate-crime claim survived Tuesday, after a federal judge denied Smollett's motion to dismiss, according to The Associated Press.\n\nSmollett's lawyers sought to have the lawsuit thrown out on multiple grounds, including that Smollett himself did not direct Chicago police to spend weeks investigating his claim and could not have known how much time and money would be spent.\n\nIn ruling, U.S. District Judge Virginia Kendall said that if someone falsely claimed a racist and homophobic attack, it isn\u2019t unreasonable to think the Chicago police wouldn't spend the hours necessary to investigate it.\n\nJudge Kendall denies #JussieSmollett lawyers request to dismiss the case. Saying, if someone was going to falsely claim a racist and homophobic attack, it isn\u2019t unreasonable to think the @Chicago_Police wouldn\u2019t spend the hours necessary to investigate it. Moving to discovery. https://t.co/Qv6t9GwioL \u2014 Rafer Weigel (@RaferWeigel) October 22, 2019\n\nThe ruling allows the lawsuit to proceed and the case moves to the discovery phase. It could go to a civil trial by 2020.\n\nSmollett claimed he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack in downtown Chicago in January. But after several weeks of investigation, Chicago police claimed that he made the whole thing up, hiring two brothers to pretend-attack him in order to boost his profile and paycheck on \"Empire.\"\n\nHe was indicted on 16 felony counts of filing a false police report, but prosecutors in the Cook County State's Attorney's office abruptly dropped the charges, to the surprise and loud fury of practically everybody, including the city's mayor, police chief, police unions, judges, and other state prosecutors.\n\nSmollett continues to insist he is innocent and was exonerated. Earlier this month, he posted a comment on Instagram responding after comparisons were made on social media between Smollett and a 12-year-old Virginia girl whose family admitted she made up her claim that white students held her down and cut her dreadlocks.\n\n\u201cWith all due respect brother, y\u2019all can clown me all you want but my story has actually never changed and I haven\u2019t lied about a thing,\u201d Smollett wrote on the post. \u201cY\u2019all can continue to be misinformed, internalized sheep, who believe what actual proven liars feed you or you can read the actual docs. Either way, Imma be alright. I know me and what happened. You don\u2019t. So carry on. All Love.\"\n\nBut State's Attorney Kim Foxx rejected Smollett's assertion he was exonerated. She said saying dismissing the charges and imposing a $10,000 fine on Smollett was in line with how similar cases involving first-time offenders had been handled in the past.\n\nFoxx is now being investigated by an independent special prosecutor for her handling of the Smollett case.\n\nJussie Smollett: attorneys argue lawsuit for cost of police investigation should be tossed\n\nCook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx at the courthouse in Chicago, Feb. 23, 2019. (Photo: Ashlee Rezin/ AP)\n\nMeanwhile, the city of Chicago went to state court in April to sue Smollett to recoup the cost in police overtime \u2013 set at $130,000 \u2013 in investigating his original claims.\n\nThe lawsuit was later moved to federal court after Smollett's attorneys argued that is the proper venue because Smollett, who lived in Chicago while filming \"Empire,\" is actually a California resident.\n\n\"Empire\" is in its sixth and final season, and Smollett lost his role on the show shortly after the scandal hit headlines.\n\nThe city sued Smollett in civil court under a municipal code that allows the city to impose fines on people who make \"false statements\" to authorities, thus wasting time and money. If it prevails, the city could collect up to three times the amount of damages the city sustains as a result of the violation \u2013 in Smollett\u2019s case, that would be $390,000.\n\nSmollett's lawyer, Mark Geragos, responded to the city's suit with defiance. In court documents, he called the city's stance \"unconstitutional,\" \"malicious,\" \"false and defamatory,\" harassment and a violation of \"double jeopardy\" bans.\n\n'I miss him': How 'Empire' addressed writing off Jussie Smollett's character\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/22/jussie-smollett-chicago-lawsuit-actor-still-facing-130-k-civil-suit/4000512002/", "description": "Jussie Smollett failed to persuade a federal judge to dismiss a civil suit by city seeking $130,000 for wasting police time.", "authors": ["Maria Puente", "Published A.M.
