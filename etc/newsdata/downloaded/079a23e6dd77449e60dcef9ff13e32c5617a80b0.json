Toensing had previously represented witnesses who had already communicated with special counsel Robert Mueller's team.\n\nDiGenova and Toensing have controversial reputations for pushing conspiracy theories about the Department of Justice and the FBI, including that officials within the FBI have tried to \"frame\" Trump for \"nonexistent crimes.\"\n\nDiGenova also called for the firing of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, referred to Mueller's team as \"legal terrorists,\" and called former FBI Director James Comey a \"dirty cop.\" In February, on conservative personality Laura Ingraham's podcast, diGenova said the US is in a civil war, and suggested that people buy guns to prepare for potential combat between warring factions.\n\nLawyer and former US District Attorney Joseph diGenova has been a repeat guest on Fox News.

In a July 25 phone call, a partial transcript of which has been released by the Trump administration, the president pressured Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.\n\nHunter Biden served on the board of executives of a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma Holdings, during Joe Biden's tenure as Vice President. The then-VP pressured the Ukranian government to fire a top Ukranian prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, for blocking corruption investigations.\n\nTrump and Giuliani have claimed, despite contradictory timelines, that Biden sought Shokin's removal from his position because Shokin was attempting to investigate corruption involving his son and Burisma Holdings.\n\nCalls for Trump's impeachment note that he withheld $400 million in foreign aid from Ukraine in the process of asking for damaging information about his 2020 presidential contender. The president could potentially be breaking four laws: illegally soliciting campaign help from a foreign government, bribery, misappropriation, and conspiracy.\n\ndiGenova & Toensing, LLP didn't immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.", "description": "Fox News' Chris Wallace reports that Trump worked \"off the books\" with two lawyers, Joseph diGenova and Victoria Toensing, to pressure Ukraine.", "authors": ["Kat Tenbarge"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d90e6062e22af38bf397278-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
