Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-TX) falsely claimed Tuesday night during the Democrat presidential debate that Russia is \u201cinvading\u201d America.\n\nHowever, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s characterization of Russia\u2019s involvement in the 2016 election does not amount to what most Americans, or a dictionary, might describe as an invasion.\n\nDuring special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into alleged Russian collusion with the 2016 Donald Trump campaign, a dozen Russians were charged with hacking and leaking the emails of senior Democrats.\n\nThen-Deputy Department of Justice Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said that the indicted Russians committed \u201celection interference,\u201d not an invasion.\n\n\u201cThe blame for election interference belongs to the criminals who committed election interference,\u201d Rosenstein said.\n\nMueller\u2019s investigation also found that the Trump campaign did not collude with the Russian government during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nHowever, Russian President Vladimir Putin did joke that he will \u201cdefinitely\u201d interfere in the 2020 presidential election.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you a secret: Yes, we\u2019ll definitely do it,\u201d Putin sarcastically responded to a question from an NBC News reporter when asked about possible Russian interference in the 2020 elections. \u201cJust don\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d\n\nPutin added, \u201cYou know, we have enough of our own problems. We are engaged in resolving internal problems and are primarily focused on this.\u201d", "description": "Former Rep.
