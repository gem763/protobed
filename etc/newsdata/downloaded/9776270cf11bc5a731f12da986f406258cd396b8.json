They asked whether Giuliani, who is President Donald Trump's personal attorney, had business dealings with Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman.\n\nThe Ukrainian-born Parnas and Fruman of Belarus are accused of conspiring to circumvent federal campaign financing laws by funneling foreign money to U.S. political candidates and committees in a scheme to buy influence.\n\nThe two men, who now live in Florida, played instrumental roles in connecting Giuliani with Ukrainian officials as Giuliani sought information about the financial dealings there of Hunter Biden, the son of former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden \u2013 one of Trump\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign challengers.\n\nParnas and Fruman were arrested last week as they tried to board a flight out of the country. They're in federal custody on $1 million bonds and have not yet entered pleas to the charges. They are scheduled to appear in a New York City federal court Thursday.\n\nMcCallion said he \u201cwas asked a lot of questions by FBI and other counterintelligence investigators who were looking at Giuliani\u2019s comings and goings in Ukraine and business dealings.\u201d\n\n\"They were interested in the nature of any business dealings with them,\" McCallion said, referring to Parnas and Fruman.\n\nHe said he has not been involved in any business or legal matters with Giuliani.\n\nGiuliani, who has said Parnas and Fruman are his clients, said Tuesday he had \"no such knowledge\" of a federal inquiry involving him.\n\nAsked whether he was aware that agents had questioned the New York attorney about his dealings with Parnas and Fruman, Giuliani said, \"No.\"\n\nImpeachment inquiry: Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump's personal lawyer, defies subpoena in impeachment inquiry\n\nA person familiar with the matter said federal authorities have been examining Giuliani\u2019s activities as part of the investigation involving Parnas and Fruman,\n\nThe person, who is not authorized to comment publicly, did not know whether that inquiry ranged beyond Giuliani\u2019s association with the two men.\n\nTies under scrutiny: Criminal case against Giuliani's associates darkens cloud over Trump's personal attorney, White House\n\nLate last week, The New York Times reported that federal prosecutors are investigating Giuliani for potential lobbying law violations as it relates to his work in Ukraine. The Times reported that the probe focuses on Giuliani's efforts to \"undermine\" former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie L. Yovanovitch, who testified before three House committees Friday as part of the House impeachment inquiry of Trump.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Monday that investigators have been examining Giuliani\u2019s finances, including bank records related to his work in Ukraine, since at least August.\n\nTuesday afternoon, Giuliani's lawyer informed House Democrats that he wouldn't comply with a subpoena to produce documents related to his dealings on behalf of Trump in Ukraine.\n\nThe committees demanded documents from Giuliani dealing with \"the extent to which President Trump jeopardized national security by pressing Ukraine to interfere with our 2020 election and by withholding security assistance provided by Congress to help Ukraine counter Russian aggression.\"\n\nThese images provided by the Alexandria Sheriff\u2019s Office show booking mugshots of Igor Fruman (left) and Lev Parnas, associates of Rudy Giuliani who were arrested on an indictment that includes charges of violating campaign finance laws.

In June 2017, he delivered a speech called \u201cGlobal Challenge, the Role of the U.S. and the Place of Ukraine,\u201d according to a post on the website of the Pinchuk Foundation.\n\nVictor Pinchuk, a billionaire and the son of a former Ukrainian president, moderated the event and invited future Ukrainian leaders \u201cto shape the proper messages that Mr. Giuliani would bring\u201d to the U.S., the foundation said on its website.\n\nGiuliani met with Ukraine government officials, including then-President Petro Poroshenko and Yuriy Lutsenko, the then-prosecutor general, the post said.\n\nGiuliani subsequently met with Lutsenko in January 2019 in New York and a month later in Warsaw, Poland, according to a whistleblower complaint that has triggered a House impeachment inquiry proceeding against Trump.\n\n'Foreign agent'?: Trump-Ukraine scandal puts spotlight on Rudy Giuliani's business ties.\n\nIn a series of reports published in The Hill in March and April, Lutsenko and other Ukrainian officials made claims about purported Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 presidential election and former Vice President Biden\u2019s purported efforts to protect Ukraine business interests of his son, Hunter. Neither allegation has been substantiated.\n\nLutsenko also claimed that Marie Yovanovitch gave him a do-not-prosecute list of subjects in Ukraine. Lutsenko has since recanted that allegation, and several Ukrainian officials have told USA TODAY he's not credible. He has not responded to requests for comment.\n\nDispatch from Ukraine: Trump's conspiracy theories thrive in Ukraine, where a young democracy battles corruption and distrust\n\nParnas and Fruman, according to Ukrainian media reports, helped arrange Lutsenko's New York meeting with Giuliani.\n\nFeds zeroed in on donation to pro-Trump political action committee\n\nThe pair's sizable campaign contributions in the U.S. have attracted the scrutiny of federal election authorities. Their company, Global Energy Producers, was credited with giving $325,000 to a pro-Trump political action committee in May 2018.\n\nThat same month, Parnas posted photos on Facebook of him and Fruman with President Trump in the White House and with Donald Trump Jr. in California.\n\nAlthough Global Energy Partners was identified as the source of the contribution to America First Action SuperPAC, financial records show that the money came via a circuitous route through another company linked to Fruman, according to a federal indictment.\n\nProsecutors allege that Parnas and Fruman gave $5,400 to a U.S. congressman and pledged to raise another $20,000 as they sought his help in removing Yovanovitch as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nThat congressman is U.S. Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, who wrote a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urging Yovanovitch's removal.\n\nAfter Parnas and Fruman were arrested, Sessions said he didn't know about the alleged scheme and would donate their contributions to charity.\n\nSessions responds: Former GOP Rep Pete Sessions donates tainted money from Giuliani associates to charity\n\nCLOSE Two associates of Giuliani have been charged with funneling foreign money to U.S. political campaigns, and President Trump says he doesn't know them. USA TODAY\n\nAttorney General knew about investigation into Parnas and Fruman\n\nLast week, Trump denied knowing Parnas and Fruman, dismissing the photographs and suggesting that reporters refer their questions to Giuliani.\n\n\"I don't know them,\" Trump said. \"I don't know about them, I don't know what they do. ... Maybe they were clients of Rudy. You'd have to ask Rudy. I just don't know.\"\n\nIndeed, until last week, Parnas and Fruman were not household names in the myriad political dramas buffeting Trump\u2019s presidency. But they had been on the radar of federal prosecutors for months.\n\nShortly after his Senate confirmation in February, Attorney General William Barr was generally alerted to the criminal investigation involving Parnas and Fruman, a Justice official said.\n\nThe official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said Barr was updated in the weeks before the men were arrested, and he was notified last week when they were taken into custody at Dulles International Airport.\n\nIt is not clear whether those updates included any discussion about Giuliani\u2019s relationship with the two men.\n\nContributing: David Jackson\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/15/trump-lawyer-rudy-giuliani-ukraine-business-investigation/3986079002/", "description": "Federal examination of Rudy Giuliani's dealings with Ukraine associates date to early 2019; NY lawyer questioned by FBI", "authors": ["Kevin Mccoy", "Kevin Johnson", "Published P.M.
