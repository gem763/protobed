Two people died and others are seriously injured. (CHEK News)\n\nDenise Helm, the university's media relations director, said there were 45 UVic students and two teaching assistants on the bus. Helm said they were headed on two-day field trip to the Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre.\n\nB.C. Emergency Health Services said 17 people were taken to hospital \u2014 two people in critical condition, one person in serious condition, and 14 others in stable condition \u2014 and about another 30 were transported from the crash.\n\nBurneau said some passengers were treated at a reception centre opened by Port Alberni, a city with fewer than 20,000 residents.\n\n1 still in hospital\n\nBy Saturday afternoon, University of Victoria provost Valerie Kuehne said one student is still in hospital. Kuehne also said the university is offering support services for students, staff and families.\n\nEarlier in the day the university said on Twitter it is \"deeply saddened\" by the death of the students.\n\nWe are deeply saddened by the death of two UVic students last night. Our heartfelt thoughts go out to the students\u2019 families and loved ones, to whom we offer our sincerest condolences.

He said it took two hours for ambulances to arrive.\n\nThere is no cellphone service on that stretch of the road, which is the primary route people use to get in and out of the small community of Bamfield, Dennis said.\n\nIt had been raining on and off that night, he said, and conditions on the narrow, gravel logging road aren't great at the best of times.\n\nHe said he has been calling for improvements to the road for years.\n\n\"I've been knocking on every Liberal government, every NDP government, to get our road fixed,\" he said.\n\nPassengers housed in town\n\nPort Alberni Chief Administrative Officer Tim Pley said the students on the bus who weren't injured were placed in hotels in Port Alberni for the night.\n\nSharie Minions, mayor of Port Alberni, said she is \"really proud\" of how city staff and others in the community stepped up to help.\n\nThey quickly opened an emergency centre, Minions said, and were able to feed the passengers and keep them warm. Later staff also helped the students get in touch with their families.\n\n\"it's a horrific accident,\" she said.\n\nAircraft deployed\n\nEarlier reports said the two passengers who died were airlifted to hospital, but Burneau later said it was the seriously injured passengers who were.\n\nThe JRCC deployed two helicopters and a search and rescue aircraft from Canadian Forces Base Comox to airlift patients from the scene.\n\nIn a tweet, the Port Alberni Fire Department says it also responded to the crash, along with RCMP.\n\nPAFD responding to a bus rollover between Port Alberni and Bamfield.
