General Assembly", "language": "en", "text": "UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to make his case for keeping pressure on Iran on Tuesday at a United Nations General Assembly speech made more dramatic by attacks on Saudi oil facilities that rattled the Middle East and raised concerns about a broader war.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump attends the \"Global Call to Protect Religious Freedom\" event at U.N. headquarters in New York City, New York, U.S., September 23, 2019. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nIt will be Trump\u2019s third appearance before world leaders gathered in the green-marbled U.N. chamber in New York and a host of global challenges are on his agenda, from North Korea to China and Venezuela.\n\nWith the president looking to improve his standing among Americans as he looks ahead to a tough re-election battle next year, Trump aims to present a reassuring message to ease voters\u2019 concerns about his tendency toward inflammatory rhetoric.\n\nThe top item for Trump in the morning address is Iran.\n\nTehran has been widely blamed for the attacks in Saudi Arabia 10 days ago. Over the past week, Trump has tightened economic sanctions on Iran and ordered more U.S. troops to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in a show of support for key allies in the tense region.\n\nHe has shown restraint on the use of military force against Iran over the Saudi attacks, resisting pressure from conservative hawks who believe Iran must be punished.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of pressure on them, more pressure than they\u2019ve ever had,\u201d he told reporters on Monday. \u201cA lot of things are happening with respect to Iran...I\u2019ll be discussing it a little bit tomorrow.\u201d\n\nTrump got some important backing at the United Nations on Monday when Britain, Germany and France blamed Iran for the Saudi attacks and urged Tehran to agree to new talks with world powers on its nuclear and missile programs.\n\n\u201cIt is clear to us that Iran bears responsibility for this attack. There is no other plausible explanation. We support ongoing investigations to establish further details,\u201d Britain, France and Germany said in a statement.\n\nBoth Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani will be in close proximity this week with both attending U.N. events. Rouhani is to address the body on Wednesday.\n\nThere has been plenty of speculation about a Trump-Rouhani meeting but nothing firm has yet emerged. Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said Iran would never hold such one-on-one talks but could engage in multilateral discussions if Washington returns to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.\n\n\u201cOur message to the world at the U.N. meeting is peace, stability and also we want to tell the world that the situation in the Persian Gulf is very sensitive,\u201d said Rouhani.\n\nEuropean leaders have struggled to defuse the brewing confrontation between Tehran and Washington since Trump abruptly withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal, which assured Iran access to world trade in return for curbs on its nuclear program.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke on Monday of a new Iran deal that would curb Iranian nuclear activities as well as its ballistic missile programs.\n\nJohnson told NBC News that Trump is the \u201cone guy\u201d who can broker the agreement.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron came to the U.N. looking to rekindle the mediation effort for talks between the United States and Iran that he began at the G7 summit he hosted in Biarritz, France, last month.\n\nWhile Trump welcomed the Johnson bid for a new Iran deal, he dismissed Macron\u2019s mediation effort in line with his belief that he does not need anyone to stand between him and Iran.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need a mediator,\u201d Trump told reporters on Monday. \u201cHe\u2019s (Macron) a friend of mine, but we\u2019re not looking for any mediators. They know who to call.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nWhile Trump has used his previous addresses to sound the alarm against threats from North Korea and Iran, he has stopped short of military action in most cases.\n\nHe has been tolerant of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s short-range missile tests, but said on Monday a third summit with Kim may depend on what kind of agreement can be sealed before such a summit were to take place - a significant change from his past tendency to meet and \u201csee what happens\u201d.\n\n\u201cI want to know what\u2019s going to be coming out of it,\u201d he said.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to make his case for keeping pressure on Iran on Tuesday at a United Nations General Assembly speech made more dramatic by attacks on Saudi oil facilities that rattled the Middle East and raised concerns about a broader war.", "authors": ["Steve Holland", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433207606&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N09X", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
