I\u2019ve tried to reach him since then, to discuss Parnas\u2019s and Fruman\u2019s arrests, among other things, to no avail. When I called at 3 p.m. ET to ask about his Vienna trip, a woman claiming to be his communications director answered the phone. I have called him more than 100 times over the past year, and this is the first time that has ever happened. She said she\u2019d have to get back to me. As we spoke, I could hear a voice that resembled Giuliani\u2019s shout \u201casshole\u201d in the background. \u201cOh, sorry,\u201d the woman told me. \u201cHe was talking to the TV.\u201d\n\nWhy were Parnas and Fruman bound for Vienna? Why was Giuliani\u2014if what he told me was true\u2014planning to be in the same city a day later?\n\nGiuliani finally sent me a text message at 4:18 p.m. ET: \u201cI can\u2019t comment on it at this time.\u201d\n\nRead: Rudy Giuliani: \u2018You should be happy for your country that I uncovered this\u2019\n\nParnas and Fruman, both Soviet-born, have been instrumental in helping Giuliani develop Ukrainian contacts in his quest to prove that Biden, while vice president, tried to curtail an investigation into a Ukrainian gas company for which his son Hunter Biden served on the board. Parnas told NPR, for example, that he was the one who had arranged a Skype call between Giuliani and former Ukrainian Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin to discuss their corruption theory. Parnas was also present at meetings in New York and Warsaw earlier this year with Giuliani and Yuriy Lutsenko, another former prosecutor general for Ukraine.\n\nI met Parnas and Fruman in March, when I joined Giuliani at Shelly\u2019s Back Room, a cigar bar in D.C., to discuss Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s soon-to-be-released report on Russian interference in the 2016 election. Sipping back-to-back glasses of Macallan\u2014double, one large ice cube\u2014and smoking a Nicaraguan cigar, Giuliani told me he\u2019d known Parnas for two years. Parnas laughed and said he\u2019d grown up \u201cidolizing\u201d Giuliani. They bantered about how the Mueller probe would likely amount to nothing, with Parnas adding that it was Trump\u2019s \u201cconstitutional right\u201d to fire former FBI Director James Comey. Save for introducing himself when I arrived, Fruman was quiet. Parnas told me they were all \u201cgreat friends\u201d and all \u201cwork together.\u201d\n\nAlong with allegedly using a shell company to donate hundreds of thousands of dollars to Republican candidates and a pro-Trump super PAC, Parnas and Fruman were also accused by federal prosectors of meddling in American political activities on behalf of one or more Ukrainian officials. In the 21-page indictment, prosecutors allege that Parnas and Fruman lobbied for the removal of the U.S. ambassador in Kiev, Marie Yovanovitch\u2014something Giuliani sought as well, arguing that she was biased against the president. In May, Trump ordered Yovanovitch\u2019s removal.", "description": "President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer told me he was planning to fly to Vienna roughly 24 hours after his business associates were arrested as they prepared to do the same.", "authors": ["Elaina Plott"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/Rudy/facebook.jpg?1570744286", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
