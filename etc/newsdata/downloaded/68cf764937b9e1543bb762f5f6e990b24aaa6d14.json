The decision to publish these details has grave and lifelong consequences.\"\n\nStokes went on to call the article the \"lowest form of journalism, focussed only on chasing sales with absolutely no regard for the devastation caused to lives as a consequence.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the newspaper told CNN by email: \"The Sun has the utmost sympathy for Ben Stokes and his mother but it is only right to point out the story was told with the co-operation of a family member who supplied details, provided photographs and posed for pictures.\n\n\"The tragedy is also a matter of public record and was the subject of extensive front page publicity in New Zealand at the time.\n\n\"The Sun has huge admiration for Ben Stokes and we were delighted to celebrate his sporting heroics this summer. He was contacted prior to publication and at no stage did he or his representatives ask us not to publish the story.\"", "description": "England's World Cup and Ashes cricket hero Ben Stokes has called The Sun newspaper's front-page story about a family tragedy \"heartless\" and \"utterly disgusting.\"", "authors": ["Cnn Sport"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190917123355-ben-stokes-sun-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
