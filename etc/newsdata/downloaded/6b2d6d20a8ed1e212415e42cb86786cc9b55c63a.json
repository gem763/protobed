The last few camps he's looked so much better in training.\n\n'He is such a talent it's hard to ignore. But it's very difficult for him to play 90 minutes and back-to-back games, because he's not had the minutes.'\n\nGiggs says he has not spoken to Chelsea manager Frank Lampard or anyone else at Stamford Bridge over Ampadu's situation at a club who are fifth in the German top flight.\n\nBut he is planning a scouting trip to Germany soon, with Schalke winger Rabbi Montondo and St Pauli defender James Lawrence also playing there.\n\nAmpadu is yet to make his debut for RB Leipzig despite being involved in matchday squads\n\n'Rabbi had an injury, then he had an infection into the injury,' Giggs said. 'So it was a difficult time for him.\n\n'But he scored his first goal the other week and he's a talent.\n\n'He's at a big club and hopefully he will get a run of games there. The speed he's got, he's an option, whether starting or off the bench.\n\n'We've got different scenarios abroad, with Ethan Rabbi and James in Germany and Gareth (Bale) and Aaron (Ramsey) in Spain and Italy.\n\n'It's a different situation for players. You've seen it work with the likes of Jadon Sancho, who have done well abroad.\n\n'I think it'll happen more and more, but they've got to play.'", "description": "Ethan Ampadu's pre-season move to the Bundesliga was hailed as a smart move given that the teenager has had limited opportunities since joining Chelsea from Exeter in 2017.", "authors": ["Phil Blanche"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/22/19464224-0-image-a-16_1570571831297.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
