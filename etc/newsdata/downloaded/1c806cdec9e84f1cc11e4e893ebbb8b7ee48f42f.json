Sam Aston is looking very smiley after all\u2026\n\nFollowing Sinead tragic death, leaving behind Daniel and their baby son Bertie, upcoming episodes will see Daniel struggle to organise the funeral.\n\nWanting to get away from the Street for a while, Daniel announces to his family that he is going to take Bertie to Scotland for a while for a break.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
