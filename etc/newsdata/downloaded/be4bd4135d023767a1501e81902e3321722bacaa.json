His nationality has not be revealed, and he is expected to receive some, if not all, of the $25 million bounty the U.S. had placed on al-Baghdadi.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGroomed as an asset by the Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), the agent was then transferred to U.S. forces where he was reportedly groomed for weeks to certify his authenticity.\n\nThe process of using the asset's knowledge started at the beginning of summer, but the chance to act on it only came within the past few weeks, The Post reported.\n\nAn official with knowledge of the situation told the newspaper \"it was assessed for quite a while that the person might have the key to the lock.\"\n\n\u201cThat only really seriously became clear within the last couple of weeks.\u201d\n\nThe Pentagon and White House have yet to officially comment on the reported mole. The Post based its report on information from two current and former U.S. officials and a Middle East-based official.\n\nOn Saturday, al-Baghdadi\u2019s compound was attacked by members of the military\u2019s elite Delta Force and 75th Ranger Regiment. Al-Baghdadi detonated his suicide vest, killing himself and three of his children, after being cornered in a tunnel by U.S. forces.", "description": "A U.S.\u00a0military operation that ended in the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was reportedly largely successful because of highly accurate intel provided by an inside informant.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/al-baghdadi_site_102719getty_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
