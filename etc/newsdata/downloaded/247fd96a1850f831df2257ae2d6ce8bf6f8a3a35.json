(AP) - There are two games Jacksonville Jaguars defensive end Yannick Ngakoue would like to erase from his resume - and his memory.\n\nBoth against Tennessee. Both in prime time. Both lopsided losses.\n\nThe Titans (1-1) have embarrassed the Jaguars (0-2) in each of their past two midweek games, jumping out to a 27-0 lead in October 2016 and running wild in a 30-9 victory last December.\n\nJacksonville would like to end the trend at home Thursday night.\n\n\u201cJust want to kind of change that feeling of losing to those guys,\u201d Ngakoue said. \u201cI know they feel like they\u2019ve got a number on us. We\u2019ve got to change that. That stigma, we\u2019ve got to change that, that outlook.\u201d\n\nTennessee has won four in a row and six of seven in the series, allowing a combined 41 points during the winning streak.\n\nDerrick Henry got the Titans rolling in the most recent beat-down, breaking four tackles on his way to the second 99-yard run in NFL history (Tony Dorsett, 1983). The 247-pound Henry sidestepped two defenders at the line of scrimmage, cut outside, stiff-armed cornerback A.J. Bouye and then tossed Leon Jacobs to the ground. Fellow linebacker Myles Jack had a final chance to knock Henry out of bounds around the 20-yard line, but failed to get it done.\n\nHenry finished with 238 yards and four touchdowns on 17 carries, but only one of those will be remembered.\n\nThe play ranked No. 89 in the NFL\u2019s \u201c100 Greatest Plays\u201d list recently released. It surely will be shown again during the broadcast Thursday.\n\nHenry, though, would rather be done with it.\n\n\u201cI am tired of seeing it,\u201d said Henry, who grew up near Jacksonville in Yulee. \u201cI know for sure they are.\u201d\n\nNo doubt.\n\nJaguars defensive coordinator Todd Wash opted to keep the clip out of film study this week.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to watch that again,\u201d Wash said. \u201cI see it on NFL Network all the time. My wife always brings it up. \u2018That wasn\u2019t a very good play.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Mr. Obvious, right?\u2019 \u2026 The bottom line is he made a play. Give credit to him, but we have to do a better job of stopping it this time.\u201d\n\nEven Henry has moved on.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s over with, man,\u201d Henry said. \u201cIt was a great moment. I appreciate it. I cherish it. But it\u2019s time to move on, man. It\u2019s over with.\u201d\n\nThe Jaguars hope to say the same about their losing ways - overall and in the series.\n\nJacksonville has dropped 12 of its past 14 games and is 0-2 for the first time in coach Doug Marrone\u2019s three years.\n\nThe Jaguars need a victory to salvage an awful start that included losing quarterback Nick Foles (broken collarbone) for at least two months and then having their best player, cornerback Jalen Ramsey, request a trade following a sideline argument with Marrone.\n\n\u201cWe need it bad,\u201d Bouye said. \u201cWe know what they\u2019ve done to us the last few years. \u2026 Once we get over that hump, I think it\u2019s going to help us.\u201d\n\nHere are some other things to know about the game:\n\nRAMSEY WATCH\n\nJaguars cornerback Jalen Ramsey walked out of practice Wednesday, stopped at one of the team golf carts, grabbed his cellphone and made a call. It appeared as if he was checking on the status of his trade request.\n\nA few minutes later, coach Doug Marrone said Ramsey will start against the Titans.\n\nMarrone also said he and Ramsey spoke for the first time since their sideline spat during Sunday\u2019s 13-12 loss at Houston.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like anything else in this profession: It\u2019s behind us now,\u201d Marrone said. \u201cHis focus is on playing and doing the best job for his teammates, and my job is to do the best for the team. That\u2019s behind us right now.\u201d\n\nERROR-FREE BALL\n\nThe Titans lead the NFL in turnover margin, with five takeaways and no turnovers. It\u2019s their best start in the category since 2013.\n\nFEW FLAGS\n\nTennessee was the least-penalized team in the NFL last season and is off to another strong start. The Titans have a league-low 11 penalties through two games. That ties them with Pittsburgh, Carolina and Indianapolis for the fewest. Since the start of the 2018 season, the Titans have only 93 penalties - 10 fewer than the next closest team.\n\nO-LINE SHUFFLE\n\nJaguars left tackle Cam Robinson (knee) will make his season debut, sending second-year pro Will Richardson to the bench. Richardson is expected to get some snaps at right guard while alternating series with A.J. Cann.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "There are two games Jacksonville Jaguars defensive end Yannick Ngakoue would like to erase from his resume - and his memory.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mark Long"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/17/jaguars_ramsey_football_74784_c0-118-2829-1767_s1770x1032.jpg?9784e57d7bb6a13105796d8fe7857fd70ee575a3", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
