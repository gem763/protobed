But Democrats were able to set closed-door depositions for Thursday for former special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker and next week for ousted U.S. Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch.\n\nThe escalating exchange of accusations and warnings signaled yet another stiffening in the confrontation between the executive and legislative branches amid the Democrats\u2019 launching of the impeachment inquiry late last week. That followed a national security whistleblower\u2019s disclosure of Trump\u2019s July phone call seeking help from the new Ukrainian president in investigating Democratic political rival Joe Biden and Biden\u2019s son Hunter.\n\nIn a Tuesday evening tweet, Trump cast the impeachment inquiry as a coup \u201cintended to take away the Power of the People, their VOTE, their Freedoms, their Second Amendment, Religion, Military, Border Wall, and their God-given rights as a Citizen of The United States of America!\u201d In fact, a coup is usually defined as a sudden, violent and illegal seizure of government power. The impeachment process is laid out in the U.S. Constitution.\n\nPompeo said the Democrats were trying to \u201cintimidate\u201d and \u201cbully\u201d the career officials into appearing and claimed it would be \u201cnot feasible\u201d as demanded. House investigators countered that it would be illegal for the secretary to try to protect Trump by preventing the officials from talking to Congress.\n\nSome Trump supporters cheered Pompeo\u2019s muscular response to the Democrats. But it also complicated the secretary\u2019s own situation, coming the day after it was disclosed that he had listened in during Trump\u2019s July phone call with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy that helped trigger the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cAny effort to intimidate witnesses or prevent them from talking with Congress \u2014 including State Department employees \u2014 is illegal and will constitute evidence of obstruction of the impeachment inquiry,\u201d said three House chairmen, Adam Schiff of the intelligence committee, Eliot Engel of Foreign Affairs, and Elijah Cummings of Oversight.\n\nThey said that if he was on Trump\u2019s call, \u201cSecretary Pompeo is now a fact witness in the House impeachment inquiry.\u201d And they warned, \u201cHe should immediately cease intimidating Department witnesses in order to protect himself and the President.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, the State Department\u2019s inspector general is expected to brief congressional staff from several House and Senate appropriations, oversight, foreign affairs and intelligence committees on their requests for information and documents on Ukraine, according to an aide familiar with the planning. The inspector general acts independently from Pompeo.\n\nThe committees are seeking voluntary testimony from the current and former officials as the House digs into State Department actions and Trump\u2019s other calls with foreign leaders that have been shielded from scrutiny.\n\nIn halting any appearances by State officials, and demanding that executive branch lawyers accompany them, Pompeo is underscoring Attorney General William Barr\u2019s expansive view of White House authority and setting a tone for conflicts to come.\n\n\u201cI will use all means at my disposal to prevent and expose any attempts to intimidate the dedicated professionals,\u201d Pompeo wrote.\n\nWhen issuing a separate subpoena last week as part of the inquiry, the chairmen of the three House committees made it clear that stonewalling their investigation would be fought.\n\n\u201cYour failure or refusal to comply with the subpoena shall constitute evidence of obstruction of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry,\u201d the three chairmen wrote.\n\nDemocrats often note that obstruction was one of the impeachment articles against Richard Nixon, who resigned the presidency in 1974 in the face of almost certain impeachment.\n\nVolker played a direct role in arranging meetings between Rudy Giuliani, who is Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, and Zelenskiy, the chairmen said.\n\nThe State Department said that Volker has confirmed that he put a Zelenskiy adviser in contact with Giuliani, at the Ukraine adviser\u2019s request.\n\nThe former envoy, who has since resigned his position and so is not necessarily bound by Pompeo\u2019s directions, is eager to appear as scheduled on Thursday, said one person familiar with the situation, but unauthorized to discuss it and granted anonymity. The career professional believes he acted appropriately and wants to tell his side of the situation, the person said.\n\nYovanovitch, the career diplomat whose abrupt recall from Ukraine earlier this year raised questions, is set to appear next week. The Democrats also want to hear from T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, a counselor at the State Department, who also listened in on the Trump-Zelenskiy call, they said.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Pompeo will comply with the committees\u2019 request for documents by Friday. He had declined to comply with their previous requests for information.\n\nPompeo, traveling in Italy to meet with the country\u2019s president and prime minister, ignored shouted question about the impeachment inquiry on Tuesday.\n\nThe House investigators are prepared for battle as they probe more deeply into the State Department to try to understand why the administration sought to restrict access to Trump\u2019s conversations with foreign leaders.\n\nThe whistleblower alleged in an Aug. 12 letter to Congress that the White House tried to \u201clock down\u201d Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with the new Ukrainian president because it was worried about the contents being leaked to the public.\n\nIn recent days, it has been disclosed that the administration similarly tried to restrict information about Trump\u2019s calls with other foreign leaders, including Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin and Saudi Arabia\u2019s Mohammed bin Salman, by moving memos onto a highly classified computer system.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be one heck of a fight to get that information,\u201d Schiff told House Democrats during a conference call over the weekend, according to a person granted anonymity to discuss the private session.\n\nAs Trump continued to rage against the impeachment inquiry, there was little evidence of a broader White House response. And few outside allies were rushing to defend the president.\n\nTrump has long measured allies\u2019 loyalty by their willingness to fight for him on TV, and he complained bitterly this week that few had done so. And those who did, including House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy on CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d he believed had flubbed their appearance, according to a person not authorized to publicly discuss private conversations.\n\nThough there has been growing discontent with Giuliani in the West Wing and State Department, where some officials blame him for leading Trump into the Ukraine mess, the president continued to stand by his personal lawyer.\n\nGiuliani, who hired former assistant special Watergate prosecutor Jon Sale a day after being hit with his own subpoena, continued to push false Biden corruption accusations and promised to fight against Democratic investigators.\n\nThe Ukraine matter remains the central focus as Democrats investigate whether Trump\u2019s suggestion that the east European country\u2019s new president be in touch with Giuliani and Barr to \u201clook into\u201d Biden amounts to a solicitation of foreign interference in the upcoming 2020 election.\n\nThe call unfolded against the backdrop of a $250 billion foreign aid package for Ukraine that was being readied by Congress but stalled by the White House.\n\nUkraine\u2019s president told reporters Tuesday he has never met or spoken with Giuliani.\n\nZelenskiy insisted that \u201cit is impossible to put pressure on me.\u201d He said he stressed the importance of the military aid repeatedly in discussions with Trump, but \u201cit wasn\u2019t explained to me\u201d why the money didn\u2019t come through until September.\n\nNot all business was halted between the White House and Congress. Even as the impeachment confrontation boiled, House Democrats briefed White House staffers on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s prescription drug legislation. Lowering drug costs is a top policy priority for both the speaker and the president. Joe Grogan, a top Trump domestic policy adviser, called it a \u201cvery productive start.\u201d", "description": "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says Democrats are trying to \u2018intimidate\u2019 and \u2018bully\u2019 the State Department.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HL975_Pompeo_ZG_20190623201132.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
