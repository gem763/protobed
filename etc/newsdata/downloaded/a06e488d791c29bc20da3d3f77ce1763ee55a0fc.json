It then attacked 241 accounts.\n\n\"The targeted accounts are associated with a US presidential campaign, current and former US government officials, journalists covering global politics and prominent Iranians living outside Iran,\" Microsoft said.\n\nCurrently, 19 Democrats are seeking to be nominated as their party's candidate to stand against Donald Trump in 2020, while three Republicans say they plan to challenge the president.

The company has told account holders affected and helped to protect them.\n\nNevertheless, the tech company called Phosphorus, also known as APT 35, \"highly motivated and willing to invest significant time and resources engaging in research and other means of information gathering\".\n\nMicrosoft urged all its customers to set up two-step verification for their email accounts, and suggested people worried about security to check their login history.\n\nWhy is this significant?\n\nThere has been increasing concern worldwide about foreign-sponsored election interference via hacking.\n\nIn July, US Special Counsel Robert Mueller concluded that Russia systematically interfered in the 2016 election with the intention of benefitting Mr Trump - although he did not establish collusion in a crime.\n\nThe same month Microsoft said it had told almost 10,000 customers they had been targeted or compromised by nation-state attacks.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption 'Don't meddle in the 2020 election', Trump jokes\n\nThe fact that the hackers allegedly have links to Iran is also noteworthy.\n\nPresident Trump's unilateral withdrawal from a nuclear accord between Iran and world powers last year has raised tensions between Washington and Tehran.\n\nThe US blames Iran for an attack on Saudi oil facilities in September which affected global markets.
