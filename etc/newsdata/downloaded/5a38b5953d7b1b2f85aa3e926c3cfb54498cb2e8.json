He's [Emery] played the youngsters and I'm pleased to see them in there, with [Bukayo] Saka.\n\nCeballos came off the bench for Arsenal during Monday's 1-0 defeat at Sheffield United\n\n'But Saka, for an 18-year-old, if you're leaving [Mesut] Ozil totally out of the squad, then we have to see more from him [Saka], we have to see more from Joe [Willock].\n\n'Unfortunately, it was a game where it passed them both by and then it comes down to the manager and his choices.\n\n'He's made the change at half-time, with Ceballos, so you're thinking to yourself: \"Why didn't you start him in the first place?\"", "description": "According to El Desmarque, Arsenal offered in the region of \u00a325million in a bid to secure Dani Ceballos on a permanent basis, but Real Madrid turned it down.", "authors": ["Jordan Seward For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/06/20069704-0-image-a-5_1571808482212.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
