Then there are the images of Christ who looked emaciated, weak, skinny, and had sunken eyes. Alternatively, that He was with children, baby lambs, and the poor and downtrodden. Now add to these thoughts that we\u2019re to \u201cturn the other cheek\u201d (Matt 5:39) and \u201cGOD IS OPPOSED TO THE PROUD, BUT GIVES GRACE TO THE HUMBLE\u201d (Jas 4:6). These are various reminders of how we\u2019re to talk in a loud whisper to others to show how humble we are. Lastly, most of these images and words seem to focus on His three-year ministry. However, does this give us a complete representation of how we are to be Christ-like in the marketplace?\n\nJesus also stood up against injustice and wrongdoing in the Jewish community. He stood up against the Jewish leadership in Jerusalem for their corruption during His three years of ministry (Matt 23). However, in all of our words and imagery, we fail to include His God-given strengths and about 18 years as an apprentice and \u201cgeneral contractor\u201d craftsman from about age 12 to 30. He was a craftsman in stone, wood, and possibly even in metal. We fail to include in our words and images how He dealt with others, such as vendors and clients and the general population as a businessman.\n\nWe don\u2019t discuss/display His God-given strengths and talents in business in the marketplace.\n\nHowever, we need to discuss, learn, and apply how He followed the 613 commandments in His business dealings. Such as beginning with the Ten Commandments of not bearing false witness, stealing, or even coveting the property and intellectual property in the Old Testament. About 70-80 percent of His parables in the New Testament deal with business issues. Where are the images of Jesus discussing a new building project with an architect and a group of men (Luke 14:28-29, \u201cbuild a tower\u201d); discussing labor relations with His daily hires (Matt 20:1-16); or Him discussing various investment amounts with others based on each of their entrepreneurial abilities in the parable of the talents (Matt 25:14-30)? Jesus is our business model, but where does that leave you, the startup entrepreneur or businessman, woman, or teenager, with encouragement to continue in the marketplace?\n\nWhat are your strengths... Notice Jesus in the parable of the talents discussed the master giving more investment money to the ones who had the most significant abilities to be productive. We can\u2019t ignore that the master invested in all of them, so no one is without having an investment in their business. After the master went over their business financials, two of the slaves were congratulated and given a promotion. Where are those images and words in our discussions and the marketplace in church?\n\nHere\u2019s the foundational basis for your God-given talents in the marketplace\n\nEph 2:10 For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them.\n\nNow let\u2019s say you do not have a good singing voice; in fact, you can\u2019t carry a tune in a wet paper bag. Now I tell you that you\u2019re going to have to sing at Carnegie Hall with New York Philharmonic Orchestra behind you to a sold-out crowd. How would you feel when the audience voices its displeasure and begins booing at you? Not much joy in doing that, is there? No pleasure for either of you, it would be downright soul-sucking for you and the crowd.\n\n\u2026 and who will you serve? Now, what if you did have the talent of a great singing voice (like Jonathan and Charlotte in Britain\u2019s Got Talent 2012)? You\u2019d probably get up every day and do those things all day long and when you went to bed at night, you couldn\u2019t wait to do it all over again. What would your level of joy be? Now imagine other people\u2019s and God\u2019s pleasure with you performing what He created you to do in serving others? Can you imagine building up everyone, you, your clients, God, all encouraged by your singing?\n\nThat.\n\nThat is your purpose, depending on your strengths and where to put them to use. It is to build up others and glorify God. When you find out your many advantages, you need to ask next: Whom will I serve?\n\nYour career has been mapped out by God based on the God-given talents you were born with and the spiritual gift(s) you got at the moment of our salvation. When we find out and thoroughly understand deep within our soul that we\u2019re \u201cfearfully and wonderfully made\u201d (Psal 139:14) and how we\u2019re to put to use our many talents, not give them away, only then do we know how it looks?\n\nRom 15:1-2 Now we who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of those without strength and not just please ourselves. Each of us is to please his neighbor for his good, to his edification.\n\nWe\u2019re to use all of our talents in service to others who are weak in what we do. To build up their lives just as we build up and develop ours by doing good deeds. Moreover, when you have developed those talents over time, then something magical happens at some future point.\n\nProv 22:29 Do you see a man skilled in his work? He will stand before kings; He will not stand before obscure men.\n\nSo how do you begin this new journey?\n\nFind out your God-given strengths. Strength Finder 2.0 book and web site are a good start. Find someone\u2019s weakness which needs your strengths. Then come alongside and serve them. When you serve them, you raise your happiness in doing what you are called to do and their joy at the results with what you have done. Then God is pleased with all of the good constructive results, too.\n\nWhen you answer both of those questions, you have your purpose established; the final decision is now yours.", "description": "There was a constant reminder growing up: \u201cThe spirit is .09/02/2019 3:05:28AM EST.", "authors": ["Kevin Cullis", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/305/76105473-2de5-44a2-b1d1-c1b10b6c6076.jpg"}
