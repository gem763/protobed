(Picture: Bridgeport Police Department/Obituary)\n\nA father accused of killing his baby son has been found guilty of raping an eight-year-old girl.\n\nDerrick Siberon, 32, pleaded guilty to first-degree sex assault under the Alford Doctrine on Tuesday, meaning he does not admit to the crime but concedes that he could be found guilty in court.\n\nHis plea came just before the girl, a relative of Siberon\u2019s who is now 12, was about testify about Siberon raping her in her bedroom in April 2015 in Bridgeport, Connecticut.\n\nSiberon\u2019s DNA was also identified by a rape kit, but that rape kit was not sent to a lab until two years after the assault. By that time, Siberon had been charged with killing his ten-month-old son.\n\nDonovan Siberon, Derrick\u2019s son, was found unresponsive inside his home on April 24, 2017. The child was taken to a hospital suffering head injuries and a detached cornea. He died the next day, News 12 reported.\n\nDerrick Siberon was formally charged with killing his son in May 2017 (Picture: News 12)\n\nPolice have not yet announced how the child died, but a state medical examiner ruled the child\u2019s death a homicide. However, the new investigation into Siberon apparently prompted police to sent the two-year-old rape kit to state labs, the CT Post reported.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is unclear why it took two years and the death of Siberon\u2019s son before authorities finally tested the rape kit. Multiple calls from Metro US to the Bridgeport Police Department regarding the delay went unanswered Wednesday.\n\nBizarre moment Donald Trump and Melania put chocolate bar on young trick-or-treater's head\n\nThere were already numerous pieces of evidence validating the girl\u2019s claims. Siberon\u2019s belongings, including his identification card, were found in her bedroom police said. The victim also gave a detailed description about the incident to authorities.\n\nThe victim\u2019s mother and her boyfriend even showed up to the police station in person, according to authorities, and the boyfriend told officers, \u2018You better find him (Siberon) before I do.\u2019\n\nTwo days after the death of his son, Siberon voluntarily came to police and gave a statement about the sexual assault. He admitted being at the girl\u2019s home, but denied raping her.\n\nIt is unclear why the untested rape kit reportedly sat in the Bridgeport Police Department property room for two years. The department was unable to be reached for a comment.

He has pleaded not guilty to that charge and it is unclear when he is due in court.", "description": "Derrick Siberon, who is accused of killing his baby son has been found guilty of raping an eight-year-old girl in Bridgeport, Connecticut.", "authors": ["Jacob Geanous"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/comp-1572462232_1572465667.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
