Launched on 25 October, the crowdfunder raised $5m in just 48 hours, with $1.75m coming from YouTube alone, which the team claims is a new fundraising record for the site.\n\nAll donations are sent directly to the Arbor Day Foundation, a US nonprofit conservation and education organisation dedicated to planting trees. They will plant the trees around the world, starting in January, with the aim of completing the project within three years.\n\nMore than 600 creators and social media influencers have joined the initiative, many employing creative tactics to encourage donations. Jacksepticeye, the top YouTuber in Ireland with 22.9 million subscribers, hosted an eight-hour livestream in which he planted trees on the videogame Minecraft for each of his viewers\u2019 donations, raising $153,000.\n\nOther stunts included a gaming YouTuber donating $10 for each kill during a Fortnite tournament and a technology channel building a tree-planting cannon.\n\nMrBeast, who has donated $100,000, admits that he has not always been the most environmentally friendly \u2013 in one of his videos, which has over 12m views, he builds a \u201cmansion\u201d out of cardboard boxes before setting it alight \u2013 but says now is the time to take action. In a video he said: \u201cPeople keep making fun of our generation for retweet activism and not actually doing something \u2026 this is your chance to make a difference.\u201d\n\nAmid some suggestions that the money would be better spent preserving trees, he said: \u201cJust to be clear we all realise 20m trees won\u2019t fix climate change. But at the end of the day 20m more trees is better then 0! We want to take action because doing nothing is how we got here!\u201d\n\nYouTube has been criticised for its platforming of climate denial, as highlighted by Extinction Rebellion Youth action during the two-week October protests. A recent analysis of the site \u2013 which is the most-watched platform for 16- to 24-year-olds \u2013 found that the majority of videos about the climate crisis opposed the scientific consensus on the subject.", "description": "More than 600 creators and social media influencers join campaign to plant 20m trees", "authors": ["Jessica Murray"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67539b587fb48082bd668c80d95aec5d2982f455/0_132_2160_1296/master/2160.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9fcbe0d8313392089867932f675911a4", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
