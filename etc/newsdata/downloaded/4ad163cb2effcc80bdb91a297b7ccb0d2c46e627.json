Justice tops politics.", "language": "en", "text": "Impeachment is dangerous and risky for our country, but the Founders gave us the process for a reason. More than ever, lawmakers must be impartial.\n\nIn late 1998, I was a Democratic senator from Wisconsin just reelected for a second term. Shortly after the election, the House Judiciary Committee approved articles of impeachment, seeking to remove from office a president from my own party whose abilities and accomplishments I held in high esteem.\n\nStark political battle lines were drawn and tensions were sky high. Public opinion quite clearly did not favor impeachment, but the full House of Representatives approved the articles of impeachment and sent them to the Senate. The Senate prepared to conduct a trial and vote on whether to convict President Bill Clinton and end his presidency.\n\nMy party\u2019s leadership strongly supported the president and made it clear it would do everything it could to ensure that he would not become the first president in history to be convicted and removed from office. A strong majority of my constituents made plain in the letters and phone calls that flooded my office that while they did not like the president\u2019s behavior, they did not want to see his presidency end. And I recognized that conviction would upend the choice the voters had made in a free and fair election held just a few years earlier.\n\nSenators' duty to 'impartial justice'\n\nBut something about this purely political approach to the impeachment trial bothered me. And as I looked at the Constitution and the historical precedents drawn from the only two impeachment efforts that had reached or nearly reached this point, of President Andrew Johnson in 1868 and President Richard Nixon in 1974, I realized I had a duty as a senator that went beyond politics and policy.\n\nThe Founders made it clear: You don't have to break a law to be impeached. Trump's defenders need a better argument.\n\nThe Constitution gives both House members and senators distinct responsibilities with respect to impeachment. House members alone decide whether the president has done something, or many things, that warrant impeachment. But they can\u2019t remove him from office. Senators can protest the president\u2019s policies or proclaim he has committed high crimes and misdemeanors all they want, but they can\u2019t impeach him if the House doesn\u2019t act. Once the House approves articles of impeachment, however, no poll is taken, no election is held. The 100 Senators have the sole power to decide whether to remove the president from office or allow him to finish the term to which he was elected.\n\nAs a senator, I had sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution. And as the trial began, I swore a separate oath to \u201cdo impartial justice\u201d in the impeachment matter. Those oaths led me to two decisions early in the proceeding that were not popular with my party or my constituents.\n\nSen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., in 1996 with Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. (Photo: Jym Wilson/Gannett News Service)\n\nFirst, rather than short-circuiting the trial by voting for a motion to dismiss offered by the senior member of my caucus, Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., under rules adopted by the Senate for the Clinton impeachment, I concluded that the trial should move forward to its eventual conclusion. And second, I felt bound to give the House managers, who act as prosecutors in the impeachment case, an opportunity to make the case that the House had appointed them to present, and of course, to consider the defense of the president presented by his counsel.\n\nAnd so, alone in my caucus, I voted against the motion to dismiss and, separately, in favor of allowing the House managers to take the depositions of three key witnesses and offer them into evidence in the Senate trial.\n\nImpeachment risks instability\n\nI reached those conclusions out of respect for the role that the House of Representatives plays in the impeachment process set out in the Constitution. Senators have an extremely important role to play in this process, but it is to do impartial justice in the trial. Making a decision to acquit the president before impeachment articles are even voted on by House, or doing so before the House has presented its full case in the Senate trial, would be inconsistent with a senator\u2019s constitutional responsibilities.\n\nPunish political frivolity at the polls: Should Trump get a third term if he's impeached and acquitted? Hmmmmm ...\n\nIn the end, I voted to acquit President Clinton, although I believed and stated at the time that it was a close case. But I made my decision after hearing all the arguments and reviewing all the evidence that the body charged with presenting the case for impeachment wanted to put before the Senate.\n\nPresidents Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. (Photo: Via AFP/Getty Images)\n\nWhen the Senate considered the impeachment of President Clinton, I was deeply troubled that for the second time in my life, impeachment of a duly elected president was contemplated. I wondered how we would feel about the stability of our political system if another presidential impeachment occurred in the next 10 or 20 years. And I firmly believed that senators should err on the side of respecting the will of the people as expressed in the election for president every four years.\n\nBut I also knew that the Founders of our country had provided a process for removing a president for good reason, and I believed strongly that senators had to respect that constitutional process and faithfully carry out their role in it, rather than prejudging the effort based on their own policy or political preferences.\n\nThat is what I tried my best to do, and what I urge all senators to do now as an impeachment trial for President Donald Trump looms. They must keep an open mind. They must hear all the evidence before making a decision. And, having been entrusted by the Constitution with perhaps the most momentous decision a senator can make, they must do impartial justice.\n\nRuss Feingold, a Democrat, represented Wisconsin in the U.S. Senate from 1993 to 2010.
