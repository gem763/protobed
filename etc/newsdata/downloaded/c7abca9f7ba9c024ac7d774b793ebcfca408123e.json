Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) \u2014 said they would force Americans to provide free healthcare to all 11 to 22 million illegal aliens living in the U.S.\n\nAs Breitbart News estimated, providing free healthcare to every illegal alien in the U.S. would cost up to $66 billion a year or $660 billion over a decade to American taxpayers. Already, Americans are forced to subsidize illegal aliens\u2019 medical costs to the sum of almost $20 billion a year.\n\nThe Urban Institute\u2019s Linda Blumberg, a health insurance expert, told the New York Times that such a policy providing free healthcare for every foreign national who crosses the U.S.-Mexico border or overstays a visa would drive a migration of \u201cpeople with serious health problems\u201d to the country.\n\nOn the other hand, Miller noted that Trump recently signed a presidential proclamation that protects American taxpayers from subsidizing the healthcare and medical costs of legal immigrants who want to permanently resettle in the U.S.\n\n\u201cThe President issued an executive order \u2026 to simply say that in order to be lawfully admitted into our country, you must be able to afford or have a plan to cover your basic healthcare needs so that you and I and every other citizen in this country and every other person lawfully residing here today does not have to cover those health care expenses, that we will not use our healthcare system to subsidize all of planet Earth, which will mean rationing of care and denial of coverage for us citizens,\u201d Miller said.\n\n\u201cWe know that noncitizens are uninsured at a much higher rate than U.S. citizens and that bringing in large numbers of new noncitizens who have no means and no ability and no capacity financially to cover their health care costs means longer lines in emergency rooms,\u201d Miller continued.\n\n\u201cIt means fewer hours of time to see your doctor, it means less access to basic medicine, less access to basic procedures, it means less and worse care if that\u2019s allowed to happen,\u201d Miller said. \u201cAnd so this is going to protect the availability of those benefits for U.S. citizens and persons today that are already living and residing here lawfully.\u201d\n\nThe most recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found that the 2020 Democrats\u2019 plan to give free, taxpayer-funded healthcare to all illegal aliens living in the U.S. is the most unpopular policy position thus far. Likewise, a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) revealed recently that his research finds swing voters are vastly turned off by the open borders agenda pushed by leading 2020 Democrats.\n\nIn contrast, a majority of white, Hispanic, and black Americans said they support Trump\u2019s latest regulation that seeks to ban welfare-dependent immigration \u2014 that is, legal immigrants permanently resettling in the U.S. despite having a record of using taxpayer-funded welfare programs.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
