At least that\u2019s what I imagine happened to generate this sudden change of heart this morning.\n\nAs Ed noted this morning, Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, told Lawrence O\u2019Donnell Monday night show that the omission of a key detail from their NY Times opinion piece wasn\u2019t their fault. They had included the fact that a woman who allegedly encountered Kavanaugh naked at a drunken party told friends she had no memory of the incident, but the Times\u2019 editors removed that key detail from the story.\n\nAs Ed pointed out this morning, that explanation doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense given that authors have the final say about what makes it into print under their names. It sounded as if they were throwing the Times under the bus to save themselves.\n\nToday, the Pogrebin and Kelly appeared on the View and were asked by Meghan McCain how this \u201cvital fact\u201d got left out.\n\n\u201cThank you so much for the question and we\u2019re eager to clear the air on this,\u201d Kate Kelly said. She continued, \u201cFirst of all, there was no desire to withhold important information from our readers. We have all of it in the book and the essay is an adaptation of the book that of course, we had to edit for length and clarity.\n\n\u201cDuring the editing process, there was an oversight and this key detail, about the fact that the woman herself has told friends she doesn\u2019t remember it and has not wanted to talk about it, got cut. And it was an oversight and the Times adjusted it and we\u2019re very sorry that it happened.\u201d\n\nNotice that Kelly says \u201cwe\u201d had to edit and that the key detail \u201cgot cut\u201d without assigning any specific blame.\n\n\u201cYou also sort of threw the NY Times opinion board under the bus a little bit saying that they chose to omit it.\u201d McCain pointed out. She added, \u201cI\u2019ve written opinion pieces in the NY Times. In my experience, I get the final say on what runs\u2026So where was the disconnect there?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, we\u2019re a team at the NY Times,\u201d Kelly claimed. \u201cWe have processes in place. We wrote this. It was edited. There was back and forth as there always is. It\u2019s kind of a team effort, frankly, to make sure everyone is comfortable with the final product and there was just an oversight here,\u201d she added.\n\nCo-host Sunny Hostin chimed in: \u201cBut you are the authors of the book, did you just miss it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe first had it in the piece,\u201d Robin Pogrebin said. She continued, \u201cAnd so it\u2019s about an editing process which is iterative. It has a lot of different drafts.\u201d Pogrebin then repeated the claim that the sentence was removed when removing the alleged victim\u2019s name from the piece but said, \u201cIn removing her name to kind of protect her and make sure we weren\u2019t sending people to her door, we also took out the fact that she didn\u2019t remember it.\u201d\n\nHostin asked the obvious question: \u201cDid you read it right before it went to print?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, I, we thought we had,\u201d Porgrebin replied. She added, \u201cAnd as soon as we realized this we corrected it and they wrote an editor\u2019s note and they restored it.\u201d\n\nMollie Hemingway, who has co-written her own book about the Kavanaugh confirmation, points out this is another change from what the authors claimed last night on MSNBC:\n\nThis conflicts with what they said last night, which is that they updated it in response to the immense public pressure they were receiving for failing to include it. Not \"as soon as they realized\" but, in fact, nearly a day after their failure was made public. https://t.co/xmABkxvx1M \u2014 Mollie (@MZHemingway) September 17, 2019\n\nThe video is below but it\u2019s worth noting that the authors also apologized today on the View for another embarrassing mistake. It turns out they wrote a badly worded tweet which the Times later deleted and apologized for:\n\nThe Times was forced to apologize after a tweet from the @nytopinion account about the essay, stated: \u201cHaving a penis thrust in your face at a drunken dorm party may seem like harmless fun. But when Brett Kavanaugh did it to her, Deborah Ramirez says, it confirmed that she didn\u2019t belong at Yale in the first place.\u201d The Times was forced to apologized over the tweet, which was about a separate sexual misconduct allegation involving Kavanaugh, calling it \u201cclearly inappropriate and offensive.\u201d Pogrebin told \u201cThe View\u201d that the tweet was not worded well and that it was an attempt to make a larger point around sexual misconduct. \u201cIt was a misworded tweet, but what happens at the Times is the reporters are asked to draft tweets and we\u2019re also asked to draft headlines. They don\u2019t always get used, sent out, they often don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nSo, to sum this up, mistakes were made but we\u2019re all a team at the NY Times!\n\nHonestly, I would pay the full list price of the book for a recording of the angry calls these two must have gotten from the Times last night. If only they would do a deep dive on that topic.", "description": "\"It's kind of a team effort, frankly...\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/View-authors.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
