The bottom line also improved 11% year over year.\n\n\n\nMoreover, revenues jumped 43% from the year-ago quarter to $1.59 billion. Revenues realized from the acquisition of Engility drove the top-line growth.\n\n\n\nHowever, excluding Engility, revenues were flat year over year. The figure also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.64 billion. The company witnessed some delays in contract awards due to protests. Moreover, unmaterialized new businesses were also an overhang on the top line.\n\n\n\nNonetheless, adjusting for nearly $30 million in dissynergies due to elimination of prime sub-revenues, lower revenues on cost, and lower contract revenues due to cost synergy achievement, the company achieved 2% organic growth year over year.\n\nScience Applications International Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nScience Applications International Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise More\n\nScience Applications International Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Science Applications International Corporation Quote\n\nQuarter in Detail\n\n\n\nNet bookings for the quarter were approximately $1.9 billion, excluding $400 million of single-award IDIQ value, as a result of contract award activities, reflecting a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.2.\n\n\n\nScience Applications\u2019 estimated backlog of signed business orders was approximately $13.9 billion of which, $2.6 billion was funded.\n\n\n\nAdjusted operating margin contracted 30 basis points (bps) year over year to 6.3% in the reported quarter.\n\n\n\nAdjusted EBITDA margin expanded 90 bps to 8.4%, backed by an improved program performance, cost discipline and higher margin portfolio of Engility. The figure does not include $6 million of integration related costs in the quarter.\n\n\n\nBalance Sheet & Cash Flow\n\n\n\nScience Applications ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $179 million, up from $151 million reported in the previous quarter.\n\n\n\nOperating cash flow was $95 million, down from $178 million in the previous quarter. Free cash flow was $90 million compared with $169 million in the preceding quarter. The second quarter is usually the lowest cash generating quarter for the year due to additional payroll cycles compared to the other quarters, and two income tax payments.\n\n\n\nNonetheless, significant cash collections and reduced working capital were positives.\n\n\n\nDuring the quarter, Science Applications deployed $156 million of capital, consisting of $133 million in planned share repurchases, $21 million in cash dividends and a $2 million in debt repayment.\n\n\n\nGuidance\n\n\n\nScience Applications maintained revenue target per its report presented at the investors\u2019 conference held in January.\n\n\n\nFor the full fiscal year, adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to expand 80 bps year over year.\n\n\n\nFree cash flow is still expected to be around $425 million for fiscal 2020.\n\n\n\nThe company\u2019s full-year effective tax rate is forecast in the 22-24% range.\n\n\n\nThe company expects headwinds of nearly $100 million in dissynergies due to elimination of prime sub-revenues, lower revenues on cost, and fall in contract revenues due to cost synergy achievement during the fiscal year.\n\n\n\nZacks Rank and Stocks to Consider\n\n\n\nCurrently, Science Applications has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
