He was even more tickled when his agent told him the filmmakers were interested in casting him to play Ellis \u201cRed\u201d Redding, the inmate and prison smuggler serving a life sentence who befriends the wrongfully convicted Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) in the revered drama, which was released 25 years ago, on Sept. 23, 1994.\n\nFreeman wasn\u2019t however, familiar with the original source material penned by Stephen King.\n\n\"Then someone sent me the novella,\u201d Freeman told Yahoo Entertainment during a 2014 Role Recall interview. \u201cAnd I read the first page and Red was this Irishman. So I closed the book. I never read another line. I was like, \u2018I can\u2019t play an Irishman!\u2019\u201d\n\nIndeed, in King\u2019s 1982 novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, \u201cRed,\u201d as he\u2019s simply called, and who narrates the story, describes himself as Irish. But writer-director Darabont and company clearly intended to make the character an African-American man in extending the role to Freeman, who of course eventually signed on \u2014 and subsequently earned an Oscar nomination for Best Actor for the part.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t play an Irishman,\u201d Freeman laughed during our interview. But Red's past ethnicity is winked at in the film version. \u201cRed. Why do they call you that?\u201d Andy asks him when they first meet in the prison yard. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m Irish,\u201d Red retorts.\n\nShawshank, which earned a total of seven Academy Award nominations but won exactly zero, is considered one of the most beloved American films ever. In fact, according to IMDb, it's the top rated movie \u2014 as voted on by millions of users \u2013 OF ALL TIME, a distinction it's held since 2008, when it passed The Godfather.\n\n\u201cI know, it\u2019s bizarre and wonderful, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Darabont told Yahoo Entertainment in a 2016 interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful feeling.\u201d\n\nThe filmmaker, who would eventually adapt versions of King\u2019s The Mist and Green Mile before launching The Walking Dead on TV, had his own trepidations about the film.\n\n\u201cWhen we were done shooting, I was exhausted, and not sure if I ever wanted to direct again, because it really takes it out of you. But I felt we had a really good movie, and that if audiences gave it a chance, they would like it. Once we had a cut of it and started doing test screenings, that proved to be the case. The people who saw it really dug it. The trick was getting people to see it. When it came out, it really didn\u2019t do well at first. There was some talk about the awkwardness of the title \u2014 you know, that the title worked against you.\u201d\n\nDarabont credited cable mogul Ted Turner, who once owned Castle Rock, the production company behind Shawshank, for making the film a hit. \u201cTurner started airing Shawshank on TV like every five minutes for years, because I don\u2019t think it cost him anything!\u201d the filmmaker recalled with a laugh. \u201cThere was this endless opportunity for people to catch up with it on a Turner network, and so I bless Ted Turner as well. Because he played the heck out of it.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, despite what the internet would have you believe, Shawshank is not Freeman's personal favorite, even when it comes to just his own filmography.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll say that, because it\u2019s maybe one of the best films made,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it never quite made my best list, no.\u201d\n\nWatch Part 2 of our Role Recall interview with Morgan Freeman:\n\nRead more on Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nWant daily pop culture news delivered to your inbox?
