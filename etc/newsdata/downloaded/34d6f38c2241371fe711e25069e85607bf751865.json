In a sneak peek of Sunday\u2019s new episode of E!'s Keeping Up With The Kardashians, Khloe Kardashian is mad at mom Kris Jenner for avoiding her\n\n'She\u2019s literally avoiding me,' she continues, as the pair hang in the kitchen.\n\nEventually, she gets Disick to admit that momager Jenner, 63, is avoiding her daughter over fear of a confrontation.\n\n'She's scared that you're going to confront her,' he tells Khloe. 'She\u2019s like, \"I don\u2019t want to see Khloe because I don\u2019t want to have the conversation.\"'\n\nWhile Khloe previously stated that details in the memoir reveal an alleged lie on the part of her mother, she does not directly refer to it in the episode \u2014 Scott refers to it only as 'that SoulCycle thing.'\n\nOwning up: Eventually, Khloe gets Scott Disick to admit that momager Jenner is avoiding her daughter over fear of a confrontation regarding a lie unearthed in Lamar Odom's new memoir\n\nKhloe is incredulous in the clip, and insists that she is over it \u2014 she reveals that she's more annoyed about the fact that Kris is avoiding her in the first place.\n\nIt turns out that the 'SoulCycle thing' is in connection to a 2015 incident Odom discusses in his book \u2014 and one that he has already publicly regretted including in the memoir.\n\nAllegedly, during the last throes of Khloe's troubled marriage to Lamar, Kris called the troubled athlete up without her daughter's knowledge or approval, and told him where Khloe would be the next morning \u2014 on her way to a SoulCycle class \u2014 so that he could track her down and have words with her.\n\nSure enough, there she was at the appointed place and time \u2014 along with a whole crowd of cameras and paparazzi.\n\nIn spite of the obvious deception that was apparent in the incident, now almost five years later Khloe has chosen to no longer focus on it.\n\n'First of all, it\u2019s 600 years ago. I don\u2019t give a s\u2014,' she tells Scott in the new KUWTK preview. 'I\u2019m more annoyed [she\u2019s not talking to me].

'I am.'\n\nScared mama: 'She literally thinks you\u2019re going to like, \"come for her,\" is her wording,' says Disick\n\nIn the confessional segment, Kardashian and Disick start scheming to get Kris to run in to her daughter without her knowledge.\n\n'I could say I'm sick,' Scott suggests slyly. 'She's always come over if I say I'm sick.'\n\n'We lure her in, and you could just come out of another door,' he continues.\n\nKardashian seems into the plan, to a point.\n\n'I'm not gonna, like, jump her,' Khloe maintains.\n\nNot that mad: Khloe is incredulous in the clip, and insists that she is over it; seen here in an Instagram post from Florida on Friday\n\nKardashian wed Odom, 39, in September of 2009 \u2014 just one month after meeting.\n\nAfter a first split in 2013 as a result of the basketball star's infidelity and drug addiction problems, they finally, officially divorced in 2016, after Lamar recovered from a near-fatal drug overdose.\n\nIn Odom\u2019s memoir, which was published this spring, he tells a frank account of his troubles and owns up to why his relationship with Khloe ultimately failed.\n\nIn another clip for the new KUWTK episode, Khloe admits that she misses her ex Lamar 'all the time' and is open to meeting with him in person, but 'I don\u2019t want to mislead him in any way.'\n\nKeeping Up With The Kardashians airs Sundays at 9pm on E!\n\nHe's doing better: In Lamar Odom\u2019s memoir, which was published this spring, he tells a frank account of his troubles and owns up to why his relationship with Khloe ultimately failed; seen here on his current stint at Dancing With The Stars", "description": "In a sneak peek of Sunday's new episode, Khloe Kardashian  is mad at mom Kris Jenner for avoiding her over an apparent lie unearthed in Khloe's ex Lamar Odom's new memoir.", "authors": ["Dan Heching For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/19/20191634-0-image-a-41_1572026968621.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
