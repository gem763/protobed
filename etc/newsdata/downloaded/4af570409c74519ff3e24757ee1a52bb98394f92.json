It also has attracted the ire of a fact-checking website that treats The Bee like any other news source.\n\nThe Babylon Bee describes itself as a \u201ctrusted source\u201d of Christian satire (Example: \u201cStudy: 78% of Worship Bands Could Use More Cowbell\u201d). Still, the site\u2019s scribes feed off the political cycle like most other modern humorists.\n\nThere is a catch, though, given the tenor of today\u2019s political humor. They collectively mock left-of-center targets with the tenacity that Stephen Colbert and others reserve for Republicans.\n\nThis forum for Christian mockery is making waves for telling jokes most comedians won\u2019t so much as whisper: \u201cIlhan Omar Blasts Israel for Refusing Palestine\u2019s Generous Gift of Rockets.\u201d\n\nBee Editor-in-Chief Kyle Mann said the site recently reached its highest traffic total to date. Political satire goes viral more easily than other content, said Mr. Mann, who joined The Bee after emailing submissions shortly after the site launched three years ago.\n\nPolitical gags are essential to the site\u2019s brand along with pokes at preachers such as Joel Osteen, who has been mocked for his prosperity Gospel mantra. Beltway banter has drawn a larger crowd in recent months, yet Mr. Mann doesn\u2019t draw a thick line between the two.\n\n\u201cWe need to be engaging in current events, to show the power of the Gospel in a way that brings down those idols,\u201d he said.\n\nToward that end, the site doesn\u2019t sink to profane gags like late-night TV\u2019s bleep-a-thon products. While some comics use vulgarity to hammer home a punchline, Team Babylon employs \u201cirony, contrast and absurdity\u201d to make its mark, said Mr. Mann, co-host of the new Babylon Bee Podcast, which takes listeners behind the scenes at the site.\n\nIn recent weeks, Snopes has taken a particular interest in The Bee\u2019s brand of satire. The veteran fact-checkers routinely examine Bee stories as if they were breaking news items from CNN or Fox News.\n\nThe Bee fired back in its inimitable way, mocking how Snopes underplayed former Vice President Joseph R. Biden\u2019s recent flurry of gaffes: \u201cSnopes Rates Biden\u2019s Claim That 2+2=5 as \u2018Mostly True.\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Mann notes that Snopes also has fact-checked his site\u2019s left-leaning competitor, The Onion, but with less vigor than his team endures.\n\n\u201cTheir fact-checks of The Onion always put the blame on readers for misunderstanding the satire and never imply that the writers of The Onion are trying to deceive people,\u201d said Mr. Mann, adding that Snopes recently shared a study suggesting The Bee\u2019s stories are \u201cthe most widely shared, \u2018factually inaccurate content\u2019 on the internet.\u201d\n\nThe Snopes/Bee kerfuffle is about more than digital labels, Mr. Mann said.\n\n\u201cAs Snopes has repeatedly put us under the category of \u2018Junk News,\u2019 it\u2019s incredibly concerning to us that Big Tech could lump us in with actual fake news and ban us or reduce our reach,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Bee isn\u2019t amused and is hiring legal representation to fend off the attacks.\n\nSnopes responded to a Washington Times request for comment initially but didn\u2019t answer submitted questions or accept an invitation for a phone interview.\n\nWorth noting, The Bee\u2019s political humor doesn\u2019t pull punches when it comes to President Trump.\n\n\u201cTrump Spends Afternoon Shouting From White House Balcony During Twitter Outage,\u201d one recent headline declared. Another declared, \u201cTrump Enraged as Immigrant Child Asks for More Gruel.\u201d\n\nStill, Bee staffers don\u2019t obsess over Mr. Trump like most other modern comics.\n\nBrandon Bassham, a writer for the libertarian-leaning We the Internet TV, said The Bee\u2019s conservative bent serves a public pummeled by liberal comic tropes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s long been said that conservatives can\u2019t do comedy very well, but nowadays liberals can\u2019t either,\u201d Mr. Bassham said. \u201c\u2018SNL,\u2019 \u2018The Daily Show,\u2019 Samantha Bee \u2026 they\u2019re all terrible. [They\u2019re] not funny, and they\u2019re basically shills for corporate Dems.\u201d\n\nThe Bee works best, he said, when it mocks liberals. The site sometimes stumbles, though, when its \u201cright-leaning slant\u201d is too overt.\n\nEmmy-nominated writer Tony Daro applauds The Bee for taking on both sides of the political aisle. The site\u2019s Christian satire, though, doesn\u2019t impress the liberal comic.\n\n\u201cMaking fun of evangelicals, while noble, is like shooting fish in a barrel,\u201d said Mr. Daro, who has written for \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d\n\nMichael Loftus, a conservative comic and part of the Freedom to Laugh Comedy Tour, said he pays the most attention to The Bee\u2019s \u201csmart\u201d politically charged tweets.\n\n\u201cIt never seems mean. The jokes never appear to punch down,\u201d said Mr. Loftus, who has written for the sitcoms \u201cAnger Management\u201d and \u201cKevin Can Wait.\u201d\n\nIn its early months, The Bee published three or four stories a day. Now, readers might sample as many as nine stories in a 24-hour period. Faster can be better, particularly given the demands of a digital enterprise.\n\n\u201cYou have to be nimble in comedy and satire,\u201d Mr. Mann said.\n\nIn the era of perpetual outrage, it\u2019s hardly surprising some Bee readers recoil at a selection of its gags.\n\n\u201cEvery single piece we\u2019ve ever written has had somebody upset. \u2026 If you\u2019re getting really offended about satire, that just happens to be your sacred cow that\u2019s tipped over,\u201d Mr. Mann said. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely not immune from that. \u2026 The left has the stereotype of being \u2018snowflakes.\u2019 We see it from both sides. Some of the craziest blowback we get is from taking on President Trump.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
