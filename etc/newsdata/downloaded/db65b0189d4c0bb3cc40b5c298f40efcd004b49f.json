It offers lossless versions of audio files for streaming or downloading at a price that aggressively undercuts Tidal, the main competition for this kind of audio. Amazon will charge $14.99 a month for the HD tier, or $12.99 if you\u2019re an Amazon Prime customer. Tidal\u2019s Hi-Fi plan costs $19.99 monthly. The new plan was rumored a few months ago.\n\nAmazon says it has a catalog of over 50 million songs that it calls \u201cHigh Definition,\u201d which is the term it\u2019s applying to songs with CD-quality bit depth of 16 bits and a 44.1kHz sample rate. It also has \u201cmillions\u201d (read: less than 10 million, more than one million) of songs it\u2019s calling \u201cUltra HD,\u201d which translates to 24-bit with sample rates that range from 44.1kHz up to 192kHz. Amazon Music HD will deliver them all in the lossless FLAC file format, instead of the MQA format that Tidal uses.\n\nAmazon\u2019s VP of Music, Steve Boom, tells me that Amazon chose the HD and UltraHD terminology because it found it was more comprehensible to a mass audience than the current terminology for audio quality. And \u201cmass audience\u201d is exactly what Amazon is going for; it doesn\u2019t want Amazon Music HD to be a niche player like Tidal and other lossless music platforms like HDtracks or Qobuz.\n\nBoom says that \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty big deal that one of the big three global streaming services is doing this \u2014 we\u2019re the first one.\u201d Amazon Music isn\u2019t often in the conversation about music streaming competition, which usually ends up following a Spotify vs. Apple Music narrative. But Amazon considers itself in their company, and with the new HD offering it\u2019s looking to differentiate itself and perhaps raise its profile.\n\nBoom declined to give new subscriber numbers, but Amazon\u2019s music service did reportedly have more than 32 million subscribers as of this past April. Spotify hit 100 million paid subscribers that same month. But remember that millions of people have access to a sampling of Amazon\u2019s catalog through Prime Music, which comes included for free with a Prime subscription. That\u2019s a powerful tool for getting them to step up to an Amazon Music Unlimited or Amazon Music HD plan.\n\nGiving users a specific reason to switch to Amazon Music, beyond working slightly better with Echo speakers, could give Amazon a boost. Right now Spotify is sort of the global default and Apple has been aggressive at making carrier deals in the US to boost its numbers. But even if Amazon can\u2019t peel off subscribers from those services, it seems likely that it\u2019ll pull some users \u2014 perhaps many \u2014 away from Tidal, though that\u2019s not exactly a big pool to draw from.\n\nSpotify has at times tested lossless audio but has yet to officially launch a plan for all customers. Apple, meanwhile, is doing everything it can to extract the most quality from the AAC format it uses, but has always stopped short of going in on lossless. If it finds success, Amazon\u2019s latest move could give both companies another push to come up with something similar. Lossless demands a lot more bandwidth, however, and some listeners might struggle to tell a difference between it and the \u201chigh\u201d quality setting streaming apps currently offer.\n\nRock legend Neil Young, who has for years extolled the benefits of high-res music (remember Pono?), really took the hyperbole up to 11 in reacting to today\u2019s news. \u201cEarth will be changed forever when Amazon introduces high quality streaming to the masses,\u201d he said in Amazon\u2019s press release. \u201cThis will be the biggest thing to happen in music since the introduction of digital audio 40 years ago.\u201d\n\nI got a brief demo of the service yesterday and of course it sounded amazing \u2014 anything would in the Hi-Fi setup Amazon had in its San Francisco office. Audiophiles with similar setups will be able to take advantage of Amazon\u2019s service with the right DAC attached to their phone. And if you\u2019ve got one of LG\u2019s smartphones with a built-in DAC, this is another instance where that hardware will pay off.\n\nAmazon says that its HD service will be compatible with products from \u201cDenon and Marantz with HEOS Built-in, Polk Audio, Definitive Technology, Sonos, McIntosh, Sennheiser, and many more.\u201d Of course, you also aren\u2019t likely to hear a big different on most Echo speakers \u2014 especially earlier models and Echo Dots. Boom says that most recent models have a line-out, though.\n\nWhen you\u2019re playing an HD or UltraHD song, you can tap on the HD logo to bring up a screen that provides more details about the actual quality of that stream or file. Amazon will dynamically reduce quality if you\u2019re on a low bandwidth connection. You will definitely hear the difference on both iPhones and Android phones, but since they max out at 24-bit/44.1kHz quality on their built-in DACs, you won\u2019t get the very best quality without an external DAC. Plus, if you\u2019re using Bluetooth you\u2019re unlikely to hear the difference, Boom says.\n\nThe service is launching today and Amazon is offering a 90-day free trial. It will be available in the US, UK, Germany, and Japan.", "description": "Amazon is launching a new tier of its music service today, dubbed Amazon Music HD.
