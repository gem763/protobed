Gary Peters in Michigan", "language": "en", "text": "I sure hope this is for real. And it may be: Recall that James fell just six points short of formidable incumbent Debbie Stabenow last fall, on a night when Democrats were cleaning up in House races coast to coast. Also recall that a separate poll published last week found James trailing Gary Peters by three points, 43/40.\n\nNow here comes a new one putting Peters and James less than a point apart.\n\nImagine if Democrats have a big night in the Senate next fall, picking up three net seats \u2014 and their dream of a Senate majority ends up in ashes because Gary \u201cWho?\u201d Peters couldn\u2019t hold off James in supposedly blue Michigan.\n\nIn the Vanguard, Dennis, Pubic Sector Consultant poll last May it was Mr. Peters 42% and a generic Republican 36%. It is now 39.5% for Mr. Peters and 39.3% for Mr. James\u2026 At this point in the campaign last year when Senator Debbie Stabenow took on Mr. James, she had a comfortable lead. But he closed the gap on her and now she is saying, \u201cthis is a make or break race and we\u2019re at a critical moment.\u201d She notes Mr. James raised more money than Mr. Peters in the third quarter but Peters continues to have more money in his coffers than the challenger.\n\nHow bad could it get theoretically for the GOP in November 2020? Well, start with the positive. No matter how poorly things go nationally, Alabama\u2019s likely to dump Doug Jones for a Republican to be named later. That\u2019s GOP +1. Assume James stuns Michigan by knocking off Peters, a big ask but not an impossible. That\u2019s GOP +2, a total of 55 Senate seats \u2014 if all Republican incumbents hold their seats. And that\u2019s really the best-case scenario. There are no other ripe pick-up opportunities for Republicans.\n\nThings are different for Democrats. In Maine, one lefty poll has Susan Collins at 50 percent disapproval. In Colorado, Cory Gardner looks to be in trouble against John Hickenlooper. In Arizona, Mark Kelly is already ahead of Martha McSally. And in North Carolina, at least one poll taken last month shows Thom Tillis narrowly trailing his Democratic challenger. A Morning Consult survey of various battleground races published last week found slippage in the job approval of five different vulnerable GOP senators, with Joni Ernst sliding the furthest at nine points. That\u2019s what the impeachment saga is apparently doing to Republicans. The good news is that impeachment will long since have ended by the time voters vote next fall. The bad news is that the GOP will doubtless be forced to defend Trump on other matters various and sundry by then, with the Ukraine matter lurking in the background of voters\u2019 minds. How will that shake out?\n\nIn the ultimate worst-case scenario, Collins, Gardner, McSally, Tillis, and Ernst all get wiped out and maybe one or both of the Senate seats on the ballot in increasingly purple Georgia go the other way too. If that happened, it would mean a national disaster for the GOP, in which case John James \u2014 and Trump \u2014 are likely losers too. Conceivably, Democrats could have a net gain of five or six seats and control of the White House. Which would mean nothing would be standing in the way of Chuck Schumer nuking the filibuster and enacting President Warren\u2019s \u201cshare the wealth\u201d agenda. Gulp.\n\nTrump\u2019s job approval in Michigan, by the way, was 43/53 last month. It\u2019s not unthinkable that James will run ahead of him on the ballot next fall; it happened in Florida in 2016, for instance, with Marco Rubio winning 200,000 more votes in his Senate race than Trump did in the presidential contest. If Trump can make Michigan as close in 2020 as he did in 2016, James could potentially win narrowly even if Trump loses narrowly. But a presidential job approval above 43 percent on Election Day would be \u2026 preferable, needless to say.", "description": "Hope.", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/jj.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
