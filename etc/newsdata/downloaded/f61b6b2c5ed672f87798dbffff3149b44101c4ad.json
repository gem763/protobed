But the office cleared her of two other alleged violations, involving a tweet defending HUD Secretary Ben Carson and an appearance at an oversight hearing featuring Michael Cohen.\n\n\u201cAlthough OSC concluded that you violated the Hatch Act by unwittingly displaying a campaign hat in your office and \u2018liking\u2019 partisan political tweets on your official Twitter account, we have decided not to pursue disciplinary action and are closing our files without further action,\u201d Erica Hamrick, deputy chief of the OSC\u2019s Hatch Act Unit, wrote in a letter to Patton Wednesday.\n\nPatton released a statement thanking the office on Wednesday, calling it \"an unbiased voice in Washington.\"\n\n\u201cOSC has determined that I did not violate the Hatch Act as it pertained to my attendance at the Michael Cohen hearing, as well as my tweet defending Secretary Carson,\u201d she said in an e-mail.\n\n\u201cOSC decided not to pursue disciplinary action for two minor infractions,\u201d she added of the two incidents where the office found fault. \u201cI look forward to continuing to focus on the residents of New York and New Jersey, whose well-being I care about the most.\u201d\n\nPatton, who previously worked as the vice president of the Eric Trump Foundation and reportedly planned Eric Trump\u2019s wedding before her appointment to the senior post at HUD, earlier this year said that she didn\u2019t care whether she violated the Hatch Act.\n\nShe wrote on Facebook in May that a tweet she had reposted defending Carson \u201cmay be a Hatch Act violation. It may not be. Either way, I honestly don\u2019t care anymore\u2026\u201d\n\nThe reposted tweet also took a swipe at Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s (D-N.Y.) intelligence, but the OSC determined that message did not run afoul of the Hatch Act because neither Carson nor Ocasio-Cortez were candidates for office at the time.\n\nOSC also concluded that Patton\u2019s appearance at the hearing featuring Cohen did not break the rules, since she was on leave and \u201cappeared at the hearing in [her] personal capacity,\u201d according to Hamrick\u2019s letter to Patton.\n\nThere are four tweets OSC found did violate the law. Patton liked a tweet from Trump endorsing then-candidate Ron DeSantis\u2019 run for governor of Florida; a Republican National Committee tweet criticizing Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.); a Republican Party tweet advocating for Mike Pompeo to be named secretary of State; and a Kanye West tweet about getting his Make America Great Again hat signed.\n\n\u201cPlease be advised that if in the future you engage in prohibited political activity while employed in a position covered by the Hatch Act, we will consider such activity to be a willful and knowing violation of the law, which could result in further action,\u201d Hamrick wrote to Patton.\n\nThe watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which brought the initial complaints against Patton, released a statement lamenting the outcome.\n\n\u201cAfter years of serving Donald Trump\u2019s interests, it appears that Lynne Patton is still doing so in her taxpayer-funded job,\u201d CREW Executive Director Noah Bookbinder said in an emailed statement. \u201cIn a democracy, laws preventing the government from acting to keep itself in power are crucial, and we will work tirelessly to see that they are enforced.\u201d\n\nPatton is not the first Trump administration official to land in trouble over Hatch Act violations. In June, OSC recommended that senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway be removed from her job for multiple violations of the law.\n\nConway had previously dismissed questions about her alleged violations.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re trying to silence me through the Hatch Act, it\u2019s not going to work. Let me know when the jail sentence starts,\u201d Conway said in May.\n\nThis article tagged under: Department Of Housing And Urban Development", "description": "But the OSC also \u201cdecided her violations do not warrant disciplinary action,\u201d Erica Hamrick, deputy chief of the OSC\u2019s Hatch Act Unit, wrote.", "authors": ["Katy O'Donnell"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/65/40/26017e964324947a7043dea07c36/190918-lynne-patton-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
