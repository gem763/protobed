I want him to die.\"\n\nUnder the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, a prime minister must have the backing of at least two-thirds of the UK's 650 MPs before a poll can be called outside of the fixed five-year terms.\n\nThe Lib Dems say they will vote against an early election at this stage.\n\nDowning Street said the 21 Tory MPs who rebelled in Tuesday's vote would have the whip removed, effectively expelling them from the parliamentary party and meaning they could not stand as Conservative candidates in the election.\n\nAmong the jettisoned rebels are former justice secretary David Gauke, Winston Churchill's grandson Sir Nicholas Soames, and Rory Stewart, who recently stood against Boris Johnson to be the party leader.\n\nThe former international development secretary told the Today programme he was sacked by text message, as he was being given the GQ magazine award for politician of the year.\n\n\"It was a pretty astonishing moment,\" he said. \"It feels a little bit like something you associate with other countries - one opposes the leader, one loses the leadership race, no longer in the cabinet and now apparently thrown out of the party and one's seat too.\"\n\nMr Stewart said the decision to stop him standing as a candidate was \"un-Conservative\" and the final decision should rest with local associations and not be made centrally.\n\nPlease upgrade your browser to view this interactive Did your MP vote in favour of allowing the government to suspend Parliament in order to secure Brexit on 30 October?
