It published explicit photos of the politician.\n\nMs Hill, one of few openly bisexual women in Congress, has denied having the inappropriate relationship and says the claims are part of a \u2018smear\u2019 campaign waged by an abusive husband.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe says her husband, whom she is in the process of divorcing, and \u2018hateful political operatives\u2019 have \u2018weaponised\u2019 the photos against her.\n\nKatie Hill shot into the spotlight after winning her seat in 2018 (Picture: EPA)\n\nShe wrote in a statement on Sunday: \u2018It is with a broken heart that today I announce my resignation from Congress.\n\n\u2018Having private photos of personal moments weaponized against me has been an appalling invasion of my privacy.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s also illegal, and we are currently pursuing all of our available legal options.\u2019\n\n\u2018However, I know that as long as I am in Congress, we\u2019ll live fearful of what might come next and how much it will hurt.\u2019\n\nHer resignation will take effect on Friday.\n\nMs Hill wrote to supporters shortly before the congressional probe was launched acknowledging a different \u2018inappropriate relationship\u2019 with a female 2018 campaign staff member.\n\nMs Hill has vowed to fight \u2018exploitation\u2019 against women after stepping down (Picture: Katie Hill)\n\nBut this relationship fell outside House rules, having taken place before she was elected.\n\nShe says the relationship began in the final \u2018tumultuous\u2019 years of her marriage to Kenny Heslep, who she married in 2010 and described as \u2018my best friend and the love of my life\u2019 as recently as two years ago.\n\nIn the letter to supporters, she said: \u2018I know that even a consensual relationship with a subordinate is inappropriate, but I still allowed it to happen despite my better judgment. For that I apologise.\u2019\n\nShe added in Sunday\u2019s statement: \u2018Now, my fight is going to be to defeat this type of exploitation that so many women are victims to and which will keep countless women and girls from running for office or entering public light.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Democrat rose to the spotlight after winning the last Republican-held House seat in Los Angeles County, part of a wave of polls in 2018 that saw Donald Trump\u2019s party driven out of Southern California.\n\nHer campaign had raised $2.2 million (\u00a31.7 million) this year alone.\n\nShe is also vice-chair of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, which has been probing President Trump\u2019s finances.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
