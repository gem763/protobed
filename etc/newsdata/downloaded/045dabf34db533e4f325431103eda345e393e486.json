The president went on to deliver a wide-ranging speech that mirrored his usual campaign rally fare. He defended his tariffs on Chinese goods, took aim at the media, denounced energy-efficient light bulbs and warned that Democrats are \u201cnot big believers in religion.\u201d\n\nHe also drew cheers from the crowd when he joked that he would remain in office through 2026 so that he could be president when the United States co-hosts the World Cup that year.\n\nThe White House\u2019s heavy involvement in the race \u2014 the president, vice president and Trump\u2019s chief of staff spent at least part of their day in rural North Carolina \u2014 stood in contrast to Trump\u2019s remarks earlier Monday, when he denied that the contest had any national importance.\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t see it as a bellwether,\u201d Trump told reporters outside the White House. \u201cThey always ask that question.\u201d\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump arrives at a campaign rally Monday at the Crown Expo Center in Fayetteville, N.C. (Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nThe 9th District has long been in Republican hands, and Trump won it by 12 percentage points over Hillary Clinton in 2016. But recent polling has shown Democrat Dan McCready within striking distance of Bishop, upping the stakes for both parties in a race that is being closely watched for insights into the 2020 electoral landscape.\n\nAfter Trump called him onstage, Bishop, a state senator best known for sponsoring North Carolina\u2019s controversial \u201cbathroom bill,\u201d thanked the president and told supporters that \u201cthe last thing he needs is for the 9th District to send him another Nancy Pelosi clone.\u201d\n\nContrary to Bishop\u2019s claim, McCready has sought to distance himself from Pelosi and previously pledged not to support the California Democrat for speaker.\n\nIf McCready wins on Tuesday, Republicans in Washington worry that even more members of their party will announce retirements in the coming weeks, joining the 16 who have already fled for the exits. If Bishop wins, meanwhile, Trump probably will point to the victory as evidence that he is an asset, not a liability, to Republican candidates next fall.\n\nAware of the race\u2019s potential impact, outside groups have spent a combined total of more than $10 million to boost McCready and Bishop, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. That\u2019s on top of the nearly $5 million McCready\u2019s campaign has spent and the $2 million spent by Bishop\u2019s campaign.\n\nVoters in North Carolina\u2019s heavily-Republican 3rd District will also go to the polls on Tuesday to elect a successor to the late congressman Walter B. Jones (R). The Republican candidate in that race, Greg Murphy, briefly joined Trump onstage Monday night. As he and Bishop took their turns standing next to Trump, both men were wearing a dark suit and bright red tie that appeared to be inspired by the president\u2019s signature look.\n\nAt one point during the event, after Bishop\u2019s remarks, Trump paused while an attendee who had a medical episode received assistance. He then quipped, \u201cI guess Dan\u2019s speech wasn\u2019t so good.\u201d\n\nTrump has loomed large over the 9th District race. Bishop\u2019s closing TV ad features footage of the president praising him and blasting McCready as an \u201cultra liberal\u201d who \u201clikes open borders\u201d and \u201creally admires socialism.\u201d\n\nDemocrats seized on the rally, casting the appearance by Trump and Pence as a sign that the White House is deeply worried about losing the seat.\n\n\u201cThe president and vice president are in North Carolina today desperately trying to save a seat they won by double-digits in 2016,\u201d North Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Wayne Goodwin said in a statement.\n\nGoodwin also argued that Republicans had \u201ctried to steal this election by targeting the elderly, African-American, and Native American voters through the largest case of election fraud in modern history.\u201d\n\nMcCready had run for the seat in 2018 and had initially appeared to have lost to his Republican opponent, Mark Harris, by a razor-thin margin. But allegations that a Harris campaign contractor committed widespread ballot fraud prompted state and federal investigations and, ultimately, the voiding of the November 2018 election result.\n\nState election officials then ordered a special election; Harris decided not to run, and Bishop bested nine other candidates to win the Republican nomination. McCready ran unopposed.\n\nPence spent much of his day traveling with Bishop and campaigning on his behalf. He visited a Bishop campaign call center, delivered remarks at Wingate University and accompanied Bishop to two barbecue restaurants where they met with dozens of voters.\n\nIn interviews, attendees at the rally were generally forgiving of two of the president\u2019s recent stumbles \u2014 his incorrect claim that Alabama was going to be hit hard last week by Hurricane Dorian, and his now-rescinded invitation to Afghan and Taliban leaders to meet at Camp David.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to start somewhere,\u201d Bill Stewart, a 65-year-old rally attendee, said of Trump\u2019s move to invite the Taliban to U.S. soil in the days before the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. \u201cNo one else has ever tried to do this. It\u2019s just kill, kill, kill. Let\u2019s see if we can start a conversation \u2014 not necessarily a friendship, but a negotiation.\u201d\n\nSonmez reported from Washington.
