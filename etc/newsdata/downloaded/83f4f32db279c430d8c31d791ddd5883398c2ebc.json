I like it a lot.\n\nSet in a Firefly-esque \u201cWild West\u201d universe, Outlaw is a game where you fly a spaceship around, shoot at other spaceships, buy goods, sell goods, meet people and perform all kinds of missions across the galaxy.\n\nSimlar to Elite, then, but unlike that much bigger (and more sterile) affair, this is much more intimate, packing a proper story to drive you along (complete with cutscenes and dialogue) and some genuinely enjoyable space combat. I actually found the tone and overall experience very close to that found in 1993's Privateer, which as one of my favourite games of all time is a very good thing.\n\nSurprisingly \u2014 and I never played this game\u2019s predecessor, so series fans will have to bear with me \u2014 the actual fighting and flying here is great. Moving around with a controller felt smooth and natural (not always a given in this genre), and the use of space debris and lighting effects really gives everything a nice sense of movement.\n\nWhat I really liked, though, were the advances this game makes to what have become decades-old genre standards. Outlaw has a sort of soft auto-targeting system where you can lock onto an enemy ship and you\u2019ll just generally follow it, with your speed matched to theirs.\n\nIt\u2019s a great idea; it\u2019s generous enough to take one of the hassles out of space combat on a 2D screen (knowing where your opponent is while outside your direct view), but doesn\u2019t go too far, as the shooting and missile firing is still up to you.\n\nWhere it\u2019s not advancing, it simply knows to copy the best parts, like lifting X-Wing\u2019s shields/engine/firepower balancing act wholesale, which means combat in Outlaw is as strategic and frantic as you\u2019ll find in Lucasarts\u2019 old games.\n\nAnother nice touch: you can paint your ships, like an interstellar Forza.\n\nI even like Outlaws outside of the cockpit. The bars and taverns you can visit across the galaxy have games you can play, and one of them is pool. It\u2019s not some cheap approximation of the game, it\u2019s a full 3D simulation, right down to physics and shot predictions, and it\u2019s so good that I\u2019m not ashamed to say I\u2019ve spent almost as much time hustling the locals for spare change as I\u2019ve spent blasting pirates from my ships.\n\nSure, there are limitations. This isn\u2019t a modern blockbuster release, so the whole thing can feel a little thin and stretched out around the margins, with everything barring the combat itself feeling under-cooked. It\u2019s also lacking in some of the scale and complicated scripting of its 1990s inspiration.\n\nBut then... combat is the whole point here, and the combat is great, so that\u2019s fine by me. If Outlaws was going to get smart with its allocation of time and money, I\u2019m glad Double Damage chose to make the starfighter-blasting the focus, because really, that\u2019s why we\u2019re here.\n\nThat and the pool.", "description": "Harking back to the days of 1990s space shooters like Wing Commander and X-Wing, Rebel Galaxy Outlaw came out on PC last month from Double Damage games.
