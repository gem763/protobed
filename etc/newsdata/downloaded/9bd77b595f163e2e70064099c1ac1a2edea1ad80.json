Should they win a federal \u201ctrifecta\u201d \u2014 the White House, the Senate and the House of Representatives \u2014 they\u2019ll still have to deal with a Trump-branded judiciary. It\u2019s entirely possible that a future Democratic agenda would be circumscribed and unraveled by a Supreme Court whose slim conservative majority owes itself to minority government and constitutional hardball.\n\nSo what should Democrats do? They should play hardball back. Congress, according to the Judiciary Act of 1789, decides the number of judges. It\u2019s been 150 years since it changed the size of the Supreme Court. I think it\u2019s time to revisit the issue. Should Democrats win that trifecta, they should expand and yes, pack, the Supreme Court. Add two additional seats to account for the extraordinary circumstances surrounding the Gorsuch and Kavanaugh nominations. Likewise, expand and pack the entire federal judiciary to neutralize Trump and McConnell\u2019s attempt to cement Republican ideological preferences into the constitutional order.\n\nThe reasoning underpinning this proposal isn\u2019t just about the future; it\u2019s about the past. We have had two rounds of minority government in under two decades \u2014 two occasions where executive power went to the popular-vote loser. Rather than moderate their aims and ambitions, both presidents have empowered ideologues and aggressively spread their influence. We are due for a course correction.", "description": "", "authors": ["Jamelle Bouie", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Kavanaugh-Trump-Packing-Court.Html"], "top_image": ""}
