(Photo: K.M. Smither Photography)\n\n\n\nJared Brewer wanted to make his bedridden, pregnant wife happy, so he starred in her maternity shoot.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the birth of her first baby, Kelsey Brewer, 24, of Frankfort, Kentucky, was diagnosed with preeclampsia, which causes very high blood pressure. She was admitted twice to the hospital, missing her Sept. 25 maternity shoot scheduled with her sister, Kiana Smither of K.M. Smither Photography.\n\n\u201cKelsey was really bummed about not doing the shoot,\u201d Kelsey\u2019s husband Jared, 26, a geologist\u2019s assistant, tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cShe bought a white maternity dress, and we were going to take photos by a waterfall.\u201d\n\nSo Jared ran an idea past his sister-in-law. \u201cI said, \u2018What if I did the photo shoot with my belly hanging out?\u2019\u201d says Jared. \u201cI was half sarcastic, but Kiana had a lightbulb moment.\u201d\n\nJared, Kiana, and Kelsey\u2019s other sister went to Elkhorn Creek, where Kelsey had planned to pose. Wearing a white button-down shirt, jeans, and a baseball cap, Jared hammed it up for the camera, kneeling in the cool water, soaking his shirt, and cradling his \u201cfood baby.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe poses were mine and Kiana helped me with my facial expressions,\u201d Jared tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cWe laughed the whole time.\u201d\n\nJared could barely control his excitement when Kiana texted the photos to her sister. \u201cKelsey burst out laughing,\u201d he tells Yahoo Lifestyle.\n\nOn Saturday, Jared and Kelsey welcomed their son, Kash, who was born six weeks early and spent time in the hospital NICU. Now at home, they\u2019re planning a fall photo shoot. \u201cI might suck in [my stomach] for the next set of pictures,\u201d says Jared.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:", "description": "A pregnant mom-to-be had to miss her maternity shoot after she was put on bedrest.
