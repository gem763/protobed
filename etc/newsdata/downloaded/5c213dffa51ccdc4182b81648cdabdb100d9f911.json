However plans to develop the site into a 200-unit apartment tower were unsuccessful after the real estate group ran into opposition from local residents.\n\nAs revealed by The Australian Financial Review, Oliver Hume swung to a $2.2 million loss in the 2018 financial year following the housing market downturn and declining off-the-plan sales. Its 2018 accounts showed an $8.4 million write-down of land held for resale.\n\nA spokesman for Oliver Hume confirmed it had sold the Cribb Street site and said the expected loss had been included in its 2018 financial accounts.\n\n'We do not expect any further significant impairments from the sale in the 2019 financial account,\" he said.\n\n\"Oliver Hume Property Funds can confirm a contract of sale for the property at 32 Cribb Street, Milton, is now unconditional and due for settlement during the latter part of this year. The company has signed confidentiality agreements prohibiting the release of any details about the sale.\"\n\nIt is unclear how the sale of these two sites and the loss of any future development profits will affect Oliver Hume's ability to meet the returns it promised to its investors, most of whom are high-net-worth Asian investors.\n\nTitle deeds show the Brisbane site is held by Oliver Hume Property Funds (Cribb St) Milton Pty Ltd, with a mortgage to OHAPIF Pty Ltd.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"[The Brisbane] site was sold as part of Oliver Hume Property Fund\u2019s ongoing capital management strategy and the sale of this site, and another site in West Melbourne, allows Oliver Hume Property Funds to focus its capital on existing higher and better-use projects,\" the Oliver Hume spokesman said.\n\n\"In addition, the sale also allows us to focus on attractive opportunities that the market is currently presenting.\n\n\"We believe these opportunities will provide more attractive returns than those expected from the Brisbane fringe apartment market. We also see these opportunities being more aligned to the investment appetite of the investors who invest alongside Oliver Hume Property Funds in our projects.\"\n\nIn June, Oliver Hume Property Funds closed a fully subscribed $6 million syndicate for its The Verge land development project in Brisbane.\n\nThe syndicate offered an 8.5 per cent annual return before tax. The minimum investment was $50,000 held for three years.", "description": "The prominent Melbourne developer, fund manager and real estate agency paid almost $14m in July 2014 for 30 Cribb Street in Milton, but sold it for just $10m.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.0347%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_142/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/92d59e5a29e70b1486e9e56e19f950d0fcdc70a6", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
