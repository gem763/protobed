Do you know who this person is?\u2019\n\nThe woman was caught on camera stopping between cars (Picture: @roxyjacenko/Instagram)\n\nShe appears to have done it on more than one occasion (Picture: @roxyjacenko/Instagram)\n\nWhile on the second clip she commented: \u2018And again \u2013 today same lady again. What has the world come to?\u2019\n\nRoxy also shared a third video which shows the woman running down the street and asked her followers to contact her if they recognised her.\n\nShe told Daily Mail Australia she has seen human faeces on the street for three weeks, adding: \u2018It\u2019s disgusting.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a lovely street lined with heritage terraces, kids playing and riding their bikes. Human faeces shouldn\u2019t be on any street. Something needs to be done.\u2019\n\nShe claimed that her sharing of the videos has already resulted in several messages alluding to who the mystery defecator could be.\n\nAnother video of her running was shared online (Picture: @roxyjacenko/Instagram)\n\nResidents from the area will now discuss what they should do about the issue, she continued.\n\nOne neighbour told AAP anonymously that pooing once is \u2018fair enough if you\u2019re caught short\u2019, but said they had found human stool five times in the last three weeks.\n\nHowever, the resident added that the woman should not be shamed for her actions \u2018as she could possibly have a medical condition\u2019.\n\nPooing in public carries a maximum penalty of three months in prison and a $600 (\u00a3320) fine in New South Wales.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA NSW Police spokesperson said they was aware of the \u2018circumstances\u2019 of the jogger, but had not yet received an official complaint.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
