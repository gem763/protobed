(Cameron Spencer/Getty Images)\n\nIt will keep selling products online and some stores will stay open in the U.S.\n\nEventually, the company could get back on its feet. Or it could shut down completely.\n\nBut it means that in Canada, the people who work in the stores will soon be out of a job.\n\nWhy did this happen?\n\nThere are several reasons.\n\nIn a statement, the company said it needs time to \u201creposition the brand and global business to adapt to the current retail environment.\u201d\n\nMore people are shopping online, and only 16 per cent of Forever 21\u2019s sales were online, according to bankruptcy filings.\n\nThe chain also expanded very quickly in the last few years into very large spaces that were not sustainable, said Farla Efros, president of the HRC Retail Advisory.\n\nForever 21\u2019s initial success was in part thanks to its affordable merchandise, but that has ultimately been part of its undoing. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)\n\nForever 21 is also one of the first companies to specialize in \u201cfast fashion.\u201d\n\nThat means it was quickly taking runway looks and putting them in stores at very affordable prices.\n\nSounds like a good deal, right? Wrong\n\nThe concept of fast fashion has been under fire lately because the clothes don\u2019t last long and end up in landfills.\n\nBasically, it\u2019s bad for the environment and we know this is something kids are paying attention to.\n\nYoung people \u201care incredibly environmentally conscious,\" retail consultant Bruce Winder told CBC.\n\nTake Sophia Martucci, for example. She attended the climate strike in Montreal on Sept. 27.\n\n\u201cMy family, what we do, is we really reuse stuff instead of just throwing them out,\u201d she said.\n\nSophia Martucci, 12, shops at stores that sell used clothing. (Franca G. Mignacca/CBC)\n\nAt the strike, she pointed to her mom\u2019s sign about \u201chow stuff now is not as well made, so it has to go in the garbage, but we go to [a used clothing store] and reuse clothes and stuff.\u201d\n\nSome other retailers that have closed in Canada in the past few years:\n\nPayless Shoes.\n\nAmerican Apparel.\n\nJean Machine.\n\nGymboree.\n\nWant to know more about fast fashion?
