But can a civil person win against one of the meanest guys in D.C.?\n\nOne question predominates among Democratic voters assessing which candidate to nominate as the Democratic standard-bearer for 2020: \u201cCan they beat Donald Trump?\u201d\n\nOne person who thus far has not been deemed up to the task by prospective voters is New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who has been languishing deep in the second tier of candidates in national polls. So dire was the situation that his campaign put out a memo a little over a week ago warning that if it didn\u2019t raise $1.7 million by Sept. 30, Booker would be forced to drop out of the race. His supporters rallied, and on Monday his campaign announced he had reached its target.\n\nIs there a place for politeness?\n\nBooker has been dogged by concerns that his message of love and togetherness might not be right for the times. The New York Times summed it up in a headline: \u201cIs Cory Booker too nice? (And is that bad?)\u201d\n\nBut Booker believes strongly that his approach is the winning way.\n\nIn a recent interview, Booker told me that \u201cgrace and decency is the way to beat Trump. You can't beat him using his tactics, fighting him on his turf.\u201d Put another way: Never wrestle with a pig. The pig likes it and you get dirty.\n\nBad news for Biden and Sanders: Democratic activists want youth and diversity\n\nWhat we need is to have \u201ca revival of civic grace, to have a more courageous empathy, to get back to understanding that we share a common cause and common purpose, and most certainly share a common destiny.\u201d He lamented that Americans are \u201cfalling into tribalism in this country where we hate each other so much.\u201d\n\nSen.

Yet to many Americans, this kind of talk sounds weak. This is because we have a real misunderstanding about what strength is in politics. There is \u201cthis sort of toxic masculinity that is this idea that to be strong, you have to be an ass,\u201d Booker noted. \u201cThe antidote to this moment and time is not more Trumpiness. That's why I constantly remind people that love is not weak. Do not confuse strength with meanness. Do not confuse being tough with being cruel. In fact, they are opposites.\u201d\n\nStill, grace for your political enemies feels unnatural, even wrong. It\u2019s a posture that takes a lot of work to achieve. Booker himself admitted on \"Late Night with Seth Meyers\" in July that he sometimes feels like punching Trump. Many of us know that feeling, so Booker is in no way suggesting that anyone stop hating what Trump is doing to the country. He\u2019s not suggesting we have to be perfect and never utter a bad word about Trump or his allies. He\u2019s just outlining an approach to beating Trump that sounds counterintuitive in the era of clapbacks and cancel culture.\n\nKindness does not mean never scrutinizing\n\nIt also doesn\u2019t mean that Booker can never criticize his Democratic opponents. When Booker pointed out after the last debate that some people were concerned former Vice President Joe Biden might fumble the ball if he became the nominee, many commentators said he was off brand. But that\u2019s because our culture is confused about what grace looks like. Grace does not ask you to be a doormat or have no opinions or never criticize. Loving people does not require you to stay silent when you see something that merits being called out. Certainly, Booker\u2019s concerns about Biden deserved to be heard and considered.\n\nDem debates don't match the moment: Time to get serious about beating Trump\n\nWhen I presented Booker with the disturbing math I\u2019ve heard from too many Democrats behind the scenes that it will take a white man to beat Trump, he replied, \u201cThis idea that we need a safe candidate that we may not all be excited about, but he's the safe choice, is so contrary to our self-interest.\u201d He added, \u201cAnd by the way, you make a big mistake if during the campaign the person says something that's racially offensive. That steps in it. And that's why, as a lot of people have written after the last debate, please, Joe Biden, clarify what you were saying about black parents. Please give the guy a chance to clarify because what he said was offensive to black people.\u201d\n\nThis pointed criticism is certainly within bounds. A lack of grace involves much more than critiquing an opponent. It looks a lot more like the ad hominem attacks the president launches nearly daily against all who aren\u2019t actively worshiping him. It looks like Trump\u2019s relentless attempts to pit Americans against one another. Trump does this because he cannot survive in an ordered universe free of hatred and chaos, so he works overtime to create disorder. His best hope is that Democrats will sink into the mud with him so that voters will ultimately tune out in disgust, leaving only the most hardened partisans showing up to vote.\n\nCory Booker gets this. Whether he will break through with his message and vision remains to be seen. But he deserves a real hearing.\n\nKirsten Powers, a CNN news analyst, is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors and co-host of The Faith Angle podcast.
