He attributed this to the city's homelessness crisis and said the pollution put San Francisco in \"total violation\" of environmental regulations. City officials quickly refuted those claims.\n\nWithin San Francisco, the Tenderloin neighborhood has long been considered the heart of the city's homelessness crisis. The area is also home to the headquarters of several major tech companies like Twitter and Uber.\n\nRead more: UN expert: San Francisco's homelessness crisis is a human rights violation and suggests 'a cruelty that is unsurpassed'\n\nLast year, the New York Times attempted to find the epicenter of the crisis by pinpointing the dirtiest block in San Francisco. Statisticians compiled a list of streets with the most neighborhood complaints about sidewalk cleanliness, and the Times landed on a winner: Hyde Street's 300 block. Conditions there spurred more than 2,200 complaints over the last decade.\n\nJustin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nAccording to the Times, the block is populated with drug addicts and mentally ill residents, many of whom are part of the city's large homeless population. During the day, drug users reportedly host an outdoor market of sorts, selling heroin, crack cocaine, and amphetamines along the sidewalk.\n\nTenants have reported having to hose down urine in front of their offices or hold their breath to avoid the stench of feces. One local shop owner said drug users sometimes break off twigs from nearby trees to clean their crack pipes.\n\nBeck Diefenbach/Reuters\n\nSan Francisco spent $54 million on street cleaning in 2018. Both the Public Health Department and the Public Works Department claimed to have collected hundreds of thousands of needles in the Tenderloin last year. The city has also set aside nearly $3 million for a \"hot spots\" crew in charge of cleaning the areas near homeless encampments, and another $1 million for updates to Pit Stop, a program providing mobile toilets and dog-waste stations.\n\nThe city even has a \" poop patrol\" \u2014 those employees earn more than $184,000 a year to clean up feces.\n\nBut despite these efforts, the city has had a tough time getting ahead of the crisis, and the issue of sidewalk filth and rampant homelessness plagues many neighborhoods beyond the Tenderloin.\n\n\"I've lived in the Castro for 20 years and the homeless situation ... continues to flourish,\" one resident wrote in to the Times. Another said: \"I've been here 60 years and I am, saddened to say, ready to leave.\"", "description": "Residents of Hyde Street's 300 block report\u00a0having to hose down urine in front of their offices or hold their breath to avoid the stench of feces.", "authors": ["Aria Bendix"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5bbcb95b66fb3f1ccf451708-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
