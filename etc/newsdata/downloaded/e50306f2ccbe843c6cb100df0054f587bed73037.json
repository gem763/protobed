That was the closest the debate came to acknowledging the importance of faith in many people\u2019s lives.\n\nSign Up for the Morning Briefing Newsletter\n\nWhile the percentage of Americans who don\u2019t identify with any religion has grown significantly over the past decade \u2014 to 26 percent from 17 percent, according to a sweeping survey by the Pew Research Center \u2014 it\u2019s still the case that more than half of Americans say that they pray daily and 45 percent attend religious services at least once a month.\n\nBut you wouldn\u2019t know it to tune into the Democratic primary.\n\nIf many Republican candidates travel far out of their way, toward the bogs of histrionics and hypocrisy, to recruit the Almighty into electoral service, many Democrats steer clear of religion. That\u2019s partly understandable, even admirable: In light of the rightful separation of church and state, they don\u2019t want to be seen as spotlighting or peddling any one creed.\n\nBut it\u2019s not necessary, and it\u2019s not smart.\n\n[Get a more personal take on politics, newsmakers and more with Frank Bruni\u2019s exclusive commentary every week.

Beto O\u2019Rourke, for example, recently seemed to call for religious groups that don\u2019t support marriage equality to lose their tax-exempt status, an outlier position that the president immediately seized on and railed against. (O\u2019Rourke\u2019s aides later insisted that he was misunderstood.)\n\nDemocrats would make it harder for Trump to vilify them as enemies of so-called traditional values if they talked a bit more about spirituality and religion \u2014 including, if applicable, their own.\n\nThat might not matter in the bluest parts of the bluest states, said Mike McCurry, a Democratic consultant who served as the White House press secretary under President Bill Clinton and now teaches at the Wesley Theological Seminary in Washington. But, he added, \u201cI sure as hell believe that it would work in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, and that\u2019s what it\u2019s all going to come down to.\u201d\n\nThe church-state divide shouldn\u2019t dissuade the candidates, McCurry told me. \u201cThat\u2019s such a misreading of what the political DNA of America is,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have had religion woven into our political structures and our political debate from the very beginning.\u201d\n\nBesides, he added, a Democrat who speaks persuasively about religion has a potentially huge tactical advantage: \u201cThink ahead to the general election. If you\u2019re talking about faith in an authentic, genuine way, imagine the contrast if you\u2019re running against Donald Trump, who has absolutely none of that vocabulary.\u201d While the president may have the farthest reaches of the religious right locked down, many Americans of faith are appalled by him.\n\nAnd he\u2019s vulnerable not just because of his personal history and public demeanor, which amount to a raging bonfire of the pieties. He also has governed in ways that contradict the principles of charity and mercy that are central to many religions.\n\nPete Buttigieg took gorgeously effective note of this in the Democrats\u2019 first debate, in June, referring to the Trump administration\u2019s treatment of migrants at the border.\n\n\u201cThe Republican Party likes to cloak itself in the language of religion,\u201d he observed. \u201cBut we should call out hypocrisy when we see it.\u201d And any political party that suggests that \u201cGod would smile on the division of families at the hands of federal agents \u2014 that God would condone putting children in cages \u2014 has lost all claim to ever use religious language again.\u201d\n\nButtigieg, a churchgoing Episcopalian, refuses to cede religion to Republicans or let them use it as some crude moral cudgel. He weaves it into discussions of his marriage to another man. \u201cNothing has made me feel more connected, more able to be true, however imperfectly, to my faith than the experience of putting myself second,\u201d he said at a CNN town hall this month. \u201cThat came with committing my life to my husband, Chasten.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s not the only Democratic presidential candidate with religion in his history and on his mind. He\u2019s just unusual in his readiness to mention it.\n\nIn the Democratic debates, Elizabeth Warren, a Methodist, has repeatedly reflected on her past as a teacher. But she has never taken the few extra syllables to note that she taught Sunday school.\n\nIn terms of connecting with as much of the electorate as possible, that\u2019s a mistake. And in terms of the president\u2019s nonexistent moral fluency, it\u2019s a blown opportunity.\n\nI invite you to sign up for my free weekly email newsletter.
