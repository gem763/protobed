But Rudy Giuliani is already hinting at a new front in his questionable offensive against former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son. And it\u2019s a charge that Trump allies outside the White House have been pursuing for months.\n\nA group of conservative activists closely aligned with the president\u2014including former White House adviser Steve Bannon, conservative author Peter Schweizer, and anti-Muslim activist Frank Gaffney\u2014are trying to spread dirt on Hunter Biden\u2019s work in China. Their efforts have come as almost all of the national political attention is focused on Giuliani\u2019s and President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure the Ukrainian government into investigating alleged corruption involving the former VP\u2019s son, who formerly sat on the board of an energy company in the country.\n\nGiuliani himself has barely concealed his desire to see a second line of attack opened on the younger Biden over his involvement in an investment fund called Rosemont Seneca, which Biden ran with Christopher Heinz, the stepson of former Secretary of State John Kerry. In his protracted interview last week with CNN host Chris Cuomo, Trump\u2019s attorney said the word \u201cChina\u201d more than a dozen times to draw attention to the matter. Giuliani and Trump have also talked about China as a liability for Biden and his son in recent conversations, according to a source with knowledge of the discussions.\n\nReached for comment on Monday afternoon, Giuliani said he couldn\u2019t comment on his private conversation with President Trump, \u201cexcept to say I\u2019ve done nothing on China but repeat what others have reported but it really looks bad.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s arguably worse than Ukraine,\u201d he added for good measure.\n\nAs with Hunter Biden\u2019s work in Ukraine, his supposed China controversy is rooted in the investigative work of Schweizer, a conservative journalist whose 2016 book, Clinton Cash, raised conflict-of-interest allegations surrounding Hillary Clinton and her family\u2019s foundation that dogged the former secretary of state\u2019s 2016 presidential bid.\n\nSchweizer\u2019s 2018 book, Secret Empires, sought to tie Rosemont\u2019s investment activity to Vice President Biden\u2019s senior government position. Giuliani has spotlighted a $1.5 billion private equity deal between Rosemont and the Bank of China in his allegations of corruption. That figure came directly from Schweizer, who reported that a Rosemont entity secured a $1.5 billion deal with the bank a couple weeks after Hunter Biden traveled to Beijing with his father aboard Air Force Two in 2013.\n\nOn both fronts\u2014Ukraine and China\u2014Biden\u2019s presidential campaign insists the attacks are scurrilous. In a memo to reporters on Monday, a campaign spokesman called the corruption allegations at the heart of the charge \u201ca roundly debunked conspiracy theory\u201d that \u201cTrump and Giuliani have tried to manipulate the media into repeating.\u201d Schweizer\u2019s reporting laid out a conspicuous timeline, but didn\u2019t establish any actual connection between the Bidens\u2019 trip to China and Rosemont\u2019s Bank of China-backed venture. Hunter Biden wasn\u2019t even a Rosemont equity owner while his father served as vice president, according to his attorneys, and he has said that he conducted no business while on that 2013 trip.\n\nNevertheless, Schweizer has called for additional government investigations into the Bank of China investment, as well as his business activities in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cWill the Senate investigate Joe and Hunter Biden\u2019s actions in China and Ukraine? We don\u2019t know, but they should,\u201d Schweizer wrote in a May column in the New York Post.\n\nThat column ran about two weeks after a group of Trump allies assembled in New York for a conference on the economic threat posed to the U.S. by Beijing. The event was sponsored by a new group called the \u201cCommittee on the Present Danger: China,\u201d which is led in part by Gaffney, the president of the Center for Security Policy, a right-wing foreign policy group that alleges Biden and his family have \u201cprofited handsomely\u201d from \u201cbusiness-as-usual with Beijing.\u201d\n\nThe committee\u2019s event in April featured remarks from Bannon, who cited Schweizer\u2019s reporting in going after Biden\u2019s presidential candidacy.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden\u2019s gotta come one hundred percent clean on his relationship and his family\u2019s relationship with the [Chinese Communist Party],\u201d Bannon declared at the April conference. \u201cWe need to know every piece of involvement that Joe Biden has had with the Chinese Communist Party, the Bank of China and all the financial institutions in China.\u201d\n\nBannon and Schweizer are longtime collaborators; the latter is a senior contributor to Breitbart News, the website that Bannon led before joining the Trump White House in 2017. Bannon also previously sat on the board of Schweizer\u2019s nonprofit group, the Government Accountability Institute. That group is chaired by Rebekah Mercer, who also led Cambridge Analytica, the controversial pro-Trump data firm where Bannon previous served as a vice president. Her Mercer Family Foundation provided nearly two-thirds of all contributions to GAI from 2013 through 2017, according to annual tax filings.\n\nThe GAI appeared to anticipate being thrust into the middle of the 2020 presidential contest though its reporting on Biden and other prominent political figures. Last month, the group\u2019s attorney requested an advisory opinion from the Federal Election Commission officially certifying that its public communications would not be considered political advertisements for the purposes of federal law.\n\nThose communications are nonetheless informing political attacks on Biden\u2019s candidacy. The Republican National Committee, seeking to keep attention on Hunter Biden rather than the president\u2019s controversial efforts to force a Ukrainian investigation of his conduct, leaned heavily on Schweizer\u2019s work in a lengthy statement on Monday going after Biden\u2019s \u201ctangled history of swampy dealings and quid pro quo.\u201d\n\nThat statement went beyond Hunter Biden\u2019s work in Ukraine, and hit the same allegations regarding Rosemont that informed Bannon\u2019s attack on Biden at the committee conference in April.\n\nThe expanded focus on the Bidens\u2019 work in China comes even as attacks centering on their activity in Ukraine have landed Trump in an increasingly delicate political position. The president has all but admitted pressing authorities in Ukraine to pursue a corruption investigation against Hunter Biden, and the ensuing fallout in Washington has galvanized congressional Democrats seeking to impeach the president.\n\nBut Trump doesn\u2019t appear to be minding the backlash\u2014quite the opposite, in fact. Though Giuliani was widely ridiculed for his interview with Cuomo, Trump was ecstatic.\n\nShortly after the interview ended, Trump congratulated his personal attorney for sticking it to CNN, and told him how happy he was that Giuliani and others were getting allegations of Biden\u2019s corruption out into the mainstream, according to a source with direct knowledge of Trump and Giuliani\u2019s conversation. Indeed, the day after the CNN tussle, Giuliani was all smiles as one of the president\u2019s guests at a black-tie White House state dinner.\n\nThe president also made a specific point of telling Giuliani to keep going on TV and cable news shows in the coming days, to focus as much attention as possible on Joe and Hunter Biden, this source added.\n\nThe interaction underscored Trump\u2019s eagerness to engage in a fight that much of official Washington considers to be a politically dicey one at best, and a deeply costly one at worst. And it puts him on a collision course with others in his party. On Monday, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) encouraged the president to release a transcript of a July phone call he had with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2014during which Trump reportedly asked Zelensky eight times to investigate Hunter Biden\u2014as a way of getting the controversy off the docket.\n\nTrump has publicly suggested that he could be comfortable with a transcript being released. But privately, according to two people who\u2019ve spoken to him about this, the president believes the ongoing controversy over the unreleased transcript has been politically advantageous to him.\n\n\u201cHe is absolutely enjoying that this is being dragged out,\u201d said one senior administration official.", "description": "The president and his allies, from Peter Schweizer to Frank Gaffney, want to open a new front on the former VP\u2019s son, even as their Ukraine gambit appears to have backfired.", "authors": ["Lachlan Markay", "Asawin Suebsaeng", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569288113/190923-lachlan-trump-world-tease-2_c5ibtt", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
