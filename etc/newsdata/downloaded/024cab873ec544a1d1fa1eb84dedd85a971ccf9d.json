He was cleanly shaven in contrast to the long beard he had grown while holed up in Ecuador's embassy.\n\nAssange, 48, faces 18 counts in the U.S. including conspiring to hack government computers and violating an espionage law. He could spend decades in prison if convicted.\n\nJulian Assange has appeared in court again today in the latest hearing over his potential extradition to the U.S. He is pictured in a prison van leaving court in London in May\n\nJulian Assange pictured as he is led out of the Ecuadorian Embassy in London in handcuffs following his arrest by British police in April. He is being investigated in Sweden and the U.S.\n\nFormer home secretary Sajid Javid signed an order in June allowing Assange to be extradited to the US over the computer-hacking allegations.\n\nToday's appearance was to plan a full hearing where the argument for and against his extradition will be heard. That full hearing is due in court in February.\n\nHowever, if the case goes to a series of appeals, it could be 2025 before Assange is actually sent to the U.S.. He is likely to remain in jail for that time and it is estimated jail and court costs would run to nearly \u00a3600,000.\n\nAssange was jailed for 50 weeks in the UK in May after he jumped bail by going into hiding in the Ecuadorian embassy in London.\n\nThe WikiLeaks founder was due to be released from HMP Belmarsh on September 22, but was told at a court hearing last month that he would be kept in jail because of 'substantial grounds' for believing he would abscond.\n\nIn May, WikiLeaks said it had 'grave concerns' about Assange's health after he was moved to a medical ward in Belmarsh Prison.\n\nUS actress Pamela Anderson also visited Assange at the high-security jail on May 7\n\nAssange has also hosted Chinese artist Ai Weiwei (left) and his father John Shipton (right) at HMP Belmarsh earlier this year\n\nWhen he did not appear for a scheduled hearing that month, chief magistrate Emma Arbuthnot referred to the Australian as 'not very well'.\n\nAssange entered the embassy in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he was wanted in connection with sexual offence allegations.\n\nHe spent nearly seven years living inside until being dramatically dragged out by police in April after Ecuador revoked his political asylum.\n\nAssange has insisted he was 'doing journalism that has won many, many awards and protected many, many people'.\n\nHe has hosted a number of high-profile visitors in jail, including former Baywatch star Pamela Anderson and Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.\n\nWhat is the process for extraditing someone to the US and how far down the path is Julian Assange? 1. Extradition request is made to the Secretary of State. In Assange's case, this took place in June, when the U.S. authorities sent a formal request to Sajid Javid. 2. Secretary of State decides whether to certify the request. In Assange's case, this happened in June. 3. Judge decides whether to issue a warrant for arrest. This was not necessary in Assange's case, as he is already in custody for breaching his bail. 4. Preliminary and case management hearings. The first of these took place in June with a further hearing today. An earlier attempt to hold the hearing was delayed when Assange was said to be too ill to come to court. 5. Extradition hearing. A full hearing of the issues will later be presented to a court. U.S. Authorities will be represented by one team of lawyers. Assange's case will be represented by his own lawyers. This is due to take place in February. A judge will then decide whether there is 'prima facie evidence of guilt' and whether extradition would breach a person's human rights. 6. Appeal. A judge's decision to extradite someone can be appealed in the High Court. Assange declined to consent to be extradite, suggesting he is planning to appeal any decision against him. 7. Secretary of State decides whether to order extradition. The final decision is then made by the Home Secretary. Mr Javid's comments today suggest that if he were to still be Home Secretary at that time, this would be a formality. 8. Possible further appeal. People facing extradition can also appeal the Home Secretary's rubber stamping of their case in the High Court and potentially the Supreme Court. The history of Assange's case suggests this is likely if the case gets this far. It is thought Assange's series of appeals could drag on until 2025.", "description": "Assange, dressed in a navy suit and blue jumper, raised his fist to supporters in the public gallery.
