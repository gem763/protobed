If you see something, say something by calling 911.\"\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department also announced last week that it would \"maintain high visibility around movie theaters\" during \"Joker\" screenings.\n\n\"Joker\" is a gritty, R-rated origin story about the famous Batman villain. Reviews for the film have been mostly positive, but have noted its graphic violence. Business Insider's Jason Guerrasio wrote in his review that \"Joker\" is \"an ultra-violent drama that takes heavy influence from movies like Martin Scorsese's 'The King of Comedy' and 'Taxi Driver.'\"\n\nConcerns about the movie gained national attention after a letter was sent to the studio Warner Bros. last week by family members of the victims of the 2012 Aurora, Colorado movie-theater mass shooting, in which 12 people were killed and 70 more injured during a midnight screening of the Batman movie \"The Dark Knight Rises.\"\n\nThe shooter sparked comparisons to the Joker because of his bright-orange, dyed hair. Reports at the time indicated that he told arresting officers to call him \"The Joker,\" but that has since been debunked by The Denver Post.\n\nThe letter did not call for a boycott of the movie, but urged Warner Bros. to to use its \"political clout and leverage in Congress to actively lobby for gun reform,\" according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\n\"My worry is that one person who may be out there \u2014 and who knows if it is just one \u2014 who is on the edge, who is wanting to be a mass shooter, may be encouraged by this movie,\" Sandy Phillips (no relation to \"Joker\" director Todd Phillips), whose 24-year-old daughter Jessica Ghawi was among those killed, told THR.\n\nThe Cinemark theater where the shooting took place, Century Aurora and XD, will not be showing \"Joker.\" A theater employee told THR that \"advance ticket purchases were not available because the film will not be shown at the venue.\"\n\nDespite public concerns, \"Joker\" is still expected to be a box-office hit this weekend and is projected to break the domestic October box-office record currently held by \"Venom\" with $80 million. Boxoffice Pro is anticipating that the movie could even make over $100 million.", "description": "A law enforcement official told Deadline that the NYPD will have a \"360-degree policing approach\" to \"Joker\" screenings.", "authors": ["Travis Clark"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d94b10b62f8d8079508c0f5?width=1200&format=jpeg"}
