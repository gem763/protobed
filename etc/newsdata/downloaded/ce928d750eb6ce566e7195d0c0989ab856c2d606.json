I wasn\u2019t taking care of myself,\" she says of life before her break. \"I was the last thing on my list of priorities ... I spent 99% of my life as the public persona and just a microscopic crumb of a fraction in my real life. I needed to not have something to do all the time.\"\n\nZellweger, now 50, also saw a therapist years back and realized she was depressed.\n\n\"I think the majority of the films that I\u2019ve made wouldn\u2019t get made today.\" After Bridget Jones, after the Harvey-at-Miramax years, after a break from acting, Ren\u00e9e Zellweger is ready to play Judy Garland https://t.co/E7xmOaZrg5 \u2014 Vulture (@vulture) September 3, 2019\n\nThough she didn't explicitly say it was the plastic surgery rumors in 2014, she talked about an \"international humiliation\" that set her priorities right.\n\n\u201cNothing like international humiliation to set your perspective right! ... It clarifies what\u2019s important to you. And it shakes off any sort of clingy superficiality,\" she added. \"One of the fears that maybe, as artists, we all share \u2014 because we have this public experience of being criticized not just for our work but as human beings \u2014 is when it gets to be too much, when you learn that your skin is not quite as thick as you need it to be, what is that gonna feel like? Well, now I know. I got the hardest kick. And it ain\u2019t the end.\"\n\nBut when the \"plastic-surgery kerfuffle,\" as the reporter calls it, is brought up, the actress doesn't hold back.\n\n\"It probably gives you a stomachache, asking me about that, doesn\u2019t it?\" she says. \"Well, because there\u2019s a value judgment that\u2019s placed on us. As if it somehow is a reflection of your character \u2014 whether you\u2019re a good person or a weak person or an authentic person. And the implication that I somehow needed to change what was going on because it wasn\u2019t working.\"\n\nShe added, \"That makes me sad. I don\u2019t look at beauty in that way. And I don\u2019t think of myself in that way. I like my weird quirkiness, my off-kilter mix of things. It enables me to do what I do. I don\u2019t want to be something else.\"", "description": "Oscar-winner Renee Zellweger opens up about those plastic surgery rumors that made headlines five years ago and why she needed to step away from the spotlight.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/renee-gty-er-190904_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
