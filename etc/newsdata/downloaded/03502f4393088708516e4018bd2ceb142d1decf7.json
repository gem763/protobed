They obviously play to their strengths and that is no different to us. It\u2019s about maximising your strengths whatever you believe they are.\u201d\n\nBefore their most recent game against Argentina, Pumas captain Agustin Creevy said of England: \u201cI think sometimes [their structure] is boring. They are really structured but it\u2019s good for them, it works.\u201d\n\nAnd ahead of Saturday\u2019s quarter-final against Australia, scrum coach Neal Hatley confessed: \u201cI do sometimes like five 5-metre scrums in a row and a few driven lineouts.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of our game,\u201d he added. \u201cThere\u2019s a role for all sorts. It\u2019s how you maximise the strength of the players you\u2019ve got that\u2019s key.\u201d\n\nHaving seen Japan\u2019s levels of skill and the freedom with which it is expressed, some will wonder why England have not come close to such high-octane play out here. They are not short of x-factor talent themselves.\n\n\u201cWe do things a little bit differently,\u201d came the reply from Hatley, who spent time with Japan coaches Jamie Joseph and Tony Brown in the England camp during the Six Nations.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"It's like getting to 10 - you can do five plus five or seven plus three. Japan go seven plus three, we might go different.\n\n\u201cThey have a different way of looking, a different way of thinking. It doesn\u2019t make it right, it\u2019s just a different approach.\u201d\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nAs England learned to their cost in 2015 it is results, not style of play, that teams are ultimately judged on in World Cups.\n\nAt this stage four years ago they had checked out of their Manchester hotel and departed the tournament in humiliation.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\n\u201cThat seems a long time ago now,\u201d said Ford. \u201cObviously we\u2019re in a bit of a different position now and we want to make the most of it.\n\n\u201cWe understand the challenge ahead of us and how we have got to prepare for it. It is on us lads to really get hold of this week tactically, but also make sure we peak on Saturday.\u201d\n\nBilly Vunipola and Jack Nowell are injury doubts, having not trained fully.
