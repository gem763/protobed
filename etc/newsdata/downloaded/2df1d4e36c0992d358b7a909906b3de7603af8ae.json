Despite other major games sweeping up millions of players, like Fortnite and Roblox, Minecraft continues to quietly dominate. As of this week, the game now has over 112 million players every month.\n\nThat represents a jump of over over 20 million players since the last time Microsoft announced as much, back in October 2018 \u2013 an absolutely massive increase in players, considering the game has been available for over 10 years. The number includes players across game consoles, computers, mobile devices, and the education-focused version of the game.\n\nNotably, Minecraft isn\u2019t free on the many platforms it\u2019s available on.\n\nThe tens of millions of new players Minecraft added in the last year all bought the game in one form or another, whether it was a direct purchase of a physical copy, part of Microsoft\u2019s Game Pass subscription service, or a digital purchase.\n\nImage: Nvidia/Microsoft (\u2018Minecraft\u2019 is getting a major graphics overhaul on PC which employs a burgeoning graphics technology called \u2018Ray Tracing.\u2019 Microsoft is working with NVIDIA on the update, using NVIDIA\u2019s RTX graphics cards.)\n\nMinecraft Is Getting Ray Tracing Minecraft's long awaited graphics update might be no more, but the classic block-builder has still gotten a visual upgrade thanks to ray tracing.

It had rudimentary graphics and controls. It was only available on PC. It was prone to breaking, because it was an unfinished game being made by a single person.\n\nAnd yet, millions of people bought and played that early version of \u201cMinecraft.\u201d\n\nWhen Microsoft bought the game back in 2014 for $US2.5 billion ($3.6 billion), the tech world was surprised and confused by the purchase.\n\nBut clearly that early success has persisted under Microsoft\u2019s care across the past five years.\n\nThe YouTuber Playing Through Every Version Of Minecraft Is Finally Back At It Five years ago, one YouTuber began a Minecraft Let\u2019s Play unlike any other, one that spanned all the different versions of the game and examined how it changed over time. After a nearly three-year hiatus, it\u2019s coming back, with a nifty trailer.

Using Redstone, slime blocks and pistons, MrCatFace8885 was able to build a working plane in Minecraft without special mods. Though I\u2019m not sure I would actually want to fly in this loud, convulsing contraption. Read more\n\nIt\u2019s a system for fitting pieces together to create something \u2013 sometimes amazing somethings \u2013 from nothing. Minecraft provides endless building blocks and a blank canvas; it\u2019s up to you to create something incredible, or silly, or referential, or whatever else using the tools it provides. The tools are blessedly user-friendly, as are the systems for employing those tools.\n\nWith that in mind, it\u2019s easy to understand why Minecraft has been such a hit. That it\u2019s graphically rudimentary and simple to play just makes it all the more accessible to a massive audience \u2013 over 112 million people every month, apparently.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Business Insider.", "description": "For over a decade, Minecraft has been a cultural juggernaut.
