Ranson denied being far right \u2014 he's just an \"ordinary, working-class Brexiteer,\" he said \u2014 but he hurled angry abuse at Remain campaigners as they left the court.\n\nIt's been 1,210 days since Britain voted to leave the EU, and with each passing day of political gridlock, the rage of hard-line Brexiteers grows more intense. Their anger has boiled over into violent demonstrations, talk of civil war, and outright threats to pro-Remain campaigners. Increasingly, politicians and analysts are worried about the lengths to which these hard-liners will go, with some senior government ministers warning the country faces a \u201cviolent, popular uprising\u201d if Brexit never materializes.\n\n\u201cThe whole thing has become so toxic, it sometimes feels like we\u2019re on the verge of the Spanish Civil War,\u201d says Matthew Collins, head of research for the British anti-racist group Hope not Hate.\n\nSuch fears come at an already volatile time for the UK. Since the Brexit vote in 2016, hate crimes have spiked, and far-right extremists now pose the country\u2019s fastest growing terror threat, according to police. Critics say that Johnson, meanwhile, has only inflamed these fears by framing Brexit as a battle between the people and an obstructive Parliament.\n\n\u201cTo the gallows!\u201d\n\nThese dynamics were on full display outside the Supreme Court, where Ranson and his fellow activists gathered in one of their regular demonstrations to publicly demand Brexit and confront Remainers. Their main target that day was Gina Miller, a businesswoman turned Remain campaigner who had played a key role in bringing the legal challenge against the government.\n\nAs Miller left court for the day, the 53-year-old railway worker and his fellow activists rushed toward her, hurling insults across a line of police officers.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a bitch!\u201d Ranson roared. \u201cTo the gallows!\u201d\n\nFor Miller, whose campaigning against Brexit has made her one of the biggest hate figures for the British far-right, the abuse was nothing new.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m repeatedly told I\u2019m going to be the next Jo Cox,\u201d she told VICE News during a subsequent phone interview, referring to the Remain-supporting MP who was murdered by a far-right extremist one week before the 2016 referendum.\n\n\u201cOr I get things like \u2018a good gang rape\u2019 would sort me out. It\u2019s almost every day. It doesn\u2019t stop.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn this volatile climate, the Brexit betrayal narrative has become the central rallying cause for a broad, leaderless and loosely-affiliated movement \u2014 comprised of a far-right hooligans, Islamophobes, and conspiracy theorists. Over the past year, activists have maintained a near-constant presence outside Parliament to harass pro-Remain MPs, and regularly hold rowdy demonstrations demanding Brexit, with many displaying a flair for what Collins describes as an \u201calmost recreational form of violence.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m repeatedly told I\u2019m going to be the next Jo Cox\u201d\n\nWhat was especially concerning, he said, was the extent to which conspiracist thinking had taken hold within the movement, increasing their propensity for irrational violence against perceived enemies.\n\n\u201cThe potential for violence is there in that these people are desperate, they\u2019re driven by a conspiracy theory, and they think you can say anything you like and it\u2019s equal to the truth,\u201d said Collins.\n\nBrexit activists regularly voice a familiar grab-bag of far-right conspiracist grievances about globalists, immigration, Islam, and the media, alongside even more fringe theories. One popular Brexit activist account with nearly 30,000 followers, for example, has retweeted posts attempting to connect climate activist Greta Thunberg with the QAnon conspiracy theory.\n\nSpeaking outside the Supreme Court, Ranson acknowledged some fellow Brexiteers \u201ccross the line.\u201d But not long after, he appeared to endorse the sort of extreme actions politicians are worried about.\n\n\u201cIf Brexit fails to deliver, I think there\u2019s going to be civil disorder, seriously. And I would hold my hand up and say yeah, I will be part of that, because I\u2019ve been betrayed, democracy\u2019s dead,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are going to riot.\u201d\n\nAsked what role he would play in any unrest, he vacillated, saying he wasn\u2019t \u201cplanning on planting bombs\u201d anywhere, but he couldn't say how he would respond.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a short fuse. I can control it, but you don\u2019t know until the time comes.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe politicians have to do what the people tell them to do, and they\u2019re not. Personally, I would bloody bring back the gallows and hang every single one of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want a war, I\u2019ll give you a war\u201d\n\nObservers say the far-right Brexiteer street movement is informal, disorganized and leaderless. But the face of the movement, if it can be said to have one, is James Goddard. A 30-year-old former forklift driver originally from Leicester, he\u2019s gained a degree of notoriety over the past year by aggressively confronting Remainer MPs, flanked by his supporters, and posting the footage online.\n\nIn the most high-profile incident, he and his supporters surrounded prominent Remainer MP Anna Soubry and pursued her outside Parliament, shouting insults such as \u201ctraitor,\u201d \u201cscum,\u201d and \u201cNazi\u201d while she sought protection from police. Goddard, who at the time styled himself a \u201cyellow vest\u201d after anti-government protesters in France, also hurled threats at police officers, telling them, \u201cEvery fucking one of you are fair game \u2014 you want a war, I\u2019ll give you a war.\u201d\n\nJames Goddard was given a two-year suspended sentence and banned from the area surrounding Parliament after he admitted calling MP Anna Soubry a Nazi and a traitor outside the Houses of Parliament in January. (Press Association via AP Images)\n\nGoddard is aware his approach isn\u2019t for everyone. \u201cI know some people find it unpalatable, but I believe my style of protesting delivers a message,\u201d he told VICE News.\n\nPlus, the aggressive style got clicks.\n\n\u201cEvery time we do something like that, it goes viral,\u201d he said.\n\nGoddard\u2019s been kicked off Twitter, Facebook and PayPal, and demonetized on YouTube as a result of his vitriol. But donations from supporters still allow him to work full-time as a pro-Brexit agitator.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s also led to criminal convictions. Earlier this year he was given a two-year suspended sentence and banned from the area surrounding Parliament for harassing Soubry.\n\nSoubry didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment, but the abuse clearly left her rattled. Last month she cancelled a speaking appearance at Remain rally in London due to intimidation by a hooligan-based far-right group. \u201cI\u2019m a parliamentarian and I have a right to speak, and I shouldn\u2019t be frightened but ... I\u2019m very frightened actually,\u201d she said at the time.\n\n\u201cEvery time we do something like that, it goes viral\u201d\n\nDespite the conviction, Goddard says he sees nothing wrong with his tactics, and has no plans to change his ways until Brexit is secured. He was arrested again last month for confronting Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn outside a rally in Salford, and sees the charges against him as a case of \u201cthe establishment\u201d working to silence dissent.\n\n\u201cIf you challenge a politician in this country, then you have the full force of the establishment against you,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe know where your children go to school\u201d\n\nThose on the receiving end of such abuse see things differently. Since the 2016 assassination of Cox just a week before the referendum \u2014 by a white supremacist who cried out \u201cDeath to traitors, freedom for Britain\u201d in court \u2014 political violence is no longer an abstraction in Britain.\n\nFor Miller, the businesswoman turned high-profile Remain campaigner, the relentless stream of threats from Brexiteers has driven her to hire personal security, go out in public less, and constantly worry for her family\u2019s safety.\n\nAnti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller speaks outside the Supreme Court in London, Tuesday, Sept. 24, 2019 after it made it's decision on the legality of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's five-week suspension of Parliament. (AP Photo/Matt Dunham)\n\n\u201cIt restricts our freedom a lot,\u201d Miller told VICE News. \u201dIt\u2019s like being on high alert all the time. I\u2019m always thinking about what could go wrong, who knows where we are.\u201d\n\nThe 54-year-old became, in the words of many of her abusers, \u201cthe most hated woman in Britain\u201d when she successfully launched a legal case against the government in 2016, forcing it to gain approval from Parliament before it could begin the formal process of leaving the EU. She followed that up with a second legal victory against the government last month, when she and others successfully challenged Johnson\u2019s move to suspend Parliament for a critical period ahead of the scheduled Oct. 31 EU departure date.\n\n\u201dIt\u2019s like being on high alert all the time. I\u2019m always thinking about what could go wrong, who knows where we are\u201d\n\nAs a wealthy woman of color who has successfully challenged the government\u2019s Brexit plans, Miller says she\u2019s the perfect hate figure for the far right. She can handle the abuse, she says, but the incessant threats \u2014 online, over the phone, in person \u2014 have taken a huge toll.\n\nShe\u2019s had toxic chemicals sent to her office, and she once received a letter saying, \u201cWe know where your children go to school; they\u2019ll be taken today.\u201d\n\nThe hate streaming toward politicians was the topic of an emotional debate in Parliament last month, when MPs spoke out about the deluge of threats they are facing amid the tensions over Brexit. Criminal abuse and harassment of MPs has hit an unprecedented level, according to Metropolitan police chief Cressida Dick.\n\nBritain's Conservative Party lawmaker Boris Johnson gestures as he speaks during the official launch of his leadership campaign, in London, Wednesday June 12, 2019.

Seven other MPs said they\u2019d received similar threats. \u201cPeople are really frightened.\u201d\n\nSheriff and others put some of the blame on Johnson and his coterie of hardline Brexiteers, who they accuse of fueling the far-right\u2019s aggression.\n\nJohnson\u2019s critics \u2014 including MP Amber Rudd, who only weeks ago was a Cabinet minister \u2014 say the prime minister\u2019s incendiary rhetoric, such as vowing he\u2019d rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d than fail to deliver Brexit, is inciting violence. Labour MP Jess Phillips revealed that Johnson\u2019s exact words were used in an anonymous threat against her, warning that opponents of Brexit would find themselves \u201cdead in a ditch.\u201d\n\n\n\nPeter Tatchell, a veteran progressive campaigner who faced intimidation from a hooligan-based group of pro-Brexit counter-demonstrators at a Remain event last month, told VICE News it was \u201coutrageous\u201d that the prime minister was mirroring the far right\u2019s agenda and rhetoric.\n\n\u201cJohnson must surely be aware that he\u2019s playing into the hands of the far right, fueling their sense of grievance and betrayal mentality and giving them de facto encouragement,\u201d he told VICE News.\n\nMiller agreed. \u201cHe didn\u2019t start it. It\u2019s been brewing. But what he\u2019s done is light a match to it.\u201d\n\n\u201cJohnson must surely be aware that he\u2019s playing into the hands of the far right\u201d\n\nWhen challenged on his approach in Parliament, Johnson dismissed the criticism as \u201chumbug,\u201d then sparked further outrage by saying the best way to honor the memory of Cox, a pro-Remain MP, was to \u201cget Brexit done.\u201d He later backtracked slightly, claiming there had been a \"misunderstanding\" over his remarks for which he apologized, but said he wouldn\u2019t stop using military metaphors like surrender, which were \u201cold, standard, parliamentary terms.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s response left many, including Miller, even more deeply despairing over where things are heading next, as a divided Britain lurches toward a Brexit deadline at the end of the month with virtually nothing certain but further rancor.\n\n\u201cThree years ago, it was a febrile environment, but I thought people would come to their senses,\u201d said Miller. \u201cYet what has happened that over that period is that the tide has turned back on decency and tolerance in our society more than I ever thought possible.\u201d\n\nShe continued. \u201cYou scorch the earth, and what is left after? Whatever happens when Brexit is over, we\u2019re going to have to live as one society.\u201d\n\nCover: Pro-Brexit demonstrators protest outside The Supreme Court in London, Tuesday, Sept. 17, 2019.
