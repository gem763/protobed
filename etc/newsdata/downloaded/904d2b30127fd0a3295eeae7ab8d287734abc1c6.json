We will keep watching it,'' he said.\n\n\"If we get comfort over time that they can re-establish their strength in that sector we would look at it again.\"\n\nAFIC also exited Perpetual, Incitec Pivot, Clydesdale Bank and shopping mall owner Unibail-Rodamco in the past year.", "description": "One of Australia's oldest and biggest investment houses has called time on its investment in the nation's oldest wealth manager.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.0383%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_124/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/b0fcbaa6f4c3aa9190dcb665e8f1a9ff501cb0d2", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
