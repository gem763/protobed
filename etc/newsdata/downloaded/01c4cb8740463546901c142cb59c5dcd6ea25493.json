He is going to have a chance to play a lot of matches.\n\n\u2018Kieran Tierney is closer to us, he played on Thursday and today he was on the bench if we needed him. Hector Bellerin needs a little more time, more matches and more training.\n\n\u2018This international break is going to be important for him. I think he will be closer to starting for us in the next matches in the Premier League.\u2019\n\nArsenal fans have been desperate to see more of Holding, Tierney and Bellerin in the first-team, particularly after their impressive outings in the Carabao Cup and Europa League.\n\nDavid Luiz was Arsenal\u2019s match-winner against Bournemouth (Picture: Getty)\n\nAs well as helping Arsenal keep two clean sheets in their appearances, both Tierney and Bellerin have provided assists while Holding scored in the win against Nottingham Forest.\n\nAlthough Arsenal were not at their best during their victory over Bournemouth, Emery will have been delighted to see his side keep only a second league clean sheet this season.", "description": "Unai Emery believes that Rob Holding, Kieran Tierney and Hector Bellerin are all close to featuring in the Premier League after Arsenal's 1-0 victory over Bournemouth at the Emirates.
