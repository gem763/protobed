Although Sunday\u2019s result has brought into focus the likely match-ups for the tournament\u2019s quarter-finals, Wales are refusing to get ahead of themselves. Their focus is on Fiji next Wednesday, followed by a final Pool D clash with Uruguay. It\u2019s business as usual for the Welsh.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

It\u2019s hard not to think that they could indeed go all the way. For although Sunday\u2019s encounter may only have been a group match, ingrained in the Welsh performance was one key dynamic which will sustain them in the coming weeks, regardless of who they face: unshakeable, unbreakable, unwavering self-belief.\n\nFor all the magic and menace of that opening half, in which an energised Welsh team stormed out of the blocks to swiftly pull ahead of their rivals, it was the second 40 which reaffirmed the World Cup credentials of Gatland\u2019s men.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

This was no longer about taking the fight to Australia \u2013 they had done that in the opening 20 minutes \u2013 but showcasing their ability to withstand the relentless, rolling waves of yellow shirts repeatedly rising up from the Tokyo turf.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re aware that it\u2019s a bit like a tide,\u201d Patchell said. \u201cSometimes there\u2019s no point trying to force against it but you\u2019ve got to withstand it, you\u2019ve got to roll with it and know that you\u2019ll get your chance and go with it.\u201d\n\nIn the past, this has been a fixture defined by tortuously narrow margins, with the Welsh often wilting in the face of their opponents\u2019 fightbacks. Between 2008 and 2018, they suffered 13 successive defeats against the Wallabies, with only two of those losses by more than nine points. But after last autumn\u2019s dogged 9-6 victory, and now this famous World Cup win, it seems Wales have finally unearthed the invaluable quality of \u2018hanging in\u2019 against the game\u2019s heavyweights.\n\nFormer captain Sam Warburton spoke at length before this tournament of the psychological maturity present in the Welsh, courtesy of Gatland\u2019s influence. \u201cHe has changed the perception of the Welsh public from being underdogs, which they were used to in the 1990s and 2000s,\u201d Warburton said of his old boss. \u201cHe has changed the psychology of the Welsh team. You work hard to be the top dog, and he has got the boys in that state of mind.\u201d\n\nOn account of Sunday\u2019s performance, Warburton\u2019s words now carry even more weight. We saw that \u201cstate of mind\u201d at the breakdown, with the impervious pairing of Aaron Wainwright and Justin Tipuric repeatedly getting the better of their opposite numbers. We saw it in the backline, Jonathan Davies and Hadleigh Parkes holding firm against Australia\u2019s midfield battering rams. We saw it in 183 tackles made by the Welsh, almost double the Wallabies\u2019 count.\n\nWithout wanting to get too carried away, we cannot look past the realities of Saturday\u2019s performance. As was the case with Georgia, Wales struggled to maintain their initial intensity and allowed their opponents back into the game. Three tries were conceded. Australia dominated possession, territory, ball carries, metres made and more. Given their quality, this response was always to be expected. But had it been, say, New Zealand heading into the break 18 points clear, you feel the second half might not have made for such an absorbing, thrilling affair. Wales have shown their ability to dispel the best \u2013 but do they have what it takes to dominate?\n\nStill, as we saw in Tokyo, rugby can be shaped by the smallest of details. A dropped ball. A late turnover. A penalty kick that fails to find touch. These moments can swing the pendulum in either direction, gifting one side ecstasy and the other agony. But without belief there can be no reward. And with an abundance of this at their disposal, Wales will know that anything is possible as they plot their assault on World Cup glory one thumping step at a time.", "description": "For a man who had just delivered\u00a0the most influential performance\u00a0of his international career, Rhys Patchell kept a typically cool head as he reflected upon Wales\u2019\u00a0pulsating\u00a0win over Australia. \u201cA job well done tonight in terms of getting the result but it doesn\u2019t count for anything if we don\u2019t back it up in nine days\u2019 time,\u201d he said.", "authors": ["Samuel Lovett"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/30/05/wales.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
