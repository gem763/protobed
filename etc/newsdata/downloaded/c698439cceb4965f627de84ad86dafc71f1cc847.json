The Italian breaks through for his first win this season, scoring aboard the David Ferarris-trained Blazing Partners. #HKracing pic.twitter.com/rnwlu8CYcg \u2014 HKJC Racing (@HKJC_Racing) October 20, 2019\n\n\u201cI have Italian heritage and Umby is Italian so it\u2019s very nice to have The Italian Job get it done today.\u201d\n\nIt was Ferraris\u2019 first winner since July 3 and he gave an insight into the impact a run of outs can have in the unescapable heat of the Hong Kong racing furnace.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s huge pressure,\u201d he said. \u201cI was giving Umby pressure for a ride on Wednesday which probably wasn\u2019t warranted but that\u2019s what this place does to you when you\u2019re the only trainer that hasn\u2019t had a winner.\n\n\u201cJockeys ride horses and you don\u2019t think they rode them well but they\u2019re trying their best. Umby\u2019s trying his level best, we\u2019re all trying our best.\u201d\n\nRispoli says fronting up at the races will be a much more pleasant experience now that he\u2019s put paid to the nought next to his name.\n\n\u201cI was starting to be a little bit upset with the zero on the programme. Every meeting you see it in the back of the book,\u201d Rispoli said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I deserve that. I\u2019ve been here a long time and have proven I can compete.\n\n\u201cWhen the season starts pretty bad, the winner can be in Class Five and it doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s a winner.\u201d\n\nBlazing Partners\u2019 win came from barrier 11 and Ferraris\u2019 five runners on Sunday drew gates 9,11,11,13 and 13, but the South African was able to have a chuckle about his misfortune.\n\n\u201cWhen you think things can\u2019t get worse, they do,\u201d he smiled.\n\nBlazing Partners travelled quietly at the back of the field early on before Rispoli started to make some ground along the rail from the 800m, eventually finding clear air 300m out and sizzling home.\n\n\u201cHe won\u2019t stop here, he\u2019ll win in Class Four I\u2019m sure. He\u2019s just got to be ridden quietly and he\u2019s fine,\u201d said Ferraris, adding that he\u2019s confident he won\u2019t have to wait as long for his next success.\n\n\u201cThe horses are well, they\u2019re in great form and they\u2019re healthy, they just need a bit of luck.\u201d", "description": "On an afternoon that featured a pair of Group Two races and some of Hong Kong\u2019s best horses, it may have been a garden-variety Class Five that provided the most satisfaction....", "authors": ["Sam Agars", "Tom Biddington"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/20/1fa4e642-f325-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e39_image_hires_185521.JPG?itok=lRYb5Nzo&v=1571568928", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
