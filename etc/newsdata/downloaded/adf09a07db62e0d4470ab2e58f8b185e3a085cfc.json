As captured by The Hollywood Reporter\u2019s \ufeffKirsten Chubah, the streaming service went hog wild for its first Chinese Theater premiere. The sidewalk outside the famed cinema \u2014 normally home to Jack Sparrows and Supermen of every shape and size \u2014 was decorated with a news stand, a fake Italian restaurant, and even a Robert De Niro (indicating that this particular New York street is in TriBeCa). The Irishman director Martin Scorcese recently decried Marvel movies as more like theme parks than cinema. Huge shade to the theme park community, and also somewhat hypocritical since the fruit stand outside his film premiere is almost identical to the one on New York Street at Universal Studios Hollywood.\n\nNetflix is going big for its first premiere at the iconic TCL Chinese Theatre, transforming Hollywood Blvd for #TheIrishman @THR pic.twitter.com/mGw5mt1V8M \u2014 Kirsten Chuba (@KirstenChuba) October 25, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s this kind of lavish spending Scorsese was looking for by hooking up with Netflix. \u201cWe needed to make an expensive picture,\u201d Scorsese told Variety. \u201cThe movie business is changing hour by hour \u2014 not necessarily for the better \u2014 and many of the places we would have gone to for funding in the past were no longer viable.\u201d Auteurs need Netflix money if they\u2019re going to compete with the tentpoles of the world, and what better way to fight franchises set in a fake New York than with a fake New York of your very own?", "description": "Martin Scorsese decried Marvel movies as being like theme parks, yet his premiere for The Irishman at TCL Chinese Theater looked just like New York Street at Universal Studios Hollywood.
