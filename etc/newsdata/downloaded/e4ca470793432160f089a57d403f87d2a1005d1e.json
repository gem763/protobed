Warren\n\nAnti-gun activists, including Shannon Watts of Moms Demand Action, are targeting the Jersey Mike\u2019s chain of sandwich shops after the brand\u2019s Twitter account failed to treat tweets calling for the group to ban firearms from their stores with the deference gun control advocates believe they deserve.\n\nThe whole thing started over the weekend, when a Twitter user posted a picture of a pretty awful display of open carrying at his local Jersey Mike\u2019s.\n\nDude. It\u2019s @jerseymikes, not Fallujah. You think you need a 1911 and an M&P to get a sub, but the thing that\u2019s gonna kill you is cholesterol. Also, zero retention on that M&P. If I could walk up behind you in line and take your gun, you shouldn\u2019t have it. pic.twitter.com/lnv2Hiv1ou \u2014 Cav the Impaler (@CombatCavScout) October 26, 2019\n\nSomewhere along the line the Twitter responses went from \u201cDude, what are you doing?\u201d to \u201cwHy WoN\u2019t JeRsEy MiKe\u2019S bAn GuNs??!\u201d As Business Insider notes, the Jersey Mike\u2019s Twitter account responded to several comments demanding a gun ban in stores with the statement, \u201cIf the laws were up to us, we\u2019d make it so everyone had to eat Jersey Mike\u2019s Subs on Sundays.\u201d I suppose they could have tweeted out some bit of benign corporate speech like \u201cWe appreciate your concerns and endeavor to treat our customer\u2019s safety with the utmost importance. Your opinions are important to us as we are constantly evaluating how best to serve the most important part of the Jersey Mike\u2019s family; you the customer.\u201d\n\nInstead, they went with the lighthearted response, and as you can imagine, gun control activists were not pleased by the audacity of responding to calls to ban guns with a semi-snarky comment. Shannon Watts was among those who seized on the joking tweet to demand action.\n\nThis is @jerseymikes response to this photo of a negligent gun owner inside their store. Jersey Mikes has every right to regulate whether or how guns are brought into their stores. Shop at their competitors. #subsnotguns https://t.co/4VxN7paTZM pic.twitter.com/4zL9UVTDp4 \u2014 Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) October 28, 2019\n\nApparently the pressure got to them, because Monday evening Jersey Mike\u2019s took down its earlier tweets and said simply \u201cThank you. We apologize. We want to always do better.\u201d As you can imagine, that wasn\u2019t enough for gun control activists, who began stating that the sandwich chain had been \u201cmaking light of gun deaths.\u201d\n\nThis was a standard reponse from @jerseymikes based on their previous reponses, and is completely unmeaningful. They obviously do not value their customer\u2019s concerns, safety, or experience. Until they make an effort to actually \u201cdo better\u201d I will continue to #BoycottJerseyMikes \u2014 Travis Akers (@travisakers) October 29, 2019\n\nKeep in mind, this was originally about a dude open carrying a pistol that looked like it was about to fall out of his pants. Now, after gun control activists have grabbed ahold of the narrative, it\u2019s suddenly about Jersey Mike\u2019s supposedly not caring about gun deaths. Of course, if the chain decided to ask customers not to carry in their stories, the company would suddenly a be caring and concerned corporate partner, even if the request didn\u2019t amount to a legal prohibition and changed absolutely nothing.\n\nJersey Mike\u2019s seems to be laying low at the moment, and this will likely blow over. Gun control advocates will soon find another company to try to pressure in hopes of a public relations victory, and Jersey Mike\u2019s may issue some sort of statement, but I doubt they\u2019ll be formally posting signs to turn their locations into gun-free zones.\n\nAs for the guy who was open carrying in the first place; while I\u2019m not a certified firearms instructor, I\u2019d suggest keeping your gun on the hip, strapping it to your thigh, wearing a shoulder rig, or basically doing anything besides tucking your holster in the waistband of your sagging jeans. As a fellow Fluffy-American, there are just some methods of carrying that don\u2019t work as well for us. If you\u2019re legally carrying a gun, you should be doing so responsibly, and that looks ready to fall out of your jeans as soon as you take a seat or bend over to tie your shoes. If you want to be a good advocate for the Second Amendment, try not to give the gun control activists rhetorical ammunition for their anti-carry crusades.", "description": "Gun control activists are urging a boycott of Jersey Mike's sub shops over the chain's response to a man openly carrying a firearm in a store.", "authors": ["Cam Edwards", "Author'S Bio", "Cam Edwards Has Covered The Amendment For More Than Years As A Broadcast", "Online Journalist", "As Well As The Co-Author Of", "Heavy Lifting", "Grow Up", "Get A Job", "Start A Family", "Other Manly Advice"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/64/52c0b085-fabb-4e2d-a227-cba535e2e2a9.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
