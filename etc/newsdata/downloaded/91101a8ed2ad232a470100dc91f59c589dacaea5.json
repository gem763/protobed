I mean, I can\u2019t believe that you said two minutes ago that they had to buy in and now you\u2019re saying they don\u2019t have to buy in. You\u2019re forgetting that.\u201d\n\nBiden had, in fact, previously said: \u201cIf you want Medicare, if you lose the job from your insurance \u2015 from your employer, you automatically can buy into this.\u201d\n\nStill, at least two other candidates saw Castro\u2019s comment as a low blow. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar told CNN after the debate it \u201cwas so personal and so unnecessary,\u201d likening it to \u201csomething that Donald Trump might tweet out.\u201d\n\nIt also drew real-time backlash from South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who said onstage that the quibbling \u201cis why presidential debates are becoming unwatchable,\u201d calling it a reminder to \u201ceverybody of what they cannot stand about Washington.\u201d\n\nBut on Friday, Castro showed no signs of backing down.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about the fact that his plan would require you to buy in at certain times, which means that 10 million people would be uncovered,\u201d he said, arguing that he \u201cpointed out this big difference in our approach.\u201d Biden has acknowledged that his plan would cover 97% of the country, leaving the remaining 3% \u2015 about 10 million Americans \u2015 uninsured.\n\nAs a PolitiFact review of the exchange points out, both plans would ensure Americans access to Medicare if they need it. The main difference is that \u201cCastro\u2019s plan is an opt-out plan while Biden\u2019s is an opt-in plan.\u201d\n\nThat distinguishing factor \u201cwould likely amount to the nature or timing of paperwork, rather than being significant barriers to access,\u201d PolitiFact notes, contending that the basis for Castro\u2019s attack on Biden\u2019s plan was ill-founded.", "description": "The former housing secretary questioned whether Biden was able to recall the facts of his health care plan during the third Democratic debate.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7bda9f230000580552ecbe.jpeg?cache=hnd9kyywuf&ops=1778_1000"}
