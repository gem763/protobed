The pre-rolls were included to increase ad revenue, the person added.\n\nA Disney representative denied that financial concerns motivated the additional advertisements, insisting to The Verge that it was strictly a business decision. Pre-roll ads started rolling out before short-form video clips at the beginning of October, the representative said. Advertising for live events was on the app from launch.\n\nRecent reviews left on Apple\u2019s App Store and Google\u2019s Play Store are full of negative comments\n\n\u201cESPN+ has always had advertising, including in live sports streams,\u201d the Disney representative said in a statement. \u201cWe recently adapted the advertising experience and ESPN+ subscribers now also see targeted pre-roll ads in video clips across the ESPN digital environment.\u201d\n\nRecent reviews left on Apple\u2019s App Store and Google\u2019s Play Store are full of negative comments specifically calling out the pre-roll ad situation. One user complained that they shouldn\u2019t have to sit through a pre-roll ad any time a video is selected since they\u2019re already paying a subscription fee.\n\n\u201cI pay for ESPN+ and there should be an option to skip [an] ad after 10 seconds,\u201d the review, left on Apple\u2019s App Store, reads. \u201cThis feature alone makes the app just about unbearable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe recently adapted the advertising experience and ESPN+ subscribers now also see targeted pre-roll ads in video clips.\u201d\n\nDisney originally envisioned a service with much less obtrusive ads. Limited advertising seemed to be the original strategy for ESPN+, with Variety noting in 2018 that \u201cthe programmer is focusing on securing integrated brand sponsorships.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until months after launch that ESPN started talking about exploring additional advertising options. ESPN president Jimmy Pitaro announced in August 2018 that the network was interested in exploring new advertising capabilities.\n\n\u201cWe are very interested in an ad-lite type of experience within ESPN+ where you have various forms of sponsorship integration,\u201d Pitaro said, as reported by Axios\u2019 Sara Fischer. \u201cFair to say you can expect to see that going forward.\u201d\n\nPitaro stressed that he didn\u2019t want intrusive advertising within the app, but that\u2019s exactly what people are experiencing. There are complaints from people who were promised upon signing up that intrusive advertising like pre-roll videos wouldn\u2019t be a problem if they paid the $4.99-a-month subscriber fee for premium service.\n\nDisney\u2019s representative didn\u2019t say whether additional in-app advertising would be rolling out to subscribers. ESPN+ is also part of Disney\u2019s upcoming three-streaming service bundle, which includes new streaming platform Disney+, ad-supported Hulu, and ESPN+.", "description": "ESPN+ subscribers have noticed a number of pre-roll ads running before videos in recent weeks, despite the fact that a major selling point of the app is that customers wouldn\u2019t have to deal with constant annoying commercials.", "authors": ["Julia Alexander", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ab4i0N7aWfLlR0p6YN52IzxKxsE=/0x76:1400x809/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19318148/espn_.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
