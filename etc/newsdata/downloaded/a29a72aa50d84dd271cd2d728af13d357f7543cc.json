Liu is scheduled to meet Trump at the White House at 2:45 p.m. EDT (1845 GMT), according to the White House public schedule.\n\n\u201cGood things are happening at China Trade Talk Meeting. Warmer feelings than in recent past, more like the Old Days. I will be meeting with the Vice Premier today. All would like to see something significant happen!\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter.\n\nMnuchin, arriving for the negotiations in Washington, told reporters the talks were \u201cgoing well.\u201d\n\nA Chinese state newspaper said on Friday that a \u201cpartial\u201d trade deal would benefit China and the United States, and that Washington should take the offer, reflecting Beijing\u2019s aim of cooling the row before more tariffs kick in.\n\nBoth sides have slapped duties on hundreds of billions of dollars of goods during the dispute, and Trump is threatening to raise tariffs to 30 per cent from 25 per cent on about US$250 billion in Chinese goods on Oct. 15 if there is no progress on a deal.\n\nOn Thursday, Liu said China is willing to reach agreement with the United States on matters that both sides care about so as to prevent friction from leading to further escalation of the trade war. He stressed that \u201cthe Chinese side came with great sincerity.\u201d\n\nAdding to that, the official China Daily newspaper said in an editorial in English on Friday: \u201cA partial deal is a more feasible objective.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot only would it be of tangible benefit by breaking the impasse, but it would also create badly needed breathing space for both sides to reflect on the bigger picture,\u201d the paper said.\n\nTrump, who said on Thursday that talks with the Chinese had not gone well, has previously insisted he would not be satisfied with a partial deal to resolve his two-year effort to change China\u2019s trade, intellectual property and industrial policy practices, which he argues cost millions of U.S. jobs.\n\nInvestors and business groups, however, saw China\u2019s dangling of a partial deal as a sign of progress.\n\nMajor U.S. stock indexes were trading sharply higher on Friday, with the S&P 500 index up about 1.5 per cent.\n\nCHINA\u2019S ACTIONS\n\nChina\u2019s securities regulator on Friday also unveiled a firm timetable for scrapping foreign ownership limits in futures, securities and mutual fund companies for the first time. Increasing foreign access to the sector is among the U.S. demands at the trade talks.\n\nBeijing previously said it would further open up its financial sector on its own terms and at its own pace.\n\nChinese officials also are offering to increase annual purchases of U.S. agricultural products, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday, citing unidentified sources.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) on Thursday confirmed net sales of 142,172 tonnes of U.S. pork to China in the week ended Oct. 3, the largest weekly sale to the world\u2019s top pork market on record.\n\nA U.S.-China currency agreement is also being floated as a symbol of progress in talks between the world\u2019s two largest economies, although that would largely repeat past pledges by China, currency experts say, and will not change the dollar-yuan relationship that has been a thorn in Trump\u2019s side.\n\nPESSIMISM \u2018STILL JUSTIFIED\u2019\n\nAnalysts have noted China sent a larger-than-normal delegation of senior Chinese officials to Washington, with its commerce minister, Zhong Shan, and deputy ministers for agriculture and technology also present.\n\nThe sudden optimism about a potential de-escalation is in stark contrast to much more gloomy predictions in business circles just days ago on the heels of a series of threatened crackdowns on China by the Trump administration.\n\nOn Tuesday, the U.S. government widened its trade blacklist to include Chinese public security bureaus and some of China\u2019s top artificial intelligence startups, punishing Beijing for its treatment of Muslim minorities.\n\nSurprised by the move, Chinese government officials told Reuters on the eve of talks that they had lowered expectations for significant progress.\n\nFriday\u2019s China Daily editorial also warned that \u201cpessimism is still justified,\u201d noting that the talks would finish just three days before Washington is due to implement higher tariffs.\n\nThe negotiations were the \u201conly window\u201d to end deteriorating relations, it added.\n\nThere have also been reports that the Trump administration is readying additional measures aimed at China, with unknown consequences for trade negotiations.\n\nSuch wildly shifting expectations have been a persistent feature of the trade war, and observers remained cautious over what might emerge from this week\u2019s talks.\n\n\u201cChina wants peace, but I don\u2019t think China will give more,\u201d one Chinese trade expert said on condition of anonymity.\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2019", "description": "A Chinese state newspaper said on Friday that a 'partial' trade deal would benefit China and the United States, and that Washington should take the offer", "authors": ["Echo Wang", "Yawen Chen"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/china.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
