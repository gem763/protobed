Still, the celebration has taken on a life of its own around the world, especially if we\u2019re talking about one of its main attractions: beer. Then again, we don\u2019t need an excuse to extol the virtues of this ever-popular quaff during this month or any other.\n\n[Think beyond pie with these 6 spectacular apple dessert recipes]\n\nAs delightful as it is to drink, beer also makes a wonderful addition to savory and sweet cooking. So grab an extra bottle or can and check out one of these recipe from our archives:\n\nSpicy Beer Mustard, above. This mustard is powerful, and if you\u2019re anything like us, you\u2019ll feel the heat go straight to the top of your head. And yet you\u2019ll want more. We loved it served with soft pretzels. You will only use part of a bottle of stout, but you can sip on the rest while you munch.\n\n\n\n(Deb Lindsey for The Washington Post)\n\nThe Red-Eye.

If you prefer to pretend it\u2019s still warm, the Oranj-a-Bloom, at right, is lighter, with white beer, citrus and refreshing mint.\n\n\n\n(Goran Kosanovic for The Washington Post)\n\nBeer-Roasted Mushrooms. Serve these on their own for a vegetarian main; they\u2019d be nice also on top of a salad or in a sandwich with gooey cheese.\n\n\n\n(Goran Kosanovic for The Washington Post)\n\nDorie Greenspan\u2019s Belgian Beef and Beer Stew. This is the kind of dish you probably think of when we talk about cooking with beer. As with many stews, you can make it several days in advance.\n\n\n\n(Goran Kosanovic for The Washington Post)\n\nSoft Beer Flatbreads. Here\u2019s a great entry point for beginning bread bakers. Brown ale further enhances the yeasty flavor.\n\n[These easy flatbreads can be made in no time \u2014 and with no oven]\n\n\n\n(Deb Lindsey for The Washington Post)\n\nSlow-Rise, No-Knead Rustic Caraway-Beer Bread.
