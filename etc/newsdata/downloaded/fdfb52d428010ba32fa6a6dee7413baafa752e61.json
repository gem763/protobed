She has the bearing of a schoolteacher, but the suggestion of fastidiousness draws attention to the one real oddity: her overcoat is two or three sizes too big. She is emblematic of the times and of the women I interviewed for Homecoming: Voices of the Windrush Generation. The book will be published into an environment that is still full of toxic narratives around immigration, and at a time when the Home Office has failed to learn lessons from what has become known as the -Windrush scandal.\n\nSetting out from the Caribbean in the 1950s and 60s, many could not conceive of snow, and winter coats were almost impossible to acquire. Such women remind me of my mother, Ethlyn, and all of her Caribbean peers memorialised in the book. These giants of my childhood were extraordinary dreamers and romancers who had dared to travel 4,000 miles to a place they had only imagined from arcane ceremonies carried out by governors and other colonial officials, from Path\u00e9 newsreels and from the West Indian Reader textbooks sent from England. Some, such as George Mangar, were better prepared. Mangar\u2019s mother packed 100 shirts into a travelling trunk when he left British Guiana (now Guyana). In his first winter in frosty Britain, he wore three at a time. Others were more cavalier. \u201cSummerwear\u201d got his nickname following his determination on leaving Jamaica to wear light summer suits in England no matter the weather, come hail or storm. \u201cWhatever became of Summerwear?\u201d I asked Ethlyn when researching the book. \u201cWell,\u201d she said, \u201cwithin a few months he caught a chill and died.\u201d\n\nGrowing up in 1970s Luton, I was always impressed by what I considered a West Indian code \u2013 the phlegmatic shrug and the great store of humour that eased their passage through life. Struggling to find work in a prejudicial environment, one man was often informed that it was \u201ca terrible shame but you\u2019ve just turned up a little too late\u201d. His wry assessment of the news was typically West Indian: \u201cBoy, the Englishman is the nicest man out when he\u2019s telling you \u2018no\u2019.\u201d\n\nChased into 'self-deportation': the most disturbing Windrush case so far Read more\n\nFaced with rejection, West Indians mostly pulled up the collar of their coats and walked on \u2013 at least that was their initial remembrance as I sat down with them. The palpable veil of respectability, which descended almost as soon as I began to record them, was testament to the peculiar reserve and reticence among West Indians of my parents\u2019 generation to share information. \u201cMe don\u2019t like chat people\u2019s business\u201d is a phrase you\u2019ll often hear in West Indian households. But perhaps because of my Jamaican background, when interviewing these octogenarians that guardedness dissolved as they immersed themselves in reminiscences. They soon reverted to the kind of salty, mischievous and thrilling behaviour that took me back to the 60s and 70s.\n\nThe poet Derek Walcott once asserted: \u201cAll Port of Spain is a noon-day show.\u201d As a child that same vibrancy was evident at almost any gathering I attended of Caribbean people. They were a contrast to the British, who seemed to have worked out that the whole point to life was to proceed, with as little fuss as possible, towards death. Yet in the 70s, our Caribbeanness rarely found expression outside of the four walls that bound us.\n\nEven so, I\u2019ve long felt the Caribbean influence in Britain. Recently my ears pricked up when listening to PJ Harvey\u2019s Let England Shake. One of that album\u2019s most stunning tracks derives its power from the reggae chorus of Niney the Observer\u2019s Blood and Fire: \u201cthere is no more water to put out the fire, let it burn, let it burn\u201d. It might very well be an anthem for our times, heralding the embrace of chaos which borders on nihilism.\n\nGoing to Britain? could not have prepared the West Indian pioneers for this moment, nor for the fact that, 60 years after their arrival, some of them would be scandalously deported. Joyce Trotman, now aged 91, gives an overview of how British West Indians have been cast since her arrival in 1954. \u201cFirst we were children of empire, then citizens of the Commonwealth, and now foreigners and immigrants.\u201d Those who found themselves ejected from the bosom of the motherland were further insulted by the cultural advice offered by British officials about what to expect on arrival back in Jamaica. Lesson one was how to \u201csound Jamaican\u201d and not to attract attention to their Britishness. The sense of shame of these insulted black Britons is compounded by the notion that you left the Caribbean poor, with a desire to travel to Britain to better yourself; you were not expected to return empty and broken.\n\n\u201cRespect\u201d is the most important word in the Jamaican lexicon. To ensure that a mess like the Windrush scandal never happens again, the government should empty the coffers of the Treasury and give the forced returnees whatever sum might assuage their pain. The financial consequences must be such that officials would think twice in the future. And while we\u2019re at it, let\u2019s strip those enforcers of the hostile environment policy of any honours they may subsequently have received.\n\nPerhaps no level of apology can compensate for the humiliation inflicted. But 60 years on from Going to Britain? we will have reached a dangerous point if there\u2019s an absence of water to put out the fire of resentment that burns in the bosom of all of us, ashamed at the reckless and callous treatment of the most vulnerable members of the Windrush generation.\n\n\u2022 Colin Grant is the author of Homecoming: Voices of the Windrush Generation", "description": "No apology can compensate for their humiliation \u2013 but compensation would help, says author Colin Grant", "authors": ["Colin Grant"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d569df7c28a1c6e9e91b30d1a092b9da2d3cea09/76_119_5454_3274/master/5454.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=45d3be0b6a7717f2730d4e9c9f3c6931", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
