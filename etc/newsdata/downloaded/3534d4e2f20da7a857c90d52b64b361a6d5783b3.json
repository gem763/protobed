REUTERS/Jeenah Moon\n\nA jury in federal court in Washington acquitted Craig of misleading the U.S. Department of Justice about a legal review he conducted after leaving the White House that largely vindicated the prosecution of a political enemy of the Russian-aligned president of Ukraine at the time.\n\nCraig, 74, had faced up to five years in prison if convicted.\n\n\u201cI want to thank the jury for doing justice. I\u2019m very fortunate to have the support of a loving family and many loyal friends who were steadfast during this ordeal,\u201d Craig said in a statement.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia, which prosecuted the case, declined to comment.\n\nThe verdict is a blow to the Justice Department\u2019s efforts to force lawyers, lobbyists and other advisers to comply with a 1938 law that requires them to disclose their activities on behalf of foreign governments.\n\nThe department brought only seven criminal cases between 1966 and 2015 involving violations of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), but has ramped up enforcement since them.\n\nAmong those ensnared: President Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, who is currently serving a 7 1/2-year prison sentence for lobbying violations and financial crimes stemming from his work for Viktor Yanukovich, the former president of Ukraine.\n\nManafort recruited Craig\u2019s then-law firm, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, to review the Ukrainian government\u2019s prosecution of Yulia Tymoshenko, a former Ukraine prime minister who was convicted in 2011 on corruption charges and sentenced to seven years in prison.\n\nThe report said Tymoshenko had been improperly imprisoned during the trial but concluded that her due-process rights had not been violated. It was used by Yanukovich\u2019s government to justify her pretrial detention to the European Court of Human Rights and influence U.S. lawmakers.\n\nThe Justice Department accused Craig of misleading officials in order to avoid registering with the department as a foreign agent under FARA. Craig said he and other lawyers who worked on the report had concluded that they did not need to register.\n\nSkadden, Arps agreed in January to turn over the $4.6 million it was paid and retroactively register as a foreign agent as part of a settlement with the Justice Department.\n\nAnother Skadden lawyer, Alex van der Zwaan, pleaded guilty last year to lying to investigators about the report. Craig and van der Zwaan both no longer work for the firm.\n\nDuring his tenure as Obama\u2019s White House counsel from January 2009 to January 2010, Craig led the administration\u2019s unsuccessful effort to shut down the U.S. military prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n\nHe also represented former President Bill Clinton during his 1998 Senate impeachment trial.\n\nCraig\u2019s case stems from Mueller\u2019s 22-month investigation into whether Trump\u2019s presidential campaign worked with Russia to influence the 2016 election.\n\nThat probe led to charges against 34 people, including Russian agents and former key Trump allies, but it concluded that there was not enough evidence to charge Trump or others with criminally conspiring with Russia.\n\nMueller\u2019s report, released in April, did not reach a conclusion as to whether Trump\u2019s efforts to interfere with the probe amounted to criminal obstruction of justice, but it also did not exonerate the president. Attorney General William Barr concluded that there was not enough evidence to charge Trump with obstruction of justice.", "description": "Greg Craig, who had served as former President Barack Obama's top White House lawyer, was found not guilty on Wednesday of lying about work he performed for Ukraine in a case that grew out of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.", "authors": ["Andy Sullivan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190905&t=2&i=1426371661&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8328Y"}
