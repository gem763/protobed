Experiencing any bleeding during pregnancy is something that should be urgently discussed with a medical professional.\n\nHow much bleeding is normal during early pregnancy?\n\nDuring early pregnancy, usually the first 12 weeks \u2013 known as the first trimester \u2013 many women experience some light bleeding which is called spotting.\n\nThis type of bleeding often happens around the time your period would have been due.\n\nAccording to the NHS website, this is when the developing baby plants itself in the wall of the womb.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpotting can be caused by cervical changes. Pregnancy can cause changes to the cervix, and some women may experience light bleeding after sex.\n\nThe blood is usually pinkish or sometimes brown, and you may see it when you wipe after going to the toilet or you may see small amounts of blood in your underwear.\n\nUsually the spotting lasts for a day or so, though for some women it can last longer.\n\nThere should not be enough blood to soak through pads or underwear.\n\nYou should always speak to your midwife if you are worried (Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nMany of us associate cramps with something wrong during pregnancy, too \u2013 but this can be normal, too.\n\nRemember that your body is going through loads of changes \u2013 you have a little human growing inside of you.\n\nDoes bleeding mean miscarriage?\n\nA little blood or spotting, as explained above, doesn\u2019t automatically mean you are having a miscarriage.\n\nExtreme amounts of blood \u2013 enough to soak through the underwear \u2013 can be a sign of miscarriage.\n\nBleeding accompanied with severe cramps that last for longer than a few hours are a cause for concern \u2013 and you should speak to your GP or midwife immediately.\n\nMiscarriage in early pregnancy is common, with it affecting around one in five pregnancies.\n\nWhat causes a miscarriage?\n\nIf a pregnancy ends before the 24th week, it\u2019s called a miscarriage.\n\nMost miscarriages are not because of anything the mother has done, but due to an issue with the development of the baby.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s thought that most miscarriages are caused by abnormal chromosomes in the baby, which are genetic \u2018building blocks\u2019 that guide the development of a baby.\n\nTry not to panic (Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nIf a baby has too many or not enough chromosomes, it will not develop properly.\n\nMiscarriages can also occur as a result of problems with the development of the placenta, long-term health conditions in the mother, infection, issues with womb structure, or a weakened cervix.\n\nExperiencing a miscarriage can be a one-off, and many people who experience one will go on to have healthy pregnancies.\n\nAbout one in 100 women experience recurrent miscarriages (meaning three or more in a row) and many of these women go on to have a successful pregnancy, too.\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence to suggest that miscarriage can be caused by:\n\na mother\u2019s emotional state during pregnancy, such as being stressed or depressed\n\nhaving a shock or fright during pregnancy\n\nexercise during pregnancy\n\nlifting or straining during pregnancy\n\nworking during pregnancy \u2013 or work that involves sitting or standing for long periods\n\nhaving sex during pregnancy\n\ntravelling by air\n\neating spicy food\n\nWhat are the signs of of a miscarriage?\n\nThis can include bleeding \u2013 including blood clots \u2013 from your vagina, discharge of fluid from your vagina, or discharge of tissue from your vagina. It also includes not experiencing the symptoms of pregnancy any longer, such as morning sickness or breast tenderness.\n\nThere is also a chance of an ectopic pregnancy, which is when a fertilised egg implants outside of the womb, usually in the fallopian tube.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis can cause bleeding and is dangerous because the fertilised egg can\u2019t develop properly outside of the womb, the egg has to be removed, which can be done through an operation or with medicines.\n\nWhat colour is your blood during a miscarriage?\n\nBlood during a miscarriage can be pink, red, brown, or near-black. Red blood is fresh and is leaving the body quickly, while blood that looks brown or black has been in the uterus for longer.\n\nBleeding may start as light spotting and become heavier, or it can appear as a sudden gush of blood.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy?\n\nSymptoms of an ectopic pregnancy tend to develop between four and 12 weeks of pregnancy, but can happen later.\n\nSymptoms alongside bleeding can include tummy pain low down on one side, pain in the tip of the shoulder, discomfort when peeing or pooing and vaginal bleeding or a brown, watery discharge.\n\nThese symptoms can be signs of a stomach bug, but they should be checked out regardless.\n\nIt\u2019s so important to remember that bleeding can be normal, and many women experience it, yet go on to have perfectly healthy pregnancy.\n\nSo if you spot it, don\u2019t panic, but do get checked out as soon as you possibly can.\n\nIt\u2019s always best to be safe.\n\nMORE: Woman makes DIY air freshener with a sanitary pad\n\nMORE: Mum who bragged about being a \u2018kept woman\u2019 reveals she was homeless for three months\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Bleeding during pregnancy can be normal and nothing to worry about.
