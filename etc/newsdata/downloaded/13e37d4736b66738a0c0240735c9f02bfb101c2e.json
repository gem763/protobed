I think he ought to be held personally accountable, which is everything from financial fines to \u2014 and let me underline this \u2014 the possibility of a prison term.\u201d\n\nThose are the words of Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who said Facebook Inc.\u2019s chief executive should face serious consequences for misuse of consumers\u2019 personal data.\n\n\u201cHe hurt a lot of people,\u201d Wyden told Portland\u2019s Willamette Weekly newspaper in an interview published last week.\n\nWyden introduced a bill in 2018 that would give the Federal Trade Commission expanded powers to punish companies that violate consumers\u2019 data privacy, including steep fines and potential prison time for executives.\n\n\u201cThere is a precedent for this,\u201d Wyden told Willamette Weekely. \u201cIn financial services, if the CEO and the executives lie about the financials, they can be held personally accountable.\u201d\n\nFacebook is not the only subject of Wyden\u2019s ire. Speaking in July after the government\u2019s $700 million settlement with Equifax Inc. EFX, -0.52% over its 2017 data breach, Wyden said: \u201cEquifax leaders knew its security was pitifully weak and yet did nothing to correct it, according to the FTC. In a just world, these executives would be going to jail.\u201d\n\nDespite Wyden\u2019s wishes, that\u2019s probably not going to actually happen. But Facebook may yet pay a price. Lawmakers have called for the company to be broken up, the FTC has opened an antitrust investigation into the tech giant, and a group of state attorneys general are reportedly pursuing a wider antitrust case against tech companies, likely including Facebook.\n\nDespite all the scandals and investigations, Facebook shares FB, -1.77% have surged 39% year to date, compared to the S&P 500\u2019s SPX, -0.69% 16% gain.", "description": "Oregon\u2019s Ron Wyden says tech CEOs should be personally accountable for consumers\u2019 data", "authors": ["Mike Murphy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HF211_zucker_ZG_20190306213424.jpg"}
