Here is a breakdown of the good news for his Liberal party - and the bad.\n\nGood news - he's still in power\n\nIt was a tough election battle for the Liberals but there was the sense late on Monday night among party faithful in Montreal that they could now breathe a little easier.\n\nWhen TV networks began projecting a Liberal minority, supporters at the election night headquarters erupted into chants of \"four more years\" as a sense of relief passed through the crowd.\n\n\"The Liberals did better than we thought they would,\" said supporter Brian, who chose not to give his last name, saying he had been spooked by polls that suggested a tighter race.\n\nFormer Liberal MP Marlene Jennings says voters \"have shown they still have trust in the Liberal government and in Justin Trudeau, and they definitely didn't want a Conservative government, not even a minority government\".\n\nStill, Ms Jennings conceded she had grown frustrated watching the campaign get sidetracked by \"so-called scandals\" during the last few weeks.\n\n\"There were times during the campaign where I wanted to take the Liberal strategists and shake them and say: 'Why aren't we talking about the great things we've done over and over again?'\"\n\nBad news - his star power is diminished\n\nMr Trudeau had an exceptionally long honeymoon by most political standards - but his popularity has clearly dimmed with the Canadian public.\n\nWhere did he stumble?\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Four years of Justin Trudeau in two minutes\n\nEven before the election campaign began on 11 September, his approval ratings had slipped.\n\nThe first trouble with the Canadian public came after a disastrous overseas trip to India, which took place against a backdrop of photo-ops showcasing the Trudeau family in elaborate traditional Indian outfits.\n\nThen came the SNC-Lavalin affair - an ethics scandal related to attempts to pressure a former attorney general to cut a deal for a firm facing a corruption trial, which further tarnished Mr Trudeau's personal brand.\n\nThat former attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, was booted out of the Liberal party by Mr Trudeau.\n\nAgainst the odds, Ms Wilson-Raybould ran and won as an independent in her Vancouver riding.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Jody Wilson-Raybould\n\nShe is a vocal critic of Mr Trudeau and will serve as a reminder of that scandal in the House of Commons.\n\nFinally, revelations that Mr Trudeau wore blackface - widely seen as a racist caricature - on at least three occasions shook the Liberal campaign and forced Mr Trudeau to ask Canadians to forgive him for his past misbehaviour.\n\nBad news - the Liberals lost the West\n\nThe prairie provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan turned entirely Conservative blue - with the exception of one New Democratic Party (NDP) stronghold in the city of Edmonton.\n\nThat blue wave helped the Conservatives gain almost 30 seats in Monday's election, taking them from 95 to about 122.\n\nThe Liberals were never going to sweep those deeply Conservative regions. Even at the height of their popularity in 2015 they only held a handful of seats in those two provinces.\n\nBut now Alberta and Saskatchewan have turned solidly away from Mr Trudeau's party amid a sense in western Canada that its interests are not represented in Canada's capital of Ottawa.\n\nWith final results still rolling in early Tuesday morning, the Conservatives also had a slight lead in the popular vote - 34.5% to the Liberals' 33%.\n\nThat did not escape the attention of Conservative leader Andrew Scheer who said in his speech to party faithful that \"more Canadians wanted us to win than any other party\".\n\nBad news - the Bloc bounced back\n\nThe Bloc Quebecois has also had a resurgence.\n\nVoters had relegated the party calling for sovereignty for Quebec to the sidelines in the last two elections - but its fortunes turned under the new leadership of Yves-Francois Blanchet, and they more than tripled its seat count, from 10 to an estimated 32.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nMr Blanchet campaigned under the slogan \"Quebec, c'est nous\" or \"We are Quebec\", and on being a strong voice in Ottawa for that province's interests.\n\nThe party, which only runs candidates in Quebec, is at odds with Mr Trudeau on issues like the province's controversial secularism law - Bill 21 - which prevents judges, police officers, teachers and public servants holding some other positions from wearing religious symbols such as the kippah, turban or hijab while at work.\n\nMr Trudeau did offer an olive branch to those Canadians who rejected the Liberals at the ballot box, and said he had heard the frustration from prairie voters loud and clear.\n\n\"To those who did not vote for us, know that we will work every single day for you,\" he said. \"We will govern for everyone.\"\n\nGood news - he can still govern with a minority\n\nMr Trudeau will need the support of other parties to enact his promised \"progressive agenda\" if he wants to hold on to power.\n\nOne likely ally is the NDP, who could help the Liberals to survive key confidence votes and to pass legislation.\n\nBut that support comes at a cost.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption From left: Justin Trudeau, Andrew Scheer and Jagmeet Singh\n\nNDP leader Jagmeet Singh has already set out his party's laundry list of priorities in a minority situation: support for a national pharmacare plan, investments in housing, addressing student debt, lowering cell phone and internet bills, action on climate, and raising taxes on the wealthiest Canadians.\n\nBut Mr Singh's position is less clear on the Trans Mountain pipeline project, which would triple the capacity of crude oil the current pipeline carries to the west coast.\n\nMr Trudeau's Liberals support the project, saying it is in Canada's national interest.\n\nIn his speech to supporters late in the early hours of Tuesday, Mr Singh vowed his party would play a \"positive role\" in Ottawa.\n\nBut support for a minority government also usually has an expiration date.\n\nOn average, minority governments in Canada last about a year and a half to two years, much shorter than the usual four-year majority term.\n\nGood news - voters do want climate action\n\nThe Conservatives had pledged to immediately repeal Mr Trudeau's signature climate policy if they came to power.\n\nBut now it looks like the federal carbon tax - imposed on four provinces that did not already have their own cap-and-trade programme or price on carbon in place - will live another day.\n\nIt should not be too difficult for Mr Trudeau to secure support from across party lines for his climate policies.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What's more important to Canadians \u2014 the economy or the environment?\n\nThe NDP, the Bloc Quebecois and Canada's Greens, which added a seat in Atlantic Canada, all campaigned on taking action on the environment.\n\n\"You've asked us to show even more vision and ambition as we tackle the greatest challenge of this era - climate change,\" Mr Trudeau said in his victory speech.\n\n\"That is exactly what we'll do.\"", "description": "Justin Trudeau is still PM but he lost both his majority and - by a slight margin - the popular vote.", "authors": ["Jessica Murphy", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07rpjgm.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
