It runs completely against the current narrative. But that indeed is what Barclays is doing with more than 100 of its \u201clast in town\u201d and/or remotely situated outlets, at least for the next two years.\n\nDoes this mean banking with hugs is becoming a reality?\n\nWell, not quite. And there is a sting in the tail. This is, after all, banking we\u2019re talking about. There\u2019s always a catch.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBut first let\u2019s look at the good stuff.\n\nAmid an ongoing furore about rural branch closures, Barclays decided to see what it could do to make them more viable at a time when more and more people are abandoning them in favour of the phone and the internet. It settled upon 12 of them to trial ideas, including changing opening hours to make them more customer friendly, reinstalling local managers and sending them out into the community, and using video facilities to add to the range of services they were able to offer.\n\nThe trials worked well enough for the plans to be extended.\n\nThe newly protected branches will still have to prove that they can be financially viable for the business. The bank makes it clear that people in the communities they serve will need to use them.\n\nBut it isn\u2019t just waiting for business to come to it. It\u2019s sending its staff out into the community in an attempt to whip up custom. I\u2019m told the early results are encouraging.\n\nIf you make an effort you can win business. Who knew?\n\nThis is also, not to put too fine a point on it, smart PR. There are real concerns about the way rural communities are served by the industry\u2019s giants at a time when challenger banks, which were supposed to provide the industry with a much-needed competitive jolt, are struggling.\n\nIf politicians and/or regulators start chuntering about competition investigations and such like, Barclays can point to what it\u2019s doing and say, look see, we\u2019re the good guys here.\n\nAt least up to a point. Because this brings us neatly to that sting in the tail I mentioned. Alongside the closure freeze, Barclays is opting out of part of an agreement it and its competitors have with the Post Office, which allows customers to use its outlets to deposit cash and withdraw money with their debit cards.\n\nFrom 2020 onwards, Barclays\u2019 customers won\u2019t be able to do the latter.\n\nThe announcement dovetails with one from Which?, which this morning publishes another report raising concerns about access to cash in rural areas. The consumer group says that even some supposedly \u201cprotected\u201d ATMs have been closing and highlights the long journeys some people now face to get their hands on their money.\n\nBarclays says it\u2019s going to replace the Post Office scheme with one of its own. It will involve local businesses offering a replacement service.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Business news: In pictures Show all 11 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

At some point, probably when Boris Johnson has departed and something resembling a sensible administration has emerged, that may ultimately happen. The provision of banking services and access to cash in remote areas clearly warrants better oversight than it\u2019s currently getting.\n\nBarclays would be wise to rethink this part of its decision.
