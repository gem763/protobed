Stomping off the court, James crowed \u201clet\u2019s goooo\u201d as he unzipped his sweat jacket before taking a seat on the sidelines as everyone else observed the anthem.\n\nLeBron disrespecting the Anthem?!? Oh no pic.twitter.com/3Gev5Dh24x \u2014 Mickstape (@MickstapeShow) October 23, 2019\n\nThe disrespectful outburst comes a week after James called supporters of democracy in Hong Kong \u201cuneducated\u201d for their opposition to China\u2019s tightening grip on the semi-autonomous region.\n\nJames was chastised by many for his support for China, one of the world\u2019s most significant human rights abusers.\n\nFor one, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) took a shot at James for his remarks regarding the league\u2019s ongoing free speech scandal with China.
