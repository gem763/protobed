Australia\u2019s pipeline for new wind and solar PV systems is 6-7 gigawatts annually over the period 2019-21. Rooftop PV is increasing by 50 per cent a year with Australia the highest solar uptake in the world. Australia is on track to reach 50 per cent renewable electricity in 2024 and 100 per cent in 2032.\n\nAustralia\u2019s energy future is exciting, innovative and disruptive but what does it look like?\n\nThe rapid deployment of renewables is part of a broader shift towards distributed energy resources (DER). Household energy storage systems, electric vehicles, demand response and energy-efficient \u201csmart\u201d appliances are increasingly part of the new energy landscape, breaking down traditional barriers to entry and creating a connected series of microgrids.\n\nOrchestrating the rapid growth of DER will not be easy \u2013 building a fit-for-purpose network to accommodate two-way energy flows safely and efficiently is critical. The importance of co-ordinated market design has never been more important in managing our new energy future to provide greater operational flexibility through a series of integrated microsystems. Designing such a network will require the involvement of companies, customers, investors, regulators and local communities. Driven by people power it is a true opportunity to build a robust, sustainable future energy ecosystem, for all parties to take control of their energy needs and individual responsibility for their emissions footprint.\n\nConsumers are at the heart of the modern power system. Markets are moving from a primarily wholesale system providing homogenous energy services to a largely passive audience to dynamic markets where fully engaged customers have the ability to produce and sell energy via distributed generation and storage.\n\nConsumers and their communities are the driving force of change. The emergence of the proactive consumer as the catalyst for change is partly due to Australia\u2019s high and unsustainable energy costs. Household and small businesses face electricity price spikes even in a relatively flat demand environment. Affordability remains a serious issue.\n\nCost alone is no longer the primary driver of decision-making. It is about listening to customers, delivering tailored energy products and services that resonate, and rebuilding trust.\n\nWinning back trust has renewed urgency following the government\u2019s commitment to the extension of the consumer data right to energy. Open energy will fundamentally change the way consumers unlock value of the consumption data. Similar to open banking initiatives, it will improve transparency and likely usher in a new era of competition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHand in hand with open energy is the exponential growth in the volume of data in response to the rollout of automation and digital platforms. Simple, seamless, digitised customer experiences will lead to increased engagement, and innovative energy products and services. Utilities will be able to provide value-add ancillary services and have the tools to enhance energy network management.\n\nA much broader agenda is at stake with energy companies looking to strike the right balance between the environment, society and the shareholder. Energy companies need to be viewed as good corporate citizens and environmentally responsible. Roundly criticised for its environmental footprint, the electricity sector does a lot of good work in this regard \u2013 on track to deliver Australia\u2019s entire Paris emissions reduction targets five years early, in 2025.\n\nThe transition is under way. Far from being a coal-addicted system living off legacy assets, Australia\u2019s power sector is in the lead. It is one of the most dynamic energy markets in the world, a test bed for innovation from distributed energy resources to customer-centric market designs to next-generation digital platforms.", "description": "Rooftop power, electric cars, household storage and smart appliances are creating a new two-way energy and data market that will need new rules.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.301%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_108/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/725175e340fbe2cd14cac6a58fc4cd56a2c1eead", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
