THE USA IS GREAT!\u201d\n\nPresident Trump speaks to reporters as he departs the White House on Friday.

But their long-term goal is to establish a Kurdish state in the region, which Turkey vehemently opposes.\n\nThe White House issued a statement Sunday evening saying U.S. troops \u201cwill not support or be involved in the operation\u201d and \u201cwill no longer be in the immediate area\u201d of northern Syria.\n\nThe announcement was met with immediate blowback from some of Trump\u2019s closest allies, who said it will endanger the lives of Kurds who have been fighting the Islamic State group in the region.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., called it \u201ca disaster in the making.\u201d\n\nNikki Haley, Trump\u2019s former ambassador to the United Nations, said the United States is effectively leaving the Kurds \u201cto die.\u201d\n\nBrett McGurk, Trump\u2019s former envoy for the global coalition to defeat ISIS, tore into Trump in a series of scathing tweets.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is not a Commander-in-Chief,\u201d McGurk tweeted. \u201cHe makes impulsive decisions with no knowledge or deliberation. He sends military personnel into harm\u2019s way with no backing. He blusters and then leaves our allies exposed when adversaries call his bluff or he confronts a hard phone call.\u201d\n\nEven Brian Kilmeade, co-host of Trump\u2019s favorite morning show, \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d was sharply critical of the president.\n\nBrian Kilmeade fights with his co-hosts over Trump throwing Syrian Kurds under the bus: \"What kind of message is that to the next ally that wants to side with us? ... All we did is arm them, and they did all the work. And now we say 'good luck. Good luck surviving.' Disaster.\" pic.twitter.com/ktyDqsM4lS \u2014 Bobby Lewis (@revrrlewis) October 7, 2019\n\n\u201cWe defeated the caliphate, the caliphate is destroyed, we would not have done that without the Kurds, who did all of our fighting,\u201d Kilmeade said. \u201cThe reason why our casualties were so low is because the Kurds did all the fighting. Now we\u2019re saying, \u2018OK, Turks, go wipe them out or force them out.\u2019 What kind of message is that to the next ally that wants to side with us?\n\n\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d Kilmeade continued. \u201cWe\u2019re abandoning our most loyal allies, who did all our fighting. All we did was arm them and they did all the work, and now we say, \u2018Good luck, good luck surviving.\u2019 Disaster.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "President Trump on Monday defended his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria and threatened to \u201ctotally destroy and obliterate\u201d the economy of Turkey should its planned assault on Kurdish fighters go awry.", "authors": ["Dylan Stableford", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/8bbkFtfyX9bWHvZcUXV7.w--~B/aD0zNDQwO3c9NDc2ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/53865330-e923-11e9-bfdf-4ec26dff028b", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
