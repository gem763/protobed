The Gabon striker had been incorrectly judged offside by assistant referee Scott Ledger.\n\nGabriel Jesus questions the referee after his goal against West Ham is ruled out for offside\n\nA total of 26 decisions have been overturned by VAR in 100 Premier League games this season, although the new technology will only apply to offside calls.\n\nReferees\u2019 chief Mike Riley is being kept informed about advances in the new technology with a view to introducing it to the Premier League, although it is unclear whether it will be brought in mid-season.\n\nThe 17 Select Group One referees are due to meet the Premier League on Thursday, as revealed by Sportsmail, for a progress report on how VAR has been used this season.\n\nAubameyang awaits the decision before Arsenal are awarded the goal against Man United\n\nThe summit comes amid calls for referees to make greater use of the technology available, particularly pitch-side monitors.\n\nThe limb-tracking technology could have further practical benefits for clubs, because it will generate more data about player movements during matches than is produced by the GPS systems they wear.\n\nIn addition to the distance and movement data already available, the new system will offer a full skeletal model of every player\u2019s movements, giving a much greater insight to facilitate studies into gait analysis and biomechanics.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE BY MATT HUGHES: Hawk-Eye are working on a sophisticated system using multiple cameras to give video assistants access to an 'automated offside line' in real time.", "authors": ["Matt Hughes For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/20/20345236-0-image-a-9_1572381203628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
