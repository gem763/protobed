This means that the two companies have yet to send details on customers\u2019 balances and on-time payments to Experian EXPN, -0.08%, Equifax EFX, -0.42% and TransUnion TRU, -0.12% \u2014 information that is used to calculate people\u2019s credit scores.\n\nThe source attributed the lack of reporting to the Apple Card being a brand new product, but couldn\u2019t say whether the companies were developing the functionality.\n\nApple referred a request for comment from MarketWatch to Goldman Sachs. Experian, Equifax and TransUnion did not immediately return requests for comment.\n\nThe Apple Card is the first credit card Goldman Sachs has ever offered. When it was unveiled, some observers suggested that card holders could encounter customer service difficulties given that Apple and Goldman Sachs were both new to the credit-card space.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Here\u2019s everything Apple isn\u2019t telling you about its new credit card\n\nWhile credit-card companies are not technically obligated to report to the major credit bureaus, industry experts said the decision was rather unusual. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of a mainstream credit card that doesn\u2019t report to the credit bureaus,\u201d said Ted Rossman, industry analyst at CreditCards.com. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of a few fringe instances of cards failing to report to the bureaus, like certain secured cards, but nothing nearly as widely known as the Apple Card.\u201d\n\nApple and Goldman\u2019s failure to send Apple Card data to the credit-reporting firms could be an issue for some people who signed up for the card.\n\nWhen the card was announced, Apple played up the financial management features associated with it through the Wallet app to help people keep track of their spending habits. The companies also touted the speed of the sign-up process, saying that users would be approved in less than a minute and suggesting that people with thin or poor credit history would be able to obtain the card.\n\nRead more: Apple\u2019s titanium credit card comes with surprisingly strict care instructions\n\nBecause of its relatively competitive rewards program, this made the card potentially popular with people looking to improve their credit score. But this new revelation could hamper them in achieving that goal.\n\n\u201cWith any retail card, a lot of folks who get those cards want to either get started with credit or rebuild their crummy credit,\u201d Matt Schulz, chief industry analyst at CompareCards TREE, +0.49%, told MarketWatch. \u201cIf there\u2019s a card that\u2019s not reporting people\u2019s credit history to the credit bureaus that would be troubling potentially.\u201d\n\nDetails regarding the lack of reporting to credit bureaus were first revealed by Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman on Twitter. In a screenshot he posted, a source at one of the two companies appeared to imply that once Apple and Goldman Sachs develop the functionality, the two companies will report data retroactively.", "description": "Credit-card experts say the choice not to begin reporting to credit bureaus immediately is unusual.", "authors": ["Jacob Passy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HG506_applec_ZG_20190327143123.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
