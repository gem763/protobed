An unbiased report generally has quotes from both sides of an issue.\n\nMs. Lavoie reports that requiring women to have ultrasounds of their babies before aborting was the main challenge from reproductive-rights groups, according to Judge Henry Hudson. Abortuaries generally perform ultrasounds on pregnant women to determine the gestational age of the fetus, but do not show them to the mothers. Seeing her baby on the ultrasound often causes the mother to change her mind and keep her baby \u2014 which means the abortuary loses business. Thus, it is understandable that they don\u2019t want ultrasounds to be required, but it seems only fair for the woman to be able to give informed consent to the abortion.\n\nRosemary Codding, founder and director of the Falls Church Healthcare Center, was quoted as saying, \u201cWe\u2019re disappointed that our patients did not get their constitutionally protected right to accessing healthcare without legislative interferences, which they are entitled to and deserve.\u201d But women have the right to be protected from dirty and unsanitary abortuaries and unscrupulous and incompetent abortionists, of which there are many.\n\nCAROLYN NAUGHTON\n\nSilver Spring, Md.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
