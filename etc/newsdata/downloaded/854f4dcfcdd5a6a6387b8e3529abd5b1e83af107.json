Together, we reacted really well, especially after conceding early. That was really pleasing. The performance was really good. Hopefully we can continue in that way.\u201d\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nThere was almost a belief around the famous old stadium that Liverpool would come back from that surprise Harry Kane goal after just 47 seconds\u2026and it is completely justified.\n\nThe last six times they have gone behind, they have fought back to win, which is an astonishing show of battling spirit.\n\nHenderson typifies that. He has not always had the easiest of relationships with the fans, and held his hand up and took the blame for the Kane goal, when he gave the ball away.\n\nBut he showed typical mental strength to not only drive Liverpool forward, but score a hugely important equaliser, his first Anfield goal since December 2015.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nAnd he laughed as he was reminded of the previous occasion, against West Brom. \u201cI've been told!\u201d he said, when it was pointed out the wait has been almost four years.\n\n\u201cIt was obviously nice to score, get us back in the game. It\u2019s always nice to get on the scoresheet and contribute in that way.\n\n\u201cIt was a good time to score as well so [I\u2019m] pleased with that. But like I say all the time, it\u2019s about the win, it\u2019s about the three points and the performance, and that was very good.\u201d", "description": "The Reds captain grabbed the equaliser against Tottenham in a match that Liverpool never looked like losing", "authors": ["David Maddock", "Image", "Getty Images", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20737792.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Liverpool-FC-v-Tottenham-Hotspur-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
