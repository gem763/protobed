Baseball fans will recall that the Cardinals hung a record 10 runs on the Atlanta Braves in that game and went on to win, 13-1.\n\nThings have a funny way of coming full circle. The Washington Nationals didn\u2019t score 10, but their first inning in Game 4 of the NLCS Tuesday was the most deflating thing that could have happened to an already-wilting Cardinals side.\n\nThe Nationals took a 7-0 lead on St. Louis in the first inning, practically guaranteeing them a sweep of the Cardinals and the first World Series berth in franchise history.\n\nIt started with Patrick Corbin striking out the side to open the game, fanning Tommy Edman, Jose Martinez and Paul Goldschmidt with just 13 pitches.\n\nWashington got on the board quickly as Trea Turner singled, Adam Eaton doubled and Anthony Rendon brought Turned in on a sacrifice fly. Soto scored Eaton on the next play with a booming double to the far left-field corner.\n\nWith just one out, the Cardinals decided to intentionally walk the hot-hitting Howie Kendrick to get to Ryan Zimmerman. Zimmerman grounded to third, but the fielder\u2019s choice throw to Kolten Wong was bobbled and everyone was safe.\n\nVictor Robles got to the plate and hit a blooper into shallow right. Again, it should have been an easy play\u2026 but tell that to the three fielders who let the ball fall to their feet.\n\nOne run scored, and two more followed when Yan Gomes belted a double.\n\n5-0 with only one out. \ud83d\ude31\n\n\n\nThe @Nationals are trying to finish the fight in the first. pic.twitter.com/CpYtukHGNO \u2014 MLB (@MLB) October 16, 2019\n\nPatrick Corbin laid down a sacrifice bunt for the second out and Turner brought in the final two runs on another single.\n\nWhen the dust had settled, the Nationals were just eight innings away from punching their tickets to the World Series.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
