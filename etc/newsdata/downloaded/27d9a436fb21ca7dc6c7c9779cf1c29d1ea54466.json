Either businesses have to be more confident, or you\u2019re likely to see more rollover on the consumer data.\u201d\n\nOne might think that business executives have a better handle of the trajectory of the U.S. economy than the consumer, but historically that\u2019s not always the case. As Sundial Capital Research pointed out on Twitter, previous instances of high consumer confidence and low executive confidence have actually turned out well for stocks.\n\nThe narrative that \"dumb money\" consumers are optimistic while \"smart money\" insiders are prepping for a recession sounds really good and bearish. It's also useless.\n\n\n\nThe only 2 other times it happened, stocks took off to the upside.\n\n\n\nDumb money = 2, Smart money = 0. pic.twitter.com/5RkaJ7k1aM \u2014 SentimenTrader (@sentimentrader) October 9, 2019\n\nJJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade said that in the near term, it\u2019s unlikely that American shoppers will slow their spending. \u201cPeople are employed and when they are employed they spend money,\u201d he said. \u201cHeading into the holiday season, I see no reason why the consumer would slow barring some disaster.\u201d\n\nThere are, however, a few signs in the data that may suggest that weakness in the U.S. manufacturing sector is affecting the larger services sector and the overall labor market, Liz Ann Sonders chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab told MarketWatch.\n\nShe said that while some analysts are eager to write off manufacturing weakness as inconsequential due to that sector\u2019s shrinking role in the American economy, \u201cthere\u2019s a reason why indices of leading economic indicators rely on manufacturing. It\u2019s because there\u2019s a multiplier effect from the sector that filters through to others.\u201d\n\nThat manufacturing weakness has also coincided with falling business investment is also a concern, Sonders argued. She said that during 60% of quarters when economic growth has been negative since 1945, consumer spending stayed positive while business investment shrank. \u201cManufacturing weakness often tips over into the consumer side,\u201d she said.\n\nThere are signs that this might already be under way, she warned, pointing to a Wednesday report which showed that job openings fell in August for the third month in a row, to a one-and-a-half-year low and to data showing that the average hours worked per week has been trending lower in recent months.\n\nThough applications for unemployment benefits \u2014 a key leading indicator of the labor market and the broader economy \u2014 have yet to show any signs of weakness, Sonders said investors should monitor these data closely, given that businesses appear eager to cut costs and postpone new investment decisions.\n\nInvestors will get a fresh reading of U.S. consumer strength on Wednesday, when the Commerce Department will issue its estimate of retail sales growth for the month of September. That same day will see updates on business inventories and National Association of Home Builders\u2019 index.\n\nOn Thursday, the Labor Department will issue its weekly estimate of new claims for jobless benefits, and the Commerce Department will issue readings of housing starts, building permits, and industrial production for the month of September. On Friday, the Conference Board will update its index of leading economic indicators.\n\nTuesday will mark the unofficial start to third-quarter earnings season, with several major financial services companies reporting their results, including Dow components Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, +0.56% and JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM, +0.27% as well as Citigroup Inc. C, +0.20% .\n\nOn Wednesday, aluminum manufacturer Alcoa Corp. AA, -0.57% will deliver results, along with Bank of America Corp. BAC, +0.80%, International Business Machines Corp. IBM, -0.50% and Netflix Inc. NFLX, +0.92%\n\nThursday will see Altassian Corp. Plc. TEAM, +0.05% reporting as well as Morgan Stanley MS, +0.76% and Philip Morris International Inc. PM, +0.10%", "description": "Measures of consumer confidence have been diverging sharply with data on executive and business sentiment", "authors": ["Chris Matthews", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT177_atlas_ZG_20191011144012.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
