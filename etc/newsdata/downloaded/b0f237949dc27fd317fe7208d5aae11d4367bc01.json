For decades banks have been merging, partnering, and expanding \u2014 so much so that the top four banks now account for 50% of all US banking assets. Chase, Bank of America, CitiBank, and Wells Fargo are the top four banks in the US. Business Insider Intelligence\n\nHere are the top 10 banks in the US by assets, with key insights as to how they got there, where they plan to go in the future, and how smaller banks can compete in the industry.\n\n1.

U.S. Bancorp - $475 Billion\n\nU.S. Bancorp, the parent company of U.S. Bank National Association, earned a spot on the list of top US banks due to its commitment to competing with tech giants making their way into the banking industry.\n\nWith Facebook, Amazon, Apple, and Google all announcing their desire to launch banking services, U.S. Bancorp decided to improve its own technology.

Capital One - $373 Billion\n\nDespite its recent data breach, Capital One still managed to make the list of top US banks, likely due to its ongoing commitment to digital transformation.\n\nCapital One increased its technology staff from 2,500 in 2011 to 9,000 in 2019, launched Eno - its AI-powered chatbot, similar to Bank of America's Erica - and is in the midst of a multi-year migration of its back-end software development tools to the cloud.\n\nCapital One also acquired fintech United Income in 2019, a digital platform that offers wealth management services for people moving into retirement. The fintech combines both technological capabilities with human facets, like providing access to a team of wealth managers \u2014 making it attractive for consumers who still desire human interaction.\n\nHow can small banks compete?\n\nBreaking into the digital banking industry is key for smaller firms looking to become major US banks. Neobanks - digital-only banks that aren't tied to traditional banking technology or expensive physical branches - are gaining steam in the US and secured a record $2.5 billion globally in funding for the first half of 2019. Chime Co-founders Chris Britt and Ryan King Chime\n\nChime, a San Francisco-based neobank, took about four years to reach one million users in 2018. It has since acquired over 4 million users \u2014 quadrupling its user base in just one year. The competition put forward by digital-only banks will eventually force traditional banking leaders to revamp their banking practices and offerings due to the increasing digital demands of consumers.\n\nBanking Industry Analysis\n\nThe banking industry is constantly undergoing change in the digital age, and it's important for its biggest decision-makers to stay informed of how the leading US banks continue to garner success.\n\nThat's why Business Insider Intelligence is launching Banking, our newest coverage area, to keep you up to date on strategies and tactics of the largest banks in the US.\n\nInterested in getting the full report?
