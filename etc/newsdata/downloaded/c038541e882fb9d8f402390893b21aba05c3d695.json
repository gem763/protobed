I thought it was someone trying to scam me.\n\n\"It's totally unfair and it feels like I've been violated.\n\n\"When I parked I was in a rush. I needed a ladder because one of my ceilings had collapsed and I needed to get back as soon as possible.\n\n\"When I used it there were hundreds of spaces left. The car park wasn't busy.\n\n\"It says in the letter that the signage is clear but it's not. The signs that are visible are about eight feet high and only one of the entrances has a sign.\n\n\"When I spoke to B&Q about it they were sympathetic to me but said they don't own the car park.\n\n(Image: Rex Features)\n\n\"You shouldn't be going out shopping, parking in a car park and being scared of getting a letter through the door like this. It's not right.\n\n\"A lot of people would pay this out of fear but this shouldn't be the case.\n\n\"I want to make other people and other motorists aware of what these companies are doing. I want to stop this from happening to people with not a lot of money.\n\nThe letter from the company, which was seen by the ECHO, states: \"The terms and conditions of parking on this private land are clearly set out on the signage installed within the car park.\n\n\"By parking within this car park the driver is bound to these terms and conditions and liable to pay a charge if they breach these terms and conditions.\"\n\nMr Yoxall said: \"I went back to the car park the other day and I watched them do three cars in the space of half an hour.\n\n\"I'm not well off. This is a lot of money to me. There should be huge, clear signs but there aren't.\"\n\nPark Watch were contacted for comment.", "description": "Jimmy Yoxall, 59, parked at the New Mersey Shopping Park in Speke, Livepool, where his car was surrounded by dozens of empty spaces", "authors": ["Max Clements", "Abigail O'Leary", "Image", "Liverpool Echo", "Rex Features"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20538870.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_LIV_Jimmy-Yoxall-01.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
