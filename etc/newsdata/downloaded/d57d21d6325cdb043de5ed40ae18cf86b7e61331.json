Sainsbury's sales rose 0.6%, while sales at market leader Tesco (L: ), Asda (N: ) and Morrisons (L: ) were down 0.2%, 0.9% and 1.8% respectively.\n\nAll of the big four continued to lose market share to the German owned discounters Aldi [ALDIEI.UL] and Lidl, who are aggressively opening new space.\n\nAldi and Lidl's sales rose 7.3% and 8.2%, giving a combined market share of 14.1%.", "description": "UK consumers not Brexit stockpiling yet: Kantar", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9E0DH_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
