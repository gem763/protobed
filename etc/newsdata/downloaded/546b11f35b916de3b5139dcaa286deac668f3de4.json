Mitchell claims 22-year-old Thaddeous Green shot Brown, fatally wounding him.\n\nPolice suspect a third man, 32-year-old Michael Mitchell, was the getaway driver after the alleged shooting.\n\nGreen and Mitchell are still on the run and police consider both to be \u201carmed and dangerous.\u201d\n\nThe NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, together with a number of community leaders, \u201chad called for an independent investigation into Brown\u2019s death and the Dallas police department\u201d prior to today\u2019s arrest. There is no word yet on whether the independent investigation will still be sought.\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.
