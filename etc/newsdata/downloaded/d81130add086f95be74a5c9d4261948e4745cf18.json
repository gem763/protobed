Is it an organisation that can change the world, as it frequently insists to us, or is it simply a sporting governing body, as it prefers to claim at other times?\n\nSahar is Iran\u2019s so-called \u201cBlue Girl\u201d, a computer sciences graduate who tried in March to enter Tehran\u2019s Azadi stadium dressed as a man, to watch her beloved Esteghlal, but was caught by officials. She was summoned to appear in court on 2 September, and told she could expect up to six months in prison. Outside the court, Sahar set herself on fire. Last week, she died in hospital from her injuries. She was 29.\n\nIranian female football fan who self-immolated outside court dies Read more\n\nBoth Esteghlal and their main rivals, Persepolis, held a minute\u2019s silence in the wake of the news, but it is the statement her club issued that sticks in the mind for its despair. \u201cOur dear Sahar burnt herself to death, when she was charged to 6 month in jail for \u2026 going to the stadium to support her #Esteghlal,\u201d this read. \u201cShe supported us despite the politics made it illegal for her, but what we can do to support her? ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. We are cowards.\u201d\n\nThe self-chastisement and misery was echoed in a statement by the Iran football captain, Masoud Shojaei, who must also be considered to speak out at some personal risk against the Iranian authorities. He called it \u201cthe most bitter and saddest win of the national team\u201d. \u201cWe scored two goals and won the game on the field. But we lost because Sahar is no longer,\u201d he stated. \u201cShame on me for not having been able to do anything and shame on those who took away the most obvious right from Sahar and all Sahars.\u201d\n\nYet speaking of shamelessness and cowardice, what of Fifa, whose own rules state that discrimination on grounds of gender is punishable, either by expulsion or suspension of a federation? Needless to say their reaction has been rather more muted. Shojaei\u2019s sister Maryam, herself an Iranian women\u2019s rights activist, told last week\u2019s Sunday Times that she had sent eight letters to Fifa since Sahar was charged, begging it to lift the ban. Having had no luck with those, she presented a 200,000 signature petition to Fifa officials at their Swiss headquarters. \u201cNo one took this seriously,\u201d she reflects, explicitly.\n\nEven now, given the emotive outpourings from Iran, Amnesty, and far beyond, Fifa\u2019s stated course of action feels impossibly wan. \u201cA Fifa delegation will be on site shortly to assess the preparations to allow women at the stadium for the upcoming World Cup qualifying match [Iran v Cambodia] in October,\u201d we learn, though this was always planned. Meanwhile, Fifa president Gianni Infantino has been urging the Iranian authorities to take \u201cconcrete steps\u201d to lift the ban on Iranian women.\n\nAfter this latest grotesque tragedy, however, surely the time has come for Fifa to consider some rather more \u201cconcrete steps\u201d of their own? Iran declining to uphold their own discrimination laws should draw a ban or the serious threat of one. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll make nice for the Fifa delegation \u2013 last time Infantino was in town, he watched a Persepolis game at the Azadi stadium which 1,000 women were permitted to attend in a designated \u201cfamily area\u201d. They have been banned ever since.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sahar Khodayari became known as \u2018Blue Girl\u2019 because of her support for Esteghlal.

Iranian president Hassan Rouhani\u2019s chief of staff explained last week that the latest problem preventing this was bad language and so on. \u201cWe don\u2019t see a problem with women attending if the atmosphere in stadiums is convenient,\u201d he explained, \u201cbut with so much foul language among fans and violence, this is not advisable.\u201d Only a matter of time, and all that. Or as Jafar Panahi, the prominent Iranian filmmaker behind Offside, the 2006 documentary about the issue, recalled last week, people had often said to him that his film would quickly become outdated. That was 13 years ago. Who knows, without more decisive censure from Fifa, maybe the Iranian authorities will have eliminated swearing from stadiums in 13 years? And maybe they won\u2019t.\n\nAgain, this is one of those moments when Fifa is going to have to decide which one of two contradictory versions of itself it will cleave to. These were arguably most neatly encapsulated by Sepp Blatter. \u201cFootball has the power to build a better future,\u201d he once declared during a 2013 speech at the Oxford Union. He went on to explain that Fifa\u2019s job is \u201chelping communities in need through football\u201d. \u201cFifa exists \u2026 because we love the game, recognise its power and feel a strong duty to society.\u201d Really? Because not two weeks before this, under fire for the deaths and human rights abuses of migrant workers building the Qatar World Cup infrastructure, he had espoused the diametrically opposite view: \u201cWe are not the ones that can actually change it,\u201d Blatter explained self-effacingly. \u201cThis is not Fifa\u2019s remit.\u201d\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nUnder Infantino, Fifa\u2019s idea of its remit looks deliberately more opaque. But as we lead slowly in to a 2022 World Cup held out of season in a repressive state, at the same time as hearing evidence of ignored petitions and immolations in Qatar\u2019s regional ally, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a whole lot of difference between his and Blatter\u2019s view of the organisation\u2019s capabilities. The 2015 Fifa Spring was rather a shortlived dream of a different world, and normal disservice has since been resumed.", "description": "Toothless urgings followed the death of Sahar Khodayari, who \u2013 when faced with the prospect of prison for trying to watch football \u2013 set herself on fire", "authors": ["Marina Hyde"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e93a9f18f25be8c0462251efe72c8fdf2c1e6151/0_311_4778_2866/master/4778.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=a88aff536f54a4ed20284520330fc2bd", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
