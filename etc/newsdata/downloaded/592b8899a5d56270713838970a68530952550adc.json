Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, said on Monday. \u201cBut until Congress gets around to replacing it, President Trump will do what he can to fix the problems created by this system for millions of Americans.\u201d\n\nThe 4-percent price decline is only the second time that average monthly premiums have dropped year-to-year since the marketplace opened in 2014, and it is a sign that the health law is stabilizing after several years of turmoil caused in part by Mr. Trump.
