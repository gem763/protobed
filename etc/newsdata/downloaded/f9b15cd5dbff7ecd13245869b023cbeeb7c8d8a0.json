I was really surprised. The players and coach were surprised too.\u201d\n\nChoi said he had asked a North Korean official about the absence of local fans, who retorted: \u201cMaybe they didn\u2019t want to see it.\u201d\n\nTottenham\u2019s Son, who captained the South Korean team, was taken aback by the Northerners\u2019 rough tactics.\n\n\u201cThe match was very aggressive to a degree that I think it\u2019s a huge achievement just to return safely without being injured,\u201d Son said.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of severe swearing.\u201d\n\nChoi added he had never seen such aggression on the pitch before: \u201cIt was like war.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Nuclear tensions, Olympic doubts \u2013\n\nTuesday\u2019s match came in the wake of a series of North Korean missile tests that raised tensions in the region, and after the breakdown of talks with the US over Pyongyang\u2019s weapons programmes.\n\nSince the collapse of the Hanoi summit between North Koren leader Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump in February, Pyongyang has regularly excoriated Seoul, ruling out prospects of inter-Korean dialogue.\n\nIt is a far cry from the cross-border warmth of last year, when South Korean President Moon Jae-in seized on the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics to broker the Pyongyang-Washington discussion process.\n\nAt the time, Moon and Kim discussed and agreed on further sports exchanges including a joint bid to host the 2032 Olympics.\n\nBut the North\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency issued only a two-line dispatch on Tuesday\u2019s match, saying: \u201cThe game of attacks and counterattacks ended in a draw.\u201d\n\nIn a commentary Thursday the South\u2019s Joongang Daily said: \u201cWe may just have to thank North Korea for sending our football team back home safely.\n\n\u201cHow can South Korea think of co-hosting the Olympics with such a treacherous counterpart?\u201d\n\nFIFA president Infantino said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d after attending the event and \u201csurprised\u201d by the absence of fans, along with other issues.\n\nInfantino has previously proposed the idea of the two Koreas jointly hosting the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup.\n\nBut outraged South Korean fans, who had to settle for basic updates provided by FIFA throughout the match that were limited to yellow cards and substitutes, said they were fed up with sporting exchanges with the North.\n\n\u201cHow can a country that blocks spectators and bans live broadcasts host the World Cup?\u201d asked an online user.\n\nAnother user added: \u201cDon\u2019t ever talk about joint teams with North Korea or co-hosting anything.\u201d", "description": "Incheon (South Korea) (AFP) \u2013 South Korea\u2019s footballers had no idea their surreal World Cup qualifier in Pyongyang would be played in an empty", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/17/00ae5a_south-korea-hwang-ui-jo-north-korea-ri-yong-jik-fight-ball-world-cup-2022-qualifying-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
