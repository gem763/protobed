All manner of login pages are automatically redirected to single verification page with a photo upload requirement. \u2014 Cory Comer (@corywcomer) October 14, 2019\n\n'I had an old colleague of mine add me on Facebook as a friend. After I accepted the request, he reached out to me on Messenger and asked me to give him money,' Comer told Mashable.\n\n'So I was like, \u2018Alright, you're not Dave\u2019 and I reported them. Just a few hours later, I was locked out of my account.'\n\nAfter being locked out, Facebook is reportedly asking users to provide some form of ID in order to reclaim their account, however, that failsafe has not worked as planned.\n\nEven after providing photo ID, users have remained locked out of their accounts without adequate technical support, sometimes for nearly a month.\n\n'My account has been locked 23 days now with zero assistance in any form from Facebook,' Kara Missione told Mashable, adding that it has also affected her professional life.\n\n'I run a large part of my business on Facebook and we pay significant ad costs...I\u2019ve lost income. Financially and emotionally it\u2019s been a hit.'\n\nPart of the problem, reports Mashasble, is that in order to receive support for their accounts, users are required to login to the very accounts that they've been booted from.\n\nOther pleas sent to customer support have gone unanswered, reports Mashable.\n\nIn some cases, the scammers triggering the lock outs had been impersonating people - dead or alive - close to users.\n\n'My friends dead grandma requested me, when I reported her I got locked out. This is happening all over and FB is not helping,' tweeted one user.\n\nFacebook says that it has rectified the issue, saying it inadvertently required users to verify their accounts but did not elaborate on the root cause.\n\n'We worked quickly to fix an issue where we unnecessarily asked some people to verify their accounts after they reported account impersonation for someone else,' said a spokesperson.\n\n'We've removed this request and restored access to the affected accounts.'", "description": "Some users say they have been booted from Facebook for up to a week after attempting to alert the company that they received a fraudulent message from online scammers.", "authors": ["James Pero For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/19/14211300-0-image-a-38_1571164922623.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
