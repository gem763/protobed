' The last time I was in this situation (2016) I found myself in Australia and I didn't want to be in that position again.'\n\nAndy Murray speaks during a press conference in Antwerp on Monday afternoon\n\nMurray, who got back from three weeks in China last Wednesday, arrives ranked a nominal 243 with the aim of one last regular tournament this season taking him closer to new British men's No 1 Dan Evans.\n\nThe 32 year-old Scot and the present world No 43 from Birmingham have not always shared the same levels of monastic self-discipline, but Murray is pleased to see that the Midlander's greatly improved levels of application have brought their reward.\n\n'To be fair, when I have practised with him over the years he has always been pretty good, especially when playing sets or competitive stuff,' said Murray of Evans, who was last night playing Bernard Tomic in the Stockholm Open first round.\n\n'He has obviously spoken about the professionalism and that side of things, but the time that I spent with him on court recently I couldn't fault that side of things. There's also not been loads of matches where you would have gone, like with Dan, \"Oh you really should have won that match\".\n\nMurray wants to be close to home as his wife Kim Sears in currently heavily pregnant\n\n'He is beating most of the players that he should be winning against, although obviously to make that next step, you want to be beating the guys ahead of you. I am sure that will come.\n\n'I feel like him and Cam Norrie (world No 61) have been pushing each other, they are playing a lot of tournaments, getting through qualifying, not shirking away from that, and their effort in practice has been really good.'\n\nFrom next week Norrie will be minimally GB No 2. He will replace the slumping Kyle Edmund, who lost in the first round of qualifying here a year on from lifting the European Open trophy, and is currently seeking a new coach.\n\nThe Brit will wrap up his mini comeback tour at the European Open in Antwerp, Belgium\n\nAlongside others within British tennis Murray has also been keeping tabs on Surrey's 17 year-old southpaw Jack Draper, whose wins at lower tier professional events now see him on the cusp of the professional top 300 and the highest ranked under eighteen in the world. He predicts an extremely bright future.\n\n'With Jack, I practised with him a couple of times over the grass season and I have watched him play a little bit,' said the twice Wimbledon champion. 'He has got a lot of potential, a lot of ability. I like Ryan Jones (his coach). I have spent a bit of time on training blocks when he was with Kyle and I really like his attitude. He is one of those coaches who doesn't mind disagreements and being questioned, he doesn't take things personally and that's important with a young athlete.\n\n'Jack could obviously do really well. He has had quite a few injuries in the last year or so and he has grown a lot. He is a big guy now, so once he stops growing and gets stronger, you would expect him to get right up there.'", "description": "MIKE DICKSON IN ANTWERP: The attraction of being just a three-hour train ride from home was a persuasive argument for Andy Murray to wrap up his mini comeback tour at the European Open.", "authors": ["Mike Dickson For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/19/19706246-0-image-a-35_1571079158583.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
