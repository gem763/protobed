We need to make this clear to the courts. It must be an eye for eye,\" Museveni wrote in a blog post Tuesday.\n\nThe president's nephew, Joshua Rushegyera, was found dead with a gunshot wound near a car parked on a popular highway in Kampala on September 5. A woman with bullet wounds was found dead in the vehicle, according to a statement by the Uganda Police Force investigating the case. No arrests have been made.\n\nIn another case, the bodies of a woman and her driver were found August 30, two days after they were abducted from their home. Museveni said the killers have been arrested.\n\nIn that case, Museveni said camera footage showed policemen on duty were sleeping and failed to trace the vehicle used by the kidnappers when the victims' relatives reported the incident. The president said he had given an order for the officers to be prosecuted and dismissed from government service.\n\n\"If those who are in uniform today cannot do their job, there are plenty who will replace them,\" Museveni said.\n\nCNN has reached out to Uganda's police spokesman for comment to Museveni's allegations and is awaiting a response.\n\nSerious crimes, including murder and treason, can be punished with the death sentence in Uganda, but it is not mandatory and only handed out at a judge's discretion.\n\nJUST WATCHED US tourist savors first hours of freedom after rescue Replay More Videos ...
