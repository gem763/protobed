Democratic candidates Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, and Juli\u00e1n Castro have called for Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment, but Democratic Whip Dick Durbin said, \u201cGet real.\u201d An illegitimate confirmation backed by a sham investigation must be treated as if it were legitimate. If all that matters is partisan scorekeeping, then the so-called victors will look at this and think this somehow burnishes the victory.\n\nBut this will not pass. This is only the first of many anniversaries when Americans will revisit this awful episode, and every time we will be struck anew by the modern GOP\u2019s turpitude, the hearing\u2019s brevity, the abridged investigation, and the corrosive permanence of the effects. A party hell-bent on winning triumphed this round, but it has no idea what\u2019s coming if an institution that most Americans no longer respect tries to move the law in an unpopular direction\u2014like banning abortion. Despite this country\u2019s revolutionary past, Americans have temperamentally been law-abiding institutionalists. That can change. Granted, it would take an enormous amount of bad faith to construct a government so unrepresentative and unworthy of trust that working around a Supreme Court decision with civil disobedience would come to seem not just thinkable but necessary.\n\nRepublicans made a certain calculus when they confirmed Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court: victory at any price. The GOP has celebrated the victory. It has not yet understood the price.", "description": "", "authors": ["Lili Loofbourow", "Slate.Com News-And-Politics Kavanaugh-Ramirez-New-Allegation.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
