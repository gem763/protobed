That includes past cases as well,\u201d Mr. Baldwin tweeted to his foundation\u2019s 1.1 million followers. \u201cCommunity service, fines, yes. But prison time, no.\n\n\u201cMy heart goes out to Felicity, Bill Macy and their family,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHuffman was sentenced on Sept. 13 to serve two weeks in federal prison as well as pay a $30,000 fine and complete 250 hours of community service after she pleaded guilty to paying Rick Singer $15,000 to correct her daughter\u2019s SAT scores. Many critics have slammed the light prison sentence, which began Tuesday, as another example of white privilege and how the wealthy and connected appear to receive special treatment in the U.S. justice system.\n\nNot Mr. Baldwin. He thinks class envy has gotten to \u201cmind-blowing\u201d proportions.\n\n\u201cCommunity service is better,\u201d he wrote after receiving some backlash for his initial tweet. \u201cThe demonization of wealth in this country is mind blowing. A country built on both freedoms and commerce. Now, all success is scrutinized. Merely to succeed, especially financially, invites scrutiny, judgment, abuse.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
