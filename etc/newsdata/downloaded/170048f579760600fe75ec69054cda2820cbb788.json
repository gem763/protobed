The Times reported that President Trump, through his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was pressing Ukraine\u2019s government to investigate Joe Biden. And yet, having uncovered a massive scandal, the Times buried its own scoop. The revelation, which many people now see an an impeachable offense, was buried in the middle of a story that was primarily devoted to carrying Trump\u2019s water.\n\nHeadlined \u201cBiden Faces Conflict of Interest Questions That Are Being Promoted by Trump and Allies\ufeff,\u201d the story spun out a version of the narrative Giuliani has been trying to implant in the media. It suggested that, during his tenure as vice-president, Joe Biden took untoward action to help his son Hunter\u2019s business in Ukraine by demanding the firing of a prosecutor who was investigating him. The news about Trump\u2019s role arrived only after nine paragraphs of insinuations against Biden. And then, after a brief detour that casually reveals that the Biden story is the product of an extraordinary abuse of power by the president, it returns to a long unspooling of the Biden-Ukraine narrative.\n\nEven at the the time, and especially in retrospect, it was an example of extremely bizarre journalistic judgment. One of the biggest presidential scandals in history had been dropped into the Times\u2019 lap, and it relegated the news to a subplot to its main story of vague insinuations against Biden. The reporter, Ken Vogel, was too wrapped up in trying to nail the story he set out cover to notice that the actions of his sources, rather than the information they were promoting, was the real story.\n\nThe Times article had important ramifications. It immediately cast Trump\u2019s Biden campaign as an oh-by-the-way detail, allowing the scandal to fester unremarked in the background for months until happenstance thrust it back into the headlines.\n\nThe strange saga of the Times scoop also suggests something more disturbing: that Trump has hacked into the mainstream media\u2019s ethics and turned them to his advantage. What\u2019s more, even now that his conduct has been exposed, Trump\u2019s gambit that he could abuse his power to discredit an opponent may yet succeed.\n\nThe alleged Biden scandal that the Times was attempting to plumb has been conclusively debunked. Biden\u2019s call for firing a notoriously ineffectual Ukrainian prosecutor was in line with the stance not only of the Obama administration but the IMF, the World Bank, Western allies, and good-government types of all sorts. What\u2019s more, the case against the Ukrainian firm that employed Hunter Biden had been dormant before the prosecutor\u2019s firing.\n\nTrump has presented his demands that Ukraine investigate Biden as high-minded opposition to \u201ccorruption.\u201d This turns reality on its head. Biden was pushing Ukraine to root out corruption, and Trump and Giuliani are working hand in hand with the most corrupt elements in the Ukrainian polity \u2014 the actors who secretly hired Paul Manafort to elect pro-Russian kleptocrats. Trump, meanwhile, has displayed a notable indifference to foreign corruption. He has publicly disparaged the federal law preventing American businesses from bribing foreign officials, and enforcement of the law has plummeted under his administration. Trump is personally collecting large, undisclosed sums from domestic and foreign sources with a keen interest in currying his administration\u2019s favor. And while it\u2019s true that Hunter Biden was trading on his father\u2019s name, all the Trump children are doing the same, and it barely attracts any attention given all the other scandals blotting it out.\n\nThe notion that Trump was legitimately interested in rooting out corruption in Ukraine is a transparent farce. Even if he\u2019d somehow developed a genuine interest in tamping down corruption \u2014 an interest that runs counter to his entire business career and functioning as president \u2014 his handing off the task to Giuliani exposes the ruse. There are actual diplomatic channels that can be used to encourage foreign countries to investigate legitimate crimes. The president\u2019s personal lawyer is not one of them.\n\nAnd yet the Times\u2019 willingness to lend credence to Giuliani\u2019s smear campaign is hardly unique. Vogel this weekend called Hunter Biden\u2019s history \u201ca significant liability for Joe Biden.\u201d A Washington Post headline noted, \u201cScrutiny over Trump\u2019s Ukraine Scandal May Also Complicate Biden\u2019s Campaign.\u201d\n\nThat is true if you disassociate the role of the media in creating those perceptions and take those statements as pure predictions. Giuliani\u2019s barely controlled performance on CNN with Chris Cuomo might have appeared like a failure of spin, but he succeeded in his primary goal of juxtaposing \u201cBiden\u201d with words like \u201ccorrupt\u201d and \u201cscandal\u201d dozens of times over half an hour of airtime. The Clinton-email debacle proved that even third-rate Democratic peccadilloes can be decontextualized and turned into symbols of deep moral rot.\n\nGiuliani explained on Fox News how the method can work. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way you can get this out. The only way they would cover this story is by punching the president in the face, and then the president deflects the punch, which he\u2019s done, the story came down, and then he hits with a right hand that\u2019s more powerful.\u201d Anything that results in the media\u2019s raising questions about Democrats helps Trump, however minor or unfounded the questions may be.\n\nThe inexhaustible fire hose of Trumpian misconduct has only made this formula more effective. Trump\u2019s supporters hold him to the lowest imaginable standard of conduct, while Democratic voters hold their leaders to fairly high standards. Trump\u2019s base is almost immune to news of misconduct by him, while the Democratic base is highly sensitive to it. It\u2019s therefore plausible for Trump to assume that a story that combines unsubstantiated allegations against people in his opponent\u2019s orbit with massive, undisguised abuse of power by Trump himself is a net win.\n\nTrump sent Giuliani to undertake a campaign so scurrilous that even Giuliani conceded the immorality from the outset. (\u201cThere\u2019s nothing illegal about it,\u201d he said in May; \u201csomebody could say it\u2019s improper.\u201d) He did so in the belief that Biden would ultimately sustain more damage. We will see if he was right.", "description": "The New York Times had all the elements of the Trump-Ukraine scandal in place last May. Instead it focused on unfounded allegations against Joe Biden.
