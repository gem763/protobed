However, the saddest thing is the fact that the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4XL aren't coming to India.\n\nA Google spokesperson told Indiatimes in a statement: \"Google has a wide range of products that we make available in different regions around the world. We determine availability based on a variety of factors, including local trends, and product features. We decided not to make Pixel 4 available in India. We remain committed to our current Pixel phones and look forward to bringing future Pixel devices to India.\"\n\nThe reason for this is because the Soli Radar that's on the Pixel 4 is running on a 60GHz frequency. The Indian government doesn't permit common people to use this frequency (which obviously isn't the case in US and Canada, among a few other countries across the globe) thus unauthorizing its use in India .\n\nGoogle\n\nThe top section paraphernalia of sensors on the Pixel 4's include a Face unlock IR camera, a standard front-facing camera, An ambient light/ proximity sensor, a Soli Radar chip, a Face Unlock Dot Projector, another Face Unlock IR camera and a Face unlock Flood Illuminator.\n\nDon't Miss 535 SHARES\n\nPixel 4 gets a 5.7-inch full-HD+ display whereas Pixel 4XL gets a slightly larger 6.3-inch QHD+ display. Both these are OLED panels with Google's 'Smooth Motion' (90Hz refresh rate) technology.\n\nGoogle\n\nPixel 4 and Pixel 4XL get a dual-camera setup at the back with a 12-megapixel primary sensor and a secondary telephoto 16-megapixel sensor. The device also gets a single 8-megapixel selfie shooter.\n\nUnder the hood, the phones are still using the dated Snapdragon 855 paired with 6GB of RAM and 64/128GB storage variants. Powering the Pixel 4 is a disappointing 2800mAh battery, whereas the Pixel 4XL gets a 3700mAh battery.\n\nWith Pixel 4 and 4XL not launching in India due to the Soli, we can surely expect the search-engine giant to unveil a Pixel 4a and 4a XL sometime next year (just like it did for the Pixel 3a and 3a XL), probably by March 2020.", "description": "Google has finally unveiled its most awaited Pixel 4 and Pixel 4XL to the world with its fancy-schmancy motion-sensing gestures and a camera setup to give a tough competition to the iPhone 11 Pro's.
