Macy, into the John Joseph Moakley U.S. Courthouse in Boston, for her 2:30 p.m. sentencing before Judge Indira Talwani.\n\nHuffman pleaded guilty in May to charges of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud for allegedly paying $15,000 in 2017 to have her daughter\u2019s SAT scores fixed. Macy was not named in court papers.\n\nThe star and mom of two was arrested in March as part of a federal investigation, dubbed \u201cVarsity Blues,\u201d for paying for a designated person to proctor her daughter\u2019s exam in December 2017, then change her answers to improve the score.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nNearly 50 other people, including \u201cFull House\u201d star Lori Loughlin and her fashion-designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli, were also charged in the sweeping investigation.\n\nOn Sept. 4, Huffman wrote a letter to Talwani begging her to \u201cshed light on the how I finally got to the day when I said \u201cYes\u201d to this scheme.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my desperation to be a good mother I talked myself into believing that all I was doing was giving my daughter a fair shot,\u201d Huffman wrote. \u201cI see the irony in that statement now because what I have done is the opposite of fair. I have broken the law, deceived the educational community, betrayed my daughter, and failed my family.\u201d\n\nFederal prosecutors asked that Huffman be sentenced to one month behind bars, a year of supervised release and a $20,000 fine. Huffman\u2019s defense requested 250 hours of community service, a $20,000 fine and one year probation.\n\nOn Friday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Eric Rosen said all parents wanted \"the best\" for their children -- \"to give them an edge\" -- but Huffman had no \"moral compass.\"\n\n\"With all due respect, welcome to parenthood. It's terrifying and stressful,\" Rosen said. \"What parenthood does not to it does not make you a felon. Doesn't make you a cheat.\"\n\nHuffman's attorney, Mary Murphy argued that Huffman had the opportunity to commit the crime a second time, but opted not to.\n\n\"She said it just didn't seem right,\" Murphy said. \"That was a litmus test of her character.\"\n\nHuffman sobbed as she addressed the court.\n\n\"I am deeply ashamed of what I have done,\" she said, through tears. \"I have done more damage than I could ever imagine. I realize now with my mothering that love and truth go hand in hand.\"\n\nIn addition to the jail time, the judge imposed a $30,000 fine, 250 hours of community service and one year probation.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nFOX Business's Andrew Fone contributed to this story's reporting.\n\nRead Huffman's full letter to Talwani:", "description": "Huffman pleaded guilty in May to charges of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud for allegedly paying $15,000 to have her daughter\u2019s SAT scores fixed.", "authors": ["Stephanie Pagones"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/04/0/0/AP19093552725445.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
