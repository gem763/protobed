Gizmodo was sent product from RACV to trial.\n\nI personally have a reluctant acceptance to open windows that create a breeze, a begrudging sigh for bold mice (before a swift call to the real estate) and the acknowledgement that in the highly unlikely occurrence of a spectral haunting, who knows what I\u2019d do.\n\nBut in general, if you\u2019re not home, things should be still. So the idea of motion sensing technology appeals to me.\n\nSure, I know that my home is probably safe most of the time. But knowing it without a shadow of a doubt? It soothes my mind.\n\nSmart home technology keeps you informed with what\u2019s going on in your and there\u2019s also a whole host of ways that this technology can serve you.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can get started.\n\nLet\u2019s get physical\n\nInstalling motion sensing technology is the first step in adding an extra measure to your home so you always know what\u2019s happening in your house.\n\nYou can even keep an eye on it from afar because most of this tech is accessible from an app.\n\nThis means that you can be alerted to any potential intruders even if you\u2019re away on holiday or at work. It\u2019ll even tell you if you\u2019ve left your door or windows open and unlocked.\n\nIf you upgrade your existing smart home technology with an Arlo Pro 2 Smart Security Camera, you can also see any disturbances on your phone while you\u2019re away from home.\n\nMake sure your Wi-Fi is secure\n\nOn a base level, your Wi\u00adFi router is the first port of call for signalling all the smart home devices and ensuring that they\u2019re all functioning as you direct \u2014 so naturally you\u2019re going to want to make sure the security around both is top notch.\n\nWi-Fi security is more than just choosing a hard\u00ad to \u00adcrack password though (something that\u2019s difficult to break into is imperative \u2014 so no, your pet\u2019s name and date of birth doesn\u2019t cut it).\n\nIt\u2019s also upgrading your firmware, actually delving into your router\u2019s configuration settings, using WPA2 (Wi\u00adFi Protected Access 2) instead of WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy protocol) and turning off Wi\u00adFi protected set\u00adup (which functions by allowing you to access it with a PIN instead of password \u2014 not particularly secure).\n\nYou can also set up a guest network for your home, so that when you have people over they won\u2019t be using the same Wi\u00adFi network as your smart devices. That way there\u2019s no chance of overlap (or of people accidentally divulging your details if their own security isn\u2019t great).\n\nLight \u2018em up\n\nObviously there are a stack of benefits when it comes to utilising smart home technology, but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re in any way restricted to using it conventionally.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve increased your smart home tech collection to include lightbulbs, for example, it opens up a whole host of options. You can conceivably set your lights to certain time frames to reduce electricity costs and increase your sustainability cred.\n\nYou can even set them to turn on as soon as you\u2019re about to get home, paired with your favourite song to greet you when you step through the door.\n\nOr if you\u2019re me, you can use a motion sensor connected to an LED strip to light up a path from the bedroom to the bathroom when you\u2019re trudging, groggy in the middle of the night, and don\u2019t want to turn on the obnoxiously bright main light.\n\nAnd that\u2019s still only the beginning. Though smart home technology is still in the process of being more common, there\u2019s little question that there will be plenty of avenues to adapt it to whatever purpose your home requires.\n\nTake heating for example. With an app, not only could you indulge your lazy side and control the warmth of your home easily, but you can even do it at a distance so your house is heated upon your arrival.\n\nStart with the basics\n\nRegardless of all the benefits, it can still be daunting to pop in\u00ad-store and figure out which pieces you need to purchase to get started \u2014 especially if you\u2019re a complete newbie to the technology.\n\nOn top of that, for renters and apartment dwellers who don\u2019t have the luxury of installing wired-based smart home tech can still benefit from a lot of what is in the market in 2019.\n\nThe kit, retailing for $299 plus shipping Australia\u00ad-wide, consists of a SmartThings Wi\u00adFi Hub, two wireless SmartThings Multipurpose sensors, and three wireless SmartThings Motion sensors.\n\nThat way you can get set up with the basics simply and easily, without having to muck around with different additions until you\u2019re ready to step it up a notch \u2014 plus for $79 RACV can set it up for you.\n\nAll you have to do is sit back with your phone and direct your smart home technology to do your bidding.\n\nAll in all, smart home technology doesn\u2019t have to feel like a whole new arena of technological challenges. It also doesn\u2019t have to be a super serious undertaking.\n\nWhether you\u2019re opting to use it for staying up to date with your home when you\u2019re not around or you just want to make your late-night bathroom visit slightly more convenient, it\u2019s worth considering.", "description": "Unless you\u2019ve got a pet that enjoys roaming your house, venturing in and out of doors as they please, any unknown moving presence in your home is probably unwelcome....", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://edge.alluremedia.com.au/m/g/2019/08/iStock-981353794.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
