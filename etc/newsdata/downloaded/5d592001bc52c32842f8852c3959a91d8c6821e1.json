Its founder, Palmer Luckey, is one of Silicon Valley\u2019s most famous Trump partisans. The 27-year-old has gleefully trolled the Valley\u2019s liberals since he left Facebook Inc. in 2017 under controversial circumstances. Founders Fund, one of Anduril\u2019s first big investors, was started by another Trump stalwart, Peter Thiel. Trae Stephens, Anduril\u2019s chairman, is also a Founders Fund partner and took part in Trump\u2019s transition team. The company recently began working on Maven, the project Google dropped.\n\nExecutives at Anduril say they\u2019re less interested in serving any particular president than in fulfilling the Pentagon\u2019s enduring need for reliable technology. Some companies, Stephens says, have complicated things for themselves by concealing or downplaying their defense work, leaving employees who are uncomfortable with such projects to feel, justifiably, that they\u2019ve been lied to. \u201cThey said, \u2018We didn\u2019t sign up to develop weapons,\u2019 \u201d Stephens says. \u201cThat\u2019s literally the opposite of Anduril. We will tell candidates when they walk in the door, \u2018You are signing up to build weapons.\u2019 \u201d\u2026\n\nCritics described Anduril as either a technological manifestation of Trumpism, an amoral profiteer, or both. Luckey saw the outrage as useful. \u201cWe were telling people that border security is not going to be the last time there\u2019s a controversy around something we\u2019re working on,\u201d he says. Not all Anduril employees are pleased. Grimm, who describes himself as an \u201cObama fanboy\u201d and the most liberal member of the founding team, grimaces when the subject comes up. \u201cThe goal was not to set out and say, \u2018We\u2019re the border security company,\u2019 \u201d he says. \u201cIt was actually quite frustrating for us through the first year and a half, because of course that was the narrative.\u201d Anduril executives are quick to point out that many Democrats have supported electronic border surveillance as a more humane alternative to a physical border wall.", "description": "", "authors": ["Bloomberg.Com News Features Tech-S-Most-Controversial-Startup-Now-Makes-Attack-Drones"], "top_image": ""}
