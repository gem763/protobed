Additionally, the company has discouraged customers to openly carry firearms in its stores.\n\nInsider polled more than a thousand American adults for their views on Walmart's stand in the national gun debate, asking whether or not they support the retailer's decision to remake its gun policies. More than 60% said they did, with 39% saying, \"I support Walmart's decision, and I believe the company was acting in good faith,\" and 23% saying, \"I support Walmart's decision, but I believe it was for publicity.\"\n\nThe company is expected to see a decrease in market share in ammunition from 20% to between 6% and 9%.\n\nBut the day after the announcement, Walmart's stock skyrocketed. Whether or not they support the retailer, more than 40% of those polled said they believe the move was motivated by publicity rather than good faith.\n\nRespondents in the poll were asked to report their political affiliations, disclosing whether they plan to participate in their states' primaries and caucuses. Self-identified Democratic voters were overwhelmingly in favor of Walmart's decision, with 85% saying they support it.\n\nThe topic was more polarizing for Republican voters, who were split on the issue, with 40% in favor of Walmart's decision and 55% opposed.\n\nPrevious polls run by both Gallup and Pew Research Center have found that around 60% of Americans support stricter gun laws. The results of Insider's poll align with this perception, further indicating that consumers are also supportive of retailers playing a role in enforcing gun control.\n\nDivided Republican support for Walmart's decision suggests that attitudes may be shifting among the party's constituents when it comes to gun policy \u2014 and the recent spate of deadly mass shootings may be pushing the country closer to consensus on guns.\n\nSurveyMonkey Audience polls from a national sample balanced by census data of age and gender. Respondents are incentivized to complete surveys through charitable contributions. Generally speaking, digital polling tends to skew toward people with access to the internet. Total 1,090 respondents collected September 6 to September 7, 2019, a margin of error plus or minus 3.07 percentage points with a 95% confidence level.\n\nRead more:\n\nI tried to buy a gun at Walmart twice, and roadblocks left me empty-handed both times\n\nWalmart asked shoppers to stop openly carrying guns in its stores, but won't necessarily punish those who do\n\nNRA calls Walmart open-carry ban a 'shameful' move to appeal to 'anti-gun elites'", "description": "A new Insider poll found that most Americans support Walmart\u2019s recent overhauls in gun policy.
