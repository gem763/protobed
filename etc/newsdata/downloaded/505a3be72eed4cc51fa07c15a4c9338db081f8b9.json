On Economy, More Americans See President in Charge Than the Fed\n\n(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump has tried to blame the Federal Reserve for a slowing U.S. economy, but it turns out that voters may pin the blame on him.\n\nA Bloomberg survey conducted with YouGov showed 28% of American adults believe the president in general is most responsible for the economy. That surpasses the 20% of respondents who say Congress is most responsible and the 17% who assign responsibility to the central bank. The margin of error is plus or minus 3 percentage points.\n\nTrump, who\u2019s up for re-election next year, has repeatedly attacked the U.S. central bank and its head Jerome Powell, accusing the Fed of stifling economic growth by keeping interest rates too high. Despite his attempts to shift blame to the Fed, the poll suggests about twice as many Americans still see the president as most responsible for the nation\u2019s economic well-being.\n\nOver the past two years, Trump has tied himself closely to the economy, said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s trying to shift the paradigm to be, \u2018The economy\u2019s good because of him and the economy\u2019s bad because of somebody else,\u2019 but I\u2019m not sure that will work in people\u2019s psyche,\u201d Daco said.\n\nU.S. economic growth cooled in the second quarter to a 2% annualized pace, and analysts expect slower gains in the second half, putting Trump\u2019s 3% goal out of reach. Economists see higher chances of an imminent recession than they did a year ago.\n\nThe survey asked 1,262 adults, \u201cIn your opinion, who is most responsible for the economy?\u201d Options included the president, Congress, the Federal Reserve, \u201cnone of these,\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t know.\u201d The survey was conducted Sept. 6-9.\n\nWho is truly responsible for the economy can be a matter of debate. The president and lawmakers can set parameters for growth through taxes, fiscal policy and regulation. At the same time, the Fed -- whose chairman and board members are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate -- has a powerful tool in short-term interest rates to manage swings in the economy.\n\nThrough tweets, speeches and press releases, Trump has emphasized his role in stock-market gains, low unemployment and economic growth. Yet as odds of recession have grown, the president has tried to distance himself from more negative data by blaming the Fed. And for good reason: In the last century, the only elected presidents who lost re-election did so after overseeing a recession.\n\nBecause of how vociferous Trump has been about what the Fed should and shouldn\u2019t do, there may be \u201ca feeling that relative to past presidents, he\u2019s doing a lot more trying to manage the economy,\u201d said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group. That\u2019s seemingly in contradiction with the intention of Trump\u2019s tweets.\n\nTrade Policy\n\nAt the same time, one of the biggest threats to the economic outlook is U.S.-China trade policy. A trade war with China -- and the tariffs and uncertainty that come along with it -- have weighed on American companies, especially those in the manufacturing sector.\n\nBy announcing new rounds of tariffs and policy updates through Twitter, Trump further associates himself with the economic policies that may be most hurting the expansion despite intentions to protect American businesses and the economy from what the administration calls one-sided trade deals.\n\nExpansions typically end because of a policy mistake by Congress, the president or the Fed, and right now, \u201cif you\u2019re looking around for culprits, I would say what a lot of us would point to is trade policy,\u201d said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust Corp (NASDAQ: ).\n\nDividing data among different groups, Republicans (35%) were more likely to assign responsibility of the economy to the president than Democrats (30%).\n\nWhen breaking down the results by education, those with less than a four-year degree were in line with the national trend in placing responsibility with the president but also had a significantly greater number of respondents say \u201cDon\u2019t know.\u201d Those with four-year and post-graduate degrees had the highest levels of attributing responsibility to the Fed or \u201cNone of these.\u201d\n\nThe breakdown did vary significantly by age group. A third of baby boomers, those born 1946-1964, saw the president as the most responsible, while less than a fourth of millennials (1982-1999) and Generation X individuals (1965-1981) felt the same. Generation X was split almost equally between the president and the Fed at 23% and 22% respectively.\n\nPart of this may stem from how involved the Fed was in various downturns and recoveries over time.\n\n\u201cThe generation that lived through the Great Moderation believe much more in the Fed than generations on either side,\u201d Daco said.\n\nAfter taking office in 1979, then-Fed Chairman Paul Volcker boosted interest rates to historical highs in an attempt to get inflation under control. While the move ultimately drove the economy into a recession, it\u2019s possible many adults associate the Fed with the long economic expansions of the 1980s and 1990s that followed -- a period known as the \u201cGreat Moderation.\u201d\n\nFor younger Americans, memories of the massive fiscal stimulus provided in the last recession -- paired with historically-low interest rates -- might have tempered millennials\u2019 views of just how much the Fed can do for the economy.\n\n\u201cI do think that because of quantitative easing, and because of negative yields in the world, there has developed a sense that the Federal Reserve is spent,\u201d Paulsen said. If that\u2019s part of the American mindset, \u201cthen really what matters is just what the president\u2019s going to do.\u201d", "description": "On Economy, More Americans See President in Charge Than the Fed", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEE7L1A5_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
