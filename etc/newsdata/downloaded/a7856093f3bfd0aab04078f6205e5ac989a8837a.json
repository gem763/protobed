But he was also noticeably slowing down and breathing heavy at the end of the second round.\n\nBetween rounds, Hardy (5-1 MMA, 2-1 UFC) took a hit from an inhaler. Then he went out and finished the third, and was originally awarded a unanimous decision on scores of 30-27 across the board. That result, however, was reversed and later ruled a no contest by the Massachusetts State Athletic Commission because of Hardy\u2019s inhaler use.\n\n\u201cI was in the ring. Me and my coach asked the commission if it would be OK to use my inhaler, and they said yes, so I took it,\u201d Hardy said. \u201cI\u2019m still a new guy in this sport. I did what I do in every situation: I asked permission. I got permission, and I did what I was told.\u201d\n\nAccording to Yahoo! Sports\u2019 Kevin Iole, UFC president Dana White said use of the inhaler had been approved but that ultimately wasn\u2019t the case.\n\nHardy showed improved striking, footwork and pacing over the course of 15 minutes. He landed crisp jabs every time his smaller foe waded in, and he peppered Sosoli (7-2 MMA, 0-0 UFC) with kicks throughout the fight.\n\nSosoli, who unlike some of Hardy\u2019s previous foes, didn\u2019t look intimidated, landed occasional heavy hands but was never able to untrack any sustained offense.\n\nIt\u2019s the second controversial result for Hardy in the UFC. In his promotional debut back in January, Hardy was disqualified for throwing an illegal knee in a fight with Allen Crowder.\n\nGallery Greg Hardy def.
