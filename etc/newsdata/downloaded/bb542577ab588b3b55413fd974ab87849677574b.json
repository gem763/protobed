The Swedish Transportation Agency told the Associated Press that it does not accept applications for custom plates that refer to politics or that can be \u201cperceived as offensive.\u201d\n\nAccording to a Swedish tabloid, Marcus Saaf, who applied for the plate, said he \u201cwas drunk and thought it was fun to apply.\u201d He wanted Mr. Trump\u2019s name on his car because it is an American-made SUV with a gas-hungry V-8 engine.\n\nThe latest ruling comes less than a month after judges in a Stockholm court found American rapper A$AP Rocky guilty of assault, despite a very public campaign from Mr. Trump in favor of the performer.\n\nThroughout the trial, Mr. Trump shared critical messages on Twitter, made calls to the Swedish prime minister, and even dispatched the State Department\u2019s hostage-affairs envoy, Robert O\u2019Brien \u2014 who warned the trial could have \u201cnegative consequences\u201d for American-Swedish relations \u2014 to attend the trial.\n\nThe denial of the TRUMP plate met with some derision among Swedish Twitter users.\n\n\u201cWould it have been OK if it said \u2018OBAMA\u2019? Probably yes,\u201d one commenter tweeted.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
