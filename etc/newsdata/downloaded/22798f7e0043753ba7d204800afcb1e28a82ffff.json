I said no. We had a huge row, I went anyway.\n\n\"The next morning, David called and we had a row that made the previous day\u2019s row look like a light-hearted disagreement over what to have for lunch...\n\n(Image: Retna Ltd)\n\n(Image: Maxppp/PA Images)\n\n\"The kind of argument where you come off the phone teary and reeling, where things are said that make you wonder whether the next time you communicate it\u2019ll be through lawyers.\n\n\"In fact, the next time I heard from David, he had checked himself into a rehab clinic in Malibu. I was pleased he was getting treatment.\"\n\nThe singer added that after David finished treatment, he accompanied him to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.\n\nElton endured his own highly-publicised battle with drink and drugs at the height of his career.\n\nHe'd been sober for three years when he met David.\n\nThey entered into a civil partnership in 2005 and later wed in 2014.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
