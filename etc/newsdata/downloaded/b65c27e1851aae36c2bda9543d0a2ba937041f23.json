Walker, 27, was recaptured on October 2\n\nA Texas company removed a capital murder suspect's GPS ankle monitor last month due to unpaid fees.\n\nAccording to a letter written by Harris County District Attorney, Kim Ogg, the company in question, Guarding Public Safety, allowed a representative to remove Clint Walker's GPS monitor on September 19.\n\nWalker, 27, was unmonitored until he was recaptured on October 2.\n\nWalker is accused of fatally shooting 59-year-old Enrique Garcia in 2016 during a botched robbery of a game room. Garcia was the security guard on duty at the time.\n\nIn June, Walker was released on a $100,000 surety bond and required to wear a GPS ankle monitor as a condition of his release.\n\nAccording to Ogg's letter, which was sent to Teresa May, the Harris County Community Supervision & Corrections Department director, Walker was required to pay Guarding Public Safety a monthly fee.\n\nThat monthly fee ranged from about $280 to $300. However, Walker got behind on the dues and the company sent a representative to his home to remove the device.\n\nWalker would have started paying the monthly fee in July, which would have put him behind about three months in payments, equating to about $840 to $900.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nWalker (pictured in 2016 during robbery) is accused of fatally shooting 59-year-old Enrique Garcia in 2016 during a botched robbery of a game room\n\nGarcia was the security guard on duty at the time.
