Right now, her friends fear the prosecution wants to make an example out of her, not only for the crime she's been accused of, but her not guilty plea.\"\n\nIn April, the 55-year-old TV star and her husband, Mossimo Giannulli, pleaded not guilty to the charges they face for allegedly paying $500,000 in bribes to get their daughters, 19-year-old Olivia and 20-year-old Bella, admitted to the University of Southern California as recruits for the crew team, even though neither had ever participated in the sport.\n\nAs for Huffman, in May she pleaded guilty to mail fraud and honest services mail fraud after allegedly paying $15,000 to have a proctor fix SAT questions that her daughter, 19-year-old Sophia, incorrectly answered.\n\nET's source shares that, \"Lori has confided in friends that she has nightmares about what's to come and has been living with constant anxiety. Lori chose a very different path than Felicity and felt taking a deal was a mistake. She doesn't believe she deserves jail time.\"\n\n\"Lori and her husband worked hard this summer to hold their family together, but it's been very rough,\" the source added.\n\nLoughlin and Giannulli appeared together in court on Aug. 27, where the judge allowed them to share the same attorneys in their upcoming trial.\n\n\"I think, given the circumstances of what they're up against with the trial, it's probably the smartest strategy they have yet because jurors would have to believe both of them are lying,\" lawyer Rachel Stockman previously told ET.\n\nSince, reports have begun circulating that the controversy has set Loughlin and Giannulli on the road to divorce. However, a source told ET this is \"absolutely untrue.\"\n\nSee more on Loughlin in the clip below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nFelicity Huffman Sentenced to 14 Days in Prison and $30,000 Fine After College Admissions Scandal\n\nFelicity Huffman & Lori Loughlin-Inspired 'College Admissions Scandal' Gets First Trailer (Exclusive)\n\nLori Loughlin and Husband Hold Hands as They Make Court Appearance in Boston\n\nRelated Articles:", "description": "ET's source has the latest details on the 'Full House' alum's state of mind.", "authors": ["Scott Baumgartner"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/uwUnEak_g3WufLEU8mshpQ--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/0ae8c2c62a5d9ace104df51282746c89", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
