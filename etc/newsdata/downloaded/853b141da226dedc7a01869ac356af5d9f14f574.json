(AP) - The Arizona Coyotes liked the way they were playing at the start of the season, even if pucks weren\u2019t going into the net. They were playing solid defense, creating good chances, and figured the goals would come.\n\nNow that they\u2019re scoring in bunches and, for the most part, playing lockdown defense, the wins are piling up.\n\nConor Garland had a goal and an assist, Antti Raanta stopped 34 shots and the surging Coyotes outlasted the Ottawa Senators 5-2 on Saturday night.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been playing the way we wanted to play really since the start of the season,\u201d Garland said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get those first two games, but we played pretty good.\u201d\n\nThe Coyotes have allowed the fewest goals in the NHL this season and have revved up their offense since scoring one goal the first two games.\n\nKyle Capobianco had his first NHL goal and Oliver Ekman-Larsson also scored in the first period. Carl Soderberg added a goal in the third period and Lawson Crouse had an empty-netter for Arizona, which has 20 goals during a five-game points streak.\n\nThe Coyotes had some defensive lapses in the third period, but Raanta stopped 19 shots for his first win since last Nov. 2 against Carolina.\n\n\u201cWhen you haven\u2019t played in 11 months, it doesn\u2019t really matter what kind of game it is,\u201d said Raanta, who was injured most of last season. \u201cYou\u2019re just happy to be back and playing, just enjoying the game.\u201d\n\nThe Senators made a late push, pulling within two goals after Vladislav Namestnikov and Chris Tierney scored in the third period. Craig Anderson stopped 23 shots.\n\n\u201cThey outplayed in the first period, didn\u2019t give us anything, we made some major mistakes that end up in the net, and then you\u2019re playing catch-up hockey the rest of the way, which is tough,\u201d Ottawa coach D.J. Smith said. \u201cThe second and third period, I really liked our effort.\u201d\n\nThe Senators earned a point in Thursday\u2019s 3-2 shootout loss to Vegas, but were shaky defensively, allowing the Golden Knights to pepper Andres Nilsson with 54 shots.\n\nOttawa as didn\u2019t give up as many shots against Arizona, but more found the back of the net.\n\nCapobianco scored his first NHL goal midway through the first period on a shot from near the blue line that hit Senators center Namestnikov\u2019s stick and caromed past Anderson.\n\nEkman-Larsson scored 81 seconds later on a rebound after a shot by Clayton Keller bobbled across the crease.\n\nGarland made it 3-0 midway through the second period, wristing in a rebound after a shot by Brad Richardson caromed out to the left faceoff dot.\n\nSoderberg opened the third period with a power-play goal on a shot from the slot, but Namestnikov answered with a short-handed goal on a breakaway.\n\nTierney cut Arizona\u2019s lead to 4-2 with a power-play goal, one-timing a pass from Thomas Chabot in the slot. The Senators continued to push, but Raanta made some difficult saves and Crouse closed it out with his first goal of the season.\n\n\u201cWe knew they were going to come out hard early and we didn\u2019t match their compete level,\u201d said Tierney, who has two goals this season. \u201cThey dominated, got the lead and it ended up being too much for us.\u201d\n\nNotes: Arizona recalled D Aaron Ness from Tucson of AHL affiliate and placed D Jordan Oesterle on the injured reserve list after he was hit on the head by a puck on Thursday. \u2026 Ottawa C Artem Anisimov missed his third straight game with a lower-body injury. \u2026 Arizona honored RW Phil Kessel before the game for playing career game No. 1,000 on Thursday.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nOttawa plays at Dallas on Monday.\n\nArizona opens a four-game road trip against the New York Rangers on Tuesday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Arizona Coyotes liked the way they were playing at the start of the season, even if pucks weren't going into the net.
