Getty Images\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to keep being like that with Dave and Dave like that with me. Dave is 67 and he wants to improve every day and that is why he was my guy for so long. He was great for me and I am sure I pushed him on as well.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I want to change too much of me, I want to keep the fire. Around the Open I was changing my emotions inside and that was affecting the way I played.\n\n\u201cI hope I don\u2019t have to make any decisions ever like that again, but it\u2019s a business and it\u2019s what everyone keeps telling me. There are plenty of guys out here who sacked many a caddie and this is my first one. I wouldn\u2019t say it was a sacking, it was a parting of ways.\n\n\u201cSometimes you need to make those hard decisions to go forward. I felt like it was the right one and it is producing some good stuff at the moment.\u201d\n\nStenson\u2019s 66 equalled his lowest score at Wentworth from 2001 and was completed in style with an eagle on the last, despite his putt from off the green hopping into the air from a pitchmark.\n\n\u201cI have always found this quite a tricky golf course with the dog-legs and little humps, it\u2019s not easy to keep hitting fairways and with the trees on both sides it gives you a little claustrophobic feel at times,\u201d Stenson said.\n\n\u201cLooking back at my career, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had too many wins with a decent round. It sets up the week nicely and I just hope I can continue with that.\u201d\n\nRose\u2019s participation had been in doubt after he injured his left knee in a slip at home, but the world number four birdied four of his last eight holes to card an opening 67.\n\n\u201cOn Monday I went for a scan and I didn\u2019t know if I had torn my meniscus or ACL,\u201d Rose said. \u201cBut there\u2019s no ligament damage, it\u2019s just a strain and some bruising so I feel quite lucky.\u201d\n\nMcIlroy no doubt did not feel so fortunate after squandering a flying start \u2013 he eagled the fourth and birdied the fifth \u2013 with a terrible finish, the world number two playing his last 11 holes in seven over par.\n\nAfter three dropped shots in a row from the eighth, McIlroy stopped the rot with a birdie on the par-five 12th but then bogeyed the 13th and 15th and ran up a double-bogey seven on the 17th after pulling his drive out of bounds.\n\nAnother wild drive followed on the last and led to a closing bogey, after which McIlroy declined to talk to waiting reporters.", "description": "Matt Wallace believes his decision to part company with caddie Dave McNeilly is paying dividends after claiming the lead in the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth.
