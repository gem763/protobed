And leading pollster Sir John Curtice said that opposition parties did not have to win the election to be in a position to block Brexit, but simply take enough seats to deny the Tories a majority.\n\nMr Johnson believes the Tory surge since his election as leader in July has put him on the verge of securing the dominance of the Commons that he wants in order to deliver his Brexit deal early in 2020 and embark on the lengthy and controversial process of negotiating a new relationship with the remaining 27 EU states.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It is our best chance to elect a government to stop Brexit.\n\n\u201cThe Liberal Democrats are the strongest party of Remain and will be standing on a manifesto to stop Brexit by revoking Article 50.\n\n\u201cThis country deserves better than Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, and I am excited to take our positive, pro-European, liberal vision to the country as the Liberal Democrat candidate for prime minister.\u201d\n\nBut Mr Corbyn made clear he will put reversing austerity \u2013 and not Brexit \u2013 at the heart of Labour\u2019s campaign.\n\nThe election was \u201ca once-in-a-generation chance to transform our country\u201d, said the Labour leader.\n\n\u201cThe choice at this election could not be clearer,\u201d he said. \u201cA Labour government will be on your side, while Boris Johnson\u2019s Conservatives \u2013 who think they\u2019re born to rule \u2013 will only look after the privileged few.\n\n\u201cWe will now launch the most ambitious and radical campaign for real change that our country has ever seen. This is our chance to build a country for the many not the few and fit for the next generation.\u201d\n\nTory aides said Mr Johnson aims to use a majority in the Commons to ratify his Brexit deal early in the new year, allowing the UK to leave the EU at 11pm on 31 January under the terms of the latest extension offered by Brussels earlier this week.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after addressing Tory MPs in Westminster, Mr Johnson said: \u201cI think it\u2019s time for the country to come together, get Brexit done and go forward.\u201d\n\nBut asked if he believes he can secure a majority, he said: \u201cIt\u2019ll be a tough election and we are going to do the best we can.\u201d\n\nFormer cabinet minister John Whittingdale said the prime minister told the meeting his decision to go for an election \u201cwasn\u2019t because we were ahead in the polls or because of the horror of Corbyn but because we had no alternative: that parliament is deadlocked\u201d.\n\nBut Sir John Curtice, of the University of Strathclyde, said that the result would probably deliver a record number of MPs from outside the two major parties, making the balance of power in the new parliament difficult to call.\n\nWith both the SNP and Lib Dems expected to improve significantly on their current tally of seats, there could be \u201cmore than 100 MPs that do not belong to either of the other two parties\u201d, said Sir John.\n\nAnd he added: \u201cBear in mind, this is not an election that Labour have to win to stop Brexit, but it is an election that they and the other opposition parties simply need to deny the Conservatives a majority.\u201d\n\nMPs voiced concern that staging the election in the potentially cold, wet and dark conditions of December for the first time since 1923 could depress turnout, particularly among students, the elderly and people with a disability. But MPs voted down a Labour bid to bring polling day forward three days to 9 December.\n\nPro-referendum Labour MP Peter Kyle told The Independent the election would be \u201ca referendum in all but name\u201d but said it was \u201cfantasy\u201d to believe it would resolve Brexit.\n\n\u201cI would say right now, at the outset, that this election is more likely to deliver a referendum, once another parliament with no overall control and with a more divisive and divided intake results,\u201d said Mr Kyle, who voted against an election as it was \u201csecond best\u201d to a Final Say vote on Brexit.\n\n\u201cUltimately, it is the British public that will decide this, and I suspect they would rather we had got together to find a way through the Brexit challenge than asking them to do it for us.\u201d\n\nPlaid Cymru\u2019s leader in Westminster, Liz Saville-Roberts, said she would like pro-Remain parties to \u201cfind a way of realising their voice\u201d during the election, as the Welsh nationalists did when they reached an electoral agreement with the Lib Dems and Greens in the recent Brecon by-election.\n\n\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t come about that politicians can put aside party-political interests, then there is something more than the structure of Westminster at fault in the politics of the UK,\u201d she told Sky News.\n\nRichard Tice, chair of the Brexit Party, said it was still ready to join the Tories in a \u201cLeave alliance\u201d, which he predicted could deliver a landslide victory, but made clear the price of a pact would be a no-deal Brexit.\n\nSteve Baker, chair of the European Research Group of Eurosceptic Tories, said a deal \u201cwon\u2019t happen\u201d on this basis, telling the New Statesman: \u201cBoris will have to win without any arrangement.\u201d\n\nGavin Barwell, the former chief of staff to Theresa May, said: \u201cFor two and a half years politicians have gambled that if they refuse to compromise on Brexit they might get the outcome they want.\n\n\u201cNow they\u2019re all gambling on an election giving them the outcome they want. We\u2019ll find out in a few weeks which ones have miscalculated.\u201d", "description": "Britain is heading towards a historic pre-Christmas general election, which could decide whether the UK leaves the European Union in 2020 or if Brexit can be stopped. MPs voted by 438 to 20 to approve the UK\u2019s first December ballot in almost a century, after Labour dramatically abandoned its resistance to the election sought by Boris Johnson and joined the Liberal Democrats", "authors": ["Andrew Woodcock", "Lizzy Buchan"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/29/19/front-corbyn-johnson-parliament-black-line.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
