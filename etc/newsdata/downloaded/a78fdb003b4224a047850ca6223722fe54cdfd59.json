HS2 (High Speed 2) is a plan to construct a a new high-speed rail linking London, West Midlands, Leeds and Manchester. The line is to be built in a 'Y' configuration. London will be on the bottom of the 'Y', Birmingham at the centre, Leeds at the top right and Manchester at the top left. Work on Phase One began in 2017 and the government plans envisage the line being operational by 2026. The HS2 project is being developed by High Speed Two (HS2) Ltd. The project has a projected cost of \u00a356 billion ($77 billion), up from the initial cost of \u00a332.7 billion ($45 billion) in 2010. Last year's annual report showed that the company established by the government to build the railway spent \u00a3500 million in the year to March 31 - up almost 30 per cent from \u00a3352.9 million the year before. It takes the total amount spent by HS2 so far to more than \u00a31.9billion since 2009. Separate accounts published by the Department for Transport also showed it had spent another \u00a3366 million on HS2. The bulk of this was on compensating individuals and businesses who own property and land near the planned line.\n\n'We want to make sure that is all possible,' he said.\n\nA new franchise known as the West Coast Partnership will be responsible for designing and running the initial high-speed services when phase one opens between London and Birmingham in 2026.\n\nThe railway will then be extended to Crewe, Manchester and Leeds.\n\nThe high-speed trains will also run beyond the new lines on existing tracks as far north as Edinburgh and Glasgow.\n\nIn September it was revealed that the estimated cost of buying land on the HS2 route has tripled in just six years to more than \u00a33 billion,\n\nIn 2012, the company building the high-speed line from London to Birmingham estimated it would cost \u00a31.1 billion to buy land and properties along the route.\n\nBut by July this year, HS2 Ltd believed the total would be \u00a33.3 billion \u2013 and the National Audit Office said the cost could soar yet further.\n\nThe entire project is expected to cost \u00a356 billion. HS2 Ltd was also criticised for delays in giving residents the compensation they are due after land is compulsorily purchased.", "description": "Ilford-based company Bombardier Transportation is developing technology which would enable click-and-collect services on board.", "authors": ["Press Association", "Phoebe Weston For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/11/27/00/wire-6676820-1543276948-820_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2018-11-27"}
