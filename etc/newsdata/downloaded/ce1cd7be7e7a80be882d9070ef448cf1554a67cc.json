At least seven civilians and one Kurdish fighter were reportedly killed during the attacks.\n\nIn response to the strikes, Trump denounced Turkey\u2019s offensive and said that the U.S. \u201cdoes not endorse this attack and has made it clear to Turkey that this operation is a bad idea.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, he threatened to \u201ctotally destroy and obliterate\u201d Turkey\u2019s economy if the country took any action that was \u201coff limits.\u201d\n\nAs I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I\u2019ve done before!).
