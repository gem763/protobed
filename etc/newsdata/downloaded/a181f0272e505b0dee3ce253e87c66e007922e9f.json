The move to electric vehicles will be expensive, but will probably be led by traditional manufacturers.\"\n\nVolkswagen is leveraging its large infrastructure of suppliers, factories and workers, long a handicap to its profitability, more aggressively than rivals BMW, Renault SA, General Motors Co and Tesla, which were all quicker to sell a custom-designed electric car.\n\nRather than adjusting production gradually, and using multi-powertrain platforms, Volkswagen is making an enormous bet on a dedicated electric vehicle architecture, known as MEB, in the hope of increasing economies of scale sufficiently to push down the price of electric cars to approximately 20,000 euros ($22,262).\n\nThe company is retooling eight plants across the globe by 2022 to specialise in manufacturing electric cars, and license its electric MEB platform to rivals, senior Volkswagen executives told Reuters, putting it on track to become the world's largest maker of zero-emission vehicles.\n\nOne of these rivals is Ford Motor Co. A partnership with the company will give Volkswagen $10bn in revenue over the next six years.\n\nThomas Ulbrich, Volkswagen's board member who oversees production of electric vehicles, told Reuters, \"Ford and Volkswagen's agreement will be a blueprint for further licensing deals.\"\n\nTo futher fund its electrification shift, Volkswagen aims to increase sales of its combustion-engine sport utility vehicles (SUVs) to 40 percent of overall sales by 2020, up from 23 percent in 2018.\n\nIt is also increasing economies of scale by rolling out electric vehicle platforms to its Audi, Skoda, Seat and Porsche brands.\n\n\"The first MEB-based vehicle is an SUV model,\" Volkswagen said about its China push.\n\nVolkswagen can rely on the existing workers and facilities it has in China to increase production of electric vehicles [File: Third party via Reuters]\n\nIn the short term, Volkswagen and its Chinese joint venture partners will invest 15 billion euros ($16.6bn) to produce 15 different electric cars for China alone by 2025.\n\nThe group said that it will be in a position to build 22 million electric cars by 2028, of which 11.6 million could come out of Chinese factories.\n\nTaking on Tesla\n\nTesla has emerged as a serious competitor with a credible car, its Model 3, Volkswagen Chief Executive Herbert Diess told Reuters last week. But startups have a hard time entering mass production without sufficient production facilities, he said.\n\n\"The question is, can you expand your production quickly enough? The capital intensity is increasing,\" Diess said.\n\nToday, Tesla's cars are generally perceived as cutting-edge and potentially more sophisticated than Volkswagen's. Volkswagen's ID.3, which starts production this year, has an operating range of between 330 and 550 kilometres (205 to 341 miles), below the 560km (348-mile) long-range Model 3 version offered by Tesla.\n\nThat is because Tesla has a sophisticated software algorithm to control how much electricity goes to the electric motor, air conditioning, seat heaters, in-car infotainment, and cooling system.\n\nVolkswagen's edge is more blunt: price and significant economies of scale.\n\nThe ID.3 has a starting price of under 30,000 euros ($33,363) in Germany. By contrast, Tesla's Model 3 had an average selling price of $50,000 in the second quarter. The long-range version retails for 52,390 euros ($58,056) in Germany.\n\nThe Volkswagen vehicle's lower price comes from the carmaker's ability to place large orders for parts which, by nature of their size, help drive down the final price of their cars. Volkswagen is investing 50 billion euros ($55.5bn) to buy battery cells and will also license its MEB electric car platform to rival carmakers to further increase economies of scale.", "description": "The German carmaker says it is on track to becoming the world's largest producer of zero-emission vehicles by 2025.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/8/20/5b8aefee580a4bc1a007d6d0e4648446_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
