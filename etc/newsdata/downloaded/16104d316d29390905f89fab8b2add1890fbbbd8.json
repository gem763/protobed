Twenty-three lines of his Historia, the ancient world\u2019s first great narrative history, are devoted to the intricate description of the construction of a \u201cbaris\u201d.\n\nFor centuries, scholars have argued over his account because there was no archaeological evidence that such ships ever existed. Now there is. A \u201cfabulously preserved\u201d wreck in the waters around the sunken port city of Thonis-Heracleion has revealed just how accurate the historian was.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until we discovered this wreck that we realised Herodotus was right,\u201d said Dr Damian Robinson, director of Oxford University\u2019s centre for maritime archaeology, which is publishing the excavation\u2019s findings. \u201cWhat Herodotus described was what we were looking at.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An artistic treatment of the discovered shipwreck.

He noted how the builders \u201ccut planks two cubits long [around 100cm] and arrange them like bricks\u201d. He added: \u201cOn the strong and long tenons [pieces of wood] they insert two-cubit planks. When they have built their ship in this way, they stretch beams over them\u2026 They obturate the seams from within with papyrus. There is one rudder, passing through a hole in the keel. The mast is of acacia and the sails of papyrus...\u201d\n\nRobinson said that previous scholars had \u201cmade some mistakes\u201d in struggling to interpret the text without archaeological evidence. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those enigmatic pieces. Scholars have argued exactly what it means for as long as we\u2019ve been thinking of boats in this scholarly way,\u201d he said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bust of Herodotus of Halicarnassus (c484-425 BC) Photograph: G Nimatallah/De Agostini/Getty Images\n\nBut the excavation of what has been called Ship 17 has revealed a vast crescent-shaped hull and a previously undocumented type of construction involving thick planks assembled with tenons \u2013 just as Herodotus observed, in describing a slightly smaller vessel.\n\nOriginally measuring up to 28 metres long, it is one of the first large-scale ancient Egyptian trading boats ever to have been discovered.\n\nRobinson added: \u201cHerodotus describes the boats as having long internal ribs. Nobody really knew what that meant\u2026 That structure\u2019s never been seen archaeologically before. Then we discovered this form of construction on this particular boat and it absolutely is what Herodotus has been saying.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The wooden hull of ship 17. Photograph: Christoph Gerigk/Franck Goddio/Hilti Foundation\n\nAbout 70% of the hull has survived, well-preserved in the Nile silts. Acacia planks were held together with long tenon-ribs \u2013 some almost 2m long \u2013 and fastened with pegs, creating lines of \u2018internal ribs\u2019 within the hull. It was steered using an axial rudder with two circular openings for the steering oar and a step for a mast towards the centre of the vessel.\n\nRobinson said: \u201cWhere planks are joined together to form the hull, they are usually joined by mortice and tenon joints which fasten one plank to the next. Here we have a completely unique form of construction, which is not seen anywhere else.\u201d\n\nAlexander Belov, whose book on the wreck, Ship 17: a Baris from Thonis-Heracleion, is published this month, suggests that the wreck\u2019s nautical architecture is so close to Herodotus\u2019s description, it could have been made in the very shipyard that he visited. Word-by-word analysis of his text demonstrates that almost every detail corresponds \u201cexactly to the evidence\u201d.\n\nShip 17 is the 17th of more than 70 vessels dating from the 8th to the 2nd century BC, discovered by Franck Goddio and a team \u2013 including Belov - from the European Institute for Underwater Archaeology during excavations in Aboukir bay, with which the Oxford Centre is involved.", "description": "Greek historian\u2019s description of \u2018baris\u2019 vessel vindicated by archaeologists at sunken city of Thonis-Heraclion", "authors": ["Dalya Alberge"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9522c358b4bb4c154bedec572676a3d231dffef6/0_228_7113_4267/master/7113.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1dbb2a9afb3d45fd27408dd26c3018e3", "published_at": "2019-03-17"}
