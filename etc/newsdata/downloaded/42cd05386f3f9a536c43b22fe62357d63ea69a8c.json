He is anything but a political hack, as the president claims. I do not know ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, whom Trump earlier ousted as ambassador to Ukraine, but I do know that she is a respected, experienced and capable American diplomat. Taylor and Yovanovitch understand vastly more about U.S. diplomacy and national security than this president, who appears to know much more about stiff hairspray options than foreign policy.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThese attacks on professional career members of the federal government are an outrage and a real threat to rule of law in the nation. These professionals have shown the courage to see wrongdoing and expose it. They raised their concerns inside the government without effect and then reported them through a legal process of congressional testimony and whistleblower reports. Those accused of improper behavior hate credible whistleblowers; those who oppose corruption and mismanagement in government see great value in them.\n\nThe president\u2019s personal attack on a career professional falls in line with the wacky right-wing theory \u2014 again without evidence \u2014 that a \"deep state\" opposition to Trump exists among career federal employees.\n\nCareer government employees are restricted by law and regulation in the participation in many political activities. Like every American, they have personal political views, but a career civil service employee will destroy his or her career if he or she becomes an active political zealot for one political party at the expense of responsibilities to support the legal policies of the elected officials. Can an individual employee go politically rogue? Sure, but a broad conspiracy against the president is a fantasy. Unfortunately, many Americans believe the conspiracy nonsense being promoted by Republicans in Congress, right-wing television and radio pundits, and Russian internet trolls.\n\nCareer federal employees are sworn to uphold the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. They are responsible for implementing the legal policies of the political authorities elected or appointed over them. When they cannot support the policies of those above them, they have institutional means to raise their objections within their chain of supervision or as a whistleblower. They also can resign from government in protest and go public, as many experienced professionals have done.\n\nIn the case of Taylor, he made his objections well known in a cable to the secretary of State and to others involved in Ukraine policy within the government.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrump\u2019s frantic concern with the ongoing impeachment inquiry caused him to appeal to Republicans to \u201cget tough and fight.\u201d Shortly thereafter, two dozen Republican members of Congress stormed the secure impeachment investigation hearing room to disrupt the procedures. They should have been wearing jack boots in their tawdry stunt to block what is essentially a grand jury hearing with Republicans present to participate. The hearing procedure is established in precedent and procedure \u2014 approved, and used, by the former Republican House majority.\n\nAllies of the president criticize process and attack witnesses \u2014 without evidence \u2014 to refute what is being revealed in public by the written testimony and transcripts.\n\nTrump apparently developed his tactics of deny, deceive, deflect and attack at the knee of his legal mentor, notorious New York attorney Roy Cohn. \u201cWhere\u2019s my Roy Cohn?\u201d Trump famously asked after Jeff Sessions Jefferson (Jeff) Beauregard SessionsSanctuary city policies are a threat to decent people Trump attacks Sessions: A 'total disaster' and 'an embarrassment to the great state of Alabama' Ocasio-Cortez fires back at Washington Times after story on her 'high-dollar hairdo' MORE recused himself from the Russia probe, according to The New York Times. Cohn is famous as chief counsel to former Sen. Joseph McCarthy (R-Wis.) during the red-baiting Army-McCarthy hearings in 1954. After McCarthy was discredited, Cohn became a lawyer in Manhattan known for his aggressive intimidation of opponents. For Trump, Cohn was a lawyer and adviser. Cohn was disbarred by the New York Supreme Court for unethical behavior and died of AIDS in 1986.\n\nWith Cohn in the grave, Trump turned to Rudy Giuliani Rudy GiulianiSenate Dems: Barr must recuse himself from Ukraine, Russia probe investigation White House official to corroborate diplomat's version of Ukraine events: report Giuliani accidentally calls reporter, leaves voicemail about needing 'a few hundred thousand' dollars MORE to help with his Washington adventures.\n\nNow that Trump has severely damaged American leadership in the world with his unilateralist and incoherent foreign and national security policy, he is moving to destroy public confidence in the civil service. Putin and other enemies of the United States must be ecstatic with the chaos created by Trump\u2019s frantic domestic fury.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe desperate attacks by an increasingly unstable president to stop investigations into his potential abuse of power and illegal activities will continue and probably increase.\n\nThe one thing Trump has not been able to stop is the credible information provided to investigators by courageous career professionals who saw wrongdoing and reported it. In doing so, these professionals are placing their oath to the Constitution and the rule of law in the United States above some shallow personal loyalty to a flawed president.\n\nTaylor and others like him who see abuse and expose what they see within the existing federal laws and procedures are American heroes.
