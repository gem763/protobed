It cannot possibly work.\n\nAnother Look at NAFTA\n\nOne of my readers proposed that problems US balance of trade issues started with NAFTA. Wrong!\n\nPlease consider Disputing Trump\u2019s NAFTA \u201cCatastrophe\u201d with Pictures: What\u2019s the True Source of Trade Imbalances?\n\nExplaining Balance of Trade\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump's Mission Impossible\n\nIt is impossible for tariffs to fix problems caused by making the dollar the world's reserve currency then removing the last constraints on global deficit spending!\n\nIf you support Trump's tariffs as some sort of cure to trade imbalances, please read the above sentence over and over again until it finally sinks in that Trump is on a foolish path.\n\nHistoric Balance of Trade\n\nFrom 1866 to 1968 the US generally had a trade surplus.\n\nThe US had huge trade surpluses during and just after WWI and WWII.\n\nWhy?\n\nThe productive output of Europe was destroyed. US production was not harmed in either war.\n\nAlthough no US production was destroyed in the Korean War or the War in Vietnam, in both cases US production was diverted from productive uses to asinine uses, especially true for the Vietnam war.\n\nOther nations were not stupid enough to get involved in a significant way, if at all.\n\nChinese Imports\n\nTut tut some may say. Harsh words indeed.\n\nTheir argument is that Nixon established trade relations with China in 1972.\n\nOK, let's take a look.\n\nThe US current account stared sinking well before NAFTA.\n\nSo, what is the cause?\n\nNo Enforcement Mechanism\n\nGold provided an enforcement mechanism against mercantilism, massive deficit spending, and huge government subsidies.\n\nStarting August 15, 1971, when Nixon closed the gold window, there has been no enforcement mechanism.\n\nThat's a problem that tariffs cannot possibly cure.\n\nWhy the Delayed Response to Nixon?\n\nNixon said it was \"temporary\".\n\nGuess what? It wasn't.\n\nTariffs cannot possibly fix this issue.\n\nTariffs can only make matters worse by increasing costs on consumers and industries.\n\nTrump is barking up the wrong tree, and loudly.", "description": "Trump wants to cure trade imbalances via tariffs.
