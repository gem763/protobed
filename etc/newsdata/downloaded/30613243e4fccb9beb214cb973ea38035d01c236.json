I don\u2019t think anybody could understand that, but in all fairness I had no idea, which probably sounds difficult to understand \u2026 but when I first met my now-husband my friends were really happy because I was so happy, but my British friends said to me, \u2018\u201dI\u2019m sure he\u2019s great but you shouldn\u2019t do it because the British tabloids will destroy your life\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeghan, 38, said that, as an American, she \u2018very naively\u2019 thought this did not make any sense, adding: \u2018I\u2019m not in tabloids. I didn\u2019t get it, so it\u2019s been complicated.\u2019\n\nWendy isn\u2019t Meghan\u2019s biggest fan (Picture: Getty \u2013 Splash)\n\nWhile the Duchess received a lot of sympathy for opening up about her experience, Wendy was not on her side.\n\nThe US TV star ripped into Meghan on Tuesday\u2019s edition of The Wendy Williams Show, suggesting that she was lying about her friends warning her off Prince Harry \u2018for us to give her sympathy\u2019.\n\nThe 55-year-old said: \u2018You knew exactly what you were doing. And I applaud her plot-ation on the royal situation. But please, don\u2019t try to garner sympathy from us. You knew what you were doing.\u2019\n\nWendy then suggested that as Harry and Meghan won\u2019t be King and Queen, they should move to the US and split their time between the States, England and \u2018a hut in Africa\u2019.\n\nMeghan shared her struggles on the ITV documentary (Picture: ITV)\n\nShe continued: \u2018I like them, I really do like them, but her? There\u2019s something about her. You know what I\u2019m saying?\n\n\u2018Meghan, don\u2019t be surprised that the paparazzi are everywhere, of course, because you\u2019re now a royal. They weren\u2019t following you when you were on Suits \u2013 we didn\u2019t even know who you were, except when you came for employment here at Wendy, and wanted to be one of our runway models.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWendy\u2019s producer Suzanne explained that Meghan had called up and proposed that she feature as a \u2018fashion expert and do the runway\u2019 \u2013 however, she added: \u2018They thought she\u2019d be perfect to do it. But by the time we decided to book her, she was already engaged.\u2019\n\nWilliams said: \u2018Here\u2019s the thing. Every celebrity has their own relationship with the paparazzi. Yesterday, the paparazzi was outside this studio, waiting for me.\u2019\n\nThe mother-of-one said that she \u2018understands the job\u2019 the paparazzi have to do \u2013 before saying: \u2018But Meghan Markle, nobody feels sorry for you, you knew what you were signing up for, girl.\u2019\n\nMeghan, who welcomed son Archie Harrison in May, shared on the ITV documentary with ITV\u2019s Tom Bradby that \u2018it had really been a struggle\u2019 dealing with being a new mum in the spotlight.\n\nAppearing close to tears, she thanked Bradby for asking how she\u2019s coping, saying: \u2018Not many people have asked if I\u2019m OK\u2019.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
