Photo: Harvard Art Museums; \u00a9 President and Fellows of Harvard College.)\n\nAn excellent Fogg Museum show tells us media bias isn't recent.\n\nWinslow Homer: Eyewitness is the new show at the Fogg Museum in Cambridge, Mass., on the campus of Harvard. Homer (1836\u20131910) always keeps giving, and this is one measure of his greatness. On the one hand, he\u2019s rooted in tradition. He\u2019s a Hudson River School artist in his focus on landscape and seascape, though the show makes clear that he\u2019s a formidable figure painter, too. On the other, he\u2019s not only modern but also fresh and responsive to our times. The show serves nicely as a Homer primer, among its fascinating areas of focus.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis show is about the news business in the 1860s in America and the way it molded Homer\u2019s style. Americans have always been news-obsessed. Even in the 1840s and 1850s, our mostly frontier country had thousands of newspapers. Then, technology changed the news business constantly, and that continues today. And as the show deftly notes, fake news was not an occasional problem so much as an inherent vice.\n\nWhenever you look at art by Homer, it\u2019s worth remembering that he became famous as a newspaper and magazine illustrator from the late 1850s through the 1870s. He was a star illustrator of the two marquee news magazines, Harper\u2019s Weekly and Harper\u2019s Monthly, before the technology of mass producing a photograph was developed. And what made him more famous is his coverage of the biggest news story in America: the Civil War.\n\nThe show is a good balance of illustrations, watercolors, paintings, and photographs, and they\u2019re not only separate media but reinforcing ones. News from the War, a Homer illustration that appeared in June 1862, is one of the early works in the show. Yes, Homer was covering a grisly war, but the eternally narcissistic news business \u2014 reporters like nothing more than a story about themselves \u2014 could take time to celebrate its own acumen in getting good stories from the battlefield to the hearth.\n\nHomer is a designer of genius. It\u2019s seven vignettes, so it\u2019s complicated. He organizes it through effective black and white contrasts and a cunning talent for using passages of symmetry and asymmetry to keep things both lively and moving in a coherent way. News comes by letter, bugle, word of mouth, the new technology of railroads, and, emphatically, via the gutsy reporter, who happens to be Homer himself.\n\nThe reality is that reporters rarely got close to battle. They were as aggressively spun and massaged then as now by generals and politicians. Homer was no exception. Sitting on an empty barrel, though, the sketching Homer suggests that he was indeed a witness. As the public\u2019s eyes and ears, he felt the sadness and enthusiasm of the war and was uniquely positioned to convey it. Newspaper wars in the 1860s were fierce, with major outlets such as Harper\u2019s claiming that competitors published fake news \u2014 not only false news but news they invented \u2014 as opposed to Homer\u2019s on-the-spot observation and drawing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRebels outside Their Works, also from 1862, goes a step further. Set in Yorktown, Homer\u2019s illustration depicts Confederate soldiers prowling the front line at night, for both sharpshooting and spying. Homer excelled at heart-pumping drama. As the war reporter, he\u2019s shining a light on what\u2019s happening at the front as much as Confederates were using torches to gather an information advantage. He creates a documentary sense of \u201cyou are there.\u201d That\u2019s what every good reporter does.\n\nHomer is at his most effective and most modern as a story-telling minimalist. He\u2019s a great designer and organizer of groups, but his best illustrations are the simplest. Sometimes his minimalism was required. Most of the media turf wars occurred over word counts and column inches. Good stories could be told with brevity. Our Watering Places \u2014 The Empty Sleeve at Newport appeared in Harper\u2019s Weekly in August 1865. The war had ended a few months before. The work illustrated a story about a young soldier who came back from the war to discover that in his absence his wife had learned to drive a buggy. It\u2019s a sweet tale of women\u2019s liberation.\n\nLooking at the illustration, though, one can quickly see that it oozes with anxiety. The brightest white is the woman\u2019s face. That\u2019s where the viewer goes because it\u2019s so bright. Her expression tells us she\u2019s determined but terrified, and her grip on the taut reins underscores the point. Her husband\u2019s face is sunken. Both faces are partially shaded, telling us that some things are ambiguous or unseen. Then we focus on the empty sleeve. He\u2019s come back disfigured, an amputee. Homer is at his best in conveying a big, universal story, filled with pathos, through the smallest detail or nuance. This couple has a lot more to get used to than the wife having learned to drive a buggy.\n\nThe scene is set in Newport, even then a glittering summer-vacation spot. It might surprise that he did so many scenes of everyday women\u2019s lives since Homer was among the most alpha of male artists. He loved to fish and hunt, never married, and lived mostly in the company of rich men, but given these things, he was a canny interpreter of bourgeois leisure, and that includes women\u2019s clothing and women\u2019s activities. Harper\u2019s wasn\u2019t only a news periodical. It was a lifestyle publication, too. On the one hand, this couple seeks the normalcy of a Newport vacation, the first since the shooting stopped. On the other, for them, nothing will be normal again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe art in the show is almost entirely from the Fogg\u2019s collection. Homer is one of those rare artists who almost never had a bad day, so everything is good. If I had to name its biggest stars, though, I\u2019d have to pick the six Homer watercolors from the Fogg\u2019s Grenville Winthrop collection. Winthrop was one of New York\u2019s greatest collectors. When he died in 1843, his collection came to the Fogg. The gift came with so many restrictions that these works, great American and European things, almost never leave the Fogg.\n\nThe Winthrop Homer watercolors are gorgeous. They\u2019re joined by five other Homer watercolors, and these are rarely seen as well. Homer started making watercolors in 1873, inspired by their on-the-spot immediacy. By the mid 1860s, he was painting in oil, but watercolor allowed him to develop his knack for showing the single, ephemeral moment for aesthetic goals rather than a newspaper\u2019s goal to report the stories of the day.\n\nAll the watercolors in the show are from the 1880s and 1890s. His palette is so various, with citrus colors used for his Caribbean scenes to dull grays, greens, and blues of his wild Maine and Adirondack pictures. Canoe in Rapids, from 1897, is Homer at his essentialist best. The rough forest landscape, cold gray sky, and roiled water is a triumph of efficiency and directness, each element of nature reduced to essential qualities. It\u2019s beautiful but far from pretty. In most of his watercolors, he shows a hard, rough world. Even when he peoples them, the figures are subordinated to a natural world that\u2019s timeless, vast, and uncontrollable. Nature\u2019s rarely decorative.\n\nThe show is worth seeing for two of the Winthrop watercolors. Schooner at Sunset and Sailboat and Fourth of July Fireworks are both from 1880, a year Homer painted sunset and nocturne watercolors, mostly in Gloucester, Mass. I\u2019ve seen these two a few times over the years, only because I lived near Harvard when I was a museum director in Andover. They\u2019re so exquisite, so sublime, packing a big punch in a small package. I think of them like a dog thinks of food, which is a lot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy are they in a show about Homer in the news? For very smart, subtle reasons. The heart, and art, of the news business is chasing and capturing instants in time. The things that change are the things we read a newspaper to learn. It\u2019s why we check our news sites a dozen times a day. Fireworks are ephemeral, though the bangs and lights are big. Even a sunset changes from second to second, and we know a great sunset starts slowly, evolves, but then the sun drops like a stone.\n\nThere are only three or four oil paintings in the show. The most famous and one of only two loans is Prisoners at the Front, from 1866. At that point, Homer was starting to paint big studio oils and moving into the high-art world. This painting has the feel of a newspaper illustration, which isn\u2019t a slight. Its figures are clearly defined. Its design is close to a frieze, and that\u2019s part of his newspaper vocabulary. Illustrations in newspapers and magazines usually don\u2019t have much depth. Depth and recession are distractions. Newspaper illustration, then news photography around 1900, and, now, TV-news camerawork often present complex images, but they\u2019re never too far from the direct look of billboards. The reporter has to snag the viewer, and one way to do it is privileging the surface.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to read in another respect. Homer presents us with three Southern types: the reckless, arrogant Confederate cavalier, a Johnny Depp or James Dean type; a bewildered old man; and a poor, dumb country bumpkin, what Homer\u2019s generation would have called a \u201cGeorgia cracker.\u201d The cavalier caused the war, the bumpkin fought it, not knowing any better, and the old man reflects the desperation of the Confederacy in its dying days when it took everyone and anyone. He might have been a farmer or shopkeeper who became part of the Confederate supply chain. His best days are behind him, and that doesn\u2019t say much that\u2019s positive about the post-war South.\n\nThe Union soldier at the right is Francis Barlow, at age 30 a major general, fighting in a dozen battles, among them Gettysburg and Antietam. He was one of a handful of Union soldiers to start the war as an enlisted man and end it as a general. Homer was a fine figure painter and could paint very good portraits. Portraits are rare in his work, though. He didn\u2019t want to go on the treadmill of painting the rich.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBarlow\u2019s portrait shows Homer\u2019s considerable prowess. Barlow was first in his Harvard class academically when he enlisted. He came from a newspaper background himself, working for the New York Tribune as an in-house counsel before the war. He was the war\u2019s Audie Murphy, not quite as decorated and not a movie star, but a soldier often profiled in the press as both gentle and tough, honest, smart, and having no airs. He was the model WASP.\n\nThe show positions Barlow and the cavalier-type as modeling \u201ca spirit of civil exchange and peaceful reconciliation, symbolizing the resilience of republican democracy.\u201d I don\u2019t agree with this. Our swaggering badass is indeed in the middle of the composition, giving him some primacy, but it\u2019s a primacy driven by troublemaking. The cavalier class in Virginia and South Carolina especially \u2014 entitled, rich, narcissistic, and arrogant \u2014 dragged the South into the war and ruin. Barlow is shown in profile, looking like a Roman statue. A single Barlow \u2014 intelligent, cool, dignified, and commanding \u2014 was enough to best three Confederates. Homer chose to depict the famous Barlow as the symbol of the Union, with the three anonymous types representing the Confederacy, as if defeat deprived them of individuality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI doubt the three Confederates were contemplating \u201ccivil exchange and peaceful reconciliation.\u201d The South at the end of the war was flattened and surly. The widows of Ulysses S. Grant and Jefferson Davis might have taken tea and carriage rides together in New York in the 1880s, but broad reconciliation was in the air only for the 15 minutes it took Lincoln to deliver his Second Inaugural Address in 1865. The old man looks terrified and wants the earth to swallow him. His backwater colleague doesn\u2019t look capable of thinking high fallutin\u2019 ideas. The impudent buck seethes with unapologetic resentment.\n\nI see the painting as celebrating hegemony, done in a reportorial style that Homer adapted to the realm of painting, enlarging it and indulging in the luxury of details such as specific regimental colors and uniforms. It\u2019s Barlow who looks as though he has a future in this scenario, and he did. Later, he was the prosecutor who broke the Boss Tweed machine in New York.\n\nThis is the one quibble I have with an impressive, instructive show. It isn\u2019t huge, but it\u2019s intellectually rich and nicely organized in discrete, compact sections. It has a section on Civil War photography by artists other than Homer. Today, we know Matthew Brady\u2019s powerful scenes of battlefield dead, but in the 1860s these images were not widely seen. Photography was too much of a niche medium. In any event, the federal government practiced extensive censorship of war news. Homer, as much as he was a documentarian, almost never showed the violence of war, but he rarely depicted jingoist valor, either. His scenes from the front cover the boredom of camp life, snappy uniforms, and, rarely, the confusion of battle.\n\nArmy of the Potomac \u2014 A Sharpshooter, from 1862, is the exception. Sharpshooters were part of many warring armies, but the Civil War was the first in which they were an organized, specialized part of the military. They were still controversial because they drained warfare of valor and courage. They were stealth fighters, picking the enemy off without a good fight. They reduced soldiers to the status of hunted animals. A soldier on the front could never feel safe if sharpshooters were in the neighborhood. When they were captured, sharpshooters weren\u2019t treated as prisoners of war. They were routinely shot. Homer gives us close to an eyewitness view by putting us in the tree with the sharpshooter as he pulls the trigger. It\u2019s a frightening image of brutal, sudden, anonymous death and, for Homer and every other war artist in the Civil War, a unique scene.\n\nThere\u2019s good material on Homer\u2019s illustration process. He started with drawings, then sent them to Harper\u2019s printshop, which employed something approaching an assembly line to engrave the drawings on wooden blocks and later transfer them to metal plates suitable for mass reproduction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Fogg is one of the great museums in the country. Its collection is stupendous. I don\u2019t hate its renovated building, which reopened a couple of years ago, since it\u2019s impossible to wreck the home of so many great things, and it\u2019s certainly modernized. The Fogg is what people call the Harvard Art Museums, once three separate museums now combined into one with a great new art-conservation lab. It\u2019s been \u201cRenzoed,\u201d via an obscenely expensive, $450-million renovation designed by Renzo Piano. There was no reason \u2014 aside from ego \u2014 to hire a glamorous, expensive Italian architect to design what was almost entirely an interior revamp. The museum was almost totally closed to the public for five years, which is inexcusable. Access to Harvard students was so limited that, in effect, thousands came and went having little meaningful contact with the museum.\n\nThe Fogg was an old-time gothic-revival-meets-beaux-arts space, an accretion of odd but attractive old academic fads like sunken spaces and pilasters and friezes where you\u2019d least expect them. I liked the idiosyncratic look, part comfy, part ratty, and part elegant. Renzo made it look like every other museum, which means it looks like a hospital. At least it\u2019s light-filled, which is nice. Galleries for German art \u2014 one of the three museums was dedicated to that school \u2014 look good. Permanent-collection galleries are almost entirely painted white, which works for some things like ancient art but is otherwise a killer, especially in Old Master paintings galleries. I hope the wall colors aren\u2019t Renzo-required.\n\nThe project was many years in the making, one reason it grew into a money pit. One idea, an entirely new site on the Charles River, was abandoned after a neighborhood furor. The building in this iteration was fraught with problems, leading to many delays. The financial crisis in 2008 caught Harvard in some endowment and capital-campaign shenanigans. I believe this slowed fundraising. During the time the museum was closed, the entire curatorial team was restructured and right-sized. This was good, since the Fogg had too many curators, but the changes contributed to a miserable mood at the place.\n\nThis has changed. It\u2019s ruled by a new director, Martha Tedeschi, who has many things in her favor. She\u2019s a print curator, which means she\u2019s absorbed a zeitgeist of humility that\u2019s refreshing at Harvard. Print curators experience endless slights because of the primacy of painting curators, but they\u2019re often the finest connoisseurs, and I\u2019ve met few who are prima donnas. She is a warm, reassuring presence. She was the print curator at the Art Institute of Chicago for years, a very functional place, and didn\u2019t go to Harvard. Harvard, I know, is many different places but insularity is an easy ailment to acquire among Harvard natives.\n\nThe Fogg, like every department at Harvard, does its own fundraising. It\u2019s a type of academic financing called \u201ceach tub on its own bottom.\u201d During a big school-wide capital campaign, Harvard\u2019s central fundraising office will help its constituents, but for operations \u2014 basically, supporting the annual budget \u2014 you\u2019re on your own. I suspect that the Fogg\u2019s new director has an enormous fundraising burden. Now that the Fogg has a revamped building, solving a decades-long menu of infrastructure problems, I doubt the central Harvard money machine will lift a finger to help the Fogg. The Fogg is considered done and no longer at the head of any lines.\n\nI\u2019m not sure how much of the Fogg\u2019s fundraising went to meet the $450 million target for the Renzo project, how unexpectedly expensive it is to run this big boutique building where much is customized, or how much endowment money actually came in to support future operations. My impression from colleagues at the Fogg and Harvard is that it\u2019s an unusually uneasy money moment. There\u2019s nothing Tedeschi can\u2019t handle. She\u2019s the real thing. Donors will love working with her. Everything about her is quality.\n\nThe place has a newly positive spirit. The shows are good. Students are obviously much involved in the museum. That wasn\u2019t always the case. With a permanent collection of 250,000 objects, the Fogg doesn\u2019t need to do big loan shows. With the excellent Homer show and the other good permanent collection shows there, and a fantastic collection, it\u2019s a joy to see the Fogg back in business.", "description": "In Winslow Homer's \"Canoe in Rapids,\" the rough forest landscape, cold gray sky, and roiled water is a triumph of efficiency and directness, each element of nature reduced to essential qualities.
