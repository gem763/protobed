Why has all the fuss gone into creating a venue adaptable to two sports and surfaces? And what can we expect from Sunday's event as a whole? Sportsmail reveals all...\n\nNFL comes to the brand new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium for the first time on Sunday evening\n\nThe 62,000-capacity ground was specifically built to cater for NFL matches every season\n\nWhy is the NFL in London?\n\nThe NFL (National Football League) has been coming to London since 2007, when the first 'International Series' match was played between the New York Giants and the Miami Dolphins at Wembley.\n\nSince then, there have been a total of 23 matches in London, as the Series has expanded in regularity. From one game a season in 2012, there are now four games pencilled in every season.\n\nBut now, a new venue has been added to the mix. Tottenham Hostpur's \u00a31billion, 62,000-capacity stadium, which officially opened in April, will host a minimum of two matches every season for the next 10 years as part of a lucrative deal between Tottenham Hotspur FC and the NFL.\n\nHow can the stadium host football and NFL?\n\nTOTTENHAM HOTSPUR STADIUM BY NUMBERS 2,090 metres of rail installed for moving the pitch\n\n25 minutes to retract the pitch from start to finish\n\n35,000 decorative tiles on the stadium exterior\n\n99 steel trays joined together to make up the sliding pitch\n\n7,217 tonnes of steel in the south stand\n\nSouth Stand trees each weigh 262 tonnes and are 49m tall\n\n23,000 square feet - the largest club retail shop in Europe\n\n325 square metre screens - the largest in Western Europe\n\nFrom a logistical point of view, that's easy. The football club will simply not host any home games near to when NFL games are scheduled at the stadium. This year for example, Spurs played away to Brighton on Saturday, and next week's game takes place during the international break.\n\nBut the real genius comes in the stadium design. The grass field used for Tottenham games is retractable, with an artificial turf used for NFL underneath.\n\nThis means the - at times - shocking playing surface at Wembley, which saw the turf quickly tear up, is a non-issue.\n\nFurthermore, there are dedicated NFL facilities intertwined in the background, such as the changing rooms, which are big enough to house a full NFL squad and support staff. There are also a raft of player facilities including hydrotherapy and medical areas.\n\nAs impressive as the myriad of features available now, the whole setup will undergo it's first proper test on Sunday.\n\nWho's playing?\n\nSo on Sunday, the Chicago Bears face the Oakland Raiders in what is technically a Raiders-home fixture. Kick-off is at 6pm.\n\nNext Sunday, at the earlier time of 2:30pm, the Carolina Panthers play the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in an NFC South match-up.\n\nThe final two games of the London Series take place at Wembley. First, the Cincinnati Bengals play the Los Angeles Rams on October 27, and a week later the Kansas City Chiefs face the Los Angeles Chargers in an AFC West tussle.\n\nWho are the favourites and why?\n\nAfter reaching the play-offs last year and coming within inches of a divisional game, the Chicago Bears are undoubtedly favourites against a Raiders-franchise who had a 4-12 record last year, finishing rock bottom of the AFC West.\n\nBut, it is far from a foregone conclusion. The Raiders, coached by the charismatic former pundit Jon Gruden, are currently 2-2 and won impressively on the road at the Indianapolis Colts last week. Quarterback Derek Carr threw for two touchdowns, and is seemingly finding some confidence as the season hits full swing.\n\nOakland Raiders head coach Jon Gruden has a staggering 10-year contract with the franchise\n\nFor the record, Gruden can also coach in the knowledge he is virtually unsackable at the moment - he is just one year into a 10-year contract with the organisation. Alan Pardew, eat your heart out.\n\nThis week will be an all-together sturdier challenge though, with the Bears defence one of the strongest in the NFL.\n\nPro Bowl pick Khalil Mack (who was traded by the Raiders last summer) is a devastatingly effective pass-rusher, and with defensive end Akiem Hicks likely to return, Carr will have to release the ball quickly and efficiently.\n\nOn the flip side, the Bears offence is struggling, so much so that starting quarterback and first-round 2017 draft pick Mitchell Trubisky is likely to be dropped for backup Chase Daniel.\n\nDaniel completed 22/30 passes thrown when he came on in last week's win against the Minnesota Vikings, so is more than capable of stepping in.\n\nKhalil Mack is Chicago's main defensive threat and is one of the best pass rushers in the league\n\nWhat do players and fans think of the stadium?\n\nThe professionals who visited the stadium in July for the unveiling of the inaugural NFL Academy were distinctly wowed by what they saw.\n\nHicks observed: 'I think it's awesome. It has a very modern feel to it.\n\n'The first thing that I noticed was it doesn't seem like there's a bad seat in the house. Everybody can be close to the game and engaged. I thought the cockerel on top was a pretty nice touch.'\n\nNFL poster-boy Odell Beckham Jr, now at the Cleveland Browns, said: 'It is a big locker room. I won't lie to you. It's very nice though.\n\n'It's better than the facilities we have back home to be honest with you or at least the ones I've been in.'\n\nThe standard has been set, it seems.\n\nAny half-time entertainment?\n\nAbsolutely!\n\nBritish rapper AJ Tracey will stage the first-ever NFL London Games half-time show when he performs on Sunday night.\n\nAfter headlining at Glastonbury and selling out at Alexandra Palace, Tracey will now play at the home ground of Tottenham Hotspur, the football team he supports.\n\nAJ Tracey, seen here at Reading Festival, will perform at half-time at Tottenham's new ground\n\nCould the stadium host a London franchise in the future?\n\nIt's been mooted for years, and there are no concrete signs yet that the NFL are planning to expand to London in the near-future.\n\nHowever, given the long-term nature of the deal the NFL has in place with Tottenham, should a London-franchise get off the ground, Spurs' stadium would be the obvious front-runner to host the organisation.\n\nOne step at a time though. First, it has to pass the test of Sunday evening's highly anticipated curtain-raiser.", "description": "A year later then planned, Tottenham Hotspur's new stadium is all set for its American unveiling this evening, as the Chicago Bears face the Oakland Raiders in the first of four NFL London games.", "authors": ["Kieran Jackson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/09/19356102-0-image-a-4_1570350862306.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
