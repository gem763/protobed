He is still awaiting trial in Illinois on another murder charge.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Friday, jurors unanimously recommended Gargiulo be put to death for his crimes. The panel of six men and six women deliberated for several hours before reaching the decision, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s Office.\n\nThe decision brings one of the country\u2019s most closely-watched serial killer cases closer to a resolution, though it is unlikely Gargiulo will be executed any time soon, if ever. Earlier this year, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) suspended the death penalty indefinitely, calling capital punishment an immoral punishment and a public policy \u201cfailure.\u201d The state has more than 700 inmates on death row \u2014 the most of any state \u2014 but California authorities have not executed a prisoner since 2006.\n\nGargiulo is scheduled to be formally sentenced at the end of February, at which point Superior Court Judge Larry P. Fidler will rule on motions for a new trial or lighter sentence.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe 43-year-old was silent as a court clerk read the jury\u2019s decision Friday, saying only \u201cyes\u201d when the judge asked if he agreed with the sentencing date, Courthouse News reported. Gargiulo had pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nGargiulo\u2019s attorney, Daniel Nardoni, said he was disappointed by the outcome. The defense team argued at trial that Gargiulo had dissociative personality disorder, a mental illness often marked by memory gaps. Given his condition, Nardoni told the Associated Press, jurors should have recommended life without parole.\n\n\u201cYou don't kill people that are mentally ill,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's just a matter of humanity.\u201d\n\nGargiulo\u2019s case has been a magnet for public attention for years, not just because of the brutal manner in which he is said to have stalked and killed his victims over a long stretch of time, but because of its Hollywood connection.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne of Gargiulo\u2019s victims, 22-year-old Ashley Ellerin, was dating actor Ashton Kutcher when she was killed. On an evening in February 2001, Kutcher, then best known for his role in the sitcom \u201cThat \u201970s Show,\u201d went to the fashion school student\u2019s house near historic Hollywood to pick her up for a Grammy Awards after-party. When she didn\u2019t come to the door, he peered into a window to see if she was there and saw what he thought was a trail of spilled red wine on the carpet, as LA Weekly has reported. In reality, prosecutors said, it was a murder scene. A friend found Ellerin\u2019s body the next day.\n\nEllerin\u2019s mother testified at during the penalty phase of the trial, saying she \u201cfell to her knees\u201d when she learned of her daughter\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cI ache for her,\u201d Cynthia Ellerin told the court, according to the Associated Press. \u201cI ache to hold her. I ache to hear her voice, to hug her. But that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKutcher, who also testified, said he was worried he would become a suspect. Authorities quickly cleared him.\n\nIn addition to Ellerin\u2019s murder, Gargiulo was convicted of murdering 32-year-old Maria Bruno, a mother of four who was discovered stabbed to death in her apartment El Monte, a Los Angeles suburb, in December 2005.\n\nGargiulo also tried to kill Michelle Murphy in April 2008, prosecutors said. At trial, Murphy testified that she was in bed in her Santa Monica apartment when she awoke to Gargiulo attacking her with a knife. As she struggled to push him away, authorities said, Gargiulo cut himself and fled, leaving behind a trail of blood that investigators used to link him to the other women\u2019s deaths.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIn the days, weeks and months after it happened, I barely even slept,\u201d Murphy testified, according to the Associated Press. \u201cI feared the nighttime and going to bed. I still slept with the lights on for a long time.\"\n\nAD\n\nDuring their investigation, authorities found yet another woman they said was killed by Gargiulo, 18-year-old Tricia Pacaccio. In 1993, the rising Purdue University student\u2019s father found her stabbed to death on the family\u2019s front steps. Gargiulo, who was 17 at the time, lived down the street. Authorities considered him a suspect initially, but did not charge him until 2011, three years after he was arrested in connection with the other stabbings.\n\nAs trial began earlier this year, Gargiulo\u2019s defense attorney said there was \u201cnot one single bit of physical evidence\u201d tying him to Ellerin\u2019s death, KABC reported. Gargiulo has also long insisted he had no role in the other deaths. In the attack on Murphy, defense attorneys argued he was suffering from a \u201cfugue state\u201d stemming from his disorder.\n\nIn 2011, Gargiulo told CBS\u2019s \u201c48 Hours\u201d from jail: \u201cI\u2019m 100 percent innocent.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Gargiulo was convicted of murdering two women, including Ashley Ellerin, a former girlfriend of actor Ashton Kutcher.", "authors": ["Derek Hawkins", "National", "Breaking News Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/A-7rKAgZ3J-LHppd85UwUDkyDl8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JZTVPZHR54I6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
