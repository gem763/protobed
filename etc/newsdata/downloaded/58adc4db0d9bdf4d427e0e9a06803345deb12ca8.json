The captain of England\u2019s U17 World Cup-winning side and winner of the U18s Premier League scholar of the year award, ahead of teammates Phil Foden and Jadon Sancho, it\u2019s no exaggeration to claim that the still teenage centre-back is amongst the most decorated academy footballers on the planet. And yet, Latibeaudiere makes no attempt to mask the frustration and, at times, the agony of having his blossoming career halted in the shade.\n\nFor the past two years, the 19-year-old has been locked in a contract stand-off with Manchester City, concerned by the promise of an \u201cunclear route\u201d to the first-team. He\u2019s still yet to make his debut and, after suffering a posterior cruciate ligament injury that stole almost the entirety of last season, has found himself stuck on a type of star-studded threshold, waiting for the glass ceiling to shatter. But after resisting the safety net of signing a long-term deal this summer, solace arrived just hours before this week\u2019s European transfer deadline when Latibeaudiere\u2019s season-long loan move to FC Twente was confirmed.\n\n\u201cI feel like it\u2019s a time where I just need to be playing,\u201d he says. \u201cIt can be very frustrating because I believe I\u2019ve got the ability and I know if I\u2019m given the chance, I won\u2019t let it go. I want to be the best I can be and, to do that, I have to be playing first-team football.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re injured, your name can sometimes be swept under the rug a little bit and I need to be out there playing men\u2019s football. I want to go into battle. I\u2019ve always wanted the chance to play abroad at some stage. I feel like this is going to be a big season for me and I just needed that opportunity to prove myself. Nothing will stop me. If a pathway is presented at City as a result, I can think about it.\u201d\n\nSince he was six years old, Latibeaudiere\u2019s dad told him about a 10-step ladder that would act as scaffolding to his career. It\u2019s rusty and scaled at the bottom with footholds muddied by thousands. However, as you near the top and lift your head above the parapet, the faraway flicker becomes a spotlight and the rungs turn pristine silver.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s at the 10th step?\u201d\n\n\u201cBeing a fully-fledged professional footballer.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what step are you on now?\u201d\n\n\u201cSeven.\u201d\n\n***\n\nThose coaches and teammates who know Latibeaudiere best don\u2019t highlight the myriad of flicks and feints that belie his position as a central defender or the unique athleticism that compensates for his smaller stature and set jumping records at the England training centre. Instead, they marvel at his unguarded determination to be a leader.\n\nTake the World Cup final between England and Spain in India two years ago. Morgan Gibbs-White has just scored the equaliser to pull the game back to 2-2 and nine of England\u2019s outfield players are charging manically towards a flag-draped corner of Kolkata\u2019s Salt Lake Stadium. But the 10th player, still lucid amid the euphoria, veers off towards goal, fastens the ball beneath his arm and immediately heads for the centre-circle. By the time his teammates have returned, Latibeaudiere is lost in a frenzy, shouting and conducting with orchestral abandon.\n\n\u201cWhether I have the armband or not, I\u2019ll always be a leader and that will never change,\u201d he says. \u201cMy parents always told me to be strong and state my opinion. I\u2019ve always been a big voice in the changing room and I think players are able to get a drive off me.\n\n\u201cMy parents say when they see me on the pitch, they think I can look horrible and nasty,\u201d he laughs. \u201cAway from the field, I\u2019m calm, polite, a nice normal guy, but once I cross that white line, I become a different person. It\u2019s all about winning and when I\u2019m on the pitch it\u2019s tunnel vision. That\u2019s all I can think about.\u201d\n\nAs Latibeaudiere lifted the trophy in India \u2013 becoming the first Englishman ever to do so \u2013 a hoard of his relatives and neighbours gathered in his dad\u2019s favourite pub in Armthorpe, an old mining village 10 miles from central Doncaster.\n\nIt was the crowning moment of his career thus far and speaking about it spills a dam of memories. He can still feel the goosebumps on his arms and the cold metal of the trophy on his fingertips. He remembers the tearstained embrace with Foden at the full-time whistle and the restless wait to find his mum and sister outside the stadium in India\u2019s suffocating evening humidity. \u201cThe final was just so surreal,\u201d he says, reliving the night\u2019s trance. \u201cIt was just\u2026 emotion.\u201d\n\nThe joy that day wasn\u2019t just in winning, but validation for the sacrifice Latibeaudiere and his parents have made since the day he sat in the back seat of their car in joyful hysterics after being scouted by Leeds. For four years, his father, a local glass factory worker, would wake up at dawn after a 12-hour shift to drive Latibeaudiere to training. Eventually, City, Manchester United, Liverpool and Everton all offered him positions in their academies. \u201cI went to all the clubs and looked around, but I always knew I\u2019d go to City,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were planning to build the best team and the best academy in England. That\u2019s what I wanted to be part of so that\u2019s what sold it to me.\u201d\n\nAfter joining City, Latibeaudiere left home to live in Manchester when he was just 13 years old. \u201cI\u2019ve had to separate myself from being a normal teenager,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve dealt with that but it\u2019s not something people necessarily see or understand. Leaving home, leaving my family, those sacrifices you\u2019ve made; I wouldn\u2019t say I had a hard upbringing but I\u2019ve been less privileged than others, it gives you a certain mentality. That\u2019s why I know I\u2019m going to succeed.\u201d\n\nWithin a matter of games, Latibeaudiere established himself as a standout member of a precocious youth team, featuring Foden, Sancho, Ed Francis (now of Wolves), Tyrese Campbell (now of Stoke) and Luke Bolton (on loan). Armed with a ruthless blend of grace and grit, Latibeaudiere was always regarded by the club\u2019s coaches as having the talents to rival Foden and Sancho. Latibeaudiere counts them as friends, but can\u2019t deny the pain feeling left behind.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so happy for them,\u201d he says. \u201cThey deserve it but of course it is hard when you know you\u2019ve got the talent too. I\u2019ve always believed I can reach that level.\u201d\n\n***\n\nUntil this last injury-stricken year, caused by a collision with the post during an England training session, Latibeaudiere was \u2013 even if not recognisable to the wider public \u2013 always considered to be at the forefront of City\u2019s glittering academy system. He has worked closely with Pep Guardiola\u2019s defensive coach Rodolfo Borrell, impressed upon assistant manager Mikel Arteta and sapped knowledge from his idol Vincent Kompany.\n\nBut, after seeing Sancho force his way to Borussia Dortmund, the feeling of being nested in a gilded cage became a parasitic force amongst the club\u2019s prized prospects, with the likes of Brahim Diaz, Rabbi Matondo and Jason Denayer all subsequently following suit. Latibeaudiere recognises that he is caught somewhere in a purgatory between patience and ambition, the unrelenting desire to hurtle out of a period shadowed by the feeling of standing still.\n\n\u201cIt has been a big thought process for me to delay signing [a new deal],\u201d Latibeaudiere admits. \u201c[Before suffering the injury last season], I felt like I\u2019d done a lot for my age. I\u2019d just won player of the season but I wasn\u2019t given the chances I believed I was going to be. City are the best team in the world and it\u2019s very hard to breakthrough. Seeing what Jadon did; not signing and moving abroad was clearly the right thing for him because of what he\u2019s achieved since and it did make things more clear for other young players coming through. He didn\u2019t have a clear route but he knew he had the talent; we all did.\u201d\n\nWith two years now remaining on his contract at City \u2013 after a year option was taken in line with his loan move \u2013 Latibeaudiere is also acutely aware that the risk he\u2019s taken in forcing a move to Holland could well come to define the flight or fall of his graduation to achieving that long-anticipated mantle of becoming a \u201cfully-fledged professional footballer\u201d. He is under no illusions that, even if his loan spell is a wild success, he will likely return to City and be faced by the same dilemma. And yet, whether he ultimately chooses to remain in Manchester or make peace with the unknown, there is a very real combination of enthusiasm and erudition which leaves few doubts that those two paths will eventually reconvene.\n\nThat glass ceiling?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to smash it.\u201d", "description": "Joel Latibeaudiere tugs thoughtfully at the tuft of hair on his chin, not quite sure whether to smile with joy or sigh in relief.
