EU negotiators have pointed out that it has been rejected by groups representing Northern Irish business.\n\nThe UK is seeking a fallback of no controls, checks and border infrastructure, even if the DUP vetoes Northern Ireland\u2019s alignment with the single market. The bloc\u2019s internal market would be left wide open for abuse, the European commission has said in its rejection of the proposal.\n\nThe UK\u2019s proposal leaves it up to a joint EU-UK committee to work out how to avoid customs checks and infrastructure near the Irish border once there are two customs territories and sets of rules on the island of Ireland, without offering a plan B if no such solution is agreed.\n\nThe UK has called for reform of the common transit convention so as to avoid the need for new infrastructure in the shape of transit offices on either side of the border for the scanning of goods that have passed through multiple territories. Brussels has refused as it would lead other non-EU countries to seek similar exemptions, endangering the internal market.\n\nThe text affords what is seen as an unacceptable wholesale exemption for small and medium-sized businesses from customs duties and processes, but it fails to provide details on how to then combat smuggling.\n\nOn VAT, the British negotiators were told that the proposals fail to offer any solutions as to how to avoid payments and checks at the border.\n\nUnder the UK\u2019s proposals all the state aid and level-playing-field conditions Theresa May agreed to in order to reassure the EU that Northern Ireland businesses would not enjoy a competitive advantage have been deleted. But Northern Irish firms would still be able to compete in the single market for electricity.\n\nThe UK would have access to an unlisted number of EU databases to allow it to police the customs border on the island of Ireland and the regulatory border between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Whitehall would maintain such access even if the DUP vetoed alignment with the single market.\n\nThe EU\u2019s hard-hitting rebuff was delivered to Frost on Friday and Monday, according to the leaked report, which was compiled following a briefing of EU diplomats by the commission.\n\nThe message had been passed on to Johnson in a series of phone calls with EU leaders over the weekend, during which Downing Street was left clear that the legal text did not form the basis for serious negotiation.\n\nFollowing Monday\u2019s discussions between Frost and the commission\u2019s negotiating team, a UK government spokesman said it had offered the clarity that had been sought on the proposals.\n\nUK retailers demand Brexit deal after worst September on record Read more\n\nFrost is understood to be staying in Brussels on Monday night but the EU has not yet agreed to negotiate on the detail, given what sources described as the \u201cfundamental flaws\u201d.\n\nThe British government spokesman said: \u201cFollowing hours of discussions last week, the UK provided additional legal text today. This provided further technical detail on customs and goods regulations to further clarify how the UK\u2019s proposals would operate.\u201d\n\nSenior EU sources do not think Frost has any room for manoeuvre to change Johnson\u2019s proposals. The European commission briefed member state diplomats that the UK had outlined \u201cno new concepts\u201d in a slightly revised legal text Frost offered on Monday.\n\nPlay Video 1:06 Boris Johnson claims EU has not explained why it objects to his Brexit plan \u2013 video\n\nEU sources scoffed at claims coming out of Downing Street that a \u201ccounter-offer\u201d could be expected from Brussels in the coming days. \u201cIt is the UK that wants to replace the backstop \u2013 and that is our solution,\u201d said one senior EU diplomat.\n\nOn Monday, the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, met with the Dutch foreign minister, Stef Blok, who tweeted: \u201cFrank & honest discussion today with Steve Barclay. As good neighbours do.\n\n\u201cImportant questions still remain on UK Brexit proposals and more realism and clarity necessary this week. Full support for Michel Barnier.\u201d\n\nAn EU commission spokeswoman said the EU27 remained of the opinion that the UK had failed to offer an alternative to the Irish backstop, which would avoid a hard border by keeping Northern Ireland in the single market and the EU\u2019s customs territory.\n\nShe said: \u201cWe all agree that we need a workable solution now and not something based on untried and revokable arrangements that would be left to negotiation during the transition period.\n\n\u201cThe UK\u2019s proposals do not meet at present the objectives of the protocol on Northern Ireland/Ireland and this is the shared view of the EU parliament but also all member states.\u201d\n\nThe British government\u2019s refusal to share the detailed legal text beyond the small circle of EU negotiators has infuriated diplomats and sowed confusion about the UK\u2019s intentions on key points, such as the transition extension.\n\nUnder the current agreement the UK could extend the transition until the end of 2022, if both sides agree, but the UK is seeking to drop a reference in the Irish protocol to such an extension.\n\nSome EU diplomats suspect the change is presentational, to match the government\u2019s insistence it can get a speedy agreement on a future trade deal. The Guardian understands that the UK does not intend to drop the transition extension from the withdrawal agreement.", "description": "Exclusive: Leaked papers obtained by the Guardian show extent of fundamental objections Brussels has raised", "authors": ["Daniel Boffey"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73297b5b3eb0f414b422d739006d20c3c8bc7d34/0_104_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4ef36da65fd2ef51bb5c6bd2981ae688", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
