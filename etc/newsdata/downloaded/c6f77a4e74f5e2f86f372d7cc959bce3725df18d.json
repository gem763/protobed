'I knew I'd done something really serious so I was really concerned. But my family kept me confident that I'd be back to how I was.\n\n'There were days when I would go into training and I would be sad or disappointed because I could see the boys outside training and you just want to be out there with them.\n\n'So I had the dark days but at the same time I had positive days as well.'\n\nThe 18-year-old looks downbeat as he suffers an achilles injury against Burnley in April\n\nChelsea's medical team help Hudson-Odoi off the pitch as he begins the road to recovery\n\nHudson-Odoi, who has been with the Stamford Bridge outfit since 2007, spoke of the mental toll his injury took on him, having spent many months in the treatment room.\n\nBut the star, who was courted by European giants Bayern Munich earlier this year, is feeling happy with his performances since making his return, saying he has been surprised by the immediate impact he has made.\n\n'I was out for three to four months and it was crazy to even get the injury in the first place,' he added.
