However, there appeared an almost majestic unreadiness about his trumpeted readiness.\n\nFor he gave a performance utterly devoid of enthusiasm.\n\nLike a jobbing actor whose heart was not in the role, everything about his mood, his delivery and his body language screamed routine.\n\nThe party leader was welcomed on to the stage in Northampton by Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott\n\nParticipants in police line-ups appear more dynamic.\n\nOur venue was Northampton Saints' rugby ground. Corbyn said he had inquired at reception if the team might consider giving him a try-out.\n\n'Sadly they told me I was too old,' he chirped.\n\nYou really have to wonder about someone whose gags are as duff as this.\n\nHis warm-up act had been Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott.\n\nWhen she welcomed her boss on stage, you could almost see flinty sparks fly between the pair.\n\nLike Richard Burton and Liz Taylor between marriages.\n\nTaking his place at the lectern wearing what appeared to be a new tie \u2013 one of those ultra skinny ones favoured by New Romantic bands such as Spandau Ballet \u2013 he accused Boris Johnson of abusing the Queen by getting her to deliver a party broadcast on behalf of the Tories next Monday.\n\nAs an avowed republican, Jezza's concern for Her Majesty always rings slightly hollow.\n\nTaking his place at the lectern he accused Boris Johnson of abusing the Queen by getting her to deliver a party broadcast on behalf of the Tories next Monday\n\nHe then lifelessly rattled through a programme for government which he claimed would be the 'most transformative, radical and exciting programme ever put before the British electorate'.\n\nWhat we actually got was 30 minutes of undiluted economic nonsense. The content is now almost routine.\n\nNone of the proposals were new. I have sat through the same speech seven or eight times this year, though it becomes no less terrifying with each hearing.\n\nFamiliar policy followed familiar policy. At the heart of it was Corbyn's grand vision \u2013 his giant renationalisation programme to grab rail, mail, water and energy delivery back into public ownership, 'run by and for the public, not for profit'.\n\nIn some ways one has to marvel at the insouciance with which Corbyn announces these ground-shifting measures which some analysts say would cost \u00a3176billion.\n\nHe makes securing a pint of milk sound a more complicated transaction.\n\nThere'd be freebies galore, of course. Free bus travel for under-25s, bus passes for pensioners, an increase in the minimum wage for all workers from the age of 16.\n\nSpend, spend, spend. He made Sixties pools winner Viv Nicholson seem penny-pinching.\n\nMargaret Thatcher once observed that the trouble with socialism is 'eventually you run out of other people's money.' And there lies the rub.\n\nMr Corbyn rattled through a programme for government which he claimed would be the 'most transformative, radical and exciting programme ever put before the British electorate'\n\nMr Corbyn is very good at telling us how he's going to spend our dosh but mute on how he's going to raise any more.\n\nThere wasn't a single strategy for creating wealth. If I hadn't known better, it was as though he'd left several pages of his speech back in his car.\n\nHe finished with a lecture on climate change, which Labour are counting on as a 'yoof' vote-winner.\n\nHe paid tribute to Extinction Rebellion, those skanky harbingers of apocalypse whose grasp of basic economics is even more cock-eyed than Corbyn's.\n\nJezza thanked them for 'educating us' on what he calls the 'climate crisis'.\n\nI might point out these protesters have been camped outside my office in Parliament all week.\n\nFrom my eyrie, the sum of their activities these past four days has been to sing, dance and leave a trail of mess for others to clear up.\n\nIf this is Labour's idea of 'education', we're in even more trouble than I first thought if there is ever a Corbyn government.", "description": "Jeremy Corbyn's election pitch to voters yesterday contained more than \u00a31trillion in spending commitments, the Tories claimed.", "authors": ["Daniel Martin", "Policy Editor For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/03/19567780-0-image-a-11_1570759462865.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
