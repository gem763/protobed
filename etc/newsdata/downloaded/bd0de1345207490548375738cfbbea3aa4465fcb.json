We\u2019ve got to put out that positive message.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at the three-day Republican retreat at the Baltimore Marriott Waterfront Hotel, Mr. Pence praised House Republicans for sticking together and with the president both as a majority capable of setting the agenda and the minority party under Democratic control.\n\nSpecifically, he thanked them for standing together on border security issues, particularly during the record breaking government shutdown and when the president made the controversial decision to invoke emergency powers to use Pentagon funds for his border wall.\n\nCongress actually passed a resolution to block that emergency declaration, but House Republicans prevented the president\u2019s veto from being overturned.\n\nNow, Mr. Pence says, Republicans need to continue championing the president\u2019s goals for the future, including implementing immigration reform, passing the USMCA trade deal and establishing a Space Force as the newest branch of the U.S. military.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re on the airwaves at home, you\u2019re on the airwaves nationally on a regular basis and I just encourage you to let your voice be heard,\u201d Mr. Pence said.\n\n\u201cMake it clear that Republicans and this president are ready to work with the Democrats, including Elijah Cummings, to improve the lives of people in cities like Baltimore,\u201d he continued.\n\nThis kind of messaging is vital, the vice president said, as Democrats embrace increasingly liberal priorities.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s not going to be enough for us just to win the next election. We gotta win the next generation,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
