His biggest hit was \"Fortune Teller,\" which sold 2.5 million copies, and he was the first artist to receive a Canadian-registered gold album. He died in 2016.\n\nFounded in Vancouver in 1970, Chilliwack became a fixture on Canada's rock 'n' roll scene with unforgettable hits such as \"Fly at Night,\" \"I Believe\" and, of course, \"My Girl (Gone, Gone, Gone).\n\nOn Nov. 27, 1987, the Cowboy Junkies walked into Church of the Holy Trinity in Toronto and laid down The Trinity Session, establishing the introspective, quiet intensity that would be their musical signature through three decades. (We ranked their albums.)\n\nEstablished in 1978, the Canadian Music Hall of Fame recognizes Canadian artists who have distinguished themselves here at home and/or on the international stage, including Anne Murray, Joni Mitchell, k.d. lang, Leonard Cohen, Neil Young, Oscar Peterson, Rush, the Guess Who, the Tragically Hip, Shania Twain and others.\n\nAn hour-long special showcasing this Canadian Music Hall of Fame induction ceremony will be available to stream on Nov. 2 exclusively on CBC Gem. In addition, a second special highlighting the inductees and featuring in-depth interviews will air as part of Music Day on CBC on Sunday, March 15, 2020, ahead of the 2020 Juno Awards.\n\nFor full coverage of the 2020 Juno Awards, head over to cbcmusic.ca/junos.", "description": "They'll be celebrated at Calgary's Studio Bell, home of the National Music Centre, on Oct. 27.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5287098.1568746113!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/cowboy-junkies-hall-of-fame.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
