The bite was so painful Pence said he almost collapsed.\n\nUSA Today/Reuters\n\nHowever, Pence told attendees at the policy retreat, \"In our line of work, you're going to get bit sometimes, but you keep fighting.\" The bite allegedly occurred in March last year, when Pence was campaigning in Kentucky for Garland \"Andy\" Barr, a US representative for the state's 6th congressional district.\n\nBut farm manager Dermot Ryan, who was there at the time, told McClatchy that American Pharoah is \"sweet,\" and that it would be out of character for the horse to chomp on the vice president's arm.\n\nRead more: Mike Pence said in the 1990s that being gay was 'a choice' or a 'learned behavior,' but the White House says he isn't 'anti-gay'\n\n\"If he gave someone a nasty bite, I'd know it,\" Ryan said to McClatchy, noting that he was \"very honored\" to host Pence, who was \"very pleasant,\" at the farm. Representative Barr also didn't see the bite happen, but McClatchy reports he did see a bruise later on Pence's arm when the vice president \"showed it off on Air Force Two,\" according to spokesperson Jodi Whitaker.\n\nPence told the crowd at the retreat that he was a \"horse guy,\" and that when the bite happened, he \"gritted [his] teeth and smiled.\"", "description": "Vice President Mike Pence said Triple Crown winning race horse American Pharoah bit him, but a Kentucky farm manager says otherwise.", "authors": ["Kat Tenbarge"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7eaa7bf4fc24221f260da8-1536-768.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
