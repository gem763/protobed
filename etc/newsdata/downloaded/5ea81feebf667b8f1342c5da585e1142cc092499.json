According to Deadline, however, Jonah Hill is now reportedly in talks for an as-yet unnamed villain role in The Batman. Considering the plethora of recent cinematic Jokers, it seems more than likely the next Batman film would go for a different foe, say, a Mr. Freeze or The Riddler or The Penguin. On the other hand, director Matt Reeves could also give the people what they want and hand them another Joker! It\u2019s what audiences crave: for every Oscar-nominated actor to have his turn at the face paint-smeared role, at some point in his career. Don\u2019t fight this. Give us Joker Hill.", "description": "Jonah Hill is reportedly in talks to join Robert Pattinson\u2019s The Batman in an unnamed villain role, with rumors suggesting he might play The Riddler or The Penguin.", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/24/24-jonah-hill.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
