Chick-fil-A's notes that the chain is \"Closed Sunday.\"\n\nIn the video, a person adds text that reads \"Open Sunday\" to the Popeyes sign.\n\nA screenshot from Popeyes' video celebrating the return of the chicken sandwich. Popeyes\n\nPopeyes kicked off a mind-blowing battle of the chicken chains when it launched its sandwich on August 12. A subtweet from Chick-fil-A ignited a social media battle over which chain had the best sandwich.\n\nCustomers flooded stores to try Popeyes' chicken sandwich. Within two weeks, the chain sold out of supplies that were supposed to last until the end of October. Customers described chaotic, grueling shifts, sometimes without breaks.\n\nFoot traffic tracker Placer.ai found that customer visits to Popeyes exploded by more than 100% over the summer baseline average during the peak of the chicken sandwich wars. Other chicken chains also saw a rise in customers, according to Placer.ai, though not as great as Popeyes.\n\nPopeyes seems ready to once again battle Chick-fil-A for the title of best chicken sandwich in fast food. This time, the chain aims to be better prepared.\n\nAn employee in a franchised California Popeyes location told Business Insider that his distribution center was preparing for the hype of the chicken sandwich relaunch as far back as September.\n\nGuillermo Perale, the CEO of Popeyes franchisee Sun Holdings Inc., told Bloomberg that restaurants were hiring an additional 400 employees to manage the hype. Up to two people per store will reportedly be tasked with making the sandwiches when they return to the menu.", "description": "Popeyes is bringing back its famous chicken sandwich on Sunday, November 3 \u2014 and it's taking a jab at Chick-fil-A in the process.", "authors": ["Kate Taylor", "Shoshy Ciment"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db36173dee0192fe141b137?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
