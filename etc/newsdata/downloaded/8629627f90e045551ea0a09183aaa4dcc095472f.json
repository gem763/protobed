That\u2019s a smart move which is ignored by most people.\n\nIf you are also new to VPNs, you might wonder to what degree it helps to secure your cryptocurrencies. Is it helpful at all, and what should you do about it?\n\nThis short guide is precisely about that - should you use VPN for cryptocurrency transactions?\n\nShould I use a VPN for cryptocurrency transactions?\n\nVPNs do improve your crypto security but only from the privacy side of things. As you may know, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies (except privacy coins) are not anonymous but pseudonymous. It makes it rather easy to track your financial activities once you go through a KYC/AML verification. After all, all transactions are stored on a distributed public ledger, and you also leave an IP footprint at crypto exchanges and other internet service providers.\n\nA good privacy-oriented VPN service helps you to protect your identity from whoever wants to track you, be it hackers, a government agency, or a malicious third-party. It\u2019s a commonly accepted fact that privacy a fundamental human right among the civilized people. No one can steal your hard-earned money if they don\u2019t know it\u2019s you who owns it, which is why privacy is the ultimate security measure.\n\nSpeaking of bitcoin and crypto security, you shouldn\u2019t sweat it - all cryptocurrency protocols are designed with the highest level of security in mind and use end-to-end encryption. Most exchange websites use HTTPS end-to-end encryption, too, so no one can intercept the data you send directly to them unless you're exposed to critical security vulnerabilities. A VPN service adds an extra layer on top of that, which makes all of your web interactions more secure.\n\nThese are the key reasons why you should use a VPN when working with cryptocurrencies:\n\nVPN encrypts the data you send through the network, making it harder to intercept.\n\nyou send through the network, making it harder to intercept.

A privacy-oriented VPN doesn\u2019t store your logs and has a kill-switch, which helps to maintain your anonymity. [*]Don\u2019t fall for a free VPNs for your crypto activities, as these service providers tend to fund themselves by selling your private data. If you are serious about your privacy and security, go for a paid VPN, as they are more reliable and secure.\n\nWhich VPN should I use for cryptocurrency transactions?\n\nThere is a sea of VPN providers out there, so it takes days of research to find the right one. Even so, not every service provider is reliable, especially when it comes to privacy and anonymity.\n\nIf that\u2019s your concern, you should look for a VPN with a strict no logs policy and a kill-switch function. No logs mean the service provider doesn\u2019t collect your browsing data, so activity remains completely private. Otherwise, your browsing activities are logged and can be turned over to governments with surveillance programs or sold to advertisers.\n\nThe kill-switch feature terminates your internet connection without exposing your IP address when there are connection issues between you and the VPN service. In other words, it prevents websites from accessing your real IP address in case of a VPN connection failure. That\u2019s why it is vital for your privacy, too.\n\nTop-rated VPN providers typically come from states without mass surveillance programs. For example, countries like the British Virgin Islands, Panama, and Switzerland don't force VPNs to collect and store user data, which is somewhat liberating in today\u2019s digital world.\n\nIn contrast, many VPNs advertise themselves as privacy-oriented services only to hand over your private information when surveillance agencies request it. Be wary of VPN services that are based in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, which are also known as the \u201cFive Eyes\u201d countries. The same goes for \u201cfree\u201d VPN services.\n\nSo which VPN is the best for cryptocurrency transactions?\n\nOne of the most recommended VPN\u2019s out there is NordVPN. Based in Panama, it\u2019s by far the most advanced and reliable VPN for cryptocurrency enthusiasts.\n\nIt has a strict no logs policy, automatic kill-switch, DNS leak resolver, simultaneous protection for multiple devices, as well as related premium features like static IP, streaming services access, double encryption and onion (Tor) over VPN.\n\nBesides, like every privacy respecting VPN provider, NordVPN accepts cryptocurrency payments. At the moment, you can pay for it using Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Litecoin (LTC), Dash (DASH), Monero (XMR), Zcash (ZEC), Tron (TRX), and BitTorrent (BTT) cryptocurrencies.\n\nNordVPN offers great deals, too. Right now you can get an up to 75% discount if you sign up via this link.\n\nConclusion\n\nA reliable VPN is a handy privacy and anonymity tool for everyone who deals with cryptocurrencies. It\u2019s not a compulsory security measure that will save you from all and any harm (like malware, hackers, and viruses) and cryptocurrencies are already secure as they are cryptographically encrypted by design, but it can definately enhance your security and protect your identity. Look for a no logs VPN when choosing one and don\u2019t forget to support service providers who accept payments in cryptocurrencies. When used correctly, a privacy-oriented VPN becomes an invaluable instrument in your security toolset.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cimg.co/w/guides/0//", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
