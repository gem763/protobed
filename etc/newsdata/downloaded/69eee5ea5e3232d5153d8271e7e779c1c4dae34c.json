Khalilzad opted to talk directly to the Taliban, and speak separately with the Afghan government, in hopes of creating the conditions for direct talks between the two parties later. Right before the talks collapsed, he said he had reached an agreement \u201cin principle\u201d with the Taliban\u2014whereby the U.S. would gradually draw down the roughly 14,000 troops it has in the country in exchange for guarantees that the Taliban would not provide a haven for terrorist groups.\n\n\u201cI think from Ambassador Khalilzad\u2019s perspective, he kept us in the loop enough, whereas we thought we weren\u2019t,\u201d Mohib told me. \u201cOf course, our future is tied to it\u2014any deal that would have been signed or agreed to would have altered our future. So we naturally wanted to know all the details.\u201d The State Department has said that Khalilzad kept leaders in Kabul briefed on the discussions; most recently, a State Department spokesperson wrote to me on background in an email, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and his team \u201cextensively reviewed the most recent draft agreement [with the Taliban] in three languages,\u201d though it\u2019s unclear whether he was able to suggest changes. \u201cWe have consulted regularly with the Afghan government and other key stakeholders on all matters involving peace in Afghanistan,\u201d the spokesperson wrote, \u201cand will continue to do so.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Mohib couldn\u2019t even explain why Trump called the whole thing off. The president also revealed at that point that he had invited both Ghani and Taliban leaders to meet with him at the U.S. presidential retreat Camp David, before canceling at the last minute after the Kabul attack. \u201cWhy it fell apart is really a mystery to all of us\u2014we don\u2019t know exactly,\u201d Mohib said.\n\n\u201cWe accepted to attend the meetings at Camp David because we felt that this was an opportunity for us to talk at the highest level with our major partner, the United States, on the way forward,\u201d he said. But he noted that the Afghan government did not have a say in whether the Taliban would be there.\n\nAfghan civilians and security forces were killed regularly over nearly a year of Taliban negotiations with the U.S.\u2014during which Taliban leaders continued to claim that the government was an illegitimate puppet of the United States. The Taliban\u2019s position was a key reason the U.S., keen to end a nearly two-decade presence in the country that has cost close to $1 trillion by one estimate, pursued a separate deal with the insurgents. But it wasn\u2019t one that would have led to real peace, in Mohib\u2019s view.\n\nRead: A jabberwocky peace in Afghanistan\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be buying the Taliban\u2019s excuse that they do not recognize the Afghan government, and hence they don\u2019t want to talk to us,\u201d he said. \u201cPreviously we have negotiated with the Taliban. So this excuse that they don\u2019t recognize is just an excuse, and if they feel that they\u2019re getting away with it, then of course they will never talk to the government.\u201d", "description": "The Afghan national security adviser wants his government to take over after a failed year of U.S. negotiations.
