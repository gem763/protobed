Should those variables hold up, the president looks set to get another four-year term.\n\nBarring anything unusual happening, the president's Electoral College victory could easily surpass his 2016 win over Democrat Hillary Clinton, which came by a 304-227 count.\n\nPresident Donald Trump looks likely to cruise to re-election next year under three different economic models Moody's Analytics employed to gauge the 2020 race.\n\n\"If the economy a year from now is the same as it is today, or roughly so, then the power of incumbency is strong and Trump's election odds are very good, particularly if Democrats aren't enthusiastic and don't get out to vote,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics and co-author of the paper along with Dan White, the firm's director of government counseling and public finance research, and Bernard Yaros, assistant director and economist. \"It's about turnout.\"\n\nThree models show Trump getting at least 289 electoral votes, assuming average turnout. His chances decrease with maximum turnout on the Democratic side and increase with minimum turnout expected.\n\nOf the three models, he does best under the \"pocketbook\" measure of how people feel about their finances. In that scenario, assuming average nonincumbent turnout, he gets 351 electoral votes to the generic Democrat's 187. \"Record turnout is vital to a Democratic victory,\" the report states.\n\nIn the stock market model, Trump gets a 289-249 edge, while the unemployment model shows a 332-206 advantage. Across all three models, Trump wins 324-214.\n\n\"Our 'pocket\u00acbook' model is the most economically driven of the three. If voters were to vote primarily on the basis of their pocketbooks, the president would steamroll the competition,\" the report states. \"This shows the importance that prevailing economic sentiment at the household level could hold in the next election.\"\n\nStock market levels also are key, and the two are intertwined. Zandi said that even a garden-variety 12% market correction around election time could sway the race, as could an unexpected downturn in the economy.\n\nThe results might come as a surprise given Trump's consistently low favorability ratings \u2014 40% in the latest Gallup poll \u2014 and as most head-to-head matchups against Democrats show the president losing.\n\nHowever, the report said that Trump's relatively stable ratings help provide a good benchmark for how he will do once election time comes.\n\nZandi said the race could come down a few key counties in Pennsylvania, which Trump flipped in 2016 after the state had voted Democrat in the previous five presidential elections.\n\nSpecifically, he said Luzerne County, in the northeast part of the state, \"is the single-most important county, no kidding, in the entire election.\" The longtime Democratic stronghold favored Trump, 51.8% to 46.8% in the election.\n\nTrump doesn't even have to win the county, but merely needs a strong turnout, Zandi said.\n\nThe Moody's models have been backtested to 1980 and were correct each time \u2014 except in 2016, when it indicated Clinton would win a narrow victory. The authors attributed \"unexpected turnout patterns\" in Trump's favor caused the error and they adjusted for that in the latest projections. They also said the will be updating the projections as conditions develop and change.", "description": "Moody's three models show Trump getting at least 289 electoral votes, assuming average turnout.", "authors": ["Jeff Cox"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106175572-15707420966762019-10-10t211251z_431348621_rc15af619ea0_rtrmadp_3_usa-trump-whistleblower.jpg?v=1570742152", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
