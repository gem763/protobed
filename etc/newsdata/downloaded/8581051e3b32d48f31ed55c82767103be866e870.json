Over his left shoulder hung Mars, reddish-brown and heartbreakingly small, while to his right, the much grander Jupiter was lit up like a disco ball.\n\nWe were seated opposite each other on the lowest level of the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles, inhabiting a closed-off exhibition called \u201cDepths of Space,\u201d mulling stoic men. Pitt has played his fair share of them in the movies, including two characters just this year: Cliff Booth, the stunt man who sauntered through the summer hit \u201cOnce Upon a Time \u2026 in Hollywood,\u201d and Roy McBride, an astronaut shuttled to lonelier, ever more remote outposts of the galaxy in the coming \u201cAd Astra.\u201d\n\nMovie stars have their specialties, and while Pitt has proved that he can play a motormouth in films like \u201c12 Monkeys\u201d and \u201cSnatch,\u201d he\u2019s at his most alluring when he\u2019s holding something in reserve. It feels like you\u2019re watching a man who says no more than he needs to, which is a major feat for someone who has starred in two films from the notoriously loquacious Quentin Tarantino.\n\n\u201cI grew up with that be-capable, be-strong, don\u2019t-show-weakness thing,\u201d Pitt told me. He was raised in Springfield, Mo., the eldest of three children, his father the owner of a trucking company. Now, at 55, he\u2019s reached a point where he sees his dad in every performance he gives. \u201cIn some ways, I\u2019m copying him,\u201d Pitt said. \u201cHe had grown up in extreme hardship and poverty, always dead set on giving me a better life than he had \u2014 and he did it. But he came from that stoic ilk.\u201d", "description": "With two major performances this year, the 55-year-old actor and producer talks frankly about his future onscreen, masculinity and getting sober.", "authors": ["Kyle Buchanan"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/08/arts/08pitt-5/08pitt-5-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
