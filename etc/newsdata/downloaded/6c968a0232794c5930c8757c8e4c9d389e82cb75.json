I wasn\u2019t sure what he was all about but I decided I would get on board with whatever he was doing. Out of my group of friends I was the only Prince fan; they all thought he was a bit too avant garde and decided Michael Jackson was a more suitable pop star for them to like. Even at a young age I liked that Prince was very different and that he saw nothing wrong in being both very feminine and masculine at the same time. He showed that it was possible to be black in different ways and on your own terms, unlike a lot of other black people in the public eye.\n\nNaomi Campbell\n\nNot many people would choose a convicted felon but Naomi did the crime (she threw her mobile phone at an assistant), learnt from her mistake and then did it again. She did do the time though, a few hundred hours of community service and then wore a $300,000 designer dress on the last day. But it\u2019s her career where she needs to be celebrated. In the 80s she became British Vogue\u2019s first black cover girl in years; she was also the first black woman on the cover of French Vogue and American Vogue\u2019s September issue \u2013 legend.\n\nSolange\n\nSolange Knowles is Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s youngster sister and a very successful recording artist in her own right. She\u2019s been around for a while but came to wider attention with the release of her third album, A Seat at the Table, in 2016. The album takes its name from a Shirley Chisholm (the first black American to run for President in 1972) quote, \u201cIf they don\u2019t give you a seat at the table, bring a folding chair.\u201d Her music references and celebrates being black in America, with a particular focus on what it\u2019s like to be a black woman.", "description": "Rising star comedian Twayna Mayne on the black icons who inspired her.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p07rpw9h.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
