Black Mirror is officially happening guys. It\u2019s here.\u2019\n\nDr Tijion Esho, cosmetic doctor and the founder of The ESHO Clinic, responded to the activist\u2019s tweet voicing his disappointment that the show was still going ahead, despite turning it down months ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I got approached ages ago to do the show and I was pitched an idea from their team about what potentially the programme could be\u2019, he explained to Metro.co.uk.\n\n\u2018My initial understanding was that the people involved would be ones who were already thinking about getting surgery and then they would talk about why they wanted it done to a studio audience.\u2019\n\nThe star is hoping to transform lives on the controversial series (Picture: ITV/REX)\n\nHowever, when a press release was sent out, Dr Esho raised some concerns and realised it wouldn\u2019t be ethical to take part.\n\nHe continued: \u2018I tried to get more information about the show and in the end, I couldn\u2019t get any more so it got to the point where I told my management that I couldn\u2019t do it.\n\n\u2018I had to look at it from an ethical point of view and to be responsible for the millennial generation.\u2019\n\nDr Esho has raised concerns about the show (Picture: E4)\n\nThe 37-year-old who starred in E4\u2019s Body Fixers revealed why having surgery was such a life-changing decision.\n\nHe said: \u2018Having surgery is such a personal choice and it shouldn\u2019t be based on a jury telling you whether or not to have something done.\n\n\u2018The process of any procedure has big risks and to be honest I can\u2019t think of any doctor who would take part so I am wondering who agreed to sign up to do it.\u2019\n\nNot only does cosmetic surgery have a physical impact on your body but Dr Esho said it also affects your mental health.\n\nDr Esho with the the Body Fixers crew (Picture: E4)\n\n\u2018Any psychologist will tell you that anyone having surgery should do it for themselves and not because of the opinion of others, that should be separated and it goes against all of that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Body Fixers was a completely different show because it focused on helping people and we were allowed to know the whole format of the programme.\n\n\u2018We featured people that had already had a botched treatment or something awful had happened to them, for example, we had someone who had suffered an acid attack and another that had botched lip fillers.\n\n\u2018I enjoyed doing it because not only did we help them heal I was able to give people my help but on a larger platform.\u2019\n\nThe Surjury is due to hit our screens in 2020 and Dr Esho hopes he is proven wrong.\n\nHe added: \u2018I will be interested to see how the show turns out, and these kind of things attract people who are chasing surgery for the wrong reasons \u2013 and that are chasing some form of fame.\n\n\u2018At the end of the day the treatment they will receive will be free so it gives people the incentive to apply. I did my own personal screening for patients in Body Fixers, and sometimes when you do treatments there can be complications afterwards, so who will be responsible for the aftercare?\n\n\u2018I really hope that before I declined the show, that they took my advice and work alongside professional bodies as programmes like this have the potential to be good.\u2019\n\nChannel 4 defended the premise amidst the controversy, arguing: \u2018Cosmetic surgery has become an increasingly mainstream choice in Britain. The Surjury seeks to explore why so many people feel the need to change their bodies, and whether surgery actually makes them happier.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018All contributors featured in the series have actively been seeking surgery of their own accord. This new series allows them to consult with surgical teams and then to discuss their reasons for wanting it with a panel of their peers.\n\n\u2018If their peers support their decision they will undergo the procedure of their choice subject to the usual surgical checks and consent processes. The show will neither glamorise nor condemn their choices: the aim is instead to interrogate the realities of cosmetic surgery.\n\n\u2018Duty of care to contributors is of paramount importance and all will be independently assessed by the clinic who will carry out their procedure. They will be psychologically assessed and supported regarding their involvement in the programme.\u2019\n\nCaroline Flack has also defended the show by tweeted that the people who have taken part in the show have \u2018been through a lot\u2019\n\nShe tweeted: \u2018I\u2019ve filmed it and the people who have taken part are amazing and have been through a lot and life is about individual choice \u2026\u2019\n\nA Channel 4 representative has been approached for a comment\n\nThe Surjury airs in 2020 on Channel 4.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
