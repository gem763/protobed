Other readers reported being offered \u2018derisory\u2019 compensation for an annuity that was mis-sold to a spouse who has since died. So today we have printed a template letter that you can send to insurers to spur them into action.\n\nAnnuities: Evidence suggests that mis-selling was endemic across the insurance industry\n\nThe Mail on Sunday is also urging the regulator \u2013 the Financial Conduct Authority \u2013 to extend its probe into the annuity market, following the multi-million pound fines imposed on Prudential and Standard Life Assurance (now owned by insurance consolidator Phoenix and fined \u00a330.8million in July).\n\nAll the evidence suggests that mis-selling was endemic across the insurance industry. We believe that:\n\nEvery insurer should now be required by the FCA to review all past annuity sales to ensure customers ended up with the most appropriate plan. Where evidence of mis-selling is found, consumers should be offered immediate compensation (with interest) and be put in a position where future pension payments reflect the best deal they should have been offered at the time they annuitised.\n\nAny review should be all-encompassing. It should identify financial detriment caused by:\n\na) Retirees not being told of their right to shop around for an annuity.\n\nb) Consumers not being made aware of so-called enhanced annuities, which pay higher rates to people with reduced life expectancy as a result of poor health or a history of smoking.\n\nc) Buyers not being informed of the existence of annuities that offer protection not just to themselves, but to their spouses.\n\nFinally, the Government should resurrect a plan to allow all annuitants to cash them in. This was abandoned three years ago amid concerns consumers would not get value for money.\n\nA template letter that you can send to insurers to spur them into action\n\nJim Leith is among those who believe past annuity sales should be subject to an exhaustive review by the regulator. A few days ago, he received a \u2018derisory\u2019 compensation offer of \u00a3110 from Prudential for the annuity sold to his late wife Kathleen in 2009, just five months before she died of heart failure.\n\nDespite being given a mechanical heart valve at 25 and being told by doctors she was unlikely to see her 60th birthday, Kathleen was advised to buy a Prudential annuity with her pension fund when she hit 60.\n\nThough the annuity included a spouse\u2019s benefit for Jim, it did not factor in her poor health, which stemmed from contracting rheumatic fever at birth, weakening her heart. The compensation offered to Jim represents the extra income Kathleen would have got if she had been sold the enhanced annuity she was entitled to.\n\nBut it does not mention any future increase to Jim\u2019s spouse\u2019s benefit to reflect what he would now be receiving had Kathleen been offered an appropriate annuity. \u2018I cannot think there are many other people on this planet who were more poorly advised to buy an annuity than Kathleen. I maintain she was coerced into taking one out,\u2019 says Jim, 68.\n\nHad Kathleen not bought an annuity, her pension fund would have gone to her estate. Jim says any compensation he eventually accepts from Prudential will go straight to the British Heart Foundation. Jim says: \u2018This is no longer about money. It\u2019s about justice for all victims of pension mis-selling.\u2019\n\nSome victims of annuity mis-sales say they have been thwarted in getting financial justice\n\nOther victims of annuity mis-sales say they have been thwarted in getting financial justice. Last year, John Mould, a former vehicle salesman from Market Harborough in Leicestershire, took his case to the Financial Ombudsman Service, but got no joy.\n\nJohn has two small Abbey Life annuities that are now administered by Phoenix. His claim was based on the fact that at no stage in the annuity buying process \u2013 long before Phoenix came on the scene \u2013 was he told about the availability of enhanced annuities. Given he suffered a heart attack at age 35, he would have qualified.\n\nHis complaint was rejected on the grounds that before he annuitised, Lloyds \u2013 Abbey\u2019s owner at the time \u2013 sent him a booklet that had information on enhanced annuities.\n\nJohn, who is meticulous about keeping all financial documents, insists he never received it. Yet the Ombudsman sided with the insurer. \u2018I feel as if I have been shabbily treated,\u2019 says John.\n\nThat is exactly how David Greenhalgh, 67, from Standish, Wigan, feels. His Prudential annuity was bought without anyone telling him of his right to shop around, or that he could get an enhanced annuity due to a history of high blood pressure and high cholesterol.\n\nHe has yet to be offered compensation by the Pru. \u2018It is key that The Mail on Sunday keeps the pressure on these insurers,\u2019 says David. \u2018They should all be held to account.\u2019\n\nBilly Burrows is a pension specialist who has done much over the years to highlight the benefits of shopping around for an annuity.\n\nOn Friday, he said: \u2018I welcome The Mail on Sunday\u2019s timely campaign. As Jane Austen wrote in Sense And Sensibility, \u201can annuity is a very serious business\u201d, but sadly too many pensioners have been seriously left out of pocket by the greed of insurers. It is only right that all people who were mis-sold to in the past should now be compensated and their annuities changed. Justice must prevail.\u2019\n\nIt is not just mis-selling that irks annuitants. Many readers say they should now be allowed to break free of their annuities by being offered a one-off cash sum in exchange for forgoing future income payments.\n\nSome annuity providers, such as Rothesay Life and Phoenix, already allow this although it is restricted to those with low-value annuities.\n\n\u2018My Aviva annuity pays me \u00a380 a month,\u2019 says widower Bill Kelly, from Wimbledon, in South-West London. \u2018It is just enough to pay for a daily cup of coffee. I\u2019d rather get a lump sum and be done with it.\u2019\n\nOthers fear their annuity may end up in the hands of a firm they know little about. Colin Kenney, from Mullion, Cornwall, has a Pru annuity that pays him \u00a3114 a month.\n\nBut his annuity could in future be paid by Rothesay Life, a company set up 12 years ago and backed by private equity firm Blackstone. This is if the deal between Pru and Rothesay gets through the courts \u2013 it has been blocked once already.\n\n\u2018I have a Pru annuity because the insurer is a strong financial brand,\u2019 says Colin. \u2018That\u2019s the way I want things to stay. I\u2019ve objected to the deal. Why do insurers think they can trample over people like me?\u2019", "description": "Hundreds of pensioners have backed our campaign calling for insurance companies to compensate all customers who were railroaded into taking out inappropriate pension annuities.", "authors": ["Jeff Prestridge For The Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
