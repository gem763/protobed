Streetlights evenly spaced and dropdowns from the kerbs make it easier for pedestrians to cross than in much of South Africa\u2019s biggest city \u2013 except there are no pedestrians. The paint still looks fresh and the markings clear, but these roads to nowhere end in concrete and steel barriers.\n\nIt will become the future capital of the whole of Africa Zendai chairman Dai Zhikang\n\nThese are the few signs of what might have been: a plan by Shanghai-based developer Zendai Group for a new city district of gleaming skyscrapers, high-end housing, offices and an entertainment zone to be funded by R80bn (\u00a34.2bn) of investment over 15 years.\n\nHailed by an excited media as an \u201cAfrican Manhattan\u201d or a new New York for the continent, the view from the top of the tallest Modderfontein towers would have passed over the densely packed Alexandra township to the very real steel and glass of Johannesburg\u2019s existing financial centre in Sandton five miles to the west, where the latest skyscraper, the 234-metre Leonardo, has just taken the crown as Africa\u2019s tallest building. Modderfontein was to be to Johannesburg what Eko Atlantic is to Lagos, Nigeria \u2013 a shiny new start on the periphery of an African city that promised to fix all its existing problems.\n\nBeyond a few connector roads and streetlights the Chinese developer\u2019s dream never became reality. Refusal to agree to the Johannesburg authorities\u2019 demand for affordable housing meant planning permission was never granted. The land ended up being quietly sold, and resold, and is now in the hands of a company that appears to be developing the site piecemeal into a series of gated communities.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwenty-five years after the fall of the brutal apartheid regime, South Africa's cities remain hugely divided, both economically and racially.

We explore the deadly underground world of zama zama gold miners operating illegally under the city of Johannesburg, visit the Afrikaner-only town of Orania and publish an extraordinary photo essay by Magnum nominee Lindokuhle Sobekwa, who documents life in a formerly white-dominated area where his mother once worked as a domestic helper.\n\nNick Van Mead\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe sale of the land and failure of the project was never really publicly announced,\u201d says UCL research fellow Frances Brill who studied the case in depth with Ricardo Reboredo from the University of Dublin. During a three-year period Brill and Reboredo interviewed 50 consultants, architects, engineers and local authority planners involved to piece together what happened. Did Modderfontein\u2019s failure prevent the gap widening between an aspirational \u201cworld-class city\u201d project and the reality faced by the majority of Johannesburg\u2019s population \u2013 or should it be seen as a missed opportunity?\n\n\u2018The future capital of the whole of Africa\u2019\n\nBack in 2013 when the project first hit the headlines Zendai Group chairman Dai Zhikang told the South China Morning Post the development would act as a hub for Chinese firms investing in sub-Saharan Africa. With funds from the Bank of China, Zendai had bought Modderfontein from Heartland, the property development arm of explosives and chemicals company AECI. The area had been the site of South Africa\u2019s first dynamite factory until it closed in the 1990s. It also included a 111-hectare (275-acre) private nature reserve, home to a dazzle of zebras, allowing the Zendai development to be branded a \u201csmart city\u201d and \u201ceco city\u201d.\n\nStory continues", "description": "A render from Shanghai-based Zendai Group showing their plans for a vast development in Modderfontein, north-east Johannesburg Photograph: Zendai GroupThe Gautrain rushes through the green rolling hills and grasslands of Modderfontein, the commuter rail\u2019s gold livery recalling Johannesburg\u2019s reason for", "authors": ["Nick Van Mead In Johannesburg"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/efhl8hs0e_gB3fmu3oWVZQ--~B/aD0zMDA7dz01MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/theguardian_763/22fba256324c69d145c1620a84ac12a7", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
