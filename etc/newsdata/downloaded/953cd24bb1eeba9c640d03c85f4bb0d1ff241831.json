On the ground, the Rams put up 98 yards against a Bengals defense which is a shadow of its recent, dominant past.\n\nDespite showing fight during a second quarter which saw 21 points, Cincinnati were as anaemic as their record suggests. Andy Dalton is now the only quarterback in NFL history to open seasons with an 8-0 record (2015) and an 0-8 record.\n\nIt is tough to see where Cincinnati go from here. With the New York Jets and the Miami Dolphins on the schedule, there is scope for wins, but could Zac Taylor join the list of head coaches sacked after a losing trip to London?\n\nFor Sean McVay and the Rams, they move to 5-3. They are nowhere near the side which reached February\u2019s Super Bowl and look up to both the San Francisco 49ers and the Seattle Seahawks in a tough NFC West.\n\nBut there can be few easier opponents to boost the confidence levels ahead of a bye and the business end of the season.\n\nMcVay purred about the performances of Kupp and Goff, saying: \u2018I thought he was great. I thought Jared was really good as well, especially in that first half. For Jared to be able to throw 372, have another clean game with no turnovers, two touchdowns.\n\n\u2018And for Cooper to have 220, what can you say. But he continues to make play after play, a lot of good catches over the middle, a lot of big third down conversions. And then the rack, that you see consistently shows up, was instrumental to a lot of our success offensively and he balled today.\u2019\n\nA first quarter saw the teams trade field goals, and was notable only for another concussion in the career of Brandin Cooks. The wide receiver briefly caught a pass from Goff but safety Jessie Bates III lowered his head and crunched Cooks with a helmet-to-helmet hit.\n\nThe ball flew loose and Cooks headed to the locker room. It was the second time this month the year-old entered concussion protocol, the last coming in a week five loss to the Seattle Seahawks. With 21 points off three straight scoring drives, the second quarter was competitive, end-to-end stuff.\n\nThe Rams' wide receiver Cooper Kupp racked up career high numbers before half time\n\nGoff\u2019s weighted 31-yard pass evaded safety Germaine Pratt before Josh Reynolds gratefully reeled in his first touchdown of the season. The Bengals answered on the next drive, Joe Mixon and Giovani Bernard pounding on the ground before Dalton threw to a wide-open Mixon for a one-yard touchdown.\n\nFully in shootout mode, the Rams hit back. Goff handed to Kupp, who handed off to receiver Robert Woods. He flipped back to Goff, who then found Kupp on the right. Bengals nickel BW Webb looked primed to take out the receiver but slipped, allowing Kupp to dart unchallenged for a 65-yard touchdown.\n\n\u2018Yeah, we've been working that play for a while,\u2019 said Kupp afterwards. \u2018You never know when it's going to get called. You rep plays for a few weeks and just prepare for whenever it does get dialed up.\n\n\u2018And we got an interesting look from the defense, a little too invert. It wasn't exactly I think what we wanted from a coverage standpoint, but the execution, in terms of Jared putting the ball where we did. You see Higbee running down the field and getting some blocks. So it\u2019s one of those things.\n\n\u2018Things don't always play out the way you want them to, but you've got guys that can execute and adjust on the fly, good things happen.\u2019\n\nRams quarterback Jared Goff found nine separate receivers and threw for two touchdowns\n\nCincinnati got the ball back but failed to trouble the scoresheet before the break. Rams linebacker Dante Fowler Jnr\u2019s sack forced a punt and Cincinnati\u2019s back were against the wall. Todd Gurley bounced over on the opening possession of the second half, to wrap up the scoring.\n\nThey were the only points scored in the second half and signalled the end of any kind of contest. They also signalled the a decrease in carries for the running back, as McVay explained.\n\n\u2018Yeah, it just kind of worked out that way. It was hard just kind of with the way, again, I always say it's the flow of the game, and that was really what it ended up being. But he had some tough, hard-earned runs. I thought he did a good job punching it in for the touchdown,\u2019 he said.\n\nAaron Donald\u2019s suplex sack of Dalton, the Rams\u2019 fifth of the game, somehow avoided a penalty and the Bengals turned the ball over on downs deep in Rams territory to dodge any late drama.\n\nThe loss extends Cincinnati Bengal's winless run to start this season's NFL campaign\n\nAuden Tate's thought he had scored a late touchdown with seconds dwindling away, but that was overturned. The result leaves the teams heading in different directions as they fly back across the Atlantic.\n\n\u2018We're halfway through the season, but these guys are hungry for a win,\u2019 said Bengals head coach Taylor. \u2018They\u2019re hungry to show the world that we're improving and that we've got a good team here. Those are all the things we're still fighting for when we come back from the bye.\u2019\n\nBut for McVay, the bye is coming at the right time: \u2018We\u2019ll get our players a chance to get themselves healthy, get away a little bit. Our staff will get some rest and look at ourselves, figure out what can we do a great job of from an evaluation standpoint, especially these first eight weeks, and then putting ourselves in a position to hopefully peak at the right time.\u2019", "description": "PETER CARLINE AT WEMBLEY: A monster day for Cooper Kupp and Jared Goff gave the Los Angeles Rams an easy 24-10 victory over the winless Cincinnati Bengals at a frosty Wembley.", "authors": ["Peter Carline For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/23/20258884-0-image-a-16_1572217300142.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
