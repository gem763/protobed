REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - New International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva issued a stark warning about the state of the global growth on Tuesday, saying trade conflicts had thrown it into a \u201csynchronized slowdown\u201d and must be resolved.\n\nIn her inaugural speech after taking over the global crisis lender on Oct. 1, Georgieva unveiled new IMF research showing that the cumulative effect of trade conflicts could mean a $700 billion reduction in global GDP output by 2020, or around 0.8%.\n\nThe research takes into account U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s announced and planned tariff increases on remaining Chinese imports, or around $300 billion worth of goods. Much of the GDP losses will come from a decline of business confidence and negative market reactions, she said.\n\n\u201cIn 2019, we expect slower growth in nearly 90 percent of the world. The global economy is now in a synchronized slowdown. This means that growth this year will fall to its lowest rate since the beginning of the decade,\u201d Georgieva said.\n\nThe Bulgarian economist, a former European Union official who previously held the number two job at the World Bank Group, said that trade had \u201ccome to a near standstill.\u201d\n\nShe warned that fractures in trade could lead to changes that last a generation, including \u201cbroken supply chains, siloed trade sectors, a \u2018digital Berlin Wall\u2019 that forces countries to choose between technology systems.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn calling for countries to work together to revise global trade rules to make them sustainable, she referenced frequent complaints about China\u2019s trade practices, without specifically naming the country.\n\n\u201cThat means dealing with subsidies, as well as intellectual property rights and technology transfers,\u201d she said, adding that a modernized trading system would unlock the potential of services and e-commerce.", "description": "New International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva issued a stark warning about the state of the global growth on Tuesday, saying trade conflicts had thrown it into a \"synchronized slowdown\" and must be resolved.", "authors": ["David Lawder", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438469866&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9711G", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
