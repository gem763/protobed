Bernie Sanders has championed, according to a new poll. The data comes ahead of Tuesday's CNN and New York Times Democratic primary debate, where healthcare is expected to remain a fierce point of conflict dividing the party's progressive and moderate wings.\n\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health policy think-tank, found that backing for Medicare for All \u2014 a universal healthcare system that would virtually eliminate private insurance \u2014 narrowed more in the last month with 51% of the public favoring it and 47% opposing it. It's the closest gap measured since 2017, Kaiser said.\n\nThe poll also found:\n\nThere is still a partisan divide around Medicare for All with 71% of Democrats favoring it compared to 38% of Republicans.\n\nSupport for the public option under which people could choose to buy a government insurance plan through a Medicare-like system has increased to 73% among the public.\n\nAround 58% of Republican respondents support the public option, a 17-point jump from their September poll. This is the first time a majority of Republicans backed it in the Kaiser poll, so its unclear whether this surprising level of support bears out in future polling.\n\nSupport for Medicare for All has continued to narrow.

That move drew massive criticism from progressives.\n\nRead more: The 4 Democratic presidential candidates who cosponsored Bernie Sanders' Medicare for All Senate bill either no longer support it or won't say if they do\n\nSanders has long advocated for Medicare for All, a signature issue he thrusted towards the political mainstream during his insurgent primary run in 2016. He's said his plan would raise taxes, but would lower overall healthcare costs.\n\nAnd Sen. Elizabeth Warren embraced the plan with similar fervor, but said at a recent New Hampshire town hall that Medicare for All is \"a framework\" that \"doesn't have the details,\" according to The Wall Street Journal. She's facing mounting scrutiny on how she would ultimately pay for the proposal, which health policy experts say almost certainly requires a tax hike.\n\nIt spells possible problems for progressives pushing for Medicare for All. A more moderate approach like a public option that competes with private insurance plans is gaining traction among the public.
