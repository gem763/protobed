After all, Pyongyang has conducted six nuclear tests since its first one in 2006. No other country has conducted a single test this century.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, however, North Korea is barely a blimp on the map. Between America\u2019s first nuclear test in 1945 and North Korea\u2019s last denotation in September of last year, the world has witnessed at least 2,056 nuclear tests. Nearly 85 percent of these were conducted by the United States and the Soviet Union, but the three other recognized nuclear powers (the United Kingdom, France and China) have also conducted a significant amount of their own. Israel has never officially tested a nuclear weapon, although there is strong evidence that it secretly tested some in South Africa in 1979. India conducted a \u201cpeaceful\u201d nuclear explosion in 1974, followed by a series of five nuclear blasts in May 1998. Later that same month, Pakistan responded with six nuclear tests on two seperate days.\n\nRecommended: 1,700 Planes Ready for War: Everything You Need To Know About China's Air Force\n\nRecommended: Stealth vs. North Korea\u2019s Air Defenses: Who Wins?\n\nRecommended: America\u2019s Battleships Went to War Against North Korea\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "We've got them ranked.", "authors": ["Zachary Keck"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/PiHEck_r3Mh.P9eaHLerpw--~B/aD04MTA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/a75d2b5f6a6e03690c68cf1a8145bd72", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
