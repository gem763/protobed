Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a complicated disorder characterised by extreme fatigue. It can't be explained by any underlying medical condition. The fatigue may worsen with physical or mental activity, but doesn't improve with rest. This condition is also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME). Sometimes it's abbreviated as ME/CFS. The cause of chronic fatigue syndrome is unknown, although there are many theories - ranging from viral infections to psychological stress. Some experts believe chronic fatigue syndrome might be triggered by a combination of factors. Surrounded by so many questions, patients' complaints are often dismissed by families, strangers and even physicians who think their symptoms may be in their heads.
