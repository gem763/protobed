Said services must be performed for a fixed amount and form a regular part of the employee\u2019s remuneration.\n\nThe crypto assets have to be paid in accordance with the working contract, but most importantly, the cryptocurrencies have to be able to be exchanged for fiat if the worker desires to do so. Cryptocurrencies also must have the primary purpose of acting as a currency or be pegged to the price of one or more fiat currencies.\n\nThe bulletin further states that any salary paid in crypto assets will be treated as PAYE (pay as you earn) income payments. These types of taxes are deducted by the employer and passed onto the tax department directly. This ruling is set to go into effect on September 1st, 2019.", "description": "", "authors": ["Cryptocoin.News Is The Central News Source For Information On Cryptocurrencies.
