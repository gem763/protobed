He was joined by Alfredo Ortiz, president of the Job Creators Network, to discuss a forthcoming \u201cfree market solution\u201d for health care reform.\n\nHealth care is \u201cprobably the worst issue for Republicans heading into 2020,\u201d estimated Marlow, inviting Barbour\u2019s and Ortiz\u2019s comments on the status of American health care.\n\nLISTEN:\n\nOrtiz replied. \u201cBecause of Obamacare, about a third of small businesses had to drop their healthcare coverage for their employees because it just got too expensive. They just couldn\u2019t afford it anymore.\u201d He said, \u201cabout 52 percent of doctors are now in employee positions\u201d as a result of increasing centralization of health care. Employee doctors are generally beholden to \u201cbig medicine,\u201d he added, and are \u201ceffectively \u2026 not allowed to tell the truth\u201d about the politics of the medical industry.\n\nBarbour addressed the Affordable Care and Patient Protection Act, otherwise known as \u201cObamacare.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we had the implementation of [Obamacare], we fundamentally altered the doctor-patient relationship, and bureaucrats and red tape were purposely inserted between patients and the access and ownership of their health care and has made it impossible for people to access the healthcare system when they need it,\u201d Barbour explained. \u201cFundamentally, this is part of the rationing technique.\u201d\n\nBarbour described the health care industry\u2019s leftward momentum over the past decades towards increasing government control over healthcare resource distribution.\n\n\u201cI got into this business twenty years ago,\u201d recalled Barbour. \u201cI remember doctors talking to me when I was coming up, saying, \u2018Boy, medicine has changed so much for the worse,\u2019 and then with the implementation of the current system, it really just took a nosedive. Just in the course of my career, I\u2019ve seen how the relationship between doctors and patients has shifted so that doctors\u2019 fidelity is primarily to the hospital system that employs them and away from patients.\u201d\n\nPerformance metrics for doctors are largely government-run bureaucratic evaluations, lamented Barbour, noting how centrally planned assessments lack the flexibility to adapt to unique medical circumstances while pressuring doctors to adjust their prescribed treatments to fit bureaucratic demands.\n\n\u201cDoctors now are evaluated by their so-called performance, and I say \u2018performance\u2019 because it\u2019s not a real measure. It\u2019s the measure of a bureaucrat,\u201d said Barbour. \u201cIf a doctor readmits a patient within 30 days after discharge from a hospital, that\u2019s going to be a knock against that doctor and it\u2019s going to affect their reimbursement. If a doctor has a bad outcome \u2014 say, an infection \u2014 that\u2019s going to be a knock against that doctor. So what it does is create these perverse incentives where doctors will either keep patients in a hospital too long for fear of releasing them, and they\u2019ll be back in 30 days. Or, if they do release them, they do everything in their power to prevent that patient from coming back to the hospital, whether it\u2019s necessary or not.\u201d\n\nBarbour added, \u201cThe other thing is when doctors come across patients who are sick \u2014 maybe they\u2019re a smoker or have diabetes \u2014 they may decide different treatment because they\u2019re worried if they do something more aggressive, they\u2019re going to get a negative outcome.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just really need to put the ownership of medicine back in the hands of patients and give them the freedom to choose their doctors and their health care when they need it,\u201d determined Barbour. \u201cWe want patients to \u2026 spend money on only the things that they consume, only the hospital or healthcare resources they consume. \u2026 These largely free market solutions are going to bring down the cost of health care and give patients the most choice, affordability, and the quality of health care is going to be maintained.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother thing we\u2019ve seen over the last 20 years is that the quality of health care has just deteriorated so much,\u201d assessed Barbour.\n\nPolitical discussion regarding Obamacare \u201cnever\u201d examined the policy\u2019s effects on the quality of health care, remarked Marlow. \u201cDid health care get better [with Obamacare]? \u2026 Why did no one ask this?\u201d\n\nBarbour replied, \u201cIt got much worse. \u2026 The direction we\u2019re going rations our healthcare system.\u201d Medical students are \u201clearning how to do electronic medical records so that we can do effective coding and billing and collect metadata for bureaucrats,\u201d he added. \u201cThis has got to stop. We have got to get back to nurture the doctor-patient relationship and putting the decision-making between doctors and patients.\u201d\n\nOrtiz observed, \u201cDemocrats are looking at trying to do single-payer [health care], with the Biden plan, and that\u2019s what we need to be very, very afraid of because \u2026 it\u2019s going to get worse and worse, and this glorified socialized medicine that they talk about is just going to continue to get worse and worse in our country.\u201d\n\nBarbour said, \u201cI feel very fortunate. I got into this game at the last minute and was able, through my own personal experiences, to build a practice. I am somewhat free of the big medicine \u2014 not totally \u2014 but I have a level of independence that a lot of [other doctors] don\u2019t have. I could never be me today because of so many regulations at the state level and federal level designed to choke out the supply of doctors so that this big medicine can control the supply, and they do this for profits.\u201d\n\nPoliticians and bureaucrats advocating for centrally-planned health care want Americans \u201cbegging\u201d them \u201cfor rationed health care,\u201d Barbour arraigned.\n\n\u201cIf we have one more cycle where we fail to reform our health care in a proper direction, you\u2019re going to see the extinction of the doctor-patient relationship,\u201d warned Barbour.\n\nBreitbart News Daily broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.", "description": "\"If we have one more cycle where we fail to reform our health care,\" the \"doctor-patient relationship\" will die, warned Dr. Scott Barbour.", "authors": ["Robert Kraychik"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/06/doctor-hospital-bills-getty.jpg"}
