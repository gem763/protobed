In six states at least, members of civil society had become targets, Citizen Lab says.\n\nAnd increasingly, companies like NSO have been used as a diplomatic sales pitch to Israeli neighbours in the Middle East and the Gulf.\n\nWhile Israel has no formal diplomatic relations with its Gulf Arab neighbours like Saudi Arabia, the two sides have drawn increasingly close in recent years and are cooperating on a range of security issues.\n\nThe relationship is driven partly by their shared opposition to Iran. But it is also fueled by the Arab states\u2019 interest in acquiring Israeli security technology like NSO\u2019s spyware, which they see as a powerful tool against terrorists but also political dissidents.\n\nThe company does not deny that it provides its services to Saudi Arabia, although it says strenuously that its technology was not used against Jamal Khashoggi, the Washington Post journalist murdered by Saudi operatives last year.\n\nHowever, Saudi intelligence agencies armed with NSO spyware appear to have gone after several of Khashoggi\u2019s associates. Among them is believed to be Iyad el-Baghdadi, an Arab freedom activist. The CIA recently warned that Mr Baghdadi was being targeted by Saudi Arabia.", "description": "For campaigners and lawyers targeted by nation state cyber surveillance, the watchful eye of an authoritarian regime can feel impossible to escape.", "authors": ["Matthew Field", "Hasan Chowdhury", "Raf Sanchez", "Tom Hoggins", "Hannah Betts"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/technology/2016/01/25/WhatsApp-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwfSVWeZ_vEN7c6bHu2jJnT8.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-05-14"}
