But if the match is cancelled they will be going home.\n\nOfficials are not expected to make a final decision on that match until Sunday morning, after they have assessed potential damage to the venue and transport links.\n\nOfficials on alert\n\nJapanese officials said they were on alert, with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe ordering officials to \"take every possible measure to ensure people's safety\", Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters.\n\nThe storm is expected to cause transport chaos over a holiday weekend in Japan, with many forced to cancel travel plans.\n\nJapanese airlines have cancelled more than 1 630 domestic flights and some 260 international flights on Saturday, NHK said.\n\nAnd the operator of the main bullet train service linking Tokyo and western cities said it would suspend all services between the capital and Nagoya on Saturday.\n\nOperators of trains serving the capital also announced complete or partial service suspensions starting from Saturday morning.\n\nThe storm will even force the first-ever all-day typhoon closure of Tokyo's Disneyland and DisneySea theme parks, with doors shut from Saturday until at least noon on Sunday, a spokesman for their operator Oriental Land told AFP.\n\nJapan is hit by around 20 typhoons a year, though the capital is not usually badly affected.\n\nHagibis is bearing down on the region just weeks after another powerful storm, Typhoon Faxai, hit the area with similar strength, killing two and causing major damage in Chiba, east of the capital.\n\nMore than 36 000 homes were damaged or destroyed in Chiba, and the local government has urged those in damaged buildings to take shelter elsewhere during the storm.\n\nLocal officials equipped with satellite phones will be dispatched across the region to ensure communities can seek help during and after the storm.", "description": "Japan braces for a powerful typhoon barrelling towards Tokyo that has already forced the cancellation of two Rugby World Cup matches, disrupted the Suzuka Grand Prix and grounded flights.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9466/5fc314ff272f4b06b85d5d2876089755.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
