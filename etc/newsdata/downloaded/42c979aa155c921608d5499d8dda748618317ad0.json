It means that the average Grand Design goes over budget by 34 per cent, the equivalent of \u00a3124,357.\n\nThe research painstakingly analysed all 124 Grand Designs projects since the TV show began in April 1999.\n\nThe research did not take into account house price inflation, with \u00a3100,000 in 1999 being worth \u00a3320,000 today, according to Nationwide Building Society.\n\nHowever, the percentages were calculated using the information at the time of the build.\n\nThe Grand Designs project on the Isle of Wight is currently on the market for \u00a32,949,999\n\nThe luxury house on the Isle of Wight is the home of couple Bram and Lisa Vis\n\nThe couple spent an eye-watering \u00a31.35m more than originally planned on the project\n\nThe most over budget property was the home of of Bram and Lisa Vis, who spent an eye-watering \u00a31.35million more than originally planned.\n\nThe couple built an ultra-modern property with six bedrooms on the Isle of Wight. It was completed in 2014, and featured on Channel 4's Grand Designs the following year.\n\nThe property is currently for sale for \u00a32,949,999, having seen its asking price drop from the original price tag of \u00a33.95million.\n\nGrand Designs has been on our TV screens for two decades, with the first programme being in 1999\n\nThe couple's original budget was \u00a3835,000. This was to cover the cost of the build and did not cover the cost of the land that came with its own private beach.\n\nThe finished cost of the build was significantly more - in fact, almost three times as much - at \u00a32.2million.\n\nAdd in the \u00a3935,000 cost of the land and the owners suggested the property cost a total of '\u00a33.2million to \u00a33.3million'.\n\nThe Isle of Wight project cost \u00a32.2m to complete the build, plus the \u00a3935,000 cost of the land\n\nBy contrast, the most under budget Grand Designs project was the Floating House in series 14 that went under budget by \u00a3100,000.\n\nThe majority of houses in the show cost significantly less to complete, with 22 projects being between \u00a3200,000 and \u00a3299,000. A further 19 houses were built between the \u00a3100,000 and \u00a3199,999 mark.\n\nThe most under budget Grand Designs project was the Floating House that underspent by \u00a3100,000\n\nPictured: Grand Designs presenter Kevin McCloud visits the completed Floating House\n\nOn average, a completed Grand Designs house goes on the market at \u00a31.29million, according to the research by Mojo Mortgages.\n\nThe Town House in London had the biggest difference between the build and for sale price. It cost \u00a3700,000 to build and had an asking price of \u00a33.95million.\n\nThe research did not stipulate for each property if the cost was only for the build or for the cost of the land as well.\n\nThe average Grand Designs project takes 17 months to build, with 47 houses completed in less than a year, analysis shows.\n\nThe average Grand Designs project takes 17 months to build, with 47 houses completed in less than a year\n\nRichard Hayes, chief executive of Mojo Mortgages, said: 'As Grand Designs is one of the nation's favourite property programmes, we wanted to celebrate its 20th anniversary by revealing some fan-favourite statistics.\n\n'There was more than 120 hours of footage to examine and we discovered who goes over budget the most .\n\n'We love the passion and excitement the self-builders bring to the property scene and we hope this research shows that building your own Grand Design is more than possible.\n\n'Most people tend to go over budget by 30 per cent, but we've also noticed a large amount of grand designs that have been built within a reasonable budget.'", "description": "As Grand Designs celebrates its 20th birthday, new research reveals 80 per cent of all projects on the TV show went over budget.", "authors": ["Myra Butterworth For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/07/24/13/16437426-0-image-a-12_1563969719895.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-29"}
