His mom agreed to donate his umbilical-cord blood, and for several years his cells lay frozen in a cord-blood bank in New York. Meanwhile, hundreds of miles away in Chicago, a 24-year-old Becker started getting fevers and night sweats and extreme fatigue\u2014symptoms, it turned out, of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, a cancer that affects white blood cells. She went through multiple rounds of chemo. They all failed. \u201cI was literally at the point where I was about to die,\u201d she says. That\u2019s when her doctor suggested a then-novel transplant involving cord blood from a stranger.\n\nUmbilical cords are rich in hematopoietic stem cells, which ultimately give rise to all different types of blood cells. To do the transplant, doctors would destroy Becker\u2019s own cancerous cells before infusing her with hematopoietic stem cells from a healthy matched donor. Those cells would eventually divide to replace all the blood in her. It was a grueling procedure, and Becker did not fully recover for two years. But she has stayed healthy ever since, and she has always wondered over the years about the anonymous donor who saved her life. Her doctor told her the donor was untraceable. That\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to work.\n\nAnd when Becker finally spit into a tube for her AncestryDNA test, she was not trying to find her donor; she did not even know that was possible. She was just interested in her family history. But the test matched her to Patrick\u2019s mom, Dania Davey, who immediately messaged Becker when she saw a new and very close match\u2014so close as to be mother or daughter. Davey, who is adopted, had recently found her birth family through AncestryDNA, and this new match made no sense. She knew her birth mother. She certainly knew Becker was not her daughter. They both thought the test was wrong.\n\nBut Becker wondered about the transplant. She asked Davey whether she was from New York\u2014because that was the only fact she knew about her cord-blood donor. Davey said yes. When Becker shared her hypothesis with her oncologist at Loyola Medicine, Patrick Stiff, he was initially skeptical. Transplants with hematopoietic stem cells\u2014which can come from cord blood, as in Becker\u2019s case, or from bone marrow\u2014should only alter the blood cells in her body. The rest of her would still be her. Why would DNA in Becker\u2019s saliva match her donor\u2019s? (On the other hand, blood transfusions do not involve killing off the recipient\u2019s blood cells and have only tiny, transient effects on the recipient\u2019s DNA.)\n\nRead: When a DNA test reveals your daughter is not your biological child\n\nThen, Stiff told me, he heard from yet another transplant patient, who spit into an AncestryDNA tube and got strange results. The DNA in saliva, it turns out, can come from cells in the cheek lining (which should have the recipient\u2019s DNA) and from white blood cells (which should have the donor\u2019s DNA) that guard against bacteria in the mouth. AncestryDNA and 23andMe actually advise customers who have had bone-marrow or cord-blood transplants against taking their tests, as the mix of genetic material can cause them to fail. Often enough, though, the tests return the genetic results of the donor. Many bone-marrow recipients have gotten their donors\u2019 DNA results, and Stiff said he knew of at least one other unpublicized case of a cord-blood recipient who found their donor.", "description": "For two decades, she had lived with someone else\u2019s DNA inside her.", "authors": ["Sarah Zhang"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/PhotosForSarah-1/facebook.jpg?1568369415", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
