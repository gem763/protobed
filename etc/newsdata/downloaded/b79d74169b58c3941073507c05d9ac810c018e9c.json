Video of the incident spread widely online, precipitating protests against police violence and calls for greater police accountability. The NYPD official responsible for training recruits said Pantaleo used a chokehold, an illegal tactic banned since the 1990s, to restrain Garner.\n\n\u201cEric cried out 11 times, \u2018I can\u2019t breathe,\u2019\u201d Carr said Thursday. \u201cBut those officers who were on the scene that day, they didn\u2019t seem to care.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re about to testify in front of the House Judiciary Committee. #PoliceOversightHearing\n\nFor too long communities across the country have lived under the weight of discriminatory policing and we\u2019re calling for a transformation of our policing and criminal justice systems. pic.twitter.com/mlSRfgkctd \u2014 Reverend Al Sharpton (@TheRevAl) September 19, 2019\n\nIn July, Rev. Al Sharpton successfully petitioned Judiciary Committee chair Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) for a hearing on police misconduct. Sharpton met with several New York lawmakers following the Justice Department\u2019s announcement this summer that Pantaleo wouldn\u2019t face federal charges.\n\nOn Thursday, Carr questioned why neither Pantaleo nor any of the officers who witnessed the incident have been charged for her son\u2019s death. Attorney General William Barr decided in July not to bring charges against Pantaleo, despite a recommendation from the Justice Department\u2019s own civil rights division that the case move forward.\n\n\u201cAll the officers who were on the scene need to stand accountable for his death that day,\u201d Carr said.\n\nShe urged Congress to support the Excessive Use of Force Prevention Act \u2015 a 2015 bill introduced by Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) that would outlaw chokeholds under federal civil rights law \u2015 when it is reintroduced to Congress later this year.\n\nCarr also used some of her time to describe the trauma Garner\u2019s death wrought upon her family. Carr\u2019s husband, Ben Carr, died two months prior to Thursday\u2019s hearing.\n\n\u201cHe was my partner in every sense of the word,\u201d she said. \u201cHe fought the long fight with me.\u201d\n\nErica Garner, Eric Garner\u2019s daughter, died in 2017 at age 27 after a heart attack. She\u2019d spent three years demanding justice for her father.\n\n\u201cShe fought until she became ill,\u201d Carr said of Erica. \u201cI say she died of a broken heart.\u201d\n\nThursday\u2019s hearing featured participants from different backgrounds and with various political leanings. Sharpton, a longtime advocate for criminal justice reform, sat alongside Patrick Yoes, national president of the Fraternal Order of Police, who has said the decision to fire Pantaleo for choking Garner amounted to \u201cpolitical expediency.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor too long communities across the country have lived under the weight of discriminatory policing and we\u2019re calling for a transformation of our policing and criminal justice systems,\u201d Sharpton tweeted on Thursday.\n\nDuring President Donald Trump\u2019s time in office, many police reform measures instituted under President Barack Obama have been abandoned or curtailed. The Justice Department has sought to nullify consent decrees requiring local police departments to make their practices more equitable, and it has shrunk the size of the policing unit within DOJ\u2019s civil rights division.", "description": "Gwen Carr testified Thursday as part of a hearing on police practices and their effects on communities around the country.", "authors": ["Associate Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d83b8b624000012277ea05f.jpeg?cache=9cticc3irw&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
