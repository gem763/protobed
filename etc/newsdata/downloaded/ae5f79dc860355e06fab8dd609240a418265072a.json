Photo: Joan Marcus\n\nWhat exactly is The Rose Tattoo, anyway? Read the reviews of the original Broadway production from 1951, and it sounds as though Tennessee Williams\u2014just off the high-impact successes of A Streetcar Named Desire and Summer and Smoke\u2014has implausibly written a fluffy romantic comedy. Watch the trailer for the 1955 film with Anna Magnani, sold as a \u201cfiery drama,\u201d and you\u2019d barely know there was a lick of humor in it (though the movie itself does have some playful moments). Most productions since then seem to have tipped one way or the other, and the Roundabout\u2019s new one, starring Marisa Tomei, tries to split the difference, to limited success.\n\nThe gap between these two interpretations is on view in the stage design, even before anyone speaks. The setting is a small town on the Gulf Coast circa 1950, and video projections of low waves supply the backdrop, their crisp edges suggesting that the play is being cooled down and deconstructed. But right in front of them stands a field of a couple of hundred pink plastic flamingos, the kind with wire legs that are associated with aqua trailer homes. Before the action begins and after it ends, Louis Prima records play on the sound system. So are we to think big thoughts about the Endless Sea, or is this a sort of kitschy John Waters universe, or are we in the 1950s of Carbone and Scorsese? That tonal incoherence remains on view throughout the evening.\n\nAt its beginning, Serafina, a young Sicilian immigrant woman, is besotted with her truck-driver husband, with whom she has a 12-year-old daughter. She\u2019s a lusty, earthy Italian with a heavy accent, a mid-century archetype that is, in its way, pretty similar to the Southern-gothic types that Williams loved to write. Pretty soon, she gets the news that her husband is dead, and then that he may not have been faithful to her, and she begins to disintegrate. \u201cThree Years Later,\u201d a projected supertitle soon tells us, and she\u2019s now looking bedraggled, with a daughter who\u2019s a little ashamed of her and neighbor ladies who clack their tongues, when a new man, Alvaro, begins to take an interest in her. Their flirtations constitute the main case for The Rose Tattoo as a romcom.\n\nI should say right here that the lack of consistency undermining the show is baked into Williams\u2019s script. Several scenes involving Serafina\u2019s daughter are written as dead-serious melodrama, and a dramatic turn of the second act involving Alvaro\u2019s romantic intentions was outr\u00e9 in its day. The drama, though, roughly alternates with scenes that are played for laughs, some of them nearly as slapstick. The director, Trip Cullman, appears to have actively played up those disparities rather than modulating them, and the whipsaw changes in mood have a way of knocking you right out of the play. Several peripheral characters, too\u2014notably a woman who slinks in from the neighboring town named Estelle Hohengarten, played with deadpan wit by Tina Benko\u2014are stylized in such different (albeit interesting) ways that they seem to be in another show entirely.\n\nTomei is at the center of virtually every scene, and she does seem to get Serafina\u2019s tough-gal-with-heart vibe. (Which makes sense, perhaps, given that she is an Italian-American from Midwood with Sicilian roots of her own\u2014remember how good she was as Mona Lisa?) But she, too, gets tugged in two directions, whether by director or playwright, and compensates by going big and broad with whatever she\u2019s got. When her character is flirting with Alvaro, Tomei plays the lines just shy of sitcom-level, pausing a beat to get the laugh, delivering some almost as winking asides to the audience. When Serafina is in agony over her dead husband, she\u2019s keening and thrashing, her emotional throttle all the way open.\n\nNone of this, mind you, is a total mess. Individual scenes are affecting, Tomei can toss off a funny line with the best of them, and you are, by the end, rooting for Serafina to find happiness again. Ella Rubin, as her daughter, Rosa, has an unexpectedly modern role to play\u2014she\u2019s a teenager of 15 who really wants to get with her reticent older boyfriend\u2014and she too has stage presence to burn. Tomei looks great, and the costuming does well by everyone. (The script includes a few remarks about the degree to which Serafina has gone to seed, but you\u2019ll just have to take that on faith.) And when the village ladies perform Italian songs that waft through breaks in the action, they\u2019re lovely, particularly as the projected surf crashes in the background. But I found myself asking a fundamental question at the end of the evening: Why do this of all plays? Is bringing back a relatively minor, semi-interesting play at enormous scale\u2014even one by an acknowledged master, even with an interesting actor at the center, even at a high level of technical polish\u2014the best use of time and resources? It doesn\u2019t have that much to say about our moment, and it\u2019s not a play that\u2019s dramatically revelatory about the human condition. What does that leave? I suspect that the answer lies in leaving a play like this to smaller venues, where it can perhaps be pulled or pushed in some wildly unexpected, revitalizing direction.\n\nThe Rose Tattoo is at the American Airlines Theatre through December 8.", "description": "Theater Review: Marisa Tomei in Tennessee Williams\u2019s The Rose Tattoo, Revived on Broadway by the Roundabout Theatre Company", "authors": ["Christopher Bonanos"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/15/15-rose-tattoo.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
