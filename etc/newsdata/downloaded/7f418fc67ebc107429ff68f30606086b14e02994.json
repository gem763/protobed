The single mother then vanished and was later found a mile away from the plant brutally murdered and left in the trunk of her car.\n\nHer murder began a year-long investigation in which the lead detective was accused of tampering with evidence as he pursued three innocent people while the real killer walked free.\n\nOne of Detective Sean O'Connell's suspects was a woman who lived near where Heather's body was found\u2026But O'Connell ignored exculpatory evidence, says Sandusky County Sheriff Chris Hilton.\n\n\"He attempted to indict people for murder that had absolutely nothing to do with it,\" Hilton tells CBS News chief investigative and senior national correspondent Jim Axelrod\n\nBefore it was over, the detective would find himself behind bars. It would take a dedicated sheriff to find a real suspect.\n\n\"I knew it was a solvable case. I just knew it had to be done right,\" says Hilton. \"I said we are going to open this up to the point where it just happened. Every lead, every person, everybody is a suspect until we can eliminate them. And that's what we did.\"\n\nA SAVAGE KILLING\n\nSheriff Chris Hilton: A lot of times in law enforcement, we look at things and we try not to see them for what they are. \u2026 It's almost as if it's not real.\n\nBut this one was different says Sandusky County Sheriff Chris Hilton. What they found inside the trunk of Heather Bogle's car was painfully real.\n\nJim Axelrod: What did they find in the trunk?\n\nSheriff Chris Hilton: They found a beautiful, young woman who had been savagely beaten and murdered.\n\nHeather Bogle Facebook\n\nThat beautiful young woman was Heather Bogle.\n\nSheriff Chris Hilton When you know what she looked like when you saw the pictures of her and to see what was in the trunk of the car it was as if they were two completely different things. And when you look at that kind of stuff, it \u2013 it sinks in. It hits home.\n\nHer wounds told a harrowing story of torture and grit, says prosecutor Tim Braun.\n\n\n\nProsecutor Tim Braun: Unbelievably awful.\n\nProsecutor Tim Braun: A lot of defensive wounds on the hand from blocking, bringing her hands up, protecting.\n\nJim Axelrod: What did that tell you?\n\nProsecutor Tim Braun: Told me she had fought, that she was physically overpowered by someone, beaten down and then handcuffed.\n\nJim Axelrod: Cause of death?\n\nProsecutor Tim Braun: Two shots to the back, penetrating vital organs in her chest.\n\nHeather's body was placed in the trunk of her car curled up in a semi-fetal position, wearing an oversized Mickey Mouse T-shirt.\n\nProsecutor Tim Braun: Looked like it had been posed to create a certain effect. Her hands were coiled up. It looked like a child sleeping to some degree.\n\nHeather's hair had been chopped off at the scalp.\n\nSheriff Chris Hilton: Imagine taking like a pocket knife and \u2026 just picking it up and chopping it off.\n\nAnd her fingernails cut down to the cuticles \u2014 possibly her murderer's attempt to destroy DNA, says Braun.\n\nProsecutor Tim Braun: So, somebody had cleaned her up extremely carefully after she died.\n\nJim Axelrod: Who would want to do this to her?\n\nProsecutor Tim Braun: A psychopath.\n\nShocked, frightened, and grief-struck, the locals turned out in droves \u2013 demanding justice for Heather Bogle and holding benefits for her 5-year-old daughter McKenzie.\n\nHeather Bogle, highlighted at right, was last seen on security video as she left her overnight shift at the Whirlpool plant in Clyde, Ohio. She clocked out at approximately 6:17 a.m. Sandusky County Sheriff's Office\n\nJim Axelrod: The woman who walks out of the Whirlpool factory at 6:17 a.m., Heather Bogle, who is she?\n\nSheriff Chris Hilton: A 28-year-old single mother who worked hard at that factory to provide a wonderful life for her daughter. She was well-liked.\n\nWith dreams for a better life. Heather had just finished nursing school.\n\nSheriff Chris Hilton: She wanted something better than working at Whirlpool \u2026 not that Whirlpool's bad \u2026 But she wanted some more for herself and for her daughter.\n\nBut the days leading up to her death were fraught with tension. She had just failed her nursing board exams and was in the midst of an ugly breakup. For the past year, Heather had been involved in her first same-sex relationship, with a woman she met at Whirlpool, Carmella Badillo. But they'd just had a big blowup.\n\nJim Axelrod: There had been threats made, hadn't there been?\n\nSheriff Chris Hilton Yeah, there had been. Yes, the text messages and the phone calls and some of the exchanges were very, very nasty.\n\nLead Detective Sean O'Connell says Badillo was one of the first people he looked at.\n\nDet. Sean O'Connell: There was some type of a verbal altercation between Heather and her girlfriend Carmella that Wednesday. Heather goes in to work on Wednesday evening and leaves work Thursday morning not to be seen.\n\nBut after examining Badillo's phone records and speaking to her several times, O'Connell determined Carmella was not the killer.\n\nJim Axelrod: You are comfortable ruling her out?\n\nDet. Sean O'Connell: Absolutely.\n\nHe was not so quick to rule out Keyona Bor, a single mother who lived in the apartment complex where Heather's car and body were discovered.\n\nJim Axelrod: Is it fair to say that your interactions with Keyona Bor, early on, raised your suspicion about her?\n\nDet. Sean O'Connell: Absolutely, absolutely. Yeah, from her demeanor, from her reluctancy, not wanting to talk to us \u2026 absolutely.\n\nBut even more than that, it was that Mickey Mouse shirt on Heather Bogle's body.\n\nDet. Sean O'Connell: There are some speculation that the shirt that was found on Heather Bogle \u2026 again it's a red XL Mickey Mouse type T-shirt \u2026 Keyona Bor was seen to be wearing that same type of T-shirt.\n\nAnd he says her Facebook postings read like a confession, as referenced in the police report.\n\nDet. Sean O'Connell: Keyona is making statements on her Facebook page that I can't believe what happened, just happened.\n\nO'Connell says she makes mention in another post about doing 8 to 10 years for murder and pleading insanity.\n\nJim Axelrod: The day Heather disappears.\n\nDet. Sean O'Connell: The day that she disappeared, yes, April 9, 2015.\n\nHe says he became even more suspicious when he learned that Omar Satchel \u2013 a man who served time on home invasion and firearms charges \u2013 was in Keyona's apartment the night Heather's body was found.\n\nJim Axelrod: Omar Satchel very quickly becomes a person of interest to you.\n\nDet. Sean O'Connell: He did.\n\nJim Axelrod: Why?\n\nDet. Sean O'Connell: Because of his involvement as far as being on in the vicinity of the time of her body being discovered.\n\nO'Connell believed Omar knew Heather \u2013 that he sometimes sold her pot. But even more importantly, O'Connell says he found a link between Omar Satchell and what possibly could have been the gun used to kill Heather.\n\nDet. Sean O'Connell: During the course of my investigation, I find out that Omar may have stolen a small caliber-type firearm.\n\nNeither the gun nor the bullets were ever found, but O'Connell claims a source told him that a third accomplice \u2013 a friend of Omar's named Kayree Jeffrey, dumped the murder weapon.\n\nDet. Sean O'Connell: So according to my source who was standing next to Kayree \u2026 Kayree walked up along the river banks and tossed his black bag containing the firearm used in a homicide into the river, which ultimately prompt us to launch a dive team into the river in hopes to recover the bag.\n\nJim Axelrod: Came up empty.\n\nDet. Sean O'Connell: Came up empty.\n\nJim Axelrod: So, what would the three of these people have as a motive to kill Heather Bogle?\n\nDet. Sean O'Connell: I don't know what their motive would have been.\n\nDet. Sean O'Connell didn't have enough to arrest them but continued building his murder case against Omar Satchel, Keyona Bor and Kayree Jeffrey. Facebook/Keyona Bor/Sandusky County Jail\n\nO'Connell didn't have enough to arrest them but continued building his murder case against the three \u2014 a case newspaperman Matt Westerhold was watching with interest. He and his paper had a long history reporting on the detective.\n\nMatt Westerhold | Managing editor, Sandusky Register: We were concerned because we didn't believe Detective O'Connell could conduct a legitimate investigation.\n\nWesterhold had just found his next big story.\n\nJim Axelrod: Was this bad police work or was he a bad cop?\n\nMatt Westerhold: There was both.\n\n\n\n\n\nA FIGHT FOR THE TRUTH\n\nThere was Keyona Bor before Heather Bogle's murder.\n\nKeyona Bor: Got a house for me and my kids, got a good job at a nursing home, and everything was going real smooth.\n\nAnd then there is Keyona Bor now.\n\nKeyona Bor: So, it's like the dark cloud that's always over my head.\n\nJim Axelrod: And who put that dark cloud over your head?\n\nKeyona Bor: Sean O'Connell.\n\nKeyona says Detective O'Connell targeted her from the night Heather Bogle's body was found \u2014 raiding her apartment \u2026\n\nKeyona Bor [pointing to a dumpster outside the apartment]: They went out of their way to throw all of our pictures in the trash \u2026\n\n\u2026 and storming the nursing home where she worked with a warrant for her DNA.\n\nKeyona Bor: I'm wheeling a resident \u2026 out the dining room to go get him ready for bed and \u2026 the whole \u2014 all the detectives, the police come in there, guns out.\n\nJim Axelrod: And they had their guns drawn?\n\nKeyona Bor: Yes.\n\nO'Connell publicly named Keyona a suspect. She lost her job, her apartment, and her reputation.\n\nKeyona Bor: I had to keep my son outta school \u2026 I have people in my inbox telling me I'm a monster \u2026 me and my kids deserve to die and all type of stuff because what he told the newspaper, and the newspaper put out there.\n\nKeyona says she was an easy target: poor, black, and voiceless. She says O'Connell never even asked her if she had an alibi.\n\nKeyona Bor: He never did that because he wasn't interested in ruling me out. He was just interested in making me guilty.\n\nJim Axelrod: He was trying to find facts that would fit his theory that you were involved?\n\nKeyona Bor: Correct.\n\nAfter Det. Sean O'Connell publicly named Keyona Bor as a suspect, she says she lost her job, her apartment, and her reputation. CBS News\n\nKeyona had several run-ins with Sean O'Connell before. He helped put her ex-boyfriend in prison for a mandatory 10 years on a drug charge. She says that's what she was talking about in her Facebook post that O'Connell found so incriminating.\n\nKeyona Bor: The only reason why I posted about the 8 to 10 years is because I was upset that my child's father just got 10 years mandatory for his first drug offense.\n\nJim Axelrod: Here he is doing 10 years for a drug offense and there're people who get 8 to 10 for murder by pleading insanity. That's what you were posting?\n\nKeyona Bor: Correct.\n\nJim Axelrod: And it didn't have anything to do \u2014\n\nKeyona Bor: Nothing at all.\n\nJim Axelrod: \u2014 with Heather Bogle?\n\nKeyona Bor: No.\n\nAnd that Mickey Mouse shirt found on Heather's body? The one he insinuated belonged to Keyona?\n\nJim Axelrod: Was it your shirt?\n\nKeyona Bor: No. \u2026 I only owned one Mickey Mouse hoodie. Well, sweatshirt. In my life.\n\nJim Axelrod: So, it's a sweatshirt not a T-shirt? You don't own a T-shirt?\n\nKeyona Bor: No.\n\nJim Axelrod: Were you involved in the death of Heather Bogle?\n\nKeyona Bor: No.\n\nJim Axelrod: Did you cover up, have any role in covering up Heather Bogle's death?\n\nKeyona Bor: No.\n\nDesperate to clear her name, Keyona contacted Matt Westerhold, managing editor of the Sandusky Register.\n\nMatt Westerhold: I've never had a criminal suspect come to me and say, \"Hey I'm being targeted by police for a murder I didn't commit.\" That's never happened.\n\nHe quickly came to believe O'Connell was framing her.\n\nMatt Westerhold: If you interview Keyona Bor she's very believable and it seemed obvious that, you know, she didn't know anything about this.\n\nWesterhold had been covering Sean O'Connell and his then-boss, former Sheriff Eric Overmyer, for years, publishing numerous reports accusing them of corruption and incompetence.\n\nJim Axelrod: One headline that \u2026 the paper ran \u2014 the headline is \u2026 \"Sheriff Overmyer and Detective O'Connell have a history botching high-profile cases.\"\n\nMatt Westerhold: Right.\n\nJim Axelrod: Fair headline?\n\nMatt Westerhold: Yeah, absolutely \u2026 We probably documented a half dozen different cases where the families involved, you know, were complaining bitterly about how they were treated by law enforcement. \u2026 and there was no doubt in my mind that they were botching these investigations.\n\nWesterhold featured Keyona's story on his webcast several times:\n\nMATT WESTERHOLD: Do you consider yourself a victim of Detective O'Connell's? KEYONA BOR: I very much do.\n\nHe was determined to keep the pressure on O'Connell.\n\nMatt Westerhold: We like to say that's who we are that's what we do \u2026 In this case we turned out to be a consistent, persistent watchdog that didn't give up.\n\nDespite the public scrutiny, O'Connell spent a year and two months pursuing his theory that Keyona, Omar, and Kayree acted together to kill Heather Bogle \u2013 even in the face of strong scientific evidence to the contrary. Authorities found DNA under Heather's cuticle they believed was left by her killer.\n\nJim Axelrod: But it didn't come back as Omar Satchel's.\n\nDet. Sean O'Connell: It did not.\n\nJim Axelrod: Didn't come back as Keyona Bor's?\n\nDet. Sean O'Connell: It did not.\n\nJim Axelrod: Didn't come back as Kayree Jeffery's?\n\nDet. Sean O'Connell: It did not.\n\nJim Axelrod: So, the fact that the DNA under her fingernails does not belong to any of those three, doesn't rule them out in your mind?\n\nDet. Sean O'Connell: It does not.\n\nBut in his report to the prosecutor seeking an indictment, O'Connell didn't even mention that the DNA did not match \u2014 an omission that would soon come out in the open. Just one week later, Detective O'Connell was taken off the case and placed on leave.\n\nMatt Westerhold: I knew the end was coming \u2026 He was forced to resign \u2026\n\nHe wasn't the only one in trouble. Sheriff Overmyer was arrested and sent to prison for stealing drugs.\n\nJim Axelrod: Sounds to me like law enforcement in the Sandusky County Sheriff's Department not in tip top shape between Overmyer and O'Connell.\n\nMatt Westerhold: Well, yeah. If your sheriff who is the lead officer of your criminal drug task force has an addiction problem, you've got problems.\n\nO'Connell's Bogle file was handed over to the State Bureau of Investigation. What they discovered was not only shocking says Chris Hilton, who took over as sheriff \u2014 it was criminal.\n\nSheriff Chris Hilton: He attempted to indict people for murder that had absolutely nothing to do with it.\n\nJim Axelrod: Is this a case of a cop being overly ambitious? \u2026 Is this racism? Or is this incompetence?\n\nSheriff Chris Hilton: Anything I could say would be pure speculation.\n\nJim Axelrod: Nobody knows the case better than you. What do you think?\n\nSheriff Chris Hilton: I'm going to say it's a little combination of everything you just said.\n\nNewly-elected Sandusky County Prosecutor Tim Braun agreed. He opened a criminal investigation that led to O'Connell's arrest and Indictment on four felony charges.\n\nProsecutor Tim Braun \u2026 he lied. He falsified police reports. He tampered with evidence. He tried to make a case that he didn't have, and he tried to push it through.\n\nO'Connell was charged with misleading a public official and destroying, concealing, and tampering with evidence.\n\nA criminal investigation led to Detective Sean O'Connell's arrest and Indictment on four felony charges. He was charged with misleading a public official and destroying, concealing, and tampering with evidence. CBS News\n\nJim Axelrod: You're looking at some serious charges.\n\nSean O'Connell: I'm looking at some very serious charges.\n\nJim Axelrod: Did you mishandle evidence?\n\nSean O'Connell: Absolutely not.\n\nJim Axelrod: Do you knowingly make false statements?\n\nSean O'Connell: Absolutely not.\n\nJim Axelrod: Alter, destroy, conceal, or remove evidence?\n\nSean O'Connell: Of course not.\n\nJim Axelrod: So, where they are getting it from?\n\nDet. Sean O'Connell: They are getting it from speculation.\n\nThat's not how Chris Hilton sees it.\n\nJim Axelrod: Was there any reason to focus on Keyona Bor?\n\nSheriff Chris Hilton: After the first day or two, I would say no. She had nothing to do with it.\n\nAnd neither, he says, did Omar Satchel or Kayree Jeffrey. The BCI investigation showed the three suspects never knew Heather, never met Heather, never sold her pot. But Sean O'Connell still stands behind his investigation, right or wrong.\n\nJim Axelrod: So, you can be wrong, but that doesn't mean you had tunnel vision?\n\nSean O'Connell: I could be. Detectives are wrong all the time.\n\nJim Axelrod: You were just wrong.\n\nSean O'Connell: I'm not even here to say that I'm wrong because the investigation \u2014 I never had the opportunity to close out.\n\nThat job fell to the new sheriff, and he wasn't going to stop until he got it right.\n\nSheriff Chris Hilton: I knew it was a solvable case. I just knew it had to be done right. \u2026 I said we are going to open this up to the point where it just happened. Every lead, every person, everybody is a suspect until we can eliminate them. And that's what we did.\n\nZEROING IN ON A SUSPECT\n\n\n\n\n\nHeather Bogle had been dead for nearly two years when Sheriff Hilton and his team took over the investigation. They had no clue who killed her but were positive it was not a random killing.\n\n\"I knew it was a solvable case. I just knew it had to be done right,\" says Sheriff Chris Hilton. \"I said we are going to open this up to the point where it just happened. Every lead, every person, everybody is a suspect until we can eliminate them. And that's what we did.\" CBS News\n\nSheriff Chris Hilton: We felt that whoever did this had something personal against Heather.\n\nSomeone she'd just had a huge fight with. Someone who'd written her an angry note found in the car where she lay dead in the trunk. Someone like Heather's ex -girlfriend, Carmella Badillo.\n\nSheriff Chris Hilton: To me she would be a logical person to investigate. \u2026 I mean, again when you look at the condition with which Heather was found, there was passion and anger in what \u2014 whoever did that.\n\nBadillo, who'd been quickly cleared by O'Connell, went straight to the top of Hilton's suspect list. She was brought in for questioning:\n\nOFFICER: So, you guys are basically \u2014? CARMELLA BADILLO: I was done. OFFICER: Sounds like she was done, too. CARMELLA BADILLO: The last month I'll agree with everybody, it was f\u2014\u2014-g horrible. It was rocky. It was \u2014 you didn't know what was going to happen next.\n\nBut the sheriff would soon rule out Badillo when he found a new suspect. Investigators started digging through Heather's social media and Gmail accounts. And suddenly, there it was. Stored in Heather's GPS records by Google, an electronic trail of coordinates showing Heather's exact movements from the moment she left work at 6:17 a.m.\n\nJim Axelrod: Is this your aha moment?\n\nSheriff Chris Hilton: Absolutely \u2026 we had something we could at least say definitively. This is where she went after she left work that morning.\n\nAt 6:30 a.m. \u2013 13 minutes after leaving work, Heather's phone GPS places her in a trailer home a few miles from the Whirlpool plant.\n\nSheriff Chris Hilton: We find out later that day it belongs to Daniel Myers. Who is Daniel Myers? We have no idea at the time. We find out very quickly that Daniel Myers worked with Heather \u2026 We find out that he worked with her that night. We find out that he left approximately the same time that morning \u2026 That's when we went \"Aha. We got something.\"\n\nInvestigators knocked on Daniel Myers' door.\n\nSheriff Chris Hilton: He was cooperative but not overly \u2026 he kind of distanced himself from knowing Heather.\n\nThey recorded their conversation:\n\nINVESTIGATOR: Did you know her at all? DANIEL MYERS: Very, very little. Very little. Just more \u2014 Very \u2026 I mean very limited conversation.\n\nSheriff Chris Hilton: One of the things he says that \u2026 really makes the hairs stand up \u2026 Like why are you still investigating this? Is what he's asking. Like this is done. It's over with, it's been two years.\n\nDANIEL MYERS: I guess it's a little odd that, you know, you guys are \u2026 I know it's cold case and you guys are just, you know, grasping at straws trying to figure out.\n\nSheriff Chris Hilton: When I listened to it, I was like, \"Oh my God, this might be our guy. This might be our guy.\" And then the clincher was at the end of that interview, they asked for a DNA sample.\n\nDANIEL MYERS: I'm gonna to pass on that. I didn't really know the girl or anything like that.\n\nSheriff Chris Hilton: He is the first person that said no.\n\nInvestigators returned two days later with a warrant for his DNA, to match it against the DNA found under Heather's cuticle.\n\nINVESTIGATOR: We got a search warrant for your DNA. DANIEL MYERS: OK. INVESTIGATOR: So, what we wanted you to do is to be a little more forthcoming to help us narrow this thing down because, you know what? We're narrowing it down. DANIEL MYERS OK.\n\nThey got their sample. The results came back five days later.\n\nSheriff Chris Hilton: My major came into my office and he says, \"Sheriff, that DNA belongs to Danny Myers.\" I think we almost wanted to break into tears \u2026 It was like \"we have him, we got him.\"\n\nAuthorities discovered that Daniel Myers had contributed $125 to a Heather Bogle GoFundMe account after her death, along with this condolence note. Sandusky County Sheriff's Office\n\nThey learned this man who said he barely knew Heather Bogle had contributed $125 and wrote a warm condolence note on her GoFundMe page and made sure people knew he was at Heather's funeral.\n\nJim Axelrod: He signs the registry book at her funeral?\n\nSheriff Chris Hilton: Yes.\n\nProsecutor Tim Braun: It's the kind of guy who's trying to look normal. He's trying not to do anything that would trigger in anybody's mind that maybe Danny Myers is just a little different.\n\nIt turns out Daniel Myers had been hiding in plain sight all along. Shortly after Heather's murder, a Whirlpool employee sent an email to Detective Sean O'Connell saying she knew someone capable of this crime.\n\nSheriff Chris Hilton: And she point-blank told us \"I was going to tell him \u2013 I thought it was Daniel Myers.\"\n\nBut O'Connell \u2013 already fixated on his three suspects \u2013 never followed up.\n\nJim Axelrod: If you would have worked the Whirlpool angle little harder, do you think Daniel Myers' name might have surfaced?\n\nDet. Sean O'Connell: I don't know how we could have worked it any harder, I mean what more could we have done.\n\nIt didn't take Sheriff Hilton very long to figure it out. Just five months after opening the new investigation, he and his team arrested the single father at a summer campground.\n\nDaniel Myers was arrested after authorities linked his DNA to a trace amount found under Bogle's cuticle. Sandusky County Sheriff's Office\n\nSheriff Chris Hilton: The only thing that he ever said was, \"Oh my God, they're here to get me,\" and then we took him into custody and that was pretty much the last thing he said to us.\n\nINVESTIGATOR: I think you got a story to tell. And we'd like to hear it, OK? DANIEL MYERS: Sure.\n\nSearching the trailer, investigators never found the gun or bullets that killed Heather Bogle, but they did find damning evidence: new floorboards bought less than a week after her murder.\n\nJim Axelrod: Meaning what?\n\nSheriff Chris Hilton: Meaning we believe we found where she was murdered in his trailer.\n\nJim Axelrod: And he would have replaced the sub flooring because it was covered in blood?\n\nSheriff Chris Hilton: Blood. Possible bullet holes. Any number of reasons. You got to cover it up.\n\nThe trailer yielded other secrets.\n\nProsecutor Tim Braun: He liked to keep women's underwear in his safe.\n\nSlowly, they began piecing together a disturbing picture of a sexual predator \u2014 a man they say focused on control, domination and humiliation.\n\nSheriff Chris Hilton: He had videos of himself with women and other women \u2026 He was very disturbing when it comes to his sexual fetishes.\n\nAfter Daniel Myers' arrest, 10 women came forward saying he raped them.\n\nProsecutor Tim Braun: None of them went to the police beforehand and said \u2026 \"this guy at the plant sexually attacked me in his trailer.\" They were all embarrassed and ashamed by it.\n\nInvestigators say Myers picked women he thought would stay silent.\n\nSheriff Chris Hilton: And what better way to solidify that than to find ones that are vulnerable.\n\nAnd Heather Bogle was vulnerable. She was reeling over her nasty breakup with Badillo, and, they learned from Myers, she was also upset over a text her brother sent calling her \"too stupid\" to pass her licensed practical nursing exam.\n\nJim Axelrod: And here's Daniel Myers. \"Come tell me all about it.\"\n\nProsecutor Tim Braun: That's right.\n\nShe went to his trailer, says Braun, expecting a friend \u2014 but finding a killer.\n\nProsecutor Tim Braun: I think it happened immediately as soon as she came in the door \u2026 I think he came onto her sexually. She probably immediately rejected him. I think he grabbed her. I think she punched him in the face. We know he had one cracked tooth and one broken tooth that he repaired with super glue. And then I think he physically overpowered her, beat her into submission, handcuffed her, beat her some more. Stripped her. Probably had her on the bed and we know that 'cause he ends up replacing his mattress at the end of the month after the homicide occurred. And I think he tortured her for a long time. And then I think he shot and killed her.\n\nJim Axelrod: Do you think Danny Myers could be a serial killer?\n\nProsecutor Tim Braun: I've always considered that a possibility and a relatively strong one.\n\nHAS MYERS KILLED BEFORE?\n\nProsecutor Tim Braun has made a career of putting violent killers behind bars, and says Daniel Myers seems like pro.\n\nProsecutor Tim Braun: Most people, first time they kill somebody, they're overcome with emotion. They do stupid things \u2026 Danny Myers rationally and meticulously attempted to cover this case up. That usually takes experience.\n\nHe seemed to have it down to a science says Braun \u2014 cutting down Heather's fingernails and cleaning her body in an apparent attempt to remove DNA evidence.\n\nProsecutor Tim Braun: Have I dealt in the past with people who've attempted to destroy genetic material? Absolutely. And usually...\n\nJim Axelrod: Not their first rodeo.\n\nProsecutor Tim Braun: Not their first rodeo. \u2026 And they get good at covering up because they want to do it again. \u2026 And so, when I saw that, yeah. It raised a lot of questions in my mind.\n\nLoriann Haley says if Tim Braun is looking for proof Daniel Myers killed before, he doesn't need to look any further than her sister, Leigh Ann Sluder.\n\nJim Axelrod: You think your sister was murdered?\n\nLoriann Haley: Yes.\n\nJim Axelrod: By Danny?\n\nLoriann Haley: Yes.\n\nJim Axelrod: No question.\n\nLoriann Haley: No question.\n\nLeigh Ann was Daniel Myers' ex-girlfriend and the mother of his son. Nearly six years before Heather Bogle's death, Leigh Ann was found with a single gunshot to her chest. A crime scene photograph shows the.22 caliber rifle beside her. Authorities quickly ruled it a suicide.\n\nAs authorities looked into Daniel Myers' past, they learned of one of his ex-girlfriends, Leigh Ann Sluder, who authorities conclude died by suicide six years before Heather Bogle's death. Sluder's sister believes that Myers killed her and it wasn't a suicide. Loriann Haley\n\nJim Axelrod: When you heard that word \"suicide\" \u2014\n\nLoriann Haley: No.\n\nJim Axelrod: No way?\n\nLoriann Haley: No.\n\nLoriann Haley: I just talked to her 12 hours prior. \u2026 There was no indication whatsoever that she was crying for help or giving me any signal.\n\nEven more alarming, says Haley, is why Leigh Ann had a gun at all.\n\nLoriann Haley: I knew my sister hated guns. \u2026 She would not allow to have a gun in her house.\n\nJim Axelrod: So that's a giant red flag?\n\nLoriann Haley: Yes. \u2026 He supposedly told investigators it was for her protection. I'm thinking to myself, \"Protection from what?\"\n\nDaniel Myers admitted to giving the gun to Leigh Ann for her security, but Haley was skeptical of how her sister could use it to shoot herself in the chest with its long barrel and then leave it lying neatly next to her body.\n\nJim Axelrod: How could she do that with a rifle?\n\nLoriann Haley: Yeah. Impossible.\n\nJim Axelrod: How could she reach the trigger?\n\nProsecutor Tim Braun: Well, that's the issue.\n\nA lot would remain unanswered, says Tim Braun.\n\nProsecutor Tim Braun: Leigh Ann Sluder suicide, in my opinion, was not a properly processed crime scene in the sense that it was not photographed well, evidence wasn't collected. It wasn't done correctly.\n\nMatt Westerhold: So, if they had done gun residue tests on Daniel Myers' hands in that 2009 investigation they would know, unequivocally, whether he had shot that weapon.\n\nJim Axelrod: That sounds like standard operating procedure.\n\nMatt Westerhold: Right. Well, this is Sandusky County Sheriff's Office and at that time it was not a professional agency.\n\nSheriff Chris Hilton: I believe the investigators at the time took Daniel at his word that she killed herself.\n\nJim Axelrod: Do you think if your sister's death had been properly investigated, Heather Bogle would be alive?\n\nLoriann Haley: Yes.\n\nJim Axelrod: You didn't hesitate one bit.\n\nLoriann Haley: No.\n\nInvestigators recently took another look at Leigh Ann's death. They came to the same conclusion of suicide after determining Leigh Ann was physically able to reach the rifle's trigger after all. An undated letter also surfaced. Authorities say it is her handwriting and reads like a suicide note: \"All I ever wanted was to just die so that the hurt would stop.\"\n\nDaniel Myers' relatives say they found the note in his home after his arrest.\n\nLoriann Haley: I don't believe it was fully authenticated \u2026 I don't understand why he had it for so long \u2026 and then all of a sudden it pops up, case closed, done.\n\nLoriann Haley: It's just sad that the justice system wasn't on our side \u2026 I know that he killed her, he knows it. The problem is, you can't prove it.\n\nNow, Haley is hoping to get justice for her sister through another victim's case. If found guilty of killing Heather Bogle, Daniel Myers could be sentenced to death.\n\nJim Axelrod: And, in your view, your sister's killer \u2014\n\nLoriann Haley: Yes.\n\nJim Axelrod: \u2014 would be executed.\n\nLoriann Haley: Yes.\n\nJim Axelrod: Not just Heather Bogle's killer.\n\nLoriann Haley: It would be both. Yes.\n\nJim Axelrod: How strong a case do you have?\n\nProsecutor Tim Braun: In my experience we have a very, very good case.\n\nTim Braun had Myers' DNA under Heather's fingernail, the GPS records placing her at his trailer and his history of violence against women. But there was still one huge obstacle: Sean O'Connell.\n\nProsecutor Tim Braun: From a trial lawyer standpoint, it was a nightmare. It's a nightmare because you have the original investigator pointing the finger at other people.\n\nAnd that would provide a convenient alternate suspect theory for a defense attorney. So, before Daniel Myers could stand trial, the prosecutor believed Sean O'Connell would have to be discredited once and for all\u2014 officially ruling out his three suspects: Omar Satchel, Kayree Jeffrey and Keyona Bor.\n\nKeyona Bor: I just hope what O'Connell did to us doesn't affect Heather's justice in convicting Daniel Myers.\n\nAnd they were about to find out.\n\nSean O'Connell: Tomorrow at this time, I could be at a local county jail getting ready to be booked in. \u2026 I don't want that to happen. I don't think that should happen. I don't think what I did warrants this to happen.\n\nTWO CASES CLOSED\n\nIt was a stunning change of fortune. Sean O'Connell, once a detective charged with upholding the law, is now facing trial for breaking it. He's accused of four felonies in connection to his Heather Bogle murder investigation, in which he focused on three innocent people. O'Connell remains defiant.\n\nJim Axelrod: Do you feel you owe Omar Satchel, Keyona Bor and Kayree Jeffery an apology?\n\nSean O'Connell: Why would I apologize? I mean if you look at \u2014 if you look \u2026\n\nJim Axelrod: Because they didn't do it.\n\nSean O'Connell: How do we know that for sure?\n\nBut the day his trial was set to begin, O'Connell finally admitted to a mistake. He pleaded guilty to one felony count: tampering with evidence by omitting the DNA results that excluded his three suspects.\n\nSean O'Connell: All I can do now is just kind of hope for the best not only for me, but for my family when it comes time for sentencing.\n\nThe former detective arrived at his sentencing hearing with his wife and family by his side, hoping for probation \u2013 but preparing for prison.\n\nO'Connell addressed the court in a plea for leniency:\n\nSEAN O'CONNELL [in court]: I wasn't trying to purposely leave out anything. I was just trying to highlight what I had at that point.\n\nJudge Patricia Cosgrove zeroed in on his failure to report the DNA results:\n\nJUDGE COSGROVE: Why didn't you include that? SEAN O'CONNELL: You're right Your Honor, I did not include it, and I take full responsibility for that. And for what it's worth, I apologize for not doing that. But again, I did that because I was simply trying to give the prosecutor a feel on why I thought it was these three people.\n\nOne of those three people, Keyona Bor, finally got the chance to address the man she says ruined her life:\n\nKEYONA BOR [in court]: I have lost time with my children, time with my family. I have lost friends. I have lost family. I have pretty much lost every single thing that I've had because of this man. And I am still trying to get it back.\n\nAfter listening to all the testimony, Judge Cosgrove took a hard line.\n\nJUDGE COSGROVE: I gave him some consideration for his 25 years of service, his military service, his volunteer work, but he has to go to prison. This has to send a message to other law enforcement officers. Hey, when you look at a case, look at all of it. \u2026 And when you present a case, present all of it. Today is the day of sentencing, take him into custody.\n\nSean O'Connell pleaded guilty to one felony count: tampering with evidence by omitting the DNA results that excluded his three suspects. He was sentenced to two years in state prison. CBS News\n\nSean O'Connell was sentenced to two years in state prison. The newspaper man who had covered O'Connell through the years \u2013 in this case and several others \u2013 was overwhelmed.\n\nJim Axelrod: This hits you deep.\n\nMatt Westerhold [emotional]: The families. It was a moment of vindication for the families that he hurt. \u2026 'cause he \u2014 he hurt them so bad and he could've \u2014 it would've been so easy to just do the right thing.\n\nJim Axelrod: Is Sean O'Connell where he should be? In prison?\n\nSheriff Chris Hilton: Anytime somebody that wears the same badge that I do gets in trouble, breaks the law, convicted of a crime, they need to pay for it. [Sighs] I believe he is where he should be.\n\nWith the O'Connell case resolved, Braun was finally ready to take on Daniel Myers in court.\n\nProsecutor Tim Braun: We had more than enough to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nBut within days of the trial starting, Myers derailed the proceedings. He was found face down in his cell \u2013 dazed and incoherent \u2014 in what turned out to be a failed suicide attempt.\n\nProsecutor Tim Braun: Do I think he was trying to commit suicide? I think he was trying to create a medical emergency.\n\nJim Axelrod: Buy some time?\n\nProsecutor Tim Braun: Buy some time.\n\nDaniel Myers chose to plead guilty rather than face the possibility of a death sentence. He'll spend the rest of his days in prison with no chance of parole. CBS News\n\nBut time finally ran out. Daniel Myers chose to plead guilty rather than face the possibility of a death sentence:\n\nJUDGE DEWEY: You understand that a plea of guilty is a complete admission of guilt. DANIEL MYERS: Yes.\n\nOne-time suspect Carmella Badillo spoke directly to the man who tortured and killed her former girlfriend:\n\nCARMELLA BADILLO [in court]: I want you to know that you took away a mother and a friend and a loved one that no one could ever get back. \u2026 And I want you to know, Daniel Myers, I do not forgive you. No one in this room can say that they forgive the devil.\n\nSheriff Chris Hilton: People \u2026 say, \"Sheriff how could he do this, why would he do this to such a young, beautiful woman, what was he thinking?\" And I would tell them \u2026 \"This man is a monster.\"\n\nDaniel Myers will have a lot of time to think about what he has done. He'll spend the rest of his days in prison with no chance of parole. After nearly four years, the people of this county finally saw justice.\n\nSheriff Chris Hilton: Sandusky County is a great place. \u2026 I think it's a little better now. And I'm proud of that.\n\nHeather Bogle's memory will live on in the hearts and minds of the people of Sandusky County who are now free to remember the beautiful young mother she was \u2026 and imagine a life that could have been.\n\nAfter \"48 Hours\" finished reporting on this story, Prosecutor Tim Braun was accused of sexual harassment by at least four women who worked with him.
