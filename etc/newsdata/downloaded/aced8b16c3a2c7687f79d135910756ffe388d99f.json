The case was reported by the management staff of Hanover Park clinic,\u201d Goliath says.\n\nGoliath says because the victim and suspect is unknown they cannot investigate the case as thoroughly.\n\n\u201cWe will try to locate the victim of the robbery but for now we have no other information to go on except video footage. We urge the public to report any and all criminal cases and we also urge them to remain vigilant at all times,\u201d he says.", "description": "No case was made against the men who allegedly robbed a Hanover Park clinic on Monday 15 August.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://graph.facebook.com/10227041841/picture", "published_at": "2016-08-23"}
