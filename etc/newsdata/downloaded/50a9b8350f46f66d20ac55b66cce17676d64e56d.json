The drugmaker has hired the law firm Latham & Watkins LLP and turnaround firm AlixPartners LLP to advise it, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential talks.\n\nWith more than 2,000 U.S. cities and counties seeking to recoup billions spent fighting the epidemic, drugmakers including Purdue Pharma LP and Insys Therapuetics Inc. have threatened or filed for bankruptcy as a way of trying to control their losses. Mallinckrodt is burdened with $5 billion in debt, adding to the risk of a large legal judgment or settlement.\n\nThe drugmaker\u2019s shares fell sharply after the market close and were down 37% to $1.62 at 6:07 p.m. in New York. Representatives for St. Louis-based Mallinckrodt and AlixPartners declined to comment, while a representative for Latham didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nOpioid Settlements\n\nLocal governments in hard-hit states including Ohio, West Virginia and Kentucky have accused opioid makers, distributors and pharmacy chains of understating the risks of prescription opioids, overstating their benefits, failing to halt suspiciously large shipments, and ignoring red flags about repeated retail sales.\n\nSome opioid makers, including Endo International Plc and Allergan Plc, already have settled claims they faced in the Oct. 21 trial in Cleveland. Endo agreed to pay $10 million and donate $1 million worth of drugs while Allergan agreed to pay $5 million.\n\nPurdue Pharma is preparing to file for bankruptcy as part of a plan that may include an $11.5 billion settlement to resolve all lawsuits against it, Bloomberg previously reported.\n\nMallinckrodt is negotiating with lawyers for the plaintiff cities and counties in hopes of working out a deal to avoid the Cleveland trial, people familiar with the talks said.\n\nCredit Drawdown\n\nThe company on Aug. 29 disclosed it had tapped the last $95 million on its revolving credit line, leaving it with no remaining borrowing capacity as liabilities loom, analysts said. When it drew down the revolver, company representatives said the move provided \u201cincreased liquidity\u201d for it to \u201caddress cash needs that may arise in the future.\u201d\n\nSuch needs could include a cash payment in the event that Mallinckrodt can reach a settlement in Cleveland, the people familiar with those talks said.\n\nThe pharmaceutical company has about $550 million of cash on hand and more than $5 billion of net debt. After drawing down the remainder of its $900 million revolving credit line and terminating its securitization facility, Mallinckrodt has no borrowing capacity, analysts say.\n\nMallinckrodt, which produces specialty and generic drugs, has lost about three-quarters of its market value this year as investors assessed the potential liability posed by opioid-related lawsuits.\n\nIt also faces pressure from new competitors and regulatory changes.\n\nOn Aug. 27, the company lost a patent-infringement case appeal over a generic version of its INOmax infant-respiratory treatment being marketed by Linde Plc\u2019s Praxair. And it has been embroiled in a lawsuit against the U.S. government over a regulatory move that would change Medicaid rebates for its best-selling Acthar Gel.\n\nThe case is In Re National Prescription Opioid Litigation, 17-md-2804, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Ohio (Cleveland).\n\n(Updates shares in fourth paragraph)\n\n--With assistance from Jeremy Hill, Katherine Doherty and Drew Armstrong.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Eliza Ronalds-Hannon in New York at eronaldshann@bloomberg.net;Jef Feeley in Wilmington, Delaware at jfeeley@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Rick Green at rgreen18@bloomberg.net, Shannon D.
