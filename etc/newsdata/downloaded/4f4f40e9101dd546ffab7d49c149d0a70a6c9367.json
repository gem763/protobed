The share of ultra-high net worth individuals who are women jumps to 18.8% when only those under 50 are studied, suggesting that women's share of the 1% will continue to increase with time.\n\nRead more: Luck vs. skill: The founders behind major businesses like Bumble, Shopify, and Away explain what their success boils down to \u2014 and they all have different takes\n\nWealthy women used to primarily inherit their fortunes; now, they're also building them on their own\n\nIn past decades, ultra-high net worth women primarily inherited their fortunes, according to Wealth-X. Increasing numbers of female entrepreneurs are directly correlated with increasing numbers of ultra-wealthy women, Imberg told Business Insider.\n\nHowever, women still face substantial headwinds when launching their own companies, Business Insider's Megan Hernbroth previously reported. In the first half of 2019, investment in female-founded startups accounted for 2.9% of total venture investments. That figure put 2019 on track to be the best fundraising year for female founders ever.\n\nEntrepreneurship is one of the most common ways to create wealth. The proportion of the ultra-wealthy who made their own fortunes has been on the rise throughout the past decade, reaching over 67% in 2018, according to Wealth-X.\n\nTadashi Yanai, the founder of Uniqlo and the richest man in Japan, said in August that his job as the founder of one of the fastest-growing clothing retailers on the planet is actually \"more suitable for a woman\" because women are more \"persevering, detailed oriented and have an aesthetic sense.\"\n\nWealthy women also tend to be less rich than the average ultra-high net worth individual, Wealth-X found. While women comprise 14.6% of the world's ultra-high net worth population, they hold only 10.3% of that group's cumulative wealth. This wealth gap is even more significant in ultra-wealthy people over age 70.", "description": "Increasing numbers of female entrepreneurs are directly correlated with increasing numbers of ultra-wealthy women, according to Wealth-X.", "authors": ["Taylor Nicole Rogers"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9df8b33b33a728a475ffa9?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
