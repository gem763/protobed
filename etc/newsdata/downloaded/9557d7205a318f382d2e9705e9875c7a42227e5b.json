It also offers a reminder that his disclosures of mass surveillance and bulk collection of personal information are as relevant now as they were in 2013. More so, he argues, given that private companies have become the new data behemoths.\n\nHow did Snowden become a pathfinder into the secret caverns of this new technological age? Accidentally, it seems. He comes from a family of flag-waving, security cleared patriots. One grandfather was a rear admiral, his father (\u201cmy hero\u201d) worked for the US coastguard, and his mother had a senior backroom role with America\u2019s National Security Agency (NSA). \u201cMine is a family that has always answered the call of duty,\u201d he writes.\n\nThe CIA didn\u2019t quite understand. The computer guy knows everything, or rather can know everything\n\nLess surprisingly, young Eddie was a whip-smart supergeek. He was obsessed by his father\u2019s Commodore 64 home computer and when he saw the first wave of the internet, surfed it, spending every waking moment online, learning how to code, how to hack.\n\nIn the aftermath of 9/11, he joined the US army because he \u201cwanted to show I wasn\u2019t just a brain in a jar\u201d, and had he not suffered stress fractures during training, he would have become a special forces soldier. Snowden says his greatest regret was his own \u201creflexive, unquestioning support\u201d for the decision to wage war after the attacks, and how it led to \u201cthe promulgation of secret policies, secret laws, secret courts and secret wars\u201d. He found out about this parallel world working for different intelligence agencies as a contractor tasked with upgrading their antediluvian IT systems. As the spies pivoted towards cyber espionage, the top brass missed something quite important: \u201cThe CIA didn\u2019t quite understand. The computer guy knows everything, or rather can know everything.\u201d Snowden, it seems, was in a position to access their crown jewels.\n\nAt first, it was the incompetence that bothered him. The NSA\u2019s security was pretty shoddy and it hardly bothered to encrypt anything. At the CIA, he spent his downtime reading intelligence reports and secret dispatches.\n\nIf there was a moment of epiphany, it came when he was asked to put together a presentation on China\u2019s \u201cutterly mind boggling\u201d surveillance capabilities. As he did this, he says, he had \u201ca sneaking sense I was looking at a mirror and seeing a reflection of America\u201d. He was determined to find out if his fears were true. When he embarked on his own covert mission, he was just 29 and living in Hawaii. The story of how he fled to Hong Kong and then to unintended exile in Russia is fleshed out in more detail than we have seen before. Angered by what he discovered, and the dissembling of US politicians, he copied documents about the most egregious data collection programs on to tiny sim cards, which he smuggled out of the NSA facility where he was working in his trouser pocket \u2013 having decided against sticking them on to the side of his Rubik\u2019s cube.\n\nSnowden didn\u2019t tell Lindsay what he was up to because he thought this would be cruel and he wanted to protect her. But leaving her was cruel and it didn\u2019t protect her \u2013 something he profoundly regrets. I would have liked to have heard more from Lindsay and how their relationship survived the fallout. They didn\u2019t see each other for more than a year. Two years ago, they married.\n\nRegret is a recurring theme. Snowden is not sorry for what he did, but he laments the death of the internet he grew up with, and warns of dangers ahead, as artificial intelligence is fused with surveillance capabilities. If he is angry at his own predicament, it doesn\u2019t show, but there is anger, and it comes in unexpected flashes; he describes Osama bin Laden as a \u201cmotherfucker\u201d.\n\nHe also seems exasperated by people who don\u2019t try to understand the capabilities that can now be wielded against them. Snowden calls this the \u201ctyranny of not understanding the technology\u201d \u2013 a dig at anyone who uses a smartphone, or a computer, without wondering how the freedom it gives them might also make them vulnerable. In his own gentle way, perhaps Snowden is throwing down the gauntlet.\n\nHe eventually decided his loyalties lay not with the agencies he was working for, but the public they were set up to protect. He felt ordinary citizens were being betrayed, and he had a duty to explain how.\n\nAnd Snowdens always answer a call of duty.\n\n\u2022 Permanent Record is published by Macmillan (\u00a320).
