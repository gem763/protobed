Like Justice Scalia, these men are firm originalists, who interpret the Constitution in light of the original public meaning of its text\u2014regardless of their personal or religious preferences. Justice Scalia, a devout Catholic and convinced pro-lifer, famously said that if he\u2019d found abortion rights in the Constitution, he\u2019d have ruled to uphold them\u2014and favored an amendment to change it. That\u2019s the proper attitude for a jurist in a constitutional republic, who knows that he\u2019s neither a prelate nor a philosopher king.\n\nWhy then should conservatives, even Catholics, be concerned about a justice letting his or her faith influence his or her jurisprudence? The answer is simple: Pope Francis sits on the throne.\n\nFrancis has used his position to promote a wide array of leftist political and theological stances that conflict with his predecessors\u2019 teachings. These include capital punishment, which goes back to the Covenant of Noah in scripture, and was on the books of the Vatican City state into the late 1960s. Francis has recently unilaterally declared capital punishment forever \u201cinadmissible,\u201d whatever that means. In fact, Francis has gone further and claimed that life imprisonment is also evil.\n\nStill more urgent is immigration.", "description": "", "authors": ["John Zmirak", "Humanevents.Com Amy-Coney-Barrett-Is-Not-A-Safe-Pick-For-The-Supreme-Court"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
