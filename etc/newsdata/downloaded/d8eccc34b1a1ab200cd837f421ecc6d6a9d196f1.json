Pte Gray\u2019s dad, also Geoff, said: \u201cI didn\u2019t have any faith in Surrey Police to start with but when DC Keech admitted having sex on a number of occasions with a key witness you wonder what is going on.\n\n\u201cShe kept that secret for 17 years. And police have said she shouldn\u2019t be disciplined. It\u2019s a disgrace. She should be sacked or do the decent thing and resign. She has got off very lightly.\u201d\n\nDuring evidence at the second inquest, in May, DC Keech said she and WO Filmer met a number of times and had sex.\n\nWO Filmer, then a corporal, was in charge of the Deepcut camp guard on the night Pte Gray died.\n\nThe WO, who had led a search for the teenager, denies the relationship with DC Keech was sexual.\n\n(Image: Steve Burton)\n\nBut she told the inquest she arranged to meet him in a pub after they became \u201cmutually attracted\u201d to each other.\n\nDuring the hearing, John Cooper QC, for the Gray family, said to DC Keech: \u201cA relatively experienced officer, in her 30s, has interviewed a significant witness and you have a sexual relationship with him without informing your colleagues. On all levels that\u2019s appalling professional conduct.\u201d\n\nDC Keech replied: \u201cI agree it shouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d\n\nAlthough WO Filmer admitted going for a drink, he denied the sex allegation and said in evidence that she must have confused him with someone else. DC Keech denied his claim.\n\nSurrey Police said: \u201cThe circumstances surrounding the officer\u2019s conduct have now been fully reviewed. This review has determined that their actions do amount to a misconduct.\n\n\u201cIt concluded this could be dealt with appropriately through management action with the officer involved.\u201d\n\nPte Gray was among four soldiers found dead from gunshot wounds at the Princess Royal barracks between 1995 and 2002.
