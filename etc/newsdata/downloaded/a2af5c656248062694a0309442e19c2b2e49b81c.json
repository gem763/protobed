Maybe ever.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact of the matter is that whether or not the Senate will impeach \u2026 there\u2019s no option but to deal with this,\u201d Biden said, lamenting Trump\u2019s support from \u201cspecial interest groups\u201d such as the NRA and gun manufacturers.\n\n\u201cI think the boy knows that I\u2019ll beat him like a drum if I get the nomination,\u201d Biden said.\n\n\u201cIf in fact, the House doesn\u2019t move and let the facts fall where they may, what does the next unethical president [do], if we elect another one? What\u2019s that say they can do? What\u2019s gonna happen? They have to know there\u2019s consequences,\u201d he added.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry stems from the July 25 conversation Trump had with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. Trump asked the Ukrainian leader to look into CrowdStrike and later mentioned Biden and his son, Hunter, who made $83,000 per month serving on the board of Burisma Holdings, despite a stunning lack of qualifications for such a position. The former vice president played a key role in the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was investigating Burisma Holdings and later bragged about holding $1 billion in aid over the Ukrainian government\u2019s head.\n\n\u201cI said, I\u2019m telling you, you\u2019re not getting the billion dollars. I said, you\u2019re not getting the billion. I\u2019m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours,\u201d Biden said during an appearance at the Council on Foreign Relations in 2018.\n\n\u201cI looked at them and said: I\u2019m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money. Well, son of a bitch. He got fired,\u201d he bragged.\n\nThe Biden campaign has tried to go on offense as questions continue to mount over the Bidens\u2019 business dealings in both Ukraine and China. Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager and communications director, Kate Bedingfield, wrote a blistering letter to the New York Times\u2019 executive editor, Dean Baquet, accusing the paper of spreading what she described as \u201ca baseless conspiracy theory advanced by Rudy Giuliani.\u201d\n\nBedingfield wrote in part:\n\nThis debunked theory speculates that then Vice-President Biden somehow did anything reportedly inappropriate in successfully ridding Ukraine of a corrupt prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who the Times itself thoroughly explained at the time was derelict and the target of an international effort for removal. What was especially troubling about the Times\u2019s active participation in this smear campaign is that prior to its reporting on the subject by Ken Vogel, this conspiracy had been relegated to the likes of Breitbart, Russia propaganda, and another conspiracy theorist, regular Hannity guest John Solomon.\n\nThe Biden campaign also issued an informal warning to fellow 2020 candidates ahead of Tuesday\u2019s debate, with a campaign aide warning anyone who \u201ccalls themselves a \u2018Democrat\u2019\u201d to refrain from pushing the \u201cdiscredited lies,\u201d as reported by Bloomberg.\n\nTrump has not shied away from taking aim at the Bidens in his recent KAG rallies across the country, slamming the presidential hopeful and his son during Thursday\u2019s rally in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\n\u201cJoe\u2019s son, Hunter, got thrown out of the Navy, and then he became a genius on Wall Street in about two days,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBy the way, whatever happened to Hunter? Where the hell is he? \u2026 Where\u2019s Hunter?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then they go to China \u2026 and Hunter, who\u2019s not too smart \u2026 he goes in, he has a meeting and walks out with $1.5 billion, billion with a B, $1.5 billion,\u201d he continued. \u201cNow think of it. Where\u2019s Hunter?\u201d\n\n\u201cHunter, you know nothing about energy. You know nothing about China. You know nothing about anything, really. Hunter, you\u2019re a loser,\u201d he added. \u201cWhy did you get $1.5 billion, Hunter?\u201d\n\nHunter, through his lawyers, announced on Sunday that he is stepping away from BHR Equity Investment Fund Management, a Chinese-backed private equity company.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported:\n\nThe 49-year-old doesn\u2019t state whether he will be divesting from BHR (Shanghai) Equity Investment Fund Management Company. The company was set up in 2013 to invest Chinese capital outside of China. Instead the young Biden pledged he wouldn\u2019t work for any foreign-owned companies or serve on their boards during a potential Biden administration.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Hunter? He has totally disappeared! Now looks like he has raided and scammed even more countries!\u201d Trump exclaimed on Sunday. \u201cMedia is AWOL\u201d:\n\nWhere\u2019s Hunter? He has totally disappeared! Now looks like he has raided and scammed even more countries! Media is AWOL. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 13, 2019\n\nHunter likely still has \u201cmillions\u201d in the China-backed investment fund, according to reports.", "description": "Former Vice President Joe Biden (D) boasted on Sunday of his role in the partisan-fueled impeachment effort.", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/06/Biden-hand-raised-closeup-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
