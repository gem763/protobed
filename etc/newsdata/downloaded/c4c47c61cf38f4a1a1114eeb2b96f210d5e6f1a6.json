Elections!\u201d from League politicians, while outside the lower house, hundreds of far-right supporters staged a noisy demonstration to demand a snap poll.\n\n\u201cThey can run away from the vote for a few months, but they can\u2019t run away for ever, and when Italians get to vote we will win,\u201d Salvini told the cheering crowd. Some of those present gave stiff-armed fascist salutes.\n\nConte laid out a wide-ranging policy programme, promising expansionary measures to boost the stagnant economy, pledging to head off a big VAT increase set to kick in on Jan. 1 and warning that tax cheats in future would face prison terms.\n\nHe also said his government, Italy\u2019s 67th since World War Two, would forge ahead with legislation to cut the number of parliamentarians and introduce a new electoral law \u2014 a fourth stab at rewriting voting rules since 2005.\n\nMIGRANT ACCORD\n\nThe prime minister won the obligatory vote of confidence by 343 to 263 in the 630-seat lower house. He will face another such motion in the upper house Senate on Tuesday, where his coalition will have to govern with a much smaller majority.\n\n\u201cIt is going to be difficult and complicated. A sense of responsibility has prevailed. Now we must roll up our sleeves and try to do the best for the country,\u201d said Culture Minister Dario Francheschini, a senior PD representative.\n\nConte\u2019s first government took office in June 2018, but soon got bogged down in rows over everything from infrastructure projects to immigration, and from EU relations to autonomy for Italy\u2019s wealthy north.\n\nSalvini boosted his popularity with an uncompromising crackdown on boat migrants from north Africa, refusing to let charity rescue ships from docking in Italy.\n\nConte said he hoped to devise a new policy with Brussels of sharing migrant arrivals around the 28-nation bloc. He also promised a more constructive partnership in trying to revise EU banking norms and loosening budget restraints.\n\nLooking to reset Italy\u2019s rocky EU ties, Conte has entrusted the mainstream PD with the EU affairs ministry and the economy ministry and has also dispatched former PD prime minister Paolo Gentiloni to Brussels as an EU commissioner.\n\nSlideshow (12 Images)\n\nFreed from the shackles of any ties to the eurosceptic League, Conte will fly to Brussels on Wednesday for the first foreign visit of his new premiership. He mentioned the word \u201cEurope\u201d and \u201cEuropean\u201d some 32 times in his 27-page speech.\n\n\u201cI remain firmly convinced ... that it is within the confines of the European Union and not outside, that we must work for the good of Italians,\u201d he said.", "description": "Italy's prime minister said on Monday his new coalition combining the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the pro-Europe Democratic Party (PD) would usher in a wave of reforms and avoid the rows that stymied his old government.", "authors": ["Giuseppe Fonte", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1428078718&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF881RL", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
