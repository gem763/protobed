See you soon. \u2014@Marner93\n\nDubas had said signing Marner was \"priority one\" in April after the Leafs were eliminated by the Boston Bruins for the second consecutive spring.\n\nSince then, he continued to negotiate with the player's agent, Darren Ferris, while also re-signing fellow RFAs Andreas Johansson (four years, $3.4-million cap hit) and Kasperi Kapanen (three years, $3.2 million cap hit).\n\nOther moves include:\n\nDealing Marleau, a conditional first-round pick and seventh-round selection in 2020 to Carolina for a sixth-rounder next year. The Hurricanes subsequently bought out the remainder of the veteran forward's $6.25 million contract for next season.\n\nTrading defenceman Nikita Zaitsev and Brown to Ottawa in a six-player swap that included fellow blue-liners Cody Ceci and Ben Harpur coming to Toronto.\n\nShipping Kadri, defenceman Calle Rosen and a third-round selection in the 2020 NHL draft to Colorado for defenceman Tyson Barrie, forward Alex Kerfoot and a sixth-rounder next June. The Avalanche also retained 50 per cent of the remaining $5.5 million owed to Barrie.\n\nAdding veteran centre and Toronto native Jason Spezza at the league minimum $700,000.\n\nPreviously, Dubas said there was a chance he would have let Marner walk had another team signed him to an offer sheet but also wished to keep all of the club's young stars.\n\nIt was reported over the summer that Ferris, who didn't wish to negotiate a contract for Marner during the season, was looking for a deal similar to the five-year, $58.17 million ($11.634 AAV) contract that centre Auston Matthews signed with Toronto in February.\n\nWATCH | Patience, poise and a historic Marner penalty shot\n\nToronto Maple Leafs forward Mitch Marner scored an impressive short-handed penalty shot goal against the Boston Bruins in Game 1, the first goal of its kind in Leafs franchise playoff history. 1:00\n\nFree-agent centre John Tavares joined the team last summer on a seven-year deal worth $77 million ($11 million AAV) while forward William Nylander's cap hit is close to $7 million.\n\nIn 2015, the Maple Leafs drafted Marner with their first pick (fourth overall).
