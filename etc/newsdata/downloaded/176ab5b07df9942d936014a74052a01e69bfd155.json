Rental prices in Hong Kong surpass those in New York, Paris and Singapore, and many young professionals living in the Chinese-ruled territory struggle to afford housing. Some families have no choice but to rent out dorm-style rooms with bunk beds and shared bathrooms, sometimes known as \"coffin homes\" or \"shoebox flats.\" In her annual policy speech on Wednesday, Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam introduced a slew of housing measures aimed at addressing some of those concerns. Lam said housing is the \"toughest livelihood issue\" facing the city's citizens and pledged to make more land available for public housing development, according to an official translation of her remarks in Cantonese. The Hong Kong leader emphasized that housing issues are essential to social stability and \"upward mobility,\" defined as climbing up to the next social level. \"Every Hong Kong citizen and his family will no longer have to be troubled by, or preoccupied with, the housing problem, and that they will be able to have their own home in Hong Kong, a city in which we all have a share,\" Lam pledged.\n\nHong Kong \u2014 a former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997 \u2014 has been crippled by widespread demonstrations for nearly five months now. It operates as a semi-autonomous territory under the \"one country, two systems\" principle \u2014 a structure that grants Hong Kong citizens some degree of financial and legal independence from the mainland. What started out as protests against an extradition bill has morphed into demonstrations demanding full democracy and universal suffrage. Majority of the protesters have been young students from university and high schools.\n\nTwin cities: Singapore and Hong Kong", "description": "Hong Kong has been repeatedly ranked as the most expensive place to own a home.", "authors": ["Grace Shao"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105689837-1548057268584gettyimages-1008760342.jpeg?v=1548057574", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
