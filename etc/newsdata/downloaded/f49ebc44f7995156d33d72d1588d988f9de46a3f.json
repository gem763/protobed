As reported by Buzzfeed News, after Breja raised the issue with management, Juul did not warn consumers that their pods might have been adulterated or issue a recall.\n\nThe story the suit tells is a strange one, although not completely unfamiliar, and outlines how a company led by a charismatic leader \u2014 Kevin Burns, Juul\u2019s former CEO \u2014 and under federal pressure can find itself on the wrong end of potentially significant legal exposure.\n\nAs relayed in the lawsuit, Burns felt that Juul needed to win at all costs, and was prone to saying TV-boss things, like there could \u201conly be one king at Juul.\u201d (At one point, Burns apparently told Breja and a room of executives, \u201cTell that motherfucker I\u2019ll take him out of the room and shoot him with a shotgun if he challenges my decisions,\u201d which is tr\u00e9s HBO.)\n\nThe trouble started in February, two months after Altria \u2014 formerly Philip Morris, one of the largest tobacco companies in the world \u2014 spent $12.8 billion acquiring 35 percent of Juul. Last year, in an effort to avoid federal scrutiny of its products, and in a gesture of public goodwill, Juul shut down nearly all of its social media presence and quit selling its fruitier pods in retail stores, saying they\u2019d only sell them online. (As of this month, they have pulled those flavors from their online store.) They still, however, sell mint-flavored pods, which are classified as menthol and therefore not considered flavored.\n\n\u201cHalf our customers are drunk and vaping like mo-fos, who the fuck is going to notice the quality of our pods.\u201d\n\nAccording to Breja\u2019s lawsuit, after the fruit pods disappeared from stores, the share of Juul\u2019s mint pods as a percentage of total pod sales jumped from one-third last September to two-thirds by this February. The increased demand created a supply-chain shortage; retailers were out of stock. \u201cYou need to have an IQ of 5 to know that when customers don\u2019t find mango they buy mint,\u201d Burns allegedly said at the time. That February, after a distributor returned pods that were nearly a year old \u2014 on its site, Juul claims that its pods don\u2019t expire for at least a year but are best used soon after purchase \u2014 the company resold them without adding, as Breja had suggested, an expiration date on the packaging. \u201cHalf our customers are drunk and vaping like mo-fos, who the fuck is going to notice the quality of our pods,\u201d said Burns, allegedly, in a typically pungent response.\n\nFor his part, Burns categorically denied he said anything of the sort. \u201cI never said this, or anything remotely close to this, period,\u201d he wrote in an email to The Verge. \u201cAs CEO, I had the company make huge investments in product quality, and the facts will show this claim is absolutely false and pure fiction.\u201d\n\nThe next month, Breja reportedly learned in an executive team meeting that some batches of the mint e-liquid Juul uses to fill its pods were contaminated, and that, according to the lawsuit, \u201capproximately 250,000 \u2018Mint Refill Kits,\u2019 the equivalent of one million pods, manufactured with this contaminated eLiquid have already been shipped to retailers.\u201d It\u2019s not yet clear what the mint Juul pods may have been contaminated with. Breja told his supervisor that he thought the company should issue a product recall, or at least put out a warning to the public; in response, his boss, who is no longer with the company, allegedly told him to remember his loyalty to Juul. At the same time, Breja was allegedly told to recover $7 million from the supplier for the contaminated stock.\n\nIt remains to be seen what will happen, either with the pods or with the lawsuit, although Breja is asking for a jury trial. And then there\u2019s the proverbial elephant in the room: across the country, there\u2019s been an outbreak of lung injuries from vaping. As we\u2019ve reported previously, 1,604 probable cases have been identified and it\u2019s been linked to 34 deaths as of just last week. The spread, however, has been blamed mostly on adulterated THC e-liquid, and there\u2019s no word on any connection to vaping legal nicotine pods.\n\nRelated Everything you ever wanted to know about the vaping health crisis\n\nFor its part, a Juul spokesperson told The New York Times that Breja had been terminated because he wasn\u2019t a good leader. \u201cThe allegations concerning safety issues with Juul products are equally meritless, and we already investigated the underlying manufacturing issue and determined the product met all applicable specifications,\u201d the spokesperson continued.\n\nUpdate October 30th, 5:40PM ET: Added a statement from former Juul CEO Kevin Burns.", "description": "Former Juul SVP Siddharth Breja alleges the company knowingly sold contaminated, expired mint-flavored nicotine pods to consumers, and that he lost his job when he tried to blow the whistle and push for a warning or a product recall. It\u2019s unclear if this is related to the vaping health crisis, or what the pods might have been contaminated with.", "authors": ["Bijan Stephen", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/omi2TpkgmQ23IUqfAB6CzP-q7_M=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19205212/acastro_190916_1777_juul_0001.0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
