It's all been pretty messy and frantic.\"\n\nBuckingham Palace took the rare step last month on briefing their \"displeasure\" at former prime minister David Cameron's decision to reveal the details of private communications he had with the Queen's aides.\n\nThe Palace was reportedly similarly displeased after the Supreme Court ruled that Johnson had asked the Queen to illegally suspend parliament, with Private Eye reporting that she had expected Johnson to announce his resignation afterwards.\n\nThe Queen is set to deliver a 'trailer for the Conservative party's election manifesto.'\n\nQueen Elizabeth II Getty\n\nThe Queen will on Monday lunchtime come to the Houses of Parliament to announce a new programme of legislation which Johnson's government plans to implement.\n\nHowever, there's one small problem.Johnson's government can't actually implement any of it.\n\nJohnson currently has majority of minus 45 in the House of Commons, so none of this legislation can actually be passed before a general election.\n\nRead more: Boris Johnson told to resign following Supreme Court defeat and become the 'shortest-serving prime minister ever'\n\nFor this reason, as Robert Hazell of the Constitution Unit points out, UK prime ministers traditionally only call a Queen's speech directly after a general election once they have won a majority.\n\nWhat Johnson is attempting is the complete opposite. In effect he is asking the Queen, not to set out his government's legislative agenda, but to set out the Conservative party's manifesto for a general election.\n\nBy timing the Queen's speech as he has, Johnson is, Hazell argues, asking the monarch to \"make a Conservative party political broadcast.\"\n\nAs the Constitution Unit puts it, Johnson is planning to use the speech as a \"trailer for the Conservative party's election manifesto.\n\nHazell adds: \"if indeed the government hopes for an election and for there to be no coming session of parliament, then the Queen's Speech is a sham.\"", "description": "Queen Elizabeth II is reportedly angry at the recent behaviour of both Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his predecessor David Cameron.", "authors": ["Adam Bienkov"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da4207f4af909016d1b9512?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
