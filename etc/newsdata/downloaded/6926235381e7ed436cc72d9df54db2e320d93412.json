Isis claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nThe bombing made an impact out of proportion to its size because, for the last two years, Iraqi cities have been largely free from the devastating bombings by Isis, the worst of which once killed hundreds of civilians at a time.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Jurf al-Sakhar, which once had a population of 90,000, was one of the few Sunni towns south of Baghdad and was notorious as a stronghold of al-Qaeda and later of Isis.\n\nThey exploited its strategic position close to Baghdad and on the main route to Shia southern Iraq to launch bomb attacks in the capital and against Shia targets in and around Karbala.\n\nThe town was stormed by Shia paramilitary groups in 2014 and the entire Sunni population was expelled \u2013 many families who had once owned large farms being reduced over the last five years to living in shacks or being packed into a single room. Jurf al-Sakhar became a ghost town, largely occupied by hardline Shia militias.\n\nIts inhabitants have long been asking for permission to go home, but this basic privilege is unlikely to be granted any time soon. The representatives of the majority Shia population in surrounding Hilla province, much relieved that Isis no longer has a territorial base close to them, have threatened legal action against any politician who calls for the people of Jurf al-Saakhar to be allowed to return to their old town.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

A crucial test of security will come in the next few weeks as millions of Shia pilgrims from all over the world take part in the Arbaeen religious walk to Karbala. The gigantic columns of marchers waving religious flags are vulnerable to bombers, but have been relatively safe in recent years because of tight security.\n\nKarbala itself is in the middle of a construction boom, with cranes everywhere, particularly around the shrines to Imam al-Hussein and Imam al-Abbas, whose golden domes and walls covered with mosaics dominate the centre of the city.\n\nOfficials say that \u201cwe have to build places to stay for the millions of people who come to the shrine\u201d. As a result, construction machinery is everywhere and there are giant holes in the ground where foundations for hotels and hostels are being built.\n\nThe shrines employ great numbers of black-clad young men \u2013 15,000 at the Imam Hussein shrine and 7,000 at the al-Abbas shrine \u2013 to safely shepherd the great masses of pilgrims from place to place.\n\nThey do not always do so with success: on 10 September a stampede by crowds at the entrance to the Imam Hussein shrine left 31 crushed to death and 100 injured. It happened during Ashura, the climax of the commemoration of the death of Imam Hussein and his family, when a traditional run called the Twareej takes place over the last hundred metres before the pilgrims enter the shrine.\n\nOn this occasion, an old man tripped and fell just by the al-Raja gate. The crowd was particularly dense as only two of the shrine\u2019s doors were open \u2013 construction work meant the other eight were closed or inaccessible, leaving pilgrims trapped in the narrow entrance.\n\nThe physical expansion of the shrines of Karbala and the millions of pilgrims from the rest of Iraq, and from across the Shia world, marks the triumph of the Shia majority in Iraq since the US invasion overthrew Saddam Hussein in 2003.\n\nThis marked the end of the Sunni Arab predominance that Saddam had embodied, but was also a feature of British and Ottoman rule. In 1991, the Shia shrines in Karbala were the last bastion of resistance against Saddam as his tanks and Republican Guard stamped out the Shia uprising with massacres and destruction.\n\nIraqi tanks \u2013 British Challengers captured from Iran during the Iran-Iraq war \u2013 were positioned outside the shrines and Iraqi soldiers were encamped within its precincts, where they put up pictures of Saddam to celebrate their victory.\n\nAlmost 30 years later it is the loss of Sunni towns like Jurf al-Sakhar, and the partial destruction of Sunni cities like Mosul, which are the main feature of the new order of things in Iraq. Even if there are more Isis bombings like the one in Karbala last weekend, this order will not change.", "description": "At about midnight on 20 September, a young man got off a white minibus at the entrance to the\u00a0Shia shrine city and pilgrimage centre of Karbala, southwest of Baghdad.
