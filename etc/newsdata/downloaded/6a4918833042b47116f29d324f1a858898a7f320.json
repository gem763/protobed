Their name used to be on a wing at the Louvre. But now the Sackler family wealth has become linked to sales of OxyContin, and their company, drug maker Purdue Pharma, is attempting to settle lawsuits over the opioid crisis. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File)\n\nFor a family with its name on a wing of one of the world's most famous museums and a school at a prestigious university, members of the Sackler clan have done a remarkable job of vanishing from public life.\n\nThe family owns OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma, which filed for bankruptcy this week as part of an effort to settle some 2,600 lawsuits accusing it of helping spark the national opioid crisis that has killed more than 400,000 people in the U.S. in the last two decades.\n\nAny settlement deal is likely to take a cut of their future income, and some states have sought to go after the Sacklers' wealth, much of which has moved through a complex chain of companies and trusts in offshore tax havens. In a filing Wednesday, Purdue asked a bankruptcy court to halt all litigation against family members as well as the company.\n\nThe relatives have rarely spoken publicly in recent years and did not show up to the first bankruptcy hearing this week, in White Plains, New York. Here are some basic facts about the family:\n\nTHE COMPANY OWNERSHIP\n\nBrothers Mortimer, Raymond and Arthur Sackler \u2014 all physicians \u2014 bought the drug company known as Purdue Frederick in 1952. They are all dead, but the widows, children and grandchildren of Mortimer and Raymond now own the company, along with an international drug company, Mundipharma.\n\nPurdue is privately held, and its board has been mainly controlled by Sackler heirs over the years, until legal issues began piling up in the last year. No family members are currently on the board.\n\nIn court filings, lawyers for family members have argued that their clients, serving as company directors, were not heavily involved in day-to-day decisions at the company.\n\n___\n\nTHE FAMILY BRANCHES: ARTHUR SACKLER\n\nArthur Sackler became a force in the drug industry separate from Purdue. In addition to his medical background, he worked in advertising and designed campaigns aimed at doctors for blockbuster drugs such as Valium.\n\nIn 1997, Sackler was posthumously placed in the Medical Advertising Hall of Fame, where the citation about him says that he \"helped shape pharmaceutical promotion as we know it today.\"\n\nBut Arthur Sackler died years before OxyContin hit the market. And states that have filed lawsuits against members of the family have not named his heirs. Arthur Sackler's widow, Jillian Sackler, a major donor, has told institutions that her husband's money did not come from OxyContin.\n\n\"Suggestions that his philanthropy is now somehow tainted are simply false,\" she wrote earlier this year in a Washington Post opinion piece.\n\n___\n\nTHE FAMILY BRANCHES: RAYMOND SACKLER\n\nRaymond Sackler's son Richard, who now lives in Florida, was an executive at Purdue when OxyContin launched in 1996 and later became CEO of the company.\n\nPlaintiffs in the lawsuits have seized on his words, especially his remarks to the company sales force at a 1996 launch party for OxyContin held just after a major snowstorm. He said the launch of the tablets would \"be followed by a blizzard of prescriptions that will bury the competition. The prescription blizzard will be so deep, dense and white.\"\n\nThe drug did become a blockbuster, though generic opioids were prescribed far more often. Still, state and local governments that are suing the company assert that marketing by Purdue opened the door to wider use of prescription opioids.\n\nRichard Sackler wrote in a 1999 email cited in court filings, \"You won't believe how committed I am to make OxyContin a huge success. It is almost that I dedicated my life to it.\"\n\nIn a 2015 deposition, he tried to estimate how much the family had made from OxyContin. He said it was over $1 billion but less than $10 billion. In a video of the deposition that emerged in August, he was asked if he believed OxyContin was marketed too aggressively. He answered with a single word \u2014 \"no\" \u2014 while barely glancing up from papers he was looking through.\n\nRepresentatives for Raymond Sackler's branch of the family did not respond to interview requests.\n\n___\n\nTHE FAMILY BRANCHES: MORTIMER SACKLER\n\nAt the end of his life, Mortimer Sackler lived in London. His widow, Theresa, who lives in England, and children Mortimer D.A. Sackler, Kathe Sackler and Ilene Sackler Lefcourt are all former board members and are named in lawsuits.\n\nMortimer D.A. Sackler and Kathe Sackler were also Purdue executives.", "description": "For a family with its name on a wing of one of the world's most famous museums and a school at a prestigious university, members of the Sackler clan have done a remarkable job of vanishing from public life.
