Photo: Linda Dyett\n\nI began covering beauty in the 1980s \u2014 yes, I could be old enough to be your grandmother \u2014 starting out at New York Magazine and the Village Voice; then going on staff at Lear\u2019s; and then contributing to publications including Allure, Self, Glamour, Monocle, and the New York Times (to name a handful). And as much as I sometimes wish I evolved into a minimalist, the reality is that I\u2019ve become even more of a skin-care and makeup fiend over the years. I try everything that cosmetics companies send me, I can\u2019t help but stop and reconnoiter any Space NK or Sephora I\u2019m passing by, and I\u2019ll even wear lipstick and eyeliner to the gym (though not a lot).\n\nThe author. Photo: Jonas Danholt\n\nYou\u2019re probably wondering what state my skin is in. Back in my 20s, my pale complexion with yellow undertones always looked sallow. No longer. I\u2019ve accumulated scattered wrinkles and creases, and my skin isn\u2019t nearly as firm as it used to be. But \u2026 after decades of Retin-A and AHAs, it\u2019s smooth and even-toned, with enough luminosity to deflect from some of the sagging. In testing new products, trial and error have taught me to cut through the hype. High-end doesn\u2019t impress me, and rock-bottom bargain prices don\u2019t deter me. Effectivity and how it looks on my skin matter most. So does the ingredient label.\n\nWhen it comes to skin rejuvenators, I\u2019m unabashedly addicted to potent vitamin-C serums and AHAs (potent meaning that the C and the AHA are high up on the ingredient label). K-beauty? Sure \u2014 some of it is deviously clever. As for makeup, I look for easy spreadability and savvy, nuanced color. And when it comes to makeup brushes, the only one I use is for my lips. Below is the 20-product skin and makeup routine I use on days I don\u2019t spend alone with my computer (when I\u2019m known to leave my face unwashed till mid-afternoon). When it comes to makeup, things change if I\u2019m going out at night, but that\u2019s a story for another day. And if using 20 products just to walk out the door sounds obsessive, just think of all the ones I\u2019ve learned to live without over the years!\n\nStep 1: Cleanser\n\nPeter Thomas Roth 3% Glycolic Solutions Cleanser This is my favorite morning exfoliating face wash. I use it several times a week, letting it sink in for up to two minutes before rinsing it off. That way, it clears away dead skin, tightens the pores, and leaves my complexion with a mild buzz. If you\u2019re new to chemical skin exfoliants/AHAs (which are shorthand for alpha hydroxy acids, such as this formula\u2019s glycolic acid), here is the perfect gateway slougher. New York City\u2013based dermatologist Whitney Bowe agrees, saying this cleanser\u2019s short-contact application makes it a twice-weekly \u201cstepping stone\u201d on your way to more concentrated AHAs. $39 at Ulta Beauty Buy $39 at Sephora Buy\n\nStyleCraft Gentle Sonic Facial Cleansing Brush A recent find, this USB-charging, six-speed cleansing brush with its tiny silicone bristles is a must-have. Running it over my skin for the first time, working the above cleanser in, I vowed never to lose it \u2014 or its charger. It effortlessly smooths and velvetizes my skin with 12-second pulses that let me know it\u2019s time to shift to a new cleansing zone, and the three-minute auto-shut-off keeps me from getting carried away. $40 at Amazon Buy $40 at Amazon Buy\n\nStep 2: Physical Exfoliant\n\nTOYO Cure Natural Aqua Gel A couple of mornings a week, I paint on a layer of this physical exfoliant, let it sit for, say, 90 seconds, then peel it off with my fingertips. Its built-in slither quotient prevents me from applying too much pressure in any one area, and the exfoliant dries into a deliciously clingy film that takes a full two minutes to remove. But I suspect the way my fingers dance around my face as I peel it off just adds to the glowing complexion the product gives me (which lasts pretty much all day). $37 at Amazon Buy $37 at Amazon Buy\n\nStep 3: Toner\n\nSkinCeuticals Equalizing Toner None of those moisturizing toners that\u2019ve cropped up in recent years make sense to me. Toners are supposed to be the residue-removing finale to cleansing. I dislike it when they pile on anything new. I want them to purify. That\u2019s just what this SkinCeuticals toner does, leaving my complexion desirably taut and so ready for what comes next. $34 at Dermstore Buy $34 at SkinCeuticals Buy\n\nStep 4: Serums\n\nCitrix CRS 20 Percent L-Ascorbic Acid Collagen Rejuvenation Serum My skin loves high-grade serums. And since I couldn\u2019t choose among my three favorites, I\u2019m including all of them. Each has its own unique mix of ingredients and takes a different pathway in improving the skin \u2014 so for ongoing benefits from all of them, I rotate them from day to day. The Citrix active vitamin-C formula, in its airtight pump container, I\u2019m convinced, really does what it claims to do: build new collagen and reduce brown spots (after using this serum exclusively for a few weeks, I noticed brown spots fading and my complexion becoming more even toned). It also leaves a warming sensation that Pavlovian conditioning has taught me to crave like a zealot. Right at the top of the ingredient list, along with vitamin C, are not one but four silicone compounds, allowing this serum to ease onto my face like magic. If you\u2019re new to potent C, start with one of Citrix\u2019s lower, 10 or 20 percent, formulas. $126 at Amazon Buy $116 at SkinStore Buy with code: SUMMER\n\nNiod Copper Amino Isolate Serum 2:1 Deciem, the Canadian cosmetics company that\u2019s partly owned by Est\u00e9e Lauder, has a wide range of products whose infuriating names only chemists can understand. But all is forgiven when I use this second-generation powerhouse copper potion from Deciem\u2019s Niod subdivision. It instantly firms up my cheeks and leaves a glow on my skin and, if I use it at night as well as in the morning, my face remains skating-rink smooth for a couple of days. $60 at Amazon Buy $48 at SkinStore Buy with code: SUMMER\n\nMarmur Metamorphosis Revive Serum This one, part of a pace-setting product line from the New York dermatologist Ellen Marmur, I always use on mornings when I\u2019m going to wear foundation. My very choosy makeup-artist friend Brigitte Reiss-Andersen introduced this wrinkle-tackling, inflammation-reducing antioxidant formula to me as a superlative makeup primer \u2014 but, if I\u2019m pressed for time, it also works as a moisturizer for my eyes, throat, and face. $85 at Marmur Buy\n\nStep 5: Moisturizer\n\nThe Better Skin Co. Mirakle Cream If my post-serum skin still feels dry, I pat on a dollop of this recent non-gooey discovery, based on a formula smuggled in from Uzbekistan. One of its oddball ingredients is hops, which is supposed to give the skin the same soothing effect it has in beer. Another is moisture-binding pea peptide. I can\u2019t swear that they make a difference, but I do love the way this cream sinks in immediately, leaving zero oil slick. $34 at Amazon Buy $34 at Ulta Beauty Buy\n\nStep 6: Eye Cream\n\nDrunk Elephant C-Tango Multivitamin Eye Cream Nowhere is my complexion drier than on my lower eyelids. This pump-dispensed cream delivers instant but long-lasting dewiness and \u2014 I realized after a few days of use \u2014 plumps up and helps disguise the under-eye hollowness. $64 at Amazon Buy $64 at Sephora Buy\n\nStep 7: Sunscreen\n\nSkinCeuticals Physical Fusion UV Defense SPF 50 I finally found a titanium oxide\u2013zinc oxide sunscreen that doesn\u2019t produce a ghostly white glow. Instead, with its translucent color spheres, this liquidy, serum-y UV protectant leaves my face with a slight even-toned glow. It\u2019s weightless, too, and feels like silk gliding onto my face, ears, and neck. Tiny pinging blender balls added to the formula remind me to shake the bottle before applying. When I don\u2019t feel like wearing makeup, the routine ends here. But when I do, read on for the products I use. $34 at SkinCeuticals Buy $34 at Dermstore Buy\n\nStep 8: Concealer\n\nCl\u00e9 de Peau Concealer Broad Spectrum SPF 25 I apply all my eye makeup first, so I can clear away any liner and eyeshadow soot that might otherwise fall onto my foundation-covered cheeks. I start with a concealer. This one goes on as if self-propelled, and not only covers the haunting darkness under my eyes but disguises the circles that\u2019ve been forming beneath each lower lid. Plus it\u2019s got UV protection. Brilliant. $58 at Amazon Buy $58 at Amazon Buy\n\nStep 9: Eyeliner\n\nGiorgio Armani Beauty Smooth Silk Eye Pencil, Shade 2 A prime goal on my first trip to Paris, back in the 1960s, was to get a Jean Seberg\u2013in\u2013Breathless pixie haircut at the Carita salon. I did. Divine. Back at the hotel, my friend Nicki took a long, caustic look, pounced on her makeup bag, and pulled out the not-yet-opened liquid eyeliner she\u2019d bought that day. An eyeliner virgin, I urgently needed black-rimmed eyes, which Nicki painstakingly applied, despite all my blinking. Ever since, I haven\u2019t had an eyeliner-free day in my life. Eventually, I switched to softer pencil liners, and for the nuanced look I now desire, I combine two different colors. For starters, Armani\u2019s classic Smooth Silk Eye Pencil (which has a sponge smudger at the opposite end) in medium-brown Shade No. 2. $30 at Giorgio Armani Beauty Buy\n\nE.L.F. Cosmetics Satin Eyeliner Pencil, Golden Olive After drawing the brown base line, I trace on the wondrous E.L.F. pencil liner in Golden Olive, a shade that had to have been devised to bring out the murky green in my hazel eyes. Despite the rock-bottom price, it glides on effortlessly. Bonus: A sharpener is built into the lid. Genius! $2 at Amazon Buy $2 at E.L.F. Cosmetics Buy\n\nStep 11: Brow Pencil\n\nSephora Retractable Brow Pencil, Auburn One day while I was scrutinizing the house brand Retractable Brow Pencils at Sephora, a roving makeup staffer approached and rather amiably urged me to try shade No. 7, Auburn. She was spot-on. Ever since, that chestnutty shade has been my go-to brow color; it\u2019s a softer accent to my tinted Irish-setter-red hair than my naturally ash-brown brows. I also like how thin this pencil is and how it deposits just the right amount of tint. $12 at Sephora Buy\n\nStep 12: Foundation\n\nFace Stockholm Picture Perfect Foundation, E Much as the new generation of weightless liquid foundations impress me, I keep reverting to my Face Stockholm cream formula in shade E (the fifth out of 23). Taking up mere specks of this thick, high-pigment cream with my fingertip, I dot them onto my nose, cheeks, and forehead, then blend them in like crazy. Discolorations and texture irregularities vanish, yet my face doesn\u2019t look done. $48 at Face Stockholm Buy\n\nStep 13: Face Powder\n\nFace Stockholm Matte Finishing Powder I know \u2014 using face powder dates me. But when I don\u2019t use it, I find my nose develops an undesirable shine every five or six hours like clockwork. So on goes this colorless, ultra-ultra-light loose powder (which I find far superior to cakey pressed powder). $26 at Face Stockholm Buy\n\nStep 14: Blush\n\nPeripera Ah Much Real My Cushion Blusher, Shade 4 $8 (was $16, now 50% off) With my pale skin, I need a very light, almost imperceptible petal-pink blush. I stay away from powder formulations, which can go on too heavily; my current choice is this liquidy formula from Peripera, in shade No. 4 (which Riley Rose calls Shy Pink, but I\u2019ve seen other retailers call Pleased Pink). I ignore the cushion applicator on the cap, instead squeezing out a smidgeon with my fingertip and apply it gingerly above the apple of each cheek, sweeping it beneath my lower eyelids. $8 at Riley Rose Buy\n\nStep 15: Lipstick\n\nPat McGrath Labs MatteTrance Lipstick, Venus in Furs $40 at Sephora Buy\n\nFor years and years, I was on a nonstop quest for the perfect nude-pink lip color with hints of plum, brown, and especially caramel. How hard could that be? Turns out, very. Finally, it dawned on me that I could mix it myself. And I do, starting with a base layer of the heavily pigmented Kevyn Aucoin lipstick in a shade that\u2019s that\u2019s aptly named Bloodroses \u2014 so dark it\u2019s almost black. I wait a minute, blot it, and then over that insistently dark base layer, I brush on another matte color, the far lighter, divinely mauve-inflected Pat McGrath shade known as Venus in Furs \u2014 one of the all-time great nudes. Mixing that with the Aucoin Bloodroses produces the elusive lip color that took me three decades to find. To blend these two disparate colors, I finally acquiesce and pick up a makeup brush. It keeps my lips from bleeding and, like a collapsible periscope, the brush closes in on itself \u2014 I have a long history of losing brush caps, which is a big reason I don\u2019t use most brushes. I guess that means I\u2019m not that big of a beauty maximalist after all.\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
