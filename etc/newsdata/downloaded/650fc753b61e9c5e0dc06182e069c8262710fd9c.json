If it's a weapon that was designed to kill people on the battlefield, we're going to buy it back. pic.twitter.com/cCEWkG6y0X \u2014 Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) September 13, 2019\n\nHe's also fundraising off the position and selling t-shirts.\n\nHell yes, we're going to take your AR-15.\n\n\n\nBuy your shirt now: https://t.co/kEJxoLvfH5 pic.twitter.com/KKpAKX4IL8 \u2014 Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) September 13, 2019\n\nBut it was just one year ago when the candidate, who was running against U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, encouraged Texans to keep their AR-15's and use them lawfully.\n\nLast night proved Beto would do anything to get ahead. He promised confiscation of commonly-owned rifles \u2013 leaving law-abiding Americans defenseless.\n\n\n\nBeto is so desperate he\u2018s fundraising by selling t-shirts with his confiscation promise on it \u2013 DISGUSTING.\n\n\n\nBeto will fail. pic.twitter.com/a3GyQYisaa \u2014 NRA (@NRA) September 13, 2019\n\nO'Rourke, along with other Democrats on the stage, want to confiscate firearms legally owned and purchased by millions of Americans. There is no such thing as a government \"buyback.\" Americans do not buy their guns from the government, the government never owned them, but Democrats running to be the most powerful person in the world want to illegally confiscate them.\n\nAs a reminder, O'Rourke was one arrested for burglary. It's no wonder he doesn't want Americans to be armed against criminals.", "description": ".09/13/2019 14:10:20PM EST.", "authors": ["Katie Pavlich", "Cortney O'Brien", "Leah Barkoukis", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/248/2f454db8-861c-48ac-bb4a-b1109ed0ae77.png", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
