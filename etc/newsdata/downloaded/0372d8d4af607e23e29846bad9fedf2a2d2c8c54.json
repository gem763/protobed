He is a coach who has an honest opinion about every player and he is not someone who does things behind closed doors but he does it openly and everyone knows about it.\n\n\u201cPlayers have respect for someone who is honest and open and says what he is looking for. It gives you more freedom to go out there and express yourself: he does not put you in a box and that has been one of his outstanding features.\u201d\n\nAsked whether one of Erasmus\u2019s decisions that impacted on the nation was the appointment of Siya Kolisi as captain, the first black player to be given the post in a Test, Mbonambi replied: \u201cNot just that. I know that if I say something the media will turn it around and put it in a different way.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rassie Erasmus delivers his team talk before the quart-final against Japan. Photograph: Mark Baker/AP\n\n\u201cTo me, what this team is about is that your skin colour does not matter, or where you come from. Rassie will pick a guy who is there to work hard and do his job well. When you compare him to previous coaches, they would pick someone who had been there for years even though he was not pulling his weight. Now you get picked by the work that you do and how you execute it.\u201d\n\nMbonambi left the field before the end of the first-half in the 26-3 victory over Japan after feeling a slight hamstring pull, but he declared himself fit to face Wales and South Africa\u2019s forwards coach Matt Proudfoot said they had a full squad of players to pick from.\n\n\u201cIt is a good position to be in ahead of a fixture against a very good Wales side,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are not grand-slam champions for nothing and they were top of the world rankings for a while this year. We have the highest respect: they have an outstanding defence and pack of forwards and dangerous backs.\n\nEngland\u2019s training session spied on from a nearby apartment, says Eddie Jones Read more\n\n\u201cIt has been said that they were poor against France in the quarter-final, but I disagree. They came from behind to defeat a very good side and that says everything about what we will be facing. We are pleased with the way we played in the second-half against Japan, but there is still work to do if we are to get to the final.\u201d\n\nSouth Africa, who will face Wales in the third successive tournament, reached the semi-final in 2015 when they were narrowly beaten by the All Blacks but fell apart in the two years afterwards to the point where they lost to Italy and were hammered by Ireland and the All Blacks, looking anything but potential World Cup winners.\n\n\u201cRassie came in with a specific plan and we have gone back to the way South Africa used to play,\u201d said Proudfoot. \u201cThe biggest change has been the mindset he has created throughout the group. Everyone has been empowered to take ownership of their roles and there is confidence now.\u201d", "description": "The South Africa hooker Bongi Mbomanmi has hailed coach Rassie Erasmus for taking the team from laughing stock to World Cup contenders by picking players on merit", "authors": ["Paul Rees"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79c5abfede6a59cc8d0a9810631f5e9ea363e2aa/0_77_2796_1679/master/2796.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d4c49bfe9e9b7ccbcdd8d523e2ebae4f", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
