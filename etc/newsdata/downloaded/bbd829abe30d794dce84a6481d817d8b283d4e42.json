He won\u2019t ask for a Brexit extension, as required to do by the backbench bill that will be law by Monday. It looks as if he will have to resign.\n\nBoris Johnson could even announce his intention to resign \u2013 as prime minister but not as leader of the Conservative Party \u2013 on Monday. He would have to do it anyway by 19 October, which is the date set in Hilary Benn\u2019s bill by which whoever is prime minister would have to sign a letter to Donald Tusk, the EU president, asking for an extension to the Article 50 period.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBut what is the point of waiting? Once Benn\u2019s bill becomes law on Monday, the prime minister is trapped. As he said in the Commons yesterday, \u201cIt is a bill that effectively ends the negotiations.\u201d There is not much more for him to talk about with the EU, because the other EU leaders know that we won\u2019t be leaving without a deal on 31 October.\n\nJohnson could spend the next five weeks just being prime minister, without parliament to bother him, but on borrowed time. He could attend the EU summit on 17-18 October, but with nothing substantive to say.\n\nWhenever he chooses to announce his resignation, his only alternative would seem to be to eat not just his words but his pride and any semblance of credibility with Leave voters.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

But I would have thought he\u2019d rather say that he wants an election; that parliament has blocked him; that he will leave it to others to sort out the constitutional deadlock; and that he will fight the election when it comes.\n\nTo many people, he will have failed, because Brexit will have been delayed again \u2013 but at least not by him. He could say that he tried, but the people were betrayed by a Remainer parliament that never accepted the result of the 2016 referendum. The Brexit Party would be stronger than it would have been in a 15 October election, because Nigel Farage will accuse Johnson of breaking his promise to get us out \u201ccome what may\u201d on 31 October. But Johnson would still have a chance of fighting a \u201cpeople versus parliament\u201d election against a divided Labour Party.\n\nNo one knows what would happen if Johnson announced his resignation. He would, presumably, refuse to advise the Queen as to whom she should invite to form a government instead. We would be in the unlikely territory of the House of Commons having to try to unite behind someone as temporary prime minister.\n\nThis caretaker figure would be charged with writing the \u201cDear Donald\u201d letter that Johnson refuses to write, and then presiding over an election \u2013 after 31 October.\n\nBut who could it be? Jo Swinson, leader of the Liberal Democrats (now 16 strong), doesn\u2019t want Jeremy Corbyn; and it\u2019s hard to see Corbyn acquiescing to Kenneth Clarke, now an independent Conservative. I have argued before that Clarke has more implied support in the Commons than Corbyn has.\n\nUnlikely as it may seem, Clarke could be a short-term prime minister rather soon, before a general election in November or December.", "description": "Jo Johnson\u2019s resignation may not have much practical effect, but it is symbolic, and it dramatises his brother\u2019s problem.", "authors": ["John Rentoul"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/03/16/boris-johnson.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
