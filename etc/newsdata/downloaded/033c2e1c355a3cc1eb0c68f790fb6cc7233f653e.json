Public opinion is turning against him, with growing national support for impeachment as well as Trump\u2019s removal from office.\n\nThe President\u2019s efforts to stop the investigation only make things worse. His controversial decision to withdraw troops from northern Syria, though apparently unrelated to the Ukraine scandal, shook a number of congressional Republicans, who blasted Trump for the disastrous policy move.
