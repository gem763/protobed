They view their newfound strengths as an opportunity to \u201cmake a difference\u201d in their violent world, \u201cbecause otherwise we went through all our pain for nothing.\u201d\n\nIn addition to giving a voice to real-life shooting survivors, \u201cIgnited\u201d was a chance for scriptwriters Waid and Osajyefo to address a range of sensitive, highly topical issues in the United States \u2014 while drawing on their backgrounds with Captain America, the X-Men, Batman and Superman.\n\nTopics featured in the first few issues include gun control, immigration police raids on Latino families, militias and growing calls from ultra-conservatives for teachers to be armed with guns.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018Ignited\u2019 shared universe is different because it\u2019s not really superheroes \u2014 to me, having written a million superhero comics, superheroes are about masks and capes and powers, and super villains,\u201d said Waid.\n\nHere the real \u201cvillains\u201d are extremists and the National Rifle Association (NRA) gun lobby.\n\nThe books\u2019 heroes are \u201cdealing with things on a more realistic and a more human level,\u201d added Waid, 57.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Make some waves\u2019 \u2013\n\nPublisher Humanoids Associates was founded in Paris in 1974, and is the only French-language comic book publisher to have successfully entered the US market.\n\nIt remains one of the top players in the European market, where it is first became known for wildly popular sci-fi comic anthology \u201cMetal Hurlant\u201d (\u201cHeavy Metal\u201d) \u2014 which Ridley Scott said partly inspired \u201cBlade Runner.\u201d\n\nThe publisher\u2019s owner Fabrice Giger said superhero comics are \u201ca first for us.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur logic was to approach (mass shootings) from another angle \u2026 What can we say that hasn\u2019t already been said by others?\u201d\n\nThe series, which had its US launch this summer and will be published monthly, has \u201cthe taste and look of American comic books but is something a little bit different.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe started from the basis that Marvel, DC Comics and even smaller American publishers are all politically correct \u2026 whereas we have always dealt freely with all subjects,\u201d said Giger from his Los Angeles office, where the company has operated since 1998.\n\nScriptwriter Waid agreed that \u201cbecause American comics are corporate owned, they have to cater to all political stripes.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a smaller company. We can afford to make some waves,\u201d said Waid, who is director of creative development at Humanoids, the US branch of Humanoids Associates.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a timely book because, clearly, it\u2019s about the madness that\u2019s happening here in America.\u201d\n\nCould a project like \u201cIgnited\u201d have been created at Marvel or DC?\n\n\u201cNot a chance \u2014 not to this degree. We would have had to dress it up as \u2018both sides are OK.\u2019 No, listen, both sides are not OK. This is ridiculous,\u201d Waid said.\n\nHis co-writer Osajyefo also started at Marvel and DC, but had to turn to crowd-funding to publish his controversial series \u201cBlack.\u201d\n\nThe critically acclaimed work imagines a world in which only black people develop superpowers \u2014 which the authorities seek to stifle by all means.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Speak up\u2019 \u2013\n\n\u201cIgnited\u201d is drawn by Philippe Briones, a French comic book virtuoso who worked for a decade at Disney.\n\nBriones applauded the \u201ccourageous\u201d decision to tackle a subject as political \u2014 and taboo \u2014 as shootings in the United States.\n\n\u201cLiving in Los Angeles, I see how important it is here,\u201d he said, comparing it to the idea of writing comic book stories about the Bataclan terror attacks back in France.\n\n\u201cThat would be really tricky, personally I wouldn\u2019t want to deal with this kind of subject,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing is for people to speak up, and comics is a good way,\u201d Briones added.", "description": "Los Angeles (AFP) \u2013 Two US authors have found a novel way to address the mass shootings that regularly plunge their country into mourning \u2014", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/17/4cee4e_french-comic-book-illustrator-phil-briones-works-in-his-home-office-in-los-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
