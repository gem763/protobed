The quickest of them all came against Carlos Condit in the main event of UFC on FOX 21 in August 2017.\n\nWith Maia (27-9 MMA, 21-9 UFC) riding a five-fight winning streak in the welterweight division at the time and trending toward a title shot, a matchup with former interim UFC titleholder Condit (30-13 MMA, 7-9 UFC) got the main event showcase.\n\nMaia was the one who shined, though, because he ran through Condit for a rear-naked choke in just 112 seconds \u2013 only absorbing one significant strike in the process \u2013 in what is the fastest submission win of his octagon tenure.\n\nThe Brazilian would make his winning streak seven fights with a victory over Jorge Masvidal in his next bout, setting up a title shot vs. then-champ Tyron Woodley at UFC 214 in July 2017.\n\nMaia fell short of the belt against Woodley, and is 2-2 in his four bouts since then.\n\nHe\u2019s won his past two, however, and will look to continue his streak when he gets yet another main event feature. This time it comes against Ben Askren (19-1 MMA, 1-1 UFC) on Saturday in the UFC on ESPN+ 20 main event, which takes place at Singapore Indoor Stadium in Singapore and streams on ESPN+.", "description": "Demian Maia has 10 submission wins on his UFC record.
