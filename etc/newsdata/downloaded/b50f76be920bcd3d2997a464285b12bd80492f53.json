It's not a conclusion he's a fantasist,' he said.\n\nWoods was cleared of one charge of sexual penetration of a child aged 10 to 16, five charges of gross indecency and six of indecent assault.\n\nThe County Court was told Woods was 24 when she thought she fell in love with a 14-year-old boy left in her care.\n\nBut her lawyer, Colin Mandy SC, said it made 'no sense' for the jury to find Woods (pictured) guilty on some charges, but not others\n\nThe relationship started out like mother and son, but evolved to a point where Woods thought of the child as a 'boyfriend'.\n\nWoods had previously been the boy's teacher before privately tutoring him, and then caring for him when his parents were away.\n\nThe pair exchanged countless love letters during 1984, but Woods insisted the pair should 'not step over the line'.\n\nBut in August that year, Woods 'exceeded the boundaries', molesting the teenager.\n\nShe was arrested in 2017 after the victim had a 'breakdown' and told his father what happened.\n\nShe was sentenced in December but avoided jail, instead receiving a two-year community corrections order with 200 hours of community work.\n\nThe appeal judges have reserved their decision.", "description": "Guilty findings against Victorian teacher Kathryn  Woods (pictured) who molested a teenage boy she claimed to have been in love with made 'no sense', her lawyer has told an appeal hearing.", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/06/19821884-0-image-a-7_1571290312656.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
