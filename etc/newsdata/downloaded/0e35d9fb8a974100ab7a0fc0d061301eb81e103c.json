For some, it\u2019s shared memories; a long association nurtured over many years. But Nicky Newman and Laura Middleton-Hughes have known each other just six months. Even so, they\u2019ve forged a bond as close as sisters.\n\nThe kinship that binds them is intuitive. They understand each other\u2019s pain, laugh together, recognise each other\u2019s secret thoughts and fears.\n\n\u2018When we first met, we ran up to each other and just hugged,\u2019 says Laura. \u2018It was like internet dating!\u2019\n\n\u2018Manic!\u2019 agrees Nicky. \u2018I was thinking, \u201cWhat\u2019s she going to be like?\u201d And we just clicked.\u2019\n\n\u2018And now we\u2019re the closest of friends,\u2019 adds Laura. \u2018We just relate to each other 100 per cent. With Nicky, I can talk about everything and anything and I know she\u2019ll understand.\u2019\n\nNicky Newman (right) and Laura Middleton-Hughes (left) have known each other just six months. Even so, they\u2019ve forged a bond as close as sisters\n\nLaura and Nicky\u2019s friendship is forged from adversity. You may not believe it when you look at their smiling faces and the glow of health that seems to emanate from them, but both have incurable secondary cancer\n\nLaura and Nicky\u2019s friendship is forged from adversity. You may not believe it when you look at their smiling faces and the glow of health that seems to emanate from them, but both have incurable secondary cancer.\n\nTreatment for the tumours, that began in their breasts but have now spread through their bodies, has made them both infertile: sharing the sorrow that neither will have children has proved a solace and comfort.\n\nThe two \u2014 both married, both united by the knowledge that the drugs keeping them alive could fail at any point and cut short lives once full of hope and promise \u2014 refuse to succumb to despair.\n\nBuoyed by each other\u2019s optimism, they are determined to wring every drop of joy out of the time left to them.\n\n\u2018We laugh a lot,\u2019 says Laura, 31. \u2018You\u2019d think having cancer would be dark and upsetting but we smile and have fun. And as much as it has ruined our lives, it brings good things as well. It\u2019s made me a much better person. I understand other people\u2019s struggles now. I have a zest for life I didn\u2019t have before.\u2019\n\nThey first made headlines when they posed, naked but for their knickers, for a shoot portraying True Cancer Bodies in April\n\n\u2018I push myself out of my comfort zone because I know life is short,\u2019 adds Nicky, 32. \u2018And if you do that, amazing things happen. If it wasn\u2019t for cancer, we wouldn\u2019t have become friends.\u2019\n\nTheir paths first crossed through an online cancer community and now they\u2019ve set up their own web platform, Secondary Sisters \u2014 the name came to Nicky in a flash \u2014 to \u2018offer information, hope and basically a bit of fun\u2019 to others with secondary or metastatic cancer.\n\n\u2018Things happen for a reason,\u2019 says Laura. \u2018Cancer sucks. I\u2019d rather not have it, of course. But it\u2019s given us great opportunities to help other people. We have a future, although we face a very bumpy one, and we\u2019re going to live it.\u2019\n\n\u2018Things happen for a reason,\u2019 says Laura. \u2018Cancer sucks. I\u2019d rather not have it, of course. But it\u2019s given us great opportunities to help other people. We have a future, although we face a very bumpy one, and we\u2019re going to live it\u2019\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve found our purpose, haven\u2019t we?\u2019 says Nicky. \u2018And if we can help even one person feel better about themselves, and like they\u2019re part of a community, that\u2019s wonderful.\u2019\n\nThey first made headlines when they posed, naked but for their knickers, for a shoot portraying True Cancer Bodies in April. The image was arresting: both women painted their bodies with words associated with secondary cancer including \u2018pain\u2019, \u2018infertility\u2019, \u2018fatigue\u2019 and \u2018stage 4\u2019.\n\n\u2018We did the photo in response to well-meaning \u201cfluffy\u201d health campaigns with slogans like \u201ctwo is better than one\u201d which we thought was insensitive to people with breast cancer and didn\u2019t represent the truth,\u2019 explains Laura.\n\n\u2018Before I had cancer, I\u2019d have been covering myself in a towel, but it gives you such confidence to be proud of your body, scars and all, because our bodies are keeping us alive. And it was at that shoot \u2014 where most of us were sitting around chatting and bonding wearing not very much at all \u2014 that Nicky and I got talking.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re the same age, going through very similar treatment plans and we\u2019d both lost the chance to have children, which was devastating. So we swapped details and quickly we were chatting to each other on social media; even calling each other in the early hours if we were in pain and couldn\u2019t sleep.\n\n\u2018Soon we were messaging each other every day,\u2019 says Nicky, \u2018So we said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we meet up?\u201d \u2019 So just eight weeks ago Nicky, who works in a finance brokerage, is married to electrical engineer Alex, and lives in Guildford, arranged to meet former hairdresser Laura, from Norwich, whose husband is taxi-driver Brad.\n\n\u2018It was bizarre,\u2019 says Nicky, \u2018because pre-cancer I suffered from anxiety and I\u2019d never have agreed to meet someone I barely knew in London. Before I was diagnosed, two years ago, I wouldn\u2019t even have had the courage to walk into a restaurant in front of my husband. But cancer has given me oodles of confidence. I owe it that. You grab life.\u2019\n\n\u2018You don\u2019t worry what people think any more, do you?\u2019 agrees Laura. \u2018And on the day we met, at Waterloo Station, we just clicked. We had a lovely lunch together and a really intense conversation. We told each other more than we\u2019d ever told our closest friends and families. What was so amazing was having someone else who truly \u201cgot it\u201d, who could relate 100 per cent to what I was going through.\n\nLaura and Nicky made headlines (including in the Daily Mail, pictured) with a photo shoot for True Cancer Bodies. \u2018We did the photo in response to well-meaning \u201cfluffy\u201d health campaigns with slogans like \u201ctwo is better than one\u201d which we thought was insensitive to people with breast cancer and didn\u2019t represent the truth,\u2019 explains Laura\n\n\u2018That day, we made our first video together to put on social media and people said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got such a natural rapport. You just bounce off each other.\u201d \u2019\n\n\u2018And it was then that we both agreed to set up Secondary Sisters,\u2019 says Nicky.\n\nLaura opened a YouTube channel and Instagram account for their fledgling platform that evening. It quickly caught the eye of Stand Up To Cancer, a campaign that aims to unite scientists, celebrities and communities across the UK to raise cash for rapid new treatments.\n\nIt is supported by presenters Davina McCall and Maya Jama, comedians Alan Carr and Joe Lycett, and Olympic long jump champion Greg Rutherford \u2014 and now Nicky and Laura have joined this line-up.\n\nWhen we meet they are dressed in flirty florals \u2014 two bright and beautiful young women whose glossy hair and wide smiles belie the fact that their futures have been snatched away.\n\nA year ago, Nicky and her husband were trying for a baby through IVF when her hopes were cruelly destroyed.\n\n\u2018We were going for our first round of IVF when I started to get back pain. I went for physio and they thought it was a prolapsed disc,\u2019 she recalls.\n\n\u2018Then, we\u2019d just finished the first treatment \u2014 which wasn\u2019t successful \u2014 when I found a lump in my breast while I was in the shower. I mentioned it to the IVF nurse who said it was probably because I\u2019d been pumped full of hormones.\n\n\u2018But I went to my GP anyway, and he fast-tracked me through to hospital. I was there for seven hours, had ten biopsies, mammograms, an ultrasound scan and my bloods taken. I remember being concerned about my fertility; that was at the top of my mind. I said, \u201cWhat happens to my eggs?\u201d I was supposed to be starting IVF again, and they told me, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. They are on ice.\u201d\n\nFormer hairdresser Laura, from Norwich, lived with taxi-driver husband Brad\n\n\u2018And we try not to look too far ahead because it\u2019s scary,\u2019 says Laura, who was diagnosed in 2014, when she was 25, just as her life and career \u2014 she worked as a bridal hairdresser \u2014 had taken off. Pictured: Laura with her three sisters celebrating sister Martha's hen do in Norfolk\n\n\u2018I felt weirdly calm. My gut told me I had cancer. I was prepared for the news. It was all a blur and for the next two weeks I had more scans \u2014 on my brain and body \u2014 and more checks.\n\n\u2018At that stage I thought we\u2019d have another chance at IVF. Then I saw my breast surgeon, thinking I\u2019d have to have chemo and a mastectomy. But the news was worse than that. She said, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry but there\u2019s nothing I can do. It\u2019s already spread to pretty much every bone in your body,\u201d and at that point my world fell apart.\n\n\u2018I knew nothing about secondary cancer then. I thought it must be bone cancer. I didn\u2019t know that breast cancer cells could spread to other parts of your body.\n\n\u2018I felt as if my world had collapsed, as if I was in a dream screaming and no one could hear me. I said, \u201cHow long have I got?\u201d and she said, \u201cI can\u2019t tell you that.\u201d I came out feeling lost. If you imagine all your life is written on a piece of paper it was as if someone had screwed it up and thrown it in a bin. I didn\u2019t want to see anyone, speak to anyone; face anyone. I just wanted to be at home. I cried a lot and I was almost physically sick with stress.\u2019\n\nOn Friday, April 13, last year, Nicky was given an official diagnosis by her oncologist, told she had stage four secondary breast cancer that had spread to her bones. She was put on the drug palbociclib which targets cancer cells and stops them growing.\n\nIt had only just been approved for NHS use and \u2018it was a game-changer\u2019 she says.\n\nShe takes it with a panoply of other pills; hormone tablets, calcium, because cancer riddles so many of her bones; anti-nausea drugs. Her fervent hope is that the treatment continues to work, although she knows the day will come when it ceases to.\n\nLaura and Nicky are supporting Stand Up To Cancer, a joint fundraising campaign from Cancer Research UK and Channel 4, to fund life-saving research and beat cancer at its own game\n\n\u2018And we try not to look too far ahead because it\u2019s scary,\u2019 says Laura, who was diagnosed in 2014, when she was 25, just as her life and career \u2014 she worked as a bridal hairdresser \u2014 had taken off.\n\nShe was on a holiday in Australia with her husband when she discovered a pea-sized lump in her breast while taking a shower.\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t think it would be anything to worry about \u2014 I thought it was just a cyst \u2014 but when I got home, I went to my GP who referred me immediately to hospital.\u2019\n\nA day of tests including ultra-sound scans, a biopsy and two mammograms followed.\n\n\u2018I said to my husband, \u201cThere\u2019s obviously something wrong\u201d, and that was the first time I thought it could be cancer. And I didn\u2019t tell anyone about the lump.\n\n\u2018Two weeks later, I got the results and they said, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry. It\u2019s breast cancer.\u201d I just remember feeling really numb. You go into this dream state where you can\u2019t think or act.\n\n\u2018I said to my husband, \u201cWhat am I going to do about work?\u201d I had clients \u2014 brides-to-be \u2014 booked for the whole summer and that was my first thought.\u2019\n\nShe asked husband Brad to call her dad. \u2018But my mum had a neurological illness and I didn\u2019t want her to know at first. Then I remember going through the door at home and just breaking down. Nothing was going in. It felt as if a heavy black cloud had come down.\u2019\n\nA couple of weeks on, she\u2019d begun chemo: \u2018I was violently sick and my hair started falling out, but I took control, put a little party together and invited ten friends round to help me shave my head.\n\n\u2018Then, five days after the treatment, I felt as if I\u2019d been hit by a bus. I couldn\u2019t walk from my living room to the kitchen. My bones ached. I felt exhausted, just rotten.\u2019\n\nThe assault on her system seemed merciless. Three weeks after she finished chemotherapy she had a mastectomy. \u2018I just wanted my breast off. It was trying to kill me,\u2019 she says.\n\nRadiotherapy followed. \u2018I felt fine for the first few sessions, then I looked as if I\u2019d had an iron on my chest; all blistered and bruised. And I was attempting to work, to preserve normality.\u2019\n\nFor a year, she took the targeted cancer drug herceptin, then in May 2015, her treatment over, she celebrated with a \u2018Fifty Shades of Pink\u2019 party.\n\nShe opted to have her other breast removed \u2014 for aesthetic reasons \u2014 and had both reconstructed. \u2018And then I felt I was starting to rebuild my life.\u2019\n\nBut worse was to come. In April 2016, she was in the gym when she developed a pain in her right shoulder. \u2018I thought I\u2019d injured it through over-exercising,\u2019 she says.\n\nLaura\u2019s mum died in June 2016; for a while, her own health was put on hold. Then, when the pain in her arm worsened to an extent that she couldn\u2019t move it, her doctor booked her an emergency CT scan. Within a couple of hours, she was seeing her oncologist again. The day is seared into her memory.\n\n\u2018I was told that the whole of my humerus (the long bone in the upper arm between the elbow and shoulder) was a tumour. It was so big it had fractured part of my arm. The doctor said it was incurable cancer and that I wouldn\u2019t be able to have children. I thought I\u2019d only have weeks or months to live. I was scared; in bits, with tears streaming down my face, completely numb. I remember feeling as if I was with someone else who was being told the terrible news.\n\n\u2018And strangely it was not being able to have kids that hit hardest. I\u2019d always wanted children.\u2019\n\nLater, scans showed secondary cancer had spread to her pelvis and spine. She had surgery to replace her shoulder. \u2018As soon as the wound was healed I had more chemotherapy. I was very sick. Whenever I was able, I\u2019d get out and about, but I spent days in bed.\u2019\n\nShe lists ten different drugs she still takes daily which keep her condition stable, including hormones, bone strengtheners, tablets to counteract the neuropathy in her feet and painkillers.\n\n\u2018You rattle, don\u2019t you darling?\u2019 smiles Nicky.\n\n\u2018But I can live a relatively normal life \u2014 although it revolves round jabs, scans, doctors\u2019 appointments, and I\u2019ll be on this regime, or some form of treatment, for ever,\u2019 says Laura. \u2018I don\u2019t want to look too far forward and be disappointed, so I don\u2019t plan more than a year ahead.\u2019\n\nBoth women\u2019s cancer is currently stable. Their lives \u2014 productive and busy \u2014 are focused on helping others.\n\nThey try to stay positive. Nicky still works part-time but Laura\u2019s reconstructed shoulder does not allow her to continue hairdressing. \u2018There are days when even taking a shower is an effort, when you\u2019re wiped out,\u2019 she says. \u2018But you put a face on, do your hair and people say, \u201cYou look so well!\u201d\n\n\u2018Our cancer is incurable now, but that doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be a drug in future that will change that. So we have to keep hoping,\u2019 says Laura.\n\n\u2018Meanwhile we enjoy life,\u2019 says Nicky. \u2018We\u2019re not veggie or vegan. We like a glass of wine, chocolates and a steak. Most people have a very different view about the holistic side of cancer. They cut out dairy, sugar and alcohol. That\u2019s fine for them but we think, \u201cLet\u2019s have a bit of fun.\u201d \u2019\n\n\u2018A bit of cake never hurt anyone,\u2019 adds Laura.\n\n\u2018I told my oncologist I was going to a wedding and asked if I could have a glass of wine. He said, \u201cHave a whole bottle!\u201d laughs Nicky.\n\n\u2018Having a little drink once in a while isn\u2019t going to kill us,\u2019 adds Laura \u2014 and they\u2019re laughing all over again.\n\nLaura and Nicky are supporting Stand Up To Cancer, a joint fundraising campaign from Cancer Research UK and Channel 4, to fund life-saving research and beat cancer at its own game.
