REUTERS/Simon Dawson\n\n(Reuters) - The FTSE 100 dipped on Friday as markets flattened out ahead of U.S. monthly jobs data, with losses in oil majors and miners overshadowing a rally in house builders on upbeat comments on the market from London-centric developer Berkeley.\n\nWith traders clearing the decks for the traditionally-influential U.S. non-farm payrolls numbers later in the day, the FTSE 100 index .FTSE edged 0.2% lower by 0800 GMT, while the midcaps .FTMC were down 0.1%.\n\nThat still left the blue chip index on course for a 0.8% rise in a week where liquidity is still recovering from a summer lull.\n\nContributing the most to the blue-chip bourse\u2019s losses were oil heavyweights and mining giants as concerns over global demand remained on investors\u2019 minds.\n\n\u201cData from the US on Thursday further lifted sentiment,\u201d said Craig Erlam, an analyst with Oanda in London. \u201cOf course, if the jobs data starts to disappoint then sentiment may quickly change.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. jobs numbers are expected to show employers added 158,000 jobs last month, slightly lower than July but pointing to an economy that is still growing at a steady clip against the backdrop of President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China.\n\nEscalations of the trade conflict, and fears over its impact on global growth, drove the FTSE 100\u2019s worst fall this year in August, and it continues to be buffetted by Britain\u2019s chaotic efforts to leave the European Union.\n\nHomebuilder Berkeley (BKGH.L) rose 2% to top the FTSE 100 leader-board after pointing to \u201crobust\u201d market conditions in London and the South East of England despite Brexit uncertainties.\n\nThe comments, coming at a time when the housing market has been strained by Brexit, lifted Berkeley\u2019s peer and Britain\u2019s biggest housebuilder Barratt (BDEV.L) 2% higher as well. Earlier in the week, Barratt had slipped after a muted forecast.", "description": "The FTSE 100 dipped on Friday as markets flattened out ahead of U.S. monthly jobs data, with losses in oil majors and miners overshadowing a rally in house builders on upbeat comments on the market from London-centric developer Berkeley.", "authors": ["Muvija M", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1426828985&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF850NG", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
