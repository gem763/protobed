It caps a fairy tale rise for the Australian, who swapped a professional cricket career with Brisbane Heat in the Big Bash League after moving to the UK to be with her partner, England cricketer Lauren Winfield.\n\nThe 32-year-old scored a try and two goals to help the Rhinos to their second successive Challenge Cup final victory over Castleford in July and the two sides will meet again in the Grand Final at St Helens' Totally Wicked Stadium on Friday.\n\nBut merely an hour after receiving the highest honour in women\u2019s rugby league at Salford\u2019s Lowry Theatre, Queensland-born Hill, who also works as a cricket coach in England, cast doubt on her rugby league future due to the toll the sport has taken on her.\n\n\u201cSometimes on Monday mornings, I wake up and I feel hit by a bus, but I do feel like I\u2019m just learning to understand the game,\u201d said Hill. \u201cBut I think the hardest thing is women\u2019s sport and where it\u2019s at, particularly in rugby league.", "description": "Woman of Steel winner Courtney Hill admits she is tempted to return to professional cricket after hinting the amateur nature of women\u2019s rugby league was becoming unsustainable as a career choice.", "authors": ["Fiona Tomas", "Jim White", "Michael Vaughan"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/rugby-league/2019/10/07/TELEMMGLPICT000211883016-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqplGOf-dgG3z4gg9owgQTXBvGIkM_dKczdIwMGS1GDsQ.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
