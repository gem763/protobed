REUTERS/Andrew Kelly/File Photo\n\nThe National Music Publishers\u2019 Association, a trade group, said on Friday that since suing Peloton in March for copyright infringement, publishers have found a trove of additional songs that the New York-based company knowingly and recklessly offered to customers without first getting required licenses.\n\nThese allegedly included songs from Adele, Beyonce, Ariana Grande, John Legend, Maroon 5, Meek Mill and Taylor Swift, as well as classics such as The Beatles\u2019 \u201cI Saw Her Standing There,\u201d Ray Charles\u2019 \u201cGeorgia On My Mind\u201d and The Who\u2019s \u201cI Can See For Miles.\u201d Publishers want to add 1,324 songs to their lawsuit, the trade group said.\n\n\u201cPeloton fully understood what the copyright law required, having entered licenses with certain other copyright holders, while trampling the rights of plaintiffs by using their musical works for free and without permission,\u201d the publishers said in a proposed amended complaint filed late on Thursday.\n\nU.S. District Judge Denise Cote in Manhattan must grant approval before publishers can pursue their expanded case.\n\nThe proposed complaint was filed two days after Peloton said it planned to raise up to $1.33 billion in an initial public offering, by offering 46 million shares priced between $26 and $29 each.\n\nPeloton said its platform could have been developed only through \u201cclose collaboration\u201d with major labels and music publishers, among others.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to defend ourselves against claims made in this matter and look forward to pursuing our counterclaims,\u201d the company said in an emailed statement.\n\nIn a Friday court filing, Peloton\u2019s lawyers asked Cote to schedule a conference to address the publishers\u2019 and NMPA\u2019s alleged failure to turn over documents relevant to its case, saying the parties had reached an \u201cimpasse.\u201d\n\nFounded in 2012, Peloton sells stationary bicycles starting at $2,245, in packages requiring memberships to access live and on-demand classes from home. Unlimited access costs $39 a month.\n\nThe case is Downtown Music Publishing LLC et al v Peloton Interactive Inc, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 19-02426.", "description": "Music publishers have asked a federal judge to let them double their lawsuit against Peloton Interactive Inc to $300 million, saying the maker of stationary bicycles has streamed more than 2,000 workout videos used without permission.", "authors": ["Jonathan Stempel", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190914&t=2&i=1429614985&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8D000", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
