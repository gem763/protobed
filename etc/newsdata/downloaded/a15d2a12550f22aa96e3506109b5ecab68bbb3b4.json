He fell out with Bielsa last season while he was at Derby and Bielsa admitted to spying on Lampard\u2019s team in training \u2013 and every other club in the Championship.\n\nLampard\u2019s comments about Hudson-Odoi came in the context of a discussion about how much he enjoyed the man-management aspect of his job. He said some young players \u201cneed cajoling, some definitely need some tough words at times\u201d and it sounded as though he felt Hudson-Odoi fitted into the latter category.\n\nChelsea v Brighton & Hove Albion: match preview Read more\n\nThe 18-year-old winger made his comeback from a ruptured achilles on Wednesday in Chelsea\u2019s 7-1 Carabao Cup win over Grimsby, scoring one of the goals late on, but Lampard was critical of him after the game. He said he wanted Hudson-Odoi to work hard in order to get in behind the Grimsby defence, to put himself into dangerous situations inside the box, but he had needed to \u201creinforce that message pretty strongly at half-time\u201d because it had not got through.\n\n\u201cI have to say it as I see it,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cI know Callum\u2019s talent and he has got huge talent. Hence why the club were so keen to get him signed up [to his new contract]. We\u2019re all delighted with that. But there\u2019s a lot of work for Callum to do. Lots of work.\n\n\u201cYou can look around and look at fantastic examples and not even at this club.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like to talk about other club\u2019s players but Raheem Sterling is an incredible example of a player with great talent, whose work ethic added to that talent and improvement in a short period of time through absolute dedication, has seen him become a complete player, who we are all wowed by.\n\n\u201cHe is a great model for Callum because Callum has those talents. I want him to be the absolute best because he has the potential to do that and some of it is about hard truths and I saw some hard truths in the game the other day \u2013 ways that he can improve. He needs to listen to them and he will. Then he can be that player for us.\u201d\n\nLampard said he thought Bielsa\u2019s award was \u201cirony, at first\u201d. Bielsa was commended for ordering his team to let Aston Villa equalise at Elland Road in April, after Leeds had scored while a rival player was down injured.\n\n\u201cI did smile,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cWho votes for it? It\u2019s strange and I think everyone had the same reaction. A lot of news was put to spygate and quite rightly so.\n\n\u201cIt got dealt with in the right way and so when you go and give an award for fair play in the same year, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right.\u201d", "description": "Chelsea\u2019s manager, Frank Lampard, says young winger Callum Hudson-Odoi should use Raheem Sterling as a role model", "authors": ["David Hytner"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6cd8b8efe79648ef114bba6195c872dff3156d2c/0_178_5348_3209/master/5348.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d7a0e7bba560ce86d32a1a2373dc9013", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
