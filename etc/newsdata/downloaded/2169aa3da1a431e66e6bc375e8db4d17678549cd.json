But Pelosi, who\u2019s fighting to protect the moderates who helped her secure the Speaker\u2019s gavel, is publicly treading far more cautiously than Nadler, one of the more aggressive impeachment proponents.\n\nDemocrats across the political spectrum are increasingly frustrated with the party\u2019s muddled message on the impeachment process.\n\n\u201cWe do have a bit of a split personality disorder on this subject,\u201d said Huffman. \u201cIt\u2019s a little confusing to me; I suspect it\u2019s confusing to the American people, too. And I wish we could unify behind this impeachment inquiry that clearly a majority of the caucus wants us to pursue.\u201d\n\nSome Democrats blame Pelosi for compounding confusion as she balances liberals clamoring for impeachment and moderates wary of their reelection prospects.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s contributing to this confusion purposefully,\u201d one Democratic source said.\n\nImpeachment supporters are growing tired of the Speaker\u2019s go-slow approach, while other Democrats note that Pelosi and Nadler simply have different roles to play.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s probably an honest disagreement in the approach here,\u201d said Rep. Ami Bera Amerish (Ami) Babulal BeraDemocrats bicker over strategy on impeachment Seniors deserve access to Health Savings Accounts Democratic lawmakers support Bustos after DCCC resignations MORE (D-Calif.), who holds a seat that has been competitive in past election cycles. \u201cHe\u2019s been a little bit more aggressive; the Speaker\u2019s probably keenly aware of the political implications and where the American public is.\u201d\n\nBoth Pelosi and Nadler dismissed any suggestion of discord between them.\n\n\u201cThe relationship is fine,\u201d Nadler said Wednesday.\n\nBut the two have knocked heads over impeachment for months, particularly after Nadler privately pressed Pelosi in May to greenlight an inquiry.\n\nThe difference is even more stark when it comes to how Pelosi and Nadler talk about impeachment.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I think the president ought to be impeached,\u201d Nadler told WNYC on Monday in some of his strongest comments to date. \u201cImpeachment is imperative not because he\u2019s going to be removed from office \u2014 the Senate won\u2019t do that \u2014 but because we have to vindicate the Constitution.\u201d\n\nJust a few days earlier, Pelosi sounded a more restrained note in her weekly press conference, reiterating on Sept. 12 that impeachment is \u201cvery divisive\u201d and that Democrats \u201ccan\u2019t go there unless we have the facts.\u201d\n\nThe friction between the two apparently flared up last week when Pelosi scolded Judiciary Committee staff in a closed-door meeting for getting ahead of the rest of the caucus, according to Politico.\n\nPelosi\u2019s office declined to comment on the report but downplayed the notion that Pelosi and Nadler have been at odds.\n\n\u201cSpeaker Pelosi has repeatedly said she supports Chairman Nadler and House Judiciary\u2019s investigation to determine whether to recommend articles of impeachment, its procedures and efforts to uncover the truth for the American people,\u201d said Pelosi spokeswoman Ashley Etienne.\n\nDemocrats, who are pursuing several oversight investigations, have sought to make their case for months to the American people about Trump\u2019s conduct as laid out in the Mueller report.\n\nBut the White House has successfully blocked current and former administration officials from testifying using claims of executive privilege. And Democrats on Tuesday struggled to maintain the focus on Lewandowski\u2019s role in events detailed in the Mueller report, in which he was ordered by Trump to pass along a message to then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions Jefferson (Jeff) Beauregard SessionsPelosi: Lewandowski should have been held in contempt 'right then and there' Democrats bicker over strategy on impeachment McCabe says he would 'absolutely not' cut a deal with prosecutors MORE that he should reverse his recusal from the Russia probe.\n\n\u201cEh, it was not the ideal outcome,\u201d one Judiciary Committee source said.\n\nOthers questioned whether Lewandowski\u2019s combative testimony moved their investigation forward, as the Trump loyalist was able to reap praise from the president and tease a 2020 Senate run.\n\nSome Democrats said no real progress was made until Barry Berke, the Democratic counsel who is consulting with the committee, questioned Lewandowski under the panel\u2019s newly adopted impeachment hearing procedures that allow questioning by staff on both sides of the aisle after members finish their rounds.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDemocrats say Berke elicited one of the best moments of the hearing during his cross-examination: Producing an admission from Lewandowski, the committee\u2019s first fact witness, that he repeatedly lied on cable news shows.\n\n\u201cWhen he confessed to all of his rampant lying at the end, it brought to life that he was part of a criminal scheme,\u201d said Rep.

Democrats rejected both the White House limitations and the claims of privileged conversations made by Lewandowski, who never worked in the White House.\n\nYet some are worried Lewandowski set a precedent for other witnesses, if his recalcitrance goes without consequences; others, however, say he is a small fish to fry compared to their primary target.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been asked several times today whether the committee will hold you in contempt. It is certainly under consideration,\u201d Nadler said Tuesday after lawmakers concluded their questioning. \u201cThere is a far more troubling contempt on display today, and that is President Trump Donald John TrumpTrump conversation with foreign leader part of complaint that led to standoff between intel chief, Congress: report Pelosi: Lewandowski should have been held in contempt 'right then and there' Trump to withdraw FEMA chief nominee: report MORE\u2019s role in your refusal to answer questions.\u201d\n\nDemocrats, whose investigations into Trump have burgeoned to include a range of new areas, banked on witness testimonies to help build their case as polling suggests the public isn\u2019t sold on impeachment. But some centrists in crucial swing districts are expressing concern that the persistent focus on impeachment and related investigations could backfire.\n\n\u201cIt is not helpful for Democrats to speak about Corey Lewandowski. It is helpful for Democrats to speak about bold measures in infrastructure, health care costs, anti-corruption \u2026 ways in which we can help people,\u201d said Rep.

You cannot notice they\u2019re chewing gum.
