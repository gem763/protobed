(NASDAQ:SAFT) An Attractive Dividend Stock?", "language": "en", "text": "Could Safety Insurance Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:SAFT) be an attractive dividend share to own for the long haul? Investors are often drawn to strong companies with the idea of reinvesting the dividends. Yet sometimes, investors buy a popular dividend stock because of its yield, and then lose money if the company's dividend doesn't live up to expectations.\n\nWith Safety Insurance Group yielding 3.7% and having paid a dividend for over 10 years, many investors likely find the company quite interesting. We'd guess that plenty of investors have purchased it for the income. Some simple research can reduce the risk of buying Safety Insurance Group for its dividend - read on to learn more.\n\nClick the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis\n\nNasdaqGS:SAFT Historical Dividend Yield, October 10th 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nDividends are usually paid out of company earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Comparing dividend payments to a company's net profit after tax is a simple way of reality-checking whether a dividend is sustainable. Looking at the data, we can see that 47% of Safety Insurance Group's profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. This is a medium payout level that leaves enough capital in the business to fund opportunities that might arise, while also rewarding shareholders. Plus, there is room to increase the payout ratio over time.\n\nConsider getting our latest analysis on Safety Insurance Group's financial position here.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nBefore buying a stock for its income, we want to see if the dividends have been stable in the past, and if the company has a track record of maintaining its dividend. For the purpose of this article, we only scrutinise the last decade of Safety Insurance Group's dividend payments. The dividend has been stable over the past 10 years, which is great. We think this could suggest some resilience to the business and its dividends. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was US$1.60 in 2009, compared to US$3.60 last year. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 8.4% a year over that time.\n\nCompanies like this, growing their dividend at a decent rate, can be very valuable over the long term, if the rate of growth can be maintained.\n\nDividend Growth Potential\n\nDividend payments have been consistent over the past few years, but we should always check if earnings per share (EPS) are growing, as this will help maintain the purchasing power of the dividend. Strong earnings per share (EPS) growth might encourage our interest in the company despite fluctuating dividends, which is why it's great to see Safety Insurance Group has grown its earnings per share at 11% per annum over the past five years. Earnings per share have been growing at a good rate, and the company is paying less than half its earnings as dividends. We generally think this is an attractive combination, as it permits further reinvestment in the business.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhen we look at a dividend stock, we need to form a judgement on whether the dividend will grow, if the company is able to maintain it in a wide range of economic circumstances, and if the dividend payout is sustainable. Firstly, we like that Safety Insurance Group has a low and conservative payout ratio. That said, we were glad to see it growing earnings and paying a fairly consistent dividend. Safety Insurance Group fits all of our criteria, and we think there are a lot of positives to it from a dividend perspective.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Could Safety Insurance Group, Inc.
