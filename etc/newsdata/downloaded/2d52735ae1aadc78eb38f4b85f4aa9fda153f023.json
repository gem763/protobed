She\u2019s actually a good friend of mine. She had just gotten hired after being an intern\u2026 And she was getting\u2026 There was a going-away party for a co-worker. We were all having a really good time\u2026 She was very well-liked. We were getting drunk. He started, like, staying close to her\u2026 Arm around her,\u201d Saleeby recalled.\n\n\u201cShe had a skirt on. I could see the hand. I, like, grab her. It looked like I was being the assaulter because I grabbed her so aggressive\u2026 To keep her from him. Like, go around her and go, \u2018Come over here\u2019 and looked at him because I could flatten him,\u201d the CNN producer added. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do it because then I would be the one who got fired\u2026 He would have absolutely been like, \u2018get in a cab with me later.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cHe had already been accused of the things prior, which I found out later,\u201d he added.\n\nSaleeby later suggests that CNN would have fired Brusk due to today\u2019s \u201c#MeToo\u201d environment, in which \u201cpeople are afraid to do shit.\u201d\n\nIn the second half of the video, CNN media coordinator Nick Neville is seen telling Project Veritas\u2019 \u201cCNN insider\u201d Cary Poarch \u2014 a satellite technician who went undercover while working as a contractor at CNN\u2019s Washington, D.C., office \u2014 that Brusk picked a female staffer over him to be on his team. According to Neville, the unnamed girl signaled the decision to join Brusk was \u201chush-hush.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was this other girl who was like an [News Assistant], I feel like we basically had the same level of experience\u2026and a job just kind of like appeared out of nowhere\u2026and it was never posted online, and this girl always worked pretty closely with Steve, like all of us on the desk would help Steve out with stuff,\u201d said Neville.\n\n\u201cBut this other girl works pretty closely with him and he would email her, I mean, he emails all of us, but he would email and was very friendly to her, the staffer continued. \u201cAnd then she just like got a job like working on his team and she was like, oh it\u2019s hush-hush. The job was never posted anywhere. I was like, what is it? I just thought it was a little strange. Was there an agreement? What happened there?\u201d\n\n\u201cLike I\u2019m saying, that\u2019s open knowledge, but it just kind of like goes along with what he said,\u201d he added.\n\nProject Veritas\u2019s Tuesday\u2019s video is part of a series in which the group is releasing undercover footage from inside CNN aimed at further exposing the network\u2019s bias. Last Monday\u2019s video showed a CNN media coordinator saying Zucker has a \u201cpersonal vendetta\u201d against President Donald Trump, while another video showed a CNN staffer stating the network is \u201ctotally left-leaning.", "description": "Project Veritas released undercover video in which CNN employees accused a longtime producer of sexual misconduct with their co-workers.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/steve-brusk-project-veritas-cnn-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
