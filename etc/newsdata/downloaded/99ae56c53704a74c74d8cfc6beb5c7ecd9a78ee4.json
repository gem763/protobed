I was so tired,\u201d Biles said of her final pose on the stage.\n\n\u201cThis is really the best worlds performance I have ever put out.\u201d\n\nThe Americans took a one-two finish as Sunisa Lee finished with 14.133 for the silver medal, while Russian Angelina Melnikova came third.\n\nBEAM BRILLIANCE\n\nEarlier, Biles delivered a polished routine on the beam before a full twisting double tuck dismount for an impressive 15.066.\n\nAlthough Biles had twice before won the world beam title, in 2014 and 2015, it has not always been plain sailing for her on the apparatus.\n\nHer slip on the landing of a front tucked somersault at the 2016 Rio Olympics meant she had to settle for a bronze in the event. Last year again, she dropped off the beam during the women\u2019s all-around final at the world championships.\n\nBut she has regained her swagger this week, under the watchful eyes of balance beam coach Cecile Landi, and posted top scores in all four attempts \u2014 qualifying, the team and all-around finals and Sunday\u2019s apparatus final.\n\n\u201cIt meant a lot because Cecile has really been working on bringing my confidence back up to where it used to be on the beam,\u201d Biles said.\n\n\u201cTo go out there and nail the routine, just like I do in practice, it felt really good and I knew she was really proud.\u201d\n\nAs another title-winning score was announced in the arena, Biles punched the air in jubilation before joining celebrations with the U.S. team.\n\n\u201cI was really excited,\u201d she added. \u201cI thought it was going to be at least 14.8, 14.9, but to see 15, I was like well that\u2019s pretty crazy, so I was very proud.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (9 Images)\n\nLast year\u2019s winner Liu Tingting of China took silver with 14.433, while team mate Li Shijia won the bronze.\n\nBiles finished her campaign in Stuttgart with five gold medals from six events to mark ideal preparations for next year\u2019s Tokyo Olympics.\n\nHer barnstorming run included a record fifth all-around gold, an individual vault title, as well as helping the U.S. to a fifth straight world team title.", "description": "American Simone Biles became the most decorated gymnast in world championship history on Sunday when she won the beam and floor finals to take her career tally to 25 medals.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191013&t=2&i=1440427132&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9C0JF", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
