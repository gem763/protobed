Giuliani was dispatched Thursday night to respond to a suspicious set of circumstances involving his boss and/or to preempt bad news that might result from it.\n\nAnd as he has been so many times before, Giuliani was both all over the place and possibly more forthcoming than would serve his client\u2019s interests. At one point, he denied that he personally asked Ukraine to investigate unproven allegations involving former vice president and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, only to state 30 seconds later that he had done just that.\n\nBelow is the transcript of his appearance on CNN, with highlights, analysis and fact-checking in yellow.\n\nCHRIS CUOMO: The president\u2019s counselor, former mayor Rudy Giuliani. Good to have you on the show.\n\nGIULIANI: Oh, I\u2019m glad I\u2019m on tonight because what you just said is totally erroneous.\n\nEvery single thing you just said is completely spun in the same direction you\u2019ve been doing for two years with these, \u201cOh, tonight, Papadopoulos is going to prove Russian collusion.\u201d Let me tell you what happened, okay?\n\nCUOMO: Yes.\n\nGIULIANI: What \u2014 what happened is that I was investigating, going back to last year, complaints that the Ukrainian people, several people in Ukraine, knew about a tremendous amount of collusion between Ukrainian officials, and Hillary Clinton, and the Democratic National Committee, including a completely fraudulent document that was produced, in order to begin the investigation of [Paul] Manafort.\n\nThey were trying to get to us. But they were being blocked by the ambassador who was [an] Obama appointee, in Ukraine, who was holding back this information. In the course of investigating that, I found out this incredible story about Joe Biden that he bribed the president of the Ukraine in order to fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son.\n\n[Whistleblower complaint about President Trump involves Ukraine, according to two people familiar with the matter]\n\nThat is an astounding scandal, of major proportions, which all of you have covered up, for about five or six months. You've also covered up the fact that Biden and his son took $1.5 billion out of China.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why the president thinks you\u2019re a corrupt media, because if this would \u2014 President Trump and Donald Trump Jr., and they took millions of dollars from a corrupt oligarch in the Ukraine, and they took $1.5 billion out of China, while the president was negotiating with China, you would be screaming and yelling and going crazy about how corrupt it is. And because it\u2019s Joe Biden, and he\u2019s a protected Democrat, you don\u2019t cover it.\n\nCUOMO: All right.\n\nGIULIANI: This scandal is a scandal \u2014\n\nCUOMO: I \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 of major proportion. Now, was I \u2014\n\nCUOMO: Are you \u2014 are you done now?\n\nGIULIANI: No, I'm not done now.\n\nCUOMO: Because you haven't said anything \u2014 you have well \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: No.\n\nCUOMO: But you can't just talk the whole time, Rudy.\n\nGIULIANI: I have \u2014 I haven't done \u2014 I haven't \u2014 I haven't said anything yet.\n\nCUOMO: You can't say that everything I said was erroneous.\n\nGIULIANI: I haven't said anything yet.\n\nCUOMO: When I didn't say anything that's untrue yet.\n\nGIULIANI: No, you did.\n\n[Why Ukraine being the focus of Trump\u2019s whistleblower complaint is particularly ominous]\n\nCUOMO: By your own reckoning.\n\nGIULIANI: You said I was investigating \u2014\n\nCUOMO: What did I say?\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 it for political purposes. I was not.\n\nCUOMO: You \u2014 I said you \u2014 I said \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: I'm a lawyer, Chris.\n\nCUOMO: I know what you are.\n\nGIULIANI: I'm a defense lawyer.\n\nCUOMO: I know what you are.\n\nGIULIANI: That's protected by the United States Constitution.\n\nCUOMO: Which raises the question why were you investigating this? Why did you back away from the trip when it got scrutiny?\n\nGIULIANI: Because I was told \u2014\n\nCUOMO: Why did you wind up meeting in Spain instead of Ukraine?\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 because I was told that the people at the meeting with the president were people who work for George Soros. And George Soros had been funding this whole thing from the very, very beginning. Not only that. That was corroborated \u2014\n\nCUOMO: That's why you backed away?\n\nGIULIANI: Yes. Because they were going to lie about the conversation I was having with the president.\n\nCUOMO: You have proof that Soros was funding it?\n\nGIULIANI: I \u2014 oh, I absolutely do. I have proof.\n\nCUOMO: How so?\n\nGIULIANI: Okay. George Soros had a \u2014 had a not-for-profit called AntAC. AntAC is the one that developed all of the dirty information that ended up being a false document that was created in order to incriminate Manafort.\n\nCUOMO: Do you have the proof of that?\n\nGIULIANI: They also helped \u2014\n\nCUOMO: That that's who funded all these things?\n\nGIULIANI: Absolutely.\n\nCUOMO: Because, you know, the \u2014 the \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: December \u2014 Chris, Chris \u2014\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 the United States Attorney just found its \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 December \u2014\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 own stuff about Manafort.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 December 16th, 2018, there is a finding by a court in the Ukraine that a man named Telechenko (ph), Yushchenko (ph) \u2014 something like that \u2014 that he produced a phony affidavit that was given to the American authorities and an FBI agent named Greenwood, and they found him guilty of that. Nobody reports that \u2014\n\nCUOMO: All right, so, Rudy \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 in the United States because you don\u2019t report things that are favorable to the president \u2014\n\n[21:05:00] CUOMO: Rudy \u2014 well, that\u2019s not true.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 and negative to Democrats.\n\nCUOMO: But \u2014 but, Rudy, listen.\n\nGIULIANI: Let me go further about finding \u2014\n\nCUOMO: Wait, hold on a second. Let\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s go step by step, because forget about the fact that you said what I said was erroneous, one.\n\nGIULIANI: It is, Chris.\n\nCUOMO: I haven't said \u2014 I didn't say any of the things you're saying now.\n\nGIULIANI: I wasn't \u2014 I was not investigating it \u2014\n\nCUOMO: I don't even know if they're true.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 for political \u2014\n\nCUOMO: But the idea \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: Well, then why did you say I was doing it for political \u2014\n\nCUOMO: Be \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 purposes?\n\nCUOMO: I \u2014 I didn't say political purposes. I said you were going after political \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: I am the president\u2019s \u2014\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 opponents of Mr. Trump.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 I am the \u2014 I am the president\u2019s attorney.\n\nCUOMO: That's what Joe Biden is. That's what Hillary Clinton is.\n\nGIULIANI: Joe Biden is presumed innocent. But somebody\u2019s got to investigate him for going to the president of the Ukraine, and telling him \u2014\n\nCUOMO: That's fine. You just want to make sure that \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 I'm not going to give you \u2014\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 you\u2019re not going there under color of authority of the president.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 but somebody has to investigate it. No, no, no, no.\n\nCUOMO: But let me ask you something else.\n\nGIULIANI: Not because of the authority of the president because when the new prosecutor, that Joe put in, came in, he not only dismissed the case on Hunter Biden, for getting about $6 million in laundered money from \u2014\n\nCUOMO: The prosecutor that was removed, which was the original intrigue on Joe Biden \u2014 that prosecutor was removed, first of all, by consensus of a multiple of Western countries, and it was after Hunter Biden\u2019s stuff was done.\n\nYes, look, you should have your hand on your face. You know why? This is all a distraction from what I asked you first \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: No, it isn't a distraction, Chris.\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 about in the first place, which is \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: What you just said is totally wrong.\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 is it's \u2014 it's not what I just \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: It's completely wrong.\n\nCUOMO: It \u2014 it is totally correct.\n\nGIULIANI: The prosecutor \u2014\n\nCUOMO: And in the factual timeline.\n\nGIULIANI: Chris, you don't know what happened.\n\nCUOMO: The prosecutor was out.\n\nGIULIANI: I know what happened.\n\nCUOMO: How do you know when I don't know?\n\nGIULIANI: You are \u2014 you are just repeating \u2014 you're just repeating spin. The prosecutor \u2014\n\nCUOMO: Oh, but \u2014 but you don't, right?\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 the prosecutor \u2014\n\nCUOMO: You're not spinning anything.\n\nGIULIANI: The \u2014\n\nCUOMO: Go ahead.\n\nGIULIANI: I\u2019m not spinning a d---- thing.\n\nCUOMO: Okay.\n\nGIULIANI: I'm telling you the truth.\n\nCUOMO: Okay.\n\nGIULIANI: The prosecutor was removed because he was investigating the son, and he was investigating Soros\u2019s charity or whatever the hell it was, AntAC. The new prosecutor that came in dismissed both cases, and the president \u2014\n\nCUOMO: The prosecutor who was pushed out was unanimously seen as corrupt, by the way.\n\nGIULIANI: No, he wasn't. He wasn't unanimously seen as corrupt.\n\nCUOMO: All right, so \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: That's an after-the-fact statement. The prosecutor \u2014\n\nCUOMO: What do you mean after-the-fact statement?\n\nGIULIANI: You don't look at Joe Biden \u2014\n\nCUOMO: Was he seen as corrupt or no?\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 who probably is working with half the IQ that you and I have. If you listen to Joe Biden\u2019s tape, he convicts himself. He says, \u2018I told the president of the Ukraine, if you don\u2019t dismiss this guy, you\u2019re not going to get your 1.2\u2014\u2019\n\nCUOMO: All right, so that's what you say \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 billion dollar \u2014\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 Biden said to the Ukraine. Did you to ask the Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden?\n\nGIULIANI: No. Actually, I didn't. I asked the Ukraine to investigate the allegations that there was interference in the election of 2016, by the Ukrainians, for the benefit of Hillary Clinton, for which there already is a court finding \u2014\n\nCUOMO: You never asked anything about Hunter Biden? You never asked anything about Joe Biden \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: The only thing I asked about Joe Biden \u2014\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 and his role with the prosecutor?\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 is to get to the bottom of how it was that Lutsenko who was appointed \u2014\n\nCUOMO: Right.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 dismissed the case against AntAC.\n\nCUOMO: So, you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden?\n\nGIULIANI: Of course, I did.\n\nCUOMO: You just said you didn't.\n\nGIULIANI: No. I didn't ask them to look into Joe Biden. I asked them to look into the allegations that related to my client, which tangentially involved Joe Biden in a massive bribery scheme.\n\nCUOMO: Rudy? Rudy?\n\nGIULIANI: Not unlike what he did in China.\n\nCUOMO: Rudy?\n\nGIULIANI: You explain to me how the kid got $1.5 billion from China \u2014\n\nCUOMO: Rudy, I have no problem with you launching allegations.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 when Joe Biden was still in his \u2014\n\nCUOMO: But just be careful about what you say. I asked you, did you ask Ukraine \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: I am very careful about what I say.\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 to look at Joe Biden, you said \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nGIULIANI: I didn't ask \u2014\n\nCUOMO: Then you went on to say that you did. The \u2014 it's all \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: No, I didn't say that.\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 it's all recorded, Rudy.\n\nGIULIANI: What I said was this. I asked them to investigate the allegations that relate to the false charges against the president of the United States. Those allegations tangentially involved Biden \u2014\n\nCUOMO: So your answer \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 getting the \u2014\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 should have been yes.\n\nGIULIANI: Let me finish, Chris. Let me finish.\n\nCUOMO: Go ahead.\n\nGIULIANI: And don't try to interrupt because you don't like the answer. And you don't like \u2014\n\nCUOMO: Well, I don\u2019t like the evasiveness.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 in what I'm saying. And you don't like \u2014\n\nCUOMO: Evasiveness, I don't like.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 and you want to distort what I'm saying.\n\nCUOMO: I don't want to distort.\n\nGIULIANI: Because it is totally biased.\n\nCUOMO: I'm not biased.\n\nGIULIANI: You are, Chris. It's sad.\n\nCUOMO: Why would I have you on if I were biased?\n\nGIULIANI: Because \u2014\n\nCUOMO: Knowing that we\u2019re going to have this kind of conversation.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 because it is sad to watch what happened to you. It's sad.\n\nCUOMO: Sad with what \u2014 what happened to me?\n\nGIULIANI: You're a total sellout.\n\nCUOMO: I'm a sellout?\n\nGIULIANI: You are a sellout. I'm going to tell you why.\n\nCUOMO: You are telling me that I'm a sellout?\n\nGIULIANI: These are crimes of major proportions. And because they're Democrats, you won't cover it. $1.5 million investment by China in Biden's private equity fund, and the partners are \u2014\n\nCUOMO: I'm not saying that these types of things haven't \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 Kerry's son and \u2014\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 shouldn't be looked at.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 Whitey Bulger's nephew. Do you know that they were partners with Whitey Bulger's nephew?\n\nCUOMO: Rudy, I'm not saying that anything \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: That's outrageous.\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 that you're saying shouldn't be looked at.\n\nGIULIANI: And your corrupt media won't cover it because he's a Democrat.\n\nCUOMO: Rudy, I can't just cover something because you say I should, all right?\n\nGIULIANI: No, you don't have to \u2014\n\nCUOMO: That's not the way it works.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 say I should.\n\nCUOMO: But it got to tell you. You who \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: Read the book.\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 you who my whole lifetime stood up for one simple ideal \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: And I do.\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 when you were at your best \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: And I am standing \u2014 standing up for justice.\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 which was character counts and leadership.\n\nGIULIANI: And you are standing up for two systems of justice.\n\nCUOMO: Oh, I'm standing up for two systems of justice?\n\nGIULIANI: Joe Biden can be involved in bribery. Joe Biden\u2019s son can get $1.5 billion from China, and you won\u2019t cover it. And you want to cover some ridiculous charge that I urged the Ukrainian government to investigate corruption. Well, I did, and I\u2019m proud of it. And you should encourage it \u2014\n\nCUOMO: Well, then it\u2019s not \u2014 then it\u2019s not a ridiculous allegation. You just admitted it.\n\nGIULIANI: It's a ridiculous allegation.\n\nCUOMO: You just admitted it.\n\nGIULIANI: It's a ridiculous allegation.\n\nCUOMO: Rudy, you just admitted \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: Of course, of course, of course, I should \u2014\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 that you did it.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 of course I should.\n\nCUOMO: I'm not saying it was wrong for you to do it. I'm asking you \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: It wasn't wrong for me to do it.\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 if you asked them, and now you're finally saying yes.\n\nGIULIANI: And I am glad that the only way \u2014\n\nCUOMO: Did the president ask the president of Ukraine \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 the only way \u2014 I knew this \u2014\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 to do the same thing?\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 I knew this a year ago. The only way this would come out is if you come after me. Well, fine.\n\nCUOMO: I'm not coming after you.\n\nGIULIANI: Come after me.\n\nCUOMO: I\u2019m asking you questions, okay? And I\u2019m asking you \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: And I'm answering your questions. But you don't like \u2014\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 yes, kind of, kind of \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 the answers.\n\nCUOMO: That\u2019s \u2014 well, some of the answers I don\u2019t love, but I\u2019m letting you give the answers.\n\nGIULIANI: Well, you don\u2019t like the answers, because the answers make out a prima facie case of bribery against a vice president of the United States.\n\nCUOMO: Well, no. They\u2019re your \u2014 they\u2019re your suggestions about it.\n\nGIULIANI: At the time.\n\nCUOMO: And that\u2019s fine. I\u2019m not saying that it doesn\u2019t\u2014\n\nGIULIANI: No, Chris.\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 deserve discussion.\n\nGIULIANI: Let's talk like a \u2014\n\nCUOMO: Will you please answer my question?\n\nGIULIANI: Let's talk like lawyers for a minute.\n\nCUOMO: All right, good, then respect this lawyer asking you \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: Is the crime of bribery \u2014\n\nCUOMO: Hold on. I don't want to hear it.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 is the crime of bribery \u2014 the crime of bribery \u2014\n\nCUOMO: Rudy, Rudy, I don't want to go down the rabbit hole of them right now.\n\nGIULIANI: I taught law. You're going to listen.\n\nThe crime of bribery is if I offer something of value to someone in return for their official action. Joe Biden offered them a 1.5 billion \u2014 billion dollar, $1.2 billion loan guarantee in return for him firing a prosecutor.\n\nCUOMO: And you have proof?\n\nGIULIANI: That is a prima \u2014\n\nCUOMO: That it was a quid pro quo situation, and you can show it?\n\nGIULIANI: Yes. You know what the proof is? Joe Biden, 2018, January, in front of the Council on Foreign Relations, saying the whole thing.\n\nCUOMO: He said \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: He just \u2014\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 I'm going to give you this money if you get rid of this prosecutor?\n\nGIULIANI: 100 percent, exactly.\n\nCUOMO: Send me the transcript.\n\nGIULIANI: Go listen to it and apologize to me. Go listen to it. He said exactly that. But he left one thing out.\n\nCUOMO: Oh! What did he leave out?\n\nGIULIANI: Left out the fact that his son was under investigation \u2014\n\nCUOMO: But isn't that the important thing \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 which is the motive.\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 because he needed to have a motive in order to do it?\n\nGIULIANI: No. The crime actually gets completed when he says, \u2018I\u2019ll give you the $1.2 billion, but you have to fire the prosecutor.\u2019\n\nFor whatever reason he wants the prosecutor fired, you cannot offer something of value in exchange for official action. Crime over with. Motive: The kid was under investigation because he had gotten $6 billion from the most crooked Ukrainian oligarch.\n\nCUOMO: Look, obviously, if they could have \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 a guy named Chenko (ph).\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 shown that Biden was doing something for his son that went beyond \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: Get out of here. Get out.\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 questionable ethics.\n\nGIULIANI: You believe that, Chris \u2014\n\nCUOMO: All right, listen.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 then go somewhere on an island.\n\nCUOMO: Listen, but I'll tell you what.\n\nGIULIANI: No. They wouldn't do it.\n\nCUOMO: I wish you had this same attitude when I was asking you \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: And not only that. Not only that.\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 about all the ridiculous things that this president has tried to \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: You guys don't cover \u2014\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 pass off as truth.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 You don\u2019t cover corruption \u2014\n\nCUOMO: No, you\u2019re all about incredulous.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 against Democrats the way you cover corruption \u2014\n\nCUOMO: Yes. All right, you know, it's easy for you to say.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 against Republicans. If suppose \u2014\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 when the current administration is the one we\u2019re look at, right?\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 suppose \u2014 suppose Donald Trump Jr.\u2014\n\nCUOMO: Why don\u2019t you wait for a Democratic administration and then level the charge?\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 got $6 billion \u2014 got $1.5 billion from China while Trump is negotiating with China \u2014\n\nCUOMO: It would be a problem.\n\nGIULIANI: You're d--- right. Well \u2014\n\nCUOMO: It would be a big problem.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 well, how come you\u2019re not covering the fact that that happened with \u2014\n\nCUOMO: Because I don't know that it did.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 Vice President Biden.\n\nCUOMO: That's why.\n\nGIULIANI: You know what happened.\n\nCUOMO: You're making it sound like he did it to help his son.\n\nGIULIANI: I'll give you a book.\n\nCUOMO: And I don't know that he did it to help his son.\n\nGIULIANI: It's written in a book.\n\nCUOMO: And he said he didn't do it to help his son.\n\nNow, will you finally answer my question now that we're 12 minutes in it?\n\nGIULIANI: Well, do we really believe \u2014\n\nCUOMO: Did the president \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 we really believe he didn't know his son was under investigation?\n\nCUOMO: Why won't you answer the question?\n\nGIULIANI: What was the question?\n\nCUOMO: What is it with you?\n\nGIULIANI: What's the question?\n\nCUOMO: Thank you. Did the president talk to the Ukrainian president about what he wanted done with Joe Biden and what he wanted done with Paul Manafort?\n\nGIULIANI: I have no idea. I never asked him that. I don\u2019t know if he did. And I wouldn\u2019t care if he did. He had every right to do it at the president of the United States.\n\nHe had every right to say to the Ukrainian president: We have two outstanding allegations of massive corruption and \u2014\n\nCUOMO: Did he ask you to do \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 you should investigate it.\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 what you're doing?\n\nGIULIANI: No. I did what I did on my own. And then I told him \u2014\n\nCUOMO: Really?\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 about it afterwards because I\u2019m his lawyer, and I know how to investigate \u2014\n\nCUOMO: So, you never talk to him about it before \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 and I \u2014\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 you only talk to him about it after.\n\nGIULIANI: Three months after I found out about it, and then I found out that it was true, by getting signed sworn statements, from five people in the Ukraine, who said that we were brought into the White House, the Obama White House, and we were told, go dig up dirt on Trump and Manafort in January of 2016. You have no idea how big this is because you're blinded.\n\nCUOMO: I loved \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: You're blinded by \u2014\n\nCUOMO: Give me \u2014 give me the affidavits.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 your prejudice.\n\nCUOMO: Give me the affidavits. I appreciate the personal insults.\n\nGIULIANI: I'm not going to give you the affidavit.\n\nCUOMO: Well, why not?\n\nGIULIANI: I'll give them in court. I'm not going to give them to you.\n\nCUOMO: So go present them.\n\nGIULIANI: Who are you?\n\nCUOMO: Who am I? I'm a journalist.\n\nGIULIANI: I'll give them to a court.\n\nCUOMO: You keep saying that \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: But you're not the FBI.\n\nCUOMO: Hold on, hold on, Rudy, Rudy.\n\nGIULIANI: You can't indict anybody.\n\nCUOMO: You \u2014 you want to say I won't cover it because I'm like this, right, you say?\n\nGIULIANI: Oh, man, when I \u2014 when I watched the introduction to your show \u2014\n\nCUOMO: But now you won't give me the proof.\n\nGIULIANI: I'm not going to give you proof.\n\nCUOMO: What?\n\nGIULIANI: What can you do? You can't indict anybody.\n\nCUOMO: I\u2019m \u2014 So what?\n\nGIULIANI: Believe me. The proof is in the right hands. And you're going to find out about it. And I \u2014 I used to think you'll be embarrassed when you find out what happened. But you know something?\n\nCUOMO: Why would I be embarrassed by the truth \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: You'll find some other excuse \u2014\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 coming out?\n\nGIULIANI: Because you should have been embarrassed \u2014\n\nCUOMO: Why would I be embarrassed?\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 when there was no Russian collusion. You should have apologized for all the coverage that you did about \u2014\n\nCUOMO: Why would I apologize?\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 Russian collusion.\n\nCUOMO: I was one of the \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: You should.\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 first to say that there is no crime of collusion. I was one of the first to say that \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: Yes. But then you went to say, well, he did other things wrong.\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 there is no such thing as collusion as a crime.\n\nGIULIANI: He did this wrong.\n\nCUOMO: He did do other things wrong.\n\nGIULIANI: Look, you guys are \u2014\n\nCUOMO: And you know it.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 you guys are on a mission.\n\nCUOMO: And the Rudy Giuliani who was a prosecutor \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: Do you think I'm a fool?\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 and a mayor knew what right was.\n\nGIULIANI: You think I'm a fool?\n\nCUOMO: And what wrong was before he became a lawyer \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: You're on a mission \u2014\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 for this guy.\n\nGIULIANI: You're on a mission to get this guy no matter what. And you know something?\n\nCUOMO: That couldn't be farther from the truth.\n\nGIULIANI: Whatever he did is nothing compared to what Biden did. And when you find out \u2014\n\nCUOMO: Listen, all \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 you should be embarrassed but you won't.\n\nCUOMO: All right, fine, fine.\n\nGIULIANI: You'll find another excuse.\n\nCUOMO: I, look, I \u2014 I\u2019m very \u2014 I\u2019m very interested in your personal insults of me. We can meet some other time.\n\nGIULIANI: I'm not \u2014 I'm not \u2014 I'm not personally insulting you.\n\nCUOMO: And you can say it all to me face-to-face. And we can get it out.\n\nGIULIANI: I am institutionally \u2014\n\nCUOMO: The hell you\u2019re not! But that\u2019s okay.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 insulting you. Chris \u2014\n\nCUOMO: That\u2019s \u2014 okay, that\u2019s okay. That\u2019s what you want to do.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 I'm institutionally insulting you because \u2014\n\nCUOMO: You're institutionally insulting me.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 your coverage is horrendous.\n\nCUOMO: All right, fine. Let me \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: It is so unfair, and it shocks \u2014\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 ask you this. If the \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 me as a person who fought for justice all his life.\n\nCUOMO: Well, let me tell you. It gets called into \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: It is shocking to me.\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 question with what you've been doing as counsel in this particular case.\n\nGIULIANI: What I've been doing as counsel \u2014\n\nCUOMO: Yes, that's right.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 is represent my client in the best spirit and in the best way that I can do as a lawyer. And I vindicated him. And now, I am proving that what happened to him was a frame-up.\n\nCUOMO: You didn't vindicate him.\n\nGIULIANI: You\u2019re d--- right I vindicated him.\n\nCUOMO: You kept him out of \u2014 you kept him out of the chair.\n\nGIULIANI: All you did \u2014 all you did was Russian collusion, Russian collusion, Russian collusion.\n\nCUOMO: You kept him out of the chair with Mueller, and that was the best thing you did. And that was a great move.\n\nGIULIANI: And you know what you're going to find out? It was Ukrainian collusion with Hillary Clinton \u2014\n\nCUOMO: Well, what we\u2019re finding out right now \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 that she paid $1.1 million for \u2014\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 is that an intel official \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 and Joe Biden \u2014 and the Joe Biden family \u2014\n\nCUOMO: Fine. Let's \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 has been selling his office \u2014\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 Look, you don\u2019t want to give me the \u2014 the proof. That\u2019s fine. When it comes out \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: I don't have to give you the proof.\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 I'll cover it.\n\nGIULIANI: Go read it.\n\nCUOMO: I'm not saying you have to. It'd be nice \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: It's written in books.\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 is all I'm saying.\n\nGIULIANI: You just won\u2019t read it. It\u2019s all over the Internet.\n\nCUOMO: You \u2014 you send \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: Go read it.\n\nCUOMO: All over the Internet!\n\nGIULIANI: I have the proof. I could \u2014\n\nCUOMO: You send me the affidavits you have of people who give sworn statements of what you said \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: I don\u2019t even need affidavits. All I need is Joe Biden\u2019s statement on television that he told the president of the Ukraine I\u2019m going to hold back the $1.2 billion \u2014\n\nCUOMO: Right. And he said it had nothing to do \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 I'm going to finish this sentience that I'm going to \u2014\n\nCUOMO: You said it five times. Say it again.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 hold back the $1.2 billion if you don't fire the prosecutor. That is the crime of bribery \u2014\n\nCUOMO: Fine.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 in every country in the world.\n\nCUOMO: He doesn't agree with you.\n\nGIULIANI: And then, if you want a motive for it, his son was under an investigation. And if he didn't notice his son was under investigation \u2014\n\nCUOMO: No. He said he had nothing \u2014 it had nothing to do with him.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 then he is truly mentally ill.\n\nCUOMO: Now, listen, Rudy, the \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: You don't think I would know my son was under investigation? You don't think when I took my son to China \u2014\n\nCUOMO: I'm saying that if you said that you did something \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 and he came back with a billion dollars, I wouldn't know it?\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 and it had nothing to do with your son. I'd have to have proof of otherwise. Now \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: How about circumstantial evidence?\n\nCUOMO: Rudy, let me ask \u2014 can I \u2014 can I ask you \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: How about circumstantial evidence?\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 one thing about the news today so that we can \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: Sure. Whatever you \u2014 whatever you \u2014 whatever you \u2014\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 get a little bit of \u2014 little bit of an understanding about national security considerations? Is that all right? Okay?\n\nGIULIANI: Sure.\n\nCUOMO: Thank you.\n\nGIULIANI: The national security consideration you should be worried about \u2014\n\nCUOMO: Oh, here we go.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 is how a compromised Ukraine \u2014\n\nCUOMO: Is that Joe Biden with his son and the thing, right.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 how they \u2014 how they completely compromised Ukraine \u2014\n\nCUOMO: Right, now \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 in 2016.\n\nCUOMO: And here's what we \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: And used them as an arm of the Democratic National Committee.\n\nCUOMO: Okay. I hear you. Whenever you want the proof to come out, and it comes out, and we can cover it, and I can see what you\u2019re talking about \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: No, you won't. No, you won't. No, you won't.\n\nCUOMO: All right. So, you \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: I \u2014 I have no confidence that you will.\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 You won\u2019t give \u2014 you won\u2019t give \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: I used to think that six months ago.\n\nCUOMO: I know. But and \u2014 and you won't give me the proof.\n\nGIULIANI: I do not believe.\n\nCUOMO: All right, fine.\n\nGIULIANI: I believe your network will cover it up.\n\nCUOMO: All right, all right.\n\nGIULIANI: I believe your network will spin it \u2014\n\nCUOMO: Okay. Well we\u2019ll see.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 against us that we created it.\n\nCUOMO: You \u2014 you won't give us the proof. But you think we'll spin it. I got you. So \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: I'm not going to give you the proof.\n\nCUOMO: I know. I heard you five times.\n\nGIULIANI: I'm going to give the proof to authorities.\n\nCUOMO: Look, here's what I want to ask you.\n\nGIULIANI: There's enough proof \u2014\n\nCUOMO: This \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: There's enough proof for you go after it.\n\nCUOMO: All right, fine. This U.S.\u2014\n\nGIULIANI: If you are being honest and fair.\n\nCUOMO: Okay. So, this U.S. intel official who worked in the White House says he hears something on a phone call, we believe, with the president of Ukraine. That\u2019s what The Washington Post has, that troubled him. So, he formed the \u2014 he lodged the complaint with the inspector general.\n\nGIULIANI: Good.\n\nCUOMO: Now, there's one legal fight going on between the I.G. and the DNI. That is what it is. But I want to ask you this. You say \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: Well, who \u2014 who is this guy? I have no idea who he is.\n\nCUOMO: Well, neither do I.\n\nGIULIANI: I'm here \u2014 I'm here on television telling you everything I did. This guy is hiding somewhere \u2014\n\nCUOMO: Well, whistleblowers \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 and skulking around.\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 whistleblowers deserve protection.\n\nGIULIANI: And you \u2014\n\nCUOMO: We both know that. But\u2014\n\nGIULIANI: Yes. They do. And whistleblowers are liars, right?\n\nCUOMO: Okay. But I\u2019m just saying so \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: Little of both.\n\nCUOMO: Well, it\u2019d be nice. Look, if you\u2019re not worried about anything \u2014 it\u2019s interesting question.\n\nGIULIANI: So why \u2014 how \u2014 how about we take a impartial position and we say this whistleblower could be telling the truth.\n\nCUOMO: Yes, or he could be lying.\n\nGIULIANI: Or this whistleblower could be a Democrat holdover.\n\nCUOMO: Yes.\n\nGIULIANI: Who was trying to destroy \u2014\n\nCUOMO: And he could be lying.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 Donald Trump.\n\nCUOMO: And he could be destroying \u2014 he could try to be doing that. 100 percent.\n\nGIULIANI: Like a lot of people have done.\n\nCUOMO: A 100 percent. So, in your opinion, now \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: Like the stupid New York Times story the other day, right?\n\nCUOMO: Now, listen, if \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: Did you cover that?\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 if \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: How the Times really s----wed up the other day?\n\nCUOMO: Listen, if the \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: Did you cover it?\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 if the complaint had come out \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: You don't answer that.\n\nCUOMO: Well, I\u2019m trying to get a question out to you about this.\n\nGIULIANI: Okay. Well, Chris, what \u2014 what do you \u2014\n\nCUOMO: Because this kind of matters to me.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 what do you want to know?\n\nCUOMO: I got to be honest, Okay?\n\nGIULIANI: Okay. Well, try.\n\nCUOMO: So, if \u2014 if the complaint goes to the I.G., we\u2019ll both know what the law is, okay, the DNI and the I.G. have a disagreement about whether or not they\u2019re supposed to get it. The DNI then says, reportedly, \u201cThere is someone above us that does not want this to be discovered \u2014 delivered to Congress.\u201d If \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: I don't even know what you're talking about. There's somebody above us doesn't want to be delivered it to.\n\nCUOMO: Above the DNI.\n\nGIULIANI: What are we talking about?\n\nCUOMO: I don't that \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: I don't know about this \u2014\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 that's why I'm asking you. Who \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 conversation.\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 what power in the executive branch above the DNI would not want this kind of complaint delivered to Congress?\n\nGIULIANI: I have no \u2014 I have no idea why they \u2014 why they would or why they wouldn't. All I can tell you is if what is reported is true, it doesn't make a d---. It doesn't make any difference.\n\nIf the president of the United States said to the president of Ukraine: \u2018Investigate the corruption in your country that has a bearing on our 2016 election,\u2019 isn\u2019t that what he\u2019s supposed to do?\n\nCUOMO: What if he said \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: That is what he\u2019s supposed \u2014 unless you assume that the president\u2019s guilty.\n\nCUOMO: What if he said \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: As opposed to the fact that those people in the Ukraine were trying to frame the president \u2014\n\nCUOMO: What if he said \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 which is exactly what they were doing.\n\nCUOMO: What if he said I have $250 million \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: Oh, man!\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 that you want.\n\nGIULIANI: If he said that?\n\nCUOMO: Why don't you investigate \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: Hold God! That would be really\u2014\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 what's happening with Joe Biden and what's happening and \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: Is it but you know \u2014\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 what you did to me in 2016.\n\nGIULIANI: Isn't that \u2014\n\nCUOMO: And I'll give you the $250 million.\n\nGIULIANI: Isn't that exactly what Joe Biden did and admitted on tape in \u2014\n\nCUOMO: So, you so \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 in 2018.\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 so if \u2014 so if the president said that \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: No, wait a second. Wait a second, Chris. Stop going.\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 you think it was wrong?\n\nGIULIANI: Can I \u2014 You asked me the question. You got to take the answer. You can\u2019t cut \u2014 cut if off.\n\nCUOMO: No. I don't have to take it. You can't run in an \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: No, no.\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 opposite direction towards Joe Biden \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: No, I'm not running in an opposite direction.\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 every time I ask you something about the instant case.\n\nGIULIANI: I am \u2014 I am making a point, which I'm entitled to make, if you want to hear from me. If you don't want to hear from me, just cut me off. So, the \u2014\n\nCUOMO: No, I will never cut you off.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 the fact is \u2014\n\nCUOMO: Go ahead.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 the fact is what you\u2019re saying to me is completely equivalent with what Joe Biden admitted on tape two years ago, and you didn\u2019t cover, which is, \u2018I told the president of the Ukraine, you\u2019re not going to get your $1.2 billion, unless you fire the prosecutor.\u2019\n\nHow come you didn't cover that? How come I wasn't called on here the night that that happened? Because you're not fair. You're not fair in your coverage.\n\nCUOMO: Okay.\n\nGIULIANI: Would you please recognize that? Now, I'll tell you about Trump, right?\n\nCUOMO: Go ahead.\n\nGIULIANI: I have \u2014 I have no knowledge that the president ever said anything. I don\u2019t even know about the $250 million \u2014\n\nCUOMO: Okay.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 in \u2014 in aid. I have no \u2014 no knowledge of that. I just know about me \u2014 various meetings \u2014\n\nCUOMO: When you're done \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 they were going to have.\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 I'll tell you why I'm asking.\n\nGIULIANI: But the reality is that the president of the United States, well, whoever he is, has every right to tell the president of another country, you better straighten out the corruption in your country, if you want me to give you a lot of money, because if you are so d--- corrupt that you can\u2019t investigate allegations of corruption \u2014\n\nCUOMO: That would be fine.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 our money is going to get squandered.\n\nCUOMO: That would be fine.\n\nGIULIANI: And don't you think that's happened in the Ukraine under Yanukovych?\n\nCUOMO: I think that there was a lot of corruption.\n\nGIULIANI: You don't think all that money that Obama gave him was squandered?\n\nCUOMO: I think there was a lot of corruption.\n\nGIULIANI: Of course, it was. The guy was working for Russia \u2014\n\nCUOMO: All right, so \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 while Joe \u2014 while Joe and Obama \u2014\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 here's why I ask you the question.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 were giving him billions.\n\nCUOMO: Here's why I ask you the question.\n\nGIULIANI: But nobody covers that.\n\nCUOMO: Here's why I ask you the question. So \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: Okay.\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 the president has this conversation. There\u2019s something in the conversation that\u2019s troubling enough for someone to lodge a complaint under the whistleblower statute about it.\n\nGIULIANI: Who knows who this person and what motive he has?\n\nCUOMO: Okay. But just \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: Half the people in the government \u2014\n\nCUOMO: Hey, Rudy, we covered that.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 half the people in the \u2014\n\nCUOMO: I'm \u2014 I'm trying to tell you my premise for the question.\n\nGIULIANI: You don\u2019t think there\u2019s a deep state?\n\nCUOMO: Listen.\n\nGIULIANI: Of course, there is.\n\nCUOMO: I think there\u2019s a little bit of a \u201cdeep state\u201d going on \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: I know it. I've confronted it.\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 right in this conversation right now. What I'm trying to say is \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: I\u2019m a deep state? I\u2019m totally transparent, Chris.\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 after Adam Schiff \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: I go on television. I answer the questions.\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 after \u2014 well, not so great tonight.\n\nGIULIANI: I don't lodge anonymous \u2014\n\nCUOMO: I got to be honest.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 I don't lodge anonymous complaints.\n\nCUOMO: You know, you've been very insulting. You've been very circumspect \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: Yes, I'm very, Chris \u2014\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 and very distracting.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 I'm very insulting directly to your face.\n\nCUOMO: So \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: Not behind your back.\n\nCUOMO: Well, yes.\n\nGIULIANI: And I don't do anonymous sources or let me skulk around and scoot somebody up.\n\nCUOMO: No, I know. But it's also not very fair what you're saying.\n\nGIULIANI: If I don't like \u2014\n\nCUOMO: But let me get back to what matters.\n\nGIULIANI: If I don't like what you're doing, I'd tell you.\n\nCUOMO: I understand.\n\nGIULIANI: And I think your network is corrupt \u2014\n\nCUOMO: I know. I heard you the first five times.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 in the way they cover \u2014\n\nCUOMO: And yet, here I am, giving 20-plus \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 the way they cover the president.\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 minutes to the president\u2019s lawyer to make the case \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: Yes, you're \u2014\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 on national television.\n\nGIULIANI: Right.\n\nCUOMO: Hmm! Boy, do I hide the ball?\n\nGIULIANI: Go cover \u2014 go cover Biden's bribery \u2014\n\nCUOMO: So, look, one \u2014 one sticky \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 in Ukraine. Go cover him taking \u2014\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 wicket at a time.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014$1.5 billion out of China.\n\nCUOMO: Let me ask you \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: And then I'll respect you again.\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 this question because I want your \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: Then I'll respect you again.\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 lawyer\u2019s mind. Listen, if I \u2014 if \u2014 listen \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: Not just you.\n\nCUOMO: You respect \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: Your network.\n\nCUOMO: You respect \u2014 no, no, you keep saying it.\n\nGIULIANI: It's in the tank.\n\nCUOMO: So let's \u2014 let's \u2014 deal with me. You say whatever you want.\n\nGIULIANI: I am dealing with you.\n\nCUOMO: You respect me. You don't respect me. That's on you.\n\nGIULIANI: I don't respect the way you're covering the fact \u2014\n\nCUOMO: I live my life. I do my job the way I think.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 that there was a \u2014\n\nCUOMO: Fine.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 massive \u2014\n\nCUOMO: So \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 there was a massive scandal involving Joe Biden.\n\nCUOMO: I hear it. I've let you say it 10 times.\n\nGIULIANI: In the billions of dollars.\n\nCUOMO: I've heard it.\n\nGIULIANI: And you are not covering it.\n\nCUOMO: I know. But you are also you are doing everything you can to spin away from what I'm trying to ask you about.\n\nGIULIANI: I am not. The president did nothing wrong.\n\nCUOMO: You said you know nothing about anything.\n\nGIULIANI: Zero. Wrong.\n\nCUOMO: The president, who\u2019s your client \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: He did nothing wrong.\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 knew nothing about what you were doing for him in the Ukraine.\n\nGIULIANI: He did what a president \u2014 what an honest \u2014\n\nCUOMO: He only knew after.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 decent president should do.\n\nCUOMO: Very convenient. So then, this is what I want to ask you about.\n\nHe has this conversation. The person gets upset and files the complaint. After Adam Schiff sends the letter, to the DNI, saying I want that complaint, the $250 million is released to the Ukraine that had been held back all this time.\n\nGIULIANI: I don't know anything about that except for the fact that if Adam Schiff sent me a letter, I would just tear it up, and throw it in the garbage.\n\nCUOMO: Yes, yes, yes, of course, of course. Why did they release the money right after Adam Schiff?\n\nGIULIANI: I \u2014 I don't know. I have no idea. I don't \u2014\n\nCUOMO: You don't think that's co \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 I don't run the government.\n\nCUOMO: Listen, you're spinning things together at a whole cloth.\n\nGIULIANI: I'm not spinning anything, Chris.\n\nCUOMO: Now, you're not curious about that.\n\nGIULIANI: I'm not serious about what?\n\nCUOMO: You\u2019re not curious about the $250 million getting \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: Okay. You want to talk hypothetically?\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 getting released only after \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: I can only talk hypothetically about it.\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 there are questions about what was said to the president of Ukraine.\n\nGIULIANI: If the president of the United States said to the president of any country, I have \u2014 I am not going to give you money because your country is corrupt. You got to straighten out these problems.\n\nCUOMO: We don't know that that's what he said.\n\nGIULIANI: Well, I don\u2019t know what he said either.\n\nCUOMO: And \u2014 and \u2014 and but why would that upset \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: We don't know what he said because \u2014\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 an intel official. Why would an intel official \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 we're having a \u2014 you and I are talking about \u2014\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 get upset by that?\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 an anonymous informant.\n\nCUOMO: That's right.\n\nGIULIANI: We have no idea if he's credible or not. And you're making a big deal out of it because \u2014\n\nCUOMO: Well \u2014 well \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 you want to make a big deal.\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 we don't know nothing.\n\nGIULIANI: Wait, wait. D---it.\n\nCUOMO: The inspector general \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: Let me finish.\n\nCUOMO: No, I got \u2014 I got to cut you. You've been talking the whole time.\n\nGIULIANI: No. You can't cut me off.\n\nCUOMO: The inspector general \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: This isn't \u2014\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 knew enough about \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: You only cut me off because this is \u2014\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 what was said \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 this is a program with an agenda as opposed doing a program \u2014\n\nCUOMO: Listen, the agenda is to get some truth \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 that wanted to cover the truth.\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 and not spin. The inspector general assessed the whistleblower complaint. They found it urgent enough to want to go to the DNI \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: But they don't know all \u2014\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 and under the statute.\n\nGIULIANI: The only thing the inspector general can do is look at the \u2014 look at what the person says, and say we have to investigate it. He has no idea if the person is honest, dishonest or crazy.\n\nCUOMO: Really? You don't think part of what the I.G. is doing is assessing the credibility of the person who comes forward with the complaint?\n\nGIULIANI: 100 percent, they have no idea how to do that.\n\nCUOMO: What do you mean he doesn't know how to do that?\n\nGIULIANI: No idea how to do it.\n\nCUOMO: How could you say that?\n\nGIULIANI: And, by the way, it is perfectly appropriate for a president to say to a leader of a foreign country, investigate this massive bribe \u2014\n\nCUOMO: I know. But if it was in general \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 that was paid by a former vice president \u2014\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 and it was specific, and it was quid pro quo \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 that our media in America is covering up.\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 that would be troubling and then the money got released right after Adam Schiff asked for the complaint. That's what I wanted to ask you about.\n\nGIULIANI: All right, so you got to ask somebody else about that.\n\nCUOMO: I appreciate your take on it.\n\nGIULIANI: I don\u2019t know the \u2014\n\nCUOMO: I will.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 I don't know the answer to why it was released. But I find nothing wrong in what he did. I find a lot wrong \u2014\n\nCUOMO: You don't even know what he did.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 I find a lot wrong in what you are covering up.\n\nCUOMO: Believe me, I'm well aware.\n\nGIULIANI: And what you continue to cover up, and what your network continues to cover up \u2014\n\nCUOMO: And I'm telling you, you give me proof \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 which you'll make what \u2014\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 of what you found.\n\nGIULIANI: I have proof.\n\nCUOMO: I will vet it and put it \u2014 give it to me.\n\nGIULIANI: Go look \u2014 go look at Joe Biden \u2014\n\nCUOMO: I did. Everybody has heard that video.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 January of 2018 admitting \u2014\n\nCUOMO: It's not a new story.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 bribery, 100 percent.\n\nCUOMO: He does not admit bribery \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: Go look.\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 a 100 percent because he says \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: Go look.\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 there \u2014 there was no quid pro quo. He wasn't doing it for his son.\n\nGIULIANI: He didn't say that. He didn't say that.\n\nCUOMO: He said I'm not doing it for my son.\n\nGIULIANI: He left his son out of the conversation. He just said I told the president of the Ukraine \u2014\n\nCUOMO: When he's been asked about this, he said, I did nothing for my son and the timing \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: A year later.\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 doesn't match up.\n\nGIULIANI: A year later.\n\nCUOMO: That's when he was asked.\n\nGIULIANI: And he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t know my son was under investigation.\u201d\n\nCUOMO: All right, Rudy, look \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: Garbage!\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 no matter \u2014 no matter what I hear tonight after this interview \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: Completely not true. And you are \u2014\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 I won't \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 you are now \u2014\n\nCUOMO: Yes, what am I now?\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 engaging in all kinds of fantasies \u2014\n\nCUOMO: What am I \u2014 What am I now?\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 about the president when there\u2019s clear proof about a Democrat, and you can\u2019t handle it.\n\nCUOMO: What?\n\nGIULIANI: And how about we go to China when he flew his son there on Air Force Two \u2014\n\nCUOMO: Listen, Rudy \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 and eight days later, the son \u2014\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 I don't know what any of this has to do \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 got 1.2 \u2014\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 with what I've been asking you about tonight.\n\nGIULIANI: What it has to do with \u2014\n\nCUOMO: I got to be honest.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 how unfair you are. Do you get that?\n\nCUOMO: It's unfair for me to not \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: It's unfair.\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 want to tolerate you talking about Joe Biden all night long when we have an inspector general, fighting with the DNI, fighting with Congress, over a whistleblower complaint that involves this president \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: So, we have an anonymous whistleblower compliant \u2014\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 and you and what you've been doing playing with Ukraine.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 we have an anonymous whistleblower compliant compared to clear proof \u2014\n\nCUOMO: All right, I got to go, Rudy.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 that Biden's son got $1.5 billion from China. And you won't cover it. Tell me you're not unfair.\n\nCUOMO: Rudy, I told you. Give me the proof.\n\nGIULIANI: Nobody \u2014 nobody buys that, Chris.\n\nCUOMO: But I'm \u2014 I'm sure they buy \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: That's why your network has no ratings.\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 I'm sure they buy that \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: They buy the fact that you are in the tank \u2014\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 everything you are saying right now has nothing to do with \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 of the Democratic Party.\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 distracting from what this president\u2019s problems \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: I am not distracting.\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 might be.\n\nGIULIANI: What I am pointing out \u2014\n\nCUOMO: You\u2019ve been doing it for over a year and a half, okay?\n\nGIULIANI: I haven't been doing that.\n\nCUOMO: The hell you haven't.\n\nGIULIANI: What I've been doing is pointing out how unfair you are \u2014\n\nCUOMO: You've been distracting from the truth \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 and how you tried to frame the president.\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 for a year and a half, and I hope you enjoy it.\n\nGIULIANI: And you're doing it again.\n\nCUOMO: Because this president got the benefit of something you built up for decades, your credibility, and you put it on the line for him.\n\nGIULIANI: I'll put my credibility on the line \u2014\n\nCUOMO: Good choice.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 1,000 percent. And I think your network is a horror to this country.\n\nCUOMO: That's fine.\n\nGIULIANI: You are undermining \u2014\n\nCUOMO: That's \u2014 and I \u2014 yet I still have you on.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 you are undermining fairness and justice in this country.\n\nCUOMO: And yet, I still had you on.\n\nGIULIANI: When a vice president \u2014\n\nCUOMO: I'm so unfair that I had you on.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 of the United States can come out of China eight days later \u2014\n\nCUOMO: And I've had you say that a dozen times \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 with $1.5 billion, and you won't cover it.\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 on my air. And I've asked you for proof.\n\nGIULIANI: Tell me you're not corrupt.\n\nCUOMO: And I have you on anyway \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: I have proof.\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 even with all this trash coming out of out.\n\nGIULIANI: There is proof. The proof has been there for two years.\n\nCUOMO: All right.\n\nGIULIANI: And you're covering it up. And the proof of his bribery \u2014\n\nCUOMO: I got you. Rudy, send the proof whenever you want.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 is from his own mouth. And you're covering it up.\n\nCUOMO: I hear up.\n\nGIULIANI: And you covered up so much more about Hillary.\n\nCUOMO: I'm covering it up so much \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: It\u2019s disgusting.\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 that I've kept this interview going 28 minutes, and let you say it a dozen times.\n\nGIULIANI: Yes, and interrupted me 500 times.\n\nCUOMO: That's how afraid of it I am.\n\nGIULIANI: To try to stop me from \u2014\n\nCUOMO: Well, you\u2019ve made two points.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 telling the American people \u2014\n\nCUOMO: You've made two points.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 what's actually going on \u2014\n\nCUOMO: You've made two points.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 so you can continue to mislead them \u2014\n\nCUOMO: All right.\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 which is what you're doing.\n\nCUOMO: Well, you\u2019ve been here the whole time, so you\u2019re part of it now. You\u2019re co-conspirator.\n\nGIULIANI: I'm not part of misleading.\n\nCUOMO: Rudy Giuliani \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: Everything I said, I can document.\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 Thank you \u2014 give it to me.\n\nGIULIANI: Every single thing I said I can document.\n\nCUOMO: Then give me the documents. Thank you.\n\nGIULIANI: I'm not going to give you the documents. Why would I give you the documents?\n\nCUOMO: Because you want the truth to come out.\n\nGIULIANI: You're not going to use them for a good purpose.\n\nCUOMO: You're not making any sense to me on this point.\n\nGIULIANI: If I trusted you \u2014 of course I'm making sense.\n\nCUOMO: All right, now you don't trust me either. All right, Rudy Giuliani \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: Why would I give the enemy the documents?\n\nCUOMO: Oh, now I\u2019m the enemy?\n\nGIULIANI: You are not fair.\n\nCUOMO: Now I'm the enemy?\n\nGIULIANI: You are not impartial.\n\nCUOMO: Great!\n\nGIULIANI: You are totally biased.\n\nCUOMO: Rudy, anything else?\n\nGIULIANI: And your network is the creature of the Democratic National Committee.\n\nCUOMO: Okay. Rudy Giuliani, I appreciate your take, as always.\n\nGIULIANI: And you should be embarrassed \u2014\n\nCUOMO: All right, I'm the one who should be embarrassed?\n\nGIULIANI: \u2014 to be on that network.\n\nCUOMO: Okay, Rudy.\n\nGIULIANI: Absolutely.\n\nCUOMO: I'm \u2014 I'm embarrassed.\n\nGIULIANI: Man, the CNN is a disgrace.\n\nCUOMO: I'm embarrassed. I'm embarrassed, for you. Have a good night.\n\nGIULIANI: Well, you shouldn\u2019t be embarrassed for me. That\u2019s garbage.\n\nCUOMO: Have a good night.\n\nGIULIANI: Don't be embarrassed for me.\n\nCUOMO: Somebody needs to.\n\nGIULIANI: I'm worried about you.\n\nCUOMO: Because you're not aware of what you're doing.\n\nGIULIANI: And your integrity.\n\nCUOMO: Good night.\n\nGIULIANI: Of course, I'm aware of what I'm saying.\n\nCUOMO: Good night. Have a good night.\n\nGIULIANI: Well you \u2014 you shouldn\u2019t have a good night because what you\u2019re doing is very bad for the country.\n\nCUOMO: Rudy, all right, I got to go, all right? With respect \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: Yes, well go.\n\nCUOMO: \u2014 I\u2019ve got to go.", "description": "Analysis and fact-checking of the duel between Giuliani and Chris Cuomo.", "authors": ["Aaron Blake", "Senior Political Reporter", "Writing For The Fix", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/rqX3QqoRftN9k7HAAx89EfjF5UU=/1484x0/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/09-20-2019/t_48f227318dc44c7792807a546a6253e7_name_20190920_GIULIANI_CNN_V2.png", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
