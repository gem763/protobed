She smacks her head on one of its many fruitless branches and promptly starts wailing, piercing the idyllic scene around us. Behind, I hear the boldest little boy in Westchester County attempting to scold his mother for daring to take him apple-picking \u201cwhen there aren\u2019t any apples.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you love being sterile?\u201d my boyfriend says to me, and we both laugh.\n\nIn a perverse act of unadulterated straightness, upping the ante on the whole t4t heterosexual roleplay thing we\u2019ve got going on, the guy I\u2019m seeing borrowed a friend\u2019s car and took me apple-picking upstate last weekend. We\u2019d missed the season\u2019s peak and climate change is real, so most of the trees were as barren as the womb that neither of us possess. But we didn\u2019t go for the apples, really. We went for the experience\u2014because boys and girls do that. If going to Dia:Beacon is the blowjob of New York cuffing season, then apple-picking is like the blowjob with a spooning session after. It meant that we were doing this. It meant this might be real.\n\nAs we pulled into Wilkins Fruit & Fir Farm, passing at least a dozen dead ringers for the Christian girl autumn lady on our way to the parking lot, my boyfriend remarked that he'd been here before and proceeded to tell me an absolutely preposterous story.\n\nApparently, he\u2019d gone apple-picking at this very same orchard three years prior with the woman he was dating at the time\u2014a cis femme who also happened to be a lesbian. The date was actually a triple date with two other trans man/cis femme couples. He told me that the relationship didn\u2019t work for a number of reasons, but the clashing of their mutually invalidating identities\u2014her being a lesbian and him being a bisexual, transsexual man\u2014certainly didn\u2019t help. A pairing like this might seem incompatible, and it very often proves to be, but such couples were quite au courant in the late-aughts queer communities that helped gentrify Bushwick and Williamsburg, as the Rhys Ernst film Adam so accurately captures.\n\nAs the fag and dyke communities merged over the decade that followed and trans people realized we could just date each other, the trans man/lesbian dyad fell out of fashion. The idea of it now seems almost quaint, like plague doctor masks or Cold War duck-and-cover drills, but that wasn\u2019t what struck me as preposterous about my boyfriend\u2019s apple-picking story. No, what struck me as preposterous was that he had planned an apple-picking date with an all AFAB crew. If you\u2019re partaking in an activity that involves reaching up and grabbing things hanging from moderate to great heights, wouldn\u2019t you rather bring a trans girl along?\n\nI know this is reductive, even verging on stereotypical; lots of trans women are short, and plenty of cis women\u2014from Megan Thee Stallion and the tall girl from Tall Girl to Elizabeth Debicki and Peppa Pig\u2014are perfectly statuesque. But I\u2019m not plenty of cis women. I\u2019m just a tall girl, standing in front of a short boy, asking him not to feel emasculated when she helps him grab the apples all the children swarming around them can\u2019t reach.\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nFollow Harron Walker on Twitter .", "description": "If you\u2019re doing something that involves grabbing things hanging from moderate to great heights, wouldn\u2019t you rather bring a tall girl along?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5da7735ad9e63600090002a9/lede/1571255427454-GettyImages-629438655.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.3456xh;0xw,0xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
