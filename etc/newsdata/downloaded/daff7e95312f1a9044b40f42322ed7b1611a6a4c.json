As an amateur, Hill was not allowed to accept the first prize, with countryman Harry Ellis benefiting instead for coming second, two shots behind.\n\nHowever, what Hill earned could not be measured in monetary terms as he took the record off Ryo Ishikawa as the youngest champion at an event boasting Official World Ranking points. The Japanese golfer was almost two months older than Hill when prevailing on his home tour in 2007.\n\nDanny Willett, the 2016 Masters champion, and Sir Nick Faldo were just two of the sport\u2019s established figures to posted their congratulations on social media.\n\n\u201cI really don't know what to say right now.
