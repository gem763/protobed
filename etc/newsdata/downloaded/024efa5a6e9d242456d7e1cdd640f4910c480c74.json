Net employment change results from the relationship between hires and separations. When the number of hires exceeds the number of separations, employment rises, even if the hires level is steady or declining. Conversely, when the number of hires is less than the number of separations, employment declines, even if the hires level is steady or rising. Over the 12 months ending in August, hires totaled 69.5 million and separations totaled 67.1 million, yielding a net employment gain of 2.4 million. These totals include workers who may have been hired and separated more than once during the year. ____________ The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey estimates for September 2019 are scheduled to be released on Tuesday, November 5, 2019 at 10:00 a.m. (EST).", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.bls.gov/images/bls_emblem.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
