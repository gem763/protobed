What makes this deal worth your while is that it\u2019s for the 128GB model, which is rarely available at a discount. This configuration has stayed at $329.99 for a while, so this is a pretty sharp price drop. Amazon currently offers this discount, too, but it has gone in and out of stock since yesterday.\n\nSince this iPad was released in early 2018, Apple has released four other models (the 11-inch iPad Pro, the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, the iPad Air, and the iPad mini). Still, Dieter Bohn\u2019s review rings true: it remains one of the best tablets that you can get for under $500, and now it\u2019s cheaper than ever.\n\nThis is more of a PSA than an actual deal, but if you\u2019re interested in upgrading to the newer Nintendo Switch model, which has better battery life, GameStop is offering an acceptable amount of trade-in credit for its Pro subscribers.\n\nYou can get $200 back for your traded-in Switch, and through September 15th, GameStop will give you an extra $25 in credit, totaling to $225 toward the cost of the device.\n\nA few of our reader-exclusive offers from our Verge Deals event are still happening, and this is one of your last opportunities to save on these hand-picked deals.\n\nSony\u2019s WH1000X-M3 wireless noise-canceling headphones (black and silver) cost $298 at BuyDig, matching the lowest price we\u2019ve seen. If you enter the offer code THEVERGE at checkout, you\u2019ll also get a $25 Hulu gift card with your purchase.\n\nMophie is offering readers of The Verge a 20 percent site-wide discount that can be used on anything it sells, including the Dual Wireless Charging Pad shown above. To redeem this deal, enter the code VERGE20 at checkout.", "description": "Best Buy is offering the best price yet on the sixth-generation iPad. The 128GB tablet costs $299.99, which is $30 less than the lowest offer we\u2019ve seen.
