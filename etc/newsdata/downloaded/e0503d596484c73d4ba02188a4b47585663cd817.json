So small, in fact, that our employees could fit inside a two-car garage. We knew back then (and still do) how hard it is to find customers and earn their trust, to hire and retain good people, and to balance quality with growth.\n\nEvery day millions of small businesses are creating and building amazing things -- and experiencing the same growing pains as we did. I believe larger companies like Google should play a role in helping them. Some people assume that big companies can only succeed at the expense of small ones. Our experience is precisely the opposite. For us, the last two decades have shown that big businesses and small businesses can grow together, especially in the digital economy.\n\nA mail-order business in Maine selling lobsters was the first to sign up when Google launched its online ads platform, and today a significant amount of Google\u2019s revenue comes from small businesses. We take a lot of pride in this, because we know how important small businesses are to our communities. They are the bakeries that help feed our families, the shoe stores that support the high school track team, and the independent bookstores that know just what to recommend.\n\nGOOGLE RELEASES 3,000 DEEPFAKE VIDEOS SO RESEARCHERS CAN COMBAT THEM\n\nThey\u2019re also the beating heart of the American economy. Today, small businesses employ just under half of all private sector employees and account for nearly two-thirds of new job growth.\n\nThe internet has created new opportunities for small businesses to succeed, but it\u2019s also introduced a level of complexity that most business owners don\u2019t have time to navigate. At Google, we see it as our job to help small businesses leverage the power of technology, whether it\u2019s finding new customers, teaching employees new skills, or working more efficiently. Google\u2019s free tools, along with platforms like Cloud, Search, Maps, Ads, and YouTube, give small businesses the same advantages as bigger firms when it comes to distribution and global reach.\n\nAt Google, we see it as our job to help small businesses leverage the power of technology, whether it\u2019s finding new customers, teaching employees new skills, or working more efficiently.\n\nOne of the biggest opportunities is to help small businesses create connections with customers in their local neighborhoods and beyond. While the internet has given people the ability to buy anything from anywhere, often they are searching for what\u2019s right next to them: the closest pediatrician, the best pizza delivery in Omaha, a hair salon open today. Search interest for shops \u201cnear me\u201d has increased consistently since 2004, hitting a record high in 2019.\n\nAt its core, connecting local businesses with customers is an information problem. So when someone asks Google to find the best BBQ restaurant or dry cleaner \u201cnear me,\u201d we try to get as much relevant information in their hands as possible. That includes information like driving directions, hours, or popular times to help plan a visit, along with easy ways to make a purchase or reservation on the spot. Each month, this access to information is part of what helps Google drive over one billion connections for businesses nationwide.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nFor many businesses, there\u2019s a big opportunity for growth in connecting to customers around the world. Businesses that export goods are more competitive, more profitable, and more resilient to economic downturns. Now, with the help of tools like Google\u2019s Market Finder, any business can reach a global market. This presents a huge opportunity as one-third of the clicks on Google ads posted by U.S. businesses, and over 60 percent of watch time on YouTube content produced by US creators\u2014including businesses\u2014come from abroad.\n\nFinally, we see an opportunity to help small business owners and entrepreneurs build their skills and the skills of their employees. Small business owners often tell me there\u2019s just not enough time to become digital marketing experts and run their business.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nMeanwhile, there\u2019s a lot of people who want to own a small business of their own, but don\u2019t know where to begin. That\u2019s why, two years ago, we created Grow with Google and committed $1 billion to expand economic opportunity. Since then we\u2019ve helped train three million Americans in digital skills, including small business owners and entrepreneurs. And today, Google.org is making a $10 million pledge to help entrepreneurs from underserved communities start new businesses. The first grant will be a $2 million contribution to the American Library Association to support entrepreneurship centers at libraries in ten states.\n\nSmall businesses have historically been the backbone of the American economy, and they will be just as critical to its future prosperity. Companies like Google, who have benefitted from the long tradition of American innovation, have a stake in making sure small businesses have the same shot at success as we did.", "description": "At Google, we see it as our job to help small businesses leverage the power of technology,\u00a0 whether it\u2019s finding new customers, teaching employees new skills, or working more efficiently.", "authors": ["Sundar Pichai", "Sundar Pichai Is The Ceo Of Google."], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/03/05/694940094001_6010372502001_6010371309001-vs.jpg"}
