REUTERS/Issei Kato\n\nU.S. crude futures were last up 11% at $61.10 a barrel, coming off highs on expectations other global oil suppliers would step in to lift output. Brent crude soared 13% at $68.06 after earlier rising to $71.95.\n\nYemen\u2019s Iran-backed Houthi rebel group had claimed responsibility for the attack, which hit the world\u2019s biggest oil-processing facility but a senior U.S. official told reporters on Sunday that evidence indicated Tehran was behind it.\n\nThe attacks heightened investor worries about the geopolitical situation in the region and worsening relations between Iran and the United States.\n\nThose fears powered safe-haven assets, with prices for gold climbing 1% in early Asian trade to $1,503.09.\n\nMoves in Asian share markets were small, however, with Japan shut for a public holiday.\n\nMSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was a tick lower at 515.4. Australian shares were down 0.1% while South Korea\u2019s KOSPI was a tad higher.\n\nAsian stock markets: here\n\nE-Minis for the S&P 500 were off 0.4% while those for the Dow eased 0.3%.\n\n\u201cIf risk appetite collapses due to fears of worsening middle east tensions in the wake of any retaliation to the drone attacks, some emerging markets could face a double whammy of pressures,\u201d said Mitul Kotecha, Singapore-based senior emerging markets strategist at TD Securities.\n\n\u201cIn Asia, the most risk sensitive currencies are Indian rupee, Indonesian rupiah and Philippine peso.\u201d\n\nBONDS AND CURRENCIES\n\nAmong major currencies, the Saudi news pushed the yen up 0.4% to 107.64 per dollar while the Canadian dollar rose 0.5% in anticipation of higher oil prices.\n\nThe euro was little moved near a three-week top while the pound hovered near Friday\u2019s two-month highs. That left the greenback down 0.15% at 98.105 against a basket of six major currencies.\n\nThe risk-sensitive Australian dollar was down 0.5% against the yen, snapping nine straight days of gains. The kiwi dollar slipped to a one-week low on the yen.\n\n\u201cOne immediate question this (attack) poses for bond markets is whether a further rise in the inflation expectations component of bond yields - which have proved historically sensitive to oil prices - will give this month\u2019s sharp bond market sell-off fresh impetus,\u201d said NAB analyst Ray Attrill.\n\n\u201cOr will safe haven considerations dominate to drive yields lower? Watch this space.\u201d\n\nIn early Asian trading, futures for U.S. 10-year Treasury notes rose 0.3%, indicating yields may slip when cash trading begins.\n\nGlobal bonds were sold off last week, sending yields higher, led by a broader risk rally on hopes the United States and China would soon end their long trade war. Better-than-expected U.S. retail sales data also boosted sentiment.\n\nChinese data for industrial production, retail sales and fixed asset investment will be released later on Monday, which could help set the tone for this week.\n\nInvestors also await the outcome of the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s policy meeting on Wednesday at which it is widely expected to ease interest rates and signal its future policy path.\n\n(This story was refiled to correct to add analyst\u2019s full name in paragraph 14)", "description": "Oil prices surged to six-month highs on Monday while Wall Street futures fell and safe-haven bets returned after weekend attacks on Saudi Arabia's crude facilities knocked out more than 5% of global oil supply.", "authors": ["Swati Pandey", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190915&t=2&i=1430256600&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8E0SG", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
