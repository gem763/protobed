The bank struck a more downbeat note for the remainder of the year, saying the U.S.-China trade dispute will lead to more cautious capital expenditure and investment decisions.\n\nThiam is seeking to move beyond one of the bank\u2019s biggest scandals of recent years after the botched surveillance of a former executive sparked an internal investigation and probes by Swiss prosecutors. Chief Operating Officer Pierre-Olivier Bouee, the CEO\u2019s chief lieutenant at three companies, stepped down this month after ordering detectives to shadow former wealth-management head Iqbal Khan to ensure he didn\u2019t poach clients and brokers for his new team at UBS Group AG.\n\n\u201cShareholders have been very much backing the company and it\u2019s leadership,\u201d Thiam said in an interview with Francine Lacqua on Bloomberg TV. \u201cThe action taken was inappropriate, no question about that, and disproportionate,\u201d he said of the spying operation, his first public comments since the scandal broke. Thiam said he did not order the action and it hasn\u2019t had a discernible impact on the business.\n\nChairman Urs Rohner said that Thiam retains his personal backing and that of the board after the spying affair. The matter had escalated after a personal dispute between Thiam and Khan, with media reports saying the two men had fallen out over Khan\u2019s ambition and personal insults at a party earlier this year.\n\nCredit Suisse shares rose slightly in early Zurich trading.\n\nGlobal Markets\n\nThe global markets trading unit, a source of surprise losses in recent years, saw revenue soar and pretax profit rise to 269 million francs ($270 million), almost double what analysts were expecting. The gains were driven by a 63% increase in fixed income trading, while equity trading rose three percent, beating the average gain at U.S. peers.\n\nInflows at wealth management of 5.6 billion billion francs missed analyst estimates for almost 7 billion francs, though pre-tax profit of 539 million francs at the international wealth management unit was better than expected. Philipp Wehle, who replaced Khan as head of that business, plans to boost number of private bankers that serve its richest clients.\n\nAs part of the emphasis on private banking, Credit Suisse is considering a return to U.S. wealth management after a four-year absence, people familiar with the matter said earlier this month. Talks have focused on adding $15 billion of assets under management at a new base in Miami, mostly catering to wealthy Latin Americans, the people said.\n\nWhile Thiam has held off on job cuts like those announced by Deutsche Bank AG and Societe Generale SA, an industry-wide slump in trading and initial public offerings and the prospect of low interest rates for longer may test his resilience. The bank plans to impose charges on more wealthy clients to spread the pain of negative interest rates and expects to start charging for Swiss franc deposits after imposing a 0.4% fee on euro accounts of more than 1 million euros ($1.1 million), according to a person with knowledge of the matter.\n\nFace Time\n\nThiam has also been devoting more face time to top private bankers in recent months and holding talks on boosting pay as he seeks to prevent defections after Khan\u2019s exit, according to people familiar with the matter. The CEO has been reaching out to the best revenue generators at the international wealth business to discuss compensation and career prospects, paying particular attention to emerging markets such as Brazil, the Middle East and emerging Europe, the people said.\n\nThe earnings add to momentum last quarter after the bank had brushed off the gloom in European banking as wealthy clients added new money and revenue from securities trading rose in a quarter in which peers posted declines. Thiam emerged from a painful three-year turnaround six months ago.\n\n(Adds comment from Tidjane Thiam in fourth paragraph.)\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Patrick Winters in Zurich at pwinters3@bloomberg.net;Marion Halftermeyer in Zurich at mhalftermeye@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Dale Crofts at dcrofts@bloomberg.net, Ross Larsen\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Credit Suisse Group AG\u2019s third-quarter results were boosted by gains at the key trading unit, bringing relief to Chief Executive Officer Tidjane Thiam as he seeks to emerge from a spying scandal that dented the bank\u2019s reputation and cost him a key lieutenant.The Zurich-based bank posted", "authors": ["Patrick Winters", "Marion Halftermeyer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/k6zcuvJFqgYm7IajVjyC3A--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/2a0df648422c8013750043813b6e3cb7", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
