And then it exploded\u2019 | Andy Bull", "language": "en", "text": "Jonny Wilkinson, England\u2019s World Cup winning fly-half, speaks about his battle with mental illness and why no amount of trophies can ease the pain of depression\n\nIt is October 1999, and a 20-year-old Jonny Wilkinson is sitting on the edge of a bed in Clive Woodward\u2019s hotel room in Paris. Woodward has just told Wilkinson that he is dropping him to the bench for England\u2019s World Cup quarter-final against South Africa at the Stade de France that weekend. Woodward has chosen instead to play Paul Grayson, who is eight years older and has a dozen more caps. \u201cI remember it so well,\u201d Wilkinson says now. \u201cI looked at Clive and I said: \u2018Mate, I think it is a great idea, I think he is a brilliant player and the team will go brilliantly with him. I\u2019m young. My time will come.\u2019\u201d\n\nWilkinson wonders what happened to that 20-year-old, and what he would have thought of the player he grew into. \u201cI look back now, and I can\u2019t believe the maturity I had then, how free I was, compared to the player I became, so wrapped up in my own self-importance and reputation.\u201d\n\nStop the suffering and ditch the lip service to mental health in sport | Robert Kitson Read more\n\nIt is October 2011, and a 32-year\u2011old Jonny Wilkinson is playing in his fourth World Cup, under Martin Johnson in New Zealand. \u201cI was a shell of the player I\u2019d been when I was 20 years old. I\u2019d had 12 years to work and grow and build and in all that time all I\u2019d managed to do was take the bright shining light of my potential and turn it into this dim, weak, being.\u201d\n\nWilkinson has always suffered with anxiety, \u201cbut when I was younger it was 50-50, half of me was loving the game, half was worrying about what would happen if it went wrong. And as I got older that ratio became 70-30, then 85-15, and it left so little space for joy.\u201d\n\nThere are lessons here. Wilkinson was the prototypical superstar of professional rugby in this country, and his experiences foreshadow the mental health crisis the game is only just beginning to address.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jonny Wilkinson says of England\u2019s World Cup triumph: \u2018There are some guys that played in the final and won it who are utterly miserable.\u2019 Photograph: Tom Shaw - World Rugby/World Rugby via Getty Images\n\n\u201cI spent my career surviving the pressure I put on myself,\u201d Wilkinson says. \u201cWhen you get to the end you look back and you say \u2018what did I do with my career?\u2019 I survived it. Well if you had told that to me when I was 20 I would have smacked myself.\u201d\n\nBut Wilkinson won a World Cup, four Six Nations and the Heineken Cup, twice. He scored more points in Tests than any other Englishman. \u201cLook,\u201d he explains, \u201cthere\u2019s guys who made the World Cup squad and never got picked who are as happy as anything, and there are some guys that played in the final and won it who are utterly miserable.\u201d\n\nWilkinson knows. He was one of them himself. \u201cI lived a huge amount of my career thinking I was going to achieve joy through suffering,\u201d he says, \u201cbut all I did was create a habit of suffering. I lived for those beautiful moments of being in the zone during the games, and I told myself they were the result of the ridiculous suffering I went through and the sacrifices I made. So I told myself I had to suffer more, because that was the way I was going to get back into the zone.\u201d\n\nOld instincts of World Rugby are preventing a true global union Read more\n\nIn 2003 \u201cmy anxiety was at a peak, and then it paid off, we won the World Cup, so I was like: \u2018Bring on the joy!\u2019\u201d It never came.\n\nSo Wilkinson just kept punishing himself. \u201cI\u2019d allowed that World Cup to become a defining moment, it gave me the proof I needed that I was doing everything right, so it reinforced this idea that I needed to destroy myself physically and mentally. It took a few years for the pressure to really build. And then it exploded.\u201d\n\nWilkinson does not enjoy revisiting those memories, like the time he found himself sinking to the bottom of a swimming pool and screaming to himself underwater, or the moments he spent shivering in a toilet cubicle in the minutes before kick-off, scared stiff and desperate for someone to talk to.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Wasps forward Kearnan Myall has spoken about his mental health problems and the pressures of being a professional rugby player. Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images\n\nHe has heard about how Kearnan Myall opened up about his own mental health problems in a recent interview with the Guardian. He knows there are a lot of players out there going through the same things he suffered with himself. Anxiety, depression, angst. \u201cThe guys I was playing with when I started came from the amateur era, and they definitely had a better sense of balance because they had the grounding of working in an office one day and playing rugby the next,\u201d he says. \u201cThey knew that the same guys they were working with in that office might be there in the crowd watching them play, so they understood that it was supposed to be for fun and entertainment.\u201d\n\nWilkinson thinks the sport needs to find a way to recapture some of that spirit. The stigma of discussing mental health is being broken down, \u201cbut we have to get beyond that beautiful beginning where we\u2019re all talking about it, and sharing our experiences, we have to get to a point where we\u2019re asking: \u2018What next?\u2019 It can\u2019t all be about \u2018dealing\u2019 and \u2018coping\u2019 and \u2018managing\u2019 with mental health. Because that path ends with you crawling out the other side of your career, thinking about how life gets so much harder as you get older.\u201d\n\nHe feels as if he spent years trying to fight his depression with \u201canother Six Nations Championship, or some more caps, or titles, or points. \u2018Surely,\u2019 I told myself, \u2018that will keep you off my back?\u2019 It doesn\u2019t.
