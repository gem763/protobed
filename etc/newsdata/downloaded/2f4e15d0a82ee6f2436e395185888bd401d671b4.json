So he said, \u2018I got delivered.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cOne time, he told me that he wasn\u2019t going to rap,\u201d Tyson said. \u201cI said, \u2018Why not?\u2019 He said, \u2018That\u2019s the devil\u2019s music.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Hey, man. Rap is a genre. You can rap for God,\u2019\u201d Tyson continued.\n\n\u201cI think he was already thinking about it a little bit, but I definitely said, \u2018Hey, bro. I think you need to use your talents that God\u2019s given you and use that platform for God,\u2019\u201d Tyson said.\n\nSince then, Kanye has transitioned his music career to only doing Christian rap, starting a gospel-themed \u201cSunday Service\u201d music tour, drawing thousands and which most recently made a stop in Jamaica.\n\nKanye\u2019s new Christian hip-hop album Jesus Is King is due for release on October 25 along with an accompanying IMAX film.\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "Kanye West planned to give up rap music after converting to Christianity earlier this year, according to his pastor, who says West told him that the genre is \u201cthe devil\u2019s music.\u201d", "authors": ["Thomas D.
