Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudolph Giuliani already had been in touch with Zelenky\u2019s people.\n\nThe memo of the conversation released Wednesday by the White House, makes it apparent Zelensky was doing all he could to humor the president of the United States. The former star of a TV comedy show in which he played a common man who became an uncommon president, which he then proceeded to become in real life, Zelensky said he\u2019d learned a lot from Trump\u2019s political techniques. He tried out a couple of ironic jokes. And paraphrasing Trump\u2019s campaign pledge he volunteered, \u201cWe wanted to drain the swamp here in our country.\u201d\n\nThat wasn\u2019t enough to get a clear commitment from Trump to supply the kinds of arms Ukraine needs to fight Russian backed insurgents and covert Russian military units. Trump\u2019s idea of the swamp in Ukraine was very different from the way Zelensky sees it. Indeed, Trump\u2019s only interest was in digging dirt he believed might be found about his future opponent Joe Biden and Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, or even about his past opponent Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails.\n\nZelensky said he was ready to buy more Javelin anti-tank missiles for Ukraine\u2019s defense. Trump immediately pivoted: \u201cI would like you to do us a favor.\u201d Speaking distractedly, as if someone was pushing notes under his nose, Trump said, \u201c I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike... I guess you have one of your wealthy people... The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation.\u201d\n\nAs The Daily Beast reported, \u201cTrump is referencing a conspiracy theory pushed by Russian trolls and far-right pundits that imagines the Democratic National Committee fabricating all the evidence in Russia\u2019s 2016 breach of the DNC network.\u201d No doubt Zelensky was confused.\n\nDaria Kaleniuk, one of Ukraine\u2019s most respected independent corruption fighters, says she was \u201cdeeply upset\u201d when she saw the partial transcript. She studied financial law in the United States and has looked up to the country as a paradigm of democratic rule. She said she had not thought the situation there was so degraded.\n\nA spokesperson for Attorney General William Barr\u2019s Department of Justice said Wednesday that in fact Barr never followed up. But Trump also plugged for his personal lawyer, former New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who appears to be acting as a consigliere at the center of the effort to shift attention to Ukraine and the Democrats, and away from Russia\u2019s well-established efforts to help Trump get elected in 2016. Zelensky said he\u2019d welcome Giuliani in Ukraine, and Giuliani has said publicly many times in recent days that his aim was to uncover incriminating information about the Bidens.\n\n\u201cThis scandal is harmful for Ukraine,\u201d said Kaleniuk. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, we are at war with Russia,\u201d she said, suggesting that Russian President Vladimir Putin must be enjoying the current storm of news over Ukraine.\n\nAmong the many cases Kaleniuk has watched over the last five years is that of Burisma, a natural gas company that named then-Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden, well known as something of a black sheep, to its board in 2014.\n\nBut the transcript made it clear to Kyiv\u2019s anti-corruption experts that Trump really had very little idea what he was talking about.\n\nZelensky tried in general terms to assure Trump the new administration in Kyiv would be serious about fighting corruption. \u201cGood,\u201d said Trump, \u201cbecause I heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down and that's really unfair. A lot of people are talking about that, the way they shut your very good prosecutor down and you had some very bad people involved. \u2026 There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that \u2026\u201d\n\nProsecutors in Ukraine have been infamous for using the state\u2019s power to investigate crimes, then demanding a payoff from the target, and closing the case.\n\nKaleniuk notes that three Ukraine prosecutor generals\u2014Vitaly Yerema, Viktor Shokin and Yuriy Lutsenko\u2014\u201chave dumped the Burisma case, each in his turn, one after another. I don\u2019t think Mr. Trump knows the name of the \u2018very good\u2019 prosecutor he was talking about.\u201d\n\nWhen Kyiv\u2019s corruption fighters see that the Burisma case and what Trump called Ukraine\u2019s \u201chorrible\u201d law enforcement system have become an obsession of the president of the United States, they feel lost, said Kaleniuk: \u201cThis is like a movie, I would never predict anything like it!\u201d\n\nOne of Ukraine\u2019s recent prosecutor generals, Yuriy Lutsenko, closed the Burisma investigation himself \u201cwhen there was still a chance to define the truth\u201d and then gave an interview to the Washington website The Hill complaining it was the U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, who gave him a \u201cdo not prosecute\u201d list.\n\nThat is the exact opposite of what happened in the case, which Kaleniuk has followed closely.\n\nShe is convinced that Trump and his helpers had been preparing the Biden \u201cscandal\u201d for a long time. \u201cThey started plotting it in October last year, possibly even earlier,\u201d she said. One of the messages Lutsenko conveyed, Kaleniuk told The Daily Beast, was that President Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudolph Giuliani had consulted with Yuriy Lutsenko, Ukraine\u2019s then-Prosecutor General, for months.\n\n\u201cTrump and Giuliani needed him to convey a message that Ukraine had intervened in American elections,\u201d she said. \u201cLutsenko and prosecutor Konstantin Kulik have been giving Giuliani information on this case purely with an agenda to save their careers, inventing the story about the Biden investigation.\u201d\n\nIn 2016 Vice President Joe Biden demanded that Ukraine fire Prosecutor General Victor Shokin, who Trump might have meant as \u201cvery good prosecutor,\u201d but he was seen by reformers in Kiev as a disaster. A year earlier Kalemniuk\u2019s watchdog organization had pushed to dismiss Shokin for neglecting multiple corruption cases.\n\n\u201cHere is why I do not say anything about Hunter Biden,\u201d Kaleniuk explained. \u201cVice President Biden called for Ukraine to fire Shokin not because of the Burisma investigation, absolutely not, but because Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general did not investigate Burisma. U.S. Ambassador Geoffrey Pyatt insisted [in early 2016] that Shokin should be investigating Burisma. The U.S. government had a clear position: the Burisma probe was killed by Shokin.\u201d And the U.S. thought it and other cases should not have been closed.\n\nUnder the circumstances, and hopeful that Zelensky is as serious about reforms as he has said, Kaleniuk said she understood his reaction to Trump: \u201cThe leader of the most powerful state, our biggest partner, called with a request, so Zelensky tried not to contradict any of Trump\u2019s words, agreed with everything.\u201d\n\nMany in Ukraine were upset by revelations of Zelensky\u2019s \u201cpainful\u201d answers to Trump, especially when Zelensky said: \u201cThe next prosecutor will be 100 percent my person, my candidate, who will be approved by parliament and will start as a new prosecutor in September.\u201d Prosecutors are supposed to be independent.\n\nJournalists at the Hramadske television network were arguing emotionally in the newsroom Wednesday night.\n\nAndrey Saychuk, one Hramadske correspondent, told The Daily Beast he wondered how the newly appointed prosecutor, Ruslan Ryaboshapka must feel about the way Zelensky talked about the question of his independence.\n\nDuring the Trump-Zelensky press opportunity at the United Nations in New York on Wednesday, Zelensky said he was not \u201cpushed\u201d by Trump in the July phone call, but the pressure on him was obvious. \u201cI am sorry, but I don\u2019t want to be involved in the elections in USA,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe should keep our distance from this highly political Burisma case used in the political massacre in United States, any move on it can be used for political purposes,\u201d Kaleniuk said. \u201cLet American citizens and institutions judge whether their president was pushing Zelensky or not.\u201d\n\nAs for Hunter Biden, his affiliation with Burisma seems at a minimum to have been ill considered. The oligarch behind the company, Mykola Zlochevsky, was the minister of ecology and natural resources from July 2010 until April 2012 under the hugely corrupt pro-Putin President Viktor Yanukovych, overthrown by the Maidan revolution in 2014. (One of his close advisors was Trump campaign chairman and international political operative Paul Manafort, now serving a seven and a half year prison term in the United States.)\n\n\u201cZlochevsky used his authority to give his own company licenses\u2014 basically the minister gave himself a permit for producing natural resources, and the licenses are at Burisma Holding,\u201d said Kaleniuk.\n\nWhen Hunter Biden started working with the company in May of 2014, it had just had its assets frozen in the United Kingdom, where it was investigated for money laundering.\n\n\u201cI realize that it is very strange that Hunter Biden was working for Burisma,\u201d says Kaleniuk. \u201cI might be the first one to say bad things about Joe Biden\u2019s movements in regard to this case, but I don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nWhy? Because far from trying to protect his son from the broader investigation that might establish Hunter received money gained illegally by Burisma\u2019s founder, \u201cJoe Biden wanted to prove it,\u201d that Burisma was crooked. \u201cHe tried to make Shokin investigate that,\u201d Kaleniuk said.\n\n\u201cOne thing should be clear for everybody today: Joe Biden wanted to fire the prosecutor who did not want to investigate Burisma, where his son was working. That is very important.\u201d Kaleniuk added that \u201ceverybody wanted Shokin fired.\u201d\n\nIn May 2014, when Kaleniuk\u2019s watchdog group of progressive lawyers discovered Hunter Biden on the board of Burisma Holding, they also found he was in interesting company. Poland\u2019s former President Aleksander Kwasniewsky was on that board, along with \u201ca few retired CIA agents,\u201d Kaleniuk said. So many names. But, still, \u201cIt was strange for us to discover that Biden\u2019s son appeared to be working at Burisma, most probably as a fa\u00e7ade to defend Zlochevsky\u2019s reputation .\u201d\n\nAt a meeting with then-Vice President Joe Biden in the spring of 2014, Ukrainian corruption fighters told him about their many issues. \u201cWe did not talk about Zlochevsky\u2019s corruption specifically, he was just one of the bastards who had robbed our country,\u201d said Kaleniuk. \u201cIt is unclear if the father Biden knew about [the investigation of] Burisma,\u201d she said.\n\nAt that time all foreign partners who tried to help Ukraine investigate corruption knew that both Shokin and his predecessor Vitaly Yarema had dumped the Burisma case. \u201cThe British embassy, the American embassy knew exactly what was going on. I think that Zlochevsky had to pay a lot for closing the case against him,\u201d Kaleniuk said.\n\nBut, here\u2019s the thing about the vast breadth and depth of corruption in Ukraine\u2014President Zelensky himself is hardly immune. His great patron has been the oligarch who owned the television station where he became a star.\n\n\u201cIf somebody asked us about the priority for the investigation today, I would say billionaire Ihor Kolomoisky, and not Biden, should be the priority,\u201d said Kilaniuk. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigations has looked into Kolomoisky\u2019s investments in the United States. Formerly exiled in Israel, Kolomoisky now feels perfectly comfortable in Zelensky\u2019s Ukraine.\n\nKilaniuk insisted that none of Trump\u2019s agents, including Rudolph Giuliani really understood how Ukraine functions. \u201cI don\u2019t think that Giuliani was the one who plotted the scandal, I think he just was just promoting this story; obviously, Donald Trump has no idea how things really work in Ukraine. I believe that Zelensky understands what has happened, I hope the President can distance himself from billionaire Ihor Kolomoisky.\u201d\n\nThe risk is always that before the swamp can be drained, Zelensky will drown in it.\n\nChristopher Dickey also contributed to this story.", "description": "The \u201cswamp\u201d in Ukraine is very wide and very deep.
