Liverpool have won all of their first eight league matches so far.\n\nManchester United (A) - October 20\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer's side are a mess. Liverpool struggled in the big away games against the big six sides last season, but United are in such disarray that surely the Reds cannot drop any points here.\n\nKlopp's side only won one away game against the big six last season - away at Tottenham, which incidentally was at Wembley so it wasn't even Spurs' home.\n\nLiverpool selected a workmanlike midfield in top clashes, which opposition managers caught on to and opted to sit back with everyone behind the ball - knowing the Reds would struggle to break them down.\n\nThis was evident in the last meeting between these sides at Old Trafford which ended 0-0.\n\nMohamed Salah celebrates his side's second against Spurs which was an own goal\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer will likely have everyone behind the ball against Liverpool at Old Trafford\n\nUnited were flying at the time - they had won eight of their last nine league games during Solskjaer's honeymoon period.\n\nIt is a vastly different picture now. They sit 12th and the United manager is struggling to keep hold of his job.\n\nIt's still a difficult match to call. Solskjaer will likely have everyone behind the ball and will see if Liverpool can break them down and Klopp is unlikely to go with a creative midfield to counteract that.\n\nLiverpool's main hope will be Mohamed Salah being fit. If he's not, Divock Origi will likely play on the wing. On his last start, the Reds struggled to break down Newcastle at home before Origi came off injured midway through the first half.\n\nOne key variable in this fixture will be whether Liverpool's talisman Mohamed Salah will be fit\n\nSalah celebrates scoring a stunning breakaway goal against Southampton at St Mary's\n\nVan Dijk jumps in the air after scoring against Newcastle at St James' Park last season\n\nJoel Matip is expected to be fit in a huge boost for Klopp - replacement Dejan Lovren has a history of high-profile mistakes and nearly gave away a penalty just before half-time against Leicester before the international break.\n\nEven so, United are struggling for goals, and Alisson is likely to be back for Liverpool after returning to full training this week.\n\nPrediction: Manchester United 0-1 Liverpool\n\nTottenham (H) - October 27\n\nThis one should be easier for Liverpool and would mean they would break the record with 19 wins in a row.\n\nAlthough Spurs have caused the Reds problems at Anfield in recent years, like United, they are in turmoil.\n\nThey shipped 10 goals in four days as they were thrashed by Bayern Munich at home and conceded three at Brighton.\n\nLiverpool, by contrast, haven't lost at home for two-and-a-half years.\n\nSpurs' away form against the 'big six' sides is dreadful and Mauricio Pochettino is struggling\n\nSalah cups his ears to the fans after scoring a sensational long-range effort against Chelsea\n\nSpurs' away form against the big six sides is also dreadful. They only beat Manchester United away from home last season against their fellow big six opponents.\n\nThey did draw at the Etihad this season, but they haven't won away in the league since beating relegated Fulham in January.\n\nThe Reds should coast this and break City's record.\n\nPrediction: Liverpool 3-0 Tottenham\n\nAston Villa (A) - November 2\n\nAlthough this might appear a straightforward fixture, with Villa languishing down in 15th position in the table, Klopp should be wary.\n\nDean Smith's side carry a goal threat - they have hit the back of the net 12 times in their last four games in all competitions, including five at Norwich last time out.\n\nThey also appear to be finding their fete in the top flight after a slightly shaky start. Tyrone Mings, a newly-minted England international, is a towering presence at the back.\n\nThat said, it's difficult to see an expansive Villa side keeping out Liverpool's dynamite front three, so we make that 20 wins in a row.\n\nPrediction: Aston Villa 2-4 Liverpool\n\nDean Smith's side have struck the back of the net 12 times in their last four games\n\nMilner and Henderson celebrate scoring Liverpool's second against Cardiff last campaign\n\nSadio Mane points to the sky after scoring against Wolves in the last league game of 2018-19\n\nManchester City (H) - November 10\n\nThe title decider in November? It could be if Liverpool extend their lead at the top to 11 points by winning this game.\n\nIf City had Aymeric Laporte they would likely be favourites to win this considering the two sides drew 0-0 at Anfield last season and City only failed to win because Riyad Mahrez ballooned a last-minute penalty over the bar.\n\nGuardiola has to drop Nicolas Otamendi for John Stones if they are to get something from this game and he will probably will do so after the number of errors the Argentine has made.\n\nThe Reds would have to install some creativity into their midfield to win this and Klopp always plays Georginio Wijnaldum and Jordan Henderson in these games, so this is why City are likely to end Liverpool's winning run and be the first team to win at Anfield since April 2017.\n\nNot only that, it would revive the title race.\n\nPrediction: Liverpool 0-2 Manchester City\n\nPep Guardiola has to drop Nicolas Otamendi for John Stones if they are to get something\n\nJurgen Klopp hugs Mane after his side beat Chelsea at Stamford Bridge 2-1 in September\n\nJames Milner runs away having scored a 95th-minute penalty against Leicester on Saturday\n\nGeorginio Wijnaldum celebrates after seeing his shot deflect into the net against Sheffield\n\nKlopp pats Mane on the back as the Liverpool forward helped beat Newcastle United 3-1\n\nJordan Henderson and Trent Alexander-Arnold celebrate after beating Burnley 3-0 in August\n\nSalah scores from the penalty spot against Arsenal as the Reds beat the Gunners 3-1\n\nFirmino wheels away in celebration after scoring at St Mary's in a 2-1 win over Southampton", "description": "Liverpool have won 17 league matches in a row.
