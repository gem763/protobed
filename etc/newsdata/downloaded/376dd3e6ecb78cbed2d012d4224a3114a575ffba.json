So they cut water off to our salon and the two restaurants either side of us. We had clients with curlers on and we actually had to go out and buy water to finish the treatment, to rinse their colours off. It was a disaster.\u201d\n\nPrice said Foundry Street was \u201ca very busy road\u201d and the pole was a hazard.\n\n\u201cI think if you turned a little bit too sharp you would hit the pole. A lot of people cut that corner a little bit too, so it\u2019s super dangerous.\n\n\u201cThose roadworks have really impacted our businesses, there is next to no parking now \u2026 We\u2019re getting a lot of complaints. It\u2019s just dragged on a lot.\u201d\n\nPrevious photos of the street, captured by Google Maps in May 2018, show the pole in its original position on the kerb.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The old location of the power pole on Foundry Street, as captured by Google Maps in May 2018. Photograph: Google Maps\n\nOn Monday morning, Bath told ABC Radio they had decided to do \u201cstage work\u201d while Ausgrid had its work pause.\n\n\u201cAbout six months ago there was a fatality on an Ausgrid site,\u201d Bath said. \u201cThey are prevented from undertaking any work on what we call live work.\n\n\u201cSo our choices are we either do no work, or we have to stage work, such as what you\u2019ve seen in Foundry Street.\u201d\n\nBath said he had asked Ausgrid to temporarily lift its ban on live work to move the pole.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t own the power poles,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly frustrating for us, but the alternative is I just have guys sitting around doing no work.\u201d\n\nAn Ausgrid spokesman said these comments were \u201cdisappointing\u201d because the council \u201cknew full well the pole would be left in the roadway as a result\u201d.\n\nThe electricity distributor said it was working to schedule a time to move the offending pole.\n\n\u201cThis pole has not moved,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cBut as a result of works by Newcastle Council to move the kerb, this pole has now been left in the road, clearly in an unsafe location.\n\n\u201cIt is disappointing to read comments by council CEO Jeremy Bath who stated council proceed with this work to move the kerb knowing full well that the pole would be left in the roadway as a result.\n\n\u201cAs the council is aware, Ausgrid introduced a pause on live work on our network after one of our workers tragically lost his life while completing live work in April. This was the first fatality of a worker on our network in more than 20 years and prompted a comprehensive safety review.\u201d\n\nThe spokesman said other councils had \u201crespected\u201d Ausgrid\u2019s decision to pause work, but Newcastle council had not.\n\n\u201cAusgrid acknowledges that the pause on live work has caused some disruptions, but we do not step back from our commitment to ensure workers can go home to their loved ones safely at the end of the day.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the City of Newcastle said they expected Ausgrid to move the pole \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d.", "description": "Ausgrid hits out at council for widening Foundry Street and moving the kerb during the electricity distributor\u2019s live work ban", "authors": ["Naaman Zhou"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/727c972e5159f71bec17c374f9d81c3616fcf3f8/0_1_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0004fd6e5c0b20374325b036944de752", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
