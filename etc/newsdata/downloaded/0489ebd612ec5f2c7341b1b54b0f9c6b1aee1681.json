These are microplastics, made from polyester. They are not biodegradable and can build up in our environment.\u201d\n\nThe finding challenges the assumption that more aggressive washing cycles, which use less water, change direction more frequently and spin at higher speeds, release more fibres into wastewater. Instead, the volume of water used per wash appears to be the most important factor in dislodging fibres from clothing, the study found.\n\n\u201cIf the water volume is high, the water will bash the clothes around more than if less water is used,\u201d Burgess said. \u201cThe water forces its way through the clothing and plucks fibres of polyester from the textiles.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The clothing was tested using a bank of washing machines at Newcastle University.

Previous tests have found that washing synthetic items can release between 500,000 and 6m microfibres per wash.\n\nBecause many washing machines lack filters that can remove microplastics from their wastewater, the fibres are carried into water treatment plants and can eventually reach the seas. The particles, which come from a variety of sources, are now ubiquitous in the environment, from the deepest marine trench in the Pacific Ocean to the pristine wilderness of Antarctica. Scientists have found the plastics in organisms at every level of the food chain from plankton to marine mammals.\n\nIt is unclear what health risk easily ingested microplastics pose to marine life, but researchers fear toxic chemicals in the plastics, and other compounds such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) which stick to them, could be harmful to the animals. The particles may also help spread disease-causing viruses and bacteria.\n\nThe Newcastle team measured the amount of microfibres released from black polyester T-shirts, first in a series of lab tests that mimicked full-scale washing machines, and then in real washing machines at a Procter & Gamble research centre. The results showed that earlier recommendations to use more water and less aggressive washing cycles may actually be releasing more microfibres into the environment.\n\nSome washing machine manufacturers are introducing microfibre filters, but Mark Kelly, the first author of the study published in Environmental Science and Technology, said avoiding delicate washes and half loads would help to reduce the amounts of microfibres released by washing.\n\n\u201cThis research is important as it helps to identify how microfibres are reaching the marine environment,\u201d said Prof Tamara Galloway, an ecotoxicologist at the University of Exeter, who was not involved in the study.\n\n\u201cWe have found microplastics in most of the marine animals we study, including turtles, seals and dolphins. Microfibres are the type of microplastics we find most frequently. Whilst we can\u2019t say for sure what the health impacts of ingesting microfibres from textiles might be, minimising exposure has got to be a high priority for protecting the marine environment and the food chain.\u201d", "description": "Study finds 800,000 extra fibres are shed than on standard washing machine setting", "authors": ["Ian Sample"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/feffe247701791038d09bab6b5c823f6adb59559/0_40_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cf8621acc37a7f996dc3b5dc60124e15", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
