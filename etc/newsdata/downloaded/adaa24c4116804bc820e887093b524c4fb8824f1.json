Today, the companies announced a partnership that they hope will help boost DataGrail, while providing Okta customers with a privacy tool option.\n\nDataGrail CEO and co-founder Daniel Barber says that with the increase in privacy legislation from GDPR to the upcoming California Consumer Protection Act (and many other proposed bills in various states of progress), companies need tools to help them comply and protect user privacy. \u201cWe are a privacy platform focused on delivering continuous compliance for businesses,\u201d Barber says.\n\nThey do this in a way that fits nicely with Okta\u2019s approach to identity. Whereas Okta provides a place to access all of your cloud applications from a single place with one logon, DataGrail connects to your applications with connectors to provide a way to monitor privacy across the organization from a single view.\n\nIt currently has 180 connectors to common enterprise applications like Salesforce, HubSpot, Marketo and Oracle. It then collects this data and presents it to the company in a central interface to help ensure privacy. \u201cOur key differentiator is that we\u2019re able to deliver a live data map of the customer data that exists within an organization,\u201d Barber explained.\n\nThe company just launched last year, but Barber sees similarities in their approaches. \u201cWe we see clear alignment on our go-to-market approach. The product that we built aligns very similarly to the way Okta is deployed, and we\u2019re a true partner with the industry leader in identity management,\u201d he said.\n\nMonty Gray, SVP and head of corporate development at Okta, says that the company is always looking for innovative companies that fit well with Okta. The company liked DataGrail enough to contribute to the startup\u2019s $5.2 million Series A investment in July.\n\nGray says that while DataGrail isn\u2019t the only privacy company it\u2019s partnering with, he likes how DataGrail is helping with privacy compliance in large organizations. \u201cWe saw how DataGrail was thinking about [privacy] in a modern fashion. They enable these technology companies to become not only compliant, but do it in a way where they were not directly in the flow, that they would get out of the way,\u201d Gray explained.\n\nBarber says having the help of Okta could help drive sales, and for a company that\u2019s just getting off the ground, having a public company in your corner as an investor, as well as a partner, could help push the company forward. That\u2019s all that any early startup can hope for.", "description": "When Okta launched its $50 million Okta Ventures investment fund in April, one of its investments was in an early stage privacy startup called DataGrail.
