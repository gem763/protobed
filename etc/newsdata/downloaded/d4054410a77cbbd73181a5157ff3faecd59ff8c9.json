But she made a conscious decision to severely cut back on performing about six years ago.\n\nShe\u2019s frank about the reason.\n\n\u201cMy husband was diagnosed with dementia in 2012,\u201d she says, matter-of-factly. \u201cI opted to put my husband first and the career second.\u201d\n\nNow, however, she has begun to inch back into the public eye. She has been traveling around the country offering a workshop called \u201cHay M\u00e1s Adelante,\u201d or \u201cThere is More Ahead.\u201d Presented by United Healthcare, she talks about subjects facing older adults such as caregiving, staying active and how life has changed since her husband\u2019s diagnosis.\n\nIt's not the kind of performance people are used to seeing from the singer, known for her torchy, searing vocals.\n\n\"You must keep busy,\" she says on the phone from her home in San Antonio. \"I\u2019m alive and I\u2019m doing what I\u2019m supposed to be doing right now, which is sharing my story and talking to people.\"\n\nAnd, of course, she will offer a song or two. After all, she knows her audience.\n\nMORE: 10 great Vikki Carr songs\n\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s part of the draw,\u201d she says with a conspiratorial giggle.\n\nVikki Carr's love story\n\nCarr and Pedro De Leon wed in 1993. He was a widower; she was twice divorced. She moved from Beverly Hills to San Antonio, where he lived and worked as a prominent physician.\n\n\"I remember when I married him it was kind of refreshing,\" she says. \"I wasn't here as Vikki Carr, the singer. I was Dr. De Leon's wife.\"\n\nOn social media, she will post pictures of her and her husband. \"I'm 79. He is 89 and still looks incredible!\" she happily gushes.\n\nShe has active Instagram, Twitter and Facebook accounts. She laughs after it\u2019s pointed out that her first husband, Dann Moss, is a member of her fan club on Facebook.\n\n\u201cOne of my best business partners is my ex-husband, Michael,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m on good terms with both of my ex-husbands. I didn\u2019t take anything from them, because I was always independent.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s one of the qualities the doctor loved about her, she says. He used tell her: \u201cYou work. If anything ever happens to me, I know you\u2019ll be able to take care of yourself.\u201d\n\nBut she recalls one occasion after he first became ill. She decorated his hospital room with cozy rugs to make it feel like home. \"I was supposed to take care of you,\" he sadly said.\n\n\"For better or for worse, in sickness and in health,\" she reminded him.\n\nLiving a new normal\n\nShe employs two caregivers, which has given her the ability to accept speaking gigs and perform occasional concerts. In August, she headlined a benefit in El Paso for the Walmart shooting victims.\n\nShe has created a routine that works for the couple.\n\nHer husband walks every day around the couple's property with the caregivers. They'll accompany him to museums and soccer games, anything to keep his mind active. He'll also go on visits to the mall.\n\nVikki Carr received the Grammy for best Mexican-American performance for \"Recuerdo A Javier Solis\" at the 37th annual Grammy Awards on March 1, 1995, in Los Angeles.

You delivered me!'\"\n\nOn a typical day, she says, the two have dinner at 6:30, then she'll stay up and take care of work matters. Finally, she'll retire to the bedroom.\n\n\"I still sleep with him,\" she says. \"Sometimes he'll recognize me, sometimes he doesn't.\"\n\nShe pauses.\n\n\"I love this man. I still love him even more now seeing what he goes through.\"\n\nAn international diva\n\nIt's a far cry from how life used to be. At the height of her U.S. fame, she was a household name, with hit records like \"With Pen in Hand\" and \"It Must Be Him.\" There were frequent television appearances. A favorite of Johnny Carson's, she appeared more than 30 times on \"The Tonight Show,\" even hosting on occasion.\n\nBorn Florencia Cardona in El Paso, she always included a few Spanish songs in her concerts. But starting in 1980, she began focusing on the Spanish-language market, which embraced her gutsy, emotional style. Her fame grew to immense proportions throughout Latin America. Songs like \u201cCosas del Amor,\u201d \"Esos Hombres,\" \u201cTotal\u201d and \u201cNi Princesa, Ni Esclava\u201d have emerged as contemporary standards at Latin radio.\n\nDuring the heady days of the '80s and '90s, it wasn't uncommon for her to perform in four countries in four weeks. Her audiences have included five presidents and the queen of England. The bicultural nature of her fame has meant that she has recorded with Vicente Fernandez and Pepe Aguilar while the likes of Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin were friends.\n\nDoes she ever miss the whirlwind of it all?\n\n\u201cIt was 60 years of doing that,\u201d she says. \u201cDo I miss it? Not really. I don\u2019t need all the hassles and headaches that go along with it. But I will say, my happiest times are being on stage. Not the trips getting there, but being on stage and working with the musicians and performing for people. That, I love.\u201d\n\nThe death of Nancy Wilson last year served as a reminder how great pop singers from a certain era are slowly disappearing, vocalists who don't merely sing but served as all-around entertainers and offered a classic brand of showmanship. In addition to Carr, Barbra Streisand is still around, of course, and people like Johnny Mathis, Jack Jones, Marilyn Maye and Tony Bennett.\n\n\"A musician friend told me I was one of the last of the dinosaurs,\" Carr says, laughing.\n\nShe hopes to be in front of audiences more in the coming days. A musician has contacted her about working on a musical autobiography, with hopes of getting it to Broadway. There is talk of a documentary about her life. And she hopes to return to the recording studio, but the lyrical content will be far different than her famous recordings.\n\nFinding a new voice in church\n\nCarr says she's always been a spiritual person, but in San Antonio, she began singing in the choir during Mass.\n\nShe recently worked with a musician on a rubato arrangement of \"Amazing Grace.\"\n\n\"I want to do a gospel recording, but I want to do it 'a La Vikki.' I want people to listen to the words and know what it means,\" she says. \"The passion for music \u2014 it's still there.\"\n\n\"God moves in mysterious ways and gets you going in different directions, doing things I never thought of before,\" she says. \"I was in church crying, and I asked Jesus, 'What do you want me to do?' And the answer I got is that he wanted me to go on singing in the world.\"\n\nLearning to grieve\n\nIn addition to working on music, she is continually working on herself. She fights guilt about leaving her husband to go work. She says there are periods of immense loneliness. The eldest of seven children, she misses the company of her siblings, who don't live in San Antonio.\n\nVikki Carr performs in concert in El Paso on Aug. 29, 2009.

I asked him what was the matter with me, because I was always crying so much,\" she says. \"He said I was grieving for the loss of what I had, and that it was the best thing I could do. He said 'You've internalized everything, and you have to try release it.'\"\n\nShe talks about how a landscaper who works on her home recently asked her out to a friendly dinner with his wife.\n\n\"It was so wonderful to just get out of the house and just talk, just share part of my life with people,\" she says. \"It's a journey. We all have crosses to bear, and I think it's how we cope with it. Maybe these are things I was supposed to learn, like humility, unconditional love and more kindness. It's like, all of a sudden, you just take a different look at things.\"\n\nSee our full coverage of entertainment news\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2019/10/13/singer-vikki-carr-life-music-have-changed-after-husbands-dementia/3970897002/", "description": "Vikki Carr has been a star for more than five decades.
