Investors in the Dettol and Nurofen maker were unimpressed, sending the shares down 5%, or 265p, to 5607p.\n\nThe company said annual sales growth would now come in at between 0% and 2%, down from an already-reduced range of 2% to 3%.\n\nThird-quarter comparable sales rose 1.6% but missed forecasts as a drop in demand for its baby food in China and cautious buying of its cold and flu products in the US hurt performance.\n\nThe FTSE 100 company also admitted that integrating baby formula maker Mead Johnson, bought for \u00a312 billion in 2017, was proving difficult.\n\nNarasimhan said: \u201cWe have had significant disruption in the business from a large integration as well as from organisational changes, in my view too many changes and too quickly, particularly in health.\n\n\u201cThings have gone wrong over the last few years.
