So it begs the question: If we\u2019re seeing large numbers of Burmese and Congolese, we know what\u2019s happening there, but what\u2019s happening in Ukraine that would increase numbers so dramatically?\u201d\n\nThe answer appears to lie in policies dating back to the Cold War as well as Ukraine\u2019s ongoing conflict with Russia. Yang and others who work to resettle refugees in the United States told Yahoo News that most of those arriving from Ukraine are coming under what\u2019s known as the Lautenberg Amendment, enacted by Congress in 1990 to provide a clear path to refuge for Christians and Jews fleeing religious persecution in the former Soviet Union. (It was co-sponsored by Sens. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., and Arlen Specter, R-Pa.) In 2004, the Lautenberg Amendment was expanded to include religious minorities in Iran, including Christians, Zoroastrians, Baha\u2019is and others.\n\nUnlike regular refugees, who must be referred for resettlement in the U.S. by the UNHCR, another NGO or a U.S. embassy, members of religious minorities from the countries covered by the Lautenberg Amendment can apply directly for refugee status if they have close family in the United States \u2014 a provision that Trump in other contexts has denounced as \u201cchain migration.\u201d Lautenberg applicants are also required to prove only that they are members of a religious minority with a credible fear of potential persecution, a much lower standard than is required under U.S. law for other prospective refugees, who must establish that they\u2019ve either suffered past persecution in their home country or have a \u201c\u2018well-founded fear\u2019 of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d\n\nNearly three decades after the Lautenberg Amendment was established, its protections still extend to religious minorities in former Soviet countries, including Ukraine, which is predominantly Orthodox Christian. The recent wave of Ukrainian refugees has largely been made up of Pentecostal Christians, whose numbers have been growing, particularly in the war-ravaged eastern part of the country, an increase spread by missionaries underwritten, in part, by American evangelicals.\n\n\u201cI think the war is the main factor in why they are leaving, particularly men who don\u2019t want to be drafted,\u201d said Taras Kuzio, a professor of political science at the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy and expert on Ukrainian politics. \u201cThe war kills soldiers every day.\u201d", "description": "Since President Trump took office in January 2017, worldwide refugee admissions to the United States have plummeted, even as the number of people fleeing conflict, persecution or human rights violations around the globe last year was the\u00a0highest on record\u00a0since World War II.
