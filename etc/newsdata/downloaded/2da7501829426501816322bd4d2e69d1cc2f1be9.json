It\u2019s a test of something bigger.", "language": "en", "text": "But the battle in Maine to unseat Republican Sen. Susan Collins is being seen by some progressives as a test of an opposing proposition: That a confluence of conditions will ensure that the makeup of the court energizes the progressive base in kind \u2014 perhaps even enough to prevail in hard-fought Senate races.\n\nDemand Justice, a group of progressives committed to Supreme Court reform, is launching a new digital ad campaign against Collins that seeks to road-test this notion. Backed by $100,000, the ad is entirely about Collins\u2019 role in helping Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh get confirmed last year, and about the dangers posed by the court\u2019s shift to the right, which Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation helped cement.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSo much is at risk now because of her vote for Kavanaugh,\u201d says the woman featured in the ad, who describes herself as a \u201cMainer, a mom, and a veteran.\u201d She also says: \u201cI used to support Susan Collins, but I feel that she isn\u2019t a moderate voice anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cSenator Collins needs to know: She let us down,\u201d the ad concludes, flashing imagery of an angry Kavanaugh ranting at that now-infamous hearing, followed by Collins and Kavanaugh shaking hands.\n\nCollins\u2019 support for Kavanaugh appears to be a key reason she is seriously at risk in 2020. FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Nathaniel Rakich recently pointed to a poll showing that Collins\u2019 approval ratings in Maine are underwater, and that her disapproval is one of the highest in the Senate. As Rakich summarized:\n\nAD\n\nIn the aftermath of her vote on Kavanaugh, progressive groups collectively have raised $4.7 million for [Collins\u2019s] eventual Democratic opponent. And in recent weeks, multiple Democrats announced they would run for her seat, most prominently state House Speaker Sara Gideon, who was quickly endorsed by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and raised $1.1 million in her first week. Together with this poll, these latest developments in the race support the idea that Collins may turn out to be [one] of the most vulnerable senators up in 2020.\n\nWhile there are multiple reasons for Collins\u2019 vulnerability, this may loom as a test of something bigger when it comes to the politics of the Supreme Court\u2019s makeup, in particular.\n\nAD\n\nDemand Justice, the group behind the ad and the strategy, also commissioned some new polling by YouGov Blue to gauge public opinion on the court. It found that 47 percent of registered voters nationally believe that the court is \u201cmainly motivated by politics,\u201d while only 34 percent believe it is \u201cmainly motivated by the law.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s often observed that the Supreme Court is facing legitimacy problems. But the key question for activists focused on the Collins race is whether that sentiment can be harnessed to mobilize the progressive base in the context of electoral politics, and beyond this, for Supreme Court reforms such as expanding the court.\n\nAD\n\nThe reason the ground might be fertile for this is a confluence of factors: McConnell holding a seat; the intense passions that surrounded the Kavanaugh confirmation fight; and recent decisions such as the court\u2019s punt on policing gerrymandering, which fed into suspicions among some progressives that the court is basically enabling GOP counter-majoritarian tactics and harming our democracy in the process.\n\nAD\n\nAdd to this the fact that the court is set to hear a host of other controversial cases \u2014 such as on the fate of the \u201cdreamers,\u201d on abortion rights, and gun regulations \u2014 and it could mean a fusillade of decisions that fuel anger and energy on the left heading into the 2020 election.\n\n\"Voters are already losing confidence in the Supreme Court as an institution, and the more the conservative majority presses forward this term on hot-button cases like abortion, immigration and guns, the more of a progressive backlash we are likely to see in 2020,\u201d Brian Fallon, the executive director of Demand Justice, told me. \u201cRepublicans like Susan Collins are likely to bear the brunt of the Court\u2019s partisan overreach.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIt remains to be seen, of course, what the electoral impact of all of this will be. But if these factors do energize the Democratic base to the degree activists are aiming for \u2014 and if more rank-and-file progressives understand that some of their most basic values are staked on the Supreme Court\u2019s makeup, just as many conservatives do \u2014 it could begin to shift our understanding of how the court impacts our politics.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: Supreme Court justices have taken a symbolic step toward respect and attention\n\nE.J.
