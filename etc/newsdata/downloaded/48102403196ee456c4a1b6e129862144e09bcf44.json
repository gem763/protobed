Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, alleged that the NRA acted as a \u201cforeign asset\u201d for Russia in the run-up to the 2016 election, and that NRA insiders provided access to the American political system to advance personal business interests. The report said the NRA had engaged in a yearslong effort to facilitate the U.S.-based activities\u201d of Butina and Alexander Torshin, the former lawmaker. The NRA called the report \u201cpolitically motivated and contrived.\u201d\n\nButina has contended that she was not a spy and that her actions took place out in the open. Her lawyers have said that she was simply a student interested in American politics and better U.S.-Russian relations.\n\n\u201cI love both countries, and I was building peace,\u201d Butina said in an interview with NPR in May. In the same interview, she said she knew that Torshin was providing the information she gathered to Russia\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. She said that she was honored to help and believed that her notes and analysis would be valuable to Russian officials.\n\nIn April, she told reporters in Moscow in a conference call that \u201cI didn\u2019t expect such a severe punishment.\u201d Russia\u2019s embassy has also said that its diplomats visited her.\n\nThe case was separate from special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into ties between Russia and the Trump campaign. Butina has said she knew nothing about Russia\u2019s efforts to interfere in the presidential election.\n\nButina also said in the NPR interview that has no concerns about returning to Russia because people who know her \u201cknow as a matter of fact that I am not a spy nor do I have any secret information.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I have any problems or I could have any concerns about my safety,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t see that happening.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/cb/a0/abf9c55b46d1985160372fa22743/191025-mariia-butina-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
