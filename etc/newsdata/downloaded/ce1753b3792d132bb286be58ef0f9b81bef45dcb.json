[PARK SANG-MOON]\n\nIf you could recommend one book to read about your country, which would it be and why?\n\nWe are asking these questions to ambassadors in Seoul for our latest public diplomacy series, \u201cTable Talk.\u201d The book, its author and what they say about the country is discussed over a table full of national dishes. What better way to start an exploration of a new land than through food, good writing and a personal guide dedicated to building bridges between countries \u2014 right here in Korea? - Ed.\n\nAmbassador of Jordan to Korea Adel Adaileh leads the group of guests at his residence in central Seoul in prayer during the evening prayer time on May 28. [PARK SANG-MOON]\n\nThe day begins at 3 a.m. during Ramadan for Eman Aldomur, wife of the ambassador of Jordan to Korea.\u201cI would go into the kitchen to start preparing something light for the family to eat before we pray,\u201d Aldomur said. \u201cOnce we start to pray from sunrise, we fast until sunset, focusing on praying, reading the Quran and spending time with God, while we go about our daily activities. Ramadan is one of the five pillars of Islam and it is mainly a month of worshipping God, focusing on God more than other activities.\u201dMuslim communities around the world fast from sunrise to sunset and pray to God at least five times a day in this season, which lasted from May 5 to June 3 this year. They pray wherever they can, in their homes, offices and mosques if they are available in vicinity.\u201cYou would be surprised to hear this, but there are more than 60 mosques in Korea,\u201d said Adel Adaileh, ambassador of Jordan to Korea. \u201cWe also have more than 50 prayer halls in universities and hospitals prepared for the Muslim communities in Korea.\u201dBut as much as fasting and praying unites Muslims around the world, so does the act of breaking their fast.\u201cWe celebrate Iftar with families and friends, and they don\u2019t have to be Muslim to celebrate together,\u201d said Adaileh. \u201cSome Christian friends would invite us to their home to break the fast together, and they would try to make the time suitable to our prayer times.\u201dThe Iftar on May 28 at the ambassador\u2019s residence in central Seoul was joined by staff members of the Jordanian Embassy in Seoul and members of Jordanian community in Korea.\u201cThis is my family in Korea,\u201d said Aldomur as she opened the door to welcome Nash\u2019at Al-Hadid, Nadine Bisharat, Amer Issa and Mohammad Almiqdadi, staff members of the embassy, and Mahmoud Al Qawasmeh, a consultant at Korea Health Industry Development Institute and head of the Jordanian community in Korea.They broke their fast with dates from Jordan while talking about their latest endeavors in Korea.\u201cI work as a consultant to give advice to the Korean pharmaceutical companies on how best to export their products to the Middle Eastern region,\u201d said Al Qawasmeh.\u201cJordan\u2019s health sector developments are quite advanced in the region, and this was one of the areas that His Majesty the King focused on during his most recent visit to Korea,\u201d said Adaileh.King Abdullah II of Jordan last visited South Korea in September 2015.He published a book, \u201cOur Last Best Chance,\u201d in 2011 about his experiences in mediating for peace in the Middle East and diplomatic excursions outside of the region, including to North Korea in 1993, which are described with frank details and a bit of humor.As the crowd at the residence enjoyed the plate of Mansaf (a traditional lamb, yogurt and rice dish) together, the conversation inevitably turned to some of their loved ones back in Jordan.\u201cOn any given day in my phone calls with my daughter back home, BTS is almost always mentioned,\u201d Al Qawasmeh said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand how but they sure have her heart.\u201dPraying between their meals, the Jordanians talked into the night around a table full of Awameh (sweet fried dough balls), Arabic coffee and chai tea.\u201cThis is the norm during Ramadan,\u201d said Jude Adaileh, daughter of the ambassador. \u201cThe night is just beginning for many of us,\u201d she said.The following are edited excerpts of the conversation with the ambassador and his family about observing Ramadan in Korea as well as about Jordan\u2019s latest foreign policy with their neighbors and their counterparts in the Far East.: Any analysis of the King\u2019s meetings abroad, his meetings, speeches, dialogues concentrate on Palestinian issues, because all issues of peace process between Palestinians and Israelis directly affect Jordan, especially in relation to borders, refugees, water, security and issues pertaining to Jerusalem.Jordan has always been affected by its geopolitical, geographical, demographic and economic situation in its foreign policy and international relations. Therefore Jordanian foreign policy is based on a number of key pillars including stability and security, the protection of higher national interests and the responsibility for the Palestinian cause.: It is difficult to answer because each will give an answer according to his or her perspective. If you look at the Middle East, it is the hottest area in the world, with some 90 percent of the world\u2019s natural resources that operate the industrial mechanism all over the world. So naturally there are different voices and perspectives on how best to solve some issues unique to the area.: King Abdullah visited Korea five times in the last 15 years. Jordan, like Korea, is not rich in natural resources. So His Majesty the King focused on developing human resources, just as Korea did.Additionally, Jordan\u2019s health sector developments are quite advanced in the region, and this was one of the areas that His Majesty the King focused on during his visit to Korea last time.Jordan and Korea are also working closely on renewable energy. His Majesty succeeded in creating partnerships between Jordanian and Korean companies to work together on developing renewable energy sources in Jordan, including solar, wind and nuclear. For instance, K-water is working with Jordan\u2019s Ministry of Water and Irrigation and another Korean company is constructing a wind farm in the country at the moment.: I would go into the kitchen to start preparing something light for the family to eat before we pray. Usually our day begins around 3 a.m., as we gather together for a quick meal before we start fasting and praying throughout the day.: Then we would break the fast after sunset, often with friends and families, and this is called the Iftar.: We celebrate Iftar with families and friends, and they don\u2019t have to be Muslim to celebrate together. Some Christian friends would invite us to their home to break the fast together, and they would try to make the time suitable to our prayer times.: I have Christian friends whose families would not cook during the day so that Muslims living around them would not smell the food being cooked while they are fasting.Adel Adaileh: This is actually a question we get asked often. The person who is cooking has the right to taste the food just to check the saltiness.Eman Aldomur: Yes, or it leads to disasters sometimes (laughs). One time I prepared juice for my children and I made a mistake because I put salt instead of sugar.Adel Adaileh: You cannot imagine. After Iftar, there is even traffic jam at nighttime, as most people are leaving their home \u2014 some are going to mosques to pray and some are going to visit their friends and families. People start their life during the night.Eman Aldomur: During Ramadan you connect with your relatives even more than usual. And not just with your relatives but your neighbors and especially your neighbors in need. One important aspect of Islam is charity. At the beginning of the month of Ramadan, many families fill boxes with oil, rice, canned food and other basic necessities and send them to neighbors in need or to orphanages and other facilities.Directions1.
