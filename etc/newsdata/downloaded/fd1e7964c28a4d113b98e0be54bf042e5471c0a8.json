He's got to work on that.\u201d\n\nResponding to a question about Trump\u2019s lies as president, Moore conceded it can be a problem.\n\n\u201cWhen Trump says things that are false, that does undermine his presidential authority,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I wish he wouldn't do it.\u201d\n\nWhen pressed further on numerous false statements Trump has made publicly, like needing an ID to buy a box of cereal and suggesting that wind turbines cause cancer, Moore said, \u201cDonald Trump would be better off to stop talking so much and let his record speak for itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I'm saying is, what Americans care about is his performance, his results, not what he says and how he acts,\u201d he added.\n\nOn the economy, Moore was asked to respond to the numerous failed economic promises and projections made by President Trump.\n\n\u201cTrump makes grandiose promises, he exaggerates,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd sometimes I wish he wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, you know, if you compare where the economy is today versus where it was when he entered office, it's substantially stronger,\u201d he added. \u201cIf you're an American worker and you're looking for a job, this is the best labor market for workers, probably in 50 years.\u201d\n\nAsked about the ongoing trade war between the US and China and whether it was wise to start an economic war, Moore replied, \u201cI think we should, right now\u201d.\n\n\u201cI mean, we have to,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd Donald Trump will not back down.\u201d\n\nMoore, who says he worked on immigration policies for the Trump Administration, was asked if he believed the President\u2019s policies were \u201cdangerous, crazy and extreme\u201d.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d replied Moore, not realizing he was responding to his own quote prior to working for President Trump.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t always agree with his positions on immigration,\u201d he added. \u201cBut I do believe that until we get the border secure and we get that wall built, once we do that, we can increase our legal immigration.\u201d\n\nThe second half of the interview focused on Trump\u2019s personality and character, and Moore was asked what it\u2019s like to advise someone who, Hasan suggested, knows so little about anything.\n\n\u201cI think people underestimate his intelligence,\u201d he said. \u201cI think he\u2019s probably got about a 180 IQ.\u201d\n\nHasan and Moore were joined by a panel of three experts: liberal commentator Tiffany Cross, Republican strategist and author Rick Wilson and Jenna Ellis Rives, a constitutional lawyer and member of the Trump 2020 Advisory Board.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://network.aljazeera.com/sites/aj_corporate/files/3bb4d9be598a4521a13575ac20a49a59_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
