According to Moody\u2019s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi, the darkening economic outlook can largely be attributed to the year-long U.S.-China trade war.\n\n\u201cThe trade war is doing damage to the economy,\u201d Zandi told reporters during a call on Thursday. \u201cYou can see this most vividly in the manufacturing base.\u201d\n\nThe tit-for-tat battle between the world\u2019s two largest economies escalated last month, with the U.S. slapping another round of tariffs, worth 15 percent, on $112 billion of Chinese goods. The Trump administration plans to target another $188 billion in mid-December, which will bring the total amount of Chinese products facing an import tax to $550 billion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nView of an intermodal shipping yard with a loaded container ship docked in the Port of Long Beach. Part of a day to night image series.\n\nIn turn, Beijing has imposed its on tariffs on the U.S., largely targeting automakers and agriculture; as a result, some of the businesses on the frontline of the trade war \u2014 like farmers -- are beginning to suffer as a result of losing major trading partners.\n\nBut if Washington and Beijing are unable to reach an agreement soon, Zandi warned, the U.S. could end up sliding into a recession. The longer the war lasts, the bigger the risk of it weighing on business sentiment and consumer confidence \u2014 which, unlike other economic indicators, has remained strong. In August, the consumer confidence index, conducted each month by the Conference Board, rebounded to 135.7, the highest reading of 2019.\n\nAnd there\u2019s a danger of the tariffs beginning to weigh on consumers, economists have said. The most recent round was concentrated on items like footwear, clothing and textiles. Now, however, the share of Chinese imports of textiles and clothing affected by Trump\u2019s tariffs is at 87 percent from 10 percent, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\nFILE - In this Sept 4, 2018 file photo, shoppers look at shoes at the Nike Miami store on the Lincoln Road Mall in Miami Beach, Fla. (AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee, File) (AP)\n\nUntil then, most U.S. imports of clothing and shoes from China have been spared.\n\nIf Americans become more cautious spenders, that would cause businesses to likely be more cautious about hiring \u2014 or possibly even lay-off some employees.\n\n\u201cYou can see how we can go from an economy that\u2019s just fine to a recession,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why recession risks are high. Connect the dots right back to the trade war.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "\u201cThe trade war is doing damage to the economy,\u201d Zandi told reporters during a call on Thursday.", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/Trumo-Xi-JinPing-iStock.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
