According to this Post report, he is expected to detail mistreatment of career diplomats, including the recall of the former ambassador to Ukraine:\n\nMichael McKinley, the former senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo until his sudden resignation last week, will tell House impeachment investigators Wednesday that career diplomats were mistreated during his tenure and some had their careers derailed for political reasons [bold mine-DL], according to a person familiar with his testimony. McKinley will outline how his concerns culminated with the recall of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, a punitive action he and many other rank-and-file diplomats viewed as wholly unjustified. \u201cThe unwillingness of State Department leadership to defend Yovanovitch or interfere with an obviously partisan effort to intervene in our relationship with Ukraine for the political benefit of the president was too much for him,\u201d said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to be candid.\n\nIt speaks volumes about Pompeo\u2019s failed tenure at State that his senior adviser has resigned in protest over the mistreatment of career diplomats. The Secretary of State is a blowhard and a bully, so we should expect that he would mismanage the department in the same way that he has conducted himself in his dealings with other governments and the press. The report says that McKinley will not criticize Pompeo directly, but \u201che will discuss his concern over the politicization of the agency in the Trump administration.\u201d In other words, he will call attention to the damage Pompeo has done without mentioning him by name. Pompeo is arguably the most partisan Secretary of State in modern times, and the department\u2019s politicization is an outgrowth of that. He has always been more interested in keeping the president satisfied than he was in defending the department he was appointed to lead, and as a result he has failed to stand up for the people that work for him. The Ukraine imbroglio appears to have been the final straw for McKinley, and it may end up being the thing that defines Pompeo\u2019s tenure.\n\nThe Trump administration has waged a war on U.S. diplomacy for almost three years, and it seems that some of the diplomats are finally starting to fight back.", "description": "", "authors": ["Daniel Larison"], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/pompeo-trump.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
