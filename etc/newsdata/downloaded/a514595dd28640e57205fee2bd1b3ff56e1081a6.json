After all, he enjoys recording videos of himself going to the dentist.\n\nNot very many candidates are that engrossed in their campaign that they would even think to record a dental cleaning, let alone post it.\n\nBut then again, he also recorded a video of himself changing a tire. Apparently that is supposed to really generate the votes.\n\nWe even got an \"inside look\" the Beto making cheeseburgers. Impressive, isn't it?\n\nBeto makes a burger pic.twitter.com/PywGSE58jD \u2014 Behind 2020 (@Behind2020) August 24, 2019\n\nAnd he struck again on Thursday when someone from his team captured the former Texas Congressman attempting to get his campaign mini van pulled out of the mud.\n\nBeto gets stuck pic.twitter.com/RuAZFGn8yj \u2014 Behind 2020 (@Behind2020) September 19, 2019\n\nWhoever thought people cared what Beto is doing on a 24/7 basis really needs to reevaluate their campaign's political strategy...and the polls. The attempt at appealing to Millennials by posting everything on social media can only go so far. We get it. You have doctor's appointments. You get flat tires. You cook. You clean. You're trying to relate to voters. Somethings though are better left a secret. Your car getting stuck and your teeth getting clean are two of them.", "description": "Wow..09/20/2019 1:10:54AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/44/77c5f8f1-e992-40fd-894a-968f8ea4efac.png", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
