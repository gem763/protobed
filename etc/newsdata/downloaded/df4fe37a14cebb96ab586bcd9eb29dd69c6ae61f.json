So we are upping our game,\u201d said 32-year-old protester Nathalie, as hardcore demonstrators trashed a station in the previously calm neighbourhood of Tseung Kwan O.\n\nIn the northern district of Yuen Long, a plain clothes police officer opened fire when he was surrounded in his car and attacked by protesters, a petrol bomb exploding at his feet.\n\nLocal media reported a teenage boy was shot and wounded in the same district but police would not confirm whether the bullet came from the officer\u2019s gun.\n\n\u2013 City grinds to a halt \u2013\n\nAs the city awoke on Saturday, the rail network remained out of action \u2014 although the crucial airport service partially re-opened in the afternoon. The subway alone usually carries some four million passengers a day.\n\nShopping malls were closed, supermarket chains said they would not open and many mainland Chinese banks stayed shuttered, their facades sprayed with graffiti.\n\nIn some locations, long lines formed at supermarkets as residents stocked up on rice, eggs, toilet paper and other essentials, fearing further clashes.\n\nPolice sent text messages urging the public to avoid protests over the three day holiday weekend.\n\nWhile the increased vandalism has shocked many in a city unused to such scenes, many more moderate activists say they still have sympathy for those using violence.\n\nThe movement deploys many slogans advocating unity within the different camps pushing for democracy.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon a 67-year-old property agent, who gave his surname Luk, was surveying the damage to his local subway station, its windows shattered and walls daubed with graffiti.\n\nHe said he opposed vandalism but wouldn\u2019t condemn those trashing the station.\n\n\u201cThe government will not make any concessions,\u201d he told AFP. \u201cThe government isn\u2019t having a dialogue with citizens, they are just pushing this one-side behaviour.\u201d\n\nA French resident, who gave his first name Marko, described the face mask ban as \u201cadding oil to the fire\u201d.\n\n\u201cBut I think the people who destroyed the stations are extremists,\u201d he added.\n\nPro-China lawmakers and police praised Lam\u2019s ban. Beijing also voiced support, calling it \u201cextremely necessary\u201d.\n\nBut critics said Lam\u2019s move was a major step towards authoritarianism.\n\nThe emergency power, last used by the British in 1967, allows Lam to bypass the city\u2019s parliament to make \u201cany regulation whatsoever\u201d during an emergency or moment of public danger.", "description": "Hong Kong (AFP) \u2013 Pro-democracy protesters marched through Hong Kong in defiance of a ban on face masks as much of the city ground to a halt on", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/05/25ee4a_city-subway-was-suspended-hardcore-protestors-trashed-dozens-stations-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
