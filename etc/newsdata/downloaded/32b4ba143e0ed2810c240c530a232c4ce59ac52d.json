(Daniel MIHAILESCU / AFP/Getty images)\n\nGordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, had barely been on the job for a year when he found himself knee-deep in negotiations with the Ukrainian president over President Trump\u2019s desired political investigations.\n\nFor weeks leading up to an explosive whistleblower\u2019s complaint, Sondland, a wealthy hotelier from Portland, Ore., worked quietly behind the scenes to carry out Trump\u2019s wishes in a country that\u2019s not part of the European Union. The ambassador met with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to give \u201cadvice\u201d about how to \u201cnavigate\u201d Trump\u2019s demands, the whistleblower reported. And in text messages turned over to House investigators Thursday, he insisted that Trump\u2019s decision to withhold nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine was not a quid pro quo \u2014 as diplomat William B. \u201cBill\u201d Taylor had feared, according to the texts.\n\n\u201cBill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump\u2019s intentions,\u201d Sondland wrote last month, before urging Taylor, the U.S. charges d\u2019affaires in Ukraine, to call him instead.\n\nThose text messages are now at the center of the House impeachment inquiry into Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, bringing State Department officials\u2019 private discussions surrounding the events into sharp focus. But unlike longtime diplomats such as Taylor, Sondland\u2019s journey into the middle of the scandal now plaguing Trump\u2019s presidency charts an unconventional course.\n\n[Trump wanted Ukraine\u2019s president to launch investigations before face-to-face meeting, State Dept. texts show]\n\nIn some ways, Sondland\u2019s path into politics resembles Trump\u2019s: Before his Senate confirmation in June 2018, Sondland was a savvy businessman, the founder and CEO of Provenance Hotels in the Pacific Northwest, whose government experience was limited to chairing the Oregon Governor\u2019s Office of Film & Television and working on Democratic Gov. Ted Kulongoski\u2019s transition team. The hotel magnate\u2019s support for Trump had ebbed and flowed over the years, ranging from outright disavowal during Trump\u2019s campaign to a $1 million donation ahead of Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\nNow, his support for Trump, at least in the text messages revealed Thursday, comes amid the most pivotal moment of his presidency \u2014 possibly putting Sondland\u2019s own future in the administration in jeopardy. Former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine Kurt D. Volker, who worked behind the scenes with Sondland and provided their texts to House investigators during closed-door testimony Thursday, has already resigned.\n\nAn attorney for Sondland declined to comment early Friday.\n\nSondland, a son of Jewish parents who escaped persecution in Nazi Germany, got his start in the hotel business while he was a real estate broker in Seattle in 1985, when he decided to purchase a bankrupt hotel. After that, \u201cI never looked back,\u201d he told the Portland Business Journal in 2016.\n\nHis chain of boutique hotels \u2014 known for celebrating local art and culture while retaining the history of the original buildings \u2014 proliferated across the country. From Tacoma, Wash., to New Orleans, his company owns or operates 19 luxury hotels, each with distinct themes.\n\nOver the years, he established himself as a generous Republican donor, taking on fundraising roles for the Republican National Committee and presidential candidates including Mitt Romney, John McCain and President George W. Bush, who also appointed him to serve on the Commission on White House Fellows, Politico reported.\n\nHe initially supported Jeb Bush in the 2016 presidential campaign, before turning to Trump, the Oregonian reported \u2014 but the support didn\u2019t last.\n\nOn Aug. 5, 2016, the Seattle Times revealed that Sondland and Bashar Wali, the president of Provenance Hotels, would host a fundraiser for Trump that month. Just two days later, the hoteliers publicly denounced Trump, citing irreconcilable differences in values and beliefs, the Willamette Week reported. A spokeswoman for Provenance Hotels told the paper they didn\u2019t give the Trump campaign permission to list them as hosts of the event, and that they refused to participate.\n\nThe two hoteliers pointed to Trump\u2019s mistreatment of Khizr and Ghazala Khan, the parents of Muslim American soldier Humayun Khan who died serving in the U.S. Army, as a reason for their disdain.\n\n\u201cMr. Sondland is a first generation American whose parents were forced to flee Germany during the years leading up to World War II because they were persecuted for their faith,\u201d the spokeswoman, Kate Buska, told the Willamette Week, \u201cand Mr. Wali is a Muslim American who emigrated to this country from Syria.\n\n\u201cHistorically, Mr. Sondland has been supportive of the Republican party\u2019s nominees for President,\u201d she continued. \u201cHowever, in light of Mr. Trump\u2019s treatment of the Khan family and the fact his constantly evolving positions diverge from their personal beliefs and values on so many levels, neither Mr. Sondland or Mr. Wali can support his candidacy.\u201d\n\nBut again, the disdain would apparently not last for long either.\n\nIn 2017, Sondland donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration committee through four of his limited liability companies. Trump nominated him to be U.S. ambassador to the E.U. the following year.\n\nThe new ambassador quickly took up Trump\u2019s major grievances with other world leaders, urging European leaders to make a better trade deal so they could take on China together. But starting in at least July of this year, according to the text messages, Sondland was working to forward Trump\u2019s interests in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI [spoke] directly to Zelensky and gave him a full briefing. He\u2019s got it,\u201d Sondland wrote in a group text to Volker and Taylor six days before Trump\u2019s phone call with the Ukrainian president that is at the center of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nHonored to meet my good friend @ZelenskyyUa. US \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 & EU \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa united to support #Ukraine \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 & reject #Russia's occupation of #Crimea, aggression in the East, manipulation of Ukrainian energy, and detention of its servicemen. Secure Ukraine=Secure Europe. @USApoRusski @UA_EUMission https://t.co/VjCETmgIS1 \u2014 Ambassador Sondland (@USAmbEU) July 26, 2019\n\nThe texts released Thursday appear to show multiple State Department officials \u2014 including Sondland and Volker \u2014 seeking to lock down Zelensky\u2019s promise to launch an investigation into the 2016 election and into a natural-gas company that previously employed former vice president Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter. Hanging in the air was a potential meeting between Trump and Zelensky that the Ukrainian president badly wanted.\n\nTaylor, by contrast, was skeptical.\n\n\u201cGordon,\u201d he wrote on July 21, four days before Trump\u2019s phone call with Zelensky, \u201cone thing Kurt [Volker] and I talked about yesterday was \u2026 that President Zelenskyy is sensitive about Ukraine being taken seriously, not merely as an instrument in Washington domestic, reelection politics.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Sondland responded, \u201cbut we need to get the conversation started and the relationship built, irrespective of the pretext. I am worried about the alternative.\u201d\n\nAt one point, Andrey Yermak, an aide for Zelensky, appeared ready to agree to have Zelensky publicly announce that the Ukrainians would launch Trump\u2019s desired investigations \u2014 but only once a date for the meeting between the two leaders was settled, the text messages show. Sondland went so far as to consider requesting that U.S. officials have prior review of the Ukrainian officials\u2019 public statement announcing the supposed investigation, according to the text messages.\n\nBut that never happened. After news broke in late August that Trump had withheld $391 million in military aid to Ukraine, Trump also canceled a meeting scheduled with Zelensky in Poland. Taylor grew more concerned.\n\n\u201cAre we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?\u201d Taylor asked Sondland on Sept. 1.\n\n\u201cCall me,\u201d Sondland responded.\n\nTaylor later described fearing a \u201cnightmare scenario\u201d in which the Ukrainians give what Trump wants but do not get the security assistance in return. \u201cAs I said on the phone,\u201d he told Sondland on Sept. 9, \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when Sondland told him he believed he was wrong.\n\n\u201cThe President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind,\u201d Sondland wrote. \u201cThe President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign.\u201d\n\nWith that, Sondland said it would be better to stop texting about the affair.", "description": "Gordon Sondland, who built his wealth as a hotel magnate in Portland, was on the job as EU ambassador for less than a year when he ended up knee-deep in negotiations with the Ukrainian president to forward Trump's interests.", "authors": ["Meagan Flynn", "Morning Mix Reporter", "October At Am", "Meagan Flynn Is A Reporter On The Washington Post'S Morning Mix Team.
