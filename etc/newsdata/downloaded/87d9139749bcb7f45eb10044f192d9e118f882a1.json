Researchers at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) are still trying to figure out why.\n\n\"It's usually a pretty quiet, wimpy black hole on a diet. We don't know what is driving this big feast. We have never seen anything like this in 24 years we have studied the supermassive black hole,\" said Andrea Ghez, co-author of the study.\n\nRead more: A new 3D map of the Milky Way reveals our galaxy's warped shape in unprecedented detail\n\nA few changes the scientists have observed previously was that the black hole shone 75 times brighter than usual on three separate days this year, according to Ghez. They called these changes \"unprecedented\".\n\nNow, its unusual appetite has researchers thinking that the black hole might be entering a new phase altogether.\n\nResearchers from the UCLA Galactic Center Group looked at more than 13,000 angles of the Milky Way's black hole from the Keck Observatory in Hawaii and the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope in Chile since 2003.\n\nThey suspect that it could be an unusual form of gas that's making the black hole react this way, but if this isn't the case, have also presented three possible explanations as to what could be causing these changes.\n\nRead more: There could be up to 10 billion warm and cozy Earth-like planets in our home galaxy, new research reveals\n\nThe first theory for the black hole's brightness could be due to the star S0-2. When it approached the black hole in 2018, scientists believe that a large quantity of its gas could have been pulled towards it. This would explain what the black hole would still be eating its gasses.\n\nThe other theory is that a set of binary stars called G2 could be the cause of the black hole's unusual appetite. Their closest approach to the black hole was five years ago but its far-reaching effects could have stripped G2 of its outer layer.\n\nScientists believe that if it is not stars, it could be asteroids. If a large enough asteroid was caught in the black hole's gravity, it's possible that it could be the cause of its large meal.\n\nEither way, the phenomenon does not affect Earth in any way. The black hole is 26,000 light-years away from our planet and poses no immediate threat.\n\nIn order for there to be repercussions on Earth, the brightness would have to be 10 billion times as bright than what was observed.", "description": "The supermassive black hole, dubbed Sagittarius A*, is consuming large quantities of gas and dust and researches don't know why.", "authors": ["Sophia Ankel", "Prabhjote Gill", "Business Insider India"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7b9c232e22af09cc207a63-960-480.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
