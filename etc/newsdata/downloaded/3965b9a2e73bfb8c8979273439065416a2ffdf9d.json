Authorities don\u2019t know where it\u2019s coming from.", "language": "en", "text": "But despite the time that has passed \u2014 and the damage done \u2014 the most important questions remain unanswered. Where is the oil coming from? And how can it be stopped?\n\nThe Brazilian government\u2019s apparent inability to answer even these fundamental questions has drawn more scrutiny to the environmental policies of President Jair Bolsonaro, who struggled this summer to contain the fires raging in the Amazon and the international outrage they sparked.\n\nAD\n\nNow, fury is mounting again. Municipalities have resorted to imploring volunteers to help with the cleanup. Videos of the rudimentary efforts \u2014 volunteers simply rolling up oil slicks and plopping them into trash bags \u2014 are going viral. And the environmental minister, Ricardo Salles, is picking fights online with a prominent nongovernmental organization.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cGreenpeace \u2018explained\u2019 why it can\u2019t help clean up the beaches in the northeast,\u201d he said. \u201cAhhh, okay.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Vice President Hamilton Mour\u00e3o said the government had recovered 600 tons of oil \u2014 nearly 4,300 barrels. Mour\u00e3o, a retired army general, said he would send 5,000 troops to northeastern Brazil to give \u201cmore visibility\u201d to government efforts to control the situation.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis oil that is arriving now,\u201d he said, \u201cis the second wave of attack. . . . This accident is unprecedented in the world.\u201d\n\nAnalysts say the most essential piece of the response remains missing: determining the source of the oil.\n\n\u201cThink about in your life, if you spill a gallon of paint while painting, the first thing you do is pick up the can of paint before it empties and ends up on the carpet,\u201d said Doug Helton, an official with the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who has studied mysterious oil spills. \u201cSo if we don\u2019t know the source, you\u2019re picking up oil on the shore but don\u2019t know how much more is out there.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn the early days of the spill, Bolsonaro said it was \u201cdumped there criminally.\u201d Then Salles said it was \u201cvery likely from Venezuela,\u201d a Brazilian adversary, adding that a foreign ship may have caused the spill. A molecular analysis by IBAMA, the country\u2019s environmental agency, showed the oil had not been produced in Brazil. Petrobras, the state-run oil conglomerate, said it wasn\u2019t responsible.\n\nAD\n\nBolsonaro speculated, without offering any evidence, that it might have been a \u201ccriminal action\u201d to sabotage a massive oil auction in November for deep-sea deposits that\u2019s expected to generate $50 billion in licensing fees for Brazil.\n\n\u201cI wonder, we have to be very responsible about what we say \u2014 could it have been a criminal act to harm this auction?\u201d Bolsonaro said. \u201cIt\u2019s a question that\u2019s out there.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMystery oil floats throughout the oceans. It may arise naturally, from seeps in the ocean floor. Or from ships that leak. Tiny bits and pieces may glom onto bigger bits and pieces, forming tar balls. Some are as small as a fingernail, others as large as a soccer ball.\n\nAD\n\nSome spills remain mysterious for a long time. In 2002, for example, the cause of a spill that had killed thousands of seabirds off the coast of San Francisco was found to be a ship that sank in 1953. Another mystery spill recently hit the Chicago River. But the Brazil spill is different.\n\n\u201cThe magnitude of this is extremely rare,\u201d said David Valentine, a marine science researcher at the University of California at Santa Barbara.\n\nChristopher Reddy, a researcher at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, has been trying to crack the mystery. Some Brazilian colleagues recently contacted him to help determine the source of the oil, and he\u2019s now analyzing 14 samples with the hopes of determining the molecular structure of the oil by the end of the week.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe reason oil is fascinating is that it\u2019s very complex, and they all have different personalties,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s investigating a sample to try to figure out its source and how long it\u2019s been around.\u201d\n\nThe Bolsonaro administration\u2019s response reinforced the perception among some that Brazil, long a stalwart defender of the environment, is now neglecting that role.\n\n\u201cThe current federal government\u2019s inaction is indeed a puzzle,\u201d said Marcus Andr\u00e9 Melo, a political scientist at the Federal University of Pernambuco. He said it was possible the government had been preoccupied with other tasks \u2014 or hadn\u2019t moved on the crisis for political gain.\n\n\u201cIt was probably waiting for smoking-gun evidence about Venezuela\u2019s involvement in the spill, make a big fuss about it, and finally intervene,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bigger the crisis, the higher the benefits.\n\nAD\n\nAD", "description": "The massive, mysterious sludge has tarred more than 1,000 miles of shoreline.
