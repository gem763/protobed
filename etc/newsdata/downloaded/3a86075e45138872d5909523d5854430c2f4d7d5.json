The second man in the video is known to police, and Smith described him as a suspect in the case.\n\nThe unnamed suspect is seen talking to the two young children, and walking out of the frame with them.\n\nChief Smith noted at a press conference that there is a 37-minute lag between timestamp on the video and the actual time of events.\n\nAbout half an hour after the surveillance video was taken, Kamille was reported missing from the playground birthday party at the housing projects.\n\nIt is unclear whether police believe Stallworth is the potential suspect seen in the surveillance video, though his attorneys strenuously deny his involvement.\n\nThe video shows Kamille and a young friend playing in the top right quadrant of the frame\n\nA male suspect approaches and leads the two youngsters away\n\nKamille was snatched and pulled into a dark SUV from outside the housing project on Saturday\n\n'We hope that the Birmingham Police Department will do everything with the FBI to find the child. We hope the child is still alive, and the child is doing well,' Stallworth's lawyer, Emory Anthony, told a news conference.\n\nIn a statement, attorneys for Brown said she was 'horrified' by the girl's disappearance but had no involvement.\n\nPolice previously identified Stallworth and Brown, whom he dates, as persons of interest in the disappearance.\n\nBoth were arrested on charges unrelated to her abduction, and Stallworth is free on bond.\n\nAnthony said Stallworth did own a vehicle sought by police after being seen in the area, but he denied that the man had anything to do with the girl or knows her family.\n\nStallworth was near the scene for 'legitimate reasons,' Anthony said, and has an alibi for his whereabouts at the time of the abduction.\n\nStallworth was charged with four counts of possession of child pornography and three counts of possession of child pornography with intent to distribute.\n\nAuthorities previously released surveillance images of a male suspect and the SUV they were believed to be traveling in. Cops confirmed they recovered this Toyota Sequioa\n\nThis man was detained for questioning on Sunday night after a person spotted the vehicle outside the Woodside Condominiums and alerted authorities\n\nA massive police presence descended on an apartment associated with the two people of interest on Wednesday morning\n\nBrown, also of Birmingham, was arrested with him on a probation revocation with no bond for an unrelated kidnapping, police said.\n\nStallworth denies the charges filed against him, Anthony said.\n\nAdam Danneman, a public defender whose office represents Brown, said the woman 'adamantly denies' knowing anything about the abduction.\n\nKamille was snatched and pulled into a dark SUV from outside the housing project on Saturday at around 8.30pm.\n\nAt a press conference on Friday, Chief Smith said that he did not believe the abduction was intricately planned.\n\n'I don't believe that a lot of planning went into it. I believe that maybe it was something impromptu,' he said.\n\nSmith also sought community volunteers for a search planned for Sunday.\n\nWithout disclosing details, Smith said the search would involve an area frequented by a person of interest in the case.\n\nHe said that police K9 units would be searching the area intensely until the scene could be opened to community volunteers on Sunday.\n\nKamille's family have made desperate appeals for her safe return.\n\n'I mean she's three, man. She's innocent. I just want my baby back at the end of the day like anybody else would,' her father said to WBRC.\n\n'I mean she\u2019s three, man. She\u2019s innocent. I just want my baby back at the end of the day like anybody else would,' Kamille's father said\n\n'I just want my daughter back. I'll pay anything, I'll put up anything,' he said.\n\n'Everybody knows Cupcake and I'll do anything to bring that baby back home.\n\n'She's scared, she's lonely, she doesn't know what's going on. She's just a baby. Whatever the situation is, whatever they've got going on, it don't concern her.'\n\nThe Amber Alert for Kamille says she is three feet tall and weighs 60 pounds.\n\nAt the time she was taken, Kamille was wearing a pink Minnie Mouse T-shirt and had yellow, white and blue bows in her hair.\n\nCrimeStoppers has offered a $20,000 reward for information leading to Kamille's safe return, in addition to a $5,000 reward from the governor's office.\n\nAnyone with information about the case is urged to contact CrimeStoppers anonymously for a potential reward at 205-254-7777, or the Birmingham Police department at 205-297-8413.", "description": "Birmingham Police Chief\u00a0Patrick Smith released the video on Friday, appealing to the public for information about one of the two men seen in the video, which shows Kamille playing.", "authors": ["Keith Griffith For Dailymail.Com", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/20/19900780-0-image-a-6_1571428117153.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
