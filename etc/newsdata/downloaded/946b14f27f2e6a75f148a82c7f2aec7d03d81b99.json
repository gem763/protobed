We recommend the House should suspend Mr Vaz from its service for six months.\u201d\n\nIf MPs agree, Mr Vaz, of Edgware, North London, would face a recall election. He could also lose any right to a lifetime Parliamentary pass.\n\nTory MP Andrew Bridgen, who made the complaint about Mr Vaz to the committee, said: \u201cHis conduct during the enquiry shows he is not fit to \u00adrepresent anywhere in Parliament.\u201d\n\nThe inquiry was repeatedly delayed by the two police referrals \u2013 which did not lead to a prosecution \u2013 the 2017 election and Mr Vaz\u2019s \u201cill health\u201d.\n\nMPs took the rare decision to redact \u201csensitive\u201d information from his doctors about the medical details.\n\nHis office said: \u201cKeith Vaz has been treated for a serious mental health condition for the last three years as a result of the events of 27th August 2016.\n\n\"He has shared all the medical reports in confidence with the Committee. He has nothing further to say on this matter.\u201d", "description": "Mr Vaz caused \u201csignificant damage\u201d to the reputation and integrity of the Commons by failing to co-operate fully with the inquiry into the scandal", "authors": ["Mikey Smith", "Oliver Milne", "Image", "Getty", "Sunday Mirror"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article13551932.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Keith-Vaz.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
