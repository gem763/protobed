REUTERS/Tyrone Siu\n\nThe recommendation is likely to help Beijing peel away another ally from self-ruled Taiwan, which Beijing considers a wayward province with no right to state-to-state ties.\n\nThe parliamentary task force advised the government to switch ties to China and invite it to establish a diplomatic mission in the capital, Honiara, on the island of Guadalcanal, according to a copy of its report obtained by Reuters.\n\n\u201cThe findings reveal that Solomon Islands stands to benefit a lot if it switches and normalizes diplomatic relations with PRC,\u201d the task force said, referring to China by its official name of the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\nThe recommendation was discussed at a cabinet meeting on Friday, two sources with direct knowledge of the issue said. It has not been presented to parliament.\n\nPrime Minister Manasseh Sogavare has repeatedly said the government would not make a formal decision until reviewing the findings of the task force, which has toured the Pacific studying Chinese aid and bilateral financing.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s representative office in the Solomon Islands called the report a \u201cfallacy\u201d in a Facebook post and said the task force members did not conduct proper fact-finding.\n\nThe government of the Solomon Islands did not respond to questions.\n\nChina\u2019s foreign ministry did not immediately comment.\n\nA diplomatic switch by the Solomons would reduce the number of countries that recognize Taiwan to 16, after El Salvador in Central America, Burkina Faso in West Africa and the Dominican Republic in the Caribbean, all switched to Beijing last year.\n\nThe South Pacific has been a diplomatic stronghold for Taiwan, where formal ties with six island nations make up more than a third of its total alliances, though China has in recent years been expanding its influence in the region.\n\nSolomon Island lawmakers who support maintaining ties with Taiwan will want the report to be made public, and to get feedback before any decision is made, according to one of the sources.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s supporters, who include many university students, would like the decision delayed until Sogavare travels to the U.N. General Assembly meeting in New York later this month, in the hope talks he has there might save the Taiwan alliance.\n\nThe issue has divided loyalties in the former British protectorate, an archipelago of just over 600,000 people.\n\nThe United States has criticized China for pushing poor countries into debt, mainly through lending for large-scale infrastructure projects, and accused China of using \u201cpredatory economics\u201d to destabilize the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nChina denies that.\n\nOne Solomon Islands province has said it would not be responsible for repaying any debts incurred by the government, according to media reports.", "description": "A Solomon Islands task force recommended to the government on Friday that the South Pacific archipelago sever its long-standing ties with Taiwan and normalize diplomatic relations with Beijing.", "authors": ["Jonathan Barrett", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429341975&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C0GH", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
