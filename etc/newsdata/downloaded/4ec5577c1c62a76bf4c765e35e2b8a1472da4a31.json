Forkner has since left Boeing. Neither he nor his lawyer responded to requests for comment.\n\n'I basically lied'\n\nBoeing said in a statement that the company had brought to investigators' attention \"a document containing statements by a former Boeing employee\".\n\nA person briefed on the matter said that Boeing failed to turn over the documents to the FAA for four months and that the US Department of Justice is also in possession of the messages.\n\nThe Seattle Times reported in September that Forkner repeatedly invoked his Fifth Amendment right to not turn over documents subpoenaed by the justice department.\n\nForkner said in one text message, \"I basically lied to the regulators (unknowingly)\". The other employee responded that \"it wasn't a lie, no one told us that was the case\" in regard to the MCAS issue.\n\nForkner responded soon afterwards with: \"Granted I suck at flying, but even this was egregious\".\n\nIn the exchange, Forkner said he was writing while \"drinking icy cold grey goose\". At one point Forkner said \"there are still some real fundamental issues\" in the simulator.\n\nThe messages appear to be the first publicly known observations that MCAS behaved erratically during testing before the aircraft entered service.\n\nThe FAA plans to turn over more communications from Forkner to the US Congress later on Friday, sources said.\n\n'Will lift the grounding'\n\nFederal prosecutors - aided by the FBI, several blue-ribbon panels and the US Department of Transportation's inspector general - are investigating the 737 MAX's certification.\n\nBoeing is currently revising the 737 MAX software to add more safeguards and require the MCAS system to receive input from two key sensors.\n\nThe FAA reiterated that it is \"following a thorough process, not a prescribed timeline, for returning the Boeing 737 MAX to passenger service. The agency will lift the grounding order only after we have determined the aircraft is safe.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Southwest Airlines Company delayed the return of the plane to its schedule until February.\n\nSeparately, the US Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation confirmed it will question Muilenburg at an October 29 hearing, one day before a US House of Representatives panel is scheduled to question him.\n\nBoeing shares fell more than six percent after the Reuters report was published, helping to drag down the Dow Jones Industrial Average to a session low.", "description": "Company communications from 2016 show the firm might not have been fully truthful with United States aviation regulator.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/18/3d6c776b17da4415ba7fe02e6a243de9_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
