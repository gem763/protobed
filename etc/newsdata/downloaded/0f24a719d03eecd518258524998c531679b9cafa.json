In fact, no one was confused during the dedication that this was in fact a body servant.\u201d\n\nIn other words, an enslaved man.\n\nThe American civil war has never been in short supply of myths, but Levin describes black Confederates as the \u201cmost persistent\u201d. Hundreds of articles, organisations and websites rewrite history by asserting that between 500 and 100,000 free and enslaved African Americans volunteered as soldiers in an army fighting to preserve slavery.\n\nJust because it is counterintuitive does not make it true. In the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s election and the white nationalist protest in Charlottesville, Virginia, where a statue of the Confederate general Robert E Lee still stands, the issue resonates beyond the halls of academia.\n\nLevin, a historian, educator and author of the blog civil war memory, has been writing on the subject since 2008.\n\nAmericans still struggle over coming to terms with the core issues of the civil war and reconstruction\n\n\u201cOne of the things that I\u2019m fascinated by is the extent to which Americans still struggle over coming to terms with the core issues of the civil war and reconstruction, and that is slavery and the issue of race,\u201d he says by phone from Boston.\n\n\u201cThis is, it seems to me, the perfect case study through which to track that memory of the war, whether it\u2019s a matter of erasing slavery from the landscape of memory or mythologising, which I think the black Confederate narrative, at least in the last few decades, is really just a perfect example of.\u201d\n\nLevin\u2019s new book, Searching for Black Confederates: The Civil War\u2019s Most Persistent Myth, argues that slavery was central to the south\u2019s war effort. Drawing on research including letters, diary entries and newspaper editorials, it demolishes the notion that the Confederacy embraced black men as soldiers from the beginning of the war.\n\nAfter war broke out in 1861, thousands of enslaved men were forced to accompany their masters into the army as body servants or camp slaves.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely important to think of these enslaved men as the cornerstone or foundation of any Confederate army because it\u2019s their presence, it\u2019s the roles that they\u2019re playing, that make camping, marching and conducting battles even possible,\u201d Levin says.\n\nLife in the camps could be harsh. Levin \u201cfound a couple of cases where the punishments are brutal. One Confederate officer wrote home to his wife in vivid detail about stretching out his camp slave and laying on 400 lashes. The kinds of punishments that you would have found back home on the plantation, you would have found all of that present in the army.\n\n\u201cIt may have even been heightened because you have to remember most of these men who bring camp slaves are officers, so they have to constantly demonstrate their rank.\u201d\n\nWhen the war ended, enslaved African Americans serving the Confederate army were liberated. But by the end of the 19th century, they began to play a central role in the lost cause, a narrative white southerners developed as a way to rationalise and romanticise defeat.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Confederate Monument at Arlington National Cemetery. Photograph: Rachel Larue/Arlington National Cemetery\n\nLevin explains: \u201cThey argue that the war was never about slavery, that their cause remained just even though they were defeated. What was central to the lost cause was that they believed and maintained that their enslaved people remain loyal to them and the Confederacy until the very end.\n\n\u201cSo when it came time, for example, for Confederate veterans to start meeting in large reunion gatherings, it wasn\u2019t uncommon for these former camp slaves to attend as well. They have any number of reasons for attending: I suspect some of them are able to make a little money by entertaining these large white crowds. Some of them, perhaps, wanted to maintain old ties with their owners or the people in their respective units who are now leaders in their respective communities and so it\u2019s a way to maintain their own status back home.\n\n\u201cBut for white southerners and former Confederates these former camp slaves are hugely important symbolically because they symbolise the racial status quo of the antebellum period.\n\n\u201cThese are men who now can be pointed to as the models of proper behaviour for African Americans during the Jim Crow era, so at a time when there\u2019s a great deal of racial unrest throughout the south and there\u2019s a new generation of African Americans who are pushing for equal rights, white southerners can point to these elderly men and say, \u2018This is how you should behave.\u2019\u201d\n\nPhotographs helped fuel the false narrative. The most important, taken in 1861, shows Sgt Andrew Chandler of the 44th Mississippi Infantry Regiment sitting beside Silas Chandler, a family slave. Both are in uniform, clutching pistols, knives and a shotgun. It has been interpreted as an image of comradeship. Levin, however, sees the master-slave relationship.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Marchers pass the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in Charleston, South Carolina, in June 2015, three days after a mass shooting left nine dead. Photograph: Brian Snyder/Reuters\n\nThe spread of the myth also went hand in hand with the raising of Confederate monuments and statues, some of which have been torn down. Levin, who taught in Charlottesville for 11 years, says: \u201cIt provides the narrative for those monuments, especially the monuments that explicitly or specifically address the role of African Americans during the war. There were a number of monuments that honoured the former camp slaves.\u201d\n\nWilliam Faulkner\u2019s oft-quoted observation, \u201cThe past is never dead. It\u2019s not even past\u201d, could have been written in the blood of the civil war, which continues to stain America. Last month Trump, who has been cheered by white supremacists, tweeted a warning about a \u201ccivil war-like fracture\u201d if he is impeached and removed from office.\n\nAmong the stars of what Levin calls the Confederate heritage movement is HK Edgerton, an African American who marches in Confederate uniform and waves the Confederate flag at gatherings of the Sons of Confederate Veterans. According to Levin, Edgerton has expressed a desire to remember a time when race relations were less divisive.\n\nLincoln's spies: Elizabeth Van Lew, southern sexism and the winning of a secret war Read more\n\nHe is living proof that the black Confederate myth persists, especially among white conservatives.\n\nLevin reflects: \u201cI think they embrace this myth because it\u2019s an easy way of pushing aside or minimising the racial divide today. So, if you don\u2019t want to deal with racism today and white supremacy today, what you do is you embrace a historical narrative that minimises it in the past. What that does is sort of gives you cover and reinforces your own view of the present.\u201d\n\nThose looking for further reinforcement will find it at Arlington cemetery, beneath Lee\u2019s mansion, in the depiction of a \u201cmammy\u201d taking a child from a southern soldier on the memorial dedicated in 1914 by the United Daughters of the Confederacy.\n\n\u201cI bring teachers there every summer and they\u2019re all horrified,\u201d Levin says. \u201cAnyone who goes there is just like, \u2018What is this doing here?!\u2019\u201d", "description": "Under Trump, old fractures \u2013 and falsehoods \u2013 are closer to the surface than ever.
