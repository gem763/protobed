Speaking at the signing ceremony for a new U.S.-Japan tariff-cutting deal, Trump interrupted U.S. Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer as he was predicting an eventual House vote.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s possible they won\u2019t vote,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI mean, I know these people much better than you do.\u201d\n\nThe impeachment push has injected even more uncertainty into political decisions that were already frought.\n\nNumerous Republicans have said the impeachment inquiry changes everything. Democrats are trying to forge ahead, multitasking on trade and budget talks while also preparing for impeachment.\n\nThe immediate impact of this new dynamic will be felt on spending and trade decisions.\n\nThe White House and lawmakers must agree to a new spending deal by Nov. 21, and prospects for an easy resolution were already dim because of a fight over border wall funding. The White House also wants Congress to pass a new trade deal with Mexico and Canada by the end of this autumn, a timeline that could now be impossible to meet.\n\nThe awkward balance was on display Wednesday morning, when House Democrats met to discuss their concerns over the revised North American Free Trade Agreement. They are trying to negotiate changes with the White House, but the meeting came less than 24 hours after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) launched an impeachment inquiry.\n\nWhite House officials have spent months trying to assuage the concerns of House Democrats\u2019 and labor unions in order to ratify the new trade deal, but several key elements remain unresolved. Democrats remain unconvinced that new labor rules will be adequately enforced, for example, and they have sought assurances from Trump.\n\nThe chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), issued a stark warning that the new trade deal, called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, was at risk because of impeachment politics.\n\n\u201cIf Democrats use impeachment proceedings as a basis to not act on policy that will directly benefit Americans like the USMCA or lowering prescription drug prices, that would prove they\u2019re more interested in politics and opposing the president at all costs than serving the American people,\u201d Grassley said Tuesday evening.\n\nThe White House has offered competing views, with some officials saying all talks will halt, but others holding out hope for some progress.\n\nIn comments to reporters, Trump seemed unsure of what the result might be. But in a research note, the financial firm Raymond James & Associates offered a more stark assessment, saying \u201clegislating is dead.\u201d\n\nThat view isn\u2019t unanimous.\n\n\u201cThere could be a lane for USMCA approval to show that Congress can get things done while the investigations continue,\u201d said Dan Ujczo, a trade attorney with Dickinson Wright. And there could be precedent for this.\n\nCongress has juggled trade and impeachment questions in the past. In 1973, House lawmakers passed what became the Trade Act of 1974 even as their impeachment inquiry of President Richard M. Nixon was getting underway, said Rufus Yerxa, president of the National Foreign Trade Council.\n\nThe White House on Wednesday signaled that Trump would proceed with his agenda without cooperation from Congress.\n\n\u201cThey want to make a deal very badly,\u201d Trump told reporters, referring to the prospects of a trade deal with China. \u201cIt could happen. It could happen sooner than you think.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the president Wednesday signed what the White House called \u201cthe first stage\u201d of a comprehensive trade deal with Japan, which will open roughly $7 billion worth of Japanese agricultural markets to American farmers.\n\nFollowing Wednesday\u2019s signing in New York with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the administration said Japan had agreed to \u201celiminate or significantly lower tariffs\u201d on products including American beef, wheat, pork, and poultry.\n\nIn return, the U.S. agreed to drop its trade barriers on industrial goods such as machine tools, steam turbines and bicycles. The White House believes trade deals with Japan and China don\u2019t need congressional approval.\n\nProspects for action on issues such as drug prices, infrastructure or guns were already slim as campaigning intensified ahead of the 2020 election. With impeachment in the headlines, those issues could be dead for good \u2014 although Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) told reporters he got a call from the White House late Tuesday with assurances that gun negotiations are still very much ongoing.\n\nBut trade was the one area where bipartisan negotiations had appeared to be proceeding. The issue offered the prospect for a win for both Trump and Democrats. Trump campaigned in 2016 on replacing NAFTA. Many Democrats hoped for a deal that would offer better protections for workers and enforceable standards on the environment.\n\nIndeed, some House moderates who\u2019ve yet to back impeachment said they want to show constituents that they\u2019re able to produce bipartisan accomplishments.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s always a priority for me, but probably even more so now . . . to show the people who sent me here that I\u2019m willing and able to transcend party to do what\u2019s right for the American people,\u201d said Rep. Ben McAdams (D-Utah).\n\nFailure on trade would be a blow to Trump and lawmakers of both parties. But Congress faces one task it cannot shirk: funding the government to prevent another shutdown like the one that crippled Washington for 35 days last winter.\n\nThat job, too, could become tougher amid an impeachment fight, said Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.).\n\n\u201cI was here before when the House impeached [President Bill] Clinton, and . . . it becomes the order of the day,\u201d Shelby said.", "description": "Lawmakers insist they still want to move forward on key items, but the path has clouded.", "authors": ["Erica Werner", "Congressional Reporter Focusing On Economic Policy", "David J.
