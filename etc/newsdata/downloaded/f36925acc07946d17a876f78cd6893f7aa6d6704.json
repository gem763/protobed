Unfortunately, the question didn\u2019t yield as many insights as viewers or moderators might have hoped: While a few candidates spoke obliquely about friendships with unnamed people they\u2019d met in their past or on the campaign trail (and several took the time as an opportunity to talk about \u2026 their websites?), most of the candidates named as their \u201csurprising friends\u201d people who also worked in Congress\u2014in other words, people with whom they share the exact same job.\n\nTo be sure, it\u2019s handy to be able to trot out fond memories of a political figure whose name is recognizable enough to work as a shorthand for a particular set of beliefs. And indeed, three candidates, a full quarter of the field, named the late Republican senator John McCain as their most surprising friend. Joe Biden recalled a touching exchange from just before McCain\u2019s death. Bernie Sanders recounted how he and McCain worked together to get $5 billion in funding for the Veterans Affairs department. Amy Klobuchar remembered how, when they traveled internationally together, McCain would subtly remind foreign leaders who were tuning Klobuchar out that she deserved their attention.\n\nOther politicians entered the mix, too: Cory Booker recalled with a laugh the time that he, a vegan, and Ted Cruz, \u201ca meat-eating Texan,\u201d had to rise to the challenge of finding a meal they could both enjoy; Kamala Harris shared a fond memory of working with Rand Paul on a piece of bail-reform legislation; Tulsi Gabbard said that she and Trey Gowdy, who as recently as last week was in talks to join President Donald Trump\u2019s legal team, \u201cdisagree a lot and very strongly on a lot of political issues,\u201d but \u201cwe\u2019ve developed a friendship that's based on respect, and he\u2019s been there for me during some personally challenging times.\u201d Beto O\u2019Rourke told the story of how he and Will Hurd, a Republican congressman from Texas, ended up driving 1,600 miles to Washington together after their flight was canceled. (\u201cWe live-streamed the conversation,\u201d he added. \u201cA Republican and Democrat, finding out what we had in common.\u201d)\n\nArguably the most compelling answers to the moderators\u2019 question, though, came from the candidates whose answers spoke to the fragile, somewhat fractured state of friendship in the United States in 2019. A confluence of factors\u2014like social media, smartphones, less everyday interaction with strangers, and the abandonment of community institutions like churches\u2014have all contributed to creating an America in which people are more isolated than they were in generations past, and Pete Buttigieg\u2019s response addressed the issue directly.", "description": "Asked whether personal relationships can transcend politics, few Democratic candidates gave insightful answers.", "authors": ["Ashley Fetters"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/GettyImages_1181327710/facebook.jpg?1571237186", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
