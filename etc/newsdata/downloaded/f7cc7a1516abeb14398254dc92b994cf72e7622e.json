While last week\u2019s legendary gear hunt was a bit of a bummer, developer Gearbox\u2019s latest attempt to keep folks interested in their flagship looter shooter gives players the chance to fight some unique enemies that are easy to miss the first few times through the game.\n\nThere are several types of enemies in the Borderlands series, ranging from basic grunts to bosses. Somewhere in the middle lie unique spawns, named foes that provide a decent challenge and special loot but aren\u2019t guaranteed to show up in their designated areas. It\u2019s possible to never encounter them if you don\u2019t comb the entirety of each Borderlands map or if the game\u2019s inherent randomness doesn\u2019t swing your way.\n\nIn Borderlands 3, The Faster You Leave The Starting Area The Better The first few hours of every Borderlands game tend to feel like an uphill grind until you finally unlock better skills and find cooler weapons. Borderlands 3 is no different. But it gets a lot better once you leave Pandora, especially if you want to find a gun that isn\u2019t an underpowered pistol or a shotgun. If that\u2019s you, leave Pandora as soon as you can.

Looking over the news when it was first announced, I was surprised to find just how many of the listed enemies I hadn\u2019t encountered during several playthroughs. Last night, I set out to hunt them down.\n\nTo be honest, players aren\u2019t missing life-changing encounters by not seeking these enemies out. They\u2019re essentially mini-bosses, made more exciting by their rarity and the unique items, like the enemy-weakening It\u2019s Piss grenade, they drop. They have character, though: Rakkman is a parody of Batman, who is encountered in a remote cave on the sprawling Carnivora map. El Drag\u00f3n Jr. is an homage to the masked luchadores of professional wrestling. The Mother of Grogans and her ability to summon fire-breathing lizards calls back to Daenerys Targaryen of Game of Thrones fame \u2014 she can even be defeated with a single melee attack.\n\nI haven\u2019t found much to be excited about here in terms of farming opportunities \u2014 I\u2019m currently wiping out packs of Demoskaggons and Force Troopers squads in the hopes of finding the class mod that continues to elude me \u2014 but the Rare Spawn Hunt has given me a reason to go back through areas I\u2019ve previously picked clean. I love the randomness of these unique enemies, but having them guaranteed to appear during the event is nice too, since even when they spawn, they can be easy to miss in the middle of the game\u2019s chaotic battlefields.", "description": "Borderlands 3 is currently running through a series of week-long events leading up to a big Halloween-themed blowout later this month.
