We try out ideas and then they don\u2019t work the way we thought they should, and then there\u2019s a revision of how those ideas should work. And that\u2019s just the way we go on.\u201d\n\n3. Fiction allows us to test things out\n\n\u201cStorytelling is one of the oldest human technologies we have,\u201d the writer says, and fiction is a valuable tool because it \u201callows you to try out\u201d something \u201cwithout actually having to do it.\u201d\n\nShe thinks, \u201cprobably it was a big educational tool amongst earlier human beings because you could say to children, for instance, this is gonna to be a story about how your uncle Jim got devoured by a crocodile right over there, and then you tell a gruesome tale and the child is not going to go swimming there. They don\u2019t have to test it out\u201d themselves.\n\nIn fiction, utopias and dystopias \u2013 like Gilead in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale \u2013 \u201care ways of testing out possible arrangements of society without actually having to do them.\u201d", "description": "Acclaimed author Margaret Atwood offers up invaluable insights & fascinating life lessons.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p068j75g.jpg"}
