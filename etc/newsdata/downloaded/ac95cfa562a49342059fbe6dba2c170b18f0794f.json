However, his problems are set to get much worse in the coming episodes as he\u2019s arrested for Harry\u2019s murder.\n\nWith news of Harry\u2019s death still very fresh, James finds himself struggling to cope. To block out the trauma of losing his boyfriend, he\u2019s been frequently going out partying \u2014 much to Marnie\u2019s (Lysette Anthony) dismay. However, things are set to escalate for the solicitor in the coming episodes.\n\nAfter upsetting Diane (Alex Fletcher) on the previous day, James apologises for what he said. Breda (Moya Brady) proceeds to interrupt the conversation, but not before James admits to having had a tracking app on Harry\u2019s phone \u2014 something which he attributes to his paranoia.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nNever one to miss an opportunity to save her own skin, Breda attempts to convince James to go down to the station and demand some answers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEventually, he agrees to do so, but tragedy strikes, as \u2014 after confronting the police over the lack of answers they\u2019ve given him thus far \u2014 he\u2019s informed that some new information has come to light. As a result, they arrest him for suspicion of murder.\n\nLater, viewers come to realise that James has been framed.\n\nBut by who?\n\nHollyoaks continues Friday 4th October at 7pm on E4.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "James is in deep trouble!", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/James-is-arrested-in-Hollyoaks-958c_1570119816.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
