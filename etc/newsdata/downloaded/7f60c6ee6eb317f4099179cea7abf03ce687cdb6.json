REUTERS/Feisal Omar/File Photo\n\nFinance Minister Abdirahman Duale Beileh said he was heartened by progress made during discussions with officials from the United States, Somalia\u2019s biggest creditor, Britain, and others during the IMF/World Bank annual meetings this past week.\n\n\u201cThings are looking up ... Everybody was positive,\u201d Beileh told Reuters in an interview. He said U.S. and other officials were pleased with Somalia\u2019s strong performance in hitting key benchmarks in a program to work toward debt forgiveness.\n\nInternational Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva on Saturday pledged the IMF\u2019s full support for Somalia\u2019s push for debt relief in the \u201cnear future.\u201d\n\nThe African nation has about $4.7 billion in external debt, which the IMF has declared to be unsustainable. The Fund is analyzing the exact grants needed from members to address Somalia\u2019s debt arrears ahead of a board meeting in mid-November, Beileh said.\n\nBritain, the European Union and Qatar had offered to cover about $150 million of the roughly $330 million that Somalia owes the IMF, he said.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury, which is owed $1 billion by Somalia, had played a role in encouraging support from other IMF members, and was in talks with Congress about steps needed to erase the big bilateral debt pile.\n\n\u201cThey were very skeptical when our government started, but now they are saying Somalia has traveled enough,\u201d he said.\n\nOnce it obtains debt relief, Somalia is negotiating to receive grants worth about $300 million per year for the next three years, Beileh said.\n\nThat will allow it to start spending on projects to reduce poverty by improving education and healthcare, shoring up water and electricity supply and investing in other critical infrastructure projects, he said.\n\nAfter 30 years with little international support, Somalia has needs \u201con every corner,\u201d he said. \u201cThe country is in bad shape, and that is an understatement. You name it, we need it.\u201d\n\nBeileh said Somalia was also working with neighbors Kenya, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Djibouti on a five-year, $15 billion project to establish ports and transportation corridors.\n\nBacked by the EU, the African Development Bank and the World Bank, the project will help boost trade in the region, he said.\n\n\u201cSomalia is very committed to doing its part. I think we really have turned the corner. And when people are committed, they will do miracles,\u201d he said.", "description": "Somalia will press ahead with poverty reduction efforts and a major regional ports and corridors initiative if international creditors forgive the country's $5 billion debt this February, as expected, the country's finance minister said on Sunday.", "authors": ["Andrea Shalal", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191020&t=2&i=1443110882&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9J0OI", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
