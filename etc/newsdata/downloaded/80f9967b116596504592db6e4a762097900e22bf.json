I\u2019ve never done it and I wouldn\u2019t ever do it.\u201d\n\nThey said PwC\u2019s double role represented a \u201cclear conflict\u201d of interest.\n\n\u201cPwC was advising on a remuneration scheme that protected management from exceptional items, while at the same time it was auditing the allocation of exceptional items,\u201d the person said.\n\nA board member at another large accounting firm said: \u201cProviding remuneration advice to audit clients is not allowed now for good reason.\u201d\n\nPwC earned \u00a34m providing \u201crecruitment and remuneration\u201d advice to Thomas Cook between 2007 and 2012, its accounts show.\n\nPwC said it had stopped advising Thomas Cook\u2019s remuneration committee in 2009, and that a \u00a31.7 million fee for remuneration services in 2011 had been for advice on the closure of a defined benefit pension scheme.\n\n\u201cThe non-audit work as advisers to the remuneration committee was approved in advance by the audit committee, complied with all relevant regulatory standards and was disclosed in the company\u2019s annual reports,\u201d PwC said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThomas Cook\u2019s 2009 annual report said its remuneration committee was \u201cmindful\u201d of PwC\u2019s \u201cdual role\u201d as its adviser and external auditor of the company. \u201cPwC held this dual role because prior to the merger they had acted as remuneration adviser to MyTravel Group and auditor to Thomas Cook,\u201d it stated in the accounts. In 2009, it appointed Kepler Associates as external adviser to the committee.\n\nIn 2008 PwC earned \u00a31.3 million providing recruitment and remuneration advice to Thomas Cook, just \u00a3300,000 less than it received in fees from auditing the business that year.\n\nThomas Cook was hit by a shareholder revolt in 2008 over an extra \u00a35 million bonus to then chief executive Manny Fontenla-Novoa on top of \u00a32 million in bonus awards.\n\nMore than 60 per cent of independent investors voted against boardroom pay, on which PwC had advised. The 2008 accounts show that EY provided an \u201cindependent review\u201d of the benefits policy that led to the supplementary bonus.\n\nA spokesperson for the former directors of Thomas Cook said that \u201cthe pre-exceptional profit measure contributed at best 14 per cent of these payments, somewhat exploding the myth that recent management were personally profiting from one-off costs incurred in transforming the business\".\n\nOne EY insider said the firm had been told to prepare for questions on the accounting treatment of exceptional items.\n\n\u201cUs and PwC reached contrasting conclusions on the accounting treatment of exceptional items,\u201d the person said. \u201cThe [business] committee is interested in why that was.\u201d\n\nEY is being investigated by the Financial Reporting Council over its 2018 audit of Thomas Cook. The regulator said it would \u201ckeep under close review\u201d the scope of its investigation and the question of whether to open any further probes.\n\nFinancial Times", "description": "The firm has been accused of a conflict of interest for advising senior executives at Thomas Cook on their pay and bonuses while it was the auditor of the now-collapsed travel group.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1981%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e0cb4c6b57762012f84dcd8ed72431de91f4ec62", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
