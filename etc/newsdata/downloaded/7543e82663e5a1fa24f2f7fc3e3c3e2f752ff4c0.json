I\u2019m gonna need four years away from them all to get over it.\u201d\n\nTalking of the late Factory Records co-founder Tony Wilson, he said: \u201cTony told the world we were scum and that was how he marketed us.\n\n(Image: Redferns)\n\n\u201cSure, we took loads of drugs and had a good time. But Shaun went over the top. He started telling lies and spoofing me. He loves the limelight and hijacks history to make out he was first to do this, that, the other.\n\n\u201cFor 30 years I\u2019ve bit my tongue. But not any more. The tour is starting, our fans are back and people deserve to know my story.\n\n\u201cYes, Shaun is a lyrical genius but sometimes I look across at him on stage and think, \u2018What a knob.\u2019\u201d\n\nSpeaking from his home in France, dad-of-four Paul added: \u201cThere are countless stories he\u2019s just invented. God knows where they come from.\n\n\u201cThe wild tales of what we got up to recording our fourth album in Barbados were all myths and spoofs.\u201d\n\nRecalling his childhood with Shaun, 57, Paul says: \u201cWhen I was three he pushed me off my bike and I needed hospital treatment. I still have the scars on my hands and it still makes me mad when I look at them.\n\n\u201cIt was always going off between us. I was around nine when he took a psycho-swing at me with his new golf club and split my head open.\u201d\n\n(Image: Coventry Telegraph)\n\nPaul shared a flat with Shaun and Mondays dancer Bez in their late teens, where they held chaotic \u00adparties. He said his brother also gave him \u00adbrutal tongue lashings there \u2013 after one of which he \u201csmashed him in the face\u201d.\n\n\u201cHe was in shock for months and left me alone. I worked out I had to leather him about every three years to keep our relationship in check.\u201d\n\nPaul also reveals it was him who gave the band their name. \u201cOur first gig was 1983, in Salford.\n\n(Image: Redferns)\n\n\"The next week, the Mondays were born. I chose the name. We\u2019d sign on each Thursday and the giro might not come by Friday, so we\u2019d have no money at \u00adweekends.\n\n\"On Monday the giro would arrive. It was the day for getting off your face.\u201d\n\nAfter their heyday in the late 80s and early 90s, Paul struggled with heroin addictions.\n\n(Image: Redferns)\n\nHe says: \u201cWe couldn\u2019t have Calpol for the kids. I\u2019d drink the lot.\u201d\n\nHis youngest son Chico was diagnosed with cancer aged ten.\n\nPaul says: \u201cI found myself coaching him on how to inhale cannabis vapour from a \u00advapourising machine. My drug problems are well documented. I nearly lost my life. But it was cannabis that saved my son\u2019s.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Paul Ryder claims his brother Shaun is living in a fantasy world as the original 24 Hour Party People reform for a greatest hits tour", "authors": ["Joe Cusack", "Image", "Redferns", "Coventry Telegraph"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20565998.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Happy-Mondays.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
