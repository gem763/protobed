The ESA moved its satellite, called Aeolus, and avoided a 1-in-1,000 chance of collision.\n\nAs more spacecraft are launched, the chances of satellite collisions \u2013 and the creation of dangerous space debris \u2013 will go up. Deliberately destroying satellites also won\u2019t help.\n\nExperts worry that debris orbiting Earth could lead to a \u201cKessler syndrome\u201d domino effect that cuts off human access to space for hundreds of years.\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nAs humanity launches more stuff into space, the odds of spacecraft bumping into each other will go up.\n\nSpaceX and the European Space Agency (ESA) got the most recent and talked-about taste of the problem on Monday. On that day, there was a 1-in-1,000 chance of collision between one of SpaceX\u2019s new Starlink internet satellites and the ESA\u2019s wind-monitoring Aeolus spacecraft.\n\nThe ESA decided to fire a thruster on Aeolus and avoid risking a hit, but there will inevitably and always be more close calls in the future \u2013 and sometimes deliberate incidents, such as India\u2019s satellite shoot-down in May \u2013 that generate countless tiny pieces of space junk.\n\nThe US government tracks about 23,000 human-made objects floating in space that are larger than a softball. These satellites and chunks of debris zip around the planet at more than 17,500 mph \u2013 roughly 10 times the speed of a bullet. Until April 1, the list of space junk even included China\u2019s school-bus-size Tiangong-1 space station, which burned up in Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\nHowever, there are millions of smaller pieces of space junk \u2013 sometimes called micrometeoroids \u2013 orbiting Earth, too.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s lots of smaller stuff we can see but can\u2019t put an orbit, a track on it,\u201d Jesse Gossner, an orbital-mechanics engineer who teaches at the US Air Force\u2019s Advanced Space Operations School, told Business Insider in 2018.\n\nAs companies and government agencies launch more spacecraft, concerns are growing about the likelihood of a \u201cKessler syndrome\u201d event: a cascading series of orbital collisions that may curtail human access to space for hundreds of years.\n\nHere\u2019s who is keeping tracking of space junk, how satellite collisions are avoided, and what is being done to prevent disaster on the final frontier.\n\nThis story has been updated. It was originally published on March 27, 2018.\n\nThousands of launches since the dawn of the Space Race have led to a growing field of space debris. Most space junk is found in two zones: low-Earth orbit, which is about 250 miles up, and geostationary orbit, about 22,300 miles up.\n\ncaption A simulation of all the space debris orbiting Earth. source ESA\n\nIn addition to 23,000 objects the size of a softball or larger \u2014 like rocket stages, satellites, and even old spacesuits \u2014 there are more than 650,000 objects that are softball-to-fingernail-size.\n\ncaption NASA astronaut Mike Hopkins in a spacesuit outside the International Space Station on Dec. 24, 2013. source NASA\n\nAnother 170 million bits of debris as small as a pencil tip may also exist \u2013 including things like explosive bolts and paint flecks.\n\nSource: ESA\n\nCountless pieces of tiny debris were added to orbit in 2007, when China intentionally smashed one of its old satellites with a \u201ckill vehicle.\u201d Then in 2009, an old Russian satellite and US satellite collided, adding even more dangerous junk.\n\ncaption Red dots are known pieces of China\u2019s destroyed FY-1C satellite. Green dots are low-Earth orbit satellites. source Celestrak/Analytical Graphics, Inc.\n\nIndia also generated thousands of bits of debris with its \u201cMission Shakti\u201d anti-satellite missile test on March 27, 2019.\n\ncaption A simulation of space debris created by India\u2019s \u201cMission Shakti\u201d test. source Analytical Graphics Inc.\n\nLeftover rocket bodies often have fuel remaining. As the harsh environment of space weakens the rocket parts over time, fuels can mix, explode, and spray more debris every which way.\n\ncaption An illustration of a rocket-body explosion in space. source ESA\n\nNo piece of space debris is insignificant, since each one travels at speeds high enough to inflict catastrophic damage to vital equipment. A single small hit could be deadly to astronauts aboard a spacecraft.\n\ncaption A space-debris hit to space shuttle Endeavour\u2019s radiator found after one of its missions. The entry hole is about 0.25 inches wide, and the exit hole is twice as large. source NASA\n\nJack Bacon, a senior scientist at NASA in 2010, told Wired that a hit by a 10-centimeter sphere of aluminum would be akin to detonating 7 kilograms of TNT.\n\nIf the space junk problem were to spiral out of control, one collision could beget other collisions, and in turn spread even more debris: a chain of crashes known as a Kessler event.\n\ncaption An illustration of a runaway space junk event called the Kessler syndrome. source Shutterstock\n\nAstrophysicist Donald J. Kessler, who used to work for NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center, penned the idea in a 1978 study. Kessler and his NASA colleague Burton G. Cour-Palais calculated that more and more launches in the coming decades would increase the risks of collisions in space.\n\nsource Shutterstock\n\nIn the study, titled \u201cCollision Frequency of Artificial Satellites: The Creation of a Debris Belt,\u201d they also described important sources of space debris and possible sinks that\u2019d remove dangerous junk from orbit.\n\nAs Kessler\u2019s study explains, the more massive an object, the more space debris it can create if hit. Thus, large objects pose a much higher risk of fueling a cascade of collisions if there are many other satellites in similar orbits.\n\ncaption The football-field-size, 450-ton International Space Station. source NASA\n\nA Kessler syndrome event could create an Asteroid Belt-like field of debris in large regions of space around Earth. These zones may be too risky to fly new satellites or spaceships into for hundreds of years, severely limiting human access to the final frontier.\n\ncaption A view of Africa taken by Apollo 11 astronauts on July 20, 1969. source NASA/Flickr\n\nSource: Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee\n\nThe Kessler syndrome plays center-stage in the movie \u201cGravity,\u201d in which an accidental space collision endangers a crew aboard a large space station. But Gossner said that type of a runaway space-junk catastrophe is unlikely.\n\ncaption A scene from the movie \u201cGravity\u201d. source Warner Bros./YouTube\n\n\u201cRight now I don\u2019t think we\u2019re close to that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying we couldn\u2019t get there, and I\u2019m not saying we don\u2019t need to be smart and manage the problem. But I don\u2019t see it ever becoming, anytime soon, an unmanageable problem.\u201d\n\nThere is no current system to remove old satellites or sweep up bits of debris in order to prevent a Kessler event. Instead, space debris is monitored from Earth, and new rules require satellites in low-Earth orbit be deorbited after 25 years so they don\u2019t wind up adding more space junk.\n\ncaption An illustration of the e.Deorbit system to net and remove old satellites from orbit. source David Ducros/ESA\n\n\u201cOur current plan is to manage the problem and not let it get that far,\u201d Gossner said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that we\u2019re even close to needing to actively remove stuff. There\u2019s lots of research being done on that, and maybe some day that will happen, but I think that \u2013 at this point, and in my humble opinion \u2013 an unnecessary expense.\u201d\n\nA major part of the effort to prevent a Kessler event is the Space Surveillance Network (SSN). The project, led by the US military, uses 30 different systems around the world to identify, track, and share information about objects in space.\n\ncaption An illustration of a future space-debris surveillance system that uses ground-based optical, radar, and laser technology, as well as in-orbit survey satellites. source Alan Baker/ESA (CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO)\n\nMany objects are tracked day and night via a network of radar observatories around the globe.\n\ncaption The Haystack and HAX radars located in Tyngsboro, Massachusetts collect 600 hrs of orbital debris data per year. They are NASA\u2019s primary source of data on centimeter-sized orbital debris. source NASA\n\nOptical telescopes on the ground also keep an eye out, but they aren\u2019t always run by the government. \u201cThe commercial sector is actually putting up lots and lots of telescopes,\u201d Gossner said. The government pays for their debris-tracking services.\n\ncaption An amateur astronomer peers through a small telescope. source Shutterstock\n\nGossner said one major debris-tracking company is called Exoanalytic. It uses about 150 small telescopes set up around the globe to detect, track, and report space debris to the SSN.\n\nTelescopes in space track debris, too. Far less is known about them because they\u2019re likely top-secret military satellites.\n\nObjects detected by the government and companies get added to a catalog of space debris and checked against the orbits of other known bits of space junk. New orbits are calculated with supercomputers to see if there\u2019s a chance of any collisions.\n\ncaption A satellite track left by the International Space Station in a long exposure of the night sky. source Michael Seeley/Flickr (CC BY 2.0)\n\nDiana McKissock, a flight lead with the US Air Force\u2019s 18th Space Control Squadron, helps track space debris for the SSN. She said the surveillance network issues warnings to NASA, satellite companies, and other groups with spacecraft, based on two levels of emergency: basic and advanced.\n\ncaption Orbital debris photographed from a NASA space shuttle in 1998. source NASA\n\nThe SSN issues a basic emergency report to the public three days ahead of a 1-in-10,000 chance of a collision. It then provides multiple updates per day until the risk of a collision passes.\n\ncaption An illustration of space junk. Satellites and debris are not to scale. source ESA\n\nTo qualify for such reporting, a rogue object must come within a certain distance of another object. In low-Earth orbit, that distance must be less than 1 kilometer (0.62 mile); farther out in deep space, where the precision of orbits is less reliable, the distance is less than 5 kilometers (3.1 miles).\n\nAdvanced emergency reports help satellite providers see possible collisions much more than three days ahead. \u201cIn 2017, we provided data for 308,984 events, of which only 655 were emergency-reportable,\u201d McKissock told Business Insider in an email. Of those, 579 events were in low-Earth orbit (where it\u2019s relatively crowded with satellites).\n\nsource Uploaded by Srbauer on Wikipedia\n\nWhen a space company receives a SSN alert, they typically move their satellite into a different orbit \u2014 and out of harm\u2019s way \u2014 by burning a little propellant.\n\ncaption An illustration of the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope firing its thrusters to avoid a potential collision. source NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center/CI Lab\n\nAlthough companies like SpaceX are launching more and more objects into space, McKissock said \u201cour everyday concern isn\u2019t something as catastrophic as the Kessler syndrome.\u201d\n\ncaption The last photo of \u201cStarman\u201d in Elon Musk\u2019s red Tesla Roadster as it flies toward Mars orbit. Earth is the bright crescent seen in the background. source Elon Musk/SpaceX via Instagram\n\nThe biggest priority is avoiding damage to multimillion-dollar satellites and keeping astronauts safe. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of watching and, with our active satellites that we do control, avoiding collisions,\u201d Gossner said. \u201cIt becomes a very important problem not just for that satellite, but then for the debris that it would create.\u201d\n\ncaption An illustration of a satellite damaged by space debris. source Shutterstock\n\nSo any time something massive returns to Earth, like China\u2019s 9.4-ton Tiangong-1 space station did in April, it\u2019s a cause for celebration \u2014 not despair.\n\ncaption An illustration of China\u2019s large modular space station, Tiangong-1, burning up in Earth\u2019s atmosphere. source Aerospace Corporation/YouTube\n\nThe next very large object to fall to Earth after Tiangong-1 may be NASA\u2019s 12.25-ton Hubble Space Telescope, which could be deorbited as soon as 2021.\n\ncaption The Hubble Space Telescope. source NASA\n\nLike other objects that can be guided toward their doom, Hubble (as well as the International Space Station, eventually) will be deorbited in the \u201cspacecraft graveyard\u201d: the most remote point of the Pacific Ocean.\n\ncaption Point Nemo, also known as the Oceanic Pole of Inaccessibility. source Google Earth; Business Insider\n\nSource: Business Insider", "description": "Business Insider - Experts worry that debris orbiting Earth could lead to a \"Kessler syndrome\" domino effect that cuts off human access to space for hundreds of years..
