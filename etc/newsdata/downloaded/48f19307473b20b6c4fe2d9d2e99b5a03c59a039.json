Here's the news you need to know Tuesday, in short.\n\nBut first, you deserve a vacation: Southwest is having a big-time sale, and you can snag some one-way flights for $49. I repeat: Forty. Nine. Dollars.\n\nGuilty: Dallas cop convicted of murdering neighbor in his home\n\nA former Dallas police officer who said she mistook her black neighbor for a burglar and fatally shot him in his home was convicted of murder Tuesday and could face life in prison. Amber Guyger, who is white, testified that she walked into Botham Jean\u2019s apartment last September, thinking it was her own, and shot him in self-defense. Prosecutor Jason Hermus said Guyger should have known she was in the wrong apartment: Jean was eating a bowl of ice cream when she walked in. Cheers erupted in the courthouse as the verdict was announced, and crowds outside cheered, \u201cBlack lives matter.\u201d Lee Merritt, one of the lawyers representing Jean's family, said the guilty verdict is \"a huge victory\" that could \"change policing culture around the world.''\n\nFormer Dallas police officer Amber Guyger was convicted of murder in her neighbor's shooting.

At more than 600 square miles, 689 feet thick and about 315 billion tons, the massive new \u2018berg will now be tracked because it poses a potential hazard for shipping, CNN said. It's likely to take several years for it to break apart and melt completely, the BBC reported. Now I know you might be thinking: Global warming?! Probably not this time. \u201cWe don\u2019t think this event is linked to climate change,\u201d said Scripps\u2019 Institute of Oceanography professor Helen Amanda Fricker. \"It\u2019s part of the ice shelf\u2019s normal cycle.\" That's chill.\n\nA roughly 600-square-mile iceberg named D-28 has broken off of Antarctica's Amery Ice Shelf.

Supermodel Gigi Hadid saved the day at Paris Fashion Week when a woman crashed the Chanel runway on Tuesday. Spectator videos show a random audience member casually sneaking into the line of models making their way down the catwalk during the show\u2019s finale. With no security guards in sight, super model hero Hadid blocked the woman from walking and gracefully escorted her away. Cardi B told WWD she \"loved the show,\" but \"got a little scared when the girl\" hopped up on the runway.\n\nPhotos from Paris Fashion Week: The most over-the-top and outrageous looks.\n\nAfter Chanel gained an unexpected extra runway model, it was supermodel Gigi Hadid to the rescue.

According to leaked (!!) audio from meetings with employees, Zuck says he will \"go to the mat\" and fight efforts by the government to break up the social networking giant. \"We care about our country and want to work with our government and do good things,\" Zuckerberg said. \"But look, at the end of the day, if someone\u2019s going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.\" In the leaked (!!!) audio, obtained by The Verge, Zuckerberg also said breaking up Facebook won't solve issues raised by lawmakers, including how they handle the spread of misinformation. Now, we have an important question: Who leaked the audio?!\n\nIs it?
