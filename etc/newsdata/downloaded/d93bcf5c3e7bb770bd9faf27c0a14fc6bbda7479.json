He is also a solo artist and recently released his latest album Out Of My Mind. When he's not recording or performing music, Currie is a fan of reading mystery novels and crime fiction.\n\nCurrie dropped by The Next Chapter to talk about The Witch Elm by Tana French.\n\n\"The book is about a man who lives in Dublin. He lives a very charmed life until one night, after a night of drinking with friends at the pub, he comes home to his apartment just as it is being burgled. He is attacked and sustains a brain injury that affects his memory and his basic cognitive functions.\n\n\"He's forced to live under the care of his elderly uncle, who lives in an old estate home on the outskirts of Dublin. There's a big witch elm tree in the backyard and inside this tree a human skull is found. That's the beginning of the unraveling of everything.\n\n\"Tana French is a very good writer. She writes excellent psychological tension. It's very realistic \u2014 and I've read a lot of crime fiction and mysteries.\"\n\nEwan Currie's comments have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWatch The Sheepdogs perform their song Nobody", "description": "The lead singer and guitarist recently read Tana French's The Witch Elm and loved it.", "authors": ["Cbc Radio"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5306485.1570047855!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/the-sheepdogs-ewan-currie.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
