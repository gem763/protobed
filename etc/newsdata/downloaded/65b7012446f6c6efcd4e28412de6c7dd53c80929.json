But don\u2019t \u2014 justice awaits those doing such damage to our country in the name of assuaging their panic at our political reformation.\n\nMake no mistake, part of the goal of the Democrats ever since Donald Trump was elected by your votes to become president of the United States has been to exhaust and punish you. The president has always been just a proxy for you, the actual focus of the Democrats\u2019 rage and contempt.\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising the Democrats now have resorted to what appears to be another hoax, designed with the same template as their \u201cRussia dossier\u201d debacle.\n\nIn the case of the so-called Ukraine whistleblower scandal, it appears they have fabricated a web of complaints and accusations attempting to turn the normal duties of the president into crimes so they can remove him from office. In other words, the soft coup continues.\n\nThe Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson noted the political bias of the still anonymous filer. The complaint itself, as we now know, describes a situation that never occurred. One can only explain this as the Democrats presumed the president would never release the transcript of the actual call.\n\nAttorney General William P. Barr and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are also being painted as engaging in corrupt or criminal acts in service to the president. None of that is true, of course, but it exposes the intentions to smear the entire administration, no matter the impact on the country.\n\nWith this new hoax, we\u2019re finding that the mentality willing to invent and unleash the Russia dossier hoax wasn\u2019t a one-off act of desperation; it may be standard operating procedure.\n\nThat is what we must not lose sight of. We are in the midst of, as the president has noted in a video statement from the Rose Garden:\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on now is the single greatest scam in the history of American politics. The Democrats want to take away your guns, they want to take away your health care, they want to take away your vote, they want to take away your freedom, they want to take away your judges, they want to take away everything. We can never let this happen. We\u2019re fighting to drain the swamp, and that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m doing and you see why we have to do it. Because our country is at stake like never before. It\u2019s all very simple: they\u2019re trying to stop me because I\u2019m fighting for you and I\u2019ll never let that happen.\u201d\n\nAgain we are seeing a facade cracking, revealing the possibility that many others were involved in the development of the fabricated complaint. On Aug. 28, weeks before he would have officially seen the whistleblower report, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff tweeted a mysterious comment using accusatory language against the president that was almost identical to the complaint.\n\nNancy Pelosi, speaker of the House, slipped up during a CBS interview. Fox News reported, \u201d \u2018He told me it was perfect, that there was nothing on the call,\u2019 Pelosi said on CBS News\u2019 \u201860 Minutes,\u2019 referring to a conversation she had with President Trump before the Trump administration released either a transcript of his call with Ukraine\u2019s leader or the whistleblower\u2019s complaint. \u2018But, I know what was in the call,\u2019 Pelosi continued, before quickly adding, \u2018I mean, uh, it was in the public domain.\u2019 \u201c\n\nTo this, Rep. Liz Cheney asked on Twitter in part, \u201c\u2026 Madame Speaker, \u2018what did you know and when did you know it?\u2019\u201d\n\nWhy such a frenzy now after so many conspirers were exposed through the Russia dossier hoax? Because that exposure has just begun. The attempts to defame Mr. Barr are likely due to the fact that the DOJ\u2019s inspector general report on FISA warrant abuse is about to be released.\n\nThe Democrats are behaving as though they know some very, very bad things are going to be revealed.\n\nMr. Trump will be gone eventually, specifically from office in 2025. But they know his election was not just a fluke. You are the problem. People like you and me aren\u2019t going anywhere. They are behaving as though you need to learn that you must accept that only they know best, that elections are theater, and you had better not dare to ever again act as though you believe in the U.S. Constitution and the silly notion, as determined by the Founders, that you are the sovereign.\n\nAlready we see a sign that their craven strategy against the normals is failing. In a remarkable announcement, the GOP and the Trump reelection campaign announced they took in $125 million in the third quarter of 2019, a presidential fundraising record. For perspective, former President Barack Obama and the DNC raised just more than $70 million in the third quarter of 2011.\n\nThese dramas are birthed by an establishment deciding it\u2019s too dangerous to have Mr. Trump be in charge of all their secrets, believing the ends of removing him justifies the means. In other words, they are going to have to burn down the village in order to save it.\n\nWe aren\u2019t going to let that happen.\n\n\u2022 Tammy Bruce, president of Independent Women\u2019s Voice, author and Fox News contributor, is a radio talk-show host.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
