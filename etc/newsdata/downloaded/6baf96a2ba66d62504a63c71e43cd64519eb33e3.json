Businesses, especially tourism dependent sectors, have begun to complain of an economic sting as the protracted, sometimes violent upheaval scares off visitors.\n\nAs she met face-to-face with her critics, Hong Kong\u2019s Chief Executive Carrie Lam pledged this was no \u201cPR stunt.\u201d Everyone in the course of these past few months has felt worried and anxious, she said, adding that the responsibility for resolving the unrest lies with her government.\n\nVia lottery, 150 members of the public were invited to come and express their concerns. Speaker after speaker blasted Lam\u2019s handling of the situation, questioned why the police were not being held accountable for perceived abuses against protesters and criticized the electoral system.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Others expressed uncertainty about how they could be expected to continue living with weekly pitched battles.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to give this Hong Kong to the next generation,\u201d one man said. \u201cI\u2019m very scared every weekend.\u201d\n\nRead more: Hong Kong\u2019s Summer of Unrest Has Been Drawing Inspiration From Ukraine\u2019s Winter on Fire\n\nMillions of Hongkongers have joined the marches, rallies and demonstrations that have been roiling the semiautonomous enclave since June, though the movement has come a long way from the peaceful demonstrators that snaked through the skyscraper-laden streets with chants of, \u201cCarrie Lam, talk to the Hong Kong people.\u201d\n\nThe contentious extradition bill that initially catalyzed the dissent was withdrawn earlier this month. But the movement has since evolved into a push for outright democracy, or even independence, posing a direct challenge to the city\u2019s political masters in Beijing.\n\nThe former British colony was retroceded to Chinese rule in 1997 under a handover agreement that pledged respect the city\u2019s autonomy, independent legal system and freedom of expression. Protesters accuse the Communist Party of reneging on the deal and encroaching on the city. They have refused to call off the unrest until their additional demands are met, including fully democratic elections and an independent investigation into the police response.\n\nAt the public dialogue, several speakers reiterated this stance, citing the protesters\u2019 slogan, \u201cFive demands, not one less,\u201d to rapturous applause.\n\nBefore Lam\u2019s entourage arrived at the Wan Chai district stadium on Thursday, hundreds of demonstrators began amassing outside the venue. Secondary-school students formed human chains along the nearby shopping district and chanted, \u201cFreedom for Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nConcerned about the possibility of disruptions, officials enforced tight security at the stadium, calling on participants to arrive and register two hours in advance and pass bags through scanners. Attendees were barred from bringing umbrellas, helmets or gas masks\u2014all standard issue equipment at protests.\n\nEarlier in the day, dozens of riot police were seen carrying shields, batons and what appeared to be tear gas cases into the venue. Local media reported that the police kept a \u201cmaximum reserve\u201d of 3,000 officers nearby in case of clashes.\n\nWeekends in Hong Kong, normally one of the world\u2019s safest cities, now regularly feature street brawls between pro-democracy protesters and police. In response to an increasingly hardline knot of protesters hurling petrol bomb and setting fires in the streets, police have fired volley after volley of tear gas, bean bag rounds and rubber bullets. Last week, Amnesty International accused the force of being \u201creckless\u201d and torturing people in custody, and called for independent inquiry.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to come out [and protest],\u201d one of the dialogue attendees said in an emotional address at the end of the evening. \u201cI want to have an enjoyable summer. But\u2026I know I am the future generation\u2026That\u2019s why we stand out bravely.\u201d\n\nThursday night\u2019s dialogue comes three weeks after Lam agreed to formally scrap the bill which sparked the unrest. The contentious legislation would have allowed extraditions to mainland China for the first time. In an opinion column published in the New York Times Wednesday, Lam said her belated concession was necessary \u201cto help create the atmosphere\u201d for the community dialogues.\n\nBut the withdrawal did little to pacify simmering public anger. Critics called the move too little, too late.\n\nLam and Beijing have refused any further allowances, leaving it unclear how the stalemate will break.\n\nThe city is heading into its 17th consecutive weekend of protests with a packed agenda. On Saturday, demonstrators will mark five years since the pro-democracy Umbrella Movement seized the enclave. Then on Oct. 1, counter-rallies are planned to coincide with the Communist Party\u2019s 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China, timing that could result in an embarrassment for Beijing if its celebrations are upstaged.\n\n\u2014 Reporting by Hillary Leung, Hong Kong\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Hong Kong's embattled leader faced a barrage of criticism Thursday night as she held a town hall-style meeting", "authors": ["Time Staff"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/hong_kong_carrie_lam_dialogue.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1"}
