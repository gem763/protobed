I should get paid for that, shouldn\u2019t I? Hey, get your own show!\u201d he said in an interview promoting his new courtroom show \u201cJudge Jerry,\u201d which premieres next week.\n\nMr. Springer, who was mayor of Cincinnati before striking gold as purveyor of daytime weirdness, said he isn\u2019t a fan of Mr. Trump even apart from brand infringement.\n\nThe \u201cvery liberal\u201d host told Build that he\u2019s satisfied with the Democratic field, most particularly Sen. Kamala D. Harris of California, but would \u201cvote for a ham sandwich\u201d over Mr. Trump.\n\nHe added that a Democratic win in the 2020 presidential race will require keeping Mr. Trump as the central issue.\n\n\u201cFrom a pure political point of view, I think we have to be a little careful,\u201d he said. \u201cI think as long as Trump is the issue, the Democrats can win. But if we pick a candidate who all of a sudden takes the spotlight off of Trump and \u2018is this person too far left?\u2019 and suddenly the debate moves in that direction, then I think we could lose the election again.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
