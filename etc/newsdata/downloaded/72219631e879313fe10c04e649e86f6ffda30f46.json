For example, they found a side of chips at JD Wetherspoon contains 955 calories.\n\nAnd, despite fast food outlets getting a bad wrap, a typical dessert at KFC, Burger King and McDonald's contains half the calories of the worst sit-down restaurants.\n\nHungry Horse and Zizzi had the most calorific starters of all chains. The average starter at Hungry Horse (left, its chicken wings) had 660 calories, while at Zizzis (right, its garlic bread with mozzarella) the number was 575\n\nAt Italian Chain ASK (left, its pea and ricotta souffle) the average starter contains 565 calories. At popular Portuguese grilled chicken chain Nando's (right, its famed halloumi with chilli dip), they contain 486 calories\n\nLast year, the Government announced intentions to introduce mandatory calorie labelling on menus across England, in hope of tackling childhood obesity.\n\nThe plans have been met with controversy - the Treasury has pushed back on the calorie labelling plan while charities say it's essential to slash obesity figures.\n\nDespite the debate, it's believed this is the first study to actually highlight how calorific eat-out meals are in the UK.\n\nDr Magdalena Muc, of The Institute of Psychology, Health and Society, led the team. The findings were published in the British Medical Journal.\n\nA total of 27 restaurants' menus were analysed, based on which were most popular and provided nutritional information.\n\nThis included fast-food companies such as KFC, Leon and Subway, and sit-down restaurants such as Ask, Wagamama's and Harvester.\n\nPublic Health England recommends that adults do not exceed 600 calories for a complete meal at lunch and dinner.\n\nAt pub chain Harvester, the average starter contains 424 calories (left, its nachos and jalapenos). Similarly, at Pizza Express starters contain 423 calories on average (right, the chain's doughballs)\n\nOn the lighter end, a starter at Bill's contains roughly 379 calories. At Ember Inns, that number is 318\n\nHowever, based on the research, a three course dinner at a top restaurant in the UK would contain a whopping 1,896 calories on average.\n\nConsidering recommended daily calories for women is 2,000, and 2,500 for men, it leaves only only five per cent and 25 per cent of calories left respectively.\n\nOne in four starters and one in five sides or desserts were more than 600 calories.\n\nA typical starter would set you back 488 calories, a side 397.5 and a dessert 430.6.\n\nHOW DO THE RESTAURANTS RANK BY CALORIES IN STARTERS?
