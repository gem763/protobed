Disbursements rose to $11.69 billion compared to the previous year's $8.93 billion with 35 states receiving more than $2.44 billion, according to the data.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nInterior officials hailed the growth amidst the Trump administration's push for increased oil and gas drilling on public lands.\n\n\"The President believes we can appropriately develop our natural resources and be great stewards of conservation,\" Interior Secretary David Bernhardt said in a statement.\n\n\"The disbursements paid to states and Tribes from energy development revenues go right back to the communities where the energy was produced, providing critical funding for schools, public services, conservation improvements, and infrastructure projects that create good-paying American jobs.\"\n\nThe agency attributed the growth to higher oil and gas production volumes that offset the market price decrease in the fossil fuels.\n\nRead more here.\n\nHappy Thursday!

The previous statute extended the exclusion zone to areas outside the farm, where workers and others might come into close proximity to processes and equipment used to spread pesticides.\n\nThe new proposal would also no longer mandate family members living on farms to leave during pesticide application times. Instead they can choose whether to voluntarily leave or stay on any homes or in any structures on the farm land.\n\nEPA's stance: EPA head Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerOvernight Energy: EPA chief touts benefits of deregulation for environment | Trump officials weaken fish protections Interior chief once lobbied against | USDA watchdog to probe handling of climate reports EPA chief espouses benefits of agency's environmental deregulation EPA moves to implement Trump order on scaling back industry guidance MORE called the rule changes more \"effective and easier to implement.\"\n\n\"In listening to input from stakeholders, our proposal will make targeted updates, maintaining safety requirements to protect the health of those in farm country, while providing greater flexibility for farmers,\" he said in a statement Thursday.\n\nThe other side: Critics argue the rule significantly shrinks worker and family protections established under the EPA's Worker Protection Standard (WPS), by allowing more chances of contact with often harmful and cancer-linked chemicals and pesticides.\n\n\"The EPA continues to betray farmworkers and the recommendations agreed to by stakeholders, including industry government and farmworkers, in meetings held over two decades by weakening the measures urgently needed to protect farm workers and their loved ones,\" said Lori Ann Burd, environmental health program director at the Center for Biological Diversity.\n\n\"Farm workers and their families continue to be poisoned by pesticides, and if anything, the WPS must be strengthened, not weakened.\"\n\nBurd argued the new changes would largely benefit farm owners at the expense of farm hands who work in close proximity to the chemicals.\n\n\"Over and over, the concerns of farm owners are represented, echoing that they appreciate not being bound by burdensome rules. But they don't have any farm worker voices stating how these rules will affect them,\" she said of EPA's press release on the rule.\n\nRead more on the proposed rule here.\n\nWE'RE KINDA SORTA LEAVING PARIS, BUT ALSO WE ALREADY DID: The White House is reportedly beginning to prepare to formally withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Climate Accord.\n\nThe official withdrawal would cement a promise President Trump Donald John TrumpSchedule for additional depositions in impeachment inquiry revealed Sondland attorney disputes key portions of Taylor testimony: report Impeachment inquiry might be public by mid-November: report MORE made in the White House Rose Garden in 2017, where he first announced his intention to withdraw from the global climate change agreement signed by every other country.\n\nTrump can formally begin the yearlong withdrawal process on Nov. 4, allowing the U.S. to finalize the process on the same date in 2020 \u2013 just one day after the presidential election.\n\nTrump was widely expected to announce the formality during a Wednesday speech in Pittsburgh but instead bashed the deal.\n\n\"I withdrew the United States from the terrible, one-sided Paris Climate accord. It was a total disaster,\" Trump told crowds gathered at a natural gas event, before repeating a line from when he first pledged to leave the deal, saying \"I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.\"\n\nHis views on the deal have been widely criticized by Democrats, environmentalists, and even some Republicans, who say the U.S. is abdicating global leadership at a time when urgent action is required to stem the most dangerous impacts of climate change.\n\nTrump has repeatedly boasted about withdrawing the U.S. from the deal, despite the rigid timelines required by the agreement.\n\nAdding to the confusion was a White House readout of Wednesday's speech, which said \"the President announced he is pulling the United States out of the fraudulent, ineffective, and one-sided Paris Climate Accord.\"\n\nWhen asked by The Hill whether the speech constituted a formal withdrawal, a spokesman for the White House said \"the president has already announced the U.S. withdraw from the disastrous Paris Climate Accord.\" Reporting from the New York Times indicates the formal process is set to begin soon.\n\nRead more about Trump's plans here.\n\nA LAST CHANGE TO BLOCK USDA MOVE: Thirty-two Democratic lawmakers have signed a letter asking House and Senate appropriators to withhold funds in the 2020 budget that could be used to move the U.S. Department of Agriculture's two research agencies out of the capital.\n\n\"With only a fraction of reassigned employees opting to relocate, we are extremely concerned that moving forward with this relocation will increasingly jeopardize ERS and NIFA's ability to continue their critical work as well as cause irreparable harm to the federal scientific workforce,\" the lawmakers wrote, using abbreviations for the Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture.\n\nBackground: The USDA announced in June it would relocate the two agencies to Kansas City. The department's Office of Inspector General has questioned the legality of the decision.\n\nThe move has already had impacts as employees leave the agencies. ERS was forced to delay or quash research after losing nearly 80 percent of its staff as employees fled rather than relocate.\n\nThe House did not include funding for the move in the USDA spending bill, but the Senate version passed Tuesday does.\n\n\"It is disappointing that this bill supports the administration's ill-advised relocation of USDA research agencies. I have spoken out about this relocation effort and remain concerned about the loss of expertise and focus such a move precipitates at USDA,\" Sen.

This administration and its cheerleaders aren't happy unless big corporations are happy, and that's not a balanced way to set conservation policy.\"\n\nOUTSIDE THE BELTWAY:\n\nCoca-Cola named most polluting brand in global audit of plastic waste, The Intercept reports.\n\nDeadly California fire spurs review of guidance to dump burning trash, the Associated Press reports.\n\nSierra Club sues SEC for first time ever over blocked climate resolutions, CNBC reports.\n\nPurple sea urchins wreaking havoc on the West Coast, we report.\n\nMassachusetts sues Exxon Mobil, saying company lied about climate change, Reuters reports.\n\nICYMI: Stories from Thursday...\n\nTrump prepares to formally withdraw US from Paris Climate Accord\n\nClimate change is top priority for young voters: study\n\nSouth Dakota drops pipeline protest laws after lawsuit\n\nPurple sea urchins wreaking havoc on the West Coast\n\nTrump administration rule to shrink exclusion boundaries near pesticide applications\n\nRevenue from drilling on public lands increased by a third last year\n\nDemocrats ask appropriators to block funding for USDA move", "description": "DRILLING DISBURSEMENTS: Revenue collected and dispersed assets from energy production on public lands rose by billions in fiscal year 2019, according to new data released by the Interior Department Thursday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/environment_oildrilling_102618istock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
