Hellvetica, however, turns it into its anti-thesis by randomizing the spaces between \u2014 resulting in nauseating devil script.\n\nWhat makes this atrocity is even more blasphemous is it distorts Helvetica, which is considered by many to be the world\u2019s most iconic and beautiful font. It\u2019s been used in a myriad of timeless designs, such as the New York City\u2019s subway system. Here you can see Roif\u2019s take on it with Hellvetica:\n\nAnother great specimen. pic.twitter.com/qd53NjqsiL \u2014 zacks \u0299\u1d00\u1d05 \u1d0a\u1d0f\u1d0b\u1d07s (@zckrf) October 28, 2019\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s clear Roif and Woodward want to see the world burn\u2026 but after having downloaded it and played around with it a bit, I\u2019m starting to be convinced by their anarchist ways (also the \u2018kern in hell\u2019 pun helped tip me over the line). Beauty and order are overrated, it\u2019s time to wreak havoc on our rigid online world! Also, why should I alone suffer through reading a text in Hellvetica?\n\nI encourage everyone to band together and use Hellvetica on Halloween. Are you a designer working on a new ad campaign for an insurance broker? A teacher updating a course syllabus? Or perhaps cardiologist writing out prescriptions? Doesn\u2019t matter, kern it all.\n\nWreak havoc and feel free to tweet the results to us @thenextweb.\n\nRead next: Australia wants to use facial recognition to verify people watching online porn", "description": "Zack Roif and Matthew Woodward have unleashed a hellish version of the timeless Helvetica font: use it to destroy your friends' hopes and dreams.", "authors": ["M\u00e1r M\u00e1sson Maack"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FUntitled-design15.png&signature=99a9e174e584cde28f99ba7b3755cdd5", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
