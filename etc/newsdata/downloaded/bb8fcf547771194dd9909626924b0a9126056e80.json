Anheuser-Busch Gave It a Try.", "language": "en", "text": "WARSAGE, Belgium\u2014For months, a deeply polarized Belgium has been without a government. This, after the country had already achieved a spot in Guinness World Records for the longest time without a government in peacetime, after elections in 2010 (541 days).\n\nA giant brewer thought beer might help.\n\nWhat the maker of Budweiser, Stella Artois and Corona learned was that people will sit down and drink free beer even if it's nonalcoholic\u2014then steal the table.\n\nBelgium, home of Anheuser-Busch InBev NV, in May held a national election that failed to produce a parliamentary majority. Politicians from the leading parties in Belgium\u2019s two big regions\u2014Dutch-speaking Flanders and French-speaking Wallonia\u2014refused to cooperate.\n\nFor the third time in 12 years, Belgium was left with a caretaker government because of disagreements between Walloon and Flemish politicians. The outgoing prime minister will leave Dec. 1 to take up another job, adding further pressure to come to an agreement.\n\nExecutives at AB InBev, whose products lubricate political discourse on bar stools world-wide, decided to try getting Belgians talking across the divide last month. Their approach was a weeklong political-science experiment entailing hundreds of yellow folding tables and chairs set up in fields, forests and on lake shores along the 250-mile language barrier.\n\nThe bait was free glasses of an alcohol-free version of a brew named Leffe. \u201cNearly three months after the elections,\u201d AB InBev intoned in ads encouraging participation, \u201cwe still don\u2019t have a federal government. Are Flemings and Walloons so different?\u201d\n\nBoth sides were equally bemused to find that Leffe, a brand known for its strong beer varieties once brewed by monks, even had a nonalcoholic version; AB InBev introduced Leffe Blonde 0.0% in January. Some wrote on social media that they were disappointed to discover the beer was alcohol-free, intended to keep conversations civil and comply with a ban on serving free alcohol in public.\n\nCompany officials call it marketing for a good cause. \u201cOur role as beer maker is to get people together,\u201d said Alexis Meeus, Leffe\u2019s senior brand manager. \u201cWe want to show politicians that a compromise between the Flemish and the Walloons is possible.\u201d\n\n\u2018Are Flemings and Walloons so different?\u2019 Participants considered the question over alcohol-free Leffe beer. Photo: Valentina Pop/The Wall Street Journal\n\nFlemish nationalists want independence, or at least greater autonomy within Belgium, often depicting the poorer Wallonia as lazy and living off welfare. Walloons worry that Flanders is veering too far right and that the nationalist movement will destroy the Belgian state.\n\nAB InBev\u2019s attendees were inclined to compromise, because two things Belgians generally agree on is a taste for beer and distaste for politicians.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a shame it had to be a multinational to come up with this idea,\u201d said Cindy Pirard, a Walloon participant who talked politics for over an hour under a scorching sun along a dirt road surrounded by farmland.\n\nIn Belgium, simply talking can be tough. French speakers for generations ran the country, which Dutch speakers still resent. Many Flemings refuse to speak French, even if they can. Few Walloons speak Dutch.\n\nMs. Pirard and her Flemish table partner, both bilingual, discussed topics other than Belgium, including Brexit. Arriving to find warm beer with no alcohol didn\u2019t bother them. An hour later, a van arrived with cold refills.\n\nShare Your Thoughts What would you do for free beer? Join the conversation below.\n\nFrom the campaign\u2019s start, its inclusiveness fell short for some. Many complained on Facebook that Belgium\u2019s bilingual capital, Brussels, wasn\u2019t included in the online sign-up menu for participants to indicate their home region. Others griped that organizers omitted Belgium\u2019s tiny German-speaking region.\n\nThe pop-up conversations occurred at a different spot each day, with GPS coordinates emailed to participants.\n\nOn each table was a link to an online questionnaire prepared by a political scientist. \u201cSay hello to your debate partner. Take your smartphone. Find your debate topics,\u201d the instructions stated. \u201cHave a good debate and cheers!\u201d\n\nAB InBev installed hundreds of tables on the Flemish-Walloon border to spur intra-Belgian debate. Some got filched. Photo: Valentina Pop/The Wall Street Journal\n\nAnswers to the questions, on issues from taxation to retirement age, had to be jointly agreed before submitting. Among them: \u201cHow different are Flemings and Walloons\u2014very different, partly different, not very different, we are all Belgians.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe questions are a bit meh,\u201d said Jos Stevens, a Flemish pig farmer who nearly missed the event because he couldn\u2019t find the table along a forest road near the village of Warsage, where medieval monks brewed strong beer, much like the original Leffe.\n\nFinding spots along the invisible language border to commandeer proved challenging, Mr. Meeus said. One idea\u2014installing a table on a raft in a picturesque lake\u2014was vetoed by a local yachting club that owned the lake. The tables were placed on the shore.\n\nElsewhere, the border crossed private farmland, so organizers retreated to nearby pathways. Some locations changed last-minute, leaving would-be participants heading to outdated GPS coordinates, some complained on Facebook.\n\nFlemish pig farmer Jos Stevens, left, and his Walloon debate partner nearly missed this table tucked away in a forest.

Many drank and left. \u201cIf the organizers wanted to illustrate that the Belgian model doesn\u2019t work, they\u2019re succeeding,\u201d wrote one jilted participant in a social-media post.\n\nA group session near a church, where participants pulled three tables together, concluded that they were all preaching to the choir. They agreed Belgium\u2019s problem is more with people in deep Flanders and Wallonia and with politicians who refuse to talk to each other, not residents near the border.\n\n\u201cThe people who participate are not representative,\u201d said Dave Sinardet, the political scientist who compiled the 10 questions.\n\nMr. Sinardet, who teaches university students about Belgian federalism and nationalism, said he initially balked at working with a multinational but figured it would proceed anyway and that good questions would improve discussions.\n\n\u201cIn the beginning, I hesitated,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good initiative\u2014people talk a lot about each other, but not with each other. But it\u2019s a publicity stunt.\u201d\n\nAt a group debate near a church, participants concluded they were preaching to the choir. Photo: Valentina Pop/The Wall Street Journal\n\nThe campaign\u2019s target was 2,000 attendees. It drew 800 sign-ups, and people at 243 tables submitted replies. Some with no partner joined other tables, complicating the count, said AB InBev spokeswoman Laure Stuyck.\n\nThe company was pleased some 1,500 beers were consumed, she said, meaning people liked alcohol-free Leffe.\n\nMany also liked the yellow tables and chairs. More than half of them disappeared, AB InBev said. One van driver spoke of his \u201cpersonal nightmare at Waterloo,\u201d where tables were stolen within minutes of his setting them up.\n\n\u201cIf people liked them so much, and on the table there is a big sticker that says \u2018National Debate,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Stuyck said. \u201cSomehow we\u2019re happy they took the tables.\u201d\n\nWrite to Valentina Pop at valentina.pop@wsj.com", "description": "The giant brewer, maker of Budweiser, set up yellow tables with non-alcoholic suds to spur \u201cNational Debate\u201d along Belgium\u2019s Flanders-Wallonia border.
