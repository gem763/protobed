Now, he's Mississippi State homecoming king", "language": "en", "text": "JACKSON, Miss. - When he was 10 weeks old, Spencer Kirkpatrick \u2014 an ACCESS student at Mississippi State University \u2014 had open heart surgery at Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt.\n\nThen, some of Spencer's teachers told his father \u2014 Kevan Kirkpatrick \u2014 that it would be hard for him to learn because he was born with Down syndrome, a chromosomal condition that can affect cognitive ability, physical growth and development.\n\n\"He has always adapted with his challenges,\" Kevan said. \"We've also been fortunate to be surrounded by people that adapt with him.\"\n\nSpencer's ability to not only adapt but thrive was evident Tuesday night, when he was named MSU's homecoming king.\n\n\"My friend, Shannon Johnston, taught me that when someone like Spencer comes into the world, an opportunity to realize true human nature presents itself and it comes in the way other people treat that person,\" Kevan said.\n\n'I'm a queen': Meet the Memphis teen who wore a gold gown when he was crowned Homecoming Royalty\n\nSpencer Kirkpatrick shows his school spirit.

From the staff of the ACCESS program that taught and advocated on his behalf to the entire Mississippi State family that has embraced him.\"\n\nEight other students were also running for the honor: Billy Jarrell, Carter Allen, Eddie Price III, Jarrius Carter, Osvaldo \"Ozzie\" Ballesteros, Paxton Cook, Rashawn \u201cRJ\u201d Jackson and Samuel Mosley.\n\nSpencer, speaking the weekend prior to the vote, said it would be amazing if he were to be crowned homecoming king.\n\n\"I would be excited, raising the roof,\" Spencer said.\n\n'He loves this school so much'\n\nSpencer, who graduated from Tupelo High School in 2016, always wanted to go to college. He grew up attending attending Bulldog basketball and football games with his dad, an MSU alumnus.\n\nAnd his brother attended Ole Miss.\n\nHarris \"is Spencer's hero and he wants to be just like him,\" Kevan said.\n\nSpencer's opportunity to go to college \u2014 just like his brother \u2014 was realized when he was accepted into MSU's ACCESS program, a four-year, non-degree program for students with intellectual or developmental disabilities.\n\n'She didn\u2019t stop smiling the whole night': At her first prom, a 97-year-old Rhode Island woman wins prom queen\n\n\"I was so excited when I got my acceptance letter to MSU,\" Spencer said during a recent interview.\n\nAs part of the ACCESS program, students are assigned mentors to help them with various life skills and daily tasks. Susannah Cox, a former mentor and Spencer's friend, said it's hard for students not to love Spencer.\n\nCongrats to our 2019 Homecoming Queen and King! pic.twitter.com/SBzcRa4hzW \u2014 MSU Student Association (@MSU_SA) October 9, 2019\n\n\"He loves this school so much and he just keeps defying odds all the time,\" Cox said.\n\nCox, who served as Spencer's homecoming campaign manager, sums up Spencer's role as a student.\n\n\"There were a lot of students who had a long list of things that they can put on their resume. But Spencer has a lot to offer, too, and he's learned life skills and learned to survive on his own on a college campus,\" she said. \"What he has learned through ACCESS program will carry with him through the rest of his life.\"\n\nSpencer's homecoming win, said Cox, also reflects on MSU's student body.\n\n\"To elect someone who is not the typical student says a lot about MSU students,\" Cox said.\n\n\"Whenever we pulled up to the Union, everyone was coming up to him saying that they hoped he won and they were so excited for him,\" Cox said Tuesday night. \"I was kind of nervous because I really wanted him to win and I knew in the bottom of my heart that he did win, but I still had that little bit of fear.\"\n\n'Never shied away from getting him involved'\n\nSpencer has always been an active student. He grew up playing city league sports and participating in organizations in Tupelo. In high school, he assisted his gym teacher \u2014 Patty Norwood \u2014 with the swim team.\n\nAt MSU, Spencer participates in intramural sports. Football is his favorite.\n\n\"We never shied away from getting him involved in things,\" Kevan said. \"These experiences make him feel comfortable to let him know he can go out and do things he wants to do.\"\n\nMeredith McLaurin, a MSU student and Spencer's lifelong friend, embraced his decision to run for homecoming king.\n\nNo prom date? No problem: Teen's unique outfit lets him become his own date\n\n\"When he told me he was running, I was shocked, surprised and happy, but this is right up Spencer's alley,\" McLaurin said. \"Him running for homecoming king gives me hope in every sense. He's making a difference not only on our campus but for countless other kids around the world.\"\n\nEven if Spencer had not been elected homecoming king, he would have been equally happy for the winner, said his father.\n\n\"It was not about him just doing this to win,\" Kevan said. \"It's about him participating in it and his journey of things he has overcome.\"\n\nSpencer, along with homecoming queen Rachel Dumke and other royalty, will be recognized at halftime of the Bulldogs homecoming game on Nov. 23 when they play Abilene Christian University.\n\nSpencer Kirkpatrick and Rachel Dumke were elected Mississippi State University's homecoming king and queen on Tuesday, Oct. 8, 2019.

He loves the environment, atmosphere, and all of the other students. And on top of loving Mississippi State, it's just amazing.\"\n\n'Absolutely beautiful': Teen fighting cancer surrounded by love on prom night\n\nFollow Wilton Jackson on Twitter: @WiltonReports\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/10/spencer-kirkpatrick-born-down-syndrome-msu-homecoming-king/3928815002/", "description": "He was born with Down syndrome and survived open heart surgery. \"We have seen the most beautiful side of human nature,\" says dad of son's time at MSU.", "authors": ["Wilton Jackson", "Published A.M.
