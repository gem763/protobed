His only hope is to form a coalition with the Likud, who continue to stick by their leader.\n\nShortly after the ceremony Mr Gantz vowed to establish a \u201cliberal unity government\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe government that I will establish will serve all citizens of Israel and will benefit all citizens of Israel,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\n\u201cIn our home, the state of Israel, there is room for all segments of Israeli society,\u201d he added.\n\nLikud agreed to meet Blue and White negotiators shortly afterwards but, in a tweet, hinted the party would not depart from a demand for a power-sharing deal between Mr Gantz, his fellow party leaders and Mr Netanyahu.\n\nBlue and White released a flurry of requests to meet party negotiators, some of which were approved. The religious parties and the right, however, declined, saying their bloc was represented by the Likud.\n\nThe September elections, the second vote in under six months, were inconclusive with neither Blue and White nor Likud, the two biggest parties, able to win enough seats to build a majority coalition in the 120-seat Knesset.\n\nMany fear a third election is on the horizon.\n\nMr Gantz, a lifelong military man, has presented himself as a practical leader who can bridge Israel\u2019s many divisions and address the various security threats it faces.\n\nHis low-key campaign was in sharp contrast to Mr Netanyahu\u2019s, who promised to annex large parts of the occupied West Bank in the final days.", "description": "Israel\u2019s president has officially tasked ex-army chief Benny Gantz with forming the country\u2019s next government, the first time in a decade anyone besides Benjamin Netanyahu has been given the task.
