However, it was above the average analyst estimate of $3.35 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nNet income attributable to the company fell to $247 million, or 72 cents per share, in third quarter ended Sept. 28, from $380 million, or $1.09 per share, a year earlier.\n\nExcluding items, it earned $1.05 per share and beat the average analyst estimate of 91 cents.\n\n(Reporting by Praveen Paramasivam and Soundarya J in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur)", "description": "Kellogg Co reported quarterly sales and profit above market expectations on Tuesday, benefiting from higher demand for its Pringles and Cheez-It snacks, as well as frozen foods.
