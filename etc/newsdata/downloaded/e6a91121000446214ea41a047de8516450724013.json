I mean, who\u2019s going to argue with a crackdown on dangerous hits and less contact during practice, if it improves the odds of players enjoying longer lives and better health in their golden years?\n\n\u201cJust get out there and do our job and do it correctly,\u201d said New Orleans Saints offensive tackle Ryan Ramczyk. \u201cIf they\u2019re going to call it a certain way, that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to have to do.\u201d\n\nThrough the first 49 games of the season - three weeks plus Philadelphia\u2019s victory over Green Bay on Thursday night - an average of 18.40 flags were thrown, according to the busy folks at nflpenalties.com who track every call.\n\nThat\u2019s a significant increase over last season (15.75) and an even bigger jump compared to the numbers from a decade ago (13.85). Since the web site began keeping track of flags (including declined and offsetting penalties) in 2009, the per-game average over a full season has fluctuated from a low of 13.62 in 2013 to a high of 16.20 in 2015.\n\nSo, while it\u2019s still early, this season is already shaping up as a real outlier.\n\nZach Strief, a longtime Saints offensive lineman who now works on the team\u2019s radio broadcast team, largely blames league officials for the increase in penalties.\n\n\u201cI have an issue with the league saying, \u2018Hey, this is a point of emphasis,\u2019 which means, \u2018We\u2019re going to call this completely differently than we\u2019ve ever called it before, and it\u2019s on you guys to adjust to it,\u2019\u201d said Strief, pointing to that as largely the reason for the big increase in offensive holding call the first two weeks. \u201cYou\u2019re also putting the officials in a situation to call it like they\u2019ve never called it before.\u201d\n\nWhile the officials are a convenient target of the fans, Strief said that\u2019s not fair.\n\n\u201cI just think they\u2019ve been put in an unwinnable position,\u201d he said. \u201cIt causes frustration for the fans, it causes frustration for the players and coaches, and it\u2019s all focused on the officials, who are just trying to do what they\u2019re told.\u201d\n\nIndeed, there\u2019s been plenty of griping about the officiating - led by perhaps the biggest name in the game, New England quarterback Tom Brady. He\u2019s hardly alone in complaining that the league has become downright unwatchable at times, as any sense of momentum or continuity is interrupted by a relentless parade of referees flipping on their mics to announce, \u201cHolding, offense, No. 78, 10-yard penalty, repeat first down.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s like watching \u201cThe Godfather\u201d for the first time from the set instead of the theater. Francis Ford Coppola keeps yelling \u201ccut\u201d so Al Pacino can take another crack at his big scene.\n\nThe barrage of penalties did drop noticeably in Week 3 after the league, cowering in fear after being called out by Brady, instructed officials to be less stringent with offensive holding. Still, there were still four games in which at least 20 flags were thrown - led by 23 in Chicago\u2019s victory over Washington - and the average for all 16 games (16.56) was still higher than any of the last 10 seasons.\n\nOne of the worst-offending teams, the Atlanta Falcons, have brought in extra officials at practice to look for infractions and hinted at discipline for those who keep getting flagged. While coaches can\u2019t dole out fines for penalties, they can decide who gets to play. The players can also take financial matters into their own hands, Kangaroo-court style. Offensive guard Jamon Brown said multiple penalties are \u201cdefinitely going to cost you a pretty penny.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s make sure we\u2019re only fighting one team. No more self-inflicted wounds that derail us,\u201d Atlanta coach Dan Quinn implored his team. \u201cIf you\u2019ve ever been in a two-for-one fight, and you\u2019re on the other side of it, it\u2019s not that good.\u201d\n\nThe Falcons (1-2) were flagged a staggering 17 times (one penalty was declined) in their loss at Indianapolis last Sunday, raising their season total to 37. That\u2019s the second-highest figure in the league, trailing only the Browns with 46.\n\nCleveland star Myles Garrett said it\u2019s too soon to get too worked up about the increase in flags.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019ll start to cool down.\u201d he said. \u201cTom Brady said something about it, and you know once he says something, it\u2019s got to go. I know that those are going to slowly decrease and it\u2019s going to get a little bit more regulated, so the game can flow a little bit better.\u201d\n\nDean Blandino, the NFL\u2019s former vice president of officiating and now a rules analyst for Fox Sports, expects fewer penalties the rest of the season. The early weeks, he points out, have essentially turned into extended preseason games since most top players play little or not all during exhibition games.\n\n\u201cTeams still have a lot of things to work out,\u201d he said. \u201cThe football is not as crisp as it\u2019s going to be headed into Week 4 and Week 5.\u201d\n\nStrief complained that some rules to improve safety - such as a ban on helmet-to-helmet hits of any kind - have led to an increase in penalties.\n\n\u201cThe NFL has essentially decided they\u2019re going to officiate safety into the game,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re basically telling players, \u2018Hey, what you know is wrong. Now, adjust on the fly.\u2019 \u2026 You create a lot of hesitancy in players.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a lot the NFL can and should do, from better training for officials to a softening of some rules (offensive holding, as we\u2019ve already seen, and perhaps a bit more leniency on defensive contact beyond the line of scrimmage).\n\nBut we\u2019re good with any rules to improve safety.\n\nIf that means more penalties, we\u2019ll just have to make yellow our new favorite color.\n\n___\n\nPaul Newberry is a sports columnist for The Associated Press.
