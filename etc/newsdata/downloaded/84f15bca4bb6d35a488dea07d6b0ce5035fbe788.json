Having George W. Bush\u2019s nat-sec adviser in Donald Trump\u2019s White House couldn\u2019t be any stranger than hiring John Bolton in the position, and might at least add a little more nuance. Trump himself raised a few eyebrows last night by praising Condoleezza Rice\u2019s \u201cvery interesting and secure perspective\u201d in a Fox News interview with Martha MacCallum:\n\nExcellent interview by @CondoleezzaRice on @MarthaMaccallum on @FoxNews. Very interesting and secure perspective on life. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 11, 2019\n\nIf Trump was willing to bring back Bolton, why not Rice? Savannah Guthrie wondered the same thing, but the former Secretary of State laughed it off \u2026 mostly (via Cortney O\u2019Brien):\n\n\u201cWould you want to be the national security adviser in this administration?\u201d @savannahguthrie asks @CondoleezzaRice pic.twitter.com/puJgmIFyW8 \u2014 TODAY (@TODAYshow) September 11, 2019\n\nBeen there, done that is Rice\u2019s answer, but that was also true of Bolton at one time as well. Who knows? Trump needs to find someone who meshes well with his current nat-sec team; Rice certainly can work with Mike Pompeo, Mark Esper, and the rest of the current team. She knows the issues and the players, and has a clear-eyed view of Russia, Iran, and the Taliban.\n\nWhich, unfortunately, might be the problem:\n\n\u201cNothing about this seemed to be going in the right direction\u2026 We cannot allow Afghanistan to become a terrorist safe haven again. There is nothing to suggest that the Taliban would prevent that from happening.\u201d @CondoleezzaRice on Camp David/Taliban meeting pic.twitter.com/70Y6zEYhJD \u2014 TODAY (@TODAYshow) September 11, 2019\n\nRice would no doubt make an excellent nat-sec adviser, as she did in the past with Bush. That\u2019s not the issue, as Rice herself says. She wouldn\u2019t fit in with Trump\u2019s priorities, although she would likely know how to work around the temperamental issues involved in being on Trump\u2019s team. She sees the world as Bolton sees it, perhaps couched in more careful discourse. Trump would be replacing Bolton with someone who would eventually present the same pushback on Trump\u2019s vision as Bolton did, probably sooner rather than later.\n\nStill, Rice has one quality that Trump treasures \u2014 star power. Rice also has enduring credibility on a range of issues, another quality Trump might need with his constant reshuffling. Rice hasn\u2019t been in office for over a decade and has famously eschewed electoral politics all along, but still commands credibility on the national stage. Trump could use that quality after the departures of Bolton, James Mattis, and John Kelly. Trump\u2019s tweet last night might mean she\u2019s further up the list than Rice imagines.", "description": "\"I think I won\u2019t try to catch lightning in a bottle again.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/rice-nbc.png", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
