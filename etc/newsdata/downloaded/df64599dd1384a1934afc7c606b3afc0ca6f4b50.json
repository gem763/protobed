Law enforcement officers returned fire, killing the suspect.\u201d\n\nAuthorities have said that the suspect is white male in his 30s, but have not released a name.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to jump to any conclusions on this event. We\u2019re monitoring closely the reports, the investigative follow-up from state and local as well as the FBI, but it\u2019s extraordinarily concerning,\u201d said Mr. McAleenan. \u201cIt\u2019s devastating.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the shooting took place about 300 miles from El Paso, the site of an Aug. 3 mass shooting that saw a gunman kill 22 and injured 24 at a Walmart. The massacre is being investigated as a possible hate crime, and the suspect has been charged with capital murder.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a region that\u2019s really felt the impact of mass attacks in recent weeks, and we\u2019re very concerned about it, and we\u2019ll be following up aggressively,\u201d said Mr. McAleenan.\n\n\u201cThey absolutely are a homeland security threat,\u201d acting DHS Sec. Kevin McAleenan tells @MarthaRaddatz when asked about the latest mass shootings.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn our counterterrorism strategy and approach, domestic terrorism has taken a front line focus for us\u201d https://t.co/PYMTgugLr6 pic.twitter.com/45hiwTMQsF \u2014 This Week (@ThisWeekABC) September 1, 2019\n\nSince taking office in April, Mr. McAleenan said his department has set up an office targeting violence and prevention, with an \u201cexplicit\u201d focus on domestic terrorism, \u201cincluding racially motivated violent extremism, which we\u2019ve seen too much of in the recent weeks and months.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, he said he was comfortable with the resources for such efforts. \u201cWe actually have a ton of resources devoted to this kind of crime across the DHS components,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
