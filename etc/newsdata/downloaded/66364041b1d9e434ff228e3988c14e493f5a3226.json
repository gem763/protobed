A pint of Ben & Jerry\u2019s new flavour \u2013 Justice ReMix\u2019d \u2013 would more likely put me into a food coma than onto the streets with a placard.\n\nBut the ice cream brand has been using its commercial clout to highlight social issues for years now.\n\nThere\u2019s been Save Our Swirled to highlight climate change; I Dough, I Dough to support gay marriage; and Home Sweet Honeycomb to show support for refugees in America.\n\nThis type of corporate action could soon become the norm, if 181 of the US\u2019s top CEOs are to be believed.\n\nJust a few weeks ago, they made a small but symbolic promise: that their sole business objective would no longer be simply driving shareholder value.\n\nCould that promise threaten Milton Friedman\u2019s lodestar \u2013 that profit for shareholders comes before all else? Some dismissed it as meaningless, but this week a move by one of the nation\u2019s biggest retailers showed that big business can drive big social changes.\n\nThis week, Doug McMillon, Walmart\u2019s chief executive, said the company would stop selling ammunition used for handguns and military-style weapons, as well as end the sale of handguns and discourage anyone from carrying weapons in his stores.\n\nHe also underlined this corporate activism by releasing an open letter to Donald Trump, calling for a debate about reauthorising the assault weapons ban and to finance research on gun violence.\n\nIt\u2019s perhaps wise to question the motivations of seeming random acts of kindness by business titans, who are answerable predominantly to shareholders. The answer could be found in the demographics they\u2019re keeping an eye on.\n\nGiven that millennials are among the most politically and socially engaged generations of recent times, to attract them as customers and employees means companies have to pay attention to the issues they care about.\n\nAnd in a society where some CEOs are as recognisable as rock stars \u2013 think Tim Cook or Jeff Bezos \u2013 we\u2019re likely to see more political conversations driven and influenced by businesspeople over the coming years.\n\nYours,\n\nDave Maclean\n\nFeatures editor (US)", "description": "Nothing speaks to me about structural racism quite like a bowl of cinnamon and chocolate ice cream.
