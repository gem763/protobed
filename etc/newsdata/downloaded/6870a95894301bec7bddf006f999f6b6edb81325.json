Everyone was there,\u2019 she told Howard Stern on his SiriusXM radio show this week.\n\nAfter she was asked whether it was rare for them to all get together, she insisted: \u2018It\u2019s just Schwimmer was in town, we all happened to have a window of time, so we all got together.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe said they all miss the show and spent their evening \u2018laughing so hard\u2019 as we all curse the fact we weren\u2019t flies on the wall.\n\n\u2018We went to Courteney\u2019s. Nobody got naked, it was very civilised. But we just laughed a lot,\u2019 she said, before adding of Friends: \u2018We all miss it every day.\u2019\n\nOf course she was asked whether there would be a reunion, 25 years after the show premiered, and while she said she \u2018would be nothing without it\u2019, Jen was hesitant to confirm they were getting back together.\n\n\u2018I honestly think\u2026we would love it\u2026there is an idea if there is a reboot of the show it won\u2019t be even close to as good as what it was. It would ruin it,\u2019 she said, agreeing the legacy of the show was important.\n\nSpeaking of the iconic salaries they received \u2013 reportedly topping $1million (\u00a3818,000) per episode towards the end \u2013 Jen spoke about the group of six\u2019s fight for parity.\n\n\u2018We stood as a solidary unit and asked for equal pay,\u2019 she said.\n\n\u2018We were leading the charge, ahead of our time.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
