At least five deaths were reported, with the full scope of the disaster still unknown.\n\nThe storm\u2019s punishing winds and muddy brown floodwaters destroyed or severely damaged thousands of homes, crippled hospitals and trapped people in attics.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s total devastation. It\u2019s decimated. Apocalyptic. It looks like a bomb went off,\u201d said Lia Head-Rigby, who helps run a local hurricane relief organization and flew over the Bahamas\u2019 hard-hit Abaco Islands. \u201cIt\u2019s not rebuilding something that was there; we have to start again.\u201d\n\nShe said her representative on Abaco told her that \u201cthere\u2019s a lot more dead\u201d and that the bodies were being gathered.\n\nHere are the aerial images of the overwhelming destruction on Great Abaco Island that just aired on @CNN.

We know what your conditions are. We know if you\u2019re stuck in an attic,\u201d Tammy Mitchell of the Bahamas\u2019 National Emergency Management Agency told ZNS Bahamas radio station.\n\nWith their heads bowed against heavy wind and rain, rescuers began evacuating people across Grand Bahama late Tuesday using jet skis, boats and even a huge bulldozer that cradled children and adults in its digger as it cut through deep muddy waters and carried them to safety.\n\nOne rescuer gently scooped up an elderly man in his arms and walked toward a pickup truck waiting to evacuate him and others to higher ground.\n\nPractically parking over a portion of the Bahamas for a day and a half, Dorian pounded the northern Abaco Islands and Grand Bahama with winds up to 185 mph and torrential rain before finally moving into open waters Tuesday on a course for Florida. Its winds were down to a still-dangerous 110 mph, making it a Category 2 storm.\n\nOver 2 million people along the coast in Florida, Georgia and North and South Carolina were warned to evacuate. While the threat of a direct hit on Florida had all but evaporated, Dorian was expected to pass dangerously close to Georgia and South Carolina \u2014 and perhaps strike North Carolina \u2014 on Thursday or Friday.\n\n#Dorian has picked up speed and is now moving NW at 6 mph. It is expected to move near or over the Carolinas sometime late Thursday.\n\n\n\nHurricane watches and warnings have been extended northward, and a tropical storm watch is now in effect for parts of coastal Virginia. pic.twitter.com/iKx2FY2JWu \u2014 The Weather Channel (@weatherchannel) September 3, 2019\n\nEven if landfall does not occur, the system is likely to cause storm surge and severe flooding, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tough it out. Get out,\u201d said U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency official Carlos Castillo.\n\nIn the Bahamas, Red Cross spokesman Matthew Cochrane said more than 13,000 houses, or about 45% of the homes on Grand Bahama and Abaco, were believed to have been severely damaged or destroyed. U.N. officials said more than 60,000 people on the hard-hit islands will need food, and the Red Cross said some 62,000 will need clean drinking water.\n\n\u201cWhat we are hearing lends credence to the fact that this has been a catastrophic storm and a catastrophic impact,\u201d Cochrane said.\n\nLawson Bates, a staffer for Arkansas-based MedicCorps, flew over Abaco and said: \u201cIt looks completely flattened. There\u2019s boats way inland that are flipped over. It\u2019s total devastation.\u201d\n\nThe Red Cross authorized a half-million dollars for the first wave of disaster relief, Cochrane said. And U.N. humanitarian teams stood ready to go into the stricken areas to help assess the damage and the country\u2019s needs, U.N. spokesman St\u00e9phane Dujarric said. The U.S. government also sent a disaster response team.\n\nAbaco and Grand Bahama islands, with a combined population of about 70,000, are known for their marinas, golf courses and all-inclusive resorts. To the south, the Bahamas\u2019 most populous island, New Providence, which includes the capital city, Nassau, and has over a quarter-million people, suffered little damage.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard airlifted at least 21 people injured on Abaco. Rescuers also used jet skis to reach some people as choppy, coffee-colored floodwaters reached roofs and the tops of palm trees.\n\n\u201cWe will confirm what the real situation is on the ground,\u201d Health Minister Duane Sands said. \u201cWe are hoping and praying that the loss of life is limited.\u201d\n\nSands said Dorian rendered the main hospital on Grand Bahama unusable, while the hospital in Marsh Harbor in Abaco was in need of food, water, medicine and surgical supplies. He said crews were trying to airlift five to seven kidney failure patients from Abaco who had not received dialysis since Friday.\n\nThe Grand Bahama airport was under 6 feet of water.\n\nAs of 5 p.m. EDT, Dorian was centered about 125 miles southeast of Cape Canaveral, Florida. It was moving northwest at 6 mph. Hurricane-force winds extended up to 52 miles from its center.\n\nThe coastline from north of West Palm Beach, Florida, through Georgia was expected to get 3 to 6 inches of rain, with 9 inches in places, while the Carolinas could get 5 to 10 inches and 15 in spots, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nNASA satellite imagery through Monday night showed some places in the Bahamas had gotten as much as 35 inches (89 centimeters) of rain, said private meteorologist Ryan Maue.\n\nParliament member Iram Lewis said he feared waters would keep rising and stranded people would lose contact with officials as their cellphone batteries died.\n\nDorian also left one person dead in its wake in Puerto Rico before slamming into the Bahamas on Sunday. It tied the record for the strongest Atlantic storm ever to hit land, matching the Labor Day hurricane that struck Florida Gulf Coast in 1935, before storms were given names.\n\nScientists say that climate change generally has been fueling more powerful and wetter storms but that linking any specific hurricane to global warming would require more detailed study.\n\nAcross the Southeast, meanwhile, interstate highways leading away from the beach in South Carolina and Georgia were turned into one-way evacuation routes. Several airports announced closings, and hundreds of flights were canceled. Walt Disney World in Orlando closed in the afternoon, and SeaWorld shut down.\n\nPolice in coastal Savannah, Georgia, announced an overnight curfew. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper ordered a mandatory evacuation of the dangerously exposed barrier islands along the state\u2019s entire coast.\n\nHaving seen storms swamp his home on the Georgia coast in 2016 and 2017, Joey Spalding of Tybee Island decided to empty his house and stay at a friend\u2019s apartment nearby rather than take any chances with Dorian.\n\nHe packed a U-Haul truck with tables, chairs, a chest of drawers, tools \u2014 virtually all of his furnishings except for his mattress and a large TV \u2014 and planned to park it on higher ground. He also planned to shroud his house in plastic wrap up to shoulder height and pile sandbags in front of the doors.\n\n\u201cIn this case, I don\u2019t have to come into a house full of junk,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m learning a little as I go.\u201d\n\nIn Folly Beach, South Carolina, many restaurants and shops wasted no time in boarding up, but some hurricane-hardened residents had yet to decide whether to heed the evacuation order.\n\n\u201cIf it comes, it comes. You know, God always provides, y\u2019all,\u201d Sammye Wooded said.", "description": "Relief officials reported scenes of utter ruin Tuesday in parts of the Bahamas and rushed to deal with an unfolding humanitarian crisis in the wake of...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ612_bahama_ZG_20190903191540.jpg"}
