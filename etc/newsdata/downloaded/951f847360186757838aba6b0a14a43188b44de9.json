He was relentlessly attacked over accusations that he had bullied his former justice minister, an indigenous woman, and his image was tainted by the publication of old photos of him dressing up as racist caricatures.\n\nBut the loss of the majority he won in 2015, a chastening result, shows that he personally, and not just his liberal platform, is divisive, with much of his support emanating from urban areas. His Liberals did not win a majority and he will have to govern with the support of smaller parties.\n\nThe Conservatives and their leader Andrew Scheer, a career politician who is anti-abortion and has made disparaging comments about same-sex marriage, were disproportionately backed by voters in Canada's western prairie provinces. AP\n\nMany educated eastern urban inhabitants have delighted in Trudeau's public persona of feel-good progressivism and his talent for projecting a positive image of Canada on the global stage. But he is a hated figure among many western conservatives who view him as sanctimonious and trying to impose public morality.\n\n\"The two Canadas are now eyeing each other from cliffs on opposite sides, and they've got very little common ground on the key issues,\" said Frank Graves, the president of Ekos Research, a polling firm in Ottawa.\n\nFew issues demonstrated the regional rift more starkly than that of climate change, which galvanised voters.\n\nTrudeau, intent on burnishing his environmental credentials, introduced a national carbon tax in his first term. In a bid to satisfy voters in oil-rich Alberta, though, he also spent billions in government money to expand an oil pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Coast.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut in the end, that did him little good politically. His party was wiped out in Alberta and Saskatchewan, where the conservatives' anti-carbon tax platform resonated and he lost support in British Columbia where the pipeline expansion met fierce opposition.\n\nAndrea Perrella, a professor of political science at Wilfred Laurier University in Waterloo, Ontario, said Canada's regional divisions were mostly based on practical concerns rather than ideology.\n\n\"It's not that people move to Fort McMurray because they like the oil and gas industry and they believe that climate change is a hoax; you move there for work,\" he said of the Alberta town in the heart of the oil sands. \"If you took the oil and gas industry and plunked it down in downtown Montreal, people there would support it.\"\n\nThe regionalism of the election was especially prominent in Quebec, a majority French-speaking province where the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, an expressly regional party that support's Quebec's sovereignty, won a remarkable 32 seats.\n\nOnly months ago, the party was in shambles. But its leader, Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet, staged a dramatic rebound by tapping into identity politics and pledging to uphold the rights of Quebecers and the French language in Ottawa.\n\nDuring the political campaign, Blanchet railed against interference from the federal government in Quebec's affairs, and warned it not to challenge a contentious Quebec law that bans judges, teachers and police officers from wearing religious symbols like headscarves and turbans while at work.\n\nThe law has infuriated advocates of human rights elsewhere in the country, including Trudeau, who has signalled he could challenge it in court.\n\nYet the election also showed that unlike in other countries, anti-immigrant populism has limited appeal as a national platform in Canada, a vast and sparsely populated country that has relied on immigration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe election's biggest loser was Maxime Bernier, a populist leader who embraces his nickname \"Mad Max\" and has pushed against immigration and what he calls \"extreme multiculturalism\" and \"climate change hysteria\". His People's Party was shut out of Parliament with not a single candidate, including Bernier, winning a seat.\n\nDespite the evident divisions in the electorate, and Trudeau's victory by the slimmest of margins, experts saw the night as a win for him.\n\n\"A victory is a victory,\" said Jean-Marc L\u00e9ger, the chief executive of the Montreal-based L\u00e9ger polling firm.\n\n\"His brand has been dented,\" he said. But he added, \"Canadians wanted to teach him a lesson, but they also wanted him back.\"\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "Canada is often viewed as a model of harmony.
