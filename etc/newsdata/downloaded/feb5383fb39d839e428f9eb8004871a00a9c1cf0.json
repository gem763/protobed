Placing money into something you believe in and expect a return from.\u201d\n\n\u201cGambling\u201d is defined this way: \u201cTo play games of chance for money. To take risk in order to gain advantage.\u201d\n\nWhat is the difference between gambling and investing?\n\nFirst, we must realize that anything can be a gamble. Some, taking the concept of gambling to an extreme, would say that getting out of bed in the morning is a gamble. To be practical, let us use a common belief that gambling is the taking of a risk to obtain a quick gain. Though on the surface, this definition seems as though it could easily fit investing, and without a doubt the stock market could and often is misused and gambled with, there are significant differences between the two. To understand the distinction, we need to look at the main characteristics of each.\n\nFirst, gambling has no social value. The act of gambling is a selfish act. It is about winning for one\u2019s self. Whereas investing actually has social value. The concept of investing itself is a social act. One person puts up money so another person can start, expand, and run a business. The business then utilizes the capital investment to produce goods or services for the community. In turn, the community uses these products for its betterment. It is investment dollars that make our economy so vibrant.\n\nSecondly, with gambling, someone has to suffer loss for someone else to win, whereas with an investment, no one has to lose, and all can gain. To illustrate this point, let\u2019s say I buy XYZ stock at $10 a share and the company does well. My stock is now worth $20 a share. I sell the stock to another person who holds onto the stock as the company continues to grow and the value increases to $30 a share. Everybody wins. The company that offered the stock originally received the capital it needed to become a profitable, successful business. I win, in as much as I doubled my money before selling, and the person who purchased my stock won by the increasing value of the stock purchased.\n\nNow, I don\u2019t want to assert that stocks always appreciate in price. On the contrary, many businesses do not produce desired products for consumption or don\u2019t manage their business well. This leads to investors selling off their ownership in the company and the value of the company declining. Yet even in decline, someone\u2019s loss is not someone else\u2019s gain. Because purchasing stock is purchasing ownership, you participate with other owners in the gain or loss of the company\u2019s value. It has nothing to do with someone gaining by someone losing or vice versa.\n\nA quick illustration may be beneficial here:\n\nSuppose I start a chocolate store, but I don\u2019t have enough money to purchase all the fixtures and inventory I need. So I ask my brother to invest in my business and he agrees. In exchange for his money, I give him 50% of my company that is represented by the stock certificates. If I manage, market and sell well, we will both realize the benefits and eventually, if the business is sold, it would be sold for substantially more than we each individually invested. If I manage the store poorly and I am unable to keep the doors open, we both lose everything we put in. Our gain is not at someone else\u2019s expense, nor is our loss due to someone else\u2019s gain.\n\nFrom a biblical perspective, consider I Thessalonians 5:15:\n\n\u201cSee that no one repays anyone evil for evil, but always seek to do good to one another and to everyone\u201d (ESV).\n\nWhen is investing gambling?\n\nInvesting is gambling when we treat the stock market as a casino. A prudent investor will either:\n\nResearch the companies in which he is interested in having ownership, or; Hire someone to do the research for him. This information could include company finances, management information, fundamental and technical analysis, what products and/or services the company offers and the impact the company has on people\u2014all with the goal of finding a company that the investor believes has strong financial fundamentals and high possibilities of being profitable and successful, while also being representative of their personal values.\n\nWhen a company matches those criteria, we are willing to purchase ownership in said company through the purchase of stock. Then careful, ongoing review of the research criteria helps us decide when we no longer believe the company is on the right track or does not have the potential to grow as we would prefer, so we sell the stock.\n\nThere are some people, however, who hear of a stock rising in price and bet the stock will continue to do so, with no research or diligence, no understanding about the company or its products or services, no management or financials, and definitely no concern regarding the company\u2019s impact on people or the values they represent. Instead, they may just purchase the stock in the hopes it will continue to go up. There is no difference here than betting on anything else. It is nothing more than a bet\u2014not an investment but a get-rich-quick scheme.\n\nI conclude with this wisdom from Proverbs 28:20:", "description": "\u201cInvesting\u201d is defined by Webster as: \u201cTo put money into .09/02/2019 3:11:26AM EST.", "authors": ["Mark", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/48/f16002d7-6db1-4b7b-887b-fae5712665b4.jpg"}
