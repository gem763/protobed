But Democrats also saw worrying trends of their own on Tuesday, as their candidate Dan McCready benefitted from a surge in metropolitan support that would have brought them victory \u2014 if not for an even stronger swell in rural support for Bishop and the GOP.\n\nIn short, Tuesday\u2019s results outlined the path to 2020 victory for both parties, cut along the fundamental trend of politics in the Trump era: cities and suburbs swinging more and more Democratic, while the president\u2019s appeal brings exurbs and rural voters deeper into the GOP fold. Trump pushed harder on one side of the scale to win in 2016; Democrats pushed back on the other side to take the House last year. And next year, it will decide whether Trump gets another term or a Democrat takes the White House for four years.\n\nTrump\u2019s election-eve rally for Bishop brought thousands to Fayetteville on Monday night on the eastern edge of the district, and it\u2019s hard to argue with results: McCready had carried the surrounding county, Cumberland County, by more than 4 percentage points last year. But Bishop won it by the narrowest of margins on Tuesday, also making improvements in neighboring counties far from the Charlotte suburbs where McCready was strongest.\n\nCOUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now.

Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.), the chairwoman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee noted that there are nearly three dozen GOP-held House seats that are less Republican-leaning than North Carolina\u2019s 9th District.\n\n\u201cWe fell an inch short tonight, but it took more than $6 million in outside Republican spending and a last-minute Trump rally to scrape by in a district that the president carried by 11.9 points,\u201d Bustos said.\n\nDejected supporters for Dan McCready react Tuesday night after he lost a special election for Congress in North Carolina\u2019s 9th District. | Kathy Kmonicek/AP Photo\n\nDemocrats did increase their margins in and around Charlotte in the election, but they were swamped by Bishop\u2019s stronger performance east of the city. McCready won Mecklenburg County, which includes parts of Charlotte and its southern suburbs, 56 percent to 43 percent, up from a 10-point in 2018. Those are some of the same trends that led the party to lose Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin in the 2016 presidential race, even if stronger numbers in metropolitan areas can put new states on the map for the party.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t connect with rural voters \u2014 if we don\u2019t show up in 2020 and win these places back \u2014 then Trump wins,\u201d Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, tweeted late Tuesday night.\n\nKellyanne Conway, the former GOP campaign pollster working as a counselor to Trump in the White House, touted Trump as the difference-marker, boosting \u201centhusiasm, optimism and turnout\u201d for Bishop with Monday night\u2019s rally.\n\n\u201cThe haters waste so much time trying to insult and impede the president that they fail to grasp the political currency he conveys in tight races like this,\u201d said Conway.\n\nThe president took even more credit for Bishop\u2019s win, writing in a victory lap on Twitter that Bishop was trailing and \u201casked me for help, [and] we changed his strategy together, and he ran a great race.\u201d\n\nBishop\u2019s embrace of the president \u2014 in the closing days of the campaign, he repeatedly decried the treatment Trump had received from Democrats and the news media and said he would go to Congress as a vocal Trump defender \u2014 also serves as a playbook for other Republicans.\n\n\u201cRepublicans should be watching: Run with the president and win,\u201d Conway said.\n\nThat could include vulnerable incumbents like GOP Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who is facing a spirited primary race from a self-funding opponent accusing him of insufficient loyalty to Trump, in addition to the challenge of seeking reelection in a swing state.\n\nRepublicans were quick to trumpet the success of their coordinated effort \u2014 from last-minute visits from Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, all the way down to the congressional leaders and the constellation of official and outside groups and super PACs \u2014 in pushing Bishop across the finish line.\n\nThat may not be replicable in November 2020 all the way down the ballot. But Trump\u2019s robust campaign operation \u2014 which he continues to build as Democrats fight for their party\u2019s nomination \u2014 will be formidable, despite the president\u2019s low political standing compared to past incumbents.\n\n\u201cThe White House, Republican leadership and all our Republican and conservative partners were there for us every step of the way because they all understood what was at stake in this election,\u201d Bishop said in his victory speech Tuesday night.\n\nFor McCready, who campaigned for this House seat for 27 months \u2014 launching a campaign in 2017, suffering an apparent defeat in 2018 only to run again in 2019 when the previous election was voided amid credible allegations of ballot fraud \u2014 he sounded some of the same bipartisan notes that twice brought him close to winning a congressional seat Democrats haven\u2019t held since the 1960s.\n\n\u201cWe may not have won this campaign, but that does not mean we were wrong,\u201d McCready said in his concession speech. \u201cAnd as long as there are people who thrive off our division, there is still work to be done.\u201d", "description": "Republicans held onto a district Trump carried by 12 points in 2016, while Democrats' sagging rural performance also drew notice.", "authors": ["Steven Shepard", "Laura Barr\u00f3n-L\u00f3pez", "Alex Isenstadt"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/94/06/d6cbec574631963823c247e5f550/webp.net-resizeimage%20(17).jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
