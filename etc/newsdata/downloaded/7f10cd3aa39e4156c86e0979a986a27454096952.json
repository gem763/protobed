He did not identify the officer, who was \u201crelieved of all enforcement duties,\u201d or the driver.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of full transparency to our community \u2014 our police officer violated our long-standing policy and deprived a person of their freedom, which is unacceptable,\u201d Mr Roessler said.\n\n\u201cOur county is one of the most diverse counties in the nation and no one should have the perception that FCPD is acting as a civil immigration agent for ICE,\u201d the chief said, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. \u201cThis matter damages our reputation and the long-standing policy that I have stated many times, that our officers shall not act as immigration agents.\u201d\n\nThe episode took place on the afternoon of 21 September when a Fairfax County police officer was handling a traffic accident in the Groveton community, south of the city of Alexandria, the chief\u2019s statement said.\n\nThe officer found that one of the drivers involved in the accident did not have a Virginia driver\u2019s license, and conducted a check to verify the person\u2019s Department of Motor Vehicles record, the statement said.\n\nIn doing so, the officer received a notification from ICE that the driver was wanted on an administrative violation warrant for failing to appear for a deportation hearing.\n\nThe officer then contacted the ICE agent listed on the warrant, gave the driver a summons for not having a license, and after the person signed the summons, the officer detained the person, the police statement said. The officer then turned over custody of the driver to the ICE agent at the location of the accident.\n\nRead more\n\nUS using Google Translate to process social media posts of refugees\n\nMr Roessler said the department\u2019s arrest policy since 2007 and its training had been \u201cvery clear\u201d that personnel do not enforce administrative warrants or take people into custody for them. He said that the driver was released from ICE custody after three hours and issued an ankle monitor.\n\nThe chief did not provide the length of the officer\u2019s service. He said in an interview on Wednesday that he learned of the interaction through an email to his account, and that after the investigation, it was likely the officer would be back on patrol duties by Friday.\n\nHe said that the officers in the department do not have the right to enforce civil matters, which can range from administrative warrants to evictions.\n\n\u201cOnce the person signs the summons, they are free to leave,\u201d the chief said. \u201cThe engagement should have been over.\u201d\n\nMr Roessler said that the officer\u2019s administrative leave with pay required remedial training.", "description": "A police officer has been taken off patrol duty after turning over a driver who was involved in a traffic accident to immigration authorities, an official said.Chief Edwin Roessler of the Fairfax County Police Department in Northern Virginia said that he had ordered an investigation into the episode,", "authors": ["Christine Hauser"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/N.wKWgkW4tDRivcrRYpxew--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/aaeb984512afa111e9e439c181641d6b", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
