We are asking them to make additional efforts,\" a French official said. \"Negotiation cannot be opened in October 2019, we will need to reassess the situation somewhere in 2020.\"\n\nUnanimity among the 28 member states is required to launch accession talks.\n\nEU ministers will discuss the matter again in Luxembourg on Tuesday before national leaders meet in Brussels for a summit on Oct.17-18. The move was already delayed repeatedly.\n\n\"This is very frustrating for most of the member states. Our credibility is at stake,\" said a diplomat from a country willing to open the doors to the Western Balkan candidates.\n\n\"North Macedonia and Albania have done a lot. Yes, a lot more remains to be done but opening membership talks is just the first step, the process would take years and they would have to fulfil all the criteria before they are allowed in.\"\n\nSources said the Netherlands and Denmark were also clearly opposed to Albania's bid when EU ambassadors discussed the matter behind closed doors in Brussels on Thursday, though the Dutch have signalled potential flexibility on North Macedonia.\n\nDutch Foreign Minister Stef Blok said on Tuesday Skopje needed to pass legislation to set up an independent public prosecution body. \"For the Netherlands that would have to pass in order to open accession talks,\" he said.
