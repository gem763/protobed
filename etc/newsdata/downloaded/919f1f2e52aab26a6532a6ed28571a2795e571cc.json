Adam Schiff, House intel panel to hear from whistleblower 'very soon'", "language": "en", "text": "House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said Sunday the committee is moving forward with its impeachment inquiry into President Trump and will hear from the inspector general again this week, as well as five State Department officials.\n\nHe also said he is negotiating with the whistleblower\u2019s attorneys so the committee can hear directly from the analyst who accused the president of pressuring a foreign government to probe his potential 2020 rival, Joseph R. Biden.\n\n\u201cThat whistleblower will be allowed to come in,\u201d Mr. Schiff told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will get the unfiltered testimony of that whistleblower,\u201d the California Democrat added.\n\nThe comments come after the inspector general met with lawmakers in a session last week to discuss the whistleblower\u2019s complaint.\n\n\u201cWe are moving forward with all speed,\u201d Mr. Schiff said.\n\nHe said the committee has requested depositions from five State Department officials for this week, including from former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie L. Yovanovitch.\n\nThe whistleblower complaint led to the publication of the transcript of Mr. Trump\u2019s phone call in July with the Ukrainian president.\n\nIt\u2019s been the subject of an impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump, formally launched last week by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. House Democrats assert that the Mr. Trump was pressuring a foreign government to investigate his political rival.\n\nRep. Hakeem Jeffries, New York Democrat, told CNN that the House is pursuing an impeachment inquiry because the president allegedly withheld more than $300 million in financial aid from Ukraine and asked that country\u2019s president to look into Mr. Biden and his son over a $50,000-per-month payment in connection with a Ukrainian energy company.\n\n\u201cThe president has abused his power,\u201d Mr. Jeffries said of Mr. Trump.\n\nThe White House, though, made public the conversation between Mr. Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, arguing that the aid was not used to pressure the foreign leader.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, Ohio Republican, said the transcript doesn\u2019t show a quid pro quo.\n\n\u201cThe transcript gives you no reason to impeach this president,\u201d Mr. Jordan told CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d\n\nInstead, Republicans have asserted there was wrongdoing on behalf of the Bidens \u2014 not Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Jordan charged that Mr. Biden tried to stop an investigation into his son and the energy company by demanding a Ukrainian prosecutor be fired.\n\nThe president\u2019s personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani told ABC that he discovered the Bidens\u2019 actions with Ukraine while he was probing former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign and its contacts with foreign governments during the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cThe Washington press will not accept the fact that Joe Biden may have done something like this,\u201d Mr. Jordan said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
