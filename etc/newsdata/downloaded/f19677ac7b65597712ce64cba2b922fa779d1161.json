REUTERS/Marco Bello\n\nThe most powerful hurricane on record to hit the Bahamas swept through the islands earlier this week, leveling some neighborhoods, swallowing others with storm surge, and causing what one official described as a \u201cstaggering\u201d number of deaths.\n\nHundreds, if not thousands, are still missing in the country of about 400,000 people, and the official death toll, which to the bemusement of some survivors stands at only 30, is likely to soar as more bodies are discovered in the ruins and floodwaters left behind by the storm.\n\nIn Freeport, witnesses said thousands crowded the port to try to get on a Bahamas Paradise Cruise Line ship offering free passage to Florida to those with necessary U.S. immigration documentation.\n\nDazed evacuees, some with nothing but the clothes on their backs and plastic shopping bags, sat in the Kendal G. L. Isaacs National Gymnasium in Nassau which has been turned into a shelter.\n\n\u201cNobody can help anybody in Abaco, there\u2019s no place safe, everything is destroyed,\u201d said Firstina Swain, 75, who said she lost her home. \u201cThe people of Abaco need to get out, there are too many dead bodies, and I don\u2019t think they finished finding them.\u201d\n\nA boat with 250 evacuees left battered Abaco and arrived in Nassau, the capital of the Bahamas, which is located on New Providence island to the west and was less affected. Another boat with hundreds aboard was on its way, National Voice of the Bahamas radio reported.\n\nApproximately 200 people were also evacuated from Abaco Friday on Bahamasair flights, according to a NEMA spokesperson who declined to be named.\n\n\u201cFree air evacuations on Bahamasair from Abaco started (Thursday) and will continue until all Grand Bahama and Abaco residents who want to leave are off the islands,\u201d Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said in a tweet.\n\nFour survivors told Reuters on Thursday they had been charged $75 for a seat on a Bahamasair flight from Abaco to Nassau. \u201cI thought a relief flight would be free,\u201d said Anthony Thompson, 27, who said he paid the fare for himself, his wife and his sister. \u201cI thought wrong.\u201d\n\nA Bahamasair official, who requested anonymity, told Reuters the airline was collecting its customers whose flights had been canceled during the hurricane. To the extent extra seats were available, it was offering to ferry others off Abaco \u201cat cost,\u201d the official said.\n\n\u2018STAGGERING\u2019 DEATH TOLL\n\nBahamas Health Minister Duane Sands said there had been \u201ca tremendous loss of life\u201d in Abaco\u2019s main city of Marsh Harbor.\n\nThe medical chief of staff at Princess Margaret Hospital in Nassau said two refrigerated, 40-foot trucks would be needed to hold the \u201cstaggering\u201d number of bodies that were expected to be found. \u201cWe\u2019ve ordered lots of body bags,\u201d said Dr. Caroline Burnett-Garraway.\n\nThose injured by the storm, which at one point was a Category 5 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale of intensity, were treated for fractures, head injuries, lacerations, skin rashes and dehydration.\n\nNear an area called The Mudd in Marsh Harbour, the commercial hub, a Reuters witness described a devastating scene, with most houses leveled, a man lying dead near a main street and dead dogs in water. Some residents were leaving the area with meager possessions, while others were determined to remain.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard, working with NEMA, has rescued 295 people since Dorian began, the U.S. embassy in Nassau tweeted.\n\nRelief groups are focusing on getting doctors, nurses and medical supplies into the hardest-hit areas and helping survivors get food and safe drinking water.\n\nThe relief effort faces formidable logistical challenges because of the widespread destruction caused by Dorian, which hovered over the Bahamas for nearly two days with torrential rains and fierce winds that whipped up 12- to 18-foot (3.7- to 5.5-meter) storm surges.\n\nThe risk of outbreaks of diarrhea and waterborne diseases is high because drinking water may be contaminated with sewage, according to the Pan American Health Organization, which described the situation for some people on Abaco as \u201cdesperate.\u201d\n\nThe United Nations estimated 70,000 people were in \u201cimmediate need of life-saving assistance\u201d such as food, water and shelter. The U.N. World Food Programme is airlifting storage units, generators, prefab offices, and satellite equipment as well as 8 metric tonnes of ready-to-eat meals.\n\nWIDESPREAD LOOTING\n\nA Reuters witness saw widespread looting on Abaco, with people breaking into supermarkets and liquor stores.\n\nWendy Hawkes, whose home on Abaco was largely destroyed, described seeing neighbors standing outside their front doors with shotguns to ward off looters.\n\nClaudin Loriston, 39, said he and his three young children were among the \u201clucky ones\u201d to get on a plane out of Abaco. He said he had no documents with him, but he would try to get a job to support his family.\n\n\u201cThere are too many dead bodies there,\u201d said the Haitian carpenter. \u201cThe government needs to remove everyone from the island, the smell is everywhere, it\u2019s in the water.\u201d", "description": "Hundreds of people fled the Bahamas island of Great Abaco by boat and plane on Friday and thousands more lined up to get on a cruise ship leaving neighboring Grand Bahama to escape the catastrophic aftermath of Hurricane Dorian.", "authors": ["Nick Brown", "Zachary Fagenson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1427061434&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF851IC-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
