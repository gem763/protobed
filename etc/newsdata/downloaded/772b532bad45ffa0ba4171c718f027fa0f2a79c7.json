First we built a human connection and then as a player and then I know I can ask him what I want and what the team needs - he always listens and will always give his best to provide that.\n\n\"He will play all minutes, some minutes, all games if we ask that of him and he is always ready to play again - this is also showing his leadership qualities.\"\n\nIn addition to netting the winner in last month's win over Villa, Emery said he was also impressed by Aubameyang's decision to let Nicolas Pepe take a penalty earlier in the game.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nIt allowed the Frenchman to score his first goal since his big-money move from Lille this summer and the Gunners boss feels it perfectly highlighted the impressive attitude of his vice-captain.\n\n\"I told him when he decided against Aston Villa when we were losing to give the penalty to Pepe for his confidence, it was an amazing decision,\" added Emery.\n\n\"It showed him as a big player with big responsibility in this team, a captain of this team. He gave that responsibility to Pepe and in that moment it was a great moment between two big players - a very good connection.\n\n\"In the the dressing room and in the matches, that connection with Pepe, also with (Alexandre) Lacazette, it means Aubameyang is important to make these positive connections.\"", "description": "The striker was recently appointed the Gunners' vice-captain after a blind vote by his team-mates", "authors": ["Hassan Rashed", "Image", "Reuters Hannah Mckay", "Reuters", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20484128.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Premier-League-Arsenal-v-Aston-Villa.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
