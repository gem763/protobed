Local news website HK01 had similar reports.\n\nThat speculation sparked jubilation on the stock market which has been battered by both China's trade war with the United States and Beijing's refusal to find a political solution to the weeks of protests in the international financial hub.\n\nShares leapt on the news with companies like HSBC rising 3.4 percent and troubled airliner Cathay Pacific soaring nearly nine percent.\n\nThe city's hugely influential property sector also saw massive gains with the HSI Property Index jumping more than six percent after the reports.", "description": "Hong Kong's stock market soared Wednesday after local media reported that the city's embattled leader is planning to fully withdraw a loathed extradition bill, one of the main demands of pro-democracy protesters.
