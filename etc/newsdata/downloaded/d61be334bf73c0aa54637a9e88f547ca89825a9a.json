But the company can see a time in the near future when its revenue from legal sports betting will surpass its core fantasy sports products.\n\nThe demand for sports betting, FanDuel CEO Matt King says, \u201cis growing like a rocket ship.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court struck down PASPA, the federal ban on sports betting, in May 2018, which allowed states to legalize sports betting on a state-by-state basis. A number of states moved quickly to do so, and FanDuel moved quickly as well.\n\nThat month, FanDuel sold to Irish bookmaker Paddy Power Betfair, which later rebranded this year to Flutter Entertainment.\n\nThen in July 2018, FanDuel opened up a sportsbook at Meadowlands Racetrack in New Jersey, and soon opened five more in the last year. The company now has physical sportsbook locations in New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Indiana, and Iowa, and offers legal mobile betting in three of those states: New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia, with Indiana coming online soon.\n\nLegal wagers placed in New Jersey surpassed those placed in Nevada in May ($318.9 million in New Jersey vs. $317.4 million in Nevada), which was taken as a major milestone. FanDuel says it has more than 50% market share in New Jersey.\n\nIn other words, FanDuel\u2019s betting business is flying.\n\nThat is somewhat ironic after the two-year-long saga in 2015 and 2016, when FanDuel and its rival DraftKings faced numerous legal challenges from state attorneys general (spearheaded by former New York A.G. Eric Schneiderman) accusing them of being gambling operators\u2014before SCOTUS lifted the sports betting ban. FanDuel and DraftKings at the time insisted their fantasy games were not a form of gambling. They also announced a merger, then called their merger off.\n\nNow both companies have fully embraced legal gambling.\n\n\u201cThe nice thing about sports betting is it frankly appeals to a very wide demographic, because it\u2019s a more casual product,\u201d King says. \u201cIt\u2019s something people were doing illegally for years and years, and this is an opportunity to do it legally.\u201d\n\nSo: What\u2019s next?\n\nMatt King, chief executive officer for FanDuel Group speaks during a news conference before Meadowlands Racetrack open its doors to sports betting, Saturday, July 14, 2018, in East Rutherford, N.J. Meadowlands Racetrack started taking sports betting on Saturday, becoming the fourth sports betting outlet in New Jersey following the state's U.S. Supreme Court victory in a case that cleared the way for all 50 states to legalize sports betting.

Nigel Eccles, his wife Lesley Eccles, and three others co-founded FanDuel in 2009 as a rebrand of Hubdub, which was a political prediction site.\n\nWith the 2020 election approaching, Yahoo Finance asked King if FanDuel might like to get back into political fantasy and betting.\n\n\u201cWe would love to offer politics,\u201d King says. \u201cFrankly, we like to offer games that everybody loves to play. Our parent company, Flutter Entertainment, does a huge business on the Betfair exchange with political betting. So the reality is it\u2019s just a question of: Will it be allowed from a regulatory perspective? We are working on a couple things that might be more free to play, but will certainly tie into the election.\u201d\n\nFor now, political gambling is basically banned across the U.S. (New Zealand-based prediction site PredictIt gets you close to the real thing, offering $1 \u201cshares\u201d in 2020 candidates thanks to a CFTC exemption.)\n\nAs for the continued tide of state-by-state sports betting legalization, King predicts it will keep rolling\u2014but he doesn\u2019t expect to ever see full national legalization.\n\n\u201cOur perspective is you\u2019re going to see a big chunk of the U.S. legalize it, and legalize mobile,\u201d he says. \u201cState legislatures, as they get educated on the issue, understand that if they want to generate the tax revenue, and if they want to put the illegal market out of business, they have to have a competitive mobile marketplace.\u201d\n\nBut how many states will legalize, and how fast? That, King says, is \u201cthe multibillion-dollar question.\u201d", "description": "FanDuel now offers legal sports betting in six states, and says demand is \"growing like a rocket ship.\"", "authors": ["Daniel Roberts", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/DePyfnKyMwOpecGLhPzwFQ--~B/aD0zMjI0O3c9NDgzNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/ac4d5c00-d0c0-11e9-beff-399609a99d8f", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
