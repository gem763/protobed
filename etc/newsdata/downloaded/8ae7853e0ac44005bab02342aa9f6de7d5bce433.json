A few storms are passing the Manassas area and to the south/west of there. Other than that, and some storms in northern Md., there\u2019s not much going on. Places well south and southwest of the city still run the risk of a passing storm, and a quick shower is possible elsewhere. Most folks should stay dry into the night. See below for the forecast through tomorrow!\n\nFrom 3:15 p.m... Earlier storm updates at bottom...\n\nThe last day of summer (unofficially) felt rather summerlike. High humidity and temperatures well into the 80s have fueled a storm risk that will be with us through the evening. A few of these storms could be intense, mainly when it comes to heavy rain, but an isolated damaging wind gust isn\u2019t impossible.\n\nListen to our daily D.C. forecasts: Apple Podcasts | Amazon Echo | More options\n\nThrough tonight: Scattered strong storms are a risk from late afternoon through the evening. The main shower and storm threat should tend to wane with sunset, but we\u2019re not totally out of the woods till perhaps about 10 p.m. to midnight or so, especially south and east. After that, it\u2019s partly cloudy, with maybe some patchy fog in places it rains. Lows range from the mid-60s to the low 70s.\n\nView the current weather at The Washington Post.\n\nTomorrow (Tuesday): Some thicker cloudiness may linger into the morning \u2014 otherwise we\u2019re partly sunny or sunnier for most of the day. Humidity is down a bit from today, but still moderate. Afternoon temperatures head for the mid-80s in most spots. Winds are variable and mainly out of the east and northeast.\n\n\n\nThe House of the Temple on 16th Street NW as storm clouds blow by overhead.

The main severe weather threat is the potential for damaging winds, in addition to the general storm threats of heavy rain and frequent lightning. While this is the most intense activity in the area, additional showers and storms are still possible after it passes. Some are moving through the Middleburg area in western suburbs and a couple more may move in from the northwest this evening. Storms should tend to wane with sunset, but a few could last into the night before ending.\n\nSevere Thunderstorm Warning including Lake Ridge VA, Burke VA, Marumsco VA until 7:00 PM EDT pic.twitter.com/ATFSRxaJ6O \u2014 NWS DC/Baltimore (@NWS_BaltWash) September 2, 2019\n\n5:00 p.m. update: Scattered storms are marching across the area as we head into evening. A severe storm warning is up for parts of Loudoun, Fairfax, Fauquier, and Prince William counties until 5:30 p.m. This storm has produced some wind damage already and may continue to do so.
