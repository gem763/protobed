The existing caravan site that provides their accommodation was granted a planning permission last year.\"\n\nMr Hurst went on to describe the small building currently on site.\n\nIt measures just 4.2 metres by five metres, has a small kitchenette, a single toilet and a shower to service the three pitch caravan site.\n\n\u201cThe building would be extended so that in addition to the existing kitchenette there would be an additional toilet and shower taking site total to two toilets and two showers and one separate \u2018day room\u2019,\" he continued.\n\n\u201cThe day room would be available to all site occupants and, in particular, provide the children with space to study or be active when they can not be outside.\n\n\u201cThe caravan site provides a settled base for the travelling families to return to in relation to their nomadic way of life.\n\n\"When the families cease using the site it is a condition of the planning permission that the utility building shall be removed.\n\n\"If the building were extended permission for a new larger building could be subject to a very similar condition that requires it to be removed when it is no longer needed.\u201d\n\n(Image: StokeOnTrentLive/ WS)\n\nStanding in the way of the Price family and their new washing and cooking facilities was Checkley Parish Council.\n\nIn a searing statement criticising the proposal, parish clerk Si\u00e2n Morgan-Owen summarised the council's \"strong objections\".\n\n\"The Parish Council would like to point out that if the extension is more than twice the size of the original building then surely it is no longer an 'extension!' she wrote.\n\n\"The fact that an extension has been requested implies that the travellers who occupy this site are no longer travellers but settlers which means the site is no longer being used for its intended purpose.\n\n\"The Parish Council also has concerns regarding the visual impact this much larger structure will have on the area and those living in close proximity.\"\n\nDespite the parish council's attempts to block the build, the application was unanimously approved by district councillors.\n\nSpeaking to the planning committee, the applicant\u2019s agent Roger Yarwood, said: \u201cThis is a fair report which sums up the situation. This is for a growing family\u2019s needs. The council has been very fair.\u201d", "description": "The Price family can now extend their wash facilities at home on Olive Tree Park in Cheadle, Staffordshire", "authors": ["Hayley Parker", "Milo Boyd", "Image", "Stokeontrentlive", "Ws"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20754733.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Family-of-13-gypsies-using-one-tiny-toilet-can-now-build-a-bigger-shower-block-and-childrens-play-r.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
