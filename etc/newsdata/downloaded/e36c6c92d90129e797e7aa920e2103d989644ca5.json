Ben Rushton\n\nThese are difficult days indeed for those in the white vinyl sofa business. Listed furniture empire Nick Scali flagged a flat FY20 outlook all the way back on August 8. But you'd have to wonder if KUKA, the company's long-term manufacturer, but then also the company's largest shareholder, had a better read than most on how significantly Nick Scali's trading conditions had deteriorated.\n\nIn early September, UBS helped the Shanghai-based KUKA block-trade out of the ASX-listed retailer. KUKA accepted $6.85 a share for the 13 per cent stake it had paid Anthony Scali $7 a pop for only 20 months earlier.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, Nick Scali surprised the market with a gruesome trading update, citing store traffic down 10 to 15 per cent and like-for-like sales off 8 per cent in the three months to September 30. Profit guidance for the current half was downgraded 28 per cent. From a macro viewpoint, it's scary stuff.\n\nScali's shares traded as low as $5.67 shortly after noon on Tuesday, and closed down 13.8 per cent to $6.21. Which is 9.3 per cent below the price KUKA secured for its flip last month, and 11.3 per cent south of the Scali family's take for the same parcel of stock in March 2018.\n\nThose institutions raising their stakes as KUKA got out, and thus now sitting on precipitous paper losses, include Perpetual (specifically the small-cap fund run by Jack Collopy) and John Sevior's Magellan-owned Airlie Funds Management.", "description": "You have to wonder if KUKA had a better read than most on how significantly Nick Scali's trading conditions had deteriorated.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_551%2C$y_9/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d66b5b1d1ca665bcecce43b334b276f7684d6c4d", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
