REUTERS/Dimitar Kyosemarliev\n\nJock Palfreeman has served 11 years of a 20 year sentence since being found guilty of murder and attempted murder in the stabbing of two Bulgarian youths, one of whom died, during a street melee in 2007.\n\nThe 32-year-old, who was serving in the British army at the time of the incident, has said he acted in self defence and was trying to protect Roma being attacked by the Bulgarians.\n\nLast month he was granted parole by a panel of three judges. However, Bulgaria\u2019s Chief Prosecutor Sotir Tsatsarov made an application to the country\u2019s highest court to have his parole revoked, arguing that two of the judges had a conflict of interest.\n\nNationalist political parties have organised demonstrations in the capital Sofia against his release.\n\nSince being granted parole, Palfreeman has been transferred from prison to an immigration detention centre.\n\nBulgaria\u2019s interior ministry says prosecutors have ordered that he not leave the country, and he must be held because he lacks valid identification documents. Australia says it has issued him emergency travel papers and he should be permitted to go home.\n\nMonday\u2019s hearing, initially scheduled for Oct 23, was brought forward by the court amid a rising tide of political anger over the case.\n\nAustralian Foreign Minister Marise Payne said she was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d that Palfreeman remains in custody in Bulgaria.\n\n\u201cWe would be very concerned if factors other than the normal legal premises that operate in Bulgaria were at play in his case,\u201d Payne told reporters on Saturday. \u201cAnd we have most clearly and explicitly sought his release from immigration detention and his return to Australia.\u201d\n\nPalfreeman\u2019s lawyer Kalin Angelov described the appeal of the parole decision as \u201cabsurd\u201d.\n\n\u201cI think it is frustrating to everyone here,\u201d he told reporters after the court\u2019s announcement on Monday.", "description": "Bulgaria's highest appeals court said on Monday it would rule within two months on a panel's decision to grant parole to an Australian convicted of murder, which angered nationalist politicians who say it is too early for him to go free.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1438018213&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF960KN", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
