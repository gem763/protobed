PRECIOUS-Gold prices rise as investors await Fed verdict\n\n* U.S. Fed policy statement due at 1800 GMT\n\n* European shares inch lower\n\n\n\n(Updates prices, adds comments and details)\n\nBy Sumita Layek\n\nOct 30 (Reuters) - Gold prices edged higher on Wednesday\n\nhaving touched a one-week low in the previous session, as\n\ninvestors awaited a decision by the U.S. Federal Reserve on a\n\nwidely anticipated rate cut.\n\nSpot gold was up 0.2% at $1,490.23 an ounce by 1008\n\nGMT. U.S. gold futures GCv1 edged 0.2% higher to $1,493.20.\n\nThe U.S. central bank is set to share the statement of a\n\ntwo-day monetary policy meeting at 1800 GMT. Investors expect\n\nthe Fed to lower rates by a quarter of a percentage point for a\n\nthird time this year. FEDWATCH\n\n\"Prices are relatively rangebound ... If the Fed signals a\n\nhawkish cut, that could spell more dollar strength in the near\n\nterm and could suppress gold prices\", said Han Tan, market\n\nanalyst at FXTM.\n\n\"However, if the Fed Chair Jerome Powell still has\n\ncognisance of the downside risks to the U.S. economy, of the\n\neconomic headwinds, and he believes the door is wide open for\n\nmore rate cuts going to 2020, then you could see some dollar\n\nweakness in the near term.\"\n\nA weaker greenback makes dollar-denominated gold cheaper for\n\nholders for other currencies.\n\nSupporting gold, a rally in global shares stalled on worries\n\nthat a Sino-U.S. first-stage trade deal could be delayed, after\n\na U.S. administration official said an agreement might not be\n\ncompleted in time for signing in Chile next month. MKTS/GLOB\n\n\"The demand for bullion will remain intact because the\n\n'phase 1' trade deal doesn't dismantle existing tariffs ... so\n\ngiven the deteriorating economic conditions and the swelling\n\nconcerns over the global economic outlook, safe-haven assets\n\nlike gold will remain supported going into 2020,\" FXTM'S Tan\n\nsaid.\n\nData released on Tuesday showed U.S. consumer confidence\n\nfell for a third straight month in October, further helping\n\ngold. Technically, \"we would have a first bearish signal only\n\nbelow $1,480, while a rebound above $1,500 could open space for\n\nanother recovery to $1,520,\" ActivTrades chief analyst Carlo\n\nAlberto De Casa said in a note.\n\n\"As long as prices can remain above $1,460-$1,470, the main\n\ntrend remains positive, despite the recent weakness.\"\n\nInvestors also kept a close watch on Brexit developments,\n\nwhere Britain is set to hold a December election after Prime\n\nMinister Boris Johnson won approval from parliament for an early\n\nballot. Elsewhere, silver was steady at $17.80 an ounce,\n\nwhile platinum XPT= was unchanged at $920 and palladium XPD=\n\nwas flat at $1,781.\n\n\n\n", "description": "PRECIOUS-Gold prices rise as investors await Fed verdict", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/99c9e7171f1ff29af32c5ceb826611ca_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
