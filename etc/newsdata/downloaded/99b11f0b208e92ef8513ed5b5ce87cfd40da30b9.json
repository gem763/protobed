(AP) \u2014 Richard Sherman has a strong message for anyone still doubting the unbeaten San Francisco 49ers.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t flip-flop,\u201d Sherman said after the 49ers thumped the Cleveland Browns 31-3 on Monday night. \u201cIf you said we weren\u2019t going to make it, you said we were some way early on, stick with that position. Hold it. Don\u2019t try to give us credit now. At least stick by you word because I want you to sound like an idiot at the end. We know what we have in the building.\u201d\n\nWhat the 49ers have is their best start since Joe Montana was throwing touchdowns to Jerry Rice.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t the passing game that carried San Francisco past Cleveland. A steady, pounding running game and a dominant defensive effort did the trick this time.\n\nMatt Breida ran 83 yards for a touchdown on San Francisco\u2019s first play from scrimmage, Baker Mayfield was harassed into his worst game as a pro, and the 49ers stayed unbeaten for their best start in nearly 30 years.\n\nEven then, there were some questioning San Francisco\u2019s legitimacy.\n\n\u201cI feel like they\u2019re going to say that all year about us,\u201d said Breida, who had 114 yards on 11 carries. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone expected us to be 4-0 this year, to be honest. Probably expected us to be 0-4. They can say whatever they want. All that matters is who\u2019s in this locker room.\u201d\n\nTevin Coleman added a 19-yard score as part of a dominant ground game on a day when quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo passed for 181 yards and kicker Robbie Gould missed a pair of field goal attempts and had a third try blocked.\n\nSan Francisco (4-0) joined the 5-0 New England Patriots as the only remaining undefeated teams in the NFL. It\u2019s the first time the 49ers have won their first four games since 1990.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good start is really all it is,\u201d Garoppolo said. \u201cWe have a good mindset in that locker room.\u201d\n\nThe Browns (2-3) are headed the opposite direction after losing two of three, with fresh concerns about their young quarterback.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have mistakes. You can\u2019t have turnovers. You can\u2019t have drops. You can\u2019t have penalties,\u201d Cleveland coach Freddie Kitchens said. \u201cOffensively, that kind of summed us up. We just shot ourselves in the foot too many times.\u201d\n\nMayfield had a horrible game. The No. 1 overall pick last year, Mayfiaeld completed 8 of 22 passes for a career-low 100 yards, had a 13.4 passer rating, threw two interceptions, fumbled twice and was sacked four times before being pulled in the fourth quarter.\n\nIt\u2019s the first time in Mayfield\u2019s 18 career starts that he failed to throw a touchdown pass.\n\n\u201cIt was like one step forward, two back,\u201d Mayfield said. \u201cNo rhythm for the offense to get into. And when we did, we just got down in the red zone and didn\u2019t finish. The inconsistency is killing us right now.\u201d\n\nThings were rough all around for Mayfield.\n\nSan Francisco defensive end Nick Bosa poked fun at the Browns quarterback after forcing Mayfield into a hurried incompletion in the second quarter. Bosa, the second overall draft pick, got up and pretended to wave a flag and plant it in the turf as the crowd roared. It was a clear shot at Mayfield, who planted an Oklahoma flag in the turf after leading the Sooners to win over Bosa and Ohio State in 2017.\n\n\u201cI think everybody knows what that was for,\u201d Bosa said. \u201cJust wanted to get payback. He had it coming.\u201d\n\nSan Francisco forced four turnovers overall.\n\nThe 49ers were coming off a bye and had two weeks to prepare, while the Browns flew cross country.\n\nIt showed.\n\nBreida raced past the Browns\u2019 front line and went untouched on his long touchdown run, waving to safety Demarious Randall as he sprinted into the end zone with the 49ers longest run of the season.\n\nFans at Levi\u2019s Stadium barely settled back into their seats when Sherman picked off Mayfield near midfield, setting a rough tone for Cleveland\u2019s second-year quarterback.\n\nBreida and Coleman combined for 211 rushing yards as San Francisco outgained Cleveland 275-102 on the ground.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something you always want to do as a coach,\u201d 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said. \u201cIt\u2019s the easiest way to win. You play real good defense and you can run the ball, that takes some pressure off a lot of people and doesn\u2019t put you in a lot of risky situations.\u201d\n\nThat took pressure off Garoppolo, who passed for two touchdowns and completed 20 of 29 throws.\n\nGaroppolo\u2019s 5-yard throw to Breida put the 49ers up 14-0 early in the first quarter. He later connected on a 22-yard pass to tight end George Kittle in the third that made it 28-3.\n\nNOT THIS TIME EITHER\n\nThe 49ers\u2019 defense is the only NFL team to not allow a rushing touchdown this season. Browns running back Nick Chubb had 87 yards on 16 carries but was a non-factor for most of the game, especially after Cleveland fell behind big.\n\nBECKHAM OR BAKER\n\nBrowns wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. threw a 20-yard completion to Jarvis Landry on Cleveland\u2019s first play. Beckham took a handoff from Mayfield for what initially looked like an end around before reversing direction then pulling up to pass. It\u2019s the third time in his career that Beckham has completed a pass, but the first time this season.\n\nBeckham was upset he didn\u2019t get the ball to Antonio Callaway, who was open deep.\n\n\u201cWe made eye contact and I could not throw it to him,\u201d Beckham said. \u201cThere might have been an opportunity to throw it deep and it could have changed the whole momentum of the game.\u201d\n\nINJURIES\n\n49ers: Fullback Kyle Juszczyk left the game with a sprained left knee midway through the third quarter. Juszczyk, who had a pivotal block on Breida\u2019s long touchdown run, wore a thick black brace on his leg while walking through the locker room after the game.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBrowns: Return to Cleveland to host Seattle on Sunday before getting a week off for the bye.\n\n49ers: Play at the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday in a key divisional matchup for both teams.\n\n__\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "description": "SANTA CLARA, Calif.
