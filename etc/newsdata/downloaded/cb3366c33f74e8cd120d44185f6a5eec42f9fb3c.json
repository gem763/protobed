Kennedy made clear in 1961, going to the moon would cost money and entail risks, but it would be well worth it.\n\nKennedy understood that many of the lasting benefits of innovation happen not just at the end of the process, but along the way, through dynamic spillovers. And in the case of America\u2019s moonshot, he turned out to be right. Much of the technology in our smartphones today can be traced back to the Apollo program and related missions.\n\nNow that humankind is confronting the existential challenge of climate change, our survival depends on reclaiming the public spirit of the Apollo program \u2014 and the hope it inspired.\n\nImagine if we were to bring the same courage, spirit of experimentation, and willpower to bear on the greatest challenge of our time: climate change. Imagine having leaders who would proudly declare: \u201cWe choose to fight climate change in this decade not because it is easy, but because it is hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, the moonshot was motivated by America\u2019s need for a victory \u2014 at once highly symbolic and tangible \u2014 in the Cold War. But, once the quest was started, it was about solving a specific problem. And, as is typical in most wars, completing the mission came first; worrying about how to pay for it came later.\n\nGiven the threat it poses, climate change should be confronted in the same way.\n\nHouse on fire\n\nAccording to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, we have just 12 years to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, or else invite disaster. Such warnings should be a wake-up call for those overseeing public and private budgets.\n\nAs the young climate activist Greta Thunberg puts it, we must approach the issue with the same urgency \u201cas if our house is on fire. Because it is.\u201d\n\nTo that end, we should heed the primary lesson of the Apollo program: that inspiring people with hope in a mission is crucial to ensuring its success. In the case of climate change, that inspiration must involve rethinking how we organize our societies. We need to start thinking of ourselves as fundamental problem solvers once again.\n\nThat means, first and foremost, abandoning the prevailing, ideologically skewed view that governments are lumbering bureaucratic behemoths that cannot innovate. We are told civil servants cannot compare to Silicon Valley entrepreneurs when it comes to taking risks. And yet the moon landing \u2014 one of the riskiest endeavors of the past century \u2014 was a government project.\n\nI have spent the last year working closely with the European Union to adopt a mission-oriented approach to its spending on innovation.\n\nAt the global level, though, the UN Sustainable Development Goals can define our future missions, from reducing greenhouse-gas emissions to removing plastic from the ocean. We must recognize that social missions are even more complex than purely technological ones: they require not just material adjustments, but also behavioral and regulatory change.\n\nTransform governments\n\nThat means money is not enough. Governments also must be permitted to transform themselves for the mission at hand, by redesigning everything from their standard tools and instruments \u2014 such as procurement, grants, and loans \u2014 to their everyday operations.\n\nRedesigning a large public system is not easy.\n\nThe first step is to consider what public policy is actually for. Rather than just fixing market failures, policy makers should view themselves as market makers, using their resources to create the flexible and adaptable structures for guiding a collective vision and establishing the conditions for bottom-up solutions to emerge.\n\nThose solutions must collectively point to a green and circular economy \u2014 with all sectors transforming operations in such a way as to reduce their material content. Government subsidies should not be handouts; rather, they should be made conditional on reaching specific benchmarks. The word \u201cdeal\u201d must be taken as seriously as the word \u201cgreen\u201d in the Green New Deal.\n\nMore broadly, the choice before us is not between government and the private sector. Turning the climate challenge into a set of concrete missions will require the involvement of all sectors \u2014 from public health and transportation to food, energy, and housing \u2014 as well as new applications of digital technology and artificial intelligence.\n\nFormulating such missions will take creativity and first-hand knowledge: for example, urban planners and civic leaders could commit to designing 100 carbon-neutral cities worldwide by 2050.\n\nA seat at the table\n\nThe Apollo program was relatively top-down, but modern moonshots will need to engage civil society. Who decides the mission \u2014 and then monitors it along the way \u2014 is just as important as actually completing it. Trade unions\u2019 involvement should not be limited to securing a \u201cjust transition\u201d for workers in legacy industries. Rather, they also should have a seat at the table for co-defining what the term \u201cgreen\u201d even means.\n\nIn a society wracked by populist discontent, it is critical that all citizens participate in transforming our society for the better. Making our towns, cities, and streets healthy and sustainable will require inspired action from everyone \u2014 and the urgent realization that we cannot afford inaction today.", "description": "The mission to put a human on the moon should inspire us to do it again.
