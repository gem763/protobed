From an interstate highway to neighborhood streets to the parking lot of a movie theater, the gunman sowed terror across the Odessa-Midland region.\n\nA former math teacher was shot while sitting at a traffic light with his wife and children. A beloved uncle was hit outside the home he had just moved out of. A high school student bled out after leaving a dealership where her brother had just picked up the keys to his new car.\n\nPolice, who have yet to confirm the identities of the victims, raised the death toll to seven on Sunday. Authorities also fatally shot the gunman after he fled state troopers and aimed his assault-style rifle at more than 20 people, then pulled the trigger.\n\nThe dead ranged from 57 years old to as young as 15, officials said.\n\nThe wounded were even younger. A 17-month-old who had her front teeth knocked out \u2014 and a hole put through her bottom lip and tongue \u2014 will have surgery Monday to remove shrapnel from her chest, Gov. Greg Abbott (R) said Sunday at a news conference. The child will recover, he said.\n\n\u201cToddlers are funny because they can get shot but still want to run around and play,\u201d the child\u2019s mother told Abbott.\n\nHere are some of the people who did not survive, according to loved ones who spoke to The Washington Post and other media outlets \u2014 and the stories of the reeling friends and family they left behind.\n\nEdwin Peregrino, 25\n\nEdwin Peregrino was visiting his parents in Odessa when he heard gunshots outside.\n\nAt first, they appeared to be coming from afar.\n\nBut when he ran into the yard to investigate, according to his older sister, a gunman sped by and opened fire, killing Peregrino just outside the home he\u2019d moved out of weeks earlier.\n\n\u201cIt happened at our home. You think you\u2019re safe at your own house,\u201d Eritizi Peregrino, 23, said in an interview. \u201cYou\u2019re not even safe at your own house.\u201d\n\n[Texas\u2019s second mass shooting in August kills at least 7]\n\nEritizi Peregrino\u2019s husband also was shot Saturday afternoon and is recovering, she said. But her brother, who had come to visit for the weekend to talk about his new job and life in San Antonio, did not survive, his sister said.\n\nEdwin was a beloved uncle to two nephews and a niece, she said, but he wanted nothing more than to start his own family. Known for being somewhat of a troublemaker in his youth, Edwin had matured. He took pride in being there for others, and his joking nature remained, serving as a point of comfort for those who knew him.\n\n\u201cYou could always count on him for anything,\u201d Eritizi said. \u201cHe would always help my parents and his siblings. I knew I could always rely on him and call on him.\u201d\n\nLeilah Hernandez, 15\n\nLeilah Hernandez had just celebrated her quincea\u00f1era in May.\n\nLeilah\u2019s grandmother Nora Leyva had been helping the family plan the coming-of-age tradition for two years. Leyva wanted the perfect party for her oldest granddaughter, a 15-year-old who still spent most of her time with her family and who kissed and hugged her \u201cAma\u201d when she would drop by after school.\n\nThe party lived up to the Odessa High School student\u2019s excitement, Leyva said. She looked and felt like a princess in an enormous green dress. \u201cIt was like a dream for her,\u201d Leyva said.\n\n\n\nLeilah Hernandez in May at her quincea\u00f1era. Her grandmother helped plan the celebration. (Family photo)\n\nLeyva told The Post that Leilah\u2019s mother has been in a kind of daze as she mourns her daughter\u2019s death. She is relieved to be stuck at the Odessa hospital, where dozens of relatives wait for updates on Leilah\u2019s wounded brother, Nathan, still in the Intensive Care Unit, because she dreads going home to Leilah\u2019s room, Leyva said.\n\nLeilah was with her family on Saturday as her 18-year-old brother picked up a truck for which he had long been saving.\n\nNathan and Leilah were walking out of the dealership \u2014 Nathan had the keys in hand \u2014 when the gunman started randomly shooting out of his car, according to Leyva.\n\n\u201cI guess he was just looking for someone to kill,\u201d she said.\n\nLeyva\u2019s daughter pushed her 9-year-old son under a car. Nathan wrapped his arms around Leilah, taking a bullet in his right arm. The next shot, Leyva said, went through Leilah\u2019s left shoulder, near her collarbone.\n\n\u201cHelp me, help me,\u201d was all the girl said as she died, Leyva said.\n\nIt took 20 minutes for the ambulance to arrive. Authorities put pressure on the wound from both sides, but \u201cit was just too much blood coming out,\u201d Leyva said. They told Nathan as they took him away in an ambulance: \u201cYour sister did not make it.\u201d\n\nAs news of the shooting spread, Leyva scrambled to get to the hospital where her grandson was being treated, fleeing a mall under lockdown.\n\nLeilah was still figuring out what she wanted to do with her life, Leyva said. She played volleyball, but she had expressed worries to her grandmother that she wasn\u2019t good at it. Last week, Leilah\u2019s mother confided to Leyva that the girl had cried after other students had picked on her at school.\n\nBut mostly, Leyva said, Leilah was a happy girl. She was excited to start catechism classes this week. She adored her parents.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just so hard,\u201d Leyva said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be seeing her no more.\u201d\n\nThe Ector County Independent School District, which includes Odessa High School, acknowledged one of its students is among the dead, though it did not name Leilah. The high school, though, retweeted a post with the hashtag #leilahstrong.\n\n\u201cWe are heartbroken and outraged by the violence that struck our community and our school district today,\u201d the district wrote in a statement posted on Facebook. \u201cOur lives have been changed forever.\u201d\n\nCounselors from the school district and the region are \u201cpreparing to help our staff, our students and our families through this tragedy,\u201d the district said.\n\nJoseph Griffith, 40\n\n\n\nJoseph Griffith, 40, leaves behind a wife and two children, according to his sister, Carla Byrne. (Carla Byrne)\n\nCarla Byrne, the oldest sister of Joseph Griffith, told The Post that her brother was killed by the gunman while sitting at a traffic light with his wife and two children.\n\n\u201cThis maniac pulled up next to him and shot him, took away his life, murdered my baby brother. Like nothing,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are so broken.\u201d\n\nByrne recalled her brother\u2019s sense of humor, hallmarked by an uncanny ability to impersonate anyone. But nothing, she said, superseded his devotion to his wife and children.\n\nHe worked six days a week to support them, she added.\n\nGriffith was previously a math teacher who developed close bonds with his students, Byrne said. A day before he was killed, a former student had approached Griffith to tell him what an \u201cawesome teacher he was.\u201d\n\nKaitlyn King, 25, recalled being in Griffith\u2019s seventh-grade math class while attending Goddard Junior High School in Midland more than a decade ago. King, who is \u201cnot a math person,\u201d had failed the state\u2019s standardized test the previous year.\n\nTo improve on her sixth-grade marks, she needed a teacher who was patient and invested, she said. Enter Griffith, who King says approached every topic with a unique charisma that made his students \u201cwant to learn.\u201d\n\nIt probably didn\u2019t hurt that he incorporated movies into his curriculum.\n\n\u201cHe was a very funny teacher, very serious at the same time,\u201d King said. \u201cHe was good at explaining everything.\u201d\n\nShe passed her test that year.\n\nMary Granados, 29\n\nMary Granados, 29, was nearing the end of her shift as a letter carrier when the gunman hijacked her vehicle, twin sister Rosie Granados told CNN.\n\nRosie told the network that she heard her sibling scream on the phone as she was shot.\n\n\u201cIt was very painful,\u201d she said. \u201cI just wanted to help her, and I couldn\u2019t. I thought she had got bit by a dog or something. I tried calling her name, and she wouldn\u2019t answer.\u201d\n\nKnowing her sister\u2019s mail route, Rosie drove off to find her, CNN reported.\n\n\u201cWe are all broken, we are all suffering about this,\u201d she said.\n\nThe U.S. Postal Service said in a statement to The Post that it is \u201cshocked and saddened\u201d by the shootings and by the loss of its \u201cpostal family member.\u201d It added it is working with law enforcement to aid investigations.\n\nA GoFundMe page is soliciting donations to cover memorial expenses for the Odessa resident, who had been working at the Postal Service for about a year, according to her sister.\n\n\u201cI had the privilege to work with Mary before she started her career at USPS,\u201d wrote Leslie Aide, the creator of the online fundraiser. \u201cShe was beautiful inside and out, with a great heart and always ready to be a friend, always had a smile on her face!\u201d", "description": "These are only some of the people killed Saturday in Texas\u2019s second mass shooting in a month.", "authors": ["Hannah Knowles", "General Assignment Reporter", "Michael Brice-Saddler", "September At Pm", "Hannah Knowles Is A Reporter On The General Assignment Team.
