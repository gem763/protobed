Not that that makes any difference, I suppose.\u201d\n\nCheika said the balance at the start and off the bench was tailored to the opposition.\n\n\u201cI feel like this is a good combination for this game,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s also good about it is we\u2019ve got Nic White, Kurtley Beale, Adam Coleman, Sekope Kepu, James Slipper, and Lukhan (Salakaia-Loto) coming to finish the game with the impact we\u2019ll need to beat one of the top teams.\u201d\n\nWales coach Warren Gatland, who picked the same starting XV which beat Georgia 43-14 on Monday, was only too happy to analyze Cheika\u2019s choices for the game on Sunday in Tokyo, and was surprised by Foley.\n\n\u201cWith Beale they lose a bit of their attacking threat because he is definitely an attacking threat for them,\u201d Gatland said. \u201cAs in the past he will probably come off the bench relatively early and will be a handful for us.\n\n\u201cWith Foley there they will probably kick a bit more than they have been. Their kicking percentage has been pretty low in recent internationals so we expect them to kick a bit more. Probably with the back three and Foley and Genia as well they will probably try to negate our kicking threat.\u201d\n\nCheika said the coaches spelled it out to the Wallabies before the tournament how they were going to be used in what is a tough Pool D.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re pieces of the puzzle,\u201d he said. \u201cAs much as they all want to play, they know exactly where they\u2019re at.\u201d\n\nFoley was the starting flyhalf in the run to the 2015 World Cup final, and has dropped in the pecking order of late to Leali\u2019ifano.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s trying to fight against the challenge Christian has brought to him, and Matty Toomua as well,\u201d Cheika said. \u201cHe realizes, \u2018I\u2019ve got to lift my standard because this guy\u2019s playing good footy.\u2019\u201d\n\nLike Foley, Ashley-Cooper was another who wasn\u2019t picked for the Fiji game. He will appear in his fourth World Cup, and Cheika welcomed his selection.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a few more grey hairs, he thinks they make him look more distinguished. Personally, they just make him look older,\u201d Cheika said. \u201cHe\u2019s got that je ne sais quoi, he\u2019s got that something that brings him up to the challenge. Maybe not going to be able to do it every week but when his team needs him I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll deliver because he\u2019s preparing himself very well.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a good presence with the other players, very similar to Christian (Leali\u2019ifano), who has a really good calming presence on the field. Adam does the same for the players.\u201d\n\nAlun Wyn Jones will become Wales\u2018 most capped player with 130 when he leads the team out, beating the record held by prop Gethin Jenkins.\n\nThe only change in the 23 was in the reserves, where center Owen Watkin replaced Leigh Halfpenny to cover the backs, especially with center Hadleigh Parkes carrying a small fracture in his hand.\n\nWales blew away Georgia 29-0 in the first half, and Gatland said they wanted to reward that.\n\n\u201cWe felt we wanted to give that team an opportunity; we felt it was not fair to drop anyone,\u201d he said.\n\nWales will be playing Australia in a seventh Rugby World Cup, but has not beaten the Wallabies since the first in 1987.\n\n___\n\nLineups:\n\nAustralia: Dane Haylett-Petty, Adam Ashley-Cooper, James O\u2019Connor, Samu Kerevi, Marika Koroibete, Bernard Foley, Will Genia; Isi Naisarani, Michael Hooper (captain), David Pocock, Rory Arnold, Izack Rodda, Allan Alaalatoa, Tolu Latu, Scott Sio.
