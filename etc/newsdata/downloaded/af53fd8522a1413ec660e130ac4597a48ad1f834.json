But with the just-announced Surface Laptop 3, Microsoft is actually changing the laptop\u2019s design in a few key ways \u2014 including the long-awaited USB-C port so you can finally plug in loads of peripherals, docking stations, and chargers instead of relying on Microsoft\u2019s proprietary connector.\n\nWe're pleased to bring you the new Surface Laptop 3 from #MicrosoftEvent pic.twitter.com/Y7lH94NbQK \u2014 Microsoft Surface (@surface) October 2, 2019\n\nHere are some other highlights from Microsoft\u2019s event today:\n\nNo, Microsoft hasn\u2019t messed with the gloriously tall 3:2 aspect ratio touchscreen that\u2019s a Surface trademark now. But you\u2019ll be able to buy an even larger 15-inch Surface Laptop instead of just the 13.5-inch model. Previously, if you wanted a 15-inch laptop from Microsoft, you\u2019d have to spend a princely sum for the Surface Book with its detachable screen and stylus.\n\nThe 13.5-inch model has a quad-core 10th Gen Ice Lake Intel Core processor that Microsoft claims makes it twice as fast the Surface Laptop 2 and three times as fast as a MacBook Air.\n\nBut the 15-inch model has two new AMD \u2014 not Intel \u2014 processors inside. They\u2019re semi-custom \u201cRyzen Surface Edition\u201d chips that the company\u2019s calling \u201cthe fastest processor for any laptop in its class today,\u201d by which Microsoft means thin 15-inch laptops (max 20mm height) that use 15-watt processors. Apple\u2019s entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro uses a 15-watt chip, for comparison. Microsoft says it has extra integrated graphical oomph over a standard Ryzen chip, with an additional graphics core.\n\nWhat was traditionally the Surface Laptop\u2019s most striking feature, its Alcantara fabric covering the keyboard deck, no longer comes standard on every model. The fabric\u2019s not gone for good, but the company\u2019s opted for a plainer machined aluminum finish as an option for some models.\n\nMicrosoft says you can open it with a single finger \u2014 even though it doesn\u2019t have a finger scoop \u2014 and it\u2019ll instantly be on. They\u2019re also touting no speaker holes or rubber bumper around the metal model\u2019s screen (you know, to protect it from smashing into your keyboard deck) as additional proof of a meticulous design.\n\nIt\u2019s actually got reduced key travel at 1.3mm, compared to 1.5mm in Surface Laptop 2, but has a 20 percent larger trackpad with Windows Precision drivers (of course). Microsoft claims the keys make for near-silent typing.\n\nDespite being a thin machine, Microsoft\u2019s touting a removable hard drive in the Surface Laptop 3 \u2014 a stab at Apple\u2019s laptops where the drive is generally very hard to replace.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s promising 11.5 hours of battery life from either model, though that\u2019s apparently with the screen brightness set to a fairly dim 150 nits.\n\nThe proprietary Surface Connector isn\u2019t actually gone \u2014 Microsoft says it\u2019ll help you charge up the battery to 80 percent in under an hour. Hopefully that\u2019s true via USB-C as well.\n\nThey\u2019ll start at $999 and $1,199 for the 13.5- and 15-inch models, respectively, with preorders open today, shipping October 22nd.\n\nUpdate, 12:52PM ET: Also updated with more specs. Previously corrected that the Surface Laptop 2 actually had slightly higher key travel at 1.5mm, according to a Microsoft fact sheet. We momentarily wrote it had the same key travel.", "description": "By balancing price, performance, portability, and design, the 13.5-inch Microsoft Surface Laptop became one of the best notebooks of 2017, and the company barely bothered to change that formula for 2018\u2019s Surface Laptop 2.
