Over the years, he has taken on several names as well, the latest being Jasrat.\"\n\nA tigress went missing in the Pench Reserve in 2012, and its hide was found a year later, 1,000 miles away in Nepal. He was arrested the first time in 2014 but released on bail.\n\nIn his possessions were recovered more than one Aadhar card, and three fake voter IDs. Apparently, he was able to evade the police all these years as he bribed the heads of every village he moved to, with boars.\n\nYarlen alias Jasrat alias Luzalen will likely be charged with multiple violations of the Wildlife Protection Act. Not just tigers, even sloth bears are listed as 'vulnerable' species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\n\nWhat this man has been doing all these years, is sick. He should not have been able to get bail in the first place, all those years ago. Indian laws need to be stricter in protecting animals - especially endangered species. The number of fake identities and Aadhar cards the man owned, also brings to the light the discrepancy with the identification system which is marketed as pretty solid.", "description": "One of the most wanted freaks in India, a tiger poacher who used to eat the penis of sloth bears has finally been caught by the authorities after six years.
