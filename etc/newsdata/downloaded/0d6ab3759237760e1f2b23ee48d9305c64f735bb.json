The prospect becomes less alluring with age, so I have some trepidation stepping in between two old friends, Andrew Napolitano and Joe DiGenova. Through intermediary hosts, the pair \u2014 Napolitano a former New Jersey Superior Court jurist and law professor, DiGenova a former United States Attorney for the District of Columbia and prominent defense lawyer \u2014 brawled this week on Fox News (where I, like they, contribute regularly).\n\nI\u2019m going to steer clear of the pugnacious to-ing and fro-ing. Let\u2019s consider the intriguing legal issue that ignited it.\n\nJudge Napolitano argues that the July 25 conversation between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky contains the makings of a campaign-finance crime. He highlights Trump\u2019s request for Ukraine\u2019s help in investigating then\u2013vice president Joe Biden. In 2016, Biden pressured Kyiv to drop a corruption investigation of Burisma, a natural gas company that paid Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, big bucks to sit on its board.\n\nBiden, of course, is one of the favorites for the Democratic presidential nomination. Napolitano reasons that the information Trump sought from Ukraine would be a form of \u201copposition research\u201d that could be seen as an in-kind donation to Trump\u2019s reelection campaign, which should be deemed illegal because the law prohibits foreign contributions and attempts to acquire them. (Napolitano also raised the \u201carguable\u201d possibility of a bribery offense, on the theory that Trump was withholding defense aid as a corrupt quid pro quo to get the Biden information. But he emphasized the foreign contribution issue. That is his stronger argument, and I am focusing on it, given that the Trump-Zelensky transcript does not support a quid pro quo demand; plus bribery, in any event, raises the same \u201cthing of value\u201d proof problems addressed below.)\n\nDiGenova strongly disagrees. Though there wasn\u2019t much time to elaborate, he is clearly relying on the lack of past campaign-law prosecutions on similar facts. DiGenova is also voicing the prudent conservative hostility to campaign-finance laws: Any expansion of criminal liability would necessarily restrict political speech, the core of First Amendment liberty.\n\nI\u2019m with DiGenova on this, but it\u2019s a closer question than he suggests. Napolitano\u2019s construction of the campaign laws, while not wholly implausible, is purely academic. It ignores real-world concerns about free speech and the prosecutor\u2019s burden to prove intent.\n\nMost of the commentary on this has been very politicized (surprise!). For dyed-in-the-wool anti-Trumpers, no technicality is too trifling to be a felony. For the Trump base, it\u2019s all a witch hunt. In light of this, the most helpful source we can turn to is the Mueller Report. (File in: Sentences I\u2019d Have Bet My Life I\u2019d Never Write.)\n\nSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team overflowed with partisan Democrats, and their report could have been entitled \u201cRoadmap to Impeachment.\u201d While they faced complications (that I\u2019ve addressed) in making a case against the president, the prosecutors were not inhibited when it came to other subjects of the investigation. They\u2019d have loved to nail Donald Trump Jr. But the only thing they had was the notorious Trump Tower Meeting of June 2016, when Don Jr. orchestrated a meeting with a Kremlin-tied lawyer (Natalya Veselnitskaya) in an effort to obtain Russian dirt to be used against Hillary Clinton. Veselnitskaya supplied information, but it was a dud.\n\nThe campaign-finance offense that Napolitano urges be charged against President Trump appears to be the same one Mueller considered charging against Don Jr. The Mueller team\u2019s analysis (Vol. 1, pp. 186-187) is thus on point. And it is frustratingly ambiguous \u2014 as befits the constitutionally dubious campaign-finance laws.\n\nTwo offense elements proved to be stumbling blocks for the prosecutors. The first is the question whether opposition research is a \u201cthing of value\u201d under federal law. Mueller\u2019s team assumed that, in theory, it might be (the Napolitano view), but that to interpret it as such would break new ground and raise troubling First Amendment issues (the DiGenova position).", "description": "Back home in the Bronx is where I first heard the old saw about the Irishman who, coming upon a donnybrook at the local pub, asks a bystander: \u201cIs this a private fight or can anybody join?\u201dI was a much younger fellow then.
