The call is well made. It could be applied to disability across the board.\n\nOn those rare occasions where it features on-screen it is typically used as a McGuffun, a prop that is there to drive the plot along without any real relevance to it.\n\nThe actors chosen to take on the roles of disabled people are usually able-bodied too, further squeezing out disabled talent.\n\nThe film industry has got to grips with the idea that blacking up is wrong and there\u2019s been some progress towards more diverse casts, although it has a long way to go and still gets it wrong on occasion. See the controversy about the casting of Scarlett Johansson as the Japanese Major in Ghost in the Shell for a recent example.\n\nWhen it comes to disability, however, it remains stuck in the early part of the last century.\n\nIdeally you wouldn\u2019t need such an event like Oska Bright because those it features, its film makers, performers producers, would be integrated into the wider industry.\n\nBut they are not.\n\nAccording to government figures as many as 19 per cent of working age adults have some form of disability. According to the Creative Skillset Employment Census that took place in 2012, just 0.3 per cent of the workforce in film was identified as disabled compared. For the creative media as a whole it was 1 per cent. Even though the figures are now quite dated, the world dismal doesn\u2019t even begin to describe them. Disturbingly the survey didn\u2019t show much sign of an improving trend. Au contraire.\n\nThe festival is necessary because while there is clearly a demand - the size of the filed and its diversity speaks to that - there are few other opportunities for the people who have entered films to display their talents.\n\nBut what about the charge that is just a big \u201cfeel good exercise\u201d, a patronising visual arts Special Olympics. The criticism itself is rather patronising if you think about it.\n\nNonetheless, said I, send me some submissions from previous years. I\u2019ll look at them with a critical eye.\n\nOne in particular caught my attention and held it. It\u2019s called Mask, and features its maker Sharif Persaud delivering a monologue in an Al Murray mask.\n\nThe real Al Murray turns up about half way through.\n\nAs the parent of an autistic child it delivered a light bulb moment about half way through.\n\nThrough the medium of film it offered an insight into aspects of my son\u2019s behaviour that I understood on an intellectual level but perhaps hadn\u2019t connected with on an emotional one. This is what cinema, at its best, can do. It\u2019s just not doing it enough. Disabled voices need to be heard.\n\nNo doubt there\u2019s bad as well as good among the entrants. It\u2019s a film festival after all.\n\nBut I\u2019d respectfully suggest that those who dismisses it as a feel good exercise need to examine their prejudices.\n\nSet up in 2004, the event is now recognised by the British Film Institute (BFI), which means entrants are eligible for Baftas in the short film category. That, at least , is a step forwards. More are needed.\n\n", "description": "\u201cA feel good exercise.\u201d \u201cA children\u2019s festival.\u201d The people behind the biannual Oska Bright film festival, which kicks off in Brighton later this month, have good reason to feel angry about some of the criticism that has come their way.
