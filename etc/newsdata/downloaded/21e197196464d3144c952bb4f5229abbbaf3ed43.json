Of course it isn\u2019t,\u201d Varadkar said.\n\nThe Irish PM is expected to meet Johnson again later this week in a last-ditch effort to avoid a no-deal Brexit.", "description": "\u2018I don\u2019t play dirty and I don\u2019t think most EU leaders do either,\u2019 Leo Varadkar says.", "authors": ["Louise Guillot"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1173341230-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
