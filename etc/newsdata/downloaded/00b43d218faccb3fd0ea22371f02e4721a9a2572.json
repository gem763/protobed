While evaluations were initially requested at SpaceX as well as Boeing, both of which were contracted to take people to the International Space Station, the review at the U.S. planemaker was later halted.\n\nThe additional money that NASA paid SpaceX is standard practice when an agency requires work by a contractor not covered under the original agreement. While NASA didn't comment on its reasons for the review, which included compliance with illegal-drug policies, NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine made clear he didn't want contractors engaging in behavior like Musk's on-air toking.\n\n\u201cThat was not helpful, and that did not inspire confidence, and the leaders of these organizations need to take that as an example of what to do when you lead an organization that\u2019s going to launch American astronauts,\u201d Bridenstine told The Atlantic. Musk \"is as committed to safety as anybody, and he understands that that was not appropriate behavior, and you won\u2019t be seeing that again.\"\n\nMarijuana use is still banned by federal law, despite its legalization by some American states and cities.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\n\"There is nothing more important to SpaceX than this endeavor, and we take seriously the responsibility that NASA has entrusted in us to safely and reliably carry American astronauts to and from the International Space Station,\" SpaceX said after the review was announced. The company expressed confidence that its \"comprehensive drug-free workforce and workplace programs exceed all applicable contractual requirements.\"\n\nSpaceX and Boeing each received government contracts in 2014 to develop a spacecraft capable of ferrying U.S. astronauts to the space station. While SpaceX initially set a 2017 target date for completion, the firm has yet to deliver a final version of its \u201cCrew Dragon\u201d vessel.\n\nIn the interim, NASA monitors compliance by both SpaceX and Boeing with its safety requirements. \"As with all we do, the ultimate goal is astronaut and public safety for the important missions the companies are undertaking,\" the agency said.\n\nBoeing didn't immediately respond to requests for comment from FOX Business.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nFOX Business\u2019 Thomas Barrabi contributed to this report.", "description": "SpaceX and Boeing each received government contracts in 2014 to develop a spacecraft capable of ferrying U.S. astronauts to the space station.", "authors": ["Daniella Genovese"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/elon-musk-spacex-1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
