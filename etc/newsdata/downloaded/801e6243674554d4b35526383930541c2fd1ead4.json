Given the push back from Congress, that decision may, hopefully, not be final. Still, we should have no illusions: Syria is a mess, and the president\u2019s decision, if he follows through, will make it even messier. Letting the Turks loose and repatriating a million Syrian refugees will create another humanitarian disaster, ignite a Turkish-Kurdish conflict and give ISIS a boost.\n\nBut the small number of American troops in Syria can\u2019t fix this broken country or make it appreciably better. Syria\u2019s future will be determined by those who are willing \u2013 unlike Washington \u2013 to invest significant blood and treasure there. The Trump administration does not consider Syria a vital U.S. interest and neither did its predecessor. It\u2019s about time that those who think otherwise accept several unpleasant realities.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision may have blindsided the State and Defense Departments, but anyone genuinely surprised by the announcement clearly hasn\u2019t been paying attention. Nor should the Kurds be shocked by Trump\u2019s betrayal. The U.S. has a history of abandoning them, and the signs that they were dispensable tools in the administration\u2019s anti-ISIS campaign were evident long before today. At least twice before, Trump had threatened to pull out of Syria.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrump\u2019s aborted decision last December to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria prompted former Secretary of Defense James Mattis James Norman MattisFive things to know about Trump's decision on Syria, Turkey and the Kurds Trump threatens to punish Turkey if it does anything 'off limits' Brent Budowsky: Deep Throat's defending our democracy MORE to resign and accelerated former Special Envoy Brett McGurk\u2019s departure from the administration.\n\nBoth were justifiably horrified for moral and strategic reasons that Trump would abandon America\u2019s only reliable allies in Syria in the fight against ISIS. Then again, Trump had no stake in encouraging Kurdish separatism, getting in the middle of a Turkish-Kurdish conflict or alienating Turkish President Erdogan. Indeed, it was only a matter of time before a risk-averse and politically attuned president, eager to fulfill his campaign promise to get America out of \u201cendless foreign wars,\u201d would take another shot at making it happen.\n\nThe president\u2019s decision triggered a hostile reaction, especially from Republicans on the Hill, who found the idea of abandoning a loyal partner morally abhorrent and feared it would invite a large scale Turkish invasion and decimation of the Kurds. Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.), one of the president\u2019s most avid supporters, called it a \u201cdisaster in the making\u201d and threatened sanctions on Turkey if it mounted an attack against the Kurds.

Congress has been down this road before, passing a formal bipartisan resolution in January 2019 criticizing the president for previous threats to withdraw.\n\nTrump may \u2013 as he\u2019s done before \u2013 reverse this latest decision. Within hours of the Hill\u2019s reaction, the president tweeted that he\u2019d move to restrain any Turkish military move, threatening to \u201cobliterate\u201d the Turkish economy. In fact, Erdogan has never been comfortable with a total U.S. withdrawal from Syria, which would leave Ankara to address the entire problem on its own.\n\nThe Turkish president made clear that he\u2019d wait to discuss the \u201cdepth of (the Turkish military) operation\u201d until he sees President Trump next month in Washington, perhaps indicating a large-scale Turkish military move against the Kurds isn\u2019t imminent.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe president should use this time and the meeting with Erdogan to negotiate badly needed arrangements to protect the Kurds from decimation and enable America\u2019s partner to continue its fight against ISIS.\n\nThis may be a bridge too far, or one crossed too late. Erdogan may well decide to mount a cross border incursion against the Kurds sooner rather than later. And besides, Trump is desperate to achieve a foreign policy \u201cwin\u201d and to make good on his campaign commitment to extricate America from its wars in the Middle East. Erdogan knows this and so do the leaders of Syria, Russia and Iran. None of them fear deeper U.S. military involvement in Syria, and thus have no incentive to give away anything to the U.S. in negotiations.\n\nIndeed, the U.S. is at a deep disadvantage in Syria because Trump (and Obama) have made it very clear that Syria is not a vital U.S. interest and America is therefore unwilling to incur the costs and risks, in lives, treasure and credibility, that the other major players are prepared to absorb. The inconvenient truth is that these countries are prepared to pay a far higher price to achieve their objectives than Washington is to realize its goals. This asymmetry in will and interests is at the heart of America\u2019s inability to bend Syria in a more positive direction.\n\nThe critics of the president\u2019s decision need to be realistic about what the U.S. can achieve in Syria. Assad is not going anywhere. The small U.S. military presence provides no leverage to remove him from power and they cannot, without help from its Kurdish partners, contain the threat from the Islamic state or leverage the Syrians, Iranians, Russians and Turks into getting this job done. No matter how much Republicans and Democrats deplore the president\u2019s decision, very few \u2013 and we put ourselves at the top of the list \u2013 would advocate deploying thousands of more troops to Syria and getting more involved in Syria\u2019s own forever war.\n\nAaron David Miller is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the author most recently of \"The End of Greatness: Why America Can\u2019t Have (And Doesn\u2019t Want) Another Great President.\" Miller was a State Department Middle East analyst and negotiator in Democratic and Republican administrations.\n\nRichard Sokolsky, a non-resident senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, served in the State Department for thirty years and was a member of the Secretary of State\u2019s Policy Planning Office from 2005-2015.", "description": "The critics of the president\u2019s decision need to be realistic about what the U.S. can achieve in Syria.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/ussyriakurds_100619getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
