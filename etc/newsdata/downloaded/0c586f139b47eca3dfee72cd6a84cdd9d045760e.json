The Ottoman Empire was centred in present-day Turkey.\n\nThe vote marked the first time in 35 years that such legislation was considered in the full House, underscoring widespread frustration in Congress with the Turkish government on the part of both Democrats and President Donald Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans.\n\nPredominantly Muslim Turkey, which has no diplomatic ties with neighbouring Armenia, says many Christian Armenians were killed in partisan fighting during World War One but denies that thus amounted to genocide. Ankara says there was no organised campaign to wipe out Armenians and no evidence of any such orders from the Ottoman authorities.\n\nArmenian Foreign Minister Zohrab Mnatsakanyan thanked the U.S. Congress for the decision.\n\n\u201cMassive message against #denialism. Deep gratitude to each of 405 votes. Empowered to work anew for prevention of mass atrocities anywhere in the world,\u201d he posted on Twitter.\n\nArmenians at home and abroad welcomed the resolution.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very positive about the adoption of this resolution on Armenian genocide,\u201d said Artur, a middle-aged resident of the capital Yerevan.\n\n\u201cWow Look at these incredible numbers!!! The U.S. just recognised the Armenian genocide!!!!\u201d tweeted Kim Kardashian, a U.S. reality TV star with Armenian heritage.\n\nTurkey\u2019s Foreign Ministry issued a statement condemning the resolution as \u201cdevoid of any historical or legal basis\u201d. It added: \u201cAs a meaningless political step, its sole addressees are the Armenian lobby and anti-Turkey groups.\u201d", "description": "Armenia on Tuesday praised the U.S. House of Representatives' passage of a resolution recognising the mass killings of Armenians a century ago as \"genocide\", a move denounced by Turkey as \"null and void\".", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
