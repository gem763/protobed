She declined to give further details of the claim.\n\nA spokeswoman for News Group Newspapers, publisher of The Sun, confirmed that a claim had been issued by Harry.\n\nCourt documents first reported by website Byline Investigates also show that Harry is targeting Mirror Group Newspapers, owned by Reach PLC (RCH.L), with the legal action. A spokesman for Reach declined to comment.\n\nA source familiar with the situation said proceedings have been issued but the publisher was yet to receive legal papers in relation to the case.\n\nOn Tuesday, Harry said he and Meghan were taking separate legal action against the Mail on Sunday over the publication of a private letter that her lawyers said was unlawful.\n\nIn an emotional statement, Harry said the treatment of Meghan by sections of the British press was reminiscent of their approach to his mother Diana, who died in a car crash in 1997 after being followed through the streets of Paris by photographers.\n\n\u201cMy deepest fear is history repeating itself. I\u2019ve seen what happens when someone I love is commoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person. I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces,\u201d he said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nHARRY AND KATE TARGETED\n\nFriday\u2019s legal action relates to events that happened before Harry and Meghan met.\n\nIn August 2006, the News of the World\u2019s former royal editor Clive Goodman and private investigator Glenn Mulcaire were arrested and later charged with hacking the telephones of royal aides by accessing voicemail messages. They admitted the charges in 2007.\n\nThe phones of Prince Harry, who is Queen Elizabeth\u2019s grandson and sixth in line to the throne, and his brother William\u2019s wife Kate were hacked by staff working for the now-defunct News of the World, a London court heard in 2013.\n\nNews of the World had been part of News Group Newspapers.\n\nThe court heard extracts of a message left on Harry\u2019s phone in which an unknown male pretended to be the prince\u2019s then-girlfriend Chelsy Davy. The paper later ran a story saying the joke message was left by William for his brother.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Britain's Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, is pictured during one of his activities joining a Botswana Defence Force anti-poaching patrol on the Chobe River in Kasane, Botswana, September 26, 2019.
