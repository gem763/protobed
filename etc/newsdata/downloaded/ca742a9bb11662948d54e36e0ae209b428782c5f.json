But the argy bargy is really a public extension of the sort of vigorous private negotiations over aeronautical fees that the airports and airlines regularly go through. The difference now is the airlines are trying to put pressure on the Morrison government to impose more regulatory costs and political risks on the airports, for no obvious benefit to airline passengers.\n\nHence, the nation\u2019s highest paid boss, Alan Joyce of Qantas, told the National Press Club on Wednesday that airports are an \u201cinvestment unicorn\u201d - private monopolies that hold airlines and passengers \u201cover a barrel\u201d to earn supersized margins on unregulated revenue streams. Mr Joyce and his fellow duopolist, Virgin CEO Paul Scurrah, want the government to impose a new system of independent arbitration on contract negotiations between airlines and airports. Anticipating no change from the Productivity Commission\u2019s draft report into the airport regulation early this year, they\u2019ve hired former competition regulator Graeme Samuel to further amplify their cause. Current Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chair Rod Sims is on board.\n\nNotwithstanding the loudhailer lobbying, however, the airlines have not demolished the Productivity Commission\u2019s assessment that, following the privatisation of Australia\u2019s previously government-owned airports in the late 1990s and early 2000s, light-touch regulation has benefited air-travellers and the community. The capital city airports - particularly in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth - do possess a degree of monopoly power. Most Australian cities have just one major gateway (only Brisbane with its extensions into the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast has a few more). Critically, however, the Productivity Commission finds little evidence the airports have abused this power. In part, that\u2019s because the airline duopolists can exercise their own countervailing market power.\n\nOligarch airlines take on monopoly airports. Paul Rovere\n\nThe textbook monopolist jacks up prices and curtails output. But the big city airports have invested billions of dollars in meeting the vigorous increase in the demand for domestic and international travel over the past decade. While comparisons can be difficult, the airports do not overcharge their airline customers or reap monopoly profits, the Productivity Commission finds. The airlines land a public relations blow by highlighting the passenger bugbear of high parking fees. But these parking fees reflect the high convenience value and opportunity cost of property only 100 metres or so from airport check-ins. Parking at Rod Laver Arena for a few hours costs $30 compared to $24 for three hours Melbourne\u2019s Tullamarine at-terminal car park. Under fire from the airlines\u2019 campaign, the airports point to high airfares that Qantas and Virgin charge passengers between Sydney and Melbourne, the world\u2019s second most lucrative air route. That allows Qantas to make more money than the four biggest airports combined.\n\nThe truth is that, while fighting like cats and dogs, the airports and the airlines need each other. Airlines may have the most mobile of assets and, unlike airports, they can lift or drop seat capacity at will. But an airline isn\u2019t likely to quit servicing a major population centre because it can\u2019t get along with the airport. Instead airlines can and do hold back on the fees asked by airports even while they carry on using them: Perth airport is this year suing Qantas over unpaid fees. Airport leases may not allow an airport to refuse service, even without an agreement.\n\nGovernment imposition of backstop arbitration may be warranted for a gas pipeline or, to cite a current issue, for negotiations between traditional media and the giant technology platforms such as Google and Facebook that have taken so much of the advertising market that finances journalism. But there is no reason to think any gain that airlines made out of an arbitrated settlement with airports would be passed on to passengers. And airlines face their own incentives to use imposed arbitration to delay airport investment that would open up space for competitor airlines. The Productivity Commission notes arguments, threats and colourful language are typical in negotiations between airlines and airports. The government should tell both of them to get back to working it out between themselves and stop dragging down the reputation of their industry.", "description": "Airports are not monopolists, and airlines do not need an umpire.
