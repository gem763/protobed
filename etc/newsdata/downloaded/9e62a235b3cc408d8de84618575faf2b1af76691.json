Check.\n\nPantry filled with lunch snacks for the week? Check.\n\nExtracurricular activity scheduled for this month? Check.\n\nIt\u2019s also time to fill out forms, so many, many forms, during those initial weeks of the new school year.\n\nMost require little of us other than a pen, our smartphone contacts and time \u2014 time that\u2019s usually found somewhere between pouring milk into cereal bowls and making sure everyone has (somewhat clean) socks.\n\nAs you go through your forms this year, keep an eye out for the ones asking for permission to share your kids\u2019 pictures, assignments and art online. Until your children start being able to make these choices on their own, you should be in control of your child\u2019s digital footprint. While we may wish the law protected families from others posting about them without consent, there are gray areas.\n\nBe happy the school is reaching out for permission. But know that not everyone who shares online will ask first to make sure it\u2019s okay. And while you might be able to get posts you don\u2019t approve of taken down, by the time you find out they exist and make the request, the damage may already be done. If you\u2019re lucky, it\u2019s nothing more than an unflattering image flashing across your friends\u2019 social media feeds. But there is a chance that the oversharing could cause harm to someone\u2019s reputation, finances or, in a worst-case (but rare) scenario, physical self. That possibility shouldn\u2019t be overlooked.\n\nOur social media accounts offer us ways to do privacy checkups for our own online lives, but there aren\u2019t many resources out there to help us do privacy checkups on behalf of our kids. Here\u2019s a checklist to help you better manage your child\u2019s online presence.\n\nTell friends and family about your privacy wishes. Most of the people in our lives won\u2019t intrude on our digital footprints maliciously. Instead, most do so because they have not considered the importance of privacy. Start the conversation, and set parameters around what others can share about your family. More often than not, your friends and family will happily comply with your wishes.\n\nBe sure your social media settings require you to approve posts when you\u2019ve been tagged. This way, in many instances, you can be the first to see when your child\u2019s image is being shared online. If you don\u2019t approve of the picture, untag yourself or contact the person sharing the image and ask them to take it down.\n\n[Gen Z kids are the stars of their parents' social media. They have some thoughts about that.]\n\nSet up Google alerts to let you know if your child\u2019s name is included in anything published online. This free and easy service will alert you any time the child\u2019s name is shared in a news article or public social media post. Google isn\u2019t the only service that does this. Talkwalker and Mention are two other platforms with similar offerings. It isn\u2019t inherently \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d for your child to have an online presence, but it is smart to know all the places where your child\u2019s name is shared and in what context.\n\nWhen signing kids up for activities, let the school know of your sharing preferences, and ask whether they have a policy in place that protects your wishes. If the school does not have a policy, offer to help create one. Other parents will thank you. A simple email to teachers and coaches can get the conversation started. In schools, you could ask the parent-teacher association to take up the issue on behalf of all the students. Or, if your child is active in a sport, ask the coaches or boosters to look into the organization\u2019s policies.\n\nResearch the Web-based systems your child\u2019s school uses in the classroom. Insist that the school share information about these programs with all parents, and ask for a meeting with not only the school but the third-party provider if you have questions. Don\u2019t assume the school will protect your child\u2019s privacy. There are many programs that enhance the learning environment, but some may put your child\u2019s privacy at risk. Ask your child\u2019s school to scrutinize programs carefully (and ask for parent input) before adopting them into the classroom. One popular app schools use is ClassDojo, which has a great track record and has been used successfully in my children\u2019s classrooms. But no matter how other parents feel about a third-party platform in the classroom, do your homework and be sure you understand how the teacher will use it and what will happen with your child\u2019s personal information after the school year ends.\n\nWhen someone does share an image of you or your child without asking, consider the intent. Was it done to harm you or out of ignorance? If it was ignorance, use it as a learning opportunity for the other person. Share why you are concerned. Instead of assuming your input won\u2019t change their actions in the future, consider that they hadn\u2019t even thought about the issue and might appreciate your perspective.\n\nAs our kids grow up on our social media feeds, we are also growing and learning as adults through social media\u2019s ever-present lens. Whether you print this checklist out and post in on your fridge or keep it in the back of your mind to help steer you when you\u2019re on the go, your kids will one day thank you for protecting their online identity.\n\nThis essay should not be considered legal advice.
