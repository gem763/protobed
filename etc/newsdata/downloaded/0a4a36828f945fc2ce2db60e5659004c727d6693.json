The guiding theme of these works is empathy\u2014how inmates shouldn\u2019t be fully defined by their sentences and are human beings capable of redemption. 45 Seconds of Laughter, Robbins\u2019 latest turn behind the camera, follows in kind.\n\nSet at the Calipatria State Prison, an all-male maximum-security facility in Imperial City, California, the documentary, which made its North American premiere at the New York Film Festival, is a fly-on-the-wall account of The Prison Project, an offshoot of Robbins\u2019 theater troupe The Actors\u2019 Gang, which teaches acting workshops to the incarcerated, allowing them to access their emotions, form bonds, and break down barriers. Robbins\u2019 group trains the men in Italian commedia dell\u2019arte, and the film chronicles the rehearsal and staging of a performance for their friends and family members, from summer to Christmas.\n\n\u201cWhat it does in training is, it frees the actor from having to create a character out of whole cloth,\u201d Robbins tells The Daily Beast of the commedia dell\u2019arte technique. \u201cThe actor can choose any one of the characters, and this allows them to get at the essence of what we\u2019re trying to do, which is to connect to a deep emotional truth.\u201d\n\nOver the course of our winding chat, Robbins opened up about our iniquitous criminal-justice system, why The Shawshank Redemption has stood the test of time, his controversial politics, and much more.\n\nHow did The Actors\u2019 Gang get involved with The Prison Project?\n\nAlmost fourteen years ago, one of my actresses, Sabra Williams, came to me and asked if she could start this work in prison. For me, it seemed like a natural extension of the work that we had been doing with the method of acting that we use, since we had already been doing it in schools. So, I gave her some money to start a pilot program and checked in on it. We soon realized, after making some adjustments, how effective it could be as a form of rehabilitation. We noticed a change happening with the people we were working with, and as we got better with it, we came to understand the power in the work, and the effectiveness of the work.\n\nWhat \u201cchange\u201d did you see happening?\n\nFirst off, eye contact. Getting guys from rival gangs to work in the same room to achieve a common goal, and doing it successfully, and seeing how the barriers started to break down was a shift for us. Something about the way that we train actors was translating into something that was truly effective for these gentlemen, and consequently, for the women we worked with as well.\n\nIn 45 Seconds of Laughter, we don\u2019t know what the men were put in prison for. Did you feel omitting that information made for a purer viewing experience?\n\nWe never know. We don\u2019t want to know. For us, it\u2019s essential to walk into those rooms without judgment, and to operate these workshops in a collective way that isn\u2019t about \u201cteacher knows everything, student knows nothing.\u201d In fact, we try very early on in the workshop to infuse the voices of the people we\u2019re working with as a legitimate voice, so that\u2019s why we always check in after exercises to see how they\u2019re thinking and feeling. I think it\u2019s an anomaly to them; it\u2019s not something they\u2019re used to, to be treated with respect, and it helps in breaking down these barriers. I\u2019m of the opinion that, as Sister Helen Prejean says, \u201cEvery person is worth more than their worst act.\u201d I have met many, many people in prison who know exactly what they\u2019ve done, aren\u2019t questioning whether they should be in jail for it, but are looking for a way to change the direction of their life. For me, the future is essential and what happened in the past is not relevant to the work we\u2019re doing.\n\nBetween this, The Shawshank Redemption and Dead Man Walking, your career\u2019s inextricably linked to prison, and to the plight of the prisoner. Why do you think that\u2019s happened?\n\nI think the reason why I was able to approach the role in Shawshank Redemption the way that I did was connected to my upbringing. I grew up in Greenwich Village in the late-\u201860s and early-\u201870s. It was fun, complicated, dangerous, groundbreaking, but the thing that I haven\u2019t seen in the story about Greenwich Village at that time was how complicated the cultural dynamics were between second and third-generation Italian and Irish and bohemians, hippies, folk singers, etc. I went to a Catholic school with a bunch of kids, some of whom were pretty tough, and you had to learn how to run or fight. There were certain routes you would take when you were walking the streets, certain places you knew to avoid because a potential fight existed on that street. I grew up around a culture of survival and crime, and growing up in that environment demanded choices. Luckily I made the right choices, but some of my friends made the wrong ones and wound up in the system. So I never felt far removed from those that wound up in prison. When I was looking at portraying Andy Dufresne, I went in with a lack of judgment on who these people were that were incarcerated.\n\n\u201c There\u2019s always a possibility for a place on the beach in Zihuatanejo, and that\u2019s something that people want to hold on to. \u201d\n\nWhy do you think it\u2019s endured the way that it has? It\u2019s really considered by many to be a modern classic.\n\nI\u2019m not sure exactly what it is. I know that it gives me hope that it has endured, and that it\u2019s important to so many people. At the core of it, there\u2019s a forgiving heart and a sense of empathy. There are very few films that are about the friendship of two men. And I also think that the enduring theme of that film that resonates with so many people is that, despite what you are surrounded with in your life, despite the paths you may have taken or the bad luck you may have had, that there\u2019s always hope; there\u2019s always a possibility for a place on the beach in Zihuatanejo, and that\u2019s something that people want to hold on to.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the most non-judgmental films about people in the system. It humanizes them and doesn\u2019t pass judgment on them.\n\nAnd to understand how cool that is, that\u2019s all happening at a time when, as a society, our politicians and our media were demonizing criminals, and criminalizing behavior that hadn\u2019t been criminal before\u2014I\u2019m talking about the criminalization of marijuana in the \u201860s. All of this reaction to the film of Shawshank was happening when we were incarcerating more and more people than ever before, and you remember the rhetoric: gotta be tough on crime. And this was across the aisle, both Republicans and Democrats. You gotta be tough on crime, increased sentencing laws, mandatory minimums, lack of discretion for judges in particular cases to be more lenient, and what wound up happening was we wound up over-incarcerating non-violent criminals for very long periods of time.\n\nWhen I was doing Shawshank I talked to the prison guards, and this was in \u201993, and I asked them, \u201cWhat do you think is wrong with the system?\u201d\u2014and mind you, this is Mansfield, Ohio, and I\u2019m talking to conservative prison guards, and they said, \u201cWell, the government should legalize marijuana.\u201d I asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d and they said, \u201cBecause we are incarcerating non-violent teenagers into a system filled with violent felons, and we\u2019re putting them in for two years, there\u2019s a two-year waiting list on any GED or job-training programs, so we\u2019re essentially putting these kids into a crime school.\u201d They were very clear about that. And this was all because of politicians wanting to appear to be tough but not considering the consequences of their legislation.\n\nYou got a ton of shit for speaking out against the Iraq War, and for being one of the most outspoken celebrities when it came to Iraq. Do you feel somewhat vindicated for that now?\n\nListen, you don\u2019t get any prizes for being right in this country. In fact, many people that got it wrong, the consequences of which were hundreds of thousands of deaths, many of these people that got it wrong did not suffer any consequences for that\u2014in fact got promotions. Some of them are still around on the news channels.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty maddening to see former Bush administration officials on the news. You have Nicolle Wallace hosting a show on MSNBC, David Frum as an MSNBC contributor and senior editor of The Atlantic. I mean, this is the \u201cAxis of Evil\u201d guy. These people are acting like authorities on politics with these huge platforms and they were central cogs in one of the worst administrations ever.\n\nI totally agree with you, and you should write that! Meanwhile, by the way, you will never see Noam Chomsky on MSNBC. And by the way, the highest-rated host on MSNBC had his show taken off the air because he had voices on that were opposing it, and that\u2019s Phil Donahue. It\u2019s funny, because you can stand out against a lot of issues and not get a lot of heat for it\u2014except for war. War seems to be the one issue where everyone seems to climb onboard right away. It just happened in Venezuela recently, and thankfully there\u2019s some resistance to this crazy talk about going to war with Iran, but it seems to me that this is limiting freedom of speech. It\u2019s you can speak out about a lot of things but don\u2019t criticize going to war because there will be consequences.\n\nDo you regret supporting Ralph Nader in 2000?\n\nNot at all.\n\nNo?\n\nNo. I regret that the Democratic Party didn\u2019t fight harder and the Supreme Court made them stop counting votes. I think they should have fought that. And I have to say, I don\u2019t like groupthink of any kind, and I don\u2019t buy into this blaming of anyone that supports the third party and that\u2019s why we\u2019re in the situation we\u2019re in. You can never assume that someone who voted for Nader\u2014or voted in the last election for Jill Stein\u2014was going to vote for Al Gore or Hillary Clinton. That\u2019s an assumption you don\u2019t have the right to make. I voted for Hillary Clinton from a defensive posture, because I knew from living in New York what an awful person Trump was, but I don\u2019t get why there\u2019s such a rabid \u2026 in order to change this and make sure it never happens again, I think some self-reflection is in order, and when you have Super PACs like the one David Brock runs whose sole purpose is to attack and marginalize people on the left for not falling in line, you shouldn\u2019t be surprised that those people aren\u2019t enthusiastic about your candidate. I don\u2019t understand why there\u2019s so much energy being used right now to attack one of the most popular candidates running right now with one of the biggest bases of support.\n\nYou\u2019re talking about Warren or Bernie?\n\nI\u2019m talking about Bernie. Say what you will about him, whether you want to support him or not I don\u2019t care, but I don\u2019t understand the strategy, because this is your base! These are the people knocking on doors that could make a difference in an election, and to be marginalizing them and attacking them because they support a candidate that you don\u2019t like, for me, is not very wise. I don\u2019t understand it. I just want to say that if you want to talk about unity and stopping this movement toward fascism, you can\u2019t be attacking people that could change things.\n\n\u201c Um\u2026yeah, I think we\u2019re all allowed to make a mistake or two. And by the way, none of them would give refunds. Honestly, there\u2019s no\u2026I made a mistake. \u201d\n\nSay what you want about Bernie but it\u2019s undeniable that he\u2019s completely recalibrated the Democratic Party and pushed their agenda further to the left.\n\nYou talk about experts that are on our news channels, and I\u2019m sorry but they got it wrong the last time. I would like to see some self-reflection and some humility. It\u2019s something that needs to happen in order for us to not wind up in this situation again, but I don\u2019t see a lot of self-reflection. I see them being touted as \u201cexperts\u201d again and I fear that we\u2019re headed down exactly the same road that got us into this in the first place.\n\nMany of your political moves have made sense but the one thing that confused me was the 2006 political donations to Republican congressional candidates like Michele Bachmann. It just seemed out of character, at least from an outsider\u2019s perspective, and I\u2019m curious how those came to be.\n\nUm \u2026 yeah, I think we\u2019re all allowed to make a mistake or two. And by the way, none of them would give refunds. Honestly, there\u2019s no \u2026 I made a mistake.\n\nBut what even led you to do that?\n\nI think it had something to do with the Democratic candidates they were running against having supported the Iraq War, and I must have read an article suggesting that these people were moderates and blah blah. What I find curious about this is, it\u2019s a $500 donation and I\u2019ve talked about this so much. I\u2019m always curious when people bring it up because for me it\u2019s a non-issue, and I think in bringing it up people are trying to say that I\u2019m a supporter of Republicans, which is not true.\n\nI don\u2019t think anyone believes you\u2019re on the side of Republicans. But it is a strange blurp.\n\nIt is a strange blurp but \u2026 how many years ago was that? Thirteen years ago and we\u2019re still talking about it? I don\u2019t get it. Is it to discredit me, is that what it is?\n\nIt\u2019s not to discredit you but it\u2019s something I\u2019ve been curious about because it seems pretty inconsistent with your views, and I\u2019ve never had the chance to discuss it with you so I was curious how it came to be.\n\nWell, it\u2019s something that I regret and as I said, I\u2019ve asked for refunds but they never gave any.\n\nYou initially backed Bernie in 2016. Are you still on the Bernie train for 2020?\n\nI\u2019d rather not talk about that right now because I want people to see this film, and in January I\u2019m going to be traveling around the country with The New Colossus, a new play I\u2019ve developed about immigration. I\u2019m really looking forward to that dialogue opening up.\n\nCan you tell me a little about that?\n\nIt\u2019s 12 actors from 12 different parts of the world speaking in 12 different languages about their ancestors\u2019 migration from oppression to freedom. I have an acting company with people from all over the world, and we started this project a couple of years ago. It\u2019s essentially the story of us; the story of what the circumstances are for people who choose to leave their home countries and find a way to this country. And at the end of the show, I or someone else comes out and we check in with the audience and ask, \u201cHow many people here are Native American?\u201d Hands go up. \u201cHow many people\u2019s ancestors were brought here against their will?\u201d More hands go up. \u201cAre there any refugee immigrants in the audience?\u201d People hold up their hands, and I ask them where they\u2019ve come from. \u201cAre there any children of immigrants or refugees?\u201d \u201cGrandsons or granddaughters of immigrants or refugees?\u201d More hands go up. And within a few minutes, the entire audience has raised their hand. And then I ask people to share some of their ancestors\u2019 experiences, and we hear extraordinary stories about the amazing courage it takes to leave your mother country, and then have the strength and tenacity to make it through the border, and then to have the strength, tenacity, health and courage to travel to a brand new place and start a new life, and then have the strength to survive there. That is the DNA of our country. We should be talking about immigrants and refugees as people who are deeply inspiring to all of us, and it should be celebrated as an act of courage. These people are fuckin\u2019 heroes.", "description": "The Oscar-winning actor/filmmaker opens up to Marlow Stern about his new film \u201c45 Seconds of Laughter,\u201d infighting on the left, and those pesky 2006 GOP donations.", "authors": ["Marlow Stern", "Senior Entertainment Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570167236/190927-stern-tim-robbins-tease_axcvhp", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
