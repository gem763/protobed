September is arguably the busiest month in fashion, not only for the luxury brands showing on their allotted slots in fashion month but for fashion enthusiasts as well.\n\nAside from the numbers of fashion editors, bloggers, celebrities and influencers trolling the streets of the various fashion capitals, fashion lovers on social media were equally busy as usual. The fashion memes are always enjoyable, but this month\u2019s other quirks have been the talk of the social media fashion streets.\n\nFrom New York to Paris, these are the top quirks that caught the attention of social media users.\n\nREAD MORE: Best of Paris Fashion Week so far - Yves Saint-Laurent used the Eiffel Tower as a backdrop and it was glorious\n\n\n\nMemorable model walks\n\nThe walks of various models have received much attention from the crowd-exhilarating walks to those that shocked viewers.\n\nThe walk that is making the rounds at the moment is one that has been deemed meme-worthy from the Maison Margiela show, where model Leon Dame gave a statement walk that British Vogue editor-in-chief Edward Enninful calls \u201ca moment!\u201d\n\nSharing what it took to execute this walk on the day, Leon tells Vogue: \u201cI already had something on my mind, but I worked it out during the rehearsals with Pat Boguslawski [a movement director] the night before the show.\u201d\n\nThe walk attracted much attention on social media and was used in witty fashion memes such as the one below.\n\nhow i think i walk in public with my headphones on vs how i actually walk pic.twitter.com/Lakq1cRrSN \u2014 c (@chuuzus) September 26, 2019\n\nA flash back to Zendaya and Tommy Hilfiger\u2019s New York Fashion Week show, model Alton Mason lit up the runway in a snakeskin suit \u2013 identical to the one Zendaya wore herself. Alton stole the show (and everyone\u2019s hearts) as he danced down the runway playing an invisible guitar but the star moment was when he bust out the gwara gwara mid walk.\n\nHelen Mirren running down the runway barefoot is one moment that cannot be overlooked. With the biggest smile in a black and white Giambattista Valli dress the English actress showed up in an energised run for the L'Or\u00e9al Paris show and brought so much joy to the audience.\n\nREAD MORE: These 5 Instagram influencers over 50 you should follow show us how true it is that 'greys' have more fun\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Fashion Week Frog\n\nOne of the highlights of fashion month was the launch of the Fashion Week Frog. This hilarious account, and somewhat relatable to those who work in fashion, has the fashion community in comforting comedy.\n\nThis account's first post is dated 2 September at the inception of fashion month and since then has accumulated more than 10 000 followers.
