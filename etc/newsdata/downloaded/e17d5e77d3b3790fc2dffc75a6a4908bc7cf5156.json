Roughly 3 \u00bd hours after arriving at the hospital by ambulance, the patient was dead, according a patient care inspection report by the Pennsylvania Department of Health.\n\n\u201cThis was a rare event that occurred in our emergency department at WellSpan York Hospital,\u201d Vice President of Medical Affairs Dr. Allan Birenberg said in a statement Friday night. \u201cWe take seriously our commitment to provide safe, timely, compassionate care to everyone who walks through our doors.\n\nStudy: Women may be under-diagnosed for Alzheimer\u2019s, while men over-diagnosed\n\nHacienda HealthCare sexual-assault case: Who is nurse Nathan Sutherland?\n\n\u201cIn this instance, we did not meet the high standards to which we hold ourselves every day.\u201d\n\nWellSpan York Hospital was determined to be out of compliance of Pennsylvania\u2019s Medical Care Availability and Reduction of Error Act after a special monitoring visit was made Aug. 22, 23 and 30.\n\nBy law, the hospital was supposed to report the death within 24 hours. An interview confirmed that the report was not entered until after the facility conducted a \u201cRoot Cause Analysis,\u201d which is in violation of the law that states the \u201creport will not be delayed for peer review or other quality investigating activities.\u201d\n\nFile photo of WellSpan York Hospital (Photo: File image)\n\nA tragic timeline\n\nAccording to the timeline in the report, the patient arrived by ambulance to the hospital at 9:59 a.m. Aug. 16, complaining of nausea. The triage notes said the patient had complained of dizziness since the night before and had a history of vertigo. The patient\u2019s temperature was low, and staff was having difficulty getting a pulse oxygen reading.\n\nAt 10:15, staff determined the patient had no signs/symptoms of sepsis and an acuity level of 3 was given. Triage was completed.\n\nFive minutes later, the acuity level was downgraded to 2.\n\nAt 10:25, the patient\u2019s vital signs were heart rate, 120; respiration, 28; and blood pressure, 115/89.\n\nBetween 10:25 a.m. and 12:05 p.m., the patient\u2019s name was called three times and the patient failed to respond each time. After the third time, the patient was marked LWBS (left without being seen), and the person\u2019s name was removed from a tracking board.\n\nAt approximately 12:25 p.m., the patient was found to be unresponsive, according to the report, and moved to a private treatment room. The patient was pronounced dead at 1:31 p.m.\n\nInvestigators also turned to security camera footage, which showed that the patient had their oxygen discontinued when they were transferred from the ambulance stretcher to the wheelchair.\n\nFootage shows vital statistics being taken by a nursing assistant, but that the pivot nurse (responsible for identifying each patient and comparing to tracking board) never spoke with the patient.\n\n3 NICU babies die: Pennsylvania hospital says a waterborne bacteria may be to blame\n\n\u201cAt no time was any staff observed to complete Rounding on [the patient] as per their Rounding policy,\u201d the report states. \u201cNo movement by the patient was noted from approximately 11:09 a.m. until approached by staff at 12:20 p.m.\u201d\n\nThe report shows that two other patients, with less-severe ailments, were triaged, examined and discharged while the patient in question was still in the waiting room.\n\n\u201cWe have reviewed what happened and taken immediate steps to correct any issues which contributed to this event,\u201d Birenberg said. \u201cWe are committed to doing our very best, every day, for every patient, and we will continue to work hard to make sure that happens.\n\n\u201cTo that end, we continue to redesign our processes to ensure access to high-quality, timely care for all.\u201d\n\nSteps to be taken\n\nWellSpan York Hospital had until Oct. 14 to implement its plan of correction:\n\nNurses have been reassigned in the department to make sure there is 24/7 coverage in pivot and triage areas.\n\nA nurse has been assigned to reassess patients in the lobby area, whenever the length of stay in the lobby exceeds one hour.\n\nThe hospital contracted for 15 traveling nurses. Six positions have been filled and the hospital is recruiting to fill the remaining spots.\n\nUS workers spend $7,685 a year on health: Here's how to make your costs more manageable\n\nNo patient will be taken off of the tracking board without physical confirmation of their departure.\n\nAll patients arriving by ambulance will be taken directly to a private bed or to triage. Anyone with an acuity of 2 or greater will be given a bed.\n\nYork Hospital held emergency department town halls twice in September to reinforce the changes and give staff the chance to discuss them. Nearly 100 staff members attended the meetings. Those who couldn\u2019t were given the information in smaller groups or in newsletters throughout the month.\n\nFollow Shelly Stallsmith on Twitter: @ShelStallsmith\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/12/er-death-report-dying-patient-pennsylvania-er-hours/3957828002/", "description": "A WellSpan York Hospital\u00a0called the death, which authorities say was not immediately reported, a \"rare event.\"", "authors": ["Shelly Stallsmith", "Published P.M.
