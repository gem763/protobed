Medium-term outlook still calls for higher gold prices as central bank buying remains strong and the Fed appears to be locked into an easing cycle, despite their hesitation to say so.\n\nGold hit a string of more-than-six-year highs earlier this month as stocks sold off in August with the U.S.-China trade war worsening, but has pulled back this month as equities have steadied. Gold is down around 1% so far this week and 2% since the end of August.\n\n\u201cSo, unless risk appetite turns sour again, or the dollar slumps \u2014 say, as a result of hawkish ECB or a very poor U.S. CPI report tomorrow \u2014 gold could extend its losses further,\u201d said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, in a note, referring to the August consumer-price index.\n\nAnd gold looks more vulnerable to further weakness than silver, he said, \u201cgiven the rosier sentiment towards risk assets, with (silver) being supported by its other main use as an industrial material. Hence, or otherwise, the gold-silver ratio has been falling, making silver more appealing (or less attractive to the sellers) in the short term.\u201d\n\nIn other metals trading action, December +1.20% rose $25.90, or 1.7%, to $1,580 an ounce, while October platinum PLV19, +0.61% gained $7, or 0.8%, to $943.60 an ounce.\n\nDecember HGZ19, -0.70% lost 0.6% to $2.6135 a pound.\n\nAmong exchange-traded funds, SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: ) GLD, +0.50% edged up by 0.2%.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes only.
