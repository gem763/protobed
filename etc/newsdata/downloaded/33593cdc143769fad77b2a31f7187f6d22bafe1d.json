There will be a risk of frosts in the morning and some early fog.\u201d\n\nToday's amber weather warning covers large parts of south Wales until 11am.\n\nThe Met Office says flooding and transport disruption are likely.\n\nMeanwhile less serious yellow weather warnings remain in effect in other parts of the country until 3pm.\n\nThese cover the rest of Wales, the Midlands, parts of northern England and the south west.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe Government's Flood Information Service has 13 flood warnings where \"immediate action is required\", across Yorkshire, the Midlands, and into Wales.\n\nEarly on Saturday morning, Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service said crews had been sent to people who had driven into flood water.\n\nThe service tweeted: \"Large volumes of flood water in North Devon are making driving conditions hazardous. Fire & Police have attended a number of people who have driven into floodwater. Drivers are asked to respect road closures, not diverting to minor roads which are more treacherous. Avoid travel.\"\n\nHumberside Police said a number of roads were impassable due to flooding and urged drivers to avoid the area around the B1246 at Warter.\n\nMeanwhile, a burst of \"polar maritime air\" is also expected to bring colder temperatures to northern parts of the nation on Saturday, before hitting the rest of the country on Sunday and into next week.\n\nThis is expected to bring colder weather, with the first widespread frost of the season anticipated over the weekend, as well as a dusting of snow on higher ground.\n\nUK five-day weather forecast\n\nToday\n\nHeavy rain clearing slowly southeastwards from England and Wales. Colder conditions with sunny spells following, but also scattered showers, these frequent in the northwest. Windy in the south at first, and also in the far north.\n\nTonight\n\nRain finally clearing the southeast around midnight, to leave a dry night with clear periods and colder than recently. Windy with showers in the north and gales on some coasts.\n\nSunday\n\nDry with sunny periods in central and southern areas. Windy with occasional showers in the north, the showers turning wintry over high ground in northern Scotland later.\n\nOutlook for Monday to Wednesday\n\nLargely settled with sunny spells for most. Just the odd shower in the east and northeast. Rather cold with overnight frosts. Possibly turning more unsettled from the southwest midweek.", "description": "The Met Office has issued an amber weather warning today before a cold front pushes its way across the country", "authors": ["Joshua Taylor", "Image", "Aled Llywelyn", "Met Office", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20727967.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-UK-Weather-Wales.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
