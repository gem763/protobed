It now has no solid timeframe for launch.\n\nFellow newcomer TymeBank is gaining customers, but there are questions on whether it can make money.\n\nDiscovery Bank too has interested customers \u2013 but has yet to prove that people will trust it with their salaries.\n\nFor more stories go to www.businessinsider.co.za.\n\nThe last of three disruptors to announce plans in recent months to compete in the increasingly crowded retail banking market is quietly delaying its launch, as faster movers grapple with how to make money in a soft economy.\n\nBank Zero, a start-up by mostly former First National Bank (FNB) staffers chaired by venture capitalist Michael Jordaan had planned to launch this month, but it\u2019s pushed out that launch, probably to next year.\n\nThere is no new time frame at this stage.\n\n\u201cWe will communicate the latest in a few weeks. A big milestone is coming up for us,\u201d said Bank Zero CEO Yatin Narsai.\n\n\u201cProgress is solid but I'm very reluctant to do a soft launch as this adds lots of complexity. Our focus is to get the full value proposition.\u201d\n\nBank Zero is furiously testing systems and Narsai says his team remains \u201cextremely focused\u201d.\n\nThe reality is starting any new business is hard. That\u2019s all the more true in the current SA environment.\n\nTymeBank, which recently replaced its CEO and bolstered its board with former Nedbank executives including ex CEO Tom Boardman as its deputy chairperson, is growing rapidly. It has 740,000 accounts, but fewer than half are deemed active.\n\nNearly half its active customers are over 35, which is not something it expected when it launched. Its offering, in partnership with Pick n Pay, appears to be gaining traction as it ties into the Smart Shopper scheme.\n\nIt has not, however, disclosed its financial position.\n\nThe sustainability of these new banking startups will lie in their ability to make money. The market is awash with speculation about Tyme\u2019s cash burn-rate and just how tolerant its parent African Rainbow Capital (ARC) can afford to be as it evolves from a single-product, low-cost transactional bank to offering higher margin products. The bank says it has been tasked with achieving break-even by 2022.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe would like to pilot a simple and ultra-low-cost small business account this year, only to selected existing consumer customers,\u201d says CEO Tauriq Keraan. It\u2019s also now looking to microlending as a revenue stream.\n\nDiscovery Bank launched in June and at last count had 22,000 customers, with plans of signing up thousands more weekly. There again, deposit levels are fairly modest, suggesting most new customers are wary of fully committing to it until they have experimented with the platform.\n\nCritical to the success of any bank is trust. Without it, customers will not deposit their salaries into their accounts regardless of the number of gimmicks, rewards, and incentives on offer.\n\nConvincing customers to shift their primary transactional banking to a brand new player is hard and can take months as people run parallel accounts before either committing to the new operator or reverting to their existing provider.\n\nNews of the Bank Zero delay broke as business confidence data suggested a collapse in corporate confidence and raises questions about the viability of new players in a depressed economy.\n\nBruce Whitfield is a multi-platform award-winning financial journalist and broadcaster.\n\nThis article was updated to correct a reference to Tom Boardman, who is the deputy chairperson of Tyme Bank rather than the chairperson.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "Bank Zero has delayed its launch.
