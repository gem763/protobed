A brief soaking rain is likely in D.C. area Wednesday from developing storm.", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nNational Weather Service rainfall forecast for Wednesday.\n\nA rapidly strengthening coastal storm now appears likely to dispense several hours of moderate to heavy rainfall in the Washington region Wednesday between late morning and the evening commute.\n\nThe storm, which will turn into a powerhouse when it reaches southern New England, will generate enough rain to put a small dent in the area\u2019s drought. The most likely rainfall in the immediate area is between 0.7 and 1.1 inches.\n\nIf these projections are correct and around an inch of rain falls, it will be the most since Aug. 7, when 0.9 inches fell, or even since the 3.44-inch deluge of July 8. Since mid-July, Washington has racked up a rainfall deficit of about 6.5 inches compared to normal.\n\nRain timing\n\nThe Wednesday morning commute should be dry before rain rapidly overspreads the region between midmorning and noon from southwest to northeast. By early afternoon, it should be raining everywhere.\n\n\n\nForecast radar from high-resolution NAM model Wednesday.\n\nThe heaviest rainfall is expected during the mid- to late-afternoon hours, especially along the Interstate 95 corridor and to the east.\n\nThe rain should then exit the region from southwest to northeast between 4 and 7 p.m.\n\nShould a Game 5 be required between the Nationals and Cardinals at Nationals Park, the planned start time of 4:08 p.m. may need to be pushed back by up to a few hours.\n\nPredicted amounts\n\nModels have come into better agreement, compared with Monday, that most of the immediate area should receive at least half an inch of rain from this event. Models also agree that amounts will tend to be lowest west and southwest of Washington, or around 0.25 to 0.75 inches, and highest to the east and northeast, where up to two inches could fall.\n\nHere are forecast amounts for Washington from the models:\n\nEuropean: 1.3 inches\n\nAmerican (GFS): 0.5 inches\n\nNAM: 0.8 inches\n\nHigh-resolution NAM: 0.5 inches\n\nHRRR: 0.7 inches\n\nCanadian: 1.0 inches\n\nHigh-resolution Canadian: 1.3 inches\n\n\n\nThe NAM model projects 0.8 inches of rain in Washington on Wednesday.\n\nTemperatures and wind\n\nThe cloudy, rainy skies will put a lid on temperatures Wednesday, with highs of only 60 to 65 degrees \u2014 falling into the upper 50s during steady rainfall. While the rain is falling, winds should mostly be light from the south, around 5 to 10 mph but with occasionally higher gusts.\n\nHowever, as the rain ends early Wednesday evening and the storm starts cranking up off the coast, winds will increase from the west and northwest. By sunset, winds may be sustained around 15 to 20 mph, with gusts between 20 and 35 mph.\n\n\n\nForecast wind speeds Wednesday at 8 p.m. from the HRRR model.\n\nGusty winds are likely to continue in the storm\u2019s wake Thursday, when winds may continue gusting to around 30 mph into the late afternoon. With high temperatures only near 60 degrees, it will be quite a blustery day \u2014 more like November than October \u2014 and the coldest day of the fall so far.", "description": "Around an inch of rain may fall.", "authors": ["Jason Samenow", "Editor", "Writer Covering Weather", "October At Pm", "Jason Samenow Is The Washington Post S Weather Editor", "Capital Weather Gang'S Chief Meteorologist.
