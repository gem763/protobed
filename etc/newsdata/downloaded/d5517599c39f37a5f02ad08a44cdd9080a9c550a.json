Telecoms in 18 countries will roll out 5G networks by the end of this year, and by 2020 over one-fifth of the world's countries will have launched 5G services.\n\nBusiness Insider Intelligence\n\nSecuring global 5G leadership is a national priority for many countries because the winner is expected to secure more than a decade of competitive advantages. The spread of 5G is pivotal for the connected world \u2014 its technical upgrades will supercharge adoption of transformative technologies and strengthen the value of old ones.\n\n5G will serve as the backbone of the fourth industrial revolution, and the global pacesetter for the new standard could become the same for connected technologies. All told, 5G technologies are expected to contribute $2.2 trillion to the global economy over the next 15 years.\n\nIn the Global 5G Landscape Report, Business Insider Intelligence identifies three countries \u2014 the United States, South Korea, and China \u2014 that are spearheading the 5G revolution. The report compiles 5G snapshots of the three countries, with each providing an overview of the market's telecoms space and details on what is contributing to \u2014 or hindering \u2014 its development. We look at the notable telecoms in each geography and identify their 5G launch efforts, as well as discuss what the opportunities are for each company.\n\nThe companies mentioned in this report are: AT&T, China Mobile, China Telecom, China Unicom, Ericsson, Huawei, KT, LG, LG Uplus, Nokia, Samsung, SK Telecom, Sprint, T-Mobile, Verizon, and ZTE\n\nHere are some of the key takeaways from the report:\n\nThe United States launched the world's first commercial 5G services in 2018 and will have twice as many commercial 5G deployments as the next leading nation by this year's end. The US is replicating the private-sector-led strategy it rode to 4G dominance to continue its leadership into the 5G era. This approach provides operators with autonomy over their own deployment strategies and methods, which fuels competition and ultimately drives innovation and investment as a result.\n\nSouth Korea was the second country in the world to deploy a 5G network, and it's on track to become the global leader in 5G penetration. Its speedy 5G deployment is the result of its government taking a hands-on approach in regulating the telecoms industry. South Korea's 5G subscriber base has already eclipsed 4G's growth rate in the first two months since 5G services launched in the country.\n\nChina is the largest mobile market in the world and is expected to become the biggest 5G market by connections by 2025. Chinese government bodies are backing a range of policy initiatives to push the country to the front of the global 5G pack. China's three state-owned network operators are ramping up trials and tests to meet the country's launch target for the first phase of commercial 5G services later this year.\n\nIn full, the report:\n\nIdentifies the three countries with a leading position in the global 5G race and provides an overview of the wireless industry in each country.\n\nDetails the distinct strategies the countries are taking to define the future of 5G connectivity.\n\nDives into the notable telecoms in each geography and provides an in-depth overview of their 5G launch efforts, as well as discusses what's ahead for each company and why it's worth watching.\n\nInterested in getting the full report?
