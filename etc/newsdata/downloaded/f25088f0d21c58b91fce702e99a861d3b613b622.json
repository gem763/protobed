We recently announced an investment of \u00a314bn more in schools over the next three years to 2022-23, allowing schools to invest more in teachers and resources \u2013 such as library provision \u2013 to ensure all children get the top-quality education they deserve.\u201d", "description": "Around one in eight schools do not have a designated library space \u2013 and those with a higher proportion of poorer children are more than twice as likely not to have one, a study has found.\u00a0 Campaigners have warned that\u00a0there is an \u201cinequality of access and opportunity\u201d that needs to be dealt with so that all children in the country can benefit from what a school library has to", "authors": ["Eleanor Busby"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/15/08/istock-944631208.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
