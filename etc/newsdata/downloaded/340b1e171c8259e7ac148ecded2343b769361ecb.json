If Trump tried to use military aid to Ukraine as leverage, as reporters are now investigating, then he held Ukrainian and American security hostage to his political vendettas. It means nothing to say that no such deal was reached; the important point is that Trump abused his position in the Oval Office.\n\nIn this matter, we need not rely on a newspaper account, nor even on the complaint, so far unseen, of a whistle-blower. Instead, we have a sweaty, panicked admission on national television by Trump\u2019s bizarre homunculus, Rudy Giuliani, that he did in fact seek such an investigation on Trump\u2019s behalf. Giuliani later again confirmed Trump\u2019s role, tweeting that a \u201cPresident telling a Pres-elect of a well known corrupt country he better investigate corruption that affects US is doing his job.\u201d\n\nLet us try, as we always find ourselves doing in the age of Trump, to think about how Americans might react if this happened in any other administration.", "description": "", "authors": ["Tom Nichols", "Theatlantic.Com Ideas Archive Trumps-Ukraine-Call-Clear-Impeachable-Offense"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
