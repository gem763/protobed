Two teams come to China each year for the pre-season games.", "description": "Shanghai (AFP) \u2013 The NBA and Brooklyn Nets abruptly cancelled a media event in Shanghai on Tuesday as the American basketball league struggles with", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/07/94df02_nba-commissioner-adam-silver-has-pressure-speak-out-strongly-in-defence-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
