There haven't been very many updates since he went to jail nearly a year ago, but this week, Tekashi gave his testimony in the racketeering case against Anthony \"Harv\" Ellison and Ajermiah \"Nuke\" Mack, who Tekashi allegedly \"associated with.\"\n\nHarv was accused of kidnapping Tekashi in 2018, which he denied and pleaded not guilty to in November last year. Nuke is charged with selling drugs, including heroin, fentanyl, and ecstasy.\n\nDuring Tekashi's testimony this week, he pointed out alleged members of the Nine Trey gang that appeared in his music videos and said that his role in the gang was to \"keep making hits.\" In return, he claims he'd get \"street cred\" and \"protection.\"\n\nTekashi also described his alleged kidnapping by Harv and Harv's friend, Sha, and reportedly \"choked up\" during that portion of his testimony. (According to Tekashi, his relationship with Harv tanked early on in 2018 when they disagreed about how Tekashi's earnings were being used.)\n\nShortly after he testified about the alleged kidnapping, a video of the incident surfaced. The video is distressing, so we're not going to include it in here, but Tekashi claimed the kidnapping took place at 4 a.m. when Harv allegedly drove a stolen car into a Chevy Tahoe that Tekashi was in.\n\nTekashi said Sha allegedly opened the car, pointed a gun at him, and told him to give him whatever he had with him and get in their car. He claims he recalled, \"I\u2019m pleading my heart...yo, don\u2019t shoot.\"\n\nView photos Photo credit: Bob Levey - Getty Images More\n\nEventually, Tekashi claims Sha suggested that he and Harv \"do this n*gga right here.\" Tekashi said Harv agreed, but they ultimately let him live because he gave them his jewelry, which they had to go get from Tekashi's daughter's mom.\n\n\n\nWhen they allegedly didn't let him out of the car at her house, Tekashi said that a few blocks later, he jumped out the car, ran, jumped into the backseat of a random car sitting at a stop sign, and told them \"bro, I\u2019m about to die. Just drive!\" when they didn't initially listen to him.\n\nSomehow, the random person ended up right behind Harv's stolen car, but Harv apparently didn't notice Tekashi hiding in the backseat.\n\nSome have claimed that Tekashi staged the whole kidnapping to get more publicity for his \"Fefe\" song with Nicki Minaj. Tekashi may be cross examined by Harv's lawyers this week.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "\"I\u2019m pleading my heart ...yo, don\u2019t shoot.\"", "authors": ["Shannon Barbour"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/mVMZc8mL9kjPzXiQJn9pRw--~B/aD0xNDQwO3c9Mjg2OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmopolitan_438/a0697a5ab3117bac8b1712fcec196359", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
