Between his Fox News show and his website, The Daily Caller, he definitely knows how to make a splash. Couple that with his incredibly popular books, and the man has a name.\n\nHowever, it seems he may be finished debating the Second Amendment. At least, that\u2019s what he says.\n\nNo, he\u2019s not turning his back on guns, gun owners, or the Constitution. Instead, the debate has become something else entirely.\n\nFox News host Tucker Carlson debated former Clinton pollster Bernard Whitman on the topic of gun violence in cities like Chicago and Baltimore. However, Thursday night\u2019s heated \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight\u201d discussion ultimately left the Fox News host seemingly bewildered and apologizing to his audience for putting them through Whitman\u2019s \u201cstupid\u201d arguments. \u201cWhy are the places with gun bans, Chicago and Baltimore, for example, so much more dangerous than places where so-called assault weapons are common like Vermont or New Hampshire?\u201d Carlson asked as they began the discussion. \u201cYou have to look at where the guns are coming from,\u201d Whitman said. \u201cIn Chicago, 60% of the firearms that Chicago police seize are coming from states like Indiana with very weak gun laws. In New York City and New York state, 74% of the guns seized are coming from states with weak gun laws. In New York City alone nine out of 10 guns purchased and used quickly come from states with lax gun control laws.\u201d\n\nWhitman went on to rationalize that the reason Indiana doesn\u2019t have higher crime is that all the guns have been taken to Chicago.\n\nYes, really.\n\nCarlson later ended the interview saying that he may well be done with debating the Second Amendment, telling the audience, \u201cThis might be my last gun control debate. It\u2019s too stupid. I\u2019m sorry to inflict that upon you.\u201d\n\nThe video for your own personal amusement:\n\nIn truth, I can\u2019t blame Carlson. Whitman\u2019s argument is beyond insane. Especially when he\u2019s parroting the talking point of \u201cinternet sales\u201d and \u201cgun show loopholes\u201d that Carlson was trying to debunk. He didn\u2019t want to hear that.\n\nBut we\u2019re expected to hear that the reason Indiana isn\u2019t as violent on a per capita basis than Chicago is either because guns are leaving Indiana\u2013which isn\u2019t true as there are still plenty of guns in Indiana\u2013or because there are more people there. Of course, the \u201cmore people\u201d argument is negated by the fact that this is per capita. In other words, the rate per 100,000 people. Cities like Chicago and New York are always going to have more raw numbers of crimes than Podunk, Arkansas and we all know it, so we use the per capita rate to normalize things for comparison.\n\nWhitman can\u2019t be that stupid. He has to understand this.\n\nWhat he clearly didn\u2019t understand, though, was the topic at hand. No wonder Carlson finds these debates to be so stupid. They kind of are.\n\nThough, in the interest of fairness, Carlson didn\u2019t get everything right either. My understanding is that he started off the segment by saying that Beto O\u2019Rourke wanted to come door-to-door to confiscate guns. That\u2019s not entirely accurate. Remember, Beto thinks he won\u2019t need to do any such thing. So no, he\u2019s not saying any such thing and Carlson really shouldn\u2019t be claiming he did.\n\nOf course, compared to what Whitman spouted, that\u2019s a big old nothingburger if ever there was one.", "description": "Fox News host Tucker Carlson said on Thursday night that he might be done with Second Amendment debates after one that he said was \"just too stupid.\"", "authors": ["Tom Knighton", "Author'S Bio", "Tom Knighton Is A Navy Veteran", "A Former Newspaperman", "A Novelist", "A Blogger", "Lifetime Shooter.
