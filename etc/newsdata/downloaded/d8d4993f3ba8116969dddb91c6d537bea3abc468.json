That move could, just possibly, foretell the long-awaited resurrection of value stocks\u2014but it definitely highlights the risks of betting big on any particular investing style.\n\nInvestors and financial advisers have been flocking to bundles of stocks, bonds and other assets that share certain characteristics of risk and return. Such portfolios, often called \u201cfactor\u201d or \u201csmart-beta\u201d funds, have boomed to $1.07 trillion in assets as of this Aug. 31 from $690 billion at the end of 2016, says Ben Johnson, a research director at investment-research firm Morningstar.\n\nThe granddaddy of all factors is value investing: buying stocks that are cheap in relation to their earnings, net worth or other yardsticks. Value funds buy low and hope to sell high.\n\nMomentum funds are the mirror image of value: They buy stocks with the hottest recent returns and, often, dump those that have had the lowest performance lately. Momentum funds buy high in hopes of selling even higher.\n\nValue stocks tend to be dull and sluggish in the short term but have tended to outperform the overall market in the long run. Perhaps because people seldom feel like paying much for boredom, value stocks are often underpriced\u2014making them bargains for investors with the patience to stick around long enough. Since 1926, value stocks have earned an annual average of 2.9% more than higher-priced growth shares.\n\nMomentum stocks, however, bristle with excitement. As they race upward, they tend to look expensive. However, some end up doing even better than investors expect. That leads momentum stocks, too, to do better than the market overall in the long term.\n\nOver two days this week, momentum strategies lost about 6% even as value gained roughly 8%, says Nicolas Rabener of FactorResearch, a firm in London that analyzes performance across investing styles.\n\nWhat triggered the shift? Spooked by the concerns around pending stock offerings like that of We Co., the parent of office-sharing company WeWork, investors might be starting to favor the steady profits that value stocks can provide, says Mr. Rabener. Other analysts point out that even a slight uptick in longer-term interest rates makes momentum stocks riskier.\n\nPortfolio managers often joke that momentum stocks \u201ctake the escalator up and the elevator down.\u201d It might be more accurate to say they take the escalator up and the elevator down\u2014with its cables cut.\n\nEspecially after market crashes and amid sharp fluctuations for stocks as a whole, momentum strategies can deliver near-lethal losses. In March and April 2009, a momentum portfolio that held the biggest recent winners and sold the worst recent losers suffered a cumulative 69% loss\u2014even as an epic bull market was already underway.\n\nWhy own momentum at all? It not only outperforms for investors with the guts to hold on long enough, but tends to do well when other investing approaches do badly.\n\nThis year through the end of August, various momentum indexes were up 20% or more, roughly doubling the performance of value stocks and well ahead of the S&P 500\u2019s gain of 18.3%.\n\nMomentum\u2019s mini-crash this week is a reminder that owning any factor in isolation is risky. Sometimes momentum is hot, sometimes value is in vogue. Or stocks with high dividends may be all the rage. Shares that fluctuate less than average, and companies with high, steady profits and low debt, are often the belles of the ball.\n\nAll these factors seem to work over time, but they can\u2019t all work all the time. As inflation, interest rates and economic growth change, some factors do better while others do worse.\n\nOver an investing lifetime, the price of long-term gain is short-term pain. And the short term can seem like forever. After a factor gets publicized and packaged into mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, its returns can go into reverse for years.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Do you think value stocks, after a long stretch of underperformance, are finally making a comeback? Join the conversation below.\n\nSo spreading your bets across factors is essential, says Andrew Ang, head of factor-based strategies at BlackRock Inc., which manages about $236 billion in factor portfolios.\n\nSome exposure to momentum would have helped value investors, whose strategy has underperformed for most of the past decade. For years now, advocates of value investing have been proclaiming its impending recovery as fervently as members of religious cults predict the imminent arrival of salvation from outer space.\n\n\u201cValue has done so badly this year and last year, despite the recent gains, that it remains significantly below the market,\u201d says Mr. Ang. But he isn\u2019t quite ready to declare that the recent swing signifies \u201cthe green shoots of the resurgence of value.\u201d\n\nSo, if a financial adviser has assembled a portfolio of factor funds for you, make sure it isn\u2019t heavily skewed toward any one factor. The alternative? Own an index fund that owns the entire market at rock-bottom cost.", "description": "\u2018Smart-beta\u2019 funds are a booming business.
