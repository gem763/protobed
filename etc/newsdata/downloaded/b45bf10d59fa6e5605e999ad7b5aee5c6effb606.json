Some of the most popular styles are from the Ming, Song and Tang dynasties.\n\nHanfu enthusiasts doubled to two million in 2018 from a year earlier, according to a survey by Hanfu Zixun, a popular community account on the Wechat social media platform.\n\n\u201cEveryone wants to share what is beautiful, and has spread the word via platforms like Little Red Book, Weibo and Wechat,\u201d said Dai, who only gave her last name, a public relations manager at Chong Hui Han Tang, a 13-year-old national chain of Han clothing stores.\n\nLi donned her first gown in March and has lost count of the Hanfu outfits in her wardrobe, she says.\n\nLi was inspired to buy Hanfu by an account dubbed Nanzhi999, which has 1.1 million followers on the Douyin short video social media platform. A tall slim man posts videos on this account in which he is dramatically transformed into a beautiful young woman in traditional Chinese gowns.\n\nMany Hanfu followers like the clothes for the fashion statement, but some, Li included, say its significance is greater.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s to propagate China\u2019s traditional culture,\u201d said another girl, who only gave her surname, Li, at an event to mark Chinese Valentine\u2019s Day in Beijing last month.\n\nThose who have studied Hanfu say the movement is a mix of history and fantasy, said Kevin Carrico, author of \u201cThe Great Han\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very much taking a modern concept and projecting it into the past,\u201d he said.\n\nHanfu practitioners say they are apolitical, although they point to instances where Hanfu gets support from the government.\n\nThe Communist Youth League organised a Chinese National Costume Day for the first time last year urging people to share their ethnic outfits online. Hanfu also aligns with President Xi Jinping\u2019s call to promote traditional Chinese values.\n\nSlideshow (17 Images)\n\nWhat keeps people reaching for their Hanfu outfits is often more personal.\n\nSince starting to wear Hanfu, Li Doudou said she has attended a class on traditional tea ceremonies. She is also planning to learn to play the \u201cguqin\u201d, an ancient seven-stringed zither.\n\n\u201cThe biggest change for me personally is it gives me more self-confidence,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I wear Hanfu, I feel like I\u2019m the most beautiful person in the world.\u201d", "description": "Li Doudou's grey kitten squeezes in next to her as she sits painstakingly applying makeup and putting up her hair in a bun adorned with elaborate ornaments.", "authors": ["Huizhong Wu", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1431804893&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J021", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
