He also arranged for a man he knew to rape her in his flat - and stood in the bedroom watching while it happened.\n\nThe defendant would go on to repeatedly rape one of the girls he had fathered with his first victim, again using mysticism and witchcraft to control her.\n\nJudge Paul Thomas QC told the defendant he had carried out a \"horrific campaign\" of manipulation and rapes against his own daughters.\n\nHe said: \"What you did to your family over a period of around 20 years plumbed the depths of depravity. You behaviour was utterly wicked. You have left your victims, your daughters, with their lives in pieces... You sexually abused and raped three of your daughters.\"\n\nHe told the defendant he had \"cynically and mercilessly\" taken advantage of the females for his own sexual gratification.\n\nThe judge said the defendant had consigned the daughter he fathered children with to a life which amounted to a \"form of sexual slavery\".\n\nJudge Thomas said the man had then denied all the offences, and tried to paint himself as the victim of the piece.\n\nBut during his trial he claimed both the daughter he had fathered six children with and her daughter had blackmailed him into having sexual relationships with them. He said he had no choice but to go along with what they wanted, and said he still loved his wife.\n\nHe claimed the other daughter he had raped as a teenager was simply making up the allegations against him in the hopes of getting compensation.\n\nBut the jury did not believe him.\n\nAt the sentencing hearing barrister Craig Jones read impact statements from two of the defendant's victims.\n\nThe first victim, the daughter the man had fathered children with, said he had tricked, fooled and abused her to such an extent that she thought what was going on was \"a normal upbringing\".\n\nShe said she had never learned what true was, and \"my life has been a big secret\".\n\nShe said: \"It wasn't until May this year I realised what a monster he was\".\n\nThe woman added that as a result of the truth coming out her children had been taken off her and \"My children were the only things I loved and was proud of - because of him I have lost them\".\n\nIn the second statement read to court another of the defendant's daughters said she had been \"made to feel small in a big world\" and abused by someone who should have been protecting her.\n\nShe said she had kept the abuse secret for many years but now \"Telling the truth about what happened has finally set me free from him\".\n\nHe told him: \"You are as cowardly as you are wicked.\"\n\nThe defendant was made the subject of a 40-year extended sentence comprising 33 years in prison, and seven years on licence. He will have to serve 22 years before he can apply for parole but will only be released if the authorities consider he is no longer a danger. He will be a registered sex offender for the rest of his life.\n\nThe man who the defendant arranged to rape one of his daughters had previously pleaded guilty, and awaits sentence.", "description": "The man fathered \"at least\" six children with one of his daughters, who he began abusing when she was just 14, Swansea Crown Court heard", "authors": ["Jason Evans", "Image", "Getty Images Istockphoto", "Media Wales Ltd", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article11588266.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PROD-Slavery-figures.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
