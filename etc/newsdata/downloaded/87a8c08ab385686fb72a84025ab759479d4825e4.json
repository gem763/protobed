(That\u2019s a hood to you and me.)\n\nBen\u2019s daughter, Jenifer Sands Scott, answered my call for old car stories and Ben\u2019s certainly is one. The Austin-Healey became a beloved family member.\n\nThe car competed in several races in Morocco until Ben was given his next assignment and moved with his wife, Mary Lou, to Omaha. Then came Chicago, the Pentagon and an 18-month tour in Saigon in 1968 and 1969. \u201cThe Healey, meanwhile, was stationed in a barn on his family\u2019s property in eastern Tennessee,\u201d Jenifer wrote.\n\nAfter retiring from the Air Force, Ben worked as a professor at George Mason University (despite the fact that he\u2019d never earned an undergraduate degree). After retiring from GMU, he had the time and money to give the Healey a new life.\n\n\u201cDad and the Healey were reunited at the family home in Vienna, Va., in the 1980s,\u201d Jenifer wrote. \u201cIt got a fresh paint respray from Healey Surgeons of Hyattsville in 1984. Then in 2016, Dad and my younger brother, Jon Sands, brought the car to Classic Car Solutions in Stafford which took the car back to showroom condition. It has since been entered in the Britain on the Green car shows held at Gunston Hall and Sully Plantation in Chantilly.\u201d\n\nThe Healey is now in Jon\u2019s father-in-law\u2019s house, being well cared for.\n\nBen Sands died on Feb. 14, 2019, one day shy of his 91st birthday. Wrote Jenifer: \u201cThe car and its story sum up my Dad pretty well: a charmed life well lived.\u201d\n\nMike Levin also acquired a British car overseas: a flame-red 1949 MG TC, purchased in Oxford, England, in October 1964. It cost 50 pounds, money that Mike took out of the generous scholarship funds he had at his disposal while earning a master\u2019s degree at Wadham College. An engine rebuild \u2014 at the original Morris Garage around the corner from the college \u2014 cost another 80 pounds.\n\n\u201cYou could tell it was an MG overhaul because they still painted the engine block gold when they finished, to show they did a first-class job,\u201d wrote Mike, of the District. \u201cStill, she dripped oil everywhere until we figured out her oil gauge was stuck at empty and stopped trying to top her off. Double-checking her petrol level was not a problem \u2014 I just lowered a wooden rod down her vertical rear tank.\u201d\n\nThe car transported Mike and his soon-to-be-wife, Jean, throughout the Cotswolds.\n\n\u201cI wanted to bring her with us when Jean and I sailed back to the States in 1966, but experts advised that most of her parts would disappear during the voyage,\u201d wrote Mike.\n\nAnd so he sold the MG to a nice young freshman who promised to give her a good home.\n\nWrote Mike: \u201cBritish cars carry the same license plate from birth. When I logged onto the U.K. registration system last year, her number appeared to be active. Far as I know, at 70 she\u2019s still running.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @johnkelly\n\nFor previous columns, visit washingtonpost.com/john-kelly.", "description": "A Moroccan Austin-Healey and a veddy English MG: More car stories from readers.", "authors": ["John Kelly", "Local Columnist"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JUKIBQGM74I6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg"}
