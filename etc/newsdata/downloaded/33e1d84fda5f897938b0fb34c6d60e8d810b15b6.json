The story reverberated across social media, with some observers saying it implicated the besieged Trump administration in a new ethical quandary.\n\nBut in a tersely worded statement issued late Friday, the CME \u2014 which regulates S&P futures contract trading \u2014 said it \u201cregularly monitors its markets for suspicious activity,\u201d and dismissed the allegations. A number of Wall Street analysts have also called the story\u2019s thesis into question.\n\nTrump\u2019s prolific use of Twitter to make policy statements routinely ratchets up trading volatility, one reason why the Vanity Fair article called into question some of the trading surrounding his tweets on market-moving events.\n\n\u201cAs it relates to the Vanity Fair article published on October 17, 2019, regarding activities in the E-mini S&P 500 futures contract, the allegations about the trading activity are patently false,\u201d the exchange said. \u201cThese transactions were entered into by a significant number of diverse market participants.\u201d\n\nIn the days since the article\u2019s publication, a few market observers have chipped away at its premise. Since futures are hedges against other market positions, it\u2019s likely a gain in one position just offsets losses in another.\n\nGeorge Pearkes, a global macro strategist for Bespoke Investment Group, wrote an analysis published by Business Insider that the E-mini trading represented \u201ctypical futures trading activity\u201d derived from multiple investors \u2014 and that it was virtually impossible to pinpoint exactly when those trades were executed, or by whom. He added that the article presented \u201cflimsy claims\u201d advanced mostly by antipathy toward Trump.\n\nIn an interview with Yahoo Finance on Friday, Cohan defended the observations he articulated in his article. He pointed out that traders who actively create positions in S&P minis were the ones who flagged the suspicious nature of the trades.\n\n\u201cHuman nature would dictate that if you were able to make $180 million profit on a smart trade in a few days or a week, you\u2019re going to take that profit and move on to the next thing,\u201d he told YFi PM.\n\n\u201cWe certainly don\u2019t know who placed these trades, and that\u2019s something the regulators should be looking into,\u201d Cohan said, backing calls for an investigation as \u201ctotally appropriate.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nJavier David is an editor for Yahoo Finance.
