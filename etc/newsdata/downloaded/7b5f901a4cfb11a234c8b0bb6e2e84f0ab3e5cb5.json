And over time we realized we shared much more than that: a vision to create opportunities for access to the sport for people that might not have it. With our support, Stephen is uniquely positioned to create meaningful experiences in golf.\u201d\n\nCurry also made news recently for refusing to side with pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong. On October 9, Curry, who has a long history of speaking out against human rights issues in the U.S., refused to talk about the abuses in China feigning a lack of knowledge on the issues.\n\nCurry later praised the NBA for its handling of the situation with the communist country, saying that the league did the right thing for its business relationships with the Chinese.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @WTHuston.", "description": "Golden State Warriors Star Steph Curry and golf equipment giant Callaway, have joined forces to encourage young people to take up the game.", "authors": ["Warner Todd Huston"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/AP-Photo_Andrew-Harnik-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
