(Image: Porsche)\n\nPorsche is probably the last company you\u2019d synonymise with \u201cmobility,\u201d since it said itself that the \u201cPorsche sports car will be one of the last automobiles with a steering wheel\u201d even after the world goes autonomous. But hey, everybody is a mobility company now, or wants to be \u2014 even Porsche. It\u2019s the hot new thing.\n\nIf you asked your dog and your dog spoke a language other than garbled barks, they would surely admit that they, too, are a mobility company. That\u2019s just life.\n\nMobility is on Porsche\u2019s mind for the future, the company\u2019s finance and IT boss Lutz Meschke, the same guy who gave heartfelt remarks about Porsches keeping steering wheels as long as possible in 2017, told Autocar recently. But Meschke also said Porsche won\u2019t be able to depend on selling cars as a means of survival as a company in the future, and that it has to work on investing in other means of transportation now.\n\nIt\u2019s a wise prediction, given that cities are slowly trying to filter cars out of the mould.\n\nThe same goes for governments and certain types of car power.\n\nFor Porsche, that means investing in companies attempting to solve issues of car traffic in cities. Porsche has to make money somehow, after all, and Meschke said that means thinking about \u201cinvestments, start-ups, [and] profitability in other businesses.\u201d\n\nFrom Autocar, which has more of Meschke\u2019s quotes here:\n\n\u201cCities want to reduce traffic, therefore we have to look for solutions which fit our brand. Shared mobility is not enough - it will not bring us significant profit share,\u201d said Meschke. \u201cIf you want to get a piece of the cake, you have to think about investments in other brands or in traffic solutions. [...] \u201cToday our customers are willing to buy two, three, four Porsches, but in future, maybe they will buy one or two and for mobility in cities, they will use other services. We have to think about business models that can balance these potential losses.\u201d\n\nThe story mentioned Porsche\u2019s relatively new subscription service, launching in 2017 with a limited audience and tiers that went for both $2,900 and $4,400 per month, and how Meschke called it a \u201cgood starting point.\u201d But it won\u2019t make up for the loss in car usage over time, he said, meaning Porsche has to get in on the money somewhere else.\n\nThat means investments into things like mobility, but Meschke didn\u2019t elaborate further than the above on what that means yet.\n\nRegardless, though, Meschke said something that sounded rather familiar in the Autocar story \u2014 that, of course, Porsche has \u201cto try to keep direct selling [cars] as long as possible.\u201d", "description": "Porsche is probably the last company you\u2019d synonymise with \u201cmobility,\u201d since it said itself that the \u201cPorsche sports car will be one of the last automobiles with a steering wheel\u201d even after the world goes autonomous.
