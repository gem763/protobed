That\u2019s thinking outside of the box,' enthused one, while a second admitted: 'That\u2019s pretty ingenious, actually!'\n\nAn anonymous woman (pictured), believed to be from the US, has caused a stir online after a photo of her self-made foot hammock went viral\n\nWhile many took to social media to praise the ingenious device, others slammed the passenger for causing a safety hazard on board the flight\n\nA third commented: 'I\u2019m not going to lie, I\u2019m impressed,' while a fourth added: 'That\u2019s genius, I\u2019m not even mad.'\n\nHowever, a select few took to the comments section to raise an issue with the safety hazards.\n\n'I guess the handle next to the door must not be used for this due to safety reasons,' wrote one, while a second penned: 'In front of the exit row door. Endangering hundreds of lives. Genius indeed.'\n\nA further added: 'If it wasn\u2019t so rude, intrusive, and dangerous, it\u2019s actually a smart idea. Too bad.'\n\nSeveral fans of the foot hammock jumped to the passenger's defense and praised her 'creativity' and 'genius' invention (pictured)\n\nBut others quickly jumped to the passenger's defense and offered nothing but praise for the ingenious device.\n\n'It's probably a safety hazard and not allowed but I have to give her props for ingenuity,' wrote one, while another admitted:\n\n'Honestly, I think she is brilliant. And. no, that\u2019s not a handle to operate the exit door as some people have speculated.'\n\n'And no, if there was an emergency, I\u2019m pretty sure she would wake up the same as every other person on that aircraft and comply with FA instructions. She is winning in my book!'\n\nA further added: 'I can think of lots worse things passengers do.'\n\n", "description": "An anonymous passenger. from the US, has divided the internet after creating a  hammock for her feet during her flight.
