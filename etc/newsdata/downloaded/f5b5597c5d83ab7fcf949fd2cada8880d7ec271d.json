(Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\n\nWashington Capitals defenseman Michal Kempny is not available for Thursday\u2019s game against Nashville, according to Coach Todd Reirden. Kempny, who has been recovering from a torn hamstring since April, has missed the first four games of the regular season, and the timetable for his return remains unclear.\n\nKempny is traveling with the team on its two-game swing to Nashville on Thursday and Dallas on Saturday, but Reirden was noncommittal about Kempny\u2019s status.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll continue to take every day as it kind of plays itself out,\u201d Reirden said. \u201cAnd he is getting a ton of action in practice now and full-speed battle drills, and as he reacts positively, he is getting closer and closer to being added back in our lineup.\u201d\n\nKempny, who was cleared for contact last week, said Wednesday he was a little \u201cscared or worried\u201d about competing in contact drills, but after going through a few practices, he said he feels a lot more comfortable. Kempny played in 71 games last season for Washington, with six goals and 19 assists before his injury cut his season short.\n\n[Capitals rally to force overtime but fall in the extra period again in loss to Dallas]\n\n\u201cYou know, a couple practices behind me with the contact, you know, with real paddles, I feel pretty good about it,\u201d Kempny said. \u201cStill need more practices and I\u2019ll be ready to go \u2026 you know, feel a lot better on the ice, a lot more comfortable about everything. Just focusing on myself right now and getting myself ready.\u201d\n\nWith Kempny\u2019s status still up in the air, the Capitals had a brief scare during Wednesday\u2019s practice, when defenseman Dmitry Orlov left the ice early. The team said Orlov suffered a lower-body injury, but leaving the practice was just precautionary. Reirden said Orlov is expected to play against Nashville.\n\nThe Capitals will have six healthy defensemen available against Nashville, pending any moves. Currently, Jonas Siegenthaler has been taking Kempny\u2019s place on the top pairing with John Carlson, with Orlov and Nick Jensen on the second pair and Radko Gudas and Tyler Lewington on the third pair in Tuesday night\u2019s game. Lewington played in his third NHL game Tuesday night, shifting Gudas to the left (his offside).\n\nThe defensemen have fared well without Kempny so far, helping the Capitals grab six of the possible eight points in the season\u2019s first week.\n\nSiegenthaler, 22, has averaged 17:01 of ice time alongside Carlson. He had a primary assist on Evgeny Kusnetesov\u2019s goal in Tuesday night\u2019s 4-3 overtime loss to Dallas at Capital One Arena and skated for 15:09 at even-strength Tuesday, getting 1:54 on the penalty kill. But he took another minor penalty while the Capitals were trying to protect a one-goal lead early in the third period, his fourth minor in four games.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to continue to work with him,\u201d Reirden said. \u201cHe\u2019s a young player developing, playing big minutes. We\u2019re working on improving his game and getting consistency to it. It\u2019s definitely a work in progress at this point of the year and continue to put guys in situations where you think they can succeed and if they don\u2019t then we\u2019ll try different options.\u201d\n\nRead more on the Washington Capitals:\n\nAlex Ovechkin throwing the first pitch before Game 4 deepens the Capitals-Nationals connection\n\nWe asked Capitals players to draw themselves (and other things)\n\nSvrluga: For the Capitals and Todd Reirden, the expectations are different, but the stakes are higher\n\nWith Nicklas Backstrom and Braden Holtby in contract years, Capitals could be facing an era\u2019s end", "description": "Capitals Coach Todd Reirden was non-committal about defenseman\u2019s status for Saturday\u2019s game in Dallas.", "authors": ["Samantha Pell", "Reporter Covering High School Sports", "October At Pm", "Samantha Pell Covers High School Sports For The Washington Post.
