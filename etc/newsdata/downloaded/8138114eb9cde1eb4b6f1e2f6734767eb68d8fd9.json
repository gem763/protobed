(HRB) recently was downgraded to Hold with a C+ rating by TheStreet's Quant Ratings.\n\nThis tax preparer got pounded last week on some massive volume. Since then, the stock has not been able to rally at all, telling us the big institutions are not involved here.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) has a steep slope downward, money flow is poor and the cloud is red. This stock has more down to go, probably into the teens.\n\nThis is a good short here.\n\nJetBlue Airways\n\nJetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU) recently was downgraded to Hold with a C+ rating by TheStreet's Quant Ratings.\n\nJetBlue is hurting, a good airline but just not getting the attention from the investing public. Money flow is weak, with the downtrend channel in place.\n\nThis stock may rally up to the $17 area, but that would be a good spot to get short. Moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is on a sell signal and the cloud is red.\n\nRSI is steep and sloping downward; this is another good short.\n\nThis commentary is an excerpt from \"5 Bearish Bets\" a weekly feature sent to subscribers of Trifecta Stocks.
