Col. Jason Rossi.\n\nThe floppy disks were being used in an extremely old system called the Strategic Automated Command and Control System (SACCS) which is used by U.S. nuclear forces to send emergency action messages from command centers to field forces and is largely safe from hacking due to the fact that it was invented before the Internet even existed.\n\nRossi discussed the security of the older hardware stating: \u201cYou can\u2019t hack something that doesn\u2019t have an IP address. It\u2019s a very unique system \u2014 it is old and it is very good.\u201d In 2016, the Defense Department stated that it planned to replace the old IBM Series/1 SACCS computer and \u201cupdate its data storage solutions, port expansion processors, portable terminals, and desktop terminals by the end of fiscal year 2017.\u201d It was not revealed by the Air Force if this project was completed but it did say that it has enhanced the speed and connectivity of SACCS.\n\nAlthough the system is extremely old, the Air Force is confident in its security and has been maintaining it pretty well over the years. Installing a brand new system could actually prove more difficult than maintaining the older one. Air Force Scientific Advisory Board chair Dr. Werner JA Dahm said in 2016: \u201cYou have to be able to certify that an adversary can\u2019t take control of that weapon, that the weapon will be able to do what it\u2019s supposed to do when you call on it.\u201d\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
