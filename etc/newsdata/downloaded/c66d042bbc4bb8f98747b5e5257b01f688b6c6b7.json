Here in the Broughton is no salmon left for the bears (and whales I must assume?).\n\n\"Advertising still shows the happy bears feasting on salmon, well, sorry to say - not here.\n\n\"We saw this sow with her two little ones a couple of weeks ago and then we saw her again only a few days ago. I have no idea how she would make it through the winter without salmon.\"\n\nWildlife observers fear the family will not make it through the hibernation period, particularly the Mamalilikulla First Nation group which has monitored the bears' progress for several years.\n\n\"They have drastically changed within a couple months,\" Jake Smith, a guardian watchman from the Mamalilikulla First Nation, told CNN. \"The bears are in trouble.\"\n\nThe bears hibernate from between five to seven months during the winter, relying on fat reserves built up throughout the rest of the year. If females begin hibernating without a certain level of fat it can affect many cubs they have, or whether they survive at all.\n\nStarving grizzly bear in Hoeya Sound walking along the low tide line Credit: Rolf Hicker More\n\nThe grizzlies' plight is tied to the dramatic decline in salmon, which is their main food source. Commercial fishermen in the province have said this year has been the worst salmon fishing season in almost 50 years.\n\nIn a bid to help the fish, Mr Smith arranged for volunteers to distribute 500 salmon along the shorelines of the grizzlies' habitats on Sunday. Mr Smith says the group will continue to monitor the bears' progress.\n\nA recent government report on the state of the Canada's Pacific salmon populations stated that the country\u2019s climate has been warming at double the global average in the last five years.\n\nIt found that marine heatwaves, warmer rivers and lakes, food web and other habitat changes have all been factors in the declining salmon population.", "description": "Emaciated grizzly bears spotted just a month before hibernation have sparked concerns over their future as warm weather hits Canada's salmon population.", "authors": ["Rozina Sabur"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2rAMtqAOi6akcyQ89XvKLg--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/c4825729b32d6dc1a979b6dd2076488c", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
