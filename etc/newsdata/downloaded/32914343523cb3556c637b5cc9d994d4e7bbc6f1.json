They must have the backing of at least two-thirds of MPs.\n\nIn other words, at least 434 MPs would have to give the green light to an early election.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Boris Johnson says the UK will leave the EU on 31 October \"deal or no deal\"\n\nSo, even if Mr Johnson wants an early election, there's no guarantee he would gain enough support.\n\nWho chooses the date?\n\nThe precise day of the election is in the prime minister's hands.\n\nWhen Theresa May called an early election in 2017, the motion that MPs voted on simply said: \"There shall be an early parliamentary general election\".\n\nThe important point is that it did not set out a specific date.\n\nWhile Boris Johnson is expected to call an election for 14 October, some MPs are worried the government could change the date and move the poll to after 31 October - by which point the UK would have left the European Union.\n\nBut assuming enough MPs do support an early election, the prime minister would then recommend the date of the poll to the Queen.\n\nOnce the date is known, Parliament shuts down - or dissolves - 25 working days before election day.\n\nAt this point politicians stop being MPs and they campaign for re-election, if they choose to stand again.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption UK general elections are normally held on a Thursday\n\nDoes the government have other options?\n\nFrom the government's point of view, the problem with needing two-thirds of MPs to support an early election is that it would require the backing of Labour MPs. Senior Labour figures say this is unlikely at the moment.\n\nBut it's not impossible for a government to get round this requirement.\n\nIt could be achieved by introducing a very short law that calls for an election and adds \"notwithstanding the Fixed Term Parliaments Act\". This would remove the two-thirds requirement.\n\nThis would be easier to pass as it would only require a simple majority of MPs to support it.\n\nIt could also provide a means of setting an election date in stone, says Catherine Haddon from the Institute for Government think tank.\n\nHowever, it would take longer for this law to pass as it would need to clear the House of Lords, as well as the House of Commons.\n\nThere's also a risk that the proposed law could be amended - allowing pro-remain MPs to make changes, such as forcing a further Brexit extension.\n\nHigh risk options\n\nThere is a third, extremely high risk option. If the government was absolutely determined to hold an early election it could, in theory, call a vote of no confidence in itself.\n\nIf it chose to do this, MPs would have to decide whether they want the current government to continue.\n\nIf such a vote passes, opposition parties would be allowed two weeks to come together to try to form an alternative government. If this happened, Mr Johnson would be expected to resign and a new prime minister could request a further Brexit delay to prevent a no-deal outcome.\n\nBut, if nothing is resolved after 14 days, a general election is automatically triggered.\n\nHowever, this would be a high stakes strategy, as it completely relies on opposition parties failing to form an alternative government.\n\nCatherine Haddon says the chances of the government calling such a vote is \"extremely unlikely\"\n\n\"From a political point of view, calling a voting for no confidence in yourself would look mad\", she says.", "description": "There is growing speculation an early election could be called.
