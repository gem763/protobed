The sumo wrestlers, crouched down in the centre of the ring, knuckles pressed into the sand beneath, launch forward in an explosion of rippling muscle and flesh. It\u2019s a move the they practice for hours on end, honing the direction of that first impact, where to place their arms, whether to target the gut, chest or throat. Once contact is made, the giants rise up in a shaking embrace as they attempt to engineer a dominant position for themselves. Forearms are thrown, rolls of fat snatched at, dust kicked up as the two sets of feet make dance. Eventually it\u2019s the smaller wrestler who emerges on top, inviting his rival to step forward before using his momentum to throw him out of the ring.\n\nThe fight, lasting little longer than 30 seconds, is over. The savage, violent brutalism is gone. In its place, an absorbing display of ritualised pageantry, both men bowing courtly to the crowds before the process starts over for the next tussle. The solemn recitations. The throwing of salt to purify the ring. The slapping of arms, legs and stomachs \u2013 demonstrations to prove the wrestlers are unarmed. And then, at last, the breathless eruption of violence. Sat cross-legged and shoeless in the lower levels of Tokyo\u2019s Ry\u014dgoku Kokugika, a squat, 11,000 seat arena nestled away in the east of the city, there\u2019s a mesmeric quality to the experience, one that drags you back in time to the sport\u2019s ancient past.\n\nBecause, unlike any other mainstream sport in Japan, sumo wrestling remains deeply wedded to its roots. The same set of rules and rites which applied when matches were performed in the Japanese Imperial courts, as far back as the eighth century, continue to influence today\u2019s proceedings. How exactly sumo started, historians are unsure. But links have been made to harvest rituals associated with the Shinto religion. That legacy can be seen in the use of salt purification and the stylised, shrine-like roof which covers the ring. \u201cIt\u2019s literally frozen in time,\u201d says John Gunning, a sumo columnist for the Japan Times.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIn many ways, sumo is more than just a sporting spectacle. \u201cIt\u2019s a lifestyle,\u201d says Jeff, a sumo ticket-seller and avid fan. \u201cIt\u2019s a religion, it\u2019s a cultural treasure. The sport has a mandate as a social and culture treasure that needs to be protected, preserved and carried forward \u2013 hence why the Japanese government [the Ministry of Education] supports the Sumo Association.\u201d\n\nAs a \u201clifestyle\u201d, sumo is all-consuming. Those who dedicate themselves to the sport are expected to train and live in shared stables, run by a \u2018stablemaster\u2019, until the point of retirement. No last-minute transfers, no loans. That\u2019s it. Waking up at around 6am, wrestlers will spend hours each day perfecting moves and grapples. Driving is not permitted \u2013 a status symbol and out of necessity, given their size. Younger apprentices are required to clean, cook and perform endless tasks for their elders. About 97 per cent of fighters are not paid, although accommodation and food is provided. Even mobile phones and girlfriends are technically banned below divisions 1 and 2, the sekitori ranks, though some leniency is creeping in. \u201cIt\u2019s a 24/7 thing, you\u2019re never not a rikishi [sumo wrestler],\u201d says Gunning.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

But for all its mystic appeal, the sport\u2019s cultural and social \u201cmandate\u201d has repeatedly set it on a collision course with controversy. The need to \u201cpreserve\u201d and \u201cprotect\u201d has, at times, taken precedent over the need to modernise, leaving sumo unmistakably out of touch with its surroundings.\n\nWithin the stables themselves, sumo\u2019s rigid rules and hierarchy have created a culture in which hazing and bullying can take root. The scandals have come thick and fast over the years. Only last month, one wrestler was suspended from the September basho, or Grand Tournament, while the Japan Sumo Association (JSA) investigated reports he had assaulted an attendant at his stable. Two years prior, Harumafuji, a former sumo grand champion, known as a yokozuna, retired after attacking a younger wrestler in a bar and fracturing the man\u2019s skull.\n\nThat incident threw sumo back to the darks days of 2007, when a 17-year-old trainee died after three wrestlers, under instruction from their stablemaster, beat the youngster with a beer bottle and a baseball bat. The stablemaster was sentenced to six years imprisonment for manslaughter while his three elders were also charged. It was a moment that shocked the sport, pointing to a sinister culture that hadn\u2019t previously been exposed.\n\nLee Thompson, a professor of sports science at Waseda University, sees sumo\u2019s violent side as a byproduct of wider society. \u201cViolence has been part of hierarchical relationships in Japan for much of the modern era,\u201d he says, \u201cbut now it is getting called out \u2013 and not just in sumo.\u201d Others, though, see it as more localised. One insider told The Independent that stable environments can be \u201ctoxic\u201d, dominated by aggressive, testosterone-fuelled young men who are often poorly educated. \u201cIt\u2019s like Lord of the Flies,\u201d he said. \u201cSumo has created an insular society that doesn\u2019t recognise and respect outside authority \u2013 it\u2019s lawless.\u201d\n\nThis mentality has left sumo equally susceptible to corruption down the years. After a lengthy police investigation, and having initially denied the allegations, the JSA admitted in 2011 that the sport had been subject to widespread match-fixing, with 13 senior wrestlers implicated. Links with the criminal underworld have also been uncovered. In 2010 the JSA suspended 18 fighters and banned one stablemaster for betting on baseball games in a gambling ring run by the yakuza.\n\nSumo\u2019s attitude towards women has similarly reinforced the perception of an out-of-touch sport. Women aren\u2019t allowed to compete, nor permitted to enter the ring. Last year, this particular rule left officials red-faced when two female nurses were scolded for rushing into the dohy\u014d to help a mayor who had collapsed while giving a talk at a sumo event in the Kyoto Prefecture. An apology was later made to the women but it demonstrated the sport\u2019s rigidity in adhering to its backward values. \u201cThe absurdity is obvious, but I don\u2019t believe the issue will be fixed anytime soon,\u201d says Shotaro Moore, a writer and sports blogger.\n\nThen there\u2019s the topic of concussion, an issue that has yet to be confronted. Compared to the likes of American football and rugby union, sumo is light years behind. One source told The Independent he has repeatedly seen \u201cclearly concussed\u201d wrestlers, who have been indoctrinated with the mentality of \u201csimply getting on with it\u201d, swerve medical care in the wake of fights.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a huge issue,\u201d says Gunning, who, as a former amateur wrestler, understands the inherent dangers. \u201cThere\u2019s no sparring in sumo. You fight at full pace and speed. So you\u2019re cracking heads \u2013 you get that coconut sound \u2013 again and again, 100s of times a day. You can see it in the older guys. Violent mood swings. Forgetfulness. All the same things the old footballers have.\u201d He adds that there\u2019s no been willingness from the authorities to tackle the issue as it \u201chasn\u2019t reached the public consciousness here\u201d.\n\nAs Japanese society has grown and modernised, it only feels right that a sport with so many shortcomings should find itself under the spotlight. \u201cThere are aspects of sumo that have become a difficult fit for modern life,\u201d says Gunning. But whether sumo is prepared to evolve for the sake of aligning itself with society remains to be seen. Advocates argue it is already adept at modernising, pointing to the fact it has had video-assisted refereeing since 1969, but on more pressing issues \u2013 the misogyny, the clandestine violence \u2013 progress seems unlikely. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot better than it used to be in most ways,\u201d adds Gunning, but he insists that the \u201cantiquated\u201d argument of \u201cit was OK in the past so it\u2019s OK now\u201d is wafer-thin.\n\nIs sumo therefore in danger of distancing itself from Japan\u2019s youthful, more progressive population? There are certainly some concerns of what the future holds, especially when the influence of today\u2019s digital age and competition from more enlightened, more modernised rival sports are taken into account. Equally, the conditions which have historically driven men towards sumo no longer exist. Long gone are the days when the security and shelter of stable life would draw in impoverished, hungry men from large rural families.\n\nBut in spite of all of this, sumo has something which its rivals don\u2019t. \u201cIt\u2019s distinctly Japanese,\u201d says Moore. The fierce attachment to its history \u2013 including the good, the bad, the ugly \u2013 continues to sustain the sport. \u201cIn a nutshell, it represents tradition, it literally puts it on display,\u201d Thompson says. \u201cThis is a large component of its popularity at home, where most of the population don\u2019t have much contact anymore with that kind of tradition.\u201d\n\nWith the scandal-hit years of 2007-2011 a thing of the past, it feels like the sport has recaptured the public imagination. \u201cIt\u2019s more popular now than it\u2019s ever been,\u201d says Gunning. Tickets for the six bashos, around 170,000 in total, are known to sell out in 45 minutes. The JSA is also facing endless requests to bring its domestic tours to towns up and down the country.\n\nThe ascension of Japan\u2019s star Kisenosato to champion yokozuna status in 2017, ending a 10-year dry spell for the country, will have equally helped drive engagement. So too the JSA\u2019s improved marketing efforts, having developed a social media presence for the sport, introduced an english-speaking website and stopped tours abroad to nurture interest at home. This revival in popularity has coincided with a surge in tourism numbers, with 31 million visitors to the country in 2018. A quintessential Japanese experience, sumo is often a \u2018must-see\u2019 sight for curious travellers, \u201cpresenting a comfortably exotic image\u201d of the country, says Thompson.\n\nAs the lines of modern culture become blurred and greyed under the endless, ubiquitous slosh of globalisation, sumo stands aside as something different \u2013 for better and for worse. But as long as the sport continues to embrace its past, in all its mysterious, complicated, alluring forms, it seems there will always be an appetite for this ancient way of life.", "description": "The initial collision is seismic.
