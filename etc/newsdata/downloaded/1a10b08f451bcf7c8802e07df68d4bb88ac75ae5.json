Which I'm psyched about because that's what I voted for. You can take a look at the before (Hall) and after (Bathroom) below:\n\nHouzz offered up 'inspiration designs' to assist in visualising the new space, and it was Ann Lowengart Interiors' bathroom design that garnered the most votes, with its opulent - if slightly oppressive - design.\n\n\"I think it\u2019s perfect because it has gravitas. That wallpaper really speaks to that formality,\u201d said Lowengart about the room, which is a real life renovation carried out in a similarly historic home. \u201cThe rest of the house is really light and bright and airy, but they wanted their powder room to be a real jewel box,\" she added.\n\nThe newly renovated Cluedo mansion will make its debut in 2020, which seems to have been pushed back from the original December 2019 date, but I'm sure you can keep it in your pants until then.\n\nThis post originally appeared on Gizmodo UK, which is gobbling up the news in a different timezone.", "description": "After opening up the vote to the public as to whether to revamp the longstanding Hall or replace it outright, the public has spoken.", "authors": ["Alex Choros", "Matt Hopkins"], "top_image": "https://edge.alluremedia.com.au/m/g/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-23-at-1.34.47-pm.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
