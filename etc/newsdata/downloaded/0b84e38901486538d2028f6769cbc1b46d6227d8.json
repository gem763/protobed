BizInsure's pitch is that its platform sees the small business client through from investigation to transaction.", "description": "Meet the future of small business insurance \u2013 it's online, profitable and growing quickly.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.0605%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_39/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f116104498e0fb6cca8d359f5d805a5d0e04943e", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
