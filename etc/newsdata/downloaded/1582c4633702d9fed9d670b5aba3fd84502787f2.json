Jurassic World re-tweeted the welcome news on Twitter, before making its own official announcement.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re back,\u201d the team captioned a picture of the holy trinity. \u201cWelcome to Jurassic World Alan Grant, Ellie Sattler, and Ian Malcolm.\u201d\n\nExcuse their typo, the crew\u2019s probably just very excited.\n\nThey\u2019re back. Welcome to Jurassic World Alan Grant, Ellie Sattler & Ian Malcom. #2021 pic.twitter.com/28jjkq7Y5P \u2014 Jurassic World (@JurassicWorld) September 25, 2019\n\nAs Malcolm once said: \u201cYou crazy son of a bitches, you did it.\u201d\n\nThe news was announced by director Colin Trevorrow during a screening of Jurassic World at the ArcLight Cinemas in Hollywood.\n\nAnd in some more good news, each star will reportedly have a \u201csizeable\u201d role in the movie, instead of brief cameos.\n\nDetails are thin, but Trevorrow is directing again and will co-write the script with Emily Carmichael. Trevorrow directed both Jurassic World and its sequel Fallen Kingdom. He also helmed that indie flick Safety Not Guaranteed and The Book of Henry. Carmichael has Pacific Rim: Uprising on her CV.\n\nTrevorrow actually just released a short film, which takes place after the events of the last Jurassic World film. It\u2019s called Battle at Big Rock and the story follows a family of four whose encounter with dinosaurs at the Big Rock National Park becomes a batshit fight for survival.\n\nThe short film stars Andr\u00e9 Holland, Natalie Martinez, Melody Hurd, and Pierson Salvador.\n\nYou can watch the entire thing on YouTube right now.", "description": "Bloody hell you guys,\u00a0Sam Neill, Laura Dern,\u00a0and\u00a0Jeff Goldblum\u00a0are all set to reprise their iconic roles in\u00a0Jurassic World 3.", "authors": ["Steffanie Tan"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-25-at-4.39.50-pm.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
