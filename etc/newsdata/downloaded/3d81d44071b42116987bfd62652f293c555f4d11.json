Once we are inside, he is keen to set foot on the stage where he will be performing next month, but his publicist cautions against any treading of the boards today. \u201cMaybe just look at it from the stalls,\u201d she suggests. \u201cHealth and safety and all that.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Rips along\u2019 \u2026 John Light as Pierre and Laurie Kynaston as Nicolas in Florian Zeller\u2019s The Son. Photograph: Marc Brenner\n\nA glimpse is enough to make him excited about the forthcoming transfer. \u201cThe play really rips along, and we don\u2019t get to catch our breath,\u201d he says once we are seated in the deserted bar. \u201cIt feels like a bullet fired from a gun.\u201d The appropriateness of that image will be apparent to anyone who saw The Son in its first UK production at the Kiln in London earlier this year. (It\u2019s part of a trilogy by Zeller, preceded by The Father and The Mother.) The hunting rifle given to Pierre, Nicolas\u2019s dad, by his own father, and later discovered by Nicolas, is like a twisted homage to Larkin: man hands on firearms to man \u2026\n\nAs the play starts, Nicolas, who lives with his mother, is reeling from his parents\u2019 separation. He moves in with Pierre, who now lives with a new partner and their baby, but this fails to arrest the boy\u2019s slide into depression. \u201cThe play feels like it has a series of red flags, and some people have asked, \u2018How could no one see quite how distressed Nicolas is? We could see it.\u2019\u201d The writing is on the wall \u2013 hence the idea of having Kynaston already on stage, scrawling words on one side of the stark white set while the audience files in. \u201cBut over a six-month period, there would\u2019ve been a lot of time when those things weren\u2019t happening and everything seemed normal. You can get used to that behaviour.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Series of red flags\u2019 \u2026 Kynaston in The Son. Photograph: Marc Brenner\n\nHe and the director, Michael Longhurst, came up with the graffiti idea, but the play\u2019s central metaphor \u2013 a trashed set to which the actors are oblivious \u2013 belongs to Zeller. \u201cThat\u2019s the point: people not noticing things that are right in front of them. We walk around the mess and even on top of it. We step on Lego, which is actually quite painful.\u201d\n\nKynaston offers no shortage of reasons why Zeller\u2019s work is so satisfying to perform: the playwright\u2019s slightly off-kilter word choices, or his knack for creating a family full of characters who don\u2019t quite fit into it. \u201cFlorian lets us get to know everyone and their frustrations. We\u2019re rooting for all of them.\u201d Something else makes The Son particularly special for him. \u201cYou know at the front of every script it has the original cast? Like \u2018Maggie Smith played this part in 1969 \u2026\u2019 It\u2019s always been a dream of mine to have my name there. And now it\u2019s happened.\u201d\n\nKynaston was raised on a small farm in north Wales. \u201cIt was the Shropshire border,\u201d he says when I inquire after his accent, \u201cso I\u2019ve got this neutral, RP-ish thing.\u201d He and his three older brothers had a \u201cvery outdoorsy, tree-climbing, jumping-in-ponds sort of childhood.\u201d He acted at school, joined the National Youth Theatre of Wales and has scarcely been out of work since. He made his West End debut in The Ferryman and played a young Johnny Marr in England Is Mine, for which he received the blessing of the Smiths guitarist. (\u201cI\u2019ve been told he\u2019s a good guy and did a good job,\u201d Marr told the Guardian last year.)\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018He\u2019s a good guy\u2019 \u2026 Kynaston, foreground, with Jack Lowden in England Is Mine. Photograph: Essoldo Pictures\n\nHe also played young Danny Baker on TV in Cradle to Grave and still counts the DJ as \u201ca very close friend\u201d, describing his sacking from the BBC as \u201cchaos\u201d. Baker had posted a tweet with what he said were unintended racist connotations. \u201cYou\u2019d hope people would pay the same attention to the apology as they did to what led to it,\u201d the actor says. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to slow that down once it\u2019s all under way.\u201d Next up are roles in the dystopian Amazon series The Feed and the film of Caitlin Moran\u2019s novel How to Build a Girl; Kynaston describes the latter as \u201cfull of punk and attitude and sass and humour and love and music\u201d.\n\nBy the time that is unleashed on the world, he will once again be fully up to his enormous eyes in Nicolas\u2019s turmoil, scribbling on the walls and trampling Lego underfoot, health and safety be damned.\n\nThe Son is at the Duke of York\u2019s theatre, London, until 2 November. How to Be a Girl premieres at the Toronto film festival on 7 September. The Feed starts on Virgin Media in the UK and on Amazon Prime Video elsewhere on 16 September.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.
