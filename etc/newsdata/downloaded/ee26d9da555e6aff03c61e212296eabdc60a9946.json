But wanting to unlock its rough, raw and even ugly side got her turfed out of Conservatoire. What will Sunday\u2019s Prom audience make of Ivan Fischer\u2019s daughter?\n\nHow do you catch the ear of one of today\u2019s leading composers? With your exquisite vibrato? With a three-octave range? In Nora Fischer\u2019s case, you scream. The soprano comes to the Proms on Sunday for the UK premiere of the Dutch composer Louis Andriessen\u2019s The Only One, a song cycle he wrote especially for her.\n\n\u201cWe met when I had a tiny role in his 2016 opera Theatre of the World,\u201d she tells me. \u201cI had a very high note marked to be sung \u2018screaming\u2019. I thought \u201coooh that\u2019s fun. I\u2019ll scream it.\u201d And so at the first rehearsal I did. This was at the Dutch National Opera \u2013 very posh and formal and everyone was like, \u2018Woah, what\u2019s going on? You don\u2019t do that in the opera house!\u2019 But Andriessen loved it.\u201d The composer, whose 80th birthday is celebrated at this year\u2019s Proms, told the young singer he was going to write her a piece. \u201cI thought, well that\u2019s a very nice compliment but that will never happen,\u201d she says, \u201cand then suddenly here we are! He said: \u2018I want everything you can do to be in it!\u2019\u201d\n\nI like singers who dare to be very raw, like Bj\u00f6rk or Thom Yorke, who are not afraid to sound rough and even ugly.\n\n\u201cEverything you can do\u201d casts a wide net for this versatile and genre-hopping singer. Now 32, the Dutch/Hungarian Fischer spent her teenage years a member of the prestigious Netherlands Youth Choir, and then moved to study singing at Amsterdam Conservatoire. A career as Susannas, Adinas and Rodelindas seemed assured. But things didn\u2019t work out. \u201cClassical singing is very beautiful but very specific. I meanwhile was developing an interest in all the other things my voice could do \u2013 I felt that I had such a rich instrument and I was only being taught to sing with 15% of it,\u201d she says. \u201cI was listening to a lot of other styles of music, and what I enjoyed most was the singers who dared to be very raw, like Bj\u00f6rk or Thom Yorke, incredible musicians and singers who are not afraid \u2013 if the emotion asks them to \u2013 to sound really rough and even ugly.\u201d\n\nChafing at the conservatoire\u2019s restrictions, she wanted to explore more creative approaches to performing classical music. It\u2019s our way or the highway, said the school, so they parted company.\n\nMind you, non-conformity is in her DNA. Her father is iconoclastic conductor Iv\u00e1n Fischer. \u201cHe is also someone who doesn\u2019t listen to the way it \u2018should\u2019 be. That\u2019s the whole reason he started his [Budapest Festival] orchestra,\u201d says Fischer.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018I try not to make any distinction between any of the music I do .... Nora Fischer. Photograph: Sarah Wijzenbeek\n\nBut with no courses specialising in new music and no obvious path to follow, Fischer was demoralised until she came across the vocal course run by Cathrine Sadolin, a specialist in how the voice works across a huge range of different styles, and how to use it healthily, whether you\u2019re belting out rock anthems or Bulgarian folk harmonies.\n\nShe spent six months at Sadolin\u2019s institute in Copenhagen. \u201cIt was so inspiring. It completely opened me up. The voice is such a rich instrument as long as you know what you are doing. The participants came from different backgrounds \u2013 folk, musical theatre, pop \u2013 I was the only classical singer,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was no sense of any one genre being better than any other, no one who was higher quality.\u201d\n\nWhat did her father make of this all? She laughs. \u201cHe was definitely worried at first. He kept asking me: \u2018Are you working on your technique?\u2019 I think he thought I was going down the drain! But then, when things picked up and I started to have work he began to trust that I knew what I was doing \u2013 even if he didn\u2019t!.\u201d\n\nToday, she is involved with a wide variety of projects that span centuries and genres, but are united by her delivery \u2013 direct and unmannered, the same pure clarity and intimacy whether she\u2019s singing Bart\u00f3k, Purcell or Morris Kliphuis, whose provocative 2017 song cycle The Secret Diary of Nora Plain has her yelping, wailing and whispering. Hush, released last year on Deutsche Grammophon, eloquently illustrates her innovative approach. Baroque ballads and arias, stripped of vibrato and ornamentation, and accompanied by an electric guitar, gain an immediacy and playfulness that makes them feel closer to pop and jazz.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying we should listen to early music only in that way, I\u2019m just saying, look, there\u2019s many ways of approaching this music, no one better or worse, there\u2019s just many options from which people can pick their favourites and get little glimpses of other ways of opening your mind, of looking at music.\u201d\n\nOpening her mind is not a phrase idly used. Meditation is part of Fischer\u2019s daily life and central to her wellbeing. The day we meet she\u2019s just back from a two-week silent retreat. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m a Buddhist, but it\u2019s a Buddhist philosophy \u2013 learning to let go, to enjoy the present and not attach to things \u2026 it\u2019s about understanding the way your mind works and the way we keep grasping things. It\u2019s not easy, but you realise how much we usually are not where we actually are because we are always thinking about other things, what\u2019s next.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m just saying, look, there\u2019s many ways of approaching this music, no one better or worse\n\nThe mindfulness has hugely affected her career, she says. \u201cI started noticing how I\u2019d get a booking for somewhere I\u2019d always dreamed of, and I\u2019d be so happy, but then by the time I was on stage there performing I couldn\u2019t enjoy it because I\u2019d be thinking of the next thing. It never ends. Now, it\u2019s such a relief to just be able enjoy the present but also not attach to things.\u201d\n\nSunday\u2019s Prom will be her first visit either as a performer or audience member. \u201cI know! I\u2019m sorry!,\u201d she jokes. \u201cI have no idea what\u2019s going to happen, but everyone says it\u2019s so much fun.\u201d\n\nAnd after the Proms? \u201cI don\u2019t have any future plans \u2013 I dropped all that!\u201d But she does admit to a few \u2013 touring a new Osvaldo Golijov piece with Yo Yo Ma\u2019s Silkroad ensemble, and in February, a semi-staging of Weil\u2019s Seven Deadly Sins with Simon McBurney in Los Angeles. \u201cWe\u2019ve had our few first sessions already in London this summer. He is IN-CRED-IBLE.\u201d\n\nShe doesn\u2019t need to worry about her future when extraordinary collaborators such as Andriessen and McBurney are seeking her out, drawn, surely, to her charisma and versatility. \u201cI try not to make any distinction [between any of the music I do] and just try to do it, however \u2018complex\u2019 it might be, in an accessible way. I think people often underestimate their audiences. I prefer to overestimate them! If you speak \u2013 literally and figuratively \u2013 to them then they can take so much more than you would think they can.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Nora Fischer is the soloist in the UK premiere of Louis Andriessen\u2019s The Only One at the BBC Proms, Royal Albert Hall, London, 8 September", "description": "The Dutch singer felt she was only using 15% of her voice.
