The move is a setback to the struggling post office network, because banking services are a vital source of income for many postmasters.\n\nIt is also another hammer blow to rural communities, which have been hardest hit by bank branch closures.\n\nThe Mail is campaigning to save rural post offices and the services they offer. More than 3,300 branches have shut their doors between January 2015 and August 2019, research by consumer group Which? found.\n\nBarclays, which made a \u00a33.5billion profit last year, has denied its decision is to do with cost-cutting and claims it is investing in schemes to help its customers access their money more easily.\n\nLast night a spokesman said: 'Our commitment means none of our customers will be without access to cash. Despite removing cash withdrawals, our financial contribution to the Post Office for the banking framework will actually increase in 2020.'\n\nIf you have been affected by Barclays' decision, write to moneymail@dailymail.co.uk", "description": "Barclays insisted its plans to stop customers from withdrawing money at post offices would not restrict access to cash despite widespread condemnation of the move, with MPs joining the backlash.", "authors": ["Matt Oliver", "Victoria Bischoff For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
