ADVERTISEMENT\n\nUnder the rule, any immigrant who receives at least one designated public benefit\u2014 including Medicaid, food stamps, welfare or public housing vouchers\u2014 for more than 12 months within any three-year period will be considered a \u201cpublic charge\u201d and will be more likely to be denied a green card by immigration officials.\n\nThe rule would also examine the likelihood of an immigrant using such benefits in the future.\n\nIn his 24-page ruling, Daniels said the Trump administration likely exceeded its authority.\n\n\u201cDefendants do not articulate why they are changing the public charge definition, why this new definition is needed now, or why the definition set forth in the rule \u2014 which has absolutely no support in the history of U.S. immigration law \u2014 is reasonable,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe rule is simply a new agency policy of exclusion in search of a justification.\"\n\nThe public charge rule had been the target of nearly a dozen lawsuits in federal courts across the country. The ruling marks a defeat for the Trump administration, which has sought to overhaul the nation\u2019s immigration system and limit legal immigration.\n\nIn his ruling, Daniels said the federal government did not give \u201cany reasonable explanation\u201d for changing the definition of a public charge.\n\n\u201cIt is repugnant to the American Dream of the opportunity for prosperity and success through hard work and upward mobility,\u201d Daniels wrote.\n\nExperts said the rule would have a chilling effect even on people who aren\u2019t directly affected, and could discourage permanent residents and even U.S. citizens from renewing or applying for benefits they are entitled to.\n\nThe final rule, which was announced in August, targets immigrants trying to enter the United States or those already living here who are trying to obtain a green card.\n\nThe rule explicitly would not apply to U.S. citizens, even if the citizen is related to an immigrant who would be subjected to the requirements. It also would explicitly exempt immigrants who have been granted asylum, lawful permanent residents and refugees.\n\nIn a separate, more limited ruling Friday, a federal judge in California issued a preliminary injunction blocking the public charge rule from taking effect only in certain areas where the plaintiffs had filed lawsuits.", "description": "A federal judge in New York\u00a0on Friday temporarily blocked the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cpublic charge\u201d rule linking immigrants\u2019 legal status to their use of public benefits.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/naturilzationceremony_immigrants_getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
