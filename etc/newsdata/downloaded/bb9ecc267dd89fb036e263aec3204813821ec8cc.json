We create opportunities through our defence to attack,\u201d said England coach Eddie Jones, who has masterminded the turnaround.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to pay the greatest compliment to New Zealand. They\u2019ve won two World Cups in a row. They\u2019ve been a really great team and and we had to dig really deep to beat them.\u201d\n\nEngland, world champions in 2003 when they beat an Australia side coached by Jones in the final, will now face the winners of Sunday\u2019s match between South Africa and Wales in next week\u2019s showpiece clash.\n\nTheir victory ended the tenure of All Blacks coach Steve Hansen, who is stepping down after overseeing a sensational run when they lost only 10 of 106 Tests.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Take that on the chin\u2019 \u2013\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really proud of our team. They\u2019ve done a tremendous job for their country and tonight we just weren\u2019t good enough,\u201d said Hansen.\n\n\u201cSo we have to take that on the chin and so does everybody back home and our fans.\u201d\n\nEngland led 10-0 at the break thanks to Tuilagi\u2019s converted try and the first of Ford\u2019s penalties after a superb forward effort led by locks Courtney Lawes and Maro Itoje saw them dominate territory and possession.\n\nAnother Ford penalty early in the second half made it 13-0 but the All Blacks eventually broke a defence coached by former New Zealand boss John Mitchell in the 57th minute, when Ardie Savea crashed over for a converted try.\n\nBut Sam Underhill\u2019s tackle on the recalled Scott Barrett led to a simple penalty in front of the posts that Ford duly kicked.\n\nJones had recalled Ford at fly-half following the 40-16 quarter-final win over Australia, moving Farrell to inside centre.\n\nBefore kick-off England, unusually, lined up in an inverted \u2018V\u2019 formation, crossing the half-way line as the All Blacks performed their traditional pre-match haka.\n\nAnd there were fewer than two minutes on the clock when England scored a brilliant team try.\n\nFullback Elliot Daly made a fine break down the right that was carried on by wing Anthony Watson before the ball was worked across field, with hooker Jamie George charging forward.\n\n\u2013 Disallowed tries \u2013\n\nFord then found prop Kyle Sinckler and he in turn released Lawes, who took the ball to the All Blacks\u2019 line.\n\nFrom the ensuing ruck, powerhouse centre Tuilagi \u2014 one of England\u2019s try-scorers when they last beat the All Blacks seven years ago \u2014 forced his way between guard props Joe Moody and Nepo Laulala for a fine try.\n\nFarrell converted and England led 7-0.\n\nThey almost had a second try minutes later when Tuilagi intercepted and found Farrell who passed to Jonny May.\n\nBut great corner-flagging by recalled flanker Scott Barrett stopped the wing in his tracks.\n\nEngland made several more early visits to New Zealand\u2019s 22 only for their own errors to cost them the chance of further points.\n\nUnderhill, who had a try against New Zealand last year controversially disallowed, went over in the 25th minute but referee Nigel Owens correctly ruled out the score for crossing by fellow flanker Tom Curry in the build-up.\n\nFord\u2019s drop goal attempt sailed well wide of the right post but he made no mistake with a 45-metre penalty after a limping Farrell was unable to take the shot.\n\nEngland thought they had their second try when, following a drive off an attacking line-out, scrum-half Ben Youngs went over after selling centre Anton Lienert-Brown a dummy.\n\nBut Owens ruled it out for a knock-on in the maul.\n\nAnother Ford penalty extended the lead but George\u2019s overthrown line-out near England\u2019s line was collected by Savea, with fly-half Richie Mo\u2019unga converting.\n\nThat, however, was as close as New Zealand got as two more Ford penalties created an unbridgeable gap for the defending champions.", "description": "Yokohama (Japan) (AFP) \u2013 Fly-half George Ford led the way as England ended New Zealand\u2019s eight-year reign as champions with a superb 19-7", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/26/0d2c13_england-beat-new-zealand-time-rugby-world-cup-england-stun-new-zealand-in-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
