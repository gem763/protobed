The decline is nearing support near the 200-day MA, and the 9-day RSI is oversold. Prices could probe the lower boundary, but a bottom is becoming likely. We could see a trend reversal around the October 30th Fed announcement.\n\nGold has been consolidating for about 6-week after peaking in September. The COT report remains near-term bearish with commercial shorts just off record levels \u2013 it will take time to work down those positions. The next buying opportunity in gold may not arrive until November. I have a minimum target of $1410 \u2013 $1420 and see the potential for a backtest of the June $1380 breakout area.\n\nAG Thorson is a registered CMT and expert in technical analysis.
