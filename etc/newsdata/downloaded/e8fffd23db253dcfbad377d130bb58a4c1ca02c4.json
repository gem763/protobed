She pleaded guilty at Leicester Crown Court to defrauding her mother of \u00a390,457, between May 2012 and March 2015\n\nShe disposed of all the contents including her mother's jewellery and photographs, spending the proceeds on shopping and meals out, as well as paying off her debts.\n\nAfter pleading guilty at Leicester Crown Court to defrauding her mother of \u00a390,457, between May 2012 and March 2015, Judge Nicholas Dean decided to spare bankrupt Joanne jail, and ordered her to pay back just \u00a31 - with the judge saying that 'shame' would be the greatest punishment she would face.\n\nHer lawyer told the court her abusive ex-partner had put her up to it.\n\nThe judge, giving her an 18-month jail sentence, suspended for two years, said he doubted the story about her evil ex.\n\nHe told her: 'I'm not sure I entirely accept he's the wicked individual in all of this, but there may have been some pressure.\n\n'I'm hesitating because you deserve to go to prison.'\n\nSpeaking from her small, one-bedroom flat in Gretton Court, a sheltered housing block in Melton, Susan said she could barely believe everything that had happened to her in the past decade.\n\nJudge Nicholas Dean gave Joanne Chiswell an 18-month suspended jail sentence and ordered her to pay back just \u00a31 - with the judge saying that 'shame' would be the greatest punishment she would face. (Susan Chiswell's home in Main Street, Glenfield that was sold by her daughter)\n\nShe said: 'Because she's spent all the money I don't know if I'll ever leave here - I'm only 68 and I'd love to be able to live in a house or a bungalow where I could have a cat but I can't do much with \u00a31 so I suppose I will have to stay here forever.\n\n'I'm going to put the \u00a31 towards my donation to the Poppy Appeal this year.'\n\nHer previous homes in the past 11 years included mental health units and the Hunter's Lodge residential care home in Melton.\n\nShe said: 'It's been 11 years since I've been in my house. I lived in Main Street in Glenfield but as well as selling the house, Joanne got rid of everything inside it.\n\n'She sold all my wedding jewellery, my mum's rings and my photos and everything else has gone. Everything I ever had.'\n\nLooking to her window sill where there are two small photographs of her parents, she said: 'They are the only ones I have left now.\n\n'That's all I have. They're from a small photo album I had with me.'\n\nAs well as many things of sentimental value, the items that disappeared from her home included her passport, driving licence and birth certificate, meaning she's struggled to open a new bank account and Leicestershire County Council is still in control of what money she has.\n\nDescribing how the problems began, Susan said: 'When my father died I had a nervous breakdown and I had a drinking problem. It all went to pot and Joanne decided I would be better off in a care home. She never thought I'd recover.\n\n'For five years I had to share a room. I had no contact with friends so at the care home I volunteered to sit downstairs with the visitors book just so I could get to speak to people.\n\n'Then one day at Hunter's Lodge the manager said, 'I've got news for you, she's sold your house. It was awful.'\n\nSusan now lives in a one-bedroom flat in Gretton Court in Melton (pictured). Her previous homes in the past 11 years included mental health units and the Hunter's Lodge residential care home in Melton. Susan said: 'When my father died I had a nervous breakdown and I had a drinking problem. It all went to pot and Joanne decided I would be better off in a care home'\n\nThe one good thing remaining in Susan's life through these years has been her son Mark, who is an older half-brother to Joanne and had been kept in the dark throughout Joanne's offending and called the police when he found out the house had been sold.\n\nSusan said: 'Mark was under the impression they were going to rent it out until I got better and could move back in.\n\n'I feel so lucky to have Mark and his wife and three children in my life still. If it wasn't for him I wouldn't have any furniture here. I don't know what I would have done without them.\n\nAfter everything she has been through, Susan has no interest in seeing her daughter again. She said: 'If she comes here she won't get in.\n\n'When my friends hear about what she's done they can't believe it's true. They can't believe what she's done.'\n\nShe said she hoped Joanne would lose her job with the NHS after the way she had defrauded her own mother.\n\nThe Proceeds of Crime Act is used to regain assets which were acquired through criminal means.\n\nWhen the available amount from the defendant is less than the amount they benefited by, the defendant is only ordered to pay the amount they have available.\n\nThis can mean, that even if a criminal benefited significantly from the crime, they may not have access to any assets, as in this case.\n\nThe judge will then order a minimal repayment, usually \u00a31.\n\nA spokesperson for the CPS said: 'In the case of Joanne Chiswell, the court determined she had no assets available to pay any confiscation order and issued a minimal repayment to reflect that.\n\n'If the situation changed and she was found to have assets at a later stage, the CPS would return the matter to court and request an increased confiscation order to recover those new assets, up to the full benefit amount.'", "description": "Joanne Chiswell, 41, from  Leicestershire, pleaded guilty to defrauding her mother of  \u00a390,457.
