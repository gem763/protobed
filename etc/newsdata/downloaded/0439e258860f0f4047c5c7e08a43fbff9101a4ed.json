The bank would facilitate transactions designed to appear to be purchases of food and medicine for \"humanitarian\" reasons when they were instead illicit transactions designed to get around sanctions placed on Iran.\n\nThe money, court documents allege, came from sales from Iran's national oil company to Turkey. Sanctions any U.S. anti-money laundering programs were meant to block proceeds of those sales from being returned to Iran. Instead, prosecutors said, Halkbank found ways to get those oil proceeds to Iran.\n\nTurkey has claimed the state-owned bank did not breach U.S. sanctions.\n\nThe charges are linked to a previous case involving a Turkish banker who is close toTurkish President Recep Erdogan.The banker, Reza Zarrab, was arrested in Florida in March 2016 for evading U.S. sanctions.\n\nBusinessman Reza Zarrab is surrounded by journalists as he arrives at a police center in Istanbul on Dec. 17, 2013. Ozan Kose\n\nZarrab, 33, and other financial professionals were charged with breaking U.S. sanctions and \"laundering the proceeds of those illegal transactions, and defrauding several financial institutions by concealing the true nature of these transactions.\"\n\nZarrab, a dual Turkish-Iranian national, struck a deal with prosecutors to cooperate and avoid trial, however.\n\nPrior to striking a deal with prosecutors, the then-acting U.S. attorney, Joon Kim, sent a letter in late March 2017 suggesting that Rudolph Giuliani and former U.S. Attorney General Marc Mukasey had joined Zarrab's defense team to \"explore a potential disposition of the criminal charges in the matter.\"\n\nAt the time, Kim raised his concerns that \"Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Mukasey's involvement in this case is intended to occur entirely outside of the Court's purview and knowledge.\"\n\nGiuliani and Mukasey had previously visited Turkey to discuss the case with Erdogan, a U.S. official directly briefed on the matter told NBC News.\n\nErdogan defended Zarrab when he was implicated in a 2013 Turkish corruption scandal that also implicated Erdogan associates. The Turkish leader called Zarrab \u2014 who had given his wife's charity $4.5 million \u2014 a philanthropist and praised his contributions to Turkish society. All charges against Zarrab and Erdogan's associates were dropped.\n\nIn 2017, Zarrab took the stand in a U.S. federal trial in New York to testify against a Halkbank executive who was arrested for his role in the scheme.\n\nHakan Atilla was ultimately convicted and sentenced to 32 months in prison for conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions.\n\nZarrab testified in court that he paid $60 million in bribes to the former economic minister of Turkey, and court records show that he was in close contact with the head of Halkbank, Atilla's boss.\n\nIn the most dramatic moment of the trial, Zarrab implicated Erdogan in the sanctions-evasion operation.\n\nErdogan, who asked both the Obama and Trump administrations to drop the case, denies wrongdoing and said the trial was a conspiracy by the U.S. to weaken Turkey.\n\nZarrab, who is married to a famous Turkish singer, is fabulously wealthy, according to court documents, which detailed how he was building a yacht longer than a football field with three personal submersibles.", "description": "The charges against Halkbank are linked to a previous case involving Reza Zarrab, a Turkish banker who was arrested in March for evading U.S. sanctions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/4236628/1000x563_nbc-170327-reza-zarrab-federal-indictment-sanctions-se-617p_82e7ffe1d832780244c9c952266288ec.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
