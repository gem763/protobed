So, here's a brief list of things you shouldn\u2019t do while high: driving on a motorway, online shopping, watching any Pixar film, PayPal-ing a friend, giving advice \u2014 but what about running or lifting weights?\n\nWhile everyone\u2019s reactions to cannabis\u2019 intoxicating qualities differ, and research into the subject is still new, there are a few things you should know before pounding the pavement while dabbling in cannabis.\n\nYou might be able to focus better\n\nYou might have heard of cannabis\u2019 magical benefits that include improved focus, endurance, performance and reduced soreness. According to Dr. June Chin, an integrated cannabis physician at MedLeaf RX, a lot of these benefits may be indirect \u2014 CBD products, in particular, may simply reduce inflammation and therefore increase your ability to focus or work harder by soothing any nagging pain you have.\n\nBut this inflammatory power doesn\u2019t have a strong scientific basis as of yet. A 2016 study following rats found that CBD might be useful in the relief of arthritis pain and inflammation (again, rats \u2014 not people), though a number of pro-athletes stand by their CBD products and improved performance on the field and court.\n\nHow To Cancel Your Gym Membership We get it \u2014 sometimes, a gym just doesn\u2019t work out. Maybe it\u2019s too crowded or the ceilings tiles are falling and landing on your head. It happens! Unfortunately, cancelling your gym membership is a lot like competing in the Hunger Games, of which there are no winners, only the wounded.

A pure sativa or indica plant doesn\u2019t exist, though there might be a sativa-dominant or indica-dominant strain. These plants have different cannabinoid makeups, and strains [like indica-dominant] can produce a more sedating effect or what we call \u2018couch-lock\u2019. Sometimes, people will use a more stimulating strain, and in marketing terms, sativa tends to be a little more energising.\u201d\n\nSo you might find that a sativa-based strain is better-suited to an hour at the gym; keep that in mind when you\u2019re shopping at a dispensary. The truth is, however, that there\u2019s very little research into this too and some researchers argue there isn\u2019t scientific validity to the differentiation. (One study even found that among over 80 cannabis varieties that were tested, mislabelling of indica and sativa content was a problem.)\n\nGo easy during your first workout\n\nIf you\u2019re using something like CBD for an anti-inflammatory purposes, you\u2019d have to experiment with it in order to find the timing that works best for you. \u201cIf you\u2019re you\u2019re training in the morning, maybe you\u2019ll take it at night before you go to bed,\u201d Chin says. \u201cSome patients want to take it after their training to offset that soreness the next day.\u201d\n\nAnd no matter what, make sure the workout you\u2019ve chosen is a light one to start with, Chin said \u2014 unless you want to risk greening out. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying it for the first time, I wouldn\u2019t go for that long run or that Crossfit class right away,\u201d she said. \u201cSome patients get nauseous on CBD. Some patients feel light-headed and you don\u2019t want to be stuck mountain biking thinking \u2018I\u2019m so sick.\u2019\u201d", "description": "With Canberra recently relaxing laws around consumption and growth of cannabis, we're here to give you some tips and tricks if you choose to partake in its use.
