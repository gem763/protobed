Many economists believe Prime Minister Narendra Modi's signature economic policies are at least partly to blame.\n\nA surprise demonetization in 2016 and a new goods and services tax have taken a dire toll on many businesses.\n\nInstead of improving government finances as intended, the GST and demonetization undermined India's financial stability, economists say.\n\nSitharaman said that new manufacturing companies incorporated after Oct. 1, will be taxed initially at an effective rate of 17%.\n\nAnalysts welcomed the move.\n\n\"The fiscal steps by the Indian government are likely to re-energize investor interest in the subcontinent,\" Jeffrey Halley of Oanda said in a commentary.\n\n\"India still has a non-performing loan swamp to drain, but this is most definitely a step in the right direction,\" he said.", "description": "The Indian government on Friday announced a slew of concessions aimed at boosting the economy that will reduce most corporate taxes for local companies to about 25% from 30%.
