It can not be appealed.\n\nThe case revolves around an Austrian politician, Eva Glawischnig-Piesczek, who sought to haveremove disparaging comments about her that had been posted on an Irish person's page. An Austrian court had found the remarks to be harmful to her reputation by insulting and defaming her.\n\nThe European Court of Justice ruled that Facebook must remove information as well as block access to that information worldwide.\n\n\"This judgment raises critical questions around freedom of expression and the role that internet companies should play in monitoring, interpreting and removing speech that might be illegal in any particular country,\" Facebook said in a statement.\n\nThe social network said the decision could force internet companies to proactively monitor all content and then interpret if it is \"equivalent\" to content that has been found to be illegal by one nation's court.\n\nFacebook FB \"It undermines the long-standing principle that one country does not have the right to impose its laws on speech on another country,\"said in its statement.\n\nBut Europe has fewer guarantees of free speech and much more restrictive laws related to privacy and a so-called \"right to be forgotten,\" established by the same European court in 2014, which allows EU citizens to request that links containing personal information about them be removed from search results.\n\nGoogle GOOG But just last week that court ruled in favor ofthat in most cases that right should apply only within the European Union\n\nIn that case France's privacy regulator had sought to extend the right beyond EU borders, a position opposed by media outlets, free speech advocates and tech companies.\n\nThe court acknowleged that other countries do not recognize the right to be forgotten, adding that protection of personal data is not an absolute right and must be balanced against other freedoms.", "description": "The top European court has ruled Facebook and other internet companies can be forced to remove certain content worldwide.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore", "Hanna Ziady", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181204095429-01-zuckerberg-eu-file-super-tease.jpg"}
