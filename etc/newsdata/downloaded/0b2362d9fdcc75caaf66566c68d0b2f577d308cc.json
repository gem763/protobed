Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast a gain of 10,000 jobs and an unemployment rate of 5.7%. Canada hit an all-time low jobless rate in May at 5.4%.\n\nThe Canadian dollar strengthened to C$1.3225 to the U.S. dollar, or 75.61 cents U.S., after the bigger-than-expected jobs gain.

The bank\u2019s next overnight interest rate decision is set for Oct. 30.\n\nIn September, the Bank of Canada said the economy was showing a welcome degree of resilience against negative shocks, in part because of the labor market. The bank has said it will continue to monitor future domestic economic data.\n\n\u201cThe big picture here is the job market remains quite strong,\u201d said Doug Porter, BMO\u2019s chief economist, on Friday. \u201cThe market had been pricing in a very low chance the bank was going to cut rates. This further knocks down those chances.\u201d\n\nStatscan said the services sector gained 49,400 jobs in September, mostly in the healthcare and social assistance sectors, while the goods-producing sector saw an increase of 4,300, because of the construction industry. Meanwhile, the number of full-time jobs rose by 70,000, while part-time jobs fell by 16,300.\n\nFriday\u2019s employment figures are also expected to be one of the last major economic releases before a national election on Oct. 21. The figures will likely be welcomed by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose governing Liberals are facing a tight re-election campaign against the opposition Conservatives.\n\n\u201cCanadians created 54,000 new jobs in September alone,\u201d Trudeau tweeted. \u201cThat\u2019s what happens when you invest in the middle class and people working hard to join it. Let\u2019s keep working together to create even more, and keep growing our economy.\u201d\n\nOntario, Canada\u2019s largest province and a key political battleground in an election that has largely focused on economic issues, gained a net 41,100 jobs in September, far outpacing its other provincial and territorial counterparts.", "description": "The Canadian economy added a stronger-than-expected 53,700 net jobs in September, with all the gains coming in full-time work and largely driven by the services sector, Statistics Canada data showed on Friday, reducing analysts' expectations for a central bank rate cut this month.", "authors": ["Kelsey Johnson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439704257&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A1B7-OCABS", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
