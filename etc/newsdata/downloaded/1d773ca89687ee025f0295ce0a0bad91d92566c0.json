The chain remains in discussions with its landlords, who own the remainder of its 320 care homes.\n\nIt stopped paying rent to the landlords earlier this month in an attempt to draw them to the negotiating table, claiming the bills it was paying them are unsustainable.\n\nFour Seasons has paid more than \u00a3100million in rent over the last two years, and an independent report found that a majority of the landlords are charging above market rate.\n\nThe landlords include controversial investment firm Cerberus Capital Management, which has been branded a 'hound of hell' by MPs for its role in buying up household debt from banks and wringing borrowers for repayment.\n\nMartin Healy, chairman of Four Seasons, said last night: 'All parties remain in constructive discussions.\n\n'The priority of everybody involved remains entirely focused on continuing to provide high quality care for our residents and patients in this next phase of the restructuring.'\n\nFour Seasons will continue talks with its landlords in the hope of lowering rents to more sustainable levels.", "description": "The parent companies of Four Seasons, which houses around 16,000 elderly residents, tumbled into administration earlier this year under the weight of a \u00a3625m debt pile.", "authors": ["Lucy White For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
