He also sent a cover letter signed by the UK\u2019s ambassador to the EU, who made clear that the first letter was from parliament, not the government.\n\nIn a third letter, also sent to EU27 leaders, Mr Johnson disavowed his first letter and said he did not want to delay Brexit.\n\nThe EU spokesperson indicated that none of this chicanery had made any difference to whether Mr Johnson had requested an extension.\n\nThe so-called Benn Act which forced Mr Johnson to send the letters was designed by backbench MPs to avoid a no-deal Brexit by forcing an extension if no deal had passed parliament by Saturday 19 October.\n\nIn his accompanying letter Mr Johnson told the EU: \u201cWhile it is open to the European Council to accede to the request mandated by parliament or to offer an alternative extension period, I have made clear since becoming prime minister \u2013 and made clear to parliament again today \u2013 my view, and the government\u2019s position, that a further extension would damage the interests of the UK and our EU partners and the relationship between us.\n\n\u201cWe must bring this process to a conclusion so that we can move to the next phase and build our new relationship.\u201d\n\nIt is understood that the question of an extension was discussed at length at Thursday\u2019s European Council meeting in Brussels. The EU is expected to wait until the middle of this week before issuing a formal response to the request, however, in order to watch how action plays out in the House of Commons.", "description": "Boris Johnson\u2019s attempt to block a\u00a0Brexit\u00a0delay by not signing his extension letter properly \u201cdoesn\u2019t change anything\u201d about the request, Brussels has said.
