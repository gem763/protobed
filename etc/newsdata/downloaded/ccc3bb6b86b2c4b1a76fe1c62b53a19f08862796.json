They didn\u2019t contribute much to general noise levels and they usually didn\u2019t talk much to pollsters.\n\nThis fits with his airy dismissal of the Canberra bubble. Add in the bureaucracy bubble (focus on delivering, please) and the business bubble.\n\nMorton maintains that the election proved Bill Shorten\u2019s regular claim about the Coalition representing \u201cthe big end of town\u201d was actually the reverse. In his interpretation, it was business seduced by \u201cnoisy elites\u201d and by Labor\u2019s agenda while the Coalition and its \u201caspirational, hard-working\u201d Australians went in the other direction.\n\nRange of new taxes\n\n\u201cQuiet Australians understood we were backing them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey rejected Labor\u2019s re-distributive tax and spend agenda and appeal to class warfare. Another way of looking at it is that Labor lost the election because it wanted to impose a range of new taxes on quiet Australians and because it couldn\u2019t explain the cost of its climate policies.\u201d\n\nThose new taxes include those of particular sensitivity to certain groups \u2013 for example, Labor\u2019s changes to cash refunds for franking credits that alarmed retirees and their families. Or abolishing negative gearing for established properties at a time when property markets were falling.\n\nBut Morton also cites another transformation in the marginal electorates Labor unexpectedly lost. He, like Morrison, is a former state Liberal director, and hence takes a particular interest in seat dynamics.\n\nAccording to this view, Labor is moving away from the aspirational, middle-class voters populating suburbia towards what Morton calls \u201ca trendy, inner city, virtue signalling, social insulated and economically secure set\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe draws a contrast with seats such as Bass and Braddon in Tasmania, citing them as examples of increasingly entrepreneurial areas where people are not employed by big corporations but working in small businesses or doing long hours in family enterprises.\n\n\u201cThey care little for the \u2018big idea\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir interactions with government are transactional and they want these transactions to be efficient.\u201d\n\nThis particular view of their cares would be disputed by many voters in those two seats, of course. The two-party preferred vote in Bass was only 50.41 per cent to 49.59 per cent in favour of Labor, for example.\n\nBut Labor\u2019s failure to win enough seats has certainly been compounded by the number of previously marginal Coalition seats \u2013 especially those on the outskirts of big cities \u2013 that have now become much safer territory for the Morrison government. And Queensland remains an electoral wasteland for Labor.\n\nMiddle class economy\n\nMany in Labor \u2013 from past leaders such as Paul Keating to union giant Bill Kelty to current shadow Treasurer Jim Chalmers \u2013 are acknowledging some of the reasons behind Labor\u2019s electoral woes.\n\nKeating, with typical bluntness, believes Labor \u201cfailed to understand the middle class economy\u201d built by him and Bob Hawke.\n\nKelty says Labor should have been cutting rather than increasing the top marginal tax rate as part of a reform of the tax system instead of just spending more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChalmers concedes Labor \u201clost among middle ground voters (rather than middle income) in outer suburban communities\u201d.\n\nTreasurer Josh Frydenberg insisted on Monday that Labor was instinctively a higher taxing, higher spending party that may have changed its language but not its tune.\n\nBut Anthony Albanese is not saying much about anything just yet as he tries to establish his authority as well as Labor\u2019s future direction.\n\nHis deputy Richard Marles acknowledges the extent of the disconnect as defined by Morton and others.\n\n\u201cWe need to be making sure we are speaking to the widest range of Australians that we possibly can,\u201d Marles said. \u201cThat if you are somebody who is putting on overalls every morning, you are going to work, you are getting dirty, you come home \u2013 that we are the party with whom you identify. Now for a lot of people that remains the case but there's also a lot of people in that category who are not identifying with us.\u201d\n\nThe catch for Labor is how to reconnect. The catch for the Coalition is that quiet Australians will identify with the Morrison government while they feel it remains focused on their interests.
