REUTERS/Steve Marcus\n\nThe figures, which also lag Biden\u2019s second-quarter take of $21.5 million, come as the former vice president fights a two-front war. He faces one battle against 18 people who want the Democratic Party\u2019s nomination and he faces another conflict with the Republican president he hopes to unseat, Donald Trump.\n\nOther Democrats, including U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, have chipped away at his lead in national polls and key early state nominating contests.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, said on Thursday that both China and Ukraine should look into Biden and his businessman son Hunter, doubling down on an invitation for foreign interference in the election that had already triggered an impeachment inquiry in Congress.\n\nBiden\u2019s third-quarter fundraising haul lagged behind those of fellow Democratic presidential hopefuls Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg, who raised $25.3 million and $19.1 million over the same period, respectively. Warren has not yet released her fundraising totals for the most recent quarter.\n\nTrump and his party, meanwhile, jointly raised $125 million for his 2020 reelection bid in the third quarter, the Republican National Committee said on Tuesday.\n\nCampaigns must file detailed fundraising reports for the most recent quarter to the Federal Election Commission by Oct. 15, and the numbers are closely watched to assess whether campaigns are collecting the cash needed to be competitive.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had well over half a million contributions,\u201d Biden told donors at a fundraiser in Palo Alto, California, on Thursday. \u201cWe haven\u2019t raised what a lot of people have - we got started way later than everybody else - but we\u2019ve raised, this last quarter, $15 million, in the middle of summer.\u201d\n\nBiden announced his candidacy in April, later than some rivals. The campaign has also abstained from accepting cash from federally registered lobbyists and certain corporate fundraising entities that are allowed raise unlimited sums of money.\n\nStill, Biden campaign manager Greg Schultz said his candidate and their team, including over 200 staff members across the country, are in a \u201cstrong position.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe question any campaign faces at this point is whether or not you have the resources to compete in early states and sustain your efforts beyond,\u201d Schultz said in a statement. \u201cOur campaign unequivocally does and builds on our strength each week.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign said earlier on Thursday that it would spend $6 million of the $36.7 million it has raised so far on a new set of television and digital advertisements in states set to kick off the Democratic nominating contest early next February, which include Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada.\n\nEarly polls show Biden likely to be a strong contender. Biden fell just two percentage points, to 18%, in the latest Sept 26-30 Reuters/Ipsos poll of Democratic-leaning voters after the House launched its impeachment probe of Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine. But he has fallen 12 points in the poll since June, and Warren trails him now by just four points in the poll.", "description": "Joe Biden raised $15.2 million to support his U.S. presidential bid during the third quarter, his campaign said on Thursday, trailing some of his rivals.", "authors": ["Trevor Hunnicutt", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1436842451&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF921UY"}
