The new season of the show features a bunch of newcomers to the world of pranking puppets, including Bobby Moynihan, Lil Rel Howery, Aubrey Plaza, and Broad City alum Abbi Jacobson. In a new clip from tonight\u2019s episode, Jacobson, a.k.a. Cheryl Brandish, makes her Crank Yankers debut in a relatively short, but respectable, call to car-rental agency \u201cFlurtz\u201d in an attempt to reconnect with an employee who she shared \u201csome vibes\u201d with the previous day. Unfortunately, Carlos isn\u2019t exactly the most interested voice to have on the other end of the line, but at the very least, Jacobson can say she got the most unimpressed car-rental agency employee to say \u201cescalator.\u201d Watch the rest when Crank Yankers airs on Comedy Central tonight at 10:30 p.m.\n\nRelated", "description": "In a new clip from Comedy Central\u2019s \u2018Crank Yankers,\u2019 \u2018Broad City\u2019 alum Abbi Jacobson makes her debut in a prank call looking for love at a car rental agency.", "authors": ["Megh Wright"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/08/08-crank-yankers-abbi-jacobson.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
