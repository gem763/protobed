The thrust will be equivalent to the power produced by 360 standard-sized cars, it said.\n\nThe world record is currently held by Thrust SSC, a British-built jet-powered car that became the first land vehicle to break the sound barrier in 1997 at Black Rock Desert in Nevada.", "description": "In a dry salt lake bed in the Northern Cape, the world land speed record of 1 228km is under threat.", "authors": ["Antony Sguazzin"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9477/6b900f8d7d574aca82c757825dddcaaa.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
