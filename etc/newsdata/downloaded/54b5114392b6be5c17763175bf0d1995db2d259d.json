Several of the games in Naierman\u2019s purchase could fetch similar prices at auction.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a classic case of supply and demand,\u201d said Valarie McLeckie, the video game consignment director at Heritage Auctions. \u201cDemand is increasing. More people are becoming interested, and these games are not easy to find in this condition. That\u2019s what\u2019s driving the market growth at this point. And people get competitive.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAs the video game collecting industry grew during the late 2000s, hobbyists gravitated toward the games with which they grew up. In video gaming\u2019s short history, those were also some of the first console games on the market. Collectors established expertise on titles\u2019 histories based on informal research and connections to other hobbyists, who took informal surveys of which games were available.\n\nWhen third-party grading services entered the hobby, collectors finally had an objective measure of one game\u2019s value vs. another\u2019s, similar to the system that had been in place for years in baseball card and comic book collecting. All of a sudden, hobbyists could quantify their nostalgia with a dollar sign.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt comes in waves, but the waves build up on each other,\u201d said John Hancock, a longtime Seattle-based collector. \u201cFifteen to 20 years after a console comes out, the people who grew up on it get their first real jobs, have a little bit of disposable income and decide to start collecting. We\u2019re already seeing the start of the PlayStation 2 and Wii wave.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIt has even given rise to a niche industry of \u201cretro-gamers,\" who record themselves playing vintage games on sites such as Twitch and YouTube.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only natural, I suppose, but I just play the games that matter to me,\u201d said Jason Lindsey, who plays under the name \u201cMetalJesusRocks.\u201d\n\nNaierman began collecting games after growing disillusioned with baseball card collecting. It took far too much money, he said, to buy a single card, and he was looking to form a collection that could rank as one of the best in the world.\n\nAD\n\nHe pivoted to video games, realizing the titles he and friends grew up playing were now considered top-notch collector\u2019s items, if found in the right condition.\n\nBut increasingly, experts say they\u2019ve seen a movement away from collecting based on nostalgia and toward a view of collecting games as commodities while the market for rare games heats up. In years past, the hobby was dominated by aging gamers. Entering the hobby now are the same sort of serious collectors who consider coins, baseball cards, comic books and works of art as part of their investment portfolios.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe hobby has transformed from being this relic of nostalgia,\u201d Kahn said. \"It\u2019s not so much about that anymore. It\u2019s moved to a real appreciation of the art and historic value of these games. People aren\u2019t just buying them to look at it and remember playing that game. They\u2019re buying them to commemorate the history and the impact they had on pop culture.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the same thing that happened with comic books. People had them, and they were something that sat in the attic and collected dust. But in the \u201990s, people realized they were works of art and pieces of history. There\u2019s a new criteria with that transition of what makes something valuable. It\u2019s still too soon to be conclusive, but the tide has risen.\u201d\n\nIt also has sent longtime gaming aficionados on the hunt for new collectibles. One of the sellers from Naierman\u2019s deal is liquidating some of his collection, once considered to be among the world\u2019s best, to track down original video game cover artwork. For early games, publishers would commission artists to paint the cover by hand, then take a photograph of it and print it onto boxes. Some of those paintings still exist, and as collectors snap them up, another market has emerged for historic video game paraphernalia. That, experts say, is further inflating the price of collectible games.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cJudging from everything I\u2019ve seen in collecting over the years, there\u2019s no reason that this shouldn\u2019t develop into a hobby like baseball cards or comic books,\u201d Naierman said. \u201cI mean, comic books, you tell me what they have that a video game doesn\u2019t. They have the box art. They have the same nostalgia. If comic books can sell for $1 million, there\u2019s no reason a video game shouldn\u2019t be able to do the same.\u201d\n\nFreelance writer Steven C.
