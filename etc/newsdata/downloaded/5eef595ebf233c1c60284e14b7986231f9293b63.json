He was elected mayor in 2017 after serving as a City Councilman.\n\nHe was released after posting a $100,000 bond with the court, but New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy and other elected officials quickly called for him to resign. Plans were already being made for the City Council president to assume Gillam\u2019s position.\n\nGillam, 49, faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted in his trial, which is set for Jan. 7. Half of the money he stole was recovered from his home when FBI agents raided it in December, and he\u2019s agreed to pay restitution for the fraud.\n\nJUDGE HUGS AMBER GUYGER, GIVES HER A BIBLE AFTER MURDER CONVICTION, CAUSING A STIR\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Gillam used the money for personal expenses such as luxury clothing, expensive meals and trips. He had solicited the donations using his political office under the false pretense they were for the youth basketball team or for school supplies for underprivileged children.\n\n\u201cWhen a scheme depletes (a) charity for children, it's unconscionable,\u201d said FBI Special Agent in Charge Gregory Ehrie. \u201cBut when the fraud is perpetrated by someone the public trusts, it damages the community's confidence in their public servants. This defendant betrayed the trust of his community and of people who wanted to improve the lives of children.\u201d\n\nWARREN, GABBARD KNOCK HARRIS' BID TO BAN TRUMP FROM TWITTER\n\nGillam\u2019s lawyer, Harry Rimm, issued a defense that Gillam only admitted misusing private funds, not public money, which he argued made the mayor better than many of his predecessors. The city was on the brink of bankruptcy when Gillam took office in 2017 as its casino industry struggled.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nThe Atlantic City mayoral office has a long history of rampant corruption, lending ground for the 1920s-era hit HBO series \"Boardwalk Empire.\"\n\nAs of 2007, four of the city's last eight mayors had been arrested on corruption charges and one-third of the nine-member City Council was either in prison or under house arrest.\n\nRobert Levey, mayor of the city from 2006-2007, admitted in court to falsifying his military record to receive $25,000 worth of benefits. In 1991, former mayor James Usry admitted to a campaign finance violation of accepting $6,000 in exchange for supporting an ordinance that would benefit the company that offered the money.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "The mayor of Atlantic City, New Jersey admitted in federal court on Thursday that he stole $87,000 from a youth basketball team he founded.", "authors": ["Morgan Phillips"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/AP-Frank-Gilliam.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
