Aircraft produced in the EU will be slapped with 10% tariffs, while other products, such as cheese and whisky, will be slapped with 25% tariffs.\n\nThe Trump administration announced the move earlier this month after the World Trade Organization ruled the U.S. could impose tariffs of $7.5bn of countermeasures against countries that make parts for Airbus AIR, -3.58% planes in retaliation for subsidies the company received in the form of cheap loans.\n\nThe complaint by Boeing BA, -6.79%, Airbus\u2019s American rival, filed around 15 years ago, was closely followed by a counter-claim from Airbus. The WTO has adjudicated that Boeing also received illegal state aid and will decide on the level of tariffs that Europe can impose on America in early 2020. Both sides have talked about a settlement without coming to the negotiating table. Meanwhile the damage from a dispute about aircraft is being felt on the ground.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Wednesday that the U.S. could not lose a trade war with Europe because of the large trade imbalance that exists. \u201cI can remedy the situation very easily,\u201d Trump said.\n\nFifteen U.S. and E.U. spirits associations sent letters to the U.S. administration and E.U. Commission protesting the new tariffs\n\n\u201cOur industries are collateral damage in trade disputes that have nothing to do with the beverage alcohol sector,\u201d the joint letter to U.S Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.\n\nAmerican whiskey exports to the EU have faced a 25% tariff since June 2018 and, beginning today, certain EU spirits and wines imported into the U.S. now face a 25% tariff. As a result, these new U.S. tariffs on EU spirits and wines could result in the loss of 8,000 good-paying jobs across the U.S. beverage alcohol sector, from importers, distributors, wholesalers, to the hospitality sector.\n\nSee also: U.S. and EU should put aside their Boeing-Airbus feud and join forces against predatory Chinese state capitalism", "description": "Some European businesses that export to America will today start to feel the pain of a dispute about subsidies to aircraft-makers.", "authors": ["Clive Mckeef"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HI478_airbus_ZG_20190430012714.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
