Conversely, due to the competitive nature of most agricultural markets, imports must achieve the best quality for the price, resulting in overall lower prices for imported foods.\n\nLikewise, the amount of energy used to transport food around the world in cargo ships is actually small compared to the energy required for heating and cooling technologies, irrigation, fertilizers and pesticides needed to grow food in a local region\u2019s less-than-ideal conditions. For example, by importing produce from the southern hemisphere, northern markets enjoy offseason produce at a fraction of the energy it would cost to grow and store it locally in controlled atmosphere facilities.\n\nFinally, modern safety protocols used by large food producers, processors and distributors have produced the safest food system in history compared to farmers\u2019 markets. And the global food supply chain, which allows regions enduring bad harvests to rely on other regions, has all but ended widespread famine and created stability for global food markets.\n\n\u201cPeople who want safer, more affordable food that\u2019s better for the environment should support increased free trade and the global food supply chain,\u201d Desrochers said.\n\nMEDIA CONTACTS:\n\nPierre Desrochers, Senior Fellow\n\nFraser Institute\n\nTo arrange media interviews or for more information, please contact:\n\nBryn Weese, Associate Director, Communications\n\nFraser Institute\n\nTel: (604) 688-0221 ext. 589\n\nE-mail: bryn.weese@fraserinstitute.org\n\nFollow the Fraser Institute on Twitter | Like us on Facebook", "description": "", "authors": ["Fraser Institute"], "top_image": "http://www.globenewswire.com/Attachment/LogoDisplay/497700?filename=497700.jpg&size=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
