And she is still developing material for herself, mentioning that a project about Isabella Goodwin, the first female police detective in New York City, could provide \u201ca pretty spectacular character.\u201d\n\nMoore\u2019s already been asked if she wrote \u201cInside Out\u201d for the money, and before I could ask her again, she answered herself: \u201cUh, definitely not,\u201d she said with a knowing laugh. \u201cBecause there\u2019s a lot of easier ways to do that.\u201d\n\nBut the idea that \u201cInside Out\u201d might be perceived as a work of image management \u2014 an effort on Moore\u2019s part to replace the version of herself that people perceive with the one she wants to be seen as, or provide one where none currently exists \u2014 is one that she wholeheartedly embraced. \u201cI would say, yeah,\u201d she replied. \u201cGreat! Why not?\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you know me before?\u201d she asked, already expecting that I would answer no. \u201cWell, there you go,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I would say.\u201d\n\nFollow New York Times Books on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, sign up for our newsletter or our literary calendar.
