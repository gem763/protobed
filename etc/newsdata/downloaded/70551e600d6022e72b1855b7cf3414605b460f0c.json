Granados, 29, was among seven people between the ages of 15 and 57 who were killed. Another 22 were wounded, including three police officers and a toddler.\n\nUS Postal Service officials said in a statement Sunday that they were \"shocked and saddened\" by the events, but were \"especially grieving the loss of our postal family member.\"\n\nThe shooting began with a routine traffic stop where the gunman opened fire on police and then took off in a gold car, shooting randomly for more than 10 miles. At some point during the turmoil, the gunman abandoned the car and stole the postal vehicle, killing Granados. Police finally used a marked SUV to ram the mail truck outside the Cinergy Movie Theater in Odessa, disabling the vehicle.\n\nOn Monday, the City of Odessa released a full list of victims:\n\nAmong the killed were Joe Griffith, 40; Mary Granados, 29; Edwin Peregrino, 25; Rodolfo Julio Arco, 57; Kameron Karltess Brown, 30; Raul Garcia, 35; an an unnamed 15-year-old girl.

He didn't have to take my sister.\"\n\nHere are stories about some of Saturday's other dead and wounded:\n\nEdwin Peregrino\n\nPeregrino, 25, ran into the yard of his parents' Odessa home to investigate after hearing gunshots, his sister, Eritizi Peregrino, told The Washington Post. The gunman, who was speeding by the home, opened fire, killing him.\n\n\"It happened at our home. You think you're safe at your own house,\" Eritizi Peregrino, 23, said in an interview. \"You're not even safe at your own house.\"\n\nEritizi Peregrino's husband also was shot. She said he is recovering.\n\nEritizi Peregrino said her brother was home for the weekend to talk about his new job and his new life in San Antonio.\n\n\"You could always count on him for anything,\" she said. \"He would always help my parents and his siblings. I knew I could always rely on him and call on him.\"\n\nLeilah Hernandez\n\nLeilah, 15, was with her family Saturday as her 18-year-old brother, Nathan, picked up a truck. Nathan and Leilah were shot while walking out of the dealership, her grandmother, Nora Leyva, told the Post.\n\n\"I guess he was just looking for someone to kill,\" she said.\n\nLeyva said Leilah's mother pushed Leilah's 9-year-old brother under a car. Nathan wrapped his arms around Leilah and was shot in the arm. Another bullet struck Leilah near her collarbone.\n\n\"Help me, help me,\" the girl said as she died, Leyva said.\n\nLeilah, an Odessa High School student, celebrated her quincea\u00f1era in May.\n\n\"It was like a dream for her,\" Leyva said.\n\nOdessa High's school district, the Ector County Independent School District, didn't name Leilah but said one of its students was among those killed.\n\nJoseph Griffith\n\nGriffith was killed while sitting at a traffic light with his wife and two children, his oldest sister, Carla Byrne, told the Post.\n\n\"This maniac pulled up next to him and shot him, took away his life, murdered my baby brother. Like nothing,\" Byrne said. \"We are so broken.\"\n\nByrne said Griffith, 40, worked six days a week to support his family. He was known for his sense of humor and an uncanny ability to impersonate people.\n\nGriffith previously worked as a math teacher. One day before his death, a former student told Griffith what an \"awesome teacher he was,\" his sister said.\n\nDaniel Munoz\n\nMunoz, 28, who was wounded, recalled the harrowing details of coming into the path of the gunman.\n\n\n\nMunoz was in his car on the way to meet a friend for a drink, when he yielded to a car coming off Interstate 20. He immediately noticed what he feared to be a barrel of a rifle in the hands of the driver.\n\n\"This is my street instincts: When a car is approaching you and you see a gun of any type, just get down,\" Munoz, who moved from San Diego about a year ago to work in oil country, told The Associated Press. \"Luckily, I got down. ... Sure enough, I hear the shots go off. He let off at least three shots on me.\"\n\nHe's not exactly sure, but it appears one shot hit the engine, another struck the driver's side window and a third a rear window. Some shattered glass punctured his left shoulder, causing him to bleed a lot and go to a nearby hospital. He said he's physically OK but bewildered by the experience.\n\n\"I'm just trying to turn the corner and I got shot - I'm getting shot at?\" Munoz said. \"What's the world coming to? For real? I'm just over here minding my own business, getting my own gas.\"\n\nAnderson Davis\n\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott said 17-month-old Anderson is recovering but she faced surgery Monday to remove shrapnel from her right chest. She also suffered injuries to her face. Abbott says her mother, Kelby Davis, texted: \"Her mouth is pretty bad, but will heal and can be fixed. Thankfully it doesn't seem like her jaw was hit. Just lips, teeth and tongue. ... We are thanking God for healing her and appreciate continued prayers.\"\n\nKelby Davis shared an image of the toddler recovering from her injuries.\n\nAnderson Davis recovers after being injured in the mass shooting. Kelby Davis\n\nA joint public statement issued by the Davis family offered thanks to emergency responders, hospital staff and \"strangers who offered to help us on the street.\"\n\nAbbott says the girl's mother also texted: \"Toddlers are funny because they can get shot but still want to run around and play.\"", "description": "A gunman's deadly rampage left at least seven people dead and 22 wounded", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/02/b8b18b02-2a93-4198-afb7-367f63708d51/thumbnail/1200x630/c28bffd9f539c9ad7acff3c46358fb55/mary-granados-1200x630.jpg"}
