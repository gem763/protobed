Authorities said the bodies of the remaining 16 would be buried later.\n\nSeven migrants rescued from the wreck helped lay their companions to rest. \"We were saved and here we are today to bury 46 of our brothers, children and women,\" Anwar, a young Eritrean survivor, told AFP.\n\nIt is unknown exactly how many were on the boat when it went down around 90 minutes after setting off from Libyan shores on Wednesday evening in a desperate bid to reach Europe. Survivors said some 400 people were aboard the vessel when it sank, according to global charity Doctors Without Borders.\n\nNumbers instead of names on graves\n\nUN refugee agency chief Filippo Grandi called the wreck \"the worst Mediterranean tragedy of this year\".\n\nSome 145 people were rescued, according to International Organisation for Migration, which reported more than 110 missing after the sinking.\n\nLibya, which has been wracked by chaos since the 2011 uprising that killed president Muammar Gaddafi, has long been a major transit route for migrants, especially from sub-Saharan Africa, hoping to reach Europe.\n\nAuthorities on Saturday attempted to transport the bodies to a cemetery in the Tripoli suburb of Tajoura, but fighting in the area forced them to turn back.\n\nThey succeeded a day later, finally reaching the small plot of land surrounded by rocks and trees reserved for the bodies of those that have perished in bids to reach Europe by sea.\n\nMany of the graves bear numbers instead of names.\n\nBefore the latest shipwreck, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the IOM said 426 migrants had perished in the Mediterranean this year.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
