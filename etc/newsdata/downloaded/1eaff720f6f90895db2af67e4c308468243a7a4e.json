The superdelegate system has been an albatross around the necks of the Democrats (and to a lesser extent the Republicans as well) for a long time. It warps the will of the voters and allows for too many hijinks by the entrenched gatekeepers.\n\nThank the Lord that\u2019s over, right? Well\u2026 not so fast. The way the current field is shaping up, some of their own analysts are starting to suspect that they\u2019ll have the same problem again next summer. The only difference is that it may be held off until the second round of voting. (Politico)\n\nAfter months of consolidation, there are signs the top tier of the Democratic presidential primary may be expanding, leaving Democrats to confront the prospect of a lasting, multi-candidate contest that could drag on long into next year. \u201cI think it will be a brokered convention,\u201d said former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, who said he came to that view within the past month, after seeing \u201cWarren\u2019s rise, and Sanders staying where he\u2019s always been \u2026 and, I think, Biden\u2019s steadiness.\u201d Richardson\u2019s outlook remains a minority view. But it highlights the implications of a field still stacked with a handful of highly organized, well-funded candidates \u2014 and a race that remains unsettled in ways that could prevent any one candidate from seizing insurmountable momentum from the first four nominating states.\n\nFirst of all, I\u2019m not convinced that the field is going to break that way at all. What\u2019s more remarkable is the fact that a scenario where one candidate doesn\u2019t \u201cseize insurmountable momentum\u201d from just the four early states is being portrayed as a bad thing. It\u2019s bad enough that we have the same few states (including two really tiny ones) determining the magical \u201cmomentum\u201d trope and sucking all of the oxygen out of the race cycle after cycle. If they\u2019re the only ones who count toward determining the final nominee, why bother having the rest of the states show up and vote?\n\nLet\u2019s just say for a moment that at least three candidates (currently Biden, Warren and Sanders) continue to hold on to their current shares of support for several months into the primaries. If that\u2019s the case, then there\u2019s a good chance that none of them will get 51%. But it also provides an incentive for them to fight all the harder for the later states. How is that a problem?\n\nAnd even if they make it all the way to the convention without anyone having 50% support, all that demonstrates is that the DNC didn\u2019t do a good enough job fixing their superdelegate problem. Pushing it off to the second round just means that a divided base will once again have their voices stolen by a couple of hundred party insiders. Keep in mind what happened to the Democrats in 2016. Clinton\u2019s superdelegates from New Hampshire each wiped out the votes of more than 10,000 Sanders voters. That\u2019s not to say that Sanders would have won the nomination without that imbalance, but it was enough to divide their base and generate bad feelings among Sanders voters that have lingered to this day.\n\nIf one candidate can\u2019t get out there and make the case that they have the clear support of Democrats nationally and are the best choice for the party, then so be it. Keep voting until you come to the best (or least awful) consensus. If you let the superdelegates steal the show again you will fracture your base in two elections in a row. And you\u2019ll deserve the subsequent fallout.", "description": "Same as it ever was", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/dem-debate-july2.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
