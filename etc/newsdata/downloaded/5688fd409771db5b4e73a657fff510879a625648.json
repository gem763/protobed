As in years past, we compiled this list by polling dozens of in-the-know industry sources: bookers and producers of live comedy shows, festivals, and late-night TV; execs at networks like Comedy Central, HBO, IFC, and TBS; heads of comedy-record labels like A Special Thing; and reps at comedy-podcast networks like Earwolf, Headgum, and Forever Dog.\n\nWe took their suggestions and, based on which names came up most often, pared the list down to a tight 23 writers and performers whose stars are rising fastest. It didn\u2019t take long for names from 2018\u2019s list such as SNL\u2019s Bowen Yang, sketch group Astronomy Club, forthcoming Adult Swim stars Three Busy Debras, and co-star/co-creator of HBO\u2019s Los Espookys Ana Fabrega to break out. It won\u2019t take long for some of these comics, either.\n\nFor those living in L.A., six of the comics from the list will be participating at a special showcase at Vulture Festival on Sunday, November 10. Click here for more details.\n\nCarmen Christopher\n\nTwitter: @CarmChristopher\n\nLocation: New York\n\nYou\u2019ve probably already seen some of Carmen Christopher\u2019s work. He\u2019s a regular on Chris Gethard Presents and has appeared on High Maintenance, At Home With Amy Sedaris, and Late Night With Seth Meyers. He can often be found on Twitter spoiling Joker to his fellow subway passengers or taking a Sex and the City bus tour. He also has a YouTube channel that \u2014 not to be hyperbolic \u2014 will almost certainly fill the unnameable void you\u2019ve been carrying within you all these years. A frequent collaborator of Joe Pera and Conner O\u2019Malley, Christopher is the kind of performer who gives his audiences something they had no idea they wanted until they get it, and we predict you\u2019ll be wanting a lot more of him soon.\n\nAnna Drezen, Fran Gillespie, Sudi Green, and Streeter Seidell\n\n\u201cA Kanye Place,\u201d written by Fran Gillespie and Sudi Green\n\n\u201cRomano Tours,\u201d written by Anna Drezen and Alison Gates\n\n\u201cGrouch,\u201d written by Mikey Day and Streeter Seidell\n\nTwitter: @annadrezen, @FranGillespie, @Sudi_Green, @streetseidell\n\nLocation: New York\n\nOkay, so, you\u2019re probably thinking, Four SNL supervising writers? Don\u2019t I already Should and Will Know them? And while the answer may be yes, the dynamics of the SNL writers\u2019 room is something of a sport for those of us who, uh, stay in on Saturday nights for reasons that are cool, actually. And while you might not recognize every name scrolling past the good-night hugs at the end of the show, you should remember these four, because they are responsible for some of our favorite sketches of the past few years, like the recent Joker parody about Oscar the Grouch (Seidell co-wrote it with Mikey Day), Kate McKinnon\u2019s Debette Goldry sketches (co-written by Drezen and Green), and the Quiet Place parody \u201cA Kanye Place\u201d (co-written by Green and Gillespie), to name a few. SNL writers who reach this level of influence are often destined for success elsewhere \u2014 see Chris Kelly and Sarah Schneider \u2014 and we\u2019re looking forward to a lot more from these four.\n\nAyo Edebiri\n\nTwitter: @ayoedebiri\n\nLocation: New York\n\nHelp! We\u2019ve been infected by Ayo Edebiri\u2019s youthful energy and boundless enthusiasm for the humiliating grind of life as a 20-something in New York City. Take, for instance, the above set about everything from her 48-year-old roommate to dating, in which Edebiri shows off her flair for self-deprecation and ability to invite the audience in on every punch line. Edebiri has quickly made her name for herself in only a few short years, writing for the New Yorker, BET\u2019s The Rundown, and NBC\u2019s Sunnyside and performing with her sketch group Lo-Fi, not to mention co-hosting her podcast Iconography with Olivia Craighead. So, we expect to see so much more from Edebiri and her wonderful, compartmentalized Twitter account soon.\n\nHannah Einbinder\n\nTwitter: @hannaheinbinder\n\nLocation: Los Angeles\n\nHannah Einbinder and her penchant for restrained silliness (like ingratiating herself to the crowd like she\u2019s in a classic noir) has quickly managed to capture the attention of indie comedy taste-makers and network suits alike, becoming one of the fastest-rising stars to come from the stand-up-comedy world in quite some time. Of course, Einbinder has put the work in, hitting as many open mics and dive bars as she possibly could over the last few years, honing her refreshingly absurdist charm (with a bit of a Billie Eilish\u2013ish flair). Sometimes, that will involve dancing with audience members or reciting a Hebrew chant as part of a bit. Taking such chances has taken her to the heights of the Just for Laughs festival\u2019s New Faces showcase and opening for Reggie Watts.\n\nDavid Gborie\n\nTwitter: @thegissilent\n\nLocation: Los Angeles\n\nThe gig of being the voice of Comedy Central has recently gone from one great comedian to another, Kyle Kinane to David Gborie. Gborie has been a favorite of crowds wherever he goes, including comedy fests like High Plains Comedy Festival, clubs across North America, and the indie L.A. show he\u2019s part of, Faded, as he possesses a rare, endless charm. In fact, the missing of his mark during the taping of his Conan set is a testament to this bottomless charm reserve. Certainly, his inclusion on the All Fantasy Everything podcast has cemented his wild, fun-loving, and open-minded persona to an ever-growing fan base. That\u2019ll undoubtedly get even bigger with his half-hour special on Comedy Central set to premiere soon.\n\nSolomon Georgio\n\nTwitter: @solomongeorgio\n\nLocation: Los Angeles\n\nSolomon Georgio\u2019s command of the stage undeniable, so it\u2019s not surprising to hear that he\u2019s has made repeat appearances on Conan and Drunk History, had a debut half-hour special and album through Comedy Central, and has written for the likes of such respected comedy series as Adam Ruins Everything and Shrill. Georgio also has a plethora of stellar, captivating stories about his life as a gay immigrant from Ethiopia raised in the States.\n\nVanessa Gonzalez\n\nTwitter: @buhnessa\n\nLocation: Los Angeles\n\nVanessa Gonzalez swooped on up from being one of Austin\u2019s best comedians (as voted on annually by the Austin Chronicle) to scoring JFL New Faces, a Comedy Central half-hour special, and an HBO Latino special to boot. Her low-key delivery makes her incredibly crafty writing land big laughs, much to the delight of so many audiences she has performed for, whether it be at big crowds at SXSW or in intimate settings like L.A.\u2019s hot new comedy-centric theater, Dynasty Typewriter.\n\nJanelle James\n\nTwitter: @janellejcomic\n\nLocation: Los Angeles\n\nA direct recommendation from living comedy legend Chris Rock to the world might be all you need to get onboard with Janelle James. Her unapologetic fearlessness onstage has taken her up the ranks through New York and now L.A. Along the way, she has scored a Netflix special, landed a writing gig on Showtime\u2019s Black Monday, and took over the long-running Eugene Mirman Comedy Festival, now called the Janelle James Comedy Festival, which is already going for its second year.\n\nDan Licata\n\nTwitter: @danlicatasucks\n\nLocation: New York\n\nTrue story: Dan Licata made our list before he was hired to be a writer on SNL this year. It doesn\u2019t take a clairvoyant to see that Licata is destined to become a household name, and his appearance at this year\u2019s Just for Laughs New Faces simply underscored it. A writer for Joe Pera Talks With You (including everyone\u2019s favorite episode, the one that reintroduced us all to the magic of the Who\u2019s \u201cBaba O\u2019Riley\u201d) and consistently funny presence on Twitter, Licata\u2019s approach embraces a chaotic awkwardness that you could say permeates much of our current media landscape, something that will only make him increasingly relevant.\n\nJacqueline Novak\n\nTwitter: @jacquelinenovak\n\nLocation: New York\n\nIf you didn\u2019t get a chance to see Jacqueline Novak\u2019s one-woman show Get on Your Knees, produced by Natasha Lyonne and Mike Birbiglia, the first thing to know is it\u2019s about so much more than blow jobs. The comedian who we at Vulture have dubbed \u201cthe great conversationalist\u201d is clearly just getting warmed up. Her appearance on Late Night With Seth Meyers gave non-theatergoers a glimpse into her innate charm and intellectual approach to the seemingly mundane: what to wear on TV, how to sit in a chair, etc. Novak has proved herself to be a woman of deeply inventive comedy that suggests we\u2019ve only just hit the tip of the \u2026 iceberg. Get on Your Knees is proof that Novak is destined to be the star of the next viral stand-up special on whichever network is lucky enough to land it.\n\nRachel Pegram\n\nTwitter: @rachelpegram\n\nLocation: New York\n\nWe know Rachel Pegram as the comedian who weeps at the existence of cinema, and you might know her from her appearances in Adam Sandler\u2019s The Week Of, or Don\u2019t Think Twice, or The Chris Gethard Show, or Full Frontal With Samantha Bee, or \u2026 well, you get the idea. Pegram\u2019s ability to be this prolific is thanks to the fact that she makes being just plain funny look easy, something Just for Laughs clearly realized when it featured her in its New Faces showcase this year. Pegram is a master at delivering monologues that slip in and out of characters, building to punch lines that she seemingly pulls from the ether. Just take a look at her extremely elegant performance on Chris Gethard Presents above.\n\nDewayne Perkins\n\nTwitter: @dewayneperkins\n\nLocation: Los Angeles\n\nDon\u2019t let the beautiful smile and charismatic stage presence fool you: Dewayne Perkins is a very sharp writer with Brooklyn Nine-Nine, the last comedy-focused White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner, and more on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Perkins has managed to come up through all three of America\u2019s major comedy capitals, going from Chicago to New York to L.A., and get acclaim as a Comedy Central \u201cUp Next\u201d comedian, JFL New Face, and writer of one of the best jokes of 2018 as named by The New Yorker. Perkins\u2019s experience in Second City and ballet and even hip-hop dancing all seemingly combine for his wonderful stand-up, where he\u2019s light on his feet and hard-hitting with his punch lines.\n\nAnna Seregina\n\nTwitter: @touchingcheeses\n\nLocation: Los Angeles\n\nIn everything she does, Anna Seregina combines a bold desire for experimentation, a flourish of grace, and an undeniable sense of play. Through stand-up, postmodern clowning, and acting in indie comedies and short films, she has become one of the L.A. comedy scene\u2019s absolute favorites to watch. Often, Seregina will get delightfully meta in her performances by becoming a skittish version of herself with a Russian accent (she emigrated to America from Russia as a teen), doing impressions of herself doing stand-up, making her comedy like a very satisfying charcuterie plate. Recently, Seregina has pushed herself further in this regard (in a perhaps Andy Kaufman\u2013esque way) through elaborate, yet very absurd and fun, staged interruptions during live shows with her frequent accomplice Kyle Mizono.\n\nShalewa Sharpe\n\nTwitter: @silkyjumbo\n\nLocation: New York\n\nThere aren\u2019t a lot of comedians whose work provides us entirely new dating terminology, but Shalewa Sharpe is one of those comics. Maybe you\u2019ve seen her on HBO\u2019s 2 Dope Queens, Comedy Central\u2019s The New Negroes, or The Tonight Show, but if not, you can learn what \u201cT-shirt dick\u201d is in the clip above. Sharpe is a performer whose originality not only expands our lexicon but also makes the conversations happening on the internet much less exhausting. We don\u2019t doubt we\u2019ll be seeing a lot more of her because, frankly, the world needs this.\n\nMegan Stalter\n\nTwitter: @megstalter\n\nLocation: New York\n\nIt\u2019s hard to define Megan Stalter as anything other than a performer who has figured out life\u2019s big secret: You can do anything you want onstage. She credits this revelation with the creation of her brash onstage persona, and it\u2019s the pathos The Megan Statler Show is clearly built on. Sure, it\u2019s a late-night show, but it\u2019s also whatever she wants it to be. Because who needs a format when you\u2019re just genuinely funny?\n\nWhitmer Thomas\n\nTwitter: @whitmerthomas\n\nLocation: Los Angeles\n\nFormerly the ringleader of the \u201cextreme friendship\u201d comedy collective known as Power Violence, Whitmer Thomas has evolved rather quickly as a solo act. These days, he can go from doing stand-up that recounts his troubled childhood to examining his present self via post-punk-tinged original songs that feature fantasy video-game cut scenes playing in the background. Thomas has also made short films with his Power Violence gang and starred in the FXX animated series Stone Quackers. Perhaps most impressively, no one spoofs emo music as well as he does.\n\nSteph Tolev\n\nTwitter: @stephtolev\n\nLocation: Los Angeles\n\nIn a very short time, Steph Tolev managed to establish herself in L.A. as one of Toronto\u2019s funniest exports (and that\u2019s counting her among the likes of Nathan Fielder and Debra DiGiovanni). Her rapid-fire, self-deprecating style of stand-up has killed with audiences all across North America, and her episode of the great Please Understand Me web series showcases her comedic acting chops quite well too. In fact, she\u2019s so beloved and has such a signature style that she was able to do an entire \u201c50 First Stephs\u201d night, where 50 or so comedians lovingly did an impression of her.\n\nIrene Tu\n\nTwitter: @irene_tu\n\nLocation: Los Angeles\n\nIrene Tu\u2019s wry sensibility and Larry David\u2013esque observations saw her move all the way up through the San Francisco and L.A. comedy scene pretty smoothly, then onward to performing at big festivals across the country (as opposed to the rough go that most comedians get when making the jump to L.A.). Tu\u2019s act celebrates intersectionality as something to be cherished and enjoyed while also presenting comedy that shows we have more in common than we don\u2019t, especially when it comes to the everyday minutiae that annoys us all.\n\nMartin Urbano\n\nTwitter: @MartinUrbano\n\nLocation: New York\n\nAny curmudgeons out there bemoaning the rise of PC culture in comedy likely haven\u2019t heard the work of Martin Urbano. His work combines edgy, almost-over-the-line humor with \u2014 get this \u2014 really good jokes. His mastery of the punch line has earned him spots on Jimmy Kimmel Live, Howie Mandel\u2019s Comedy Gala, and Comedy Central Stand-up, plus two of his very own episodes of Chris Gethard Presents. And his ability to execute strong comedic fundamentals with a little bit of signature flair ensures we\u2019ll be seeing lots more of him in the future.\n\nEva Victor\n\nme explaining to my boyfriend why we\u2019re going to straight pride pic.twitter.com/ZtXpLaV05s \u2014 Eva Victor (@evaandheriud) June 4, 2019\n\nTwitter: @evaandheriud\n\nLocation: New York\n\nIf something is trending on Twitter, but Eva Victor doesn\u2019t make a video about it, did it really happen? In addition to her work as a stand-up and writer for Reductress, Victor has made a name for herself by going extremely viral in the front-facing Twitter video genre, with her take on \u201cStraight Pride\u201d earlier this year racking up over 10 million views and counting. And now that she\u2019s making videos over at Comedy Central, we suspect there\u2019s only more to come from this, shall we say, social-media phenom, if you will.", "description": "A roundup of 23 up-and-coming comedians recommended by bookers and executives at Comedy Central, HBO, Earwolf, IFC, TBS, late-night TV, live comedy show bookers, and more.", "authors": ["Jake Kroeger", "Anne Victoria Clark"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/25/comedian-response-roundup-secondaries/25-comedians-to-know.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
