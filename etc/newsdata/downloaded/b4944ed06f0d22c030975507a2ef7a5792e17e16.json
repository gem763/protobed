It could, however, have been United.\n\nJurgen Klopp could be managing Man United were it not for the club's sole commercial focus\n\nWriting in his column for the Mirror, former Reds striker Fowler said: 'I did an interview with him a couple of years ago and he told me he turned down a couple of super-rich clubs after Dortmund.\n\n'One of them was definitely \u00ad Manchester United , the other probably Real Madrid \u2013 because he hated how they were focused solely on \u00adcommercial influences.\n\n'He said he liked Liverpool because they had a balance between the money needed to reach the top and the \u00adhistory and identity of the club and their fans.'\n\nRobbie Fowler has interviewed Klopp and asked him about his decision making process\n\nKlopp chose Liverpool because of the club's history and emotional connection with the fans\n\nKlopp was said to be only willing to take up another job if the club in question was invested with their fan base, caring only about results on the field.\n\nExplaining his thought process, Klopp had noted: 'I had talks with other clubs and they didn't sound like a football club. It sounded like marketing, image, you need to sign this, you need to sign that. And I thought \"wow, that's not the game I love\".\n\n'It's all part of football, but it can not be the number one, two, three, four, priority. First of all please try to improve the game we play.'\n\nKlopp's Liverpool travel to United once the Premier League returns to action. The two sides meet at Old Trafford on Sunday, October 20.", "description": "Jurgen Klopp could be managing Manchester United right now were it not for the club's sole focus on commercial interests, says Liverpool legend Robbie Fowler.", "authors": ["Danny Gallagher For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/21/19664632-0-image-a-33_1570997293932.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
