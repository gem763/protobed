Lin said Macau\u2019s prosecutors agreed to interrogate several suspects accused of the crime using questions provided by the Taiwanese side.\n\nMore from South China Morning Post:\n\nThis article How justice falls through the cracks of a Taiwan-Hong Kong legal loophole first appeared on South China Morning Post\n\nFor the latest news from the South China Morning Post download our mobile app. Copyright 2019.", "description": "The dispute between Hong Kong and Taiwan over the voluntary return of a murder suspect to the island to stand trial highlights the struggle Taiwanese authorities have to fight such crimes without a judicial agreement with the city.Hong Kong resident Chan Tong-kai allegedly killed his 20-year-old girlfriend", "authors": ["Lawrence Chung"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4Hq42aV4NQ7uqsSvef65kQ--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/south_china_morning_post_621/1dd4b8f371f703cbbabc86091636384c", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
