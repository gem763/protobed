The bill also would allow users to designate third-party services to manage their privacy and account settings.\n\n\u201cAs a former cell phone guy, I saw what a game-changer number portability was for that industry,\u201d said Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia in a press release. He is sponsoring the legislation with Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri.\n\n\u201cBy making it easier for social media users to easily move their data or to continue to communicate with their friends after switching platforms, startups will be able to compete on equal terms with the biggest social media companies,\u201d Warner added. \u201cAnd empowering trusted custodial companies to step in on behalf of users to better manage their accounts across different platforms will help balance the playing field between consumers and companies.\u201d\n\nRelated: Want to delete Facebook?

Mandating portability will give people \u201ca realistic option of switching to another provider,\u201d he added. The bill\u2019s lengthy full name is the Augmenting Compatibility and Competition by Enabling Service Switching Act.\n\nFacebook Inc.\u2019s FB, -3.91% third-quarter disclosure on its lobbying efforts shows that it aimed to influence lawmakers and regulators on \u201cdata portability and interoperability,\u201d among many other issues. In a white paper released month, Facebook laid out the challenges of letting users take their data to other platforms.
