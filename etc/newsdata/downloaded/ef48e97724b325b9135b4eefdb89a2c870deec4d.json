Both\n\nwere down almost 4% over the week, representing WTI's biggest\n\nweekly loss in 10 weeks and Brent's biggest in seven.\n\nBrent and WTI were also hit by a Wall Street Journal report\n\nciting unnamed sources saying that Saudi Arabia had agreed a\n\npartial ceasefire in Yemen, said analysts in the Reuters Global\n\nOil Forum. Brent is just above its level before attacks on Saudi\n\nfacilities on Sept 14, which initially halved the kingdom's\n\nproduction.\n\nSources told Reuters this week that Saudi Arabia had\n\nrestored capacity to 11.3 million barrels per day.

The COSCO vessels are equal to about 7.5% of the world's\n\nfleet of supertankers, Refinitiv data showed.\n\nEmerging details connected to the impeachment inquiry into\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump also helped to dent demand\n\nsentiment, analysts said.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a graphics-led story on the impact of supply shocks on\n\nprices, click on ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n\n\n\nUPDATE 2-Oil prices head for big weekly loss as supply fears wane", "description": "UPDATE 2-Oil prices head for big weekly loss as supply fears wane", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEBBT0BW_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
