But wrestling fans know better\u2014Randy \u201cThe Ram\u201d Robinson is going to suit up for an old-fashioned ass-kicking.\n\nHush-hush and strictly confidential, but the chatter percolating in the pro-wrestling community is that despite his publicist\u2019s braying to the contrary, Mickey Rourke is seriously considering jumping into the ring at this year\u2019s WrestleMania.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be plugged into the world of fanboy Internet kooks to smell what\u2019s cooking. All you have to do is watch RAW, the World Wrestling Entertainment\u2019s flagship Monday-night broadcast, to witness the buildup: weekly clips of Rourke as Randy \u201cThe Ram\u201d Robinson and The Wrestler accompanied by fawning announcers, followed by Jericho running his mouth and taunting the movie star, which is the second-best thing he does, right after crippling people.\n\nFor those of you not following the saga of Mickey Rourke\u2019s would-be wrestling career\u2014the one he is apparently trying to launch in the wake of his star-turn as The Wrestler\u2014allow me to recap:\n\n\u201cThe boys from the WWE called me and asked me to do it,\u201d Rourke told Access Hollywood from the red carpet at the SAG awards last month. \u201cChris Jericho, you better get in shape,\u201d he added, calling out the WWE\u2019s ace heel, \u201cbecause I\u2019m coming after your ass.\u201d A few days later, Rourke went on Larry King Live and tussled with Jericho via satellite. \u201cIf he got his wish and had a confrontation with me at WrestleMania, the end of the Jericho-Rourke movie would not turn out well for Mr. Rourke,\u201d said Jericho. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between playing a wrestler in a movie and actually being one in real life.\u201d The day after that, a spokesman for Rourke threw water on the whole shebang, insisting that The Mick had no intention of participating, and was instead going to be \u201cfocusing entirely on his acting career.\u201d\n\nRourke should know this is no joke. If he decides to fight, he is going to feel some very real pain.\n\nWhy the sudden change? Perceived wisdom has it that the liberal elite at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences are eager to promote acting and filmmaking as some sort of noble profession, and do not want to be cast as an unwitting PR machine for the WWE and its sideshow of monsters and muscle-bound freaks. Doing his best not to piss in the Academy\u2019s punchbowl before the awards ceremony, Rourke has done a quick 180 toward industry respectability.\n\nAnd yet to anyone at all familiar with the vagaries of the wrestling world, it seems very likely that the WWE is laying the foundation for an actor vs. wrestler angle at WrestleMania XXV, which will be beamed via satellite from Houston to all civilized nations on April 5.\n\nLast night, Roddy Piper\u2014the loquacious superstar of the 1980s whose unprovoked attack on Jimmy \u201cSuperfly\u201d Snuka with a coconut has long been regarded by pundits as the greatest moment in television history (right after the first moon landing)\u2014made an appearance shilling for Rourke. \u201cThat movie is about pain and suffering,\u201d he told Jericho. \u201cAnd yes, I cried.\u201d Jericho\u2019s response was to drop Piper with a giant haymaker to the skull, scoring some cheap heat from the marks in the audience who live for this soap opera.\n\nIf Rourke does end up donning the tights at the big event, he\u2019ll follow in the footsteps of other celebrities of various stature who have gone over to the dark side for a taste of that sweet pay-per-view payoff. For 15 minutes of work, not counting the press conference, Rourke stands to make $1 million. He is also guaranteed to see more stars in the first half-second of his match\u2014right after Jericho plows him in the head\u2014than he did in the 22 years between Barfly and The Wrestler.\n\nRourke\u2019s denial of his intention to do some real live rasslin\u2019 is appearing more and more like a \u201cwork,\u201d as we say in the biz. Just as soon as Rourke gets the Oscar back to his flophouse, he\u2019ll be filing it down to use as a weapon in the ring.\n\nBut Rourke should know this is no joke. If he decides to fight, he is going to feel some very real pain. That is, if he makes it that far\u2014if the Academy doesn\u2019t find out they\u2019re being punked and remove Rourke from serious consideration, and if Rourke\u2019s manager and agent don\u2019t somehow convince him that the big cash payoff and the box-office boost are just not worth it, and he should \u201cfocus on his acting career,\u201d which is Hollywood\u2019s shibboleth for, \u201cBehave yourself, dirtbag, you\u2019re still one step from doing dinner theater in the Valley.\u201d\n\nBecause for all his moxie, Rourke is just a busted-up old actor. Chris Jericho is a championship wrestler, a breed apart, and you can bet he is not going to be too happy about \u201cjobbing\u201d\u2014taking a fall, that is\u2014for Rourke. Even though Rourke\u2019s face already looks like it was designed by Frank Gehry, after he takes a chair shot to the kisser he stands a fair chance of ending up with both eyes on the same side of his head, staggering around the ring like a refugee from a Cubist concentration camp.\n\nCelebrities don\u2019t get a free ride in the WWE. Donald Trump may have walked away unscathed two years ago, but (A) he was only invited\u2014and promised an easy victory\u2014so he could hype WrestleMania on The Apprentice and give that elusive whiff of legitimacy to the whole affair, and (B) Trump is a big poof with no sense of humor, and everyone except him knew that he was the one being worked as a foil for WWE honcho Vince McMahon in their \u201cHair vs. Hair\u201d match. No one was surprised when McMahon had his head shaved, and no one enjoyed the histrionics any less for knowing it was inevitable.\n\nBoxing legend Floyd Mayweather Jr. wasn\u2019t so lucky\u2014he was pounded like the veal paillard special before he won his match against the Big Show, but only by cheating with a pair of brass knuckles he had sequestered in his trunks.\n\nAnd Pete Rose nearly had his neck nearly broken at multiple WrestleManias, including the year he sneaked into the arena disguised in a giant chicken suit trying to get his revenge, only to make his exit supine, on a stretcher.\n\nAnyway, Rourke wouldn\u2019t want a pass. He wants to earn the respect of the real wrestlers and is willing to \u201ctake a bump\u201d to earn it. He won\u2019t roll over for Chris Jericho, and ditto, Jericho will enjoy inflicting some damage on Rourke. Jericho may be a charming villain, but behind his charisma lies a savage thug. The smart alecks in the movie racket may think wrestling is phony, but it\u2019s not half as phony as the acting business. Someone is going to get hurt, you can count on it.\n\nWe\u2019ll know soon enough if Rourke is his own man, or if he caves to his posse of advisers and the Academy, whose own ruling council rivals the WWE\u2019s in narcissism and snake-oil peddling. The WWE will always win, however, because their fans don\u2019t really care how absurd the show is\u2014they\u2018ve always been in on the joke.\n\nRELATED: Rourke Trashes Oscar Opponent Sean Penn by Gerald Posner\n\nMike Edison is the former publisher of High Times, the former editor-in-chief of Screw magazine, and a professional wrestler of no small repute.
