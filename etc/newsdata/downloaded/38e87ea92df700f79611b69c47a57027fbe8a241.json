Growth ensures profits, profits boost share prices, and higher share prices are the investor\u2019s goal. In truth, this should not come as a surprise; the S&P 500 is up over 20% year-to-date, and statistically speaking, that sort of gain must encompass some stocks that are growing far faster.\n\nWe\u2019ve opened up TipRanks\u2019 Best Stocks to Buy to find three buy-rated stocks that have more than doubled so far in 2019. But more importantly, analysts believe there's more upside in store heading into 2020; all three of these stocks show more than 30% upside potential. The stocks cover a wide range of market sectors \u2013 social media, online games, and biotechnology \u2013 reflecting the market reality that great opportunities abound, for investors willing to look.\n\nSea Limited (SE)\n\nThe online gaming sector has the benefit of devoted fans who will eagerly snap up their favorite companies\u2019 latest offerings \u2013 but it has the risk of a tech-savvy fan base that won\u2019t be amused by substandard offerings. Sea Limited owns and maintains a number of active titles in the Battle Royale genre, including Free Fire and Ring of Elysium. The company\u2019s PUBG Lite was the most popular Battle Royale mobile game in South East Asia in the third quarter of this year, followed by SE\u2019s Garena Free Fire. SE games rank among the top 10 grossing ranks in 51 as of this past September.\n\nPopular games are the path to profits, and SE announced a 203% year-over-year revenue gain in Q2 2019, reporting $665.4 million compared to $219.6 million in the prior-year quarter. Quarterly active users (QAU) gained 93% year-over-year, reaching 310.5 million. Of that total, 8.4% were quarterly paying users \u2013 more than double the year-ago number. With pre-registration starting for Call of Duty: Mobile, a collaboration with online giants Activision Tencent, Sea has excellent prospects to keep increasing its active and paying user numbers. The strongly positive outlook has pushed this stock up 151% year-to-date.\n\nCredit Suisse analyst Varun Ahuja was duly impressed. He reiterated his Outperform rating (an equivalent to Buy), while slightly increasing the price target from $43 to $44. His price target suggests a robust 54% upside potential.

We see the correction as a strong accumulating opportunity given that its underlying fundamentals remain solid.\u201d\n\nJPMorgan's team added, \u201cSE\u2019s share price declined by 9% on 8 October (CCMP -1.7%). Different investors attributed the sell-off to different reasons. Interestingly though, none of the factors created a major concern on their own but together resulted in a sell-off in a weak market. We remain OW on SE and see improving monthly gaming revenues\u2026\u201d The firm gives this stock a $41 price target, indicative of a 43% upside.\n\nSo, the consensus on SE is \u2018buy the dip.\u2019 The stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 5 positive reviews in the last three months. Shares or selling for $28.50, and the $44 average price target suggests an upside potential of 54%.
