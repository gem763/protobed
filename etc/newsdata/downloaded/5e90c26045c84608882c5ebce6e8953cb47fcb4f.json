Which is just unheard of between brothers. I never argue with my brother. Never!!\n\nHarry and Meghan have been in the headlines recently because of the ITV documentary they filmed, Harry & Meghan: An African Journey. The doco, filmed across South Africa, Angola, Malawi, and Botswana, sees The Duke and Duchess speak exclusively to British news anchor Tom Bradby about the causes they\u2019re passionate about and about being a modern Royal\u2026 and copping shit from just about everyone. That too.\n\n\u201cInevitably stuff happens,\u201d Harry candidly said of the rumours. \u201cBut we\u2019re brothers, we\u2019ll always be brothers. We\u2019re certainly on different paths at the moment. I\u2019ll always be there for him and as I know, he\u2019ll always be there for me. We don\u2019t see each other as much as we used to because we\u2019re so busy but I love him dearly.\u201d\n\nHarry added that the majority of royal \u201cdrama\u201d that hits the headlines is stuff \u201ccreated out of nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs brothers, we have good days and we have bad days.\u201d\n\nAdd future King of England to that and the British press, and I imagine things can be quite stressful.\n\nIn another snippet of the doco, Meghan revealed she genuinely tried to \u201cadopt this British sensibility of a stiff upper lip\u201d to appease the masses of judgemental shits, but struggled.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing that I know is that I never thought that this would be easy,\u201d Meghan said. \u201cBut I thought it would be fair and that\u2019s the part that\u2019s really hard to reconcile. But I don\u2019t know, just take each day as it comes.\u201d\n\n'As brothers you have good days, you have bad days' Prince Harry says the 'majority of stuff' written about his relationship with his brother William is 'created out of nothing' and adds: 'I love him dearly' #HarryAndMeghan https://t.co/GWs5KfuovM pic.twitter.com/bW7GVALZR6 \u2014 ITV News (@itvnews) October 20, 2019\n\nYou can stream Harry and Meghan: An African Journey on 10 play right here.
