The medication worked by making the blood of people who were repeatedly vaccinated lethal to mosquitoes.\n\nThe study also found that Ivermectin can kill plasmodium falciparum, the malaria parasite carried by female mosquitoes, when administered to humans.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Malaria affects more than 200 million people globally and claims nearly 500,000 lives a year, with children especially vulnerable.

That is why a new line of treatment is a must. It has to be made available soon,\u201d said Dr Simon Kariuki, head of Kenya\u2019s malaria research programmes at Kemri.\n\nThe research is being conducted in Kenya by local scientists in collaboration with international health experts.\n\n\u201cWe have discovered [that the] bacterium is highly effective in killing plasmodium falciparum, the parasite that causes malaria, but our research is more focused on pregnant women and children as they are more vulnerable. We are getting very motivating leads,\u201d Kariuki said.\n\n\u201cIn a few years, new malaria drugs could be in the market if the current research findings are to go by. The same bacteria known to kill dangerous pathogens in scabies, river blindness, can also be applied in malaria.\n\n\u201cThe motivating success of Ivermectin is leading us to venture into producing other drugs. That is very encouraging and it means more research, and that is what we are doing.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mosquitoes are seen on a net at a research facility in Nairobi, Kenya.

We need more answers on Ivermectin. We need new malaria drugs as soon as possible as drug resistance is not something to ignore and we have to treat the situation as urgent,\u201d said Kariuki.\n\n'Malaria will not be eradicated in near future', warns WHO Read more\n\nAn expert, independent from the study, said reports of resistance to the current class of malaria drugs are on the rise.\n\n\u201cThere have been confirmed reports by the World Health Organization that there have been cases of resistance in Thailand and Cambodia, and closer to home in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\u201d said Dr Evans Murage, a pharmacist based in Nairobi, Kenya.\n\n\u201cThere are cases of the drugs being sold over the counter, leading to their resistance and overuse. Many people who buy drugs from pharmacies suspect they have malaria even without getting tested. This should be a worry for the government.\u201d\n\nCurrently, the most effective vaccine to have a protective effect against malaria is RTS,S, introduced in a WHO-recommended pilot scheme in 2019. In trials it was found to prevent approximately 39% of cases of malaria in children aged from five to 17 months.", "description": "Drugs derived from Ivermectin, which makes human blood deadly to mosquitoes, could be available within two years", "authors": ["Gitonga Njeru In Nairobi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ae13399fe2af556ecc223e0a5c420a7465c6b7c/0_234_3504_2102/master/3504.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cd714f035a6c03d793e6eb9725a18995", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
