Wes Welker\u2019s Footgate Press Conference in 2011\n\nPrior to a divisional-round playoff game against the hated Jets, the New England wide receiver gave a press conference in which he made references to feet in order to get under the skin of New York head coach Rex Ryan, a well-known foot fetishist. Upset with Welker for the not-so-subtle stunt, New England coach Bill Belichick benched him to start the game, a move which may have backfired as the Patriots ending up losing 28-21. \u201cWes always brought a lot of life to things and he had a great personality, always keeping things light for everybody,\u201d Brady said of the incident in 2017. \u201cWho cares if it got him in trouble? Nobody really gives a sh*t about that.\u201d\n\n9. Fourth-and-2 vs. the Colts in 2009\n\nIn New England, the motto is generally \u201cIn Bill We Trust.\u201d However, even diehard Belichick bobos had to question their coach\u2019s decision to attempt a 4th-down conversion from his own 28 with a six-point lead and less than two minutes remaining on the clock. Brady\u2019s pass on fourth-and-2 was complete to Kevin Faulk and he appeared to pick up the first down, but he was marked short. Peyton Manning got the ball on a short field and led the Colts to a 35-34 win. \u201cWe thought we could win on that play,\u201d Belichick said afterward, via The New York Times. \u201cI don\u2019t know how we could not get a yard on that play.\u201d Belichick was then reminded it was a fourth-and-2, not a fourth-and-1. \u201cOne yard, two yards \u2026 \u201d he replied. At the time, ex-Patriot Rodney Harrison called it \u201cthe worst coaching decision I\u2019ve ever seen Bill Belichick make.\u201d\n\n8. Bill Belichick Resigns as Head Coach of the NYJ in 2000\n\nThe day after he accepted the role of Jets head coach after Bill Parcells stepped down from the position, Belichick stepped to the podium with a cocktail napkin containing seven words: \u201cI resign as HC of the NYJ.\u201d Not a big talker, Belichick didn\u2019t really elaborate as to why he was spurning the Jets for the Patriots. \u201cI\u2019ve been in situations, and more importantly my family has been in a situation, where I was the head coach of a team in transition,\u201d Belichick told the media at what was supposed to be his introductory press conference. \u201cFrankly, it wasn\u2019t a really good experience for me or for them.\u201d\n\n7. Questionable Formation Against the Ravens in 2015\n\nDuring New England\u2019s 35-31 comeback win in the AFC divisional round against the Ravens, the Patriots got creative with their offensive formations and their reporting of which players were eligible or ineligible receivers. Though legal, the tactics enraged Ravens coach John Harbaugh and led to him complaining after the game. After hearing of the Harbaugh\u2019s complaints, Brady trolled him. \u201cMaybe those guys got to study the rule book and figure it out,\u201d he said. \u201cWe obviously knew what we were doing, and we made some pretty important plays. It was a real good weapon for us. Maybe we\u2019ll have something in store next week. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s deceiving about that. [The Ravens] should figure it out.\u201d Prior to the start of the following season, the NFL passed a rule that makes it illegal for an offensive player wearing an eligible number \u2014 between 1 and 49, or 80 to 89 \u2014 to report as ineligible and line up outside the tackle box.\n\n6.

(Barry Chin/The Boston Globe via Getty)\n\nLess than a month after the Patriots won Super Bowl LIII, Florida officials revealed that Patriots owner Robert Kraft was facing charges of soliciting prostitution after visiting a Florida spa on multiple occasions and allegedly paying for sexual favors. Though the case initially looked really bad as human trafficking was reported to be involved, that turned out to be inaccurate. Kraft, 77, has pleaded not guilty but did issue a public apology on the matter. As of now, the NFL has not taken any disciplinary action. Regardless, it was a bad look for Kraft if for no other reason than he resorted to using one of the same lawyers who repped Jeffrey Epstein, Jack Goldberger, to get him off on the solicitation charge.\n\n5. Spygate involving the Jets in 2007\n\nJets quarterback Chad Pennington speaks to head coach Eric Mangini. (Al Pereira/Getty)\n\nDuring a game against the Jets \u2014 who were coached by former Belichick assistant Eric Mangini at the time \u2014 Patriots video assistant Matt Estrella was caught on the team\u2019s sideline videotaping the New York\u2019s defensive signals. Afterward, it came to light that Mangini had tipped off security beforehand. Belichick apologized, but the league investigated the team because videotaping on the sidelines is clearly prohibited by NFL rules. When all was said and done, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell handed down a $500,000 fine to Belichick and a $250,000 fine for the organization along with the loss of their first-round draft pick. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was any kind of significant advantage, but I wasn\u2019t going to give them the convenience of doing it in our stadium, and I wanted to shut it down,\u201d Mangini said of filming signals. \u201cBut there was no intent to get the league involved. There was no intent to have the landslide that it has become.\u201d\n\n4. Malcolm Butler\u2019s Benching at Super Bowl LII\n\nMalcolm Butler (21) on the sideline at Super Bowl LII. (Barry Chin/Boston Globe via Getty)\n\nIn what is probably Belichick\u2019s most-hated coaching decision, among New England fans anyway, he benched defensive back Malcolm Butler against the Eagles in a game where the Patriots defense gave up 41 points to backup quarterback Nick Foles. Butler played a single snap on special teams, but otherwise spent the game on the sideline. Neither Belichick nor Butler has ever shared a reason as to why cornerback, who was a hero for the Patriots in their Super Bowl win over the Seahawks just three years earlier, rode the pine against Philadelphia. However, the scuttlebutt on Boston sports radio is that it has something to do with Butler and Belichick\u2019s son Stephen, who is currently a safeties coach for the Patriots.\n\n3. Videotaping the Rams Walk-Thru at Super Bowl XXXVI\n\nRams running back Marshall Faulk at Super Bowl XXXVI. (Stan Honda/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nIn the wake of Spygate, The Boston Herald reported that a Patriots employee filmed a walk-thru by the Rams\u2019 offense prior to Super Bowl XXXVI. \u201cThe suggestion that the New England Patriots recorded the St. Louis Rams\u2019 walkthrough on the day before Super Bowl XXXVI in 2002 is absolutely false,\u201d the Patriots declared. \u201cAny suggestion to the contrary is untrue.\u201d The NFL investigated the matter but couldn\u2019t find any \u201ccredible\u201d information that substantiated the paper\u2019s claim. Eventually, The Herald even retracted the story. Regardless, the damage was done, and former Rams running back Marshall Faulk complaining about this has become an annual occurrence.\n\n2. The Deflategate Saga of 2015-16\n\nA Cardinals fan holds up a sign referencing Deflategate (Ethan Miller/Getty)\n\nThere are too many details to rehash in this multi-year drama, but it ended with an NFL investigation finding it was \u201cmore probable than not\u201d that the Patriots deliberately used under-inflated footballs during their AFC championship game victory over the Indianapolis Colts, a decision that was ultimately upheld by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Brady was suspended for four games for the offense and the guys who were responsible for dealing with his footballs, Jim McNally (Patriots locker room attendant) and John Jastremski (Patriots equipment assistant), vanished to parts unknown. A few years ago, comedian Jim Breuer claimed he ran into Jastremski in Cancun. \u201cHe said they were getting death threats, the Patriots fired him, said they were going to take care of him,\u201d Breuer said. \u201cI remember he said he was waiting for them to get back to him soon, but every time they say that, they don\u2019t do anything about it. He\u2019s jobless. They said they were going to take care of them. He kept saying, \u2018Tom Brady was my guy, he has always been so good to me.\u2019\u201d\n\n1. The Tuck-Rule Game vs. the Raiders in 2002\n\nThe controversy that launched a thousand ships. In Brady\u2019s first-ever playoff game at a snowy Foxboro Stadium, he dropped back to pass in the fourth quarter with his team down three points and seemed to fumble the ball when he was hit by Charles Woodson of the Raiders. Oakland recovered and seemed to have the win locked up. But, upon review, officials reversed this call and declared the play an incomplete forward pass because Brady had been attempting to \u201ctuck\u201d the ball and stop his throw when he was hit by Woodson. With the ball back, the Patriots were able to tie the game and then win it in overtime courtesy of an Adam Vinatieri field goal. Two games later, the Patriots won Super Bowl XXXVI, New England\u2019s first \u2014 and, as we know, far from their last.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: Out of respect to the family of Aaron Hernandez and families of his victims, he\u2019s omitted from this light-hearted Labor Day weekend read.", "description": "The top 10 controversies the Patriots have been involved in while they went from being the Little Team That Could in '01 to an institution of NFL dominance.", "authors": ["Evan Bleier"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-631694474.jpg?fit=1024%2C709"}
