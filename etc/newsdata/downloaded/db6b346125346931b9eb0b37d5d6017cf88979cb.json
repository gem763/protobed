But it turns out that her dad is. A big one. In a recent interview with the Guardian, Rapinoe shared how frustrated she was that her parents could support the current president, watch Fox News, and still be \"proud\" of her. She suggested they sign up for \"therapy.\"\n\n\u201cI feel like I grew up with all of these lessons (about equality), but nothing was ever spoken. No language was ever put about it,\u201d Rapinoe said. \u201cBoth of my parents should be really progressive \u2014 especially my mom \u2014 and I don\u2019t get that they\u2019re not.\"\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always saying, \u2018You guys should really be Democrats!\u2019 But they\u2019re not, so what\u2019s happening?\u201d\n\nHer dad is the bigger offender it sounded like, because she's pretty sure he voted for Trump.\n\n\u201cI think my dad voted for Trump and I\u2019ll say, \u2018I don\u2019t get it,\" Rapinoe mused. \"How are you simultaneously as proud as punch of me, and watching Fox News all the time, [who are doing] takedowns of your daughter? That\u2019s why I\u2019m like, \u2018You guys need to go to therapy.\u2019\u201d\n\nRapinoe, one of the openly gay players on the USWNT, told a reporter last month in the middle of the Women's World Cup that there was \"no f**ing way\" she's going to the White House if the U.S. wins and Trump invites them. She's opposed to his policies and has taken a knee at some U.S. national games in protest, \u00e0 la Colin Kaepernick. She did stand during the national anthem at the World Cup, but did not sing or put her hand over her heart.\n\nRapinoe and her teammates are also lobbying the U.S. Soccer Federation for equal pay between the men's and women's teams. Yet, the federation released a report a few weeks ago detailing how the women actually earn more than the men.\n\nThe USWNT called those statistics \"utterly false.\"", "description": "We know that U.S. women's soccer star Megan Rapinoe, whose .09/02/2019 3:00:21AM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2017/39/676c0fe5-78c2-4414-9e56-e21405e73ca5.jpg"}
