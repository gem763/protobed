She now faces a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison and is due back in court for sentencing in December.\n\nLi is one of 19 defendants named in a series of indictments unsealed in January that contain the first-ever criminal charges against those involved in the birth tourism trade. She is the first operator involved in the scheme to plead guilty.\n\nLi admitted that she ran a birth tourism company called You Win USA Vacation Services Corp. that operated out of both California and China from 2013 to 2015. As part of the scheme, wealthy foreign nationals \u2014 many of them from China \u2014 would pay Li's company to help them travel and stay in the US so their children would be born US citizens.\n\nOver 30 countries in the world, including the US, Canada, Brazil, and Mexico, offer birthright citizenship automatically.\n\nIn her plea deal, Li said You Win would help coach women on how to pass through US customs and hide their pregnancies.\n\nCustomers would lie to the US Consulate in China and say they were only planning to come to the US for two weeks. They were also advised to fly first through Hawaii, and then to California, as it would be easier to clear immigration there.\n\nRead more: More than 30 other countries recognize birthright citizenship \u2014 here's the full list\n\nAccording to a January indictment, Li's company marketed that it had over 500 Chinese customers seeking their assistance.
