It was triggered when Minneapolis demanded $530,000 to cover security costs for Trump\u2019s campaign rally.\n\nThe president\u2019s campaign has developed a reputation for not reimbursing cities for security costs incurred as a result of his rallies \u2014 even as his campaign raises record amounts of money. At least 10 cities have complained that the campaign has not paid them for police and fire department costs, totaling more than $840,000, according to a study this summer by the Center for Public Integrity .\n\nThe Trump campaign owes $569,000 to El Paso, Texas, for a rally there in February, local station CBS-4 TV reported earlier this month. The money represents 15% of the city\u2019s total debt.\n\nEarlier this week, Trump slammed Frey as a \u201cRadical Left Mayor\u201d out to squelch free speech. Frey replied that Midwesterners \u201cpay our bills\u201d and that the president\u2019s campaign can afford to pitch in.\n\nYawn... Welcome to Minneapolis where we pay our bills, we govern with integrity, and we love all of our neighbors. https://t.co/v1cXvoD9uR \u2014 Jacob Frey (@Jacob_Frey) October 8, 2019\n\nSomeone tell the President of the United States that he can afford to help pay for the extra time our officers will be putting in while he\u2019s in town. https://t.co/bXITaPdW4E \u2014 Jacob Frey (@Jacob_Frey) October 8, 2019\n\nFrey reiterated in a tweet Thursday that city residents shouldn\u2019t be stuck with the tab for Trump\u2019s campaign rally.\n\nMy position remains unchanged: Minneapolis taxpayers should not have to bear the brunt of operating costs resulting from the president\u2019s visit. https://t.co/qo80JKG23o \u2014 Jacob Frey (@Jacob_Frey) October 10, 2019", "description": "It's the latest blast between Trump and Mayor Jacob Frey, who wants the Trump campaign to cover its costs to his city.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9fc7d4200000da064ffbde.jpeg?cache=zdq4we10dv&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
