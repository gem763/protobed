Actually, you might relate to it even if you aren\u2019t unhappy with your loyalty program.\n\nFranklin, an American Express cardholder since 1969, was trying to redeem some of the 500,000 points he\u2019d accumulated on his card over the years. He thought it would be easy to turn the rewards into business-class tickets to Brazil.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t.\n\nOne representative told him that his points would cover only part of the cost of his flights and that he\u2019d have to make up the rest with cash. Another said the points would cover the cost of the outbound flight but not the return.\n\n\u201cI spent an hour on the phone, mostly on hold,\u201d says Franklin, a retired executive search consultant who lives in the District.\n\nAn American Express representative told Franklin that his points weren\u2019t as valuable as he thought \u2014 only about a penny apiece \u2014 which made him regret his decision to spend thousands of dollars with the card.\n\n\u201cI feel like a complete fool, having all these years figured there would be a trip of our lives, for which I would use points,\u201d he says.\n\nFranklin belongs to a growing group of consumers who are unhappy with their loyalty programs. These travelers have spent years, even decades, accumulating miles and points, only to discover that the loyalty only goes one way. They\u2019re also learning a few hard truths about the actual value of being a frequent traveler \u2014 facts you need to know before you make your next booking.\n\nTo reach their profit goals, travel companies have devalued the programs to the point of irrelevance. They do that by requiring more points for a \u201cfree\u201d room or airline seat or by imposing fees to redeem points.\n\n\u201cRewards programs are no longer the great benefit they were,\u201d says Andy Abramson, a communications consultant from Los Angeles who, as a frequent business traveler, has elite status with several airlines and hotel chains. \u201cOn the airline side, availability is getting tighter and tighter, and costlier,\u201d Abramson says. \u201cFor hotels, travelers often find themselves in a room far below what they usually stay in while earning the points.\u201d\n\nOf course, travel rewards programs still have legions of fans who insist that participating in an airline or hotel loyalty program has many benefits, such as \u201cfree\u201d tickets and upgrades, the ability to check a bag without paying for it, and first-class lounge access. Rewards program enthusiasts take to blogs and online forums to celebrate the loyalty lifestyle, angrily shouting down anyone who dares to question the wisdom of their choices.\n\nBut an increasing number of travelers are doing just that. They note that the tickets and upgrades are not free but earned through months or years of flying, staying and spending \u2014 often paying far more for less convenient arrangements than they could have made elsewhere. Plus, everyone used to be able to check the first bag without paying extra, which makes a \u201cfree\u201d bag offer seem like an empty gesture, at best. And they bemoan that travel has become so stratified, particularly air travel. It seems as if seats in the back of the plane keep shrinking to make room for bigger, lie-flat seats in business class.\n\n\u201cI used to be addicted to airline miles and especially airline status,\u201d says Seth Kaplan, a transportation analyst in the District. \u201cMany times, I paid a little extra or made an inconvenient connection to qualify or requalify for elite status on a particular airline. I no longer do that, and I actually find it quite liberating to just buy the cheapest or most convenient flight, or the flight on the airline I\u2019d like to fly, regardless of whether I have status on that airline.\u201d\n\nKaplan hasn\u2019t cut up his points-generating card yet. But his points are now just a byproduct of his travels, and although they are worth something, he says, \u201cthey are worth less than they were.\u201d\n\nLoyalty program critics say there are a few things you have to know about the rewards game, whether you\u2019re collecting points through a credit card or accumulating frequent-flier miles in a traditional program.\n\n\u2022 They\u2019re not really for the frequent traveler anymore. They should be called frequent \u201cspender\u201d programs instead. Most of the major loyalty programs reward you based on how much revenue you bring to the company. So unless you\u2019re a big-spending business traveler or spend a lot on a credit card, this may not be a game you can win.\n\n\u2022 Points and miles almost always lose value. Even the best programs are susceptible to inflation, which means the 25,000 points you need for a hotel room today might become 35,000 points next year. Stockpiling rewards for a special trip, as Franklin did, can be an exercise in futility.\n\n\u2022 The terms of many programs are absurd. Read your card member agreement or your loyalty program rules for the details. For example, did you know that your miles don\u2019t really belong to you? Your travel company can change the rules at any time, for any reason. It\u2019s all in the fine print.\n\nLoyalty program critics used to be ridiculed by other frequent travelers for being naive or feeling entitled, or both. But recent events have shifted the discussion in favor of people who are unhappy with their programs. The much-criticized launch of Marriott\u2019s Bonvoy loyalty program, as well as several recent program downgrades, have made the naysayers look a lot smarter. And the travel industry is scrambling to control the damage \u2014 and to prove that loyalty programs are worth something.\n\nSo when Franklin sent a certified letter to the CEO of American Express, he shouldn\u2019t have been surprised by the prompt response. Or the resolution.\n\n\u201cI received a call from a very professional American Express representative,\u201d he says. \u201cI got the nice phone treatment, but that\u2019s all. I ended up buying two coach round-trip tickets out of pocket.\u201d", "description": "Changing rules and devalued points reduce the allure of rewards programs.", "authors": ["Christopher Elliott", "Elliott Is A Consumer Advocate", "Journalist", "Co-Founder Of The Advocacy Group Travelers United.
