(AP) - A black former employee at a suburban Portland Apple store who says managers repeatedly failed to support him and ultimately fired him after years of racist behavior from customers has filed a $750,000 lawsuit against the technology giant.\n\nThe Oregonian/OregonLive reports in a lawsuit filed last week, Joshua Holt says white customers \u201cconstantly asked\u201d if he worked at the Tigard store even though he\u2019d just welcomed them inside.\n\nThe suit says customers referred to him \u201cboy\u201d; and customers would avoid him or ignore him and instead ask for assistance from white employees.\n\nThe lawsuit says when Holt shared these experiences with co-workers and management he was often told to \u201cassume positive intent\u201d or that he was overreacting or too negative.\n\nThe suit says Holt was hired in 2001 and worked in other stores where he thrived before he was assigned to the store in Tigard.\n\nApple, through spokeswoman Rachel Wolf Tulley, declined to comment on the pending litigation.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Oregonian/OregonLive, http://www.oregonlive.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A black former employee at a suburban Portland Apple store who says managers repeatedly failed to support him and ultimately fired him after years of racist behavior from customers has filed a $750,000 lawsuit against the technology giant.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
