Our story starts with a post by Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky.\n\nThe number of hunting licenses sold in the United States last year was greater than the ten biggest armies in the world combined. Politicians considering gun confiscation (aka mandatory buybacks) should chew on that. \u2014 Thomas Massie (@RepThomasMassie) September 14, 2019\n\nBut when you hunt you use those rifles that are made of wood that are less scary-looking than assault weapons with their grenade launchers and chainsaw bayonets.\n\nYou can hunt without AR-15s, mon ch\u00e8re. https://t.co/sb8m6eZCa2 \u2014 Schuyler Smith (@schuylerannemac) September 14, 2019\n\nEven better \u2026 you can hunt with an AR-15, which is perfectly legal to own and use. It\u2019s up to you \u2026 and still will be in 2021.\n\nOK, here\u2019s where we get to the tweet where we feel like we should black out the name and set up an immediate intervention by Stephen Gutowski.\n\nHere is the thing\u2026 I don't think you could even eat the meat of an animal killed with a semi automatic weapon. It would be so full of shrapnel. #Beto2020 #nomorefear https://t.co/Bxd98ZW4rE \u2014 TexasMomsforBeto! (@texlynnforever) September 14, 2019\n\nAn animal \u2026 killed with a semi-automatic weapon \u2026 would be too full of shrapnel to eat.\n\nOh god poor animal \u2014 Schuyler Smith (@schuylerannemac) September 14, 2019\n\nOh JFC. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 \u2014 \ud83c\udfc8Duchess of Football AnnaD\ud83c\udfc8 (@AnnaDsays) September 15, 2019\n\nMost common \u201chunting\u201d rifles for whitetail deer are 30-06 Springfield, .308 Win. 270 Win. etc. Most AR-15\u2019s fire a 5.56mm NATO which is significantly less powerful than the first rounds mentioned. I can paste a link of the ballistics charts if you\u2019d like. \u2014 Steven Sturgill (@StevenSturgill3) September 14, 2019\n\nWe don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to help.\n\nIt is wise to do research before saying silly things. \u2014 John Sweeney (@johnsweeney15) September 14, 2019\n\nOnly if you use the Semtex-tipped mega nuke rounds. \u2014 CITIZEN//ULTRAVIOLET (@ITMCitizen) September 14, 2019\n\nYea cuz when I\u2019m hunting deer I like to hit em with grenade launchers \u2014 Whiskey Silver (@BirdTalk16) September 14, 2019\n\nThis is true. When I hunt, I rely solely upon air strikes and artillery. Silly libs. \u2014 QuizzicalRepub (@QuizzicalRepub) September 15, 2019\n\nLand of Goshen, woman. The majority of hunting guns are semiautomatic. Just because you have the capacity for a follow-up shot doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going hog wild filling a deer with lead. \u2014 Edward (@Savvy_Opinion) September 14, 2019\n\nYou clearly have no understanding of rounds, and their ballistics. The only rounds in public use that even explode so to say are hollow points, and hydra shocks. Both of which I have in my home defense tools. 5.56 rounds tumble once in the body to damage organs but not always \u2014 Ivan Focugyes (@IFocugyes) September 14, 2019\n\nJesus what did you shoot and with what gun and more importantly what rounds pic.twitter.com/KYGKpSBGvu \u2014 \u2764\ufe0f Jayvie \u2764\ufe0f (@OneFineJay) September 15, 2019\n\nLOL Nice try. \u2014 Milo Stone (@GooberGabbing) September 15, 2019\n\nWhere is this \"shrapnel\" coming from? \u2014 Adeptus Trashmechanicus (@BrainMechanical) September 14, 2019\n\nThe shotgun shells that can't be shot out of an AR-15, of course. \u2014 \u1d30\u1d2c\u1d5b\u1d35\u1d30 \u1d33\u1d3f\u1d2c\u1d5b\u1d5e \ud83e\udd99\ud83c\udff4 (@spirit_llama) September 14, 2019\n\nBecause when hunting with an AR it is best to shoot the animal 30-40 times \u2014 Ken McNeill (@KennyMac1550) September 14, 2019\n\nObviously you\u2019ve never hunted. Have you ever cleaned a deer, hog or turkey? \u2014 Lokipedia my pronoun is My Lord and Sayter (@Lyesmyth) September 14, 2019\n\nWhere did you get this idea? \u2014 Christian Larsen (@motoraderGP) September 14, 2019\n\nWhat? You've never hunted, obviously. \u2014 Vern Demerest (@TxAv8r) September 14, 2019\n\nJFC delete this tweet. \u2014 PopeBBPH IV (@BBPHthefourth) September 14, 2019\n\nWhatever happened to researching a topic you know about before making claims that are not true? \u2014 Coquette Humphrey (@CoquetteHumphr2) September 14, 2019\n\nThis is a parody account right? \u2014 john donaldson (@showme1176) September 14, 2019\n\nYou've never seen a gun before, have you. \u2014 Dead Agent (@Recursion_Agent) September 14, 2019\n\nAnd Democrats seem so shocked that we want to pin them down on a definition of \u201cassault weapon\u201d before they start writing their confiscation executive orders.\n\nRelated:", "description": "", "authors": ["Brett T.", "Posted At Pm On September"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nothowitworks_new.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
