That ruling is estimated to be about nine months behind.\n\nSpeaking to CNBC's Charlotte Reed Wednesday, Airbus's Chief Commercial Officer (CCO), Christian Scherer, said the legal action was unlikely to benefit either firm.\n\n\"I don't think that the aerospace communities or eco-systems on either side of the Atlantic have anything to gain (by) going at each other's jugular,\" he said at the launch of the firm's annual commercial outlook.\n\nScherer said Airbus procures 40% of components and expertise from the United States and described the effect of disruption to its U.S. supply chain as potentially \"very, very violent.\"\n\nThe CCO called on politicians, trade regulators, and industry chiefs to get together and draw a line under the decades-long dispute.\n\n\"We are hopeful that these positions that are being taken are going to bring the parties to the table to finally bury on the hatchet on this transatlantic feud.\"", "description": "Both aerospace giants stand accused of receiving illegal subsidies and are subject to WTO investigations.", "authors": ["David Reid", "In Cnbcdavy"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106136154-1568811658879gettyimages-979833274.jpeg?v=1568811745"}
