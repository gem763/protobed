The owner was able to reclaim their pet and explained Muggsy had escaped through a hole in a backyard fence.\n\n\"Muggsey is just visiting and spends most of his time on a ranch in the country where he has space to explore,\" Dallas Animal Services said on Facebook.\n\nThe agency said wallabies are legal to keep in the city of Dallas with a proper permit.", "description": "Authorities in Dallas captured an escaped wallaby seen hopping freely around a neighborhood on the east side of the city.", "authors": ["Ben Hooper"], "top_image": "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/1471553175386/2019/i/15531756779726/v1.5/Escaped-wallaby-captured-in-Dallas-neighborhood.jpg?lg=2", "published_at": "2019-03-21"}
