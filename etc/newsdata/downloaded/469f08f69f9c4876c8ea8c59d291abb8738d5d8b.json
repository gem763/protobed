Specifically, the company was found to have established rules for union organizing and paraphernalia that go against labor law, terminated two employees unfairly, interrogated employees about their union activities and telling them that joining a union would be futile.\n\nThe judge also specifically pointed to a tweet from Musk on May 20, 2018, and agreed with the complainants that it was a public threat against organizing a union. In the tweet, Musk was found to have suggested that the introduction of a union at the automotive factory would result in the loss of stock options for employees.\n\nNothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues & give up stock options for nothing? Our safety record is 2X better than when plant was UAW & everybody already gets healthcare. \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 21, 2018\n\n\u201cMusk\u2019s tweet can only be read by a reasonable employee to indicate that if the employees vote to unionize that they would give up stock options,\u201d the judge wrote. \u201cMusk threatened to take away a benefit enjoyed by the employees consequently for voting to unionize.\u201d\n\nIn response, the judge ruled that Tesla must stop precluding union literature from being handed out in the Fremont facility\u2019s parking lot and allow employees to distribute and wear paraphernalia from the union, along with other activities. The two employees who were terminated \u2014 Richard Ortiz and Jose Moran, the latter of whom took the fight for a union public in a February 2017 blog post \u2014 must be offered their jobs back and compensated for missed time and other issues resulting from their terminations.\n\nSee also: Tesla\u2019s third-quarter sales seen on the rise\n\nIn addition, the judge ruled that Musk \u2014 or a board representative with Musk present \u2014 must read aloud a notice to employees summarizing the changes Tesla must make at the Fremont facility, \"scheduled to ensure the widest possible attendance.\u201d Judge Tracy noted that such an order \u201cis an extraordinary remedy,\u201d but said it was warranted in Tesla\u2019s case.\n\n\u201cSuch pervasive unlawful conduct, as described and found herein, warrants a broad cease-and-desist order and a notice reading,\u201d the judge wrote. \u201cSuch a public reading of the notice will serve to reassure employees that their employer and its managers are bound by the Act\u2019s requirements.\u201d\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment following the release of the ruling.\n\nTesla shares were largely unaffected in after-hours trading Friday. The stock closed with a 0.2% decline at $242.13, a day after enjoying strong gains after rolling out new features for cars and the publication of an internal email from Musk that proclaimed the company was nearing its first quarter of delivering 100,000 cars. The stock has declined 27.2% so far this year, as the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.53% has increased 18.2%.", "description": "Tesla Inc. and Chief Executive Elon Musk improperly sought to squelch a union organizing effort at the electric-car company\u2019s Fremont, Calif., factory with...", "authors": ["Jeremy C.
