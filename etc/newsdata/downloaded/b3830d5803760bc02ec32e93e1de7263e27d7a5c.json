This included everything from reading to creative writing classes; to piano lessons and beyond.\n\nThough Shaniqwa may have rather been hanging with her friends at the time, looking back, she\u2019s come to realise just how important her mother\u2019s persistence was in shaping her as the creative she is today. Now with over 20 years of industry experience under her belt, shooting campaigns for Supreme, as well as portraits of Janelle Mon\u00e1e and Cardi B, Shaniqwa has risen the ranks in the face of adversity to become one of the industry\u2019s esteemed image-makers. It\u2019s no surprise, then, that The North Face enlisted the New York native to shoot and creative direct their latest campaign, comprising of a film documenting her rise, and a series of images that sees a cast diverse in age, race and gender shot in the brand\u2019s iconic 95 Retro Denali jacket, a piece she once wore and loved herself.\n\nTo toast the campaign\u2019s release, we caught up with Saniqwa to learn a little more of the stories her latest work has to tell.\n\nYour mother features pretty centrally in the film: it\u2019s her voice that we can hear in the voiceover, isn\u2019t it? Why did you want to include her in this project?\n\nYes, that\u2019s right! She\u2019s such an inspirational figure and has a huge influence on my life \u2014 obviously, because she\u2019s my mom. But she was particularly important for my creative development. She was a single mom raising a black child in New York City, working all the time. She was like \u201cI\u2019m not about to have you out in these streets whiling. I want you to be the best that you can be.\u201d As a kid, I wasn\u2019t always happy to go to piano lessons or creative writing classes instead of hanging with my friends, but looking back, all of those things are what powered me through the day. I wanted to make sure that I could give her flowers, so to speak, while she\u2019s still here.\n\nThe film also features archival stills and camcorder footage from your childhood. How did that come about?\n\nThere\u2019s actually a funny backstory to it all. When The North Face first approached me about making this film, they were going to have another person direct it and have me tell my story directly. The thing is, though, I\u2019m incredibly shy and didn\u2019t want to actually be in a film. So the best way around that was to tell my story through imagery and avoid the need for me to actually be in it. That was the impetus of me wanting to use the archival footage that I had, but I also felt it was just super important to show how long I\u2019ve been documenting \u2014 it\u2019s great to show that I\u2019ve been doing all of this stuff for more than 30 years. I just wanted those that look at me, those interested in how my creativity as an artist has grown, to see where it all started. I think it\u2019s really important as creatives to show where we\u2019ve come from and the things that have lead us to make the work we do.\n\nEven in my early photography, from the age of eight, I can see that I always centred people and always had a particular sort of composition going on. That\u2019s not to say that they were great photos, but I can see that I\u2019ve always been making the same sort of image. In the film, there\u2019s also footage from a family trip to Senegal I hadn\u2019t seen before; I had to dig it out and digitise it. I hadn\u2019t actually heard my own voice before, so it was interesting to think about who that girl was then and what she was thinking about.\n\nWas that your first experience of making images?\n\nI remember it feeling like a really important moment. We\u2019d travelled a bunch before that trip, but my mum would never allow me to hold the camcorder. My mum and my dad were always taking photos of \u201cmoments\u201d -- parties, for example -- so I think I was always aware of how to build visual language through my family. But that trip was particularly important as I felt the significance of where we were, and of my mother handing over this massive camcorder to document the trip. It felt like a real moment of responsibility, something that I had to get right.\n\nYour experience has been a pretty international one. How has travel shaped your approach to photography?\n\nI think travel has allowed me to be super open. It\u2019s one thing when your family teaches you to love and accept everyone, and it\u2019s another when you go out and live among other people and cultures; you quickly realise how similar but different we are, and to love and respect all of that. I love that I\u2019m a part of a global community; it\u2019s really shifted who I am and how I see things.\n\nYour photographic style has a sense of being oddly familiar yet original. How did you bring that to this campaign for The North Face?\n\nThis campaign was great to work on as I was asked to come on both to creative-direct and shoot. I was able to fully materialise the image I had in my head of what the Denali jacket means today. For me, the Denali is a jacket that I\u2019ve worn since I was in high school and early college. I wore it all the time until it was stolen from me, as kids did back in the day. I think I was trying to connect to the question, \u201cWhat is New York?\u201d, as well as to their slogan \u201cNever Stop Exploring\u201d. I wanted to bring that all together and give a true, honest depiction of what a New York City kid wearing North Face today would look like.\n\nYou\u2019ve previously called out racism and sexism in the industry. What\u2019s your take on the current state of affairs, especially for those behind the camera?\n\n\n\nHaving worked in this industry in different iterations for the past 20-plus years, I\u2019ve seen so many things happen. There have been situations where I\u2019ve loved what\u2019s happening, all of these people speaking out, seeing all of these doors being kicked open and people being pulled through. That said, I do think that we\u2019re currently in a weird time. I don\u2019t know if all the good that\u2019s currently being done is just a little blip, or if it\u2019s here to stay. There\u2019s so much work that still needs to be done because there aren\u2019t enough of our stories being put out there. There are these little narratives, but what I do is raise up and bring up other people who either look like me or feel like me, because it\u2019s so important that blackness isn\u2019t just told through a white lens. That\u2019s why I made this film about my mom, and about my coming-up; we don\u2019t celebrate that enough, especially as black women. And I feel that if I can keep pushing in this subtle way, it\u2019ll become the norm.\n\nThis article originally appeared on i-D UK.", "description": "The i-D contributor talks her recent collaboration with the outerwear brand, and why she owes it all to mom.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5da0827b663430000a941c8e/lede/1570801805632-shaniqwa.jpeg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
