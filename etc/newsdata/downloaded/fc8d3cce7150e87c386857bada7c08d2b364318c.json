Robocop FAIL raises questions", "language": "en", "text": "This was a bit of an obscure story we covered back in June but it now has a rather disturbing update. It dealt with a somewhat autonomous robot cop that was patrolling a beat in the Hunting Park area near Los Angeles. Unlike the Alex Murphy cyborg from the original movie, this robocop has no weapons and doesn\u2019t even look humanoid. At least to me, it looks like a tall, very expensive Roomba.\n\nStill, what\u2019s the harm, right? It rolls around the park and takes pictures and video for the police, along with shouting out cheerful greetings to people who come near it. And it can record and report crimes, summoning the human police in times of need. What\u2019s not to like?\n\nWell, as it turns out, the robot was engaged by a civilian during the commission of a crime and finally had the chance to earn its pay. And it failed. Spectacularly. (NBC News)\n\nWhen a fight broke out recently in the parking lot of Salt Lake Park, a few miles south of downtown Los Angeles, Cogo Guebara did what seemed the most practical thing at the time: she ran over to the park\u2019s police robot to push its emergency alert button. \u201cI was pushing the button but it said, \u2018step out of the way,\u2019\u201d Guebara said. \u201cIt just kept ringing and ringing, and I kept pushing and pushing.\u201d She thought maybe the robot, which stands about 5 feet tall and has \u201cPOLICE\u201d emblazoned on its egg-shaped body, wanted a visual of her face, so she crouched down for the camera. It still didn\u2019t work.\n\nSo here\u2019s this woman witnessing a violent confrontation and she\u2019s frantically pushing the helpful looking button on the robot that says \u201cEmergency Alert.\u201d But nothing happens. Her friend finally dials 911, but by the time the cops arrive (fifteen minutes later) there\u2019s a woman being wheeled out to an ambulance and the assailants are long gone.\n\nThe (human) police had an explanation. As it turns out, the Emergency Alert button was never connected to the 911 dispatch office. The messages were being sent instead to the manufacturer of the robot, where they either didn\u2019t receive them or had no idea what to do with them. And after yelling at the women to get out of the way, the robot reportedly continued gliding smoothly along past the ongoing fight, continuing on its route through the park playing some sort of science fiction melody as it went.\n\nSo\u2026 how much did you pay for this robocop again? It must have been fairly embarrassing for the robot police officer because it hasn\u2019t tweeted anything about the incident since it happened. (Yes, the robocop has a Twitter account because of course it would.) Then again, it hasn\u2019t tweeted anything since July 12. Maybe it\u2019s just shy on social media.\n\nWe can look at this as just another funny technological epic fail story, but it might be hinting at something more serious. We\u2019re apparently faced with a choice, with one option being comparatively \u201cdumb\u201d robots that look like they\u2019re doing something useful but wind up being kind of useless. Or we can opt for seriously muscular Artificial Intelligence robots that can kick serious butt like the ones from Boston Dynamics. But then we have to wonder what happens when that technology goes off the rails.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s just me, but particularly when it comes to police work, maybe we should just stick with human beings. Especially if we\u2019re going to give them guns.", "description": "Win some, lose some", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Robocop.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
