Former governor and congressman and current Trump critic Mark Sanford tells FNC\u2019s Bill Hemmer, \u201cI believe I\u2019ll vote for President Trump. It\u2019s my default.\u201d\n\nIf you watched the joint interview on CNN Sunday morning with Mark Sanford and Joe Walsh, two of the three challengers of Trump in the GOP primary, you probably noticed that Sanford was far less strident than Walsh on the subject of impeachment. On State of the Union with Jake Tapper, Sanford was a voice of reason while Walsh went over the cliff. Sanford suggested censure instead of impeachment and to go slowly after taking a vote in the House. Walsh wants a more drastic approach and solution.\n\nI don\u2019t understand that, with all due respect Mark. This president deserves to be impeached. Nobody from the White House and no high level Republicans are on this show today because there\u2019s nothing to defend. This president betrayed his country again this week. Would I vote if I were in Congress on the inquiry? There\u2019s enough we know now to vote to impeach this president,\u201d Walsh responded. \u201cDonald Trump is a traitor,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhen you look at traitor more broadly defined, this president betrayed our country again this week. It\u2019s not the first time he did it. Excuse me. I don\u2019t know that we should move forward incrementally. This president needs to be impeached.\u201d Sanford disagreed, saying \u201cfor people to step out and say he needs to be impeached is to actually diminish and discard what the very process that\u2019s laid out by our Founding Fathers.\u201d\n\nWhen Tapper asked Sanford if he will vote for Trump in the 2020 election, he replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cWhat I\u2019ve said is I\u2019m an issue guy.\u201d So, the headlines read that Sanford didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d vote for Trump.\n\nThat was Sunday, though, and this is Monday. In the Age of Trump, narratives change quickly. In a Monday morning interview on FNC with Bill Hemmer, Sanford stressed he is \u201can issues guy\u201d. His reason for challenging Trump is all about fiscal issues. He\u2019s trying to raise awareness on the debt and deficits and big spending. He says while Democrats aren\u2019t talking about all of that, neither are Republicans. \u201cI believe I\u2019ll vote for President Trump. It\u2019s my default. But, we\u2019re at the front end of an impeachment inquiry and I don\u2019t know where it goes. What I said was we ought to follow the process wherever it goes.\u201d He said he does believe in the premise of innocent until proven guilty. That\u2019s good to know because that is the opposite of how Democrats are conducting themselves.\n\nHe believes he\u2019ll vote for Trump now.\n\nSanford calls Walsh\u2019s stance that Trump is a traitor as \u201ccrazy stuff\u201d. He recognizes that impeachment wouldn\u2019t go anywhere in the Senate and if wrongdoing can be proven, his suggestion is to censure the president. \u201cImpeachment is going nowhere.\u201d\n\nHe predicts that all this activity concerning impeachment plays into Trump\u2019s hands and will defeat Democrats in 2020. Sanford rightfully told Hemmer that in a battle of personalities, America\u2019s Heartland will side with Trump over the far left zealots in Congress, such as Nadler and Pelosi.\n\nSanford admits his primary challenge to Trump is a losing endeavor. He just wants to bring spending and debt to the forefront. He didn\u2019t mention any lingering resentment toward Trump for endorsing his primary challenger during his last political campaign. I tend to think that had a lot to do with Sanford\u2019s decision to primary Trump. He probably knows no one is very interested in what he has to say unless he\u2019s making waves as an opponent of Trump. The anti-Trump media loves that. He\u2019ll be jeopardizing future on-camera opportunities on cable television if he admits defeat and that he\u2019ll be voting for Trump after all. Sanford simply admits what any honest Republican voter will agree with \u2013 a vote for a Republican presidential candidate is better than a Democrat candidate. He knows that any of the Democrat alternatives is unacceptable for a conservative voter.", "description": "\"That's my default.\"", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/MarkSanford.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
