The closer to the knee it is the worse it is. There's no way he's going to carry on kicking because he won't be able to bend his leg as much.\n\n'Contracting that muscle is going to be horrible for him. Hopefully if he can stay on the move, keep it warm and use the physios to get it as free as possible then he'll be good to go.'\n\nKicking duties were passed on to George Ford and Elliot Daly but Farrell played the full 80 minutes as England stunned New Zealand 19-7 to reach the Rugby World Cup final.", "description": "England's Owen Farrell found himself in the wars during England's impressive Rugby World Cup semi-final win over New Zealand on Saturday.
