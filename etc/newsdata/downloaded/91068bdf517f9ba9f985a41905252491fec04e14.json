Triangles are easy to recognize and apply. There are ascending, descending, and symmetrical triangles as well as wedges and flags. I personal combine them and call them all triangles. I believe triangles have no direction bias, they just alert us to a breakout and then what to expect when that breakout occurs. Using my strategy, you will easily start using Triangle patterns successfully.What triangles do exceptionally well is give up a buy or sell opportunity as price breaks the support or resistance levels as price moves into the apex of the triangle.
