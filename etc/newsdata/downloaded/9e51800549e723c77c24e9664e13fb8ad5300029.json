The infant was later taken to the Second Maternity and Child Health Care Hospital of Shandong\u2019s provincial capital of Jinan for treatment\n\nA woman leans forward to catch a glimpse inside and the camera flashes into the box while people can be heard frantically talking and trying to make sense of it.\n\nShe unties the blanket's ribbon and slowly opens it up to reveal a small baby resting.\n\nPeople come over to the box and appear to have intense conversation with the woman who is now crouching by its side.\n\nAs the camera shifts closer to the baby, his eyes look as though they are flickering.\n\nMrs Shanghong , who discovered the baby and has two children, has said she would apply to adopt the baby if its family were not found\n\nA small cry comes from the box and the infant repeats a word sounding similar to 'mumma'.\n\nThe newborn's arm begins to move and the woman gently prods the baby - trying to check its warmth and movement. They then wrap the blanket back around its miniature body.\n\nHe was found suffering from anaemia and jaundice and transferred to the Second Maternity and Child Health Care Hospital of Shandong\u2019s provincial capital of Jinan for treatment.\n\nIt is now at a healthy 8.8 lbs, after being stumbled upon nestled into a blanket in a box, and the police are investigating claims by an individual who claims to be the baby's grandfather\n\nBut the baby has no congenital conditions and has since recovered to a healthy 8.8 lbs.\n\nThe man, who is allegedly the baby's grandfather, came forward three days after the police announced they were trying to track the family down. He claims the baby had a serious lung infection and died the day after it was born\n\nThe police have opened an investigation after a man, claiming to be the baby's grandfather, told them the baby had 'stopped breathing' and had a serious lung infection.\n\nMr Liu showed up at the Tai\u2019an\u2019s Yangliu Police Station three days after the police announced they were trying to track the family down as he had heard about it on the local news.\n\nHe said the boy 'couldn't breathe on his own' - depending on a respiratory machine, on October 20.\n\nMr Liu told BritishAsia news: 'He died on the second day [after he was born]. He couldn\u2019t drink or eat. After he died, we buried him.'\n\nThe man said he 'can't stop thinking about [the baby]' and is happy and sad at the same time.\n\nMrs Shanghong, who discovered the baby and has two children, has said she would apply to adopt the baby if its family were not found.\n\nIt remains unclear whether this still stands as the grandfather has come forward.\n\nLocal authorities are investigating Mr Liu's claims.", "description": "A newborn baby was discovered buried alive by Jiao Xinglu and Zhou Shangdong, who were hunting for mushrooms in the mountains near Laiwu, east China, on August 21.
