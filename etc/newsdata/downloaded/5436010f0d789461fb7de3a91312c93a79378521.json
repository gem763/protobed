A premier received a $15,000 crystal horse, his Chinese zodiac animal, and his son got $10,000 in golf outings and a trip to Las Vegas. A top state banking official, a son of one of China\u2019s founding fathers, accepted a $4,254 bottle of French wine \u2014 Ch\u00e2teau Lafite Rothschild, vintage 1945, the year he was born.\n\nMillions of dollars were paid out to Chinese consultants, including a business partner of the premier\u2019s family and a firm that secured a meeting for the bank\u2019s chief executive with the president. And more than 100 relatives of the Communist Party\u2019s ruling elite were hired for jobs at the bank, even though it had deemed many unqualified.\n\nThis was all part of Deutsche Bank\u2019s strategy to become a major player in China, beginning nearly two decades ago when it had virtually no presence there. And it worked. By 2011, the German company would be ranked by Bloomberg as the top bank for managing initial public offerings in China and elsewhere in Asia, outside Japan.", "description": "Confidential documents detail Deutsche Bank\u2019s influence campaign and hiring practices in China.
