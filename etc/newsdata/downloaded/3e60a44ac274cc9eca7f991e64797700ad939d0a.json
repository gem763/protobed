Mandatory Credit: Robert Deutsch-USA TODAY Sports\n\nAndreescu matched Williams\u2019 power throughout the slugfest and kept her composure under intense pressure to fend off a late comeback from the six-times champion.\n\nThe 19-year-old dropped her racket after hitting a blistering forehand return winner on match point to seal victory at Arthur Ashe Stadium and collapsed on her back after embracing her defeated opponent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so hard to explain (what the win means) in words,\u201d Andreescu said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just beyond grateful and truly blessed. I\u2019ve worked really, really hard for this moment and I can\u2019t complain. This year has been a dream come true,\u201d she added before collecting her $3.85 million winner\u2019s cheque.\n\n\u201cAnd now to be able to play on this stage against Serena, a true legend of the sport, is amazing.\u201d\n\nAndreescu, the first Canadian to win a major in the professional era, prevented Williams from equalling Margaret Court\u2019s record of 24 Grand Slam singles titles.\n\nWilliams, who has been denied the milestone in four slam finals since claiming her last major title at the Australian Open in 2017, was gracious in defeat.\n\n\u201cBianca played an unbelievable match,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIf anyone else could win the U.S. Open \u2014 except for Venus \u2014 I\u2019m glad it\u2019s Bianca,\u201d she said with a laugh, referring to her older sister who had cheered her on from the players\u2019 box, which also included Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex.\n\nIMMEDIATE PRESSURE\n\nThe fearless Andreescu pressured Williams from the outset, electing to receive after winning the coin toss and immediately breaking her childhood idol.\n\nShouting \u201ccome on\u201d after winning key points, Andreescu\u2019s vicious forehands kept Williams on the back foot while costly errors, including a double fault on set point in the first, put the American in an early hole.\n\nWith her back against the wall trailing 5-1 and facing championship point, Williams mounted a spirited comeback to draw level at 5-5, leading to deafening roars from the packed crowd in the biggest tennis stadium in the world.\n\nYet Andreescu, who covered her ears at times, regained her steely composure to cross the finish line with an emphatic forehand winner, her 19th of the match.\n\nFor Williams, her normally trusty serve proved her undoing.\n\nShe only managed to put 44 percent of her first serves in play and her nine aces were almost offset by eight double faults, three of which came on break points.\n\nAndreescu was the sharper of the pair, committing almost half as many unforced errors as Williams and thumping down five aces of her own.\n\nWhile a fierce and fiery competitor on the court, Andreescu apologised to the disappointed crowd for beating the home favourite .\n\n\u201cI know you guys wanted Serena to win. I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she said.\n\nMETEORIC RISE\n\nWhile Andreescu was a virtual unknown before this year having never made it past the second-round of a Grand Slam tournament before, Saturday\u2019s breakthrough win did not register as a shock in the tennis world.\n\nShe had made her presence felt by storming to the Indian Wells title in March and after a knee injury forced her to pull out of the Miami and Rome tournaments earlier this year after just one match, she won the Rogers Cup in Toronto last month.\n\nShe came into Flushing Meadows seeded 15th and many thought her bruising groundstrokes, creative shotmaking and speedy defence would give any opponent trouble.\n\nThat has proved especially true for the world\u2019s best players, who she seems to reserve her best tennis for.\n\nWith her win over world number eight Williams she improved to 8-0 this year against top 10 opponents.\n\nAfter ending last year ranked 178 in the world, she will reach a career high of number five on Monday.\n\nAsked if she planned to be greedy in her pursuit of more Grand Slam glory, she said: \u201cI think so.\n\n\u201cI love this feeling too much.\u201d", "description": "Canadian teenager Bianca Andreescu claimed her first Grand Slam title in a hard-hitting, nerve-jangling 6-3 7-5 win over Serena Williams on Saturday that put the brakes on the American's bid to equal the all-time record.", "authors": ["Rory Carroll", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190908&t=2&i=1427527694&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8708J-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
