The impact resulted in a torn ligament, and afterward Brees was unable to grip a football, forcing him to come out of the game.\n\nBrees has spent the past two days seeing hand specialists and reviewing options.\n\nBrees\u2019 rehabilitation is estimated to take about six weeks, but that timeline could change after surgery.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Injured Saints quarterback Drew Brees says he has surgery on his throwing thumb scheduled on Wednesday in Los Angeles.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Brett Martel"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/saints_rams_football_14377_c0-175-4171-2606_s1770x1032.jpg?ac2d06ba718761a6db46a2abdcf5e64c852b7b26", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
