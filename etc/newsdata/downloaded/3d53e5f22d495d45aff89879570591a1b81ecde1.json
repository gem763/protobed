(Richard Drew/AP)\n\nA New Jersey man has been indicted on charges that he secretly worked for the terror group Hezbollah, scouting potential targets in New York, including Grand Central Terminal, the New York Stock Exchange and the Port Authority Bus Terminal.\n\nCharges were announced Thursday against Alexei Saab, 42, and the FBI said he had been part of Hezbollah for more than 20 years. He also tried to kill a man in Lebanon under orders from one of his instructors, but the gun didn\u2019t fire, authorities said.\n\nCourt papers filed in Saab\u2019s case also show that U.S. officials have gotten significant cooperation from a former member of Saab\u2019s group who was arrested in 2017 and has since pleaded guilty.\n\nAuthorities charge Saab was part of the Islamic Jihad Organization, described as a wing of Hezbollah tasked with \u201cthe planning and coordination of intelligence, counterintelligence, and terrorist activities.\u201d Officials said Saab was arrested in July, following several months of FBI interviews in which he allegedly made admissions about his work for Hezbollah.\n\nA lawyer for Saab could not immediately be identified.\n\n[U.S. Sanctions hit Hezbollah hard]\n\nCourt papers say Saab admitted he had been recruited into Hezbollah as a college student, and received explosives and military training from the group.\n\nSaab first came to the United States in 2000, and became a U.S. citizen in 2008.\n\n\u201cEven though Saab was a naturalized American citizen, his true allegiance was to Hizballah, the terrorist organization responsible for decades of terrorist attacks that have killed hundreds, including U.S. citizens and military personnel,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman.\n\nIn 2003, Saab was allegedly instructed to \u201cto surveil certain \u2018hot spots\u2019 in New York City and to report intelligence about them to the Islamic Jihad Organzation. Saab then conducted surveillance and intelligence gathering for the IJO of dozens of locations in New York and elsewhere,\u201d including Washington, D.C. and Boston, according to court papers.\n\nHe was trained to look for \u201csoft spots\u201d in such targets \u2014 places where explosives could be placed very close to a target for maximum damage, authorities charge.\n\n\u201cSaab understood that the information he provided to the IJO would be used to calculate the size of a bomb needed to target a particular structure and the ideal location in which to place explosive devices to maximize damage,\u201d according to the criminal complaint filed against him.\n\nSaab produced a seven- to 10-page report to his terror handlers that included a map of specific locations, and a \u201cdetailed summary\u201d of each location, including United Nations headquarters, Rockefeller Center, and the Statue of Liberty, according to the complaint. The FBI said Saab also scouted possible targets in Istanbul.\n\nHe is charged with conspiring to provide material support to a terrorist group, unlawful procurement of citizenship to facilitate terrorism and marriage fraud. He faces up to 25 years in prison on the most serious charge.", "description": "FBI says Alexei Saab spent years surveilling \u201chot spots\u201d that could be attacked, including major commuter hubs and tourist destinations.", "authors": ["Devlin Barrett", "Reporter Focusing On National Security", "Law Enforcement", "September At Pm", "Devlin Barrett Writes About National Security", "Law Enforcement For The Washington Post.
