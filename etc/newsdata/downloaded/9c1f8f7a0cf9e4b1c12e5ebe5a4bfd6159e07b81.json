Every joke you tell!\u201d he says, mocking the complaints of people who are \u201ctriggered\u201d by his material. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the fuck is going on, but I think white women started it,\u201d he pronounces. \u201cI\u2019m really annoyed that white women have the balls to throw my white privilege in my face ... you\u2019re sitting in the jacuzzi with me! Quit your fuckin\u2019 whining!\u201d\n\nRead: \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 made a mistake hiring Shane Gillis\n\nHe then rags on Michelle Obama\u2019s beloved status as First Lady, claims feminism is \u201cfull of shit,\u201d ridicules the \u201covercorrection\u201d of the MeToo movement, and challenges the idea that all women should be believed. \u201cWhat about the psychos?\u201d he jokes. \u201cEverything has become absolutes.\u201d But then he starts heading in different, perhaps unexpected, directions. He makes fun of the belligerent right-wing response to the former NFL player Colin Kaepernick\u2019s kneeling protests in 2016, notes that many self-proclaimed \u201cmale feminists\u201d are covering up their own bad behavior, and digs into his own anger problems, which he says he\u2019s worked to overcome since starting a family.\n\nBurr has recorded six stand-up specials and is a fixture on Netflix, where he also created and produces the animated sitcom F Is for Family. Paper Tiger was filmed at London\u2019s Royal Albert Hall, one of the grandest and largest arenas in the country. In other words, his career is doing fantastically well, and it\u2019s not simply because Burr has a penchant for outrageous material. It\u2019s because he has the kind of onstage presence most stand-ups can only dream of\u2014as well as the ability to lead the most hostile of crowds down a precarious rhetorical path, and the self-awareness to analyze his own irate and reactionary nature.\n\nPaper Tiger\u2019s centerpiece is a digression in which Burr unpacks an argument he had with his wife (who is black) over Elvis Presley\u2019s legacy of cultural appropriation. Burr describes his wife\u2019s exhaustion with his attempts to defend Elvis, recites her incisive breakdown of why Elvis is worthy of criticism, and then exhales. \u201cFair enough, you made about seven or eight good points there that you can\u2019t refute,\u201d Burr recalls replying to his wife with a chuckle. His response to her was that anyone who flies in a plane is \u201cappropriating white culture,\u201d an incoherent joke he immediately apologizes for, while still attempting to have the last word. \u201cIf, historically speaking, black people enjoyed the same amount of freedom and privilege [as white people], they would have had the money and time to figure out how to fly, too. However ... your music would have suffered,\u201d he concludes, flashing a smug grin at the audience.", "description": "And what he doesn\u2019t", "authors": ["David Sims"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/Bill_Burr_Paper_Tiger_00_15_36_16_R/facebook.jpg?1569275033", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
