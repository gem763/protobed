An article in the Atlantic suggests that Ivanka and Don Jr. are competing with each other for the top spot in the Trump dynasty, and a \u201ccold war\u201d is intensifying between the two siblings.\n\nAs McKay Coppins writes in the piece, Ivanka was always poised to become a prominent figure in Trump\u2019s business dealings, including his political career:\n\nHe\u2019d been grooming her for years to take over the family empire. She was the golden child\u2014beautiful, telegenic, and in possession of that most important family trait: a compulsive image-consciousness.\n\nAs assistant to the president, Ivanka, along with her husband, Jared Kushner, who was appointed as a senior adviser, were instantly given more power at the start of the Trump presidency, but her father eventually began to tire of their \u201cincessant lobbying,\u201d Coppins writes.\n\nMeanwhile, Don, who always embarrassed his father with his love for hunting, was relegated to campaigning in \u201cfar-flung states no one else had time for\u201d during the 2016 election. But this ended up proving Don an asset as he appealed to gun-toting Republicans in rural America. \u201cYou can finally do something for me,\u201d Trump reportedly told him. However, when Don\u2019s Trump Tower meeting with the Russians was outed, his father didn\u2019t hold back. \u201cHe\u2019s not the sharpest knife in the drawer,\u201d Trump said.\n\nBut over the past couple of years, Ivanka and Jared\u2019s power has waned, while Don\u2019s prominence in his father\u2019s MAGA crowd has grown. As did the rivalry between the two siblings, and each accused the other of planting stories in the press, just like a primetime soap opera:\n\nA few days before the midterms, McClatchy published a story under the headline \u201cTrump Kids on the Campaign Trail: Don Jr. Wows, Ivanka Disappoints.\u201d Ivanka\u2019s camp was enraged, and suspected that Don was behind the story. Later, Don confronted Ivanka over rumors that her team was undermining him in off-the-record conversations with reporters. \u201cTell your people to stop trashing me to the media,\u201d he said, according to someone familiar with the conversation.\n\nNow, it seems like the brother and sister\u2019s roles in the family business have switched. Instead of being sent to random states like before, Don was the one to introduce his father at his reelection rally in June, with Ivanka and Jared sitting in the audience. And Don\u2019s girlfriend, former Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle, is working as a senior adviser for Trump\u2019s reelection campaign. For now, Don Jr. may very well have the upper hand.\n\nStay in touch.
