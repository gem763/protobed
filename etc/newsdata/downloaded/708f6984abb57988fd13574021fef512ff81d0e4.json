It's hot. It's like, it's hot for who, though?'\n\nHowever, the reality star fired back and told her man she didn't need the 'negative energy' of his disapproval.\n\nShe argued: 'You knew last night I was having really bad anxiety, and I don't need any more negative energy for you to now say that you're not into me wearing a tight dress.'\n\nKanye then insisted it 'affects' him when his partner poses for 'sexy' photos.\n\nHe added: 'You are my wife and it affects me when pictures are too sexy.'\n\nHowever, Kim pointed out her husband was the reason she felt confident and sexy, while insisting they were now in different places when it comes to their attitudes.\n\nShe explained: 'You built me up to be, like, this sexy person and confident and all this stuff. And just because you're on a journey, and you're on your transformation doesn't mean that I'm in the same spot with you.'", "description": "The rapper, who describes himself as a 'born again Christian', is clearly enjoying being with the kids again after being notably absent from the family's recent trip to Armenia.", "authors": ["Dailymail.Com Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/17/19892542-0-image-a-31_1571415108737.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
