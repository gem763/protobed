Usually selling for around $250, it\u2019s $199.99 right now, which is a stellar deal if you\u2019re looking for an unlocked phone that will work with every US carrier and MVNO.\n\nThis is a good choice for other reasons, too. The Moto G7 has a big, vibrant display; a slick, nearly all-glass design; and it\u2019s powerful enough to play many games at respectable frame rates. You\u2019ll also find some welcome features here that aren\u2019t available on some flagship phones, like near-stock Android software with almost no preinstalled apps (this model comes with a few Amazon apps), a headphone jack, and a microSD card so you can easily expand the phone\u2019s 64GB of internal storage.\n\nAmazon is offering both the black and white color options at this lowered price, but like all of the company\u2019s deal of the day promos, this one will last for today only.\n\nIf you value better battery life over having a slim phone, the Moto G7 Power might appeal to you. It, too, is heavily discounted today, costing $187.99 instead of the usual price of $249.99. Compared to the standard Moto G7\u2019s 3,000mAh battery, the G7 Power has a 5,000mAh battery that can last for days without recharging. That big battery makes it thicker, but otherwise, it\u2019s basically the same phone as the G7.", "description": "The Moto G7 is the best phone to buy if you\u2019re on a budget, and it\u2019s cheaper than usual.
