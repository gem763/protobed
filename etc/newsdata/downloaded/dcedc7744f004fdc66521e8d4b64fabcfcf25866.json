According to Page Six, a Thursday morning editorial meeting got \u201cheated\u201d when senior staffers \u201cattacked\u201d Oppenheim, demanding to know the extent of his prior knowledge regarding Nevils\u2019 complaint against Lauer.\n\nPage Six reported an NBC staffer pressed Oppenheim on whether Nevils, who claims Lauer raped her in his hotel room while the two were covering the Sochi Olympics in 2014, used the word \u201cassault\u201d when she first reported Lauer to NBC\u2019s HR department in 2017.\n\nOppenheim reportedly dodged the question, citing Nevils\u2019 right to privacy. A source quoted Oppenheim as saying he would never breach Nevils\u2019 confidentiality. \u201cThe whole point of that is so she can tell her story whenever, however she chooses to and she is doing so now,\u201d said Oppenheim, according to a source for Page Six.\n\nWhile a network source reportedly denied rumors of any heated interactions, calling the meeting \u201corderly,\u201d another source said it was \u201cvery contentious,\u201d adding that \u201cpeople want answers. People are demanding answers.\u201d\n\nOppenheim reportedly opened the meeting with an invitation to ask questions, telling the team, \u201cI want to literally beg you to please ask them.\u201d\n\nNBC has reportedly been bracing itself for the anticipated fallout from Ronan Farrow\u2019s forthcoming book about his reporting of the Harvey Weinstein scandal, Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators. The details surrounding the sexual assault allegation that led to Lauer\u2019s 2017 firing sparked the first of many anticipated controversies for the network yesterday, when Variety reported on Nevils\u2019 interview with Farrow ahead of the book\u2019s October 15 release.\n\nIn the book, Nevils goes into graphic detail about her encounter with Lauer in Sochi, publicly revealing previously undisclosed details about the assault for the first time.\n\nLauer denied the allegations in a statement released yesterday, which has subsequently been slammed by Nevils and her supporters as a textbook example of victim-blaming.\n\nSubscribe here for our free daily newsletter.\n\nRead the full story at Page Six", "description": "NBC News chief Noah Oppenheim is reportedly taking heat following yesterday's revelatory new details surrounding the accusations against Matt Lauer.", "authors": ["Kayla Kibbe"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Oppenheim.jpg?fit=1200%2C766", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
