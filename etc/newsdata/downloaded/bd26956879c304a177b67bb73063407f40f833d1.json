Martin Truex Jr. passed Hamlin with 12 laps to go to win stage 2.\n\n\u201cI thought (Logano) was trying to stay on the lead lap, but they said he was 24 laps down and so he was kind of air blocking us there and we lost the lead and lost stage 2,\u201d Hamlin said after leading a race-high 218 laps and finishing fifth. \u201cThen after that we lost control of the race and the track tightened and there were no cautions to pick up the rubber. Once we lost control, lost clean air, it was so difficult to pass. I needed to be up front with as tight as my car was. Lost the lead and backpedaled from there.\u201d\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nLogano was in that situation after a mechanical failure sent him to the garage before the field took the green flag to begin the 400-lap race. Logano returned to the track 23 laps down and in last place (38th).\n\nLogano defended how he raced Sunday after placing 34th and collecting three points. He is outside the final transfer spot via a tiebreaker with William Byron. Two races remain in the second round.\n\nMORE: Points standings after Dover race\n\n\u201cI got to race,\u201d Logano said. \u201cHere\u2019s the situation. There were four or five cars that I could possibly catch. That\u2019s five points. I need all of them.\n\n\u201cWhen you think of that, I\u2019ve got to try to stay on the lap that I\u2019m on. I\u2019ve got to try to get every car that I possibly can. I\u2019m still racing. I ran as hard as I could this whole race. Don\u2019t have anything to show for it. We ran it as if we were on the lead lap and did everything we possibly could to be better.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nHamlin didn\u2019t see the need for Logano to race him so hard toward the end of stage 2.\n\n\u201cMake a position? He\u2019s 24 laps down,\u201d Hamlin said. \u201cThat\u2019s the most idiotic statement I\u2019ve ever heard. We\u2019re battling for the end of the stage, it\u2019s not your day, you had bad luck, we get it but what, why? I don\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t understand that at all. That\u2019s just a stupid statement by an idiot.\u201d\n\nSo what would Hamlin have done if he was in that situation?\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to get out of the way,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get out of the way when it\u2019s not your day, when you\u2019re 20-some laps down, you are not going to make those positions up. It ain\u2019t going to make one position difference at any point of the race and it didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cIt is proven, most of these guys would get out of the way and let those leaders race for the end of the stage at that time. \u2026 I probably shouldn\u2019t call Joey an idiot. He\u2019s not an idiot. That\u2019s just a bad choice to say that he\u2019s fighting for something. He\u2019s not fighting for anything. He needs to just run around the race track, stay in one lane, maybe the high lane, because nobody is running up there, get the laps over with, get the race over with, go home and work on it at Talladega to try to win that race.\u201d\n\nHamlin said he \u201cgets it, everybody races hard. If you\u2019re one lap down I even get, even two, but not 24.\n\n\u201cThat frustrates me because it\u2019s just a lack of philosophy that I just don\u2019t understand. All he did was piss some people off and what did he really gain? He didn\u2019t gain anything. He just pissed off some guys that he\u2019s racing with now. So now we\u2019re going to race him extra hard for what? For the reason he didn\u2019t want to go 26 laps down? Anybody would tell you that\u2019s just not a good choice.\n\n\u201cThrough these playoffs you\u2019ve got to not have enemies. You\u2019ve got to have give-and-take.\u201d", "description": "Denny Hamlin didn't like how Joey Logano raced him late in stage 2 as Hamlin tried to retain the lead and Logano was more than 20 laps down.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/iwUowWdTFZKiQhqO8WWN3A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MTguMjM2NDcyOTQ1ODkxOA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MbY20IgqAUEo5c70FWqBBA--~B/aD01NjA7dz05OTg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/8de4c103603eed936768ebcb6789c59c", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
