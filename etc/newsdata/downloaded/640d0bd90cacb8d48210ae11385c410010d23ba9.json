REUTERS/David Mercado\n\nLA PAZ (Reuters) - A final vote tally by Bolivia\u2019s electoral board gave President Evo Morales an outright win in the first-round election on Thursday, with 47.07% of ballots compared to 36.51% for runner-up Carlos Mesa, data on the board\u2019s website showed.\n\nMorales\u2019 10.56 point lead with 99.99% of votes counted means he does not have to face Mesa, a former president, in a riskier second round run-off, after a disputed race in which the opposition has alleged fraud and Morales has accused rivals of staging a \u201ccoup.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for Bolivia\u2019s electoral board said 0.01% votes have been voided in the region of Beni with new voting there scheduled for November.
