Owning a strong business and reinvesting the dividends is widely seen as an attractive way of growing your wealth. On the other hand, investors have been known to buy a stock because of its yield, and then lose money if the company's dividend doesn't live up to expectations.\n\nWith a goodly-sized dividend yield despite a relatively short payment history, investors might be wondering if Lakshmi Finance & Industrial is a new dividend aristocrat in the making. It sure looks interesting on these metrics - but there's always more to the story . Before you buy any stock for its dividend however, you should always remember Warren Buffett's two rules: 1) Don't lose money, and 2) Remember rule #1. We'll run through some checks below to help with this.\n\nExplore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Lakshmi Finance & Industrial!\n\nNSEI:LFIC Historical Dividend Yield, September 4th 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nCompanies (usually) pay dividends out of their earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, the dividend might have to be cut. Comparing dividend payments to a company's net profit after tax is a simple way of reality-checking whether a dividend is sustainable. Lakshmi Finance & Industrial paid out 47% of its profit as dividends, over the trailing twelve month period. This is a middling range that strikes a nice balance between paying dividends to shareholders, and retaining enough earnings to invest in future growth. Besides, if reinvestment opportunities dry up, the company has room to increase the dividend.\n\nConsider getting our latest analysis on Lakshmi Finance & Industrial's financial position here.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nBefore buying a stock for its income, we want to see if the dividends have been stable in the past, and if the company has a track record of maintaining its dividend. Looking at the data, we can see that Lakshmi Finance & Industrial has been paying a dividend for the past seven years. Although it has been paying a dividend for several years now, the dividend has been cut at least once by more than 20%, and we're cautious about the consistency of its dividend across a full economic cycle. Its most recent annual dividend was \u20b92.50 per share, effectively flat on its first payment seven years ago.\n\nWe're glad to see the dividend has risen, but with a limited rate of growth and fluctuations in the payments, we don't think this is an attractive combination.\n\nDividend Growth Potential\n\nGiven that the dividend has been cut in the past, we need to check if earnings are growing and if that might lead to stronger dividends in the future. Earnings have grown at around 3.3% a year for the past five years, which is better than seeing them shrink! Lakshmi Finance & Industrial is paying out less than half of its earnings, which we like. Earnings per share growth have grown slowly, which is not great, but if the retained earnings can be reinvested effectively, future growth may be stronger.\n\nConclusion\n\nDividend investors should always want to know if a) a company's dividends are affordable, b) if there is a track record of consistent payments, and c) if the dividend is capable of growing. Firstly, we like that Lakshmi Finance & Industrial has a low and conservative payout ratio. Unfortunately, the company has not been able to generate earnings per share growth, and cut its dividend at least once in the past. Lakshmi Finance & Industrial might not be a bad business, but it doesn't show all of the characteristics we look for in a dividend stock.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Today we'll take a closer look at Lakshmi Finance & Industrial Corporation Limited (NSE:LFIC) from a dividend...", "authors": ["Simply Wall St"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/auiiafrFXW1hZaiN1TyA5w--~B/aD00MzI7dz0xMTk0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/simply_wall_st__316/67c1329d6a7cef824959080356a63b1b"}
