Karl\u2019s paper had more literary-critical pieces than Mary-Kay\u2019s. You can see the paper becoming more political and historical under her \u2014 differences of emphasis and degree rather than kind.\u201d\n\nWithout question, the political profile of the L.R.B. has risen during Wilmers\u2019s tenure, with a routine focus on foreign affairs, ideological debate and national crises. \u201cMary-Kay gets up in the morning,\u201d says Andrew O\u2019Hagan, also a three-decade contributor to the L.R.B., \u201cand wonders if there isn\u2019t someone somewhere who might write a first-rate piece on the relationship between Isis and the Taliban, or the queen\u2019s position in the Brexit debate, or the zeal to abolish guns in New Zealand, or the pathos of Michelle Obama.\u201d\n\nWilmers\u2019s writers vary widely in their backgrounds and their politics \u2014 itself an unusual quality in the world of magazines, where left or right tends to define most publications. That mix has seen the L.R.B. generate discussion well beyond its expected borders and out of proportion to its relatively modest circulation. Stewart \u2014 who is historically conservative and pro-Brexit \u2014 wrote in 2009 about the American counterinsurgency-warfare strategy in Afghanistan that, he says, has been on syllabuses of military colleges in Britain. A 2011 review by Pankaj Mishra of \u201cCivilization,\u201d a book about the global dominance of Western societies written by a professor at Harvard, Niall Ferguson, became international news when Ferguson threatened libel (he accused Mishra of suggesting that he was a racist who whitewashed imperialism); Thomas Chatterton Williams wrote an ambivalent assessment of \u201cBetween the World and Me,\u201d by the cultural critic Ta-Nehesi Coates, in 2015. (\u201cI was swept away by the incantatory momentum of the prose,\u201d Williams wrote, \u201cbut I was troubled by what was left out in the rush to take umbrage.\u201d) That same year, when Seymour Hersh disputed the White House account of the Navy Seals raid that killed Osama bin Laden, insisting that Pakistan must have been involved, the article was so widely read that it crashed the L.R.B. site the day it went online. And when Hersh argued in its pages that chemical attacks on Syrian civilians hadn\u2019t been carried out by Assad, and Hersh was accused of peddling a single-sourced conspiracy theory that played into Assad\u2019s hands, the L.R.B. stood firm.\n\n[What do we really know about Osama Bin Laden\u2019s death?]\n\n\u201cSeymour Hersh, and the paper, have been criticized on the basis, really, that we have contradicted the generally agreed accounts of events in Syria, which largely follow the version of events put out by the U.S. government,\u201d Daniel Soar, one of the paper\u2019s senior editors, told me. \u201cHersh based his reporting on information from multiple senior U.S. intelligence sources who strongly disagreed with the official accounts. Letting such people be heard is a bit like letting whistle-blowers be heard: If people on the inside have information that suggests the government is lying, then we need to know about it.\u201d\n\nThe uproars that have originated from pieces in the L.R.B. are common enough in the life of a magazine or newspaper, but what is unusual is the paper\u2019s structural daring and its tone. Few publications would think to publish a 60,000-word reported article on the Grenfell fire \u2014 the 2017 blaze in a London housing tower that killed 72 \u2014 much less a 26,000-word memoir of trying to ghostwrite for Julian Assange, both articles by Andrew O\u2019Hagan, each written in the first-person. Although a reporter\u2019s first-person presence, popularized by the New Journalism of the 1960s, is now routine, the \u201cI\u201d in the L.R.B., regardless of topic or type of piece, has a particular intellectual crackle. Ben Lerner can write of his struggle reading Karl Ove Knausgaard no less than Amia Srinivasan can write of hers in weighing the intelligence of the octopus. Consider a recent review by the American poet Patricia Lockwood, occasioned by a new edition of John Updike\u2019s novels:\n\nI was hired as an assassin. You don\u2019t bring in a 37-year-old woman to review John Updike in the year of our Lord 2019 unless you\u2019re hoping to see blood on the ceiling. \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d I said when first approached, because I knew I would try to read everything, and fail, and spend days trying to write an adequate description of his nostrils, and all I would be left with after months of standing tiptoe on the balance beam of objectivity and fair assessment would be a letter to the editor from some guy named Norbert accusing me of cutting off a great man\u2019s dong in print. But then the editors cornered me drunk at a party, and here we are.\n\nIf you weren\u2019t inclined, after that paragraph, to read the next 6,965 words of Lockwood\u2019s article \u2014 you would call it a takedown were its thinking not so fine and its comedy not so purposeful \u2014 nothing will get you to read literary criticism. And, as Lockwood\u2019s \u201cNorbert\u201d suggests, a letter to the paper is surely forthcoming.", "description": "As newspapers and magazines flounder, The London Review of Books has flourished by championing intellectual debate.", "authors": ["Wyatt Mason"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/27/magazine/27mag-Wilmers-image-01/27mag-Wilmers-image-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
