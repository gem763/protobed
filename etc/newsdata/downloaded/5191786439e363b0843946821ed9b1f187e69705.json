Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 1, 2019\n\nUnlike Trump, his fellow Republicans aren\u2019t celebrating and instead slammed the Chinese government\u2019s abuses of power.\n\nIn a joint statement, Reps. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin and Liz Cheney of Wyoming said it was \u201can opportunity to remember the victims, past and present, of the Chinese Communist Party.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday the CCP continues to wage a campaign of aggression at home and abroad,\u201d they said, describing the country as \u201ca nightmarish totalitarian dystopia.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is for [Chinese citizens\u2019] future, as well as that of their fellow victims in Xinjiang, in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and beyond, that we rededicate ourselves to ensuring that the Chinese Communist Party is left on the ash heap of history,\u201d they continued.\n\nToday marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China. This is not a day for celebration. Rather, as @Liz_Cheney and I argue, it is an opportunity to remember the victims, past and present, of the Chinese Communist Party. pic.twitter.com/Z5EW94wIt0 \u2014 Rep. Mike Gallagher (@RepGallagher) October 1, 2019\n\nSen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Reps. Richard Hudson of North Carolina and Chip Roy of Texas were among others within the GOP who spoke out, calling the anniversary \u201clamentable\u201d and condemning the shooting of the protester.\n\nAccording to The Associated Press, the teen is in critical condition. Hong Kong Police Commissioner Stephen Lo has defended the use of force as \u201creasonable and lawful,\u201d claiming the officer responsible was acting in fear of his life, the outlet reported.\n\nHudson said he was \u201calarmed\u201d by the action, demanding the government \u201cshow restraint.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe People\u2019s Republic of China is a repressive regime with a terrible human rights record, and I stand with its citizens in their quest for democracy and self-determination,\u201d he continued.\n\nWe are all born with a God-given thirst for liberty and freedom.\n\n\n\nAs President Ronald Reagan once said, \u201cfreedom and democracy will leave Marxism and Leninism on the ash heap of history.\u201d \u2014 Richard Hudson (@RepRichHudson) October 1, 2019\n\nThe Butchers of Beijing celebrate 70 years of communist tyranny by shooting a student marching for freedom in Hong Kong. What a sadly appropriate way to mark a dark, lamentable anniversary. https://t.co/UbC3qQDKTV \u2014 Tom Cotton (@TomCottonAR) October 1, 2019\n\nMeanwhile, Fox News analyst Brit Hume and other conservative media figures delivered scathing and direct rebukes of Trump\u2019s tweet, dismissing any notion that the anniversary was worth fanfare.\n\n\u201cThis is gross,\u201d Hume wrote. \u201cCelebrating a brutal dictatorship on its survival.\u201d\n\nThis is gross.
