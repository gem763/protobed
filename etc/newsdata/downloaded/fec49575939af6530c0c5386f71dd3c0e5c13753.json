Police said that the celebrity, born Choi Jin-ri, was discovered unconscious at her Seongnam residence on 14 October.\n\n\u201cHer manager visited her home after failing to reach her since their last call the night before,\u201d Seongnam police said, adding that Sulli had been experiencing severe depression. \u201cIt seems that she took her own life but we are also looking into other possibilities.\u201d\n\nSulli was a member of the popular K-pop girl group f(x), launched by SM Entertainment in 2009, which achieved domestic and some international success. Sulli went on hiatus from the group in July 2014, reportedly suffering from \u201cstress-related pain\u201d, related to the circulation of rumours about her personal life.\n\nShe finally left the group in August 2015 to focus on her acting career, taking a role in the 2017 superhero movie Real. She also released her debut solo single, Goblin, this summer.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sulli: Goblin \u2013 video\n\nSulli was a relatively controversial figure in the conservative Korean entertainment industry. At times she did not wear a bra, a stance that won her approval and opprobrium. \u201cGoing braless is one\u2019s freedom,\u201d she said on Korean network JTBC\u2019s Night of Hate Comments show on 21 July.\n\n\u201cWhen I upload my photos without a bra, people talk about it a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cI could have been scared. But I [wasn\u2019t] because I thought it would be nice if more people could discard their prejudices.\u201d\n\nShe was also visible with her romantic relationships \u2013 a rarity \u2013 and received homophobic remarks for pecking her best friend, K-pop star and actor Goo Ha-ra, on the lips at her birthday party. In April this year, she accused fans of \u201cgaze-rape\u201d \u2013 which the Korea Times defined as \u201ca newly coined term referring to excessive gazing that makes people feel violated\u201d \u2013 during an Instagram live stream that showed her drinking with friends.\n\nK-pop group BTS criticised for Saudi Arabia concert Read more\n\nHer candour on mental-health issues was another anomaly in the Korean entertainment world. In 2018, she revealed on reality TV show Jinri Store that she had suffered panic disorders from a young age. \u201cEven close people left me,\u201d she said. \u201cI was hurt by them and felt there was nobody who understands me, which made me fall apart.\u201d\n\nHer recent Instagram videos had shown her crying and saying, \u201cI\u2019m not a bad person.\u201d In the wake of her death, a number of K-pop fan accounts have decried the toxic fan culture and online bullying that Sulli was subjected to.\n\n\u2022 In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.
