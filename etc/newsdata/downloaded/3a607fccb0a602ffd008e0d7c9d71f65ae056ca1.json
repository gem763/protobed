We had planned to be with the rest of our family in Barbados for half term break. Unfortunately I became poorly with an infection before we were due to leave.\n\n\u2018I am not able to join them for the time being, even though I am feeling better.\u2019\n\nColeen\u2019s mum Colette joined in on the fun (Picture: Charlie Pitt/246paps/MEGA\n\nColeen was forced to stay home with Cass (Picture: Shaun Botterill/Getty Images)\n\nLovely morning in the fresh air with Cass.

I liked you a lot Coleen and I\u2019m so upset that you have chosen to do this, especially when I\u2019m heavily pregnant.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m disgusted that I\u2019m even having to deny this. You should have called me the first time this happened.\u2019\n\nIt is believed Rebekah is having a forensic investigation carried out on her Instagram to prove she wasn\u2019t behind the leaks.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
