This spring, the Texas Legislature outlawed polling places that did not stay open for the entire 12-day early-voting period. When the state\u2019s elections take place in three weeks, those nine sites \u2014 which logged many of the nearly 14,000 ballots that full-time students cast last year \u2014 will be shuttered. So will six campus polling places at colleges in Fort Worth, two in Brownsville, on the Mexico border, and other polling places at schools statewide.\n\n\u201cIt was a beautiful thing, a lot of people out there in those long lines,\u201d said Grant Loveless, a 20-year-old majoring in psychology and political science who voted last November at a campus in central Austin. \u201cIt would hurt a lot of students if you take those polling places away.\u201d\n\nThe story at Austin Community College is but one example of a political drama playing out nationwide: After decades of treating elections as an afterthought, college students have begun voting in force.", "description": "The share of college students casting ballots doubled from 2014 to 2018, a potential boon to Democrats.
