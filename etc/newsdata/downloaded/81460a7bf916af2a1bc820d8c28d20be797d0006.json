The next scheduled election in is 2022, and to conduct an earlier vote, the motion must gain a two-thirds majority in the House of Commons. Labour has already twice rejected similar proposals last month.\n\nConservative Party chairman James Cleverly suggested that an election could be held as early as December, and criticised Labour for avoiding the vote. \u201cWe\u2019ve been calling for a general election for months now, and the Labour Party are running scared,\u201d Mr Cleverly said on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme.\n\nThe official Labour position remains that Jeremy Corbyn will only back an election after a Brexit delay is secured. The Guardian reports he is facing increasing pressure from his party to reject the prime minister\u2019s bid. Party figures want to prioritise holding a second referendum \u2014 in hopes of cancelling Brexit \u2014 instead.\n\nOne source told The Guardian that up to half of Labour MPs could rebel and defy the whip to vote against an election. Another told the newspaper: \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say there\u2019s not a great appetite for an election in December.\u201d\n\nBritons Support an Early General Election by Two-to-One https://t.co/86i4dxEUOB \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 24, 2019\n\nMr Johnson is also facing a split in his Cabinet over whether to push for an early election or pass a deal, according to The Times.\n\nGovernment ministers Nicky Morgan, Julian Smith, and Matt Hancock are reportedly backing passing a deal through parliament and then holding a snap election, while Jacob Rees-Mogg, Sajid Javid, and Priti Patel calling for an immediate election.\n\n\u201cWe should be taking the fight to the opposition and going for an election. Theresa May made a big error trying to negotiate with people whose only interest is stopping us delivering on our promises,\u201d one Cabinet minister said.\n\nThe speculation comes after Prime Minister Johnson\u2019s Brexit withdrawal bill passed its first hurdle in the House of Commons. Still, MPs voted down his timetable that would have ensured the UK left the EU as scheduled on October 31st.\n\nA YouGov poll published on Wednesday revealed that Britons back a fresh election to shake up the deadlocked parliament two-to-one.", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson could make a third attempt to call a snap election, according to reports.", "authors": ["Victoria Friedman"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/Boris-Johnson-21-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
