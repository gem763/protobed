John Kennedy (R-La.), demanding he stop \u201cgaslighting\u201d the American public by ginning up suspicion of former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s past.\n\n\u201cYou do realize you\u2019re looking for an outcome, not the facts,\u201d Todd told Kennedy in a Tuesday interview, referring to evidence-free theories that Biden and his son may have been linked to corruption in Ukraine.\n\nAs Todd pointed out, the rumor, which has been driven by Trump, personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and other presidential allies, remains unfounded by journalists and the Ukrainian government. Yet Kennedy was adamant in his demands that the matter be investigated.\n\n\u201cMaybe you\u2019re right, maybe there\u2019s magical missing information here,\u201d Todd added. \u201cBut at some point, do you not accept all of these entities looking into it to have found the answer?\u201d\n\nThroughout the lengthy exchange, the senator made the argument that because the question had been raised by Trump\u2019s supporters, it merits attention. Meanwhile he overlooked a whistleblower report allegedly flagging Trump\u2019s July discussion with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during which he is said to have requested help with a probe of the Bidens. Trump purportedly believed the move would help him secure the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not alleging the vice president did anything wrong,\u201d Kennedy said. However, he remained firm in his calls for an investigation anyway.\n\n\u201cI am trying to be fair here, but you can\u2019t gaslight us, sir,\u201d an evidently exasperated Todd said. \u201cDon\u2019t gaslight us.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not gaslighting you,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cI\u2019m telling you the facts. Do you deny those facts? Do you think they got Hunter Biden\u2019s name off ZipRecruiter? I don\u2019t. And I don\u2019t think the American people do either.\u201d\n\nKennedy was referring to Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian energy firm with which Hunter Biden worked as a board member during his father\u2019s vice presidency. At that time, Joe Biden was advocating \u2015 along with the international community \u2015 to oust the country\u2019s then-prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, who was leading a corruption probe of Burisma.\n\nIn May, one of Shokin\u2019s successors, Yuriy Lutsenko \u2015 who has now left the post \u2015 told Bloomberg News, \u201cHunter Biden did not violate any Ukrainian laws \u2015 at least as of now, we do not see any wrongdoing.\u201d\n\nAs of Tuesday, nearly 200 House Democrats endorsed impeachment proceedings against Trump, being joined by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who announced an inquiry on the basis that the president had committed \u201ca violation of the law\u201d in his conversation with Zelensky.\n\nTrump has continually denied that his discussion was inappropriate, though on Sunday, he appeared to confirm that the Bidens came up in his talk, telling reporters the call concerned, in part, \u201cthe fact that we don\u2019t want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine.\u201d\n\nTrump is expected to release a transcript of the call, though the whistleblower complaint \u2015 which was given to Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire \u2015 remains hidden from Congress as lawmakers call for him to turn it over.", "description": "The MSNBC anchor slammed Sen.
