The bridesmaid told police her friend immediately started screaming at Mr Carney.\n\nThe bride followed him into the parking lot and the two got into a physical fight, according to court records.\n\nAnother bridesmaid helped the woman walk out of the showers, the Morning Call reported.\n\nThe next morning, Mr Carney called the bridesmaid to apologise, but claimed he didn\u2019t know what they had done the night before, according to the police report.\n\nOn the morning of the wedding, he texted again to ask the woman to put on a good face for the wedding and to pressure her to take the morning after pill to prevent an accidental pregnancy.\n\n\u201cI wanted to apologise again for everything,\u201d he wrote in a lengthy message, according to the probable cause affidavit.\n\n\u201cCan we please just be as happy as possible for [the bride] today? Mistakes are behind us and I just need total closure before I do this [that is] why I\u2019m sending this.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m as happy as ever to marry [the bride] and I know this is terrible as well but my d*** was out in the shower.\n\n\u201cWe never did do it but would you consider taking plan b to make damn certain just in case? There is almost no chance but still. Please tell me yes I\u2019m begging you.\u201d\n\nDespite the shocking incident, WNEP reported, the couple still got married on 1 September.\n\nBut the next morning, the bridesmaid went to the hospital to report that she\u2019d been sexually assaulted. She told police she felt \u201cextremely violated and upset\u201d.\n\nMr Carney, meanwhile, allegedly told his guests the woman had \u201cfollowed him\u201d into the locker room after he told her he was going to shower. He later told a state trooper he was extremely drunk and felt she had \u201ctaken advantage\u201d of him.\n\nBut police say a clearer picture of the night began to emerge after they pulled security footage from the hotel.\n\n\u201cThe footage showed the victim and the accused walking down the hallway, with the victim extremely unsteady on her feet and swaying,\u201d state trooper Justin Leri wrote in a police report.\n\n\u201cJust before the doorway, the accused is observed turning around and pulling the victim into the locker room.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s where the reach of the hotel\u2019s security cameras stop, according to a probable cause affidavit reported by WNEP.\n\nAfter police reviewed the video, Mr Carney changed his story, admitting he\u2019d grabbed the woman by the arms and pulled her into the locker room.\n\nPolice then intercepted a second call between Mr Carney and the bridesmaid, during which he claimed they did not have \u201cactual sex\u201d, but \u201crepeatedly told her he was sorry, specifically repeating that it was all his fault\u201d.\n\nHe also admitted to leading the woman into the locker room during the phone call, the Morning Call reported.\n\nProsecutors charged Mr Carney with simple assault, indecent assault and involuntary deviate sexual intercourse of an unconscious person.\n\nAn arraignment has not yet been scheduled for Mr Carney, and his case is awaiting a preliminary hearing. His lawyer did not immediately return a request for comment late on Sunday night.\n\nWashington Post", "description": "Two days before his wedding, the groom spent the afternoon floating down the Delaware River in eastern Pennsylvania with his wedding party.
