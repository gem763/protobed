Musk called Unsworth \u201ca pedo guy\u201d after Unsworth criticized him.\n\nMusk stated in a recent court filing: \u201cI did not intend to convey any facts or imply that Mr. Unsworth had engaged in acts of pedophilia. Pedo guy was a common insult used in South Africa when I was growing up. It is synonymous with \u2018creepy old man\u2019 and is used to insult a person\u2019s appearance and demeanor, not accuse a person of pedophilia.\u201d\n\nIn July of 2018, Unsworth called Musk\u2019s plan a \u201cPR stunt\u201d and stated his belief that the miniature submarine would have failed completely to make it through the tight, narrow bends in the underwater cave. \u201cHe can stick his submarine where it hurts,\u201d Unsworth said in an interview. \u201cIt had absolutely no chance of working. He had no conception of what the cave passage was like. The submarine, I believe, was about five foot six long, rigid, so it wouldn\u2019t have gone round corners or round any obstacles. It wouldn\u2019t have made the first 50 metres into the cave from the dive start point. Just a PR stunt.\u201d\n\nMusk claimed that his submarine could easily have navigated the cave, telling Unsworth in a now-deleted tweet: \u201cYou know what, don\u2019t bother showing the video. We will make one of the mini-sub/pod going all the way to Cave 5 no problemo. Sorry pedo guy, you really did ask for it.\u201d\n\nNow a recent report from BuzzFeed News reveals that the private investigator that Musk paid more than $50,000 to dig up dirt on Unsworth is a convicted felon. BuzzFeed News writes:\n\nPublic records and interviews reveal that the man Musk contracted, James Howard-Higgins, stole money from his business partners and was sentenced to three years in prison for fraud. Past associates of the man described the Englishman to BuzzFeed News as a \u201cWalter Mitty character\u201d who repeatedly defrauded a company he cofounded despite disciplinary actions that were meant to keep him in check. Recently released court documents from a defamation case in US federal court show that Musk retained Howard-Higgins after the self-proclaimed investigator cold-emailed him offering to \u201cdig deep\u201d into Vernon Unsworth, a British expat who played a key role in the rescue of a boys soccer team from a Thailand cave system in July 2018. Unsworth, who had criticized Musk\u2019s efforts to involve himself in the cave rescue, is now suing the billionaire for publicly calling him a pedophile and \u201cchild rapist,\u201d an allegation partly based on unsubstantiated information given to him by Howard-Higgins. Musk\u2019s failure to effectively vet a private investigator he hired and his willingness to repeat serious and unfounded allegations against Unsworth are the latest in a series of public blunders for Tesla\u2019s CEO, whose win-at-all-costs mentality has drawn him into a number of high-profile fights with regulators,former employees, and shareholders. And it has renewed the concerns of institutional investors, some of whom have sued to keep Musk from engaging in reputationally damaging arguments on Twitter.\n\nProfessor William Klepper of Columbia Business School stated that company executives should have \u201cthicker skin\u201d than Musk and that his actions put his companies at risk by acting like a \u201cloose cannon.\u201d Klepper stated: \u201cIf I\u2019m sitting on that board, I\u2019d say, \u2018Wow, does he take similar impulsive moves when he\u2019s working on our company\u2019s strategy?\u201d\n\nFor a brief time following his work with musk, Howard-Higgins appeared to live a comfortable life but BuzzFeed News reports that no longer appears to be the case:\n\nRead the full report by BuzzFeed News here.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
