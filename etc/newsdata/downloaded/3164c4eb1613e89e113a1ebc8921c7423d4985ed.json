On Monday, G/O Media Editorial Director Paul Maidment issued a mandate to Deadspin employees, obtained by The Daily Beast, that they could no longer publish any content not directly related to sports.\n\n\u201cTo create as much great sports journalism as we can requires a 100% focus of our resources on sports. And it will be the sole focus,\u201d Maidment said in the memo. \u201cDeadspin will write only about sports and that which is relevant to sports in some way.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWhere such subjects touch on sports, they are fair game for Deadspin. Where they do not, they are not. We have plenty of other sites that write about politics, pop culture, the arts, and the rest, and they\u2019re the appropriate place for such work.\u201d\n\nG/O was formed earlier this year when Great Hill Partners, a private equity firm, purchased the Gizmodo Media Group from Univision and rebranded it. Univision had formed Gizmodo Media Group after acquiring Gawker Media, which filed for bankruptcy proceedings in the wake of a lawsuit secretly funded by billionaire Peter Thiel.\n\nThe new company oversees Deadspin, Gizmodo, Jezebel, Lifehacker, and a number of former Gawker Media sites.\n\nDeadspin staffers protested Maidment\u2019s mandate on Tuesday by filling its front page with a host of old and new stories not related to sports. Among them was an August editorial by former Deadspin Editor-in-Chief Megan Greenwell, who said staff members have clashed with the new management\u2019s \u201c\u2018stick to sports\u2019 edict\u201d from the start.\n\n\u201cThe numbers apparently do not matter to my ostensibly numbers-obsessed bosses, for reasons I can\u2019t quite understand,\u201d Greenwell wrote. \u201cWhen I have told them that the data show that non-sports content brings more traffic and more revenue opportunities, I have been ignored.\u201d\n\nThese clashes have cost the company several of its top employees, including Greenwell, whose last day at Deadspin was the same day her editorial ran.\n\n\u201cThey have driven out several senior managers\u2014most of them women, myself included\u2014by undermining us and condescending to us at every turn,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAmong the people Great Hill Partners has fired and driven out of the company and treated like children are people who have been responsible for creating and sustaining a successful digital media business for over a decade.\u201d\n\nBarry Petchesky, who has been at Deadspin for over a decade and who took over as interim editor-in-chief after Greenwell left, said Tuesday he was fired from the company \u201cfor not sticking to sports.\u201d\n\nHi! I\u2019ve just been fired from Deadspin for not sticking to sports. \u2014 Barry Petchesky (@barry) October 29, 2019\n\nG/O Media has fired Deadspin's longest-serving full-time employee, who wrote nearly 20,000 posts for the site over ten years. https://t.co/D6aLDc2xeq \u2014 Timothy Burke (@bubbaprog) October 29, 2019\n\nThe site\u2019s union, organized under the Writer\u2019s Guild of America, East, tweeted in response to Petchesky\u2019s termination on Tuesday that \u201cthis will not stand.\u201d (WGA East also represents the HuffPost Union.)\n\nEarlier today, @JimSpanfeller, CEO of G/O Media, fired our colleague and longtime Deadspin Deputy Editor Barry Petchesky. This will not stand. We will have updates soon. \u2014 GMG Union (@gmgunion) October 29, 2019\n\nMaidment responded to the backlash over the \u201cstick to sports\u201d mandate by saying he was \u201csorry\u201d some staffers \u201cdon\u2019t agree with that editorial direction.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe that Deadspin reporters and editors should go after every conceivable story as long as it has something to do with sports,\u201d he said in a statement, according to CNN Media reporter Kerry Flynn. \u201cWe are sorry that some on the Deadspin staff don\u2019t agree with that editorial direction and refuse to work within that incredibly broad mandate.\u201d\n\nStatement from G/O Media editorial director Paul Maidment on the backlash from Deadspin staffers, which led to the firing of deputy editor Barry Petchesky pic.twitter.com/qVywhOFTKK \u2014 Kerry Flynn \ud83d\udc36 (@kerrymflynn) October 29, 2019\n\nSome G/O employees have also recently spoken out about a massive new advertising deal that has filled Deadspin and its sister sites with auto-play videos. Deadspin published an article on Monday that said staff members were \u201cupset with the current state of our site\u2019s user experience\u201d and noted that they don\u2019t \u201ccontrol the ad experience on the site.\u201d\n\nThe post was taken down later on Monday. Petchesky tweeted that management had deleted the article \u201cin clear violation\u201d of the union\u2019s collective bargaining agreement.\n\nManagement has unilaterally deleted these posts from every site in the network, in a clear violation of our CBA. https://t.co/uMAekdbjRE \u2014 Barry Petchesky (@barry) October 28, 2019\n\nG/O did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "description": "A top employee at the company was promptly fired for not following the mandate from G/O Media.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db88d8b210000bf3634b62e.png?cache=qarglwouqt&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
