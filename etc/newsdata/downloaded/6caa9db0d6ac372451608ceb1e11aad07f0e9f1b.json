London's futures were mostly flat as were U.S. stock futures.\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan advanced 0.3% with Japan's finishing up 0.55% after hitting a one-year high. Australian shares climbed 0.3%.\n\nRisk appetite was also aided after U.S. President Donald Trump lifted sanctions on Turkey saying a ceasefire in northern Syria was now permanent.\n\n\"U.S.-China trade friction seems to be entering a truce, a no-deal Brexit looks increasingly likely to be avoided, and the U.S.'s posture against Turkey appears to have been softening,\" JPMorgan (NYSE: ) analyst Tohru Sasaki wrote in a note pointing to reasons for a rally in Nikkei.\n\nJPMorgan expects gains in the Japanese index to extend into year-end led by share buy-backs.\n\nA private survey showed Japanese factory activity shrank at the fastest pace in over three years in October, hurt by slowing global demand and trade frictions.\n\nChinese shares did open higher but soon erased those gains with the blue-chip index easing 0.3%.\n\nOn Wall Street overnight, the and the Nasdaq added 0.2% each while the gained 0.3%.\n\nTesla (NASDAQ: ) shares jumped 21% in after-hours trading following a surprise third quarter profit.\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: ) also posted forecast-beating profit and revenue numbers after the closing bell though the outlook was darkened by slower-than-expected take-up of its Azure cloud services.\n\nEarlier, shares of U.S. industrial bellwethers Boeing (NYSE: ) Co and Caterpillar Inc (NYSE: ) ended about 1% higher each despite big earnings misses.\n\nRBC Capital Markets' chief economist Tom Porcelli pointed to consistently alarming headlines since the first quarter of 2018 suggesting poor Caterpillar earnings meant a recession was round the corner, though that has yet to transpire.\n\n\"We have been down this road before with CAT,\" Porcelli said in a note titled 'Still Waiting For Recession.'\n\n\"If you keep saying a recession is here, it is a mathematical certainty that at some point you will be right,\" he wrote. \"Maybe try again after CAT's next quarterly earnings report.\"\n\nSo far, results from about 125 of the S&P500 companies are out with analysts expecting earnings to have declined 2.9% year-over-year, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nBREXIT BATTLE\n\nCurrency markets stuck to tight ranges ahead of key central bank meetings this week and next with the euro zone, Japan and United States due to review policy.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said if the deadline is deferred to the end of January, he would call an election.\n\n\"The Brexit battle looks like it will drag on,\" economists at ANZ wrote in a note.\n\n\"The UK government will not meet its current timetable of leaving the EU on 31 October, and an extension appears likely. In the meantime, Brexit uncertainty will keep weighing on UK business investment and activity.\"\n\nThe single currency was flat at $1.1132. The Japanese yen was 0.1% higher at 108.6 per dollar while the Australian dollar was a tad weaker at $0.6842.\n\nThat left the slightly lower at 97.452 against a basket of six major currencies.\n\nIn commodity markets, eased 38 cents to $55.59 while slipped 22 cents to $60.95.\n\nGold was treading water at $1,491.51 an ounce.", "description": "Asian shares inch ahead as earnings, geopolitics sway sentiment", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9N06M_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
