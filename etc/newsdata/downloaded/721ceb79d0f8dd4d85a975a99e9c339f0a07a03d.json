Reflect on the source of your confidence\n\nIt\u2019s hard to instil confidence in others if your own is being sapped by self-doubt. The adage \u201cfake it until you make it\u201d doesn\u2019t hold true here because a lack of confidence shows up in body language, which is the biggest determinant of how people perceive us.\n\nCarol Dweck advocates a \"growth mindset\". Peter Braig\n\nErosion of confidence can come from leaders\u2019 need to prove their knowledge or expertise. It\u2019s what Stanford professor Carol Dweck describes as a \u201cfixed mindset\u201d. Dweck\u2019s \u201cgrowth mindset\u201d approach encourages a fundamental shift away from \u201cI need to prove what I\u2019m capable of\u201d to \u201cI need to improve what I\u2019m capable of\u201d. That means developing the ability to frame any situation, regardless of the stakes, as an opportunity to learn and grow.\n\n2. Think differently\n\nWhen presenting to a large group, leaders with strong executive presence tend to shift their focus from \u201cWhat does my audience think of me?\u201d to \u201cWhat do I want my audience to think and feel?\u201d Feelings of self-consciousness make way for a purposeful intention and attention to how they are communicating.\n\nIf we want our audience to feel inspired, chances are we will focus on being inspiring. A White House speech writer once told me he began his process by mapping the emotional journey he wanted his audience to follow. The words came afterwards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis \u201cemotion-first\u201d approach also builds a sense of authenticity and empathy.\n\n3. Analyse how you show up\n\nStudies have shown that only 7 per cent of the impact in communication comes from what we say. The rest comes from how we say it. This includes eye contact, posture, voice, gestures, movement, facial warmth and attire.\n\nFormer US president Barack Obama used the pause to great effect. Reuters\n\nHolding eye contact with others (in the right measure) can convey confidence, authority, poise, balance, understanding and certainty.\n\nVoice is another mechanism to shape perceptions. One way former US president Barack Obama created a sense of gravitas was his use of pauses. The ability to stand in front of an audience and hold a pause to punctuate a presentation, underscore a point, or simply for effect creates impact because it exudes self-assuredness.\n\n4. Train, practise and prepare\n\nHere\u2019s a paradox: leaders who seem to effortlessly demonstrate executive presence actually plan for situations so they come across as authentic yet spontaneous. They rehearse what they are going to say and how they are going to say it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSMG\u2019s executive presence coach, Peter Kingston, a former head of directing at NIDA, approaches lessons through a lens of performance: \u201cDeveloping executive presence involves the application of skills and techniques which, over time, become habits.\u201d\n\nExecutive presence requires a continuous improvement mindset. That means regularly seeking out unvarnished feedback then knowing what to do with it, or using a trained coach to help address shortcomings and call out natural strengths.\n\nIf you\u2019re rehearsing, the amount of time should be proportional to the importance of the situation. For a board presentation, aim for a minimum of an hour. When time is scarce, rehearse your opening and closing. The opening creates the first impression. The closing is the impression you leave.\n\n5. Engage with energy\n\nWhen we ask people to describe strong executive presence, one word that consistently comes up is \u201cenergy\u201d, which shows up typically as a strong, steady, confident and engaging first impression.\n\nAmy Cuddy says body language and emotions are inextricably linked. Facebook\n\nHarvard professor Amy Cuddy's TED talk on the subject has had more than 53 million views. In her talk, and subsequent book Presence: Bringing Your Boldest Self to Your Biggest Challenges, Cuddy describes how to overcome impostor syndrome, the biggest inhibitor of executive presence.\n\nHer studies suggest that our body language and emotions are connected. For example, holding a \u201cpower pose\u201d for as little as two minutes increases the natural confidence-boosting hormones dopamine and oxytocin. Power poses include standing with arms outstretched and feet firmly anchored to the ground, or the \u201cWonder Woman\u201d pose, with clenched fists resting on the hips.\n\nRemember, power poses need to be performed before the situation \u2013 if done during an event, they can come across as arrogant.\n\nExecutive presence alone won\u2019t guarantee success, but its absence could be career-limiting.\n\nMehul Joshi is a senior partner at leadership development firm Stephenson Mansell Group.", "description": "The ability of some leaders to appear effortlessly confident and command respect can be learnt.
