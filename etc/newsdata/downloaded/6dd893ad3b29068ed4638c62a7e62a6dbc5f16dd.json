See below for this week\u2019s Callout Collection \u2013 and just how realistic each one is.\n\n* * * * *\n\nFirst up, let\u2019s take a look at the night\u2019s prelim winners.\n\nBrendan Allen\n\nWants to fight: Eryk Anders\n\nThe callout: \u201cNothing but respect, but I\u2019d love to fight one of my losses, Eryk Anders. You\u2019re a great dude. I have nothing but respect, but business is business. Let\u2019s go back, end of January, beginning of February in the U.S. I\u2019m ready.\u201d\n\nThe reality: After earning his way into the UFC through a win on Dana White\u2019s Contender Series, Brendan Allen (13-3 MMA, 1-0 UFC) proved incredibly impressive in a gutsy and exciting win over Kevin Holland at UFC on ESPN 6. \u201cAll In\u201d is tenacious in his grappling, and he certainly kept the crowd entertained while facing an equally exciting prospect.\n\nAllen\u2019s pre-UFC career is interesting. His three losses to date all came against fighters that made it to the UFC, including Anders (13-4 MMA, 5-4 UFC), as well as Trevin Giles and Anthony Hernandez. All of these make realistic matchups, though it was Anders who Allen requested when given the moment.\n\nA rematch from the regional scene with real stakes on the line? Why not?
