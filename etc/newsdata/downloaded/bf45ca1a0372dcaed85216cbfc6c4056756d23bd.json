Scott Applewhite/AP Photo\n\nDRIVING THE DAY\n\nCOUNTERPROGRAMMING? \u2026 THE DEMOCRATIC debate is tonight in Houston. You know what\u2019s also tonight? President DONALD TRUMP\u2019S speech to a room full of House Republicans at the party\u2019s retreat in Baltimore. Trump\u2019s speech will be pooled at 7:10 p.m. Eastern.\n\nON THE IMPEACHMENT DUMPSTER FIRE THAT\u2019S SMOLDERING \u2026 OUR HILL TEAM COLLEAGUES Heather Caygle, Andrew Desiderio, Sarah Ferris, Melanie Zanona and Kyle Cheney have been doing terrific work laying out how House Democrats\u2019 impeachment process is a complete mess. They also laid out how Democrats have tried to clean it up in the last 12 or so hours.\n\nIF YOU\u2019VE MISSED IT, here\u2019s the crux of it all: HOUSE DEMOCRATS have been all over the map on what they are trying to do when it comes to impeachment. They can\u2019t decide if they\u2019re impeaching the president, let alone where they are in said process.\n\nTHE STATED THEORY BEHIND THIS NON-IMPEACHMENT-IMPEACHMENT PLAY is that so-called frontline Democratic lawmakers -- those with tough races in Trump districts -- don\u2019t want to have to be a part of an impeachment proceeding.\n\nSO, THIS GOT US THINKING TWO THINGS \u2026\n\n-- HOW DO DEMOCRATS FEEL ABOUT THEIR LEADERSHIP\u2019S STRATEGY? We asked a bunch of smart House Democratic lawmakers and aides, and here was the best answer, via one of those aides: \u201cIf upper leadership took a clear stance on what was going on, people could get on board or publicly part ways with leadership -- which for many is good for their politics. Frontliners don\u2019t need space, they need clear info so they can make a decision for their district.\u201d\n\n-- AND HOW CAN DEMOCRATS UP THE PRESSURE? Remember this: Any Democrat can go to the House floor and demand a vote on impeaching the president. Lawmakers could do it daily, if they wanted to. Letters from caucuses clearly aren\u2019t going to cut it. Democrats haven\u2019t even scratched the surface of the pressure they can exert on their leadership.\n\nON GUNS \u2026 WHAT MOST WHITE HOUSE aides think is that TRUMP will not back background checks, but will instead throw together a mental health package with some other popular items and ask for its passage.\n\n-- NYT: \u201cDivided Democrats Step Back From Assault Weapons Ban,\u201d by Sheryl Gay Stolberg: \u201cAs Democrats make an aggressive push for new gun control legislation, they have made a calculated decision to stop short of pursuing their most ambitious goal: an assault weapons ban.\n\n\u201cThe overwhelming majority of House Democrats \u2014 211, seven shy of the 218 needed for passage \u2014 are co-sponsoring legislation to ban military-style semiautomatic weapons, similar to the ban in effect from 1994 to 2004. But some centrist Democrats remain skittish about any proposal that keeps firearms from law-abiding citizens \u2014 a frequent charge against Democrats by Republicans and gun rights groups \u2014 making any such ban politically risky for moderates in Trump-friendly districts. In the Senate, it draws less support.\n\n\u201cThe split reveals just how complicated gun politics remain inside the Democratic Party, even as mass shootings are terrorizing the nation and the Twitter hashtag #DoSomething has captured the mounting public demands for Congress to act.\u201d NYT\n\n-- BREAKING THIS A.M. \u2026 NYT\u2019S ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: \u201cBusiness Leaders to Call on Congress to Act on Gun Violence: \u2018Doing nothing about America\u2019s gun violence crisis is simply unacceptable,\u2019 the heads of 145 companies tell senators in a letter.\u201d\n\n-- VICE\u2019S ELIZABETH LANDERS: \u201cHe Used to Work at the NRA. Now He\u2019s Shaping Gun Policy at the White House.\u201d\n\nTRUMP\u2019S PLAN FOR THE HOMELESS \u2026 WAPO: \u201cTrump officials tour unused FAA facility in California in search for place to relocate homeless people,\u201d by Jeff Stein, Josh Dawsey and Tracy Jan: \u201cA team of Trump administration officials toured a California facility once used by the Federal Aviation Administration this week as they searched for a potential site to relocate homeless people, according to three government officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private tour. \u2026\n\n\u201cTrump is expected to visit California on Tuesday and Wednesday. One administration official with knowledge of Trump\u2019s visit to California said there were discussions about an announcement related to California\u2019s growing homeless problem next week, but a second official said that any decision could be premature and that it was not on the current schedule for the trip.\u201d WaPo\n\nGood Thursday morning.\n\nA message from Business Roundtable: Business Roundtable CEOs, who operate in virtually every corner of the U.S. economy and whose companies touch virtually every American consumer, sent a letter to Congress this week calling on policymakers to lead on nationwide data privacy policy. See why.\n\nCHANNEL 13/AXIOS\u2019 @BarakRavid: \u201cBREAKING: Netanyahu says before flying to Moscow he conveyed all the needed messages on possible talks with Iran in the proper [direct] channels to President Trump and his advisers.\u201d\n\nKNOWING TRUMP \u2026 WAPO\u2019S ASHLEY PARKER and PHIL RUCKER: \u201c\u2018You\u2019re a prop in the back\u2019: Advisers struggle to obey Trump\u2019s Kafkaesque rules\u201d: \u201cIn President Trump\u2019s renegade orbit, there are unspoken rules he expects his advisers to follow. He tolerates a modicum of dissent, so long as it remains private; expects advisers to fall in line and defend his decisions; and demands absolute fealty at all times. These rules and more were broken by John Bolton, the national security adviser who left the White House suddenly Tuesday on acrimonious terms.\n\n\u201cThe rupture between Trump and Bolton, as chronicled in public and in private accounts of administration officials, is a case study of the president\u2019s sometimes Kafkaesque management style \u2014 an unusual set of demands and expectations he sets for those in his direct employ. The episode also illustrates the varied forces that propel advisers into the president\u2019s inner circle \u2014 and often churn them out with similar velocity.\u201d WaPo\n\nBREAKING WEDNESDAY NIGHT \u2026 \u201cDCCC taps new executive director after summer staff upheaval,\u201d by Heather Caygle, Laura Barr\u00f3n-L\u00f3pez and Jake Sherman: \u201cHouse Democrats' embattled campaign arm has tapped a former staffer and well-known Democratic fundraiser as its executive director following a massive upheaval in its top ranks earlier this summer.\n\n\u201cLucinda Guinn, a former executive at EMILY'S List, will serve as the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's top staffer, according to multiple sources. DCCC Chair Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.) was expected to inform members of the decision on Thursday, those sources said.\n\n\u201cGuinn, who is Hispanic, comes into the role after more than a month-long search following a mass exodus of senior staffers in July, including the former executive director Allison Jaslow. The upheaval followed outcry from Democrats over a lack of diversity at the campaign arm. The DCCC reviewed 40 resumes from around the country and interviewed 13 candidates, more than half were people of color and more than half were women.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- BUSTOS, a former journalist, sent a staff note Wednesday night noting that she \u201chad hoped to share [Guinn\u2019s hire] in person tomorrow, but because a story is breaking prematurely, I wanted you to be the first to know\u201d that the DCCC had hired Guinn.\n\n-- MELANIE ZANONA: \u201cOminous signs could sink Republicans\u2019 chances of retaking the House\u201d\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

MARKEY HEATS UP -- \u201c\u2018I would tell Joe to wait\u2019: Democrats warn Kennedy against challenging Markey,\u201d by Burgess Everett and Heather Caygle: \u201cJoe Kennedy doesn\u2019t just have to beat incumbent Ed Markey to win a Senate seat. He\u2019ll also have to trounce Chuck Schumer, Elizabeth Warren, Senate Democrats campaign arm \u2014 and maybe AOC.\n\n\u201cThe 38-year-old congressman and grandson of Robert F. Kennedy will confront a buzzsaw of Washington Democrats if he takes the leap to challenge Markey in Massachusetts, which would create a massive distraction for the party in a safe Democratic seat amid a battle for both the White House and the Senate majority. \u2026\n\n\u201cWith Kennedy flirting with the race and leading early polls, Markey has moved quickly to shore up support from both the D.C. establishment and prominent progressives. Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) has endorsed him and Schumer said the party is \u2018fully behind Senator Ed Markey.\u2019 Kennedy called Schumer about the race but the Senate minority leader didn\u2019t divulge what was said.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- SEN. KYRSTEN SINEMA ENDORSES: \u201cJoe Kennedy is an outstanding champion for his state. He will make a terrific U.S. Senator and I couldn\u2019t be more proud to support my friend.\u201d Statement\n\n2020 WATCH \u2026 ALEX THOMPSON in POLITICO MAGAZINE: \u201cInside Warren\u2019s War With the Obama Team\u201d\n\n-- ON KAMALA HARRIS: \u201cBig money donors consider staying away from Kamala Harris if she fails to perform at the next debate,\u201d by CNBC\u2019s Brian Schwartz \u2026 NYT: \u201cWhat Kamala Harris Needs to Do Tonight,\u201d by Astead Herndon\n\n-- COMING IN HOT \u2026 BIDEN SURROGATE ED RENDELL SWINGS AT WARREN: \u201cI like Elizabeth Warren. Too bad she\u2019s a hypocrite.\u201d: \u201cWarren didn\u2019t seem to have any trouble taking our money in 2018, but suddenly we were power brokers and influence peddlers in 2019. The year before, we were wonderful. I co-chaired one of the events for the senator and received a glowing, handwritten thank-you letter from her for my hard work.\n\n\u201cIt seemed odd to some of us who gave her money that Warren was experiencing an epiphany less than 12 months later. It\u2019s one thing to fashion a campaign that relies on grass-roots fundraising, but it\u2019s another to go out of your way to characterize as power-brokers and influence-peddlers the very people whose support you have previously courted.\u201d WaPo\n\n-- YEP! \u2026 BOSTON GLOBE: \u201cAfter a summer surge, Elizabeth Warren could be a target in Thursday\u2019s debate,\u201d by Laura Krantz in Austin, Texas\n\nTRUMP\u2019S THURSDAY -- The president will have lunch with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at 12:30 p.m. in the private dining room.
