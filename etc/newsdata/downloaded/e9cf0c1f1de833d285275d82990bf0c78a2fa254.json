A \u201cpostulator\u201d is appointed to collect testimonies and compile all of the candidate\u2019s writings, producing a warts-and-all curriculum vitae.\n\nThe file then goes to the Vatican\u2019s Congregation for the Causes of Saints department, where it is submitted to severe scrutiny by an official known today as the Promoter of Justice \u2014 formerly the Devil\u2019s Advocate.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Venerable\u2019 \u2013\n\nIf the Vatican gives the go-ahead, the candidate is henceforth considered \u201cVenerable\u201d. The search begins for an inexplicable healing attributed to the candidate, who is considered to have interceded with God on behalf of the sick to bring about the \u201cmiracle\u201d.\n\nDoctors and theologians are involved in in-depth investigations of such supposed miracles, and many candidates are rejected at this stage because scientific explanations cannot be ruled out.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Blessed\u2019 \u2013\n\nIf Vatican investigators recognise a \u201cmiracle\u201d, the candidate is \u201cbeatified\u201d, and referred to as \u201cblessed\u201d.\n\n\u2013 Sainthood \u2013\n\nMany years can pass between the attribution of a first and a second miracle and some sainthood candidates never move beyond the \u201cblessed\u201d stage.\n\nIf a second miracle is recognised, however, the candidate can qualify for canonisation, becoming a saint.\n\nIn the case of \u201cGood Pope\u201d John XXIII, who launched the Vatican II reform drive in 1962, Pope Francis waived this requirement with the consent of the College of Cardinals.\n\n\u2013 Costly process, other pathways \u2013\n\nThe process can be very expensive \u2014 costing up to $1 million (900,000 euros) \u2014 and this has tended to favour candidates from the developed world. Italy boasts some 260 saints, while only a dozen have hailed from Africa.\n\nFrancis has however changed the rules to make the process less costly.\n\nOther pathways to sainthood include martyrdom, with dying for one\u2019s faith warranting beatification, although a miracle is still required to attain sainthood.\n\nAnother means, known as \u201cequivalent canonisation\u201d, recognises a candidate who has long been venerated as a saint in his or her local region. Pope Francis has created several saints on this basis.\n\nIn July 2017 the pontiff added a new pathway to becoming a saint for Christians who lay down their lives to save others.", "description": "Vatican City (AFP) \u2013 The canonisation on Sunday of Britain\u2019s Cardinal John Henry Newman \u2014 one of the Roman Catholic Church\u2019s most", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
