Wang was arrested shortly afterward and the case is being investigated, local police said in a statement.\n\nWang\u2019s social media post was published Sunday, a few days after longtime Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey sent a tweet in support of months-long anti-government protests in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Rockets have been arguably the most popular NBA franchise in China since the team drafted Chinese superstar Yao Ming in 2002. Yao played his entire NBA career in Houston.\n\nMorey\u2019s now deleted tweet angered both the NBA\u2019s Chinese partners and U.S. politicians who accused the league of putting a priority on profit, instead of American values such as free speech.\n\nNBA commissioner Adam Silver released a statement on the controversy:\n\n\u201cValues of equality, respect and freedom of expression have long defined the NBA \u2014 and will continue to do so,\u201d Silver said. \u201cThe NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues.\u201d\n\nAs CNN reports, \u201cSilver\u2019s response drew the ire of Chinese authorities and many angry citizens who said they would no longer support the Rockets. Some said they wouldn\u2019t buy Rockets gear unless Morey resigned.\u201d\n\nIn addition, several Chinese retailers and businesses have suspended ties to the Rockets, according to CNN.\n\nA photograph of Wang shows him wearing a mask and a patch over one eye \u2014 symbols that have become synonymous with the ongoing Hong Kong uprising in support of democracy.\n\nAnother photo shows him holding the Chinese flag and a lighter.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter", "description": "Chinese authorities have arrested a Houston Rockets fan who threatened to burn China's national flag \u2014 an illegal act in the communist country", "authors": ["Penny Starr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Getty-Images24-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
