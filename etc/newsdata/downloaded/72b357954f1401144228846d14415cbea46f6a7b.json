KAMALA HARRIS: Frankly, when you look at what he\u2019s been tweeting today, directed at the whistleblower, directed at so many people, I frankly think that based on this and all we\u2019ve seen him do before, including attacking members of Congress, that he \u2014 frankly his Twitter account should be suspended.\n\nI think there is plenty of now evidence to suggest that he is irresponsible with his words in a way that could result in harm to other people. And so the privilege of using those words in that way should probably be taken from him.", "description": "", "authors": ["Realclearpolitics.Com Video Kamala_Harris_Trumps_Twitter_Account_Should_Be_Suspended.Html"], "top_image": ""}
