A representative of Las Vegas Sands Corp did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nU.S.-China trade tensions have led to tariffs on much of the commerce between the world\u2019s two biggest economies, hitting U.S. factories and farms.\n\nWhile the U.S. economy has looked otherwise strong in recent months, a downturn might weigh on Trump\u2019s hopes of winning the November 2020 election.\n\nWashington and Beijing are in talks to restructure their trade relations, although a deal has appeared elusive. On Friday, Chinese officials unexpectedly canceled a visit to farms in Montana and Nebraska as deputy trade negotiators wrapped up two days of negotiations in Washington.", "description": "A top Republican donor warned President Donald Trump in a phone call last month that his escalating trade war with China could hurt his re-election prospects, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday, citing people familiar with the call.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190922&t=2&i=1432724205&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8L0UD-OCABS", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
