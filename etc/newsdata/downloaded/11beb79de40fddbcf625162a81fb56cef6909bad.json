On the probe in France, it asks whether she would resign as commissioner if found guilty. \u201cIf so, are you not afraid that the current procedure in a Member State will weaken your action within the Commission?\u201d\n\nOn the consultant job, the draft asks her to \u201cexhaustively list\u201d all activities \u201cexecuted in the capacity of special advisor to the Berggruen Institute.\u201d\n\nDuring her hearing, Goulard promised to \u201crespect the outcome\u201d of the legal probe into her use of assistants, insisted she was \u201cclean\u201d and called on MEPs to respect her \u201cpresumption of innocence.\u201d\n\nOn the consultant job, the draft asks her to \u201cexhaustively list\u201d all activities \u201cexecuted in the capacity of special advisor to the Berggruen Institute.\u201d It also notes that the Berggruen family contributed to financing Emmanuel Macron's presidential campaign, asking: \u201cHow did you help connecting these people with a view to financing the presidential election?\u201d\n\nRegarding Berggruen Institute founder Nicolas Berggruen, the draft states that he is \u201cpolitically invested in a Member State of the European Union. Does this situation seem to you to be bearable, ethically and politically, in order to assume your functions at the European Commission?\u201d\n\nPolicy questions\n\nThe policy questions MEPs pose are just as sweeping, touching on everything from digital to environmental goals.\n\nThe MEPs note that \u201cmore details are needed to understand whether or not there will be compatibility between your portfolio and that of Commissioner-designate [Margrether Vestager],\u201d who is nominated to take on the post of executive vice president for digital affairs.\n\nOn the Digital Services Act, the MEPs ask Goulard how she intends to \u201cpreserve fundamental rights,\u201d ensure companies don\u2019t have to monitor all the content on their platforms and protect the country of origin principle (where the law applicable to a service is the law where the service is established).\n\nThe commissioner-designate will also have to answer questions on audiovisual policy, her main priorities in that field and how she will ensure the sector will receive \u201cthe focus it requires.\u201d\n\nOn trade, the draft asks: \"What countermeasures will you take against unfair competition from the USA within the WTO?\"\n\nThe draft also touches on her plans for an EU industrial policy, noting that MEPs \u201cfail to see the novelty\u201d in her vision.\n\nThey ask how this strategy would align with the goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050, noting there\u2019s a risk that certain sectors could leave Europe while it pursues this aim: \u201cHow do you plan to support these industries in their decarbonisation process and how will you make decarbonisation an attractive business for the concerned industries?\u201d", "description": "France\u2019s Commission nominee faces extra questions on everything from campaign finance to management.", "authors": ["Ma\u00efa De La Baume", "Emma Anderson", "Laura Kayali"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/20191002_EP-092275A_EVD_0432-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
