However what we offer is the world\u2019s first truly embedded operating system,\u2019 said Melvic Smith, 41, principal owner of Dimensional Weapons Systems, which bills itself as the first patented blockchain-based firearms company.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat system could eventually add any number of applications, Smith told Reuters, including \u2018smart gun\u2019 technology that would only allow the weapon to be fired by a designated shooter\u2019s hand.\n\nMelvic Smith, CEO of Dimensional Weapons Systems, holds a prototype weapon (Reuters/Elijah Nouvelage)\n\nSmart guns in theory could prevent children from accidentally firing guns at home, or render stolen guns useless.\n\n\u2018Our team is composed of veterans, law enforcement officers, people that are pro-Second Amendment to begin with,\u2019 Smith said, referring to the amendment in the U.S. constitution that grants American citizens the right to bear arms.\n\n\u2018But we also have engaged with people in the weapons manufacturing industry. They actually love the technology. They\u2019re worried about political backlash.\u2019\n\nOne investor interested in the technology said the Army contracts could \u2018create a market overnight.\u2019", "description": "The US Army is looking for high-tech 'battlefield solutions'", "authors": ["Jeff Parsons"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Smart-gun-1-e668_1571639008.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
