The suits cast Stamford, Connecticut-based Purdue as a particular villain, saying the company\u2019s marketing of its drugs downplayed addiction risks and led to more widespread opioid prescribing, even though only a sliver of the opioid painkillers sold in the U.S. were its products.\n\nOn Saturday, two state attorneys general leading settlement negotiations with the company \u2014 Tennessee Republican Herbert Slatery and North Carolina Democrat Josh Stein \u2014 sent an email to their colleagues saying talks were at an impasse and that they \u201cexpect Purdue to file for bankruptcy protection imminently.\u201d\n\nA representative for the family declined to comment on the email, which was obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nPurdue has said for months that it wants to reach a deal that would settle all state and local government claims against it, but it also has threatened to file for bankruptcy protection. Bankruptcy would mark a major shift in the multidistrict litigation being overseen by a federal judge in Cleveland. It would likely take Purdue out of the first federal trial over the opioid crisis, scheduled to start Oct. 21.\n\nIf the company opts for bankruptcy, a judge would have a lot of say over how to divide Purdue\u2019s assets.\n\nThe value of the private company, already relatively low, could continue dropping, leaving little to split among thousands of plaintiffs. The company also could go out of business. That\u2019s a big change from settlement proposals that would have kept the company operating in some form. Under one proposal, governments could have seen $10 billion to $12 billion over time, including at least $3 billion from the Sacklers as part of a deal that would have Purdue into a \u201cstructured bankruptcy.\u201d\n\nPennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, who has been part of the negotiations, said the attorneys general did not believe the deal would have been worth that much.\n\nAccording to the email sent Saturday, the company rejected proposals from the states that could have been worth less money but came with greater assurances that the Sacklers would deliver $4.5 billion.\n\nIf the company files for bankruptcy, the Sacklers could still be exposed to lawsuits. At least 17 states have sued one or more family member, and Shapiro said he intends to join them.\n\nBut that could be a legally tenuous option for two reasons.\n\n\u201cOne big problem is it may be very difficult for states to convince judges to rule that family members are personally liable,\u201d Tobias said. \u201cAnd even if that happens, plaintiffs may have problems levying on the Sacklers\u2019 assets, if they are offshore.\u201d\n\nForbes magazine estimated in 2016 that the Sacklers had assets of more than $13 billion. New York\u2019s attorney general has issued subpoenas for financial records of Sackler-connected entities in an effort to find how the family moved money overseas. The Associated Press found last month that a system of trusts and companies makes it difficult to trace the family\u2019s money.\n\n\u201cThis will be a challenging road forward,\u201d Shapiro said in an interview.", "description": "OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma and lawyers representing local governments both said Sunday that they\u2019re interested in continuing negotiations to settle...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ855_Purdue_ZG_20190906151926.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
