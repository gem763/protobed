The raid took place Sunday morning local time in northwestern Syria. According to Trump, commandos cornered Baghdadi in a tunnel before \u201che ignited his [suicide] vest, killing himself and three children.\u201d\n\nBaghdadi was long considered the most wanted man in the world. The US had offered a $25 million reward for information concerning his whereabouts. He had arrived at the location in Syria 48 hours prior to the US raid, a senior Turkish official told the AP.\n\nThe military operation was three days in the making, said Trump, who thanked Russia, Turkey, Syria, and Iraq for their help with it. He went on to thank Syrian Kurds \u201cfor certain support they were able to give us.\u201d\n\nBaghdadi\u2019s death follows Trump abruptly, and controversially, removing the US military presence in a part of Syria bordering Turkey. That move led to Turkey attacking Kurdish forces in the area who had been strong US allies in the fight against ISIS (Kurdish insurgents have long wanted separation from Turkey to establish an independent Kurdistan). It also created opportunities for ISIS, with more than 100 of its fighters escaping from Kurdish-run prisons.\n\nBut some US officials also saw potential opportunity, if ISIS leaders became more detectable communicating with operatives while taking advantage of the situation.\n\nIronically, the operation highlights the value of having US forces in the area. Indeed Trump had reversed course a bit in recent days, sending some troops back into Syria to protect oil fields that might otherwise fall into ISIS\u2019s hands.\n\nLast night, Trump teased today\u2019s announcement with a vague tweet saying: \u201cSomething very big has just happened!\u201d This morning, he described what it was like for him to view the operation from the White House Situation Room, saying it was \u201cas though you were watching a movie.\u201d He emphasized the \u201cwhimpering\u201d and \u201ccrying\u201d of Baghdadi\u2019s last moments, and referred to members of ISIS as \u201closers,\u201d \u201cfrightened puppies,\u201d and \u201chardcore killers.\u201d", "description": "ISIS founder and leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi died during a Sunday morning raid in Syria.", "authors": ["Daniel Wolfe"], "top_image": "https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/baghdadi-feature-e1572184708908.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1400", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
