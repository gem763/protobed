Many of the deaths occurred during looting when supermarkets were set on fire.\n\nProtests began eight days ago over a proposed price hike for subway tickets in the capital city Santiago but have since expanded, revealing deep-seated anger among ordinary Chileans who feel they have been excluded from the country's economic rise.\n\nChile is one of Latin America's wealthiest countries, but it also has one of highest levels of income inequality in the world\n\nMany jobs are informal or temporary, with young people and women among those struggling the most to find quality, skilled work. Calls for wider economic reform over a number of issues including pensions, healthcare and public education show the cracks in the country's progress since its transition to democracy in 1990.\n\nPinera announced the suspension of the price hike on Saturday but it did little to quell the unrest. On Monday night, the Chilean Senate approved the cancellation of the proposed fare increase, with Senators condemning the acts of violence and calling for more unity and empathy to resolve the country's problems.\n\nPinera said in a press conference Monday night that he has heard the people's plight for a better life and insisted \"violence will not prevail.\" He also announced plans to meet with different groups including the opposition on Tuesday to come up with solutions for the country in crisis.\n\nThe President had previously incensed protesters by saying, \"we are at war with a powerful enemy ... that does respect anyone or anything.\"\n\nDemonstrators clash with riot police in Santiago, Chile.\n\nMilitary on the streets\n\nThe extended curfew, which was first introduced on Saturday, began at 8 p.m. local time (7 p.m. ET) Monday in Santiago and will end at 6 a.m. (5 a.m.ET) Tuesday October 22.\n\nSeveral cities in the country have also been placed under a state of emergency as thousands have taken to the streets. The corporate headquarters of a utility company in downtown Santiago were firebombed Friday, and on Saturday, in the port city of Valparaiso, the offices of the country's oldest newspaper, Mercurio were torched, Reuters reported\n\nHundreds of flights were canceled from Santiago Airport over the weekend and schools have closed. Images on social media show long lines of people queued up outside supermarkets in the capital waiting to buy food and supplies.\n\nThe government has responded by deploying thousands of police and armed soldiers to put down the unrest -- the first time the military has been deployed since Gen. Augusto Pinochet's 17-year military dictatorship ended in 1990. Images of armored vehicles rolling down the streets of Santiago is a stark reminder of that brutal era in which nearly 2,300 people disappeared and 40,000 were tortured.\n\nOn Monday, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and former Chilean leader Michelle Bachelet urged for dialogue between protesters and authorities and called for an independent investigation into the deaths and injuries.\n\n\"There are disturbing allegations of excessive use of force by security and armed forces, and I am also alarmed by reports that some detainees have been denied access to lawyers, which is their right, and that others have been mistreated while in detention,\" Bachelet said.\n\nCiting Chile's Ministry of Interior, Bachelet said 1,906 people have been detained since protests began.\n\nA demonstrator is detained by the police during a protest in Santiago, Chile, October 19, 2019\n\nStable but unequal economy\n\nBut there is a chasm between the richest 10% and poorest 10% of its population. Almost a third of Chilean workers are employed in informal or non-permanent jobs, and one in two Chileans has low literacy skills, according to the OECD.\n\nMany Chileans said they are frustrated with rising living costs, low wages and what they see is an inadequate pension system.\n\n\"This is not a simple protest over the rise of metro fares, this is an outpouring for years of oppression that have hit mainly the poorest,\" Karina Sepulveda, an anthropology student, told Reuters at a protest in central Santiago on Sunday.\n\n\"The illusion of the model Chile is over. Low wages, lack of healthcare and bad pensions have made people tired.\"\n\nDemonstrators clash with riot police during protests in Valparaiso, Chile, on October 20, 2019.\n\nOthers have directed their anger at the center-right billionaire President Pinera, who was photographed eating in an upmarket Italian restaurant as protests raged.\n\nPinera was re-elected in 2017 after governing the country from 2010 to 2014 on promises of transforming his homeland into a developed nation by 2020.\n\nIn an interview with the Financial Times a week before the protests kicked off, the President compared Chile to other countries in Latin America blighted by economic and political turmoil.\n\n\"Argentina and Paraguay are in recession, Mexico and Brazil in stagnation, Peru and Ecuador in deep political crisis and in this context Chile looks like an oasis,\" said Pinera.", "description": "Broken glass and bricks littered streets in Santiago after more violent protests Monday, prompting Chile's government to extend a curfew in the capital for a third straight day.", "authors": ["Helen Regan", "Christopher Ulloa"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191022122752-chile-protests-1021-02-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
