King's daughter Gabrielle is one example.\n\n\u201cI compare my posts to other people,\u201d said Gabrielle. \u201cWhy don\u2019t people like my posts? Is it because I\u2019m not good enough? Whenever my picture doesn\u2019t have a lot of likes or comments after the first hour, I just delete it.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, \u201cGood Morning America\u201d set up a similar experiment in which a group of 15-to-17-year-old girls candidly discussed the stresses they face, especially as a result of how pervasive social media is in their lives.\n\nThe same year, the American Psychological Association (APA) released a report that found approximately 79 percent of parents said that their teens use social media. Additionally, 69 percent of the parents of teen girls reported that they worried about the influence of social media on their child's health, compared to only 39 percent of parents of teen boys.\n\nAt least two parents of kids in SHE Media's video project told \"GMA\" that knowing what they know now, they wish they had held off on giving their kid a phone and limited television time as well.\n\nSkey plans to continue to explore the group of kids in the Hatch Kids project through their high school years.\n\nThe kids' parents predict they'll continue to experience life as a roller coaster, but want other parents to know that it\u2019s going to be all right.\n\n\u201cI want parents to take away that the kids are gonna be OK,\u201d said Peter McCabe, father of 14-year-old Jojo. \u201cThat everyone -- all people go through stages, not just through adolescence but through the rest of your life.\u201d", "description": "A video project called", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/190920_gma_roberts1_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
