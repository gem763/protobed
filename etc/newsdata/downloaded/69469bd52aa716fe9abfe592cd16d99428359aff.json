Foley Legacy Foundation said in a statement, referring to the National Security Council. The group was set up to honor journalist James Foley, who was murdered by the Islamic State, and to advocate on behalf of those still held overseas.\n\nSince the beginning of the Trump administration, some 20 Americans have been released from imprisonment or captivity abroad, though it is difficult to say whether O\u2019Brien\u2019s efforts were pivotal in the release of those freed under his watch. Those individuals include Andrew Brunson, a pastor held in Turkey; Danny Burch, an engineer jailed in Yemen; and Jamie Sponaugle, a former Air Force service member who was accused of acting as a mercenary in Libya\u2019s civil war.\n\nO\u2019Brien has shown himself to be a skilled bureaucrat, developing a strong channel to top administration officials and securing a role in policy deliberations beyond hostage issues, the people close to the families said.\n\nBut some from the families of hostages have faulted O\u2019Brien, and the Trump administration, for trumpeting the release of others, including prominent athletes and musicians, who are detained by foreign governments but aren\u2019t considered hostages in the same way that those whose lives are at risk in the custody of militant groups or hostile regimes.\n\nFamily members of American hostages, some of whose identities are not widely known, were furious when O\u2019Brien spent a week in Sweden monitoring the trial of American rapper A$AP Rocky, who was accused of violent assault following a street fight in June. His trial became a media circus and attracted the attention of celebrities and Trump, who took personal interest in the issue after hearing from some of his famous friends.\n\nThe family members said O\u2019Brien, who has part-time status at the State Department, could have devoted the energy he spent monitoring the rapper\u2019s public trial working to free people held without any official acknowledgment, whose cases have vanished from the headlines, said a person who worked with O\u2019Brien.\n\nThe incident may say less about O\u2019Brien\u2019s personal views about the rapper and more about how he, like other senior officials across the government, have found themselves immersed in initiatives that have seized the president\u2019s attention.\n\nThe rapper and two of his associates were allowed to leave Sweden and were later found guilty and given conditional sentences, meaning they faced no prison time in Sweden unless they committed another similar offense there.\n\nTrump appeared to take some credit for the release and sent tweets about the case, including one in which he said he would call Sweden\u2019s prime minister \u201cto see what we can do about helping A$AP Rocky.\u201d\n\nA native of Los Angeles, O\u2019Brien grew up Catholic but converted to Mormonism in his 20s after meeting his South African-born wife. During the George W. Bush administration, he served in several diplomatic and international positions, working for a time with John Bolton, his predecessor as national security adviser, at the United Nations.\n\nA former major in the Army Reserve, O\u2019Brien has also dabbled in politics, serving as an adviser to Republicans Mitt Romney, Scott Walker and Ted Cruz.\n\nIn his 2016 book on American foreign policy, O\u2019Brien described an erosion of U.S. influence under President Barack Obama, deriding what he depicted as a \u201cwishful thinking foreign policy approach\u201d that had atrophied the military and ceded power to China and Russia.\n\n\u201cI am certain the American people still believe in winning; that they still see our land as the \u2018shining city on a hill,\u2019 \u201d he wrote, predicting the United States was on the cusp of a \u201ccomeback\u201d like the one he said occurred after the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980.\n\n(O\u2019Brien\u2019s book received a positive review from Richard Grenell, the then-Fox News contributor who is now Trump\u2019s ambassador to Germany and was another official under consideration for the national security adviser job).\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s definitely a conservative, but he\u2019s a California conservative, so there\u2019s a libertarian and humanitarian core to it,\u201d said an individual who has interacted with O\u2019Brien in his hostage envoy role and who, like other people who had worked with him, spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly.\n\nAfter Trump\u2019s election, according to people who know him and have worked with him, O\u2019Brien was initially hoping to be nominated as secretary of the Navy. Some State Department personnel believed O\u2019Brien, who had spent years working on foreign policy issues and paid especially close attention to naval matters, saw the hostage envoy position, which he eventually assumed in 2018, as a step toward a higher-level, more influential administration post.\n\nAs hostage envoy, the person who worked with him said, O\u2019Brien has been seen as sincere and personable in his interactions with families of Americans imprisoned overseas, \u201csuggesting he\u2019s got a high EQ,\u201d or emotional quotient.\n\nAt the State Department he became close to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, whose close ties to Trump may have helped him land the White House job. Pompeo praised O\u2019Brien on Twitter on Wednesday, saying that \u201cto keep America safe we must lead from a posture of strength. If anyone understands that, it\u2019s Robert.\u201d\n\nCarol Morello and Karoun Demirjian contributed to this report.", "description": "But some have faulted Robert O\u2019Brien for trumpeting the release of prominent athletes and musicians detained by foreign governments.", "authors": ["Missy Ryan", "Reporter Covering The Pentagon", "Military Issues", "National Security", "Shane Harris", "Intelligence", "National Security Reporter", "John Hudson", "National Security Reporter Focusing On The State Department", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/EcVvmctLMIx7imDGt91UE8eY804=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HFPV5OG2JEI6TLDDGALHCFKD7Y.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
