He had previously reported similar concerns to a superior on July 10.\n\nLt Col Vindman is currently the director of European affairs on the White House's National Security Council.\n\nHe was the first serving White House official to give evidence, and arrived for the private hearing in full military uniform.\n\nThe soldier and diplomat said: \"I was concerned by the [July 25] call. I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a US citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the US government's support of Ukraine.\"\n\nHe said Mr Trump's approach had been a \"partisan play\" and \"would all undermine US national security.\"\n\nDemocrats have argued that, in the phone call, Mr Trump offered a \"quid pro quo\" to the Ukrainian leader - investigate Mr Biden for alleged corruption and the US would release $400 million in military aid to Ukraine. Mr Trump has denied the accusation.\n\nAs the witness was giving evidence Mr Trump called him a \"Never Trumper\".\n\nThe president wrote on Twitter: \"Why are people that I never even heard of testifying about the call. Was he on the same call that I was? Can\u2019t be possible!\"\n\nLt Col Vindman was himself born in Ukraine, arriving in the US aged three.\n\nSome of Mr Trump's allies questioned his loyalties, but senior Republicans called it \"shameful\" to doubt the patriotism of a decorated and wounded US soldier.\n\nHis evidence came a day after Nancy Pelosi, the Democrat Speaker of the House, said there would be a vote on Thursday to formalise procedures for the impeachment investigation, which could include televised hearings.", "description": "A US Army officer serving at the White House told the impeachment inquiry Donald Trump's effort to have Ukraine investigate his Democrat rival Joe Biden \"undermined national security.\" Alexander Vindman, a lieutenant colonel who was injured in Iraq, gave evidence behind closed doors to", "authors": ["Nick Allen"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Z8aUyDp3ai6tObaEu1O87Q--~B/aD0yMDc1O3c9MjA3NTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_258/6afc79dd170cb8bb836cd22325948583", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
