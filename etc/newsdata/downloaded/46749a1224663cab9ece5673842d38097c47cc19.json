An additional plant in Fontana, California is also slated for closure, the UAW document said.\n\n\"We remain strongly opposed to GM's decision to 'unallocate' these plants and we will continue our efforts to fight for UAW jobs in America,\" the summary said.\n\n\"Your bargaining committee fought for and won the following assistance package for our members at the plants described below, who suffered through a painful transition.\"\n\nProvisions for workers affected by the closures included a $75,000 or $85,000 payment for retirement-eligible employees who decide to retire and buyout packages for workers depending on their years of service.", "description": "General Motors' proposed agreement to end a labor strike includes a wage increase and faster transition to fulltime status for temporary workers but permanently shuts four plants, according to a union summary released Thursday.
