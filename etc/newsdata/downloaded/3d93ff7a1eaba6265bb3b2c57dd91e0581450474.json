If not, do you know of another benefit I may be entitled to? My wife is a part-time nurse so I\u2019m not sure about income related benefits.\n\nEmma Gunn of This is Money replies: First off, I am so sorry to hear about your diagnosis, and treatment. While it's clear you still face a lot of struggles, it's great to hear the treatment has been successful, congratulations.\n\nUnfortunately, you are not alone in feeling the immense strain cancer puts on your finances. Extra costs for travel and bills hit alongside a drop in income for those unable to work during or after treatment.\n\nFor many patients it\u2019s one of the most stressful struggles, at a time when their focus and energy needs to be elsewhere.\n\nThe barrage of side effects during treatment, and those that continue longer term, can make work difficult for some, or impossible, as sadly in your case.\n\nThe benefits system can be a welcome safety net, but it can be frustratingly complicated, particularly at such a time of stress when you have chemo brain and overwhelming fatigue to contend with as well.\n\nWe asked an expert at Macmillan Cancer Support for help with your query, one of its specialities as a charity is helping cancer patients with financial worries during treatment, including how to navigate the benefits maze.\n\nCancer can be costly: Frequent hospital visits mean hefty travel bills on top of higher living costs\n\nKathryn Phillips, welfare rights team specialist at Macmillan Cancer Support replies: Thanks for getting in touch. At Macmillan we know that a cancer diagnosis can have a devastating impact on your finances, and it\u2019s good that you are exploring the support that might be available to you.\n\nIn order to qualify for contribution-based ESA you need to satisfy the National Insurance contribution conditions for two specific tax years. There are two conditions which both need to be met.\n\nThe first is that you must have been working and paying National Insurance for at least 26 weeks in one of the relevant tax years. If you are claiming benefits now, in 2019, the tax years which would be relevant to you are 2016/17 and 2017/18.\n\nThis unfortunately means that if you have not worked and paid National Insurance since 2014/15 then you will not meet the criteria, and you will not be able to receive the benefit.\n\nSome people choose to apply for the benefit anyway though, even if they won\u2019t receive any extra money, because they will be given National Insurance credits which can help them to qualify for a state pension.\n\nThere are a few exceptions to the National Insurance conditions but based on your inquiry I would not expect them to apply to you.\n\nMost other benefits are means-tested, or income-related so we are not able to assess if you would be entitled to any of those without more information about your wife\u2019s earnings, any other household income, any savings that you have, and whether you are paying rent and council tax.\n\nHowever, the main exception is Personal Independence Payment, which is a benefit for people who are working age and who struggle with either mobility or daily living tasks.\n\nThis benefit is not means-tested and does not depend on National Insurance. You must have had difficulties for at least three months and expect them to continue for a further nine months.\n\nIt does sound like it may be helpful for you to have a full benefits assessment.\n\nYou can do this by speaking to a welfare rights adviser on the Macmillan Support Line (0808 808 0000) visit our website macmillan.org.uk to find out more about the physical, financial and emotional support we can offer.\n\nEmma Gunn of This is Money continues: Unfortunately, as Kathryn Phillips explains you won\u2019t qualify for ESA.\n\nESA recently changed: previously it consisted of two parts, based on income or NI contributions. Depending on your wife's income you may have qualified under the old system but sadly this has now been scrapped and replaced by just a contribution element.\n\nESA is just one of the benefits cancer patients will typically be able to apply for though, as Kathryn Phillips mentions, and it is worth speaking to a benefits expert to guide you through the process and see if you would be eligible for PIP.\n\nThere may be extra help elsewhere too. It's particularly worth speaking to your banks and credit card companies, and even your energy company, as they may offer some help or leniency should you need it.\n\nWe have written about the extra hidden help out there for cancer patients here.", "description": "I was diagnosed with a rare and incurable form of blood cancer that put me out of work two years ago, can I claim Employment Support Allowance or get any other help?", "authors": ["Emma Gunn For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
