It is to turn Hong Kong into an independent or semi-independent political entity and subvert 'one country, two systems'. This is a delusion. Hong Kong is China's Hong Kong.\"\n\nA poster advertising Thursday's demonstration of solidarity with protesters in Catalonia said: \"United We Stand Against Tyranny\".\n\nDemonstrators in Catalonia, who protested for nine consecutive nights from October 14, are angry over the conviction of their leaders for sedition and at what they see as attempts to thwart their ambition for greater autonomy from the rest of Spain.\n\n\"Too provocative\"\n\nSome Hong Kong protesters went online to urge people not to attend the show of support for the Catalan movement, saying it was too provocative and risked denting international support for their own cause.\n\nHong Kong authorities formally banned a group promoting independence from China in September last year, the first time a political organisation has been outlawed since the 1997 handover.", "description": "Hong Kong demonstrators to hold protest in support of independent Catalonia.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/25/54/16/1000x563_cmsv2_6c79c686-50d1-5351-ae2b-5d86f5fd7440-4255416.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
