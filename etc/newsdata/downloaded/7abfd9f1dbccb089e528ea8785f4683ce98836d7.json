His departure earlier this week was a surprise, the person said, because he had made partner only recently.\n\nGoldman's new CEO, David Solomon, has been trimming the pool of the bank's highest-ranking execs to keep an air of exclusivity around the \"partner\" title and to reserve it for the biggest rainmakers. The Wall Street bank has been offering buyouts to entice bankers to leave, Business Insider's Dakin Campbell has reported, after Solomon felt the partner ranks had swelled under his predecessor, Lloyd Blankfein.\n\nThe securities-division cohead Marty Chavez and the equities cochief Jeff Nedelman departed the bank earlier this month. The cochief information officer Elisha Wiesel and the HR boss Dane Holmes have also left.\n\nSolomon's drive to trim the partner ranks is relatively subdued in the London office \u2014 at least so far.\n\nIn May, an internal memo seen by Business Insider announced the retirement of Richard Manley, a Goldman partner who co-ran the bank's equity research in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.\n\nRead more: Marty Chavez is retiring from Goldman Sachs. We chatted with him about the bank's tech transformation, why now is the right time for him to step down, and what he's planning next.\n\nBeing a Goldman partner has perks aside from the prestige \u2014 a roughly $1 million base salary and a bonus that might be a few times that. About 69 new Goldman partners were minted at the start of the year, and the bank has cut its number of partners from 500 at the beginning of 2019 to about 450 currently.\n\nGoldman Sachs declined to comment. Business Insider has reached out to Dhar for comment.", "description": "Arun Dhar was a partner in the bank's equities unit in London.
