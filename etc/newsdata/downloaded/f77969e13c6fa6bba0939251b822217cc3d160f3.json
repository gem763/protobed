Seven of those were directed at Biden, and six at Trump, according to the tally.\n\nThe candidates attacked Trump 36 times 0 5 attacks 10 Castro Biden Sanders Buttigieg Harris Klobuchar Biden fended off Castro and Sanders while also attacking Warren over health care Booker O\u2019Rourke Yang Warren The candidates attacked Trump 36 times 5 attacks 10 attacks 0 Castro Biden Sanders Castro went after Biden 7 times on health care and immigration Buttigieg Harris Biden fended off Castro and Sanders while also attacking Warren over health care Klobuchar Booker O\u2019Rourke Yang Warren only attacked once during the night Warren The candidates attacked Trump 36 times 5 attacks 10 attacks 0 Castro Biden Sanders Castro went after Biden 7 times on health care and immigration Buttigieg Harris Biden fended off Castro and Sanders while also attacking Warren over health care Klobuchar Booker O\u2019Rourke Yang Warren only attacked once during the night Warren\n\nCastro\u2019s attacks may have fallen flat. At one point during an exchange on health care, he repeatedly suggested Biden\u2019s memory had failed him, but it\u2019s not clear that Biden had forgotten anything.\n\nBiden spent some of his time fending off Castro\u2019s attacks, as well as criticizing the liberal candidates on the stage.\n\nHe questioned \u201cmy distinguished friend,\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and \u201cmy friend from Vermont,\u201d Sen. Bernie Sanders (I). More centrist candidates such as Sen. Amy Klobuchar and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg also critiqued Sanders\u2019s plans.\n\n[Democrats clash over health care and more in debate that started with calls for unity]\n\nWarren delivered only a single attack, directed at Trump. She joined tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang and Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) in not attack anyone else onstage.\n\nObama was a punching bag in the previous two debates, but Castro was one of several who sought to align with him this time around.\n\nHow many times candidates aligned with Obama\n\n4 Biden Obama 4 Castro 3 1 Klobuchar 1 1 1 Harris O\u2019Rourke Yang Warren Obama 4 1 4 1 3 1 1 Klobuchar Castro Biden Warren O\u2019Rourke Yang Harris\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fulfilling the legacy of Barack Obama, and you\u2019re not,\u201d Castro said to Biden during the health-care exchange.\n\n\u201cThat will be a surprise to him,\u201d Biden returned.\n\nBiden, Castro and Klobuchar each praised Obama multiple times over the course of the debate.\n\nObama was not the only figure to get some love.

Many will not appear together onstage next month, as the debate will once again be split across two nights thanks to billionaire Tom Steyer\u2019s recent polling qualification.\n\n\n\nCandidates converse Thursday after the debate at Texas Southern University in Houston.
