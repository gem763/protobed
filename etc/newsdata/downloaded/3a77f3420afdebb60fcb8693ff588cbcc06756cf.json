While some observers held up the prominence of the Cajun Navy as an example of governmental failures, emergency managers have, in recent years, begun to factor such efforts into their calculations about how to handle major crises.\n\n\u201cWhen you step back and look at most disasters, you talk about first responders\u2014lights and sirens\u2014that\u2019s bullshit,\u201d the former FEMA director Craig Fugate told me in 2015. \u201cThe first responders are the neighbors, bystanders, the people that are willing to act.\u201d\n\nIn part, this emphasis on neighbors helping one another is simple realism. In a big enough disaster, no state or federal agency can move all the resources people will need into an area immediately, especially if critical infrastructure such as roads and communications networks are destroyed. In part, it\u2019s a realization that though a storm is devastating, it\u2019s not often annihilating, and some of what people need is already on the ground. And in part, it\u2019s designed to empower people after a storm. Fugate led a charge to stop referring to them as \u201cvictims,\u201d with its implication of helplessness, and refer to them instead as \u201csurvivors.\u201d Incorporating them into the formal relief plans returns their agency.\n\nThe importance of people helping one another, whether they\u2019re semi-organized teams like the Cajun Navy or just individuals checking on an elderly neighbor, means that the best determinant of how well a community fares in a storm is often not what happens after landfall, but what it was like before the wind and water hit.\n\n\u201cWe know what makes people safer in disasters is close social networks, more equality in the community, and having high social capital,\u201d says Jacob Remes, a historian and disaster scholar at NYU. \u201cThe sort of work you have to do to build communities that will do well in disaster, you can\u2019t do in the days or the week before the disaster. You have to be doing them all the time.\u201d\n\nThat means places that have bustling public spaces, walkable streetscapes, lower crime, and better housing stock tend to fare better, because people are more likely to know their neighbors and consequently feel an obligation to them.\n\n\u201cBecause of segregation by race and class, the communities that tend to have these physical aspects that make them safer are also where people who are richer and better educated and whiter live,\u201d Remes says. That means other demographic groups are more vulnerable when storms hit\u2014though there are plenty of examples of poorer but tight-knit communities reacting effectively in places such as post-Katrina New Orleans.", "description": "The best determinant of how well a community fares in a storm is often not what happens after landfall, but what it was like before the wind and water hit.", "authors": ["David A.
