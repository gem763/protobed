Even the most careful people have accidents! Of course, sturdy doesn\u2019t have to mean boring; our picks have bags of character and will add interesting focal points to any room in the house.\n\nMake sure to choose pots that are about two inches larger than your plant\u2019s current pot, so that it has plenty of space. Pots with drainage holes are preferable, but you can also add some larger stones at the bottom of pots that don\u2019t have any to create a drainage space.\n\nYou can also repurpose them as holders for pencils or knick knacks, or whatever you like. We\u2019ve been on the hunt for the best new house plant pots to perk up your green spaces, here\u2019s our favourites.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews. We may earn commission from some of the retailers, but we never allow this to influence selections, which are formed from real-world testing and expert advice. This revenue helps to fund journalism across The Independent.\n\nStudio Arhoj large terracotta tri-pot: \u00a342, Goodhood\n\nMeasurements: 18cm x 15cm\n\nThe minimalism of this pot works really well with large plants, as it elevates the appeal of your greenery while still being a conversation starter. Unusual in its appearance as well as its practicality, this pot has three short legs that act as drainage holes, allowing water to trickle down into the saucer it stands in. It\u2019s got a good weight, making it the perfect base for plants that like taking up room such as parlour palms, big calatheas, or large cacti.\n\nBuy now\n\nArket terracotta flower pot: \u00a325, Arket\n\nMeasurements: 17cm x 18cm\n\nThis lovely terracotta pot has a mustard coloured glaze that will add some much needed colour to the coming winter days, without being too obnoxious.

This little fellow is bound to put a smile on your face. Handmade in the UK, this pot is an all-rounder. It won\u2019t take up loads of space, but that means it can\u2019t really hold any large plants \u2013 but we think it looks great with creeping types such as devil\u2019s ivy, donkey tail succulents, or string-of-pearls that will hang over the side, making it look like the pot has an unruly haircut. It\u2019ll be a welcome home for that new cutting you\u2019ve been nurturing.\n\nBuy now\n\nBurgon & Ball jade green elaborate pot: \u00a39.99, Hortology\n\nMeasurements: 14cm x 12cm\n\nCeramic\u2019s the name, sophistication is the game.

Any type of small to medium-sized succulents would look adorable in this, but it doesn\u2019t have drainage holes so do remember to line the bottom of the planter with small stones or use cactus soil.
