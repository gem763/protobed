Well-intended though it may be, how do you respond when you know that sleep isn\u2019t the solution? Plenty of beauty guides offer solutions for puffiness, bags, and even hyperpigmentation. But for those of us with deep tear troughs and tissue-thin skin, the common refrain tends to be \u201cfind yourself a good concealer.\u201d A good concealer is part of the routine, but it\u2019s a myth that there\u2019s no way to treat this subocular, suboptimal condition, save for injections and implants. These four products may not make your under-eye circles disappear completely, but use them diligently and you\u2019ll notice improvements you never thought were possible.\n\nBaebody Eye Gel, $25 on Amazon: Trend-watchers took note of a brand called \u201cBaebody\u201d about a year ago, once it had become the \u201c#1 Best Selling Eye Gel on the Internet\u201d thanks to thousands of rave reviews on Amazon. The hype is deserved -- this product yields noticeable results and should be the foundation of any dark-circle-fighting crusade. A collagen-boosting peptide complex gets to work upon application, producing a satisfying tingle. It dries quickly and won\u2019t reject any makeup you apply after. In the evening, go ahead and spread it all over your face, too. It reduces fine lines and works its under-eye, skin-thickening magic overnight. No matter how you sleep, you\u2019ll wake up looking fresh.\n\nOLEHENRICKSEN Banana Bright Eye Cream, $33 at Sephora: Packed in a tiny bottle, this eye cream is perfect for traveling, when a bulky jar of Baebody is impractical. On camping trips or other jaunts where makeup won\u2019t be top priority, it\u2019s your best friend and secret weapon. In addition to being a vitamin C-infused and collagen-boosting skin cream, it\u2019s also a featherweight neutralizer. The banana powder that gives the product its name and hue offsets darkness with a dose of light-reflecting shimmer. You\u2019re not technically wearing any makeup, but you\u2019re still reaping the brightening benefits.\n\nMaybelline Dream Fresh BB Cream, $9 at Ulta: There\u2019s no reason to stop at the eyes when applying this broad spectrum beauty staple to your face (just be careful not to get it in them). For lighter skin tones, the subtle orange tint mutes purple and blue tones. If you can\u2019t bear the idea of going out in public without some coverage, take a one-and-done approach with BB cream for a natural-looking, even finish.\n\nBARESKIN Complete Coverage Serum Concealer, $22 at Ulta: Where to begin with concealers? Try BARESKIN, which acts as more than a daily Band-Aid for genetic under-eye problems. As a concealer, it glides on ultra-light but hyperpigmented, overpowering even the deepest of dusky shades. As a serum, it\u2019s moisturizing and anti-aging. As both, it\u2019s a champion product with powerful cosmetic effects and long-term benefits.\n\nScouted is internet shopping with a pulse.
