Next week we\u2019ll ask about U.S. foreign policy: \u201cIs President Trump an isolationist? An Obama-style \u2018realist\u2019? Or something else entirely?\u201d Students should click here to submit opinions of fewer than 250 words before Oct. 22. The best responses will be published that night.\n\nNot \u2018Inappropriate\u2019 at All\n\nThe tweet that enraged the Chinese government, \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong,\u201d is one the National Basketball Association should celebrate. Instead, the NBA apologized for the tweet\u2019s author, Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey. In its Oct. 7 Chinese-language statement, the league declared itself \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d in Mr. Morey\u2019s \u201cinappropriate comments.\u201d\n\nIn what America is an expression of support for democracy\u2014an appeal for solidarity with courageous people protesting an oppressive government\u2014considered \u201cinappropriate\u201d? In the past, the NBA has acted differently. It supported athletes such as LeBron James, Kobe Bryant and Derrick Rose, who used their platforms as basketball players to support the Black Lives Matter movement, which is no stranger to controversy. \u201cPolitical speech is an absolute right within the league,\u201d Commissioner Adam Silver said last year. The NBA even pulled its 2017 all-star game out of Charlotte, N.C., due to the state\u2019s transgender bathroom bill. The difference here is that the NBA worried that free speech critical of China could leave a dent in its business.\n\n\u201c A company that takes a progressive stance on transgender bathrooms but acquiesces to a totalitarian regime that denies its 1.4 billion citizens fundamental human rights either has a twisted worldview or the backbone of a jellyfish. \u201d\n\nA company that takes a progressive stance on transgender bathrooms but acquiesces to a totalitarian regime that denies its 1.4 billion citizens fundamental human rights either has a twisted worldview or the backbone of a jellyfish.\n\n\u2014 Jessica Jakoby, Cornell Tech, computer science\n\nWhat the NBA Did Right\n\nAs the general manager of the Houston Rockets, Daryl Morey should have thought hard before tweeting his support for the Hong Kong protests. Business executives must know that their words reflect on their organizations, and that getting embroiled in political or cultural fights can hurt the company and all those who rely on it. Since the Houston Rockets are particularly popular in China, it wasn\u2019t hard to predict that Mr. Morey\u2019s tweet would encounter intense backlash, risking the Rockets\u2019 entire business in China.\n\nDespite the widespread criticism, the National Basketball Association handled the resulting crisis appropriately. The league acknowledged that offending Chinese fans was \u201cregrettable\u201d but nevertheless defended the right of executives and athletes to speak their minds. After being pressed further, Commissioner Adam Silver clarified the league\u2019s position: \u201cWe are not apologizing for Daryl exercising his freedom of expression.\u201d The league has resisted Chinese pressure\u2014Mr. Morey still has his job and Beijing remains without a formal apology.\n\nThe organizations that deserve criticism, however, are those that bend the knee to China\u2019s economic might. Many Hollywood studios censor their movies for Chinese audiences; Mercedes-Benz has apologized for quoting the Dalai Lama; and Apple has removed the Taiwanese flag emoji from its keyboard in certain jurisdictions.\n\nThe NBA hasn\u2019t done anything like that. Put in a difficult situation, it defended its interests without sacrificing core American values. Many other Western companies can learn from it.\n\n\u2014 Eric Asen, Vanderbilt University, political science and economics\n\nThe NBA Can\u2019t Have it Both Ways\n\nThe economic bullying and narcissistic sensitivity of the Chinese Communist Party is limited only by its victims\u2019 prostration. Give the bullies an inch and they take a mile. They not only use American companies and technology to censor Chinese people, but also intimidate those same companies into condemning or censoring their own American employees.\n\n\u201c As an American business, the NBA ought to be consistent. Stay standing or remain seated. \u201d\n\nThe National Basketball Association tried to satisfy everybody with its response to China\u2019s boycott and ended up satisfying nobody. The league\u2019s half-apology simply made it look bad. Everyone could tell the NBA was trying to have it both ways. It wanted to affirm the right to free speech while also telling its people to shut up and dribble\u2014or compute statistics, in Mr. Morey\u2019s case. As an American business, the NBA ought to be consistent. Stay standing or remain seated.\n\n\u2014Mack Meas, Northwestern University, M.B.A.\n\nClick here to submit a response to the next Future View.", "description": "Students grade the NBA\u2019s response to Beijing\u2019s bullying.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-117146/social", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
