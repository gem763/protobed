O\u2019Neill wrote \u201cThe High Frontier: Human Colonies in Space\u201d (1976). Under NASA\u2019s direction, Mr. O\u2019Neill commissioned artists and designers to visualize his ideas. We see some here, in the gallery in which the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art has mounted \u201cFar Out: Suits, Habs, and Labs for Outer Space.\u201d They are exuberant sci-fi imaginings of a world of play, leisure and invention, painted by Rick Guidice.\n\nFar Out: Suits, Habs, and Labs for Outer Space San Francisco Museum of Modern Art\n\nThrough Jan. 20, 2020\n\nIn one, people with mini-jet-packs frolic midair; below them a group sits chatting on an outdoor deck. The sky is a brilliant blue and plants grow profusely in a hyper-modern city. In another painting, a bucolic earthly landscape carpets the rim of an enormous spinning torus. These images portray \u201creplica worlds with manicured nature and a neighborhood feel,\u201d the exhibition notes. And their character is \u201cinspired by the Bay Area.\u201d Outer space, we see, is a reflection of home.\n\nBut home, the exhibition suggests, also promises more troubling visions. Suspended from the ceiling are pieces of what seems to be an exploding space suit: \u201cFinding My Way Home 1\u201d (2010) by Tavares Strachan. The artist is said to be concerned with \u201cimbalances\u201d in the \u201ccolonization\u201d of space, and this work comments on a \u201cgap between the allure of space travel and historically disenfranchised communities.\u201d Another example, \u201cCosmorama\u201d (2018)\u2014a wall-size illuminated matrix of surreal images by the activist artistic group Design Earth\u2014means to evoke the \u201cenvironmental consequences\u201d of \u201chuman expansion into space.\u201d\n\nCristina de Middel\u2019s \u2018Umeko Suit\u2019 from the series \u2018The Afronauts\u2019 (2012) Photo: Cristina De Middel\n\nThese works see space as a reflection of a very different kind of home, a reflection the exhibition\u2014with its 78 artifacts ranging from NASA documents to eclectic film clips\u2014seems to endorse. But what is the nature of this contrast?\n\nIn part, the creators of this exhibition\u2014the museum\u2019s curator of architecture and design, Jennifer Dunlop Fletcher, and that department\u2019s associate curator, Joseph Becker \u2014celebrate the space program and its origins by showing the intimate relationship between real artifacts and those that were imagined. We see a \u201crefurbished\u201d space suit, for example, used by NASA in 1960 in the Mercury program next to others that are entirely fictional, including a \u201cClavius Base Space Suit\u201d designed by Stanley Kubrick and Harry Lange for the film \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey\u201d (1968). Similar juxtapositions occur throughout, mixing the actual (photographs of Neil Armstrong on the moon) with the imagined ( Roger Arno \u2019s 1980s drawings of an astronaut in a space station\u2019s \u201cLife Sciences Module\u201d).\n\nRick Guidice\u2019s \u2018Cylindrical Colonies, Interior View\u2019 (1976) Photo: NASA Ames Research Center History Archives\n\nIn many cases, we see, the achievements have grown out of fantasy. Science-fiction writers of the 20th century shaped the way outer space was approached and popular science followed, leading to practical programs and designs. One vitrine shows a series of articles (1952-54) from Collier\u2019s magazine called \u201cMan Will Conquer Space Soon,\u201d in which scientists and artists imagine journeys to the moon and Mars. By the 1970s, countercultural visionaries like Stewart Brand (his 1977 \u201cSpace Colonies\u201d is here) were imagining utopian communities in space.\n\nThe pursuit of outer space from the 1950s through the 1970s was connected, in fact, with expectations of expanded knowledge and possibility. And despite the occasional Bay Area-type misfires, the outer space that took shape in both imagination and reality reflected those expectations.\n\nRick Guidice\u2019s \u2018Bernal Spheres, Agricultural Modules in Cutaway View\u2019 (1976) Photo: NASA Ames Research Center History Archives\n\nThe more recent artifacts here are quite different. They really dismiss space as a realm offering new possibilities or human transformation (no wonder public interest has waned). Instead, earthly discontents as determined by political doctrine (e.g., \u201chistorically disenfranchised communities\u201d) are exported, colonizing space with alien concepts. This impulse also reflects this museum\u2019s preoccupations. Progressive-style questions confront the visitor from the moment of entry, inscribed on the museum\u2019s main staircase: \u201cAre race and class related? Who discriminates against you? Is race a feminist issue?\u201d\n\nThe result is that space becomes another realm in which identity-based grievances are nurtured and promoted, rather than one in which they might be left behind or transcended, or environmental issues overcome.\n\nTom Sachs\u2019s \u2018Mary's Suit\u2019 (2019) Photo: Tom Sachs/Genevieve Hanson\n\nThe exhibition also emphasizes its perspective by adding to the array of space suits something called an \u201cUmeko Suit\u201d made of puffy green cloth and a red-patterned kerchief. It was created by Cristina de Middel as part of a series of objects, images and texts she called \u201cThe Afronauts\u201d (2012), inspired by a bizarre project run by Edward Mukuka Nkoloso, a Zambian grade-school science teacher who believed that in 1964, under his leadership, Zambia could beat the U.S. and the Soviet Union to the moon. He trained 12 Zambian astronauts by rolling them down a hill inside an oil drum and teaching them to walk on their hands, asserting it would be \u201cthe only way humans can walk on the moon.\u201d\n\n\u2018Man Will Conquer Space Soon\u2019 Collier\u2019s cover (March 22, 1952) Photo: John Clayton\n\nWe are meant to view this escapade as a playful illustration of how space exploration has been tainted by exclusion of the \u201chistorically disenfranchised.\u201d But disenfranchisement is irrelevant. Instead we are reminded that what made the space program possible was the combination of imagination and knowledge, reflected in so many of the exhibition\u2019s other artifacts, along with the conviction that space may resemble home, but it also moves beyond it.\n\n\u2014Mr. Rothstein is the Journal\u2019s Critic at Large.", "description": "An exhibition at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art looks at the way imagination has shaped our quest for the stars, but also loads interstellar exploration with Earthbound troubles.", "authors": ["Edward Rothstein", "Edward.Rothstein Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104838/social", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
