(AP) - The pressure had been building all night for the Oakland Athletics. They knew Tampa Bay had won to pull even in the wild-card race, and had responded by stranding runner after runner.\n\nBut one swing of the bat by Matt Chapman was all the A\u2019s needed to release that stress and secure a vital win.\n\nChapman hit a two-run homer with one out in the ninth inning and the A\u2019s boosted their playoff chances, rallying past the Los Angeles Angels 3-2 on Wednesday night.\n\n\u201cBig time players show up like that,\u201d A\u2019s manager Bob Melvin said.\n\nOakland remained a half-game ahead of the Rays for the first AL wild-card spot. Cleveland fell two games behind the A\u2019s.\n\nRamon Laureano also homered for the A\u2019s, Joakim Soria (2-4) threw one inning of scoreless relief, and Liam Hendriks got his 24th save.\n\nChapman hit his 35th homer on the first pitch he saw from Hansel Robles (5-1). Marcus Semien started the comeback with a leadoff single, reaching second on an inadvertent sacrifice bunt by Laureano to set up Chapman\u2019s 436-foot shot to center. The A\u2019s had been 1 for 14 with runners in scoring position before Chapman connected, and the 26-year-old slugger counted himself among those feeling anxious as a result.\n\n\u201cAnd I was just, honestly, trying to get (Matt Olson) to the plate with an opportunity to win the game. I mean, he\u2019s been swinging the bat a little better than me,\u201d Chapman said. \u201cLuckily, was able to get a good pitch and do a little more than I expected.\u201d\n\nUntil Chapman\u2019s shot, one so obvious that center fielder Brian Goodwin did not move, it looked as if the A\u2019s would rue their numerous missed opportunities. Kaleb Cowart gave the Angels a 2-1 lead in the bottom of the seventh after Oakland had failed to go ahead in the top half when Mark Canha hit into a double play with the bases loaded.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t having trouble getting guys on base. We were just having trouble getting them in the last couple days, and sometimes you start to press a little bit as a group,\u201d Melvin said. \u201cA lot of times one swing of the bat ends up loosening everybody up, and certainly that was the key hit.\u201d\n\nTaylor Ward hit a solo homer, but the Angels lost seven of their final eight games to the A\u2019s. Ward put the Angels ahead in the second, and Laureano tied it at 1 in the fifth with his solo homer.\n\nChapman said everyone in the dugout knew about Tampa Bay\u2019s 4-0 win over the New York Yankees, which Melvin described as \u201cthe non-benefit of being on the West Coast.\u201d The way the A\u2019s responded to avoid their first three-game losing streak since July 24-26 gave Chapman confidence they will be able to focus on themselves during their final series against Seattle.\n\n\u201cWe just got to control what we can control, and to be able to have four games left and a half-game lead, we just got to keep taking care of our business and good things will happen,\u201d Chapman said.\n\nMORE THAN EXPECTED\n\nOakland right-hander Frankie Montas was effective in his return after serving an 80-game suspension for testing positive for a performance-enhancing substance, giving up one run in six innings. He allowed four hits and two walks, while striking out six. \u201cMaybe not his best command, but as the game went along, he worked it out,\u201d Melvin said. \u201cI did not expect six (innings) today, and it was a needed six.\u201d\n\nROSTER MOVE\n\nThe A\u2019s designated C Beau Taylor for assignment to create a roster spot for Montas. Taylor hit .174 with two RBIs in 10 games for Oakland.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nAthletics: Canha left the game in the seventh because of a groin strain. Melvin did not know the severity of the injury. . LF Khris Davis (stomach flu) did not play. . RF Stephen Piscotty (sprained ankle) took batting practice and ran the bases Wednesday. \u201cHe\u2019s getting better every day,\u201d Melvin said of Piscotty, who has not played since Aug. 24.\n\nAngels: CF Mike Trout expects to participate in his normal offseason routine after undergoing surgery to remove a Morton\u2019s neuroma from his right foot on Friday. Trout said he would likely need six weeks of recovery before being cleared for physical activity.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nAthletics: LHP Sean Manaea (3-0, 1.14 ERA) will start in the opener of a four-game series at Seattle on Thursday. Manaea has allowed three earned runs in 18 2/3 innings while winning each of his past three starts.\n\nAngels: RHP Jaime Barria (4-10) 6.43) gets the nod to start a four-game series against Houston on Thursday. Barria is 1-3 with a 4.34 ERA in six career games against the Astros.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The pressure had been building all night for the Oakland Athletics.
