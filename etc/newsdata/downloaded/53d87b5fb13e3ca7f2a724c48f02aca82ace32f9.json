U.S. companies also felt the failure. (Jagadeesh Nv/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\n\nThe team was gathered in a conference room last week, about 35 in all, ready to celebrate India\u2019s triumph: the country\u2019s first lunar landing. Like many watching the live-stream broadcast from the control center in Bangalore half a world away, John Thornton, the chief executive of Astrobotic, a Pittsburgh company that is developing a moon lander of its own, was confident India would stick it, setting off celebrations across the world.\n\nBut there was silence and long faces in India\u2019s mission control, not celebration, when they lost contact with the lunar craft, and there was silence, too, in Astrobotic\u2019s conference room, as Thornton\u2019s team was reminded that the difficulties of orbital mechanics and the vacuum of space are not to be taken for granted. \u201cEverything has to be working just right,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like humankind against space.\"\n\nSoon it will be their turn to attempt to land on the moon. Astrobotic is one of nine companies that NASA is betting on as part of a program to deliver science experiments to the surface of the moon. The list comprises small start-ups, like Thornton\u2019s venture, that grew out of Carnegie Mellon University, and industry stalwarts, such as Lockheed Martin and Draper, which provided navigation and guidance systems during the Apollo era.\n\n[Companies in the Cosmos: The new space race]\n\nNASA intends to invest $2.6 billion over 10 years in relatively small contracts \u2014 some under $100 million or so \u2014 for delivery services to the moon under a program called Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS). That\u2019s a small fraction of the estimated $20 billion to $30 billion it would spend on its Artemis program, designed to get humans to the moon\u2019s surface by 2024.\n\nUnder CLPS, NASA isn\u2019t designing, building or operating the landers that will make these lunar trips \u2014 that\u2019s all up to the companies. Instead, NASA is simply hiring them to provide a FedEx-like service to a lifeless celestial body 240,000 miles away. The plans even include sending a rover to the lunar south pole, a mission that could help NASA decide where its astronauts should land.\n\nThe endeavor is risky, the effort entrepreneurial, and failure is more than an option, NASA says: It\u2019s likely.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just how NASA wants it, as it tries to hit a cadence of two deliveries to the moon per year starting in 2021.\n\nNASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine likens the program to a venture capital fund investing in a start-up, where the upside is as high as the risk of failure. And some of the companies NASA is looking to are unconventional. One, Firefly, went bankrupt in 2016 when it lost a key investor. Another, Masten, has 12 employees and works out of a dusty barn in the Mojave Desert.\n\n[Listen: Moonrise, a Washington Post podcast that explores the real story behind the moonshot]\n\n\u201cThe idea is that it is low investment, high risk, which means some will fail,\u201d Bridenstine said in an interview. \u201cBut if one is successful, the returns to NASA and the returns to the United States of America will be significant.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, he told reporters: \u201cIt\u2019s important we get back to the moon as fast as possible. We\u2019re going to take shots on goal.\u201d\n\nAstrobotic plans its first moon mission in 2021. It would be the culmination of a long and unlikely odyssey. The company was co-founded in 2008 by a Carnegie Mellon University professor who recruited some of his current and former robotics students to join him in building a spacecraft for the Google Lunar X Prize, then a competition to get payloads to the moon.\n\nThe company was able to drum up money from angel investors and the university, but still it went through \u201cnearly two deaths,\u201d Thornton said. He took over as chief executive and refocused the company on trying to develop and market a commercial delivery service to the moon.\n\nThe idea was derided as fantasy, and as he was pitching Astrobotic to investors at a conference, there was \u201cone guy laughing the entire time,\u201d he recalled. \u201cAnd he wasn\u2019t laughing with me.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, however, NASA awarded it a $79.5 million contract, a big source of revenue for the small company that gave it a douse of credibility it hadn\u2019t had before. Last month, it chose its ride to the moon, signing a deal with the United Launch Alliance to launch its Peregrine lunar lander, which stands about 6 feet tall, on ULA\u2019s Vulcan Centaur rocket.\n\n\n\nAn artist's rendering of Astrobotic's Peregrine lunar lander, which the Pittsburgh company hopes to send to the moon in 2021 as part of a NASA program to send science experiments to the lunar surface.

It was a devastating outcome, but industry leaders and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was in the mission command center, vowed to learn from it and push on. \u201cIf at first you don\u2019t succeed, you try again,\u201d Netanyahu said.\n\nThen last week, India lost communication with its spacecraft as it descended toward the moon, a heartbreaking outcome for the country\u2019s space agency. It has since located the lander but has not established communication with it or released any details about its condition.\n\nIndia is also taking stock of its lunar ambitions. The lunar lander seemed to be on the right trajectory, but then in the final moments appeared to fall straight down, stunning the people packed in the space agency\u2019s control center. Afterward, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, \u201cOur determination to touch the moon has become even stronger.\u201d And he consoled a distraught K. Sivan, the head of the county\u2019s space agency, with an emotional embrace.\n\nIn a tweet, NASA encouraged the Indian space agency, saying, \u201cYou have inspired us with your journey.\u201d And it vowed to work to \u201cexplore our solar system together.\u201d\n\nThese were the first attempts by Israel and India to land on the surface of the moon, so failure may have been expected, as it was at the dawn of the Space Age, when countries treated the moon like a dartboard, crashing spacecraft into the lunar surface as if it were target practice.\n\nIn the 1960s, spacecraft like the Soviet Luna 2 and NASA\u2019s Ranger 7 plowed into the lunar surface routinely, as space agencies taught themselves how to hit another celestial body.\n\n[How to dress for space: Five iconic spacesuits in 3-D]\n\nFailed moon missions might have been politically acceptable when the United States was racing the Soviet Union in the Cold War space race. Today, however, there could be a backlash if NASA and its commercial partners can\u2019t successfully perform a feat that NASA first accomplished in the 1960s.\n\nThere may also be institutional resistance to adopting a Silicon Valley ethos \u2014 fail fast, iterate, try again \u2014 to a 60-year-old federal bureaucracy overseen by the U.S. Congress, a body not likely to rejoice at the prospect of expensive spacecraft careening into Earth\u2019s closest neighbor.\n\n\u201cIn reality, the question we\u2019ll have is how much tolerance will our political system have for failure?\u201d said Michael Neufeld, a senior curator at the National Air and Space Museum. \u201cDoes the taxpayer want to pay for stuff that\u2019s blowing up and crashing? It\u2019s a lot easier to talk about taking risk than it is to actually do it.\u201d\n\nIf India, which has one of the most robust space agencies in the world and successfully put a spacecraft in orbit around the moon in 2008, had troubles landing, how can a bunch of start-ups, some working out of glorified garages and relying on small government contracts and venture capital funds do it?\n\nThe answer, NASA says, is that the commercial space industry has come a long way, developing new technologies and taking on increasing responsibility for NASA. Two companies \u2014 Northrop Grumman and SpaceX \u2014 deliver cargo and supplies to the International Space Station, and another two, SpaceX and Boeing, are working to fly astronauts there.\n\nGiven the maturity in the industry, Steven Clarke, NASA\u2019s deputy associate administrator for exploration, said he is confident that private industry is ready to take on the moon, even if some of the companies in the program have never flown anything to space before.\n\nThe \u201cstrengths of the commercial industry have come up and matured, and so we\u2019re willing to take additional risk with them,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\nBut while NASA says it\u2019s willing to tolerate a certain amount of failure, the companies involved say their goal is to succeed. They want to have not just NASA as a customer but also to ultimately build a commercial business flying science experiments and payloads to the lunar surface.\n\n\u201cFor us, success is of the utmost importance,\u201d Thornton said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019re out there taking unreasonable risk. That does not work for our business plan. The one who will lead in this market five years from now is the one who has successful flights.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Christian Davenport", "Reporter Covering The Defense", "Space Industries", "September At Pm", "Christian Davenport Covers The Defense", "Space Industries For The Washington Post'S Financial Desk.
