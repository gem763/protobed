Himes), a divided panel of the Sixth Circuit barred the state of Ohio from enforcing its law that prohibits medical providers from performing an abortion if they have \u201cknowledge that the pregnant woman is seeking the abortion, in whole or in part, because\u201d her baby has been diagnosed as having Down syndrome.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn her majority opinion (joined by chief judge Guy Cole), Judge Bernice Bouie Donald declared that the Roe/Casey regime confers a \u201ccategorical\u201d right to abortion before viability. (Donald was appointed by President Obama, Cole by President Clinton.)\n\nIn her dissent, Judge Alice Batchelder (an appointee of President George H.W. Bush) argued that the undue-burden analysis under Casey instead requires a \u201cfact-intensive\u201d inquiry that also takes into account \u201cthe State\u2019s interests and the benefits of the law, not just the potential burden it places on women seeking an abortion.\u201d Having failed to conduct that inquiry, the majority and the district court had no basis for enjoining the law.\n\nBatchelder further pointed out that the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Gonzales v. Carhart (2007) allowed the federal ban on partial-birth abortion to apply before viability. She also invoked Justice Thomas\u2019s observations (from his forceful concurring opinion last spring in Box v. Planned Parenthood) that laws like Ohio\u2019s \u201cpromote a State\u2019s compelling interest in preventing abortion from becoming a tool of modern-day eugenics\u201d and that the Court\u2019s abortion rulings do not require states \u201cto allow eugenic abortions.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m pleased to see that the state of Ohio has today filed a petition for rehearing en banc. The petition argues that the panel majority erred when it concluded that there is a \u201ccategorical\u201d right to a pre-viability abortion: \u201cIndeed, Casey itself upheld a law prohibiting minors from getting abortions without parental consent or court approval\u2014that is, a law that banned those who could obtain neither consent nor court approval from getting an abortion.\u201d The petition also emphasizes the \u201ctwo critically important state interests\u201d that the law advances:\n\nFirst, anti-eugenics laws protect the dignity of people living with conditions or traits targeted for abortion.\u2026 The practice of targeting unborn children with Down syndrome for abortion devalues the lives of people living with Down syndrome. Second, anti-eugenics laws are necessary because eugenic abortions \u201cdo deep damage to the integrity of the medical profession.\u201d [Quoting Batchelder dissent.] Humans are not show dogs or racehorses.\u2026 Every human life matters\u2014certainly the people of Ohio may enact laws reflecting that view\u2014and the medical profession [which \u201cactively promoted eugenic \u2018solutions\u2019\u201d in the early 20th century] must never again be associated with a contrary view.", "description": "Two weeks ago (in Preterm Cleveland v.
