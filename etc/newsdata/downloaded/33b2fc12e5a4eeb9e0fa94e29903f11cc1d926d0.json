The Houthis have also claimed credit for drone attacks on Saudi pipelines, tankers and other infrastructure during a four-year war.\n\nOn Saturday morning, Saudi officials were investigating attacks on Aramco\u2019s facility at Abqaiq in the kingdom\u2019s Eastern Province and another at the Hijra Khurais oil field, the interior ministry said in a tweet.\n\nSaudi Arabian Oil Co., or the national firm better known as Aramco, describes the Abqaiq oil-processing facility as the largest crude-oil stabilization plant in the world. Khurais is the home of the country\u2019s second-largest oil field.\n\nSaudi officials with knowledge of the attack described a confusing, still unfolding set of circumstances. The officials said multiple drones attacked the facilities.\n\nOne Aramco executive said Aramco compounds, where workers live, had been evacuated.\n\nThe Saudi interior ministry said the fires were under control. Published images of the fire at the Abqaiq facility showed what appeared to be a huge blaze along with plumes of smoke.\n\nThe Saudi government didn\u2019t say who was behind the attack. There were no immediate reports of casualties.\n\nThe Houthis took control of Yemen\u2019s capital, Sana\u2019a, in 2014 during a civil war. Since then, a Saudi-led coalition has fought a war to unseat the Houthis and reinstate a government supported by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and other regional powers.\n\nSaudi Arabia and the U.S. say the Houthis are financed and armed by Iran, a charge that Tehran denies.\n\nDrone and missiles launched by the Houthis have repeatedly struck inside Saudi Arabia in recent months, hitting airports and other civilian installations. At least one drone strike was launched from neighboring Iraq, according to U.S. officials.\n\nSaudi and American officials have blamed Iran for targeting the kingdom\u2019s oil infrastructure, including the use of mines to damage Saudi oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman in May.\n\nIran has denied striking Saudi targets or coordinating with Yemeni rebels to hit the kingdom\u2019s oil equipment.\n\nDisruptions in Saudi oil production could have ripple effects through the global economy, as the kingdom exports more crude petroleum than any other country.\n\nSaudi officials have called for the international community to help protect its oil infrastructure.\n\nRecently reimposed U.S. sanctions on Tehran have crippled its oil industry and sent its economy into a tailspin, raising fears of a broader conflict in the Middle East. The U.S. action came after President Trump pulled out of a 2015 international deal to curb Iran\u2019s nuclear program, saying it didn\u2019t go far enough to rein in Tehran\u2019s regional ambitions.\n\nWrite to Jared Malsin at jared.malsin@wsj.com and Summer Said at summer.said@wsj.com", "description": "Drone strikes caused fires at two facilities of Saudi Arabia\u2019s state oil company, marking the latest in a series of attacks on the country\u2019s petroleum assets in recent months.", "authors": ["Jared Malsin", "Summer Said", "Jared.Malsin Wsj.Com", "Summer.Said Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107229/social", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
