It was unclear whether some protesters would still demonstrate on their own.\n\nThe police commander of Hong Kong island, Kwok Pak Chung, appealed to people to stay away from any non-authorized rallies, warning that those caught could face a five-year jail term.\n\nHe told a daily news conference that he was aware of social media messages urging people to take strolls or hold rallies in the name of religion. Kwok urged the public to \u201cmake a clear break with all acts of violence and stay away from locations where violent clashes may take place.\u201d\n\nLILLIAN SUWANRUMPHA via Getty Images People take part in a #MeToo rally in Hong Kong on August 28, 2019, to protest alleged sexual assaults by police against anti-government female protesters.

They also are arresting people for protests earlier this summer, a step they said was a natural development as investigations were completed.\n\nAndy Chan, the leader of a pro-independence movement, was arrested at the airport Thursday night under suspicion of rioting and attacking police. Three other protesters were taken in earlier this week for alleged involvement in the storming of the legislative building on July 1, when protesters broke in and vandalized the main chamber.\n\nA leader of the Civil Human Rights Front, which had called Saturday\u2019s march, said that Hong Kong residents would have to think about other ways to voice their anger if the police keep banning protests.\n\n\u201cThe first priority of the Civil Human Rights Front is to make sure that all of the participants who participate in our marches will be physically and legally safe. That\u2019s our first priority,\u201d said Bonnie Leung. \u201cAnd because of the decision made by the appeal board, we feel very sorry but we have no choice but to cancel the march.\u201d\n\nPolice arrested Wong and Agnes Chow on Friday morning, both 22 and members of pro-democracy group Demosisto.\n\nWong, one of the student leaders of the Umbrella Movement in 2014, was released from prison in June after serving a two-month sentence related to that major pro-democracy protest. He has been speaking out regularly in support of the pro-democracy protests that have racked Hong Kong this summer.\n\nThey were later charged with participating in and inciting others to join an unauthorized protest outside a police station on June 21. Wong was also charged with organizing it.\n\n\u201cWe will continue our fight no matter how they arrest and prosecute us,\u201d Wong told reporters outside a courthouse after they were released on bail.\n\nSOPA Images via Getty Images HONG KONG, CHINA - 2019/08/24: A protester drums in front of a wall with graffiti during the demonstration.

It later said Chow had also been arrested, at her home.\n\nChow echoed Wong\u2019s comments, saying \u201cWe Hong Kong people won\u2019t give up and won\u2019t be scared ... we will keep fighting for democracy.\u201d\n\n(Associated Press writers Yanan Wang in Beijing and Eileen Ng in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and videojouranalist Johnson Lai in Hong Kong contributed to this story.)", "description": "Members of a pro-democracy group were granted bail Friday, but authorities in Hong Kong are continuing their ban on non-authorized rallies.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d692544250000710a74fdf1.jpeg?cache=cocf9beq1t&ops=1778_1000"}
