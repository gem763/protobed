(AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File\n\nAs the threat of impeachment looms, President Donald Trump is digging in and taking solace in the base that helped him get elected: conservative evangelical Christians who laud his commitment to enacting their agenda.\n\nTrump told reporters last week that \"the biggest pastors\" have assured him that Christians are \"electrified\" by his clash with Democrats who are probing his pushes for Ukraine to launch an investigation into a political rival, former Democratic Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nAnd the prominent evangelicals who have proven Trump's most stalwart allies are staying in his corner for the impeachment fight, even as some push back against his withdrawal of U.S. troops from northern Syria \u2014 a move that imperils scores of Kurdish Muslims and Christians in the region. Although Trump's Syria pullback is alarming conservative Christians whose support he needs to win reelection, their rallying against his impeachment indicates a bond that appears strong enough to withstand the current foreign policy rift as 2020 balloting nears.\n\nSouth Carolina pastor and televangelist Rev. Mark Burns, a backer since the early days of Trump's 2016 campaign, said in an interview that \"it's important that religious leaders reach out to the president.\" Burns contended that Trump's struggles are partly connected to his Christian faith, adding that \"Satan wants to remove a vessel that God has installed to again be a blessing to the religious community.\"\n\nBurns said he spoke with Trump briefly last week, when the president met with black conservatives at the White House, and recalled hearing the Holy Spirit \"as I crossed the street to walk into Trump Tower\" for their first meeting in 2015. Maryland-based Pentecostal Bishop Harry Jackson, who has met with Trump at the White House, said that he plans to hold a large prayer gathering this year for \"healing in the nation.\"\n\nBut it's not clear whether Trump is seeking or receiving the religious solace that former President Bill Clinton sought as his own impeachment plight intensified two decades ago. Clinton named two progressive pastors to provide spiritual reprieve in 1998, as an extramarital affair earlier in his presidency metastasized into national scandal.\n\nThe current president has no religious leaders in such a defined role, though he gets frequent backup from Southern Baptist megachurch pastor Robert Jeffress \u2014 who warned of \"a civil war like fracture\" from removing Trump \u2014 and Rev. Franklin Graham. The son of the late Rev. Billy Graham has denounced the impeachment investigation but this week asked followers to \"pray w/me\" that Trump would reconsider his ceding of Syrian territory to Turkey.\n\nAnother evangelical Trump ally who has defended Trump's Syria withdrawal, Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr., said in an interview that he and the president are in regular communication but described himself as \"not a spiritual adviser, not a counselor. I'm just his friend.\" Falwell Jr.'s wife Becki said she also maintains a friendly, mutually supportive text-message conversation with First Lady Melania Trump.\n\nRev. Tony Suarez, who joined Trump's evangelical advisory board during the 2016 campaign, said that he and the president did not talk impeachment when he last visited the White House two weeks ago. If he'd had the chance, Suarez said, he would offer to pray with Trump, just as \"I would offer to pray with anyone who was going through a trying period in their life.\"\n\nThe Democratic impeachment inquiry deals with Trump's bid to get Ukrainian authorities looking into unfounded corruption allegations against Joe Biden, a top rival in the 2020 election, and his son, Hunter. Biden's son served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company while the former vice president steered U.S. policy toward Kyiv.\n\nNo evidence has emerged to support Trump's charges of improper behavior by the Bidens. But Suarez, the executive vice president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference, and other pro-Trump evangelicals dismissed the impeachment investigation as a politically motivated effort by Democrats to undercut the president.\n\nAs Trump celebrates their support, with plans to address religious conservatives on Saturday at the Values Voter Summit in Washington, dozens of other pastors are aligning to support the impeachment inquiry with a day of prayer on Sunday.", "description": "As the threat of impeachment looms, President Donald Trump is digging in and taking solace in the base that helped him get elected: conservative evangelical Christians who laud his commitment to enacting their agenda.
