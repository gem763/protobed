As the company\u2019s fifth employee and 95th user of the app in 2011, she was in on the ground floor of the tech giant a year after its launch, advising users on best practices that are now ingrained in social media\u2019s DNA. Naturally, scores of followers flocked to her account.\n\nA photographer by trade, Zollman, 34, soon found herself swimming in opportunities for commercial work. So she left Instagram in 2013 and joined a photo and advertising agency, where she became a roving photographer shooting on behalf of brands and endorsing products with the occasional #sponsored post.\n\nHer newfound Insta-fame quickly earned her a ride on a \u201cbeautiful, mysterious train, making a really, really impressive amount of money\u201d as an influencer, she says. But four years later, the train had sputtered to a halt, leaving her scrambling financially.\n\n\u201cMarket saturation happened,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople started noticing how lucrative doing that kind of work was, and so there became this new goal of becoming the influencer.\u201d Brands weren\u2019t paying as much because people would work for less \u2013 or even for free. \u201cI had to lower my day rate. I had to work twice as hard for twice as less,\u201d she says.", "description": "The influencer lifestyle can look amazing, but uncertain incomes, performative vulnerability and the hustle for sponsorship can take a toll.
