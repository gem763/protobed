Namibia-Canada match, which had no bearing on the rest of the tournament with both sides out of contention for the quarter-finals, will be recorded as a draw. It is only the third World Cup match to have been cancelled.\n\nTwo of Saturday's matches, the Pool C decider between England and France and the Pool B match between world champions New Zealand and Italy, were scratched on Thursday when it became clear the typhoon would make landfall in central Honshu.\n\nOrganisers later confirmed the Pool C match between the United States and Tonga in Osaka and Wales's final Pool D match against Uruguay in Kumamoto would go ahead as scheduled on Sunday.\n\nThere will be an inspection of conditions at Yokohama International Stadium on Sunday morning before a call is made on whether or not to play the final match of the day, organisers said.\n\nJapan's Pool A clash with Scotland will decide which of the two teams reaches the quarter-finals. If it is cancelled, the host nation will progress.\n\nTicket holders to all cancelled matches will be entitled to a full face-value refund.", "description": "UPDATE 2-Rugby-Namibia v Canada World Cup match cancelled after typhoon", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/Brazil-Stock-Market_3_800x533_L_1414427437.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
