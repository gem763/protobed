Oprah Winfrey, Spike Lee, Cicely Tyson, Samuel L. Jackson, Halle Berry and others all helped Perry christen his new facility, a 330-acre (134-hectare) studio that once served as a Confederate army base.\n\nWinfrey praised Perry and told the AP the new studio head is a force to be reckoned with.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t wait for other people to validate or to say you should go this way or that way. He said I\u2019m going to create my own way and as we can see here, become a force for himself,\u201d Winfrey said.\n\n\u201cI remember when he was thinking about buying this place and I said \u2018You\u2019d be crazy not to take it.\u2019\u201d she added.\n\nSamuel L. Jackson pointed to Perry\u2019s vision as the key to his ascent.\n\n\u201cThis is more about Tyler the entrepreneur. The visionary. A guy who understands that ownership means that you can do what you want,\u201d Jackson said as he paused along the red carpet.\n\nTyler Perry Studios has 12 soundstages, each named after seminal black actors and actresses.\n\n____\n\nFollow AP Writer Ron Harris on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Journorati\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Tyler Perry officially christened his massive new film studio Saturday, beaming as his fellow entertainment industry luminaries descended on Atlanta and strode a red carpet to his sprawling complex for an opening gala.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ron Harris"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/05/grand_opening_of_tyler_perry_studios_19018_c0-125-3000-1874_s1770x1032.jpg?f52fad753beb582a85b1710fc9f6c2ec1ddbd99f", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
