In the clip, the decapitated victim also claims to be the brother of Juan Carlos M\u00e1rquez P\u00e9rez, a.k.a. \u201cEl Duende\u201d (The Goblin), a CJNG operative arrested back in 2015.\n\nIn a separate incident on Tuesday of last week, two more severed heads were found in a cooler at a television station in the nearby city of Guadalajara. The heads were accompanied by a note signed by the CJNG and addressed to a high-ranking police officer. Another cartel cooler was left at the federal courthouse building that same day, but officials refused to disclose the contents.\n\nMexican mafiosos appear to have borrowed the practice of beheading their enemies from Middle Eastern terrorists such as Al Qaeda and the Islamic State (ISIS). Decapitations in Mexico have risen dramatically over the last several years due to their perceived shock factor. Head cutting has become the signature move for crime groups looking to intimidate opposing factions, pressure law enforcement, and cow local citizens.\n\nThere have been dozens of beheadings by the cartels in 2017, which is on pace to be the bloodiest year in the country\u2019s decade-long Drug War. (October, the latest month for which there are statistics, saw the homicide rate rise to an average of almost 90 murders per day.)\n\nOne recent, high-profile decapitation case involved the discovery of two heads\u2014and fourteen additional dead bodies\u2014in the popular resort area of Los Cabos, Baja California Sur, last June. In another incident, the freshly removed cabezas of two men and a woman were found inside decorative sombreros during the run-up to the nation\u2019s Independence Day in Veracruz state.\n\nHeads for Tales\n\nLast week\u2019s brutal decollation video was filmed in the scorching valley called Tierra Caliente (The Hot Lands). Located smack in the middle of the troubled state of Michoac\u00e1n, the Hot Lands are claimed by both the home-grown Viagras cartel and the invading CJNG from neighboring Jalisco state.\n\nThe valley and surrounding mountains are home to large-scale drug production and shipping zones, and the local timber and mining industries provide lucrative sources for extortion, making Tierra Caliente a prize worth fighting over for both crime syndicates.\n\nIn a 2016 interview Viagras leader Nicol\u00e1s \u201cEl Gordo\u201d (The Fat One) Sierra admitted his outfit was \u201cfighting a crusade\u201d against the CJNG, which is now reported to be Mexico\u2019s largest cartel. According to experts, the recent video segment could indicate the gang from Jalisco might have Sierra and his sicarios (hitmen) on the ropes.\n\n\u201cThis execution video is definitely out of character for the Viagras and appears to be an escalation in their use of violence [against] the CJNG cartel,\u201d said security analyst Robert Bunker, who teaches at the U.S. Army War College, in an interview.\n\n\u201cA safe guess would be that their fight with CJNG may not be going well and they see the need to \u2018ramp up the terror\u2019 against that group in order to better protect their territories and illicit interests,\u201d Bunker said.\n\nGustavo Fondevila, a professor who specializes in organized crime at Mexico City\u2019s Center for Economic Research and Teaching, said such \u201ctrophy killings\u201d are often aimed at controlling the black-market economy.\n\n\u201cBeheading captured members of a rival cartel has a direct effect on the [black] market,\u201d said Fondevila, who went on to call decapitation a \u201ctechnique of conquest\u201d aimed at a given geographic region.\n\n\u201cThe rationale of the beheadings, abuse, and torture [ . . .] is to persuade the other [cartel] to leave a place, give up, or surrender without using weapons. It\u2019s a relatively inexpensive way to win and take the market.\u201d\n\nThe method used to decollate the CJNG footsoldier in the Viagras\u2019 video post, and the way it was filmed, combine to tell a menacing tale about the motive and mindset of those involved.\n\n\u201cBeheadings where the victim is kneeling or thrown on the ground with the head lifted up to expose the neck and then beheaded beginning with a throat cut are a visceral and bloody type of execution,\u201d said Bunker, author of the book Narcoterrorism and Impunity in the Americas .\n\n\u201cThey really portray a sense of the victim\u2019s heightened terror to the viewing audience as the terrorist or cartel enforcer begins working on them with a large knife,\u201d Bunker said. \u201cA shooting or stabbing execution just doesn\u2019t have the same horror.\u201d\n\nOfficers Implicated?\n\nIn case anyone missed the point of the multiple head-lopping demonstrations that occurred in western Mexico last week, the respective killers also included textual aids.\n\nA crawl along the bottom of the Tierra Caliente video specifically addresses the CJNG and its leader, Rub\u00e9n \u201cEl Mencho\u201d Cervantes, for whose capture the U.S. Justice Department is currently offering a six million dollar reward.\n\n\u201cFeatherless chickens,\u201d the message reads in part, \u201cIf you want to interfere here you will end up like this [beheaded victim]. This plaza (drug trafficking zone) has an owner. Michoac\u00e1n is ours.\u201d\n\nAnother individual mentioned by name in the video\u2019s subtitles is former state police officer Pepe M\u00e9ndez. After admitting on camera to killing and dismembering two people, the captive Marqu\u00e9z brother (whose first name has not yet been released) says he and his cartel cohorts received financial support from M\u00e9ndez, who is now serving time for narcotics trafficking.\n\nThe soon-to-be-headless CJNG hitman also claims to have conspired with a \u201cmilitar\u201d (soldier) with the 43rd Battalion of the Mexican Army, currently stationed in the nearby market town of Apatzing\u00e1n.\n\nThe heads delivered to the broadcasting center in Guadalajara also came with written hints that pointed to collusion between organized crime and security forces. The note found with the cooler was addressed to Jes\u00fas Humberto Boruel Neri, the Inspector General of the Jalisco police, and was intended as an open warning, according to the Mexican newspaper El Processo.\n\n\u201cYou know that the deals are [to be] fulfilled or you want [us] to remind you why you are in this role and who put you there,\u201d read the message from the CJNG.\n\n\u201cMexican [security] personnel cooperating with the cartels is nothing new\u2014it has literally been going on for over a decade now and is pretty much due to human greed,\u201d said Bunker.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the dilemmas faced by the Mexican government,\u201d he added. Security forces \u201chave in the past been known to provide information to the cartels, allow drug loads to pass through and even provide security for them, and handed over prisoners belonging to one cartel to an opposing one for execution purposes.\u201d\n\nThe heightened frequency of cartel execution via head-chopping is no coincidence. Fragmentation of established cartels has caused conflict between newer crime groups to grow ever more ferocious. Warring capos have in turn come to rely on decapitation as a tool of psychological warfare aimed at breaking the will of their opponents.\n\n\u201cThe [beheading] technique is quite similar to ISIS and has a long tradition in military combat as a strategy to terrorize the enemy,\u201d said analyst Fondevila, who explained that the humbling admissions of guilt wrung from the hitman M\u00e1rquez as he was brought to the block were likely just for show.\n\n\u201c It should not be seen as a punishment,\u201d he said, \u201cbut rather as a message to others.\u201d\n\nHow that message will be received by rival cartels, or by the superiors of those officials accused of colluding with them, is anybody\u2019s guess.", "description": "One of at least three decapitations last week was caught on camera as cartel violence continues to soar.", "authors": ["Jeremy Kryt"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_832,w_1480,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1512313855/171202-kryt-decapitation-lede_gzvvz0_wud7ad", "published_at": "2017-12-03"}
