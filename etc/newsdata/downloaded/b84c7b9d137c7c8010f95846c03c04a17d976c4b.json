Now, it's available for tourists, too.\n\nCNBC went to Tokyo, where the robot is available for rental at Haneda Airport. RoBoHoN costs about $12 per day, with marginal discounts for longer rentals.\n\nWhile Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri focuses on giving you information, such as providing weather data and news, RoBoHoN, manufactured by Sharp, is made to be a companion to you.\n\nThis spiffy robot is outfitted with GPS and can track your whereabouts on your trip. Based on that, it can propose ideas on what to do, depending on where you are.\n\nFor example, when it was near the area of Roppongi, it suggested that this CNBC reporter goes to the Maman Spider Sculpture nearby to take an \"artistic photo.\" While walking near Tokyo Station, it began talking about the recent renovations made to the railway station.\n\nAnd no fear if you are alone, this helpful companion can also take photos for you, and even dance on command.", "description": "Sharp\u2019s humanoid robot, RoBoHoN wants to be a companion for humans in Japan.
