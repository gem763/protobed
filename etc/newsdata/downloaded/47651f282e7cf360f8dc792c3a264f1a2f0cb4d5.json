Per mortgage-finance company Freddie Mac, the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage declined to the lowest level since October 2016 to 3.49% for the week ended Sep 5 from the previous week of 3.58%. It fell considerably from a high of around 4.5% at the start of this year. The 15-year average rate dropped to 3% from last week\u2019s 3.06%.\n\n\n\nAt the current average rate, the monthly payment on a $300,000, 30-year loan would be $1,345. This is down from $1,527 a year ago, when the rate was 4.54%.\n\n\n\nThe decline came on the heels of slowdown in global growth and the recession fears sparked by the bond market. The trend is likely to persist this year given the Fed\u2019s first rate cut in more than a decade and the prospect of further cuts this year. Many analysts expect the Fed to lower interest rates by 25 basis points (bps) again when it meets later this month (read: Housing ETFs & Stocks to Buy on Likely September Rate Cut).\n\n\n\nThe low interest rate environment has led to strong optimism for homebuilders and real estate sectors, pushing stocks higher. This is because lower rates have made buying of real estate or homes and refinancing mortgages more affordable. This, in turn, boosts activity in the market, and is lifting homebuilder and real estate stocks.\n\n\n\nThough global growth is slowing down due to trade disputes, the United States\u2019 economic fundamentals are still solid. The unemployment rate is low, housing affordability is improving, homebuyer demand is rising, refinancing is booming, home price growth is stable and consumer confidence at multi-year high (read: ETFs to Buy as Americans' Confidence Nears 19-Year High).\n\n\n\nHow to Play\n\n\n\nGiven the plunging rates, investors seeking to tap the two spaces could look at the following ETFs that hit highs in the recent session and could be more compelling picks rather than a single stock. These products erase company-specific risks and provide a higher level of diversification while reducing volatility. All these ETFs have a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting room for more upside in the coming weeks.\n\n\n\niShares U.S. Home Construction ETF ITB\n\n\n\nThis fund provides exposure to U.S. companies that manufacture residential homes by tracking the Dow Jones U.S. Select Home Construction Index.
