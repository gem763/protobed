It\u2019s hard to turn on the TV these days without seeing another ad for a blood pressure medication. And many doctors treat these drugs as the catch-all, cure-all for anyone with high blood pressure and the associated cardiovascular risks. Don\u2019t believe it. There are healthier, safer ways to deal with high blood pressure. In this case, drugs are almost never the answer.\n\nWhat is high blood pressure?\n\nWhy is it dangerous?\n\nDrugs and Medications: Not the Answer\n\nWith every heartbeat, blood flows from your heart to the rest of your body through your arteries. Blood pressure is the force of that blood pushing against your artery walls. Blood pressure is at its highest during a beat. This is called systolic pressure. In between beats, when the heart is at rest, pressure falls. This is your diastolic pressure. These two numbers make up your blood pressure reading, expressed as systolic over diastolic (for example, 120/80 mmHg). Your blood pressure normally rises and falls throughout the day. If it stays high for too long, though, the constant force on your arteries can create microscopic tears. These tears can turn into scar tissue, providing the perfect lodging place for fat, cholesterol, and other particles\u2014collectively called plaque. Buildup of plaque narrows the arteries, which requires your heart to work extra hard to push blood through. This can ultimately result in heart disease, stroke, hardened arteries (atherosclerosis), kidney damage, and various other problems. By and large, hypertension is a lifestyle disease. Don\u2019t get me wrong\u2026there are factors you can\u2019t control, such as genetics, age, and race (African Americans have higher risk). But for the most part, you can blame bad diet, lack of exercise, poor sleep habits, uncontrolled stress, smoking, excessive drinking, and obesity. Considering half the nation is either overweight or obese, the rise in blood pressure among 20- and 30-somethings makes perfect sense.No matter your age, race, or sex, untreated hypertension is a ticking time bomb. Most people experience no symptoms, so you may have high blood pressure and not know it. Eventually, it will hurt you\u2026possibly even kill you. This is why you have to treat it right away. Like so many diseases, the pharmaceutical industry has turned hypertension into a condition that can be managed by taking pills, rather than cured through lifestyle changes. Common blood pressure medications don\u2019t solve the root causes of hypertension and have terrible side effects (including dizziness, headaches, fatigue, sexual dysfunction, and heart arrhythmia). Not worth it, in my opinion. Especially when you can lower your blood pressure naturally and without side effects.Wouldn\u2019t it be easier to take blood-pressure-lowering medication? Sure, but there\u2019s a major trade-off. As I\u2019ve mentioned before, it\u2019s important to review all possible side effects before starting any medication, and blood pressure drugs are no exception. Diuretics (drugs that increase urination to flush water from the body) and medicines that reduce blood pressure have powerful side effects. Light-headedness, which increases the risk of falling, is just one. High blood sugar, brain shrinkage, and a sluggish metabolism are a few of the others. Then there\u2019s the depletion of B vitamins, essential for a healthy nervous system. And a reduction of other vitally important minerals can cause dizziness. Furthermore, several large, respected studies show that individuals with mild to moderate elevations in blood pressure who avoid prescription drugs fare better in terms of heart attacks than those who take drugs. Personally, I think choosing a low-sodium diet over these potentially serious side effects is a no-brainer. Also, keep in mind that some medications increase blood pressure. These include certain antidepressants, anti-anxiety drugs, and even non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen. If this could be a problem for you, discuss the possibility of switching to a different drug with your physician.\n\nWhy is high blood pressure on the rise?\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt, high blood pressure is a huge, growing problem in America. I see it in my patients all the time. And there are three main reasons we\u2019re seeing an uptick in blood pressure problems\u2014none of which is an absence of drugs.Americans are eating more and more salt-laden packaged foods. And that\u2019s hurting our hearts. Eating too much sodium, most of which enters our diet as salt, wrecks the body\u2019s balance. Extra sodium in your blood interferes with your kidney\u2019s ability to draw water out of your blood\u2014leading to that bloated feeling you get after a salty meal. Think about that bloating inside your body\u2014it creates pressure. And up goes your blood pressure. And you\u2019d be shocked by how much salt is in processed foods\u2014even those you wouldn\u2019t think of. A plain medium bagel, for instance, has 430 mg of salt\u2014almost 20% of your recommended daily intake. Four pancakes have 730 mg of salt. A slice of white bread has 240 mg, and even a cup of cottage cheese contains 819 mg of salt! Those aren\u2019t foods you think of as salty\u2014but they are. Since salt is a natural preservative, you\u2019ll find it in high quantities in anything that isn\u2019t sold fresh. But salt isn\u2019t the only danger packaged foods bring. Bisphenol A\u2014BPA \u2014is a chemical used in making plastics, cans, and a variety of other containers. Many of which are used for food. And one study found that 92% of Americans have BPA in their blood. Little wonder, since it\u2019s been found in our food too\u2014things like canned soups or canned green beans. The problem with that? BPA mimics estrogen in your body\u2014and estrogen plays an important role in regulating blood pressure. So all that BPA is driving America\u2019s numbers up. That\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg with BPA, but it\u2019s a very important tip.So many of my patients complain to me about feeling overwhelmed. By everything. The modern world is constantly vying for your attention from eighteen different places. Since the Great Recession, most of my patients tell me how worried they are about their jobs, their finances. All this pressure creates stress. Stress creates cortisol. And cortisol is a hormone that controls blood pressure. More stress equals higher readings.45% of Americans report not getting enough sleep over the previous week. 35% say the sleep they do get isn\u2019t any good. And when you don\u2019t sleep enough, your body doesn\u2019t regulate your stress hormones properly. That is part of the reason you feel bad and are more irritable when you don\u2019t get proper sleep. But lack of sleep also causes your blood pressure to rise\n\nNatural Remedies to High Blood Pressure\n\nBe your own doctor\n\nSteps to Successful At-Home Monitoring\n\nBuy an automatic monitor that goes around your upper arm (as opposed to your wrist or finger), and make sure the cuff fits properly. (Insurance may fully or partially cover a monitor; check with your provider.)\n\nBefore your first use, have your doctor or nurse check to make sure you are using it properly. Also test your monitor\u2019s accuracy by having your doctor take a reading, then do a self-reading.\n\nTake your blood pressure twice a day\u2014morning and evening. At each reading, take two to three measurements (spaced about one minute apart) to make sure they are similar.\n\nThirty minutes prior to measuring, avoid caffeine, alcohol, tobacco, and exercise. Also be sure you have an empty bladder.\n\nPosition your left arm properly by resting it on the table or chair arm at heart level. Place the cuff on your bare skin, not on top of clothing.\n\nDon\u2019t talk or think about stressful situations during the readings.\n\nIf your monitor doesn\u2019t record your readings automatically, be sure to log them.\n\nSit quietly and calmly for at least three to four minutes beforehand. Make sure to leave your legs and ankles uncrossed before and during the reading.\n\nThere are many ways to keep your blood pressure in check. One of the most important is performing your own blood pressure monitoring.Having an accurate account of your blood pressure over time is the first line of defense in preventing heart attack, stroke, and even death. And the only way to accomplish that is to monitor your blood pressure at home. The conclusion of a late 2014 study says it all: Clinical blood pressure measurements alone are not specific or sensitive enough to be used as the main tool in diagnosing or treating hypertension. Another study found that home monitoring helps confirm cases of white coat syndrome and masked hypertension (the opposite of white coat, when readings in clinical settings are normal, but high elsewhere). Home monitoring is also a better predictor of potential heart issues. The researchers stated that home blood pressure monitoring should have a primary role in diagnosis and treatment of hypertension. Why? Well, having your blood pressure taken at your doctor\u2019s office is merely a snapshot of what\u2019s going on in your arteries at that very specific moment in time. But home monitoring provides a longer-term view and offers a much clearer picture of your blood pressure fluctuations over time.I recommend home monitoring to all my patients who have (or are at risk for) high blood pressure and heart disease. That way they can gauge how effectively their prevention or treatment program is working. I even tell people who have perfectly normal blood pressure that it doesn\u2019t hurt to measure themselves every once in a while. (You can usually do this at your local pharmacy.) Knowing where you stand puts you in much greater control of your health. Here are some tips to assure the most accurate readings at home.\n\nLifestyle Changes: The Most Effective Medication\n\nI\u2019ve lost count of how many patients have been able to successfully wean themselves off of their blood pressure medications\u2014and more importantly, get their blood pressure totally under control\u2014with these natural remedies for high blood pressure. Some are simpler than others, but they\u2019re all equally important.Quit smoking, and drink only occasionally and in moderation. And be sure you\u2019re getting plenty of sleep \u2014at least seven to eight hours a night.Water thins the blood, helping it flow more freely. Aim for a half-ounce of water for every pound you weigh. So if you weigh 160 pounds, you would drink 80 ounces of water, or 10 eight-ounce glasses per day. (Soda, juice, coffee, and other caffeinated or sugary drinks do not count toward this total!)Focus on whole, fresh foods, including lean meats and poultry, organic fruits and vegetables, unsalted nuts and seeds, legumes, whole grains, some low-fat dairy (or alternatives such as almond or rice milk), and healthy fats like avocado and olive and sesame oils. Some specific foods that positively influence blood pressure include celery, garlic, raw cacao, almonds, cayenne pepper, and eggs. Avoid as often as possible high-sodium foods, fast food, sugar, processed food , and trans fats.Stress initiates the fight-or-flight response, elevating cortisol and adrenaline, tensing up muscles, and spiking blood pressure. All this comes in handy when you need to quickly escape a bear in the woods or a moving vehicle in your path. But nonstop cortisol and adrenaline streaming through your veins can wreak havoc on your entire system. Some great stress-busting tools include therapy, mindfulness meditation, yoga, tai chi, qigong, deep breathing, visualization, and exercise. Speaking of exercise\u2026I get it, not everyone loves to exercise. But when it comes to controlling blood pressure, it\u2019s non-negotiable. Study after study confirms that exercise strengthens the heart, improves blood pressure, and decreases the risk of heart disease, stroke, and countless other conditions. If you\u2019ve been sedentary for a while, start by walking for 10\u201315 minutes a day, and gradually increase your time and distance. Try interval and weight training as well. The more muscle you have, the more fat you\u2019ll burn. Similarly, several recent studies have shown that yoga and mindfulness meditation are effective in lowering blood pressure. Yoga has many other health benefits, and there are a number of different methods\u2014something for just about everyone. If your physician has given you the go-ahead on activity, check out some local yoga classes or rent a DVD to try yoga at home.\n\nWhat are some supplements for high blood pressure I can take?\n\nThese nutrients work much the same way as prescription blood pressure drugs, but without the harsh side effects. Below are some of the best options for safe, natural alternatives.. Nattokinase is a natural blood thinner and a safe, effective, way to help normalize blood pressure, with no side effects. At healthy levels, fibrinogen is a protein that helps create the healthy clotting we sometimes need to end bleeding as the result of an injury. But elevated fibrinogen levels increase the risk of high blood pressure, as well as diabetes, cancer, and blood clots\u2014and it\u2019s linked to a 700 percent increase in deaths from all causes! Nattokinase can help by spotting unhealthy clots in progress and dissolving them, and also by helping blood vessels stay smooth and flexible, another level of protection. In a Japanese study, volunteers with high blood pressure were given 30 grams of natto extract (equivalent to one serving of natto), orally for 4 consecutive days. Results? Systolic blood pressure decreased on average from 173.8 to 154.8 and diastolic blood pressure decreased on average from 101.0 to 91.2. That\u2019s nearly an 11 percent drop in in systolic blood pressure, and a nearly 10 percent drop in diastolic blood pressure\u2014after only 4 days. Other studies show similarly dramatic results. Given the acquired taste issues, I recommend the powdered supplement form. I recommend 50 mg per day.. After their lovely juice has been extracted, grapes still have a lot to offer. Their skins and seeds are rich in Vitamin E, linoleic acid, an essential fatty acid, flavonoids and other powerful, free-radical scavenging antioxidants. Grape seed extract is a vasodilator, normalizing blood pressure by relaxing and dilating blood vessels to keep blood flowing smoothly and less likely to get trapped by plaque. The exceptionally potent antioxidant compounds in grape seed extract can help slow the effects of aging by neutralizing the free radicals that damage your cells and your DNA. Dosage recommendations vary somewhat from study to study. I recommend the University of Maryland Medical Center\u2019s dosages: 25 to 150 milligrams daily for general antioxidant support or 150 to 300 milligrams daily for chronic venous insufficiency.: Grape seed extract can act as a mild blood thinner, so work with your doctor if you\u2019re already taking blood thinners or are at risk for bleeding. Don\u2019t confuse grape seed extract with grape seed oil\u2014the oil contains an overload of omega-6 fatty acid, the kind we don\u2019t want.\n\nMoving Forward\u2026.\n\n. Magnesium is a frontline protector of your blood pressure and cardiac systems, regulating the enzymes that relax constricted blood vessels or prevent them from constricting in the first place. Who benefits from relaxed blood vessels? You do, because your heart doesn\u2019t have to work so hard to keep your circulation moving. Translation: low blood pressure. A meta-analysis of 34 separate studies of magnesium as a supplement resulted in the kind of conclusion that\u2019s music to everyone\u2019s ears: \u201cOur findings support a causal anti-hypertensive effect of [magnesium] supplementation in adults.\u201d Nothing tentative or cautious here. Not a \u201cpossible\u201d anti-hypertensive effect\u2014a causal effect. Period. Your best bet, as always, is to eat a magnesium-rich diet\u2014chicken, nuts, halibut, shrimp, and leafy greens like spinach and kale. It\u2019s a long list of delicious choices. If you opt for a supplement, I recommend 350 to 500 mg per day.Found in nuts, fish, red meat, soy, whole grains, beans, and dairy products, l-arginine shows clear signs that it relaxes and opens arteries, which helps lower blood pressure. Our bodies can usually make all the L-arginine we need from our food. That\u2019s prompted some experts to claim that taking a supplement is \u201crarely necessary, and may be of benefit only to people who have a deficiency.\u201d My take? Thanks to the Standard American Diet (SAD) of over-processed, toxin-ridden, artificial non-foods\u2026most people do, in fact, have a deficiency or deficiencies. If you\u2019re unsure of your l-arginine status, have your doctor check it, along with other essential nutrients you might lack in effective amounts (especially D3). If you do need to supplement, remember that the best way to increase your l-arginine levels is to take l-citrulline, which your body converts efficiently to l-arginine.I hope this gives you some good news and good new options. But always remember what sets you on the best road toward healthy blood pressure\u2014exercise, even a walk around the house or the neighborhood, and a healthy diet. If you\u2019re exercising and eating a fresh, local, organic, humanely raised diet, rich in healthy oils, fruits, veggies, beans, and leafy greens, light on red meat\u2014you\u2019ve got a head start. And don\u2019t think it will take five years to collect your health benefits. You can see those in a matter of weeks. Or, in the nattokinase study, days. If you\u2019re on Big Pharma drugs, please work with your doctor to get a safer, natural blood pressure regimen. Increasingly, natural treatments help make powerful prescription drugs more effective and more tolerable. Using this natural lifestyle and supplement approach, I\u2019m confident you can manage your blood pressure and take control of your health, without the high cost and risk of prescription drugs.", "description": "High blood pressure is treated like an illness\u2026but it\u2019s really .09/02/2019 3:22:04AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png"}
