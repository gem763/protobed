Hector Bellerin and Kieran Tierney returning could breathe new life into the Arsenal attack and give Arsenal something more when trying to impose themselves on the game.\n\nThe Belgians only had five shots in their win over Vit\u00f3ria at home which doesn\u2019t suggest they\u2019ll come out swinging. Arsenal may have to be on the lookout for Maxime Lestienne, however, as he has bagged five goals this term.
