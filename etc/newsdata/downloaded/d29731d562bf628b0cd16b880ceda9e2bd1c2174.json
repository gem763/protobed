Both were released on bail.\n\nOutside the court, demonstrators queued to get in, some chanting slogans such as 'Wearing a face mask isn't a crime' and 'The law is unjust'.\n\nMany said they feared the mask ban was just the first of more emergency orders to come.\n\n'It's an excuse to just introduce other totalitarian laws, next is martial law,' one protester outside the court, who gave his surname Lo, told AFP.\n\nA taxi driver was beaten up and his vehicle trashed Sunday after he drove into a crowd of protesters, injuring two women.
