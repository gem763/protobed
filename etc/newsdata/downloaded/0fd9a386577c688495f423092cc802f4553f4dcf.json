Mike Braun (R-IN) told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview Wednesday that Democrats could make a \u201cfatal mistake\u201d by trying to impeach President Donald Trump.\n\nSen. Braun chastised Democrats\u2019 move to impeach President Trump in an interview with Breitbart News. The Hoosier senator said there was no \u201cquid pro quo\u201d in Trump\u2019s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky; however, there was quid pro quo in former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s involvement in Ukraine.\n\nThe former Vice President reportedly threatened the Ukraine government to get them to fire a prosecutor investigating his son, Hunter Biden, and his relationship with the Ukrainian oil company Burisma.\n\nJoe Biden during Tuesday night\u2019s Democrat presidential debate said that he and his son \u201cdid nothing wrong.\u201d Biden also said that his chief focus in Ukraine was to rid corruption from the country.\n\nHe said:\n\nLook, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government in rooting out corruption in Ukraine. And that\u2019s what we should be focusing on. And what I wanted to make a point about \u2014 and my son\u2019s statement speaks for itself. He spoke about it today. My son\u2019s statement speaks for itself. What I think is important is we focus on why it\u2019s so important to remove this man from office.\n\nSen. Braun called this claim the \u201cheight of hypocrisy,\u201d considering that he pressured Ukrainian officials to fire a prosecutor investigating his son while claiming that the president has committed impeachable offenses.\n\nSen. Braun said that Hunter Biden was a board member of Burimsa because his \u201cdad was VP [Vice President].\u201d\n\nBraun also said that House Democrats have to keep their impeachment inquiry \u201cbehind closed doors\u201d because otherwise, the inquiry \u201cwould not hold muster.\u201d\n\nThe senator spent much of his time in the past couple of weeks in Indiana completing a 92-county tour. He said that Hoosiers are frustrated with Democrats\u2019 move to impeach the president.\n\nBraun said, \u201cI just completed 92 counties under ten months visiting every county [in Indiana], and in the last month there\u2019s been nothing other than frustration and disgust with the fact they\u2019re doing this [impeachment], because the Mueller report coup d\u2019\u00e9tat fell flat. This, to me, was their calculation to find something before they run out of time, and they\u2019re trying to see if they can gin up, and I\u2019ve never seen a media effort that is working that hard on the part of almost everyone to make their case.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe American people see it for what it is,\u201d he added.\n\nSen. Braun said that Democrats may have made \u201ca fatal mistake\u201d with impeachment that could soon backfire in a similar manner to when Democrats tried to tank the confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.\n\nSen. Braun said that impeachment \u201cis starting to wither\u201d and that Democrats have not passed any significant legislation will not help Democrats as they approach the 2020 elections.", "description": "Mike Braun told Breitbart News Wednesday that Democrats could make a \"fatal mistake\" by trying to impeach President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Sean Moran"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/10/mike-braun.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
