We've kind of exhausted all non-surgical possibilities. Some point later in the week he'll be scheduled for surgery to have the neuroma removed.\"\n\nTrout finished with a career-high 45 home runs, 104 runs batted in and a .291 batting average, putting him in contention to win his third American League MVP award along with four second-place finishes.\n\nThe 28-year-old outfielder had 110 walks, a .438 on-base percentage and 1.083 on-base-plus slugging percentage in his first season after agreeing to a 12-year, $426.5-million US contract, baseball's largest deal by total and average salary.\n\nTrout last played on Sept. 7. He said Saturday he hoped to play in Sunday's series finale against Tampa Bay as a designated hitter. He felt pain when running the bases Sunday morning.\n\n\"He realized it was not a pain he could deal with to perform at a high level,\" Ausmus said. \"He understands forcing himself to play on the field wouldn't be productive.\"\n\nLos Angeles already has been eliminated from post-season contention.\n\nTrout has a .305 average in nine major league seasons with 285 homers, 752 RBI and 200 stolen bases.", "description": "The Los Angeles Angels say eight-time all-star Mike Trout will have surgery on his right foot this week because of Morton's neuroma, a thickening of tissue around a nerve leading to toes that causes pain.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5284577.1568577321!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/trout-mike-190831-1180.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
