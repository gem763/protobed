But the 22nd-ranked Broncos\u2019 defense should also be getting its share of the attention, especially after what it did in last week\u2019s victory over Marshall.\n\nThe Broncos (2-0) get their final tuneup before the start of Mountain West Conference play hosting Portland State on Saturday night. The matchup with the FCS school is a rarity for the Broncos - just their third FCS opponent since 2010 - but after an abnormal first two weeks, it\u2019s a needed break.\n\nThe opener was supposed to be a neutral-site night game that due to weather became a midafternoon road game against the Seminoles in Tallahassee. That was followed by a game against a talented Marshall team on a short week. The Broncos escaped with a 14-7 win as Boise State\u2019s defense stymied the Thundering Herd in the second half.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody is happy with the performances we\u2019ve had. I don\u2019t think anybody is here saying, \u2018that\u2019s what it is, we\u2019ve got it figured out.\u2019 By no means is that the case,\u201d Boise State coach Bryan Harsin said. \u201cOur standards are much higher, we have higher expectations of ourselves and this week it needs to start.\u201d\n\nThe victory over the Thundering Herd was highlighted by the stifling performance by Boise State\u2019s defense, which held Marshall without a first down in the second half. The Thundering Herd finished with zero total yards in the second half and punted on four of five possessions, with the fifth ending in an interception.\n\nIt was the second straight week the Broncos shut out their opponent in the second half.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been just coming together, playing together, as well as halftime adjustments and seeing what they\u2019re hitting us on,\u201d Boise State defensive back Kekoa Nawahine said. \u201cReally believing in each other and playing together has been a huge theme of the summer and into the season.\u201d\n\nWhile the game may be a respite for the Broncos, Portland State isn\u2019t an FCS pushover. The Vikings (1-1) already made life miserable for Arkansas in the season opener before falling 20-13 to the Razorbacks. They\u2019re just four years removed from winning at Washington State and North Texas in the same season.\n\n\u201cWe have a big challenge. Boise\u2019s (defensive) line, their front seven, it\u2019s a legit group. They\u2019re fun to watch,\u201d Portland State coach Bruce Barnum said.\n\nOther things to watch as the former Big Sky foes meet for the first time since 2005:\n\nHAMMERIN\u2019 HANK\n\nBachmeier has played well in his two starts but is also taking more hits than the Broncos would like. Bachmeier has been sacked nine times and taken several other hits while standing in the pocket and delivering passes.\n\nHarsin said it\u2019s been a combo of smart pressures by opponents, some missed assignments and Bachmeier being willing to stand in and let a play develop.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want your quarterback getting hit but sometimes they do because of what they have to do to get the ball down the field,\u201d Harsin said.\n\nPROTECT THE QB\n\nOne of the big concerns for Portland State will be protecting quarterback Davis Alexander. The Vikings allowed six sacks in the opener against Arkansas and Boise State has one of the top defensive ends in the Mountain West in Curtis Weaver.\n\n\u201cEvery (defensive) line in the country is going to be licking its chops right now every time we drop back. But we have to make adjustments,\u201d Barnum said.\n\nHOLD THE BALL\n\nIf there is one area where Boise State has excelled through two weeks it\u2019s holding the ball on offense. The Broncos rank second in the country in time of possession, averaging more than 39 minutes through their two games. No team has run more offensive plays than the 189 by the Broncos.\n\nFCS RARITY\n\nFor the most part, Boise State has tried to avoid playing FCS teams as part of its nonconference schedule. The Broncos\u2019 only other games this decade against the lower level came in 2013 against Tennessee-Martin and in 2015 against Idaho State. Only seven schools will have played fewer FCS opponents so far this decade: Notre Dame, USC, UCLA and Texas (zero); Michigan and Ohio State (one); and Oklahoma (two).\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Usually when Boise State is getting attention, the focus first goes to the offense and whoever the quarterback is at the time.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tim Booth"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/13/marshall_boise_st_football_76295_c0-185-4429-2767_s1770x1032.jpg?41506ed8d157e07a3d592ad77741b341b76ae0cb", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
