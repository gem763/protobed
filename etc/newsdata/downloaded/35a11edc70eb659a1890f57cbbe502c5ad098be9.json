If it doesn't look perfect we're not going to get that money.\"\n\nJemelin eventually confronts Lottie and insists that she is not listening to anyone's advice.\n\nSpeaking to camera, Jemelin says: \"I find working with Lottie extremely difficult. It's a gourmet lolly but if the flower goes in the middle it's going to move straight away. Lottie was like 'no it's a gourmet lolly' and I find that really difficult.\"\n\nThe moment of truth finally arrives but the girls manage to break some of their lollies when getting them out of the moulds.\n\nLottie notices that some have leaves sticking out and asks for some scissors to make them look neater.\n\nUnimpressed Karren says: \"They stuffed so much ingredients, rosemary, edible flowers. I tried it and a big lump of rosemary got stuck in my mouth. It was like eating a garden.\"\n\n*The Apprentice airs Wednesdays on BBC One at 9pm", "description": "Lottie ruffles feathers with the other girls by putting flowers in lollies - while Lubna suggest putting cream cheese in", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20546946.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screen-Shot-2019-10-09-at-162712.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
