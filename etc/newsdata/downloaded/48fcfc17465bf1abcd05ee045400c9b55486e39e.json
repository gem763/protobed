As Breitbart\u2019s Sean Moran reported earlier this year, Americans\u2019 trust in social media companies has fallen by 21 points from 2015 to 2019.\n\nLast year, another Pew study found that a majority of both Republicans and Democrats agree that social media companies censor people on the basis of political viewpoint, an allegation that big tech companies have repeatedly denied.\n\nAre you an insider at Google, Facebook, Twitter or any other tech company who wants to confidentially reveal wrongdoing or political bias at your company?
