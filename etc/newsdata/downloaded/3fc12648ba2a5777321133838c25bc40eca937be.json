The surprise deal seemed to cause a groundswell of support and goodwill. So much so, that some of us in the House of Commons watching everything play out on what was supposed to be a huge day for British politics thought he might have the numbers to get his withdrawal deal approved by Parliament.\n\nThen the bad thing happened. Oliver Letwin, a former Conservative Minister, tabled an amendment to Johnson's motion that knocked the Prime Minister clean off his feet.\n\nThe Letwin amendment effectively forces Johnson to send a letter to Brussels requesting an extension to the Brexit deadline. It does this by saying that Johnson's deal cannot be formally approved by Parliament until all the necessary legislation has passed. That could take days, if not weeks. All of which means that a deal cannot be agreed by the House of Commons by 11 p.m. local time (6 p.m. ET) Saturday. That matters, because lawmakers recently passed legislation, known as the Benn Act, that obliges Johnson to do so if no deal was in place at by that point.\n\nJohnson's tone has been different of late. Gone is the flamboyant language, such as rather being \"dead in a ditch\" than request an extension or calling the Benn Act a \"surrender act\". Instead, he's been talking about his love of Europe and his desire to reach across both the political divide and the nation in order to get a deal that works for the whole country.\n\nRead More", "description": "Barely 48 hours have passed since Boris Johnson shocked the world when he reached an agreement with the European Union on a brand-new Brexit deal.", "authors": ["Analysis Luke Mcgee"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191019122348-02-parliament-boris-johnson-1019-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
