Now, omnivores who are intent on health-conscious eating can make peace with trade-offs in lip-smacking satisfaction, but I have yet to master the art.\n\nBetter for me to follow the path set by Ellie Krieger, who writes the Nourish column for Food. She often blends those caloric components in judicious amounts, emphasizing other ingredients that heighten flavor.\n\n[Stock your kitchen with the Dinner in Minutes Pantry for stress-free weeknight cooking.]\n\nThat\u2019s precisely what this pantry-friendly recipe is about. It calls for butter, umami-blessed cheese and creamy dairy, but not so much of each. A tumble of fresh, finely chopped herbs gives the dish its essence even as it lightens the overall effect. Sauteed garlic and the starchy cohort of pasta cooking water complete just enough of a sauce to coat a slightly thicker noodle like fettuccine.\n\nAll the good stuff, for under 500 calories per serving. Serve with a side of sliced ripe tomatoes, or grilled mushrooms and peppers.\n\nRecipe Note: If garlic is not your friend, you can use 2 tablespoons finely chopped shallot instead.\n\n[Scale and get a printer-friendly version of the recipe here.]\n\nIngredients\n\nKosher salt\n\n6 ounces fettuccine (may substitute spinach fettuccine)\n\nOne (1-ounce) block Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese\n\nLeaves from 6 stems parsley (flat-leaf or curly)\n\nAbout 12 basil leaves (may substitute 12 short stems chives)\n\nLeaves from 2 stems thyme (may substitute fronds from 2 large stems dill)\n\n1 tablespoon unsalted butter\n\n1 large or 2 medium cloves garlic\n\n1/4 cup half-and-half\n\n1/8 teaspoon ground cardamom (optional; may substitute small pinch freshly grated nutmeg)\n\nFreshly ground black pepper\n\nSteps\n\nStep 1\n\nBring a pot of water to a boil over medium-high heat. Add a few generous pinches of salt, then the pasta; cook according to the package directions (about 8 minutes), until al dente.\n\nDid you make this recipe?

Finely chop the parsley, basil and thyme; gathering them together is okay.\n\nStep 3\n\nMelt the butter in a deep skillet or saute pan over medium heat. Mince the garlic and add it to the pan. Cook, stirring, until fragrant and just softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the half-and-half and the cardamom, if using. Reduce the heat to medium-low; gradually add half the grated cheese, stirring until it has melted.\n\nStep 4\n\nDrain the pasta, reserving 1 cup of its cooking water.\n\nStep 5\n\nAdd the pasta and chopped herbs to the pan; toss long enough to coat the fettuccine and distribute the herbs evenly. Return the pan to the stove and cook over medium-low heat, for about 1 minute. Add enough of the reserved cooking water to thin the sauce, or to create more of it, and cook until creamy and warmed through, about 30 seconds or so.\n\nStep 6\n\nSeason generously with pepper, top with the remaining cheese and serve.\n\nAdapted from \u201cSkinny Pasta\u201d by Julia Azzarello (Kyle Books, 2018).\n\nTested by Bonnie S.
