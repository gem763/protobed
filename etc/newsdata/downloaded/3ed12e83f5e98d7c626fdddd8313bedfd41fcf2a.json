The brand was just sold to a rental clothing company Le Tote Inc. for $100 million after struggling financially as more people shop online.\n\nThe fall of one-time retail giants goes as far back as October 2018, when Sears filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy and said they were closing over 100 stores.\n\nABC News' Samara Lynn contributed to this report.", "description": "The well-known clothing brand Forever 21 filed for bankruptcy after reportedly struggling in recent years with the rise of e-commerce giants such as Amazon.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Business/forever21-store-rt-ps-190930_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
