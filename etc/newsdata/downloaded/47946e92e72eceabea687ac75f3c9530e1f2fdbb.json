We are not at the level we would want to be... and police officers should be working in their communities.'\n\nMore than 800 protesters have been arrested, including 91-year-old veteran campaigner John Lynes, but illegal sites in Whitehall and Horseferry Road remain closed while police spend hours dislodging the demonstrators without injuring them and sparking potential compensation claims.\n\nLorna Greenwood, 32, who organised the event in Westminster today, speaks to protesters as they try to block Whitehall\n\nPolice kettled a giant Extinction Rebellion octopus up Whitehall towards Trafalgar Square by more than half a dozen police - at the Met asked for 500 more officers to be sent from 43 forces across England and Wales\n\nHundreds of mothers fed their babies as part of a giant 'feed in' before marching on Downing Street to demand the PM protects the future of their children\n\nJohn Lynes, 91, is pictured being arrested in Whitehall as officers have detained around 800 people in central London in just two days\n\nA mother breastfeeds her child ahead of the Extinction Rebellion mass 'nurse-in' road blockade outside the QEII Centre today\n\nYoga sessions at dawn today as XR tightened their grip on the centre of London - currently the world's largest eco-camp\n\nExtinction Rebellion protesters stretch and do yoga at the back of Downing Street this morning as police failed to make a major breakthrough\n\nYards away hundreds of women fed their babies outside the QEII centre, where Boris Johnson was announced as the Conservative Party leader, to 'plead for the lives' of their children\n\nPolice have been slow to clear the camps - including this one on Marsham Street close to the Home Office headquarters\n\nXR to launch three-day 'Hong Kong style' occupation of London City Airport Extinction Rebellion protesters have outlined their plans to shut down City Airport in east London for three days from Thursday at 9am. The demonstrators say they want to disrupt 'business as usual' at the airport and target continued Government support for airport expansion. Protests will include a Hong Kong-style occupation of the terminal building, with people lying, sitting and gluing themselves in front of the departure and arrivals gates. If they are unable to occupy the airport, they say they will blockade it from the outside, occupying the DLR station and the access road. A London City Airport spokesman said: 'We continue to work closely with the Metropolitan Police to prepare for the threat of Extinction Rebellion protests. Our shared priority is the safe operation of the airport and to minimise disruption for passengers using the airport over the coming days. 'All passengers travelling for the remainder of this week will be required to show their boarding pass to access the terminal. We'd like to thank passengers in advance for their patience'.\n\nToday the National Police Coordination Centre revealed a rare 'mutual aid' request has been sent to 43 police forces for 500 officers to be deployed over the next fortnight.\n\nA large number of officers from Surrey, Sussex, Kent and Hampshire have already been rushed into the capital this morning.\n\n'Mutual aid' is often used to bring in more police in the event of a large-scale terrorist attack, such as the Manchester Arena suicide bombing in 2017.\n\nDAC Taylor told Talk Radio: 'It's a really complex operation for us. We're using every piece of legislation currently available to us to deal with the unlawful activity that we're encountering.\n\n'But it takes time - when people go limp on arrest, it takes at least four officers to take them away.\n\n'They have to be processed through custody - that takes additional time. But also, we are clearing a lot of tents.\n\n'We have cleared 80 tonnes worth of equipment to date. That's all in storage, because it's all evidence of offences, so that's all being stored at our property stores.'\n\nToday the activists began the day with a giant yoga session before a mass 'nurse-in' by breastfeeding and bottlefeeding mothers who marched from Westminster Abbey to Downing Street.\n\nAnd in one extraordinary seen up to ten police officers kettled in a giant pink puppet octopus and moved it up Whitehall to Trafalgar Square, where last night, in the streets under Nelson's Column, thousands of XR supporters partied into the night at a gig headlined by dance band Orbital.\n\nPolice arrest a protester who was glued to to others next to the Women of World War Two memorial on Whitehall today\n\nProtesters on Birdcage Walk, outside the Institute of Mechanical Engineers, during the third day of the protest today\n\nPolice on Birdcage Walk as they attempt to remove a structure on the third day of the Extinction Rebellion protest today\n\nThe main XR camp has been set up in St James Park with people pitching tents at the rear of Treasury building by Horseguard's Parade\n\nCabinet Office minister Michael Gove talks to an Extinction Rebellion protester and takes a leaflet at the back of Downing Street today\n\nActivists were free to rave at a giant Orbital gig and party in Trafalgar Square last night (pictured) - ignoring a warning from police that they faced arrest\n\nExtinction Rebellion have actually increased the spread of their protest overnight - despite police pledging to force them back to Trafalgar Square\n\nXR appear to want to fill London's police cells so there is nowhere for the Met to put all the people they plan to arrest over the coming fortnight\n\nExtinction Rebellion's growing territory came despite Scotland Yard's warning that they would arrest anyone not in the pedestrianised area of Trafalgar Square by the end of yesterday.\n\nThe hundreds of tents pitched all along Whitehall, past Downing Street and around Parliament Square - and a central camp in St James Park - still remain this morning where minister Michael Gove spoke to protesters.\n\nBoris Johnson's father Stanley says he would proudly 'wear 'unco-operative crusty' badge' Stanley Johnson joined the EX protests under Nelson's Column and told MailOnline: 'I would wear a badge with 'uncooperative crusty' on it' - a dig at his son's description of the activists Boris Johnson's father has arrived in Trafalgar Square to support the Extinction Rebellion activists his son has branded 'uncooperative crusties' - saying he considers it a badge of honour. The Prime Minister has called on the thousands of eco-warriors to abandon their 'hemp-smelling bivouacs' and stop blocking roads as police failed to smash their illegal eco-village in central London. But today Mr Johnson sr joined them under Nelson's Column and told MailOnline: 'I would wear a badge with 'uncooperative crusty' on it'. He also said he would be prepared to sit down and protest with them for the next fortnight but added: 'I won't be able to do that today as I have a lunch appointment'.\n\nHundreds of women fed their babies outside the QEII centre, where Boris Johnson was announced as the Conservative Party leader, to 'plead for the lives' of their children.\n\nLorna Greenwood, 32, who organised the event, said: 'We're bringing the youngest lives who will be affected by the climate crisis to the heart of Westminster.'\n\nA procession of police-escorted buggies made its way down Whitehall, as hundreds of mothers headed to Downing Street to continue their breastfeeding protest.\n\nThe parade was momentarily stopped by officers at the end of the street, who refused to allow the prams through, creating a standoff between police and parents.\n\nBut the rows of mothers eventually settled next to the Cenotaph, just yards from Number 10, to breast and bottle-feed their children, eliciting an emotional response from onlookers.\n\nOne mother, Anna Warrington, 36, arrived to feed her nine-month-old twins, Mathilda and Aubrey, who she carried in a double sling.\n\nMs Warrington, a doctor from London, said: 'Women like me with little babies have come along to highlight the crisis the planet is in, that our children have to live through.\n\n'In 50 years our children are going to inherit a planet that is so different. They can't have the lives and the childhood that I had.'\n\nScotland Yard has been accused of 'standing around the edges' as up to 30,000 people flooded central London - making around 800 arrests in the past two days.\n\nXR members have also taken a vow to refuse bail in bid to fill London's 700 police cells - with 5,000 people said to have pledged to be arrested.\n\nElderly protesters were arrested outside Downing Street on Wednesday morning, as the Extinction Rebellion protests entered their third day.\n\nPolice speak to two protesters during an Extinction Rebellion climate change protest in Westminster today\n\nA pair of protesters who have glued themselves to each other and the road, on Birdcage Walk, in Westminster today\n\nPolice speak to a man who has handcuffed himself at an Extinction Rebellion climate change protest in Westminster today\n\nPolice led and carried people out of the main road in Whitehall, while onlookers sang and shouted 'we love you'.\n\nMums hold XR 'feed-in' outside Parliament Mothers staged a mass breastfeeding near Parliament Square today as the Extinction Rebellion climate change protests entered their third day. Anna, who was feeding her six-week-old baby, said: 'I'm here because I need to protect her future. I need to do everything I can. I'm frightened, I don't know what's going to happen. 'It really brought it home to me when my older daughter when I was pregnant asked me what was going to happen when she had a baby and I couldn't answer her, I don't know. And I want to do everything I can to ensure she has a future.' Anna added that she has stopped flying, her partner took a train to Geneva instead of flying recently and has cut out almost all meat from her diet. She added: 'It can't be a negative, the steps that we're taking.' She was among hundreds of women who fed their babies outside the QEII centre, where Boris Johnson was announced as the Conservative Party leader, to 'plead for the lives' of their children.\n\nLast night it emerged XR is raking in \u00a340,000-a-day in donations during the protests that have paralysed London, as the Met has been forced to admit they have been overwhelme.\n\nThe group's head of finance, former banker Andrew Medhurst, said \u00a3125,000 had been raised after police raided its warehouse in south London and seized equipment, The Times reported.\n\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said the Metropolitan Police should be taking 'more robust action' against demonstrators who have effectively taken over the streets surrounding Parliament.\n\nSome glued themselves to the Department for Transport building yesterday and to a lorry outside the Home Office in their 'direct action' against what they say is the Government's failure to take climate change seriously.\n\nScotland Yard's attempts to reopen two miles of streets around Parliament failed - hours after warning they would arrest anyone who had not moved to the pedestrianised area of Trafalgar Square around its fountains.\n\nInstead Extinction Rebellion were able to set up a 'village' on the roads under Nelson's Column with its own improvised cycle lane, food stalls, community kitchen and a 'well-being sanctuary' for tired or stressed environmentalists as well as an extraordinary outdoor rave where people spent hours 'dancing their feelings'.\n\nA group have also placed 800 potted trees outside Parliament as they called on Boris Johnson to plant billions more across the UK.\n\nAnd a new plot to shut down London City Airport for up to three days from 9am on Thursday by occupying the terminal emerged.\n\nOver 100 members of the group are planning to attend City Airport, claiming that the plan is to do a 'Hong Kong' style occupation of the terminal building, which will involve demonstrators sitting and lying in front of the departure and arrival gates.\n\nAs well as this organisers have been communicating with protesters throughout the day, advising them of the sites which remain occupied and encouraging them to 'keep going'. Messages exchanged between organisers and protesters also reveal that so-called 'Plan C' sites are to be more disruptive than others.\n\nActivists carry a giant pink octopus as they walk along Whitehall towards Trafalgar Square, followed by police officers\n\nPolice attempt to separate a pair of protesters who have glued themselves to each other adjacent to the Women of World War Two memorial on Whitehall as their cheering supporters watch on\n\nClose to Downing Street, officers comforted a woman who was given a silver blanket to keep warm on Whitehall today\n\nPolice have still been unable to move the XR hearse in Trafalgar Square with activists surrounding it with one person locked inside\n\nEco-warriors sang protests songs and also chanted 'we love you' as the Met continued to arrest people in the capital\n\nMothers with their children at the start of the Extinction Rebellion mass 'nurse-in' road blockade\n\nAdmitting defeat Inspector Simon Rooke, who is based in the square, said: 'At this time we are saying 'If you want to protest by all means protest but you need to do it here'.'\n\nProtest organisers praise rebels for forcing police to 'crank up their response' Organisers behind the protests and occupations across London have praised their supporters and urged them to 'stay clam' through police intervention. This afternoon rebels claimed they were holding 8 of the 12 sites across London and conversation shared between members on their private messaging board reveal just how much of the city they are occupied. In a message to fellow rebels, organisers urged them to 'keep going' and shared a detailed plan of which sites were occupied most. 1: Marsham St - We Are All Crew by far the densest site with 1000 rebels! Tents being encouraged to move by the police but morning dance vibes prevail Gluing on actions occurring at 4 Government buildings within site, but police removal teams are moving fast. Laura the lorry looking threatened with police surround, 70 tents, 12 gazebos. 2: Millbank - the North are under a lot of pressure from police, looking like one roadblock about to go. Most tents packed up, arrests occurring and losing infrastructure. Brave and courageous rebels, we love you! 3: Lambeth Bridge - Big ups to the SW & Faith groups for an immense 12hr stand off yesterday with over 60 arrests. They have now merged with We Are All Crew 4: Horseguards - Love Rebellion feeling loved up 12 gazebos and 70 tents still up, seems calm, infrastructure growing! Kitchen functioning! 5: Whitehall - People's Assembly in progress, Jacob Rees-Mogg just walked past - Strong determined vibes to continue to hold the site! Plenty of tents and rebels 6: Victoria St - The Scots are rocking it! 300+ rebels, holding site comfortably and currently underway with an action of BEIS. 60 tents, kitchen up and running 7: Trafalgar - Sound system on! Energy reviving slowly, lost some infrastructure in the night. Roadblocks good. A little thin on numbers, hoping for more to join 8: Westminster Bridge - After what we thought was a calm settling into night time, the police came back at midnight and cleared the site. Now moved to Plan B and joined Trafalgar. Huge love to the Londoners! 9: The Mall - good vibes currently after a spate of arrests this morning. 50 or so rebels, tents, marquees still up and only few police about. 10: Smithsfield - After a jolly night bedded down in Smithsfield Market, Animal Rebellion to take their 2nd site today on Horseferry Rd! Welcome! 11: St James Park - Global Justice now at St James Park, having a meeting this morning to discuss moving to a 2nd Plan B. 30 or so rebels. And toilets have arrived! 12: The Mall - XR Peace - are up and about and ready to join another site, possibly The Mall \ufffd\ufffd\ufe0f 'All in all... That's 8/12 standing but this could already be old news 'What we are doing is INCREDIBLE. It is HUGE. The news reports are rolling, the people are talking, the politicians are noticing. The fact the police are cranking up response means we are having a much bigger effect. Stay strong Stay calm '\n\nAnd when asked why police had failed to stop them setting up camp despite weeks preparing he said: 'They are very well organised and very well-funded. That's all I can say', according to The Times.\n\nThe climate change activists, many of whom camped close to Big Ben, are blockading government buildings and demanding what the plans are for the climate emergency.\n\nProtesters brought chaos for commuters on Monday, closing down a large area of central London as part of coordinated actions taking place around the world.\n\nMore road closures are expected today as tens of thousands descend on the capital. Parliament Street, Great Smith Street, and Westminster and Lambeth bridges are expected to be heavily affected.\n\nThe Met Police said it had arrested 319 demonstrators by midnight last night, almost three times the 122 arrests made on the first day of similar protests last April.\n\nEco-activists who left London in chaos were branded 'crusties' and 'importunate nose-ringed climate change protesters' by Boris Johnson last night.\n\nThe Prime Minister told Extinction Rebellion demonstrators to 'stop blocking the traffic' as the city centre ground to a halt despite a massive police presence.\n\nOne climate activist has been sat locked to the top of a trailer, parked in Trafalgar Square, for more than 24 hours.\n\nOther demonstrators counted down from 10 and cheered as the milestone was reached.\n\nSpeaking to PA from the roof of the trailer, the activist, Rob, 28, said: 'It's a story to tell my grandchildren.\n\n'It's to show in a completely non-violent way that we're willing to disrupt what we call order now and business as usual. To highlight what needs to be done.\n\n'We won't tolerate business as usual. We mean no harm to anyone we know we're inconveniencing.'\n\nRob, whose legs were both bike-locked to the roof, said that he had also earlier glued his left hand to the roof and had no idea when he would come down.\n\nHe was thrown a small tube of sun cream by a fellow activist.\n\nA group of activists camped at Smithfield Market said they allowed traders to operate.\n\nAnimal Rebellion told the PA news agency: 'Traders were able to operate, yes, we had agreement in place. There were tensions but overall the night went by peacefully and we made clear our message with holding the site.'\n\nExtinction Rebellion activist Glenn Drake, 65, from Lowestoft in Suffolk, brandished a sign which read 'Boris, sort climate change first, (then) prorogue Brexit', at Trafalgar Square on the second day of the two-week long international protests.\n\nMr Drake is a Brexiteer, but said politicians should be prioritising tackling climate change before securing a deal with the EU.\n\nHe said: 'I voted for Brexit, mainly because I don't want to be part of a federal Europe.\n\n'But because of the urgency of climate change, we need to put aside Brexit.\n\n'No-one can agree on it, the country is 50/50 split, so let's put that aside and let's concentrate on the main issue, and that's climate change.'", "description": "Bristol-based street artists who say they dress in red in order to remind people of the blood that binds humanity have added their eerie presence to the protests currently clogging up central London.", "authors": ["Sebastian Murphy-Bates For Mailonline", "Martin Robinson Chief Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/22/19513512-0-image-a-42_1570657631207.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
