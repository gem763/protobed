FOREX-Yen rises, offshore yuan dips on caution over Sino-U.S. trade talks\n\n* China narrowing scope for trade deal - Bloomberg\n\n* Dollar loses momentum despite Friday's upbeat jobs data\n\n* Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh\n\nBy Hideyuki Sano\n\nTOKYO, Oct 7 (Reuters) - The yen gained slightly and the\n\nyuan slipped a tad in early Asian trade on Monday on a media\n\nreport that China wants the scope of this week's trade talks and\n\nany deal with the United States to be narrow.\n\nBloomberg reported that Chinese officials are signalling\n\nthey are increasingly reluctant to agree to a broad trade deal\n\npursued by U.S. President Donald Trump. That report knocked down the dollar against the yen during\n\nthin early Monday trade to as low as 106.55 yen .\n\nThe U.S. currency has so far found some support around a\n\none-month low of 106.48 touched last week.\n\nIt last traded at 106.82 yen , down 0.11% from late\n\nFriday U.S. levels.\n\nThe yuan weakened about 0.20% in offshore trade to 7.1285\n\nyuan per dollar CNH= . There was no onshore trading as Monday\n\nis the last day of China's holiday break for its national day.\n\nYukio Ishizuki, senior strategist at Daiwa Securities, said\n\nhe believes the impact of the media story \"will not last long,\n\nwith U.S.-China trade talks due later this week, ahead of a\n\nplanned tariff hike on Oct. 15.\"\n\nTop-level U.S.-China trade talks are scheduled to resume\n\nThursday and Friday, when Chinese Vice Premier Liu He meets U.S.\n\nTrade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary\n\nSteven Mnuchin in Washington.\n\nTrump last month delayed hiking levies on $250 billion worth\n\nof Chinese imports to 30% from current 25% to Oct 15. from\n\noriginally scheduled Oct. 1 \"as a gesture of good will\".\n\n\"The United States probably does not want to raise tariffs\n\ngiven recent signs of softening in the U.S. economy, and markets\n\nhope for some sort of deal that allows them to keep talking in\n\nthe future,\" Ishizuki said.\n\nLast week saw a string of soft U.S. economic data that\n\nraised doubts on the assumption by many that the U.S. economy\n\nwill be more resilient than other economies to damage from\n\nSino-U.S. trade war.\n\nSuch worries eased slightly after U.S. September non-farm\n\npayrolls data on Friday came in fairly strong and the jobless\n\nrate fell to near a 50-year low. But that did little to change market expectations that the\n\nFed will cut likely interest rates at its next policy review on\n\nOct. 29-30 to support the economy.\n\nSentiment about the dollar is further complicated by the\n\nuncertain U.S. political outlook, as Trump faces an impeachment\n\ninquiry in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nAs the dollar has lost momentum, the euro stood at $1.0982\n\n, up 0.02% in Asia, recovering little by little after\n\nhaving hit a near 2 1/2-year low of $1.0879 last Tuesday.\n\nSterling traded little changed at $1.2336 GBP=D4 , with\n\nuncertainties on Brexit keeping many investors on the sideline.\n\nBritain's Brexit minister said the UK is open to some\n\nflexibility on the proposed mechanism that would allow lawmakers\n\nin post-Brexit Northern Ireland to decide whether the British\n\nprovince remains in regulatory alignment with the European\n\nUnion. With less than a month until the U.K.'s scheduled exit on\n\nOct 31, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is seeking\n\nsignificant changes to how the most contentious issue - the\n\nborder between British-ruled Northern Ireland and EU member\n\nIreland - was dealt with in the divorce deal agreed by his\n\npredecessor, Theresa May, almost a year ago.\n\nThe European Union and Ireland said last week that the\n\nproposals were unlikely to yield a deal.", "description": "FOREX-Yen rises, offshore yuan dips on caution over Sino-U.S. trade talks", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC8402K_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
