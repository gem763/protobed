The Northern Cape and Mpumulanga both saw small drops in prices \u2013 but the national average price of a hotel room increased by 0.6% during the same period.\n\nIn Gauteng prices were up by 3.5%, and in the North West prices increased by 4.5%.\n\nThe price decreases in the Western Cape came despite hotels spending heavily on new water infrastructure.\n\nForeign tourist arrivals to South Africa have continued to decline during 2018 to date, by nearly 7% according to the most recent figures. Occupancy levels, especially in five-star hotels in Cape Town, are also down.\n\nThis week, tourism minister Derek Hanekom said Cape Town's heavily-publicised drive to avoid a \"Day Zero\" scenario \u2013 though it had been necessary \u2013 scared off foreign tourists.\n\n\n\n", "description": "As tourist demand flagged, prices dropped, new data shows.
