That same percentage of Americans is also concerned that Trump\u2019s trade war with China will raise prices on consumer goods in the U.S.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll. (Photo illustration: Yahoo News; photos: AP, ABC/WashPost) More\n\nThat economic anxiety has helped push Trump\u2019s job approval numbers down from 44 percent in July to just 38 percent in September, the poll found.\n\nThe president wasted little time disputing the poll\u2019s results.\n\nABC/Washington Post Poll was the worst and most inaccurate poll of any taken prior to the 2016 Election. When my lawyers protested, they took a 12 point down and brought it to almost even by Election Day. It was a Fake Poll by two very bad and dangerous media outlets. Sad! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 10, 2019\n\nBut two other polls released Tuesday confirmed the downward trend. Both Gallup and CNN found Trump\u2019s approval rating to be at 39 percent.\n\nSince his inauguration, Trump has routinely dismissed polls and news stories that have not portrayed him in a favorable light, assuring the public that the truth stands in opposition to what he calls the \u201cFake News Media.\u201d\n\nThe president has also assured his supporters that internal polls not available to the public show him with a comfortable lead on Democrats seeking to replace him.\n\nOne of the greatest and most powerful weapons used by the Fake and Corrupt News Media is the phony Polling Information they put out. Many of these polls are fixed, or worked in such a way that a certain candidate will look good or bad. Internal polling looks great, the best ever! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 10, 2019\n\nBut after a Trump staffer leaked the results of an internal poll taken in May that reportedly showed the president trailing former Vice President Joe Biden in key battleground states, the president alleged a conspiracy.\n\n\u201cWe have great internal polling, there were fake polls released by somebody that is \u2014 it is ridiculous. We are winning in every single state that we polled. We\u2019re winning in Texas very big, in Ohio very big, in Florida very big,\u201d Trump said on June 12, adding, \u201cThey were fake polls that were either put out by the corrupt media, much of the media in this country is corrupt.\u201d\n\nWith doubts continuing to fester about his reelection chances, the president reiterated his assurances days later.\n\nOnly Fake Polls show us behind the Motley Crew. We are looking really good, but it is far too early to be focused on that. Much work to do! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 17, 2019\n\nWhen Fox News released a poll in August showing Trump losing head-to-head match-ups with four top contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination, the president again blamed the messenger.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something going on at Fox, I\u2019ll tell you right now,\u201d Trump told reporters last month. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not happy with it.\u201d\n\nThat same poll showed his approval rating dipping to 43 percent and his disapproval numbers hitting 56 percent.\n\nWhile Trump often portrays the polling taken in the waning days of the 2016 presidential election as wildly inaccurate, he often ignores the fact that Democrat Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by a margin of 2.1 percent. While most of the final polls taken ahead of Election Day showed Clinton ahead of Trump by a margin of 3 to 6 percentage points, only Monmouth University\u2019s 6 point lead fell outside of the margin of error.\n\nMeanwhile, the president\u2019s former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, admitted in January to attempts to rig online polls in Trump\u2019s favor ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\u201cI truly regret my blind loyalty to a man who doesn\u2019t deserve it,\u201d tweeted Cohen, who is currently serving a three-year prison sentence for violating campaign finance laws, bank and tax fraud, and lying to Congress about efforts by the Trump organization to build a skyscraper in Moscow.\n\nCohen added that his efforts to skew the polls came at the direction of the man who now sits in the Oval Office.\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "The president bashed an ABC News/Washington Post poll that showed his approval rating falling by 6 points as fears of a recession grow.", "authors": ["David Knowles"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rjqssKXJnaRsfQqszN6EpA--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/1fecc320-d3f1-11e9-9fef-d63e65942f71", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
