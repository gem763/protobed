Bridgewater, Mass., native electrified the crowd at TD Garden with his victory is a story straight out of a movie script.\n\nEven Lauzon himself knows that putting down the gloves underneath the Celtics and Bruins championship banners and the retired numbers of legends like Larry Bird and Bobby Orr would have been a great way to go out.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great way to end it if it\u2019s the end, for sure,\u201d Lauzon said at the post-fight news conference.\n\nLauzon didn\u2019t announce his retirement after the victory, but nor is the 35-year-old deluding himself into believing he\u2019ll go on another gigantic run. Rather than make a decision in the heat of the moment, he\u2019s going to take his time and figure out whether to call it a career or fight again.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll kind of see how things go,\u201d Lauzon said, \u201cI\u2019m always going to be training, whether it is cornering or helping out guys. We have a lot of guys training at my gym now \u2026 I\u2019m in the gym all the time with them. We\u2019ll kind of see what happens. I\u2019m not saying this is definitely the last fight, but I\u2019m not going to say I\u2019m definitely gonna do it again. Tonight was a great night, but I think too many guys fall into the trap of, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m back. Here we go.\u2019 But I\u2019m not there. Maybe I\u2019ll fight in six months, maybe I\u2019ll fight in a year, maybe I\u2019m done.\u201d\n\nUFC president Dana White, for his part, is all in on the \u201cI\u2019m done\u201d option.\n\n\u201cMe and Joe Lauzon had a deal that he\u2019d retire tonight, win, lose or draw, and he didn\u2019t do it,\u201d White said with a smile. \u201cWhat better way to go out than tonight? He beat a real guy tonight; he beat a real tough guy that a lot of people didn\u2019t think he was going to beat, and he made it look easy.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s for down the road. For now, Lauzon admits that while he did his best to play the role of the stoic New Englander, the evening\u2019s emotions got to him.\n\n\u201cI was definitely crying a little bit,\u201d Lauzon said. \u201cI was trying to keep it in the best I could. I try not to get emotional and stuff. I was trying to be stoic, but I definitely was, even walking out before the fight I was looking around at all the people in the green shirts that we printed up in the gym. I was feeling it. There was so much that went into it.\u201d", "description": "Dana White said an agreement was in place for Joe Lauzon to retire after his UFC on ESPN 6 win, lose or draw.", "authors": ["Dave Doyle", "John Morgan", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Mike Bohn", "Nolan King", "Blue Corner"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/joe-lauzon-ufc-boston-post-fight.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
