It cannot be accessed by broker platforms.\u2019\n\nHe likes the fact that its managers focus on one thing and on doing it really well \u2013 in this case finding decent-sized American companies with strong performance.\n\nOn this side of the Atlantic he holds Aurora (now managed by Phoenix Asset Management) which is an investmentfund focusing on UK \u2018value\u2019 companies.\n\nThese are quality firms with good growth potential where the share price is undervalued and so priced attractively. Yeowart says: \u2018When I look at fund managers I want them to have humility and be always wanting to improve \u2013 to be better investors.\u2019\n\nFor this reason Yeowart takes his time to make his selections across managers with different skills and assets \u2013 and when he has made his choice he tends to keep them for a long time.\n\nTurnover of the holdings in the \u00a3133 million fund over the past three years has been just 5 per cent.\n\nThe net result is that he runs a highly diversified fund \u2013 both by style of investment, type of asset and geography. As well as Findlay Park American, he has held since launch Brown Advisory Latin American, CG Real Return (global government index-linked bonds) and Japan specialists Morant Wright, Stewart Asia Pacific Leaders and Lindsell Train Japanese Equity.\n\nA more recent addition is Egerton Capital Equity \u2013 the fund\u2019s largest holding \u2013 which itself offers a widely diversified exposure both by country and stock type.\n\nTo add some ballast in these turbulent times, Yeowart also has exposure to gold \u2013 4 per cent \u2013 through Gold Bullion Securities. This is a passive Exchange Traded Fund, with no fund managers in sight.\n\nPatrick Connolly, of adviser Chase de Vere, says the fund is one of the best performers in the so-called \u2018flexible\u2019 sector \u2013 in the last year it has returned 9 per cent, more than double the performance of the FTSE All-Share.\n\nHe says: \u2018It has a proven record of managing downside risks and providing strong long-term returns. The major drawback is the ongoing charges which, although they\u2019re capped at 1.5 per cent per annum, are still expensive.\u2019", "description": "Funds that build a portfolio of other funds - known as 'funds of funds' or 'multi-manager'- can get a bad press, but Troy's Tom Yeowart does things differently, picking boutique investments.", "authors": ["Sally Hamilton", "Financial Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
