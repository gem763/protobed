Photo: Netflix\n\nMartin Scorsese ranges toward extremes, which is why he\u2019ll be a manic showboater in one movie and practice rigorous self-abnegation in the next. But his gingerly paced, three-and-a-half-hour The Irishman is something new: a self-abnegation movie set in the place where he normally showboats \u2014 the gangster dens of New York and other urban-crime hubs, among bosses, lackeys, hitmen, and their families, real and \u201cmade.\u201d Union halls, too, since the film is built around the 1975 killing (presumed, as no body was found) of Teamsters president Jimmy Hoffa. By design, it\u2019s an old man\u2019s movie, and not just because it\u2019s narrated by the elderly title character, Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro), from a wheelchair in a Catholic convalescent home. Scorsese has consciously put a cap on his adrenaline. Enriched beyond his dreams by the folks at Netflix and pressed to assemble a veritable Rat Pack \u2014 aging Scorsese vets De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Harvey Keitel, plus Al Pacino, a guest star from the other landmark gangster movie of his era, The Godfather \u2014 the director has made his most stylishly daring film: one that is pointedly sapped of style.\n\nConsider the violence. The Irishman has no flashy set-piece killings, no whip-pans to carnage, no scenes of mayhem suitable for rewatching while playing air guitar. (No Rolling Stones!) For a hit in a barbershop, the camera follows the killers from behind and then comes to rest in front of some flowers \u2014 we only hear the shots. Sheeran fought in some of the grisliest, most protracted battles in World War II\u2019s European theater (122 days in Anzio), and the detachment with which he came home to America seeps into all the film\u2019s murders. It\u2019s ugly, a waste, but it\u2019s what it is. This is not De Niro the mythic executioner who vaulted over roofs in The Godfather Part II or embodied the dark soul of urban paranoia in Taxi Driver. He\u2019s not agile or picturesque and certainly not courageous. Scorsese stages his kills as brusque, arrhythmic, ungainly \u2014 pop-pop-pop from behind and that\u2019s it. Apart from his Judas Iscariot moment (betrayal being a lifelong Scorsese fixation), Sheeran does what he\u2019s told to do with no evident emotion. It\u2019s a job, like house-painting.\n\nThe Irishman is, in fact, closely based on Charles Brandt\u2019s I Heard You Paint Houses: Frank \u201cThe Irishman\u201d Sheeran & Closing the Case on Jimmy Hoffa. It\u2019s a good, messy book that further dispelled (for at least one reader) the conclusion that Kennedy was assassinated by a lone nut who was then spontaneously taken out by a grieving nightclub owner. The paint is blood, the patois representative of how gangsters talk in Steven Zaillian\u2019s subtle, shapely screenplay. Even the most bloodcurdling figures like Tony Salerno (Domenick Lombardozzi) speak in euphemism and metaphor, not because they\u2019re poets but because they\u2019re disconnected from the horror they perpetrate. They\u2019re thoroughly banal. Al Pacino\u2019s Hoffa seems to earn the bosses\u2019 wrath not only for threatening to take control of the Teamsters\u2019 pension fund but for being blunt and unmannerly.\n\nThe movie is framed by Frank\u2019s final days in a convalescent home, but it\u2019s largely a flashback with its own flashbacks. The main thread is a long but mundane \u201975 road trip with Frank at the wheel, his sometime boss and patron, Russell Bufalino (Pesci), in the passenger seat, and the men\u2019s wives in the back. They\u2019re headed to a wedding with stops to collect payments from business owners on the way, but the vibe is so flat that it\u2019s eerie. Something bad is coming, which is why Frank can\u2019t get it out of his head \u2014 but he also wants to tell us how he met Bufalino (cute, in a gas station), how he made his bones stealing sides of meat, and how he began to blow up cars and warehouses and finally people for the likes of Russ and Angelo Bruno (Keitel) and Felix \u201cSkinny Razor\u201d DiTullio (Bobby Cannavale). Most of these men are as colorless as they are powerful \u2014 apart, of course, from Hoffa, for whom Frank goes to work at Bufalino\u2019s request as an aide and bodyguard.\n\nThe Irishman gives you no indication that this is the Teamsters\u2019 last hurrah, that the future \u2014 sans Hoffa, under Ronald Reagan \u2014 would make strikebreaking respectably mainstream. In the early part of the film, their antagonist is President John F. Kennedy and his brother, the attorney general, who launches a campaign against organized crime that organized criminals find inexplicable given their help (in Illinois in particular) in securing Kennedy the presidency. The bosses and the unions will stick with Kennedy because he has promised to help them reclaim their precious Havana from Castro; but after Frank delivers a truckload of weapons to a motley group of soldiers in South Florida, things go, well, south.\n\nThe attorney general\u2019s grilling of Hoffa is rich in period detail, but the movie is not designed as an epic, like The Aviator. It\u2019s a film of faces. Odd faces, at times. Faces that \u2014 thanks to computer \u201cde-aging\u201d \u2014 don\u2019t always match the voices and bodies. Grateful to relive the past with these beloved movie stars, I mostly pushed the dermal irregularities from my mind, though when Pesci\u2019s Bufalino phones Hoffa to recommend \u201cthat kid I was talkin\u2019 to you about,\u201d it takes a moment to register it\u2019s De Niro. The time machine can travel only so far back.\n\nBut it\u2019s great to see De Niro back with Scorsese, who needed a break from Leo and all those kid actors. After years of doing anything and everything and not seeming fully invested (like Anjelica Huston, I\u2019ve wondered, How big is his nut?), De Niro is once more inspired to test himself. His Frank is a man who feels nothing specific yet is in evident pain throughout \u2014 which sometimes manifests itself in a toothless grimace that recalls Bela Lugosi but more often translates into stammers that suggest inner panic. He is most of all befuddled by his own actions \u2014 a weird but fascinating quality in a protagonist. And who can resist seeing him across from Keitel and Pesci?\n\nAt the premiere New York Film Festival press screening, I heard all sorts of huzzahs about Pacino \u2014 and he is wonderful \u2014 but it\u2019s Pesci who thrilled me to the core. A pop-top in Raging Bull and especially Goodfellas and Casino, he plays Bufalino as almost supernaturally focused and watchful, always hypersensitive to other peoples\u2019 rhythms. Who could imagine Pesci triumphing as a man who looks for equilibrium, who seeks to modulate every encounter, who accepts that murder is inevitable but sadly, seeing in it a sign of failure? I thank the gods of acting that he came out of retirement to do this.\n\nAnd Pacino? Scorsese nudges him out of his familiar rhythms, evidently refusing to let him do the kind of freestyle acting that he fancies as bebop but is more often ham. This is a \u201chead\u201d Pacino performance, not a cojones one. On the stump, Pacino\u2019s shoulders go stiff and he jerks in the manner of Richard Nixon \u2014 but Nixon\u2019s manner might well have rubbed off on the real Hoffa. It\u2019s plausible. Zaillian\u2019s firm dramatic beats keep Pacino in the moment, and it\u2019s a joy to see him go eye to eye with the superb Stephen Graham as the febrile Anthony Provenzano (Tony Pro), each man staring daggers that they seem one moment away from materializing and flinging. Most of all, Pacino lets you feel Hoffa\u2019s relish for the job, which is partly legitimate and partly based on patronage and bribes and occasional rough stuff. It merges with Pacino\u2019s relish for these co-stars and this script.\n\nIt\u2019s fun to see Welker White as Hoffa\u2019s wily wife, Jo \u2014 White was the girl with the hat in the coked-up climax of Goodfellas \u2014 along with assorted not-de-aged faces of the actors playing mobsters and union men. But the subplot featuring Frank\u2019s hyper-attentive daughter, Peggy (Lucy Gallina as a girl, Anna Paquin grown up), isn\u2019t woven gracefully into the narrative and sticks out.\n\nThe Irishman (which will have a limited theatrical run beginning November 1 and head to Netflix on November 27) doesn\u2019t fully earn its epic running time. But it\u2019s overlong, it\u2019s not over-scaled. When Scorsese sets out to make an epic \u2014 in, say, The Aviator or Gangs of New York \u2014 he often loses the pulse or goes to too flamboyant of lengths to speed it up. After Raging Bull, his adrenaline was a little suspect, much of it born of real filmmaking passion but some of it spurious, suggesting a chef who snorts a line of coke and dances around a kitchen yelling, \u201cCan I cook!\u201d There\u2019s a faint suggestion here that he regrets some of his past pyrotechnics, that he sacrificed depth for momentum. For Scorsese, the slowing-down in The Irishman is radical, and it pays off in the long series of final scenes in which the characters are too old to move as they once did. They can\u2019t hide inside motion, and so Scorsese doesn\u2019t \u2014 and the upshot is one of his most satisfying films in decades.", "description": "Martin Scorsese\u2019s The Irishman, starring Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Harvey Keitel \u2014 is one of the most satisfying films in decades.
