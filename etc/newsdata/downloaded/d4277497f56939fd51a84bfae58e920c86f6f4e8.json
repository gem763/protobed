He thinks I\u2019m his mum. I\u2019m a part of him and he\u2019s a part of me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve shown people you can have incredible bonds with these creatures. Touch wood, we have never had an accident.\n\n\u2018I wouldn\u2019t want to be a risk to anyone. All my otters have been immaculately behaved. I wouldn\u2019t dream of taking them out otherwise.\n\n\u2018We do shows all over the place. People come from miles away \u2013 especially from Australia and New Zealand. They don\u2019t have otters there.\u2019\n\nIsn\u2019t Rudi sweet? (Picture: Jake McPherson / SWNS)\n\nDaphne raised previous otters with her late husband Martin and their three daughters, who have all now left home.\n\nShe has also campaigned hard alongside big names such as the legendary Sir David Attenborough in years gone by, to urge water companies to clean the country\u2019s rivers. They had become so polluted with the chemical polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) that the wild otter was almost extinct.\n\nIncredibly, Daphne\u2019s actions prompted the late Michael Meacher, who was the environment minister under Tony Blair, to announce plans to phase out PCBs in 2000.\n\nShe said: \u2018We didn\u2019t know anything about otters \u2013 we were just a normal family. But then we wanted to raise awareness about their future.\n\n\u2018We fought so hard for their safety. Clean water is pivotal for the future of otters and all living creatures. Since then [1980], the rivers have visibly improved.\u2019\n\nRudi is always riding on her shoulder (Picture: Jake McPherson / SWNS)\n\nDaphne is now supporting Animal Alerts, a small device which attaches to the front of cars and emits an ultrasonic sound.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis warns creatures like rabbits, dogs and otters not to cross the road as a car is approaching \u2013 potentially saving huge numbers of animals.\n\nShe said: \u2018It keeps them on the verge. Otters like to cross the road at night when they think it\u2019s safe.\u2019\n\nWhen he\u2019s not on Daphne\u2019s shoulders, Rudi, an Asian small-clawed otter, lives in a large cage in the garden \u2013 where other otters can come and say hello.\n\nHe performs in country shows, f\u00eates and children\u2019s parties, including at Kensington Palace.\n\nThe pair have even appeared on the hit Channel 4 TV show \u2018Come Dine With Me\u2019, coming in second.\n\nDaphne also keeps rescued swans, ducks and a goose on her lake.\n\nMORE: Coffee lovers assemble as Nespresso launches its first-ever advent calendar\n\nMORE: Six-year-old boy forgets everything he\u2019s learnt in his short life after being diagnosed with dementia\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "A woman has dedicated her life to looking after otters, and even has one that she takes to the shops with her.", "authors": ["Hattie Gladwell"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_91784420_1572021913.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
