Meat industry fights back as interest grows in plant-based food", "language": "en", "text": "JACKSON, Miss. \u2013 The meat cattle industry has been a growing and profitable industry in the Magnolia State.\n\nBut some feel the state is protecting the industry at all costs -- by imposing tough laws that are choking the plant-based industry.\n\nMississippi has made it illegal for companies who make vegan and vegetarian foods to label their products as \u201cmeat or meat food products.\u201d Lawmakers said the law would prevent consumer confusion between meat alternatives and actual meat.\n\nBut the vegan food makers are fighting back.\n\nThe Institute for Justice, a law firm that litigates cases to limit the size and scope of government, has filed a federal lawsuit against Mississippi on behalf of the Plant Based Foods Association. The suit challenges the constitutionality of the state\u2019s labeling law; claiming the law impedes on vegan food makers First Amendment right to free speech.\n\nThe lead plaintiff in the case is Upton\u2019s Naturals, a Chicago-based vegan food manufacturer. The company makes about a half dozen products that are entirely vegan. However, it labels them with well-known terms like \u201cburger,\u201d \u201cbacon\u201d and \u201cchorizo\u201d so customers know what kind of meat alternatives they\u2019re buying.\n\nAMERICANS CONSUME SAME AMOUNT OF PROCESSED MEAT SINCE 1999, STUDY SHOWS\n\nDaniel Staackman, the company\u2019s founder, said Upton\u2019s Naturals lawsuit against the state is about protecting its right to market its brand with common sense words that its customers are already accustomed to using, as it relates to food.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really the consumers that are going to lose out by having to change these words in a way that they won\u2019t understand,\u201d Staackman said.\n\nIt's a battle playing out all across the country as the makers of vegan food have perfected the taste of artificial meat -- stunning the pork, cattle and even fish industry with lab-grown food that essentially replicates the taste of animal meat.\n\nNow, states are taking issue with the package wording, saying that adding \"meat\" to vegan dishes confuses consumers.\n\nStaackman said he believed the Mississippi law, which recently went into effect on July 1, was simply a ploy to shelter the state\u2019s meat industry.\n\n\u201cThis is really a protectionist move on the part of the meat industry to try to squash our progress,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Mississippi Cattlemen\u2019s Association, a legislative advocate that represents 3,500 beef producers around the state, supported the passage of the state law. The association said the law would ensure fairness in grocery stores against its competitors.\n\nBEEF INDUSTRY FIGHTING BACK AGAINST 'FAKE MEAT'\n\n\u201cWe welcome competition,\u201d said Andy Berry, executive vice president of the Mississippi Cattlemen\u2019s Association. \u201cA level playing field is all we\u2019ve asked for to make sure what you buy is what it is.\u201d\n\nAt least six other states -- including Arkansas, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming -- have passed similar laws prohibiting companies from using meat terminology on the packaging of plant-based foods.\n\nThe laws come at a time when plant-based food companies like \u201cBeyond Burger\u201d and \"Impossible Burger\u201d have meatless products on the market that could be difficult for people to distinguish from actual meat.\n\nHowever, Americans are eating more meat than they have in more than a decade. The average American meat-eater is set to devour nearly 221.5 pounds of meat this year alone, according to the USDA.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBill Pigott, a Republican Mississippi state representative and a member of the Cattlemen\u2019s Association, said his aim in writing Mississippi\u2019s version of the law was to make sure it was clear consumers knew what they\u2019re buying.\n\n\u201cThis was asked for by the cattle producers in Mississippi to clarify labeling laws,\u201d Pigott said. \u201c[It\u2019s] not to stop any sale of any products, just allowing the consumer to know what they\u2019re actually consuming.\u201d\n\nPigott said there was nothing wrong with him sponsoring the law -- though he is still a member of the Mississippi Cattlemen\u2019s Association, he has retired from cattle production and would not personally benefit from the law. In a search of public records, Fox could not find any lobbying efforts or financial ties between Pigott and the Mississippi Cattlemen\u2019s Association.\n\nThe Institute for Justice said consumers are savvy enough to understand what its clients\u2019 labels clearly state.\n\n\u201cCustomers understand that 100 percent vegan, means 100 percent vegan,\u201d attorney Justin Pearson said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the government\u2019s job to sway consumers one way or the other. Customers get to decide what food they want to eat.\n\nUpton\u2019s Naturals said it wasn\u2019t clear how much it would cost the company to re-package it\u2019s products if the meat labeling prohibition is upheld in Mississippi. It would have to consider its options.\n\nThe Cattlemen\u2019s Association said the right to choose would still be alive and well for consumers, but appropriate labels would make things much clearer.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t ban anybody from selling anything they\u2019re selling now,\" Berry said, \"they just have to label it correctly.\u201d", "description": "The state of Mississippi has made it illegal for companies who make vegan or vegetarian foods to label their products as \u201cmeat or meat food products.\u201d", "authors": ["Charles Watson", "Charles Watson Joined Fox News In As A Multimedia Reporter Based In Jackson"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_3937.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-23"}
