We were s****ing ourselves as the car was all we had.\n\n\u2018We came down with the best intentions and started looking for jobs and homes immediately, but didn\u2019t realise how difficult it would be \u2013 without the safety net of a home it\u2019s almost impossible to get benefits and get yourself out of the situation.\n\n\u2018We realised we were on our own.\u2019\n\nIt was during this time that Gylisa Jayne started writing a diary, which provides the basis for Ever the Optimist.\n\n\u2018We were living on two tins of soup a day and a two-litre bottle of water \u2013 it wasn\u2019t pleasant,\u2019 she recalled. \u2018We became so ashamed of how we were living and started to think we had made a huge mistake.\u2019\n\nDespite some passersby being rude, judgmental and even reporting them to the police, they also saw the good side of humanity.\n\nThey\u2019re all super happy now (Picture: Gylisa Jayne Evans /SWNS.COM)\n\nGylisa Jayne said: \u2018In the book I talk about quite a few moments where strangers performed random acts of kindness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018There was a woman who worked at the Child Support Agency, near where we were parked, who kept saying if we needed anything to let her know. One day she gave us a huge parcel of food, filled with all sorts of things. Even chocolate and juice were like luxuries to us by then. It was amazing.\u2019\n\nEventually, things started to improve after Ryan got a job as a delivery driver. After living in the car and surviving on just \u00a315 worth of petrol for two months, the couple ended up getting keys to a new flat.\n\nAnd now, Ryan works as a self-employed builder and the couple married earlier this year.\n\nGylisa added: \u2018We are completely settled.\n\n\u2018Writing my diary got me through being homeless \u2013 it would while away the hours and allowed me to think things could only get better.\n\n\u2018The response to the book has already been incredible. It was a very difficult time but our lives are now wonderful.\u2019\n\nMORE: The world would be a richer place if girls had power\n\nMORE: Bride is savagely mocked for engagement ring that looks like \u2018a squirt of mayo\u2019\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "A mum whose blog went viral when she wrote about being proud to be a 'kept woman' has revealed she was homeless for three months and forced to live in a car.
