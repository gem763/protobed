It serves 19 million customers a year in 16 different countries.\n\nBut Thomas Cook's financial difficulties have mounted over the past year, culminating with the agreement in August of a rescue deal led by Fosun, that would see the Chinese firm back a \u00a3900m refinancing of the 179-year-old British firm.\n\nA final vote on that deal was due to take place this week, but it has been delayed until next Friday in the face of the latest demand for extra stand-by funding.\n\nEarlier this week Thomas Cook said it was \"focused on completing\" the deal and is believed to be negotiating with its banks, bondholders and Fosun in an attempt to keep the rescue on track.\n\nIn May, the operator reported a \u00a31.5bn loss for the first half of the year. It has also issued three profit warnings over the past year and is struggling to reduce its debts.\n\nIt has blamed a series of problems for its profit warnings, including political unrest in holiday destinations such as Turkey, last summer's prolonged heatwave and customers delaying booking holidays due to Brexit.\n\nIt has also suffered from competition from online travel agents and low-cost airlines.\n\nThe winter months can put a strain on travel companies' finances as typically there is less revenue coming in, while suppliers need to be paid for services provided over the high summer season.\n\nThomas Cook is one of the world's largest travel companies. It was founded in 1841 to operate temperance day trips. It now has annual sales of \u00a39bn.\n\nIf the rescue deal goes ahead it would be majority owned by Fosun, which is also a majority shareholder in Wolverhampton Wanderers Football Club and French resort operator Club Med.", "description": "The troubled travel firm must find \u00a3200m in extra contingency funds before banks will agree a deal.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/CDB4/production/_97606625_spainbeachgetty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
