I have deep respect for all the work that has taken place to transform Wells Fargo.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter years of apologies for customer abuses, Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan suddenly steps down\n\nBefore his role at BNY Mellon, Scharf was the CEO of Visa. Before that, he was managing director of One Equity Partners, the private investment arm of JP Morgan Chase & Co. He also served as CEO of Retail Financial Services at JP Morgan Chase and Chief Executive Officer of the retail division of Bank One Corp.\n\nAllen Parker, Wells Fargo\u2019s general counsel, had stepped in as interim CEO after Sloan resigned. Parker will remain in that role under Scharf\u2019s appointment becomes effective on Oct. 21.\n\nSloan\u2019s appeals on behalf of Wells Fargo included apologizing for the opening of millions of fraudulent accounts on behalf of customers without their consent, as well as mistakenly foreclosing on hundreds of clients and repossessing cars belonging to thousands of others. The apology tour often fell short of swaying skeptics.\n\nPlus, in March, Wells Fargo disclosed in a regulatory filing that Sloan had received $18.4 million in compensation in 2018 \u2014 a roughly 5 percent increase from 2017.\n\nThis story will be updated.\n\nAD", "description": "Scharf was formerly the chairman and chief executive of Bank of New York Mellon.", "authors": ["Rachel Siegel", "National Business Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/AhvNPB3NRFEulO0tha2oPMwTH9w=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EIIY5YGXQYI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
