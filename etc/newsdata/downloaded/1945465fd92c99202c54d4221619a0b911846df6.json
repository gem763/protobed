Some locals in the Democratic Republic of Congo were convinced that Ebola didn\u2019t exist. Several treatment centres were attacked and at least one healthcare worker was killed, frustrating efforts to contain the outbreak. Foot and mouth disease reportedly cost the UK tourism industry \u00a37.7 billion owing to tighter controls and traveller fears \u2013 more than the cost to the agriculture sector.\n\nSwine fever crisis\n\nAfrican swine fever, commonly referred to as \"Ebola for pigs\", is a contagious virus that kills up to 100 per cent of infected animals within 20 days. It\u2019s transmitted between pigs by direct contact with an infected animal, its body fluids or indirectly from contaminated objects such as equipment and clothing. It can also be transmitted by ticks, which makes eradication challenging. The virus can survive for more than two years in frozen pig organs but is not transmittable to humans.\n\nQuarantine officials in South Korea erect barricades as a precaution against swine fever. AP\n\nPreviously thought to be under control, the virus has re-emerged and ripped through China\u2019s $US128 billion ($190 billion) pork industry, the world\u2019s largest. On September 9, swine fever was reported to have reached its 10th Asian country, detected in Timor Leste just 650 kilometres and a one hour, 24-minute flight away from Australia. It\u2019s now forecast to wipe out 25 per cent of the world\u2019s pigs, an important source of global protein. While a vaccine is being worked on, there is no known cure.\n\nInvasive pest species are also a bio-threat. According to the Queensland government, fire ants are a \"super pest\". They have the potential to kill calves and small wildlife, damage crops and interfere with harvesting. In 2001, Australia committed $761 million to eradicate a single incursion of red imported fire ants from south-east Queensland, and the outbreak was believed to be linked to sea containers.\n\nShared responsibility\n\nWhile progress is being made, the best path is always prevention. That\u2019s easier said than done. In 2017, global container trade accounted for 60 per cent of the $US12 trillion seaborne trade volumes, or 1.83 billion metric tonnes, up from 102 million metric tonnes in 1980.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBiosecurity is a shared responsibility between governments, industry and society. For most trading countries the legal foundations for the international trading system are World Trade Organisation agreements that include an agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS). The SPS sets out the basic rules of food safety and animal and plant health requirements. It has potential to be abused.\n\nAustralia has some of the world's toughest biosecurity measures. Karleen Minney\n\nAccording to the WTO, \u201cSPS can be a very effective protectionist device and, because of its technical complexity it can be a particularly deceptive and difficult barrier to challenge.\u201d After the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, the resulting sanctions against Russia were reportedly implicated in Russian import bans on a range of Western foods, including kangaroo meat. It was reported that the Russian authorities said they had found residues of growth hormone.\n\nThe World Health Organisation, responsible for directing and coordinating international health within the United Nations system, is actively involved in responding to incidents that involve humans.\n\nIn Australia, the federal, state and territory governments are a party to the Intergovernmental Agreement on Biosecurity to \"strengthen Australia\u2019s biosecurity system through enhanced national collaboration\". Activities are funded through levies such as the $10.02 levy collected per 20-foot (six-metre) container. Other organisations that play important national roles are Plant Health Australia and Animal Health Australia, which outline responsibilities and activities in the event of an incursion.\n\nAustralia\u2019s biosecurity opportunity\n\nBiosecurity isn\u2019t just an existential threat. It\u2019s also a tremendous opportunity to provide assurances of quality and provenance of agriculture and food products and to differentiate regional exports, including tourism. It should also accelerate us towards our goal of lifting domestic agriculture production to $100 billion by 2030 from $60 billion today.\n\nThe technologies that allow for the quantification of physical environments and more detailed risk assessment that we are pushing back on for humanitarian reasons may ironically end up enabling early containment of the next pandemic. Emerging sensor and analytics technologies promise to speed up detection and incident response. Multilateral data-sharing agreements and technologies promise to accelerate the diffusion of responder knowledge. A deeper understanding of genomics promises to accelerate drug and vaccine discovery and development.\n\nAs trade becomes even more networked globally, the biosecurity sector will probably need to reconfigure itself to keep up. Australia has done extraordinarily well with biosecurity, but its biggest opportunity in this crisis may be helping to bring the region together. By leading with higher levels of biosecurity assurance, we will create differentiation, protect our trading future and lift the resilience of our economy \u2013 delivering protection and not protectionism.\n\nAdrian Turner is co-chairman of AustCyber", "description": "Lurking beneath the headlines of trade wars and intellectual property protection is an existential trade-related challenge: biosecurity.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6409%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_109/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d6f795665364faa7322ace35220dff2a8c794ad9", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
