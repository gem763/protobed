First, there is no rule that the full House has to vote to start an impeachment inquiry. And a vote probably wouldn\u2019t change anything. Nearly all House Democrats support an impeachment inquiry, so if they did take a vote, presumably they would all vote to keep it going.\n\n(A senior Democratic House aide told the Fix last week that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has no intention of taking a vote, no matter what demands Trump makes. This person called the argument \u201cpathetic\u201d and \u201cbogus.\u201d)\n\nRepublicans surely know a vote won\u2019t stop Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. So why are they pushing for it anyway?\n\nAD\n\nRepublicans in the House think they can exert more control over the process once it\u2019s formalized by having a chance to call their own witnesses in hearings. But House Democrats control the majority and, thus, the process, so this is a nominal change to how things work now. Democrats could still vote to block the minority party\u2019s witnesses, explains the Los Angeles Times\u2019s Sarah Wire.\n\nAD\n\nIt seems more likely that Republicans\u2019 focus on the process is an attempt to delegitimize House Democrats\u2019 probe in a broad sense. That becomes especially important to do now that there are indications that public opinion is shifting; a new Washington Post-Schar School poll shows that a majority of Americans now support an impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe House did vote on an impeachment inquiry for Presidents Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon. The White House argued that those votes created a precedent the House must now follow. But, again, there is no rule that they have to.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anything at all turns on it,\u201d Josh Chafetz, a constitutional law expert at Cornell University, said in an email to The Fix. \u201cThe House can structure its impeachment inquiry however it wants to. If it wants to kick it off with passing a cameral resolution, it can do that, but it certainly doesn\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThat\u2019s in line with what Pelosi said in an interview with Washington Post columnist Karen Tumulty last week: \u201cWe can if we want, but we don\u2019t have to have it. There\u2019s nothing anyplace that says that we should.\u201d\n\nAsking for a vote is also a negotiating chip Trump can use to agree to cooperate with House investigators. But it\u2019s a small chip. If the House did hold a vote, the vote would almost certainly be approved. It might slow things down by, like, a couple of days. Trump\u2019s battles in the courts to not hand over documents are dragging things out much more effectively.\n\nAD\n\nPlus, the Trump administration has given no indication that if the House held a vote, it would cooperate.\n\nAnother aspect that makes this call for a vote so puzzling is that it could backfire on Republicans.\n\nNearly every day, damaging information on Trump is coming out in this impeachment investigation. Last week, House Democrats released texts between Trump diplomats that showed some were concerned the White House was setting up a quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and Ukraine agreeing to investigate Democrats in the 2016 election (and perhaps Trump\u2019s 2020 potential challenger former vice president Joe Biden).\n\nAD\n\nThroughout all this, House Republicans are largely standing by Trump. What happens if something comes out that makes it no longer tenable for the party to do that? Do Republicans, especially those in potentially vulnerable districts, really want to be on the record opposing this impeachment investigation not knowing what it will ultimately uncover?\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe people who are most afraid of a vote on the floor are the Republicans,\u201d Pelosi told Tumulty. \u201cThat\u2019s why they\u2019re beating their tom-toms like they want it, but they don\u2019t. They have the most to be concerned about because for some of their members to say that we shouldn\u2019t go forward with this is a bad vote.\u201d\n\nFor many reasons, Republicans\u2019 \u201ctake a vote\u201d argument is thin. But that in itself is instructive about the options Republicans and Trump have. Beyond muddying the facts, which Trump and some high-level House Republicans are also willing to do, Republicans don\u2019t have a whole lot in the way of defending Trump right now.\n\nAD", "description": "Even if there were a vote, GOP members would still lose it.", "authors": ["Amber Phillips", "Reporter For The Fix Covering Congress"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/62zYyBrLeK-lebsOd35h3HbiwBs=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KR37SOGZJ5H5BBFUQR2QX4ODVQ", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
