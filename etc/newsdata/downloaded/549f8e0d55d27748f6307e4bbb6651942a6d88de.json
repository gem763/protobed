(AP) \u2014 A pilot with more than 7,000 hours of experience flying a B-17 and his co-pilot were among seven people killed when the bomber crashed and burned at a Connecticut airport, officials said Thursday.\n\nPilot Ernest McCauley, 75, of Long Beach, California, had flown for over 20 years with the educational group that owned the World War II-era plane and was also its safety officer, according to the National Transportation Safety Board.\n\nThe plane carrying 13 people crashed and burned after experiencing mechanical trouble on takeoff Wednesday morning from Bradley International Airport. Five passengers were killed along with McCauley and the co-pilot, Michael Foster, 71, of Jacksonville, Florida, according to the Connecticut Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection.\n\nInvestigators have begun securing evidence, including the engine in which the pilot had reported a problem, NTSB member Jennifer Homendy said at a news conference. As part of the investigation, she said, they also will look into witness reports that work was being done on one or two of the engines prior to takeoff. The plane had last been through a major inspection in January 2019, she said.\n\nAmong the passengers killed was Gary Mazzone, 60, of East Windsor, who was a history and military buff, according to his son, Daniel Mazzone. He didn\u2019t know of his father\u2019s plans to ride the B-17, he said, but knew why he would be interested.\n\n\u201cI think he just wanted to see what it was like to be in the back of a B-17,\u201d Daniel Mazzone said. \u201cHe loved World War II. He loved people who served this country in any capacity.\u201d\n\nMazzone, a father of three children and two stepdaughters, retired in January as a prosecutor\u2019s office inspector and previously was a Vernon police officer for 22 years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all very sad ... and we\u2019re very sad for his family,\u201d Chief State\u2019s Attorney Kevin Kane said. \u201cHe was a good investigator. He was a good inspector. And he was a very good and helpful colleague.\u201d\n\nThe wife of Robert Riddell, an insurance company analyst from East Granby, Connecticut, said she was devastated by the loss of her husband. Robert Riddell had posted a photo from inside the plane just before takeoff.\n\nDebra Riddell was at the airport herself and watched with dread as the plane struggled.\n\n\u201cAs soon as it fell behind the hangar, I just had this really bad feeling in the pit of my stomach. I just sensed that that plane was going to go down. I knew it, was certain of it,\u201d she said.\n\nThe other passengers killed in the flight were James Roberts, 48, of Ludlow, Massachusetts; David Broderick, 56, of West Springfield, Massachusetts; and Robert Rubner, 64, of Tolland, Connecticut.\n\nThe flight engineer Mitchell Melton, 34, of Dalhart, Texas, survived with injuries. Five other passengers on the plane were injured along with Andrew Sullivan, 28, an airport employee who was on the ground near the site of the accident.\n\nBridgeport Hospital officials said that one survivor who arrived in serious condition was upgraded Thursday to fair condition, and that two others there were still in fair condition. All three suffered burns and broken bones.\n\nOne patient injured in the crash remained at Hartford Hospital, officials said.\n\nAn airman with the Connecticut National Guard who was aboard the B-17 bomber helped other passengers escape the flames by using his fire-resistant gloves to open a hatch, officials said Thursday.\n\nThe airman has training in handling emergencies on aircraft and had brought his military-issued gloves on the flight, according to the Guard. The airman was treated at a hospital and has been recovering at home. His name was not released.\n\n\u201cOur thoughts and prayers are with all those affected by this tragic accident,\u201d said Maj. Gen. Francis Evon, adjutant general of the Connecticut National Guard.\n\nThe retired, civilian-registered plane was associated with the Collings Foundation, an educational group that brought its Wings of Freedom vintage aircraft display to the airport this week, officials said.\n\nThe vintage bomber _ also known as a Flying Fortress, one of the most celebrated Allied planes of World War II _ was used to take history buffs and aircraft enthusiasts on short flights, during which they could get up and walk around the loud and windy interior.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board sent a team to investigate.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporters Joseph Frederick and Chris Ehrmann in Windsor Locks and Jennifer McDermott in Providence, Rhode Island, contributed to this report.", "description": "A pilot with more than 7,000 hours of experience flying a B-17 and his co-pilot were among seven people killed when the bomber crashed and burned at a Connecticut airport, officials said Thursday.
