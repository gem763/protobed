They are up in arms that the Trump Energy Department would undo regulations, but Obama didn\u2019t issue the regulations in question until his last day in power.\n\nOn lightbulbs, Democrats show a shallow hypocrisy that reflects a deeper one.\n\nElizabeth Warren, one of the front-runners for the Democratic nomination, got very upset recently when CNN's Chris Cuomo asked her, \u201cDo you think that the government should be in the business of telling you what kind of lightbulb you can have?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh come on, give me a break!\u201d she said. \u201cThis is exactly what the fossil fuel industry hopes we\u2019re all talking about.\"\n\nShe said, \"They want to be able to stir up a lot of controversy around your lightbulbs, around your straws, and around your cheeseburgers when 70% of the pollution, of the carbon that we\u2019re throwing into the air, comes from three industries.\u201d\n\nWe hope the moderators at Thursday night\u2019s Democratic debate ask Warren a follow-up: How can a lightbulb be important enough to outlaw but not important enough to talk about?\n\nIt\u2019s a common tactic of the Left, and on one level it\u2019s just plain old demagoguery. Regularly, we are told that conservatives objecting to lightbulb mandates are obsessing over trivia. Isn\u2019t the \u201cobsession\u201d on the part of the lawmakers who wrote the laws on lightbulbs, and triggering dozens of regulations about which lightbulbs may be bought, sold, imported, and made?\n\nOn another level, coming from lawmakers, it's a bit despotic: We will regulate how you live your life, and if you ask us about it, we'll attack you.\n\nIf lightbulbs are a tiny part of the climate debate, why was there such uproar over the Trump administration\u2019s decision to halt new regulations that were written by the Obama administration but that haven\u2019t gone into effect yet?\n\nThe 2007 energy bill effectively outlawed most traditional incandescent bulbs through efficiency mandates on \u201cgeneral service lamps.\u201d On the last full day of the Obama administration, the Energy Department issued a rule redefining the term \u201cgeneral service lamp\u201d to include specialty bulbs, such as three-way bulbs and chandelier bulbs.\n\nWhy did the Department of Energy play this Orwellian word game? \u201cDOE expects these sales will likely increase since these lamps could be used as replacements for other regulated lamp types,\" the agency explained on January 19, 2017.\n\nIn other words, the Obama administration knew that people appreciate traditional incandescents and would buy the classes of bulbs where traditional incandescents were still allowed. So they changed the rules to deny consumers even that little avenue of choice.\n\nAgain, Democrats proclaim it\u2019s absurd to worry about light bulbs, yet a Democratic administration went on a hunt to sniff out where consumers might still be buying traditional bulbs.\n\nAlso, the media and Democrats are really upset about Trump \u201crolling back\u201d lightbulb rules, but those rules aren\u2019t even in effect yet. If three-way bulbs and chandelier bulbs were such a threat to the climate, why didn\u2019t Obama rope them into the lightbulb mandates earlier? Trump\u2019s \u201cderegulation\u201d is basically preserving the regulatory structure that existed throughout the Obama administration.\n\nThese little hypocrisies point to a bigger hypocrisy.\n\nDemocrats are willing to inconvenience us all in the name of saving the planet, but they\u2019re unwilling to take the most practical steps to actually slash greenhouse gas emissions that are contributing to climate change. Nuclear power is the only feasible zero-carbon source of energy, yet Warren and some of her rivals want to ban it.\n\nSometimes it seems as though the green folk are less interested in saving the planet than they are in telling us how to live, and then telling us to quit complaining.", "description": "Democrats are trying to have it both ways on lightbulbs.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c3d410c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5400x2835+0+141/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediadc.brightspotcdn.com%2F1e%2Feb%2Fe5d034954241bd77820117493828%2Fedited-warren-09112019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
