Less than a year later, women arrived on campus.\n\n\u201cA lot of us were resistant and cussed the idea of women at Sewanee,\u201d said Pete Stringer, a Nashville banker who was a junior when the first women enrolled. \u201cBut then we married them.\u201d\n\nStringer and his wife, Bella Katz Stringer, who was in that first class, have been married for 47 years.\n\n\u201cI can think of at least five of my friends who married Sewanee women, too,\u201d he said.\n\nLaurie Saxton, a 1978 graduate who is now director of news and public relations at Sewanee, said even though the admission of women was controversial, her research shows the \u201cclamor for coeducation was resounding.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe they (board of trustees) viewed coeducation as critical to growing enrollment and getting highly qualified students to attend the college.\u201d Saxton said.\n\nBut there was pushback. According to the university archives, the student newspaper printed a male student\u2019s letter to the editor in 1970, saying the \u201cgirls have invaded our sanctuary\u201d and are \u201ca devastating factor in our community.\u201d\n\nBut when the girls arrived, plenty of the boys were eager to embrace the new world, with reports of more than 150 men filling the lobby of the girls\u2019 dorm on the first day, all looking for a date.\n\nWith a ratio of eight men to one woman, some surmised the women enrolled to find a husband, or, as they joked, \u201cto get her MRS.\u201d\n\nBut one feisty freshmen, was quoted as saying: \u201cIf we were looking for husbands, we\u2019d have chosen an easier school.\u201d\n\nAlthough the decision to admit women to colleges might have seemed socially progressive, the bottom line was that it made financial sense.\n\nAlbert Gooch, director of admissions from 1970-1983, said the overall applicant pool had gotten smaller and the popularity of same-sex schools had waned. It was \u201ccritically important for successful liberal arts colleges to not be same-sex anymore,\u201d he said.\n\nThat first year, there were 82 first-year female students and 21 transfers. By 1971, 16% of Sewanee students were women. Ten years later, they made up 43% of the student body. In recent years, it has been about half men, half women, with this fall\u2019s enrollment counting 912 women in a total 1,763 students.\n\nBy all accounts, what some called the \u201cincursion of women\u201d brought challenges to Sewanee\u2019s historically all male campus, which was founded in 1857 by clergy and lay delegates from southern Episcopal dioceses.\n\nWhile classroom and dormitory assignments and basics like dining hall access seemed to be adequately anticipated, the administration neglected to take into account crucial courtesies, such as having women\u2019s restrooms in classroom buildings.\n\nThere was no women\u2019s locker room in the athletic center, no female varsity sports, and the physical education classes for women were limited to coed sports like tennis, swimming and bowling.\n\n\u201cThey were not really prepared for us,\u201d said Anna Durham Windrow, who was in the first class.\n\nDr. Jacqueline Schaefer, who taught French from 1967-2003 and was one of only three full-time female professors in 1969, said it was not just the female students the university was unprepared for. She said, in addition to no ladies\u2019 room for women faculty, there was no enrollment in the retirement program benefit, and women were barred from the all-male faculty club.\n\nThe early coeds, whose admission scores were said to be higher than their male counterparts, made an immediate mark on the academic life at the university, with members of that first class being initiated into Phi Beta Kappa and other honors organizations.\n\n\u201cI would venture to say the women were in the top 25 percent of the class,\u201d Stringer said. \u201cThe women\u2019s scores and grades lifted the boat.\u201d\n\nThe academic and leadership achievement has continued. Six of the nine Rhodes Scholars Sewanee has produced in the last 50 years have been women. And this year the two most prominent student organizations have women presidents.\n\nAt a recent gathering with seven members of that pioneering class, the women thanked Sewanee for an education, lifelong friendships and a love of learning.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always thought that having to navigate the boys club culture at Sewanee turned out to be solid preparation for my career,\u201d Windrow said. She is a long-time lobbyist, was senior adviser to former Gov. Phil Bredesen, and now owns Windrow Phillips Group, a government relations firm.\n\n\u201cConfidence, resilience and persistence. I learned those lessons because there were not many of us, but together we changed the history of the university,\u201d Morgan Van Zandt Merrill said. \u201cMy grandmother, who had been a long-time supporter of Sewanee, called me on the phone after I was accepted and said, \u2018This is a unique opportunity.\u2019 \u2026 She was right. How fortunate we were to be pioneers.\u201d\n\nElliott Wallace McNiel said the perseverance and tolerance she learned at Sewanee served her well in her career in trade and professional association management, as well as her role as a mother.\n\n\u201cWhen my daughters came along, I taught them to be strong participants in life, to never sit on the sidelines but always get up and take a swing. I wanted them to \u2026 never let anyone tell them they couldn\u2019t do something because they were a girl,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen I arrived as a 17-year-old freshman at Sewanee in fall 1971, women were still in the clear minority.\n\nMy dorm, Cleveland Hall, an old-style residence hall with communal bathrooms, had been converted from a male dorm simply by placing evergreen schefflera plants in the urinals and proclaiming it a women\u2019s dorm.\n\nMy Episcopalian parents loved Sewanee but were skeptical because they didn\u2019t think it was \u201csettled\u201d for women. They were right, but that was part of the allure.\n\nI thrived on the challenge and sense of pioneering that came with being among the first women. I reveled in the gorgeous mountaintop setting and was enthralled with the longstanding traditions, like the Order of Gownsmen, and the close relationships with professors.\n\nLooking back, I am sure my Sewanee experience helped prime me for my early days in the newspaper business, where I was again in the midst of a man\u2019s world and realized, like at Sewanee, I had to work harder and act smarter to succeed.\n\nLike so many of the women in the first class, I believe being successful socially and academically at Sewanee gave me a confidence I don\u2019t think I would have gotten on other college campuses.\n\nA reunion for Sewanee\u2019s women is set for homecoming weekend Oct. 31-Nov. 3, with a panel of Sewanee women from every decade, a Skirts and Gowns exhibit, a gala and conversations with students.\n\nThe university was recently named by U.S. News as #No. 43 among liberal arts college, and a \u201cbest value college\u201d for 2020. It was also named by the Princeton Review as being the #No. 8 most beautiful campus in the country and was ranked #No. 19 for best career services.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "\"It's safe to say that in the last five decades, Sewanee got a lot more than it bargained for when the board of trustees decided to admit female students,\" Vice Chancellor John McCardell Jr. wrote in the summer 2019 Sewanee magazine. \"Women have changed the University of the South - for the better - in as many ways as Sewanee changes its students over four years.\"", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mary Hance", "The Tennessean"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/13/exchange-college_coed_celebration_91806_c0-137-3300-2062_s1200x700.jpg?b8d17fcc5445bc61e64899c581368704c503e168", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
