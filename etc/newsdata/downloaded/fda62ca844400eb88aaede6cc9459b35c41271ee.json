It adorns McDonald\u2019s restaurants across the globe, to the point where \u201cThe Golden Arches\u201d has become all but synonymous with McDonald\u2019s itself. (Did you know McDonald\u2019s actually isn\u2019t the biggest fast food chain in the world, though?)\n\nHowever, there\u2019s one McDonald\u2019s that forgoes that famous yellow color in its logo in favor of a light bluish-green. In Sedona, Arizona, the only arches you\u2019ll see are turquoise!\n\nDon\u2019t worry, there\u2019s a reason for the color change\u2014and it\u2019s pretty funny. The city of Sedona, located in the center of Arizona, is famous for its stunning natural beauty\u2014namely, its mountainous landscape of red rock. Because of said landscape, there are rules in place for buildings in Sedona, to make sure that no structure intrudes too much on the surrounding natural scenery. When the McDonald\u2019s was built there in 1993, city officials believed that a bright yellow M would do just that. They claimed that gold would clash with the surrounding red rocks, and opted for a more pleasing, soft blue. You read that right\u2014the arches are blue because gold didn\u2019t match the city\u2019s (natural) decor.\n\nWhatever the reason, though, the color-change certainly makes this McDonald\u2019s stand out. In fact, these unique not-so-golden arches have become an essential tourist destination for Sedona travelers. (Here are some more must-see unusual restaurants around the world.)\n\nIn every way besides the giant M, though, this McDonald\u2019s is just like any other\u2014full of guilty-pleasure burgers, Happy Meals, and addictive fries. By the way, this is the real reason McDonald\u2019s fries are so delicious!\n\nSign up here to get INSIDER's favorite stories straight to your inbox.", "description": "This city opted for bright blue because it was believed the yellow color would clash with the surrounding scenery.", "authors": ["Meghan Jones", "Reader'S Digest"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5aa198137708e9364e30e195?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2018-03-08"}
