While entirely comfortable in the fashionable world of Paris, he is equally adept at being off-grid.\n\nDon\u2019t even think about trying to track him down off-season. He\u2019ll be in a desert with his phone switched off, hanging out with some creature you probably never knew existed.\n\nI know this. I used to consult for the United Nations\u2019 ITC Ethical Fashion Initiative and, while he was still in his old job as menswear designer at Louis Vuitton, I called on Jones in order to persuade him to use cloth woven by marginalised artisans in Burkina Faso.\n\n\u201cDo they work anywhere near the habitat of the hamadryas baboon?\u201d he asked. Which remains the least expected question I have ever received on planet fashion.\n\nOf course, all of us know we only have one planet. What keeps Jones awake at night is animals becoming extinct, specifically tigers, which he adores. This is why I am phoning him when he is somewhere north of Bangkok on a moving train.\n\nJones is aboard the Tiger Express, aka the glamorous Eastern & Oriental Express, which has been renamed, for one journey only in aid of Save Wild Tigers, to raise awareness that, unless we wise up, the days of wild tigers are numbered.", "description": "When Dior Homme creative director Kim Jones isn't designing luxury menswear and dressing celebrities, he's trying to stop the extinction of animals.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3921%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_681%2C$y_343/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/462b5cec26ef17dbc5ae3f4b912a370dd777e1ec", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
