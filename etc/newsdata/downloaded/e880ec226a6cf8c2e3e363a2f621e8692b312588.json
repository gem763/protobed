It replaced the former Medicines Control Council and the Directorate of Radiation Control.\n\nThe matters for investigation date back to January 2015.\n\n\n\nThe terms of reference of the investigation include having the SIU look into any alleged \"serious maladministration in connection with the affairs of the SAHPRA,\" the proclamation read. The SIU must also investigate allegations of \"improper or unlawful\" conduct by employees of the regulator.\n\nThe investigation will also cover whether certain sections of the Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act. This includes section 17 \u2013 which has to do with employees of a public body unlawfully scoring a private interest in a contract or investment connected to the public body; section 20 \u2013 which has to do with an individual unlawfully benefiting through corrupt or unlawful activities and section 21- which has to do with conspiring or attempting to involve another person in an offence.\n\nFinally, the SIU will investigate allegations of \"unlawful or improper\" conduct by any person which caused or may cause \"serious harm\" to the \"interests of the public\".\n\nThe maladministration relates to the authorisation of the sale of unregistered medicines or medical devices, including in vitro diagnostic medical devices and licensing. The SIU will also look into the causes of the maladministration, the proclamation read.\n\nSAHPRA in turn issued a statement on Saturday, throwing its weight behind Ramaphosa's proclamation.\n\n\n\nAccording to SAHPRA, in February 2019 it had received reports of alleged fraudulent activity implicating \"a small sector of the authority and an external stakeholder,\" the statement read. SAHPRA\u2019s acting CEO, the board and the Health Minister had reported the allegations to the SIU.\n\nSAHPRA did not name the those involved or give details on the fraudulent activities.\n\n\"Core to SAHPRA's success is ethical conduct and good governance. All allegations of misconduct involving either internal or external stakeholders will be thoroughly investigated and responded to,\" said Professor Helen Rees, board chairperson.\n\nActing CEO Portia Nkambule said the organisation is in the process of rebuilding its regulatory systems to \"improve efficiency, transparency and accountability.\" This includes developing appropriate communication channels for complaints such as unethical and criminal behaviour.", "description": "President Cyril Ramaphosa has issued a proclamation for the SIU to look into allegations of maladministration at the SA Health Products Regulatory Authority.", "authors": ["Lameez Omarjee"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/3778/f893e81403fc4cf68175c0de98d77e56.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
