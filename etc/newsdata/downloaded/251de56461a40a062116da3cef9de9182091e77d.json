In the run-up to the 2016 local government elections, I realised we had to break out of the Western Cape. I really believe I took the party as far as I could. Leaders really do have a shelf life. And I thought, knowing the kind of person Mmusi was, that he had the charisma and the dynamism to take us to the next level. And that\u2019s precisely what happened in 2016,\u201d she said.\n\nShe also confirmed that, after the May 8 polls, several senior leaders approached her about forming a breakaway party, but she declined, arguing that it was better to \u201crevive the DA\u201d.\n\nThe former Western Cape premier also insisted that she had no ambitions to take over the top job and pledged her support to Maimane should she be elected.\n\nRead: Maimane: \u2018I have nothing to hide, they are running a campaign to discredit me\u2019\n\nWhen asked if she had faith in Maimane\u2019s leadership, Zille said: \u201cI have faith that we can fix the party internally and the first step is for the leadership to gel so that the party can start growing again. The role of the council chairperson is not to change leadership. The only structure that can get rid of a leader is the federal congress, or if the leader resigns.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in a separate interview with Rapport, Maimane conceded that his relationship with Zille had become strained.\n\nRead: Various senior leaders approached me: Zille to contest DA chair\n\n\u201cWe have had a difficult relationship in the past. But, for us, the focus is on the future. Let the delegates decide on the future of the DA,\u201d Maimane said.\n\n\u201cThe position is a very important one in the DA and the congress. It\u2019s not a personal issue for me, it\u2019s more important for the DA. Whether I stay or not, it will be important for the DA to focus on the future. If we want to make the DA a narrow, minority party, that would be dangerous to South Africa\u2019s goals.\u201d\n\nDA leader in KwaZulu-Natal Zwakele Mncwango told City Press that, while there was time to be convinced otherwise, his vote for Selfe\u2019s successor would be going to Trollip.\n\n\u201cWe need someone who can really hold the centre. In my personal assessment, I believe that Athol will hold the centre. We need unity in the organisation \u2013 the infighting doesn\u2019t help anyone. Athol and Thomas have not deviated from the 2018 values that were adopted, and that is the most important thing for me that makes them, in my view, the two to be considered,\u201d Mncwango said.\n\nHe added that he was \u201csurprised\u201d by Zille\u2019s decision to stand, but that there was nothing prohibiting her from doing so and that she remained a senior leader in the organisation.\n\nAnother provincial leader told City Press that they felt that Zille\u2019s comeback was unnecessary.\n\nMaimane\u2019s position got shaky when he took Zille on regarding her colonialism tweets.\n\n\u201cHonestly, what she is doing is dictatorship of a special kind. It is as if she is convinced that the party cannot succeed without her. She believes that she made [former DA parliamentary leader] Lindiwe [Mazibuko] and Mmusi, and that things won\u2019t move without her. She has really overstated her importance.\u201d\n\nThe leader added that they believed Zille had made a grave miscalculation in believing that she would return to the same party that she left in 2015.\n\n\u201cThings are different now \u2013 she has her supporters, but they are in the minority. Most of us have bought into Mmusi\u2019s vision of an inclusive South Africa, and we won\u2019t just lie down and let that work be thrown away.\u201d\n\nApart from the election of Selfe\u2019s successor, other key matters that will take centre stage at the party\u2019s federal council on October 18 include the report from the review panel and the inevitable discussion of an early conference.\n\nThe panel, which is headed by the party\u2019s former chief strategist, Ryan Coetzee, also included former party leader Tony Leon and founder of Capitec Bank, Michiel le Roux, and will be making its findings known to the highest decision-making body between congresses.\n\nThe panel was mandated to do a nationwide consultation on the party and its structures following its dismal performance at this year\u2019s elections, where the party shed about 400 000 votes.\n\nCity Press has learnt that among the proposals made to the panel were radical reforms to structures in the party, including the composition of the top brass.\n\nThis includes the disbandment and restructuring of the federal legal commission to allow a new, more efficient system that would also delegate some powers to provinces, doing away with deputy chairpersons, giving more powers to provinces, doing away with the position of the federal executive chair and doing away with the position of chief executive officer.\n\nOn the policy side, the sticking point will be around race being used as a proxy in the party\u2019s alternative to the broad-based BEE system, a discussion that has bitterly divided senior leaders and spilt out into the public arena.\n\n\n\nMncwango told City Press that he did not want to pre-empt the outcomes of the panel, but insisted that it would be crucial for the party to continue to recognise that those who were historically disadvantaged were black.\n\n\u201cIf we agree that there is a painful past and we need a future for all of us, you can\u2019t ignore the past and how the majority \u2013 who are black \u2013 were treated. If we ignore that the majority of South Africans are landless and locked out of the mainstream economy, then we will all \u2013 across all races \u2013 be in trouble. We can\u2019t allow the majority to be frustrated, it is a risk to peace in the country. No review can take us forward if it seeks to ignore the imbalance of the past,\u201d the provincial leader said.\n\nOn the likely resuscitation of the calls for an early congress, Mncwango said that he did not feel it was necessary.\n\n\u201cIf we agree that we need to change the constitution, then, yes, we can talk about an early congress. However, changing leadership is not a change in terms of policy direction. The leader leads based on policy agreed on by the 2018 congress. There are many people who contributed to us not doing well in this year\u2019s elections. Changing one person won\u2019t change everything.\u201d\n\nHe also warned against setting an ANC-like precedent, where leaders do not finish their terms, and creating a culture that could not be reversed.\n\nMaimane\u2019s position got shaky when he took Zille on regarding her colonialism tweets.\n\nDivisions became even more entrenched in the party over the handling of former Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille\u2019s exit from the party, the fallout over the wording of the redress policy and, finally, the electoral failure.\n\nWhile some in the party had begun talking about ousting Maimane soon after this year\u2019s elections, that plan was foiled by the failure to find a candidate to contest the party leader.\n\nThe fresh bid to oust him could result in an early congress taking place next year, where he would most likely seek re-election.\n\nNames that have been bandied about to contest him include Trollip, chief whip John Steenhuisen and Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba.\n\nMaimane also told Rapport that it was incorrect to say that he was fighting for his survival.\n\n\u201cPeople say I\u2019m fighting for my career. I\u2019m more focused on political direction. And I will serve that purpose and direction. Whether I\u2019m inside or outside the DA, that remains my mission. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m worried [because] I\u2019m trying to hold on to a job, I am worried because there is a vision here that is seriously under threat,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cDA members can see we\u2019re driven by the future. So stories are being made up by newspapers, but I\u2019m not worried about that. They made false accusations against me. And I placed the facts before the organisation. I am not going to be prosecuted by newspapers. I am accountable and subjected myself to an investigation by the DA.\u201d", "description": "As pressure mounts for him to be removed as leader and opposing camps gear up for a divisive and damaging clash, Maimane warns attempts to turn the DA into a \u2018narrow, minority party\u2019 would be dangerous for the country.", "authors": ["S Thembile Cele", "Waldimar Pelser", "Jacob Rooi"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9440/f6c437f81bbc40a29677966044c25aa2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
