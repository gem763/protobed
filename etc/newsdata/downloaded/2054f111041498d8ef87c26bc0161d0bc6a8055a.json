I find it hard to imagine how months of televised hearings into a widely hated president\u2019s comprehensive corruption could help him, but I can\u2019t see the future. Perhaps impeachment in the House without removal in the Senate would allow Trump to convince some voters he\u2019s been exonerated, though so does the failure to impeach him at all.\n\nPolls show that impeachment doesn\u2019t have majority support, so there\u2019s a political risk for Democrats in trying to lead public opinion rather than follow it. But surely there\u2019s also a risk in appearing weak and irresolute. Already, frustration with Pelosi in the Democratic base is threatening to curdle into despair. \u201cI see the grass-roots activists who helped build the wave last year really wondering what they built that wave for,\u201d Ezra Levin, co-founder of the progressive group Indivisible, told me.\n\nIn the end, our system offers no mechanism besides impeachment to check a president who operates like a mob boss. It\u2019s true that Democrats will remove Trump only by beating him in 2020, but he is already cheating in that election, just as he did in 2016, and paying no price for it.\n\nA formal impeachment process would, if nothing else, give new weight to Democratic claims when they go to court to enforce subpoenas or pry loose documents the administration is trying to hide. It would show that Democrats are serious when they say that Trump\u2019s behavior is intolerable, and potentially allow them to seize control of the day-to-day narrative of this rancid presidency. Trump does not want to be impeached \u2014 a Monday Politico headline says, \u201cTrump\u2019s team is trying to stop impeachment before it starts.\u201d It\u2019s hard to imagine why any Democratic leader would assist them.", "description": "The House speaker\u2019s hesitation on impeachment empowers a lawless president.", "authors": ["Michelle Goldberg"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/23/opinion/32goldbergSub/32goldbergSub-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
