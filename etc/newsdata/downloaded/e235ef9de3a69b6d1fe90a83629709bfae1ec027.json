(Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)\n\nAs increasingly large and frequent protests have flooded the District\u2019s streets in recent years, federal officials have searched for ways to offset the cost of supporting such demonstrations.\n\nThe National Park Service last year floated a proposal that would alter protest regulations and require organizers to repay the federal government for the security costs. Earlier this month, Rep. Jim Banks (R-Ind.) announced he was crafting legislation to hold protesters arrested during unpermitted demonstrations liable \u201cfor police overtime and other fees related to the action.\u201d\n\nBut both proposals are scant on dollar amounts.\n\nPutting organizers on the hook for the costs of policing could mean invoices in the tens of thousands of dollars, according to U.S. Park Police budgets obtained by The Washington Post through the Freedom of Information Act. That\u2019s enough to price most activists out of protesting altogether, according to experts and activists awaiting a decision from the Park Service.\n\n\u201cIf someone called me to say \u2018I want to have a protest\u2019 and I said, \u2018Cool, the Park Service is going to charge you $150,000 for security,\u2019 they would hang up the phone,\u201d said Samantha Miller, an organizer with D.C. Action Lab, a company that helps out-of-towners plan and organize demonstrations in Washington. \u201cThere are already a lot of preexisting fees that organizers get asked to pay. Add in something like a security fee, and there\u2019s just no way most people or organizations would be able to afford it.\u201d\n\n[Organizing a rally on the Mall?

(Astrid Riecken/For The Washington Post)\n\nTo obtain a permit for a protest in the District, organizers typically are required to provide a number of amenities to demonstrators, most of which cost money, Miller said. They include, but are not limited to, toilets, medical tents, cooling stations for hot days and audiovisual equipment for large demonstrations.\n\nFor a protest like the People\u2019s Climate March \u2014 a rally in which tens of thousands of people marched from the Capitol to the White House \u2014 groups already can expect to stare down a budget of more than $100,000, Miller said.\n\n\u201cYou already need to have a certain amount of access to funds to try to get a permit for a certain size protest,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThat\u2019s already a huge burden.\u201d\n\nThe Park Police, which patrols demonstrations in some of the most popular rally points in the city \u2014 including the Mall and Lafayette Square \u2014 has requested hundreds of thousands of dollars in emergency funding over the past two years to support such events.\n\nIn 2017, when the first Women\u2019s March on Washington flooded streets with a crush of women wearing pink pussy-hats, Park Police requested $86,846 to cover what they thought would be a rally of about 200,000 people, federal documents show. The crowd that showed up the day after President Trump\u2019s inauguration was, by most estimates, much larger.\n\n\n\nProtesters walk during the Women\u2019s March on Washington in January 2017. (Mario Tama/Getty Images)\n\nThe anti-gun violence March for Our Lives in 2018 cost Park Police about $153,596 to secure the youth-led demonstration, which drew hundreds of thousands of demonstrators to Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nPark Police spent about $77,508 on security later that year for the Unite the Right 2 rally, in which a small group of white nationalists gathered near the White House as thousands of counterprotesters took to the streets to meet them.\n\nD.C. police, public works and other city agencies, meanwhile, spent roughly $2.2 million to accommodate the Unite the Right 2 demonstration, according to estimates released by the mayor\u2019s office. The District used a federal fund that exists to offset the cost of being the nation\u2019s capital to pay for the protest.\n\nPark Police did not provide numbers for other large-scale demonstrations, saying the agency doesn\u2019t have specific cost breakdowns for all events.\n\nOfficials with March for Our Lives and the Women\u2019s March declined to say how much they spent to put on those demonstrations.\n\nCivil rights organizations, as well as those on both sides of the political spectrum, have voiced opposition to the Park Service proposal.\n\n\u201cThe government can\u2019t, without violating the First Amendment, impose costs on demonstrators based on how much security they\u2019re going to need,\u201d said Art Spitzer, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s D.C. office.\n\nThe Park Service requires protests of at least 25 people to obtain a permit to protest on federal land \u2014 including green space downtown, the Mall, Freedom Plaza, federal buildings and national monuments. D.C. police ask that demonstrations that will close streets also get a permit from the city, although unpermitted demonstrations are common.\n\nBefore the Park Service will issue a permit to a group or individual, the agency must be satisfied that safety and security requirements will be met. That can include requiring groups to have a setup and teardown crew or ground cover to protect grass.\n\n[Activists launch full-court press against new Park Service rules that would charge protest fees]\n\n\u201cOn what they call the \u2018Tier 1 grass\u2019 on the Mall, we\u2019ve gotten quotes of $180,000 just for ground cover,\u201d Miller said. \u201cIt can get really expensive really fast.\u201d\n\nGroups short on cash often find ways to meet requirements on the cheap, Miller said, leaning on volunteers instead of hired hands, or opting to move the demonstration from a prime spot \u2014 like a grassy area on the Mall \u2014 to a space with fewer restrictions, like the concrete block of Freedom Plaza.\n\nOne organization that put on a counterprotest at the Unite the Right 2 rally built a stage from plywood the morning of the event because organizers couldn\u2019t afford to rent one.\n\n\u201cYou can do something extremely powerful on a low budget, but you have to find creative workarounds,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThen there are some things you just have to have \u2014 Porta Potties, for example.\u201d\n\nThe Park Service last year posed the question that roiled civil rights groups and alarmed activists: Should the government seek to recover the money it spends on supporting protests in Washington? The biggest expenditure, by far, officials said, is policing.\n\nMembers of Congress weighed in. So, too, did more than 180,000 people, as well as several l iberal and conservative groups, about the proposal\u2019s impact on the public\u2019s ability to exercise its First Amendment rights.\n\nThe Park Service\u2019s acting director, Dan Smith, has said the agency received more than 71,000 \u201csubstantive\u201d responses during a public comment period, including multi-page letters of opposition from civil rights groups like the ACLU.\n\nSmith told lawmakers the Park Service likely would make a decision by the end of summer. But as of the first week of fall, agency spokesman Mike Litterst said, no decision has been reached.\n\n[Pressure builds as National Park Service considers proposals to change how protests are done in D.C.]\n\nAbout 750 First Amendment demonstrations converge on the Mall annually, according to the Park Service. Large rallies, such as the Women\u2019s March and March for Life, often require additional support from Park Service personnel and Park Police to ensure safety and to limit harm to federal land.\n\nThe agency does not track how much it spends to support demonstrations, although Litterst said, on average, processing permits alone costs the Park Service about $700,000 annually in staff time.\n\nSmith said the agency\u2019s budget, which had been cut to 2010 levels despite having 28 new parks and 5 million additional acres of land to oversee, has been stretched in trying to support such events. The cost of those demonstrations, he said, has been \u201cunbelievable.\u201d\n\nAs a result, the agency has dipped into emergency funds.\n\nIt should be up to Congress to better equip the Park Service to support the growing interest in activism, Spitzer said, not citizens.\n\n\u201cDemonstrations are part of the cost of running a government,\u201d he said. \u201cJust like they have to repair the roads because people drive on them, demonstrations have certain costs and that\u2019s just part of why we pay taxes. That\u2019s something that people have the right to do in a free society, just as much as they have the right to drive on the roads.\u201d\n\nBut Banks, the congressman who represents Indiana\u2019s 3rd Congressional District, said some protesters should repay police costs.\n\nHe announced about a week ago, after police arrested 32 climate change protesters who blocked D.C. traffic, that his constituents shouldn\u2019t have to foot the bill for unpermitted protests in the District.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s becoming a common occurrence in Washington, D.C., to have protests like the ones earlier this week where the law was broken, where arrests were made and the taxpayers are on the hook for police overtime associated with the protest,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cProtesting is certainly an American virtue and a right . . . but Washington, D.C. coffers have been drained and Congress has been allocating additional funding from the federal treasury to afford to take care of protests like this one.\u201d\n\nCongress allocated about $13 million this year to the District in the fund that offsets the costs of being the nation\u2019s capital. Funding for an emergency police presence at large-scale demonstrations can be taken out of the fund, although it isn\u2019t clear how much the District pays to process arrests at unpermitted demonstrations.\n\nBanks said his proposal was inspired by a Pennsylvania bill that sought to recoup police overtime costs from protesters. The legislation was, upon its introduction in 2017, described by the ACLU as \u201calmost certainly unconstitutional.\u201d At least 18 other states have considered similar measures.\n\nThough he said he understands the \u201chighly charged political atmosphere of Washington, D.C.,\u201d Banks added that he supports the Park Service effort to recoup costs of increasingly common demonstrations.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s what the National Park Service is learning, too \u2014 that there\u2019s only a limited amount of resources,\u201d he said.\n\nSpitzer said the ACLU and other civil rights groups remain poised to fight back against legislation that seeks to impose fees on protesters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly no more justifiable than charging every tourist who comes to D.C. a $100 fee for the cost of picking up their litter,\u201d Spitzer said.\n\nRead more:\n\nPerspective: A National Park Service move that\u2019s completely un-American and unconstitutional\n\nLiberal, conservative organizations unite against National Park Service proposal to charge protest fees\n\nPerspective: How the Park Service plans to help Trump keep protesters off his lawn\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Policing efforts at large demonstrations, like the March for Our Lives and Unite the Right 2 rallies, cost tens of thousands of dollars, documents show.", "authors": ["Marissa J.
