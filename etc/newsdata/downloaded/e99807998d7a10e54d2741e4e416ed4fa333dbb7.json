Teams are more technical than at the previous World Cup.'\n\nCheslin Kolbe thinks there will be an increase in wingers who are smaller in stature\n\nShaun Edwards, the Wales defence coach, shocked some French journalists when he told Wales players to 'f***ing smash 'em' at open training on Wednesday.\n\nEdwards is to join Les Bleus next year - and one French journalist watching said, 'He might teach France what work is!'\n\nDespite being banned for the remainder of the World Cup, subject to appeal, Ireland centre Bundee Aki is still searching for a razor-sharp edge.\n\nThe centre, who was shown a red card for a high shot against Samoa, spent Wednesday afternoon in a samurai sword shop in Tokyo.\n\nBundee Aki's World Cup is over after he was given a red card in the game against Samoa\n\nAn appeal has been launched after Sam Matavesi, the Fiji hooker, had his World Cup kit stolen on his return home to England.\n\nThe forward's car was broken into in London and he lost three World Cup jerseys, his World Cup cap and other personal belongings.\n\nPlease Share, any help would be amazing!! pic.twitter.com/a3vnrXNezS \u2014 Samuel Matavesi (@samuelmatavesi7) October 14, 2019\n\nChefs in Oita prepared a stunning cake to mark the 30th birthday of Wales No 10 Dan Biggar.\n\nIt was made in the shape of an immaculate rugby stadium and presented in front of his team-mates.
