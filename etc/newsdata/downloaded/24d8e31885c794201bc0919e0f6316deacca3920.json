We are not drunk on our success, we want to continue to expand the bandwidth, draw people into the party.\"\n\nHe added the party's biggest \"wildcard\" was its leader Jo Swinson, who he claimed has so far been massively underestimated and had had huge success in the short time she has been leading the party.\n\nElaborating on his decision not to stand again in Streatham, Mr Umunna also told The Independent: \"I'm not going to beat around the bush, I did not relish the prospect of having to fight a vile and really unpleasant campaign against the new Streatham Labour Party.\"\n\n\"The old Streatham Labour Party that I joined has gone. Of the 2,500 Labour Party members in Streatham, less than 500 were the members who selected me. I didn't really relish having to put myself through that, my family through that and my staff through that.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

It\u2019s time for a change and someone I know can provide that leadership \u2013 Jo Swinson.\u201d\n\nIn a swipe at Mr Johnson\u2019s suggestion that he might not obey anti-no-deal Brexit legislation and Tory jibes at judges, Mr Umunna will say that Lib Dems demand that governments \u201crespect the rule of law with an independent judiciary ... free from abuse and attack by the executive\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is the Britain we know and love, and Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and the other peddlers of hate and division had better know that this is what we will fight for at the coming election,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIt is our job to make sure this country\u2019s heartbeat is liberal and internationalist, not nationalist, populist and authoritarian. It is the new fault line in British politics and we know where we stand.\u201d", "description": "Chuka Umunna has claimed the Liberal Democrats could\u00a0win up to\u00a0200 seats at the next general election just moments after he made his debut speech to party members.\u00a0 Mr Umunna, the Lib Dems' foreign affairs spokesman, also made clear the\u00a0party would support an election once an extension to the Brexit deadline has been secured, insisting: \"We are not shy\".", "authors": ["Ashley Cowburn"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/16/13/chuka-umunna.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
