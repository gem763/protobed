James on June 5, 1875, is one of more than 300 lots that will go to auction on Oct. 23 as part of Bonhams Sale of Fine Books & Manuscripts in New York. The letter, as well as others from the likes of Jane Austen, Albert Einstein, and John Adams, will be on public display starting Saturday.\n\n\u201cJames letters are very rare in the market, with all but a few examples with the family,\u201d Darren Sutherland, a Bonhams specialist of books and manuscripts, said in a statement.\n\nJames (who lived from 1847 to 1882) took up his pen in response to a Mr. Flood, who had accused the outlaw and his brother, Frank, of stealing a horse from Dr. William J. Yates. However, James felt a debt of gratitude toward the doctor, who was one of the first to arrive after his family farm in Kearney, Mo., was raided earlier in 1875. During the raid, his mother, Zerelda Samuel, lost her right arm and his 9-year-old half-brother Archie was killed.\n\n\u201cDo you suppose if we were thieves we would Steal a horse from one that has been so kind to Mother as Dr Yates has no far from it...and they are no men in Mo. who scurn horse thieves more than we do,\u201d James wrote. \u201cIf you value your life you had better retrace your Slander.\u201d\n\nWith that, he signed it \u201cJesse W. James.\u201d\n\nAn 1813 letter from Jane Austen to her sister, Cassandra. Bonhams\n\n\u201cThis is everything you\u2019d want in a Jesse James letter\u2014the protest of innocence and the simmering threat,\u201d according to Sutherland. It is expected to sell for between $200,000 and $300,000.\n\nAnother highlight of the auction is the autograph collection from the Dodge family. William Dodge Sr. co-founded the Phelps Dodge Company in New York in 1833, becoming one of Wall Street\u2019s most successful merchants, according to Bonhams. His son, William E. Dodge Jr. , expanded the business, and both were prominent philanthropists.\n\nThe family collection includes papers from over 200 years of American and world history, as well as literature. Letters from Presidents Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses S. Grant are part of the sale, as well as four from Albert Einstein.\n\nOne highlight of the Dodge collection is a letter from Jane Austen to her sister, Cassandra, in 1813.\n\nAusten, who lived from 1775 to 1817, uses the word \u201ccoze,\u201d or chat, in the missive to her sister, writing, \u201cWe are now all four of us young Ladies sitting round the Circular Table in the inner room writing our Letters, while the two Brothers are having a comfortable coze in the room adjoining\u2026.\"\n\nThe use of the word \u201cpredates [its] first recorded appearance in print, in her own \u2018 Mansfield Park, \u2019 the following year,\u201d Ian Ehling, a specialist of books and manuscripts, wrote in Bonhams\u2019 brochure for the sale.\n\nAusten\u2019s letter is estimated to fetch between $80,000 and $120,000.\n\nThe sale will also include a series of Texas and American maps and several color plate books on Greece and Natural History.", "description": "The note was written in 1875 in response to an accusation of a stolen horse", "authors": ["V.L.
