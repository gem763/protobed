June saw a peak price of $1.75 million, the report found, after a slew of IPOs from local tech companies like Uber and Pinterest.\n\n\n\nMore: Centuries-Old English Country House on the Market with an Upgrade\n\n\u201cThe wild card this year in San Francisco has been this rollout of IPOs,\u201d said Patrick Carlisle, Compass\u2019 chief market analyst in the San Francisco Bay Area. \u201cIf you take the impact of the IPOs out of the market, one would presume prices will no longer be pushed higher.\u201d\n\n\n\nThose IPOs earlier this year led to a record second quarter, Mr. Carlisle said. And the San Francisco market continues to outperform compared to the larger Bay Area, he added.\n\n\n\nMost other counties in the area have seen declines in median home prices since peaking in spring 2018, but not San Francisco. The city\u2019s limited supply and the influx of interest has kept prices up.\n\n\n\nMedian home prices in \u201cother markets around the Bay Area have fallen year-over-year, generally in the 3% to 5% range,\u201d Mr. Carlisle said. \u201cSan Francisco and the market San Francisco impacts the most, which is the Oakland market, are the standout ones as far as performing in 2019.\u201d\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: Sotheby\u2019s to Offer a Private Whisky Collection\u2014the Most Valuable to Ever Hit Auction\n\nMedian prices in the Oakland area are up 3% to 7% for the year to date, compared to 2018, according to Compass\u2019 September report on the region.\n\n\n\nThe summer price slide is typical in many markets, Mr. Carlisle noted. He expects activity, and prices, to pick up again from now until early to mid-November, especially for luxury housing.\n\n\n\n\u201cLuxury home sellers know this is their last chance to sell their home in 2019,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they don't get it on the market within the next four or five weeks and then sell it within the next six to eight weeks, then they have to wait until early spring 2020.\u201d\n\n\n\nIndeed, October is historically a big month for luxury home transactions in the city.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor the last several years, October has been the biggest month for home sales of $3 million and above of any month of the calendar year,\u201d Mr. Carlisle explained.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["V.L.
