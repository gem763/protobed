Photo: Erik Madigan Heck\n\n\u201cIn many things that I\u2019ve been in, I find myself in the position of uniting the archetypes of Madonna and whore,\u201d says Marisa Tomei when we meet up after she finishes a long day of rehearsals for The Rose Tattoo, \u201cmaking a passageway for us all to hold in our minds. These are not two separate things.\u201d\n\nThe Rose Tattoo is among the less-performed Tennessee Williams plays. \u201cIt\u2019s probably on the B-list or something,\u201d Tomei says. She stars in it as Serafina Delle Rose, a grieving Sicilian-immigrant wife and mother, and even though the 1955 film adaptation earned Anna Magnani her Oscar for the role, Serafina is less familiar to audiences than Amanda Wingfield or Blanche DuBois. The melodrama starts with the death of a husband, withers toward catastrophe, and then blooms into a love story, but it\u2019s strange and messy, and for many people, it doesn\u2019t quite, in a conventional sense, add up. \u201cI like plays that are considered unresolvable in some way,\u201d Tomei says. \u201cMaybe they don\u2019t work in a way that contemporary criticism thinks they should work, but they work on a mystical level.\u201d\n\nTomei had wanted to find one of those New York\u2013staple Italian red-sauce joints to meet in, but the snoozy, mock-bohemian Marlton Hotel near Washington Square is quieter and more convenient. In person, she\u2019s both lively and serious, often at the same time, her focus simultaneously on the sacred and the profane. Unresolvable is one of those adjectives she holds tight. She wears oversize nerd-chic glasses and teases her hair with a finger as she speaks. In the middle of a digression about how she explored the history of the black Madonna on a recent trip to Sicily, she suggests that things are getting serious and we\u2019d better order drinks. (She gets a Mezcal Mule.)\n\nIn The Rose Tattoo, Serafina is a devoted wife, unwilling to believe her late husband was unfaithful, who, while in mourning, falls for a man with a clownish face and a body that resembles her husband\u2019s. It\u2019s a sprawling play that calls for a cast of nearly two dozen and a goat (which could also explain why it\u2019s not often performed). Will there be a live goat on Broadway? \u201cThat\u2019s up for debate right now,\u201d Tomei says. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you do it without one, but how do you do it with one?\u201d When first discussing performing in the play at the Williamstown Theatre Festival in 2016 with director Trip Cullman, Tomei worried she might be pigeonholed by doing \u201cthat Italian thing,\u201d but the complexity and humor of the play won her over: \u201cthe love, the joy of the characters, and the joy of the journey that they take\u201d \u2014 she pauses a beat \u2014 \u201cand for the yuks!\u201d\n\nTomei is more than a bit of a ham, which feels like the thing that turns the Madonna-whore duality into a sort of holy trinity. She was part of the Naked Angels theater company in the 1980s \u2014 known for its work and its parties \u2014 and skyrocketed to stardom with an Oscar for her yuks-filled, teased-hair-and-jumpsuit turn in 1992\u2019s My Cousin Vinny. Her next two Oscar nominations came for her roles as a mother caught up in tragedy in 2001\u2019s In the Bedroom and as a stripper in 2008\u2019s The Wrestler. She was last on Broadway in 2014 as a jumpy wife in The Realistic Jones.\n\nEarlier this year, she appeared in both Avengers: Endgame (briefly) and the latest Spider-Man as a younger, bell-bottoms-wearing Aunt May (a role she\u2019s not yet sure she\u2019s going to get to reprise). This fall, she appears in Ira Sachs\u2019s CGI-free film Frankie with the French actress Isabelle Huppert, a friend whom she recently helped find an apartment in New York.\n\nBut if you ask Tomei, she\u2019ll say she had the most fun playing Edith Bunker in a live version of an All in the Family episode that aired on ABC earlier this year. Wearing a wig and speaking with a thick Queens accent, Tomei both mimicked Jean Stapleton\u2019s performance and brought her own warmth to it. \u201cNow I know that my favorite genre is live-to-air sitcom, which doesn\u2019t even exist,\u201d Tomei says with a mordant laugh. \u201cSo I\u2019m a little crushed.\u201d (If you\u2019d like to write one for her, please get in touch.)\n\n\u201cAt this time in my life,\u201d she says, \u201cit\u2019s good to work as much as possible to get through this point where I could be pushed out and disappear from this business.\u201d Hollywood is finally able to talk about career-curtailing sexism thanks to the Time\u2019s Up movement, in which Tomei has been deeply involved. But, she notes directly, the offers she\u2019s getting haven\u2019t changed much in terms of an \u201cequal or even fair salary.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s been a great disappointment,\u201d she says. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot more room to talk about it, which in itself is a great relief and another step forward. Having the courage to even vocalize that after feeling muzzled for generations, that\u2019s something beautiful.\u201d The idea of a woman being told to stay in her lane taps into \u201cancient cultural memory,\u201d she notes, which is part of what animates her take on the widowed Serafina, who is constantly being told to let her sexuality die alongside her husband.\n\nThis production of The Rose Tattoo incorporates traditional Italian music and dance, and Tomei has become especially fascinated with the tarantella, a spasmodic folk dance associated with trying to cure the bite of a tarantula, which has also become a metaphor for unrequited love or unfulfilled sexuality \u2014 \u201cthis way of moving your body and coming back into your body and getting your psyche together again,\u201d Tomei explains. Raising her arms, she briefly demonstrates. \u201cIn a sense, that\u2019s what Serafina goes through. She\u2019s got that bite.\u201d\n\nThe Rose Tattoo premieres September 19 at the American Airlines Theater.
