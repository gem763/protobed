I\u2019m not, for myself. That much I know and I\u2019ve had to work through it in my head.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m one scan away from perhaps knowing that thing is going to happen sooner rather than later.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve dealt with it for myself, but I do find it very difficult when I think of my loved ones and particularly for the woman who has loved me, and I\u2019ve loved, since 1976 \u2013 Frances.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThe 63-year-old has two sons, Adam and Matthew, with wife Frances, who he met at Durham University. He also became a grandfather for the first time last year, which he describes as \u201ca wonderful thing\u201d.\n\nAfter his initial diagnosis nearly six years ago, the disease spread to his liver and lymph nodes.\n\nThat needed treatment with 17 rounds of chemotherapy and five operations, including one to remove most of his liver. George returned to work in 2015 but had to take more time out in 2017, when he was told that his bowel cancer had returned.\n\nHe explained: \u201cI\u2019m pretty content, strange as it may sound. More so since I was diagnosed with cancer five and a half years ago. Cancer is a physical disease, but you have to deal with it as much in your mind as anywhere else.\n\n(Image: BBC News & Current Affairs via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cYou certainly have to come to terms with it. I was in \u2018sort your affairs\u2019 territory. It took me three to six months to figure out how I was going to deal with it. I drew up list of good things and bad things in my life \u2013 and I discovered the good things way outnumber the bad things,\u201d he said on the How To Fail with Elizabeth Day podcast.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m at chemo tomorrow and various other sorts of treatment, and some of it has been tough.\n\n\u201cCancer is knocking on my door every day. I have to accept and own that vulnerability, and not let it engulf me.\u201d\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nSpeaking about the gender pay gap at the Beeb, the newsreader, who was named as one of the \u00a3250,000 to \u00a3300,000 earners, added: \u201cThere is a gender pay gap. I know we published a list for us \u2018top people\u2019, if you can call us that.\n\n\u201cI am actually more worried about the gender gap below, of the people who don\u2019t get published and whether there is a gap there, and there shouldn\u2019t be.\n\n\u201cIt does concern me. I think equal pay for equal work.\u201d", "description": "The veteran BBC news presenter was diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2014 and the disease returned in 2017", "authors": ["Kelly Allen", "Image", "Getty Images", "Bbc News", "Current Affairs Via Getty Images", "Bbc"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20757435.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_George-Alagiah-on-the-set-of-World-News.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
