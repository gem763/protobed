He is less fearful than when he first arrived in 2013, when he felt lonely, isolated and paranoid that he could be targeted in the streets by US agents seeking retribution.\n\n\u201cI was very much a person the most powerful government in the world wanted to go away. They did not care whether I went away to prison. They did not care whether I went away into the ground. They just wanted me gone,\u201d he said.\n\nHe has dispensed with the scarves, hats and coats he once used as disguises and now moves freely around the city, riding the metro, visiting art galleries or the ballet, joining friends in cafes and restaurants.\n\nThe front page of the Guardian on 7 June 2013\n\nPermanent Record, which is being published on Tuesday in more than 20 countries, charts the shift that took him from working deep inside the NSA and the CIA to Hong Kong, where he handed over a cache of classified documents to journalists from the Guardian.\n\nThe documents revealed the scale of mass surveillance by the US, UK and their allies. He is high on the US wanted list and faces decades in jail if detained.\n\nThe US government could seize royalties from the book but the substantial advance has already been banked.\n\nNormally averse to discussing his personal life, Snowden opened up in both the interview and the memoirs to speak for the first time about his life in Moscow and even the person he describes as \u201cthe love of my life\u201d, Mills.\n\nPolls taken in the US in 2013 and the years immediately after showed an almost equal split between those who viewed him as a traitor and those who saw him as a hero.\n\n\u201cIt is funny that now, six years later, the controversial image that I had has begun to soften.\u201d\n\nEven people who dislike him personally were now prepared to accept \u201cwe live in a better, freer and safer world because of the revelations of mass surveillance\u201d, he said.\n\nOne of the Democratic presidential candidates, Bernie Sanders, said he would like to see a resolution that would end Snowden\u2019s permanent exile, while another, the congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, said in May she would pardon him.\n\nFears that President Vladimir Putin might hand him over as a gift to Donald Trump have receded as relations between the US and Russia have cooled.\n\nSnowden said it helped that Russia viewed him as useful publicity.\n\n\u201cA country whose political troubles are legendary, whose problems with human rights we hear about every single day has finally, somehow, managed to have one bright spot on their human rights record \u2026 Why would they give that up?\u201d\n\nHe toyed with calling his memoirs The New Forever or Welcome to Forever before settling on Permanent Record, which reflects his concerns about the way state-run and private companies are hoarding data.\n\nWe have moved to a society in which we are forced to live our lives naked before power.\n\nTo counter this, he argues for both legislative reform and increased use of end-to-end encryption to protect emails, chat and other communications. But these are not enough, he says, to counter accelerating technological changes allowing greater intrusions of privacy and he calls for a worldwide protest movement, similar to those on climate change.\n\n\u201cYou have to be ready to stand for something if you want it to change,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is what I hope this book will help people come to decide for themselves.\u201d\n\nSnowden, 36, lives in a two-bedroom flat on the outskirts of Moscow and makes a living mainly from fees for speaking to students, civil rights activists and others abroad via video link-ups.\n\nHe was given temporary asylum when he first arrived and now has permanent residency, the equivalent of a US green card, renewable every three years, though he said this was just a formality.\n\nHe had been on his way from Hong Kong via Russia and Cuba to what he hoped would be sanctuary in Ecuador when the US cancelled his passport, leaving him stranded in Russia.\n\nHe likes to travel, in spite of being restricted to within Russia\u2019s borders, and has visited cities such as St Petersburg and the Black Sea resort of Sochi.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that is lost in all the problematic politics of the Russian government is the fact this is one of the most beautiful countries in the world. The people are friendly. The people are warm,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when I came here I did not understand any of this. I was terrified of this place because, of course, they were the great fortress of the enemy, which is the way a CIA agent looks at Russia.\u201d\n\nIn the past, he would not have openly spoken so warmly about Russia, worried about how it might be perceived back home in the US.\n\nWe met in a flat \u2013 not his \u2013 on Tsvetnoy Boulevard, near the city centre. A minute\u2019s walk to the left of the flat there is a Starbucks and to the right a Krispy Kreme. Snowden, who loves fast food, said one of the things Americans did not realise about Russia was that almost all the things you could get in the US were available there, apart from, he added wistfully, a Taco Bell.\n\nThroughout history, exile meant being cut off from society, \u201ca punishment worse than death\u201d. But exile did not mean that any more, he said. He could communicate with students in New York via video and three hours later do a similar event in Germany.\n\nDescribing himself as \u201can indoor cat by choice\u201d, he is happiest sitting at his computer late into the night, communicating with campaigners and supporters. The time difference with the US has made that a necessity. The night before we met he had only gone to bed at 6am. His normal pattern is to sleep until late in the morning.\n\nIn Permanent Record, he describes how he and Mills met when he was 22 on an internet site, Hot or Not, on which pictures were posted and rated. He gave her a 10 out of 10. She gave him an eight.\n\nSeven years later, as he prepared to fly to Hong Kong, he said he did not tell her about his plans to turn whistleblower as this would have made her an accessory. He feels bad she did not know where he had gone.\n\nOne of the surprises in Permanent Record is the inclusion of extracts from her diary. These are blunt and raw, recording how \u201cpissed\u201d she was at his sudden disappearance, even wondering whether he was having an affair.\n\nWhen the police and FBI were first looking for him, one police officer was suspicious of her. She wrote: \u201cHe was looking at me like I killed Ed. He was looking around the house for his body.\u201d\n\nWhen she turned up on Snowden\u2019s doorstep in Moscow, he was braced for a slap but instead she told him she loved him and supported his decision to turn whistleblower.\n\nYou have to be ready to stand for something if you want it to change.\n\nIn the memoirs, he writes about his childhood and teenage obsession with computers and games, such as Legend of Zelda and Super Mario Bros. As a teenager, he hacked into a nuclear facility and reported its vulnerabilities to the authorities. An official from the Los Alamos nuclear lab, where the atom bomb was created, phoned his mother to thank him.\n\nPermanent Record offers one of the most detailed accounts of what it is like to work inside an intelligence agency in the 21st century. \u201cThere are no James Bonds.\u201d He discloses that the NSA increasingly used contractors \u2013 he was one for much of the time \u2013 rather than employ permanent staff.\n\nAt a training school for spies, tutors nicknamed him \u201cthe Count\u201d, which he is quick to say sounds exotic but was actually because his mannerisms reminded tutors of a Sesame Street character.\n\nThere was no pivotal moment when he decided to turn whistleblower. He attended, by chance, a conference on the scale of Chinese surveillance of its own citizens. That created a nagging thought that if China was doing it then so too might the US. He searched and found confirmation.\n\nThe 2016 Oliver Stone movie, Snowden, portrayed him as sneaking the documents out of the NSA by hiding an SD card, about the size of a small stamp, on a Rubik\u2019s Cube. Snowden neither confirms or denies it, knowing one day he may yet face prosecution. \u201cA Rubik\u2019s Cube can be very useful and functions as a distraction device and also functions as a concealment device.\u201d\n\nHe recalled how his plans almost came unstuck near the end. He had secretly hoarded documents on an abandoned computer, and was moving it. \u201cSo I got stopped in the hallway as I\u2019m taking this old machine back and a supervisor says: \u2018What are you doing with this machine?\u2019 And I look at him frankly and I say: \u2018Stealing secrets.\u2019\u201d They both laughed. But that was exactly what he was doing.\n\n\u2022 Permanent Record is published by Macmillan (\u00a320). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com or call 0330 333 6846.
