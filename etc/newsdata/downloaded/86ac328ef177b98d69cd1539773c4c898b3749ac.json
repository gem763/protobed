The thinking behind the bill is that legitimizing drivers would actually make the roads safer for everyone as those drivers would now be on the grid like the rest of us. They would be held to the same standards as anyone else, having to pass tests and get insurance.\n\nThis effort is a cynical maneuver that would only go to undermine the rule of law. It will result in an influx of illegal immigrants to the Bay State who will look to use the RMV documentation to begin to obtain legitimacy.\n\nA driver\u2019s license can bridge the gap between undocumented status and the full privileges of citizenship, including voting. It is quite a reward to bestow upon someone who has repeatedly broken the law, in most cases, in establishing an unearned livelihood in this country.\n\nEarlier this year, Gov. Charlie Baker, told the Boston Herald he would \u201ccertainly veto\u201d a bill to grant licenses to undocumented immigrants. If it gets that far he must do just that.", "description": "Lawmakers will move to give illegal immigrants driver's licenses.", "authors": ["Boston Herald Editorial Staff"], "top_image": "https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Beacon_Hill_27010-1.jpg?w=1024&h=678", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
