The Redskins finally dominated on the ground, letting them control the pace for most of the afternoon.\n\nBut for the Redskins, the question becomes whether Sunday\u2019s performance was an exception or the standard moving forward. Miami, after all, had allowed 175.8 rushing yards per game through its first four games \u2014 a number the Redskins couldn\u2019t match or surpass.\n\nWhat will happen when they face better teams, like next week\u2019s matchup with the San Francisco 49ers?\n\nCallahan, though, liked what he saw when he looked at the film.\n\n\u201cWe ran the ball for over 140 yards, which was tremendous when you\u2019re on the road and pound it and give up no sacks, no penalties and only one (tackles for loss) in the run game on 30-something attempts,\u201d Callahan said Monday. \u201cI thought a lot of positives came out of that.\u201d\n\nIn his first game at the helm, Callahan radically shifted Washington\u2019s offense to a run-first mentality. Through the first five games with former coach Jay Gruden, the Redskins ran the ball on first down just 43% of the time. But against the Dolphins, Washington dialed up a run on first down a staggering 20 times out of 24 \u2014 good for 83% percent.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always effective either.\n\nOn Washington\u2019s 20 first-down runs, the Redskins averaged just 2.5 yards per carry. That\u2019s even worse than what the Redskins had done under Gruden, picking up an average of 3.2 yards on 54 carries in five games.\n\nBut from the moment Callahan took over, the 63-year-old emphasized rushing attempts \u2014 not yards per carry. The former offensive line coach is a strong believer in sticking with the run, so bigger plays can follow.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened in Miami. The Redskins ran the ball 56% of the time (13 of 23) on second down, gaining 7.5 yards per attempt. Peterson said his team adjusted to the types of coverage they were seeing on the field as the game went on to further open up the run game.\n\n\u201cThere was a couple of times they stuffed us, but we (were) dedicated to running the ball and being balanced,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cI feel like we were able to do that as an offense.\u201d\n\nStill, there will be times the Redskins will be forced to throw. They were able to run consistently because Miami trailed for most of the afternoon. That\u2019s not going to happen every game. And even with the lead, the Redskins failed to fully put away the Dolphins \u2014 almost blowing a 14-point cushion in the fourth.\n\nWashington had just 21 yards rushing in that quarter on eight attempts, failing to run out the clock. Instead, the Dolphins got back into it, only losing when they failed to convert a two-point conversion with seconds left.\n\nNext Sunday, the Redskins will have their hands full as the undefeated 49ers have the sixth-best run defense in the league, giving up just 87.2 yards per game.\n\nThe Redskins also can\u2019t be sure that they\u2019ll have the same type of luck when it comes to avoiding penalties. For the first time this season, the offense went without being called for a penalty Sunday \u2014 helping Washington avoid unfavorable situations.\n\nThough Callahan brought referees to practice last week to put an emphasis on cleaning up mistakes, the interim coach admitted he didn\u2019t know if it made a difference.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just one game, you know?\u201d Callahan said. \u201cEverything\u2019s different, next week\u2019s crew may call completely different and emphasize something different. We may play different. So I can\u2019t predict what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\nRegardless, the Redskins appear set on sticking with the run as long as possible. They see it as a positive for the defense, as well.\n\nWashington being able to run the ball against Miami was \u201chuge,\u201d especially factoring in the heat during the game, linebacker Ryan Kerrigan said.\n\n\u201cIt was very big, you know the sun beating down on us and they got it situated in the shade on their sideline and we\u2019re getting beaten down in the sun,\u201d Kerrigan said. But that\u2019s a big thing for our offense to be able to control the clock and keep us on the sideline as much as possible.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
