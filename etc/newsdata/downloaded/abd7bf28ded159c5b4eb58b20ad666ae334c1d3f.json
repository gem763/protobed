They have to save for retirement first and then enjoy.\u201d\n\nFrequent Uber and Lyft users spend a median of $95 a month, which can add up to more than $1,000 a year, according to an 2016 analysis from Vice.\n\nSaving for retirement doesn\u2019t mean sacrificing all today\u2019s luxuries, however. Jalinksi just advises that you have a spending plan.\n\n\u201cGive yourself a carrot on a stick,\u201d Jalinski said in a recent interview with Yahoo Finance. \u201cYes, save 15% of your income, but reward yourself every year with a trip. Take a little honeymoon once a year with your spouse or significant other, but max out your retirement plan.\u201d\n\nA photo of San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee adorns a pink mustache of Lyft in San Francisco, California, July 30, 2013.

Eventually, their goal grew to stashing away $50,000 every year.\n\nJalinski, who also authored the book, \u201cRetirement Reality Check: How to Spend Your Money and Still Leave an Amazing Legacy,\u201d is a big fan of tax-favored accounts like Roth IRAs, which are funded with after-tax dollars.\n\n\u201cI like to get my latte. I like to get my coffee. I like to enjoy my money,\u201d Jalinski said. \u201cBut I want to save my income, too, in tax-advantaged accounts, so that when I\u2019m in retirement, I don\u2019t have to worry about taxes.\u201d\n\nDhara is a writer for Yahoo Finance.
