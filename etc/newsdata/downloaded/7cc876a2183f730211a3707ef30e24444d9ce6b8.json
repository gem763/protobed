The changes then have to be vetted by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration before a follow-up meeting with the same participants can be held and crucial simulator and flight tests of the final software revisions scheduled.\n\nThe upshot, the people said, is likely to be several more weeks of delay that could significantly reduce the likelihood that many of the planes would be back flying passengers in North America during the Christmas holidays, as Boeing and some U.S. carriers have publicly projected. The meetings and the fallout haven\u2019t been reported before.\n\nAn expanded version of this story is available at WSJ.com\n\nAlso on WSJ.com\n\nGrowing acceptance for those who don\u2019t see themselves as male or female\n\nManhattan luxury apartment sales slump after rush to beat new tax", "description": "Friction between Boeing Co. and international air-safety authorities threatens a new delay in bringing the grounded 737 MAX fleet back into service,...", "authors": ["Andy Pasztor", "Alison Sider"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ529_idle_7_ZG_20190902053442.jpg"}
