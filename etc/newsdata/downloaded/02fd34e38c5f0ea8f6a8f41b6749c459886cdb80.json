They toss out insincere compliments, they make vague and unseemly promises, they disengage from all those refresher sessions on journalistic ethics.\n\nAnd they use terms they don\u2019t like to cozy up to government officials. At least, that\u2019s what Fox News host Chris Wallace did back in December 2017 in correspondence with then-Treasury Department spokesman Tony Sayegh. The host of \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d was engaging in a little competitive one-upmanship, criticizing a question by CNN \u201cState of the Union\u201d host Jake Tapper. \u201cIs this right?\u201d wrote Wallace, in an email obtained by Democracy Forward via a Freedom of Information Act request and published by the Hollywood Reporter\u2019s Jeremy Barr. \u201cWas the first question Tapper asked the secretary about the special counsel?\u201d\n\nAccording to the transcript, yes: In an interview with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Dec. 17, 2017, Tapper started out with this inquiry: \u201cWould it alarm you if President Trump fired [Special Counsel Robert] Mueller?\u201d\n\nMnuchin responded, \u201cI haven\u2019t heard the president \u2014 I was with the \u2014 at dinner last night with the president and vice president. I haven\u2019t heard anything about this, any firing. But we have got to get past this investigation. It\u2019s a giant distraction. Nobody has said that in any way this impacted the outcome of the election.\u201d He also said that dismissing Mueller would be \u201cup to\u201d President Trump. There was immediate context for the question about the special counsel, considering that Trump World was apoplectic about a move by Mueller\u2019s team to obtain emails from Trump\u2019s presidential transition operation. Legal experts, said Tapper, opined that the controversy could serve as a \u201cpretext\u201d for Mueller\u2019s firing.\n\nIn his correspondence with Sayegh, Wallace thought Tapper\u2019s question was off base: \u201cAs much as I hate the expression \u2018fake news\u2019 \u2014 this is a perfect example of it \u2014 especially on the week the country gets a massive overhaul of the tax code,\u201d he wrote back to Sayegh. Such blandishments reflect the hypercompetitive nature of the Sunday public affairs shows, which jockey among each other for the best guests.\n\nWallace has spoken out against the demonization of media during the Trump era. As further proof that he doesn\u2019t like the term he deployed, Wallace in November 2018 pressed Trump on his anti-media rhetoric in an interview. After the president dodged accountability for his words, Wallace went straight at him: \u201cBut, sir, leaders in authoritarian countries like Russia, China, Venezuela, now repress the media using your words.\u201d\n\nRight! The Erik Wemple Blog can stomach a lot of depravity in emails between journos and sources \u2014 those communications, after all, aren\u2019t a finished journalistic product, which should determine the reputation of news folk. Invoking \u201cfake news\u201d to tar the work of a peer, however, is far worse. \u201cFake news,\u201d remember, applies to deliberately false stories posted on the Internet to draw fungible clicks and stoke political division \u2014 despite Trump\u2019s attempts to widen the term\u2019s purview. No one in Trump\u2019s orbit needs encouragement \u2014 especially from a towering figure like Wallace \u2014 to unsheathe this poisonous term.\n\nIn any case, history has endorsed Tapper\u2019s instincts here, as he was alighting on what may survive as Trump\u2019s most naked attempt to abuse his executive authority. Approximately one month after Tapper quizzed Mnuchin about the special counsel\u2019s job security, the New York Times\u2019s Michael S. Schmidt and Maggie Haberman reported that Trump in June 2017 had indeed ordered the firing of Mueller, via White House counsel Donald McGahn.\n\nJust how did Trump greet that investigative report? \u201cFake news, folks,\u201d he said. \u201cFake news. A typical New York Times fake story.\u201d So the president and Wallace appeared to agree on this.\n\nThe Mueller report, which surfaced in April, disagreed, however. It confirmed the New York Times story point by scandalous point. \u201cSubstantial evidence \u2026 supports the conclusion that the President went further and in fact directed McGahn to call Rosenstein to have the Special Counsel removed,\u201d it found.\n\nAsked about the situation, a Fox News spokesperson responded that Wallace is \u201cproud of the tough and probing interview he did with Treasury Secretary Mnuchin in which he asked at least 10 questions about the tax bill that had just been passed, including whether wealthy Americans need all of those tax breaks and if the GOP tax plan will create a more complicated tax system.\u201d\n\nNo doubt: Wallace\u2019s session with Mnuchin was a model of interview-accountability journalism, chockablock with numbers and research and a polite but stern skepticism. \u201cThe president was on the South Lawn \u2026 and said, four, five or six percent growth. We do not really believe that, do you?\u201d he asked of Mnuchin, in what turned out to be a prescient question.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear from the email why Wallace thought a question about firing Mueller was \u201cfake news.\u201d Perhaps his decades in Washington journalism have taught him that presidents of the United States just don\u2019t sink to such a level of corruption. We\u2019re all learning on the job here.\n\nA CNN spokesperson issued this statement: \u201cTurns out Chris Wallace is no different than many of his peers at Fox News. It\u2019s disappointing that he\u2019d need to take cheap shots at another journalist to curry favor with this administration.\u201d Actually, Chris Wallace is much different from many of his peers at Fox News, which is why this \u201cfake news\u201d moment comes as such a surprise.\n\nRead more:\n\nAnn Telnaes: Trump takes aim at a free press\n\nJennifer Rubin: How you know Trump is in a full panic\n\nErik Wemple: Fox News claims scoop that was buried in a New York Times story months ago\n\nPaul Waldman: How right-wing media will shape the impeachment battle\n\nJennifer Rubin: Standing up for the First Amendment", "description": "Tells treasury official that a question posed by Tapper was 'fake news.'", "authors": ["Erik Wemple", "Media Critic With A Focus On The Ups", "Downs", "Downs Of The Cable-News Industry.", "Media Critic", "October At Am", "The Washington Post'S Media Critic", "Focuses On The Cable-News Industry.
