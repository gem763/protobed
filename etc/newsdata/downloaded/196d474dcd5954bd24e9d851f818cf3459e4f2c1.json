The high-stakes standoff is now raising questions about what, if anything, will get signed into law.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe only have so much bandwidth, and if the bandwidth is all going to be used up pursuing this futile effort to remove the president, then that\u2019s going to come at a cost. And I think the cost will be legislation that we could pass,\u201d said Sen. John Cornyn John CornynHouse passes bill aimed at reducing rape kit backlog Cornyn seeks to clarify remarks about 'ethnic cleansing' of Kurds, U.S. troop removal Cornyn to introduce gun violence legislation MORE (R-Texas), an adviser to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellDemocrats say whistleblower deposition no longer central to impeachment investigation: report Overnight Defense: Top general briefs GOP senators on Syria plan | Senators 'encouraged' by briefing | Pence huddles with Republican allies on Syria | Trump nominee sidesteps questions on arms treaties GOP senators briefed on administration Syria plan MORE (R-Ky.).\n\nPressed on the fate of \u201cmust-pass legislation\u201d like funding the government and a mammoth defense policy bill, Cornyn added, \u201chopefully those won\u2019t be casualties, but around here it\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess.\u201d\n\nLawmakers are pointing fingers about who is to blame for the fallout as bicameral legislation slows to a crawl. The last bill signed into law that was substantial enough to require a roll call vote in the Senate was September\u2019s continuing resolution.\n\nSince then, the House formally launched its impeachment inquiry, leading the White House to warn that Democrats had \u201cdestroyed any chances of legislative progress.\u201d\n\nGun background check talks, which had been ongoing before the impeachment inquiry, have fallen off the map. And a meeting with congressional leadership went off the rails when Trump called Pelosi a \u201cthird-rate politician\u201d and Democrats stormed out.\n\nAsked how the White House had done promoting a legislative agenda during the impeachment fight, Sen. Dick Durbin Richard (Dick) Joseph DurbinSenate confirms Trump judicial pick labeled 'not qualified' by American Bar Association Hillicon Valley: Zuckerberg would support delaying Libra | More attorneys general join Facebook probe | Defense chief recuses from 'war cloud' contract | Senate GOP blocks two election security bills | FTC brings case against 'stalking' app developer Senate Republicans block two election security bills MORE (Ill.), the No. 2 Senate Democrat, laughed.\n\n\u201cPut a gun to my head and ask me to name the Senate congressional liaison, and I\u2019ll tell you just pull the trigger. I don\u2019t even know who it is,\u201d Durbin said.\n\nThe stalemate on major bills comes as Congress has roughly 20 legislative days left before 2020. Within that span of time they\u2019re faced with funding the government, reauthorizing controversial surveillance programs, passing a mammoth defense policy bill and trying to tick off wish-list items like drug pricing and Trump\u2019s trade agreement with Canada and Mexico.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSenate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley Charles (Chuck) Ernest GrassleyWhistleblower exposed much more than Trump's self-dealing Melania Trump makes first solo visit to Capitol Hill Senate rejects Dem measure to overturn IRS rules on SALT deduction cap MORE (R-Iowa) warned that he didn\u2019t think the trade deal, known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), would get passed this year.\n\n\u201cThe Democratically-controlled House of Representatives looks increasingly less likely to act this year on USMCA. That threatens passage of the trilateral trade deal this Congress, as next year is a presidential election year,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked about the White House\u2019s legislative agenda, Sen. Ron Johnson Ronald (Ron) Harold JohnsonOvernight Defense: Top general briefs GOP senators on Syria plan | Senators 'encouraged' by briefing | Pence huddles with Republican allies on Syria | Trump nominee sidesteps questions on arms treaties GOP senators briefed on administration Syria plan GOP senators frustrated with Romney jabs at Trump MORE (R-Wis.) noted regulatory reforms and restructuring within the administration. When a reporter pointed out those items don\u2019t require working with Congress, Johnson knocked Democrats over the pending trade agreement.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to get USMCA passed,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, we have some real obstructions.\u201d\n\nSenators are urging Trump and lawmakers to come to the table where they need to pass legislation, like funding the government, or other areas of potential bipartisan agreement.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham Lindsey Olin GrahamDemocrats say whistleblower deposition no longer central to impeachment investigation: report White House weighing options that would keep 500 troops in Syria: report Overnight Defense: Top general briefs GOP senators on Syria plan | Senators 'encouraged' by briefing | Pence huddles with Republican allies on Syria | Trump nominee sidesteps questions on arms treaties MORE (R-S.C.) is urging Trump to follow the Clinton playbook and continue to reach out to lawmakers about legislation even as he\u2019s the center of an impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cI think he needs to reach out to Democrats and Republicans and say in the middle of all this mess, \u2018Let\u2019s see if we can do something on the USMCA and prescription drugs,\u2019 \u201d Graham said.\n\nSen. Roy Blunt Roy Dean BluntOvernight Defense: Top general briefs GOP senators on Syria plan | Senators 'encouraged' by briefing | Pence huddles with Republican allies on Syria | Trump nominee sidesteps questions on arms treaties GOP senators briefed on administration Syria plan Trump allies mull how to quickly quash impeachment articles MORE (Mo.), a member of GOP leadership, pointed to tax extenders, trade agreements and funding the government as possible things that could move under the cloud of impeachment.\n\n\u201c[It] continues to be one of the fundamental responsibilities of the Congress, along with the president, to fund the government so \u2026 I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll figure out how to do that,\u201d Blunt said.\n\nSenate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby Richard Craig ShelbyOn The Money: Lawmakers hammer Zuckerberg over Facebook controversies | GOP chair expects another funding stopgap | Senate rejects Dem measure on SALT deduction cap workarounds Shelby expects another funding stopgap, potentially through March Congress faces major hurdles to spending deal MORE (R-Ala.) added, \"I think we'll have some bipartisan goodwill. I hope it's enough.\"\n\nDurbin, however, was more pessimistic, saying he didn\u2019t think there was anything bipartisan enough to be able to pass. But, he acknowledged, \u201cit would be\u201d beneficial for the White House and Democrats to be able to show voters they accomplished something.\n\n\u201cInfrastructure, remember that one? Blew up in our face,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a sign that both sides realize they need legislative victories ahead of Election Day, congressional leaders are trying to claim the mantle of being willing to work with the other side on bills.\n\nMcConnell has repeatedly teed off against Democrats from the Senate floor, arguing they\u2019re holding up the trade deal and military funding.\n\n\u201cThe needs of the American people have not been put on pause just because the Democrats have decided it doesn\u2019t suit them to get along with the White House,\" McConnell said.\n\nIn a separate speech this week, he said Democrats have insisted \u201cthe three-year-old quest to impeach the president will not prevent them from the substantive work. ... So far, the early results haven\u2019t been promising.\u201d\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles Schumer Charles (Chuck) Ellis SchumerRep.
