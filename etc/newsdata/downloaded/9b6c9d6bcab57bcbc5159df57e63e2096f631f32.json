While many US news channels such as Fox News and MSNBC are notorious for biased journalism, I believe they are rarely as overtly bigoted as the British newspapers.\n\nMeghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, has received an absurd amount of criticism from British society ever since her relationship with Prince Harry became serious.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t welcomed, simply because she was unconventional \u2013 she was divorced, and she was African-American. Additionally, she was a celebrity and had a relatively thriving acting career. In other words, she was virtually the opposite to the young lady, from an affluent family, that British society expected Prince Harry to marry.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s ethnic minorities deserve our respect and empathy\n\nThe Daily Mail called her \u201cpublicity-hungry\u201d in 2016, and other tabloids have been equally disparaging. The narrative that Markle is a questionable addition to the royal family by British media is consistent, and it is escalating.\n\nCatherine, Duchess of Cambridge has never faced ridicule to this extent. She was from an upper-middle-class family which had ties to British aristocracy.\n\nArguably, she was precisely what the British society wanted for Prince William. While pitting women against each other is nothing new in tabloid journalism, their discontent with Markle is visible.\n\nWhat it's like to grow up an ethnic minority in HK, and why the Diversity List is needed to address our city's discrimination\n\nI believe it goes beyond misogyny; it is racism.\n\nThe fact that journalists in 2019 could, and would, describe people in such a way is horrific. In the name of \u201cfree speech\u201d, it would be difficult to censor such language, but British journalists must look into their collective conscience and consider their professionalism before publishing this type of content. Any form of racism is intolerable.\n\nBritish etiquette \u2013 table manners, apologies, chivalry and so on \u2013 is overshadowed by the times in which we live. Modern Britain, while diverse and progressive on the surface, still holds tight to entrenched values that are very unkind and very discriminatory.\n\nWe can all do more to tackle racism in HK\n\nI\u2019ve noticed that this can also be observed in daily interactions when you live in the country.\n\nAlternatively, just have a look at how the newspapers have continuously vilified Markle, despite her always-happy expression and her commitment to charitable causes.\n\nPeople of colour, and especially women of colour, deserve better.\n\nEdited by Ingrid Piper", "description": "Bullying of any form is unacceptable in our society, whether it takes place in a schoolyard or via international media.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/5ddf8e32-f49a-11e9-87ad-fce8e65242a6imagehires180453.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
