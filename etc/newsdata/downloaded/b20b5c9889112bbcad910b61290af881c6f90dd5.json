A strike group led by aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln has been in the Middle East for months, and Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper declined to say Friday whether its deployment would be extended.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEsper, speaking Friday at the Pentagon, said that evidence recovered from recent attacks in the Persian Gulf region \u201cprove that Tehran is responsible,\u201d and that Iran\u2019s bad behavior is part of a broader campaign to disrupt the global economy.\n\n\u201cIran\u2019s attempts to use terror, intimidation and military force to advance its interests are inconsistent with international norms,\u201d Esper said.\n\nThe defense secretary said he spoke Friday with the Saudi minister of defense, Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, to discuss Saudi Arabia\u2019s defensive capabilities and U.S. efforts to protect partners in the region from further Iranian aggression.\n\n\u201cSaudi Arabia is a longstanding security partner in the Middle East, and it has asked for additional support to supplement their own defenses and defend the international rules-based order,\u201d Esper said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPresident Trump has long praised Saudi Arabia as a partner and a prolific buyer of American arms. But the kingdom has grown increasingly unpopular among Republican and Democratic lawmakers for its role in a brutal war in Yemen that has left tens of thousands of civilians dead, many from indiscriminate Saudi airstrikes using U.S.-supplied weapons.\n\nThe new deployments, taken together with others authorized within the last month, boost the number of U.S. troops in the Middle East by about 3,000, Esper said. An additional 14,000 U.S. troops have been deployed to the region since the spring, he added, with additional Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps units ready to deploy if necessary.\n\nAD", "description": "Deployments will include two Patriot missile batteries and two fighter squadrons.", "authors": ["Dan Lamothe", "Reporter Covering The Pentagon", "The U.S. Military"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/unP3tv2HVkSzhEheQWKR5kM1tRg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5DHMNJXMIQI6THDNINVA35HTDU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
