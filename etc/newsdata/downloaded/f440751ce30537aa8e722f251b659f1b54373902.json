It\u2019s ripped and has boning hanging out of it, but it still fits beautifully. I find that Westwood\u2019s clothes fit your figure like nothing else, and there\u2019s something really powerful about them.\n\nI love vintage shopping \u2013 it really is my No 1 thing because I hate having what other people have. I love being individual, and obviously it\u2019s helping the planet as well. I found a Westwood jacket on an online vintage shop, too, and I\u2019m really proud of that one because it\u2019s quite rare. I also absolutely love [the clothes-buying app] Depop. You can get so many good bargains on there. These platform shoes from the 90s cost me $30 (\u00a325). They\u2019re by Mudd.\n\nI think that when you\u2019re going out, it\u2019s important to feel confident more than anything else, so I tend to buy clothes that make me feel good. Usually, dresses are my favourite thing to wear; I\u2019ve got so many it\u2019s unreal, and I love 50s styles. I also try really hard to buy only from female designers because it is important to support women. I\u2019m very conscious about my carbon footprint, so I have become more aware of the things that I\u2019m buying.\n\nWhen I was a teenager, I was such an emo that it\u2019s embarrassing. Now I\u2019m all about that Hollywood style: I\u2019ve really grown into myself. I\u2019ve got boobs and I\u2019ve got hips, so I like to wear clothes that flatter my figure. I think that, for years, women were expected to fit into styles that didn\u2019t necessarily suit them, just because that was what the media said looked good. I really try to dress for my shape now.\n\nI think brands need to do more to encourage body positivity; fashion can be a lot more influential than people perhaps realise, and I think it has the ability to make people feel really good about themselves. For a long time, there was this culture of [fashion and beauty] being unattainable, and I think you can still create that fantasy element while making it accessible to everyone.\n\nThe Fashion Fix with Charli Howard is available now on BBC Sounds", "description": "The model on how she learned to ignore what the media says about fashion and found the style that suited her", "authors": ["Leah Harper"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/636dfd8b86fa14bf1e4d043bb15a25a4845d384b/562_746_2062_1237/master/2062.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e408e881968522d003ffb1d10571d6c9", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
