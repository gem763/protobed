New York Times reporter Maureen Dowd reported on the fiasco in September 1987: During an event at the Iowa State Fair, Biden mimicked entire portions of Kinnock's speech from earlier in the year. At one moment, Biden repeated the line that he was the first \"in a thousand generations\" to graduate from college, gesturing to his wife in the exact same way Kinnock did, while also saying the same line about her education and lineage. Biden would later acknowledge that he in fact did have relatives who attended college, directly contrasting the Kinnock lines. As Dowd reported, Biden's staffers were defensive about the allegations of blatant plagiarism. Nevertheless, Biden dropped out of the race by the end of the month.\n\nAs the Trump campaign mentioned, Biden landed himself in hot water yet again this past June after he plagiarized his climate change plan. He blamed his staff for that one.\n\nAs Victoria covered, here was his excuse this time around:\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Joe Biden blamed his staff Wednesday for plagiarism in his new climate change proposal. When asked about the plagiarism, Biden told reporters that his campaign staffers \u201cmade a mistake.\u201d \u201cI think you\u2019re going to see from the campaign an acknowledgment of exactly what happened and what it did. You know, it\u2019s uh, I think it\u2019s uh \u2026 Look, they made a mistake, they corrected it, they acknowledged it, and they let me know about it. And the outfits that some of the language came from are people who support the plan,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat a schmuck.
