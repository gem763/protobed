That is the highest level in three months.\n\nEconomists surveyed by Econoday had forecast a decline to 92.\n\n\u201cSentiment rebounded in early October as consumers anticipated larger income gains and lower inflation during the year ahead. As a result, real income expectations rose to their most favorable level in two decades,\u201d Richard Curtin, the survey\u2019s chief economist, said in a statement.\n\nThe index\u2019s current situation component rose sharply in the first weeks of September, hitting 113.4 from 108.5, the highest level this year. The expectations component, which asks consumers to forecast conditions six months from now, ticked up from 83.4 to 84.8.\n\n\u201cOverall, the data indicate that consumption spending will be strong enough to offset weakness in business investment spending so as to keep the economy expanding into 2020,\u201d Curtin said.", "description": "Expectations for real income gains rose to their highest level in two-decades, according to the University of Michigan's survey. | Economy", "authors": ["John Carney"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/08/labor-day-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
