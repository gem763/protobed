The thing that scared me most about making 'Avatar 2' and 'Avatar 3' was that the market might have shifted so much that it simply was no longer possible to get people that excited about going and sitting in a dark room with a bunch of strangers to watch something.\u201d\n\n\u201c 'Avatar\u2019 set a record that was seemingly unconquerable and held the title of highest-grossing movie of all-time for about a decade,\u201d Paul Dergarabedian, a senior media analyst for Comscore told Fox Business.\n\n\u201cAppropriately, it took an 'end of an era' Marvel blockbuster to take the crown after posting the biggest opening weekend ever, breaking numerous box office land speed records, enjoying great reviews and an appreciation by critics to surpass the near $3 billion global revenue of \u2018Avatar,\u2019\u201d Dergarabedian added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCameron\u2019s track record is impressive with \"Titanic\" in 1997 holding the crown of biggest box office earner for several years before being bumped off by \"Avatar\" in 2009.\n\nCameron will have plenty of opportunity to regain his throne as \"Avatar 2\" is expected to be released in theaters on Dec. 17, 2021, and \"Avatar 3\" should see theaters in 2023. If those films do as well as expected the fourth and fifth films in that series are expected to roll out in 2024 and 2027, which will keep fans of the space-adventure franchise happy for years to come and for plenty of opportunities for Cameron to earn back the top spot.\n\n\u201cWill Avatar 2 and 3 be able to create that kind of success in the zeitgeist? Who knows. We\u2019re trying. Maybe we do, maybe we don\u2019t, but the point is, it\u2019s still possible,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cI\u2019m happy to see it, as opposed to an alternate scenario where, with the rapid availability, custom-designed experience that everybody can create for themselves with streaming services and all the different platforms, that [theatrical potential] might not have existed anymore.\u201d\n\nDespite the huge earnings of \"Avatar\" and \"Endgame,\" \u201cGone with the Wind\u201d outranks all films as the most successful film ever when proceeds are adjusted for inflation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just glad it still exists because I\u2019m all about the big screen,\u201d Cameron says of the movie going experience. \u201cNot that I wouldn\u2019t do something for streaming where you can get into the characters in a different way but what I love the most to do is to create that completely kind of subsuming experience where you turn off your phone and you engage. You as an audience member engage for two hours or two and a half hours, whatever it is. And that still exists!\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nIt will take a juggernaut to knock off \"Endgame\" by perhaps earning as much as $3 billion.\n\n\u201cThis to say the least is, a very high bar and it will literally take the movie equivalent of the 100-year-flood to overtake \u2018Avengers: Endgame,\u2019 but no one thought \u2018Avatar\u2019 would ever relinquish the crown and perhaps someday history will repeat itself if and when \u2018Endgame\u2019 passes the box office torch to another worthy cinematic juggernaut,\u201d Dergarabedian said.", "description": "\"Avengers: Endgame\" passes \"Avatar\" in total box office revenue.", "authors": ["Mike Cherico"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/04/0/0/AP19116634364555.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
