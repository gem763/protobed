What trade war?", "language": "en", "text": "Consumers, from their position of relative safety, have not screamed to stop the trade war. Moreover, even as prices increase more noticeably, they may remain sedate: They are notoriously impossible to mobilize politically.\n\nIt is perhaps more puzzling that America\u2019s businesses have not put up a bigger fight, because they have borne the brunt of Trump\u2019s tariffs.\n\nTrump\u2019s neutralization of the American corporate community began when he started the trade war in their name. The tariffs are supposedly in response to mistreatment of American companies by the Chinese authorities. That messaging campaign led some industry groups to praise the Trump administration\u2019s tough treatment of China (though far fewer went so far as to endorse the tariffs).\n\nThe pushback has also been muted by the on-again, off-again, rhythm of Trump\u2019s trade war, with near victories announced, and then unannounced, every few months. Whenever a deal seems imminent, hopes are raised that the tariffs are working, in the sense that they could extract meaningful concessions from the Chinese. Pushing Trump to get rid of them, in these moments, seems counterproductive\u2014and the moments keep coming.", "description": "", "authors": ["Chad Brown", "Theatlantic.Com Ideas Archive Trump-Trade-War-Muted"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
