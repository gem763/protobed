In 2018-19, Messi notched 54 goals in 58 appearances at a rate of 86 minutes per goal. The Barcelona man also provided 20 assists for his team-mates.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo opted to stay at home on Monday night as Lionel Messi swept another gong\n\nRonaldo, meanwhile, didn't get anywhere near the scoring record of his counterpart last season. His 31 goals in 47 appearances may be impressive in comparison to mere mortals, but the 34-year-old was some way off Messi.\n\nIn another stinging blow to Ronaldo, Monday night's victory means that Messi has won the Best Award for a sixth time, one better than the Juventus man.\n\nInstead of mixing with footballing royalty in Milan, Ronaldo stayed at home and read a book. Posting a picture on Instagram, he said: 'Patience and persistence are two characteristics that differentiate the professional from the amateur.\n\nBarcelona star Messi picked up the gong for the sixth time after yet another wonderful season\n\nThe Portuguese supremo did, however, make the final cut for the Men's Team of the Year\n\n'Everything that is big today has started small. You can't do everything, but do everything you can to make your dreams come true. And keep in mind that after night always comes dawn.'\n\nRonaldo did make the Men's Team of the Year at the awards, however, lining up with Messi and PSG star Kylian Mbappe as a forward trio.\n\nFormer Real Madrid team-mates Sergio Ramos, Marcelo and Luka Modric also made the eleven. None of Liverpool's star forwards Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino or Sadio Mane made the team.", "description": "Despite only being a couple of hours down the road from Turin, the Portuguese supremo did not attend the star-studded awards ceremony in Milan.", "authors": ["Ollie Lewis For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/23/23/18845224-0-image-a-78_1569276385006.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
