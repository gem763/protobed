Rain always makes it miserable and slow.\n\nThere was already a bad enough collision on the eastbound Highway 417 that the OPP closed the highway for a while after 5:30 a.m.\n\nThe rain will probably also hold up the planned reopening of the ramp from Lees Avenue to the eastbound 417, which has been six and a half years in the making.\n\n\n\nThanks, rain.\n\nThe weather is also responsible for delaying the planned environmental protest on the Laurier Bridge until tomorrow at 10 a.m.\n\nHave a great day!\n\nIf you have a traffic or commuter gripe about driving, cycling or being a pedestrian commuter \u2014 anything from problem intersections, to parking, to inefficient routes \u2014 send it to doug.hempstead@cbc.ca.\n\nAnd remember, you can share what you see on the roads with me on Twitter at @cbcotttraffic. Or give me a ring at 613-288-6900.", "description": "It's wet and that's wretched news in Ottawa, where rain\u00a0always makes it miserable and slow.
