He claims they have 'forgotten how dangerous these diseases can be'\n\nBritain risks returning to the days when children were \u2018dying like flies\u2019 from measles because of rising complacency over vaccinations, a United Nations expert has warned.\n\nDr Robin Nandy, chief of immunisations at Unicef, said parents and doctors have \u2018dropped their guard\u2019 against the illness. He highlighted the loss of the UK\u2019s measles-free status as a sign of how falling vaccination rates threaten to reverse decades of progress against infectious diseases.\n\nDr Nandy said: \u2018People have forgotten how dangerous these diseases can be. I\u2019m from the generation of physicians that have seen children dying like flies of measles in sub-Saharan Africa. It\u2019s something that completely sticks in your mind.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018If you look at younger doctors in high-income countries, they have not seen outbreaks of measles killing children in large numbers.\n\nBut the current resurgence of measles needs to remind us that if we drop our guard then all our success against measles could be reversed.\n\nDr Nandy said health officials and parents 'no longer [treat] immunisation as a priority because they had begun to take vaccines for granted' (stock image)\n\n\u2018We have had one of the most successful magic bullets ever, in the form of vaccine and immunisations. Let\u2019s not go back to where we were.\u2019\n\nIn an interview with the Daily Mail, Dr Nandy said health officials and parents no longer treated immunisation as a priority because they had begun to \u2018take vaccines for granted\u2019.\n\nHe urged the Government to make the vaccinations the \u2018highest priority\u2019, echoing the Mail\u2019s call for a massive publicity drive to reassure parents that vaccines, particularly MMR, are both safe and vital.\n\nSpeaking at the Unicef headquarters in New York, Dr Nandy said: \u2018From the economic side alone, it is a no-brainer for governments. The NHS is struggling and vaccination is a very inexpensive intervention.\n\nMeasles cases have soared, with the disease striking 991 children last year \u2013 treble the 2017 total. Official figures analysed by the Mail reveal that across Europe only France has more children without protection against the disease\n\n\u2018The cost of vaccines is nothing compared to the cost of treatment if you end up in hospital with measles and complications.\u2019\n\nThe Mail\u2019s \u2018Give the children their jabs campaign\u2019 launched last week amid soaring cases of measles fuelled by falling vaccination rates.\n\nFor MMR, 90.3 per cent of children had their first dose in 2018-19, down from 91.2 per cent the year before, continuing a five-year downward trend. Some 86.4 per cent received their second dose of the MMR vaccine by their fifth birthday, a fall from 87.2 per cent in the previous year.\n\nMeasles struck 991 children in England and Wales last year, treble the total for 2017. Across Europe, only France has more children without protection against the disease.\n\nDr Nandy, who has been chief of immunisation for the UN\u2019s children agency since 2015, added: \u2018At Unicef we fully support the Daily Mail campaign. Every child should have the right to vaccination.\n\n\u2018Vaccination is an intervention that is effective, safe, widely available and relatively inexpensive. It has been proven over the past several decades to save children\u2019s lives from illness and complications.\u2019 He added: \u2018After a positive trajectory over many decades then progress has stalled. It is really, really concerning.\u2019\n\nThere were 364,808 cases of measles reported to the World Health Organisation in the first six months of this year \u2013 triple the amount seen in 2018, and the highest level since 2006. Dr Nandy called on social media companies to tackle anti-vaccine misinformation spread online.\n\nHe said: \u2018Anti-vaccine sentiment is as old as the vaccine itself. The UK has been the centre of anti-vaxx movement ever since the smallpox vaccine was developed in the 1800s.\n\n\u2018But it is growing as a problem because the way people get the information has changed. Social media messages are spread far more effectively than during the days of the carrier pigeon.\u2019\n\nDozens of influential health experts have thrown their support behind the Daily Mail\u2019s childhood vaccination campaign, including Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Simon Stevens, head of NHS England.\n\nGraphic shows where jab uptakes are the lowest across London (top) and the UK as a whole (bottom)\n\nThe Academy of Medical Royal Colleges last night became the latest major body to back our campaign. Its chairman, Professor Carrie MacEwen, said: \u2018The MMR vaccine is a proven lifesaver, but it only works if all children are vaccinated, so parents have a duty to make sure their children get the jab.\n\n\u2018The Daily Mail is right to warn of the dangers to the population that are being caused by online scare stories and fake news.\u2019", "description": "Parents and officials 'take vaccinations for granted' and have 'forgotten' how dangerous diseases are, says Unicef's Dr Robin Nandy.
