It also regards the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, which was allied to the US, as a terrorist group.\n\nSpeaking in the Commons this morning Mr Raab said the invasion was 'reckless, it is counter-productive and it plays straight into the hands of Russia and indeed the Assad regime.'\n\nHe added: 'From the outset the UK government has warned Turkey against taking this military action and, as we feared, it has seriously undermined the stability and the security of the region.\n\n'It risks worsening the humanitarian crisis and increasing the suffering of millions of refugees. And it also undermines the international effort that should be focused on defeating Daesh.\n\nSpeaking in the Commons this morning Mr Raab said the invasion was 'reckless, it is counter-productive and it plays straight into the hands of Russia and indeed the Assad regime'\n\nTurkish-backed Syrian militia fighters have entered areas of the country controlled by the Turds, who have been in a long-running conflict with Ankara for decades.\n\nSmoke rising over the Syrian town of Ras al-Ain today, as seen from the Turkish border town of Ceylanpinar\n\n'The UK takes its arms export control responsibilities very seriously and in this case we will keep our defence exports to Turkey under very careful and continual review.\n\n'I can tell the House that no further export licences to Turkey for items which might be used in military operations in Syria will be granted while we conduct that review.'\n\nUS president Donald Trump imposed sanctions on Turkey on Monday and demanded the NATO ally stop the military incursion that is rapidly reshaping the battlefield of the world's deadliest ongoing war.\n\nMr Trump, who gave what critics say was a de facto green light for Turkey's assault by ordering US forces away from the conflict area, requested the ceasefire in a call with President Erdogan.\n\n'The United States of America simply is not going to tolerate Turkey's invasion in Syria any further. We are calling on Turkey to stand down, end the violence and come to the negotiating table,' Vice President Mike Pence told reporters.\n\nSyrian National Army (SNA) members are seen as they launch an operation against the Kurds in Syria's Ras al-Ayn\n\nTrump also announced plans to reimpose steel tariffs on Turkey and immediately halt negotiations on a $100 billion trade deal.\n\nShadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry told the Common today that the situation in northern Syria 'has gone from bad to worse, to utterly catastrophic and horrifying since the Trump administration withdrew its troops and gave a green light to Turkey to invade'.\n\nMs Thornberry told the Commons Turkish airstrikes and artillery barrages, as well as 'barbaric jihadi death squads', have led to the deaths of dozens of civilians.\n\nShe said it was clear the Kurds would be driven 'reluctantly' to side with Syria and Russia 'simply for their own protection'.\n\nSNA) member fires at targets in Syria's Ras al-Ayn rural after the city center was cleared\n\nTurkey, which has been fighting Kurds for decades, insisted it is targeting the PKK terrorist group. It also regards the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, which was allied to the US, as a terrorist group\n\nShe added: 'What is the Government's strategy on Syria? Is seems likely that responsibility for tackling the Daesh remnants, escapees, and sleeper cells will fall not to the Coalition, but to the Kurds and the Assad regime between them.'\n\nAllan Hogarth, Amnesty International UK's head of policy and government affairs, said it was the right decision by the Government and 'hasn't come a moment too soon'.\n\nBut he said the Government 'must also be clear that this will also apply to all existing licences'.\n\n'The UK has a responsibility to minimise the risk of UK weaponry contributing to violations of international humanitarian law,' he said.\n\n'What the UK has done in days over Turkey, it should have done years ago over Saudi Arabia given the carnage the Saudi-led coalition has caused in Yemen.\n\n'Today's move over Turkey is welcome, but it's a reminder of how ramshackle and inconsistent the UK's arms control system actually is.'", "description": "Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said that no licenses would be granted for material that could be used in the ground and air offense by Recep Erdogan's forces.", "authors": ["David Wilcock", "Whitehall Correspondent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/12/19738024-0-image-a-18_1571139127822.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
