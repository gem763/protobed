He died in 1993 from a gunshot wound aged just 44.\n\nWe spoke to Roberto Escobar, who told us the tactics used in this case were markedly different from the approach Pablo and his cartel would have taken.\n\n\u2018In the past, I would call my hitman and show him a photo,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018Anywhere in the world, regardless of protection, that person would immediately agree with our terms.\n\n\u2018Now, we call our lawyers.\u2019\n\nWe asked what sort of products Escobar Inc. will sell and Roberto said: \u2018This is remaining a secret my friend. We will only sell the best and the latest products in the world. All legal.\n\n\u2018Yes, in the beginning Pablo and I sold legal products, then it became full of powder.\n\n\u2018Powder that the American Gringos in the big White House call drugs. Those guys are the biggest drug dealers themselves!\n\n\u2018They invented all these powders. I was a poor boy, me and Pablo, all we did, was to sell some goods.\u2019\n\nHowever, he did also admit that it was more difficult to make huge amounts of money when selling legal products and added: \u2018Narcos is very fast and easy money.\n\n\u2018But fast money does not last.\u2019\n\nOlof Gustafsson, CEO of Escobar Inc., said Pablo spent hundreds of millions of dollars \u2018maintaining his image\u2019 and the company which bears his name would continue to legally fight anyone who stood in its way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said: \u2018We are pleased with the outcome.\n\n\u2018We are warning anyone that is doing anything relating to Pablo Escobar or profiting off our name to immediately cease those activities, we will punish anyone legally who is not paying us and not properly licensed or authorized by Escobar Inc.\u2019", "description": "A company run by the cocaine kingpin's family now uses legal tactics to destroy its enemies.", "authors": ["Jasper Hamill"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_89318229_1570785067.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
