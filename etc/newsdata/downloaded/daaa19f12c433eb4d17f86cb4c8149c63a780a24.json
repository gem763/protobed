She screened three baskets of stocks under each scenario: Value dividend; quality dividend; and quality growth, a category that also had a dividend component.\n\nThe top performers in each economic scenario were value dividend stocks. When the ISM index was falling, and the S&P 500 returned 4.4%, for instance, value dividend stocks gained 6.4%. In the recession scenario, when the market lost 12.7%, value dividend declined by 4.6%. And in the periods of Fed monetary easing, when the market gained 16%, value dividend rose by 28.5%.\n\nThose gains beat the returns of the two other categories of stocks under each scenario.\n\nCalvasina is relatively bearish on the market now. She sees risks of another pullback for stocks, based on lofty valuations and parallels to rallies in 2010, 2011, and 2016.\n\n\u201cThe valuation and positioning problems that set the stage for this year\u2019s pullbacks have not been fully resolved,\u201d she writes. Valuations are near historic highs and positioning by equities futures traders implies that we could see another selloff, Calvasina says.\n\nThe market is also vulnerable to bad news, she added, such as negative developments in the U.S.-China trade war. And since stocks may be at the tail end of a long bull market, profit-taking by traders could add to the selling pressure, the strategist argues.\n\nValue dividend stocks wouldn\u2019t produce positive returns in a bear market or recession. But the stocks should hold up better than growth stocks with steep multiples. And there are signs that investors are shifting to value over growth, based on the movement of money into and out of exchange-traded funds and other market trends.\n\nCalvasina expects the rotation to value to continue whether or not the economy gains momentum or slips into a recession. Earnings forecasts for growth stocks are only slightly higher than they are for value, she notes. And \u201cgrowth looks expensive now, unlike the past decade when it has looked cheap.\u201d\n\nRBC recommends 10 value dividend stocks, five based on screens and five because of analysts\u2019 recommendations.\n\nThe screened stocks each rank in the bottom third of the S&P 500 in terms of their forward price/earnings ratios and in the bottom third for price relative to operating cash flow over the last 12 months. They rank in the top half of the market for dividend yield and have payout ratios of less than 100% of earnings. That is a sign that they should be able to maintain their dividends. They are also rated Outperform by RBC analysts.\n\nGeneral Motors (ticker: GM), Halliburton (HAL), LyondellBasel Industries (LYB), Prudential Financial (PRU), and Valero Energy (VLO) all cleared those hurdles.\n\nThe other five stocks are companies that RBC analysts selected as some of their best ideas, based on value and quality measures. Those stocks are Applied Materials (AMAT), Dow (DOW), Duke Energy (DUK), Energy Transfer LP (ET), and Targa Resources (TRGP).\n\nThe 10 are all income-oriented stocks with relatively low valuations. Here\u2019s a look at the five of the stocks that passed RBC\u2019s screen.\n\nGM trades at 5.6 times 2019 earnings and yields 4.1%. RBC analyst Joseph Spak has a $52 price target on the stock, up from recent prices around $37. A strike by auto workers has taken down the shares, though it may resolved soon. Spak says GM\u2019s restructuring should help it weather the next U.S. auto-sales downturn, and he views GM\u2019s investments in robo-taxis and other autonomous vehicles as a long-term competitive advantage.\n\nHalliburton trades at 15 times earnings and yields 3.8%. The oil-field services company should be a \u201ccore holding for large-cap energy investors,\u201d given an improving outlook for domestic production and offshore drilling, writes RBC analyst Kurt Hallead. The stock has been hammered this year, falling 28.8%.\n\nHallead views it as too cheap to pass up. He sees the stock hitting $35, up from a recent price around $18.93.\n\nLyondellBasel trades at just 8.6 times earnings with a 4.8% yield. The company is one of the world\u2019s largest plastics, chemicals and refinery businesses, with a leading position in the polyethylene market. Demand for plastics in consumer products and industrial goods should support growth for Lyondell of 1.5 times the rate of increase in gross domestic product over the next two to three years, writes RBC\u2019s Arun Viswanathan. He has a $95 price target on the stock, up from $88 recently.\n\nPrudential Financial is a diversified insurance and financial services firm. The stock has been weak this year, gaining just 11%, as interest rates have fallen (reducing returns on its fixed-income investments), but it would do well if rates start to rise, according to RBC analyst Mark Dwelle.\n\nPrudential\u2019s variable annuity business is rebounding after years of slow sales. The firm has consistently delivered 15% returns on equity through its diversified mix of U.S. and non-U.S. businesses, Dwelle writes. He has a $110 price target on the stock, up from $89 recently. Shares trade at 7.4 times earnings and yield 4.4%.\n\nValero is one of the lowest-cost oil, gas, and petrochemical refiners, according to RBC\u2019s Brad Heffern. The firm has \u201csignificant leverage\u201d to the U.S. Gulf Coast refining market, a major hub for domestic production and exports that could provide a buffer against weakening U.S. demand.\n\nValero also has a strong return-of-capital program, Heffern writes, with $11 billion paid to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends from 2015 to 2018. He values Valero at $98 a share, up from a recent price around $85. The stock trades at 16.8 times earnings and yields 4.3%.\n\nWrite to Daren Fonda at daren.fonda@barrons.com", "description": "General Motors, Halliburton, and Prudential Financial are on a list of companies identified by RBC Capital Markets.", "authors": ["Daren Fonda"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-111783/social", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
