You have that moment where you know things have to change.\"\n\n\"He was just a really nice man and there was nothing to suggest he would treat me in any other way.\"\n\nThings did change though when she gave birth to their child.\n\nHe began to try to control her, stop her seeing her friends and stop her from going out.\n\nShe said: \"For me, there was never any violence involved from him, it was all mental and financial abuse.\n\n\"It started off with I couldn't go out and see my friends, then I could only go out to take our son to school.\n\n\"He got into gambling too and would just fritter money away.\n\n\"One of my friends refused to speak to me as I wouldn't end it. But now it is over we are friends again.\n\n\"Before all of this, I would walk in the room and people would know I had arrived, when it was all happening I was a shadow of my former self.\n\n\"I was quiet, unsociable and completely different to how I was.\"\n\n(Image: REX/Shutterstock)\n\nEventually she ended it with her partner.\n\nShe said: \"For me there was a light-bulb moment. I knew something had to change here.\n\n\"No one should put up with this abuse, whether you are a man or woman victim. There are groups and people out there who can help you and get you out of the situation.\n\n\"Now I have slowly, but surely, started to get my confidence back. I have got a job now and I have rebuilt my life. I go out now, I have friends and I have come out the other side.\n\n\"It is easy to say it, but you have to take that first step and you can get through it.\"\n\nThe Home Office definition of domestic abuse is \"any incident or pattern of incidents of controlling, coercive or threatening behaviour, violence or abuse between those aged 16 or over who are or have been intimate partners or family members regardless of gender or sexuality.\"\n\nClick here to find out more about how to get help for domestic abuse.", "description": "\"No one should put up with this abuse, whether you are a man or woman victim.
