Circuit Judge Joseph Bulone referred to the convicted killer as a \u201cwanna-be\u2019\u2019 law enforcement officer and a self-appointed \u201chandicapped parking-space monitor.\u2019\u2019\n\nDrejka, 49, had engaged in an argument with McGlockton\u2019s girlfriend, Britany Jacobs, in July 2018 over parking in a spot for handicapped people without the proper permit. She had stayed in the car with the couple\u2019s younger children while McGlockton went in the store with their 5-year-old son.\n\nWhen another customer alerted McGlockton to the dispute, he came out and pushed Drejka to the ground. Surveillance video shows McGlockton backing up with his arms to his side when Drejka pulls out a gun from a sitting position.\n\nMcGlockton was turning toward the front of the store and away from the gunman when he was shot once in the torso, then ran into the store and collapsed in front of his son, Markeis Jr. He was pronounced dead at a hospital.\n\nAt the sentencing, Bulone pointed out the irony of Drejka parking illegally next to Jacobs\u2019 car and confronting her about parking improperly.\n\n\u201cHe just seems to come out of nowhere, kind of like a superhero, to see that he enforces the handicapped parking spot,\u201d Bulone said.\n\nJacobs and McGlockton\u2019s parents spoke at an emotional hearing before the sentence was announced, asking for Drejka to get the maximum penalty of 30 years in prison.\n\n\u201cThere are no words to fully describe what his loss has done to our family,\u201d Jacobs said. \u201cOur youngest two children will never have memories of their daddy.\u201d\n\nThe defense read a letter of support from Drejka\u2019s wife, who said she and other relatives and friends had received threats and decided to stay away from the courtroom.\n\nPinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri initially declined to arrest Drejka, citing the controversial \u201cstand your ground\u2019\u2019 law, which allows citizens to use deadly force if they fear \u201cimminent death or great bodily harm.\u2019\u2019\n\nProsecutors eventually charged Drejka, noting in the complaint that he had a similar heated encounter over a handicapped spot with another resident three months before his confrontation with McGlockton.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: 'Stand your ground' case: Parking lot killer in Florida gets 20 years", "description": "A white man who cited Florida's \"stand your ground'' law in the killing of an unarmed black man after a parking dispute was sentenced to 20 years in prison.", "authors": ["Jorge L.
