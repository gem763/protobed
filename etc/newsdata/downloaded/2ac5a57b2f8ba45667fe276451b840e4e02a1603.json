Three teams\u2014the New York Yankees, Houston Astros and Los Angeles Dodgers\u2014could finish the regular season with 105 wins, something that has never happened before. It has created the perception that the upcoming playoffs are little more than an anticlimactic undercard before an inevitable World Series matchup between these top dogs.\n\nThe Atlanta Braves see things differently. They\u2019ve spent all year hearing that they exist only to be an early October tuneup for the three teams that actually matter. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the Braves believe somebody could very well could beat the Dodgers, Yankees and Astros\u2014and that \u201csomebody\u201d should be them.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a real superteam in baseball,\u201d veteran Braves reliever Jerry Blevins said. \u201cIt\u2019s fun to write about. You want to see this dynasty. You have the Patriots, you have the Warriors, so everybody\u2019s like, \u2018Who\u2019s the baseball one?\u2019 But baseball\u2019s just a different animal.\u201d\n\nThe first reason to start believing in the Braves is a simple one: They are a ridiculously good baseball team. Maybe not quite as good as the Big 3, but it\u2019s close.\n\nThe Braves are on pace to rack up about 100 wins, which would make 2019 the first season in MLB history with four teams reaching the century mark. They rank second in the National League in runs (behind the Dodgers) and fifth in ERA. They\u2019ve won more games than anybody in the majors against opponents with a .500 record or better, giving them a massive lead in what is perhaps the toughest division in the majors.\n\nTheir first baseman, Freddie Freeman, is on track to put up 40 home runs and 120-plus RBIs, vaulting him into the MVP conversation. Their 21-year-old outfield prodigy, Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr., is on the verge of becoming just the fifth player ever with 40 homers and 40 stolen bases in the same season. Their ace pitcher, 22-year-old right-hander Mike Soroka, has the second-best ERA in baseball at 2.57, only behind the Dodgers\u2019 Hyun-Jin Ryu (2.35).\n\nAtlanta Braves first baseman Freddie Freeman is on track to put up 40 home runs and 120-plus RBIs.

Guys can just focus on going out there and winning each day and not worry about the hype.\u201d\n\nThe Braves expected to be in this position. After missing the postseason in four consecutive seasons, they exceeded expectations in 2018 by storming to the NL East title, led by young stars like Acu\u00f1a and second baseman Ozzie Albies, now 22. Though they lost in four games to the Dodgers in the division series, they accomplished enough for Anthopoulos to declare, \u201cThe rebuilding is over, and now it\u2019s all about winning.\u201d\n\nYet while the Braves believed in themselves, the cold, hard data didn\u2019t believe in the Braves. Pecota, Baseball Prospectus\u2019 sophisticated computer model for forecasting on-field performance, predicted the Braves would land in fourth place in their division with a record 10 games below .500.\n\nAsked about that, Freeman smiled and said, \u201cWe didn\u2019t spend $400 million in an off-season,\u201d a jab at the Philadelphia Phillies, who will almost certainly fall short of the postseason despite giving Bryce Harper a $330 million free-agent contract last winter.\n\n\u201cYou have a little bit of a chip on your shoulder,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cWe went out and proved a lot of people wrong again this year.\u201d\n\nAnthopoulos\u2019s big move came in the form of a $23 million contract to third baseman Josh Donaldson, the largest one-year free agent deal ever awarded to a position player. After an injury-plagued 2018, Donaldson has thrived in Atlanta, posting an OPS above .900 and approaching 40 homers. The Braves struck again in June, snatching up free agent Dallas Keuchel and watching him pitch like an ace over the last month. They bolstered their bullpen at the trade deadline, adding Mark Melancon, Shane Greene and Chris Martin in the span of less than 24 hours.\n\nIt\u2019s resulted in the Braves compiling, through Monday, the best record in all of baseball since Memorial Day at 63-34, better than the Astros (62-34), Yankees (63-35) and Dodgers (61-36).\n\n\u201cAll it\u2019s about is who\u2019s hot in the playoffs,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cYou can play well for 162 games, but once October hits it\u2019s a whole new ballgame.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why the idea of a superteam is antithetical to baseball compared to other sports. It isn\u2019t that the best team doesn\u2019t always win\u2014it\u2019s that the best team almost always loses.\n\nMike Soroka has emerged as the ace of the Atlanta Braves.

That includes the 2001 Seattle Mariners (116 regular-season wins), the 2004 St. Louis Cardinals (105) and the 2017 Dodgers (104), all of whom ultimately lost in October. Just making the World Series is far from a guarantee: Since \u201995, the team with the top seed in its league has won the pennant just 35% of the time.\n\nThe other sports don\u2019t have anywhere near that level of unpredictability in the postseason. Or as Anthopoulos put it, \u201cHow many times in the NBA does the 8 seed get to the Finals? And look how many wild-card examples we have.\u201d (One and 12, respectively, since \u201995.)\n\nStill, the Braves recognize that as the playoffs begin in a couple of weeks, much of the focus will be on the Yankees, Astros and Dodgers. They\u2019re OK with that. The Dodgers have played in two straight World Series. The Astros won the championship in 2017. The Yankees are the Yankees. The Braves haven\u2019t won a title since 1995.\n\nFor that to change, the Braves know what they will have to do: topple the kings.\n\n\u201cThose three teams deserve the recognition they\u2019re getting. It isn\u2019t a fluke,\u201d Donaldson said. \u201cIn order for us to get to that level, we\u2019re going to have to win those meaningful games.\u201d\n\nShare Your Thoughts What are your predictions for the MLB postseason?
