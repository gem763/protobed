Dozens of senior editors and journalists from Latin America and Africa attended the opening ceremony. They were welcomed by smart robots nicknamed Xiao Meng who opened their arms at the gate of the new headquarters of People\u2019s Daily.\n\nThe Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is Communist Party chairman Xi Jinping\u2019s multi-trillion-dollar project. It seeks to connect China to the rest of Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America through a network of physical and digital infrastructure.\n\nMany emerging economies across Africa and to a lesser extent European, Asian, Middle Eastern, and Latin American countries have already signed on to the ambitious project.\n\nPeople\u2019s Daily conceded that BRNN would play a vital and unique role in promoting and cultivating BRI.\n\n\u201cResponding on President Xi\u2019s proposal, the BRNN was established as a key measure to deepen the Belt and Road media cooperation and people-to-people exchanges,\u201d it added.\n\nThe vast majority of media outlets in China are state-run entities used to spread pro-Beijing messages. BRNN is no exception.\n\nIt is expected to promote the notion that BRI is intended to help recipient countries, not serve as a vehicle for debt traps that benefit China.\n\nChina inaugurated the BRI-focused outlet on April 22. The People\u2019s Daily noted that publishes in six languages including Chinese, English, French, Russian, Arabic, and Spanish. It acknowledged that BRNN would play a vital and unique role in promoting and cultivating, adding:\n\nThe visiting journalists agreed that the BRNN provides a platform for equal dialogues and mutual inspiration among the BRI countries and their people. Mainstream media outlets along the Belt and Road will further expand cooperation, innovate cooperation modes, enrich cooperation content and jointly build the BRNN into a platform of news sharing, exchanges, and cooperation, as well as communication.\n\nThe U.S. has warned that China is seeking to use BRI to accomplish its dream of global hegemony.\n\nChina is also using BRI to push its communist and a form of debt trap colonialism, some American experts told U.S. lawmakers in May.\n\nSome concerns about being unable to pay China are beginning to surface in Africa and elsewhere, but China denies the U.S. accusations, dismissing them as a smearing campaign.", "description": "China launched a workshop under its Belt and Road News Network (BRNN) aimed at promoting propaganda about its infrastructure initiative.", "authors": ["Edwin Mora"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/belt-and-road-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
