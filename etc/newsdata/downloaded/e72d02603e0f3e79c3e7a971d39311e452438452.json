He then proceed to play golf, very bad optics, even if it was a quick game, as he said, and of course we know the President never lies or embellish the truth. The meeting in Poland was to remember a very historic and tragic event that had huge consequences for the whole world. He cancelled his trip to my native Denmark because he got upset over the wording of the Prime Ministers reply. It was very rude of him, it was in the last minute and he had been invited by the Queen, not prime minister. I get the feeling he just wants to stay home and play golf. Perhaps he should not run for re election, he then will have all the freedom to do what he want. Seems like he likes all the trappings that comes with the office, but not the responsibility.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/C1OPM3rGroNVHaii_5GEMA--~B/aD0zMDAwO3c9MjAwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/glamour_497/10a8f381661b25dd5dd74f7b7db82217"}
