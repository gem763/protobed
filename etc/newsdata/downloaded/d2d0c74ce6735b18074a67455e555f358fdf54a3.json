With luck, your browser should have already updated by now to the brand-new version, which comes with bug fixes, security patches, and speedier, hovering boxes when you move your mouse over tabs.

Google will scan any usernames and passwords against its database of breaches\u2014and, yes, this information is hashed so you aren\u2019t just sending your plaintext information back and forth to a Google server somewhere. Password Leak Detection is basically a built-in version of the Password Checkup extension Google previously released, if that helps.\n\nTo enable Password Leak Detection in Chrome 78, first make sure you\u2019re running Chrome 78 by clicking on the triple-dot icon in the upper-right corner of your browser, hovering over \u201cHelp,\u201d and clicking on \u201cAbout Google Chrome.\u201d Your browser will check to make sure it\u2019s running the latest version; if not, it\u2019ll download it and prompt you to update.\n\nOnce you\u2019re ready, type chrome://flags/#password-leak-detection into your browser address bar, hit Enter, and enable the feature.\n\nScreenshot: David Murphy\n\nHow to enable Chrome 78's \u201cForce Dark Mode\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve talked about this before, so I\u2019ll make this quick. Chrome 78's \u201cForce Dark Mode\u201d feature allows you to give websites a dark mode that might not otherwise have a style set up for people that prefer a darker look and feel. Instead of being blasted by a bright, white page, Chrome will instead approximate what it thinks a dark theme should look like. So, for Lifehacker, that becomes:\n\nScreenshot: David Murphy\n\nIt\u2019s not gorgeous, but it gets the job done if you despise being surprised by bright websites. (Rhymes unintentional.) To turn on Force Dark Mode, simply enter chrome://flags/#enable-force-dark in your address bar, hit Enter, and turn the feature on.", "description": "Chrome 78 is here.
