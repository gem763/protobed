I think we should all hope and pray for the best, but we have to prepare that this could have major impacts on the state of Florida,\" said Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. \"If you look at the National Hurricane Center's current track, I think it ends up within 30 miles of the coast of Florida. Well guess what? You do just a touch of a bump one way or another, and you have a dramatic difference all of a sudden.\"\n\nCenter Director Ken Graham is telling residents don't bet on safety just because his office specific forecast track has the storm just a bit offshore.\n\n\"The cone is so important,\" Graham said.\n\nAnd making matters more touch-and-go is that with every new forecast, \"we keep nudging (Dorian's track) a little bit to the left,\" which is closer to the Florida coast, he said.\n\nDorian is a powerful but small hurricane with hurricane-force winds Sunday only extending 29 miles to the west, but they are expecting to grow a bit. That makes forecasting the storm's path along the coast \u2014 either just off the coast, skirting it or moving inland with a direct hit \u2014 delicate and difficult. Just a few miles west or east makes the difference between devastation and bad but not horrible damage, meteorologists said.\n\nA man stands on a store's roof as he works to prepare it for the arrival of Hurricane Dorian in Freeport on Grand Bahama, Bahamas, Sunday, Sept. 1, 2019.

That means just a smidge of a movement days ahead of time, while Dorian is in the Bahamas, can reverberate and mean a direct hit or not, said private meteorologist Ryan Maue.\n\nThat can happen just because of the timing of when Dorian's eyewall collapses and is replaced, which happens normally in storms.\n\nAdding to that problem is Dorian's slow, almost snail-like pace. What initially looked like a Labor Day storm for the U.S. is now approaching Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\n\"People are getting impatient with this,\" McNoldy said. Because the threat seems to keep sticking around, it could be a problem getting the right message across, he said.\n\nKlotzbach said he thinks the U.S. East Coast will get \"scraped,\" but Dorian will stay just offshore, something Maue agrees with.\n\nMaue warns, however, that two days of high waves and heavy storm surge \u2014 the hurricane center is predicting 4 to 7 feet from West Palm Beach north to Cocoa Beach area \u2014 could severely damage Florida's beaches.\n\nResidents along Florida's coast are relieved that the forecast, for now, doesn't have Dorian making landfall in Florida, but are still preparing for the worst.\n\nKevin Browning in Vero Beach has put up hurricane shutters, bought a generator and is stocked with supplies.\n\n\"I'm thanking God, now, that it's turned a little bit towards the east, but that's a forecast, and we never know. I'm just praying and trying to make sure that everybody's safe. I feel for the Bahamas and I'm praying for them, and I thank God it's not coming directly to us right now.\"", "description": "Whether a hurricane moves just a few miles west or east makes the difference between devastation and bad but not horrible damage, meteorologists say.", "authors": ["Seth Borenstein", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d6ca6af21214c70640304af-1536-768.jpg"}
