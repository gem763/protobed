REUTERS/Tingshu Wang\n\nHouston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey apologised on Monday for a Twitter post over the weekend backing the Hong Kong protests. The comment, quickly deleted, sparked anger in China, and broadcasters, sportswear companies and sponsors have said they would review their relationship with the league.\n\nThe NBA initially described the anger over the message as \u201cregrettable,\u201d but commissioner Adam Silver told a news conference in Japan on Tuesday that it was not up to the NBA to regulate what players, employees and team owners said.\n\nBut on Wednesday, an editorial in the official English-language China Daily accused Silver of \u201cbrazenly endorsing Morey\u2019s secessionist-supporting tweet\u201d and giving \u201ca shot to the arms of the rioters of Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nIt said, \u201cIf Silver thinks endorsing the indiscriminate violence the radical Hong Kong protesters are resorting to ... is supporting freedom of expression, then he should think again.\u201d\n\nThe protests were \u201ca bid to liberate the city\u201d and \u201ca secessionist pipe-dream\u201d peddled by demonstrators \u201cto justify their summer hooliganism,\u201d it added.\n\nThe protests were sparked by opposition to a law allowing extradition to mainland China, but have since evolved into broader calls for democracy. None of the protesters\u2019 five demands is secession or independence.\n\nThe state-owned Global Times tabloid accused Silver of caving in to political pressure, saying the NBA was treating the Chinese market with arrogant disregard.\n\n\u201cTweeting something offensive to the Chinese people before a series of NBA promotional activities in China only shows a lack of intellect, respect, and responsibility,\u201d it said.\n\nIn a separate report, the newspaper also said that some Chinese netizens had made \u201cdisrespectful comments\u201d about the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon in Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201c(It) should remind Western media that for Chinese people, the Hong Kong riots are just like the 9/11, which is horrible and can\u2019t be justified,\u201d the Global Times said.\n\nNo one has been killed in several months of protests in Hong Kong, although scores - mostly protesters and journalists - have been hurt. The Sept. 11, 2001, attacks killed 2,996 people and led to the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan.\n\nThe NBA had planned to stage media events in Shanghai this week ahead of a preseason exhibition game between the Brooklyn Nets and the Los Angeles Lakers on Thursday.\n\nOrganisers cancelled an event at a Shanghai school on Tuesday afternoon as well as an open training session with the Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday, though a \u201cfans\u2019 night\u201d is still set to proceed as scheduled, despite a boycott by Chinese celebrities.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Dec 22, 2018; Houston, TX, USA; Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey looks on before a game between the Rockets and the San Antonio Spurs at Toyota Center.
