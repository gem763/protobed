UK equities have been widely shunned by investors since the\n\ncountry vote to leave the trading bloc in 2016.\n\nAs recently as three weeks ago, the Swiss bank said it was\n\nneutral on UK equities because it needed more visibility over\n\nBrexit. That's now changed due to the reduced likelihood of a\n\nno-deal Brexit.\n\n\"Given the most recent developments (...), we believe that\n\ninvestors should now be overweight of the UK, but more\n\nimportantly in USD terms and still selectively,\" its analysts\n\nsaid.\n\nThe note came as sterling jumped to a seven-week high\n\nagainst the dollar as investors cut their sterling short\n\npositions on the receding risks of Britain leaving the European\n\nUnion without a negotiated arrangement. GBP/ The Swiss bank now expects the UK blue-chip index FTSE 100\n\nto touch 7,600 points by mid-2020, a 3.5% gain from\n\ncurrent levels.\n\n\"We would buy UK international earners in dollar terms that\n\nare cheap versus their peer group,\" Credit Suisse analysts said.\n\nIn dollar terms, the FTSE 100 is the only major index to\n\nhave fallen since Brexit, while rest of the world has seen\n\ndouble-digit percentage gains.\n\nCredit Suisse said Johnson Matthey , Elementis\n\n, Rentokil , Relx and British American\n\nTobacco were some of the attractive names with\n\ninternational exposure.\n\nUK stocks undervalued https://tmsnrt.rs/2ZZhWlo\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n\n\n\nUPDATE 1-Brexit: Credit Suisse bullish on UK equities as no-deal chances fade", "description": "UPDATE 1-Brexit: Credit Suisse bullish on UK equities as no-deal chances fade", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_3_800x533_L_1412601605.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
