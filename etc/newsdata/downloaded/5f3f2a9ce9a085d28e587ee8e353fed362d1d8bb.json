Andrew Cuomo (D) signed a bill into law on Monday establishing September 11th Remembrance Day at all public schools in the state in order to \u201censure we never forget \u2015 not just the pain of that moment but of the courage, sacrifice and outpouring of love that defined our response,\u201d the governor said.\n\nThe legislation requires schools to take a \u201cbrief moment of silence\u201d at the beginning of the school day on Sept. 11 every year. The bill was introduced into the New York Senate by state Sen. Joseph P. Addabbo (D) this year as another generation of students born after 2001 enters the school system.\n\n9/11 was one of the single darkest periods in our nation's history, and we owe it to those we lost to keep their memory alive.\n\n\n\nToday I signed legislation establishing an annual day of remembrance and a moment of silence in public schools to ensure we never forget. \u2014 Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) September 9, 2019\n\n\u201cI am hopeful that this new law will mean that the significance of the tragic events of September 11th, whether it be the loss of loved ones or the largest rescue operation our nation ever witnessed, will be forever acknowledged by school students too young to have witnessed this life-changing day,\u201d Addabbo said in a statement.\n\nOn the day of the attacks, nearly 3,000 people in the U.S. were killed when terrorists hijacked four commercial airplanes. Two of the jets crashed into the Twin Towers in New York, one was flown into the Pentagon and one crashed in an open field in Somerset County, Pennsylvania.\n\nAn estimated 343 Fire Department of New York firefighters and 71 police officers died while responding to the attack on the World Trade Center. According to CNN, 200 firefighters died in the years afterward from illnesses linked to their search and recovery efforts at Ground Zero.\n\n\u201c9/11 was one of the single darkest periods in this state\u2019s and this nation\u2019s history, and we owe it to those we lost and to the countless heroes who ran toward danger that day and the days that followed to do everything we can to keep their memory alive,\u201d Cuomo said in a statement.", "description": "Gov.
