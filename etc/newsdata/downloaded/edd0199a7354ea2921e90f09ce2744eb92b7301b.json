There are no criminal charges pending, so police are not releasing the name of the driver.\n\nThey did, however, say they expect that distracted driving played a role in the crash.\n\nBuilding and emergency officials check out a house in Alban, Ont., that was damaged when a commercial truck landed on it during a highway accident. (Erik White/CBC)\n\nConst. Michelle Coulombe told CBC News the sight of the Penske truck atop a house was a first.\n\n\"We've seen people drive into commercial buildings or homes,\" Coulombe said. \"But a big truck like that to land on the roof of a house. No. Never.\"\n\nThe owner of the house told CBC News he was standing in his driveway when the truck launched into the air.\n\nHe said he hasn't had a chance to check the entire house, but the only interior damage he could see was a few cracks in the drywall.\n\nThe owner, who's lived in the house for nine years, said he is staying in his garage until the electricity and oil furnace in the house can be turned back on.\n\nThe highway was closed for approximately 10 hours and reopened around 3 a.m. ET.\n\nThe investigation is continuing.", "description": "A\u00a024-year-old man from Toronto has been charged with careless driving after a truck struck a hydro pole along Highway 64 in northern Ontario on Monday night and came to rest against the side of\u00a0a house.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5277417.1568124703!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/truck-on-house.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
