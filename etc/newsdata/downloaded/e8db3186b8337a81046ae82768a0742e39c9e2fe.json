I was just looking out of the window.\n\n\"He said sorry a second time, and then tapped my arm.\n\n\"I turned around to face him and he grabbed my face and kissed me full on the lips, and I was taken aback because it was just completely out of the blue. I just completely froze.\"\n\nMr Gascoigne's barrister, Michelle Heeley QC, asked the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, whether a fellow passenger had said, following the kiss: \"You've got a responsibility to other women on this train to do something [about the incident].\"\n\nThe woman said: \"I had already made up my mind to report it to the travel police, because it was unwanted behaviour, there was no instigation on my part of wanting any attention from him.\"\n\nConcluding her evidence, she added any attempt by Mr Gascoigne to apologise was for only appearance, telling the court: \"He was just saying sorry for the sake of it, not because it was actually meant.\"\n\nA female passenger who was on the train told the jury that she saw Mr Gascoigne kiss the woman, saying that the alleged victim was \"very shaken\".\n\nShe told Teesside Crown Court that, moments after the incident, she had heard the former footballer say: \"I was just trying to give her some confidence.\"\n\nThe witness said that earlier on in the journey she had seen Mr Gascoigne drinking something from a milk carton, saying: \"It was not the colour of milk.\"\n\nThe trial, which is due to last five days, continues.\n\nFollow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.
