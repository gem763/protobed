But in recent days or weeks, the form for an \u201curgent concern\u201d complaint was changed to allow for hearsay.\n\nVirtually every sentence in the anti-Trump nine-page complaint to Congress is from second-hand sources, such as supposed White House officials and news media reports.\n\n\u201cCuriously, the urgent disclosure form that now appears on the Office of the Director of National Intelligence website has recently changed and no longer contains this explicit first-hand information requirement,\u201d said Mr. McCarthy of California in the letter to intelligence IG Michael K. Atkinson.\n\n\u201cThe timing of the removal of the first-hand information requirement raises questions about potential connections to this whistleblower\u2019 s complaint.\u201d\n\nThe letter was also signed by Rep. Devin Nunes of California, top Republican on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence; and Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, who serves on the House Oversight and Reform Committee.\n\n\u201cThis timing, along with numerous apparent leaks of classified information about the contents of this complaint, also raise questions about potential criminality in the handling of these matters,\u201d the letter said.\n\nMark Zaid, who is on the whistleblower\u2019s defense team, tweeted that the intelligence community has never strictly forbid secondhand information.\n\n\u201cThere has never been any requirement that whistleblowers were required to possess first-hand knowledge to file complaint. No law anywhere states that,\u201d Mr. Zaid said.\n\nLater on Monday, Mr. Atkinson released a statement seeking to clarify whistleblower requirements.\n\nThe statement said that the no-hearsay rule existed up until May 2018. But the regulation did not in practice mean a complaint could not contain second-hand information because federal law does not ban it.\n\nIn June, the IG\u2019s Center for Protected Disclosures developed three new forms, which includes the current one used by the Trump antagonist.\n\n\u201cConsistent with the law, the new forms do not require whistleblowers to possess first-hand information in order to file a complaint or information with respect to an urgent concern,\u201d the IG statement said.\n\nThe statement added, \u201cIn the process of reviewing and clarifying those forms, and in response to recent press inquiries regarding the instant whistleblower complaint, the ICIG understood that certain language in those forms and, more specifically, the informational materials accompanying the forms, could be read \u2013 incorrectly \u2013 as suggesting that whistleblowers must possess first-hand information in order to file an urgent concern complaint with the congressional intelligence committees.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower\u2019s major charge is that Mr. Trump, during a July phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, pressured the Ukrainian to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, a Democrat presidential candidate. A released transcript shows Mr. Trump asked him to speak with Attorney General William Barr, though such a contact apparently never took place.\n\nDemocrats are now pursuing impeachment based on the complaint, saying Mr. Trump was seeking foreign interference in the 2020 election. Trump backers say the transcript shows no pressure, just a request.\n\nWhy and exactly when the whistleblower form was changed is still unclear. The IG press office has not responded to queries from The Washington Times.\n\nBut until recently intelligence community IG rules stated, in all capital letters, that, \u201cFIRST-HAND INFORMATION REQUIRED.\u201d\n\nThe rule states, \u201cIn order to find an urgent concern \u2018credible,\u2019 the ICIG must be in possession of reliable, first-hand information. The ICIG cannot transmit information via the ICWPA [whistleblower law] based on an employee\u2019s second-hand knowledge of wrongdoing.\u201d\n\nThat rule would appear to have stopped the Trump whistleblower.\n\nBut the current form, \u201cDisclosure of Urgent Concern Form, allows for both \u201cdirect and personal knowledge\u201d or \u201cI heard about it from others.\u201d\n\nThe three Republicans say this document was created on Sept. 24, a month after the Trump whistleblower, a CIA analyst, sent his complaint to Congress.\n\n\u201cWhen this revised form was published, and whether the whistleblower received a copy of this form when making the disclosure on August 12, 2019, are both unknown to the House Intelligence Committee,\u201d the Republican letter says.\n\nThe letter demands that Mr. Atkinson retain and provide all records connected to the form and how it was changed.\n\nMr. Atkinson butted heads with the Justice Department when he ruled the complaint was \u201ccredible\u201d \u2014 a legal requirement.\n\nThe Justice Department ruled it was not because the target, Mr. Trump, is not an intelligence community employee, as the rules still require.\n\n\u201cThe ICIG should view this letter as a preservation order for all documents and communications from your office related to the matters discussed herein,\u201d the GOP letter said.\n\nThe Federalist news site first reported on the form\u2019s new hearsay policy.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
