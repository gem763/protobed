Aniston didn\u2019t earn $1 million per episode on \u201cFriends\u201d until the last couple of seasons in 2003 and 2004, and that was a headline-grabbing sum back then. Last year, Witherspoon negotiated a hefty raise to $1 million per episode on HBO\u2019s \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d and was credited with correcting the cable channel\u2019s gender pay gap.\n\nNot that Aniston and Witherspoon were hurting for cash. The two reportedly have net worths well into the hundreds of millions of dollars. And their \u201cMorning Show\u201d contracts amount to even more moolah with producing fees and ownership points, per the THR.\n\nApple\u2019s investment in its behind-the-smiles look at morning TV shows \u2015 in which Aniston plays the veteran host and Witherspoon the newbie \u2015 is pretty staggering. The 20 episodes on order will cost $15 million each for a total of $300 million over two seasons, THR noted.\n\n\u201cThe Morning Show\u201d premieres Nov. 1 on the Apple TV Plus streaming service.", "description": "The stars' previous high salaries on other TV shows pale in comparison.", "authors": ["General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da735a2210000090e34a213.png?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
