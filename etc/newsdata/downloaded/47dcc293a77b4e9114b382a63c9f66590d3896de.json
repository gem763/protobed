The board asked each of the NCAA's three divisions to create the necessary new rules beginning immediately and have them in place no later than January 2021.\n\nTuesday's vote does not allow schools to pay players.\n\nNCAA football players could soon be permitted to earn money off use of their name and image\n\nA proponent of paying players, and a father of one of the country's top basketball recruits, LeBron James celebrated the NCAA's decision: 'Its (sic) a beautiful day for all college athletes'\n\nMarch Madness has always offered significant exposure for its athletes, but for decades, men's and women's college basketball players were prevented from capitalizing upon that notoriety\n\nThe news was a cause for celebration in the James household, where father LeBron has been a big proponent of paying players and son LeBron Jr. is already among one of the top basketball recruits in the country.\n\n'Its (sic) a beautiful day for all college athletes going forward from this day on!' James tweeted.\n\nMany other professional athletes, such as Golden State Warriors star Draymond Green, and politicians, such as presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, have come out in support of paying college athletes.\n\nA group of NCAA administrators has been exploring since May the ways in which athletes could be allowed to receive compensation for the use of their names, images and likenesses. The task force, led by Ohio State athletic director Gene Smith and Big East Commissioner Val Ackerman, presented a status report Tuesday to the Board of Governors, composed of university presidents.\n\n'The board is emphasizing that change must be consistent with the values of college sports and higher education and not turn student-athletes into employees of institutions,' said board chair Michael V. Drake.\n\nThe NCAA's shift came a month after California passed a law that would make it illegal for NCAA schools in the state to prohibit college athletes from making money on such activities as endorsements, autograph signings and social media advertising.\n\nIn fact, California governor Gavin Newsom signed the bill on James's HBO show.\n\n'I'm so proud of the team at @uninterrupted bringing focus on this and to everyone who has been fighting this fight,' James wrote on Twitter. 'Not a victory but a start!''\n\nSeveral high-profile names have come out in support of paying college athletes, such as Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James (left) and presidential candidate Bernie Sanders (right)\n\nFor years, the NCAA, its schools, and its media partners were permitted to use player likeness in advertisements and promotions without compensating those athletes\n\nIn June, NCAA President Mark Emmert threatened that if the proposed California bill became law, schools in the state could be prohibited from participating in NCAA championships - a punishment that would cost the state's colleges and universities millions of dollars in media revenue. Now, after the California bill was signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom, the NCAA is overturning its policy prohibiting players from profiting off their name and image\n\nCalifornia's law goes into effect in 2023. More than a dozen states have followed with similar legislation; some are hoping to have laws in effect as soon as 2020.\n\nThe NCAA has said state laws that contradict the national governing body's rules could lead to athletes being declared ineligible or schools not being allowed to compete.\n\nThere is also a federal bill in the works, sponsored by North Carolina Republican U.S. Rep. Mark Walker, that could prevent the NCAA and its member schools from restricting its athletes from selling the rights to their names, images and likenesses to third-party buyers on the open market.\n\nThe NCAA says it represents some 450,000 athletes nationwide.\n\nBaylor's women's basketball team played in front of nearly 4 million viewers in last year's NCAA title game. In the near future, players like Juicy Landrum (left) could be allowed to use that exposure to sell their image rights\n\nThe move was met with some criticism.\n\nESPN analyst Jay Bilas, an attorney who played basketball at Duke, remains critical of the NCAA, saying the long-overdue decision still unfairly restricts college players.\n\n'From the NCAA Board of Governors (what it's REALLY saying): We shall strive to allow athletes the right to name image and likeness opportunities, but only in a manner that does not allow them to monetize their name image and likeness opportunities,' Bilas tweeted.\n\nBilas put a finer point on his objections in a following tweet: 'NCAA Prez: 'The board's action today creates a path to enhance opportunities for student-athletes while ensuring they compete against students and not professionals.' What nonsense. 'Student' means enrolled, nothing more. Status as a student has nothing to do with money. Zero.'\n\nRamogi Huma, founder of the National College Players Association, told ESPN that he feels the decision falls short of any real concession on the part of the NCAA.\n\n'The NCAA has failed on this issue once again,' Huma said. 'This is another attempt at stalling on this issue.'\n\nU.S. Senator Richard Burr (North Carolina), on the other hand, thinks players who do profit off their name and likeness should pay taxes on their scholarships.\n\n'If college athletes are going to make money off their likenesses while in school, their scholarships should be treated like income,' he wrote on Twitter. 'I'll be introducing legislation that subjects scholarships given to athletes who choose to 'cash in' to income taxes.'\n\nJay Bilas, an ESPN college basketball analyst, attorney, and former player at Duke remains cynical of the NCAA's methods and motives\n\nU.S. Senator Richard Burr (North Carolina), on the other hand, thinks players who do profit off their name and likeness should pay taxes on their scholarships", "description": "The NCAA board voted unanimously on Tuesday to allow athletes to profit from their names, images and likenesses, but much work still needs to be done to determine how that will work within NCAA rules.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/20/20345224-0-image-a-22_1572381883463.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
