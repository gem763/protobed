The change in regulatory language, which carries with it alarming implications, comes after Trump\u2019s repeated rhetoric that the United States needs \u201ccrystal-clean water.\u201d\n\nThe redefinition of Waters of the United States (WOTUS) will dampen the efficacy of the Clean Water Act, a federal law implemented by President Richard Nixon in 1972 that aims to control pollution in U.S. waterways. In 2015, President Obama tried to protect smaller waterways like streams and wetlands under the Clean Water Rule, and was met with fierce resistance from Republicans and farmers who complained that the rule was too far-reaching.\n\nThe EPA\u2019s announcement of the new definition included language pointed directly at the former president. \u201cUnlike the Obama administration\u2019s 2015 definition... today\u2019s proposal contains a straightforward definition that would result in significant cost savings, protect the nation\u2019s navigable waters, help sustain economic growth, and reduce barriers to business development,\u201d reads a statement released by the federal agency.\n\nEPA Office of Water chief Dave Ross told reporters Monday evening that the the agency did not have access to\u2014and therefore did not consult\u2014data that shows how many U.S. waterways would be affected by the new definition.\n\n\u201cWe have not done... a detailed mapping of all the wetlands in the country,\u201d Ross said. \u201cNo one has that data.\u201d\n\nHowever, according to internal EPA slides obtained by E&E News through a federal records request, the agency did have access to that data as long as a year ago. The uncovered slides were prepared for former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt and former Army Corps Deputy Assistant Secretary Douglas Lamont by EPA and Army Corps of Engineers staff in 2017.\n\nThe slides include data from the U.S. Geological Survey\u2019s National Hydrography Dataset (NHD)\u2014which maps streams and gauges how often they flow\u2014and show that 51 percent of wetlands may become unregulated under the new WOTUS definition.\n\nIt appears the slides were presented when the Trump administration was deciding whether to include ephemeral streams\u2014streams that only exist after rain or snowmelt\u2014in a new WOTUS definition. Late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in a 2006 court ruling that only waterways with a \u201crelatively permanent flow\u201d should be covered by the Clean Water Act, an opinion the Trump administration appears to be following up on now, as ephemeral streams will be no longer protected under the scaled-back regulation.\n\nEnvironmental advocates argue that eliminating ephemeral streams from federal protection could create more downstream pollution, as streams that have been refilled in the rainy season may transfer agricultural pollution to larger bodies of water.\n\n\u201cSaying you want clean water and excluding ephemeral streams is like saying you want universal health care, but you won\u2019t cover anyone not named Ken,\u201d said Ken Kopocis, who led the Obama EPA\u2019s Office of Water. \u201cIt\u2019s a start, but it won\u2019t get you what you want.\u201d\n\nThe reclassification of ephemeral streams could be especially important in western states, like California, where most streams are seasonal by nature and agriculture is the top industry.", "description": "The EPA proposal\u2014which could decrease protections for millions of acres of wetlands\u2014comes after Trump\u2019s repeated insistence that the United States needs \u201ccrystal clean water.\u201d", "authors": ["Audrey Mcnamara"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1544567399/181211-McNamara-trump-pollution-tease_zsrudg", "published_at": "2018-12-11"}
