Rugby World Cup semi-final: England vs New Zealand predicted team 1/24 England vs New Zealand Here's the team Eddie Jones should select for the Rugby World Cup semi-final against New Zealand. AFP via Getty Images 2/24 1. Mako Vunipola After coming through his first start in five months last weekend with flying colours, Eddie Jones knows he has one of his genuine world class players to call upon from the start. Vunipola completely changes the way that England\u2019s pack are able to impose themselves on the opposition, which enables the likes of Billy Vunipola and Manu Tuilagi to reap the benefits. AFP via Getty Images 3/24 2. Jamie George Has a point to prove after the criticism he received following his struggles against the All Blacks last November. England\u2019s lineout has been lauded by this correspondent as currently the best in the world \u2013 now it\u2019s time for them to prove it. Getty Images 4/24 3. Kyle Sinckler His excellent display against Australia felt like a breakout performance that will have filled him with confidence ahead of what will be the biggest game of his career since the Lions tour. Sinckler is proving one of the gems in the pack that is proving his class by the minute. Getty Images, 5/24 4. Maro Itoje If New Zealand could have one player from the England side in their squad, it would be Itoje. The dynamic forward has been one of England\u2019s most consistent performers in Japan and has led their turnover charts, proving what a thorn he is in the backside of opponents. AFP via Getty Images 6/24 5. George Kruis He has swapped places with Courtney Lawes throughout the tournament and I\u2019d expect no different for this occasion, given the emphasis that Eddie Jones has put on the lineout. Kruis also brings extra bulk in the carrying department. Getty Images 7/24 6. Tom Curry Man of the match against Australia at the age of 21, Curry now has a target on his back that the Kiwis will have spotted. His place could have been at risk in order to play Courtney Lawes to strengthen the lineout, but breaking up the \u2018Undercurry\u2019 duo would be a travesty. Getty Images, 8/24 7. Sam Underhill The second part of England\u2019s dynamic flank duo, Underhill has proven worth his weight in gold in Japan, having formed a back-row of the likes that England have never seen before. Getty Images, 9/24 8. Billy Vunipola With fitness concerns and burnout fears done and dusted, Vunipola is the easy choice at No 8. AFP via Getty Images 10/24 9. Ben Youngs One of the survivors of the victorious 2012 team, Youngs has had a good World Cup up until now, but he will need to be at his very best to outshine opposite number Aaron Smith. AFP via Getty Images 11/24 10. George Ford A surprise choice, but one that makes sense. New Zealand lack a big ball-carrier in the centre unless they select Sonny Bill Williams, which given how Steve Hansen has gone this tour looks unlikely. In which case, England need the creativity that Ford and Farrell bring together. AFP via Getty Images 12/24 11. Jonny May There\u2019s a big concern over his hamstring, but if\u2019s he\u2019s close to fully fit May is worth the gamble. He proved his lethal finishing ability against the Wallabies, and the All Blacks know what he can do given his famous try at Twickenham in 2014. Getty 13/24 12. Owen Farrell The move to inside centre would be a surprise, but Farrell appeared to regain his confidence last weekend as displayed by his 100 per cent kicking ability. His appearance in this week\u2019s press conference said as much, and it\u2019s worth remembering that he and Ford know what to do together. Getty Images, 14/24 13. Manu Tuilagi Can he rekindle the 2012 Manu Tuilagi that blew New Zealand away? His recent form suggests he could well do so, and New Zealand know they need to hatch a plan to contain him when he\u2019s given the space out wide. Getty Images, 15/24 14. Anthony Watson The wing utilised his footwork supremely well against Australia, and having been faced with the powerhouse that was Marika Koroibete last week, George Bridge should be a welcome release. Getty Images, 16/24 15. Elliot Daly Jones\u2019s go-to man at full-back, Daly needs something closer to what he produced against Argentina than the Australia game. AFP via Getty Images 17/24 16.

Jack Nowell Getty Images\n\nWhat to do\n\nAim high\n\nTo get your bearings, head up to the Sky Garden on the 69th floor of the Landmark Tower for unbeatable 360 degree views over the city. You\u2019ll also be able to spot Tokyo beyond and, on a clear day, Mount Fuji \u2013 Japan\u2019s highest peak. Try and go in the evening when the skyscrapers and quays dazzle with vibrant lights. Sky Garden opens Monday-Sunday 10am-9pm (10pm on Saturdays); entry 1,000 yen (\u00a37).\n\nOodles of noodles\n\nJapan loves its ramen, so don\u2019t be surprised that Yokohama is home to not one but two museums dedicated to the iconic noodles. The Cup Noodles Museum pays homage to the instant variety through a series of interactive exhibits. Don\u2019t miss the chance to make your own ramen in a pre-bookable workshop (extra fee). Open every day 10am-6pm; entry 500 yen.\n\nAt the Shin-Yokohama Ramen Museum you\u2019ll learn the history then eat your way through regional variations in nine traditional-style restaurants. The eating area, set in 1958 when Japan first launched instant noodles, has handy English menus. Generally open 11am-10pm; entry 310 yen (\u00a32).\n\nA taste of China\n\nYokohama is home to Japan\u2019s biggest Chinatown, a legacy of when Chinese merchants settled here after it opened up as an international port. The vibrant, bustling district is a blaze of gold, red, pink, blue and green; make a grand entry through one of the four imposing gates, then join locals in grabbing a steamed bun, pancakes or dumplings from a street-side stall. For a heartier meal, many restaurants do all-you-can-eat deals for 1500-2000 yen (\u00a311-14). Visit at night when dozens of lanterns sparkle into life \u2013 and don\u2019t miss one of the numerous cake shops. Who knew the Chinese ate so much cake?\n\nPark up\n\nFor an introduction to Japan\u2019s traditional architecture and landscaping head to the sense-enriching Senkeien Garden. Created by a wealthy silk merchant more than 100 years ago, it\u2019s home to 17 history-rich buildings transported and reconstructed from across the country. Exhibits include an 18th Century farmhouse held together only by straw and a 500-year-old three-storey pagoda. They\u2019re surrounded by elegant ponds, ornate flower beds and fruit trees guaranteed to soothe any city stresses.\n\nNow you see it\n\nYokohama Trick Art Cruise isn\u2019t a sailing trip but a series of artworks containing optical illusions that immerse you in an imaginary boat journey. The idea is that you leap into the picture, take a snap of yourself then post it on the ever-important social media. You could find yourself popping out of the jaws of a shark, falling down a boat or diving with seals. Fun. Quirky. Oh so Japanese. Open every day 11am-8pm; entry 700 yen (\u00a35).\n\nHere for the beer\n\nTake a free tour of the Kirin Beer Factory, one of Japan\u2019s four main breweries. You\u2019ll see how the beer is made and enjoy tastings. English tours available. Open Tuesday to Saturday 10am-4pm.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nThe Hotel New Grand, one of Japan\u2019s oldest western-style hotels, has an elegant feel with tall stone arches, beautiful floral displays and marble staircases greeting you in the lobby. Opened in 1927, its first grand chef was legendary Swiss foodie Sally Weil who set about introducing Japan to European dishes like risotto and spaghetti napolitana, a tomato-based pasta. Even if you\u2019re not staying, you can still pop in and try them today in the first floor cafe \u2013 one of six restaurants. Rooms have fabulous views of Yamashita Park, Osanbashi Pier or Yokohama Bay Bridge. From \u00a3124, room only.\n\nShaped like a huge yacht\u2019s sail, the striking 31-floor InterContinental Yokohama Grand is handy for Minato Mirai and Chinatown. The rooms are classic rather than cool but you won\u2019t be spending too much time looking at walls here as it\u2019s all about the views. Rooms look out over either the bay or the city. From \u00a3119, room only.\n\nFor a budget stay in an authentic Japanese setting try the Guest House Futareno, a hostel set in a 50-year-old wooden house in an area buzzing with bars and restaurants. Choose from bunk beds in single-sex dorms or private rooms, all with shared bathrooms. The flooring is traditional tatami; guests change out of their shoes into the slippers provided. Beware of the 1am curfew when the doors are locked. No credit cards accepted. Dormitory beds from \u00a321pp, twin rooms from \u00a359.\n\nWhere to eat\n\nBeef lovers should head to Araiya, famed for its teppanyaki and shabu-shabu-style hot pots like its signature dish, gyu-nikomi (stewed beef basted in a soy sauce broth and served over soba or udon noodles).\n\nIf you\u2019re hopeless at deciding what to eat, try Yoshimuraya. It invented Yokohama\u2019s unique iekei ramen and serves nothing but. Only 15 people are let in at one time but for speed you order at a vending machine, hand in the token you\u2019re given to the chef then tuck in around the counter with everyone else until the next shift is let in. The ramen come in a distinctive thick pork and soy broth topped with dried seaweed, spinach and an egg, although slight variations can be requested.\n\nFollow the locals to tiny Shinku (no website), tucked away in a side street in the Noge district, for mouth-watering yakitori. There\u2019s no English menu but you can have fun pointing out the cuts of meat you fancy so the chef can grill it to gooey perfection. Be prepared to queue as there\u2019s only room for around a dozen diners at a time, all seated around a narrow bar. It\u2019s worth the wait.\n\nWhere to drink\n\nWander around Noge, a lively district famous for its drinking scene, and dip in and out of its traditional sake shops and cool modern bars. Many are small but some have English menus.\n\nYokohama\u2019s artisan beer scene has led to it being nicknamed Japan\u2019s craft beer capital. The lively Taproom Bashamichi serves craft ales over three floors, including on a roof terrace.\n\nTaste your way through a few more at Spring Valley Brewery next to the Kirin factory. Try the beer flight \u2013 six different 100ml beers paired with a snack.\n\nOr spend an evening at the award-winning Yokohama Brewery. Don\u2019t leave without sampling the most popular of their Japanese beers; the fruity Wiezen, inspired by Germany\u2019s wheat beers, and the golden American-style pale ale.\n\nWhere to shop\n\nWhy have one shopping mall when you can have several all in one place \u2013 plus a park, fun fair, hotels, restaurants, bars, museums, galleries and theatres? The huge waterside development of Minato Mirai 21, built on a former shipyard, dominates Yokohama\u2019s skyline with its eye-catching skyscrapers and uber-cool modern architecture; its name \u2013 voted for by the public \u2013 means \"port of the future in the 21st century\". Browse several distinct malls with their own character, like World Porters, whose six floors are each themed \u2013 from fashion to homeware to Broadway (think amusements and cinemas).\n\nThe on-site Cosmoworld amusement park houses roller coasters and rides plus a giant Ferris wheel which displays what was once the world\u2019s biggest clock. If it all gets too much, recover with a stroll around the serene Yamashita Park.\n\nArchitectural highlight\n\nA great place from which to appreciate Yokohama\u2019s striking waterfront is Osanbashi Pier, once the first place that welcomed foreign traders and now the main cruise ship berth. The wooden-slatted pier itself is designed to resemble the deck of a ship while on top of the terminal building lies a public park. Add to that the supreme views of the bay and Yokohama\u2019s Three Towers \u2013 modern government buildings nicknamed King, Queen and Jack.\n\nNuts and Bolts\n\nWhat currency do I need?\n\nJapanese yen.\n\nWhat language do they speak?\n\nJapanese. English is generally understood in tourist areas.\n\nShould I tip?\n\nNo! The culture of tipping is alien to the Japanese, who believe good customer service should be a given. Tipping can cause offence.\n\nWhat\u2019s the time difference?\n\nNine hours ahead of GMT.\n\nWhat\u2019s the average flight time from the UK?\n\nBritish Airways flies direct to Tokyo\u2019s two airports Haneda (also called Tokyo international Airport) and Narita in around 12 hours from \u00a3640 return. Trains to Yokohama from Haneda Airport take about 20 minutes, from Narita about 90 minutes.\n\nPublic transport\n\nYokohama\u2019s trains and buses have extensive services and run like clockwork. Click here for maps.\n\nBest view\n\nThe perfect way to appreciate Yokohama\u2019s amazing waterfront is from a boat. Several ferry companies operate hop-on-hop-off services.\n\nInsider tip\n\nJapan National Tourist Organisation (JNTO) runs a 24-hour hotline in English 365 days a year for visitors needing tourist information or help in an emergency.
