With people shelling out upwards of $72 billion on their four-legged friends in 2018, up 4% from the previous year, APPA predicts that in this year alone we\u2019ll spend more than $16 billion on pet supplies such as beds, collars, leashes, toys and other gear.\n\nWhen it comes to leashes, the market is saturated with countless options with features like reflectiveness, adjustability, harnesses, multi-dog capabilities and even designer branding. With so many choices, figuring out which leash is the most suitable for you and your canine can be bewildering.

Harnesses preserve necks and pets have lots of neck changes and pain as they age,\u201d says Waldman.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nBest leather leash: Soft Touch Collars - Leather Braided Dog Leash, about $20\n\n\u201cAvoid cotton or woven materials and go for something with longevity like leather,\u201d says Jeff Franklin, owner and operator of dog training organization Cobra Canine.

They have a myriad of colors and different options depending on whether you have a one-, two- or three-dog household,\u201d says Cobra Canine\u2019s Franklin. For people who enjoy running or hiking with their dogs, these leads made with the same durable stitching used on harnesses and firefighters\u2019 gear can be worn around the waist, they\u2019re light and allow for hands-free exercise.
