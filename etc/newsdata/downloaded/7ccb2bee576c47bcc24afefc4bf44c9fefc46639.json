Having those companies vouch for us and speak to their experience made the sales process immeasurably easier,\" he said.\n\nThe business now has 12 staff employed across Sydney, San Francisco, New York and London and is growing revenue by 25 per cent month-on-month and already turning over more than $1 million a year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite only launching a month ago, the Citi internship, which helps prepare students for a career in investment banking, has already had 4000 enrolments.\n\nThe company intends to measure how many of the students taking part in its programs go on to get jobs at the firms.\n\n\"We already have an example of Deloitte hiring someone from our program who was a science PhD student who was pregnant and stressed about entering the workforce. Deloitte had wanted to hire post-grad students from a STEM background in Canberra and they found her and hired her,\" Mr Brunskill said.\n\n\"Another person who got hired by Grant Thornton did its audit program and reported a number that didn't make sense to her and they were so impressed by her attention to detail they asked her in for an interview.\"\n\nOther investors in InsideSherpa's raise included FundersClub and Arizona State University.\n\nIn the next three years it has a goal of having 1 million students complete its internships.\n\nMr Baxter said the fund first connected with the co-founders when they participated in Y Combinator earlier this year and had followed the company's progression since then.\n\n\"I saw companies around the world struggling to hire the best talent. Traditional recruitment methods weren\u2019t cutting it with the \u2018digital first\u2019 generation,\" he said.\n\n\"InsideSherpa\u2019s virtual internships were a great way for companies to take a data-driven approach to recruitment. It helped them engage with digitally-centric graduates and position themselves as innovative employers of choice.\"", "description": "InsideSherpa co-founders Tom Brunskill and Pasha Rayan knew how challenging it could be for many students to have the chance to do work experience.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3026%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_170%2C$y_300/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/bfa28b85459d2d559d77683e693058c622306d0b", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
