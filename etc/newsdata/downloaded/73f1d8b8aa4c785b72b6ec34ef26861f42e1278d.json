When comparing the answers of young people 21 years ago to young people today, they found that back then patriotism, religion, hard work and family were among the top values \u2014 today, the only remaining constant is hard work.\n\nAccording to the survey, 61 percent cited patriotism as very important to them today, which is down 9 percentage points from 1998.\n\nFifty percent cited religion, down 12 points, and some 43 percent placed a high value on having children, down 16 points from 1998.\n\nFox News spoke with students from prestigious New York City universities about what they valued the most in their lives. They seemed to place their values in areas that are more self-minded such as happiness, passion, empathy and self-progression.\n\n\u201cI value my friends a lot, I value my family too; but not the family I am going to have in the future, but the family I have now,\" said Sara, 22.\n\nReligion is a topic that seems to be at the bottom of the list of what millennials value. When asked whether or not religion was very important, a large number of young people said they \u201cbroke free\u201d from their former religions. Stella, 18, a student of NYU said her parents raised her with two religions, her mother being Protestant and her father being Jewish.\n\n\u201cThey really gave me the opportunity to pick where I wanted to go and I picked neither,\" she said.\n\nMillennials acknowledge the shift in religious values from the former generation to now \u2014 some cite the age of social media and the exchanging of information as the reason for the disconnect.\n\nThe idea of marriage and having children is also a value that is scarce among millennials. With the national divorce rate being 2.9 per 1,000 population, according to official records, millennials feel that what was once a guaranteed route of life may not work for them.\n\nFemi, a student at Columbia University, feels like marriage has become \u201carchaic.\u201d \u201cA lot of us, we were raised by our parents and we saw those marriages kind of deteriorate, and even if they did stay together the love might have not been there. I feel as we progress these institutions whether it be marriage or religion, they start to seem archaic.\u201d\n\nPatriotism among millennials seems to be at a low, according to the students we spoke with. Millennials we spoke to were more critical of the Trump administration and the current policies, saying they felt that \u201cAmerica is losing a sense of national identity.\u201d\n\nMillennials are torn between loving their country and condoning the treatment of some Americans in this country. \u201cI think it\u2019s really difficult to be proud to be an American when so many Americans are getting deported and getting attacked for being who they are when they have no choice in the matter,\u201d Stella said.\n\nThere are millennials who remain hopeful and still value the importance of patriotism. Gabe, an 18-year-old student at New York University, said he is \u201cdefinitely still proud\" of being American because \"this country has always been one to celebrate progress and openness\" and that \"if there is any country that can combat hatred\" it is America.\n\nThe one constant value that has never seemed to waiver is the belief in hard work and self-reliance. Millennials grasp this notion full-on and are making no excuses for accomplishing the goals and objectives of their generation.", "description": "Americans used to be taught to value hard work, family, religion\u00a0and patriotism, but in the new age of social media and enlightened awareness, young Americans are placing their values in other areas of life.", "authors": ["Christopher Howard"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/08/28/694940094001_6078381236001_6078350441001-vs.jpg"}
