He was closing in on his 30th birthday and the nature of his position - he is a ball-winning midfielder - is not one which often excites the average football fan.\n\nHe has proved, however, that none of that matters if you're excellent at what you do - and you fit the manager's system.\n\nThe game against Real Madrid was his first in the Champions League in almost seven years, but he immediately looked at home on European football's biggest stage.\n\nIf his signing sparked little interest outside of those in Paris and on the blue half of Merseyside, this performance truly announced his arrival as a PSG player.\n\nHis numbers that evening were impressive - two more chances created on top of the assist, 91 touches of the ball, 74 passes with 93.2 per cent accuracy, four tackles, three interceptions, six recoveries and three successful dribbles out of three.\n\nGueye stretches out his right leg to try and win the ball from Real Madrid midfielder Toni Kroos\n\nThe Senegal midfielder tussles with Karim Benzema during PSG's comfortable 3-0 victory\n\nIDRISSA GUEYE'S PERFECT RECORD AT PSG August 25 - 4-0 vs Toulouse August 30 - 2-0 vs Metz September 14 - 1-0 vs Strasbourg September 18 - 3-0 vs Real Madrid September 22 - 1-0 vs Lyon September 28 - 1-0 vs Bordeaux October 1 - 1-0 vs Galatasaray October 5 - 4-0 vs Angers\n\nAnd he hasn't stopped there, either. In his eight games so far for the Parisians, Gueye has an incredible record of eight victories without conceding a single goal.\n\nClean sheets might not always be a statistic you immediately associate with a midfielder, but Gueye prides himself on relentlessly covering his back four, snuffing out danger and breaking up opposition attacks. It is no coincidence that Tuchel's men are more solid when he's in the team.\n\nIt is also no coincidence that Everton are far more porous without the former Lille man patrolling their midfield alongside Andre Gomes.\n\nMarco Silva's men have conceded 13 goals in just eight games this season - the joint- fifth worst record in the division - and sit inside the relegation zone.\n\nGueye, pictured celebrating a goal for Everton in 2017, was one of the club's best players\n\nThe former Aston Villa man slides in on Aaron Ramsey during a win over Arsenal last season\n\nIt would be a stretch to say that the Toffees would be challenging near the top of the table with Gueye still at Goodison - their troubles run much deeper than central midfield - but it is no exaggeration to suggest they would be noticeably better off.\n\nSilva knew that when he refused to sell Gueye to PSG in January, despite the Ligue 1 giants coming close to the eventual price they paid for him in July.\n\nGueye stayed professional and hit his best form in the final months of the season, not that Tuchel needed to be convinced to go back in for him this summer.\n\nThe former Borussia Dortmund boss has an eye for a player and, according to the New York Times, he called Gueye personally to talk him through how he would fit into his side this season.\n\nTuchel's vision has come to fruition, perhaps even better than he could have expected. Gueye may not be a Galactico, but he's just what PSG needed.", "description": "Idrissa Gueye's \u00a330million move from Everton to PSG attracted little fanfare over the summer, which is understandable when you consider the signings the French champions have made in recent years.", "authors": ["Joe Strange For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/17/19500316-0-image-a-6_1570637211597.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
