Katie Hill (D-CA) on Monday released a video statement about her resignation from Congress. She made the resignation announcement Sunday night after the House Ethics Committee launched an investigation into Hill. She was allegedly having an affair with her Legislative Director, Graham Kelly, and a throuple relationship with a female campaign staffer.\n\nPhotos surfaced online of a naked HIll smoking a bong and spending time with another woman in a hotel room. According to the freshman Congresswoman, her \"abusive ex-husband\" and the \"right-wing media\" are responsible for the attacks on her.\n\n\"I made this decision [to resign] so that my supporters, my family, my staff and our community will no longer be subjected to the pain inflicted by my abusive husband and the brutality of hateful political operatives coordinated campaign carried out by the right-wing media and Republican opponents,\" Hill said in her video. \"Enabling and perpetuating my husband\u2019s abuse by providing him a platform is disgusting and unforgivable, and they will be held accountable.\"\n\nThe entire video focuses on everyone's attacks on her, but she fails to mention she broke House Rule XXIII, clause 18(a), which clearly states a member of Congress cannot engage in a sexual relationship with an employee:\n\n18. (a) A Member, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner may not engage in a sexual relationship with any employee of the House who works under the supervision of the Member, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner, or who is an employee of a committee on which the Member, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner serves. This paragraph does not apply with respect to any relationship between two people who are married to each other.\n\nAnd, to make things even more ironic, Hill supported the very bill that made her actions an ethics violation.\n\nBut here's the real kicker: she wants to inspire other people to launch so-called \"grassroots\" campaigns yet she took big PAC money.\n\nTo my supporters in our district and across our great country, please know that we did something incredible. We proved that an imperfect woman and the 31-year-old daughter of a nurse and a police officer, who never planned to run for office, has a place in the people\u2019s house. We showed the nation that there is hope even in the darkest of moments, that every single person deserves a chance and a voice that voters will believe, and we\u2019ll rise to make that happen. We showed Washington that a grassroots campaign can propel a young woman into Congress without the help of big corporations and special interests that have for so long governed politics; and that this movement will change our broken political system forever. That matters and it will always matter.\n\nA quick search of FEC filings shows Hill took big money from:\n\n\u2022 American Hospital Association PAC\n\n\u2022 American Postal Workers Union Committee on Political Action\n\n\u2022 National Beer Wholesalers Association PAC\n\n\u2022 New Democrat Coalition PAC\n\n\u2022 Writers Guild of America, Inc. PAC\n\n\u2022 Sierra Club Political Committee\n\n\u2022 NARAL Pro-Choice PAC\n\n\u2022 League of Conservation Voters Action Fund\n\n\u2022 Committee for a Democratic Future\n\n\u2022 Laborers' International Union of North America (LUNA) PAC\n\n\u2022 Congressional Black Caucus PAC\n\n\u2022 Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC)\n\n\u2022 MoveOn.org Political Action\n\n\u2022 Human Rights Campaign PAC\n\n\u2022 Brady PAC\n\n\u2022 DNC PAC\n\n\u2022 Emily's List\n\n\u2022 Everytown for Gun Safety Action Fund\n\nThese are just a few of the PACs and big money that supported her during the last election cycle. Sounds real grassroots-y, right?", "description": "Figures..10/28/2019 20:15:44PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Cortney O'Brien", "Julio Rosas", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/301/ae82c1ee-165a-4cc2-80e1-7095c528d311.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
