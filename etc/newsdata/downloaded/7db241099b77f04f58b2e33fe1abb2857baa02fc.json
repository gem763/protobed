She and her partner had big dreams \u2013 they were looking forward to a future together as husband and wife and her little girl was growing up fast.\n\nBut Nomathamsanqa Swartbooi\u2019s dreams were snuffed out in a heartbeat when she learnt she was \u201cmarried\u201d to a man she didn\u2019t know from a bar of soap. Her identity had been stolen \u2013 and so began over a decade of frustration and heartache for the Johannesburg woman.\n\nThami, as everyone calls her, discovered the shocking news when she went to cast her vote in the 2006 municipal elections. To her dismay officials told her that her surname had been changed on the voters\u2019 roll. Thami Swartbooi was now Thami Nofemeli.\n\nFor the next 13 years she became locked in a standoff with home affairs in a desperate effort to reclaim her identity and prove she wasn\u2019t married. And for 13 years the door was slammed in her face. It was only last month she managed to get her identity back when the new minister of home affairs, Aaron Motsoaledi, intervened after her story started making waves in the media.\n\n\u201cHow do you explain the fact that after fighting for 13 years, this matter gets resolved just three days after appearing in the media?\u201d she says angrily.\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden they have answers.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been a long and trying journey for Thami (43). While she\u2019s glad the matter has finally been resolved, she can\u2019t help feeling betrayed by the department whose mission it is to safeguard the identity of citizens.\n\nAfter the shock at the voting station Thami, who lives in Finetown, Joburg South, wasted no time reporting the matter to home affairs. Officials told her she\u2019d supposedly tied the knot in 2005 and that the union was valid.\n\n\u201cThey asked me to give them six months to a year to resolve the problem because the matter was \u2018difficult\u2019.\u201d\n\nMonths passed and still she remained without an identity. Thami hasn\u2019t been able to get her driver\u2019s licence and wasn\u2019t able to vote in any post-2006 elections. She also wasn\u2019t able to marry her partner, John Tshiwo (45).\n\nHe\u2019d paid lobola but because she had no valid ID they couldn\u2019t take matters any further.\n\n\u201cYou just live a meaningless life. It\u2019s like you don\u2019t exist,\u201d she says.\n\nThe crisis deepened when Thami discovered she no longer qualified for credit. The mystery woman who stole her ID, who\u2019s being sought by home affairs and believed to be married to Thami\u2019s false husband, was running up debt in her name, opening accounts and getting loans.\n\n\u201cI was blacklisted,\u201d Thami says. \u201cEvery time I wanted to open a clothing account I was refused.\n\n\u201cAt Foschini I was told I had a lay-by. I was so shocked.\u201d\n\nThe administrative complications of Thami\u2019s situation caused untold problems. In 2008 she gave birth to her son, Lwando, and was excited that her daughter, Masibulele (now 18), had a sibling. But the little boy\u2019s arrival only brought more stress as she was unable to register his birth.\n\n\u201cI was told if I wanted to register him, he\u2019d have to take the surname I was fighting to free myself of,\u201d Thami says.\n\nShe couldn\u2019t claim any maternity benefits either.\n\nWhen Lwando was two, the family discovered he had speech problems and took him to hospital in the hope of getting him examined. But mother and son were turned away because the little boy had no birth certificate. \u201cAnd we didn\u2019t have the money to take him to a private hospital.\u201d\n\nWhen the time came for Lwando to go to Grade R she was relieved that a school in the Joburg CBD where they were living was prepared to overlook the fact that he didn\u2019t have a birth certificate and accept him. His mom could fill in the requisite paperwork once she\u2019d sorted out her nightmare, they said.\n\n\u201cThey were gracious,\u201d Thami says.\n\nIn 2014 the family was forced to move from the city centre to Finetown because they could no longer afford rent. They wanted to enrol Lwando in a local school but he was refused because of the birth certificate issue, so Thami now has to spend R40 a day on transport and R940 a month on school fees for him.\n\nMoney has been tight since she lost her job at Absa, where she was a promising temporary employee, having started as a call-centre agent and then moved to the administration department. She was on track to being appointed permanently but her prospects plummeted when the company checked her credit record.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s most painful is that I started the department with the manager. Six people were hired after me and I trained them. \u201cThey were taken on permanently, and I was left out in the cold.\u201d\n\nShe went to job interviews but was rejected at every turn because of her credit score.\n\n\u201cIt became the story of my life.\u201d\n\nThami hasn\u2019t been able to work for eight years and the family survives on what her partner makes as a technician. Without work Thami redoubled her efforts at trying to solve the problem.\n\n\u201cI saw it as my job to now go to home affairs. The staff knew me there. When they saw me they\u2019d say, \u2018Here comes trouble\u2019.\n\n\u201cSome of them would tell me, \u2018Don\u2019t make your problem our problem\u2019, or they\u2019d just tell me to stand there and I\u2019d wait for hours.\u201d\n\nThere were times when she broke down and wept in front of them. \u201cThat place was hell. They don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nThami sent emails to former home affairs ministers but nothing helped.\n\n\u201cI even tweeted [ former home affairs minister Malusi] Gigaba until he blocked me.\u201d\n\nEventually she approached the Wits Law Clinic, which took Thami\u2019s plight to the media and finally action was taken. She received her smart ID card recently and home affairs has said it will give her an official letter to present to debtors explaining that someone had been impersonating her. This should lift the blacklisting.\n\nLwando has finally received a birth certificate, 10 years after his birth, which has overjoyed his mother.\n\n\u201cI am genuinely happy for my son. It really touched my heart, even more so than when I received my ID.\u201d\n\nBut Thami remains bitter. \u201cHome affairs may think they have resolved this, but I\u2019m left with scars.\n\n\u201cThe phone still rings nonstop from people saying I owe them money. Others are looking for my so-called husband. \u201cHome affairs destroyed my life.\u201d\n\nMinister of home affairs Aaron Motsoaledi has apologised \u201cprofusely\u201d to Thami for her years of hell.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether she can ever find it in her heart to forgive [us]. What she went through was terrible. The issue I\u2019m apologizing about is that it took too long.\u201d\n\nThe department of home affairs is continuing its investigations into the circumstances surrounding Thami\u2019s case.", "description": "Her world was upended when her identity was stolen.
