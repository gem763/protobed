Hezbollah denied this.\n\nThe latest tension came after Hezbollah, whose forces have fought in support of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria's civil war, said two of its men were killed in an Israeli strike in Syria late last month.\n\nIsrael said its attack in Syria thwarted an Iranian-led drone strike against it.\n\nAny new war between Israel and Hezbollah would raise the risk of a wider conflict in the Middle East, where Iran has defied U.S. attempts to force it to renegotiate a 2015 nuclear deal it reached with world powers.\n\nAt the same time, Israel is alarmed by Iran's growing influence in the region through militia allies such as Hezbollah in countries such as Syria.", "description": "Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah downed an Israeli unmanned aircraft on Monday outside a southern Lebanese town after it crossed the border, the group said in a statement.", "authors": ["Thomson Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5275677.1568007234!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/1165668707.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
