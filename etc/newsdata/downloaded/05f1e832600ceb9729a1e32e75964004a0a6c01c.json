FOREX-Brexit confusion weighs on pound, dents risk appetite\n\n* Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh\n\n* British parliament approves Brexit deal, but rejects\n\ntimetable\n\n* Traders search for positives amid Brexit chaos\n\n* Currencies look for clues on U.S.-China trade war\n\nBy Stanley White\n\nTOKYO, Oct 23 (Reuters) - The pound edged lower on Wednesday\n\nafter an overnight fall as Brexit hung in the balance, with the\n\nBritish Parliament still divided on how, when or even if to\n\nengineer Britain's departure from the European Union.\n\nThe yen rose against the U.S. dollar and the Australian\n\ndollar as some investors sought a safe haven amid doubts about\n\nBrexit and efforts to de-escalate a bruising trade war between\n\nthe United States and China.\n\nA decline in equities and a rise in U.S. Treasury prices in\n\nAsia underscored investors' aversion to taking on big risks as\n\nthe drama over Britain's departure from the EU grows\n\nincreasingly complex by the day.\n\nOn Tuesday, British lawmakers voted by 329 to 299 in favour\n\nof Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Brexit plan, but then opposed\n\nJohnson's extremely tight timetable to complete the legislative\n\nprocess in three days by 322 to 308 votes. It is now up to the EU to decide whether to extend Britain's\n\nOct. 31 deadline for its departure from the bloc, although there\n\nis hope Britain can avoid the worst case scenario of leaving the\n\nEU without any deal in place.\n\nWith no major economic data scheduled in Asia on Wednesday,\n\ntraders will be left to ponder whether Britain will hold a\n\ngeneral election to break the impasse.\n\nInvestors are also closely watching for signs of a thaw in\n\nthe U.S.-China trade war, which has cast a shadow over financial\n\nmarkets and global economic growth.\n\n\"The pound will adjust in a narrow range for the time\n\nbeing,\" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior foreign exchange\n\nstrategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.\n\n\"For now, the risk of a no-deal Brexit has receded, but\n\nthere are still political uncertainties.\"\n\nThe pound GBP=D3 fell 0.16% to $1.2856 after a 0.7% drop\n\non Tuesday.\n\nAgainst the euro, the pound EURGBP=D3 eased to 86.55 pence\n\nfollowing a 0.5% decline in the previous session.\n\nSterling initially rose on Tuesday after parliament approved\n\na second reading of the Brexit deal, but then fell after\n\nlawmakers rejected the timetable.\n\nIt was the first time parliament has signalled support for a\n\ndeal on how Britain would leave the EU, but Johnson had warned\n\nprior to the votes that he would push for an election if his\n\ntimetable for Brexit were defeated.\n\nThe dollar index against a basket of six major\n\ncurrencies stood at 97.545, holding on to a 0.2% gain posted on\n\nTuesday.\n\nThe U.S. currency JPY=EBS fell 0.15% to 108.32 yen. The\n\nAustralian dollar AUDJPY=EBS , whose fortunes are closely tied\n\nto global trade and commodity prices, gave up 0.32% to 74.16\n\nIn the onshore market, the yuan CNY=CFXS traded at 7.0842\n\nper U.S. dollar, weaker than its previous close of 7.0778. In\n\nthe offshore market, it CNH=D3 eased slightly to 7.0841.\n\nTreasury prices rose in Asia as some investors sought safe\n\nhavens, which pushed the yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury\n\nnotes down to 1.7519% and weighed on the dollar-yen\n\ncross.\n\nThe United States and China are trying to finalise the first\n\nphase of a trade agreement before an Asia-Pacific Economic\n\nCooperation summit in Chile in mid-November.\n\nAn exclusive Reuters report that one of the U.S. advisors to\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump on trade talks with China will leave\n\ngovernment could introduce some uncertainty about future trade\n\ntalks.", "description": "FOREX-Brexit confusion weighs on pound, dents risk appetite", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC0O0HA_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
