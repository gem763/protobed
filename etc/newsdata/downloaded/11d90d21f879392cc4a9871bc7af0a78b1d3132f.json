But according to Djawadi, the answer is hidden in the scene\u2019s music.\n\nHBO\n\nThe Emmy-winning composer tells TIME that the progression of \u201cThe Iron Throne,\u201d the song playing in the background of Daenerys\u2019 death scene, contains subtle subtext that explains Drogon\u2019s behavior. He says that the song begins with Jon and Dany\u2019s love theme to illustrate Jon\u2019s heartbreak over making the decision to kill her.\n\n\u201cWe see Dany and Jon and what he has just done, and that\u2019s why the piece starts out with the solo violin and their love theme,\u201d Djawadi explains. \u201cIt\u2019s very fractured to show that [Jon] really can\u2019t believe what he\u2019s just done. The theme plays and then it stops and it starts again, so he\u2019s slowly settling into what he has done while he\u2019s holding her in his arms.\u201d\n\nDjawadi says that the following section of the song highlights Drogon\u2019s inner turmoil over realizing that his mother is dead. \u201cFrom there, the music grows and the dragon theme comes in,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s the dragon, [Daenerys\u2019] baby basically, her child realizing that mommy is dead and then the mixed emotions of sadness and anger at the same time.\u201d\n\nAerial shot of Dragon looking at Jon Snow over Daenerys' dead body on Game of Thrones' series finale Helen Sloan\u2014HBO\n\nDjawadi tells TIME that Drogon burning the Iron Throne was in fact intended to represent him destroying the thing that had truly brought about Daenerys\u2019 downfall \u2014 as well as that of many others along the way. \u201cThat\u2019s how that music grows, and Dany\u2019s theme is in there as well. It\u2019s all these themes together and then it even turns into the main title theme when he melts the throne, which is symbolic for [the throne being] what everybody has been fighting for and [how] he has to resolve that she\u2019s dead now.\u201d\n\nHBO\n\nTo cap things off, Djawadi says that he pulled from one of Daenerys\u2019 earlier themes to bring the moment full circle. \u201c[The song] ends very somber with a section of \u201cBreaker of Chains,\u201d which was from season 4 when she puts the chains on her dragons and that big emotional moment of how hard it was for her to lock them up,\u201d he says. \u201cSo it ends with that emotional beat again and with [Drogon] flying away to the solo violins like the piece started to give bookends to it.\u201d\n\nSounds like Daenerys\u2019 dragons may have been even smarter than you thought.\n\nWatch Daenerys\u2019 death scene below.\n\nWrite to Megan McCluskey at megan.mccluskey@time.com.", "description": "If you're still wondering why Drogon burned the Iron Throne in the\u00a0Game of Thrones\u00a0finale, then composer Ramin Djawadi has the answers you need.", "authors": ["Megan Mccluskey"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/gameofthronesseason8episode6danyiesinjonsarms.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
