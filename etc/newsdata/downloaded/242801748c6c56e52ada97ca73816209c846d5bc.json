Juul has embarked on a media tour over the last several months, as its sleek devices face increasing scrutiny over their role in sparking a teen vaping epidemic. Use of Juuls has also potentially been tied to seizures, Bloomberg News reported.\n\nMeanwhile, regulators are also investigating five deaths and more than 450 cases of serious lung disease tied to vaping. For now, that investigation is mainly focused on people who said they vaped marijuana, but some reports included mention of nicotine as well.\n\nRead more: Here are all the health risks of vaping\n\nJuul has conducted a series of media appearances over the last several months. In July, Juul CEO Kevin Burns apologized to parents of kids addicted to Juul. Last month, Burns warned people against using the Juul. In the same appearance, Burns also said his company was helping smokers quit.\n\nRead more: Here's the real reason that Juul's CEO is warning people against using his e-cigs\n\nJuul now has 15 working days to respond to the FDA and correct the problems identified by the agency.\n\nJuul has walked a fine line between portraying its products as a trendy gadget and a healthcare tool. Products like Juul can't be explicitly marketed as tools for quitting smoking, according to federal law. But that doesn't mean companies who make them can't suggestively advertise them as such.\n\nIn March, Juul put out a study suggesting that some adult smokers may be using Juuls to wean themselves off regular cigarettes. The study, published four years after Juul's products had been on the market, was paid for by Juul.\n\nDuring one of his recent media appearnces Burns said Juul was \"absolutely contributing to the decline of the smoking rate.\" Smoking rates in the US have been steadily declining since the 1960s, reaching the lowest level ever recorded in 2017, according to the CDC.", "description": "The $38 billion company is facing increasing scrutiny over its role in sparking a teen vaping epidemic.", "authors": ["Erin Brodwin"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d766b482e22af6f0d7d9db3-1536-768.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
