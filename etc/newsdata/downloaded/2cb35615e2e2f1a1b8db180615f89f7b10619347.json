That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing.\n\nView our latest analysis for Apollo Hospitals Enterprise\n\nIf a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. That's why it's good to see Apollo Hospitals Enterprise paying out a modest 32% of its earnings. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 31% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio.\n\nIt's positive to see that Apollo Hospitals Enterprise's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.\n\nClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.\n\nNSEI:APOLLOHOSP Historical Dividend Yield, September 8th 2019 More\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nWhen earnings decline, dividend companies become much harder to analyse and own safely. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. So we're not too excited that Apollo Hospitals Enterprise's earnings are down 3.9% a year over the past five years.\n\nAnother key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, Apollo Hospitals Enterprise has lifted its dividend by approximately 6.3% a year on average.\n\nFinal Takeaway\n\nIs Apollo Hospitals Enterprise worth buying for its dividend? Earnings per share are down meaningfully, although at least the company is paying out a low and conservative percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. It's definitely not great to see earnings falling, but at least there may be some buffer before the dividend needs to be cut. Overall we're not hugely bearish on the stock, but there are likely better dividend investments out there.\n\nWondering what the future holds for Apollo Hospitals Enterprise?
