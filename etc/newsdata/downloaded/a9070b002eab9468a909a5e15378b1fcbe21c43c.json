Several years on, Rewind returns to visit them to see how the movement has progressed.\n\n70-year-old Edith Floyd, an urban farming veteran, has expanded her farm from nine lots to 32 and has added a large hoop house, where she can grow fruits and vegetables year-round.\n\n\"We have broccoli, collards, green peppers and celery,\" she explains.\n\nShe says she plans to keep on farming for years to come: \"If you don't work, you don't eat. And if you don't work, you get lazy and don't want to do nothing. Work keeps me going. I like working.\"\n\nA few miles away, Mark Covington and his mother have also grown their farm.\n\n\"I want to say we only had eight lots and now we have 24 that we either keep cut or we grow something on,\" Covington says.\n\nHe now keeps bees, which he says has tripled food production, and he has a host of new farm animals.\n\nBoth farmers have their communities in mind; Floyd contributes to a food bank, and people who have court-ordered volunteer hours can fulfil them on her farm instead of paying a fine or going to prison. Covington has purchased a nearby house for a community education centre, and also provides fresh food to the area.\n\n\"We have our turkey giveaway every year. We do 30 to 35 turkeys with a basket, so we'll put kale and collards and string beans in with it, along with some other donations that we get,\" he says.\n\n\"This is an asset to the city. Not just the neighbourhood but the city.\"\n\nSource: Al Jazeera", "description": "Residents in a US city recovering from decades of urban decay are turning vacant plots of land into flourishing farms.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/14/df721358ed6141e2a99609256a21d630_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
