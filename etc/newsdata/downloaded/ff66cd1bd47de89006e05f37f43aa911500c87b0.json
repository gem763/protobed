Reminder: There are 122 days until the Iowa caucuses and 396 days until the 2020 presidential election.\n\n[Who\u2019s running for president? Click here for Yahoo News\u2019 2020 tracker]\n\nA half-dozen new national polls that show support for the impeachment inquiry into President Trump took a big jump in the past week \u2014 even before some of the most significant evidence gathered by House investigators was released to the public.\n\nEven more worrying for the White House, more and more Americans are looking past impeachment (in the House) to the trial in the Senate, and coming down on the side of Trump\u2019s conviction and removal from office.\n\n\u2022 A CNN poll found that 47 percent believe Trump \u201cshould be impeached and removed from office,\u201d up from 41 percent in May. The survey found that 45 percent disagree, down from 54 percent in the May poll.\n\n\u2022 A USA Today/Ipsos poll found 44 percent support Trump\u2019s conviction in the Senate and removal from office, compared with 35 percent who do not.\n\nTo put it another way, with impeachment proceedings just getting underway, only 21 percent were undecided, and barely more than a third of respondents came down on the side of keeping Trump in office.\n\nTo put it another way, for him to command even a 51-49 majority at the end of the process, the undecideds would have to break more than 3-1 (i.e., 16-5) in his favor.\n\nTo put it another way \u2026 well, draw your own conclusions. Some Republican senators already have.\n\nThe polls were taken after the release of a memo summarizing a phone call in which Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, the basis for the impeachment inquiry, but before a flurry of related developments that gave added impetus to the probe.\n\n\u2014 Jerry Adler\n\nSen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa (Photo: Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images) More\n\nGOP senator grilled about \u2018silence\u2019 on impeachment\n\nWith impeachment fever gripping Washington, D.C., Republican members of Congress returned to their home districts, where the issue wasn\u2019t at the top of the agenda for many of their constituents.\n\nIt was, however, for Amy Haskins, who grilled GOP Sen. Joni Ernst at a town hall in Templeton, Iowa, for not confronting President Trump over his calls for foreign leaders to investigate a political opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son.\n\n\u201cYou still stand there silent. And your silence is supporting him in not standing up,\u201d Haskins said to the Iowa senator. \u201cYou, yourself, served. You didn\u2019t pledge an oath to the president. You pledged it to our country, you pledged it to our Constitution. When are you guys going to start standing up and actually be there for us?\u201d\n\nErnst essentially dodged the question.\n\n\u2018I can say \u2018yea, nay, whatever,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThe president is going to say what the president is going to do. It\u2019s up to us as members of Congress to continue working with our allies, making sure that we remain strong in the face of adversity.\u201d\n\nLater, when pressed by Haskins to condemn Trump\u2019s requests for foreign leaders to investigate his political rivals, Ernst echoed Trump\u2019s claim that he doesn\u2019t care about politics, only corruption.\n\n\u201cI would say to that, corruption no matter where it is should be ferreted out,\u201d Ernst said. \u201cIf we have corruption here, it should be ferreted out. If there\u2019s corruption in other countries.\u201d\n\nThat is in contrast to a statement by her colleague Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, who called Trump\u2019s conduct \u201cwrong and appalling.\u201d", "description": "A half-dozen new national polls that show support for the impeachment inquiry into President Trump took a big jump in the past week \u2014 even before some of the most significant evidence was released to the public.", "authors": ["Dylan Stableford", "Christopher Wilson", "Senior Staff"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/99GPbCceAnue9gG9zXeLkQ--~B/aD0zMjY0O3c9NDg5NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/a0ade670-e6d3-11e9-b9b2-850d80ece966", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
