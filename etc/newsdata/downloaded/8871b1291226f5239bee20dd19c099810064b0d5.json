This figure is also unevenly distributed, with five artists making up 40.7% of this figure and Yayoi Kusama in particular accounting for 25% alone.\n\nMuseums in US still failing with artist diversity, study finds Read more\n\nThe study looked at 26 art museums and institutions in the US as well as an analysis of the global art market between 2008 and 2018, following on from a similar study looking at African American artists.\n\nIt was found that out of the total number of art acquisitions for permanent collections only 11% (29,247 acquisitions of 260,470) were by women while just 14% of exhibitions were either from solo or groups of female artists.\n\n\u201cWhen we set out to do this project, we were excited to track just how much things had changed for female artists,\u201d said Julia Halperin, artnet News executive editor. \u201cSo, it was quite disheartening for us to find that the numbers remained so low, and there had been so little measurable change. But we can\u2019t solve a problem until we acknowledge it exists, and this project serves as an important reminder that we have a long way to go before we reach parity.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, a study by Chad Topaz also found that US museums were struggling with diversity across the board. His data showed that collections from 18 major institutions were both 85% white and 87% male.\n\n\u201cThe art world is simply not the liberal, progressive bastion that it imagines itself to be,\u201d said Helen Molesworth, a former chief curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, \u201cand you can\u2019t solve a problem you can\u2019t own.\u201d", "description": "A new report finds women\u2019s work still underrepresented in the art world, with only 11% of art purchased by institutions female-made", "authors": ["Guardian Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3cf4db8518c2cbab5e28115b8268a0c3200003de/209_364_2750_1650/master/2750.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a7095bd646b5934748b8989bdc747e0d", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
