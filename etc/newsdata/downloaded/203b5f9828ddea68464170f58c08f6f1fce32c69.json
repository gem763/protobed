The first restaurant opened in Soho, London, and pizza was sold for two shillings (around 10p) a slice. At the start of the Pizza Express empire, Mr Boizot\u2019s takings were only \u00a33.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe business man died in December 2018, but by then the restaurant chain had already been acquired by Hony Capital, a Chinese private equity firm, in an deal said to be worth \u00a3873 million in 2014.\n\nHony Capital are still the current owners of Pizza Express and the company facing talks about the restaurant chain\u2019s future.\n\nThe restaurant chain still have time to turn things around (Picture: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg via Getty Images)\n\nWhy does Pizza Express face administration?\n\nPizza Express is currently in trouble because it has a pile of debt worth an estimated \u00a31.1 billion.\n\nSales in the UK and abroad fell last year, meaning that the company\u2019s operating profits were more than offset by the high interest payments \u2013 valued at around \u00a393 million per year \u2013 owed on the escalating debt.\n\nThe debt payments have left Pizza Express in the red for the last two years, and in 2018 the business made a loss of approximately \u00a355 million.\n\nWill Pizza Express face the same fate as Jamie\u2019s Italian? (Picture: Steve Taylor/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)\n\nHowever, while Pizza Express may face administration at some point in the future, that is only if they don\u2019t get their finances in order and the company back into the black.\n\nAt the moment the restaurant chain is not in imminent danger because the owners have until 2021 before they need to start paying back over \u00a3600 million owed to outside creditors.\n\nBut, with huge companies like Thomas Cook hitting the headlines for crumbling under debt and high street restaurant chains such as Jamie\u2019s Italian folding, the future of dough balls and garlic dip on the high-street looks uncertain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Fears Pizza Express is about to fold as bosses hold urgent talks with creditors\n\nMORE: What happens now that Thomas Cook has confirmed it has collapsed?", "description": "Pizza Express have hired financial advisors for help in handling crunch talks with creditors after it's emerged they may face administration.", "authors": ["Rachael Martin"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_88840741-e1570455779162_1570528193.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
