The second stage extends the conflict to China investment to the US (CFIUS) and export controls (through the Export Control Act and the Entity List). The third stage might involve restrictions on US capital funding Chinese firms. It has not started but that is a risk that we have advised to hedge,\u201d they said.\n\nIt\u2019s the third step that represents the \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d for Chinese equities, said the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale analysts, adding that such measures could include preventing U.S.-based stock index providers from putting Chinese stocks in benchmarks pegged to trillions of dollars of assets.\n\nStill, they still favored keeping Chinese stocks in portfolios if only because legal difficulties and recent denials by the U.S. of plans to delist Chinese companies had made more draconian measures to curtail U.S. capital flows unlikely to take place.\n\nChina\u2019s CSI 300 stock index is up 27%, compared with the 16% gain in the S&P 500 SPX, -1.56% , FactSet data show.\n\nSee: What investors need to know about a potential White House effort to block U.S. investment in China\n\nBloomberg News reported White House officials had narrowed down its menu of policy measures used to restrict U.S. investments into China, specifically removing certain Chinese stocks from government pension funds.\n\nBut in the event of a broader \u201cassault,\u201d analysts at the French bank say it could undermine the case for holding Chinese equities for three reasons:\n\nOne, Chinese efforts to lower debt levels in the economy depend on a backdrop of rising domestic equity values. Policies to allow private investors to take stakes in state-controlled companies will only see uptake if they anticipate values of their investments rising.\n\n\u201cIf debt/equity ratios cannot be curbed by raising the denominator, the overall debt de-leveraging process will become more painful,\u201d they said.\n\nFurther attempts to prevent U.S. and overseas investors from accessing Chinese capital markets could raise the risk premium of the country\u2019s equities, which has gradually shrunk in recent years as its stock markets become more accessible. The risk premium denotes how much investors demand in additional returns for holding stocks over risk-free assets like bonds.\n\n\u201cQuestioning China equity integration in global financial markets would increase the risk perception,\u201d said Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n\nChinese risk premiums have fallen\n\nFinally, restricted inflows into Chinese markets would undermine arguments by bullish investors who saw the opening of the country\u2019s domestic equities to overseas investments as a catalyst for further gains. Under pressure to match their competing benchmarks, money managers would increase their allocations to Chinese equities.\n\nThey point to MSCI\u2019s decision to include onshore Chinese stocks in a wider range of indexes last year, a move that comes as Beijing removes restrictions on Wall Street firms from buying and selling Chinese assets.\n\nSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale estimated that onshore markets have attracted between $50 to $60 billion since the index provider first included domestic listed A-shares in its benchmarks in 2018.\n\nForeign holdings of stocks listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen\u2019s bourses stood at around 3% in June 2019, more than doubling since 2016.", "description": "U.S.-China trade tensions have steadily deteriorated, with the latest headlines pointing to fresh efforts to decouple the two largest economies in the world.", "authors": ["Sunny Oh"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS875_uschin_ZG_20191008121602.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
