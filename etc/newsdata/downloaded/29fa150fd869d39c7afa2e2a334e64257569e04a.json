REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach\n\nBolivia has been convulsed by protests since Oct. 20, when its Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) abruptly suspended the publication of results from an electronic count that eventually gave Morales a fourth term, leading to accusations of fraud.\n\nWith 84% of votes counted, polling showed Morales was likely headed to a runoff with Mesa, his chief rival and a former president. However, when reporting of the count resumed after a pause of nearly 24 hours, it showed Morales had pulled off a razor-thin victory.\n\nThe final, legally binding vote tally gave him 47.08% of votes to Mesa\u2019s 36.51%, less than a percentage point more than the 10-point lead needed to avoid a runoff and giving him another five-year term.\n\nFive protesters in industrial Santa Cruz, where people have been on strike since last Wednesday, suffered gunshot wounds. Police said they were seeking one man they believe to have caused the injuries.\n\nBoth Morales, who has been in office nearly 14 years and is Latin America\u2019s longest-serving leader, and Mesa spoke to seas of flag-waving supporters at rallies late on Monday, each accusing the other of inciting violence.\n\nMorales, speaking in El Alto outside the capital, repeated his declaration of victory, while Mesa doubled down on accusations of fraud in front of a crowd in southern La Paz.\n\n\u201cThey accuse me of generating violence, lying shamelessly,\u201d Mesa said to applause. \u201cI\u2019m here - I\u2019ll go to prison or to the presidency!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have decided to confront the authoritarianism, on the way to a dictatorship, the authoritarianism that seeks to rob us of an election,\u201d he said.\n\nMesa told Reuters in an interview earlier on Monday strikers would not accept negotiations to end protests and that Morales wanted to stay in power indefinitely, something the president had previously denied.\n\nMorales lamented at his rally that \u201csome groups do not recognize the triumph of the Bolivian people. They aren\u2019t the majority, they are small groups.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome ask for strikes until Evo goes. Some say new elections, others a second round ... they need to understand that we won in the first round,\u201d he said.\n\nThe opposition has limited time to take down barricades in the capital before the president\u2019s supporters do, lawmaker Freddy Mamani said at Morales\u2019 rally.\n\nMorales reiterated a promise his government made at the weekend to have the Organization of American States audit the election.\n\nMorales, 60, has said he would go to a second round of voting if irregularities were found, but also that rural supporters could put cities under siege. The TSE and Morales deny any election fraud.\n\nStrikers in the capital, La Paz, and other cities blocked roads and schools and shops were closed as protesters from opposing sides yelled and pushed each other in skirmishes on otherwise empty streets.\n\nThe opposition-controlled mayor\u2019s office in La Paz, which has a million inhabitants, was also shut.\n\nSlideshow (29 Images)\n\nResidents created road blocks using cars, wooden planks, rope and even dumpsters in both the middle-class south and working-class north of the city, according to Reuters witnesses.\n\n\u201cWe are demanding that our vote be respected,\u201d said protester Marta Colque, 32, who works at a daycare center, adding Morales wanted to \u201cstay forever.\u201d\n\nMorales supporters in Santa Cruz used rocks and sticks to confront police and opposition protesters amid clouds of tear gas.", "description": "Supporters and opponents of Bolivian President Evo Morales both ended a day of protests with large rallies on Monday, as Morales' election rival Carlos Mesa assured backers he was headed to either prison or the presidency.", "authors": ["Vivian Sequera", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446022472&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S01Z", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
