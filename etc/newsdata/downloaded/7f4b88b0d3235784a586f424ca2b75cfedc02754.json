Amazon\u2019s big talk was all about the innovations to the line of Echo products that have become ubiquitous with the smart home movement. They launched a bunch of brand new or newly upgraded Echo gadgets today that you can preorder right now.\n\nEcho Flex, $25: Having an Echo around no longer needs to involve a countertop. This brand new plug-in smart speaker fits into any outlet.\n\nEcho Dot, $60: This updated Dot has all the makings of a perfect bedside clock, with a new LED display that shows the time, temperature, and more.\n\nEcho Show 8, $130: The new Echo Show has an 8\u201d HD screen and is just what you need to listen to podcasts, stream shows or movies, or make a video call.\n\nEcho Studio, $200: No longer is the Echo family an assistant before it\u2019s a speaker. The Studio has five speakers with Dolby Atmos technology built-in.\n\nEcho Buds, $130: Amazon teams up with Bose to add Active Noise Reduction Technology and hands-free Alexa access in a pair of wireless, Bluetooth earbuds. Airpods, who?\n\nInvite Only (Because there are limited quantities, you\u2019ll need to request an invitation through Amazon for potential purchase):\n\nEcho Frames, $180: These glasses have Alexa built right in to give the ability to make calls or set reminders on-the-go. For having all of that built-in, they look pretty unassuming, which is a plus.\n\nEcho Loop, $130: This smart ring is an even more discreet way to keep tabs on your daily activity. It\u2019s basically a spy gadget in real life.\n\nMORE FROM SCOUTED:\n\nScouted is internet shopping with a pulse.
