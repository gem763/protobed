Sometimes it can be obvious to us, as outsiders, that a friend or family member might benefit from seeing a trained professional who can provide insight and talk through issues.\n\nBut not everyone is keen on hopping onto a therapist\u2019s couch. Not to mention that therapy is a huge financial burden \u2015 it may not be covered by insurance and some sessions can cost upwards of $400. And it can also be difficult finding someone depending on where you live.\n\nSo how do you go about trying to nudge someone into giving therapy a whirl and help them find the right specialist? Experts say the subject should be approached delicately and compassionately.\n\nWe surveyed some therapists to get their best tips on how to suggest that someone close to you make an appointment with a mental health professional.\n\nStart by bringing it up in a comfortable or private situation.\n\nFind the right place and the right time to have the conversation. Brandi Lewis, owner of Reach Counseling Solutions in Charlotte, North Carolina, said bringing up the subject at the dinner table or in the middle of an event aren\u2019t good times.\n\n\u201cSuggesting therapy is a sensitive topic and making a loved one uncomfortable or embarrassed in front of other people can only further complicate things,\u201d she explained.\n\nInstead, Lewis suggested having a one-on-one conversation, \u201cideally when the issue at hand arises so that the person involved can possibly see your concern instead of talking about the issue in the past tense.\u201d\n\nHowever, don\u2019t do it directly in the middle of an argument or in a tense situation, said Judi Cin\u00e9as, a psychotherapist who works in Florida and New York.\n\n\u201cDuring those times, the recommendation is likely to be received less from a viewpoint of caring and more like a wagging finger in the face saying \u2018something\u2019s wrong with you,\u2019\u201d she explained.\n\nBringing it up gently and shortly after an issue has subsided can help you express your concern without using therapy as an argument tactic, which only further adds to stigma.\n\nShare your own experience.\n\nbernardbodo via Getty Images\n\nFor therapy newbies, the idea of sitting across from a mental health professional and spilling out secrets can be daunting. But if you can fill someone in on the positives of your own therapy experiences, that can help to put a person\u2019s mind at ease.\n\n\u201cThink about the questions you had before your first therapy session and share what that experience was like for you,\u201d said Matt Smith, a licensed professional counselor and owner of ModernEra Counseling in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nIf you have never been to therapy or do not know someone who has, then do a quick internet search to find success stories to share, suggested Shelley Sommerfeldt, a clinical psychologist, relationship coach and founder of Loving Roots Project. (This piece on the best advice people learned in therapy may be a good place to start.) Showing someone these types of stories, according to Sommerfeldt, normalizes therapy and allows a person to feel like they\u2019re not alone.\n\n\u201cWhen people are struggling with an issue, they can often feel that it will never get any better. By providing some stories of people who have had success and gotten better, this can help your loved one to see that there is hope for their situation as well and they may have a more open mindset about going to therapy as well,\u201d she added.\n\nClarify your motives for wanting them to seek help.\n\nIt\u2019s easy for someone to be offended by the suggestion of \u201cneeding\u201d psychological support, said Christina Iglesia, a licensed clinical psychologist who started the #TherapyIsCool mental health campaign. Since people can commonly misinterpret the reasons why therapy is being recommend, it\u2019s very important to spell out why you are suggesting that a loved one sign up.\n\n\u201cSaying things like, \u2018I am proposing therapy because I see that you are struggling\u2019 can inform the other person that this suggestion is made from a place of love and concern,\u201d she said.\n\nBe gentle in your approach.\n\nSilvia Bianchini via Getty Images\n\nPhrasing is a key issue, said Carla Marie Manly, a clinical psychologist in Sonoma County, California. Here are a few of her suggestions for gentle, thoughtful phrasing:\n\n\u201cI love you so much and see that you\u2019re struggling a bit with ____ (anxiety, depression, stress). Confidentially, I\u2019ve heard of a great therapist who specializes in ____. Would you like his/her name?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAs your best friend (sister, parent, etc.), I\u2019m always your supporter. I\u2019m honored that you share your struggles with me, and I\u2019m thinking that maybe a therapist would be helpful. I\u2019m here for you, but I\u2019m not an expert. I\u2019ve done some confidential research and have a few names to offer you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt seems like your anxiety (stress, depression, etc.) is getting more challenging. I found a great confidential support group. It\u2019s every Monday night at 6 p.m. at the local community center. I was wondering if you\u2019d like to go with me this coming Monday?\u201d\n\nDestigmatize the experience.\n\nThere are many misconceptions about mental health, explained Catherine Jackson, a psychologist and neurotherapist who practices in Chicago. Make sure to use language that is not stigmatizing when talking about therapy.\n\n\u201cLet your loved one know you are there for support in the process and share how a therapist can be helpful,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen you approach someone about seeing a therapist, it helps to frame mental health the same way as physical health.\n\n\u201cWould you break your leg and wait for it to heal? No. You go to a medical doctor and trust that doctor to help you fix your leg and to help it heal correctly. The same is true of mental health,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThere is no need to sit at home and simply wait for it to get better.\u201d\n\nKeep in mind that therapy will only be effective if they put in the work.\n\nIn order for therapy to actually make a difference, the person who attends has to be able to find their own reason for being there, said Mark Borg Jr., a psychologist and author of \u201cDON\u2019T BE A DICK: Change Yourself, Change Your World.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said to clients many times, \u2018Therapy is over when you can no longer find a reason for being here,\u2019\u201d he said, adding that most people believe that a person will go to and progress in therapy because they \u201cneed\u201d to. In reality, the process works best when the person is intentionally showing up to their sessions, wanting to be there.\n\nIn order to help a loved one reach that point, Borg recommended asking about what is going on in their life as a way to start finding the root cause of the problems they\u2019re experiencing. That may help them realize therapy could be beneficial to them.\n\nOffer to find a good fit.\n\nMStudioImages via Getty Images\n\n\u201cIt is important that your loved one feels comfortable with the therapist they see so that they don\u2019t have any excuses to drop out,\u201d said Jenkins, who recommended researching therapists on their behalf or providing resources for them to do so themselves.\n\nAsk what their ideal therapist looks like. Do they want to see a man or woman? An older or younger person? A therapist who specializes in certain conditions? This guide can also help you or a loved one find a good therapist based on your needs.\n\nExpect some resistance.\n\nWhen referring a loved one to therapy, you may experience some resistance. Sheila Tucker, a marriage and family therapist with Heart Mind & Soul Counseling in Hilton Head, South Carolina, said to actively listen to their resistance and try not to get offended.\n\n\u201cListen to what your loved one has to say, validate their feelings, and offer your take on the therapeutic process. Also, allow them the opportunity to openly disagree while offering to make time for them if they want to continue the discussion,\u201d she said.", "description": "Therapists share the best ways to approach someone about seeking help from a mental health professional.", "authors": ["On Assignment For Huffpost"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9e2d15210000c3073434af.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
