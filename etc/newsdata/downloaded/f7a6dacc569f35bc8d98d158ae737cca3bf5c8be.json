Following the attack, the young man deliberated over what to do for the best, before coming to the decision to plead guilty, as he hoped this would result in a reduced sentence.\n\nHowever, in the coming episodes, Robert will learn that rapist Lee has died, and thus he\u2019ll be faced with a dilemma of whether to stay and face the music, or go on the run with husband Aaron (Danny Miller). Eventually, he decides on the latter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhether or not he\u2019ll get away remains to be seen but, either way, Robert\u2019s exit will be the end of an era for Emmerdale. The character has been at the heart and soul of some of the soap\u2019s biggest ever moments, and he\u2019s been one half of one of the most popular soap couples of all time, which is a pretty incredible legacy to leave behind.\n\nRyan spoke about his favourite moment on the ITV soap saying: \u2018I was so lucky to be involved in the big crash scenes in 2016. The underwater scenes that we filmed at Pinewood studios were fantastic to do. Me and Danny got to have a lot of fun there swimming in a tank.\u2019\n\n\u2018There were so many special effects in the crash sequence that week it was probably the biggest thing Emmerdale has ever done and it was amazing to be a part of it. I have been very lucky to be involved in some very ambitious stunts and storylines but that was the stand out one: everyone pulled together, we were up against the odds but I really think we managed to pull it off.\u2019\n\nEmmerdale airs weeknights at 7pm on ITV.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Choosing just one was no doubt a tall task!", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Emmerdale-Robert-Sugden-741141-1a78_1569842955.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
