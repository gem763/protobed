The waves of protests, sparked by the controversial extradition bill under which individuals can be sent to mainland China for trial, have entered their 13th week. Over the past three months, the protests have become a broader and increasingly violent anti-government movement as the animosity between demonstrators and police reaches boiling point.\n\nHong Kong protests: Carrie Lam denies offering to resign Read more\n\nBeijing sees the increasingly violent demonstrations as a direct challenge to its rule over Hong Kong and has accused \u201cforeign hostile forces\u201d, particularly the United States and Britain, of fomenting unrest.\n\nThe survey, the IHS Markit Hong Kong purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI), sank to 40.8 in August from 43.8 in the previous month. Any figure below 50 indicates contraction.\n\nAccording to the survey, new business fell to its lowest rate in a decade, as orders from China declined at a record rate. Nearly half of survey respondents reported reduced Chinese demand, citing the ongoing US-China trade dispute, a sharp depreciation in the renminbi and large-scale protests as reasons.\n\n\u201cThe latest PMI data reveal a Hong Kong economy flirting with recession in the third quarter as business activity is increasingly aggravated by protest-related paralysis,\u201d said Bernard Aw, principal economist at IHS Markit. \u201cThe survey is now broadly indicative of the economy contracting at an annual rate of around 4.0-4.5%.\u201d\n\nHong Kong protests: Carrie Lam denies offering to resign Read more\n\n\u201cThe rates of decline in output, new orders and export sales accelerated sharply in August,\u201d he said, adding that the only other time that the PMI survey recorded a steeper downturn was during the global financial crisis in 2008-2009 and the Sars crisis in 2003.\n\nIt comes after figures on Friday showed tourist arrivals fell 12% in July, with the numbers for August expected to be even worse. Retail sales, another important part of the economy, fell 4% in July.\n\nThat data prompted economists at the global consultancy Capital Economics to say that \u201cHong Kong\u2019s economy is in recession\u201d.", "description": "Business activity shows sharpest drop since global financial crisis amid increasingly bleak outlook for territory", "authors": ["Verna Yu"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6884d7d82faa12ccd3ae62d483756cb46484ad6c/0_195_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0ef9da72fce24c4307e591f221bfa0a7"}
