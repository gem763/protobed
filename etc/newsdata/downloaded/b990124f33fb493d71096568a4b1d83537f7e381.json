The swing is said to have undergone four months of security checks and can withstand a magnitude 10 earthquake\n\nAs a city known for its wacky architecture, Chongqing is already home to an enormous rocking chair which is erected on a 1,000-foot-tall cliff.\n\nThe newly complete structure, however, is taller, faster and scarier.\n\nAs part of the Yunyang Longgang Scenic Spot, the huge ride consists of a 328-foot-tall arch and a 354-foot-tall launching tower, and is situated at an altitude of 3,608 feet.\n\nThe 'rocking chair' is connected to the arch by two cables which are also said to be 354 feet long.\n\nThrill-seekers, up to three in one go, will be lifted into the air by a rope attached to the launching tower before being flung out at a high speed.\n\nInstead of being secured to chairs, tourists will be bound to harness side by side horizontally before taking the white-knuckle ride.\n\nAs part of the Yunyang Longgang Scenic Spot in Chongqing, the huge ride consists of a 328-foot-tall arch and a 354-foot-tall launching tower. Riders will travel at a top speed of 80mph\n\nHead engineer Shi Xuebin said the swing could reach a maximum angle of 90 degrees above the ground, or 230 feet from the edge of the cliff.\n\nThe engineer has ensured the public the safety of the machine.\n\nThe swing has undergone four months of security checks and is able to withstand a magnitude 10 earthquake as well as high winds with gusts of up to 103 miles per hour, according to the engineer.\n\n'Tourists must wear safety clothes certified by the European Union. And in order to provide them with extra protection, we have added tailor-made safety belts on the outside of the clothes,' Mr Shi said.\n\nThe construction of the swing has been complete and the attraction is set to open on January 1, 2020.\n\nAdventurous residents of Chongqing are spoilt for choices when it comes to extreme rides.\n\nThe city's Wansheng Ordovician Theme Park boasts not one, but five enormous swings as well as a glass-bottom walkway 390 feet above the ground.\n\nThe park's latest swing opened last year and was constructed over a 1,000-foot-deep drop.\n\nThe swing is attached to a beam as high as 59 feet - the equivalent to a six-storey building.\n\nEvery day, up to 4,000 people flock to the park to experience the unique swings, according to a spokesperson.", "description": "As part of the Yunyang Longgang Scenic Spot in China, the huge ride consists of a 328-foot-tall arch and a 354-foot-tall launching tower, and is situated at an altitude of 3,608 feet.", "authors": ["Tracy You For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/12/20290944-0-image-a-81_1572352156977.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
