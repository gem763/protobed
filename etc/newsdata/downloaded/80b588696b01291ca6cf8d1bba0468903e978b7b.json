That number represents the world\u2019s second highest death rate among listed countries in the WHO report.\n\nOnly North Korea had a worse score. As many as 238 people per 100,000 are thought to have died there from air pollution-related illnesses, said the WHO.\n\nAmong Europe\u2019s best performers for both least air pollution averages and air pollution-related deaths include all of Scandinavia, Finland, Spain, Portugal and Ireland.\n\nSweden in 2012 registered less than one death per 100,000 people due to air pollution and had Europe\u2019s lowest average of 5.9 micrograms of pollutants per cubic metre.\n\nFrance ranked high among European nations with the lowest average rate of air pollution but, at nearly 13 micrograms of pollutants per cubic metre, the country came behind both Switzerland and the United Kingdom.\n\nFrance did, however, come within the top 10 European countries with the lowest rate of air pollution-related deaths.\n\nThese figures come as the WHO works on reaching its 2030 global health targets which include reducing the per capital environmental impact of cities on air quality, ensuring universal access to modern energy services and increasing the share of sustainable and renewable energy sources.\n\nAs many as 3 billion people across the world heat their homes inefficiently and use dirty fuels which exacerbate air quality levels, the WHO said. It estimates as many as 4.3 million people died globally in 2012 due to air pollution.\n\nOf that number, as many as 60 percent are estimated to be women and children, said the WHO. It adds that 92 percent of the world\u2019s population in 2014 lived in areas where WHO air quality standards weren\u2019t met.\n\nParticularly fine air pollutants can cause cardiovascular diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, respiratory infections and even cases of lung cancer.\n\nA 2016 report by the European Environmental Agency found that, despite improvements in air quality, a large portion of European populations remain exposed to these fine air pollutants.\n\nThe report analysed air quality from 2000 to 2014 and covered 42 European countries and data obtained from 400 monitoring stations.\n\nIt found that pollution from cars, power plants, households and agriculture, contribute to nearly 467,000 premature deaths throughout the continent, a vast majority of them within EU-member countries.\n\nThe report also said that in 2014 nearly 85 percent of Europeans were exposed to hazardous levels of fine particulate air pollutants in excess of WHO guidelines.\n\nFighting air pollution levels on the continent has been the focus of European lawmakers for decades, but it has taken on new significance since the signing of the Paris climate deal.\n\nFollowing the EEA report, France, the UK, Germany, Spain and Italy were sent final warnings from the European Commission in February for failing to correct repeated violations of Nitrous Oxide limits.\n\nThose final warnings came on the heels of Paris being struck this past December with its worst bout of air pollution in a decade.\n\nAlthough cities across Europe including Paris, London and Berlin, have implemented contingency plans to address high pollution levels, more people die per 100,000 of air pollution in Norway (12.7) than do people in the United States (12.1), according to the WHO.\n\nNorway ranks as the fourth least hazardous European country in terms of air quality by the WHO. The United States ranks as the one of the world\u2019s top polluting countries.\n\nThe European Commission said Nitrous Oxide was responsible for killing as many as 70,000 people in 2013.", "description": "New data from the World Health Organization shows Eastern European and Balkan countries suffer the highest rate of European air pollution.", "authors": ["Pierre Bertrand"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/368536/1000x563_368536.jpg", "published_at": "2017-05-18"}
