Bernie Sanders (I-VT) on Thursday called for \u201cmore justices like Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor\u201d in response to Mayor Pete Buttigieg\u2019s (D) interview with Cosmopolitan in which he called for Supreme Court additions along the lines of Justice Anthony Kennedy.\n\nButtigieg, who is experiencing a surge in Iowa as recent polls indicate, discussed the state of the Supreme Court in an interview with Cosmopolitan published Thursday. The South Bend mayor told the magazine that the \u201cindependence\u201d and \u201cintegrity\u201d of the Supreme Court is \u201cespecially important for LGBTQ rights\u201d and walked through some of his proposals for reform designed \u201cto stop the descent of the Supreme Court into becoming yet another political body.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy appointments will definitely be people who share my values. But when I\u2019m talking about the structure of the Supreme Court, I\u2019m talking about something deeper. I\u2019m talking about depoliticizing the Supreme Court,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBecause right now, every time there\u2019s a vacancy, there\u2019s this apocalyptic ideological battle and it hurts the court and it hurts the country,\u201d he continued.\n\nButtigieg talked about his idea to expand the size of the Supreme Court in order to incorporate \u201cmore justices who think for themselves,\u201d citing \u201cJustice Kennedy or Justice Souter\u201d:\n\nSo I\u2019ve floated several ideas and deliberately kept some level of open-mindedness about which ones are going to work best. One of them would be to have 15 members, but 5 of them can only be seated if the other 10 unanimously agree. The idea here is you get more justices who think for themselves. Justices like Justice Kennedy or Justice Souter, and there are many legal scholars who think this could be done without a constitutional amendment under current law.\n\nSanders, however, disagreed and made it known that he is only interested in piling the court with ultra-progressive justices who are ideologically similar to Ginsburg and Sotomayor.\n\n\u201cInteresting, I\u2019d like more justices like Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor,\u201d Sanders tweeted:\n\nInteresting, I\u2019d like more justices like Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor. https://t.co/zfv9U0Liut \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) October 24, 2019\n\nSanders and Buttigieg have largely avoided attacking each other on the campaign trail and are both experiencing a bit of a boost, recent polls indicate.\n\nA Quinnipiac University Poll released on Thursday shows the Vermont senator in third place with 15 percent support, followed by Buttigieg, who garnered ten percent support.", "description": "Sen.
