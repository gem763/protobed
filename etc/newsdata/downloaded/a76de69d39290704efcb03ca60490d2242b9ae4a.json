If we do the right things, they will reprice.\"\n\nThe yield on South Africa's 10-year debt is higher than Russia's, which has a similar Baa3 rating with Moody's. It's also more than Brazil's, rated two levels lower.\n\nWhile the central bank usually refrains from commenting on fiscal policy, Kganyago and his Monetary Policy Committee have over the past year become more vocal on the urgent need for reforms, especially amid suggestions that the economy should be boosted by cutting interest rates.\n\nThe economic policy paper that the National Treasury released in August, which contains a package of suggested reforms to boost growth, is a \"welcome development,\" Kganyago said.\n\n\"At the very least, it had enabled South Africa to frame the conversation about what\u2019s needed.\"\n\nEskom has amassed 450 billion rand ($30 billion) of debt and relies on state bailouts to remain solvent. It's battled to meet demand for electricity because most of its plants are old and have been poorly maintained. The utility started implementing rolling blackouts this week.\n\nThe central bank is assessing the risks Eskom poses to South Africa's economic growth and financial stability, Kganyago said.\n\nIf Eskom is unable to meet electricity demand - even at the current low rate of expansion in gross domestic product - it could become even more constrained if growth accelerates, he said.\n\nThat's why it\u2019s important that the Treasury paper talks about increasing generation capacity, he said.\n\nCentral bank stress tests have found Eskom's debt is distributed is a way that wouldn't pose a systemic risk to the financial system, he said.", "description": "Moody's has urged government to rein in spending, issued warnings over support for Eskom.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/18/42904a7ef75749b4afca54551eaac186_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
