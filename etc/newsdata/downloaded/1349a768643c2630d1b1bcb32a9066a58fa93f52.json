He\u2019s been cast to play the fairy godmother in the latest Cinderella movie.\n\nAccording to People, during a panel at the 20th New Yorker Festival that took place on Saturday, the 50-year-old confirmed that he would be playing the role in the upcoming live-action remake movie.\n\nThe film, which is set to be released in February 2021, will see singer Camila Cabello making her acting debut as Cinderella, as well as Frozen\u2019s Idina Menzel playing the role of Cinderella\u2019s evil stepmother.\n\nBilly is well-known for his character in the US drama series Pose, as well as for his fashion-forward red-carpet moments, that he told Vogue are an expression of himself.\n\n\"I grew up loving fashion, but there was a limit to the ways in which I could express myself. When you\u2019re black and you\u2019re gay, one\u2019s masculinity is in question. I dealt with a lot of homophobia in relation to my clothing choice,\" he explained.\n\n\"Now I\u2019m in a space where, being on Pose, I\u2019m invited to red carpets and I have something to say through clothes. My goal is to be a walking piece of political art every time I show up. To challenge expectations. What is masculinity? What does that mean? Women show up every day in pants, but the minute a man wears a dress, the seas part,\" he continued.\n\nTAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF HIS RED CARPET LOOKS\n\n(Sources: Vox, People, Elle, Vogue)", "description": "Actor Billy Porter is about to make history again after being cast to play the fairy godmother in the latest Cinderella movie.", "authors": ["Mahlohonolo Magadla"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9475/14051216afa647a790723f9f53d5d964.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
