(Courtesy of Sarah Doelp/Courtesy of Sarah Doelp)\n\nSarah Doelp shared with us how much she loves the bathroom in her 1953 Cape Cod-style home in Easton, Md. She spent about $8,000 on the renovation of her bathroom, including mold remediation, a new shower, removal of the tub, installation of tile flooring where the tub once stood and replacement of the toilet.\n\nI love my bathroom. It\u2019s found on the first floor of my 1953 Cape Cod in Easton that has been rehabbed many times since it was first lived in. My bathroom is no exception; it and the adjoining bedroom were once either the house\u2019s dining room or living room.\n\nNow it\u2019s ideal for me, a middle-aged woman who hopes to live here indefinitely and may not want to or be able to cope with stairs. My bathroom renovation earlier this year left intact the bathroom\u2019s original white oak floors and crown molding but removed an eyesore of a jetted tub that was never used. In its place on the floor I installed black-and-white hexagonal tiles, a timeless look, and the existing shower was redone with white subway tiles and the same black-and-white tiles. A new Toto toilet was installed, but a new vanity was not needed, as it had been replaced 10 years ago.\n\n[Why I love my home in South Bethany, Del.]\n\nNext, I moved many of my home\u2019s houseplants into the place once occupied by the tub to take advantage of a large south-facing window that provides ideal light conditions for plants. Many of the plants are different varieties of cactus, including a huge Christmas cactus, the centerpiece of the bathroom garden and a smaller cousin. A poinsettia from many Christmases ago now has a home here, as does an orchid, the lone survivor of once many.\n\nFour concrete hedgehogs found refuge here as well. After a while, a sort of greenhouse sanctuary emerged. The addition of Asian-inspired wall art enhanced it. I can\u2019t say that my bathroom is where I go to rest and relax, but while I am in there, it certainly provides a feeling of calm and peacefulness. And I love my bathroom.\n\nIn this new ongoing feature, we ask homeowners what they love most about their home.
