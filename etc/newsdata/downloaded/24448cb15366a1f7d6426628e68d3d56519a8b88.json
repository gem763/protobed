In fact, Defense Secretary Mark Esper admitted earlier today in Brussels, the Turks are making the situation in Syria exponentially worse. \u201cTurkey has put us all in a very terrible situation,\u201d Esper told a conference before a NATO summit, and is \u201cheading in the wrong direction\u201d:\n\n\u201cTurkey put us all in a very terrible situation,\u201d Esper told a conference in Brussels on Thursday before a meeting of NATO defense ministers. He said there are multiple crises in the Middle East and Turkey\u2019s \u201cunwarranted incursion into Syria\u201d to attack the Kurds risks sapping \u201cresources\u201d in the region. \u201cThere are new threats on the horizon that we ignore at our own peril,\u201d he added. Esper also said Turkey is \u201cheading in the wrong direction\u201d by carving out a \u201csafe zone\u201d in northern Syria and agreeing to a deal with Russia to jointly patrol the territory.\n\nJust how safe is the \u201csafe zone,\u201d and just where is it? The Kurdish SDF claimed that Turkey has yet to abide by the terms of the permanent cease-fire announced by Trump yesterday, for which Trump waived the remaining sanctions against Ankara. The SDF claims that Turkey has used mercenaries to advance along a three-pronged front against Kurdish communities, but Turkey insists those are areas the Kurds were supposed to evacuate:\n\nThe Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) accused Turkey on Thursday of launching a large land offensive targeting three villages in northeast Syria despite a truce, but Russia said a peace plan hammered out this week was going ahead smoothly. \u2026 But the SDF said in its statement on Thursday that Turkish forces had attacked three villages \u201coutside the area of the ceasefire process,\u201d forcing thousands of civilians to flee. \u201cDespite our forces\u2019 commitment to the ceasefire decision and the withdrawal of our forces from the entire ceasefire area, the Turkish state and the terrorist factions allied to it are still violating the ceasefire process,\u201d it said. \u201cOur forces are still clashing,\u201d it said, urging the United States to intervene to halt the renewed fighting.\n\nThe SDF warned on Twitter that they\u2019re not going to allow Turkey to attack their communities for long. After initially backing Trump yesterday, the militia now wants Trump to back them up by intervening with Recep Tayyip Erdogan:\n\nTurkish army have been attacking villages of Assadiya, Mishrafa and Manajer with a large number of mercenaries and all kinds of heavy weapons despite the truce. SDF will exercise its right to legitimate self defense and we are not responsible for the violation of the agreement. \u2014 Mustafa Bali (@mustefabali) October 24, 2019\n\nWe urge all parties and especially the US to monitor the implementation of the cease-fire agreement that they brokered and hold violators to account. \u2014 Mustafa Bali (@mustefabali) October 24, 2019\n\nThose pleas will not likely move the US to intervene, especially not militarily. As John Cornyn noted yesterday, there would have been little appetite in the US for a shooting war with Turkey over ethnic cleansing along its border, even if Erdogan had gone through the existing US \u201ctripwire\u201d troops at the time, so withdrawing those troops made sense, Cornyn concludes:\n\n\u201cIf Turkey was planning on coming into northern Syria and trying to ethnically cleanse the Kurds, and U.S. troops were caught in the middle, I am not completely convinced that it was a bad idea to get them out of harm\u2019s way,\u201d Cornyn said.\n\nTrump is also not likely to reverse himself so soon after his victory-lap presser yesterday to reimpose sanctions. The overall point of yesterday\u2019s announcement was that Trump was washing his hands of the Kurds and of their disputes with the Turks. Maybe Trump will reimpose sanctions if Turkey continues to violate the terms of the cease-fire, but only after enough time passes to where he can\u2019t be accused of being wrong yesterday.\n\nUnfortunately for the Kurds, they\u2019re on their own. And Turkey knows it.", "description": "\u201cTurkey put us all in a very terrible situation.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/esper.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
