It\u2019s the smallest world yet found with water in its surrounding atmosphere, and it\u2019s possible that it even rains liquid water there. That makes this world a tantalizing candidate in the ongoing search for extraterrestrial life outside our cosmic neighborhood.\n\nFinding water around an exoplanet (a world outside our Solar System) is particularly exciting for scientists because water is a critical ingredient for life on our planet. It could equally be pivotal for life that exists elsewhere in the Universe. Researchers have found this precious molecule around exoplanets before, but these worlds have not been suitable places for life to thrive. They\u2019ve been large balls of gas, similar in size to Jupiter or Neptune, lacking any kind of surface for life as we know it to exist.\n\n\u201cwe are demonstrating that there is actually liquid water.\u201d\n\nThis planet, detailed in a study that was published on arXiv and submitted to the Astronomical Journal and a study published in Nature Astronomy, is a bit more unique. Named K2-18b, it\u2019s nearly nine times as massive as our own Earth, a type of world often referred to as a mini-Neptune. Worlds of this size are plentiful in our Galaxy but lacking in our own Solar System. K2-18b also orbits in a sweet spot around its host star known as the habitable zone where temperatures are just right for water to pool on a planet\u2019s surface. That means this planet shares some very significant traits with our planet. \u201cFor the first time, a planet in this temperature regime \u2014 a regime that is very, very similar to the Earth \u2014 we are demonstrating that there is actually liquid water,\u201d Bj\u00f6rn Benneke, an exoplanet researcher at the University of Montreal and lead author on the study published in the arXiv, tells The Verge.\n\nWhile finding water is a big deal for exoplanet researchers, it\u2019s unlikely that this world is awash in oceans. In fact, it seems unlikely that the surface of the planet is rocky because of its size. \u201cThese planets are not going to look a thing like Earth,\u201d Sara Seager, an exoplanet expert and professor at MIT who was not involved in this research, tells The Verge. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not rocky as we know a rocky planet to be.\u201d K2-18b also orbits around a star very unlike our Sun. Altogether, these factors significantly decrease the chances that life could survive there.\n\nResearchers first found K2-18b, thanks to NASA\u2019s Kepler space telescope, a spacecraft located nearly 100 million miles from Earth that hunted for exoplanets for most of the last decade. Whenever an exoplanet passes directly between its parent star and Earth, it slightly dims the star\u2019s light, which is a minuscule change that Kepler could detect. By observing these transits, Kepler discovered more than 2,000 exoplanets. In 2015, the spacecraft caught K2-18b, which is located 111 light-years away from Earth.\n\nThen, in 2016 and 2017, Benneke and his team used NASA\u2019s Hubble Space Telescope, currently in orbit around Earth, to learn more about K2-18b\u2019s atmosphere. The chemicals and molecules that surround an exoplanet can tell us a lot about what might be lurking on the surface of the distant world. For instance, the significant amounts of methane in Earth\u2019s atmosphere are a byproduct of the many biological organisms that live here.\n\nStudying the atmosphere of an exoplanet is particularly tough for worlds that are similar in size to Earth. The light from these faraway space rocks is easily overpowered by the light coming from their parent stars, making them incredibly hard to see. And in order to figure out what\u2019s in an exoplanet\u2019s atmosphere, researchers need to observe light from the star as it filters through the \u201couter edges\u201d of the world. When the light passes through the gas, it gets warped ever so slightly, indicating the types of molecules that are present. It\u2019s an incredibly delicate \u2014 and challenging \u2014 measurement to make.\n\n\u201cImagine you have a search light in London, and you\u2019re observing it from New York,\u201d Ingo Waldmann, an astrophysicist at the University College London and one of the authors on the Nature Astronomy study, tells The Verge. \u201cAnd in that search light, you have a mosquito fly. That\u2019s the exoplanet. Now, what we\u2019re trying to do is we\u2019re trying to figure out what the color of the wings are.\u201d\n\nStudying the atmosphere of an exoplanet is particularly tough\n\nResearchers got lucky with K2-18b because it has an atmosphere that extends far out into space, making it a bit easier to observe. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like a hybrid planet that maybe has a rocky ice core, but then most of its volume is actually gas,\u201d Benneke says. Additionally, it orbits around a type of faint, small star known as a red dwarf, which doesn\u2019t have as much light as a star like our Sun. That makes it easier to study planets that might be orbiting nearby.\n\nBenneke and his team observed the planet as it transited eight times, allowing them to detect water vapor in the atmosphere. Then they did some climate modeling and found that the vapor is likely forming into clouds where water condenses and then raining down onto the planet \u2014 just like on Earth. \u201cIf you talk to any biologist, they don\u2019t care about vapor; they care about liquid water,\u201d says Benneke. \u201cBecause biology only works when you have liquid water.\u201d Waldmann\u2019s team at the University College London also analyzed the data gathered by Benneke and his team, confirming the existence of water vapor in the atmosphere, as well.\n\nStill, there\u2019s quite a lot we don\u2019t know about this planet, especially the composition of its surface. Seager notes that exoplanets that are presumed to be rocky like Earth, Venus, or Mars are typically less than 1.6 times the size of our planet. This one is 2.3 times the size of Earth, which means the surface is very likely not rocky. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a bit above that threshold,\u201d says Seager. Either it\u2019s a rocky core surrounded by a giant envelope of an atmosphere, or it\u2019s possible that half of it is made up of water ice. Either option is not very conducive to having oceans of water on a rocky ground like here on Earth. \u201cThese objects that are mini-Neptunes, they\u2019re extremely common, and we don\u2019t know what they are,\u201d says Seager.\n\nthe search is still on for the biggest get of all: a rocky exoplanet with water\n\nSo while today\u2019s findings are big, the search is still on for the biggest prize of all: a rocky exoplanet with water in its atmosphere. When that happens, it\u2019ll be a big day for the exoplanet community, producing the closest analog to Earth we\u2019ve found yet.\n\nThe next step is to learn more about what K2-18b looks like and what other gases might live in the planet\u2019s atmosphere. Scientists could get this information as more powerful telescopes come online in the years ahead. Notably, NASA\u2019s upcoming James Webb Space Telescope, which will be the most powerful observatory after it launches in 2021, could tell us more about the surface and atmosphere of K2-18b. The telescope will be able to study worlds that are smaller than K2-18b and more akin to our planet, in addition to mini-Neptunes and worlds orbiting in the habitable zones of their stars.\n\n\u201cThis is the first step toward really kind of exploring planets that are at the right temperature around other stars to see what\u2019s going on there,\u201d says Benneke. For now, we know that whatever is going on there is likely wet, but it might not be very lively.\n\nUpdate September 11th, 1PM ET: This article was updated to include information about a second study on the same topic.\n\nCorrection September 11th, 10:30AM: An original version of the article said a study was accepted for publication by the Astronomical Journal.
