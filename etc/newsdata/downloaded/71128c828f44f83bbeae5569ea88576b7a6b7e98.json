They have not been charged with a crime. Prosecutors are conducting their investigation under a court-ordered seal. (Amy Davis/Baltimore Sun)\n\nTeams of IRS agents, paralegals and Drug Enforcement Administration investigators have filtered through tens of thousands of law firm emails as prosecutors attempt to build a criminal case against two prominent Baltimore defense attorneys, Ken Ravenell and Joshua Treem.\n\nFederal agents raided the separate offices of the two lawyers in June. They copied 50,000 emails to and from Treem and have reviewed more than half of that cache by now, a federal prosecutor said. Investigators said they examined only emails directly connected to the two attorneys and the ongoing probe.\n\n\u201cThey have done more than 50 percent of the review of the documents under seal with a magistrate judge,\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Derek Hines told federal appeals judges Tuesday in Richmond.\n\nTuesday\u2019s hearing in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit brought a rare, public discussion of an ongoing criminal investigation into two of Baltimore\u2019s top defense attorneys. Ravenell works criminal cases. Treem handles white-collar crime and he represents Ravenell in this case.\n\nQuestions have swirled since federal agents raided their offices. Neither man has been charged with a crime, and federal prosecutors have continued their investigation under a court-ordered seal. Officials declined to discuss the matter.\n\nMeanwhile, Treem\u2019s law firm has challenged the email sweep. Its argument reached the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit in Richmond on Tuesday, bringing to light new details about the criminal investigation.\n\nIn his written argument, Hines, the prosecutor, told the judges that Ravenell was under investigation for \u201cassisting drug dealers [to] sell drugs, laundering the proceeds of drug dealers and then attempting to cover up their crimes by obstructing investigations.\u201d\n\nHines also wrote that the federal investigation into Ravenell was \u201cfrustrated by the obstructive conduct\u201d of Treem.\n\nProsecutors have not named Ravenell and Treem. They refer to the men as \u201cTarget Lawyer A\u201d and \u201cTarget Lawyer B\u201d in court records, and their names were never mentioned during Tuesday\u2019s hearing, only those identifiers. But the dates of the raids, descriptions of the lawyers and mention of a public statement issued by the law firm all point to Ravenell and Treem.\n\nTreem and Ravenell have not returned messages seeking comment about the allegations. Neither man appeared in court Tuesday.\n\nHines prosecutes corruption cases in Baltimore and was among the federal prosecutors who secured convictions of the rogue police officers of the city\u2019s Gun Trace Task Force. On Tuesday, he argued for continued review of the emails, telling the appeals judges that investigators suspect other people may be implicated.\n\n[Their job was to take guns off Baltimore streets. They admitted stealing drugs and cash instead.]\n\nAn attorney for Treem\u2019s firm urged the judges to end the review, saying the investigative teams are trampling on legal principles that shield communications between lawyers and their clients. Of more than 50,000 emails copied from Treem, only 116 came from Ravenell, the firm\u2019s attorney said. The raid netted thousands of emails to and from other clients, and the firm\u2019s attorneys argued the search and seizure was far too sweeping.\n\n\u201cThe whole concept of the attorney-client privilege is that you, the client, are willing to tell your lawyer your innermost secrets,\u201d James P. Ulwick told the judges. He represented Treem\u2019s firm of Brown, Goldstein & Levy. \u201cYou have to have that confidence that when you relay that information, it will be protected.\u201d\n\nA former federal prosecutor himself, Ulwick also asked the judges to order a lower court to sift through the emails and decide which should be released to prosecutors. The U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Baltimore had outsourced the review to teams in its Greenbelt office.\n\nHines has argued this separation provided sufficient protection. He said it\u2019s routine procedure within the U.S. Justice Department and a system of review that has been approved by a magistrate judge.\n\nU.S. Court of Appeals Judge Robert B. King pressed him. He noted the agents could be holding emails from, say, a client seeking legal advice when he didn\u2019t pay his taxes. King compared the review to agents emptying out the office of a tax lawyer.\n\n\u201cI would hate to think of the government hauling my file cabinet down to the IRS office,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing but the fox being in the hen house.\u201d\n\nThe panel of three judges did not decide immediately whether the federal agents may continue the review. The decision is expected in coming weeks.\n\nRavenell came under a cloud in 2014 when DEA and IRS agents raided his office at the firm of William H. \u201cBilly\u201d Murphy Jr. Ravenell left the firm shortly thereafter.\n\nThat raid has gone unexplained. Today, he handles some of Baltimore\u2019s most high-profile murder cases.\n\nLast month, he defended the West Baltimore man who killed 7-year-old Taylor Hayes by firing a shot into the car in which she was sitting. The gunman, Keon Gray, was found guilty of second-degree murder. Ravenell also is representing Phillip West in a murder trial next month. West is accused of shooting to death his pool game partner at the Blarney Stone Pub in Fells Point.\n\nTreem, also a veteran attorney, began his career as a federal prosecutor in Baltimore in the 1970s, according to his firm\u2019s website. He went on to defend high-profile clients including the Indianapolis Colts, who were sued after leaving Baltimore in 1984. Treem also defended the younger of the two D.C. snipers.\n\n\u2014 Baltimore Sun\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Neither of the attorneys at the center of the probe has been charged with a crime, and prosecutors are conducting their investigation under a court-ordered seal.", "authors": ["Tim Prudente", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/PJKswSFZAIu0TSjay_AHerXBRew=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4DRP4AWUVAI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
