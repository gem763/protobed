Apple TV+, Disney+ streaming launches add to overload", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE Streaming services challenge network TV this fall AP\n\nQuick test: Ask yourself how many subscriptions you\u2019re on the hook for.\n\nHard to blame you for failing to come up with a number, or for feeling overwhelmed at the mere prospect of trying.\n\nLet's see. There\u2019s TV or internet for shows, music services such as Spotify and Apple Music, maybe some newspapers or magazines. Don\u2019t forget the cloud storage where you keep all those precious photos and videos, and that identity theft protection you need because of all of the data breaches, holes and hacks.\n\nOverwhelmed yet? We're not done.\n\nThere are the meal kits and razor blades delivered to your doorstep to make life easier. Then there\u2019s wardrobe you swap out and have delivered on a regular basis through Rent the Runway. Maybe that extends to your ride, a car subscription that lets you drive your vehicle of choice.\n\nReese Witherspoon, Jennifer Aniston, and Steve Carell will star in Apple's The Morning Show . (Photo: Apple)\n\nThat\u2019s not even counting the apps, cellphone service, online genealogy, home security monitoring, audio and e-books, ink cartridges, videogame catalogs and that health-tracking service you forgot about that you pay for each month. Then there are those expired free 30-day trials you've long forgotten about still an unseen part of your world.\n\nFeeling oversubscribed? Or maybe over being subscribed. Subscription fatigue is on the verge of reaching epidemic proportions.\n\nWhat's more, the trend toward getting you to sign up is getting more intense when it comes to streaming media. The spectrum of apps and services, including Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, HBO, Showtime and YouTube, is about to get even more crowded with the advent of Apple TV+, HBO Max (from AT&T), Peacock (from Comcast/NBCUniversal) and Disney+.\n\nStreaming wars: Netflix says it will retain the streaming crown; not worried about Disney Plus and Apple TV Plus\n\nThere are more than 300 \u201cover-the-top\u201d video services streamed over the Internet, says Deloitte vice chairman Kevin Westcott, who leads the company\u2019s U.S. telecommunication, media and entertainment practice.\n\nThe average household subscribes to three.\n\n\u201cThat tells you we definitely have a problem,\u201d he says.\n\nWhy do we subscribe?\n\nAs we transitioned to this sharing economy, we\u2019ve seen \u201cthat globally, people have become more inclined to say that they want subscription-based services rather than to outright own something,\u201d says Virna Sekuj, strategic insights manager with the GlobalWebIndex market research firm.\n\nSekuj says one of the motivators to the subscription or membership model is the upfront cost, especially driven by millennials who grew up with tech and during the Great Recession. \"It's given people access to things that they may normally not have been able to do.\"\n\nNetflix offers \"Stranger Things.\" (Photo: Netflix)\n\nHow many subscriptions are too many?\n\n\u201cThings are getting absurd,\u201d behavior analyst Sean McCoy tweets in response to a USA TODAY question on the topic. Though he\u2019s had subscriptions for years to multiplayer online role-playing games, he says, \u201cmy wife and I just took inventory and weeded (out) anything we didn\u2019t really need.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m fairly used to subscriptions from years of MMORPG gaming, but things are getting absurd. My wife and I just took inventory and weeded our anything we didn\u2019t really need. \u2014 Sean McCoy (@srmccoy) October 11, 2019\n\nThe impulse to subscribe to a video service may be largely built around the idea of convenience. That's the promise anyway. The basis of the old cable model was that all this content was aggregated in one place, and your TV subscription is very likely bundled with broadband in the home.\n\n\u201cIf only there were one service that could bring me all the content in one easy box. Oh wait, it's called cable, and it's been around for 40 years,\u201d says Andy Gibs a Northern New Jersey father of two.\n\nComcast's Xfinity X1 video platform. (Photo: Comcast)\n\nDana Strong, president of Comcast\u2019s Xfinity Consumer Services, says the company\u2019s X1 platform was created in part to help reduce the friction consumers may experience in leaving one video app for another or leaving linear TV for on-demand programming.\n\n\u201cHaving the ability to elevate the content out of the app into an integrated search engine and user interface makes the content discovery that much easier, particularly when you connect it with a voice remote,\" she says.\n\nIf you\u2019re a cord-cutter looking to ditch cable, your motivation may have more to do with saving money \u2013 why pay extra loot to the cable guys for hundreds of channels you never watch? But there are no guarantees you\u2019ll come out ahead financially.\n\n\"My husband insisted on cutting the cable and switching to multiple streaming services,\" Deb McAlister Holland wrote on Facebook. \"I can\u2019t articulate how much I hate it. Terrible user interfaces. Half a dozen separate sets of preferences to update. Annual fees. Monthly fees. Delays of days, weeks, or months before TV shows are available.\"\n\nBy 69% to 65%, streaming video has edged ahead of traditional pay TV, according to a recent Deloitte survey of more than 2,000 U.S. consumers. But it\u2019s not an either/or proposition; 43% of U.S. consumers have both.\n\nWhere to go to watch\n\nConsumers may feel compelled to sign up for multiple video subscriptions because this or that service is the only place to go watch some program all their friends are telling them to binge on.\n\nAccess to original programming created by the service \u2013 think Amazon and Netflix \u2013 was cited as a chief benefit for 55% of more than 23,000 U.S. internet subscribers ages 16 to 64 surveyed in April by GlobalWebIndex. More than half also cited being able to watch across multiple devices.\n\nJennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon star in the new Apple TV+ series \"The Morning Show.\" (Photo: Apple)\n\nThat\u2019s what Apple will bank on when it launches shows around such stars as Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon as part of Apple TV+. It\u2019s another play by the company to attract and keep customers within its ecosystem.\n\nUnfortunately, as shows are spread out across numerous services, chasing content may take a lot more effort on consumers' part and cost more than they counted on. Just ask a frustrated parent lamenting the fact that Disney pulled its content off Netflix in favor of its own soon-to-launch Disney+ service.\n\nAs a consumer, \u201cyou want to pick an ecosystem that\u2019s neutral,\u201d says Dave Shull, the new CEO of TiVo, the struggling DVR pioneer that is attempting to reinvent itself while trying to help viewers navigate content chaos. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting to me the last couple of weeks to watch Disney+ and Netflix starting to fight. The benefit and promise of TiVo is I am never going to be a content provider. Those guys have much bigger pockets than we do, and they\u2019ll fight it out.\u201d\n\nFor many consumers, it may be a challenge just getting a handle on what they already pay for, maybe a \u201ctrial\u201d subscription to some app or product they signed up for years ago and simply forgot about? If the bill automatically renews online, customers don\u2019t get that monthly statement in the mail to remind them.\n\nYou probably pay more for subscriptions than you think.\n\nAn analysis last year by the WestMonroe consulting firm of 2,500 Americans\u2019 budgets, spanning 21 categories of subscription services, found that 84% of people underestimated what they spent each month. The average person forked over about $237 for the categories in the study.\n\nBootstrap Media managing director Gene DeRose describes the problem of subscription fatigue as a feeling of complete bewilderment. \u201cWe\u2019re all more than ever innocent victims of the blood wars between big tech players, who could easily enable all of these systems to more elegantly talk to each other but refrain from doing so because they're wired to keep all the bricks in place in their respective walled gardens, lest they lose leverage.\u201d\n\nConsumers may gain back a bit of leverage by sharing subscriptions. Eighty percent of the respondents in the GlobalWebIndex survey share a TV/movie streaming subscription with at least one other person; half of those share a premium music plan.\n\nThe complexity that comes with subscription overload may introduce another problem: \u201cIt's not as much subscription fatigue as it is password fatigue,\u201d says Jeff Dorgay, publisher of ToneAudio.\n\nWhere to go to cancel\n\nThe most prudent remedy for consumers is to take the time to figure out which services they are paying for. The first place to start is credit card statements. Do a bit of digging to see which recurring charges are attached to your smartphone and other Android or iOS devices.\n\nFor Android users, start in the Google Play store and sign into your Google Account. Tap Menu, Subscriptions and choose the subscriptions you want to wave bye-bye to. Follow the instructions from there.\n\nTo get started on an iPhone or iPad, go to Settings, tap your name, then choose the subscriptions on your potential hit list.\n\nYou can always follow the path McCoy and his wife took. Reach out to every service you rarely, if ever, use and utter three simple words: \u201cCancel my subscription.\u201d\n\nConsumers, have you had enough?
