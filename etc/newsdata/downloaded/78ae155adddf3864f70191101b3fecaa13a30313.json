He never answers my calls. Is there a way to know is someone blocked your number?\n\nA: There is no technology that will tell you for sure about a blocked number. Instead, you\u2019ll have to check for certain clues. Does you call go directly to voicemail? Are you calls never answered? Do you receive an automated response, indicating that \u201cthis caller isn\u2019t available\u201d? These are all strong signs that your number has been permanently deflected. Tap or click here to knock if someone blocked your number.\n\nApple Malware Check\n\nQ: I tapped the wrong thing and I think my iPad is infected. How can I check my iPad for malware?\n\nA: The biggest danger of owning Apple products is the false sense of security. Over the years, millions of Mac addicts have accepted the myth that their devices can\u2019t contract malware. But your iPad is absolutely at risk. The most obvious signal is an annoying pop-up ad that claims you have malware. Mysterious messages and unexpected activity in your accounts may also point to malware or a breached interface. You may be able to tackle this problem pretty easily, but you should act soon.

Is it possible to make a call anonymously?\n\nA: You can block your number, and there are several different ways to do it. The easiest method is *69, which is a temporary solution, and you\u2019ll have to enter these digits every time you dial a number. But it\u2019s simple and free, and the phrase \u201cPrivate Number\u201d will show up on caller ID. On an iPhone, you can actually switch off your number completely, depending on your carrier. Keep in mind that many companies will be suspicious of any unlisted number, especially in the era of robocalls, when many businesses are bombarded with anonymous spam.

How does Netflix compare to Hulu and Disney and Amazon? Help!\n\nA: Yes, there are. The arrival of Disney+ and Apple+ will add thousands of hours of digital entertainment to an already glutted market, and it\u2019s hard to tell who will survive in the coming years. Usually, new formats like this obey the \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d rule, but it\u2019s still so hard to tell which streaming services are \u201cfittest.\u201d I recommend checking out my handy chart, which illustrates the benefits and drawbacks of each platform and lays them out side-by-side. You may still find yourself playing \u201cstreaming roulette,\u201d but at least there won\u2019t be any big surprises.

What\u2019s the right way to clean your dirty phone?\n\nA: You may be referring to those jugs of rubbing alcohol you find at the pharmacy. My advice is: no. What you need is a tech-ready cleaning solution, such as mobile screen wipes, which are specifically designed for phones. Many users wouldn\u2019t think to remove their phone cases and clear out the many ports, but if you want your phone to last, all of these components should be decontaminated on a regular basis. Cleaning products are very affordable and last for a long time. As we start our descent into flu season, you\u2019ll be grateful that you gave your gadget a little extra care.
