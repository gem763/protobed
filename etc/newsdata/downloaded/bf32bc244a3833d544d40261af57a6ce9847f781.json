REUTERS/Neil Hall/File Photo\n\nIn an echo of Pearson\u2019s past profit warnings, the world\u2019s biggest education company said on Thursday that while 75% of its sales continued to grow, U.S. higher education courseware revenue was set to fall as much as 12% in 2019.\n\nThis compared with a forecast 5% drop from the British education company, which has cut 16,000 jobs and restructured over six years to sell textbooks and courseware online, after a rapid move to digital sales sparked repeated profit warnings.\n\n\u201cWe thought that textbook sales would be down 10% this year, it looks like now they\u2019re going to be down 20%,\u201d Chief Executive John Fallon told reporters. \u201cThat is painful for this year\u2019s guidance but what it means is we\u2019re just getting to the future state of this business more quickly.\u201d\n\nSuch is the rate of the decline that Fallon said he would wait to see how the business performed before he set the 2020 outlook. In February Pearson forecast a return to sales growth for the first time in more than five years.\n\n\u201cWe need to take a step back and make sure we know what is going on,\u201d said Fallon.\n\nThe update would reignite speculation about Fallon\u2019s future, analyst Neil Campling at Mirabaud Securities said in a note, adding it was likely to create a \u2018red mist\u2019 among shareholders.\n\nAdjusted operating profit is now forecast at the bottom of Pearson\u2019s guidance range of 590 million pounds ($728 million) to 640 million pounds.\n\nSTEADY RECOVERY\n\nThursday\u2019s announcement brings a halt to the steady recovery Pearson had been making, helped by years of cost cuts.\n\nAlthough a setback, \u201cit doesn\u2019t change our view of where we want the company to be, and how we get there,\u201d Fallon said.\n\nThe former owner of The Economist magazine and the Financial Times newspaper, has invested in new digital programmes to counter students in the United States buying more books second hand and using cheaper digital products.\n\nFinance director Coram Williams said Pearson had seen a \u201cvery significant industry wide\u201d acceleration in print attrition as retailers and students turned away from print products more quickly than expected.\n\n\u201cSome of this volume has ended up in the secondary market, and some of it will have meant that students don\u2019t buy a print component at all,\u201d he said.\n\nThe division was also hurt by delivery issues, a sales force reorganisation and changes to some courses that affected what products students bought.\n\nAnalysts at Citi said the warning was likely to stoke the markets\u2019 existing concerns about the structural challenges.\n\nFor the first nine months of the year, Pearson expects underlying revenue to be broadly flat with its core markets up 5%, growth markets up 3% and North America down 3%.\n\nThe group said it was still on track to deliver more than 330 million pounds in annualised cost savings, with the full benefits accruing from the end of 2019 onwards. It forecast year-end net debt to be broadly in line with 2018.\n\n($1 = 0.8097 pounds)", "description": "Pearson warned that a 20% drop in demand for U.S. college textbooks would hit its profit and jeopardise a return to sales growth next year, triggering an 18% share price fall.", "authors": ["Kate Holton", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434166377&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P18T", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
