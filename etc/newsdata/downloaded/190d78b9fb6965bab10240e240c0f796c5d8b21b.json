If he can continue like that, he can be on the top. At the moment there are no limits for him.'\n\nGabriel Jesus should have added another for City soon after Sterling's strike but was denied by a brilliant goal-line clearance from Tyrone Mings.\n\nThe second eventually came in the 65th minute and was anything but clear-cut. After a long VAR stoppage, Kevin De Bruyne's free-kick was ruled to have curled straight in despite an apparent touch from Silva.\n\nHad Silva been deemed to have touched it at this point, the goal may well have been disallowed because Sterling was in an offside position and interfering with the goalkeeper.\n\nSterling has now bagged seven goals and one assist across nine Premier League appearances\n\nManchester City bounced back after their last league game at home, a 2-0 defeat to Wolves\n\nAfter the game, however, it was a different matter. The goal accreditation panel - a separate entity from VAR - concluded that Silva did get a touch and duly credited him with the goal.\n\nThere was little debate about the third as Gundogan smashed home and Jesus went close again when he hit the crossbar late on.\n\nGundogan said: 'We could have scored in the first half but (we were) not clinical enough and maybe a bit slow and sloppy.\n\n'We responded well in the second half and it was a good win. Sometimes it's about patience. That's a different quality, being able to wait for the right moment and not lose your nerve.'\n\nSterling and Gundogan are playing in their fourth season alongside each other at the Etihad\n\nThe only downside for City was the late sending off of Fernandinho for a second yellow card. The Brazilian midfielder had been playing in defence recently as cover for injuries and Gundogan does not fancy that role during his suspension.\n\n'Not really, to be honest!' he said. 'It's a position I don't feel really comfortable with but if needed it's a position I will play.'\n\nDespite the result, Villa acquitted themselves well and felt there was plenty to take from the defeat.\n\nManager Dean Smith said: 'We'll take an awful lot of lessons from the way they play - the way they press you, they've got great compactness, great cohesion, they use the space behind you really well.\n\n'We'll take that video home, watch how Man City do things and try to learn from that good practice.'", "description": "Germany midfielder Ilkay Gundogan praised his Manchester City team-mate Raheem Sterling after they both scored in the champions' 3-0 Premier League win over Aston Villa on Saturday.", "authors": ["Andy Hampson", "Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/11/20240800-0-image-a-46_1572175893974.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
