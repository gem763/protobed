Prone to bouts of irrepressible, screeching laughter, his is a predicament best described by Steve Buscemi in Con Air: \u201cA font of misplaced rage. Name your clich\u00e9: Mother held him too much or not enough, last picked at kickball, late-night sneaky uncle, whatever. Now he\u2019s so angry moments of levity actually cause him pain; gives him headaches. Happiness, for that gentleman, hurts.\u201d When Fleck\u2019s meds and therapy run dry, owing to austerity measures in Gotham, the bullied, mentally ill loner gets a gun and exacts his revenge.\n\nFollowing its Venice Film Festival premiere, critics were quick to draw parallels between Fleck and the rash of involuntary celibates\u2014or \u201cincels\u201d\u2014responsible for so many recent mass shootings. Vanity Fair drew a line between the Joker and real-life \u201cangry loners\u201d who \u201cshoot up schools and concerts and churches, who gun down the women and men they covet and envy, who let loose some spirit of anarchic animus upon the world,\u201d arguing that it \u201cmay be irresponsible propaganda for the very men it pathologizes\u201d; while The Hollywood Reporter\u2019s Scott Feinberg wrote that the film was \u201cdeeply disturbing and, I fear, could incite real-world problems.\u201d\n\nThe notion that Joker could inspire a real-world shooter is not only downright Trumpian, but has little basis in scientific fact. Psychologists have been studying the link between violent media and real-world violence for decades, and the results have been inconclusive. In a June 2017 memo, however, the American Psychological Association (APA) cautioned media outlets against claiming that violent media influences real-world criminal acts.\n\n\u201cPublic officials, news media, and scholarly organizations (such as APA) would do well to focus on scientifically valid substantive causes of violence ranging from poverty to mental health issues to educational and social disparities. Focusing on video games or other media can distract from real causes of violence and do harm,\u201d the memo read. \u201cNews media would benefit from remembering that discovering a young male perpetrator of a crime also happened to play violent video games or watch violent movies is not remarkable given the commonness of such media use among young males. Such disclosures should not be treated as significant or as causes.\u201d\n\nThe irresponsible media discourse surrounding Joker has led distributor Warner Bros. to tighten security at its Los Angeles and New York premieres, and bears some similarities to the exaggerated coverage of the 2012 shooting in Aurora, Colorado, which saw a young man enter a midnight showing of The Dark Knight Rises and gun down twelve people. An initial report from ABC News, quoting then New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly, alleged that the shooter, whose hair was dyed red, had called himself \u201cThe Joker.\u201d Then The New York Times made matters worse, reporting that, \u201cWitnesses told the police that Mr. Holmes said something to the effect of \u2018I am the Joker,\u2019 according to a federal law enforcement official, and that his hair had been dyed or he was wearing a wig.\u201d And thus, a myth was born.\n\nBut those reports turned out to be false. As the Denver Post later concluded, \u201cInvestigators heard no witness talking about the Joker\u2026And no police officer claimed [the shooter] called himself the Joker.\u201d If that weren\u2019t enough, the shooter himself confessed to a psychiatrist that he did not dye his hair red to emulate the Joker (whose hair is green, by the way), but that he did so because \u201cred suggests bravery.\u201d Because of the rampant media speculation, though, the shooter\u2019s inmates did eventually take to calling him \u201cThe Joker,\u201d to which the shooter remarked, \u201cThey kind of turned me into a supervillain.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it had been The Avengers, he would have been there. If it were Jurassic World, he would have been there,\u201d George Brauchler, the district attorney who prosecuted the case, told the Denver Post. \u201cIt had nothing to do that we can find with Batman.\u201d\n\n\u201c If it had been The Avengers, he would have been there. If it were Jurassic World, he would have been there. It had nothing to do that we can find with Batman. \u201d\n\nPerhaps there\u2019s something about the Joker that causes the media\u2019s collective imagination to go into overdrive. Over a decade on, outlets are still attributing the death of Heath Ledger to the mental toll playing The Dark Knight\u2019s Joker took on him. According to the late actor\u2019s sisters, Ashleigh Bell and Kate Ledger, that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.\n\n\u201cI was really shocked, because that was him having fun,\u201d Kate Ledger said of Heath\u2019s Joker turn at a panel last year for the documentary I Am Heath Ledger. \u201cIt was coming out that he was depressed and it was taking a toll, and we were going, \u2018What?\u2019\u201d added Bell.\n\n\u201cHonestly it was the absolute opposite. He had an amazing sense of humor, and I guess only his close family and friends really knew that. But he was having fun. He wasn\u2019t depressed about The Joker,\u201d Ledger maintained.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, the AP pressed Joker director Todd Phillips about how people might be \u201cscared\u201d going into his film because of the Aurora shooting.\n\n\u201cAurora is obviously a horrible, horrible situation, but even that is not something you blame on the movie. And quite frankly, if you do your own research about Aurora, that gentleman was not even going in as Joker\u2014that was misreported,\u201d Phillips responded. \u201cThe one that bugs me more is the \u2018toxic white male thing\u2019 when you go, well, I just saw John Wick 3, he\u2019s a white male, he kills three hundred people and everybody\u2019s hooting and hollering. Why does this movie get held to different standards? It honestly doesn\u2019t make sense to me.\u201d", "description": "Critics have argued that the supervillain saga \u201cJoker\u201d could inspire real-world violence.
