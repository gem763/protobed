Bernie Sanders speaks to supporters in Rochester, Minn., during the 2016 presidential campaign. (Brian Snyder/Reuters)\n\nSuddenly, his political radicalism is eclipsed entirely by his whiteness and maleness.\n\nI\u2019m old enough to remember a time when an independent secular Jewish socialist with a long record of support for Communist regimes would be considered a force for diversity in a typical field of Democratic candidates. Think back to years past, when the likes of Walter Mondale, Gary Hart, Dick Gephardt, Al Gore, and other white men vied for the Democratic presidential nomination. If you threw a Bernie Sanders into that mix, you might have been forgiven for saying, \u201cOne of these is not like the others.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot anymore.\n\nSanders, the aforementioned socialist who never saw a Communist junta he didn\u2019t like, announced he\u2019s running for president again.\n\nIn an interview with Vermont Public Radio (of course), Sanders was asked how he would compete in such a diverse field.\n\n\u201cWe have got to look at candidates, you know, not by the color of their skin, not by their sexual orientation or their gender and not by their age,\u201d Sanders replied. \u201cI mean, I think we have got to try to move us toward a non-discriminatory society which looks at people based on their abilities, based on what they stand for.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe reaction from many quarters of the liberal establishment was fit for a Tom Wolfe novel. The LGBT magazine Out ran the sardonic headline, \u201cBernie Sanders Bravely Asks Us to Consider a Straight President.\u201d Neera Tanden, the head of the Center for American Progress, sneered, \u201cAt a time where folks feel under attack because of who they are, saying race or gender or sexual orientation or identity doesn\u2019t matter is not off, it\u2019s simply wrong.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStephen Colbert, a middle-aged white guy whose TV show is a mandatory stop in the Democratic primaries, did a Sanders impersonation, saying, \u201cYes, like Dr. King, I have a dream \u2014 a dream where this diverse nation can come together and be led by an old white guy.\u201d\n\nThis is amazing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor generations there\u2019s been a schism on the left between those who argue that class and economic equality should be the dominant prism for social and political reformers and those who say that race and identity should be the primary consideration. It can be traced back to the rich, fascinating history of American socialists and Communists taking the lead on civil rights in the 1930s and 1940s, when mainstream parties turned a blind eye to Jim Crow.\n\nIt\u2019s a complicated story, but it\u2019s worth acknowledging both the real moral leadership on these questions by many on the left and the fact that much of it was driven by the useful idiocy of American leftists who bought into Soviet and Marxist propaganda. The great socialist intellectual Sidney Hook once praised the Soviet Union for its \u201cprogressive elimination of national, cultural and racial hostilities among its heterogeneous peoples,\u201d which had been achieved through \u201cvoluntary participation in a socialist economy\u201d and \u201cnot by suppressing national units or indigenous cultures.\u201d He later recognized that this was nonsense.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRegardless, the idea of colorblindness \u2014 now considered code for \u201cwhite supremacy\u201d by many liberals \u2014 has a rich and noble pedigree on the American left, most famously articulated by Martin Luther King Jr. in his speech at the March on Washington, which Sanders attended.\n\nBut suddenly, Sanders\u2019s political radicalism is eclipsed entirely by his whiteness and maleness. This is partly because so much of the Democratic party has adopted his policy positions that he no longer stands out the way he did just two years ago. Still, it\u2019s a remarkable change, made all the more remarkable because it\u2019s mostly an elite liberal phenomenon.\n\nThere\u2019s little evidence that average Democrats, including minorities, care as much about the demands of wokeness as the liberal talking heads on TV claim. For instance, a majority of African-American Virginians do not want Governor Ralph Northam (of blackface infamy) to resign.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the face of the new, socialist, ethnically diverse Democratic party, owes her upset election not so much to allegedly socialism-craving people of color but to more-affluent white liberals. As Politico\u2019s David Freedlander noted, Joseph Crowley, the old white male Ocasio-Cortez defeated in the primary, did quite well with blacks and Latinos, whom Crowley had served ably for years, while Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s best margins came from \u201chighly educated, whiter and richer\u201d precincts that could afford to virtue-signal at the ballot box.\n\nIf that pattern holds, the forces of class over identity may not be as defeated as it once seemed.\n\n\u00a9 2019 Tribune Content Agency LLC.\n\nSomething to Consider If you enjoyed this article, we have a proposition for you: Join NRPLUS.
