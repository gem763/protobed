(Photo: Jessica Phelps/The Advocate)\n\nWESTERVILLE, Ohio \u2014 On a sunny day in uptown Westerville, you can find a microcosm of the nation's politics among those sipping their coffee or walking their dogs down the flower-lined street.\n\nA man washing the windows of a shop's Halloween display grew up as a Democrat but plans to vote for President Donald Trump again. A young, enthusiastic supporter of tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang is waiting for a friend outside a local coffee shop. Two friends are walking to lunch, wondering whether former Vice President Joe Biden's remarks are too \"flubberly.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, this Columbus suburb of about 40,000 residents will host the fourth Democratic Party presidential debate. Twelve candidates will take the stage at Otterbein University, a private liberal arts college of 3,000 students where former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a frequent Trump critic, has an office.\n\nWesterville is a swing city in a swing state.\n\nWhile Ohio selected former President Barack Obama twice, Westerville voters picked the GOP contenders in 2008 and 2012. But when Trump won Ohio by 8 percentage points in 2016, Westerville voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton instead.\n\nAnd in 2018, while Republicans rolled in most statewide races including governor, voters in Columbus' northern suburbs ousted Republicans in favor of Democratic newcomers in statehouse races. A similar scenario played out in suburbs outside Cincinnati, Cleveland and Akron.\n\nThat shift represents a crack in the Republican stronghold that is suburban America. As Democrats secure votes in cities' urban cores and Republicans increasingly appeal to rural voters, the suburbs might be the last remaining political battleground.\n\nOn stage: 12 candidates, one night: Here's who has made the October debate\n\nMeet me in the middle\n\nWesterville resident, Don Foster, shares his thoughts of the upcoming democratic debate being hosted in Westerville at Otterbein University. Foster who (Photo: Jessica Phelps/The Advocate)\n\nDon Foster, of Westerville, is the kind of voter that Democrats are salivating over: a moderate suburban-dweller who picked Trump in 2016 but has no plans to do so again.\n\n\u201cI feel guilty about it, having voted for Trump,\" said Foster, meeting friends outside Espresso Air for lunch, as he does most days. \"I won\u2019t vote for him again. He\u2019s too toxic. He\u2019s not an example for kids.\u201d\n\nBut the only Democrat Foster says he likes is Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who barely made the debate. His current plan is to sit this election out: \"I'm not voting for president.\"\n\nFoster said he worries about gun violence, especially after the Aug. 4 mass shooting in Dayton, an hour-and-a-half away from where the debate will be held. Mary Jane Pletcher, of Westerville, and her friend Kathy Campbell, of nearby Gahanna, said that access to affordable healthcare is a top concern. For Micah Crockett, of Blacklick, the economy and his spiritual beliefs inform his vote.\n\nKathy Campbell of Gahanna and Mary Jane Pletcher of Westerville are both excited about the upcoming debates being held in Westerville. Both tried to get tickets to watch them live at Otterbein University. (Photo: Jessica Phelps/The Advocate)\n\nNo one mentioned the impeachment probe of the president. No one talked about the Green New Deal. No one demanded Medicare for All.\n\nThese suburban voters are less partisan, more moderate and historically Republican, said Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper.\n\nPepper said that means Democrats need to tread lightly: \"The fact is they could shift again if you run in a way that could chase them off.\"\n\nThe list: Who is running for president in 2020? An interactive guide\n\nPerhaps that's why Democrats are labeling every Republican from Trump to Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine as out of touch and too far right. Earlier this year, DeWine signed one of the nation's most restrictive bans on abortion, prohibiting the procedure as early as six weeks gestation.\n\nMeanwhile, Ohio's Republicans are painting all Democrats as socialists who will eliminate hamburgers and commercial air travel.\n\n\"I would certainly argue that the Democrats are going much further left than we are going to the right,\" said Rob Secaur, executive director of the Ohio Republican Party.\n\nIn the suburbs, Trump's economy is the pitch. Secaur said low unemployment and fewer business regulations appeal to voters there.\n\nThat's one reason why Crockett, who was washing windows, says he'll vote for Trump again. His business has improved since the Republican president's election, making him question the decision to hold the debate in Westerville.\n\n\u201cWhy would you come to a business town and hold a Democratic debate?\" he asked.\n\nLoading...\n\nShifting tides\n\nThe battle over the nation's suburbs is nothing new. One Ohio Republican diagnosed it well nearly 70 years ago.\n\n\u201cThe Democratic Party will never win another national election until it solves the problem of the suburbs,\u201d said then-Sen. Robert Taft following President Dwight D. Eisenhower's victory.\n\nDemocratic President Bill Clinton disproved Taft's theory in the 1990s, but the premise still rings true. Democrats can no longer rely on populous cities alone to carry elections in many states.\n\nA man reads inside Java Central in downtown Westerville. Westerville and Otterbein University are playing host to the upcoming democratic debates. (Photo: Jessica Phelps/The Advocate)\n\nAnd Democrats have steadily lost support in rural areas over the past several decades. Democratic President Jimmy Carter received 24 percent of his support from rural residents in 1980. By 2016, only 9 percent of Hillary Clinton voters lived outside metropolitan America, wrote Boston College's David A. Hopkins in a paper titled \"The Suburbanization of the Democratic Party.\"\n\n\"For the first time in American history, the Democratic Party now draws most of its popular support from the suburbs,\" Hopkins wrote.\n\nThat makes suburban voters, especially those surrounding America's most populous cities, that much more important for Democrats. The migration of minorities and millennials to the suburbs has helped those areas more competitive.\n\n\"They aren\u2019t quite as Republican as they have been traditionally,\" Secaur said of suburban voters. And that's something the GOP took for granted in 2018.\n\n\"There was a bit of complacency on our end,\" Secaur said.\n\nNow, Republicans are working with candidates in suburban Columbus and Cincinnati, hoping to win local races in 2019 while collecting voter contacts for Trump's re-election bid in 2020.\n\nState Rep. Jessica E. Miranda (D-Forest Park). (Photo: Provided)\n\n\"The suburbs are in play in a more important way than they ever have been,\" said state Rep. Jessica Miranda, D-Forest Park, who won her suburban Cincinnati race by 56 votes in 2018.\n\nThe key to winning these suburban races, Miranda said, is focusing on better schools, affordable healthcare and safer neighborhoods.\n\n\"I don\u2019t think people care about the scandals of the day or all the infighting,\" she said.\n\nElaine Clarke, manager of Schneider's Bakery in Westerville shares how the business is preparing for the upcoming democratic debate being hosted in Westerville at Otterbein University. Foster who (Photo: Jessica Phelps/The Advocate)\n\nEven as Democrats mount an impeachment probe and Trump refuses to take part, Elaine Clarke, manager of the 65-year-old Schneider's Bakery in uptown Westerville, is trying to keep the tone light and fun rather than divisive and serious.\n\nThe shop is making t-shirts that read: \u201cThe only debate in town: one dozen or two?\u201d They might create a ballot for customers to vote on their favorite doughnut. (The most popular, according to Clarke: vanilla cream-filled with chocolate on top or pumpkin. She likes the apple fritter.)\n\nAre they ready for the national circus that is a presidential debate?\n\n\"Yeah,\" Clarke said. \"Bring it on. We\u2019ll sell everybody doughnuts that wants doughnuts.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/10/11/democrats-look-suburbs-like-debate-host-westerville-2020-wins/3931774002/", "description": "Democrats will hold their next presidential debate in an Ohio suburb.
