(AP) \u2014 It was supposed to be a prime-time showdown between the Green Bay Packers and Kansas City Chiefs, division leaders each led by two of the most talented and exciting quarterbacks in the NFL.\n\nAaron Rodgers and the Packers lived up to the billing.\n\nPatrick Mahomes never got the chance.\n\nRodgers threw for 305 yards and three touchdowns, two of them to Aaron Jones on a big night for the Green Bay running back, and the Packers held off fill-in quarterback Matt Moore and the rest of the banged-up Chiefs for a 31-24 victory Sunday night.\n\n\"I totally trust our quarterback,\" Packers coach Matt LaFleur said, \"and I trust Aaron Jones as a receiver. He made some great plays all night long.\"\n\nJones, who briefly left with a shoulder injury, had seven catches for 159 yards and added 67 on the ground \u2014 a big chunk of them in the closing minutes, when the Packers (7-1) sealed their first win at Arrowhead Stadium since Nov. 4, 2007.\n\n\"He's very talented,\" Rodgers said, \"and I think this scheme is giving him the opportunity to do a lot more out of the backfield. You know, we're splitting him out and throwing the ball to him. We kind of caught lightning in a bottle there a couple of times. Hit him on a slant-and-go for 50 and on a screen pass for 70 or whatever. He's a talented guy. I'm very proud of him.\"\n\nThe Chiefs (5-3) hoped Mahomes could make a miraculous recovery 10 days after dislocating his kneecap in Denver in time to play. But after the league MVP was limited all week in practice, coach Andy Reid announced Friday his franchise quarterback would be inactive for the game.\n\nMoore took the reins of the high-powered offense and fared well, throwing for 267 yards with two touchdowns and no picks in the ex-high school coach's first start in more than two years.\n\nIt wasn't the Rodgers-Mahomes matchup everyone wanted, but Moore and Co. made sure it was still an entertaining game between teams with Super Bowl aspirations.\n\nIt started like most outside the walls of 1 Arrowhead Drive expected, with Rodgers slicing up the defense and Green Bay marching for two quick touchdowns.\n\nBut after a shaky start by Moore, the journeyman quarterback found a groove. He led the Chiefs on an 89-yard drive that ended with a make-it-rain 29-yard touchdown pass to Travis Kelce, then found Mecole Hardman on a 30-yard pitch-and-catch to knot the game.\n\nThe Chiefs led 17-14 at halftime, raising some eyebrows across the league.\n\n\"Once we got in the flow,\" Moore said, \"we were kind of rolling for a little while.\"\n\nLaFleur made a couple adjustments, though, and Rodgers and Co. began to move the ball once more. They used a 15-play drive that soaked up more than half the third quarter to get a tying field goal, then got the ball back when LeSean McCoy fumbled on the very next play.\n\nFive players later, Rodgers conjured up more of his magic.\n\nWith third down at the 3, he dropped back and was flushed from the pocket. He rolled to his right and threw a blind pass to the back corner of the end zone, where Damien Williams somehow took the ball away from Chiefs linebacker Ben Niemann while tapping both feet inbounds.\n\nRodgers was lying flat on his back, staring at the sky, as the official signaled touchdown.\n\n\"I truly believe he was throwing it away,\" Chiefs safety Tyrann Mathieu said.\n\nThe Chiefs answered with another long drive, and just when it appeared they had finally been stopped, the Packers' Tramon Williams was flagged for illegal use of hands. That gave Kansas City the ball inside the 5, and Damien Williams scored on the next play to tie it again.\n\nIt took the Packers all of 56 seconds to score the eventual winner.\n\nRodgers again found Jones out of the backfield, and this time he found a lane through the entire Kansas City secondary. It was a foot race from there, and the speedy running back hop-skipped over the goal line to finish off the 67-yard touchdown reception.\n\n\"He's an explosive weapon,\" LaFleur said. \"You don't find too many running backs that can go out there and produce like that. You don't see many running backs that you can put them on the outside and run a slant-and-go. I think he's dynamic as a runner, a receiver, a pass protector.\"\n\nThe Chiefs were forced to punt on the ensuing possession and never got the ball back.\n\n\"We played hard and aggressive,\" Reid said, \"but you know? When two good teams play each other, sometimes a turnover here or there can affect you and that's a little bit what happened tonight. But we can all do better, starting with me and my guys.\"\n\nHALL OF FAME\n\nThe Chiefs honored TE Tony Gonzalez and SS/FB Johnny Robinson, their new entrants into the Hall of Fame, during a halftime ceremony. Both were presented with their Hall of Fame rings.\n\nTHE WORM TURNS\n\nJones twice reached the end zone thinking he'd scored, dropped to the turf and did \"the worm.\" The first was negated by a penalty, though he scored a few minutes later anyway. The second came on a 60-yard reception in which a replay showed Jones had stepped out of bounds at the 10.\n\nSTAR SEARCH\n\nAlong with Mahomes, the Chiefs missed five other starters: DE Frank Clark (neck), CB Kendall Fuller (thumb), LT Eric Fisher (groin), LG Andrew Wylie (ankle) and DT Chris Jones (groin).\n\nPackers WR Davante Adams (toe) went through pregame warmups before he was scratched. But they did have LB Blake Martinez (hand) and SS Darnell Savage (ankle), who had missed the last two games.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nGreen Bay continues its AFC West trip against the Chargers next Sunday.\n\nKansas City plays another NFC North team in the Vikings next Sunday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
