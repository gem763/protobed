I believe the RBA is on the low side at 5 per cent.\n\n\"I've met one Middle Eastern central bank and their endgame in the next 10 years is to be 75 per cent exposed to the renminbi through time.\"\n\nWhile the inclusion into major indices is a longer term tailwind for China's bond market, the massive rally in developed market bonds \u2013 which has pushed yields to very low or even negative levels \u2013 will also attract the interest of yield-hungry investors.\n\nChina's 10-year bond yields around 3.1 per cent compared to 1.58 per cent and 0.88 per cent for the US and Australia respectively.\n\nMr Briscoe said investors who were hesitant to buy into China's bond market needed to be \"researching and understanding\", because everything they own will be re-weighted in the process.\n\n\"What are global asset managers going to do when they're allocating and looking at Australia, which is 0.5 per cent of the index? They can say 'I'm going to buy Chinese bonds which are yielding 3.1 per cent, so why am I wasting my time?'\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBuying into Chinese bonds means closely watching Beijing's policymakers at a time when they are trying to de-risk the economy after a substantial rise in debt, and navigate towards a slower, yet more sustainable pace of growth.\n\nMr Briscoe dismissed the idea that Chinese policymaking was a blackbox.\n\n\"There are three things I look at when it comes to China macro: politics, politics, politics.\n\n\"They are very explicit with their policy actions. I think where people misinterpret that is the policy action today shows up with a lag of six to nine months in official statistics,\" he said.\n\nHe argues that Chinese policymakers are focused on three Ls: an L-shaped recovery (not the stop-go growth of old), a longer business cycle (six to 10 years), and longer term quality growth.\n\nThe focus on lower, yet more sustainable growth, was linked to a more restrained use of credit.\n\nThe People's Bank of China is targeting credit growth equal to inflation and real gross domestic product. China's credit impulse had emerged as an important driver of activity, especially at a time of sluggish growth in advanced economies and limited monetary policy ammunition among western central banks.\n\n\"The PBoC has been the single most important central bank. I care less and less about the Fed now.\n\n\"If there's a global slowdown, do not expect China to save the world again,\" he said, referring to Beijing's focus on ensuring credit growth is strong enough to maintain growth, but not add risk to the economy.", "description": "Hayden Briscoe, head of Asia Pacific fixed income at UBS Asset Management, says the growth in China's bond market will require a radical rethink of asset allocation.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1902%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d4b4013b346836e284f93b48cef09d18d4b14c23", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
