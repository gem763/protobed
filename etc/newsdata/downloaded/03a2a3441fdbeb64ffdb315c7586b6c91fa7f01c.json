It\u2019s a difficult decision to make,\u201d Pelosi told several hundred party faithful gathered in an Atlantic City casino ballroom for the New Jersey Democratic State Committee\u2018s convention. \u201cBut we have that obligation because the actions that were taken undermine the constitution and the oath we take to protect and defend, including the oath that the president takes.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nNew Jersey Democrats had fortuitous timing in lining up Pelosi to headline their convention. They announced her appearance in late August \u2014 weeks before the whistleblower complaint surfaced about Trump\u2019s phone call with the Ukrainian president and his request for him to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.\n\nThose actions led Pelosi to endorse an impeachment inquiry into the president\u2019s actions.\n\nPelosi said the Founding Fathers \u201cwould never have thought that anyone would be so abusive of the system.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe times have found us all. Not that we place ourselves in the same category of greatness of our founders, but we do place ourselves in the time of urgency to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States,\u201d she said.\n\nPelosi\u2019s speech capped a two-day convention by a Democratic Party that dominates New Jersey politics, but has been riven by constant battles between Gov. Phil Murphy, the party\u2019s progressive base and public sector unions on one side and Senate President Steve Sweeney, South Jersey Democratic power broker George Norcross and their allies in the state Legislature on other.\n\nNevertheless, Democratic State Committee spokesperson Phil Swibinski said about 2,300 people attended the convention at Harrah\u2019s Resort Atlantic City. But while Sweeney skipped the event, there was some South Jersey Democratic presence. Rep. Donald Norcross, the brother of George Norcross, was present Friday and participated in a panel discussion.\n\nMurphy and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) spoke before Pelosi.\n\nBooker, who\u2019s struggling to gain traction for his presidential campaign but was greeted enthusiastically by his home-state and home-party crowd, warned that \u201cwe cannot allow moral vandalism from the highest office in our lands.\u201d\n\nAnd Murphy, noting Trump\u2019s past casino troubles in Atlantic City, said New Jersey \u201chad our fill of Trump before America did.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe saw that he couldn\u2019t cut it in Atlantic City,\u201d Murphy said.\n\nDemocrats also congratulated themselves for victories in last year\u2019s congressional elections, when they flipped four Republican-held House seats, securing an 11-1 majority in the delegation.\n\n\u201c[Pelosi] is here today because of you,\u201d Rep. Albio Sires told fellow Democrats during a panel discussion. \u201cWe\u2019ve got 11 members out of the 12 in New Jersey.\u201d", "description": "Pelosi said the Founding Fathers \u201cwould never have thought that anyone would be so abusive of the system.\u201d", "authors": ["Matt Friedman"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/cf/f4/907a79364b6295009bc874cf558a/gettyimages-1177449149.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
