REUTERS/Beawiharta\n\nThe Corruption Eradication Commission, known by its Indonesian initials, KPK, has prosecuted hundreds of politicians and officials since its formation in 2002, becoming one of the country\u2019s most respected agencies.\n\nBut there have been repeated efforts by politicians and police to undermine it.\n\nParliament passed a motion last week to debate amendments to the 2002 law that created the agency, leading to Tuesday\u2019s revisions that will place it under the oversight of an external board. The board\u2019s main power will be to authorize wiretaps.\n\nMember of parliament Johnny G. Plate dismissed criticism of the changes, saying all state agencies needed oversight.\n\n\u201cWe want to establish a supervisory board to make the KPK\u2019s management more prudent and accountable,\u201d Plate told Reuters.\n\n\u201cThere is no state institution in the world that does not have supervisory board, without checks and balances.\u201d\n\nBut the reforms have alarmed anti-corruption activists, who fear they are meant to weaken the agency.\n\nProtesters gathered in front of parliament before Tuesday\u2019s vote, some holding signs bemoaning the KPK\u2019s \u201cfuneral\u201d.\n\nMany of the KPK\u2019s investigations have involved members of parliament. A former speaker of the house is among those who have been convicted of graft.\n\nPresident Joko Widodo, who has 30 days to sign the law, has defended the changes and stressed that he would not compromise in the fight against graft.\n\nWidodo declared in a televised address last week that an external board was necessary for \u201cgood governance\u201d, though he said he would pick the members and they would include researchers and anti-corruption activists, not politicians or bureaucrats.\n\nUnder the changes, the agency\u2019s independent investigators will become civil servants. Activists fear that could make them more vulnerable to pressure.", "description": "Indonesia's parliament voted unanimously on Tuesday to approve changes to a law governing the country's anti-graft agency, which activists fear could undermine its powers to tackle corruption.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430730728&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G0EH", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
