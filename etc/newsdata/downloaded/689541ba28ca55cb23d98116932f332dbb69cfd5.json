That means if you take the time to look, there are some pretty sweet deals out there. What\u2019s more, the types of rewards you can earn has expanded too, with more perks tailored to match American\u2019s new digital spending habits.\n\nIf you have a card and haven\u2019t shopped around in a while, you could be surprised at just how generous rewards have become \u2014 especially since lean times in the wake of the financial crisis. \u201cThe average introductory bonus on travel rewards cards more than doubled\u201d since the start of decade, says Brian Karimzad, co-founder of MagnifyMoney.com.\n\nIllustration by Tim Boelaars More\n\nThe spending categories that help you earn top rewards are also evolving.

Now, cards like the Wells Fargo Propel American Express and the Uber Visa cards are expanding what counts as travel-related to include home- and ride-sharing. It\u2019s happening in dining too. A growing number of cards give enhanced rewards for pickup or takeout orders as well as meals eaten out.\n\n\u201cOpening up the definition of dining to takeout, opening up the definition of taxi expenses to rideshares and transit \u2014 they\u2019re really trying to capture the millennial,\u201d Karimzad says. \u201cWith millennials, it\u2019s more about doing things on demand.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s best credit cards also recognize the increasingly digital, mobile lives their customers have, with cellphone protection cropping up as a new benefit in cards across a host of categories. And although Apple made news earlier this year with the introduction of the Apple Card, it isn\u2019t the only issuer incentivizing digital purchases. A number of rewards cards now offer accelerated rewards earning for purchases of streaming media services or subscriptions, online purchases or digital wallet usage.\n\nThe Wells Fargo Cash Wise Visa offers a higher rewards rate for digital wallet purchases made in the first year, and Apple is going all in with extra rewards for Apple App Store and Apple Wallet purchases, for instance. The Amazon Business Prime American Express offers accelerated rewards not just for purchases on Amazon.com, but also on AWS, Amazon Web Services, the company\u2019s cloud-based services division.\n\n\u201cCredit card companies are trying to reach the next generation and every generation has a change in habits,\u201d Karimzad says. \u201cSame strategy, different preferences.\u201d", "description": "Cash back, travel, no-annual fee and more.", "authors": ["Martha C.
