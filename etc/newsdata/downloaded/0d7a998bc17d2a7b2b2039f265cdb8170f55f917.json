She said allowing the mayor to remove books goes against freedom of expression and the free exchange of ideas.\n\nA lower court sided with Crivella. But chief justice Jos\u00e9 Dias Toffoli ruled in favor of Dodge on Sunday, blocking the mayor from removing any books. Crivella\u2019s office said he will appeal to the full court.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A Brazilian Supreme Court justice has blocked efforts by Rio de Janeiro's conservative mayor to have a book fair remove a comic book showing two men kissing.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
