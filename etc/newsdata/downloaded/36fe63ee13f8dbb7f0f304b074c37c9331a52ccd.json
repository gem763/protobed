I do with Guendouzi \u2013 he\u2019s one of the few who shows he wants to win every game. He\u2019s got a lion\u2019s heart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Matteo Guendouzi is relied upon a lot by Emery, and that\u2019s because he\u2019s showing anger on the pitch. He hates to lose games, you can see that he\u2019s ready to fight for every single ball. He plays to his strengths and he does that well.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s more than you can say for some of the other midfielders. Can anyone tell me what is Xhaka\u2019s best quality? I don\u2019t know why he has been made captain. The leadership is absent.\u2019\n\nEmery opted to name a midfield three consisting of Xhaka, Guendouzi and Joe Willock against Sheffield United while there was no place again for Mesut Ozil in the matchday squad.\n\nIt was another decision that left Petit puzzled and the Frenchman again aimed a dig at Xhaka by suggesting that he and the other players selected were incapable of creating chances that Ozil or Dani Ceballos could have.\n\n\u2018What\u2019s going on with Mesut Ozil?\u2019 he added. \u2018Emery said last week that Mesut Ozil was ready to play. Yet he didn\u2019t even make the bench. That left Arsenal without any quality to bring on. The players Emery picked to start in Sheffield \u2013 honestly, come on!\n\n\u2018Were there really no other options? What about Dani Ceballos? He\u2019s one of the few Arsenal players who can create something with his passing. I don\u2019t want to focus on Granit Xhaka all the time but, well, show me something else!\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement", "description": "Emmanuel Petit criticises Granit Xhaka's leadership qualities and questions why Unai Emery appointed him as Arsenal captain this season.", "authors": ["Metro Sport Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1182263113_1571839395.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
