I\u2019m in New York and Doele is in Germany. Doele and his company, HoloMeeting, think this is the future of work.\n\nRemote working is booming\n\nThe world is quickly moving towards mobile and remote work. 43 percent of the US labor force worked remotely in 2016, according to the 2017 Gallup \u201cState of the American Workplace.\u201d Further, one-third of those surveyed reported spending more than 80 percent of their time working remotely. This number is only expected to grow. This move to mobile and remote work has been heralded as a tool to increase productivity, save money, end to the end to the rural brain drain, but we haven\u2019t worked all of the kinks out yet. While overall productivity increases, collaboration, and interaction with co-workers decreases which can potentially lead to social isolation, decreased creativity, decreased probability of promotion and raises, and more.\n\nCollaborating in mixed reality\n\nJust as the last generation of technologies \u2014 everything from a high-speed broadband internet and video conferencing to instant messaging and project management tools \u2014 have all made remote work feasible by increasing communication speed, the next generation of tools will have to simulate the collaboration and co-worker interactions of the traditional workplace.\n\nGerman Startup HoloMeeting is taking aim at fixing this problem. HoloMeeting has developed software for Microsoft HoloLens that lets teams collaborate and interact remotely in mixed reality.\n\nSo what is HoloMeeting?\n\nHoloMeeting allows companies to hold meetings in a shared holographic workspace. Within this workspace, participants can share 3D and 2D content. Everything that is shared in the workplace becomes visible to everyone else in the meeting.\n\nParticipants also interact with each other differently. If a person decides to walk around the shared workspace, their avatar \u2014 a disembodied version of their head and shoulders \u2014 moves as well. Such movements are not just visible to the user, but also to the other participants.\n\nThe Holomeeting team made intentional design choices to mimic the office environment. For example, there is no mute button, \u201cI can\u2019t mute you in an in-person meeting, so I shouldn\u2019t be able to in an online meeting,\u201d says Doele.\n\nEverybody joins through a virtual lobby \u2014 the place to have a virtual water cooler conversation \u2014 and people can pop into your virtual \u2018room\u2019 whenever they want, to also facilitate those serendipitous workplace conversations that only happen when co-workers show up unannounced.\n\nDoes it work?\n\nTruth be told, the technology doesn\u2019t quite mimic an in-person interaction; a frozen, disembodied head and shoulders are not the same as an animated human with facial expressions and body language. But it does seem to be a step in the right direction and one that major companies are interested in.\n\nBut, Doele admits, large-scale adoption is yet to come. \u201cRight now, one or two companies have bought over 1000 devices, but most clients just pilot implementations of 20 to 30 devices.\u201d\n\nThis is mostly because the HoloLens is a very expensive device (~$3000 a pop) and has a steep learning curve. \u201cThe HoloLens is a lot less intuitive than, say, a cell phone. There is no comparable thing. So for broader HoloLens adoption, we need more education. Currently, we are in the \u2018Why do I need a mobile phone when I have a landline at home?\u2019 stage, says Doele.\n\nFurther, the technology is still developing. Later this year, the second generation of HoloLens is launched. This update requires a whole new version of the HoloMeeting app. Likely, the technology will be greatly improved because it will expand the HoloLens field of view. Also. instead of just hand-tracking the back of your palm, like the current HoloLens, HoloLens 2 will track 20 individual points on your hand allowing for real hand movement.\n\nDoele believes it will take up to 3 to 5 years \u2014 after Apple launches its first mixed reality device \u2014 that this type of mixed reality remote work will become mainstream. Currently, such an Apple device is no more than a rumor so we may have to wait even longer.\n\nYet, despite the early nature of this technology, Doele is convinced that it is a critical tool for making remote work the norm. He ended our interview by describing his vision for a remote future, saying that \u201cIf we can make remote work more accessible, this will allow workers to be more flexible. If you have young kids, for example, that\u2019s very important.\u201d\n\nWorking remotely will change urban planning as well, he believes. \u201cThere will be less need for office space, meaning people could actually live in the city centers again.\n\nWhether he is right about HoloMeeting remains to seem, but it\u2019s certain that remote work is on its way to dramatically change the way that we work.\n\nBy combining a passion for people with the power of today\u2019s intelligent machines, Randstad supports people and organizations in realizing their true potential.
