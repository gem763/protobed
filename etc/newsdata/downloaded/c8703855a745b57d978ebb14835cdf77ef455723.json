If the festival was a brainy step above what remained of the summer-stock circuit, offering the Greeks and Chekhov instead of \u201cArsenic and Old Lace\u201d and \u201cMame,\u201d it was hardly a theatrical hotbed except in the sense of older celebrities seeking humid flings with young wannabes.\n\nIn fact, from the time of its founding in 1954 through 1980, when I made my glorious debut flipping French toast for all-night crews turning over the stage from one show to another, the festival never sent a full production to Broadway. (Its first would be A.R. Gurney\u2019s \u201cSweet Sue,\u201d in 1987 .) Not many wound up Off Broadway, either. The ethos in that tucked-away corner of northwestern Massachusetts was less about success than safety; it was a place to experiment fearlessly, ringed by mountains 160 miles from Times Square.", "description": "Seven of this season\u2019s Broadway and Off Broadway shows come from an eight-week theatrical powerhouse in Williamstown, Mass.", "authors": ["Jesse Green"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/15/arts/15new-green_brianstauffer-jpg/15new-green_brianstauffer-jpg-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
