It won\u2019t.", "language": "en", "text": "But no matter what the governing coalition will look like, the right has still won this election.\n\nAmerican Jewish organizations have largely remained silent for now, as there is still no obvious winner, but they clearly welcome Netanyahu\u2019s exit. Some headlines are already declaring that American Jews won this election. An Israeli government without Netanyahu in charge could provide a fig leaf for American Jews to breathe a sigh of relief, assure themselves that Israel is a vibrant democracy and go back to hoping for peace while avoiding confrontation with Israel\u2019s apartheid-like one-state reality \u2014 which was there before Netanyahu, and will be there after him.\n\nThe end of the Netanyahu era won\u2019t mean the end of Israeli settlements or occupation by any means. As Haaretz\u2019s Noa Landau wrote, Israelis who voted for Blue and White, which got only two seats more than Likud, want \u201cthe nicer right-wing in power.\u201d Nevertheless, as 972 Magazine\u2019s Haggai Matar pointed out, Netanyahu\u2019s apparent demise is still a reason to rejoice, as it would expel from power the man who has made racism and incitement against Palestinian citizens, human rights organizations, journalists and the judiciary his defining quality.\n\nAmerican Jews, who are largely pluralist and liberal and who favor a two-state solution, have watched as Netanyahu pushed Israel into an explicitly anti-democratic, anti-Arab, illiberal place; they watched as he became Trump\u2019s biggest ally and fan on the globe, disregarding his normalization of anti-Semitism and remaining silent after Trump called most Jews \u201cdisloyal.\u201d It has become increasingly easy for American Jews to criticize Israeli policies under Netanyahu and distance themselves from the country. The percentage of American Jews who agreed that \u201ccaring about Israel is a very important part of my being a Jew\u201d dropped from 70 percent in 2018 to 62 percent this year, according to a survey on Jewish public opinion in the U.S. commissioned by the American Jewish Committee. The percentage believing that \u201cIsrael should be willing to dismantle all the settlements\u201d as part of a peace agreement with the Palestinians jumped from 15 percent last year to 25 percent this year.\n\nOn Election Day, Netanyahu not only reached the zenith of his demonization of Palestinian citizens (and the democratic process) by saying it was a threat that Palestinians were exercising their right to vote, he also broke several election laws by giving interviews to the media that day, among other violations. (That\u2019s unrelated to the hearing on a potential indictment on three charges of bribery and fraud that he faces in two weeks). Organizations like the American Jewish Committee, the Democratic Majority for Israel and AIPAC spent Tuesday tweeting in praise of Israel\u2019s \u201cfree and fair\u201d elections and boasting it is the only democracy in the Middle East. At one point, the Democratic Majority for Israel even condemned Netanyahu, tweeting that his \u201cattempt to brand Israel\u2019s Arab citizens as enemies is repugnant.\u201d AJC staff member Seffi Kogen went so far as to call a retweet by Netanyahu\u2019s son Yair of a photo purporting to show high Arab turnout in Israel (but revealed to be a photo from Istanbul) \u201cracist.\u201d By now, it\u2019s a no-brainer for liberal American Jews to call out Netanyahu, just as it\u2019s a no brainer to call out Trump.\n\nAnti-Semitism doesn't bother Netanyahu if it comes from his political allies\n\nFor the last 10 years, Netanyahu has epitomized the crisis in liberal Zionism, wherein Jews are expected to \u201ccheck their liberalism at Zionism\u2019s door,\u201d as Peter Beinart wrote nearly a decade ago about the American Jewish establishment. The question is, without Netanyahu to blame anymore, will U.S. Jews \u2014 and the Democratic Party so many of them support \u2014 still feel compelled to criticize Israel, take steps to hold it accountable and push to end its military control over millions of Palestinians? The election results don\u2019t make that seem so likely.\n\nLike the more than one million Israelis who voted for Blue and White, many American Jews are looking to Benny Gantz to \u201csave\u201d Israel and get it back on track. But Blue and White\u2019s platform on matters of national security and Palestinians is virtually identical to Likud\u2019s \u2014 which makes sense, considering many of its members defected from Netanyahu\u2019s party in response to his corruption charges and their push to end the Orthodox monopoly over civil issues like marriage and military conscription. Gantz campaigned on sending Gaza \u201cback to the Stone Age\u201d; he has called for maintaining a \u201cunited\u201d Jerusalem and has notably not endorsed a Palestinian state or a two-state solution, such that his willingness to enter negotiations with Palestinians is thus far nothing but lip service; and after Netanyahu promised to annex the Jordan Valley, Gantz claimed the prime minister stole that idea from him. There is only one issue on which Gantz is significantly different from Netanyahu: religious pluralism, which is one of the most important issues for American Jews, on which they are more willing to be unequivocally vocal about than on Israel\u2019s continued human rights violations.\n\nAfter the Pittsburgh shooting, Israeli politicians sounded even more like Trump\n\nGantz and his partner Yair Lapid campaigned on an anti-religious platform that promises a secular government without the ultra-Orthodox parties. Netanyahu, who has tied his fate to support from ultra-Orthodox parties, canceled a decision in 2017 to allow for a pluralistic prayer section at the Western Wall, while Gantz has promised to honor it. As Rick Jacobs, president of the Union of Reform Judaism, the largest Jewish organization in North America, told Haaretz Thursday, the prospect of a secular unity government is very exciting for Americans: \u201cThe previous government caused enormous harm and made it more difficult for lovers and supporters of Israel to promote our important relationship. We will be happy to work with the next government to put things on a better track \u2014 and a unity government would be best situated to do that.\u201d\n\nIn that sense, Gantz is the perfect leader for many mainstream American Jews: He represents a strong liberal Zionist military persona, who champions secularism and pays lip service to peace while continuing policies that undermine it. He\u2019s like the 2009 version of Netanyahu. Such a figure allows liberal American Jews to gloss over the reality on the ground: that \u2014 with or without Netanyahu \u2014 de facto Israeli annexation of large parts of the West Bank and a de facto single state, dominated, apartheid-like, by what is rapidly becoming a Jewish minority, has become a consensus position in contemporary Israel. At the end of the day American Jews, like many Israelis, must realize that the future there isn\u2019t about whether Netanyahu is a tyrant. It\u2019s about whether the majority of Israelis are.", "description": "The crisis in liberal Zionism isn\u2019t going away, no matter who winds up as Israel\u2019s next prime minister.", "authors": ["Mairav Zonszein", "Mairav Zonszein Is An Israeli-American Freelance Journalist."], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AWLQNWG2VII6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
