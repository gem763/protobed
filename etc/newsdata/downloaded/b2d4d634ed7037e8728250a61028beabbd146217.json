No wonder Gore Vidal had so many enemies...\n\nGore Vidal was entitled to claim that he was the wittiest and most elegant writer of his time. And claim it he often did. For modesty was not his principal virtue. Indeed, it was one of the reasons he made so many enemies.\n\n\n\nAsked why he excited so much antagonism, Vidal always explained that he was one of the few people in the world who spoke in perfect sentences \u2014 a talent which particularly infuriated literary rivals, whom he said were lucid only on paper.\n\n\n\nHe made that point during a TV debate with fellow writer Norman Mailer (who he had once likened to cult killer Charles Manson) and Mailer responded by head-butting him. Without blinking, Vidal observed: \u2018As you might expect, Mailer as usual was lost for words.\u2019\n\n\n\nOpinionated: This 1974 photo shows Vidal during an interview in Los Angeles during which he discussed Hollywood unions, politics, lecturing and publicising books\n\nVidal, who died on Tuesday aged 86, became famous thanks to his wit. But he was more than an aphorist \u2014 he was a serious writer of great distinction: an essayist, critic, satirist, actor and occasional amateur politician.\n\n\n\nIn everything he turned his hand to, Vidal caused elegant, exquisitely phrased controversy. However, despite his literary success, his money and his looks, he never seemed satisfied with the way fate had treated him. Asked about his occasionally wistful air, he spoke about \u2018divine discontent\u2019.\n\n\n\nVidal\u2019s writings are saturated with a sense that the world, and in particular the United States, were in terminal decline. The great age of empire was over, and America, he believed, had abandoned itself to the \u2018cult of stupidity\u2019. He said: \u2018The genius of our ruling class is that it has kept a majority of the people from ever questioning the inequity of a system where most people drudge along, paying heavy taxes for which they get nothing in return.\u2019\n\n\n\nThe Vidals were American aristocracy. His father, Gene, was director of air commerce in Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s administration and was said to be the handsomest man in Washington society. He was also a serial adulterer.\n\n\n\nVidal's mother, Nina, was an alcoholic and, at her worst, suicidal. His parents\u2019 marriage collapsed and Vidal, their only child, was sent to live with his maternal grandfather, Thomas Gore, Democratic Senator for Oklahoma. The Senator was blind. Vidal recalled: \u2018When he discovered a grandchild with a passion for reading, I became his favourite.\u2019\n\n\n\nEnemies: William F Buckley, Jr., conservative government gadfly and author, interviews Vidal. Vidal once called Buckley as a 'crypto Nazi' on television\n\nPolitically charged: Vidal greets then-President elect John F Kennedy in December 1960; he was good friends with Jacqueline Kennedy\n\nHis grandfather asked Vidal to read aloud to him \u2014 a task the boy rebelled against. \u2018After several hours of reading the Congressional Record, I got bored. I was the only eight-year-old authority on bi-metalism (the economic monetary system based on the price of gold and silver).\u2019\n\n\n\nThe precocious Vidal was educated at Exeter College \u2014 one of the top undergraduate \u2018schools\u2019 of New England. But, for reasons he never explained, he did not go on to Harvard, Yale or Princeton with other members of his social class.\n\n\n\nHe then served during World War II as a warrant officer (junior grade) \u2014 mostly in the Aleutian Islands of the Northern Pacific Ocean as helmsman on a supply ship.\n\n\n\nFor a man of his background, a commission would normally have been a formality. Although he claimed his bad eyesight was to blame for keeping him in the ranks, it was his homosexuality (discovered while still at school) that undoubtedly was equally responsible for his prolonged stay on the lower deck.\n\n\n\nVidal was always open about being what he called a \u2018fag\u2019 \u2014 even at a time when homosexuality risked instant ostracism.\n\n\n\nIn 1946, the year after he left the U.S. Navy, Vidal wrote Williwaw \u2014 a war novel which brought him instant acclaim. This success, though, was short-lived because his third book (The City And The Pillar, whose subject was homosexual life in New York) received a hostile reaction.\n\n\n\nThe senior book reviewer of the New York Times vowed \u2018never to read him again after experiencing this disgusting book\u2019.\n\n\n\nJohn F. Kennedy and Gore Vidal: Despite his literary success, Vidal never seemed satisfied with the way fate had treated him\n\nVidal spent ten years in exile from New York, some of it in Guatemala, and wrote TV and film scripts and short stories under the name of Edgar Box. He lived in Paris and Florida and his name appeared as a scriptwriter in the credits of several movies such as Ben-Hur.\n\n\n\nDuring this period he befriended the playwright Tennessee Williams, who let him adapt his work Suddenly Last Summer for the screen.\n\n\n\nVidal enjoyed this Hollywood period but he was, by nature, a writer. As soon as American publishers were prepared to risk the wrath of the New York Times, he felt able to return to the written word.\n\nThe result, Myra Breckinridge, \u2018the story of a character who is apparently a woman, but who turns out to be a man\u2019, was a literary sensation.\n\n\n\nThroughout these \u2018golden years\u2019 in the Forties and Fifties, Vidal lived the sybaritic life of American high society \u2014 securing invitations to the best dinner parties.\n\n\n\nThere followed a series of novels about the early years of the American Republic. They reflected his view that the Founding Fathers had created a model of democracy that later American presidents had destroyed with their autocratic power.\n\n\n\nTalent: Gore Vidal was a serious writer of great distinction: an essayist, critic and satirist\n\nIn 1960 \u2014 choosing, for a change, to participate rather than philosophise \u2014 he stood in New York as a Democratic nominee for the House of Representatives. He lost, but won more votes in his congressional district than John F. Kennedy, the presidential candidate.\n\n\n\nVidal had a family link to the Kennedys. After his parents\u2019 divorce in 1935, his father married the stepmother of JFK\u2019s future wife, Jackie. This made Gore Vidal her half-brother, once-removed.\n\n\n\nVidal was, however, defiantly unimpressed by his association with America\u2019s first family. He said JFK was \u2018one of our worst presidents\u2019, his brother Bobby was \u2018a phoney\u2019 and their father, Joseph, was \u2018a crook\u2019 who \u2018should have been in jail\u2019 and who had \u2018bought\u2019 the presidency for his son.\n\n\n\nHe described the Kennedy family\u2019s ascent as an \u2018ardent struggle ever upward from the Irish bog\u2019 and with tragic foresight he called the job of the presidency \u2018literally killing\u2019 and worried that \u2018Kennedy may very well not survive\u2019.\n\n\n\nNor was he charitable about Jackie Kennedy, who he claimed \u2018lost her virginity in a lift to a writer from the Paris Review\u2019. For her part, she complained that Vidal had always made her feel \u2018like a Philistine\u2019.\n\nHappily, he made other enemies \u2014 considering Ernest Hemingway a joke and comparing Truman Capote to a \u2018filthy animal that has found its way into the house\u2019.\n\n\n\nVidal had an old-fashioned belief in honour, albeit combined with a modern will to live as he pleased. He wrote in his memoir that he\u2019d had more than 1,000 \u2018sexual encounters\u2019. Also, he was fond of drink and claimed that he had sampled every major drug.\n\n\n\nThroughout his adult life (for more than 50 years), Vidal lived with Howard Austen, a sometime singer and advertising executive. He insisted that they observed his rule of life that \u2018sex drives more couples apart than it holds together\u2019 by not sleeping with one another.\n\n\n\nIndulgences: Gore Vidal, pictured here in 2009, was fond of drink and claimed that he had sampled every major drug\n\nWhatever their physical relationship, Austen behaved like a domesticated wife and looked after Vidal.\n\nFor 25 years, they lived together in the Italian village of Ravello and returned to America (which he described as \u2018the land of the dull and the home of the literal\u2019) only in 2003, so that Austen could be treated for cancer. However, he died later that year.\n\n\n\nVidal continued to produce acerbic and pessimistic essays as well as his fiction. He was a constant critic of U.S. foreign policy and the attempts of successive presidents to impose the standards of the West on developing countries.\n\n\n\nHe also predicted that the U.S. would eventually be subservient to China \u2014 \u2018The Yellow Man\u2019s Burden\u2019.\n\n\n\nBut he remained an essentially American figure. In his final years, saddened by the death of peers and close friends, he still raged about the world and mused about what he had called that \u2018divine discontent\u2019.\n\n", "description": "ROY HATTERSLEY: Gore Vidal was entitled to claim that he was the wittiest and most elegant writer of his time.
