Department lawyers also argue some of the documents requested are covered by executive privilege.\n\n\u201cPursuant to these concerns, the Department restates the President\u2019s position: \u201cGiven that you inquiry lacks any legitimate constitutional foundation, any pretense of fairness, or even the most elementary due process protections, the Executive Branch cannot be expected to participate in it,\u201d the Energy letter says, citing the White House letter.\n\nWith regard to his leaving Washington, Perry said, \u201cI've been looking at this for some time,\u201d in an interview on CNBC Friday.\n\n\u201cI don't think anybody's surprised that, you know, I've got a rather intense love affair with this state, my wife, this little town of Round Top where we have chosen to live. And so the lure became overwhelming for me to come back home and to spend time with the people that I really love,\" he said.\n\n(MORE: Energy Secretary Rick Perry, 1 of the '3 amigos' on Ukraine, to resign)\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced Friday on Twitter that he plans to nominate Deputy Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette to replace Perry. Brouillette is an Army veteran from San Antonio, Texas, and has previously worked in the energy sector including as assistant secretary for congressional affairs at the Energy Department from 2001 to 2003. More recently he worked as an executive for Ford Motor Company and USAA.\n\nAs part of the impeachment inquiry, Perry has been subpoenaed to provide documents related to his work in Ukraine and meetings with other officials involved in the region.\n\nPerry has said previously that he planned to cooperate with the congressional requests. But since then, the White House has defied those requests because it regards the impeachment inquiry as illegitimate without an official House vote.\n\nPerry has been referred to by some of his colleagues as one of the \"three amigos\" of the administration's policy in Ukraine. Members of Congress are investigating whether the White House withheld military aid to the country or offered a White House summit on the condition Ukrainian officials investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nPerry has not been accused of wrongdoing and insists his efforts in Ukraine were focused on advancing American interests in the region by promoting reforms to address corruption and bringing in American energy companies to get Ukraine away from Russian natural gas.\n\n(MORE: Energy Secretary Perry says he\u2019s confident there was no 'quid pro quo' in Ukraine)\n\nPerry said he's happy with the goals he's accomplished in his time at the Energy Department, including pushing for more American natural gas in Europe and for Ukraine to tackle corruption in the country.\n\n\"The timing was right for me. I got these big things done, the agency is in great shape, it's going to continue to be focused on the areas that are important to America. So it was a right time for me to come back home,\" he said in the interview.\n\nIn recent months, Perry and the Energy Department have frequently denied reports he planned to resign. Perry said Thursday morning he was one day closer to stepping down \"but it ain't today.\" He gave Trump his resignation notice later that day.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Outgoing Energy Secretary Rick Perry said Friday that his plans to resign are not related to the ongoing congressional impeachment inquiry into his role in the Ukraine affair, but because he wants to spend more time with family in Texas.
