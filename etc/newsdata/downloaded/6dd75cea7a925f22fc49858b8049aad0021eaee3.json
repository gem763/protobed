French prosecutors have not named him and he has not been charged with any crimes.\n\nOn Tuesday, they announced that they had searched Karin Models, an agency he founded in 1978.\n\nLe Parisien said that police had tracked Mr Brunel to South America although they gave no indication of which country.\n\nSpeaking on condition of anonymity, a friend of Mr Brunel told Le Parisien: \u201cAs part of his professional activities, he organised agency dinners frequented by very pretty girls. And to balance things out, men were invited but it didn't go any further than that.\u201d\n\nAs part of a sex trafficking probe, police on Monday also searched Epstein\u2019s vast Parisian apartment on Avenue Foch, one of the capital\u2019s most expensive streets, favoured by royalty, celebrities and billionaires.\n\nPolice searched the palatial Paris home of Jeffrey Epstein this week Credit: JACQUES DEMARTHON/AFP More\n\nAccording to French media, Epstein\u2019s French-Brazilian butler opened the door to the Parisian home, which contains around 50 rooms, including one dedicated to massage.\n\nThe newspaper said the flat showed signs of having been cleaned out.\n\nFrench investigators last month launched a preliminary investigation into whether any French citizens or residents were victims or accomplices of Mr Epstein\u2019s alleged crimes.\n\nThey were pursuing allegations that Mr Epstein raped or sexually assaulted underage girls in France on the basis of three letters from Innocence in Danger, an advocacy group.\n\nThree women have since given testimony to police but the events they allege took place have past the statutes of limitations for any prosecution to take place.\n\nThat has prompted police to issue a call for other alleged victims to come forward.\n\nEpstein was found hanged in his New York jail cell on August 10 while awaiting trial.", "description": "Police have \u201cgeolocated\u201d a French friend and former associate of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein in South America after he went \u201cmissing\u201d in the wake of the disgraced American financier\u2019s death, say French reports.", "authors": ["Henry Samuel"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/y.vD9N8_Uswve3APZ5ioxA--~B/aD0xNjkwO3c9MTY5MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/24972c8231c9ce1102015b334d2580ea", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
