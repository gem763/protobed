Hoping for the same luck with Week 8! USA TODAY\n\nThe NFL trade deadline is fast approaching, and a number of impact moves have already been made around the league. Several more could follow between now and next Tuesday\u2019s 4 p.m. deadline.\n\nA few of the most notable trades so far: the league\u2019s two unbeaten teams, the New England Patriots and San Francisco 49ers, both added talented wide receivers (Mohamed Sanu for the Pats and Emmanuel Sanders for the Niners) to further bolster their offenses. Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Rams and Baltimore Ravens each re-tooled their secondaries with the acquisitions of Jalen Ramsey and Marcus Peters, respectively.\n\nAnd there are other deals that should be made, at least in our book.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at five teams that should rank among the top buyers and five that should be sellers at the deadline:\n\nBuyers\n\nBuffalo Bills \u2013 They\u2019re off to a 5-1 start, with their lone loss coming to the division-rival Patriots. But their offense ranks among the bottom third in the league in scoring (20.2 points per game). Second-year quarterback Josh Allen is still building chemistry with offseason additions John Brown and Cole Beasley, but neither are legit No. 1 receivers. The addition of a top-flight wideout could help increase this squad\u2019s chances of reaching the postseason.\n\nCleveland Browns \u2013 They have all the weapons they could need on offense, and their defense features a lot of play-makers as well. But it\u2019s no secret that the Browns need to upgrade their offensive line. General manager John Dorsey is on record saying he has attempted to acquire a quality left tackle, but so far his efforts have been fruitless.\n\nKansas City Chiefs \u2013 Patrick Mahomes\u2019 injuries exposed the weaknesses of the Chiefs\u2019 offensive line. Meanwhile, it\u2019s obvious that the defensive upgrades of the offseason weren\u2019t sufficient. Kansas City would do well to add another cornerback to the mix, as well as a defensive lineman and perhaps an interior offensive lineman.\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles \u2013 This team still has a lot of talent, but something is just off. The front seven on defense haven\u2019t jelled as expected, and Philadelphia is struggling to win those battles in the trenches the way they need to. The defense also could have benefited from the acquisition of Ramsey, but the Eagles missed out there. Offensively, they should get back on track once DeSean Jackson returns from injury, restoring a much-needed big-play element. But the Eagles need to be looking for impact pieces on defense.\n\nSeattle Seahawks \u2013 Russell Wilson is having an MVP-caliber season and the Seahawks believe in establishing the run game, but their offense remains limited due to the absence of a true No. 1 wideout. Tyler Lockett and DK Metcalf are both nice pieces, but neither are game-changers at this point. The division-rival 49ers and Rams both have better receiving units, so the Seahawks need to find a way to ensure they can keep up in this department.\n\nSellers\n\nArizona Cardinals \u2013 This team has won three straight but is largely in rebuild mode. That\u2019s why the Cardinals would be better off trading off veteran defensive players like Terrell Suggs and Patrick Peterson in exchange for draft picks that would help them continue to construct a young core group of players.\n\nCincinnati Bengals \u2013 At 0-7 and going nowhere fast, the Bengals need to go ahead and pull the trigger on an A.J. Green deal. The seven-time Pro Bowl wideout hasn\u2019t suited up this season because of injuries, but he just returned to practice in a limited capacity. The Bengals have so many needs, however, so adding draft picks is better for their long-term than holding onto Green now only to potentially lose him in free agency this spring.\n\nLos Angeles Chargers \u2013 They resisted the urge to either trade or extend Melvin Gordon throughout the offseason and early stretch of the season. Now he\u2019s back, and he hasn\u2019t done anything to help spark their team. Austin Ekeler is playing well, so the Chargers should send Gordon to a team that could use his services.\n\nNew York Jets \u2013 For whatever reason, Leonard Williams hasn\u2019t meshed well with new defensive coordinator Gregg Williams\u2019 way of doing things. Rather than team with rookie Quinnen Williams to give the Jets a two-headed monster up front, the former No. 6 overall pick has just six tackles and no sacks through six games. A change of scenery would do him well, and the Jets would be better off adding pieces for the future.\n\nWashington Redskins \u2013 The phone has been ringing as teams have tried to pry Trent Williams away from them for months. But the Redskins have rebuffed those advances and continue to do so. The seven-time Pro Bowl left tackle isn\u2019t backing down in his stance that he doesn\u2019t want to play for the team anymore, but team president Bruce Allen\u2014who is on record saying if Williams wants to play in 2019, it will be with the Redskins\u2014is determined to win this staredown. The Redskins will consider a move in the offseason, but they can demand more now as teams like the Browns, Patriots and others are desperate to get Williams to fortify their lines for this year\u2019s playoff push. But the Redskins so far don\u2019t see the prudence of pulling the trigger now.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports\u2019 Mike Jones on Twitter @ByMikeJones and listen to the Football Jones podcast on iTunes.", "description": "There has already been a flurry of moves before the NFL's trade deadline, and more could be on the way.
