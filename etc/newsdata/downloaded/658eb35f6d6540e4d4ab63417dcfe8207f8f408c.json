The app\u2019s main selling point is its Live Brushes, which are watercolor and oil paint brushes that behave like paint in real life. The brushes react to the paint that\u2019s already on the canvas, so watercolors bloom and spread naturally, and colors blend together seamlessly. With oil paints, brush strokes are depicted with vivid texture, and you can even control how much paint can be applied on the canvas.\n\nProject Gemini lets artists draw with raster and vector brushes, combining the tools from iPad apps like Adobe Illustrator Draw and Photoshop Sketch into one app. Vector brushes are scalable to any size, and you can import Photoshop brushes from your own library, which means you can load up tools like Kyle T. Webster\u2019s custom Photoshop brushes. There are also some new features that were sorely needed in Photoshop Sketch, like a selection tool and the ability to add or subtract to the selection as well.\n\nA lot of features weren\u2019t fully ready when I previewed Photoshop for the iPad, but the Project Gemini build I saw seemed nearly complete. Files were automatically saved to Creative Cloud, and an Adobe rep told me that third-party integrations like Dropbox and Google Drive were on the way. More upcoming features included keyboard shortcuts and the UI touch modifier, which is a context-aware button that switches to the last tool you were using as you hold it down. I did miss a few features, though, like the ability to add Text and a history panel. (To be fair, most drawing apps like Procreate don\u2019t have these either.)\n\nProject Gemini\u2019s UI is almost identical to Photoshop for the iPad, with the tool palette on the left and layer properties to the right. For someone like me who\u2019s more comfortable working on a desktop than an iPad, that\u2019s an advantage. I can work with the tools I\u2019m used to and import the file as a PSD to continue working on it on the desktop.\n\nAdobe says Project Gemini is coming first to the iPad, followed by Windows 10 and Android devices. Both Project Gemini and Photoshop for the iPad are slated for release sometime in 2019. There\u2019s no pricing information yet, but Creative Cloud subscribers can expect to use the apps as part of their membership.", "description": "Adobe\u2019s Project Gemini combines the best features of Adobe Sketch and Draw into one iPad app. Its standout tool is Live Brushes, which let you paint with watercolor and oil brushes like you would in real life.", "authors": ["Dami Lee", "Apr"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gRAyFYQNQ63KMWRoGvEnni66PF4=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16017322/dlee_190408_3352_5397.jpg", "published_at": "2019-04-09"}
