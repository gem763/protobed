It is now private.\n\nIt follows politicians, Romney family members, political advisers, reporters who covered his campaigns, Romney fan accounts, as well as NFL star Tom Brady and late night comedian Jimmy Fallon, Slate reported.\n\nThe account had tweeted only 10 times and all in reply to other tweets, Slate reported. One tweet condemned U.S. President Trump's decision to withdraw American forces from northeastern Syria, a move that Romney has criticized publicly.\n\n\"John, agree on Trump's awful decision, but what could the Senate do to stop it?\" Pierre Delecto tweeted in reply to Twitter user @jwgop on Oct. 9.\n\nRomney is one of few Republicans who has publicly disavowed Trump as a series of controversies have unfolded since he entered the White House in January 2017.\n\nRomney has stood behind the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry of Trump in Congress, saying he's open to removing his fellow Republican from office depending on the results of the investigation. Trump has used Twitter, one of his favorite ways of communicating, to hit back at Romney.\n\nRomney does not follow the president on Twitter because, he told the Atlantic, he believes the president tweets too much.
