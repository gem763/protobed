Or, you might be terrified. Here\u2019s what you need to take your cycling workout outdoors.\n\nGet a helmet\n\nSafety first. Outdoors, there are all kinds of ways you can fall off your bike, either through your own mistake or by colliding with others. While there\u2019s some debate over whether casual bike riders really need helmets, you won\u2019t see serious cyclists without one. If your head hits the pavement, you definitely want to be wearing a helmet (not to mentioned the fact you can be fined for not wearing one). Get a helmet that fits, and snug up the straps so it covers your forehead.\n\nFind a safe place to start\n\nIf you haven\u2019t been riding in a while, find an empty parking lot or a quiet bike path for your first outing. If you\u2019re trying to divide your attention between operating the bike, getting a good workout in, and avoiding traffic, that\u2019s a lot to think about. When you\u2019re ready to venture forth, plan out a route in advance so you know where you can go without, for example, hitting a ton of traffic lights.\n\nLearn to shift gears\n\nIn the cycling studio, you just reach down and adjust that knob whenever the instructor tells you to, or whenever you feel like it. If she yells out that you\u2019re coming to a hill, nobody will know if you keep the resistance adjusted to a comfortable level instead.\n\nBut outdoors, it\u2019s a different story. You can change gears, but nothing will make hills truly easy. (And if you try to route around them, you may just find yourself on a different hill.) So it\u2019s worth learning how to properly change gears.\n\nNormally you\u2019ll try to keep up a good cadence (how fast your feet are moving) and adjust the gears to match. That means that when you\u2019re on the flat, each push of the pedal provides a lot of force to move you down the road. And when you get to a hill, you\u2019ll switch into a higher gear so that each push only moves you a tiny bit. This means you\u2019ll go up hills slowly, but without tiring yourself out too much.\n\nAnd don\u2019t be ashamed of walking. If you live in a hilly place, eventually you\u2019ll have to hop off your bike and walk it up a hill. You\u2019re still getting your exercise, you\u2019re just choosing the most efficient way to move on this particular bit of terrain. When you hit the top, just hop back on and keep moving.", "description": "If you\u2019ve been killing it in your indoor cycling class, you might be wondering if you have what it takes to beast on the road as well.
