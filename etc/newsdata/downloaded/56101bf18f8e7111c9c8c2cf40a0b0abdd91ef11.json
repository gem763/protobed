At the time, Pacheco cited irreconcilable differences as the reason for the separation. Now, Pancheco is accusing Renner of threatening to kill her.\n\nIn court documents obtained by TMZ, Pacheco said that last November, Renner was at a nightclub, high on coke and booze, when he allegedly told someone that he \u201ccould not deal with her anymore, and he just wanted her gone.\u201d She also claims that a nanny overheard Renner say he was going to her residence to kill her and then himself because \u201cit was better that Ava had no parents than to have [Sonni] as a mother.\u201d Pacheco is petitioning for sole custody of their 6-year-old daughter, Ava.\n\nThe court filings also describe an incident in which Renner put a gun in his mouth, threatened to kill himself, and fired the gun into the ceiling while Ava was asleep in her bedroom. Furthermore, Pacheco is accusing Jenner of verbal and emotional abuse and said he had been under the influence during physical custody of their daughter. One alleged incident describes Renner leaving cocaine on a bathroom counter that was in Ava\u2019s reach.\n\nAt the time of their divorce, E! News reported that Pacheco asked Renner to return her allegedly stolen passport, birth certificate, and Social Security card. Screenshots of a text conversation that show the two discussing the alleged theft were also published by TMZ.\n\nOver the years, there have been various other incidents and accusations that shed light on the former couple\u2019s messy relationship. According to the Wrap, a close friend of Renner\u2019s lived with the former couple and said that Pacheco, who is Canadian, admitted that she was only marrying him to secure a green card.\n\nAs for Pacheco\u2019s recent allegations against him, Renner\u2019s rep issued a statement to E! News. \u201cThe well-being of his daughter Ava has always been and continues to be the primary focus for Jeremy,\u201d the rep said. \u201cThis is a matter for the court to decide. It\u2019s important to note the dramatizations made in Sonni\u2019s declaration are a one-sided account made with a specific goal in mind.\u201d\n\nAs People reports, a court hearing is scheduled for November 7, and Renner and Pacheco were also ordered to attend child-custody mediation.", "description": "Jeremy Renner\u2019s ex-wife claims he threatened to kill her in a new lawsuit, in addition to being under the influence when he had custody of their daughter.", "authors": ["Marie Lodi"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/10/14/14-jeremyrenner.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
