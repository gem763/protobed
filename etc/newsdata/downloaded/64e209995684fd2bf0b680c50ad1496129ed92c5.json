While the Great Rann (located roughly 100km north-east of the city of Bhuj) is often referred to as India\u2019s endless \u201cWhite Desert\u201d and has little wildlife, the Little Rann (located south-east of the Great Rann to which it connects) has become something of a sanctuary for migrating birds and wildlife. Yet, these two landscapes share much in common.\n\nTowards the end of June, monsoon rains pummel the Ranns, flooding the region until October when the water slowly begins to evaporate. As the water recedes, migratory salt farmers begin setting up rectangular plots to begin harvesting the salt crystals left behind by the evaporating water. From winter until the following June, when the rains pour down again, farmers harvest as much of the raw salt crystals as they can.\n\n\u201cThe topography of the white desert is so flat that you start seeing the horizon as if you are looking into the sea, sans the water and waves,\u201d said Mitul Jethi, a local tour guide.", "description": "For most of the year, one of the world\u2019s largest salt flats is a vast sea of parched white desert \u2013 and then it completely disappears.", "authors": ["Ocean Film Company", "Sreya Chettarjee"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/7n/62/p07n625n.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
