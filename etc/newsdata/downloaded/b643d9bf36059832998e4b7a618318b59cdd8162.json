But it is the first time that any task of this kind has ever been successfully demonstrated, and could very soon lead to more practical applications, the researchers claim.\n\n\"As a result of these developments, quantum computing is transitioning from a research topic to a technology that unlocks new computational capabilities,\" the researchers conclude. \"We are only one creative algorithm away from valuable near-term applications.\"\n\nThe company now hopes to build a system that can conduct more broad operations, which could be used across a variety of different fields.\n\n\"Such a device promises a number of valuable applications,\" the researchers wrote in a blog post. \"For example, we can envision quantum computing helping to design new materials \u2014 lightweight batteries for cars and airplanes, new catalysts that can produce fertilizer more efficiently (a process that today produces over 2% of the world\u2019s carbon emissions), and more effective medicines.\n\n\"Achieving the necessary computational capabilities will still require years of hard engineering and scientific work. But we see a path clearly now, and we\u2019re eager to move ahead.\"\n\nGoogle's breakthrough had been rumoured since an early version of the paper was leaked online last month. But the publication of the research in Nature is the first time it has been publicly discussed, and anyone can read the researchers' work.\n\nIt had already been criticised by IBM, who argued that the paper was fundamentally flawed because Google had drastically overestimated the difficulty of the task and how long it would take on a classical computer. The task would actually take around 2.5 days on a classical computer and would be completed better than it was with Google's quantum computer, the firm argued in a blog post published two days before the Nature paper was made available.\n\nThe phrase \"quantum supremacy\" has also attracted criticism, both for its similarity to white supremacy and the fact it could encourage more hyped reporting on the status of quantum technology. Both of those arguments were addressed by John Preskill, the scientist who coined the phrase in 2012, in a recent article where he concluded that Google's breakthrough is nonetheless very significant.\n\nMore follows\u2026", "description": "Scientists claim to have achieved \"quantum supremacy\", a breakthrough that could change computing history.
