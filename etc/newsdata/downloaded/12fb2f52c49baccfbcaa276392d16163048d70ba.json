You\u2019ve got people that can\u2019t even access water, or medical supplies.\n\n\u201cThis can\u2019t be, respectfully, the new normal,\u201d Newsom said, noting that the current weather conditions were certain to return.\n\nThe power cuts enable utility companies to inspect high-voltage lines for damage during particularly flammable conditions caused by high winds and dry vegetation.\n\nNewsom said blackouts were \u201can industry best practice\u201d under dangerous conditions, but blamed PG&E\u2019s failure to modernize its network for the current scale of power cuts.\n\nPG&E defended the shutoffs, telling a press conference that inspections Thursday had found multiple cases of damage that could have caused wildfires had the lines been live.\n\n\u201cWe faced the choice here between hardship on everyone or safety \u2014 and we chose safety,\u201d said CEO Bill Johnson. \u201cAnd I do apologize for the hardship this has caused. I think we made the right call.\u201d\n\nWith high-risk \u201cred flag\u201d winds spreading to the Los Angeles area further south, around 13,000 customers of Southern California Edison had their electricity cut Thursday.\n\n\u201cA number of fires\u2026 are burning and there have been structures that have been lost,\u201d said Mark Ghilarducci, emergency services director at the governor\u2019s office.\n\nFire-fighting planes and helicopters were called in to tackle two fires east of Los Angeles which spread to a combined 900 acres (360 hectares), and were described by officials as \u201czero percent contained.\u201d\n\nThe local fire department said multiple structures were destroyed and \u201cnumerous medical emergencies\u201d occurred at one of the fires.\n\n\u2013 Long wait \u2013\n\nIn the far south of the state, San Diego Gas & Electric warned 30,000 customers living in high-risk areas they could potentially lose their power if conditions worsen.\n\nUrban Los Angeles itself was not expected to be at-risk, although police Wednesday night said they would clear some vulnerable homeless camps.\n\nSeveral other small fires were reported further north but quickly tackled by firefighters.\n\nPG&E on Thursday had completed inspections on some power lines in its blackout regions, and had restored electricity to more than 228,000 customers by late afternoon.\n\nBut others may have to wait several days for inspections before normal service can be restored.\n\nLast November, PG&E\u2019s faulty power lines were determined to have sparked the deadliest wildfire in the state\u2019s modern history, which killed 86 and destroyed the town of Paradise.\n\nOutdated facilities including vulnerable wooden poles and failure to deforest land surrounding high-voltage transmission lines were blamed for the inferno, causing PG&E to go bankrupt in January.\n\nThe company agreed to pay an $11 billion settlement over the devastating wildfires in northern California.\n\n\u201cThose were decisions that were made by Pacific Gas and Electric \u2014 they chose not to modernize their grid,\u201d said Newsom. \u201cOver the course of many, many years, it led to their own demise, it led to bankruptcy.\u201d\n\nThe cost of 48 hours of power cuts could reach $2.6 billion, Michael Wara, an expert in energy and climate policy at Stanford University, told CNN.", "description": "Los Angeles (AFP) \u2013 Hundreds of thousands of Californians were still without electricity due to pre-emptive blackouts Thursday as hot, windy", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/10/222ec3_pacific-gas-electric-has-begun-switching-off-power-in-california-in-bid-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
