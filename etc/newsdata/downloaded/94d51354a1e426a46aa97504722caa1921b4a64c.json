In a tweet later, Trump criticized Denmark for not meeting a NATO target of spending 2% of GDP on defense.\n\n\u201cOne thing is how much money we spend on our defense seen in isolation, and another thing is our capacity and ability to form part of the defense cooperation,\u201d Frederiksen said.", "description": "Denmark's prime minister said on Friday that it is in talks with a number of European allies about an international naval mission to ensure safe shipping through the Strait of Hormuz.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1426919096&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8517L"}
