His next two came on absurd individual efforts. In the third quarter, Lamb was wide open on a flea flicker, but somehow evaded a crowd of five Texas defenders before sprinting the final 25 yards into the end zone.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe 'ol flea flicker to CeeDee Lamb TDpic.twitter.com/0ygY2kRFdC \u2014 Yahoo Sports (@YahooSports) October 12, 2019\n\nEarly in the fourth, Jalen Hurts found Lamb yet again \u2014 this time on a pass near the 10-yard line. After making the catch, Lamb seemed to have no room to run. Again, he deftly maneuvered through three Texas defenders for his third score of the afternoon, a score that increased OU\u2019s lead to 27-17 with 11:56 to play.\n\nCEEDEE LAMB AGAINpic.twitter.com/qPMCXsg5xl \u2014 Yahoo Sports (@YahooSports) October 12, 2019\n\nThat proved to be the winning touchdown. Texas would get within seven, 27-20, with 6:53 remaining, but could not get the stop it needed. On the ensuing possession, the Sooners marched right down the field and sealed a victory with a Hurts touchdown run.\n\nOklahoma\u2019s defense is much-improved\n\nOffense has never been an issue for Oklahoma under Lincoln Riley. It was always the defense that has kept the Sooners from climbing the college football mountaintop. Things could be different now.\n\nStory continues\n\nA year ago, the 48 points OU allowed in a loss to Texas ultimately led to Riley\u2019s decision to fire Mike Stoops as defensive coordinator. Even after that decision was made, the Sooners scuffled defensively on a weekly basis, including in another College Football Playoff semifinal loss.\n\nEntering 2019, Riley hired Alex Grinch, the former Washington State defensive coordinator who spent a year at Ohio State, to run his defense. It has certainly paid off so far. Grinch\u2019s unit had pressure in the face of Texas quarterback Sam Ehlinger all afternoon and finished the game with a whopping nine sacks. Ehlinger could muster only 210 passing yards on 38 attempts. The running game didn\u2019t fare much better, gaining only 100 yards on 36 carries \u2014 58 of which came on a single run from Roschon Johnson.\n\nA defense like this will give the Sooners a much better chance to compete on the biggest stages of college football.\n\nSome struggles from Jalen Hurts\n\nJalen Hurts entered the weekend as our top candidate for the Heisman Trophy, but he had his worst game in an OU uniform against the Longhorns. Hurts has gotten away with forcing some balls into double or even triple coverage in recent weeks, but he could not do the same against the Longhorns.\n\nHurts had two red zone turnovers in the first half. In the first quarter, Hurts rumbled into Texas territory, only to fumble at the end of a 27-yard run, giving UT the ball at its own 7-yard line. And on Oklahoma\u2019s next possession, Hurts inexplicably threw back across the field into a crowd of Texas defenders \u2014 a pass that was intercepted by Brandon Jones near the goal line.\n\nHurts got away with a few other balls later in the game, but those two gaffes proved to be OU\u2019s only two turnovers of the game. Hurts would finish the afternoon with 235 yards and three touchdowns on 16-of-28 throwing. He also added 131 yards and a score on the ground.\n\nThe fact that a game with that statistical output was the worst of Hurts\u2019 season so far reflects how well he had been playing to this point in the season. With the Sooners still undefeated, Hurts will have plenty of chances to clean things up.\n\nWhat does this mean for Texas?\n\nTexas already had a loss to LSU under its belt. From a College Football Playoff perspective, Saturday\u2019s defeat may be too much to overcome. But the Longhorns still have plenty to play for.\n\nEntering Saturday, Oklahoma, Texas and No. 22 Baylor were the only three Big 12 teams without a conference loss. Baylor plays Oklahoma and Texas in back-to-back weeks in November, so Texas still has a great chance to earn a rematch with the Sooners in the Big 12 title game later in the year.\n\nBut for that to come to fruition, Texas will likely have to reel off back-to-back road wins over Iowa State and the Bears late in the year. There won\u2019t be much, if any, margin for error, either.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "CeeDee Lamb was not going to let his team lose.", "authors": ["Sam Cooper"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/rxdKptzUFiH5Fahm1GMYEA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTkuNzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/iDHwNg27s6TlCxPUKDVTfw--~B/aD0xOTY5O3c9MjkzMztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/7f69e840-ed29-11e9-a7f3-d99de57f41c6", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
