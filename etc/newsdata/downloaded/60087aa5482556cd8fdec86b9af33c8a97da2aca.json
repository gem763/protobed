FOREX-Sino-U.S. trade talk doubts lift dollar off one-month lows\n\n* Dollar index inches up as Bloomberg report fuels doubt on\n\nSino-U.S. trade talks\n\n* Chinese yuan down 0.3%, euro undermined by more weak data\n\n* Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh\n\nBy Sujata Rao\n\nLONDON, Oct 7 (Reuters) - The dollar edged up on Monday\n\nafter four straight losses last week, while China's offshore\n\nyuan and the euro were undermined by fresh jitters on the trade\n\nwar front and data that added to evidence of economic recession\n\nin Germany.\n\nA Bloomberg report that Chinese officials were reluctant to\n\nagree to U.S. President Donald Trump's broad trade deal cast a\n\npall over hopes for some progress in U.S.-China talks this week.\n\nBut the report that Beijing has narrowed the scope of a\n\npotential trade deal lifted appetite for the dollar and yen at\n\nthe expense of trade-linked currencies such as the Australian\n\ndollar and the euro. The dollar, which tends to benefit when trade tensions flare\n\nup, rose further off one-month lows hit last week when a string\n\nof poor data suggested the trade war was inflicting a bigger\n\ntoll on the world's biggest economy.\n\n\"Markets have a bit of risk-off tone today and risk-off is\n\ngenerally dollar positive,\" Stephen Gallo, head of FX at BMO\n\nCapital Markets, said, though he noted the dollar faced\n\nshort-term headwinds.\n\n\"We are not overly bullish on the dollar, with Trump\n\nimpeachment risks and increased focus on what (the U.S. Federal\n\nReserve) might do to alleviate money market tensions --that\n\ncould involve more balance sheet expansion,\" Gallo said.\n\nHe was referring to the recent surge in overnight funding\n\ncosts in U.S. repo markets which has raised speculation the\n\nFederal Reserve would resume some asset purchases.\n\nThe greenback firmed 0.15% against a basket of currencies by\n\n0730 GMT , having last week tumbled around 1% off\n\n2-1/2-year highs touched in early-September. Against the yen it\n\nwas 0.1% lower at 106.84 JPY .\n\nHedge funds have added to their massive long dollar\n\npositions, which rose in the latest week to a nine-week high,\n\naccording to calculations by Reuters and Commodity Futures\n\nTrading Commission data released on Friday. euro remains out of favour, the data showed, with\n\nbearish bets on the currency climbing sharply.\n\nThe latest data appeared to justify the pessimism, with\n\nGerman industrial orders falling more than expected in August on\n\nweaker domestic demand -- clear evidence that a manufacturing\n\nslump is pushing Europe's largest economy into recession.\n\nThe euro traded as low as $1.0964 EUR=EBS but held off\n\n2-1/2-year lows of $1.0879 last Tuesday.\n\nThe Chinese yuan CNH= fell 0.3% to 7.13 per dollar in\n\noffshore trade. There was no onshore trading as China is still\n\non break for its national day. Gallo said the clouds over the\n\ndollar offered some support to the yuan.\n\n\"If things break down this week, I don't think you will see\n\ndollar/yuan above 7.20 on that headline,\" he added.\n\nOther trade-exposed currencies such as the Australian dollar\n\nAUD=D3 and the Korean won also fell, with the former\n\nlosing a quarter percent and the won down 0.4%.\n\nSterling slipped 0.2% to around $1.23 GBP=D3 , with only a\n\nfew weeks until UK's scheduled exit from the European Union on\n\nOct. 31.\n\nSpeculators raise dollar positions https://tmsnrt.rs/35bKsA3\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>", "description": "FOREX-Sino-U.S. trade talk doubts lift dollar off one-month lows", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPED0106B_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
