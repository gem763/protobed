He told reporters getting to work with his dad, some good coaches and other good people\u2014including many of the players\u2014were highlights, adding the worst part of working in Washington was \"everything else.\"\n\nMike Shanahan assembled a formidable staff with the Redskins. In addition to his son, Sean McVay and Matt LaFleur have become head coaches. The team still managed to have losing seasons in three of Shanahan's four years, and in Washington's one playoff trip, Robert Griffin III suffered a career-altering knee injury in a Wild Card Round loss.\n\nDuring an August 2017 interview with the Washington Post's Kent Babb, Kyle Shanahan alluded to issues behind the scenes in Washington.\n\n\"I was very proud of what we did there, especially under some circumstances that weren't the easiest,\" he said. \"... Stuff that I think everyone can figure out on their own.\"\n\nCBS Sports' Jason La Canfora reported in December 2013 the younger Shanahan \"has not endeared himself to others on the staff and within Redskins Park,\" adding he \"was a cause of internal strife, surrounding himself with young coaches with inferior experience, and allowing for no checks and balances of outside voices in the offensive coaching rooms.\"\n\nAs the coach's son, Shanahan was an easy target in a 2013 season that ended with the Redskins going 3-13. He has since answered his skeptics by thriving in new surroundings.\n\nThe 39-year-old was the Atlanta Falcons offensive coordinator when they reached Super Bowl LI, and the San Francisco 49ers have started 5-0 in his third year as head coach.\n\nThe Redskins, meanwhile, have posted two winning records since firing Mike Shanahan in December 2013.", "description": "Kyle Shanahan  doesn't have fond memories from the four years he spent as the  Washington Redskins  offensive coordinator.
