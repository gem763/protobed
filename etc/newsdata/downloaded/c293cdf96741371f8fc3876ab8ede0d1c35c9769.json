The country is the world\u2019s second largest oil user.\n\nBrent is set to rise 2.6% in September, its first monthly gain since June, with prices lifted by an unprecedented attack on Saudi\u2019s oil facilities on Sept. 14 that reduced its production by half. WTI is set to rise 1.7% this month. .\n\nWorld\u2019s top oil exporter Saudi Arabia has restored capacity to 11.3 million barrels per day, sources told Reuters last week although Saudi Aramco has yet to confirm it is fully back online.\n\n\u201cMost of this is already priced in when the Saudis said they were going to do it (resume production) fast,\u201d said Avtar Sandu, a senior commodities manager at Phillip Futures in Singapore.\n\nWhile Saudi Arabia is maintaining exports by using crude from inventories and spare production capacity, how much of it is actually restored could only be determined in the next few weeks, he added.\n\nStill, geopolitical tensions in the Middle East simmered after Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince warned in an interview broadcast on Sunday that oil prices could spike to \u201cunimaginably high numbers\u201d if the world does not come together to deter Iran, but said he would prefer a political solution to a military one.\n\nThis came a day after Yemen\u2019s Houthi movement said it had carried out a major attack near the border with the southern Saudi region of Najran and captured many troops and vehicles, but there was no immediate confirmation from Saudi Arabian authorities.", "description": "Oil prices edged up on Monday after China's factories unexpectedly ramped up production in September, easing concerns about demand at the world's largest crude importer amid an ongoing trade war with the United States.", "authors": ["Florence Tan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435383579&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T01I", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
