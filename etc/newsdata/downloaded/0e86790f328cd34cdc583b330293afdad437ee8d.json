He\u2019s gone back on his word. Those are the biggest things that count for this president.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe former secretary of Housing and Urban Development advocated for \u201ccommonsense\u201d gun safety legislation and universal background checks.\n\n\u201cIf I were president right now, I would do two things,\u201d Castro told NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd on \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst of all, I would maximize executive authority to do what we can to keep our families safer from gun violence. For instance, we would immediately redefine who is a firearms dealer so that anybody who sells more than five firearms in a year is classified that way and has to conduct universal background checks. We would also push legislation in Congress to get commonsense gun safety legislation done.\u201d\n\nCastro also said that, despite worries from some that gun control could turn into gun confiscation, it\u2019s often hunters and individuals who frequent the gun range who best understand that they don\u2019t need automatic weapons and other \u201cweapons of war.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure, I agree that there are a certain percentage of people who somehow fear that one day the government is going to try and take over the country somehow and they\u2019re going need their weapons, but that\u2019s actually a minority of people out there,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a majority of people.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Trump said Sunday that he didn\u2019t see how Saturday\u2019s shootings changed much in ongoing efforts to stem gun violence.\n\n\u201cThis really hasn\u2019t changed anything. We\u2019re doing a package,\u201d he said after arriving back at the White House.\n\nHe circled back to the subject at the start of a briefing on Hurricane Dorian. \u201cMy administration is committed to working with Congress to stop the menace of mass attacks. They've been going on for a long time. Decades now. And we want to do the best we can to reduce them,\u201d Trump said.\n\n", "description": "\u201cThe biggest lies that the president has told include that he would do something about universal background checks,\u201d he said.", "authors": ["Aubree Eliza Weaver"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/9d/46/ea2a89314843b4a6b73ba8c6f45f/20190901-julian-castro-listens-ap-773.jpg"}
