REUTERS/Lindsey Wasson/File Photo\n\nCredit Suisse and UBS downgraded the stock after reports on Friday showed internal messages between two Boeing employees stating that the plane\u2019s anti-stall system behaved erratically during testing before the aircraft entered service.\n\nThe new revelations pose fresh challenges for Boeing, which is reeling under pressure after two fatal crashes forced the company to ground the planes and book billions of dollars in losses.\n\nBoeing\u2019s shares fell 2% to $337.20 in premarket trading on Monday, adding to their 18% decline since the second deadly crash of the popular single-aisle jet in Ethiopia.\n\nAlthough Boeing continued producing the planes, albeit at a lower rate, the brokerages said there is an increasing possibility that the company may have to halt production altogether.\n\n\u201cWe see increasing risk that the Federal Aviation Administration won\u2019t follow through with a certification flight in November and lift the emergency grounding order in December,\u201d UBS analyst Myles Walton said, downgrading the stock to \u201cneutral\u201d from \u201cbuy\u201d.\n\nWalton cut his target price on Boeing\u2019s shares by $95 to $375 (\u00a3289), citing an increase in \u201clikelihood of a pause on the 737 MAX production system\u201d due to a delay in the jet\u2019s return.\n\nBoeing\u2019s shares fell nearly 7% on Friday after Reuters first reported the news, which prompted a demand by U.S. regulators for an immediate explanation and a new call in Congress for the company to shake up its management.\n\nThe company on Sunday expressed regret over the messages, and said it was still investigating what they meant.\n\nCredit Suisse, which had stuck to its \u201coutperform\u201d rating since July 2017, downgraded the stock to \u201cneutral\u201d and cut its target price by $93 to $323, 6% below Boeing\u2019s Friday closing price of $344.\n\nWith the likely delay in MAX\u2019s return to service until February 2020 and the stoppage of production, the American planemaker could record $3.2 billion in charges over four months on top of a $5.6 billion charge taken so far, analyst Robert Spingarn said.\n\n\u201cBA could be forced to furlough or fire a portion of its MAX workforce. This could result in lost labor force productivity when/if the MAX does return to service. We have seen the consequences of such events in shipbuilding: it can be ugly,\u201d said Spingarn.\n\nUBS also downgraded Boeing\u2019s biggest supplier, Spirit AeroSystems (SPR.N), to \u201cneutral\u201d from \u201cbuy\u201d and cut its target price on the stock to $88 from $92, citing possible production cuts.", "description": "Boeing Co may have to book billions of dollars in additional charges, two brokerages said on Monday, following latest developments around the planemaker's grounded 737 MAX jet that calls into question the timing of the aircraft's return to service.", "authors": ["Ankit Ajmera", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443346716&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K0W2", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
