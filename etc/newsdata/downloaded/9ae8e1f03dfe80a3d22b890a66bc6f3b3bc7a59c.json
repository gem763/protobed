Leaking information, which is often times classified, only hurts this country. I have been with the president since July 2015 and can say unequivocally that I have never heard suggesting polygraphs as a way to stop leaks,' she said.", "description": "Donald Trump has weighed making his staff take lie detector tests as he has become obsessed with leaks coming out of his White House, it was revealed on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Emily Goodin", "U.S. Politcal Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/13/19442526-0-image-a-13_1570538867510.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
