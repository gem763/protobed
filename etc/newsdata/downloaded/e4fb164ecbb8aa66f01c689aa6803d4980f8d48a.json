She grew her company NYX Cosmetics into a half-billion-dollar business before selling it to L\u2019Or\u00e9al. We talked to the multimillionaire entrepreneur about her early start, her biggest mistake, and her venture fund for woman-owned businesses.\n\nCurrent mobile device: iPhone XS\n\nOne word that best describes how you work: Multitask\n\nFirst of all, tell us a little about your background and how you got to where you are today.\n\nI started working at my family\u2019s beauty business when I was 15 years old. The year I turned 25, I left the family business to start my first company, NYX Cosmetics, which I launched at 26 years old. I was basically married to the company for 15 years until I sold it to L\u2019Or\u00e9al in 2014.\n\nSelling my company allowed me to be a serious real estate investor, so I now own over half a million square feet of rentable space in Los Angeles. I also started a fund, Butter Ventures, that invests in female-owned businesses.\n\nI was born a serial entrepreneur and am a very creative person at heart, so shortly after selling NYX I launched a sunglass company called Thomas James LA that offers amazing quality, on-trend sunglasses at an affordable price of only $US19.00 ($28) a pair.\n\nIf you sacrifice a little on the front end, you can grow exponentially in a few years down the road.\ufeff\n\nWhat were the crucial steps in growing your business from a one-woman operation to a large brand?\n\nFinancial security is incredibly important. Obviously, if you don\u2019t have the finances, you can\u2019t make the payroll. When I started my first company at 26, I moved into my parents\u2019 house so I didn\u2019t have to take any money away from my business to supplement my living cost. I lived without a salary for the first three years and I invested every single dollar I made back into my business. This helped me build a very strong financial foundation.\n\nThe biggest headache you face when running a company is not having enough money to purchase inventory, pay the rent, pay the employees, etc. Once you have the financial worries out of your life, you can use that time and energy to focus on growing the business. If you sacrifice a little on the front end, you can grow exponentially in a few years down the road.\n\nWhat\u2019s the biggest mistake you\u2019ve made and how did you deal with it?\n\nWhen I launched my sunglass business, I went too big. I hired too many people, bought software programs that were too big, spent too much on the launch event, etc. The keyword is \u201ctoo much.\u201d It took me about six months to realise we were on the wrong track and I quickly took action and started scaling down my staff and started switching over to smaller and more manageable software programs. I had to make quick decisions and take swift action.\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Toni Ko\n\nWhat\u2019s changed in the beauty industry since you started?\n\nThe real question is, what has NOT changed? The beauty industry has changed so much that I am honestly having a difficult time catching up. The sales channel, marketing, social media, consumer behaviour\u2014everything has changed! The traditional ways of thinking are no longer relevant, and one must adapt or fall behind.\n\nWhat do you consider when deciding to invest in a company?\n\nFirst and foremost, I must like the product they sell, and I have to know the entrepreneur is willing to put 110% into building a successful company. I need entrepreneurs who are ALL IN. I have to see the combination of a great product and a great entrepreneur.\n\nTake us through a recent workday.\n\nI was recently on a business trip in Asia where I went to seven different cities across four countries in 14 days. When I returned back to Los Angeles, I started to put in 12-14-hour workdays.\n\nMy workday starts as soon as I open my eyes in the morning, because I buy merchandise from Asia. I have emails from the vendors that need to be followed up with early in the morning because I like to reply within 12 hours, so I don\u2019t lose a whole day going back and forth on emails.\n\nAfter that, I get ready and head into the office. Once I arrive at the office, I check in with my staff on their open projects for the day, and then I usually take some time sitting at my desk to go through more emails, planning, scheduling, etc.\n\nI will typically schedule meetings during lunchtime so I can best utilise the lunch hour. My afternoon is spent working on creative concepts, product development, and sending out necessary emails to the vendors in Asia towards the end of the day because that\u2019s when they start their work day.\n\nAfter I leave the office, I either have dinner meetings or head home to spend some time with my dog, Bruce. Then you\u2019ll find me back on the computer emailing with vendors or getting some reading done.\n\nWhat apps, gadgets, or tools can\u2019t you live without?\n\nI can\u2019t live without a notebook and a pen. A real paper notebook and a superfine pen is a MUST! I still like to write things down.\n\nWhat\u2019s your workspace setup like?\n\nI still work at my L-shaped desk that I\u2019ve owned since I started my first company in 1999. I don\u2019t think I can ever part with this desk. I always have piles of papers and samples on my desks. I clean it all the time, but things get piled on pretty quick.\n\nScreenshot: Courtesy of Toni Ko\n\nWhat\u2019s your favourite shortcut or hack?\n\nSimplified thinking! Don\u2019t overthink.\n\nTake us through an interesting, unusual, or finicky process you have in place at work.\n\nWe don\u2019t have a lot of meetings at my company because I think too many meetings are counterproductive. Also, I have an open-door policy for everyone, including myself.\n\nHow do you keep track of what you have to do?\n\nFor meetings and itineraries, I use the calendar on my iPhone. I check my schedule for the next day before I go to sleep each night, and I check it again first thing in the morning. For projects, I always write a to-do list.\n\nHow do you recharge or take a break?\n\nTravelling! I love to travel. Anywhere in the world.\n\nWhat\u2019s your favourite side project?\n\nI absolutely love tending to my backyard chickens and vegetable garden. I love to gift the eggs and veggies from my garden to my friends! You can call me #FarmerKo.\n\nWhat are you currently reading, or what do you recommend?\n\nI just finished reading Educated by Tara Westover, and it was amazing. I\u2019m now currently reading Billion Dollar Whale by Bradley Hope and Tom Wright, which is super interesting. However, if there is one book I would recommend all entrepreneurs read, it would be Good to Great, by James C. Collins.\n\nWho else would you like to see answer these questions?\n\nKerrigan Behrens, the co-founder and CMO of Sagely Naturals.\n\nWhat\u2019s the best advice you\u2019ve ever received?\n\n\u201cFocus only on the goal. Everything else is just noise.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s a problem you\u2019re still trying to solve?\n\nTrying to use less screen time on my iPhone.
