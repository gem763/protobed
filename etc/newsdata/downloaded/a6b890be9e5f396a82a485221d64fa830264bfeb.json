Maybe they have believed too much of their own hype and got carried away dreaming about next summer.\n\nEngland needed a win in Prague to clinch qualification for their \u201chome tournament\u201d next summer and, predictably, we have already been getting carried away with players talking about winning the trophy.\n\nWell, they can stop dreaming now and start waking up to the reality that you are never going to win major tournaments defending like this.\n\nOf course England still look nailed on to qualify but, after shipping three goals against Kosovo last month, and now gifting the Czech Republic an unlikely victory, there will be a touch less swagger about Southgate\u2019s players.\n\nThe likes of France, Belgium and Spain will fear England\u2019s attack but they will feast on their defence if they carry on playing like this. Unless they improve dramatically, Euro 2020 will remain a pipe dream.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nSouthgate must find a better balance between attack and defence, a stronger midfield and better defenders because the current back four look frail and vulnerable, short of confidence.\n\nNo wonder the Czechs celebrated wildly at the end, this was a glorious and revenge as England thrashed them 5-0 at Wembley. But just seven months on, England have suddenly got problems.\n\nEngland were out of the blocks at lightning speed and their first proper attack resulted in a fifth minute lead. Mason Mount, making his first start in midfield, fed Harry Kane and England\u2019s top scorer released Raheem Sterling with a brilliant first time pass.\n\nSterling burst into the box, checked back inside and was tripped by Czech defender Lukas Masopust. It was a clear penalty and Kane made no mistake to score his 27th goal for England in 42 caps.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nHere we go, thought the 3,000 travelling England fans. But the optimism soon faded away. The Czechs levelled from a corner after nine minutes. Declan Rice slipped, Ondrej Celustka swiped at the ball, Michael Keane was caught ball-watching and Jakub Brabec bundled home.\n\nEngland were overrun in midfield, Mason Mount was pushed far too forward leaving Rice and Jordan Henderson exposed and the defence were battered. Keane is struggling and Harry Maguire is out of form.\n\nThey need to look at new defenders. Joe Gomez must start playing regularly at Liverpool, Tyrone Mings is in the squad, the likes of Lewis Dunk is surely worth a look. Maybe it was too early for Mount and it is hard to understand why Harry Winks is being overlooked.\n\nSouthgate changed it at half time with Mount dropping deeper into a 4-3-3 and they looked better. Both Sterling - England\u2019s best attacker - and Kane went through but were denied by keeper Tomas Vaclik.\n\nMeanwhile, Pickford made good saves to deny the Czechs. But the stadium exploded after 85 minutes. Danny Rose went down after a collision with Tomas Soucek, Masopust put over a cross and substitute Ondrasek scored on his debut. That just rubbed salt in England\u2019s wounds.", "description": "The Three Lions looked all at sea at the back and were made to pay by an average Czech side on a night to forget", "authors": ["John Cross", "Image", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20563613.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Euro-2020-Qualifier-Group-A-Czech-Republic-v-England.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
