But politics remain at the top of his agenda.\n\nThe party\u2019s Central Committee is expected to gather behind closed doors Monday for the first time since February 2018 -- the longest stretch the 200-plus-member body has gone without meeting since China began its reform era four decades ago. And Xi looks poised to pick up where he left off: solidifying control over the ruling party and the country of almost 1.4 billion people.\n\nWhile such \u201cplenums\u201d are closely guarded affairs, state media have said party leaders would make \u201cgreater efforts in sticking to and improving the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics, as well as strengthening China\u2019s system and capacity for governance.\u201d That arcane language suggests a sweeping agenda focused on further centralizing power around the president that may include reshuffling some key leadership roles when it ends on Thursday.\n\n\u201cXi has defined China\u2019s governing system as really incredibly broad, encompassing everything from how the party manages politics to the economy to society to culture to itself to the environment,\u201d said Trey McArver, co-founder of Beijing-based research firm Trivium China. \u201cIt could end up being a relatively comprehensive or broad-based approach to everything.\u201d\n\nXi has repeatedly warned against complacency in recent months, complaining in a speech last month that some cadres were \u201cweak-kneed and unwilling to fight\u201d against the party\u2019s growing and long-term challenges. China is projected to see the slowest growth in gross domestic product in almost three decades this year -- a concern made worse by the trade war with U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nSome observers had expected this plenum to focus more on economic policies, since the one last year also dealt with politics. While a rash of negative economic data have raised speculation that the party leadership might take more decisive action to boost domestic demand, Xi also needs to make sure the party\u2019s -- and thus his -- rule can endure the coming downturn.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to see how the big topics such as growth, stability and reforms are being prioritized,\u201d said Peiqian Liu, China economist at Natwest Markets Plc. in Singapore. \u201cFor instance, the pledge for better party building might lead to higher confidence and greater acceptance of slower growth among the top leaders, and that local officials can be more focused on reforms.\u201d\n\n\u2018Low Expectations\u2019\n\nThe last time the Central Committee met 20 months ago, Xi secured the body\u2019s blessing to repeal constitutional term limits keeping him from serving as president past 2023. The move represented one of the party\u2019s sharpest departures from the model of collective leadership embraced after Mao Zedong\u2019s tumultuous and personality-driven rule.\n\nStill, plenums are rarely that dramatic and the results often take months or even years to come into focus. The outcome will probably first be detailed in a jargon-laden communique released after the meeting.\n\nAlthough the communique may provide important signals about where China\u2019s political system and its economy are headed, it\u2019s unlikely to answer key questions such as how the leadership will manage slowing growth, mounting debt and a rapidly aging population.\n\nChina\u2019s list of economic headaches includes the downdraft from the trade war with the U.S, factory-price deflation, a fragile financial system and spiraling food costs in the wake of a catastrophic disease epidemic among the nation\u2019s pig herd. Even so, policy makers are wary of embarking on large-scale stimulus measures for fear of resurgent debt levels or bursting the bubble in the property market.\n\n\u201cWe have pretty low expectations of this plenum producing a decision that will be meaningful for markets and investors,\u201d said Tom Rafferty, principle China economist for the Economist Intelligence Unit. \u201cWhat they are looking for is a clearer economic road map for the 2020s, but this plenum is not going to provide that.\u201d\n\n(Updates with length of meeting in third paragraph.
