ETH price is likely to retest the $200 support area before the bulls might take a stand.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis\n\nAfter testing the $225 level, ETH price started a downside correction against the US Dollar. The price broke the $215 and $212 support levels to move into a short term bearish zone. Moreover, there was a close below the $212 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. The recent decline gained pace below the $210 level and the price traded as low as $206.\n\nAt the moment, Ethereum price is correcting higher above the $210 level. It broke the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $218 high to $206 low. However, the bears are protecting the $212 resistance area and the 100 hourly SMA. Moreover, the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $218 high to $206 low is sitting tight near the $212 level.\n\nThere is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $214 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The trend line is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $218 high to $206 low. Therefore, the price is likely to face a lot of hurdles near the $212 and $215 levels. To start a solid upward move, the price must climb above the $215 level and settle above the 100 hourly SMA.\n\nOn the downside, an immediate support is near the $206 low. However, the main support is near the $202 and $200 levels. It seems like the price could extend its decline towards the $200 support area before it might start a decent upward move.\n\nLooking at the chart, Ethereum price is clearly trading in a short term bearish zone below the $212 and $215 levels. If there is an upside break above $215, the price will most likely climb towards the $225 monthly high. If not, the price could revisit $200.\n\nETH Technical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is slowly moving into the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is currently below the 50 level, with a few bearish signs.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $202\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $215", "description": "Ethereum price is currently declining below $212 versus the US Dollar, similar to bitcoin.
