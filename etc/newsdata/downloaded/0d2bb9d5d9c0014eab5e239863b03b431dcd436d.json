We parents think our children are our gifts to the world: brilliant, funny, talented humans, capable of anything. We also think they\u2019re thoughtless, careless idiots who can\u2019t remember to set an alarm or pick a wet towel up off the floor. We know our kids\u2019 strengths and weaknesses so well \u2014 or at least we think we do \u2014 that we instinctively anticipate every mistake they might make. A big part of being a good parent is letting them screw up anyway \u2026 or, more often than we can imagine, letting them surprise us with how ready they actually are to take command of their own lives.\n\nIs this Michael\u2019s ploy with Eleanor? By the end of this week\u2019s \u201cA Girl from Arizona Part 2,\u201d she sure seems to think so; and he does nothing to disabuse her of that notion. But when she accuses him \u2014 admiringly \u2014 of faking his nervous breakdown as a way to get her to step up and take charge, he hesitates for a second before he says, \u201cGuilty!\u201d Because here\u2019s another secret about parents: Sometimes we don\u2019t know why we make the choices we make, or why they work.\n\nGranted, the jury\u2019s still out on whether the Michael-to-Eleanor transition is \u201cworking\u201d per se. But she definitely rallies after a disastrous first few days as the Neighborhood\u2019s fake architect. She started out so poorly that midway through this episode her friends stage an impromptu intervention, with Janet noting that the already marginal win-probability for their soul-saving mission has dropped since Eleanor took over. \u201cStrictly from a mathematical standpoint you are kind of pooching it,\u201d Janet says, to which our Arizona gal reflexively snaps, \u201cYou\u2019re all ungrateful ash-faces who can shove your fat grumps all the way up your snork-box.\u201d (\u201cWhich curses are those?\u201d Michael asks.)\n\nThe source of Eleanor\u2019s exasperation? Well, everything really, but specifically Brent, the entitled ash-hole who was \u201cborn on third base, thinks he invented the game of baseball.\u201d Eleanor has what she thinks are two good ideas for breaking Brent. First, she concocts a fake talk show called That Was Your Life, to see if comparing his meager accomplishments to what genuinely good people have done will help him realize he doesn\u2019t belong in the Good Place. Then she pulls the \u201cliving nightmare\u201d trick on him, torturing him with his own preoccupations and privilege by showering him with Perrier rain while a giant Princeton Tiger mascot and enormous golfballs and SUVs terrorize the Neighborhood.\n\nBoth gambits fail. For one thing, Brent actually thinks he was a great man. (Who else could have grown an inherited materials supply business from $90 million in revenue to $94 million in just 18 years?) But also: The attack on the Neighborhood convinces him that the Good Place is not the Best Place, which is where he belongs. He should be in a place with a Janet who\u2019s not so \u201cuptight,\u201d and is willing to wear the outfits he has her make for herself. Also, where are his guys? Where\u2019s White Guillermo? Mexican William? Squirtman?\n\nAll of this leads Eleanor to sip on a fishbowl-size margarita, under the collapsing That Was Your Life sign (a nifty little visual cue, that), while telling Michael she quits. It\u2019s ridiculous, in her opinion, to entrust the future of humanity\u2019s afterlife to some run-of-the-mill American nobody, who in her lifetime mostly just ate junk food, watched reality shows, and \u201csometimes left H&M wearing more underpants than I had on when I came in.\u201d\n\nBut in one of The Good Place\u2019s sweetest scenes \u2014 and this series has had a few of those \u2014 Michael peps Eleanor back up, saying that really only some Arizona rando can do this job, because, \u201cHuman beings, it turns out, are weird.\u201d Failing a thousand times doesn\u2019t mean she shouldn\u2019t try for a 1001st, like \u201ca hot blonde Wile E. Coyote.\u201d (Eleanor\u2019s choice of words, not Michael\u2019s.)\n\nIn the closing minutes of \u201cA Girl from Arizona,\u201d the girl in question starts her comeback. She tricks Brent into not being quite so infuriatingly awful, by promising him some good ol\u2019 fashioned moral dessert, saying there really is a \u201cBest Place,\u201d and that he can get there by treating others with kindness and courtesy. A similar scheme works on Simone, once Chidi charms her with some flirtatious banter and a suggestion that her solipsistic insistence that she\u2019s stuck in her own malfunctioning subconscious is both juvenile and jerky. Why not be just nice to her neighbors, in case they happen to be real? Simone agrees there\u2019s no harm in that. Another win for Arizona.\n\nEleanor still has her work cut out for her. There\u2019s trouble brewing with Jason, who can\u2019t seem to stop himself from distracting Janet, even after Michael gets him to admit that his biggest weakness is impulse control, and that wanting to do something isn\u2019t a good reason to immediately do it. (Jason wonders why nobody taught him this lesson on Earth, and Michael sighs, \u201cPeople tried. Mostly judges.\u201d) Jason tries to give Janet space \u2026 for about a day, before he\u2019s pestering her by describing the box of chocolates he got for her and then ate himself. (\u201cThe first one was gross,\u201d he says before she stops him.) Janet has no choice but to put their relationship on hold, which is crushing enough. Then she also lets him know that back on Earth, the Jacksonville Jaguars cut Blake Bortles.\n\nSo yeah, Jason\u2019s going to be a mess for a while. But Eleanor can handle it, with her \u201ctrademark brand of B-minus leadership.\u201d Because perhaps the only way to save a species as basic as humankind is call on someone who knows our ways, from the inside out.\n\nIn the Neighborhood\n\n\u2022 If all humanity needs is a girl from Arizona to fix a broken universe, does it absolutely have to be Eleanor? She volunteers Scottsdale\u2019s own Emma Stone.\n\n\u2022 This two-parter\u2019s credited writers, Andrew Law and Kassia Miller, have a lot of fun defining the exact nature of Brent\u2019s smug entitlement. One of their best gags is having Brent pull the all-too-common \u201cWho really needs to know things, anyway?\u201d trick of misattributing a sentiment to Martin Luther King Jr. \u2014 who, for the record, did not ever say, \u201cWhen life knocks you on your butt, you jump right back up and start throwing haymakers.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Jason is ready to lift the Neighborhood\u2019s spirits with \u201ca Jacksonville carnival.\u201d All he needs is a bouncy house, ninja stars, and a bunch of ambulances.", "description": "After a disastrous first few days as the Neighborhood\u2019s fake architect, Eleanor rallies in characteristically reluctant fashion.
