But according to a report from the Washington Post, in 2017, he pushed the president to extradite Turkish cleric Fethullah G\u00fclen from his compound in Pennsylvania so often that White House aides, according to the paper, \u201cworried that Giuliani was making the case on behalf of the Turkish government.\u201d\n\nWith the G\u00fclen push \u2014 and a previously reported effort to pressure former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to stop the prosecution of a Turkish-Iranian trader \u2014 the accusation that Giuliani has been running a shadow foreign policy shop gains momentum, as he draws himself into the scrutiny surrounding the Trump administration\u2019s convenient bending to Turkish interests.\n\nThe founder of the Hizmet movement, G\u00fclen claims there are millions of followers of his brand of Sunni Islam known for prioritizing education: As of 2014, the group ran the largest charter-school organization in the United States, with around 120 affiliates. G\u00fclen was an ally of President Erdogan until a falling out in 2013, when Ankara labeled the movement a terrorist group; in 2016, Erdogan blamed G\u00fclen for a coup attempt that resulted in 265 deaths.\n\nFor Giuliani, \u201cit was all G\u00fclen,\u201d one former official said; another added that it was his \u201chobby horse.\u201d Apparently, he rode the issue hard enough to help convince the president: A senior administration official said that Trump repeatedly asked why the cleric couldn\u2019t be extradited, referring to Erdogan as \u201cmy friend.\u201d As usual, the bad idea was halted when staffers told the president it was a terrible idea, that it could be illegal, and would certainly be politically damaging.\n\nGiuliani\u2019s reported effort to influence the Trump administration to extradite G\u00fclen came shortly after a similar attempt by former national security adviser Michael Flynn \u2014 who at least registered as a foreign agent for his promotion of Turkish interests in the United States. If administration officials\u2019 fears that Giuliani was lobbying extradition on behalf of the Turkish government are validated, it could put him on the hook for more potential illegal activity. Failing to register as a foreign agent can (but rarely does) result in a prison sentence of up to five years. In his defense, Giuliani told the Post that he has \u201cnever lobbied for a foreign government,\u201d and that the idea that he pushed for G\u00fclen\u2019s extradition \u201csounds wacky.\u201d", "description": "Rudy Giuliani reportedly pressured Donald Trump to remove Turkish cleric and Erdogan opposition leader Fethullah Gulen in 2017, dating his effort to sway foreign policy to the administration\u2019s early days.", "authors": ["Matt Stieb"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/03/03-rudy-giuliani.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
