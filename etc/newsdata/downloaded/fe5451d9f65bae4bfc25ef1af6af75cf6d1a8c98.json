When you have a gap control or a responsibility on a run play, you have to be there. When you have a coverage responsibility, you have to do it.\u201d\n\nBrowns quarterback Baker Mayfield kept the Browns on the field on third down, tiring out a Ravens defense that has yielded more than 500 yards over successive weeks.\n\n\u201cWhen I broke down (the Chiefs game), I told the guys we had a brand to protect,\u201d defensive tackle Michael Pierce said. \u201cFor a lot of reasons, we did not do it.\u201d\n\nIn spite of it all, the Ravens still had a shot after Lamar Jackson threw an 8-yard touchdown pass to Mark Andrews to cut the deficit to 24-18 with 9:51 left.\n\nAn instant later, Nick Chubb burst through the left side of the Baltimore defense on an 88-yard run for a 12-point cushion.\n\nThat pretty much sealed defeat against a team the Ravens had beaten 30 of 40 times. Prior to this ambush, Baltimore was 10-1 against Cleveland at home since Harbaugh took over in 2008.\n\nMayfield threw for 342 yards, Jarvis Landry had eight receptions for 167 yards and Chubb rambled for 165 yards. But blame the Ravens for busted coverages, poor tackling and three turnovers - including a pair of interceptions by Jackson, ending his run of passes without a pick at 248.\n\n\u201cMistakes are going to happen,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a person play a perfect game. We just have to go out there, move on to the next play and do us.\u201d\n\nFor the most part, the Browns seemed to effectively shut down the Ravens passing attack, especially the deep balls that Jackson has become much more adept at throwing.\n\n\u201cThey played sound defense,\u201d said rookie Miles Boykin, who made his second touchdown catch. \u201cThey tried to keep everything in front of them and limit their mistakes, and that\u2019s what they did.\u201d\n\nAbout the only positive is that the defending AFC North champions are still looking good in a division that has experienced a dramatic dropoff - except perhaps for the Browns.\n\nNext week, Baltimore takes to the road for a rivalry game against Pittsburgh.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to sting for a couple of hours. (Monday) we will be getting ready for the Steelers,\u201d wide receiver Willie Snead said.\n\nRookie Marquise Brown, Baltimore\u2019s most prominent deep threat, was held to four catches for 22 yards with a long of 10 yards.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m done with this game,\u201d Brown declared. \u201cI\u2019m focused on Pittsburgh.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Baltimore Ravens figured they really didn't have much to worry about after a narrow loss on the road against the unbeaten Kansas City Chiefs.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "David Ginsburg"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/29/browns_ravens_football_13122_c0-156-3743-2338_s1770x1032.jpg?77949b40d184d97e1744886d45958c3b13745e4e", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
