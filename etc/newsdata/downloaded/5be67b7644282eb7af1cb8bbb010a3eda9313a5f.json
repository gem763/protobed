(Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nJill Van Cleave wore so many campaign stickers on the front of her shirt there was almost no room left. Among them was the red and black emblem of Cory Booker, the blue and gold logo of Pete Buttigieg and Elizabeth Warren\u2019s name written in her campaign\u2019s signature color of liberty green.\n\nVan Cleave was among the thousands of Democrats \u2014 12,342 to be exact \u2014 who descended on a muddy lakeside park here Saturday, withstanding hours of drizzle and then steady rain at the Polk County Democrats Steak Fry to listen to 17 presidential hopefuls make their pitch to voters in this all-important first caucuses state.\n\nBut as the day wound to a close, Van Cleave, 50, a schoolteacher from Marshalltown, felt as conflicted as ever. \u201cThere are so many candidates I like,\u201d she said. \u201cElizabeth Warren is my favorite. But to me, electability is so important. . . . I just want someone who can beat Donald Trump. I think she can, but I\u2019m not sure. I am just so torn.\u201d\n\nWith four months to go before next year\u2019s Feb. 3 caucuses, the competition for votes is intensifying in Iowa, with most Democrats still grappling with the question of who is best positioned to take on President Trump.\n\n[Warren, before huge NYC crowd, touts herself as an heir to female pioneers]\n\nA new Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll of likely caucus-goers released Saturday night found surging support for Warren in the race. According to the poll, 22 percent of likely caucus-goers said Warren is their first choice for the Democratic nomination. Former vice president Joe Biden was at 20 percent, followed by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) at 11 percent. No other candidate was in double digits.\n\nThe survey was more proof of Warren\u2019s growing popularity in Iowa, where she has attracted large crowds for months. It marked the first notable shake-up in the race. Though Warren\u2019s lead was narrow, Biden had been the polling leader in all three of the Register\u2019s 2020 polls, including the most recent one in June.\n\nThe poll was released after a whirlwind day of campaigning at the Steak Fry, which has been an essential Iowa tradition for presidential candidates for the past 40 years since it was launched as a small grass-roots fundraiser for Tom Harkin, a revered Iowa Democrat who retired from the U.S. Senate in 2014. It has long been regarded as one of the best opportunities for a candidate to make a splash among Iowa Democrats and show their organizational force.\n\nBiden, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) and Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., each reserved massive spaces to rally their supporters. And like all the campaigns, they each led big parades to the stage, including Harris, who danced with a drum line and hundreds of cheering supporters.\n\nThe show of force comes at a pivotal time for Harris, who has been lagging in national and Iowa polls. She announced in the past week that she is going all-in on Iowa in hopes of placing in the top three, a ticket that her campaign hopes could propel her to South Carolina and into Super Tuesday. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you heard,\u201d Harris cheekily said on the stage. \u201cI\u2019m moving to Iowa.\u201d\n\nHarris was not the only candidate looking to the Steak Fry for a jolt of life. While Booker marched into the event with scores of enthusiastic supporters and received a standing ovation from most of the crowd, he offered a more dire assessment of his campaign offstage. He told reporters if he can\u2019t raise $1.7 million in coming days that he will reconsider whether he has the \u201cpathway\u201d to win the nomination. \u201cI don\u2019t believe people should stay in this just to stay in it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou either have a trajectory to win or not.\u201d\n\n[Harris grew up in a white world. Then she went to a black university.]\n\nBiden arrived at the Steak Fry as the national polling leader, with scores of supporters who turned up early to rally with the former vice president. His parade included a firetruck packed with members of the International Association of Firefighters, a union that has endorsed his campaign, which sounded its siren to announce Biden\u2019s entrance into the event.\n\nBiden was immediately swarmed by supporters clamoring for photographs and signatures. He pumped his fist, keeping the rhythm of a chant of his name, and reached through a mass of cameras to shake hands. Racing to a grill, where the candidates each spent time cooking chicken and steak, Biden threw on an apron.\u201cPut me to work,\u201d he said.\n\nOnstage, Biden made no mention of reports that President Trump had urged the Ukranian president to open up an investigation into a company with ties to Biden\u2019s son Hunter.\n\nBut hours before, at a gaggle with reporters, Biden called Trump\u2019s actions an \u201coverwhelming abuse of power\u201d and urged congressional Democrats to investigate. He also suggested the president\u2019s actions indicated he is worried about winning reelection.\n\nTrump \u201cknows I\u2019ll beat him like a drum,\u201d the former vice president told reporters.\n\nWhile the Biden campaign bought more than a thousand tickets to hand out to supporters, the Warren campaign bought just 200, gambling that her supporters would turn out without much nudging.\n\nAnd as the senator from Massachusetts took the stage, thousands of Warren signs popped up into the air.\n\nAfterward, Warren spent more than two hours at her campaign booth, posing for more than 1,000 selfies in what has become her signature campaign move. Among those waiting in line was Trey Hill, a middle school teacher from Ankeny, who said he\u2019d narrowed down his choices to Warren, Buttigieg and Sanders.\n\n\u201cFor Warren, for me, it was definitely . . . her confidence, her just sheer strength and determination to fight for what she believes in. I\u2019m really interested in Bernie just because he is kind of the impetus to this revolution that we have going on,\u201d Hill said. \u201cAnd Pete, I just think that he\u2019s one of the most intelligent people I\u2019ve ever heard speak and I think that he\u2019s got a mind to really take this country really far.\u201d\n\nWhen he got to the front of the line, a Warren aide took Hill\u2019s phone; he would have about three seconds with the senator.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m with you in this fight!\u201d Hill blurted out.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely, thank you!\u201d Warren told him.", "description": "A new poll shows Sen.
