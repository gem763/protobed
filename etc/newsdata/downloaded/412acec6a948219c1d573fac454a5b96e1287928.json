The active-duty suicide rate was about 24.8 per 100,000 service members, up from 21.9 in 2017 and 18.7 in 2013.\n\n\u201cAlthough the suicide rate among most of our military populations is comparable to civilian rates, this is hardly comforting, and our numbers are not moving in the right direction,\u201d Elizabeth Van Winkle, the Pentagon\u2019s executive director of force resiliency, told reporters on Thursday.\n\nService members who die by suicide continue to be mostly male, white and under the age of 30, said Karin Orvis, director of the Pentagon\u2019s defense suicide prevention office. The Army and Marine Corps, the services with the highest suicide rates, also have the greatest percentage of men.\n\nThe most common method of suicide in the military was a firearm, with 60 percent carried out with one among active-duty forces, the report said.\n\n\u201cOn the surface, suicide in the military appears to be markedly higher than the U.S. population,\u201d the Pentagon\u2019s report said. \u201cNevertheless, the direct comparison of military suicide rates and the U.S. military population is misleading. It is well established that males have a nearly four times higher risk of suicide death than females.\u201d\n\nThe military trains commanders how to deal with death within their unit, including by suicide. Van Winkle said she has noticed how much more they talk about it to reduce the stigma associated with seeking help.\n\nBut the Pentagon must build better understanding of the effectiveness of its suicide-prevention efforts, she said. That can be done through examining pilot programs and seeing \u201cwhat is working in the civilian sector and bringing it into the military as a promising practice and to measure the effectiveness.\u201d\n\nDefense Secretary Mark T. Esper, speaking ahead of the report\u2019s release on Wednesday, told reporters that \u201cever single\u201d suicide is a tragedy.\n\n\u201cI wish I could tell you we have an answer to prevent further, future suicides in the Armed Forces,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t. We are caught up in what some call a national epidemic of suicide among our youth. And not just our youth, but it\u2019s something we continue to wrestle with.\u201d\n\nEsper said the military has \u201cthe means and the resources to get ahead of this and do better than our civilian counterparts.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, he added on Twitter that the release of the report \u201cis an important step towards understanding a complex issue that has no easy solution.\u201d\n\nThe active-duty rates rose especially sharply in the Marine Corps, jumping from 23.4 per 100,000 in 2017 to 31.4, and in the Army, where it increased from 24.3 per 100,000 to 29.5.\n\nThe Navy\u2019s rate stayed about the same, rising slightly from 20.1 per 100,000 to 20.7, while the Air Force\u2019s dropped from 19.6 per 100,000 to 18.5.\n\nThe suicide rates among National Guard members also continued to rise, and at a higher pace than that of active-duty troops. Some 30.6 per 100,000 National Guardsmen died by suicide in 2018, up from 29.8 per 100,000 in 2017 and 27.1 in 2016, the Pentagon report said.\n\nThe Pentagon focuses on suicide rates rather than raw numbers to account for the military\u2019s fluctuating size over time, Orvis said.\n\nIn the overall U.S. population, the suicide rate has climbed from 12.1 per 100,000 in 2010 to 14 in 2017, according to a report released by the National Institute of Mental Health in the spring. In the same time frame, the rate for men jumped from 19.8 per 100,000 to 22.4 and the rate for women climbed from about 5 per 100,000 to 6.1.\n\nIn a statement released Thursday in conjunction with the report, the Marine Corps\u2019 top officer, Gen. David Berger, said that service members, unit leaders, families and mental-health professionals all have a role in suicide prevention.\n\n\u201cEvery Marine and Sailor must work together to be engaged in each other\u2019s lives,\u201d he said. \"Just as we talk about physical fitness, marksmanship, training and education \u2013 Marines must also be comfortable discussing life\u2019s struggles, mental wellness and suicide. We must create a community where seeking help and assistance are simply normal, important decisions Marines and Sailors make.\u201d\n\nIn a joint statement, Army Secretary Ryan D. McCarthy and the Army\u2019s top officer, Gen. James C. McConville, said they will \u201ccontinue to take a hard look at the challenges we face with suicide to ensure the proper resources are in place to protect those at risk.\n\n\u201cWe believe engaged leadership, focused training and education will promote a supportive environment, prevent high-risk behaviors and increase Army readiness,\" they said. \u201cThe Army is about people and our team, and we are focused on strengthening resilience, increasing help-seeking behaviors and reducing suicides.\u201d\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that the suicide rate for active-duty troops rose consecutively for the past five years.
