Although August\u2019s drop was smaller than economists had expected, a downturn in demand highlights the challenges that Beijing faces as it seeks to prop up growth that has fallen to its lowest rate in more than a quarter-century.\n\nEconomists regard the stubbornly sluggish domestic demand as evidence that Beijing must move quickly to further ease fiscal and monetary policies. Although Beijing and Washington have agreed to continue trade talks, the chance of a quick end to the trade war seems slim, they say.\n\nLast month, China\u2019s central bank revised its interest-rate mechanism in a bid to improve companies\u2019 access to capital, and on Friday it cut the amount of capital that banks must set aside in a bid to spur lending.\n\nSince the trade war began last year, Beijing has rolled out a series of measures, including tax cuts and more financing for infrastructure projects, to head off an economic slowdown. Last week, China\u2019s cabinet asked local governments to pull forward some bond issuance planned for next year so that investment in rail, parking lots and other public projects can be rolled out sooner.\n\nGiven trade uncertainties and slowing global economic growth, Beijing\u2019s priority has shifted to stabilizing economic growth, said Steven Zhang, a Shanghai-based economist at Morgan Stanley Huaxin Securities.\n\n\u201cThe government is definitely trying to be pre-emptive to boost domestic demand, with a clear focus on infrastructure,\u201d Mr. Zhang said.\n\nBut authorities have refrained from the large-scale stimulus measures that it has turned to in past downturns, in part out of concern that doing so would further inflame concerns about mounting debt and about rising prices for housing and other basic living costs.\n\nDespite the authorities\u2019 tepid attempts at stimulus, business confidence has remained depressed in large part because of the trade uncertainties.\n\nLei Juan, a representative of Xiamen Jingxin Precision Mould Co., a company that makes LED lights in southeastern Fujian province, said a lack of orders and rising labor costs are hurting the company\u2019s prospects.\n\nThe company is trying to promote its products through social media, such as on the domestic Chinese version of the popular mobile app TikTok, and increasing its presence at industrial expos. Even so, Ms. Lei said, \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult time for everyone, especially private firms like us.\u201d\n\nBeijing and Washington have signaled that they are still talking to try to resolve their trade disputes. China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce said last week that the two sides are discussing whether to proceed with talks previously scheduled for September.\n\nAny breakthrough in trade talks can come only if both sides show some flexibility, Huo Jianguo, a former head of a trade-policy body at China\u2019s Commerce Ministry, said at a forum on Friday.\n\n\"China cannot simply count on Trump to step down to resolve trade disputes. We must focus on doing our own things well,\u201d Mr. Huo said.\n\nChina\u2019s exports have also been hit. Sunday\u2019s customs data showed a 1% decrease in exports in August from a year earlier, reversing a 3.3% gain in July. Economists had expected exports to rise 3% in August.\n\nAlthough China\u2019s exports to the European Union held up, exports to the U.S. tumbled by nearly 16% last month after falling 6.5% in July from a year earlier, customs data show.\n\nThe drop was surprising since economists had expected Chinese companies to front-load exports in August ahead of a scheduled Sept. 1 increase in tariffs by the Trump administration.\n\nMr. Zhang, the economist, said, however, that he expected continued front loading and the typical uptick in orders ahead of the Christmas season that should modestly support exports in the coming months. Another round of tariff increases is set to take effect on Dec. 15.\n\nThe new soft trade data comes as Beijing faces challenges on multiple fronts, including a major disruption in the supply of pork, China\u2019s staple food, and turmoil in Hong Kong, its traditional bridge to global markets.\n\nTo relieve a shortage of pork due to an outbreak of African swine fever, China has boosted pork imports. Customs data Sunday showed that the country\u2019s pork imports had surged 66% over the first eight months of the year compared with the year-ago period.\n\n\u2014Liyan Qi", "description": "China\u2019s imports fell for a fourth straight month in August as a drop-off in exports to the U.S. steepened, the most recent economic warning signs during a prolonged trade spat with the U.S.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105068/social", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
