Zoom Video and CrowdStrike are proving to be the opposite.\n\nBoth companies saw their share prices drop Friday despite reporting very strong operating results for their fiscal second quarters the night before. Both companies also still happen to be the best performers in this year\u2019s crop of tech IPOs. Zoom\u2019s shares are up 137% from their listing value even with Friday\u2019s selloff, while CrowdStrike is up 123%.\n\nUber and Lyft, meanwhile, are down 29% and 38% from their respective listing prices. The two ride-hailing companies have been among the largest of the so-called Unicorn pack to go public this year. Both raised truckloads of capital to finance ambitious expansion plans, but those fundraisings and the inevitable valuation hikes that went with them left little upside for public investors. Uber was privately valued around $76 billion ahead of its IPO in May, while Lyft was valued around $15 billion. Both are now fetching market values below those pre-IPO levels. WeWork, clearly wanting to avoid a similar fate, is now considering a dramatic cut to its last private valuation of $47 billion as it prepares for its own IPO, possibly later this month.\n\nBy contrast, Zoom and CrowdStrike were privately valued at $1 billion and $3 billion, respectively. Those relatively modest starting points plus strong results in the popular cloud software space have made the two highly appealing to public investors\u2014perhaps a bit too appealing. Before Thursday\u2019s reports, Zoom was trading at 40 times forward sales while CrowdStrike was around 36 times. That made them the two most expensive stocks in the cloud software group, in which other highly valued stocks tend to command multiples in the low 20s.\n\nEven strong results left Zoom and CrowdStrike with nowhere to go but down. But those moves will likely be temporary, as both are enjoying strong demand for their respective cloud services. In fact, the two boosted their full-year outlooks on Thursday, with each projecting revenue growth of nearly 80% for the current fiscal year ending in January. Zoom is profitable to boot, unlike most other tech companies at this phase.\n\nPerhaps investors were too enthusiastic, but Zoom and CrowdStrike have shown that leaving a little money on the table isn\u2019t a bad idea.\n\nWrite to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com", "description": "Uber, Lyft and WeWork are stellar examples of what can happen when investors cram too much cash into a company ahead of an initial public offering.
