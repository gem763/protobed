Why? Because they are the stairs that Joaquin Phoenix prances around on in Joker.\n\nGravitysEnemy (@GravitysEnemy) This really a tragedy pic.twitter.com/AsSFoP3cN1\n\nLocals are posting videos of cosplay tourists cluttering up the neighbourhood and are openly tweeting: \u2018PLEASE DO NOT COME HERE\u2019. But it\u2019s too late. The reality is that the staircase has already joined the ranks of other bizarre movie tourist spots.\n\nMaybe: Candy (@_cvndy) It\u2019s really called the Joker Stairs on google now (I just searched it).\n\n\n\nPlease, if you\u2019re reading this and you\u2019re not from around here (or ever been to the Bronx, Yankee stadium does not count) PLEASE DO NOT COME HERE.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nBronx Resident pic.twitter.com/s5u9gVPtyM\n\nHugh Grant\u2019s blue door, London\n\nThe film Notting Hill is 20 years old, but tourists still flock to 280 Westbourne Park Road to catch a glimpse of Grant\u2019s iconic door. More fool them; the real door was sold for charity several years ago.\n\nHumanity\u2019s downfall, Los Angeles\n\nConquest of the Planet of the Apes was the film in which the apes finally destroyed mankind. And they did it in Century City, an oppressive concrete mall built in Los Angeles in 1964.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tourists recreate Harry Potter at King\u2019s Cross station. Photograph: SCFotos - Stuart Crump Visuals //Alamy Stock Photo\n\nKing\u2019s Cross station, London\n\nIn the Harry Potter films, King\u2019s Cross is the magical starting point on the journey to Hogwarts. In real life, King\u2019s Cross is where I have to dodge hundreds of people pretending to run into a wall when I\u2019m trying to get to work.\n\nUN headquarters, Milton Keynes\n\nSuperman IV: The Quest for Peace had a much smaller budget than its predecessors. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the scene outside the UN building, because it was actually shot by Milton Keynes railway station.\n\nPopeye village, Malta\n\nRemember Robert Altman\u2019s 1980 live-action Popeye remake? No, of course you don\u2019t. Nobody does. However, the set built in Malta for the film still stands, and has become one of the island\u2019s major tourist attractions. Want to get married in the place where Robin Williams almost ruined his chance of film stardom? Sure you do.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Don\u2019t come here \u2026 Katz\u2019s Delicatessen. Photograph: PSL Images/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nThe orgasm diner, New York\n\nProbably not a great idea to have your dinner at Katz\u2019s Delicatessen in New York. Sure, tourist guide Zagat claims that its food is second to none, but you\u2019ll have to endure hundreds and hundreds of women faking orgasms there, copying Meg Ryan in When Harry Met Sally.\n\nCanary Wharf tube station, London\n\nWhen the trailer for Rogue One: A Star Wars Story was released in 2016, Londoners were startled to discover that Canary Wharf tube station had been transformed into a home for the most evil entities in the universe. Which, in retrospect, makes quite a lot of sense.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Avengers assemble at the Norman Foster-designed Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts in, um, Norwich. Photograph: Alamy\n\nAvengers HQ, Norwich\n\nThe Grade II-listed Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts was opened in 1978 and contains several thousand works spanning more than 5,000 years of human endeavour. That is not why people go there, though. They go there because it is where the Avengers live, which is far more important.", "description": "Film fans have made major destinations of all sorts of unlikely places, from Hugh Grant\u2019s door in Notting Hill to the delicatessen in which Sally faked a very enthusiastic orgasm", "authors": ["Stuart Heritage"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a312f8d43457a2a0dfcd453ad0d63f0c2dcf528/0_141_3504_2102/master/3504.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5733aa4d4491957fd20ce44f6619638c", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
