R&D expenditure remained steady at SEK9.5 billion.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE", "description": "Ericsson president and CEO said his company has to recognise it failed in the past.", "authors": ["Asha Barbaschow"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/12/03/e4cc1a6f-b836-4b35-94b0-d194c9128aec/thumbnail/770x578/32ffd7996dbe6efa753d92fa1665dbfa/former-dean-foods-chairman-subject-of-sec-us-attorney-s-office-insider-trading-probe-reportsstrictxxl.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
