However, the baby steps taken in other sectors leave masses still to be done.\u201d\n\nThe government has also pledged \u201cground-breaking\u201d plans to end emissions by 2050 across all modes of transport, the sector which is now the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases across the UK. The plan is being developed and will be completed next year.\n\nHowever, Greenpeace said new petrol and diesel cars should be phased out by 2030. It also recommends the government introduces a strategy to reduce demand for aviation, including no Heathrow expansion.\n\nCurrently the government has said it is pursuing \u201csustainable growth\u201d of the aviation industry.\n\nDr Parr said transport remains one of the government\u2019s biggest black spots.\n\nBusiness and energy secretary Andrea Leadsom said: \u201cFour months ago the UK took the bold step of becoming the first country in the developed world to put into law our ambition to wipe out the UK\u2019s contribution to climate change by 2050, following the CCC\u2019s advice. This builds on our long and proud track record of leadership \u2013 since 1990 we\u2019ve cut our greenhouse gas emissions by 42 per cent while growing our economy by more than two-thirds.\n\n\u201cMore than half of our electricity currently comes from low-carbon sources. And we will keep on going further and faster to ensure our action meets our ambition.\u201d\n\nDr Parr also said there needed to be more spending in delivering net zero emissions.\n\nHe said: \u201cTotal spending must be increased by an additional \u00a325bn a year, taking investment on the climate emergency to five per cent of government spending. We have an opportunity in the upcoming budget for ministers to put their money where their mouth is. Actions speak louder than words.\u201d", "description": "The government has promised to\u00a0go \u201cfurther and faster\u201d to\u00a0cut\u00a0greenhouse gases after its annual progress report warned current policies and plans are insufficient to meet targets to cut emissions in the 2020s and 2030s.
