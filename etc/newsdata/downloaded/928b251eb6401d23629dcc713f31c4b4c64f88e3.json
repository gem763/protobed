It is increasingly used across the communications industry and in many other important sectors of the economy,\u201d the statement continues. \u201cWe strongly oppose government attempts to build backdoors because they would undermine the privacy and security of people everywhere.\u201d\n\nEncryption protects messages from surveillance, and companies that use it are unable to access the contents of their users\u2019 messages. Law enforcement officials have criticized the use of the technology over the years because it prevents them from accessing suspects' communications, even when they have a subpoena.\n\nIn the open letter to be published on Friday, the four leaders demanded that Facebook enable \u201claw enforcement to obtain lawful access to content in a readable and usable format.\u201d\n\nBut Silicon Valley and digital rights activists have pushed back on government efforts to create a so-called \u201cback door\u201d for law enforcement access to encrypted messaging services, arguing that it would compromise user privacy and give authoritarian-style surveillance powers to the government.\n\nIn a blog post earlier this year, Zuckerberg said that the company would be implementing encryption in all of the private messaging services under its umbrella, though he acknowledged that the company had a responsibility to work with law enforcement.\n\n\u201cOn balance, I believe working towards implementing end-to-end encryption for all private communications is the right thing to do,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote. \u201cMessages and calls are some of the most sensitive private conversations people have, and in a world of increasing cyber security threats and heavy-handed government intervention in many countries, people want us to take the extra step to secure their most private data.\u201d\n\nOpen Letter to Mark Zuckerberg by M Mali on Scribd", "description": "The Trump administration is planning to urge Facebook to hold off on incorporating end-to-end encryption across its various messaging services until the company can address \u201cpublic safety\u201d issues with law enforcement agencies around the world.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/barrwilliam_050919gn3_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
