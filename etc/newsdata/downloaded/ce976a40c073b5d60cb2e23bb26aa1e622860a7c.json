McDonald\u2019s said Tuesday it agreed to acquire early stage voiced-based tech company Apprente. The tech startup\u2019s technology means consumers will eventually speak to a machine, rather than a human, when ordering at a McDonald\u2019s drive-thru.\n\nIn late March McDonald\u2019s acquired Dynamic Yield. The technology creates suggested items for the drive-thru menu board based on time of day, weather, current restaurant traffic and trending orders. McDonald\u2019s plans to have the technology up and running at all 14,000 plus U.S.-locations and Australia by year end.\n\nThe tech acquisitions are very logical, say pros Yahoo Finance have talked up.\n\nThe McDonald\u2019s drive-thru represents a commanding 70% of its overall business. It\u2019s becoming an increasingly important sales driver as ever hurried people detest getting out of their cars to pick up food. So, the drive-thru ordering process has to be on point, or else McDonald\u2019s risks returning to its dark days of weak store traffic.\n\n\u201cIt makes sense, it should help reduce the bottlenecks at the point of ordering,\u201d veteran restaurant analyst Peter Saleh of BTIG tells Yahoo Finance, referring to the Apprente purchase. Saleh says it should bolster consumer perception on the McDonald\u2019s dining experience. And with that, comes the potential to drive increased visits to the restaurant giant.\n\nMeanwhile, tech out of Dynamic Yield should assist in lifting the average amount each consumer buys per visit, Saleh thinks.\n\nKeeping ahead of rivals\n\nAbove all else, McDonald\u2019s outright acquisitions of these tech outfits gives it a competitive advantage relative to others in the fast-food space. McDonald\u2019s in effect now owns advanced technology competitors don\u2019t, forcing them to either develop it themselves or find second-tier acquisitions \u2014 both costly and risky.\n\nSaleh says McDonald\u2019s strong financial position is allowing them to pull the trigger on these tech purchases.\n\nA patron looks at the menu at McDonald's in Williamsville, N.Y. (AP Photo/David Duprey) More\n\nEven without the drive-thru tech infusion, McDonald\u2019s has shown progress this year on speeding up its often jam-packed drive-thru. The company has reduced the number of items on the menu and re-trained workers in an effort to get the average drive-thru time down to 30 seconds. It\u2019s unclear if McDonald\u2019s has hit that magic time yet, but it\u2019s moving in that direction.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing drive-thru times dropping almost all of our major international markets, and notably here in the U.S. as well,\u201d McDonald\u2019s CEO Steve Easterbrook told analysts on the second quarter earnings call.\n\nTech will help do the rest.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-host of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
