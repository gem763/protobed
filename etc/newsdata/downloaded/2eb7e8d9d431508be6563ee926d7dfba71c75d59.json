There Just Isn't A Clear Plan To Do It.", "language": "en", "text": "Leaders of the new left have a tricky 2020 objective: taking down Joe Biden.\n\nThe former vice president insists he\u2019s one of them. \u201cI have the most progressive record of anybody running,\u201d he said last week at a Democratic Party dinner in Delaware, his home state, before quickly clarifying that he hadn\u2019t yet decided to run for president.\n\nBut to the progressives driving the party toward a younger and ideologically purer end, that wasn\u2019t what screamed out for a correction. Biden, 76, has a long history of Senate votes and public statements and bipartisan friendships at odds with their movement \u2014 a movement that is expected to play a significant role in the Democratic primaries.\n\n\u201cA lot of people have a fondness toward Joe Biden because of his time in the Obama White House,\u201d said Maurice Mitchell, national director for the Working Families Party. \u201cThat\u2019s quaint and nice. People owe him a fondness. Now this is primetime, and he wants to put his hat in the ring to be the person who has the nuclear codes, the person who is going to transform our country after Trump has brought all this disarray. So there\u2019s going to be a great deal of new scrutiny placed on his record, and there should be.\u201d\n\nAlready in the months-long run-up to his anticipated campaign, Biden has expressed regret for supporting anti-crime legislation that disproportionately punished minorities and for his dismissiveness toward Anita Hill\u2019s sexual harassment accusations against Clarence Thomas during Thomas\u2019s Supreme Court confirmation hearings. There also have been reminders of how he opposed school integration 45 years ago and of his eulogy for Strom Thurmond, who rose to political prominence as a segregationist. More recently he found himself on the defensive after calling Vice President Mike Pence, who\u2019s known for pushing anti-gay policies, a \u201cdecent guy.\u201d\n\nBiden often tops polls of the Democratic field and would enter the race as the early frontrunner. Mitchell and other liberal activists who spoke to BuzzFeed News are preparing to make sure he peaks on announcement day by emphasizing the parts of Biden\u2019s record they find insufficiently progressive. At the moment, their plans are vague promises and warnings that they will raise objections publicly. It\u2019s less clear how coordinated these efforts might be, or if they\u2019ll have enough money to make much of a dent. And there\u2019s some disagreement over how big of a threat Biden really is.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s going to be a lot less air in the room than it looks like for Biden,\u201d said Charles Chamberlain, who chairs Democracy for America, the group that grew out of Howard Dean\u2019s presidential campaign 15 years ago. \u201cThe reality is that Biden\u2019s time is passed.\u201d\n\nThat kind of confidence worries Sean McElwee, cofounder of the Data for Progress think tank and purveyor of the \"Abolish ICE\" rallying cry that has electrified many Democrats.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that progressives are overestimating how much this will hurt him,\u201d he said. \u201cI see Biden as the Democratic Trump. He has a pretty strong lead in the polls. He\u2019s not really someone who anyone in the party elite is most excited for. Everyone just sort of believes that all this baggage he has will \u2018hashtag\u2019 cancel him from the race. Maybe. Possibly. But the governor of Virginia also had a blackface scandal, and no one talks about that anymore.\u201d\n\nMcElwee is emerging as one of Biden\u2019s most strident critics on the left: \u201cdoes joe biden have a long track record of progressive policy? no,\u201d he tweeted this week. \u201cdoes joe biden spend every day working to atone for decades of enabling racist, sexist and pro-corporate policies? also no.\u201d\n\nA Biden spokesperson declined to comment for this story.\n\nSen. Chris Coons, a Biden ally who holds his old Senate seat in Delaware, emphasized Biden\u2019s past efforts on climate change and his support for LGBTQ rights in an interview with BuzzFeed News. (Biden and many other Democrats in the 1990s voted for the Defense of Marriage Act, which defined marriage as between a man and a woman. As vice president, Biden famously got out ahead of Obama and to announce his support for marriage equality.)\n\n\u201cIf folks want to get into fights over votes he cast 30 and 40 years ago and ignore things that President Trump literally said or did yesterday, and the ways in which Joe Biden is the right person to look forward and pull us into a better future as a country, that\u2019s their prerogative,\u201d said Coons, who plans to endorse Biden if he runs. \"But I don\u2019t think that\u2019ll work in the end.\u201d\n\nEven as he asserts that he\u2019s the most progressive 2020 hopeful, Biden does not shy away from his more centrist tendencies. He wasn\u2019t happy about having to walk back the Pence compliment and has at times sounded incredulous over the notion that his relationships with Republicans could be seen as anything other than assets. His allies cite this crossover appeal when arguing that he is the most electable Democrat, the best positioned to beat Trump.\n\nThrough his think tank, McElwee plans to conduct a poll that examines whether a Biden-versus-Trump election will turn off \u201cthe next generation of voters.\u201d The data, which McElwee said he will share regardless of whether it validates his opinion of Biden, could provide some direction for the progressive groups eager to prevent him from winning the party\u2019s nomination.\n\nOfficials at Justice Democrats, a progressive group that played a significant role in 2018\u2019s elections and is closely tied to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, are contemplating 2020 messaging that would shame Democrats seen as too cozy with big business \u2014 Biden\u2019s support for and from the financial industry is a likely topic for scrutiny \u2014 and with Republicans.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also going to name the people that are responsible for the mess that we\u2019re in,\u201d said Alexandra Rojas, the group\u2019s executive director. \u201cWe definitely want to spread the message that [Biden] represents the centrist wing of the Democratic Party that is radically out of touch.\u201d\n\nMitchell, whose Working Families Party endorsed Bernie Sanders in the 2016 primaries, said WFP will evaluate all candidates and their records before backing anyone for 2020. He listed several issues he sees as working against Biden, from his opposition to busing as a means of integrating schools in the 1970s to the crime bill and Anita Hill.\n\n\u201cDuring one of these primary debates, he will be the only candidate who was on the wrong side of school segregation,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWhen he could have intervened for working people, when he could have intervened for women, for people of color, in these cases he chose not to.\u201d\n\nAsked how the WFP would raise these concerns \u2014 Paid advertising? Social media? Pushing for coverage from news outlets? In private with the candidates and their staff? \u2014 Mitchell replied: \u201cAll of the above. We\u2019re going to engage on the staff levels with the candidates, in person, and in public. We believe these issues and this debate needs to be aired publicly.\u201d\n\nDemocracy for America\u2019s Chamberlain is similarly harsh on Biden but also suggested that DFA\u2019s messaging would not be explicitly hostile. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to need to do it quite like that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be running a positive campaign, but one that includes tough questions.\u201d\n\nChamberlain believes Biden would do well to follow the lead of Sen. Sherrod Brown, who this month decided against a presidential run after visiting the first four caucus and primary states. Brown, otherwise a well-established liberal from Ohio, declined to embrace new left causes like Medicare for All and the Green New Deal \u2014 positions that sometimes disappointed the early-state activists he met.\n\n\u201cSherrod Brown is a very smart, talented person,\u201d Chamberlain said. \u201cHe gets it. When he heard a pin drop when he said something like that, he said, \u2018This isn\u2019t the year for me.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not exactly how Brown framed his decision not to run; he said he\u2019d find more joy fighting for his causes in the Senate. (A popular theory is that Biden scared off Brown by informing him of his imminent candidacy, but Brown and his allies have denied this.) If anything, Brown\u2019s flirtations with a White House bid foreshadowed a way to compete against Biden while subtly emphasizing his problematic votes.\n\nBrown, in an interview days before passing on the 2020 race, reminded BuzzFeed News how he voted against the North American Free Trade Agreement, against DOMA, and against the Iraq War. Biden voted for all three, though Brown said he had no plans to draw such contrasts directly.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to make them,\u201d he said. \u201cI think people will see a long-term progressive commitment from me.\u201d", "description": "There's a progressive faction of the Democratic Party that's very much against Joe Biden for president.
