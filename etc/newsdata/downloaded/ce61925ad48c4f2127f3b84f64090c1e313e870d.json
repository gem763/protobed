People on the left [say] 'You know that he's a racist'. I don't know what's in his heart, but I'll tell you what I disagree with Donald Trump on \u2014 I disagree with his tone, his tenor because we are all Americans. We are all fighting for the same thing. And I know that the president wants everybody's respect, but to get respect you also have to give respect.\"\n\nORRIN HATCH: JOE BIDEN TOLD ME HE 'DIDN'T BELIEVE' ANITA HILL\n\n\u201cI often call the president out when he tweets, or he says \u2018they should go back to where they come from\u2019 when they are American citizens and so, yes, I am very vocal,\u201d Brazile said.\n\nBrazile went on to say that she prefers to focus on the policies and actions of the Trump administration, rather than simply calling the president a racist day after day.\n\n\"To personally go out there each and every day and say, 'The President of the United States is a racist, therefore I do not wish to discuss his policies, his actions, his tweets,' that in my view is a wrongheaded approach,\" she said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to major in the minors by basically calling out people.
