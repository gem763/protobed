But doctors still need to help them interpret the information they collect.\n\nLast year, Dr. Jeremy Bock, a cardiologist at the Virginia Hospital Center Physician Group (VHC), saw a new patient who was frustrated with his medical care.\n\nThe man, in his fifties, had been having heart palpitations on and off for a few years, Bock said. He\u2019d been to other specialists, who had given him a device to monitor his heart rate over a prescribed period of time. The tool was uncomfortable for the patient and the episodes never happened when he was wearing his monitor\u2014so nobody discovered any anomalies.\n\nBock had a different idea. The patient had gotten a smartwatch and wore it all the time\u2014it was easy and functional, and he liked it. Bock told him to simply enable the watch\u2019s EKG monitoring tool, which could more regularly monitor the patient\u2019s heart rate and collect the data in a single place, where Bock could later review it.\n\nAfter culling more precise information about the man\u2019s heart rate for a short time, Bock was able to spot something that no other doctor had noticed before: an irregular heartbeat. Bock put him on an appropriate medication for the issue, \u201cand he hasn\u2019t had a repeat episode since.\u201d said Bock.\n\nThanks to popular new technologies, this type of story is becoming increasingly common. Wearables, apps and other developments have allowed patients to embrace \u201cparticipatory health[1],\u201d a model that involves them playing an active role in their treatment. And as Americans become increasingly savvy about their well-being, healthcare professionals are working to make the most of the data that these technologies collect.\n\nBeing strategic\n\nAs a top trend this year, according to Expert Review of Medical Devices journal, consumer-facing technology has the power to address some of the most common health issues in the United States.\n\nHeart monitors can help keep track of impending heart disease; fitness and BMI trackers can help address obesity; glucose-monitoring apps and devices can assist diabetics with their insulin levels. And in the future, technology may even be able to assist people with Parkinson\u2019s, kidney disease and respiratory disease.\n\nBut the promise of these advancements depends on communication between a patient and a healthcare provider.\n\n\u201cA wearable is going to measure your EKG or your steps or your blood, but you have to figure out what to do with that information,\u201d said Albert H. Titus, PhD, professor and chair of biomedical engineering at the University at Buffalo. If a wearable is collecting data from your body, \u201csomething has to happen to that data to make it usable.\u201d\n\nThat \u201csomething\u201d is a professional interpreting the information based on what they know about the patient\u2014and what they know about health in general.\n\nAlice Greenwood, a nurse practitioner at the VHC Physician Group, recently uncovered the cause of a patient\u2019s chronic migraines by interpreting her health data. The patient happened to track her periods on a smartphone app. The data collected on the app, combined with the fact that periods can be linked to intense headaches, led Greenwood to diagnose the patient with menstrual migraines.\n\nThe everyday person may not know the connection between migraines and most other medical patterns and phenomena, for that matter, and would have a hard time making connections between their data and what it means.\n\nSo Greenwood noted that, while it\u2019s important for people to track their health, eat well and exercise, it doesn\u2019t take the place of visiting the doctor. Technology, after all, can\u2019t draw labs or listen to a patient\u2019s heart or lungs, and it can\u2019t infer things based on the data that it collects.\n\nThings can happen\u2026[Technology] doesn\u2019t take the place of having good primary care, Greenwood said.\n\n(Not) under pressure\n\nWhile many patients revel in tracking their health stats, there are others who find large amounts of data too overwhelming. Dr. Christopher Walsh, an internist and Chief of Primary Care, with the VHC Physician Group, reminds people who are prone to anxiety that wearables and apps are fundamentally a tool: \u201cJust like stethoscopes and computers, they\u2019re great for getting people engaged and aligned with their goals.\u201d\n\nBut when patients turn to the wrong sources in order to interpret that data, it can exacerbate their stress\u2014stumbling across inaccuracies about the cause of someone\u2019s symptoms, he said, can lead to their imagination running wild.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, there\u2019s [a lot of] misinformation out there in the world\u2014and healthcare is not immune to that,\u201d said Walsh. A clinician can help patients sort through the data and separate the pros from the cons, the evidence from the speculation.\n\nBock agrees that there are some people who can become fixated on tracking their health, but overall he thinks that the abundance of wearable-generated data is a good thing. Before people can take action about their health and seek professional help, they have to know there\u2019s a problem to begin with, or be aware of what risks they may face. The ideal situation, he said, is finding a balance between being aware of what\u2019s going on in your body, \u201cbut not being obsessive about it.\u201d\n\nAnd monitoring your own health shouldn\u2019t get in the way of day-to-day living, Bock said. Just as we keep track of our finances, looking at what we earn and what we spend, we shouldn\u2019t let it control us.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to live a little bit,\u201d Bock said. \u201cYou can\u2019t be so focused on your health that you don\u2019t have fun every once in a while.\u201d\n\nThe value of connection\n\nThe need for better connections between patients and their doctors is well documented. Indeed, one survey found that 55 percent of patients believe their medical history is sometimes missing or incomplete when they visit the doctor.[2]\n\nFortunately, as technology continues to change and improve human life in a wide number of areas, healthcare is no exception. And it\u2019s not just patients who are increasingly connected. It\u2019s doctors, too\u2014and ideally, entire hospitals.\n\nTitus believes that this ever-growing aggregation of health data \u201cwill provide broader information for overall diagnoses,\u201d not only for the individual but also collectively. That\u2019s why VHC isn\u2019t satisfied with simply helping patients understand their own health stats\u2014it also uses technology like its Epic electronic health record system to help all VHC doctors know their patients\u2019 complete histories.\n\nThat unification of data, Walsh said\u2014knowing whether a patient has been to the ED recently or was on a certain medicine, for instance\u2014makes it easier to navigate someone\u2019s health narrative.\n\n\u201cIt becomes reassuring to the patient [whenever] they go see somebody,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cIt\u2019s just better care.\u201d\n\nLearn more about cutting-edge primary care at Virginia Hospital Center.\n\n________________________\n\nMore Content from Virginia Hospital Center:\n\nThe importance of making advanced-age pregnancy safer\n\nIn Virginia, a less invasive approach to a widespread pain problem\n\nOne Hospital\u2019s evidence-based approach to reducing C-section rates", "description": "Information from wearables and apps can lead to better and faster diagnoses (Partner Content)", "authors": ["Wp Brandstudio"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/brand-studio/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/offset_comp_480852-1500.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
