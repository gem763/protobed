Grief, when unaddressed, can cloud judgement, inhibit creativity and engender a sense that there is no way forward,\u201d he said.\n\nAuthors of the letter say environmental scientists often respond to the degradation of the natural world by suppressing or denying painful emissions while at work.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

In these fields, employees are trained to anticipate and manage emotional distress with training, support and counselling.\n\nDr Steve Simpson of the University of Exeter, also a co-writer of the letter, said: \u201cInstead of ignoring or suppressing our grief, environmental scientists should be acknowledging, accepting and working through it.\n\n\u201cIn doing so, we can use grief to strengthen our resolve and find ways to understand and protect ecosystems that still have a chance of survival in our rapidly changing world.\u201d\n\nThe IPCC report has warned that humanity urgently needs to change the way it consumes resources to avoid catastrophic levels of climate warming.\n\nIn 2018, the report warned that we faced major environmental catastrophe within our lifetimes, and potentially as soon as 2040.\n\nAlmost 70 per cent of British people want urgent political action, but there is a growing gap between announcements on climate change and the implementation of policies.\n\nDr Gordon said: \u201cIf we\u2019re serious about finding any sort of future for our natural ecosystems, we need to avoid getting trapped in cycles of grief. We need to allow ourselves to cry \u2013 and then see beyond our tears.\u201d", "description": "The ecological disaster is taking its toll on scientists\u2019 mental health, with top researchers saying those\u00a0working in the field must be supported and \u201callowed to cry\u201d.\u00a0 Leading researchers have published a letter saying many scientists experience \u201cstrong grief responses\u201d to the ecological crisis and there are profound risks of ignoring this emotional trauma.", "authors": ["Phoebe Weston"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/10/11/grief.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
