And he\u2019s been going back and forth with UFC light heavyweight champ Jones, who hasn\u2019t minced words when speaking about \u201cThe Last Stylebender,\u201d accusing him of having a false sense of confidence.\n\nNaturally, that didn\u2019t sit well with Adesanya (18-0 MMA, 7-0 UFC), who believes Jones (25-1 MMA, 19-1 UFC) is just intimidated by him and his rise in the sport.\n\n\u201cHe is jealous,\u201d Adesanya said Monday on \u201cAriel Helwani\u2019s MMA Show\u201d. \u201cHe sees the freshman that\u2019s taking all the shine. He sees the guy that\u2019s the new dog in the yard, and they\u2019re intimidated. They\u2019re jealous. They don\u2019t know how to act. He\u2019s always been a fan. He\u2019s still a fan, I know he\u2019s a fan. He\u2019s always trying to do what he does, and I\u2019m like just wait your turn.\u201d\n\nSince entering the UFC in February 2018, Adesanya has kept an active pace by competing seven times. As champ, he vows to actively defend his belt rather than chase two belts right out of the gate.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to be one of those guys that doesn\u2019t defend his belt,\u201d Adesanya said. \u201cI\u2019m going to defend my belt actively. I\u2019m not going to be like him (Jones) and fight twice a year. They\u2019re all trying to copy my (expletive), so let me just defend my belt first, and then I\u2019ll move up, and I come (expletive) him up.\u201d\n\nBut Adesanya won\u2019t fall into any traps. There\u2019s already a fight with Paulo Costa on the table, as well as several top ranked middleweights looking to get their shot.\n\n\u201cThis guy, he\u2019s trying to force my hand,\u201d Adesanya said. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to force my hand, and I\u2019m not stupid. It\u2019s not about oh I\u2019m not confident. Trust me, I\u2019m confident. Trust me, I\u2019ll (expletive) this mother(expletive) when I fight him. I just have to do what I have to do. I have to defend my belt. I\u2019ve just defended my belt. I\u2019m the new unified king. There\u2019s three more killers, four more killers I have to (expletive) up at middleweight first, and then I\u2019ll move up in weight. Then I\u2019ll jump up and (expletive) this guy like \u2013 I can\u2019t wait.\u201d\n\nAdesanya continued, \u201cI\u2019ve planned everything from the jump. I\u2019ve showed everyone this is what I\u2019m going to do and this is how I\u2019m going to do it, and I already said \u2018Raiders Stadium, Las Vegas, 2021.\u2019\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just trying to take my moment. You can\u2019t even (expletive) with me right now. Look at me. Who\u2019s the new face of the UFC? You think Jon Jones could ever pull (expletive) like that?\u201d", "description": "Israel Adesanya has his UFC middleweight title reign mapped out, and he won't let Jon Jones get in the way of anything.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Simon Head", "Nolan King", "Brian Garcia", "Matt Erickson", "Ken Hathaway", "George Garcia"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/israel-adesanya-robert-whittaker-ufc-243-8.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
