It also reiterated its outlook for fiscal 2020, which calls for revenue of $650 million to $700 million and adjusted Ebitda of $88 million to $95 million.\n\nShares were trading up 13 per cent after the opening bell.\n\nNotably, revenue from recreational cannabis sales rose 8 per cent quarter-over-quarter to $20 million. The increase comes as other companies like Canopy Growth Corp. have reported sales declines. Hexo Corp. withdrew its guidance for fiscal 2020 last week, citing slower-than-expected store openings, a delay in government approval for new products and early signs of pricing pressure.\n\nAphria\u2019s New York-listed shares jumped in pre-market trading. Prior to Tuesday, they had lost about 16 per cent since the beginning of the month amid broader weakness in pot stocks.\n\n\u201cWe believe the reaction is due to industry sentiment (and valuations) near all-time lows, making an in-line quarter very well received by many industry investors,\u201d CIBC analyst John Zamparo said in a note.\n\nOther cannabis producers also joined in the gains, with the ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF adding 3.8 per cent. Tilray Inc. rose 3.3 per cent, Cronos Group Inc. gained 3 per cent, Canopy was up 2.6 per cent and Aurora Cannabis Inc. added 2.3 per cent.\n\nAphria has posted a remarkable turnaround since late last year, when it was the target of short sellers who accused it of paying inflated prices to buy Latin American assets from insiders. That resulted in the ousting of Chief Executive Officer Vic Neufeld, who was replaced on an interim basis by Irwin Simon, who previously ran Hain Celestial Group Inc.\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "Aphria has posted a remarkable turnaround since late last year", "authors": ["Kristine Owram", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/aphria.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
