But, slowly the news flow on this expected Modi-Trump Trade Deal looks to be faded shortly in the absence of any further news flow on developments on this . Nifty 50 started to witness exhaustive moves, soon after the formation of an \u201cExhaustive Candle\u201d in the weekly time frame.\n\nOn the other hand, Sino-U.S. tariff trade deal also looks to be amid dilemma too, after the on resolving this issue before the October 10th \u2013 11th , 2019 meeting between the U.S. and the China; which has resulted in growing slowdown fear, causing extended bearishness in U.S. equity indices and well in other Asian equity markets. No doubt that the growing hopes on final resolution over the Sino-U.S. tariff trade war resulted in some downward move in , but once again Gold looks ready to bounce once again; which enhances the probabilities of the growing fear of economic slowdown.\n\nFinally, I conclude that if the starts the trading session on October 9th, 2019 with a gap-down, and remains below the level of 11,100; it may trigger a heavy sell-off during the upcoming trading sessions. No doubt, if Nifty 50 remains unable to defend its immediate support at 10,946; a steep downward move may be the next possibility.
