Money markets saw funding shortages Monday and Tuesday, driving the rate on one-day loans backed by Treasury bonds -- known as repurchase agreements, or repos -- as high as 10%.\n\n\u201cThe Fed\u2019s got the tools to solve these short-term problems, and I don\u2019t think they ripple through to the basic economy,\u201d Tony James, executive vice chairman at the New York-based private-equity firm, said on Bloomberg TV in Sydney. \u201cThese are more of interest to dealers and trading markets than the real economy.\u201d\n\nFed overnight system repos were once a regular part of the central bank\u2019s operations, but were discontinued as the Fed expanded its balance sheet during and after the financial crisis.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the repo market is broken at all,\u201d James said. \u201cThis kind of thing used to be common. They haven\u2019t had to do it in a long time, but I think it\u2019s important to remember the rate spike looks very scary but it\u2019s only overnight. So the actual cost to the system is not high; it\u2019s more of a concern to dealers -- it\u2019s a technical problem.\u201d\n\nJames added that he wasn\u2019t surprised the Fed stepped in to ensure stability. What\u2019s less clear is how the central bank manages its balance sheet over time. The Fed called a halt to shrinking its bond holdings earlier this year.\n\n\u201cThe winding down of that balance is a whole other issue -- my own view is that will be with them a long time,\u201d he said.\n\n--With assistance from Shery Ahn, Andy Clarke and Peter Vercoe.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Adam Haigh in Sydney at ahaigh1@bloomberg.net;Paul Allen in Sydney at pallen32@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Christopher Anstey at canstey@bloomberg.net, Andreea Papuc\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Action from the Federal Reserve to calm money markets this week isn\u2019t a sign of a systemic problem that will affect the economy, according to a senior executive at Blackstone Group Inc.The Fed bought $53.2 billion of securities on Tuesday and said it would conduct another overnight repo", "authors": ["Adam Haigh", "Paul Allen"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/XOBz.mx2V1SDbH0NNhyQFQ--~B/aD0yNjY3O3c9NDAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/cd971d4fa1df07b966e0dc3300015e77", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
