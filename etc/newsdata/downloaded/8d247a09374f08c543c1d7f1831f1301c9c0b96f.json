Joe Walsh (R-IL), who recently announced a long-shot primary bid against Trump, the Fox host took issue with Walsh\u2019s insistence that Trump is a pathological liar, asking the ex-congressman for specifics.\n\nWalsh, meanwhile, pointed to recent reports that White House aides have admitted that the president recently faked high-level phone calls with China regarding trade in an effort to boost markets, something Varney claimed doesn\u2019t count as a lie.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a lie,\u201d Varney exclaimed. \u201cIf the man said and he did that high-level talks had been held with China, that is not a lie. They were held with China.\u201d\n\n\u201cStuart, he said there were high-level phone calls with Chinese officials, his staff admitted that was not true, that he lied in order to manipulate the market,\u201d Walsh retorted, prompting Varney to wave him off.\n\n\u201cGive me another one,\u201d the pro-Trump anchor huffed.\n\nWalsh, however, pushed back, asking Varney if he genuinely didn\u2019t believe that was a lie. When the Fox Business host insisted he did not and personally objected to Walsh calling it one, the former Republican lawmaker then wondered if Varney actually believed if Trump has ever fibbed.\n\n\u201cStuart, do you believe this president lies?\u201d Walsh asked.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Varney replied.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t believe he\u2019s ever lied?\u201d Walsh shot back in disbelief.\n\n\u201cHe exaggerates and spins,\u201d the Fox host retorted.\n\n\u201cOkay. Do you believe he\u2019s ever told the American people a lie?\u201d Walsh pressed again.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Varney stated.\n\nFrom there, Varney tried to flip it back around on Walsh, asking him if he lied when he said President Barack Obama was a Muslim, causing Walsh to admit it was a lie and that he\u2019s apologized for that.\n\nVarney\u2019s delusional declaration that the president\u2014who has told at least 12,000 lies and false statement since entering the White House\u2014has never lied comes on the heels of Trump 2020 campaign spokesperson Kayleigh McEnany saying the same thing on CNN earlier this week, flooring CNN anchor Chris Cuomo.", "description": "The pro-Trump host\u2019s claim comes on the heels of a campaign flack also insisting that the president has never lied.", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_360,w_640,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567181882/varney-company_9_qnvv7p"}
