When I was a suburban teen punk it was my lifeline to the thrilling possibilities of the city. I wrote this sloppy ode to the 95's charms for my zine in 1997 (age 17) and it's the oldest story in my book. RIP to a real one <a href=\"https://t.co/NvUm4xJHNL\">pic.twitter.com/NvUm4xJHNL</a> \u2014@ghost_pine\n\nRiders suggest tribute\n\nSince it launched in 1980, the No. 95 has been extended many times and now runs from the Trim Road park-and-ride lot in Orl\u00e9ans, through downtown, all the way to the Minto Recreation Complex in Barrhaven.\n\nThe route has been the muse for at least three songs, but riders think it needs another tribute.\n\nGiancarlo Maggiore was waiting for it at its eastern starting point this week to get to university, and says he has ridden the route his whole life.\n\n\"It's kind of sad. It would be nice if they retired the number and no other bus could take the 95, like when a [sports] player retires.\"\n\nLaura Shantz wants to see it raised to the rafters, too. She's grateful to the many drivers who spent hours behind the wheel.\n\n\"I've never had a car and they really were my personal chauffeurs for a lot of years and I really appreciate that.\"\n\nLeiper's life line\n\nCoun. Jeff Leiper, for one, plans to be on that last run in the wee hours of Sunday morning to see the No. 95 travel over the Mackenzie King Bridge one last time.\n\n\"It's served all of the destinations that have kind of defined my life,\" he explained. \"The 95 was the bus that took us as teenagers from sleepy, suburban Orl\u00e9ans down to exciting downtown.\"\n\nIt was more than a route. It was the Wrath of Khan at the Rideau Centre, cramming 20 more minutes for a final in the gym at Montpetit, and getting out of the dish-pit to get to Hull with a couple of hours left to dance with friends... \u2014@JLeiper\n\nLater, Leiper rode the No. 95 to jobs as a young man, ran to catch it after late-night dancing in Hull, and used it to take his toddler to child care or a packed trip to Canada Day celebrations.\n\nBut Ottawa has outgrown the time when it could serve residents only with crosstown buses, and he's excited for the age of light rail. Still, he sees the end of an era.\n\n\"All of us used it. It was the bus that really served Generation X. I'm sorry to see it go,\" he said.", "description": "The No. 95 bus, OC Transpo's busiest route that has carried residents through the city and through the decades, will be retired in the early hours of Sunday morning.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5308259.1570140495!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/number-95-bus-route-oc-transpo-transit-ottawa.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
