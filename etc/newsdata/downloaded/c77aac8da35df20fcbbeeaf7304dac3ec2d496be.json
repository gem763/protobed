I am tough, but I\u2019m smart.\u201d\n\nIt was New Zealand-born Australian Whittaker\u2019s first fight since June 2018 in Chicago. The 28-year-old Whittaker was scheduled to fight in February but withdrew due to emergency bowel surgery.\n\nWhittaker\u2019s UFC world-title defense was the first by an Australian.\n\nAdesanya, 30, has improved his UFC record to 7-0.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Interim champion Israel Adesanya has dethroned UFC middleweight champion Robert Whittaker with a stunning knockout in the second round of their highly anticipated 185-pound unification bout which headlined UFC 243 at Melbourne's Docklands Stadium on Saturday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Greg Buckle"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
