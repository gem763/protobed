But if we end up at a general election then I think we need to be straightforward with people and give them an option for all this Brexit chaos to stop.\n\n\u201cBut if instead we find ourselves in an election it would be bizarre for us to suggest that the main issue of that election will be anything other than Brexit.\u201d\n\nSwinson, who has ruled out working with either Jeremy Corbyn or Boris Johnson after an election, said: \u201cI think people want politicians to be straightforward with where they stand. I recognise that not everyone agrees with the Lib Dems on this.\n\n\u201cBut I think they recognise also that we are being straightforward about our position. It\u2019s what we genuinely think is right for the country, and people should have that chance to choose that outcome.\u201d\n\nSpeaking earlier on Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday show, Gyimah said the Conservative party had changed.\n\n\u201cThe stark reality is that I had to face up to the fact that the Tory party is in a different place,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I want to stand up for liberal values, then the Conservative party is no longer the place to do that.\u201d", "description": "Delegates at annual conference agree to revoke article 50 if party wins election", "authors": ["Peter Walker", "Jonathan Freedland", "Ell Smith"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/520dfb01b49f59bf60e4bd4f9d148a7f0a3fd4ce/0_161_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c0bd59c5f98eef5449269d02068440fa", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
