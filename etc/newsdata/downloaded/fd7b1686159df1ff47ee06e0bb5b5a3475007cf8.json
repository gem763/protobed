Adding to the pain, he\u2019d been slugged another A$2,500 as a transaction fee.\n\nSome sleuthing revealed that instead of entering 5.50 pounds ($6.78), bar staff charged him 55,000 pounds for a single beer.\n\nThe operator of the bar, the Malmaison Hotel, was not immediately available for comment, but a spokeswoman told the Guardian newspaper it was investigating.\n\nLalor said the funds were drained from his mortgage offset account and he was surprised not have received any notification from his bank, which he did not name.\n\nThe transaction fee has already been refunded, but Lalor will have a \u201cmassive hole\u201d in his finances for the nine working days it will take the larger amount to be returned.\n\nAs for the quality of the ale itself, which has won a number of awards, Lalor was ambivalent: \u201cIt was good, but not that good.\u201d", "description": "An Australian cricket journalist in Britain for the Ashes test series is claiming to have drunk \"the most expensive beer in history\" after being charged nearly A$100,000 ($68,120) for the tipple.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
