He will not have needed exhaustive entries.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that sort of game. Big men, kicking, mostly. With 30 minutes remaining the amount of football had already exceeded that played in England\u2019s meeting with New Zealand the previous day.\n\nEddie Jones wouldn\u2019t have minded that. He would have appreciated the absence of surprise in this match, too, and its bruising, competitive closeness. Maybe he will have approved of the outcome, also.\n\nEddie Jones was spotted in the stands on Sunday as he scouted South Africa ahead of the final\n\nAn England-Wales final could have been quite random, the way meetings between the nations often are. And Warren Gatland is a wily competitor, as he proved with the British and Irish Lions in New Zealand. He has a way of staying in games that lends itself to unpredictability much as Wales did here.\n\nWith an injury list mounting game by game \u2014 two off in the first half yesterday, to add to the five first-team names already down \u2014 somehow Wales contrived to tie the scores 16-16 with 15 minutes remaining. It was a magnificent feat of endurance, even if it didn\u2019t always make for the most scintillating entertainment.\n\nYet Gatland also has a track record of narrow defeats in this tournament and so it proved once more. The difference between extra time and a place in the cursed bronze final was prop Dillon Lewis coming in at the side.\n\nJerome Garces gave the dreaded signal and Handre Pollard maintained his 100 per cent record with the boot. There were four minutes remaining. Against a team as physically resilient as South Africa, it was never likely to be enough.\n\nJones is too canny to say this is the final he wanted, but perhaps this was the final he thought he would get.\n\nThere has been a lot of discussion about hotel allocation since the semi-finalists were known, how much is decided by team pecking order \u2014 New Zealand at the top, obviously, getting first choice \u2014 how much by edicts from World Rugby.\n\nJones always maintained that England\u2019s presence in Tokyo Disneyland before their semi-final was not his doing.\n\nThe Springboks beat Wales 19-16 in a closely-fought, back-and-forth contest in Yokohama\n\nJones will have been pleased that there were no major surprises shown by either side\n\nIt is noticeable, however, that this week England will decamp to the central Tokyo accommodation that has been occupied by South Africa since before their quarter-final with Japan.\n\nDid England, who are believed to be ranked above the Springboks by whatever means World Rugby have of deciding these things, have a say in this decision?\n\nAnd did Jones have a hunch South Africa might be his final opponents, so wanted to remove them from their comfort zone? Never underestimate the world of marginal gains.\n\nJones may have looked to disrupt South Africa's preparations by turfing them out of their hotel\n\nEither way, Jones will certainly have been pleased with the run-out the Springboks received, man of the match Pollard even admitting that his team never felt comfortable, despite looking stronger in the opening half.\n\nRassie Erasmus, South Africa\u2019s coach, spoke of his admiration for Gatland and his fear that, somehow, Wales were going to find a way to win in the end.\n\nThis is, after all, a man who coached the British and Irish Lions to a drawn series in New Zealand having led for three minutes of the 240 across three Tests.\n\nThere is no doubt that Gatland is capable of extraordinary feats and it is fitting that his final match will be against the nation Jones referred to as the gods of the game, New Zealand, in Tokyo on Friday.\n\nWarren Gatland is widely admired by top level coaches in the game for his coaching style\n\nThe third-fourth-place play-off is never where a nation wishes to be, few games are memorable, and many are tame, second-rate, second-string affairs.\n\nPitting Gatland against his native country, however, is befitting and even if the 80 minutes are more ceremonial than fiercely competitive, it at least allows him to depart with honour. It will be Steve Hansen\u2019s final game as All Blacks coach, too.\n\nGatland spoke of staying in the arm wrestle with South Africa and that is pretty much what it was. A physical tussle, lacking great skill or inspiration, and scant spectacle for long periods.\n\nThe Springboks won because Pollard\u2019s kicking was faultless, and for their try, centre Damian de Allende refused to be stopped.\n\nWales stayed in it because Alun Wyn Jones made a wonderfully brave call to take a scrum on the five-metre line rather than kick for the posts, a decision that pulled his team level against all expectations.\n\nGatland is a canny operator and has got the better of Jones in past meetings between the pair\n\nDeep down, Jones will be happy he has avoided the potential banana skin posed by the Welsh\n\nIt was bold because South Africa\u2019s scrum had to that point been on top and Erasmus had recently introduced fresh bodies each one seemingly taller than the last. They looked like those giant figures that used to reduce the It\u2019s A Knockout commentators to hysterics. The throw-ins at line-outs these days are practised by aiming the ball at a coach who stands on top of a ladder.\n\nSo Jones knows what is coming this weekend. A big match, against big men, with big physicality.\n\n\u2018If you can draw a line in the sand and take your opponent backwards, you\u2019re winning those small battles,\u2019 said De Allende. But there will be nothing small about Saturday\u2019s final, off the field, or on it.", "description": "MARTIN SAMUEL IN YOKOHAMA: Eddie Jones would have appreciated the absence of surprise in this match and its bruising, competitive closeness.
