But U.S. troops stepped aside this week as Turkey launched an offensive against the U.S.-backed Kurdish forces.\n\nPresident Trump has faced pressure even from Republicans as he has defended his decision not to intervene against the Turkish incursion, which many see as abandoning an ally in the face of extreme danger. Kurdish forces have described the U.S. departure as \u201ca stab in the back.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome want us to send tens of thousands of soldiers to the area and start a new war all over again,\u201d Trump tweeted Thursday. \u201cOthers say STAY OUT and let the Kurds fight their own battles. I say hit Turkey very hard financially with sanctions if they don\u2019t play by the rules.\u201d\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had threatened to move into northeastern Syria for months. Here\u2019s why he went ahead with it.\n\nWho are the Kurds?\n\nThe Kurds are members of a large, predominantly Muslim ethnic group. They have their own cultural and linguistic traditions, and most speak one of two major dialects of the Kurdish language, which is closely related to Persian. After World War I, Western powers promised Kurds their own homeland in the agreement known as the Treaty of S\u00e8vres. But a later agreement instead divided them among Turkey, Iraq, Syria and Iran.\n\nToday, there are about 30 million Kurds living across the region, with about half of them in Turkey. Iraq is the only country in the region to have established an autonomous Kurdish region, known as Iraqi Kurdistan, inside its borders. Its parliament was founded in 1992.\n\n\u201cThe Kurds have been suppressed in all sorts of ways, often very violently,\u201d said Henri Barkey, a professor of international relations at Lehigh University and adjunct senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cThey have really suffered at the hands of the four states.\u201d\n\nOmer Taspinar, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said that for decades Turkey has had a policy of \u201cassimilating the Kurds into Turkish ethnic identity, denial of Kurdish ethnic identity and denial of Kurdish linguistic rights.\u201d\n\nKurds in Turkey are free to be Kurds, he said, only if they accept that they\u2019re Turkish citizens. \u201cThe problem begins when they want a hyphenated identity,\u201d Taspinar said.\n\nWhy is the United States allied with Syrian Kurds?\n\nThe United States needed a reliable ally in northeastern Syria in the fight against the Islamic State. In 2015, with Washington\u2019s support, Kurdish forces belonging to the Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Unit, or YPG, joined forces with Arab groups and created the Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF. The United States, Britain, France and other countries provided the SDF with weapons. Since then, Kurdish fighters have led the alliance, which was crucial in toppling the Islamic State.\n\nWhy did Erdogan launch the offensive now?\n\nAs the SDF and, thus, the Kurds became crucial to the U.S. mission to defeat the Islamic State, Turkey grew fearful that the Kurdish forces were gaining influence close to the Turkish border, establishing institutions and gaining clout with the Americans, experts said.\n\nInside its own borders, Turkey has for years tried to counter the threat of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, a militant group that has regularly launched attacks across the country in the name of Kurdish nationalism. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in that conflict over the past few decades.\n\nFor Erdogan, as a domestic national security issue, countering the PKK takes precedence over fighting the Islamic State. \u201cThere is no real nationalist anger against ISIS, but there is nationalist anger against PKK,\u201d Taspinar said. (The Islamic State is also known as ISIS.) Erdogan sees the Kurdish fighters in northeastern Syria as terrorists linked to the PKK.\n\nFor years, Turkey has hosted millions of refugees from the Syrian civil war. Now, as Turkey faces a severe economic crisis, Erdogan is facing pressure to resolve the refugee and unemployment crises in one go. \u201cPeople are looking for scapegoats,\u201d Taspinar said.\n\nErdogan has pledged to clear this corner of Syria of Kurdish fighters and then set up a \u201csafe zone\u201d to which Turkey will return at least a million Syrian refugees. That plan has raised alarm in humanitarian circles, where advocates fear that refugees will be forcibly returned to a conflict zone in violation of international law. Kurdish forces are guarding a network of Islamic State prisons in the region, raising fears that if they were to abandon their posts to escape the Turkish offensive, those prisoners could escape. Many see the \u201csafe zone\u201d as more of a buffer zone intended to protect Turkey from the Kurdish fighters rather than to protect refugees from war.\n\nBut if Turkey returns Syrian refugees to this region, many of them will not be ethnically Kurdish, offering Erdogan an opportunity to dramatically change the demography. Experts warned that could only cause tensions to flare. \u201cUnless the Turks intend to stay there forever, you can be sure the Syrian Kurds will reorganize at some point,\u201d Barkey said.\n\nWhat has happened so far?\n\nThousands of civilians have fled their homes on both the Syrian and Turkish sides of the border, with the United Nations reporting Thursday that at least 70,000 Syrians were already displaced from their homes because of the latest escalation in the conflict. The Kurdish side said at least 10 civilians had been killed by Thursday evening, and local Turkish officials said at least six were dead on their side. In Turkey, one 9-month-old infant was among the dead. Erdogan, meanwhile, said that Turkish forces had killed at least 170 \u201cterrorists,\u201d which has not been independently confirmed.\n\nRead more:\n\nA brief history of the Syrian Democratic Forces, the Kurdish-led alliance that helped the U.S. defeat the Islamic State\n\nActually, President Trump, some Kurds did fight in World War II\n\nTurkey plans a Syrian \u2018safe zone.\u2019 Advocates fear a \u2018death trap.\u2019", "description": "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has threatened the incursion for months.
