While being under an award would not necessarily remove such clauses, Mr Lacota said transparency would still improve as \"there'd at least be a publicly available salary floor\".\n\nLIV Young Lawyers' push for greater workplace protections follows official complaints about young lawyers' hours at King & Wood Mallesons and Gilbert + Tobin and a rebellion from junior auditors over pay at Deloitte.\n\nPublic sector and government lawyers already have wage entitlements that are determined by different negotiating processes, such as enterprise bargaining agreements.", "description": "A key legal industry body says early-career lawyers were \"vulnerable to financial exploitation, mental health crises, wage theft, and [have] reduced negotiating power\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2606%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_94/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7d37cf3a6e90d8e8f19e055e1543e37f6174d32a", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
