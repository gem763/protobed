U.S. authorities have alleged the Mossack Fonseca law firm conspired to circumvent federal laws to maintain the wealth of its clients and conceal tax dollars owed to the IRS.\n\n\"The Laundromat\" portrays events surrounding the 2015 data breach at the firm that resulted in the release of more than 11 million documents, called the Panama Papers. The documents revealed how some of the world's richest people hide their money. U.S. prosecutors said the schemes involved sham foundations and shell companies.\n\nMossack and Fonseca said the movie could taint the U.S. investigation and deprive them of their fair trial rights. They also said it could subject them to increased scrutiny by Panamanian authorities.\n\nYOU CAN NOW SEARCH THE ENTIRE PANAMA PAPERS DATABASE\n\nThe repercussions of the leaks were far-ranging, prompting the resignation of the prime minister of Iceland and bringing scrutiny to the leaders of Argentina and Ukraine, Chinese politicians and Russian President Vladimir Putin, among others.\n\nOn Wednesday, Netflix asked a federal judge to dismiss the lawsuit. The company did not address the two lawyers' allegations of defamation in its motion to dismiss. Netflix did not immediately respond to Fox News\u2019 request for comment.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"The Laundromat,\" starring Gary Oldman as Mossack and Antonio Banderas as Fonseca is scheduled for release on Friday.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Two lawyers linked to the so-called Panama Papers filed a defamation lawsuit Tuesday against Netflix over the streaming platform\u2019s new film which depicts the 2015 scandal that brought their law firm worldwide attention.", "authors": ["Bradford Betz", "Bradford Betz Is An Editor For Fox News.
