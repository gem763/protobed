But while a shortfall is inevitable, it is unclear how quick any pick-up in off-the-plan sales and a return to construction will be.\n\n\"That\u2019s probably going to be the biggest test of the market,\" Mr Lawless said.\n\n\"Once developers take a position for new projects is when we get a demonstration of buyer demand to be buying off-plan.\"\n\nSurging clearance rates and a lack of stock for buyers \u2013 benefiting from banks' renewed appetite to lend \u2013 will push prices high enough to encourage developers to dust off plans and take new projects to market.\n\nBut the price pick-up of the past few months hasn't been long enough to prompt a change. Even once people start committing to off-the-plan purchases again, development won't begin immediately.\n\n\"It\u2019s going to be a little while,\" said UDIA Victoria executive director Danni Hunter.\n\n\"Because it takes about 18 months from purchase to settlement, even if they\u2019re starting in great numbers now buying off the plan, there would still be a gap in the supply that\u2019s coming in about 18 months.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConfidence in the new apartment market has also been hit by the slew of construction problems, be they combustible cladding or defects, that are devaluing new units and creating unresolved issues of liability and cost.\n\nMs Hunter said the issues of problem apartments affected existing dwellings and were separate from the pipeline of new homes.", "description": "While an undersupply is inevitable, the time it will take for off-the-plan units to recover is less certain.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_109/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/b2e2e7ca185c5656e75eb71fd41a90b7eaa7e143", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
