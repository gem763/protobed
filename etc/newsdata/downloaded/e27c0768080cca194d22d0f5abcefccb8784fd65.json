Meanwhile, the PM has made it clear he is ready to go ahead with a no-deal outcome to the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU.\n\n\u201cThese three facts have caused concern that the prime minister may have a conflict of interest,\u201d wrote Mr McDonnell. \u201cDonors to the Conservative party and/or the prime minister could stand to gain from a no-deal Brexit \u2013 even if only through cushioning losses by adopting short positions. The prime minister could reasonably be seen as having an interest in securing a no-deal Brexit to financially benefit his donors.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIt is becoming increasingly apparent from public comment that the prime minister is bringing into doubt whether he is upholding the highest standards, thereby further undermining public confidence and trust in him and his government... It is important for public confidence and trust in the House of Commons that any real or apparent conflict of interest is investigated.\u201d\n\nMr Hammond, who said he will not be attending the Tories\u2019 annual conference for the first time in 35 years, also claimed the party he first joined is \u201csuffering a convulsion that makes it \u2013 for now at least \u2013 unrecognisable to me\u201d.\n\nThe MP, who had the Tory whip removed for voting against the government to block a no-deal exit from the European Union, wrote in an article for The Times: \u201cBoris Johnson asserts, ever more boldly, that we will leave the EU on 31 October, \u2018with or without a deal\u2019.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

It could be from \u2013 who knows \u2013 people who have invested billions in shorting the pound or shorting the country in the expectation of a no-deal Brexit. We\n\nDowning Street declined to comment on Mr Hammond\u2019s remarks on the eve of the party\u2019s annual conference when approached by The Independent, but business minister Nadhim Zahawi said they were \u201ccompletely untrue\u201d.\n\n\u201cPhilip, you let yourself down by claiming speculators on no deal are interfering in us leaving the EU. This is an ugly smear that is completely untrue. If you know anything about finance or the City then you will know that,\u201d he said.\n\nLabour MP David Lammy, however, claimed: \u201cIt\u2019s official. Philip Hammond in today\u2019s Times confirming that Boris Johnson is committed to a hard Brexit because the disaster capitalists who backed his campaign will make millions.\u201d\n\nIn his article for The Times, Mr Hammond added of his party: \u201cGone is the relaxed, broad-church coalition, united by a belief in free trade, open markets, fiscal discipline and a fear of the pernicious effects of socialism, but tolerant of a wide range of social and political opinion within its ranks.\n\n\u201cIn its place is an ideological puritanism that brooks no dissent and is more and more strident in its tone.\u201d", "description": "Labour is demanding an independent\u00a0conflict of interest inquiry into the prime minister, following\u00a0allegations by Philip Hammond that Boris Johnson\u2018s\u00a0wealthy supporters stand to profit from a no-deal Brexit.
