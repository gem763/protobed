During my \u00adtoddlerhood in the late \u00adForties, his was the profile on British stamps, and taxes were \u00adcollected \u2018On His Majesty\u2019s Service\u2019.\n\nChild though I was, I sensed something tragic and haunted, as well as ineffably kind, in that lean, unsmiling Windsor face. When I heard of some criminal being \u2018detained at His Majesty\u2019s pleasure\u2019, I felt that such a nice man was bound to show mercy sooner rather than later.\n\nThe new film The King\u2019s Speech (whose star, Colin Firth, was honoured in Sunday\u2019s Golden Globe awards) gives long-overdue credit to George VI, the most quietly courageous of our modern monarchs and source of almost everything dutiful and steadfast in his daughter, our Queen.\n\nMistakes: Like almost all 'period' film these days The King's Speech is riddled with historical distortions, over-simplifications and out-of-period anachronisms\n\nThe movie traces the young King-to-be\u2019s struggle to overcome his stammer with the help of a pioneering Australian speech therapist, Lionel Logue. As a result, he is able to rally the nation with a faultless, inspiring address over the BBC just as the war-clouds are gathering.\n\nYet I watched it in a state of \u00adagonised suspense unconnected with whether he would succeed in spitting out the next syllable. For like almost every \u2018period\u2019 film nowadays, and \u00adcertainly every British one, it is \u00adriddled with preposterous historical distortions, over-simplifications and out-of-period anachronisms.\n\nAdmittedly, no film can be an exact and comprehensive recreation of real events, otherwise there would be no dramatic tension and the thing would have to go on for hours.\n\nSo one can overlook the fact that the real crisis over the Prince\u2019s stammer \u2014 mainly the result of his father\u2019s blustering cruelties \u2014 started in the early Twenties rather than the middle Thirties. One can accept the film\u2019s monkeying around with historical fact in relation to the main political \u00adplayers: Prime Minister Stanley \u00adBaldwin and Winston Churchill (a miscast Timothy Spall).\n\nWorst crime of all: One scene in The King's Speech mentions Sooty - despite the film being set in the 1930s and the puppet not getting busy until 1948\n\nOne can even accept Helena Bonham Carter, usually such a sensitive actress, playing Queen Elizabeth as a sharp-tongued snob, crushing ordinary people as the future, lovely Queen Mum would never have dreamed of doing.\n\nBut the first rule of film-writing, laid down by the famous screenwriter Robert McKee, is: \u2018Thou shalt know thy world and everything in it as well as thou knowest thyself.\u2019\n\nSadly, the scenes in The King\u2019s Speech don\u2019t take place in the world of Thirties Britain \u2014 or any other that ever existed.\n\nNo dinner-jacketed BBC executive, surrounded by heavy stand-microphones, would have talked about a royal broadcast \u2018going out live tonight\u2019.\n\nAlso, rather than George VI\u2019s Coronation in 1937 being organised, as such events had been for generations, by the Earl-Marshal of England and hundreds of officials, the film suggested it was orchestrated by the Archbishop of Canterbury (Derek Jacobi), fussing over the seating for Westminster Abbey as if for some provincial whist-drive.\n\nUntil now, my mental Oscar for Most Ridiculous Moment in any film went to the scene in Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Kill Bill when a character travels by plane with a huge, naked samurai sword on the next seat.\n\nThat is now supplanted by the \u00adclimactic sequence in The King\u2019s Speech when the Prince and Logue hold a pre-Coronation rehearsal in a deserted Westminster Abbey using King Edward\u2019s Chair, which has been moved from its centuries-old resting place with the Stone of Scone.\n\nMonarch-to-be and his disrespectful Australian therapist have a furious row, which still attracts no attention until the Archbishop of Canterbury himself \u2014 who evidently lives over the shop \u2014 comes bumbling in.\n\nEven worse, the film neglects a piece of real drama involving the King and the unpleasant Archbishop. A couple of days after George VI became King, the Archbishop made a singularly insensitive broadcast, calling attention to the \u2018occasional and momentary \u00adhesitation\u2019 in the new monarch\u2019s speech, which devastated the King and almost undid all Logue\u2019s good work.\n\nRidiculous moment: A scene in Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill saw a character travel by plane with a huge samurai sword on the next seat\n\nThe other great recent offender in such matters was ITV\u2019s hugely-\u00adsuccessful Edwardian drama Downton Abbey, written by Julian Fellowes. I intended to avoid this series, having previously managed to sit through only about five minutes of Fellowes\u2019 Oscar-winning Twenties country house movie, Gosford Park.\n\nIn that, a character was shown flagging down a liveried chauffeur in a vintage Rolls-Royce and, like some American hippy hitch-hiker, asking: \u2018Where are you headed?\u2019\n\nAnother character was being sympathised with for their hard lot and lapsed into similar 21st-century Yank-speak: \u2018It comes with the territory.\u2019\n\nHowever, the praise for Downton Abbey was so extravagant I felt obliged to take a look. And, lo and behold, here was an Edwardian kitchenmaid announcing, like some modern agony aunt, her philosophy was: \u2018Live every day to the full.\u2019\n\nNext came a footman being criticised by a colleague, and snapping: \u2018Cut me some slack, will you!\u2019\n\nThere\u2019s less excuse for Fellowes, who is old enough to know that Britons who lived eight and nine decades ago never used expressions like that.\n\nThe sad truth is that most younger writers assume that people in other ages spoke and behaved just as we do today, shrieking four-letter words, hugging each other when they met, saying \u2018I\u2019ll get it\u2019 if a doorbell or phone rang, or at moments of triumph punching the air and shouting: \u2018Yessss!\u2019\n\nInaccuracies: ITV drama Downton Abbey used phrases that would never have been uttered 80 or 90 years ago\n\nThe National Theatre production of Rebecca Lenkiewicz\u2019s Her Naked Skin, a play with a \u2018new take\u2019 on suffragettes in 1913, focused on sex, specifically \u00adlesbianism, as much as politics.\n\nBut worst of all was its awful American soap-style lapses. During a scene in a Pall Mall gentlemen\u2019s club, a member called to the barman: \u2018Give Lord Curzon a drink and put it on my tab.\u2019 A husband, remonstrating with his suffragette wife, said: \u2018I just want you to be happy is all.\u2019\n\nCall me a pedant if you will, but I\u2019m hardly preaching revolution. Until quite recently, in both film and television, getting the period right, or at least not too glaringly wrong, was an automatic part of the production process.\n\nBig-screen epics such as Lawrence Of Arabia, The Charge Of The Light Brigade or even Spartacus, while \u00adpredominantly action-based, still managed to avoid lines whose incongruity set your teeth on edge.\n\nOn television, producers like John Hawkesworth studied and meticulously recreated the real world of their stories, like The Duchess Of Duke Street.\n\nOh, I forgot to mention The King\u2019s Speech\u2019s worst crime of all. One scene has Helena Bonham Carter\u2019s bitchy Queen Elizabeth trying to strike up a rapport with Lionel Logue\u2019s children by asking: \u2018Do you like Sooty?\u2019\n\nSooty . . . in the Thirties? Actually that most malevolent of glove puppets didn\u2019t come along until 1948 with his hammer and ink squirt and magic words: \u2018Izzy-wizzy, let\u2019s get busy.\u2019\n\nIzzy-wizzy . . . once again a scriptwriter didn\u2019t get busy enough.\n\n", "description": "Like almost every \u2018period\u2019 film nowadays, and \u00adcertainly every British one, Philip Norman argues that the King's Speech is \u00adriddled with preposterous historical distortions, over-simplifications and out-of-period anachronisms.", "authors": ["Philip Norman For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/01/18/article-1348103-0CD03E52000005DC-807_1024x615_large.jpg", "published_at": "2011-01-18"}
