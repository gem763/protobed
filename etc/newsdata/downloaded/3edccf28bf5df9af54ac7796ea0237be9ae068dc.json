So it would still be a big success.'\n\nMailOnline have contacted representative of Craig for comment.\n\nTime to go?

That has been cleared. Are we still looking at the teeth?\n\n'Emma you are fine, you are sensual, you just need to gear up that energy. We don't want to lose you so just push, push, push. You're great, the teeth are beautiful. Bye bye,' Motsi concluded.\n\nDespite the amusing interaction causing a raucous, the pair earned strong 27 points.\n\nIn hysterics: Things didn't get better, as Tess and the crowd couldn't stop laughing even as Motsi Mabuse tried to give her feedback to Anton and Emma", "description": "James Jordan, 41, declared Craig Revel Horwood, 54, should sacked from Strictly Come Dancing as the ex pro dancer insisted 'no-one would miss him'", "authors": ["Niomi Harris For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/21/19371048-0-image-a-19_1570394581407.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
