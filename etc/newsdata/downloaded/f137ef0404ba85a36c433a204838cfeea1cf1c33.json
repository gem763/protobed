Olivia Sun, Des Moines Register\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2019, Des Moines Register and Tribune Co.\n\nElizabeth Warren has surged in Iowa, narrowly overtaking Joe Biden and distancing herself from fellow progressive Bernie Sanders, the latest Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll shows.\n\nWarren, the U.S. senator from Massachusetts, now holds a 2-percentage-point lead, with 22% of likely Democratic caucusgoers saying she is their first choice for president. It is the first time she has led in the Register\u2019s poll.\n\nFormer Vice President Biden, who had led each of the Register\u2019s three previous 2020 cycle polls, follows her at 20%. Sanders, the U.S. senator from Vermont, has fallen to third place with 11%.\n\nNo other candidate reaches double digits.\n\n\u201cThis is the first major shakeup\u201d in what had been a fairly steady race, said J. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer & Co., which conducted the poll. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve had someone other than Joe Biden at the top of the leader board.\u201d\n\nSouth Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg follows the three leaders as the favorite of 9% of poll respondents. U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris of California is at 6%. U.S. Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey are at 3%.\n\nPolling at 2% are U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, former U.S. Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas, businessman Tom Steyer and entrepreneur Andrew Yang.\n\nEight others are polling at 1% or less.\n\nFrom the Statehouse to the campaign trail. Get the politics news you need in your inbox each weekday.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nBut the race is far from settled: Just one in five likely Democratic caucusgoers say their minds are made up, while 63% say they could still be persuaded to support a different candidate.\n\n\u201cThe data in this poll seem to suggest the field is narrowing, but my sense is there\u2019s still opportunity aplenty,\u201d Selzer said. \u201cThe leaders aren\u2019t all that strong. The universe is not locked in.\u201d\n\nThe poll of 602 likely Democratic caucusgoers was conducted Sept. 14-18, and the margin of error is plus or minus 4 percentage points.\n\nWarren\u2019s steady rise in Iowa\n\nOther candidates have seen their Iowa Poll numbers briefly spike \u2014 O\u2019Rourke hit double digits early after running in a competitive U.S. Senate race in Texas, then fell back. Buttigieg surged after a well-received CNN town hall performance, then drops in the new poll. But no one in Iowa so far this cycle has seen Warren's steady and sustained momentum.\n\nThe Register\u2019s first 2020 caucus poll, in December 2018, pegged Warren's support at 8%. In March, about two months after she first visited the state and formally announced she would run, that rose to 9%. In June, as Iowa Democrats began to marvel at her organizational strength, she rose to 15% \u2014 though that poll\u2019s methodology differed somewhat from the others.\n\nToday, the universe of people who say they are considering Warren in some way \u2014 71% of likely Democratic caucusgoers \u2014 is larger than it is for any other candidate.\n\nThat includes 22% who say she is their first choice for president, 20% who say she is their second choice and another 29% who say they are actively considering her.\n\nTrailing her are: Biden (60%), Buttigieg (55%), Harris (55%), Sanders (50%), Booker (42%), O\u2019Rourke (38%) and Klobuchar (37%).\n\nIt\u2019s also higher than where Warren was polling in June. Then, 61% of respondents were considering her in some way.\n\n\u201cThat appears to be a powerful leap forward and suggests that she can improve further, because she\u2019s got these people actively considering her and thinking of her as a second choice,\u201d Selzer said. \u201cShe\u2019s got a huge number there. Those people can be converted.\u201d\n\nWarren is the best-liked candidate in the field: 75% of likely Democratic caucusgoers say they view her favorably. Next-best are Buttigieg, who is viewed favorably by 69%, and Biden, at 66%.\n\nBut Selzer said Warren\u2019s numbers also reveal some vulnerability.\n\nAmong those who say she is their first choice for president, only 12% say their minds are made up, while 88% say they could be persuaded to support another candidate.\n\nMore Biden supporters are firm in their choice: 26% say their mind is mind up, with 70% saying they could be persuaded.\n\nBiden and Sanders slip\n\nBiden and Sanders \u2014 who have held first and second place, respectively, since last December \u2014 have hit new lows, though they still outshine 16 other candidates.\n\nTheir numbers aren\u2019t bad, Selzer said, but the downward trend line is troubling.\n\nOverall, the former vice president has slipped in each of the four Iowa Polls the Register has conducted this caucus cycle \u2014 in terms of both support and favorability.\n\nIn December 2018, 32% of likely Democratic caucusgoers said Biden was their first choice for president. That\u2019s fallen in each poll as Biden reintroduces himself to Iowans \u2014 and as his competitors have targeted him as the polling front-runner.\n\nBiden\u2019s favorability rating also has fallen \u2014 82% of likely Democratic caucusgoers had a favorable view of him in December, compared with 66% today. His unfavorable numbers have nearly doubled in that time from 15% to 29%.\n\nEven among those who say Biden is their first choice for president, they\u2019re less enthusiastic than are supporters of other candidates.\n\nTwenty-eight percent of all poll respondents describe their feelings toward their first-choice candidate as \u201cextremely enthusiastic.\u201d But 32% of Warren supporters say they are \u201cextremely enthusiastic\u201d about their choice, compared with 22% of Biden supporters. Biden supporters are more likely to describe themselves as \u201cmildly enthusiastic\u201d (31%) than are Warren supporters (11%).\n\nBiden does best with older caucusgoers, winning the support of 35% of those 65 and older. That demographic makes up about a quarter of likely caucusgoers, and Biden is their top choice, with an almost 3-to-1 lead over Warren.\n\nBut he struggles with young people. Just 9% of those younger than 35 say he is their first choice for president. Warren leads that demographic, at 27%.\n\nSanders, too, has hit a new low among those younger than 35, falling from a high of 25% in March \u2014 just after he announced he would run. He dropped to 16% in June and is at 11% today.\n\nPart of Sanders\u2019 problem: Warren has eaten into some of his key constituencies.\n\nAmong those who say they caucused for Sanders in 2016, 25% say they will do so again. Thirty-two percent say they will support Warren instead, and 12% opt for Buttigieg.\n\nKatie Naset, a 37-year-old poll respondent and Clive resident, said she caucused for Sanders in 2016 because he advanced a far-left agenda focused on issues such as \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d student loan debt relief and affordable child care.\n\n\u201cI aligned more closely with him than Hillary Clinton on those issues,\u201d the family law attorney said. \u201cBut at this point, Elizabeth Warren best approximates with where I am on these issues. She has bold, realistic ideas. They\u2019re backed with a lot of research and deliberate thought.\u201d\n\nNaset is among the 20% of likely Democratic caucusgoers who describe themselves as \u201cvery liberal.\u201d Of that group, 48% back Warren and 20% support Sanders.\n\nSanders ties Warren among first-time caucusgoers at 22%, and he's second to her in generating support among young people. Twenty-two percent of those younger than 35 say Sanders is their first choice for president, trailing Warren by 5 percentage points.\n\nWhat does it take to beat Trump?\n\nIowa\u2019s likely Democratic caucusgoers say that nominating a candidate who has a strong chance of beating President Donald Trump is more important than nominating someone who shares their positions on major issues.\n\nSixty-three percent say defeating Trump is more important, and 31% say it\u2019s more important to find someone who aligns with them on the issues. Six percent are unsure.\n\nBut what does electability look like to likely Democratic caucusgoers?\n\nAsked which of two phrases better fits their definition of the more electable candidate, 74% choose a candidate who can excite new voters and get them to show up, compared to 16% who say it's someone who excites the Democratic base.\n\nSixty-three percent say a candidate who takes positions seeking to find common ground with Republicans is more electable than someone who takes positions moving the country to the left (28%).\n\nFifty-seven percent say a candidate who represents a new generation of leadership is more electable than someone who has a long history of serving in government (28%).\n\nAnd when it comes to dealing with Trump, 54% say the candidate who will \u201ctake the high road\u201d is more electable than someone who will \u201cget in the mud as needed\u201d to take him on (35%).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard not to get down in the mud with him. He just kind of brings that out in people,\u201d said J\u2019Andrea Gibney, an 83-year-old poll respondent and Maynard resident. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to take the high road \u2014 you can\u2019t be on his level or you\u2019re no better than he is.\u201d\n\nGibney is among the 59% of likely caucusogers who believe government will return to the way it was if Trump is removed from office in 2020. Majorities of every demographic group agree.\n\nBut 30% say they believe Trump\u2019s presidency has permanently changed the way American government works.\n\nThe 1-percenters and less\n\nThree candidates are polling at 1%: Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, former U.S. housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro and former U.S. Rep. John Delaney of Maryland.\n\nTwo candidates \u2014 author and activist Marianne Williamson and U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado \u2014 are polling at 0%, when accounting for rounding.\n\nThree candidates had not a single person name them as their first choice for president: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who ended his campaign Friday, after polling had concluded; U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio; and former U.S. Rep. Joe Sestak of Pennsylvania.\n\nNot a single person named de Blasio as either their first or second choice for president in three rounds of Register polling.\n\n\u201cThis is what lack of traction looks like in absolute terms,\u201d Selzer said of de Blasio\u2019s numbers.\n\nAmong those candidates polling at 1% or below, Castro has the largest universe of people who are considering him in some capacity: 1% say he is their first choice, another 1% say he is their second choice and 20% say they are actively considering him, for a total of 22%.\n\nBut as he's become better known (71% can now rate their feelings toward him compared to 47% who could do so in June), Castro's unfavorability rating has nearly tripled. It's risen from 13% in June to 36% today.\n\nThe data also suggest that Castro's performance in the Democratic debate earlier this month did him no favors with Iowa Democratic caucusgoers. On the Texas debate stage, Castro appeared to attack Biden's age, asking repeatedly whether the vice president had forgotten what he had said minutes earlier.\n\nSee all of our latest Iowa Poll results:\n\nFifty-four percent of those who say they watched all of that debate view Castro unfavorably. He is viewed unfavorably by 23% of those who watched none of it.\n\nDelaney is the only other lower-polling candidate to crack double digits when looking at the full universe of people considering him in some way. However, that number has shrunk to 10% from 18% since June.\n\n\u201cMost of them have come to Iowa at least once \u2014 some of them many times,\u201d Selzer said. \u201cThey\u2019ve hired staff. They\u2019ve made an investment. And if you\u2019ve got people who are getting numbers above 50% and you\u2019re not getting 10%, you have to either really up your game or consider the alternative.\u201d\n\nBut the caucus field typically doesn\u2019t crystallize until very late, and there is still opportunity for momentum, she said.\n\nThe top three candidates \u2014 Warren, Biden and Sanders \u2014 account for just over half of first-choice votes, totaling 53%. There are now 15 candidates vying for 47% of the remaining electorate.\n\n\u201cThose votes could start to coalesce around one of the also-rans and quite easily pop another candidate into double-digits as a contender,\u201d Selzer said.\n\nDes Moines Register reporters Kim Norvell and Katie Akin contributed to this report.\n\nBrianne Pfannenstiel is Chief Politics Reporter for the Register.

The sample was supplemented with additional phone number lookups. Interviews were administered in English. Responses for all contacts were adjusted by age, sex and congressional district to reflect their proportions among active voters in the list.\n\nQuestions based on the sample of 602 voters likely to attend the 2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses have a maximum margin of error of plus or minus 4.0 percentage points. This means that if this survey were repeated using the same questions and the same methodology, 19 times out of 20, the findings would not vary from the true population value by more than plus or minus 4.0 percentage points. Results based on smaller samples of respondents \u2014 such as by gender or age \u2014 have a larger margin of error.\n\nRepublishing the copyright Iowa Poll without credit to The Des Moines Register, CNN, and Mediacom is prohibited.\n\nLoading...\n\nLoading...\n\nLoading...\n\nLoading...\n\nLoading...\n\nLoading...\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/iowa-poll/2019/09/22/iowa-poll-election-2020-iowa-caucus-elizabeth-warren-joe-biden-bernie-sanders-democrat-candidates/2370015001/", "description": "Warren, the U.S. senator from Massachusetts, now holds a 2-point lead, with 22% of likely Democratic caucusgoers\u00a0saying she is their first choice for president.", "authors": ["Brianne Pfannenstiel", "Published P.M.
