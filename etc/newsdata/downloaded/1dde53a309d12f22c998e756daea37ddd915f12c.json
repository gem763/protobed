Archaeologists have discovered man-made piles of stones on the Swiss side of Lake Constance. Around 15feet below the surface of the 207-square-mile lake on the borders of Switzerland, Germany and Austria. Local media reports that the so-called 'Swiss Stonehenge' sits 15feet down at the bottom of Lake Constance and is a Neolithic relic, with stones ranging in size up to around 100 inches wide. A ship equipped with a digger with a 15-metre-long arm removed material alongside the stones and revealed the stones. In the following months, further investigations will be carried out with the hope of discovering more about the artefacts, which will be analysed by an international team of researchers.\n\nA spokesman at the Archaeology Office of the Swiss Canton of Thurgau described the findings as 'sensational' after carrying out excavations of the lake bed.\n\nA ship equipped with a digger with a 15-metre-long arm removed material alongside the stones to reveal them for study.\n\nAnalysis of how they were placed shows they were put down by humans and not by nature, archaeologists claim.\n\nUsing underwater georadar developed by the Technical University of Darmstadt in Germany, the team of scientists managed to study the lake's sediment and stone deposits in search of the origin and purpose of the formations.\n\nThe Archaeology Office wrote: 'With high-frequency electromagnetic pulses, the hidden layer of the lake bed in the vicinity of the stone structures was recorded.'\n\n'It is obvious that the stones of up to 40 centimetres in size rest on the post-glacial, banded lake deposits and clearly above the underlying upper edge of the moraine [a glacially formed accumulation of unconsolidated glacial debris].\n\n'Thus, it is now scientifically proven that the cairns did not originate naturally from the glacier, but were piled up by human hands.'\n\nThe man-made piles of stones were found on the Swiss side of Lake Constance, a 207-square-mile lake on the borders of Switzerland, Germany and Austria and work is ongoing to learn more about them\n\nEach stone was located at regular intervals running completely parallel to the Swiss shoreline at a depth of about 15 feet\n\nAnalysis of how the rocks (pictured) were placed shows they were placed there by humans and not by nature, archaeologists claim\n\nA spokesman at the Archaeology Office of the Swiss Canton of Thurgau described the findings as 'sensational' after carrying out extensive excavations on the lake bed\n\nThe spokesman added: 'The first results produced using carbon dating show that the stones in area 5 were placed there around 5,500 years ago in the Neolithic period.'\n\nIn the following months, further investigations will be carried out with the hope of discovering more about the artefacts, which will be analysed by an international team of researchers.\n\nInitially, it was unclear whether the stones were natural formations from the remnants of a glacier which was located in the area 18,000 years ago.\n\nThe researchers had originally suspected that the formations were from the Bronze Age dating back to around 1000 BC.\n\nPictured@ : A piece of Poplar wood retrieved by the divers which may have been used as part of the construction or excavation of the rocks. Experts have confirmed these mysterious piles of stones - compared to an underwater Stonehenge - found at the bottom of Lake Constance are much older than previously thought\n\nUsing underwater georadar tech (pictured) developed by the Technical University of Darmstadt in Germany, the team of scientists managed to study the lake's sediment and stone deposits in search of the origin and purpose of the formations\n\nPictured: The research team on Lake Constance where the Neolithic rocks have been discovered. Experts have confirmed these mysterious piles of stones on the bottom of Lake Constance which have been compared to an 'underwater Stonehenge' were man-made\n\nCurrently, there are various theories about the purpose of the stones, such as that they served as weirs, burial mounds or signposted transportation routes.\n\nUrs Leuzinger, a researcher on the project, estimates that at the time of construction, the cairns were located along the shoreline or even in shallow water.\n\nHe said: 'I've never really experienced anything like this. Whenever we dig something up, we usually know what it's all about.'\n\nHe said that his team 'has no intention to compete with the original Stonehenge', saying that the moniker had been 'chosen by German media' and not by archaeologists.\n\nHowever, he said that there are some similarities with the Wiltshire monument as it required an equally impressive feat by prehistoric humans to transport such stones.\n\nDr Leuzinger said: 'After all, our 170 cairns of 500 cubic metres of stones each does bring quite a decent amount to the shores of Lake Constance.'\n\nThe cairns were first discovered in 2015 by the Institute for Lake Research in the town of Langenargen in the south-western German state of Baden-Wuerttemberg.\n\nIt is thought they would have been near to a settlement of lake dwellings which are much deeper under water perhaps close to what was once a prehistoric shoreline and are yet to be discovered, according to the Thurgau Office for Archaeology.\n\nBut they added: 'It may also be the case that the lake dwellings have already eroded away due to the erosion over the years.'\n\nDivers investigating the site have been finding out more about the rocks, including their age.Currently, there are various theories about the purpose of the stones, such as that they served as weirs, burial mounds or signposted transportation routes", "description": "Local media reports that the so-called 'Swiss Stonehenge' sits 15feet down at the bottom of Lake Constance and is a Neolithic relic, with stones ranging in size up to around 100 inches wide.", "authors": ["Joe Pinkstone For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/30/15/19110594-0-image-a-31_1569852265269.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
