Iowa State has lost twice by a total of just three points despite having what many thought might be its best team as a Big 12 member.\n\nThe Horned Frogs and Cyclones have a lot to prove _ both to themselves and the rest of the league _ when they meet Saturday in Ames.\n\nTCU (3-1, 1-0 Big 12) pounded Kansas 51-14 last week. But that came on the heels of an upset loss to SMU at home that knocked the Horned Frogs out of the Top 25.\n\nIowa State (2-2, 0-1), which opened the year ranked 21st, seemed to break out with a 72-20 win over Louisiana-Monroe on Sept. 21. The Cyclones then fell behind by 20 before a late rally fell short in a 23-21 loss at Baylor last weekend.\n\nThis weekend\u2019s meeting at Jack Trice Stadium might be especially important for the Horned Frogs considering it kicks off a stretch of five games out of seven on the road.\n\n\u201cWhen you go on the road, you have to take ballgames. That\u2019s just what it is, and Iowa State does a good job with all of that,\u201d TCU coach Gary Patterson said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get ready to play.\u201d\n\nCYTOBERFEST?\n\nIowa State also started slow in 2017 and 2018 before rolling in October. The Cyclones are 7-0 in the season\u2019s second month over the past two years, a sign that coach Matt Campbell\u2019s players are committed to his vision even after stumbling out of the gate.\n\n\u201cYou look back on the last couple years where, I do think the common trend for us is we\u2019ve gotten better every game,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Cyclones and top-ranked Alabama are the only teams to be unbeaten in October dating back to 2016.\n\nMR. ANDERSON\n\nThe matchup to watch when TCU is on offense will be running back Darius Anderson against Iowa\u2019s State\u2019s stingy rush defense. The Cyclones are allowing just 115 yards a game on 3.2 yards per carry. Anderson ranks sixth nationally with 120.8 yards per game and fifth at 8.2 yards per attempt, and last week he became the first Horned Frog with three consecutive 100-yard rushing games in 17 years.\n\nDUGGAN\u2019S IOWA DEBUT\n\nTCU freshman quarterback Max Duggan is from Council Bluffs, Iowa, and was recruited by the Cyclones before leaving the state. The four-star recruit quickly seized the starting job in Fort Worth and has thrown for 523 yards with seven touchdowns and no interceptions. Duggan\u2019s completion percentage of 53.4 is a bit low, but Campbell knows that Duggan could be trouble if the Cyclones don\u2019t account for him.\n\n\u201cHe never panics. He plays with really good poise,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cHe\u2019s been a huge asset to them.\u201d\n\nCYCLONES DEFENSE\n\nIowa State\u2019s defense might be a major challenge to a quarterback with just 88 career passing attempts. The Cyclones are allowing just 18.5 points a game in regulation, in large part because of how good they are at confusing opposing quarterbacks with different looks. But Iowa State will likely be without star end JaQuan Bailey, who hurt his foot in the first half of last week\u2019s loss in Waco and is listed as doubtful.\n\nTIDBITS\n\nTCU is 37 of 71 on third downs this season. Iowa State is allowing opponents to convert on third down at 42.9%, which ranks 98th out of 130 FBS teams. \u2026The Cyclones are tied for first nationally with just two true 3-and-outs this season. But finding the end zone has been another matter. Iowa State has settled for field goals on six of its 18 trips inside its opponents\u2019 20-yard line. \u2026TCU is 18-14 on the road as a Big 12 member. \u2026Iowa State has yet to let up a touchdown in the first quarter. \u2026The Horned Frogs are 8-2 against Iowa State and 3-1 in Ames.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "TCU is still looking for a signature win despite outscoring its opponents by nearly 22 points per game.
