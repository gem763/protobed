Ethereum Classic developers told us that the Atlantis hard fork is going smoothly, and then the update was successful. Meanwhile, many people were left bemused by the latest news from the upcoming Binance.US and started to migrate to KuCoin. And while somebody moved USD 1 billion in BTC, Huobi's funds weren't a part of it.\n\nWe learned that another bank picked Ethereum, that the Venezuelan government plans to release a crypto calculator for Android smartphones, Russian banks want to eliminate crypto anonymity, and the country's crypto fate will be decided in a few days. We\u2019ve also wondered if the Uruguayan Central Bank took a crypto U-turn. In the meantime, North Korea will host a crypto conference, while its people are allowed to own crypto, and it may be working on wallets too. That's not all, as government agencies in Brazil and Mexico are looking to crack down on non-compliant platforms and brokerages, and France said 'no' to Libra's development on European soil.\n\nWhile the stock exchange MERJ launched tokenized IPO, Coinbase may announce its plans for an IEO platform in the next few months, while STOs may also be on the table. Stellar partnered with Keybase for a new airdrop, Trezor introduced a BTC-only firmware, and it turns out it's unlikely Facebook will include the Chinese yuan in the basket of fiat currencies underpinning Libra, while Tether embraced yuan. Meanwhile, a bitcoin millionaire barely got away from a robbery.\n\nIn other equally important news, LG could be launching its own blockchain-powered smartphone in response to Samsung\u2019s Klaytn Phone; a new wallet by ex-CEO of BTCC is revealed, Ripple is selling XRP to institutional buyers with a discount, and BCH announced its futures contract, market capitalisation and trading tournament plans.\n\nLet\u2019s check out this week\u2019s jokes.
