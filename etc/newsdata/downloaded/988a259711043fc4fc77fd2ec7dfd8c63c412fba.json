The details haven\u2019t been finalized but this time there is a good chance that the government will not want to hold a minority stake.\n\nThe key question now is will this stake sale be successful?\n\nThe last one was a disaster; not a single bid was received in 2018.\n\nUnion civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri is confident. In a recent television interview he made the following observations.\n\n# Air India is a first rate asset.\n\n# It flies to 40 destinations outside the country.\n\n# It does face the problem of unsustainable debt.\n\n# It needs to be privatized.\n\n#Airlines the world over face issues relating to profitability.\n\nExcept for the point about Air India being a first rate asset, one can\u2019t disagree with the minister.\n\nThe nature of this asset, however, is what really counts in a stake sale.\n\nA look at the financials of the company suggests that it is anything but a first rate asset. So poor are the financials that they threaten to overwhelm the positives.\n\nIn the four years ended 2018-19, the aggregate net losses were Rs 23,273 crore. To offset that, government infused equity capital of Rs 11,540 crore.\n\nThe bigger problem is the total debt of Rs 58,352 crore (as one 31st March 2019).\n\nTo an extent, government has tried to solve the problem by taking some of the debt off Air India\u2019s books and transferring it to a special purpose vehicle.\n\nRegardless, the company remains one which is in trouble as it was not able to record even operating profit in 2016-17 and 2017-18.\n\nA successful sale will need the government to offer large concessions, particularly on the debt. In addition, any potential buyer will want to be endowed with flexibility when it comes to dealing with employees.\n\nThis is not going to be an easy sale. But it is a necessary one and hopefully the government will be successful this time.", "description": "The Narendra Modi government is reported to be working on a new exercise to sell its stake in Air India.
