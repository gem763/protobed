Guyger had spoken with a co-worker whom she had a sexual relationship with, Hemus said.\n\nDefense attorney Robert Rogers dismissed the relationship as irrelevant to the murder trial. Dozens of other tenants in the building, he added, regularly parked on the wrong floor and tried to enter the wrong apartment. Different floors looked identical, he said.\n\nTired from a 15-hour shift, Rogers said it was understandable how Guyger didn't notice she was on the wrong floor and believed her neighbor was an intruder.\n\nBotham Jean's death prompts the question:When will it be safe to exist while black in US?\n\nAccording to a 911 call first obtained by Dallas TV station WFAA, Guyger apologized to Jean, 26, while reporting the shooting. She can be heard saying \u201cI\u2019m gonna lose my job\u201d and \u201cI am going to need a supervisor\" in the six-minute recording.\n\nThe Dallas Police Department fired Guyger, now 31, in September. Authorities initially arrested her for manslaughter, but a grand jury indicted her in November 2018 on a murder charge.\n\nThe jury in the murder trial that began Monday will decide whether Guyger committed murder, a lesser offense such as manslaughter or criminally negligent homicide, or no crime at all.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "description": "Amber Guyger, the former Dallas police officer who fatally shot an unarmed black man in his apartment, was distracted, a prosecutor said at the trial.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/09/23/USAT/02275a88-7600-42dc-927a-bd2ba35f3dbb-AP_APTOPIX_Dallas_Officer_Mistaken_Apartment.JPG?crop=5598,3149,x0,y0&width=3200&height=2174&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
