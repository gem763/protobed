It was never going to deliver any clear wins, and was unlikely to do her progressive reputation any favours. And that\u2019s the outcome \u2013 Ardern\u2019s reputation has probably taken a hit, at least among her own progressive constituency.\n\nArdern\u2019s liberal supporters see her as the polar opposite of the US president, and she has even been labelled the \u201canti-Trump\u201d. They expected her in some way to speak truth to power when meeting the man who has become synonymous with the most reactionary problems in politics today. More than anything, Ardern might have been expected to use the opportunity to push Trump hard on the issue of climate change.\n\nInstead, Ardern came out of the meeting typically upbeat, exuding her trademark diplomacy. She described the meeting as a \u201cperfectly productive, warm, solid bilateral\u201d, trotting out the usual platitudes about US-NZ relations, and highlighting Trump\u2019s purported interest in New Zealand.\n\nThere were some tidbits: we were informed of Trump\u2019s somewhat incongruous interest in the gun buyback scheme established by Ardern\u2019s government immediately following the Christchurch mosque terror attacks. But, as signalled prior to her departure for the US, trade was top of Ardern\u2019s agenda, with climate change seemingly barely touched upon.\n\nTrump showed interest in New Zealand gun buyback program, Ardern says Read more\n\nUnfortunately for Ardern, the New Zealand media is now giving plenty of coverage of her positivity towards Trump, mixed with reports of dissatisfaction over her failure to push climate change action at the meeting. And to make matters worse for her, Trump has now tweeted that the good news stories about their conversation are \u201ctrue\u201d and that it was \u201cA wonderful meeting!\u201d\n\nIn one sense the meeting was a success. Many conservatives will be very happy with a positive diplomatic outcome and Ardern\u2019s focus on trade. Prior to the meeting conservative pundits congratulated Ardern for even securing the meeting with Trump and lobbied for her to use it to push a free-trade agenda, which has long been New Zealand\u2019s diplomatic focus with the US.\n\nArdern\u2019s meeting ticked the usual objectives for a New Zealand prime minister meeting the US president. Business as usual has been achieved. Therein lies the problem for Ardern.\n\nArdern isn\u2019t supposed to be a traditional PM. She came to power riding a wave of enthusiasm for being different. Jacindamania was based on the expectation that she would do politics differently and would reject business as usual. She promised \u201ctransformational change\u201d.\n\nNow this anti-Trump politician has had her first formal meeting with the real Trump, and nothing much has changed. While no one can have reasonably expected that her meeting with Trump would produce immediate results, there was certainly an expectation that she would at least emphasise the need for action on climate change.\n\nArdern has previously campaigned on making climate change her \u201cgeneration\u2019s nuclear-free moment\u201d. In inviting this comparison, she was consciously evoking a time when New Zealand stood up to the US government, banning American nuclear ships from visiting our ports in the face of enormous diplomatic and trade pressure. While contentious at the time, this defiant stance is now a source of immense national pride for New Zealanders.\n\nClimate change is also why Ardern travelled to New York this week. And her meeting with Trump was preceded by her speech at the UN in which she determinedly remained on message and suggested trade was an answer to climate change.\n\nTo her misfortune, Ardern had to follow Greta Thunberg, who excoriated world leaders for their failure to act on climate change, describing this as a betrayal.\n\nThunberg\u2019s address made it clear there is now a new anti-Trump on the world stage \u2013 one who it is impossible to imagine meeting with Trump and letting him get away with business as usual, or proposing trade deals as a solution for climate change.\n\nArdern is also fighting a rising tide of cynicism at home over whether her actions match her rhetoric. The New Zealand Labour party and, crucially, Ardern\u2019s own office, is currently embroiled in a major sexual assault scandal. This is on the heels of failures to deliver promised changes \u2013 most notably the flagship housing policy has turned into a train wreck that her government is trying to salvage, without much success.\n\nArdern\u2019s performance in New York is not going to be enough to assuage the uneasy feeling that for all Ardern\u2019s claims to be different, it\u2019s very much business as usual.\n\nShe described climate change in her speech at the UN as an \u201cextraordinary threat\u201d but, right now, her response to that threat is looking \u2013 as we say \u2013 \u201cpretty ordinary\u201d.\n\nBryce Edwards is a political scientist and commentator at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand.", "description": "The leader who said the climate crisis was her generation\u2019s \u2018nuclear-free moment\u2019 did not raise the issue with the US president", "authors": ["Bryce Edwards"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33cb8146db9e1e2396baae62c054652dc5631db6/0_76_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=380f72c269fe1d4ddb0f08d88d0ad0ca", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
