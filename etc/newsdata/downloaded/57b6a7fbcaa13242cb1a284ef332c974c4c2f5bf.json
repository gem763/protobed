He also had an affair with leading lady Gene Tierney (right)\n\nPerhaps his most notable mistress was Marilyn Monroe - pictured in between JFK and Robert Kennedy when she famously sung Happy Birthday to the president in 1962\n\nAndersen, who has written biographies of Mick Jagger, Princess Diana and Hillary Clinton, shines new light on Kennedy's heavily-publicized infidelity.\n\nDecades after his assassination, new revelations continue to surface about his lovers who include actresses Anita Ekberg, Gene Tierney, and Marlene Dietrich, and White House intern Mimi Alford, as well as two White House secretaries.\n\nKennedy's other affairs included British-born actress Jean Simmons who said that he 'practically broke down' her hotel room door to demand sex with her.\n\nAngie Dickinson, who starred in the original Ocean's 11 in the 1960s, called sex with Kennedy, 'the most exciting seven minutes of my life.'\n\nThe biography, first published in 1997, will be re-released as an e-book containing new material exclusively seen by DailyMail.com\n\nOne White House secretary, Mary Gallagher, told Andersen that she recalled seeing Hepburn come in to see Kennedy when he was a young senator.\n\n'I remember Audrey Hepburn and I remember how the whole office was impressed when she walked in. She was as graceful as a swan and carried a long, slim red umbrella,' she said.\n\nAt the time Hepburn had just won an Oscar for Roman Holiday and was about to start filming Sabrina with Humphrey Bogart.\n\nAndersen writes that she 'out-Jackied Jackie' with how she presented herself.\n\n'She was extremely intelligent, well-read, and lots of fun,' the book states.\n\n'Audrey had this intoxicating laugh - pretty much what you saw on screen - but she also had this very sexy, very naughty side that the public never saw.\n\n'They managed to keep their affair out of the press, and the fact that it was clandestine only made it that much more intense.'\n\nBut it was Kennedy's affair with Marilyn Monroe - his most famous mistress - that mostly worried wife Jackie, who feared he would be impeached for his bad judgment if it was exposed.\n\nDecades after his death, new revelations continue to surface about Kennedy's lovers who include Swedish actress Anita Ekberg (left)and Days of Wine and Roses star Lee Remick (right) who had a fling with him when she was only 22\n\nActress Angie Dickinson (left) known for her role as Beatrice in 1960 film Ocean's Eleven, described sex with Kennedy as the most 'exciting seven minutes' of her life. British actress Jean Simmons (right) claimed the former president 'practically broke down' her hotel room door to demand sex with her in 1958\n\nNo thank you: One star who did not fall for Kennedy's charm was actress Sophia Loren, who the president allegedly asked out twice to no avail\n\nThe Breakfast at Tiffany's star apparently 'out-Jackied Jackie' in how elegantly she presented herself. Hepburn's relationship with Kennedy managed to stay out of the press and it being clandestine made it 'more intense', the author says\n\nAccording to Andersen, Jackie worried that if Kennedy's relationship with Monroe was made public, she would reveal his affair with Judith Campbell Exner, who was involved with mafia boss Sam Giancana.\n\nBack in the 1960s this would have been seen as an unforgivable lapse of judgment - yet Kennedy wasn't concerned at all.\n\nIn fact, he was mostly worried about being impeached by the Democratic-controlled House and Senate if he wasn't tough enough on Cuba during the missile crisis.\n\nKennedy's other targets allegedly included Hamlet star Simmons who was filming 1958 film Home Before Dark in Boston when he tried to barge into her hotel room but she rebuffed him.\n\nLee Remick, the blond star of Days of Wine and Roses, also had a fling with him when she was 22, six years younger than Jackie.\n\nRemick was described as 'drop dead gorgeous' and the 'epitome of class and intelligence', Andersen writes.\n\nAngie Dickinson described Kennedy as 'the killer type, a devastatingly handsome, charming man - the kind of man your mother hoped you wouldn't marry.'\n\nHer assessment of sex with the former president: 'It was the most exciting seven minutes of my life.'\n\nBut not everyone fell for Kennedy's charm, including legendary actress Sophia Loren, who at the time was 24 and had just refused a marriage proposal from actor Cary Grant, her co-star on the film Houseboat.\n\nMimi Alford (pictured right in 2012) claimed she had an affair with the president when she was a White House intern\n\nKennedy's most scandalous affair is believed to have been with Judith Campbell Exner (left in 1955) because she was also involved with mafia boss Sam Giancana (right)\n\nLadies' man: JFK's friend and former Florida Senator George Smathers said it was rare of the president to 'strike out with anybody' and did not take no for an answer\n\nInstead she intended to marry the film's producer Carlo Ponti.\n\nKennedy sent his friend, Florida Senator George Smathers, to ask Loren out on his behalf and invite her to his Georgetown residence for dinner.\n\nAfter she declined, Kennedy himself tracked her down to ask her personally. He later claimed it worked, but Loren denied it.\n\n'I never saw Jack strike out with anybody if he really wanted to get together with them,' Smathers is quoted.\n\n'He just would not take no for an answer, and he kept it up until he wore them down.'\n\nAndersen also unearths a never-before-seen memo sent to former Secret Service Director James J. Rowley from an agent assigned to the Kennedy children detail.\n\nIt shows Jackie tried to give their sons John F Kennedy Jr and Patrick and daughter Caroline a normal upbringing even though they were the First Family.\n\nThe memo says she 'felt very strongly' that the Secret Service be as distant as possible from the family.\n\n'Mrs. Kennedy is adamant in her contention that agents must not perform special favors for John Jr. and Caroline or wait upon them as servants,' it said.\n\n'Agents are not to carry clothes, beach articles, sand buckets, baby carriages, strollers, handbags, suitcases etc., for Caroline and John Jr. and the children must carry their own clothing items, toys etc....The agent must drift into the background quickly when arriving at a specific location, and remain aloof and invisible until moment of departure.'\n\nFirst Lady Jackie Kennedy (pictured in 1963) was not ignorant to her husband's infidelity, but feared he'd be impeached if they were made public\n\nThe book also reveals a memo in which showed Jackie 'felt very strongly' about the Secret Service being as distant as possible from the children. Above she is pictured with her family on Christmas Day 1962\n\nIt also details how Jackie thought the agents were 'doing too much for the children and felt it was 'bad for the children to see grown men wait upon them.'\n\nShe explicitly stated the agents must 'demand that Caroline pick up her own discarded clothes, shoes, toys, accessories, etc.'\n\nShe even insisted the agents should stay back if she and the children were swimming in the sea.\n\n'Drowning is my responsibility. The Secret Service is not responsible for any accidents sustained by the children in the usual and normal play sessions. This is my sole responsibility,' she said.\n\nShe also refused security for Caroline when she was out riding horses, claiming none of the agents were good in the saddle.\n\nThe memo reads: 'The Kennedy children are better riders than the Secret Service agents and that Caroline was probably safer riding with other children than she would be with a Secret Service agent 'with a very limited knowledge of horses''.\n\nJackie herself had fallen off her horse and broke her collarbone while riding when she was young.\n\nShe said that Caroline had to have her own 'share of riding spills and accidents - how else will she learn?'", "description": "Christopher Andersen details the President Kennedy's secret relationships in a new ebook version of Jack and Jackie: Portrait of an American Marriage, obtained by DailyMail.com.", "authors": ["Daniel Bates For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/13/20280446-0-image-a-88_1572269072917.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
