The title of my speech was \u201cDefending the American Dream: The case against socialism.\u201d\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nNot surprisingly, campus socialists and Antifa groups were unhappy with my invitation. If there is one thing progressives hate, it\u2019s a minority woman who defends American exceptionalism and (gasp!) American capitalism. To them, I\u2019m a traitor to my race and gender.\n\nOne person was caught on camera tearing down the YAF posters advertising my event. I was ready when the woke, social justice warriors (SJWs) showed up to challenge me during the Q&A portion of my presentation.\n\nThe questions asked by the SJWs were largely predictable and full of all the politically correct buzz phrases young college kids are trained to use. Words like \u201cclimate imperialism,\u201d \u201csystemic racism,\u201d and other terms that both disparage America and serve as a protective, virtue-signaling shield they believe will give them a racial and moral advantage in any debate.\n\nThere was one student, however, who wasn\u2019t interested in trying to trip me up or generate a viral moment. This young man, a Chinese foreign exchange student, taught all of us that night a lesson in the dangers of romanticizing socialism and communism.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t talking to your kids -- even those in elementary school -- about the evils of socialism/communism versus the morality and efficacy of American capitalism, you can be sure someone else is.\n\nAfter asking a thoughtful question, I asked him if he would explain to the students in the room how the Chinese social credit system worked.\n\nHe did. He described how the Communist Chinese government tracks its citizens\u2019 phones, internet use, attendance to Communist party events and other activities and uses this \u201cscore\u201d to determine your family\u2019s financial fate, the quality of education your child receives, and whether you will be arrested or punished for thinking the wrong thoughts.\n\nI was alarmed by how many of the students in the room were unaware of this fact of life in Communist China.\n\nAfter the speech, the young man confessed that before answering my question he instinctively scanned the room to make sure there were no other Chinese students for fear of being reported.\n\nThanks to political superstar, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, socialism is trendier than ever \u2013 especially among college students. Membership to the Democratic Socialist Party of America has surged since her stunning congressional win in 2018. The socialist wing of the Democratic Party that she effectively now leads is driving policy, political strategy, and the Democratic presidential primary.\n\nBefore you say, \u201cHey, AOC isn\u2019t talking about Communism, she\u2019s promoting \u2018Democratic Socialism\u2019\u201d (whatever that is), consider Ayan Rand\u2019s warning that there is no real difference: \u201cCommunism proposes to enslave men by force, socialism by vote. It is merely the difference between murder and suicide.\u201d\n\nDuring the last Democratic debate, when journalist Jorge Ramos asked Democratic presidential candidate, Bernie Sanders, about his support for Venezuela and its socialist dictators, Hugo Chavez and now, Nicholas Maduro, he lied to the American people!\n\nSanders said he meant Sweden, not Venezuela. But Sanders is on **record** as a huge cheerleader for the socialist revolution in Venezuela (he is also on tape cheering Fidel Castro\u2019s Communist revolution too).\n\nSander\u2019s website once stated that the American Dream was more likely to be found in Caracas than the United States of America. Then one day a few years ago, he quietly removed that statement from his website. The media never followed up with him on that important edit, and in the end, even Jorge Ramos (who knows better) let him get away with it.\n\nToday, once middle-class Venezuelans eat their pets and dig through garbage cans for food.\n\nDesperate Venezuelan mothers cross the border into Columbia to sell their bodies for groceries they cannot find or afford in Venezuela.\n\nSocialism always leads to hunger, despair, indignities, repression, and death.\n\nTwenty years ago, Venezuelans were sold the same empty lies and promises of \u201cfree\u201d everything that Bernie, AOC, and Elizabeth Warren are peddling.\n\nSadly, my experience on the college speaking circuit has taught me that college students are falling hard for these lies because they are historically and economically illiterate (exhibit A is AOC who graduated from Boston University with a degree in economics) and they take their freedom and prosperity for granted.\n\nSo what can we do? It\u2019s overwhelming and demoralizing to think about singlehandedly taking on the education monopoly, Hollywood, big tech and the formidable social media influence of AOC and other cheerleaders for socialism. But you don\u2019t have to! Like most things, the answer lies close to home. It starts with parents and grandparents who often don\u2019t appreciate that they are the first and most powerful teachers in a child\u2019s life. But we must start early because the indoctrination starts early.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t talking to your kids -- even those in elementary school -- about the evils of socialism/communism versus the morality and efficacy of American capitalism, you can be sure someone else is.\n\nThe family dinner table and the ride to school or soccer practice are more effective venues than the classroom. Don\u2019t be afraid to tell your kids about the millions of people who have died in the name of socialism in the 20thcentury \u2013 their textbooks won\u2019t.\n\nTalk to them about the real-time tragic demise of Venezuela from the richest to the poorest country in Latin America \u2013 Bernie and AOC won\u2019t.\n\nTell them also the good news \u2013 how capitalism delivered the historic economic boom Americans are currently enjoying -- the media won\u2019t.\n\nRemind them that this is a \u201cblue-collar\u201d recovery being most felt by minorities and the working class, the very people socialists claim to speak for.\n\nWhat\u2019s most important is that we make our case to our children and grandchildren with passion and emotion, not just with facts and figures.\n\nCapitalism is not a bad word! It\u2019s a beautiful word. Own it.\n\nCapitalism married with Judeo/Christian ethics is a very, very good thing.\n\nIn all of human history, no other system has lifted more people out of poverty and into the ranks of the middle class and beyond. And no country has done a better job than the United States of America to secure the freedom of its citizens to work hard, prosper and achieve their American Dream.\n\nIf we don\u2019t pass these ideas and values on to our children, there\u2019s a generation of desperate Venezuelans and a young, Chinese college student in Wisconsin who can tell us what our future will look like.\n\nRachel Campos-Duffy is a Fox News Contributor and a mother of eight.
