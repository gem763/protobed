Talks are set to be tense as fears grow in Dublin and Brussels that the British prime minister is backsliding on promises to protect the tightly knit economic and social links on the island of Ireland.\n\n\u201cThe commitment to all aspects and all the provisions of the letter and spirit of the Good Friday agreement recently seems to be taken more lightly than before,\u201d a senior diplomat from a continental member state told the Guardian. \u201cThis avoidance of the hard border, it is not just a desire, it is not just about preferences, it is legal obligation.\u201d\n\nA senior official working for the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, told diplomats this week that the UK had reneged on commitments to protect north-south co-operation on the island of Ireland, a key pillar of the Good Friday agreement.\n\nAlarm bells were set off by Johnson\u2019s recent letter to the European council president, Donald Tusk, which declared his government could not endorse a commitment made by Theresa May in a December 2017 EU-UK joint report.\n\nThe Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, fuelled concerns that the government was seeking to back out of past commitments, when he tweeted that the government was \u201ccommitted to no infrastructure on the NI border\u201d.\n\nSuch comments were seen in Brussels as \u201cmeaningless\u201d words that marked a significant dilution of the promise to uphold an open border. The May government pledged to protect \u201cnorth-south cooperation\u201d on the island of Ireland in the 2017 joint report, widely seen in Brussels as a landmark in Brexit talks.\n\nNorth-south cooperation was a pillar of the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement and covers a swathe of policies such as transport, agriculture, health, education, environment and tourism. The vast web of cooperation means, for example, that patients and ambulances can cross the border, freshwater loughs are jointly protected and Ireland\u2019s single electricity powers millions of homes.\n\nThe vices that led Johnson to the top are useless when it comes to wielding power | Fintan O\u2019Toole Read more\n\nSince coming to office, Johnson has vowed to get rid of the backstop, a fallback plan to avoid a hard border that would see Northern Ireland maintain many EU rules, and the whole UK stay in a customs union with the EU.\n\n\u201cThey seem to be taking a different starting point to May,\u201d one EU official said. \u201cThey want something completely different.\u201d\n\nA UK government spokesperson firmly rejected suggestions the government was not committed to the Good Friday agreement. \u201cWe are committed to the common travel area, to upholding the rights of citizens of Northern Ireland, to ongoing north-south cooperation, to retaining the benefits of the single electricity market. We remain firmly committed to peace in Northern Ireland and the Belfast agreement.\n\n\u201cThe Belfast/Good Friday agreement neither depends upon, nor requires a particular customs or regulatory regime. The broader commitments in the Belfast/Good Friday agreement include parity of esteem, partnership, democracy and a peaceful means of resolving differences. This would be best met if we could explore solutions other than the backstop.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have been clear that we are happy to accept a legally binding commitment not to put infrastructure, controls or checks at the border. We hope the EU do likewise.\u201d", "description": "Accusations come as PM is set to meet Irish taoiseach Leo Varadkar in Dublin", "authors": ["Jennifer Rankin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2258dcbea52f73db2f41d77edd15467e33a10e2a/115_0_5823_3495/master/5823.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=33102bd3c9914ead6f4ccc30294ac675", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
