Her son, Raheem, has taken to sending match balls across the Atlantic every time he scores three goals. \u201cI\u2019ve bought an extra six cases just in case I do score a hat-trick,\u201d he said.\n\nSix may have seemed a surfeit for a man who began March with just one to his name in senior football. Four more have followed for club and country since then. At this rate, Sterling may have to consider buying in bulk. His second hat-trick of the campaign was his first in the Champions League. Atalanta, leading 1-0 until Sterling intervened, left the Etihad Stadium eviscerated 5-1. He had made two, scored three. An 11-minute treble was his quickest and, given the stage, perhaps his most prestigious.\n\nThere is no purer example of Pep Guardiola\u2019s ability to transform players. From Xavi to Ilkay Gundogan, Sergio Aguero to Thomas Muller, Sterling to Lionel Messi, a raft of players have registered the most productive season of their career under the Catalan. Where Sterling is in still more rarefied company is that he keeps doing it: 23 in 2017-18, 25 in 2018-19, 12 already for City this year. For club and country, he has 16 in 17 matches. It used to be the mark of a top striker to average a goal every other game. Sterling is the winger almost averaging one per match. City have 212 since the start of last season.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

It is speed allied with relentlessness. Sterling personifies it. \u201cThe day after a game he could play another,\u201d Guardiola said.\n\nSterling showed a different kind of relentlessness. An hour after the final whistle, he was branding it a \u201cperfect night\u201d. His immediate reaction, however, was: \u201cI should have had four.\u201d The one that got away, the missed chance when he rolled a shot wide, still occupied his thoughts even though City were 5-1 up at the time. \u201cI\u2019ve got to finish that one,\u201d he reflected. His team-mates shared those sentiments. As he left the pitch, Riyad Mahrez was raising four fingers to indicate his possible haul.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

A player with his acceleration enjoys a high defensive line. One as irrepressible and irresistible could capitalise when the visitors looked to go man for man; pity the poor individual \u2013 Rafael Toloi, in this instance \u2013 tasked with policing Sterling.\n\nThe key to his transformation from occasional to invariable scorer is that his goals are not spectacular. The most flamboyant thing he has done this week was the delightful scooped assist for David Silva\u2019s opener at Crystal Palace. Sterling is not relying on 25 wonder goals a season. There is a simplicity to scoring, an Aguero-esque element, and not just the precision required for his second goal. That came from 12 yards, his first and third from around six each. He is the poacher in the guise of a flair player.\n\n\u201cAll the credit is for him,\u201d said Guardiola. It has become a mantra for him that Sterling deserves the praise for his evolution.", "description": "There is a glass box in Nadine Sterling\u2019s house in Jamaica that is getting rapidly fuller.
