Add Interest\n\nTrump has denied affairs with the women.\n\nCongressional investigators had planned to take up the matter after federal prosecutors ended their investigation into the payments in July without further charges.\n\nAP Photo/Markus Schreiber, File\n\nTrump\u2019s former personal attorney and long-time fixer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations and claimed Trump directed him to make the hush-money payments to Daniels. Prosecutors said in charging documents that \u201cIndividual-1,\u201d who matched the description of Trump, directed Cohen to make the payments but did not identify the president by name. Trump has denied ordering Cohen to break the law.\n\nCohen originally said he made the $130,000 in payments from his home equity loan account and was later reimbursed in checks written by Trump or the Trump Organization, payments that Trump's lawyers eventually acknowledged.\n\n\"... Cohen acted with the intent to influence the 2016 presidential election,\u201d prosecutors wrote in a memo recommending prison time for Cohen. They continued, \u201cCohen coordinated his actions with one or more members of the campaign, including through meetings and phone calls, about the fact, nature, and timing of the payments.\u201d\n\nPablo Martinez Monsivais/AP, FILE\n\nWhen asked in an exclusive interview in December with ABC News Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos if the president also knew it was wrong to make the payments, Cohen replied, \u201cOf course,\u201d adding that the purpose was to \u201chelp [Trump] and his campaign.\u201d\n\nThe new investigation comes as committee Democrats are broadening their investigation into potential obstruction of justice and determining whether to draw up articles of impeachment against Trump.\n\nMore than 130 House Democrats now support pursuing impeachment against the president, more than half of the caucus. The committee is planning additional public hearings and witness interviews well into the fall focused on several of the episodes of possible obstruction of justice detailed in Mueller\u2019s report, as well as other matters that could be considered impeachable offenses.\n\nThe Washington Post first reported the committee plans to investigate the circumstances around the hush-money payments.\n\nFederal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York announced in December they had reached an agreement with American Media Company, Inc. (AMI), the publisher of the National Enquirer, in connection with a payment made during the campaign meant to silence a woman who claimed to have had an affair with Donald Trump in 2006.\n\nMcDougal signed a $150,000 deal with AMI in August 2016 that transferred to the company the rights to her story of an alleged 10-month romantic affair with Trump in 2006.\n\nIn July, the committee voted to approve a dozen subpoenas as part of the panel's investigation into alleged obstruction of justice and public corruption by President Trump.\n\nAmong those names considered were Daniels' former attorney Keith Davidson, longtime friend of Trump and CEO of AMI, David Pecker, and National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard. The three are expected to be subpoenaed as early as this week for testimony in October, sources said.\n\nPecker was granted immunity by federal prosecutors last August in exchange for information about Cohen.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
