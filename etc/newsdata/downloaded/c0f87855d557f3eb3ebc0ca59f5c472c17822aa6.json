Pepe is cheaper alternative to Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang for Arsenal\u2019s favourable run of fixtures and is owned by less than 4% of managers.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nNicolas Otamendi\n\nYes, we are tipping the same Nicolas Otamendi who calamitous defending led to Norwich City\u2019s third goal last weekend. Why? Because he is the only fit centre-half that Manchester City have left.\n\nDespite last Saturday\u2019s horror show at Carrow Road, the City defence is among the most dependable in the top-flight and has generous run of games coming up, starting with Watford\u2019s trip north on Saturday.\n\nMoussa Djenepo\n\nDespite being eased into his new surroundings at Ralph Hasenhuttl\u2019s Southampton after his \u00a314m move from Standard Liege this summer, Djenepo has scored twice in just 123 Premier League minutes.\n\nCan he keep it up? The 21-year-old is certainly an enticing prospect at just \u00a35.4m and with a miniscule ownership. A visit from Bournemouth\u2019s porous defence should not put any prospective buyers off.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It was the second time in two weeks he had failed to find the net, but we are keeping the faith.\n\nNorwich are Burnley\u2019s visitors to Turf Moor this weekend and though Daniel Farke\u2019s side can be thrilling, they lack a degree of control. Barnes will fancy his chances against the Premier League\u2019s leakiest defence.\n\nSerge Aurier\n\nTottenham Hotspur kept their first clean sheet of the season last time out with a sub-\u00a35m attacking full-back who forced an own goal. If he can keep his place once Juan Foyth returns from injury, Aurier could be a steal.\n\nA trip to the King Power this weekend may not appear promising but Leicester are struggling for attacking fluency under Brendan Rodgers, with too much safe possession play and not enough penetration.\n\nHonourable mentions: Vicente Guaita, Lucas Digne, Todd Cantwell, Richarlison, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.", "description": "Nicolas Pepe Arsenal\u2019s record signing has failed to hit the ground running, with one meagre assist in his first five games, but it is surely only a matter of time before Pepe begins to pay back his \u00a372m fee.", "authors": ["Mark Critchley"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/13/11/1171565913.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
