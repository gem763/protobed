As President, I will immediately begin work to end the new Cold War and nuclear arms race, end our interventionist foreign policy of carrying out regime change wars, and redirect our precious resources towards serving the needs of the people here at home. As such, I will not be seeking re-election to Congress in 2020, and humbly ask you for your support for my candidacy for President of the United States.\n\nShe\u2019s at 1.3 percent today in the RCP average, par for the course for the entire campaign thus far, so no, she\u2019s not retiring because she\u2019s too busy planning her presidency. Might she be retiring because \u2026 she has a serious primary challenger in her House race, one who\u2019s already made hay of her unusual skepticism about impeaching Trump? Voters in her very blue district have noticed:\n\nTwo out of three Democratic primary voters in Hawaii\u2019s 2nd Congressional District say U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard should give up her presidential aspirations, according to a new survey released Tuesday by Public Policy Polling. The poll also found that at least half of the voters in Gabbard\u2019s district would prefer someone else in her House seat.\n\nShe led her primary challenger by 22 points in the same poll, which was published earlier this month, but Gabbard won her last primary by more than 60 points. And her opponent might have received the endorsements of some big-name Democrats who are irritated by Gabbard\u2019s friendliness with the populist right. She could have lost. At a minimum, she would have been forced to take more doctrinaire Democratic stances than she seems naturally inclined to take in order to appease primary voters.\n\nSo if she\u2019s not running for Congress again and she\u2019s also not going to get within a thousand miles of the presidency, what\u2019s she planning to do with herself next year? Hmmmm:\n\nSCOOP: @TulsiGabbard breaks bread with Wall Street fat cats at @huntandfishnyc; event sponsored by Dem fundraiser @robertwolf32 as she is said to weigh third-party run more now @FoxBusiness @TeamCavuto dotcom story to come \u2014 Charles Gasparino (@CGasparino) October 24, 2019\n\nSo Hillary was \u2026 right? Not about the \u201cRussian asset\u201d thing but about Gabbard possibly angling to become a Jill Stein third-party candidate who\u2019ll pull just enough votes from the Democratic nominee to enable a Trump victory?\n\nWorth noting: The Hunt and Fish Club is Trump-hating Anthony Scaramucci\u2019s restaurant. And according to Fox Business, the host of the event was \u201cWall Street Democrat\u201d Robert Wolf, with various other \u201cWall Street executives and potential donors\u201d reportedly in attendance. Wolf is an interesting character, a Barack Obama buddy but also enough of a centrist to have become a contributor to Fox News in 2016. He\u2019s not a guy whom you\u2019d assume would want to groom a candidate who\u2019s a sort of left-wing Ron Paul with a special affinity for Bashar Assad as a kamikaze option against Joe Biden or another centrist nominee.\n\nSo if Wolf really is thinking of Tulsi as a third-party possibility, it\u2019s likely for one of two reasons. One: He might prefer a second Trump term to a Warren presidency if that\u2019s the choice next fall, given the risk that Warren will take a flamethrower to the financial industry if elected. Maybe he\u2019s eyeing Gabbard as someone who could jump in if Warren becomes the nominee and try to siphon off some votes from her among Berniebros. Two: He\u2019d probably prefer a Joe Biden presidency to a second Trump term (he\u2019s a Democrat after all), so maybe he thinks Gabbard could potentially be weaponized against Trump if need be. She probably has more fans in Tucker Carlson\u2019s audience than in Rachel Maddow\u2019s audience. It may well be that a Gabbard third-party run would end up hurting Trump more than the Democratic nominee by attracting Ron Paul fans who\u2019d otherwise back the president.\n\nThe logic there is contradictory, though. In scenario one, Gabbard helps Republicans. In scenario two, she hurts them \u2014 even though progressives would be far more open to a left-wing independent candidate if Joe Biden ended up as nominee than if Elizabeth Warren did. So, really, I don\u2019t know what Wolf\u2019s game is. All I know is Gabbard is going nowhere in the Dem primary, no longer has to worry about her House race, yet seems very intent on continuing her presidential run.\n\nHere\u2019s a brief clip of her last night on the highest-rated show on Fox News, hosted by the president\u2019s close personal friend Sean Hannity, backing up the White House attack line that there\u2019s not enough transparency in the Democratic impeachment inquiry. In no sphere of reality does it make sense to do that if you\u2019re a Democratic presidential candidate who\u2019s resolved to remaining a Democratic presidential candidate. It\u2019d be like John Kasich announcing a primary challenge to Trump and then going on Maddow to call for the president\u2019s impeachment and removal. All it\u2019ll do is piss off your target voters. It doesn\u2019t even make sense to do this if Gabbard is eyeing a left-wing third-party run, since of course progressives hate Hannity and Trump too. It must be that she\u2019s simply repositioning herself as a sort of generically populist media \u201cpersonality\u201d who knows her fan base is entirely on the right.
