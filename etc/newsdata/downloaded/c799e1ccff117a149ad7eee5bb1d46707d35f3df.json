But add in YouTube, Mixer, and other sources and the event had an estimated global audience of over 7 million \u2013 even though no-one is entirely sure what\u2019s going to happen afterwards.\n\nAs of Sunday evening, you can\u2019t get into the game and the only thing you can see in the livestream is a picture of the black hole that sucked in everything at the end of the event.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObviously Fortnite isn\u2019t really over, even if the original map that has been in use, in one way or another, for the last two years seems to be gone forever.\n\nFor months now there has been rumours about a new map and on Friday a leaked bit of promo art seemed to show exactly that, with what will likely be called Fortnite: Chapter 2 in English.\n\nThe promo art is very low resolution but shows a map that still features some recognisable landmarks, such as Tilted Towers, but also new features such as a river and boats.\n\nEven with that leak though nobody knows when the game will be back and playable, and it could be several hours yet.\n\nWhatever Epic have done to their servers it\u2019s even caused the Epic Games Store to go down, even if you\u2019ve never even played Fortnite on the PC.\n\nHowever, if you really don\u2019t want to stop playing you can input the famous Konami code (\u2191\u2191\u2193\u2193\u2190\u2192\u2190\u2192BA) into the game as it is now and play a little 2D shooting game while you wait.\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nMORE: Fortnite Chapter 2 leaked with brand new map and\u2026 boats!\n\nMORE: Parents sue Fortnite for being too addictive\n\nMORE: Fortnite season 11 start date delayed, as Fortnite sales drop 52% in a year", "description": "The nightmare of every fan has come true: Fortnite has been switched off by Epic Games and you can\u2019t currently play it\u2026 but for how long?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screenshot_3-a142_1570997917.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
