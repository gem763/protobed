Photo: Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nToday, one of the avatars of late-twentieth-century moderate Republicanism, long-time Michigan Governor William Milliken, died at the age of 97. As the Detroit Free Press noted, he was identified with causes you really don\u2019t associate with the GOP these days:\n\nDuring his years in office, Milliken \u201cshunned the extremes and sought to govern from the center,\u201d wrote Michigan environmentalist Dave Dempsey in his 2006 biography, \u201cWilliam Milliken: Michigan\u2019s Passionate Moderate.\u201d\n\nHe was known as a champion of Detroit and the state\u2019s environment, working closely with the late former Detroit Mayor Coleman Young, and pushing for Michigan\u2019s bottle deposit law, among other initiatives.\n\nAs it happens, the year Milliken left office after 14 years as governor, another midwestern pol began his national career with an election to Congress: Ohio\u2019s John Kasich. Famed right off the bat as a hard-core conservative who only split with the right wing of his party if there was taxpayer money to be saved, Kasich spent a long time reflecting the growing conservative ascendancy in his party, as Lisa Miller observed in a 2017 profile of the perhaps-once-and-future presidential candidate:\n\nHe rose to prominence in Congress as a swaggering combatant during Newt Gingrich\u2019s revolution and, even having served as governor of Ohio since 2011 \u2014 an established Republican if ever there was one \u2014 he still thinks of himself as an upstart outsider. \u201cI was in the tea party before there was a tea party,\u201d he boasted when he was running for governor.\n\nAfter his unsuccessful effort to stop Donald Trump\u2019s nomination in 2016, Kasich was one of the few Republican Trump critics who never came around to an endorsement of the mogul, and even allowed as how he wrote in John McCain\u2019s name on his November ballot. So perhaps it\u2019s not surprising that he has become the most prominent Republican pol, so far, to call for Trump\u2019s impeachment, as CNN reported:\n\nFormer Ohio Gov. John Kasich said President Donald Trump should be impeached, a major switch for a former Republican presidential candidate who had previously said there was not enough evidence to impeach the President.\n\nKasich, who\u2019s a CNN senior political commentator, told CNN\u2019s Ana Cabrera Friday the \u201cfinal straw\u201d for him was White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney\u2019s Thursday admission that military aid was withheld from Ukraine in order to pressure that country for investigations into Democrats.\n\nPerhaps Kasich\u2019s position is a harbinger of things to come\u2013if not from other Republican pols then for previously Republican voters\u2013or perhaps he will remain isolated. But it\u2019s clear he\u2019s a symbol of how rapidly his party, and particularly its conservative wing, has moved into Trump\u2019s orbit, leaving him in principled opposition. Another such symbol is Mitt Romney, of course, who is stubbornly independent of the jealous would-be God in the White House, as the Associated Press reported:\n\nMitt Romney hasn\u2019t yet decided whether President Donald Trump should be impeached, but the Republican senator from Utah on Thursday stuck by criticism that has earned him a stream of insults from Trump on Twitter.\n\nRomney said that while he thinks some things the president has done are wrong, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean Trump should be removed from office.\n\n\u201cI will keep an open mind until and unless there is some kind of decision reached by the House, and then I will evaluate that information at that point,\u201d he said, referring to the House impeachment inquiry. \u201cIt\u2019s a purposeful effort on my part to stay unbiased and see the evidence as it\u2019s brought forward.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s some distance from the standard GOP \u201cThis is all a witch hunt!\u201d line. And that\u2019s another symbol of how far and fast Republicans have moved. Mitt was the \u201cmovement conservative\u201d candidate for president in 2008, and only won the nomination in 2012 by making himself totally acceptable to the right wing of his party. Like John Kasich, he\u2019s only a \u201cmoderate\u201d in the very relative terms of the Trump Era.\n\nBut there are some historical echoes here. Mitt\u2019s father George was by any reasonable assessment a genuine moderate\u2013perhaps even liberal\u2013Republican. He was especially a champion of civil rights. And you know who his running-mate and successor as governor was, when Romney joined Richard Nixon\u2019s cabinet? That\u2019s right: Willliam Milliken. Republicans have taken a long, dark road down since then.", "description": "2016 Republican candidate, and a hard-core conservative, John Kasich, came out for Trump\u2019s impeachment just as genuine moderate, William Milliken, died; his predecessor was George Romney, father of Mitt, another conservative hostile to Trump.", "authors": ["Ed Kilgore"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2016/02/29/29-john-kasich.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
