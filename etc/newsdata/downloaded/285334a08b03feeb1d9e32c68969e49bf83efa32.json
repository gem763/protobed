In contrast to his predecessors, Reagan saw outer space as humanity\u2019s final frontier and as an opportunity for global leadership. His optimism and belief in American exceptionalism guided a decade of U.S. activities in space, including bringing the space shuttle into operation, dealing with the 1986 Challenger accident and its aftermath, committing to a permanently crewed space station, encouraging private sector space efforts, and fostering international space partnerships with both U.S. allies and with the Soviet Union.\n\nDrawing from a trove of declassified primary source materials and oral history interviews, John M. Logsdon provides the first comprehensive account of Reagan\u2019s civilian and commercial space policies during his eight years in the White House. Even as a fiscal conservative who was hesitant to increase NASA\u2019s budget, Reagan\u2019s enthusiasm for the space program made him perhaps the most pro-space president in American history.\n\nJohn Logsdon is a world-renowned historian and analyst of space issues. He is the author of John F. Kennedy and the Race to the Moon and After Apollo? Richard Nixon and the American Space Program, both award-winning, definitive accounts of presidential space policy, and his most recent book is Ronald Reagan and the Space Frontier. Professor Logsdon is Professor Emeritus at the George Washington University\u2019s Elliott School of International Affairs and founder of its Space Policy Institute.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_optimized/public/images/2019-09/GettyImages-1144591728.jpg?itok=hJ36mAjt", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
