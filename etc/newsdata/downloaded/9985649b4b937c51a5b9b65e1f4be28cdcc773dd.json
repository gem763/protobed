Three years after the referendum, with passionate Remain campaigners gathering at the Palace of Westminster\u2019s gates, would MPs vote for a Brexit deal that would finally get Britain out of the EU?\n\nYet, as is fitting for the tortuous debate around Brexit that has engulfed and paralysed parliament, the dramatic day ended with a further delay and senior MPs believing Downing Street was hatching another plan to force through its deal.\n\nIn between came an extraordinary cocktail of parliamentary drama, agonised decisions and political scheming. The chamber was full to bursting by the time Boris Johnson rose to his feet as the session opened. The penalty for non-attendance was clearly high. One MP had struggled in despite having had an operation earlier in the week.\n\nWith the numbers on a knife-edge, his opening address was aimed at his real audience. Gone were the accusations of surrender that had so angered MPs weeks earlier. He had dropped the combative tone in favour of a low-key, calm cross-party appeal.\n\nHe said he would \u201ccontinue to listen\u201d to MPs throughout the day and \u201cmeet with anyone on any side\u201d. He said he believed Britain would keep the \u201cbest tradition of the highest standards of environmental protections and workers\u2019 rights. No one anywhere in this chamber believes in lowering standards,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead we believe in improving them.\u201d\n\nThere was no surprise in his pitch. With Northern Ireland\u2019s DUP MPs abandoning Johnson because of the way the region was being treated in his deal, it had become clear that the key to victory would come from independent and Labour MPs, who had long wavered over voting through Brexit but never gone through with it. And they were, believed many Labour and government sources, almost ready to do the deed.\n\nThere was just one problem. A big one. Oliver Letwin\u2019s amendment, which would be voted on before MPs got the chance to vote on Johnson\u2019s deal, would make it clear that final approval was being withheld until the legislation needed to implement it was in place. It was an insurance policy, drawn up by the former cabinet minister to stop Britain crashing out of the EU with no deal should the government fail to pass the new laws needed. If the Letwin amendment passed, the government would not get its moment of truth on the new Brexit deal.\n\nA huge operation had been launched to change Letwin\u2019s mind about tabling his amendment. He was brought into Downing Street on Friday night to discuss it. Yet their best efforts could not sway him. By Saturday morning, No 10 aides were openly frustrated. The meaningful vote would become another \u201cmeaningless vote\u201d, they said, prolonging the Brexit agony. Despite rumours of Letwin\u2019s plan circulating for a week in Westminster, they were blindsided by its effects. \u201cI\u2019m just frustrated because I really thought we could get there today,\u201d said one government official.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Oliver Letwin was called into Downing Street to change his mind on his plan on Friday.

There were two dynamics at work. On the plus side for the government, the chances of building a precious majority in favour of the Brexit deal were rising. However, a majority for the Letwin plan also seemed to be in the offing.\n\nGood news for the government had come that morning, when the hardline European Research Group decided to back the deal. That began a domino effect that saw all the hardline pro-Brexit Tory MPs fall in line.\n\nThen there was the swing group of former Tory MPs who had lost the whip over opposing a no-deal Brexit. Could they be won over? Government officials hinted that some could be offered the party whip back if they voted the right way. They were boosted when two, Steve Brine and Alistair Burt, said they would vote for Johnson and against Letwin.\n\nAs for the Labour whips, could they stop their MPs backing the Brexit plan? Things seemed to be getting serious when one of them was spotted carrying a roll of thick, black duct tape. In reality, the whips felt they had been hugely helped by an interview with John Baron, a member of the ERG, who had said he backed the Johnson deal because it left open the possibility of a no-deal Brexit once the transition period finished at the end of next year. That had made their argument for them \u2013 that Johnson could not be trusted to deliver protections to workers\u2019 rights and environmental standards that he had been using to attract Labour MPs to his cause.\n\nSuddenly, it looked like Letwin\u2019s attempt to reserve judgment on the new Brexit plan might fall short. The key now appeared to be the DUP. They would not vote for Johnson\u2019s deal, but could the government at least persuade them not to vote for Letwin\u2019s delay? Johnson decided to try to speak to them. Everything seemed to hang on how they would vote.\n\nWhen the votes came, supporters of Letwin\u2019s plan to delay the crucial votes on Brexit were worried. The DUP had not turned up to vote immediately. Had they been persuaded to abstain? With just a minute to go, they appeared and voted for Letwin. Their support turned out to be crucial, with their 10 votes deciding the result.\n\nVictory for the Letwin amendment meant that Johnson had to send a letter demanding a Brexit extension from the EU. Yet in an extraordinary moment, Downing Street aides refused to confirm to journalists that the letter would be sent. \u201cGovernments obey the law,\u201d was the only comment, pointing instead to Johnson\u2019s vow that he would not negotiate a further Brexit delay.\n\nI really have no idea what is going on! Government minister\n\nOutside parliament, the blare of the People\u2019s Vote rally could be heard. Yet in a now almost empty chamber, another twist emerged. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Commons leader, announced that , the government intended to try the whole thing all over again \u2013 and have another meaningful vote on the Johnson deal.\n\nAs he left Westminster, Letwin said it was a \u201cblatant attempt to reverse\u201d the safeguards against no deal that his successful amendment had put in place just hours earlier. By having another meaningful vote, he said, the government could effectively tear up the extension letter written to the EU and ensure that the choice facing MPs was \u201cmy deal or no deal\u201d by the end of the month. Suspicious at what was unfolding, the speaker indicated he wouldn\u2019t let the government stage such a vote. It sets up another week of extraordinary votes \u2013 and adds more complication to the tortured Brexit story.\n\n\u201cGames, games, games,\u201d said one former cabinet minister, heading home. \u201cPeople out there thought we were coming here today to make a decision. And now we have to do it all again.\u201d\n\nAnother minister spoke for many. \u201cI really have no idea what is going on!\u201d", "description": "Prime minister is adamant he won\u2019t renege on his deadline pledge", "authors": ["Michael Savage"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52d2616c53fd0fbc320da6d6273c0470c4a5b302/0_27_2189_1313/master/2189.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=137940c9f8be009e9cccf673f7fe2987", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
