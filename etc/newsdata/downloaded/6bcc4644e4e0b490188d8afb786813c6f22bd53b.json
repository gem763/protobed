The early Galaxy S phones were good, but not great, and were such close copies of the iPhone that Apple sued Samsung over them and won.\n\nIt took Samsung a few years to hit its stride with high-end hardware, and the last few Galaxy S phones have been considerably better, if a bit predictable. This year\u2019s Galaxy S10 family is no different: these are high-end phones with cutting edge technology and sleek designs.\n\nWhat Samsung has gained over the past 10 years is an identity. The Galaxy S10 is distinctly Samsung \u2014 it\u2019s not a copy of the iPhone or any other device you can buy. In fact, it almost feels like the opposite of the iPhone: if you\u2019ve been frustrated with Apple\u2019s recent devices for lacking headphone jacks, adding notches, or removing fingerprint scanners, Samsung is here for you with a headphone jack, a fingerprint scanner, and a notchless screen design (that has some other compromises). It feels a bit like the S10 is the anti-iPhone.\n\nThat isn\u2019t to say there aren\u2019t similarities between Apple\u2019s flagship and Samsung\u2019s. For one thing, both are expensive: the Galaxy S10 starts at $899.99, while the S10 Plus that I\u2019ve been testing for the past week starts at $999.99. You can even option an S10 Plus out to a staggering $1,600 \u2014 that\u2019s nearly three times the starting cost of the popular OnePlus 6T.\n\nThe other thing that the S10 shares with the iPhone is a lack of a compelling differentiator from its previous iterations. Sure, the screen is bigger and there are some incremental advancements in performance and battery life, but an S10 is not going to change much for you if you have a Galaxy S8 or S9.\n\nThat said, the S10 is one of the best phones you can buy right now, and the best Galaxy S phone Samsung has ever made. It\u2019s just going to cost you.\n\nLike last year\u2019s Galaxy S9 and the Galaxy S8, the S10\u2019s hardware is very nice, which you\u2019d expect from a device this expensive. The best way to describe it is refined: plenty of phones have curved screens, glass backs, and metal frames, but few feel this nice to hold or well put together. Samsung is now on Apple\u2019s level when it comes to fit, finish, and feel, and well ahead of Google, OnePlus, and other Android device makers.\n\nOn the top-tier S10 and S10 Plus, the front and rear glass curve into the metal frame, which makes the phones easier to hold, even though they have very large screens. The curved screen has been a Samsung trademark for a few years, and while some might not like it, I don\u2019t have any issues with it.\n\nSamsung brings the most polished and refined hardware to the Android table\n\nCurved screen or not, the S10 Plus is a big phone, and not one I can comfortably use one-handed. If I were to buy it, I\u2019d probably put a case and a PopSocket on it to make it easier to manage. For those who want a smaller phone, there\u2019s the standard S10, which is still fairly big, and then the new, smaller S10E, which we\u2019ll cover in a separate review.\n\nThe S10 Plus\u2019 refinements extend to things like its vibration motor, which is much nicer feeling than many other Android phones. It\u2019s not quite as good as Apple\u2019s class-leading Taptic Engine, but it\u2019s not buzzy and irritating, either. It provides nice feedback for typing on the keyboard.\n\nUnlike the iPhone, the Pixel, and many other phones, the S10 still has a headphone jack at the bottom, next to its USB-C charging port. There are also stereo speakers that are loud and full sounding for when you\u2019re not wearing headphones.\n\nThere are also the Galaxy S mainstays: IP68 water resistance; fast wired and wireless charging (with a fast charging brick in the box); and microSD card support for expanding the phone\u2019s storage. The base model S10 comes with 128GB of internal storage, which I think most people will be happy with. Both the iPhone or Pixel provide less storage in their base configurations and don\u2019t give you the ability to expand it with a microSD card.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S10 and S10 Plus specs: Screen: 6.1-inch / 6.4-inch \u201cDynamic AMOLED\u201d display, Quad HD+ resolution in a 19:9 aspect ratio\n\nRear cameras: Wide angle 12-megapixel (77-degree) lens, telephoto 12-megapixel (45-degree) lens, and ultra wide 16-megapixel (123-degree) lens\n\nSelfie camera: 10-megapixel, 8-megapixel RGB depth camera (S10 Plus)\n\nDimensions: 70.4 x 149.9 x 7.8mm, 157 grams (S10) / 74.1 x 157.6 x 7.8mm, 175g (Ceramic: 198g) (S10 Plus)\n\nProcessor: Snapdragon 855 (in the US, Exynos in some regions)\n\nMemory: 8GB or 12GB RAM\n\nStorage: 128GB to 512GB (1TB on S10 Plus), expandable via microSD\n\nBattery: 3,400mAh (S10) / 4,100mAh (S10 Plus)\n\nOS: Android 9 Pie with Samsung One UI\n\nConnectivity: Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5, LTE Cat.20\n\nWireless charging, USB-C, headphone jack\n\nYou can even use the S10 to wirelessly charge another device, like Samsung\u2019s new Galaxy Buds headphones or Galaxy Watch Active smartwatch, but I haven\u2019t really found much use for this feature beyond showing it off.\n\nThe main annoyance with the S10\u2019s hardware is the same as the last few Samsung phones: there\u2019s a dedicated side button for the Bixby virtual assistant. Samsung is finally making it possible to program this button to launch other apps and shortcuts \u2014 but it\u2019s blocking the ability to set the Google Assistant or other virtual assistants to this button, so you\u2019ll still have to resort to a third-party app if you want to do that.\n\nAside from the hardware design, the main head turner with any Samsung phone is the display, and the S10 Plus\u2019 does not disappoint in the least. It\u2019s a 6.4-inch OLED panel with rich, vibrant colors and excellent viewing angles. It gets extremely bright for use in direct sunlight, and has enough resolution that individual pixels are impossible to see with the naked eye. The screen stretches all the way to the top and bottom of the phone, with just the slimmest of bezels above and below it.\n\nSamsung seems to have toned down its aggressive saturation, and the \u201cNatural\u201d mode, which is what I\u2019ve been using, looks very nice and drops the eye-searing neon colors Samsung was known for. Samsung claims the S10\u2019s display is the first on the market to feature HDR10+, which is supported by Amazon\u2019s Prime Video and YouTube. (Apple\u2019s flagship iPhones support the competing Dolby Vision standard, which the S10 does not. None of these really look like HDR on a TV.) Netflix doesn\u2019t yet offer HDR on the S10 line, but it will likely be updated to support it shortly after the phone is available to buy.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s any stretch to say that the S10\u2019s screen is one of, if not the very best, screens on any phone available right now.\n\nPerhaps more interesting than the screen itself is what\u2019s embedded in it. Though the display stretches to the very top edge of the phone, the S10 doesn\u2019t have a notch cutout for its front facing camera. Instead, Samsung is using an offset \u201chole punch\u201d design, which allows the camera to poke through the screen on the right side. On the S10 Plus, this houses two cameras: the main camera and a secondary one for depth effects and portrait mode.\n\nThis design lets Samsung avoid the oft-criticized notch look, but it also means that the battery and network indicators are awkwardly pushed off-center to the left. A notch design has similar compromises, but it\u2019s at least symmetrical: notifications and clock are on the left, battery and network indicators are on the right. The off-center look of the hole-punch design just looks worse to me.\n\nYou can choose to hide the front cameras entirely with a uniform black bar across the top, but that just makes the S10 Plus look like it has a giant \u201cforehead\u201d bezel. Depending on what app you\u2019re using, that black bar might show up anyways \u2014 it\u2019s there when I read articles in Pocket, regardless of my display settings.\n\nThe other new thing that\u2019s embedded in the screen is the fingerprint scanner, which has been moved from the back of the phone. The S10\u2019s scanner is ultrasonic, which is supposed to be more reliable and harder to spoof than the optical in-screen fingerprint scanners we\u2019ve seen on the OnePlus 6T and other phones. It even works if your finger is wet.\n\nBut it\u2019s not as fast or reliable as the traditional, capacitive fingerprint scanner on the back of the S9. The target area for the reader is rather small (though the lockscreen will show you a diagram of where to place your finger) and I had to be very deliberate with my finger placement to get it to work.\n\nI was able to unlock the S10 with a video of my face played on another phone\n\nEven then, I often had to try more than once before the S10 would unlock. I\u2019d just rather have a Face ID system that requires less work to use, or at the very least, an old-school fingerprint scanner on the back of the phone. The S10 does have a face unlock feature, but it\u2019s just using the camera to look for your face and compare it to a previous image \u2014 there\u2019s no 3D mapping or anything. I was actually able to unlock the S10 with a video of my face played on another phone.\n\nSamsung says it developed the ultrasonic scanner because feedback from customers said they wanted the fingerprint reader on the front of the phone, and this design allowed for more screen real estate than placing a capacitive sensor in a bezel below the screen. The S10 also lacks the iris scanning login option of older Galaxy models, which would have required more sensors than the new hole-punch screen design has room for. The company told me that it will continually adjust and optimize the face scanner\u2019s performance leading up to the S10\u2019s availability.\n\nBut here\u2019s my feedback to Samsung: go copy Apple\u2019s Face ID system. It\u2019s far easier and more reliable to use than the S10\u2019s nifty-looking but ultimately disappointing in-screen fingerprint scanner.\n\nThe S10\u2019s camera system is similar to the S9 Plus\u2019, but instead of just two cameras, it has three. There\u2019s the standard wide camera (12 megapixel, f/1.5 optically stabilized lens), the now-familiar telephoto camera (12 megapixel, f/2.4 optically stabilized lens), and a brand new ultrawide camera (16 megapixel, f/2.2 lens) all mounted on the back of the phone. This system gives you a level of versatility you just can\u2019t match with an iPhone or Pixel \u2014 you can go from super wide shots all the way to portrait close ups with just the press of a button on the screen. It\u2019s like having a whole camera bag full of lenses built right into your phone.\n\nThe ultrawide camera is ideal for sweeping landscapes or cityscapes, and lets you capture significantly more in the frame. But it\u2019s so wide that it distorts heavily at the edges \u2014 Samsung really needs to do more post-processing correction after the image is taken to lessen the distortion. Still, it can be very fun to shoot with and offers a perspective you just can\u2019t get on many other phones.\n\nAside from the new lens, camera performance hasn\u2019t changed much from prior Samsung phones. The S10\u2019s camera is still very good, with fast focusing, fast launching, and generally great performance in most lighting situations. But it still has the familiar Samsung look: overexposed images and warm white balance. If you didn\u2019t like the way pictures looked from the S9, you probably aren\u2019t going to like the S10\u2019s photos.\n\nWarm white balance can be good for portraits, but Samsung\u2019s tendency to overexpose images for brighter shots also makes skin tones look weird a lot of times. The S10 will also aggressively smooth skin to reduce noise, especially in low light shots.\n\nSamsung\u2019s HDR hits a nice balance between the moodiness of Google and the extreme lifting of the shadows by Apple\n\nThe one area that Samsung hits a nice balance between the Pixel and the iPhone is with HDR: it\u2019s not as moody as Google\u2019s photos, but it doesn\u2019t pull up the shadows in weird ways like the iPhone does. That\u2019s partly because it doesn\u2019t need to, since it\u2019s already overexposing more than the iPhone would, but the HDR does look more natural than Apple\u2019s as a result.\n\nOne weird quirk: the S10\u2019s portrait mode uses the main camera instead of the telephoto, so portrait shots come out pretty wide. It\u2019s like how the iPhone XR works, as opposed to the XS.\n\nGrid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, Samsung has added new software tricks to the camera: the AI-powered scene detection mode now has 30 different scenarios it will recognize, and it has a feature that will help you compose your shots better, which is cool because it can help avoid crooked horizons in your photos. It does have a night mode, but unlike the Pixel, you can\u2019t just turn it on whenever you want. You need to be in a really dark area \u2014 less than 1 lux \u2014 and be using the AI scene optimizer mode for it to trigger. And even if you do all that, it still doesn\u2019t work as well as Google\u2019s Night Sight.\n\nOver on the video side, though, the S10 is way more impressive than the Pixel and even gives the iPhone a run for its money. You can shoot in up to 4K at 60 fps with the main camera, or 4K at 30 fps with the ultrawide or telephoto. There\u2019s a new Super Steady stabilization feature that makes really smooth footage, but that will lock you to 1080p and the main camera when you turn it on. Finally, the stereo sound recorded by the S10 is really quite good, and better than I\u2019ve heard from most other Android phones.\n\nFor the front camera, the new 10-megapixel sensor with autofocus produces very sharp images, and there\u2019s a button to get a little bit wider of a shot if you\u2019re shooting a group selfie. (Amusingly, this does not use the S10 Plus\u2019 second front camera for a wider view, it\u2019s just cropping in and out from the same image.) Thankfully, the beauty modes are all turned off by default, but the image does start to fall apart in low light. The portrait mode on the S10 Plus is also pretty decent, but not perfect, much like any other phone\u2019s portrait mode. There are a couple of new effects that you\u2019ll probably use once and then never touch again, just like Apple\u2019s Portrait Lighting stuff.\n\nFor many years, Samsung phones had beautiful, capable hardware that was let down by lousy software. I\u2019m happy to say that\u2019s not the case with the S10. Its software isn\u2019t perfect, and there is still room for improvement, but overall it looks nice, makes sense, and is mostly easy to use.\n\nSamsung is calling this software One UI, and it\u2019s running Android 9.0 Pie as its base. Most of the goal of One UI is to offer a cohesive look and feel makes it easier to use these big-screened phones. In that respect, Samsung has been successful: a lot of the important stuff you need to access is down at the bottom by your thumb.\n\nThe S10\u2019s One UI software looks nice, makes sense, and is mostly easy to use\n\nSamsung also includes many of the Android 9 features Google debuted last year, such as the Digital Wellbeing service, adaptive brightness features, and the screen rotate button in the navigation bar.\n\nBut I\u2019d still like to see more improvements. Samsung\u2019s take on a gesture interface is so confusing I ended up using the default three button navbar instead. There are also still a bunch of duplicate Samsung and Google apps, like two email apps, two app stores, two browsers, two virtual assistants, and so on. I wish Samsung would just let me choose which ones to install on setup. Further, the S10 Plus I\u2019ve been using is an unlocked model, so you can expect carriers to make this even worse with their own apps on top.\n\nThe nagging question with Samsung software is how long it will take to get updates. Google\u2019s going to release Android Q sometime later this year, and you\u2019ll probably have to wait another six months or so before it arrives on the S10, if last year\u2019s schedule was anything to go by.\n\nThe S10 Plus is the first phone I\u2019ve used with Qualcomm\u2019s new Snapdragon 855 processor, and performance is surprisingly fast and smooth. Apps open without hesitation, scrolling is very smooth, and the S10 never feels like it\u2019s getting bogged down or overwhelmed. It\u2019s hard to quantify this, but the user interface feels more refined than a OnePlus 6T or other high-end Android phones.\n\nThe S10 Plus has the reliable battery life you should expect from all phones this size\n\nSimilarly, the S10 Plus\u2019 battery life has been reliable enough that I just don\u2019t have to think about it or worry that I\u2019m going to run out of charge. I\u2019ve been able to get two days between charges with light usage and had no trouble making it a full day with heavy usage. But it\u2019s a big phone with a big battery, so this is the kind of stamina I expect at this point.\n\nAfter 10 years of Galaxy phones, it\u2019s easy to dismiss the S10 as just another smartphone that doesn\u2019t really offer anything new or groundbreaking. That isn\u2019t necessarily wrong; I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much of a reason for S9 or even S8 owners to run out and spend $1,000 on an S10. Samsung itself is going to release a wild folding phone in two months, and the S10 is just another slab smartphone like we\u2019ve had for years.\n\nBut this is the 2019 flagship Android phone that more people will buy than any other, and it provides as strong an alternative to the iPhone as you can find. It really comes down to personal preference \u2014 are you so married to iOS and iMessage that you\u2019ll never leave, or are you looking for something that has features you just can\u2019t get on the iPhone? If you\u2019re the latter, the S10 is here for you.\n\nThe S10 is the flagship 2019 Android phone more people will buy than any other\n\nLikewise, if you\u2019re debating between the S10 and a Pixel, the question is how important you think software updates and night photography are. If those things aren\u2019t very high on your list, the S10 is better than the Pixel in virtually every other respect.\n\nAnd finally, if you\u2019re wondering whether or not the S10 Plus is worth nearly double the cost of a OnePlus 6T, your extra money will go toward a better display, better speakers, waterproofing, wireless charging, and a much better camera. That might be enough stuff to make it worth it, provided you care about all of that.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that after a decade of Galaxy phones, Samsung knows what its customers want and what they expect. We\u2019ve already seen glimpses of where the next 10 years will take us, but if you\u2019re looking for the best Android phone available today, the S10 Plus is it.", "description": "Samsung\u2019s newest flagship is just one in a long line of Galaxy smartphones, but it still is an excellent premium phone.
