That theory is about to be tested and, if successful, should not only help Republicans keep control of their razor-thin majority in the Virginia legislature on Nov. 5, but prove a happy harbinger for the party in the presidential and congressional contests next year.\n\nNon-politician Nick Bell has decided to take on the \u201cextremist views\u201d that he says have permeated not only the state\u2019s Democratic Party but the national party as well. He jumped into Virginia\u2019s House of Delegates contest when he realized that leading party legislators and elected executives, including the governor as well as the delegate in his own district, were now comfortable supporting infanticide, the killing of babies at the moment of birth and even after they have physically left the womb.\n\nMr. Bell can\u2019t believe that such \u201cbarbarity\u201d is backed by even the majority of those who consider themselves pro-choice.\n\nMr. Bell thought about running after a pro-infanticide bill was introduced in 2018 by Delegate Kathy Tran, which Ms. Tran has admitted would permit third-trimester abortions even when the mother shows \u201cphysical signs that she\u2019s about to give birth.\u201d Two days later, Gov. Ralph Northam, a pediatrician, defended the right of doctors to allow a perfectly healthy newborn to die after having been completely separated from the mother.\n\nIt was Mr. Northam\u2019s \u201cconsoling defense of infanticide,\u201d as Mr. Bell puts it, that prompted him to challenge 79-year old Democrat Vivian Watts, who has continued to represent the 39th House District in Northern Virginia since 1996. He describes her as an \u201centhusiast of late-term abortion and infanticide.\u201d He notes Ms. Watts was a keen backer of the Tran bill and even opposed the state\u2019s 2003 \u201cBorn-Alive Protection Act,\u201d which prohibits killing babies born alive after a failed abortion attempt.\n\nThough a passionate pro-life candidate, what propelled Mr. Bell into the race was not the abortion issue per se, but \u201cthe fanaticism of some Democrats on this issue, including the governor and my opponent.\u201d He\u2019s also concerned that such views are taking hold in other states as well.\n\nMr. Bell has other issues he believes will appeal to the more moderate and centrist voters in his district. He is flatly opposed to corporate political donations, insisting they \u201cbadly corrupt the political process. Corporations have the incentive to direct unlimited sums to any candidate, no matter how extreme, as long as he or she panders to those very corporations. Why make it easy for businesses and candidates to engage in these corrupt bargains?\u201d\n\nMr. Bell weighs in on financial transparency as well. Ms. Watts hasn\u2019t revealed her tax returns during four decades in public office. Mr. Bell proudly posts his returns on his website. His opponent is a major fan of toll roads, but Mr. Bell says the way they work in Virginia only high-income commuters can afford to use the toll roads regularly during rush hour.\n\nIt costs $159 to save one hour\u2019s worth of commute time using the Beltway HOT lanes, Mr. Bell laments, \u201cso the average worker can\u2019t afford to use these faster lanes on a regular basis.\u201d Mr. Bell would do away with the tolls altogether or, at the very least, consider substantially reducing the \u201ctoll price so even those with modest incomes can wake up a little later in the morning before they go to work and return home for family dinners at a more reasonable hour.\u201d\n\nThe 32-year-old Bell has a unique pedigree for a budding politician. He grew up in his district, graduating from W.T. Woodson High School and William and Mary college. He went to the Dominican Republic as a missionary for six months in 2010. He also lived in Spain for awhile, mastered Spanish, taught English as a day job and played semi-professional basketball at night. Most recently, he was in the policy division of the U.S. Department of Labor.\n\nHis personal hero is his father, the late Jeff Bell. The legendary conservative author, intellectual and political activist played a major role in the triumph of Reaganomics, an economic school of thought which revived the American economy during the Reagan era and, critically, even won over Democrat Bill Bradley, the Hall of Fame basketball star who defeated Jeff in that historic 1978 New Jersey senatorial race.\n\nWhen Jeff Bell died in 2018, Mr. Bradley wrote a glowing tribute to \u201cthat young conservative\u201d who \u201cbecame a good friend\u201d and who had run against him on a tax reform program that Mr. Bradley would eventually embrace.\n\n\u201cWhen I would later become the advocate for tax reform, lowering rates and cutting loopholes, Jeff became an ally,\u201d Mr. Bradley recalled. \u201cI remember after final passage of the \u201886 act going back to my office with my staff and toasting our victory with a bottle of champagne. Jeff was there.\u201d The \u201986 tax reform not only generated a major economic boom during the Reagan years, but became a model for pro-growth economies around the world.\n\nNick Bell says he\u2019s convinced that if he wins there are still enough \u201cBradley Democrats\u201d in the Virginia legislature that will help him advance his pro-life, pro-middle class agenda.\n\n\u2022 Allan H.
