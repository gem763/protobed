No report was filed, however.\n\n\u201cThere was no alert at the right level at the right time,\u201d Castaner told France Inter radio on Monday. \u201cThe warning signals should have been sufficient to unlock a thorough investigation.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI want for any warning sign to be automatically flagged.\u201d\n\nCastaner, who said on Sunday he would not resign over the matter, has been summoned to appear before parliament\u2019s intelligence committee on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to try to find out what these failings were,\u201d the committee\u2019s chairman, Christian Cambon, said on Sunday.\n\nOn Thursday, the minister will appear before a standing parliamentary committee responsible for oversight of the administration. It said in a statement on Monday that it would seek answers about \u201cthe conditions that allowed a criminal attack to take place within the police headquarters\u201d.\n\nIts inquiry would also focus on \u201cthe warning signs that could have alerted to his radicalisation in the workplace\u201d and \u201cmore generally, on the measures taken by the government \u2026 regarding the detection of radicalised agents in the administration and measures taken to protect the public service against the risks posed by such agents\u201d.\n\nInvestigators said Harpon\u2019s personal life had been subject to an extensive background check early in his career, as he worked with classified information as part of the Paris police\u2019s intelligence division. While he did not have a criminal record, he was given an official sanction in 2012 over a case of domestic violence three years earlier.\n\nAn investigation showed that Harpon began wearing traditional Islamic garments for mosque visits, and had started refusing \u201ccertain kinds of contact with women\u201d.\n\nHarpon\u2019s 38-year-old wife was freed from police custody without charge on Sunday after several days of questioning.\n\nPolice found the couple had exchanged 33 text messages shortly before the attack, ending the conversation with \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d (God is greatest).\n\nFrench police have often been targets of jihadist groups such as Islamic State since 2015, from large, coordinated assaults to isolated knife and gun attacks.", "description": "Pressure on ministers to explain how warnings were missed before deadly attack", "authors": ["Agence France-Presse In Paris"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c5d2fb86ac448d4bbbf41b8c7615d1e3501be62/0_311_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=24c364a126a04545128542948c65b670", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
