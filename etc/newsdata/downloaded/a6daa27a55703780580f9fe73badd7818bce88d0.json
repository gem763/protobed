It would not be directly enforced on businesses.\n\nIt is an essentially political commitment, to attempt to massage labour market institutions towards a considerable reduction in the hours worked in the average working week over a decade. This would be a very significant change.\n\nIn an average week, the total of all hours worked by the entire workforce is 1.05 billion. If you assumed the workforce remained the same, then this policy would see total hours worked cut by around 100 million hours.\n\nIn and of itself, it would have a significant effect on the economy. But the opposition argue not just that the policy will not cost the economy, but that individual workers will not get a pay cut. How is such a free lunch, indeed tens of millions of such lunches, possible?\n\nIt requires an epic increase in productivity, how much each worker actually produces, something that has eluded the UK economy.\n\nBusiness organisations fear that this is the cart before the horse, requiring huge capital investment.\n\nThe opposition are essentially trying to grab the benefits of a future decade of technological advancements towards workers, rather than business owners.\n\nWage bargaining\n\nThat said, this does not seem hugely enforceable. The target is an average across the economy, which will only be revealed after the event in national statistics.\n\nThe compulsory element here will be a new Working Time Commission, modelled on the minimum wage-setting Low Pay Commission, which will recommend increases in holiday entitlement from the current 28 days, if the reduction in working hours is not being met.\n\nCompanies will be obliged to take part in sector-by-sector legally binding wage bargaining with unions.\n\nAnd that really is the point of this: providing the muscle of government for a hugely restored role for the unions to strike better working time deals for workers. But Labour also say they want higher wages.\n\nBusinesses will argue that the inevitable result of this will be lower numbers of actual jobs. There could also be a significant effect on labour-intensive public services, such as social care and the NHS.\n\nSome of these issues are acknowledged by Lord Skidelsky. The average hours worked per week by British full-time workers has barely fallen over three decades - by just one hour a week.\n\nThe shadow chancellor wants to communicate that this is not an inevitable economic fact of life, that government can fundamentally act to change such patterns. But they have chosen not to go with the most coercive form of this type of intervention.", "description": "John McDonnell has promised Labour's conference he will cut the working week - but can it work?", "authors": ["Faisal Islam", "Economics Editor"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/112ED/production/_108918307_mcdonnell_pa.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
