I think, you know, this dog-whistle politics is dangerous.\"\n\nOn the second day of campaigning Thursday, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer paid a visit to a daycare in the riding of York Centre in Toronto, where Rachel Willson is running as a Conservative candidate.\n\nEarlier in the day, Liberal candidate Carolyn Bennett tweeted a video showing Willson at a 2017 event, discussing her desire to end abortion through \"pro-life legislation.\"\n\nIs the abortion debate really closed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewScheer?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@AndrewScheer</a>? You\u2019ve chosen to launch your Toronto campaign today in York Centre, alongside your leading anti-choice candidate and campaigner. Her top priority is \"ending abortion\" and \"advancing pro-life legislation.\" Just watch this: <a href=\"https://t.co/zhXWMsrarX\">pic.twitter.com/zhXWMsrarX</a> \u2014@Carolyn_Bennett\n\nResponding to the tweet, Scheer repeated his assurance that he would oppose any measure to introduce legislation on abortion as prime minister.\n\n\"Nothing on this issue has changed for our party. We have always made it very clear that we will not support re-opening the issue,\" he said.\n\nConservative Leader Andrew Scheer says that if he becomes prime minister, his government won't introduce legislation on abortion. The issue is back on the agenda after the Liberals released a two-year-old video of Tory candidate Rachel Willson discussing her pro-life views. 0:53\n\nPolitical strategist Sally Housser said there is a fear among Canadians, especially \"when you see some of the things that are happening at the state level in the United States.\"\n\n\"Just saying kind of: 'OK, we're not going to legislate that abortion is now legal,' is not enough,\" said Housser, who is a veteran of NDP campaigns.\n\n\"There are so many different ways that right-wing governments and right-wing politicians can reduce [or] restrict access to safe reproductive health care.\" she said.\n\n\"I think ignoring it is at our peril. We've got to be proactive.\"\n\nThe first televised leaders debate took place Thursday night, featuring Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh and Green Party Leader Elizabeth May.\n\nTo discuss their performance, and Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau's decision not to take part, The Current's interim host Laura Lynch was joined by:\n\nAmanda Alvaro, Liberal strategist and co-founder and president of PR firm Pomp & Circumstance.\n\nAlise Mills, Conservative strategist and a senior associate at Sussex Strategy Group.\n\nSally Housser, political strategist and veteran of NDP campaigns.\n\nWritten by Padraig Moran.
