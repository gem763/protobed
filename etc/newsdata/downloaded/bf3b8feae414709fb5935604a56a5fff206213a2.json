In July, Boris Johnson opposed \u201csin stealth taxes\u201d that planned to extend the sugary drinks levy to milkshakes, which \u201cseems to me to clobber those who can least afford it,\u201d he said.\n\nCo-author Susan Jebb, professor of diet and population health at Oxford University and a former government adviser, said that the primary issue is that people simply need to eat less sugar.\n\n\u201cPrevious efforts to encourage smaller portions have decreased the size of individual bars of chocolate, but coincided with a growth of so-called \u2018sharing bags\u2019 with no evidence of any substantive decrease in overall consumption.
