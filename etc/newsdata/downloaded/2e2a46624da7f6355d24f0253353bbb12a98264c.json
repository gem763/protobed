Westbrook enters this year 43 away from the record of 181, held by Oscar Robertson.\n\nWestbrook had eight triple-doubles in his first six seasons. He\u2019s had 130 in the five seasons since.\n\nLEBRON\u2019S MILESTONES\n\nLos Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James is nearing several milestones.\n\nHe\u2019s 1,101 points from passing Kobe Bryant for No. 3 on the all-time regular-season scoring list, is two games away from becoming the 40th player in league history with 1,200 appearances, and two starts from passing Bryant again for No. 10 on the career games-started list with 1,199.\n\nHe\u2019s also 522 field-goal tries away from 24,000, and will be the sixth player in league history to get there.\n\nVINCE IS OLD\n\nVince Carter is about to become the first player in NBA history to appear in 22 seasons. And if he plays for Atlanta at Denver on Nov. 12 - or any game after that - he will become the fourth-oldest player to appear in an NBA regular-season game.\n\nThe three oldest: Nat Hickey (45 years, 363 days in his last appearance), Kevin Willis (44 years, 224 days) and Robert Parish (43 years, 232 days). On Nov. 12, Carter will be 42 years and 290 days old - one day older than Dikembe Mutombo was in his final regular-season game.\n\nCarter turns 43 on Jan. 26. He\u2019s older than four current NBA coaches - Charlotte\u2019s James Borrego, Memphis\u2019 Taylor Jenkins, Minnesota\u2019s Ryan Saunders and Sacramento\u2019s Luke Walton.\n\nCarter enters this season with 1,481 games played. That\u2019s fifth all-time; he\u2019s 24 games from passing No. 4 John Stockton, 42 games from passing No. 3 Dirk Nowitzki and 80 games from passing No. 2 Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Parish leads the list with 1,611 games.\n\nDEANDRE DOESN\u2019T MISS\n\nAmong players with 2,000 field goals in NBA history, Brooklyn\u2019s DeAndre Jordan has the best shooting percentage of anyone - .670 entering this season, well ahead of second-place Artis Gilmore\u2019s .599.\n\nTo put that in perspective: If Jordan took 554 shots this season and missed every one of them, he\u2019d still be ahead of Gilmore.\n\nINTERNATIONAL GAMES\n\nThe NBA is going international for three games this season - two in Mexico City, the other in Paris.\n\nThe Mexico City matchups have Dallas playing Detroit on Dec. 12 and Phoenix playing San Antonio on Dec. 14. In Paris, it\u2019ll be Charlotte against Milwaukee on Jan. 24.\n\nThey\u2019ll be home games for Detroit, Phoenix and Charlotte.\n\nDallas will have a bit of a rarity: The Mavericks will play in three different countries in an 11-day span, starting with the game in Mexico, followed by four in the U.S. and then a trip to Toronto on Dec. 22.\n\nREDICK\u2019S STREAK\n\nJ.J. Redick won a state championship in his senior year of high school. He went to the NCAA Tournament in all four of his college seasons at Duke.\n\nAnd in 13 NBA seasons, he\u2019s been to the playoffs 13 times.\n\nPostseason basketball is an annual rite for Redick, a streak he\u2019s putting on the line this season with the New Orleans Pelicans. And Redick mentioned the streak to Pelicans rookie Zion Williamson, another former Duke player, in their first real conversation about the coming season.\n\n\u201cThe last thing I said to him was, \u2018Look man, don\u2019t (mess) this up for me,\u2019\u201d Redick said. \u201cHe got it.\u201d\n\nBETTER SHOTS\n\nNot only did teams take more shots last season than at any time in the last 35 years, they were connecting a pretty good clip as well.\n\nAcross the NBA, teams made 46.1% of their shot attempts last season - the league\u2019s second-best rate since 1995-96.\n\nKINGS\u2019 DROUGHT\n\nSacramento has gone 13 seasons without a playoff appearance, the longest such drought in franchise history - and tied for the second-longest in NBA history.\n\nThe Clippers missed 15 consecutive postseasons from 1977 through 1991. Minnesota missed 13 in a row from 2005 through 2017.\n\nThe Kings are one of only four franchises that currently have playoff droughts of longer than three seasons - the Knicks have missed nine in a row, and the Lakers and Knicks have both missed the last six postseasons.\n\nPLANNING AHEAD\n\nFor those who want to start planning, here are some key dates for the postseason and draft season next spring: Playoffs will start on April 18, the draft lottery in Chicago is on May 19, the draft combine in Chicago is May 21-24, the NBA Finals will begin on June 4 and Game 7 of the title series - if necessary - is on June 21.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The NBA season starts Tuesday night, and here are 10 storylines to follow for the 2019-20 campaign:", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tim Reynolds"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/21/warriors_lakers_basketball_64908_c0-147-3588-2240_s1200x700.jpg?6928f47c14c2420ae4250912fcb443d46bd982bd", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
