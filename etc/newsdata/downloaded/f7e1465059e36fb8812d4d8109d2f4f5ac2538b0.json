It\u2019s such a waste.\n\n\u201cHe was the best player at the Newcastle United Academy.\n\n\"He was unbelievable when he had a football at his feet, but he had a lot of problems off the pitch.\n\n\"He had a lot going on in his head. He was naturally gifted, he just didn\u2019t have the right attitude.\u201d\n\nHe was released by the academy in 2105, and later excluded by Walbottle Campus school where he had been a pupil.\n\n(Image: North News & Pictures Ltd nort)\n\n(Image: Mirrorpix)\n\nHe went on to play at Newbiggin Hall Juniors FC, but was kicked-out after three seasons, when he was 15, for bringing a Stanley knife to training.\n\nIreland was then given another chance at Newcastle Benfield FC, where he spent just one season.\n\n\u201cHe was unstoppable. He was the best footballer in Newcastle at under-9s level,\u201d the coach said. \u201cI can remember watching him and thinking; \u2018This is the best kid I have ever seen\u2019.\n\n\u201cHe was quite a polite kid, but he was very reclusive.\n\n\"He wouldn\u2019t maintain eye contact with you. He didn\u2019t say much. If a big kid had a go he would back off.\u201d\n\n(Image: North News & Pictures Ltd nort)\n\nIreland lived with his mum in the Westerhope area of Newcastle after it is believed his dad died when he was in his early teens, reports The Chronicle.\n\nIreland, who played in centre midfield, was offered one last chance at football success just three weeks before he stabbed Mr Duncan on August 14.\n\nIt is understood he was offered a place on a BTEC course run by the Newcastle United Foundation, which would have given him the chance to study for a qualification while playing football.\n\nBut Ireland rejected the offer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m aware the Newcastle United Foundation had offered him a place on a BTEC course just three weeks before,\u201d said the coach.\n\n\u201cAny kid would have loved to do that. He hit a crossroads in his life, it\u2019s tragic, he was the best footballer I had ever seen. But you can only try so much.\n\n\u201cOn the pitch his knowledge of the game and how it should be played was second-to-none. It\u2019s horrendous what he\u2019s done, but he was always great with me. I have only got fond memories of him.\u201d\n\nAt Newcastle Crown Court last month Ireland pleaded guilty to murder having an offensive weapon, namely a screwdriver, and theft of screwdrivers from Poundland.\n\nHe will be sentenced in December.", "description": "Ewan Ireland admits killing Peter Duncan, 52, after the solicitor held a door open for him at a busy shopping centre in Newcastle in August", "authors": ["Jeremy Armstrong", "Sophie Doughty", "Image", "North News", "Pictures Ltd Nort", "Mirrorpix"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20514656.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-JS195018449.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
