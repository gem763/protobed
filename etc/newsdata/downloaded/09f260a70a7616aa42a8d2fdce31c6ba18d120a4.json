It\u2019s also already drawing attention to Trump\u2019s repeated encouragement, and occasional emulation, of authoritarian leaders.\n\nIn Tuesday\u2019s speech, Trump is expected to say that democracy should be supported, and to tout \u201cAmerican values and the American model.\u201d The idea, according to an administration official, is to promote \u201ca positive alternative to authoritarianism.\u201d\n\nDemocracy watchers, remembering Trump\u2019s past two U.N. cameos, are keeping their expectations low.\n\nThe U.N. General Assembly speaking schedule is arranged based on a combination of tradition, protocol and preferences, and it could change even in the last moments.\n\n\u201cI just hope his speech will surprise us by saying something positive and reaffirming about our commitment to democracy and human rights,\u201d said Larry Diamond, a leading scholar of democracy at Stanford University. \u201cI certainly will be looking to that, but I'm not holding my breath.\u201d\n\nAlready, human rights campaigners are using Tuesday\u2019s lineup to draw attention to what they say is a dangerous moment for freedom around the world.\n\n\u201cRising authoritarianism is one of the gravest challenges that defenders of human rights face every day,\u201d Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s essential that world leaders push back against the lineup of anti-rights crusaders who will open this year\u2019s U.N. General Assembly.\u201d\n\nAnd many of them are pointing the finger at Trump, who has largely cast aside the traditional role of U.S. presidents in speaking out in favor of democracy and human rights.\n\n\u201cEssentially, he has given a pass to authoritarian leaders around the world when it comes to their human rights abuses,\u201d said David Kramer, a former top State Department official in the Republican administration of George W. Bush. \u201cHe focuses on trade, on economics, on security and rarely mentions democracy or human rights.\u201d\n\nThe U.N. General Assembly speaking schedule is arranged based on a combination of tradition, protocol and preferences, and it could change even in the last moments. Brazil\u2019s leader typically speaks first, followed by the U.S. president.\n\nThis year, the Brazilian president happens to be the recently elected Jair Bolsonaro, a right-wing populist who has spoken admiringly of the dictatorship that once ruled in his country.\n\nBolsonaro has reinstated commemorations of the 1964 coup that ushered in a military regime until 1985. He\u2019s also referred to that period of rule, which was marked by torture and repression, as \u201cglorious.\u201d\n\nAfter Trump comes Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, a brutal dictator accused of overseeing massacres and imprisoning numerous political opponents. This past week, a rare spate of protests against Sisi broke out in Egypt; in response, hundreds have been arrested in a still unfolding crackdown.\n\nFollowing Sisi is Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, an elected leader who has increasingly consolidated power and tried to crush dissent.\n\nThe U.N. has long had a fraught relationship with autocratic governments in its membership.\n\nWhile past American presidents have often cozied up to one autocrat or another, Trump has expressed his fondness for authoritarian leaders with a brazenness rarely employed by his predecessors.\n\nHe\u2019s spoken of his \u201clove\u201d for North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un, praised Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin as \u201cstrong,\u201d downplayed Saudi Arabia\u2019s killing of U.S.-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi, spoken warmly of China\u2019s Xi Jinping and reportedly referred to Egypt\u2019s Sisi as \u201cmy favorite dictator.\u201d (On Monday, ahead of their bilateral meeting in New York, Trump called Sisi \u201cmy friend\u201d and called him \u201ca real leader\u201d who has \u201cdone some things that are absolutely amazing in a short period of time.\u201d)\n\nTrump, who praised the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown as a private citizen, has largely resisted speaking out in support of protesters in Hong Kong now pushing for democratic reform amid growing encroachment from Beijing. At times, he\u2019s used the crisis to praise Xi: \u201cI have ZERO doubt that if President Xi wants to quickly and humanely solve the Hong Kong problem, he can do it,\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nA German politician, speaking on condition of anonymity this week, said he increasingly hears people in his country refer to \u201cTrump, China and Russia\u201d in the same breath \u2014 lumping in the U.S. president with countries well down the autocratic path.\n\nTo critics of his leadership style, Trump\u2019s appointment of his daughter and son-in-law to top government positions and his descriptions of media outlets as the \u201cenemy of the people\u201d are alarmingly similar to the actions of autocrats.\n\nGoing into the General Assembly, Trump stands accused of pressuring Ukraine\u2019s leader to investigate the son of Joe Biden, the former vice president who is running to unseat him as president. Trump recently also tried to withhold U.S. aid dollars from Ukraine.\n\nOn Monday, Trump shrugged off the concerns. He claimed, without evidence, that Biden had done \u201ca very bad, bad thing\u201d when it came to his son\u2019s business interests in Ukraine, and that his own moves were aimed at ensuring U.S. funds were spent appropriately.\n\n\"We're supporting a country, so we want to make sure that country is honest,\u201d Trump said.\n\nAnalysts, however, said if Trump tried to instigate an investigation of a political opponent, it was an out-of-bounds move.\n\n\u201cMany authoritarian leaders would recognize this president's tactics as coming straight out of an authoritarian playbook,\u201d said Andrea Kendall-Taylor, a former senior U.S. intelligence officer now with the Center for a New American Security.\n\nWhat Trump doesn\u2019t say or do also matters, critics say.\n\nThe president\u2019s past two General Assembly speeches have focused much more on the value of national sovereignty; his mentions of democracy were narrow and mainly in reference to countries viewed as U.S. adversaries, such as Venezuela and Iran.\n\nSome leaders often skip the gathering. Russia\u2019s Putin and China\u2019s Xi are expected to be no-shows again this year.\n\nEven if Trump does speak extensively Tuesday about promoting democracy, his past actions and comments are likely to undermine his credibility on the issue, observers say. Also damaging to his credibility is how frequently Trump changes his mind.\n\nFor U.S. allies and partners, Trump \u201chas been so unpredictable that they cannot any longer rely on him or the United States when it comes to important matters,\u201d said Ivo Daalder, president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.\n\nWhat\u2019s in little dispute is that democracy has suffered setbacks globally in recent years, the result of rising populist sentiments and crushed democratic rebellions, among other factors.\n\nIn a report released earlier this year, Freedom House, one of the most authoritative organizations tracking democracy, said \u201ca total of 68 countries suffered net declines in political rights and civil liberties during 2018, with only 50 registering gains.\u201d\n\nIt was the 13th consecutive year in which global freedom had declined, the U.S.-based group said.\n\nIts report included a special assessment of the United States, arguing that democracy was on the wane. As one example, it noted that Republican-led Legislatures in Michigan and Wisconsin tried to strip powers from state executive branch offices won by Democrats.\n\nThe trend began well before Trump, mirroring a growing partisan divide in the U.S., but his \u201congoing attacks on the rule of law, fact-based journalism, and other principles and norms of democracy threaten further decline,\u201d the group said.\n\nThe U.N. has long had a fraught relationship with autocratic governments in its membership. The General Assembly is an annual gathering of all the world\u2019s leaders, democratically elected or not.\n\nUnder diplomatic rules, even leaders the United States \u2014 the host country for U.N. headquarters in New York \u2014 has placed under sanctions are allowed to show up and speak during the General Assembly.\n\nUnder Trump, the U.S. has dragged its feet in issuing visas to officials from Iran, a country his administration deems a top threat. There are reports that some of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani\u2019s aides were not granted visas, and that Rouhani\u2019s own visa imposed strict conditions on his movements while in New York.\n\nSome leaders often skip the gathering. Russia\u2019s Putin and China\u2019s Xi are expected to be no-shows again this year.\n\nAlso not expected to show up is one dictator Trump does not like: Venezuela\u2019s Nicolas Maduro.\n\nThe United States and several dozen other countries have declared they do not recognize Maduro as the legitimate leader of Venezuela, which is in dire humanitarian crisis because of Maduro\u2019s alleged corruption and ruinous economic policies.\n\nIn Trump\u2019s past speeches to the General Assembly, Venezuela has been one of the few countries whose government he has singled out for criticism on the issue of democracy and human rights, and he may do so again this year.\n\nThe president has also used Venezuela as a means of boosting his 2020 campaign message against Democrats, arguing they support the socialism that has failed in Caracas.\n\n\u201cThe Venezuelan people are starving and their country is collapsing. Their democratic institutions are being destroyed. This situation is completely unacceptable and we cannot stand by and watch,\u201d Trump said during his speech in 2017.", "description": "From Bolsonaro to Sisi to Erdogan, the early speaking lineup at the U.N.
