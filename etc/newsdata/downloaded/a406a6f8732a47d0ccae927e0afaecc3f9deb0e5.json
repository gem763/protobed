But after one hour you have to say it is okay because we were 2-0 down and came back to 2-2 and also that Tottenham had a lot of chances and could have scored the third goal so at the end it was a deserved draw.\"\n\nLeno went on to praise the character of the Arsenal players and said it was up to him to show his own mental strength to recover from his early mistake.\n\n\"I think the first goal was a little bit unlucky,\" he said.\n\n\"I couldn't catch the ball completely and then I tried to get up but Eriksen scored, it was unlucky but that is the life of a goalkeeper.\n\n\"For me it was then like the team, I had to stand up. It is not a big problem just because we conceded a goal, I had to stay positive and I thought after that I did a very good job.\n\n\"I think it was a very difficult start but then we said as a team on the pitch after going 2-0 down 'we have to stay positive'.\n\n\"There was still an hour to play and we know about the character in this team and also our quality and then after it went to 2-1 you could see that we at least wanted to draw the game and at the end we still had the chances to win.\n\n\"Everybody was going crazy in the last minutes, all the fans and players were crazy and the referee made the right decision, he just said that everyone should calm down so it was okay.\"\n\nWith Lacazette and Aubameyang on form at the other end of the pitch, Leno feels Arsenal have a forward line that can ensure they outscore the majority of their opponents.\n\n\"We know about our character but also about the quality,\" he said.\n\n\"The three players up top, with Pepe also there now, we have unbelievable quality. They can score the big chances but also score from nothing and so the other teams always know and have to be aware that we have a lot of dangerous players and that gives us big confidence.\n\n\"You can see the game against Liverpool (a 3-1 defeat) we had one or two chances to score when it was 0-0 so we can score with our quality in that top three.\n\n\"We can score against everybody but I think the key is always the balance with the defence because in the end that is the most important thing.\"", "description": "Bernd Leno has backed Arsenal\u00a0to finish above Tottenham Hotspur this season because he and his team-mates possess both the character and quality to do so.
