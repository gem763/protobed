Polling on the eve of the SNP conference showed that support in Scotland for independence had risen to 50%. A higher proportion believed Scotland would be better off economically as an independent country within the EU than if it remained in the UK after Brexit.\n\n\u201cNothing is inevitable, but this is by far the closest we have come historically to the breakup of the union,\u201d says Scotland\u2019s foremost historian, Tom Devine. \u201cI have always thought that if [the union] was eventually destroyed, the major battering ram would come from south of the border. A particular strain of English nationalism has now infected the Conservative party, and one wonders to what extent the majority in England will be concerned with the loss of Scotland \u2013 and indeed Northern Ireland.\u201d\n\nCertainly, there are also concerns that ongoing alignment along the Irish border will inevitably fuel calls for a united Ireland. \u201cThere is definitely the sense we are at a pivot point,\u201d says Angus Robertson, the SNP\u2019s former Westminster leader and now managing director of Progress Scotland, an independence polling organisation. \u201cIf Boris Johnson and the Tories are saying now that they have a deal that solves all the problems, it doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 1:53 SNP's Ian Blackford says Johnson's Brexit deal has sold Scotland out \u2013 video\n\nIn recent polling for Progress Scotland of people open-minded or undecided about independence, 61% agreed that Brexit had made independence more likely and 53% said it had changed their personal views on independence. Robertson says these undecideds make up around 20% of the voting public and would be key to the outcome of any referendum.\n\n\u201cPeople also say they want to see the impact of Brexit before they decide to do something else,\u201d Robertson adds. \u201cBut there has also been a growth in support for another referendum within the next two years, and a sense amongst respondents that there is an inevitability to becoming independent.\u201d\n\nCat Boyd, a co-founder of the Radical Independence Campaign, a left-green group that carried out voter registration drives on working-class estates in 2014, says it is striking that five years after the first referendum, ideas that were considered fringe \u2013 a green new deal, workers on boards, opposing austerity \u2013 are now part of the mainstream political discourse in Scotland.\n\nBut Boyd worries about the balance of a coming campaign. \u201cThe independence movement isn\u2019t just the SNP, as we spent a lot of the 2013-14 campaign telling people, but they will have the majority of the money and resources. I worry that they\u2019ll take the working-class vote \u2013 that massive turnout in areas where people never voted before \u2013 for granted. If the next campaign is geared towards the professional middle classes, what is there to motivate the rest?\u201d\n\nDevine suggests there should be some focus on what would happen after a vote in favour of independence. The maintenance of a social union with England, as well as what form of trade barrier would exist with Scotland\u2019s biggest market, would depend of the goodwill of the governing party in London at the time.\n\nFurthermore, there would be a pressing need for reconciliation: \u201cThe governing party in Scotland has a moral as well as political duty to assuage the doubts of those who will still vote against independence in the next referendum. This is a small country and currently split 50/50. It\u2019s difficult to see with such a profound change how those wounds can be healed in the short-term.\u201d", "description": "Polling suggests breakup of union increasingly likely and thoughts turning to aftermath", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79729bf3ff5a9150b5d54aafd7740d4ea677550b/0_0_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4013fe17520a938e3a59f094c563820d", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
