But the huge success of the immersive format, buoyed by its embrace of escapism and risk, has sparked concerns over how much actors are exposed to dangerous interactions with audience members.\n\nIn 2018, BuzzFeed published an expose on complaints of groping or sexual misconduct at the hit Punchdrunk production Sleep No More in New York, where 17 incidents were reported. In the same year, there were two incidents of actors being sexually assaulted at the Great Gatsby immersive show in London.\n\nAlexander Wright, the director behind The Wolf of Wall Street and The Great Gatsby, said the latter experience gave his team a blueprint to make safe immersive theatre. \u201cWhen it happened in Gatsby, we just came down very hard for the next three days,\u201d Wright said. \u201cAt the beginning of the shows we said: \u2018All right, look, this has happened to us,\u2019 we laid out the rules and quickly made all the security systems and put them in place.\u201d\n\nPractices introduced by the Guild of Misrule \u2013 the company that produced The Great Gatsby and The Wolf of Wall Street \u2013 include door security, personal alarm buttons, a code-word system to flag problematic audience members, CCTV cameras, plus a safeguarding, consent and inclusion coordinator, with the overall goal being to ensure cast members are not left exposed or vulnerable. On any given performance there will be 30 staff on hand to manage the 300 audience members taking part in the show.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest There were complaints of groping and sexual misconduct during the run of Punchdrunk\u2019s Sleep No More in New York. Photograph: Jiang Fan Sherlock\n\nWright said reminding his audience of the boundaries and \u201crules\u201d was one of the most fundamental parts of the evening.\n\n\u201cEveryone will get a pre-show email detailing what to expect. On entry to the building, there will be signage, explaining how the rules work. And then before the show starts, everyone in small groups will go through what we call an \u2018airlock\u2019, where you move from the outside world into our world.\u201d\n\nIt comes as Equity, the union that represents professional performers, warned about the \u201cnightmarish\u201d situations immersive theatre performers can find themselves in..\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard some nightmarish cases,\u201d Charlotte Bence, an industrial organiser at Equity, said, adding that the issue wasn\u2019t big-budget productions such as The Wolf of Wall Street or Secret Cinema, but smaller shows that lack the resources and experience to cope with the demands of immersive theatre.\n\n\u201cWe have examples of radios not working in massive spaces where performers are by themselves with audience members and there\u2019s no way to get to the security. CCTV was being monitored by someone who is doing three or four jobs at the same time.\u201d\n\nBence said the main problems stemmed from theatre producers \u2013 who are new to the world of immersive \u2013 not taking security seriously enough and not clearly communicating what is and isn\u2019t acceptable to audience members.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this idea that issuing the audience with instruction then somehow it ruins the experience,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s where the danger is.\u201d\n\nFelix Barrett, founder and artistic director of Punchdrunk \u2013 one of the main companies behind the boom in immersive \u2013 said in 2013 that his immersive company was trying to \u201cbuild a parallel universe\u201d where you can forget about reality for a few hours. The Arts Council describes the sector as one that is \u201cbreaking away from established forms of theatre making and eliminating the fourth wall\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Felix Barrett, right, and Peter Higgin from Punchdrunk.

It would be utterly reckless, and it would be an awful show.\u201d\n\nFor some, immersive theatre is at its best when there\u2019s an air of constructed chaos. Buy a ticket and become the star in your own experience \u2013 serviced and ushered around by a group of actors who know the right buttons to push.\n\nDuring a visit to an old warehouse in the heart of the City of London, where rehearsals for the show were taking place, the Guardian was immersed in a number of imagined scenarios including boarding a plane to Switzerland with a handful of quaaludes, and running up several flights of stairs ducking FBI agents on the look out for any members of Stratton Oakmont, Belfort\u2019s notorious stock trading company.\n\nThe debauched energy that is promised from a production sold in part as an exploration of \u201cthe extremes of capitalism and hedonistic behaviour\u201d is something its star thinks can be harnessed. \u201cEverything\u2019s better on the edge,\u201d said Ollie Tilney who plays Belfort. \u201cYou don\u2019t get that energy on a normal stage. It can be electric. So I guess our job is to get as close to that edge as we can safely try.\u201d", "description": "Theatre company reacts to sexual assaults at previous events like The Great Gatsby", "authors": ["Lanre Bakare"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67e2bc106061a53381f6fafbac4c8c6acc951af8/0_53_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1f70892e9afd1273a12bf49a325a3892", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
