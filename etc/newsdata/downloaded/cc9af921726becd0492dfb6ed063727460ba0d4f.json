There's also Brexit.\n\nHer Majesty turned heads with the opening words of her speech - because they were all about Brexit. She even explicitly mentioned the exit date of October 31.\n\nNow, it's important to note the government - not the Queen - writes the Queen's Speech. And on closer inspection her wording definitely wasn't the gung-ho language of Johnson.\n\nBut it's still a far cry from when she wore a hat resembling an EU flag at the 2017 State Opening of Parliament. So we've reproduced what she said, and had a stab at what it might mean.\n\nWhat did the Queen say about Brexit?\n\n(Image: WPA Pool)\n\nThe Queen opened her speech today by saying the government's \"priority\" has \"always been\" to leave the EU on October 31.\n\n\"My Government\u2019s priority has always been to secure the United Kingdom\u2019s departure from the European Union on 31 October. My Government intends to work towards a new partnership with the European Union, based on free trade and friendly cooperation.\"\n\nWhat does the wording tell us?\n\n(Image: WPA Pool)\n\nOn the one hand, Boris Johnson's inserted the October 31 date into the Queen's Speech. Some might see that as a provocative statement of intent.\n\nBut on the other, what did she actually say? It turns out the Queen used much less firm wording on Brexit than everything else.\n\nThe rest of her speech is littered with firm promises in the present or future tense. \"My government will bring forward.\" \"My ministers will ensure\". \"My government remains committed\".\n\nBut not the bit about Brexit. This was placed firmly in the past tense. And it didn't promise to leave the EU on Halloween - instead saying it has been a \"priority\".\n\nWhat brought on this sudden moderate language?\n\nDid the Monarch, weeks after she was politicised to unlawfully shut down Parliament, signal that she didn't want to be seen to give a view on Brexit?\n\nOr did Downing Street act first - keeping the wording gentle to avoid infuriating the Palace?\n\nWithout a view inside the secretive communications between No10 and Buckingham Palace, we can't know for sure. But it's certainly interesting that the phrase was worded as it was.\n\nDowning Street refused to say if there was a conversation between No10 and the Palace about the phrase. But a spokesman said: \u201cThe language in the Queen\u2019s Speech was the language suggested by the government.\u201d\n\nWhat did she say in 2017?\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe last Queen's Speech in 2017 didn't go as far as today's. It didn't mention an exit date and merely spoke of securing the \"best possible deal\". She also delivered it wearing a hat that resembled the EU flag.\n\n\"My government\u2019s priority is to secure the best possible deal as the country leaves the European Union. My ministers are committed to working with Parliament, the devolved administrations, business and others to build the widest possible consensus on the country\u2019s future outside the European Union.\"\n\nWhy was the 2017 speech so different?\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThis can largely be put down to the government of the day - which was led by Theresa May.\n\nFor all her faults, she tried harder than Boris Johnson to bring together all sides in a Brexit pact.\n\nMeanwhile he is pledging \"do or die\" to leave on October 31, even if it means without a deal.\n\nSo as might have been expected, this harder line is reflected (however gently) in the Queen's Speech - which is of course written by the government.", "description": "The Queen has turned heads by raising the October 31 Brexit date at the State Opening of Parliament.
