Anchiy/Getty\n\nWe resist doing the work that it takes to actually get it because we are so afraid of not having it, any brush with failure makes us rescind our effort and tense up. When we go so long not having what we really want, we create subconscious associations between having it and \"being bad,\" because we have judged others for having it. When we get it, we fear losing it so badly that we push it away from ourselves, so as to not have to withstand the pain. We are so deeply enmeshed in the mental state of \"wanting,\" we cannot shift to a state of \"having.\"\n\nSo, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, when we want something really, really badly, it is often because we have unrealistic expectations associated with it. We imagine that it will change our lives in some formidable way, and often, that's not the case.\n\nWhen we are relying on some goal or life change to \"save\" us in some unrealistic way, any incident of failure will trigger us to stop trying. For example: If we are absolutely certain that a romantic partner will help us stop being depressed, we are going to be extremely sensitive to rejection, because it makes us feel as though we will never get over depression.\n\nOf course, the obvious issue here is that dating is a process of trial-and-error. You have to fail first to succeed.\n\nThen, for all the time we spend not having the thing we want, such as a romantic relationship, our brains have to justify and validate our stance in life as a form of self-protection. This is why we unconsciously vilify those who do have what we want. Instead of being inspired by their success, we doubt them. We become a skeptic about relationships, being so jealous of others' happiness we assume that they must be faking it, or that love \"isn't real,\" or that they'll split eventually, anyway.\n\nIf we hold tightly to these beliefs for long enough, guess what will happen when we finally get that relationship we really want? Of course, we are going to doubt it and assume it will also fail.\n\nThis is what's going on when people push others away, or give up on their big dreams the second something challenging comes up. When we are so scared that we are going to lose something, we tend to push it away from ourselves first, as a means of self-preservation.\n\nSo let's say that you work through the limiting beliefs that are creating this much resistance in your life, and you do eventually allow yourself to build and have the thing you really, really want. Next, you'll be upon the last and most trying challenge, which is the shift from \"survival mode\" to \"thriving mode.\"\n\nIf you have spent the majority of your life in a state in which you are \"just getting by,\" you are not going to know how to adapt to a life in which you are relaxed and enjoying it. You are going to resist it, feel guilty, perhaps overspend, or disregard responsibilities. You are, in your head, \"balancing out\" the years of difficulty with years of complete relaxation.
