The whole full-length is a celebration of women of colour, spanning the globe.\n\nNow in an exclusive mix for 1Xtra, Rapsody is turning her attention to fellow female artists who\u2019ve pushed musical boundaries, past and present. In her words, the mix is \u201cdedicated to a bunch of fly females, to all my ladies and sisters.\u201d\n\nShe combines tracks from legendary artists like Nina Simone and Lauryn Hill, through to new stars (\u201cpeople who I\u2019m repping\u201d) like Ari Lennox and Heather Victoria.\n\nRapsody says: \u201cIt takes you through all the emotions and flavours of being a woman in this world.
