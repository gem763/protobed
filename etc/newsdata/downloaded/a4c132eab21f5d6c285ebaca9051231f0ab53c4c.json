The only topic of interest was impeachment and the disparate strands of inquiry growing out of Trump\u2019s July phone call with the Ukrainian president in which he asked for help in investigating former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nRead: How impeachment is testing Trump\u2019s focus\n\nIf Clinton\u2019s White House famously strived to compartmentalize its handling of the news of the president\u2019s affair with Monica Lewinsky and the resulting impeachment probe\u2014handing off scandal-related work largely to lawyers and political strategists while the rest of the administration focused on routine business\u2014Trump keeps pouring fuel on the impeachment flame with his every utterance, most recently with his public urging that China (and Ukraine) should investigate the Bidens. And Trump has repeatedly insisted he won\u2019t do any business with Democrats in Congress as long as impeachment is on the table. That alone all but guarantees relentless attention to a single storyline.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that this is interrupting them,\u201d says Michael Feldman, who was a senior aide to Vice President Al Gore during the Clinton impeachment and is now a political and communications consultant in New York and Washington. \u201cThis is what they do. You look to your leader for cues about how you should be spending your time. Our leader was saying, \u2018We\u2019re going to get back to the business of the American people.\u2019\u201d\n\nFeldman has vivid memories of the febrile atmosphere in Washington in the days after the Lewinsky scandal first broke in January 1998. \u201cThe White House had kind of shut down,\u201d he recalls. Nobody knew what was going to happen next.\u201d Feldman attended a birthday party for Andrew Friendly, a fellow White House staffer who had been Clinton\u2019s personal aide. He sat at a table with counselor to the president Bruce Lindsey, the director of Oval Office operations, Nancy Hernreich, and the president\u2019s personal secretary, Betty Currie, who would become a player in the running drama because she had helped arrange Lewinsky\u2019s furtive visits to the Oval Office. At the same table sat Friendly\u2019s uncle, R.W. Apple, Jr., then the Washington bureau chief of The New York Times. \u201cAnd we talked about the weather,\u201d Feldman says dryly.\n\nCarl Leubsdorf, then the Washington bureau chief of The Dallas Morning News, has equally intense memories of those first days. \u201cWe were all constantly being asked to go off on wild goose chases,\u201d he told me. \u201cI remember being at a dinner party the Saturday after the Lewinsky story broke and getting a call seeking to match a story by Wolf Blitzer that Clinton was considering resigning. Knowing I had no way to match that, I told the desk that it seemed highly unlikely and that they should be very cautious. It was like that every night for the first couple of weeks.\u201d", "description": "Thanks to a coming media storm, our 45th president is now inextricably linked to impeachment, whether he survives it or not.", "authors": ["Todd S.
