I remember turning up and [Adam] Sandler was there and [David] Spade was there, and I\u2019d known them already and they were like, \u201cLook, Aniston\u2019s here!\u201d\n\n\u2018I met them when I was 20, 21, after I\u2019d done a television show with a guy who knew them.\u2019\n\nIt must have been awkward standing there surrounded by an army of men bar the few women dotted around.\n\nThe 50-year-old confronted the showrunner Lorne Michaels on the lack of women on the show.\n\nThe cast was mostly men in the 1990\u2019s (Picture: Al Levine/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images)\n\nShe said during an interview with Howard Stern for his SiriusXM show: \u2018I was like, \u201cI think that women need to be treated better here.\u201d Because it was such a boys\u2019 club.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018You\u2019re just, not the brightest when you\u2019re in your early 20s. I didn\u2019t lecture him, I was just saying what I would hope if I was to do this, what I would hope it to be.\u2019\n\nJust because she passed on the chance to audition, that didn\u2019t stop the actress from appearing as a host and in cameo roles later on in her career.\n\nSaturday Night Live now has a more diverse cast and crew but recently came under fire when they hired (and then fired) a racist member to the show.\n\nShane Gillis was axed from SNL after racist and homophobic remarks resurfaced on 12 September.\n\nThe comedian came under fire as slurs in a now-deleted video from 2018 came to light.\n\nShane Gillis has been axed from Saturday Night Live (Picture: FilmMagic)\n\nIn the episode of Matt and Shane\u2019s Secret Podcast recorded on 26 September 2018, according to Variety, features the pair imitating Asian accents and mocking Asian people and Chinese food.\n\nIn the first clip, Shane makes anti-Asian remarks such as \u2018ch*nks\u2019 to his podcast co-host Matt McCusker, while adding: \u2018Chinatown\u2019s f***ing nuts.\u2019\n\nOther footage shows Shane making sexist, Islamophobic and homophobic comments, such as \u2018f****t\u2019.\n\nWell, maybe Jennifer wasn\u2019t too wrong for rejecting the boys club almost 30 years ago.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
