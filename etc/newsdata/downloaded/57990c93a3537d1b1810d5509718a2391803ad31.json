It would keep the Hitachi Automotive Systems\u2019 name.\n\nHonda (7267.T) will take a 33.4% stake in the company, Hitachi said in a statement.\n\nThe Yomiuri newspaper reported earlier on Wednesday that the companies were considering the merger. Shares in the three Honda suppliers each ended the day more than 20% higher, surging after an earlier trade suspension was lifted.", "description": "Hitachi Ltd <6501.T> on Wednesday said its vehicle components operations would merge with three Honda Motor Co-affiliated suppliers, creating Japan's third-biggest auto-parts supplier by sales, to better compete to develop next-generation car parts.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
