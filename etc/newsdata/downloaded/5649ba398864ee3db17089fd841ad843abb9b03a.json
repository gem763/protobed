Take the responsibility off the manager, Listen, the manager will stand and fall by results, but there\u2019s no way [after] a 9-0 and that performance I\u2019m going to point the finger at the manager.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Some of those players there were a disgrace really and people think about the extra man in football\u2026 what it does it means its very difficult to go and win a game, it doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t stop the opposition winning a game.\n\n\u2018Now I know it was 1-0 at the time [of Bertrand\u2019s sending off] but there\u2019s no way that shouldn\u2019t just finish 3-0. We\u2019ve been there ourselves, we\u2019ve had the extra man, we\u2019ve been down to ten men it happens a lot in the Premier League, but you don\u2019t see 9-0.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018Even at the start of the second half, Jamie Vardy had another good chance and you\u2019re thinking \u2018where is the backbone in this team?\u2019 An absolutely disgraceful performance that will reverberate around the Premier League.\u2019\n\nThe result plunged Southampton into the relegation zone and Neville suggested that the club could find itself following Sunderland\u2019s path after their fans departed St Mary\u2019s en masse as Leicester piled on the misery.\n\n\u2018I always think its a worry \u2013 and looking at it from a director\u2019s box point of view \u2013 when the stadium is empty. We saw at Sunderland for a period when they were losing badly,\u2019 Neville said.\n\n\u2018These fans here, I\u2019ve always thought of them as being really friendly and fans that would always stay with the team but tonight they were booing them at half-time, booing them at the end, most of them left anyway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It was a terrible night anyway but the stadium must have five or six thousand people in it by the end.\u2019", "description": "Jamie Carragher labelled Southampton's players a 'disgrace' following their dismal 9-0 defeat to Leicester City on Friday night while Gary Neville said that he sees parallels between the Saints and...", "authors": ["Metro Sport Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_92371844_1572081382.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
