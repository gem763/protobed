The company is envisioning this as a way to give young people more ways to start entry-level careers at one of its restaurants, and that apparently extends to artificial intelligence-powered digital voice assistants.\n\nYou can\u2019t actually complete the application process using Alexa or Google Assistant. \u201cAfter beginning the experience via Alexa or the Google Assistant, all they\u2019ll need to do is answer a few basic questions out loud. They\u2019ll receive a text, following their responses to these questions, with a link to complete the application process online. Simple as that,\u201d reads McDonald\u2019s press release. But perhaps if actually using a computer or your phone to start applying to a job at McDonald\u2019s was too much of a hurdle, getting the ball rolling with a hands-free voice request might do the trick.\n\nThe initiative is part of a growing series of tech-adjacent efforts McDonald\u2019s has made over the last few years designed to fashion it as a hip, millennial-friendly brand. The company has struggled over the course of the last decade with the rise of fast casual chains, healthier eating and dieting trends, and shifts in dining culture that have resulted in less late-night drive-thru runs and more mobile app ordering.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s is investing heavily in AI, automation, and on-demand delivery\n\nIn response, McDonald\u2019s has embraced the bold future fusion of AI, automation, and on-demand delivery. It\u2019s also still playing up the nostalgic notion that a McDonald\u2019s gig can be a pleasant, entry-level affair for young people \u2014 and not the type of job that seems ripe to be replaced by the very software and robotics advancements the company is betting the future of its business on.\n\nAn example of McDonald\u2019s more aggressive tech embrace is its massive partnership with Uber Eats, which includes experimental drone delivery, and now DoorDash, as well as the global rollout of its self-order kiosks. On the other end are marketing gems like the \u201cSnaplications\u201d partnership with Snapchat two years ago and now the Alexa and Google-powered Apply Thru. It\u2019s not clear anyone really wants to apply for a job using an AI voice assistant or the Snapchat app. But McDonald\u2019s figures it can\u2019t hurt.\n\nMeanwhile, the real, tech-infused drivers of its business continue to be its shift to accommodate on-demand delivery and its transition into full-scale automation. McDonald\u2019s is currently testing out even more dramatic steps, like actual robots in the kitchen and voice-activated drive-thru systems. The company has also made a number of acquisitions this year, including an estimated $300 million deal for Israel-based AI startup Dynamic Yield, to bring even more AI advancements and personalization to its drive-thru experience, its various in-store and online menus, and other facets of of the business.\n\nThe goal, of course, is to cut costs, keep margins high, and ensure McDonald\u2019s can process, compile, and deliver orders as efficiently as possible all around the world, in both densely packed cities and spread-out suburbs and everything in between. Those sound like exciting problems to work on. But chances are the Apply Thru won\u2019t be accepting applications for those jobs.", "description": "McDonald\u2019s today announced a new initiative the fast food chain is calling the \"Apply Thru,\" in which owners of Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant devices can begin job applications using standard \"Alexa\" and \"Ok Google\" voice commands.", "authors": ["Nick Statt", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5xMpxodEqT2OBsb4jt5LM2b6QaM=/0x0:5000x2618/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19230616/1161630386.jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
