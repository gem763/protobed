A week after essentially greenlighting Turkey\u2019s assault, he announced that he would sanction Turkey for what he called \u201cdestabilizing actions,\u201d raising tariffs on steel and suspending negotiations on a $100 billion trade deal with Ankara.\n\nOn the ground: The American pullback effectively cedes control of the entire country to Mr. Assad and empowers his allies Iran and Russia. It also jeopardizes hard-won gains against ISIS; when forces moved in to the town of Ain Issa on Monday, about 500 ISIS sympathizers took advantage of the mayhem and escaped detention, local officials said.\n\nReaction: A Saudi ambassador called the U.S. withdrawal \u201ca disaster for the region.\u201d Foreign ministers from all 28 E.U. member states agreed to stop selling arms to Turkey, the first time the bloc had reached such a decision about a NATO ally.\n\nA homemade bomb escalates Hong Kong protests\n\nA homemade explosive was detonated on Sunday via mobile phone in the Mong Kok district amid violent protests. It was the first time such a device had been used in nearly five months of demonstrations, the police said on Monday.", "description": "Deutsche Bank's brazen China campaign.", "authors": ["Alisha Haridasani Gupta"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/14/briefing/15Briefing-Asia-promo/15Briefing-Asia-promo-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
