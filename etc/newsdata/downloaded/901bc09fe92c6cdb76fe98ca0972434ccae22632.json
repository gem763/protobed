'That's black and white.'\n\nOne professor of finance said that at a very basic level the inconsistencies looked like 'versions of fraud.'\n\nThe website noted that there can be legitimate reasons for differences between numbers on tax and loan documents - but some of the discrepancies had no reasonable justification.\n\nLaura Feyer, deputy press secretary for New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, told ProPublica: 'The city is looking into this property [Trump International Hotel and Tower], and if there has been any underreporting, we will take appropriate action.'\n\nThe documents were part of records detailing four Trump properties in New York City including Trump Tower to make the properties look more valuable to lenders but less valuable to tax authorities\n\nTrump broke a relatively recent tradition by not publishing his income tax returns as he ran for president as a major party nominee.\n\nHe claims he is unable to release his tax returns because they are under audit.\n\nThere is no specific law that prevents his tax returns from being released, even if being audited.\n\nBut in a 2-1 ruling last week, judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said House Democrats can enforce a subpoena for the documents.\n\nThe ruling upholds a lower court's decision, leaving the president's attorneys with few ways to block his accountants, Mazars LLP, from complying with the House Oversight Committee's demands.\n\nTrump could ask for a new decision from the full D.C. Circuit appeals court. That typical next step would leave him with only the U.S. Supreme Court as a last resort if he loses again.\n\nAn administration official with knowledge of the case said Friday that Trump will 'in all likelihood be headed to the Supreme Court for [legal] relief.'\n\nLast year the New York Times reported how Trump managed to use a 'series of dubious tax schemes' to shield a $400 million inheritance from the IRS.\n\nAs recently as last month, Mother Jones conducted an investigation that found that Trump might have fabricated a loan to avoid paying $50 million in income taxes.\n\nAnd in August, a federal employee told the Ways and Means Committee of possible evidence of 'improper influence' in the IRS's audit of Trump's tax returns", "description": "Newly uncovered tax documents from President Donald Trump reveal 'inconsistencies' that could point to financial fraud.
