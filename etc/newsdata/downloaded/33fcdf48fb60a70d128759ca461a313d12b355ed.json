The 43-year-old also shocked observers by releasing tens of thousands of prisoners and welcoming home once-banned opposition groups.\n\nEthiopia's statement adds \"this recognition is a timeless testimony to the medemer ideals of unity, co-operation and mutual coexistence that the prime minister has been consistently championing,\" using a local term for \"unity.\"\n\nHuman rights and humanitarian groups, meanwhile, urged Abiy to uphold and build on the dramatic reforms that led to his award.\n\n\"Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's work is far from done,\" Amnesty International secretary Kumi Naidoo said in a statement. \"This award should push and motivate him to tackle the outstanding human rights challenges that threaten to reverse the gains made so far.\n\n\"He must urgently ensure that his government addresses the ongoing ethnic tensions that threaten instability and further human rights abuses.\"\n\nThe secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, Jan Egeland, said he was \"astounded\" by Ethiopia's recent achievements, but he was \"equally struck by meeting many of the millions of displaced Ethiopians as a result of ethnic violence\" that has followed the lifting of repressive measures.\n\nThis year's Nobel winners\n\nAbiy's win comes a day after two literature prizes were awarded: the 2018 prize to Polish novelist Olga Tokarczuk and the 2019 award to Austrian author Peter Handke.\n\nThe chemistry prize went Wednesday to three scientists, for their work leading to the development of lithium-ion batteries.\n\nJohn B. Goodenough of the University of Texas.\n\nM. Stanley Whittingham of the State University of New York at Binghamton.\n\nAkira Yoshino of Asahi Kasei Corp. and Meijo University in Japan.\n\nOn Tuesday, Canadian-born James Peebles, 84, an emeritus professor at Princeton University in New Jersey, won half of the physics prize for his theoretical discoveries in cosmology. Swiss scientists Michel Mayor, 77, and Didier Queloz, 53, both of the University of Geneva, shared the other half of the prize, for finding an exoplanet \u2014 a planet outside our solar system \u2014 that orbits a solar-type star.\n\nA day earlier, two Americans and one British scientist \u2014 Doctors William G. Kaelin Jr. of Harvard Medical School and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Gregg L. Semenza of Johns Hopkins University and Peter J. Ratcliffe at the Francis Crick Institute in Britain and Oxford University \u2014 won the prize for advances in physiology or medicine, cited for their discoveries of \"how cells sense and adapt to oxygen availability.\"\n\nIn his will, Alfred Nobel, the Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite, decided the Peace Prize should be awarded in Oslo, but his exact reasons for that are unclear. During his lifetime, Sweden and Norway were joined in a union, which was dissolved in 1905.\n\nThe economics prize wasn't created by Nobel, but by Sweden's central bank in 1968. It is awarded Monday.\n\nWith the prize comes a $918,000 US cash award, a gold medal and a diploma. The laureates receive them at elegant ceremonies on Dec. 10 \u2014 the anniversary of Nobel's death in 1896 \u2014 in Stockholm and Oslo.", "description": "Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed was awarded the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize on Friday for his peacemaking efforts with Eritrea.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5187345.1561381231!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/abiy-ahmed.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
