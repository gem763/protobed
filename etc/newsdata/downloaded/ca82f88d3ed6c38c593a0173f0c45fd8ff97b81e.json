This a very different Labour to the party of Clement Attlee, Harold Wilson, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, who were all part of election-winning administrations that changed our country for the better.\n\nWhen I joined the old Labour Party 22 years ago during Blair\u2019s time, the party was about to start its first term in office. This would see the introduction of the National Minimum Wage, the establishment of devolved government in Scotland, Wales and London, the conclusion of the Good Friday Agreement, huge increases in spending on health and education, big reductions in pensioner and child poverty, and so much more.\n\nAll of this was in spite of the hard left which, at best, had a lukewarm attitude to the party\u2019s social democratic agenda at that time \u2013 indeed they spent much of their energy campaigning against Labour during this period, often as members of other parties. Some agitated against the party from within, like Andrew Fisher, whom I remember turning up to meetings of Streatham Labour Party arguing for the party to take a more leftist direction (he was rarely seen out canvassing \u2013 more on Fisher below).\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nOur monthly constituency party meetings in Streatham featured a spectrum of opinions, but they were good-natured. When people disagreed, they did so in an agreeable fashion, and we usually would head to the pub for a pint after. This was the local Labour Party of around 600 members who selected me as their parliamentary candidate in March 2008. But the local party I left back in February 2019 was barely recognisable.\n\nThere were around two and half thousand members, fewer than 500 of whom had been members before the summer of 2015. At the time I left Labour, most of those who selected me seven years beforehand had resigned from the local party or had stopped attending meetings, which had become unpleasant and often shouty encounters where you were defined by whether or not you were sympathetic to Momentum and a disciple of \u201cJeremy\u201d.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Heckling and pointless points of order were the order of the day. Most of the dedicated group of moderate members who stayed came to dread these meetings too \u2013 you could endure them, but rarely enjoyed any more. In the end, the hard left took over.\n\nThe picture I paint of my local experience was far more rosy than many a tale I\u2019ve heard in the parliamentary Labour Party. A large number of former colleagues have experienced far worse. They\u2019re now fighting to survive the trigger ballot process currently taking place, the rules for which have been changed to smooth the deselection of MPs who are not sufficiently on board with the Corbyn project.\n\nTo see exactly what\u2019s happened to Labour, we need only look to new findings from Mainstream, a new campaign to encourage a return to respectable and responsible politics, and to banish extremism from British politics. It commissioned YouGov to conduct research into Labour members\u2019 views, and the findings are stark.\n\nJust 15 per cent of today\u2019s Labour members are proud of Britain\u2019s history, most blame Britain and not the IRA for terrorist attacks in Northern Ireland, 69 per cent now blame Western governments instead of groups like al-Qaeda and Isis for Islamist terrorist attacks on the streets of Britain or think they are equally to blame as the groups that plan and execute them.\n\nLess than one in four thinks Labour has a serious problem with antisemitism despite the avalanche of evidence under Corbyn\u2019s leadership; the majority think the accusations are down to the media or Corbyn\u2019s opponents. And in one particularly disturbing figure, 51 per cent think a Labour government should take greater control of broadcast media.\n\nThis paints a pretty disturbing picture of illiberal, authoritarian attitudes \u2013 and that\u2019s putting it generously. It also explains why, in order to quash any dissent from St Jeremy\u2019s views, the hard left attempted to abolish the deputy leader, Tom Watson.\n\nThe day before the failed move against Watson, Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary \u2013 in her not-so-subtle campaign to succeed Corbyn \u2013 attacked my party, the Liberal Democrats, for wanting to stop brexit. She compared us to the Taliban for saying that if we win a general election, we will revoke Article 50 and end this Brexit chaos once and for all.\n\nIn so doing, she ignored the 6 million people who signed a parliamentary petition earlier this year calling for just that \u2013 including 23,000 of her constituents and 27,000 of Corbyn\u2019s. As my Lib Dem colleague, Tim Farron, tweeted: \u201cif we really were like a Middle East terrorist group, don\u2019t you think Jeremy would\u2019ve invited us to a conference fringe meeting before now?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to attack your political opponents for wanting to stop Brexit; it\u2019s quite another to abolish your own deputy leader for wanting to do the same. The party leadership attempted to oust Watson for committing the crime of arguing that Labour should be unequivocally making the case for the UK to remain in the EU. Corbyn, a longtime Brexiteer, disagrees, and so Watson must go. All quite extraordinary.\n\nTo top it all off, Fisher, who since I was an activist with him in Streatham Labour had risen up the far left ranks to become Corbyn\u2019s head of policy, resigned after the Watson debacle. In a memo leaked to The Sunday Times, he blamed the \u201clack of professionalism, competence and human decency\u201d at the top of the party. If even a true believer such as Fisher has reached this conclusion, it speaks volumes.\n\nThe truth is it that it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. That\u2019s why so many people are flocking to the Liberal Democrats, the home for social democrats with liberal values, and others besides. The most visible illustration of this was last week at our conference. I bumped into numerous activists whom I\u2019d previously seen at Labour\u2019s gatherings who are now happy members of the Lib Dems. My friend and fellow traveller Luciana Berger needed police protection when she attended the Labour Party\u2019s annual conference last year; there was absolutely no need for this at the Lib Dem conference in Bournemouth last week. Berger was walking around with a big smile on her face, and all of us new joiners could not have asked for a warmer welcome.\n\nI have huge respect and affection for those good social democratic people in the Labour party who have chosen to stay and fight. But my judgement, of course, is that the old Labour Party is gone, and that another route for social democracy and liberalism is required. Fortunately, the Lib Dems offer just that.", "description": "I take no pleasure in watching the ongoing Labour Party implosion in Brighton this weekend. It seems set to continue throughout this week.
