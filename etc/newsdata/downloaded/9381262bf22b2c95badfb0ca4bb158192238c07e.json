A pod of about a dozen dolphins broke the glassy surface off Taiji, the center of Japan\u2019s annual dolphin hunt that continues despite international outrage.\n\nFishermen banged on semi-submerged poles to create an underwater wall of sound, driving the dolphins toward a narrow cove along the hilly, wooded Pacific shoreline about 80 miles southeast of Osaka.\n\nAs the pod entered, a net was drawn across the cove. The dolphins swam in narrower and narrower circles, a calf sticking close to its mother. Then came the sound of thrashing. A slaughter followed \u2014 hidden from view under a temporary tarpaulin roof. The waters of the cove turned pink with blood.\n\nOn this day in early September \u2014 the second of the hunt \u2014 11 Risso\u2019s dolphins were cut up for meat. The calf was released back into the ocean, to face likely death without its mother\u2019s care.\n\nTaiji\u2019s dolphin hunt shot to global infamy in 2009 with the Oscar-winning documentary, The Cove. But the dolphin meat trade is not the main money-spinner sustaining Taiji\u2019s hunt.\n\nOver the following two days, 13 bottlenose dolphins were captured alive \u2014 young, healthy animals selected from the pod by a team of Japanese aquarium trainers working alongside the fishermen.\n\n\n\nFishing boats close off cove with nets to trap dolphins to slaughter in Taiji, Japan, on Sept. 2, 2019 as part of an annual dolphin hunt that has drawn international outrage.

A live bottlenose, the easiest species to train, is worth between $8,000 to $10,000, and more than $40,000 after training, experts say.\n\nThe live dolphins are mostly sent to China, where the marine park industry is booming and largely outside the international rule-making that has turned its back on Taiji\u2019s catch.\n\nChina alone imported more than 200 live dolphins and whales from Japan in 2017 and 2018, trade data shows.\n\n\u201cTaiji is ground zero for the captive dolphin industry,\u201d said Rachel Carbary from the Ric O\u2019Barry\u2019s Dolphin Project, headed by the \u201cFlipper\u201d trainer-turned-activist. Carbary, who came to Taiji to live stream the hunt, is founder of Empty the Tanks, a group campaigning to end all dolphin and whale captivity.\n\nUnder a quota system, Taiji\u2019s fishermen are allowed to catch 1,749 dolphins or small whales from nine species during the six-month hunting season.\n\nDolphins from Taiji have supplied aquariums across the world for decades: Japan, Dubai, Mexico, Thailand, Russia and elsewhere. They have even been purchased by the U.S. Navy for mine detection and other tasks.\n\nBut public outcry led the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA) to forbid its members in 2015 from acquiring dolphins captured by drive hunts such as Taiji\u2019s. Now, China has taken over as Taiji\u2019s main economic lifeline.\n\nIn China, just one out of the more than 85 marine parks and related facilities belongs to WAZA.\n\nNaomi Rose, a marine mammal scientist at the Washington-based Animal Welfare Institute, has used live events and online video streaming in China to raise awareness of the health problems and stress experienced by captive marine mammals.\n\nDolphins typically swim 25 miles a day in the wild and live in complex social groups, she says: hardly surprising they suffer in captivity.\n\nAttitudes in China are changing slowly, she said, but the country is yet to have its \u201cBlackfish\u201d moment, citing the influence of the 2013 American documentary about captive killer whales.\n\n\u201cThe problem is there\u2019s so many people in China that the potential customer base for these places is huge,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nDolphins being trained to be sold to marine parks are held in captivity in Taiji, Japan, on Sept. 1, 2019.

Locals accused the activists of constantly goading them, thrusting video cameras in their faces, and showing photos of dead whales and dolphins to schoolchildren.\n\nRight-wing Japanese nationalists rallied to the cause, and staged counter-protests in Taiji.\n\nThese days the town is calm, but wary. Police trailed Carbary as she went about her filming, while a Coast Guard ship sat off shore to guard the hunt.\n\n\u201cThe people of Taiji have been engaged with whaling for more than 400 years, it\u2019s part of our life,\u201d said Yoshifumi Kai, a senior executive of the Taiji Fisheries Association.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any industries here, and the available land is limited. In this environment, we have no other way but to try to gain our living from the sea.\u201d\n\nBut times may be changing \u2014 slowly.\n\n\n\nActivists protesting dolphin hunting pass by the Daichi Kyo Maru Whaling Research Ship in Taiji, Japan, on Sept. 1, 2019.

That is partly because Japan\u2019s immigration authorities have banned many of them from entering the country. This year, they were replaced with a group of more than 30 Japanese animal rights activists, who marched peacefully through Taiji on Sept. 1 chanting slogans and holding banners to protest killing and capturing dolphins.\n\nOn the way, they marched passed Taiji\u2019s Whale Museum. Inside, oblivious tourists from across Japan oohed and aahed as dolphins performed tricks for fish to cheesy rock music, and children lined up to stroke them.\n\nSpeaking after a recent performance, several families said they seldom or never eat whale or dolphin meat, but all defended Japan\u2019s \u201cfood culture.\u201d\n\n\u201cEating this meat is part of our culture. It comes naturally,\u201d said a 50-year old man from the nearby city of Wakayama.\n\n\u201cForeigners think animals are cute, but you still eat beef, pork, and the like,\u201d said the man, who said he preferred only to give his family name, Go. \u201cIsn\u2019t it the same?\u201d\n\n\n\nDolphins in captivity perform at a show at the Taiji Whale Museum in Taiji, Japan, on Sept. 2, 2019.

(Photo by Shiho Fukada/For The Washington Post)\n\nTaiji\u2019s mayor battles the town\u2019s \u2018evil\u2019 image\n\nTaiji\u2019s mayor, Kazutaka Sangen, is a well-connected political operator, with ties to the senior leadership of Japan\u2019s ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the powerful, conservative pro-whaling lobby. It\u2019s that support that helps Taiji to withstand international criticism, and mobilize the support of the Coast Guard and immigration authorities.\n\nBut Sangen says the town\u2019s relationship with whales needs to adapt.\n\n\u201cThe image of Taiji is evil, but that\u2019s not an image that we want,\u201d he said.\n\nSangen has ambitious plans to turn Taiji into a major center of academic research on whales and dolphins. Instead of keeping dolphins in tiny pens, he wants to throw a net across the nearby Moriura Bay. It would create a giant enclosure the size of around 40 soccer pitches, where tourists can swim and kayak with dolphins and scientists conduct research.\n\n\n\nVisitors watch dolphins in captivity swim at the aquarium in the Taiji Whale Museum in Taiji, Japan, on Sept. 2, 2019.

(Photo by Shiho Fukada/For The Washington Post)\n\nIn 10 or 15 years, the net would be removed in the hope dolphins keep coming back.\n\nWestern marine biologists aren\u2019t keen, seeing the plan as just another way to exploit captive dolphins.\n\nBut Jay Alabaster, who settled in Taiji to work on a doctorate on the dolphin hunt, said the town is beginning to catch up with changing global attitudes about how humans should interact with dolphins and whales.\n\n\u201cTaiji is moving toward a place that even the extreme activists will find more palatable,\u201d he said. \u201cThe town just needs some time and space to get there.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, even Carbary said Taiji\u2019s dolphin hunt needs to be put in a broader context.\n\n\u201cThis is not a Taiji, Japan issue, this is a global issue, because the captivity industry is a global industry,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople need to understand that, if they're planning a vacation down to Mexico and they want to swim with dolphins in captivity, they're encouraging this behavior and this hunting season to continue.\u201d\n\nAkiko Kashiwagi contributed to this report.
