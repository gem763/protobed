The perennial giant-killers ended up being felled by underdogs smaller than themselves. Uruguay\u2019s mainly amateur players were magnificent. They tackled their hearts out and feasted on a plethora of Fijian mistakes. Tears flowed in the stands and on the pitch at the final whistle.\n\nThis was about so much more than just another World Cup game. For Kamaishi as a city, it was an act of cathartic celebration after the devastation wrought by the 2011 tsunami. Surrounded by lush hilly woodland, Kamaishi Recovery Memorial Stadium might just be the most picturesque stadium in world rugby. Certainly it is the most poignant. Built on the site of two former schools which were demolished by the 2011 tsunami that would claim more than 1,000 lives in the city. The current breakwater lies just 500 metres away.\n\nAll around the the stadium there are memorials to the dead, yet for the people this was a means of paying respect while starting what many a calling a new chapter. Around the stadium, there was a brilliant juxtaposition of cultures as Fijians mixed with kilt-wearing Uruguayans and locals desperate to thank anyone who came into contact with them for visiting their city. In among the crowd was the Crown Prince Akishino\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd what a treat they were in for. Uruguay were the last team to taste action in this tournament but few people gave them a chance against a Fiji side that had led Australia for much of their match in Sapporo on Saturday. Los Teros' previous World Cup matches came in 2003 against Georgia and in 1999 against Spain in 1999. Unlike neighbours Argentina, few of their players play full time. Yet what they lack in resources they more than make up for in heart. The likes of outside centre Juan Manuel Cat and flanker Santiago Civetta delivered performances as accomplished as any All Black at this tournament.\n\nThere is a gulf in both talent and pedigree between Uruguay and a Fiji Credit: GETTY IMAGES\n\nFiji were much changed from the side that lost 39-21 to Australia but initially that did not seem to be an issue as hooker Mesulame Dolokoto scored from a well-rehearsed lineout move. Maybe that increased their sense of complacency as a loose Leone Nakarawa offload went to ground. Uruguay reacted quickest and scrum half Santiago Arata beat three defenders to dive under the posts.\n\nFiji looked shellshocked and worse was to come. Vereniki Goneva and Veitokani left a high ball to each other allowing Uruguay to spread the ball wide where Gaston Mieres stepped one defender before Cat sliced the rest of the Fijian defence open by exchanging passes with Rodrigo Silva to score their third try. Their advantage increased as fly half Felipe Berchesi slotted a penalty after Api Ratuniyarawa was penalised for a high tackle to provide Uruguay with a 24-12 halftime lead.\n\nThe question seemed to be how long they would hold on. After Matavesi missed a penalty inside the 22, Ratuniyarawa scored a try virtually under the posts which the fly half also failed to convert. The pattern for the rest of the game was set. Desperate Uruguayan defence and even more desperate Fijian attack. Chance after chance went begging and unlike Fiji, Uruguay had a kicker in Berchesi willing to punish any transgressions as he nudged over his second penalty on 60 minutes.\n\nReplacement scrum half Niko Matawalu brought Fiji back within range sneaking over after a series of pick and goes. But with five minutes remaining Berchesi slotted a difficult penalty to give Uruguay a two-score lead rendering Matawalu\u2019s second try irrelevant. Both Uruguayan supporters and players were in tears.\n\nThis result and the staging of this match deserve to be remembered for a very long time to come.\n\n8:50AM\n\nUruguay deserved the victory\n\nNo-one saw this coming. Uruguay, ranked 19th in the world, had not won a game at the World Cup since 2003. The thought of a victory in this game was not even entertained. Fiji were a fancied side - tipped by many as dark horses.\n\nYet, somehow, Uruguay claimed victory. This was not a lucky win. This was not a win caused by the errors of Fiji. Uruguay were the better side over the course of the game. Their forwards were physical in attack and defence while the backs were controlled by half-backs Santiago Arata and Felipe Berchesi.\n\nFiji had their moments. They started well scoring a couple of early tries but after that it was Uruguay's game. They defended aggressively forcing an uncharacteristic number of handling errors from Fiji.\n\nThe one area of the game in which Uruguay were fortunate was the goal kicking of Fiji - only one conversion was added despite scoring five tries. Josh Matavesi managed to miss one from straight in front of goal alongside trickier attempts.\n\nThis should not detract from Uruguay who despite struggling at scrum-time controlled the game by kicking long and allowing Fiji to attack. When Fiji attacked, they were chopped down and tackled into touch by the abrasive Uruguay defence.\n\nThe World Cup needed an upset and Uruguay delivered it.\n\n8:40AM\n\nHere is the Uruguay captain after the game:\n\nAll the emotion! @RugbyUruguay captain @Juangaminara gives emotional interview after his sides historic win over Fiji, their first Rugby World Cup win since 2003 #RWC2019#FIJvURUhttps://t.co/rYphfFQTHp \u2014 Rugby World Cup (@rugbyworldcup) September 25, 2019\n\n8:20AM\n\nThe small contingent of Uruguayan fans are celebrating with the players like they've won the World Cup - and they should!\n\n8:18AM\n\nDisappointment for Fiji\n\nFiji were hoping to shock one of Australia or Wales to get into the quarter-finals.

They needed that. Lead stays at five.\n\n7:47AM\n\n67 min: TRY! Matawalu Fiji 22 Uruguay 27\n\nMatawalu intercepts and Fiji attack. Chances are emerging but the execution of the passing keeps slowing them down. Nakawara goes through the middle. Botia is on and carries directly.\n\nUruguay hold firm until Fiji go wide and make a break. Just five metres out now. They need to score.\n\nMatawalu dummies - the defender buys it - and he pops the ball over the line. Huge try for Fiji. Great impact from Matawalu so far.\n\n7:44AM\n\n63 min: Fiji 17 Uruguay 27\n\nUruguay take the kick off cleanly. Ormaechea exits successfully. Uruguay get the lineout on the half-way line.\n\nUruguay carry ferociously but Fiji's line speed is starting to return. Another box-kick. Fiji need something soon. They have a lineout. Fiji try to go short but the ball does not travel five - they could not afford that error.\n\n7:41AM\n\n60 min: PEN Berchesi Fiji 17 Uruguay 27\n\nMatawalu is on for Fiji at scrum-half. He won't necessarily bring control but he has the ability to change the game.\n\nUruguay carve through the Fiji defence and into the Fiji 22. The forwards carry tight to the ruck but are repelled. Uruguay maintain possession and substitute Ormachea almost sneaks through. It is slow ball and Uruguay go to the backs. Berchesi steps but slips - penalty to Uruguay! Fiji off their feet at the ruck.\n\nBerchesi to go for goal again - this would be a huge three points.\n\nHe slots it! Lead of ten!\n\n7:36AM\n\n57 min: MISSED PEN Berchesi Fiji 17 Uruguay 24\n\nVolavola is on and he unleashes Nakosi down the right wing.

Fiji will come at them hard after a stern talking to from coach John McKee. Matawalu, Volavola and Botia await on the bench - Fiji need some impetus and they could be the men to bring it.\n\nTough task for Uruguay but on the evidence of the first half they have it in them.

Outstanding from the team ranked 19th in the world. Fiji need to get their act together fast. So many handling errors and a lack of patience in attack is costing them.\n\n7:03AM\n\n39 min: Fiji 12 Uruguay 24\n\nAnother penalty to Uruguay after the kick-off. They miss touch and Fiji counter. The attacked look dangerous but Nakosi loses the ball. He has looked very dangerous but has also been a little sloppy. He does not quite have the quality of his brother Josua Tuisova who has been rested for this game.\n\n7:02AM\n\n38 min: PEN Berchesi Fiji 12 Uruguay 24\n\nPenalty given for the challenge and Berchesi adds three points - Uruguay lead by 12 as we approach half time.\n\n7:00AM\n\nRoyalty in the house\n\nPrince Akishino is in attendance to support the first #RWC2019 match at #RWCKamaishi#FIJvURUpic.twitter.com/JxCcRuUW5O \u2014 Rugby World Cup (@rugbyworldcup) September 25, 2019\n\n7:00AM\n\n37 min: Fiji 12 Uruguay 21\n\nUruguay attack again.

That was close. Fiji are coasting despite the score - they need to switch on.\n\nFiji win the penalty from the scrum. The Fiji front row has been their saving grace this half.\n\n6:52AM\n\n31 min: Fiji 12 Uruguay 21\n\nFiji looked very dangerous in the opening 20 minutes but since then it has been all Uruguay. Superb performance so far.\n\nBerchesi spills the ball after a Matavesi kick. Fiji attack from the scrum - Nakosi sends a defender flying. Radradra takes the ball inside the Uruguay 22.

Arata clears long and Nakawara gathers before throwing an offload - shock. Another offload hits the ground and the ball is popped up to Arata who runs in under the posts from just outside the 22, evading two defenders.\n\n6:30AM\n\n11 min: Fiji 5 Uruguay 0\n\nUruguay started brightly before that lovely move from Fiji. Clinical start.\n\nUruguay carry into the Fijian half before box-kicking. Matavesi is hit hard on the 22 line. Another penalty to Fiji as Uruguay creep offside.
