He was then thrust into the starter's job when then-backup Garret Sparks suffered a concussion in practice, going 2-3-0 with a .914 save percentage and a 2.64 GAA for the Leafs.\n\nIn 111 career NHL games, including 95 starts, the native of Barrie, Ont., is 46-43-13 with a .908 save percentage and a 2.70 GAA.\n\nThe Leafs also recalled goalie Kasimir Kaskisuo on Tuesday from their AHL camp.", "description": "The Toronto Maple Leafs released veteran goalie Michal Neuvirth from his professional tryout on Tuesday.
