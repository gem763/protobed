Ro Khanna (D- CA) said President Donald Trump should \u201ctone down\u201d his rhetoric about the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi because it could be used \u201cto help al-Qaeda and ISIS recruit.\u201d\n\nKhanna said, \u201cI give the president credit for ordering the operation. I don\u2019t give him credit for then saying our troops should be taking Syrian oil, and going and bragging and calling \u2014 making a mockery of how Baghdadi was killed because I think that\u2019s just going to help al-Qaeda and ISIS recruit. But sure, he ordered the operation. It was a successful operation. Every American should cheer for that.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI hope he will tone down the rhetoric. There is no reason to gloat over it and insult Baghdadi and let that video be a recruiting tool for ISIS and al-Qaeda.\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "On Monday's broadcast of\u00a0CNN's \"The Situation Room,\" Rep.\u00a0Ro Khanna (D- CA) said President Donald Trump should \"tone down\" his rhetoric about the death | Clips", "authors": ["Pam Key"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/04/2016_election_house_ro_khanna_war_afghanistan_withdrawal-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
