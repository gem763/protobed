(Stringer/Reuters)\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) has voiced his displeasure on Twitter at comments made by President Trump to reporters Wednesday morning on Turkey\u2019s invasion of Northern Syria, in which the president said the conflict \u201chas nothing to do with us\u201d and the Kurds are \u201cnot angels.\u201d\n\nDuring a joint press conference with Italian president Sergio Mattarella later in the day, Trump doubled down on those remarks, saying that \u201cthe PKK . . . is probably worse at terror and more of a terrorist threat in many ways than ISIS.\u201d\n\n\u201cI firmly believe that if President Trump continues to make such statements this will be a disaster worse than President Obama\u2019s decision to leave Iraq,\u201d Graham tweeted, before calling the situation \u201ca complete and utter national security disaster in the making.\u201d\n\nHowever, I firmly believe that if President Trump continues to make such statements this will be a disaster worse than President Obama\u2019s decision to leave Iraq. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 16, 2019\n\nThe statements by President Trump about Turkey\u2019s invasion being of no concern to us also completely undercut Vice President Pence and Sec. Pompeo\u2019s ability to end the conflict. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 16, 2019\n\nGraham has long been an outspoken critic of Trump\u2019s desire to reduce the presence of U.S. forces in Syria. In December 2018 he said it would be an \u201cObama-like mistake,\u201d before warning in January that it would \u201cset in motion enthusiasm by the enemy we\u2019re fighting.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, in the wake of Trump\u2019s decision to pull U.S. forces out of Northern Syria, clearing the way for the Turkish invasion, Graham vehemently criticized Trump\u2019s \u201cdisaster in the making.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis impulsive decision by the president has undone all the gains we\u2019ve made, thrown the region into further chaos, Iran is licking their chops, and if I\u2019m an ISIS fighter, I\u2019ve got a second lease on life,\u201d Graham told Fox & Friends last week. \u201cTo those who think ISIS has been defeated, you will soon see [that it hasn\u2019t]. And to Turkey, you have destroyed the relationship, what little you had with the U.S. Congress, and I will do everything I can to sanction Turkey\u2019s military and their economy if they step one foot into Syria.\u201d\n\nGraham also said that Trump\u2019s comments \u201ccompletely undercut\u201d the U.S. peace delegation led by Vice President Mike Pence that was slated to leave Wednesday to meet with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan in hopes of negotiating a ceasefire. Erdogan said earlier Wednesday that Turkey will \u201cnever declare a ceasefire\u201d in Syria, but confirmed that he would meet with Pence after initially refusing to do so.", "description": "Senator Lindsey Graham voiced his displeasure at comments by President Trump to reporters Wednesday morning on Turkey's invasion of Northern Syria.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Kevin D.
