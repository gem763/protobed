Last month, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell below the two-year yield for the first time since 2007 \u2014 a kind of inversion viewed by many as a strong signal that a recession is likely in the future.\n\nAccording to the ABC-Post poll, 46% approve of how Trump is handling the economy, down from 51% in July.\n\nThe poll also shows a sharp partisan divide on views of the economy: 9 in 10 Republicans say the economy is in excellent or good condition, while 33% of Democrats believe so.\n\nSix in 10 Americans believe that a recession is \"very likely\" or \"somewhat likely\" within the next year.\n\nA majority of Americans, 56%, disapprove of Trump's handling of trade negotiations with China.\n\nCNN reported that Trump privately has begun to express concern over the economy and has instructed aides in recent weeks to develop proposals to boost Americans' wavering confidence in the economy.\n\nWhile he pushes aides to develop plans to strengthen consumer confidence, Trump isn't backing down from his trade war with China.\n\nLast week, the latest round of tariffs went into effect and more are on the way, which could hit consumer confidence at a delicate time for the US economy when the manufacturing sector is buoyed by consumer spending\n\nThe ABC/Post poll was conducted by telephone from September 2 to 5, among a random national sample of 1,003 adults.
