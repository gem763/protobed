I wouldn't answer the phone. I wouldn't answer the door. I didn't wash, I didn't get dressed. It was sordid. Awful.\n\n(Image: Hulton Archive/Getty Images)\n\n\"Eventually, I realised that if I carried on for a couple more days, I'd either overdose or have a heart attack. I had no idea how to live, but I didn't want to die.\"\n\nElton checked in to a hospital in Chicago to be treated for his addictions to cocaine, alcohol and food, but it wasn't until he was put on the Alcoholics Anonymous 12-step programme that he was able to turn his life around.\n\n\"I had to write all the time, including a farewell letter to cocaine - which [songwriting partner] Bernie [Taupin] read when he visited and broke down in tears - and a list of consequences of my drug and alcohol abuse,\" he continues.\n\n\"It was hard at first but once I got started I couldn't stop... The list of consequences went on and on for three pages. Self-hatred. Severe depression. Going onstage under the influence of drugs.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images for EJAF)\n\nDespite being clean for nearly three decades now, Elton still dreams about coke every week.\n\n\"It's always the same dream: I'm snorting coke when I hear someone coming into the room, usually my mother. Then I try to hide what I'm doing, but I spill it and it goes everywhere - all over the floor, all over me. but it never makes me hanker after cocaine,\" he adds in the book.\n\nSince giving up the drugs, Elton has become something of an agony uncle for other stars struggling with their own addictions.\n\nHe is now Eminem's AA sponsor and rings him once a week to check in with him - \"he always greets me the same way, 'Hello you c***', which I guess is very Eminem\" - and got Rufus Wainwright into rehab when the singer was \"taking so much crystal meth that at one stage he'd gone temporarily blind\".\n\n*Elton John: Me is out now", "description": "Elton John finally went to rehab after nearly killing himself with drugs, booze and bulimia", "authors": ["Emmeline Saunders", "Image", "Redferns", "Hulton Archive Getty Images", "Getty Images For Ejaf"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article6348440.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Elton-John-live-on-stage-1970s.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
