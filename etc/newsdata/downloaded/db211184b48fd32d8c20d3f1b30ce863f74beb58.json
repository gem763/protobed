Brexit Will Happen and Boris Will Win Big.", "language": "en", "text": "So Britain won\u2019t, after all, be getting Brexit by Hallowe\u2019en, do or die.\n\nThis ought, in theory, to be a fatal blow to Prime Minister Boris Johnson: did he not stake his credibility on delivering Brexit by October 31?\n\nBut politics, as we should all have realised by now, isn\u2019t about reality. It\u2019s about perception. The perception of the voting public \u2014 so the opinion polls tell us \u2014 is that Boris is not to blame for the recent run of Brexit delays. On the contrary, the more meddling and procrastination and cheating there has been by the Remainer Establishment, the more Boris\u2019s stock has soared.\n\nHere is how James Forsyth and Katy Balls put it in the Spectator:\n\nYet far from being politically dead, Boris Johnson finds himself in a stronger position than he was on the day he became Prime Minister. The Brexit deal he has struck with the EU has changed everything. It not only garnered the support of a majority of MPs at its second reading, but more importantly it is a deal that Leavers broadly welcome. Every Tory Brexiteer in the Commons voted for it, every cabinet minister is fully signed up to it; and initial polling suggests that the general public back it too \u2014 more say that they support the deal than oppose it. Suddenly the Tories are occupying the common ground of British politics.\n\nNot everyone, I appreciate, is happy about this.\n\nSince coming out in favour of Boris\u2019s Withdrawal Agreement, I\u2019ve been deluged with angry comments from hardcore Brexiteers telling me how rubbish I\u2019d be in the foxhole next to them and how \u2013 in line with Nigel Farage\u2019s claims \u2013 it\u2019s just a warmed-over version of Theresa May\u2019s Surrender Agreement which is nothing like the Brexit 17.4 million people voted for.\n\nComrades, I feel your pain. I too would still much, much rather Britain left the EU with a No Deal Brexit. I would prefer that our country did not pay a penny \u2014 let alone \u00a339 billion plus \u2014 to the corrupt, sclerotic, anti-democratic, lying, bullying and dangerously left-wing monstrosity that is the European Union.\n\nI don\u2019t think the bastards should be allowed anywhere near our territorial fishing waters. I think it\u2019s a bloody outrage that the tinpot European Court of Justice will continue to take precedence over parts of our own legal system. (Though it ought to be said that our own judiciary is so bent and Europhile I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s much to choose between them: our homegrown bewigged enemies or our foreign ones). I think it\u2019s a right pain that we have to go through this charade of pretending that the Irish border has to have special customs arrangements for a period, until such time as we can find a \u2018solution\u2019 to this non-existent problem which was invented purely so that the EU could throw a spanner in the works and hold part of Britain hostage within the EU.\n\nBut the people making the argument that Boris\u2019s Withdrawal Agreement isn\u2019t Brexit remind me of the comedy Irishman who, when you ask him road directions, says:\n\n\u201cWell, sir, if I were you I wouldn\u2019t start from here.\u201d\n\nNo indeed. No one would, in their right minds. A number of villains \u2014 and may their names live in infamy for all eternity \u2014 have contrived to give Boris Johnson and his negotiators a starting position so poor it\u2019s like trying to win a game of poker when all the other players are allowed to see your cards.\n\nObviously it would have been much, much better for all of us if John Bercow had remained a nasty, pointless, Monday-Club-style loon on the right-wing fringes of the Conservative party rather than reinvent himself as the politically correct, virtue-signaller whose holy mission is to stop Brexit happening.\n\nObviously it would have been better if, on the night \u2018Sir\u2019 Oliver Letwin was conceived \u2014 his mum Shirley had instead developed a raging headache and found herself totally not in the mood.\n\nObviously it would have been better if Ugly Rumours had been a success and they\u2019d gone on tour of California and their singer/guitarist had gone for a swim and met with a tragic, great white shark-related accident.\n\nObviously it would have been better if John Smith hadn\u2019t had his heart attack, if he\u2019d led maybe one term as Labour prime minister and then so put Britain off socialism that it voted Tory ever after \u2013 not for watered-down Cameron-style fake Tories but ones so robust and red-meat they\u2019d make Margaret Thatcher look like Hillary Clinton.\n\nEtc.\n\nI hate politics. I\u2019m an ideologue, a purist, which is one of the reasons I\u2019m not in politics: because I\u2019d hate having to bite my tongue all the time and go along with whatever the sell-out plan was.\n\nBut what I have half-learned to accept during the time I\u2019ve spent hanging with these people and writing about their caperings is that you can\u2019t always get what you want; you do, to a degree, have to go with the flow and accept that not every battle can be won no matter how much you might stamp your little feet and rage like Rumpelstiltskin after his name has been revealed.\n\nIf I ruled as your God-Emperor, I have absolutely no doubt that it would be bloody great. I\u2019d do a way better job than either of my university mates David Cameron and Boris Johnson have \u2014 (and, incidentally, contra certain sell-out, pretty but politically spineless young gossip columnists\u2019 recent libellous assertions on Twitter, they were my mates) \u2013 or are capable of doing because I\u2019m much, much sounder than either of them. There\u2019d be none of that Net Zero by 2050, nonsense, for a start.\n\nIt\u2019s a sad fact, though, that unfortunately I shall never rule the United Kingdom as your God-Emperor.\n\nSo instead we are just going to have to remind ourselves of that old saw: \u201cDon\u2019t make the best the enemy of the good.\u201d\n\nBoris\u2019s deal isn\u2019t perfect but \u2013 like the Spartans of the European Research Group, like Allister Heath, like Martin Howe \u2013 I\u2019ve come to accept that right now it\u2019s probably the least worst option available.\n\nAs Shanker Singham puts it at Brexit Central:\n\nThis is not a perfect deal by any means. For the UK negotiators who delivered it, it is tragic that they had to start from the previous Withdrawal Agreement, and that they had so little time to work with. In the circumstances, they have worked a miracle. It bodes well for the future. We should take this chance before it, and Brexit, slip through our fingers.\n\nLike Singham, I\u2019m optimistic. In my dreams, I even still nurture the hope that the EU or someone will overplay their hand and that we end up \u2018crashing out\u2019 (lol) with a No Deal.\n\nBut if we leave on Boris\u2019s terms, I still think we can count it as a win. I also think that when there\u2019s a general election, as I believe there will be imminently \u2014 though God knows how they\u2019re going to get round the Fixed Terms Parliament Act (devised incidentally by some of the world\u2019s worst people including George Osborne, Nick Clegg and Sir Oliver Wetwin) \u2014 and that Boris Johnson\u2019s Tories will win big.\n\nOf course they won\u2019t be as sound as the dream Tories in our imaginations and they\u2019ll do one or two really crap, annoying things because that\u2019s politics. On the other hand, I predict we\u2019re soon going to enter an era, lasting at least a decade, when a post-Brexit Britain is in the hands of the most soundly Conservative administration since Thatcher\u2019s Eighties heyday. If I\u2019m right \u2014 and I am right \u2014 then for goodness sake stop panicking and whingeing, fire up a fat one and enjoy the smell of victory.", "description": "So Britain won't, after all, be getting Brexit by Hallowe'en, do or die.", "authors": ["James Delingpole"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1177954360-e1572021433294-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
