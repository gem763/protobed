She crashed near a highway on-ramp and was arrested. A man traveling with her escaped, Silva said.\n\n\"The arresting officers saw she was on parole and was driving on a revoked driver's license,\" Silva said.\n\nLast year, Sanchez was sentenced to six years and four months in prison for driving under the influence and gross vehicular manslaughter after her 14-year-old sister died in the 2017 crash.\n\nProsecutors said Sanchez was livestreaming on Instagram while driving when she crashed. The video showed her taking her hands off the steering wheel.\n\nShe was released from prison last month after serving two years and two months.\n\nState corrections department spokeswoman Terri Hardy said Sanchez received credit for the time she spent in jail before she was sentenced. Her sentence was also reduced under California law for good behavior with credits for various rehabilitation programs.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
