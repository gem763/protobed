One small step we can all take today to become more energy efficient, individually and as a nation, is by getting a smart meter installed - they're the foundation of a smart energy system.\"\n\nThe study, conducted via OnePoll, also found 62 per cent reckon it's UK consumers' responsibility to tackle climate change.\n\nTo highlight how the topic of energy efficiency is missing in the climate change debate - Smart Energy GB took over a news stand and filled it with their own Missing Piece newspaper.\n\nSacha Deshmukh, CEO of Smart Energy GB, said: \"We are facing a climate crisis. The UK wants to lead the world with our commitment to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050.\n\n\"But, we have a lot to do if we really want to meet that goal.\n\n\"Unless we transform our climate change conversation and talk about real changes in the way we use energy, our commitment to reach zero carbon won't be worth the paper it is written on.\"", "description": "Experts believe the UK could achieve 11 per cent of its 2050 carbon targets, according to research from Smart Energy GB", "authors": ["Astrid Hall", "Joseph Wilkes", "Image", "Swns", "Paul Davey"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20531067.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_SWNS_MISSING_PIECE_011.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
