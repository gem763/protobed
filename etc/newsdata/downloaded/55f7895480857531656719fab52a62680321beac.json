REUTERS/Leah Millis/File Photo\n\nMcConnell, in an interview with radio host Hugh Hewitt, reiterated previous statements that any gun legislation should have the support of Republican President Donald Trump before McConnell would bring it to the Senate floor, so that lawmakers deciding how to vote would know the proposal could be signed into law.\n\n\u201cThe administration is in the process of studying what they are prepared to support, if anything. And I expect to get an answer to that next week,\u201d McConnell, a Republican, said in the interview. Congress returns to work next week after its August recess.\n\n\u201cI said several weeks ago that if the president took a position on a bill so that we knew we would actually be making a law and not just having serial votes, I\u2019d be happy to put it on the floor,\u201d McConnell said.\n\nThe White House has been working on measures to address gun violence after several recent mass shootings. Trump has voiced support for tackling mental health issues related to the violence while also looking at expanded background checks, an issue on which he has wavered.\n\n\u201cIf the president is in favor of a number of things that he has discussed openly and publicly, and I know that if we pass it it\u2019ll become law, I\u2019ll put it on the floor,\u201d McConnell said.\n\nA White House official, Marc Short, said on Monday that authorities had drafted legislation that would speed the death penalty for people who have committed mass murder, and it would be part of a package of gun legislation that the White House intends to propose to Congress.\n\nThe latest U.S. shooting rampage happened last weekend in West Texas, when a gunman with an AR-type rifle killed seven people and wounded 22 others before he was killed by police.\n\nTrump called the shooter \u201ca very sick person,\u201d but said background checks on gun buyers would not have prevented recent gun violence. He told reporters on Sunday he would be working with Democrats and Republicans on gun legislation when Congress returns to work this month. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to see some interesting things coming along,\u201d Trump said.\n\nLeading Democrats have pushed Republicans in the Senate to take up legislation already passed by the House of Representatives that would expand background checks on gun purchasers.", "description": "U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday he expected to hear next week from the White House whether the Trump administration wants to move ahead with legislation to address gun violence.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190903&t=2&i=1425809229&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF821FA"}
