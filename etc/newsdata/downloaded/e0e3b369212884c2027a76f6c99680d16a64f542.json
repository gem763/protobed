The confrontation sparked as pressure grows over the state's controversial abortion bill which returns to Parliament this week. @sarinanastasi #nswpol #7NEWS pic.twitter.com/eTuBvMXvCl\n\nThe NSW minister for finance and small business, Damien Tudehope, also repeated the false assertion, originally made on Twitter by a group called Life Choice Australia, at an incendiary anti-abortion rally on Sunday. On the group\u2019s Facebook page the video has been commented on more than 770 times. Most of the comments attack the pro-choice lobby.\n\nSin\u00e9ad Canning, the campaign manager of the Pro-Choice Alliance, which organised the Saturday rally, confirmed the chant was \u201cbigots\u201d not \u201cfoetus\u201d. Canning said \u201cput the bigots in the bin\u201d was a well known chant used in the marriage equality debate.\n\nQuick guide Abortion in Australia Show Hide Abortion law in Australia varies from state to state. New South Wales\n\nNew South Wales is the last state to decriminalise terminations, though it remains in the criminal code in South Australia and Western Australia in some form. Abortion has been a criminal offence in New South Wales since 1900, and unlawfully procuring an abortion is punishable by up to 10 years' imprisonment. Doctors are able to conduct abortions if they believe the pregnancy is a risk to a woman\u2019s physical or mental health, and a common law precedent set in 1971 means social and economic factors may also be taken into consideration. Laws before the NSW parliament would make abortion legal on request up to 22 weeks, and with the approval of two doctors beyond that. Queensland\n\nThe NSW legislation is based off the bill that passed in Queensland last year. Abortion is legal until 22 weeks gestation, and thereafter with the approval of two doctors. Victoria\n\nLegal to 24 weeks and then after 24 weeks with two doctors\u2019 approval. ACT\n\nLegal. Until last year, only a registered medical practitioner could carry out the procedure in an approved facility. However a change to ACT law last year now allows general practitioners to prescribe abortion drugs such as MS\u20112 Step. South Australia\n\nLegal up to 28 weeks but only if two doctors agree that a woman\u2019s physical and/or mental health is endangered by pregnancy, or for serious foetal abnormality. Unlawful abortion remains a crime. Terminations must be performed in a \"prescribed hospital\". Western Australia\n\nLegal up to 20 weeks but women must be given the opportunity to participate in counselling before a termination can be performed. Teenage girls under 16 require a parent to be informed. After 20 weeks, terminations become much more difficult to access. A woman must receive approval from two doctors from a statutory panel of six who agree the woman, or her foetus, has a \"severe medical condition\" that justifies the procedure.\n\nTasmania\n\nLawful on request up to 16 weeks, and beyond that point with the agreement of two doctors.\n\nNorthern Territory\n\nLegal to 14 weeks with one doctor's approval, and after that to 23 weeks with an additional doctor. Beyond 23 weeks, abortions cannot be performed unless it is performed to save a pregnant person's life.\n\n\u201cI am not shocked the claim came from Life Choice Australia, who are hosting the video on Facebook and Twitter, but I am really disappointed in media who are uncritically spreading it around, broadcasting it, either on TV or radio or in articles online,\u201d Canning told Guardian Australia.\n\n\u201cI have had young women on the phone to me crying their eyes out because they can\u2019t believe their words are being completely misconstrued and lied about in the media.\n\n\u201cI am pretty incensed that they are taking the word of anti-abortion groups and reporting on them without speaking to us. We have made complaints and they haven\u2019t come back to us.\u201d\n\nLifeChoice Australia (@LifeChoiceAu) BREAKING \u2013 Pro-abortion activists yell \u201cput the foetus in the bin\u201d on the streets of Sydney. #nswpol #standforlife #abortionbill #prolife pic.twitter.com/Vr47BvmI8d\n\nA Seven News bulletin displaying the words was still online on Monday, despite repeated attempts by social media users to correct the claim.\n\nCanning said SBS had removed the Life Choice video with the false claim which it had embedded on its news story.\n\nThe fake news spread on far right websites such as Michael Smith News, where commenters labelled the chant disgusting.\n\nOne commenter said: \u201cAnd these are probably the same people who say we need to be more compassionate to refugees (i.e. country shoppers), etc. They certainly aren\u2019t showing any compassion towards the innocent and defenceless babies that are growing and developing in the mother\u2019s womb.\u201d\n\nSeven News declined to comment.\n\nLife Choice Australia did not respond to a request for comment, but maintained in a statement to 10Daily that \u201cfoetus\u201d was the word used. It said that even if the pro-choice advocates had used the word \u201cbigot\u201d, it was a threat that was \u201chighly offensive\u201d and \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d.\n\nJosh Butler (@JoshButler) just got a statement from Life Choice, the group who shared the initial video: they're sticking by the \"fetus\" claim, but say even if it WAS \"bigots\", that would be a \"threat\" of violence https://t.co/K8tRJtUh7t pic.twitter.com/h9WNmPKHMG\n\nAt Sunday\u2019s rally, also addressed by the former prime minister Tony Abbott, Joyce described the historic bill removing abortion from the New South Wales criminal code as \u201cthe slavery debate of our time\u201d.\n\nThe rally was attended by several thousand people protesting against the Reproductive Healthcare Reform bill in Sydney\u2019s Hyde park.\n\nReligious leaders, rightwing MPs and conservative media commentators have mounted a concerted campaign to derail the legislation ahead of the vote. Opponents claim the bill will allow so-called gender or sex selection and abortion \u201con demand\u201d up until birth.", "description": "Barnaby Joyce falsely claims rally chanted \u2018put the foetus in the bin\u2019 despite organiser confirming chant was \u2018bigots\u2019", "authors": ["Amanda Meade"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad2d2412072e5a68e9ee8010f9e8a354da56e52d/91_0_1672_1003/master/1672.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c13f146f03bea0cdf99f50b46241151a", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
