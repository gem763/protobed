We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama. The system will remain too far east.\"\n\nThe NOAA statement takes the National Weather Service to task, declaring \"The Birmingham National Weather Service's Sunday morning tweet spoke in absolute terms that were inconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time.\"\n\nThe surprise statement on Friday has left meteorologists around the country baffled and upset.\n\nBecause the gaslighting is getting real strong now, and it's all too easy to start questioning reality, here is every forecast cone ever drawn by the NHC for #Hurricane #Dorian.\n\n\n\nPlus an arbitrarily-chosen state labeled. pic.twitter.com/fDsCbKeyfu \u2014 Sam Lillo (@splillo) September 6, 2019\n\n\"Some administrator, or someone at the top of NOAA, threw the National Weather Service under the bus,\" Brian McNoldy, a hurricane researcher at the University of Miami, told NPR.\n\n\"The part that really smells fishy is that this is five days after that tweet by Trump,\" he added. \"If the National Weather Service did issue a misleading or incorrect tweet, that would need to be amended or fixed in an hour or two.\"\n\n\"I am very disappointed to see this statement come out from NOAA,\" Oklahoma University meteorology professor Jason Furtado told The Associated Press. He said the controversy over the president's tweets and the NOAA statement undermines public confidence in meteorologists.\n\nSince his original tweet, Trump has re-visited the controversy almost every day this week, including displaying a doctored version of a map showing Hurricane Dorian's projected path to include Alabama.\n\nIn the early days of the hurricane, when it was predicted that Dorian would go through Miami or West Palm Beach, even before it reached the Bahamas, certain models strongly suggested that Alabama & Georgia would be hit as it made its way through Florida & to the Gulf.... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 5, 2019\n\nIn fact, as NPR's Brian Naylor reported, one National Hurricane Center map showed that Alabama could see tropical-force, not hurricane-class winds. Such winds range between 39-73 mph. That map also shows that there was only a 5 percent chance of such winds, below hurricane level, reaching Alabama.\n\nUnderlining the reaction by meteorologists to the escalating debate over the president's claims is the fear that weather forecasting itself is becoming politicized.\n\n\"Hurricanes have never been a left or a right object,\" said McNoldy. \"And I hope they don't become one.\"", "description": "In the escalating debate over weather projections, meteorologists fear their credibility is at stake.", "authors": ["Richard Gonzales"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/09/06/ap_19247710623631-1-_wide-d625632a7aaf843365c411c474369c187a5d72c9.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
