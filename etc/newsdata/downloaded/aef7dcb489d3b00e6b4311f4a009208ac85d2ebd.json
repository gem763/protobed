I mean, frankly, nobody will ever be able to challenge this,\" Trump said at a ceremony in the Oval Office. \"And it will endure forever in the history of racing and in the history of sports, I think.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrump noted that Penske's business empire employs 64,000 people and has made numerous contributions to the business community and charitable organizations in the city of Detroit.\n\n\"Roger, from racing to business to philanthropy, you have moved from one great victory to another,\" Trump said.\n\nPenske was joined by his wife and children for the ceremony. He thanked Trump, his family and his business associates, and highlighted the ongoing economic resurgence in Detroit.\n\nPenske is a former race car driver who gained prominence as the owner of Team Penske in Indy Car racing and NASCAR. His drivers have combined to win 18 Indianapolis 500 races and two Daytona 500 races.\n\n\"He knows what he's doing,\" Trump said after rattling off Penske's racing accomplishments.\n\nThursday's ceremony marked the latest in a string of White House appearances for Penske in recent months.
