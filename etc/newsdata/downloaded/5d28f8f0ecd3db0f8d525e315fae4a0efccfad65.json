It\u2019s no surprise that the government is working on the fly, and the improvisation has some costs.\u201d\n\nThe central bank has been selling dollars at a faster pace in an effort to contain a sharp depreciation of the Argentine peso. Carugati said reserves have fallen by $12.2 billion since Aug. 9, or about 20% of foreign-currency reserves.
