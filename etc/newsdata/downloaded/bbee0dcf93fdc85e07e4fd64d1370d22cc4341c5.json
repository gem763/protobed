The affidavit was released Tuesday.\n\nAs The Washington Post noted, the boy\u2019s recollection appeared to corroborate earlier accounts of the shooting by Jefferson\u2019s family members and others who said the victim had been attempting to protect herself and her nephew from what she thought may be a prowler outside when she was killed.\n\nFort Worth interim police chief Ed Kraus stressed at a news conference on Tuesday that it \u201cmakes sense\u201d that Jefferson \u201cwould have a gun if she felt she was being threatened or if there was someone in the backyard.\u201d\n\nLee Merritt, an attorney representing Jefferson\u2019s family, echoed this sentiment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only appropriate that Ms. Jefferson would have a gun,\u201d Merritt said, according to the Dallas Morning News. \u201cWhen you think there\u2019s someone prowling around in the back at 2 in the morning, you may need to arm yourself.\u201d\n\nMerritt added that Jefferson had a license to carry the weapon.\n\nThe former Fort Worth police officer who fatally shot a woman in her home over the weekend has so far not given an interview or written statement to police sharing his version of events. He has since posted his $200,000 bond https://t.co/dEXZnEvuGX \u2014 WJZ | CBS Baltimore (@wjz) October 15, 2019\n\nIn the affidavit for Dean, Jefferson\u2019s nephew detailed how he and his aunt had been playing video games in her house at around 2:30 a.m. on Saturday when she \u201cheard noises coming from outside,\u201d the Morning News reported.\n\nJefferson, who is Black, \u201ctook her handgun from her purse\u201d and pointed it \u201ctoward the window\u201d before she was shot, the nephew said. The boy added that he then saw his aunt fall to the ground. She died at the scene.\n\nDean, a white police officer, had fired a single shot through the window after he and several other officers arrived at Jefferson\u2019s home in response to a non-emergency call from a neighbor who\u2019d expressed concern after seeing Jefferson\u2019s front door open.\n\nPolice body camera footage released Saturday appeared to show Dean entering the backyard of Jefferson\u2019s house, turning left and then pulling out his gun and pointing it at the window. He then shouts, \u201cPut your hands up! Show me your hands!\u201d before immediately firing his weapon.\n\nThere is no indication in the body cam footage or in the affidavit that Dean saw Jefferson holding the gun before he pulled the trigger, the Post and Morning News reported.\n\nDean was arrested and charged with Jefferson\u2019s murder on Monday, hours after he resigned from the force.\n\nKraus said Tuesday that there was \u201cabsolutely no excuse for this incident and the person responsible will be held accountable.\u201d\n\nThe interim chief also acknowledged that his department\u2019s earlier decision to release a still image of a gun found at Jefferson\u2019s home \u2014 but without any context or explanation of its link to the case \u2014 had not been the right one.\n\nThe department had faced criticism for the image. Merritt, the attorney for Jefferson\u2019s family, accused police of attempting to alter the narrative of the case and blame the victim.\n\nKraus said at a Monday press conference that the department had released the image to show there had been a weapon \u201cinvolved.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, we\u2019re homeowners in the state of Texas. I can\u2019t imagine most of us, if we thought we had somebody outside our house who shouldn\u2019t be, and we had access to a firearm \u2014 that we wouldn\u2019t act very similarly to how she acted,\u201d Kraus said, CBS News reported.\n\nThe following day, Kraus became emotional as he appealed to the public to not judge all the officers in the department based on Dean\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cThe officers, they try hard every day to try to make this city better,\u201d Kraus said. \u201cI likened it to a bunch of ants building an anthill, and if somebody comes with a hose and washes it away they just have to start from scratch.\u201d\n\nFort Worth police chief on the fatal shooting of Atatiana Jefferson: \u201cI ask you to please do not let the action of one officer reflect on the other 1,700. There's absolutely no excuse for this incident, and the person responsible will be held accountable\u201d https://t.co/cJCzp86bZZ pic.twitter.com/1n5BWfoiu0 \u2014 CNN Newsroom (@CNNnewsroom) October 15, 2019\n\nJefferson\u2019s shooting occurred less than two weeks after former Dallas police officer Amber Guyger was convicted of killing her Black neighbor in his own apartment.\n\nGuyger, who is white, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for the shooting death of Botham Jean.\n\nAlso on HuffPost\n\nLove HuffPost?
