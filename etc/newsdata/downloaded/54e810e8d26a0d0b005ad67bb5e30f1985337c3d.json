The firm still has a 15-person data team run by Anil Chandroth, the head of data science and Petrescu's former boss, and the team's strategy remains unchanged, according to a source close to the firm.\n\nExodus declined to comment.

Here's how the people in charge of spending millions on this data find the stuff worth buying.\n\nHedge funds have turned to alternative data to boost returns, which has spurred an explosion of startups. The industry tracker AlternativeData.org says there are 445 alternative-data vendors \u2014 a huge leap from 10 years ago, when there were just over 100 vendors.\n\nTo filter through the now overwhelming number of data streams for sale, hedge funds employ data buyers like Petrescu to find data that is unique and proven to generate returns. At conferences like BattleFin, where vendors are hawking their products, these data buyers can have dozens of meetings in a day on the search for game-changing data.\n\nAs data has grown in prominence, the data buyers have also grown in stature.
