The actress is just one letter away from getting the full EGOT, having already won Emmy, Grammy and Tony awards for her outstanding performance in The Color Purple.\n\nCynthia was left \u2018raw\u2019 after filming harrowing scenes in Harriet (Picture: Focus Features)\n\nShe\u2019s hopeful that Harriet will continue to open doors for other monumental black figures in history to have their stories told in Hollywood.\n\n\u2018I hope that this just means there are more stories about her that will be told, we have 101 stories about Abraham Lincoln and stories about Margaret Thatcher and all these other stories about people in history,\u2019 she explained.\n\n\u2018There should be loads of stories told about Harriet. I\u2019m hoping that one, people give it the benefit of the doubt and see the film and trust that I can do the job and do the work I\u2019m supposed to do.\n\n\u2018Because I think that\u2019s the thing that confused me the most. I know my job is to tell the story first and foremost, and not necessarily stories that are specifically about me.\n\n\u2018My job is to play the character and tell the truth of them.\u2019\n\nCynthia\u2019s performance in Harriet is truly harrowing and has already earned rave reviews from critics before its official release, and the actress would be happy to see Harriet\u2019s story told again on the silver screen.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nBut more importantly, Cynthia hopes it \u2018validates why [she] was cast\u2019 and \u2018stills some fear\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I hope it calms any doubts that people are having. That people can trust that I was put there for a reason and it wasn\u2019t a frivolous one and that I never would have taken it if I didn\u2019t think I was up to the challenge,\u2019 she said.\n\n\u2018And even if the reviews were terrible and even if people didn\u2019t think I was good, I still think the benefit of the doubt is helpful. So I\u2019m hoping that that will at least give people cause to have the benefit of the doubt.\n\n\u2018And secondly, I hope that people will tell the story over and over again, in different ways and different formats and different places. That\u2019s what the initial feeling was and then I sort of had understanding and then resolution.\u2019\n\nCynthia has earned applause for her performance in Harriet (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nHarriet\u2019s story isn\u2019t for the faint-hearted \u2013 not only did she miraculously managed to escape from her slave master alone, but she went on to rescue hundreds of others who were enslaved.\n\nBut there\u2019s one scene in particular that Cynthia will never forget.\n\n** SPOILER **\n\n\u2018Probably the scene with John Tubman where she finds out that he has married another woman \u2013 painful. It was really painful. You have to really find the place where you know what heartbreak is like,\u2019 Cynthia admits.\n\n\u2018I know what it feels like and you have to go back to that place and then add on the fact that she had run another hundred miles to be there and it just was painful.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe added: \u2018We had worked on that for a few hours that day so by the end of it, I was raw. There was nothing there. That was a tough and challenging yet rewarding scene because it was still one of my favourite scenes \u2013 it was tough but still my favourite. It was about womanhood.\u2019\n\nCynthia is released in UK cinemas on 22 November.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
