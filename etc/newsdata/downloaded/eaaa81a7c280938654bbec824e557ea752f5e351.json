It\u2019s the system of roads and highways in and around the nation\u2019s capital. And it\u2019s not all that different from the system of roads and highways in any other metropolitan area.\n\nWhy are we so much more forgiving of their punishing costs than we are of the transgressions of Metrorail and other rapid transit systems?\n\nAD\n\nI wonder this sometimes as I listen to the rush-hour traffic reports on WTOP. (Given that I am a Metro commuter, why I listen to those reports is another puzzler, but we\u2019ll leave that for another day.)\n\nAD\n\nEvery 10 minutes, it seems, a new accident or broken-down vehicle is causing a new snarl. And if it seems that way, it\u2019s because it is that way: In one recent 12-month period on the Capital Beltway alone, WTOP counted \u201ca total of 3,463 fender benders, side-swipes and pile-ups.\u201d\n\nNot coincidentally, Washington drivers spend an average of 102 hours every year in traffic delays, according to the most recent report from the Texas A&M Transportation Institute.\n\nAD\n\nYet when we descend the Metrorail escalator and find we have to wait eight minutes for a train instead of four, we are mightily annoyed. When single-tracking causes a longer delay, we\u2019re furious. And when one person dies in a Metrorail accident \u2014 which last happened nearly five years ago \u2014 it\u2019s the subject of major investigations and blanket news coverage (including a number of editorials).\n\nAD\n\nOne explanation is that mass transit, like air travel, has the potential to produce mass casualties, and so a laser focus on safety and security is essential. On highways there are sometimes group tragedies involving vans or buses or multiple pileups, but most casualties occur one by one by one.\n\nYet given the huge difference in total casualties \u2014 more than 37,000 killed in road crashes across the country each year, versus very, very few in subway crashes \u2014 the imbalance doesn\u2019t seem entirely rational. Nor does the threat of mass casualties explain why we seem more willing to accept endless traffic jams at New York and Florida avenues than rail work on the Blue Line.\n\nAD\n\nPart of the reason might be that we feel more in control behind the wheel. Of course everyone complains about traffic. But even if the gain is illusory when you switch lanes and pass two cars on your right, you at least feel you\u2019ve taken your fate in your hands. On a train, you are at someone else\u2019s mercy \u2014 and for some people, being underground exacerbates the sense of powerlessness.\n\nAD\n\nPart of the reason might be that Metrorail provides us with someone easy to blame. The state transportation officials who can grill the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority general manager and CEO Paul J. Wiedefeld every two weeks at Metro board meetings rarely have to answer questions themselves for congestion or safety lapses on the roads.\n\nAnd, besides, who exactly is to blame for that congestion and those safety lapses? Is it the state officials? Congress, for failing to approve an infrastructure bill? The driver whose truck broke down in front you? The truck\u2019s owner, who failed to maintain the vehicle?\n\nAD\n\nThe truth is we have come to accept both traffic deaths and congestion as part of the natural order of things. That doesn\u2019t make the United States unique \u2014 more than 1 million people die worldwide in road crashes every year \u2014 but Americans are more than twice as likely to die as people in other wealthy countries.\n\nAD\n\nWe could do something about that \u2014 get tougher on seat belt scofflaws, install breathalyzers in every car to prevent drunks from driving. But many Americans see both of those as an impingement on freedom.\n\nWe could do something else, too \u2014 build more mass transit and maybe appreciate it a little more. As it happens, since that last Metrorail death in 2015, Washington\u2019s system has steadily improved both its safety standards and its performance. More and more routinely, when you descend the escalator, the screen greets you with that simple, blessed message: \u201cMetro is operating on or near schedule.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThat won\u2019t stop any of us from complaining when there\u2019s a delay. But before we get too exercised, it might help to tune in to the latest traffic report.\n\nAD\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The mass casualties and delays on roads and highways cannot be accepted.", "authors": ["Fred Hiatt", "Editorial Page Editor", "Columnist", "Overseeing The Washington Post Opinions Section."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/a5aNjzoJ6YFwcPjRrgSu482FxiI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6PQGZCCBUEI6RMW4WCSAHZDSBI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
