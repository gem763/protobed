With eyes glued to their television screens, everyone holds their breaths as they get ready to watch the first men land on the moon. In mission control in Houston, workers stand alert as footage from the lunar surface comes alive on their screens.\n\nYet something's different. The faces of the American men and women watching aren't filled with hope or excitement. Instead, their faces show anger, disappointment, fear and perhaps most notably, regret.\n\nThe year is 1969. But instead of the U.S. becoming the first nation to land on the moon, it's the Soviet Union. That's the alternate reality depicted in Apple TV Plus's new show, \"For All Mankind,\" set to release November 1.\n\nThough it didn't actually happen, that first-man-on-the-moon glory went to the United States, propelled in large part by work done here on the Space Coast, it's curious to imagine another reality. A reality where the Soviets were the first to land on the celestial body next door to us.\n\nApple TV+ is only $4.99 per month: Here's why it's so cheap\n\nWhat else can i watch?: Here are all the new Apple TV+ shows and movies\n\nApple's new show offers up one possibility: Instead of giving up on the space race, the show depicts a version where the U.S. decides to achieve an even heftier goal. In Apple's telling, NASA seems to immediately set its sights on Mars and other parts of the solar system.\n\n\"When (Ron Moore, the creator and writer for the TV series) told me about the idea that we were going to have this alternate reality where the Russians get to the moon first and they beat us ... and what would have happened differently in the world and when he told me that, my eyes lit up and I said, 'Oh my goodness, that is a great idea for a TV show. I love it,'\" former NASA astronaut and director of space operations at SpaceX who served as a technical advisor for the show, Garrett Reisman told FLORIDA TODAY.\n\nThis alternate depiction resembles what NASA is doing in real life under the new program, Artemis that aims to send the first woman and next man back to the moon by 2024. The current plan is this: Head back to the moon, specifically the south pole, to use its resources \u2014 namely the water ice found there to produce rocket fuel, which will help propel future spacecraft to venture farther into the solar system.\n\nThe show also incorporates a female character aspiring to be an astronaut, so female astronauts walking on the moon isn't completely ruled out either.\n\nUnlike the current agency, however, the NASA in the TV series seems to be fueled with a competitive vengeance to get back at the Soviets and prove to the rest of the world that the U.S. can still be the leaders in space.\n\nHow realistic is it?\n\n'Shoot for the Moon: The Space Race and the Extraordinary Voyage of Apollo 11' by James Donovan (Photo: .)\n\nBut could that have actually happened after having lost so dramatically and during such a turbulent time in history?\n\nSpace policy expert at American University, Howard McCurdy doesn't believe so.\n\n\"All the magazines in 1947 and again in 1952 reported the following message: The nation that's first in space will win the Cold War,\" McCurdy said. \"In essence, what the quotation was, is the nation that wins the space race will control the Earth.\"\n\nAt the 46th Space Congress in Cape Canaveral held this past June, NASA's deputy administrator James Morhard reiterated that same message. He said whoever gets anywhere in space first, becomes the leader in space and in our world. He was talking about the first people to set foot on Mars.\n\nThus, had the Soviets been first to land humans on the moon, they would have been the leaders in outer space \u2014 eliminating the option for the U.S. to venture farther afield, according to McCurdy.\n\n\"If the initial purpose is to demonstrate to uncommitted nations that the United States is first and we're clearly not first, why spend the money to be second when you could reinvest that money in missile defense or in reconnaissance satellites, or in gamma-ray detectors that would confirm whether or not a nation was cheating on the atmospheric tests and atomic weapons and all the other aspects of the Cold War,\" McCurdy said.\n\nFurthermore, he adds there wouldn't have been the support from the public or funding needed from Congress to do so.\n\n\"What it says is beginning in the late 1960s, people would've begun to doubt the technical capabilities of the United States,\" McCurdy said.\n\nFormer NASA historian Roger Launius also doesn't believe the U.S. would have succeeded in trying to send humans on other deep space missions if we'd lost the race to the moon.\n\n\"If you publicly announce that you lost the moon race and that your technology was not up to snuff and your economy was not sufficient to support it and all that other stuff that goes along with an admission of failure, why would you turn around and say, 'Oh no, we're not going to do that. We're now going to do something that's at least an order of magnitude more difficult,\" Launius said.\n\n\"You're setting yourself up for failure a second time.\"\n\nReisman, on the other hand, disagrees.\n\n\"I think it's certainly possible,\" he said. \"I think in some ways, the fact that we were kind of stuck in low Earth orbit for all that time (after the Apollo program ended) and hadn't really advanced any further in space was a bit of a letdown for a lot of people and I think this show kind of addresses that.\"\n\nOther possibilities to losing space race\n\nCLOSE Jack Kirschenbaum grew up on the Space Coast during the initial 'space race' and has vivid memories of the excitement of the time. Craig Chapman, Trench Media\n\nHad the Soviets been first to land humans on the moon, both McCurdy and Launius instead believe the U.S. would have proposed a joint venture between the U.S. and the Soviet Union.\n\n\"It probably would have been more likely that there would have been a deal cut by the Americans and the Russians to go to the moon,\" Launius said.\n\nBut McCurdy does not believe that would have worked.\n\n\"I think that's what the United States response would have been and the Soviet response would have been what it was in 1961, 'You've got to be kidding me. You're making this proposal because you're behind, not because you're ahead,\"' he said.\n\n\"They wouldn't have done it. They would have gone ahead and landed on the moon and try to reap the international benefits of that accomplishment through the 1970s and through the 1980s.\"\n\nAnother possibility could have been to send robotic spacecraft on deep-space missions, like many of the current NASA science missions, instead of sending humans to explore the universe.\n\n\"There probably would have been political support for a more modest robotic scientifically-emphasized space program, but it wouldn't have worked because it doesn't capture the imagination of world leaders who are neutral in the Cold War,\" McCurdy said.\n\nAfter all, the space race and the Cold War were linked.\n\nPurpose of the space race\n\nCLOSE Bob Sieck, former launch director at NASA talks about the technologies that had to be created during the space race to the moon. #5050LunarLegends Craig Chapman, Trench Media\n\nAfter World War II, a new tension began between the world's two greatest superpowers \u2014 the democratic U.S. and the communist Soviet Union. The Cold War pushed both nations to compete for first place in technological superiority \u2014 best showcased through the \"space race.\"\n\n\"This was war by another means,\" Launius said.\n\nThe U.S.'s greatest weapon to combat this war? The Apollo program.\n\n\"The Apollo mission was designed as a Cold War version of a hot war,\" McCurdy said. \"Instead of going to war, we went out on the jousting fields like medieval knights and demonstrated our technological prowess.\"\n\nThe whole purpose of the space race was essentially to win the Cold War without the need to actually go to war. It was a figurative death struggle between these two superpowers trying to bring in undecided countries to rally behind them.\n\n\"If you want your economic and political system to be the master, you want to persuade these other countries to go along with you,\" Launius said. \"That's what it's about. Because science and technology are going to determine the future and this is a demonstration of science and technology of the most profound type.\"\n\nMcCurdy reiterates the same message.\n\n\"The purpose of the space race was not science. It wasn't even to land on the moon,\" he said. \"It was to demonstrate the technologies that were being developed and hopefully never used in the Cold War.\"\n\nMcCurdy speculates that if the Soviets had been first to land on the moon, they probably would have also won the Cold War as a result.\n\n\"One of the reasons we won the Cold War is because we won the space race,\" he said.\n\n\"Science and technology determine the future ... and who controls that science and technology, is going to be the dominant force in shaping that,\" Launius said.\n\nSo what would the world be like if the Soviets had won the space race and consequently, the Cold War?\n\nHow world would be different\n\nWhen Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin stepped foot on the moon, they left behind a plaque that read, \"Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the moon July 1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind.\"\n\nWould the cosmonauts have done the same? After all, the U.S. was a free and democratic country, while the Soviet Union was not.\n\nEven the Apollo 11 mission patch displayed how this was an accomplishment to be shared by all humankind, not just America. Though it had the bald eagle, the United States' national bird, included in the patch, both the Apollo 11 and 13 mission patch are the only Apollo patches to not show any space hardware, have the names of the crew or display the American flag \u2014 proof that this was a feat to be shared globally.\n\nBut how would the world be if the Soviets had landed on the moon instead?\n\n\"If (the U.S.) loses the Cold War, then I can piece together a series of events that allows the Soviet Union to be much more intact and much more powerful than it turned out to be when they lost the race to the moon,\" McCurdy said. \"That's what it leads to. The Soviet Union still being the Soviet Union.\"\n\nThe fall of the Berlin Wall probably wouldn't have occurred, the Soviet Union would still have a pretty firm grasp on most of Eastern Europe and many undecided countries at the time could have gone over and allied with the Soviets instead of the Americans, McCurdy and Launius speculated.\n\n\"Anything's possible,\" Launius said. \"The reality was, there were so many deficiencies in the Soviet system; the command economy didn't work as well as it should have; the totalitarian nature of things created all kinds of difficulties and those could have played out regardless of who was the first nation on the moon.\"\n\n\"The economy of the Soviet Union was much inferior to the United States and ultimately, that's what did them in in the 1980s,\" he said.\n\nA new space race?\n\nCLOSE As the commercial space race takes off, China is trying to edge out other countries for the lead with its giant x-ray telescope. Buzz60\n\nThe reason the U.S. was able to send humans to the moon in the first place was because of the fear fueled by the space race and consequently, the Cold War. The fear that the Soviets would get there first.\n\nToday, such a fear doesn't exist.\n\n\"This was a life and death warfare type struggle and we've not had that situation since, so nobody's been willing to spend the kind of dollars on it that it requires,\" Launius said.\n\nWith the plan to head back to the moon in five years and then eventually on to Mars, not having the necessary funding won't help NASA get anywhere anytime soon.\n\n\"NASA now is kind of in a bind,\" Reisman said. \"They want to do this very ambitious program and they want to do it the traditional way, by relying on government programs like (the Space Launch System rocket that would send astronauts to the moon), which are very expensive. So NASA is in a bit of a quandary because I don't think they're going to get the money to do Artemis and put Americans on the moon by 2024 the way they want to do it.\"\n\nMcCurdy argues there is a second space race heating up with China, this time to be the first to send crewed missions to Mars.\n\nBut Launius disagrees.\n\n\"The situations are so different,\" Launius said. \"I've heard people asking those questions about China all the time. None of us care whether or not China sends a taikonaut to land on the moon or even Mars. We do not fear them like we feared the Soviet Union.\"\n\nDuring the Apollo program, 39% of Americans believed the U.S. should do everything they can to be the first nation on the moon, according to a 1965 Gallop poll. Now, only 8% of Americans, according to a poll commissioned by C-SPAN for the 50th anniversary of the moon landing believe a crewed moon mission should be a top priority for NASA. The figure jumps to 18% for a crewed mission to Mars.\n\nAfter all, this isn't the first time since the Apollo program that NASA has repeated its wish to head back to our nearby satellite and finally meet our red neighbor.\n\n\"We've been down this road at least three times and we've not done any of those things,\" Launius said. \"So yeah, I'm skeptical.\"\n\nContact Jaramillo at 321-242-3668 or antoniaj@floridatoday.com.
