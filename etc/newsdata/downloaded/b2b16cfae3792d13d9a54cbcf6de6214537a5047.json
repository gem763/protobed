He said Giuliani described to him during their phone call several concerns about Ukraine\u2019s alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. election, concerns that haven\u2019t been substantiated.\n\nPerry also said he never heard the president, any of his appointees, Giuliani or the Ukrainian regime discuss the possibility of specifically investigating former Vice President Joe Biden, a Democratic presidential contender, and his son, Hunter Biden. Trump\u2019s request for a probe of the Bidens in a July 25 call with Ukraine\u2019s president has sparked the impeachment inquiry in the House.\n\nPerry\u2019s phone call to Giuliani came after a May meeting at the White House following the inauguration of the Ukrainian president.
