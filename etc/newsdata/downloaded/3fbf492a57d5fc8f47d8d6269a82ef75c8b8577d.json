You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe commission said it was in discussions with the government about the potential issues and was reviewing its contingency plans.\n\nSpeculation of an election before the end of the year soared this week after MPs rejected Mr Johnson\u2019s plan to rush his Brexit deal through parliament and take Britain out of the EU on 31 October.\n\nThe prime minister is expected to try to push for a winter election if the EU agrees to a further Brexit delay. Labour has said it will support the proposal once the risk of a no-deal exit has been avoided.\n\nA five-week campaign is usually required before an election, so even if one was triggered next week, the poll would be most likely to take place in early December.\n\nThe electoral roll is updated annually on 1 December, meaning the new register would be in place in time to be used for a possible election.\n\nHowever, polling cards for an early December election would need to be sent out in November, meaning one electoral register would be used for sending the cards and another used for the actual election.\n\nIt means that people could see their polling cards, which include details of where they should go to vote, sent to their old address.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
