BEN is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2019 results, before the opening bell on Oct 25. The company\u2019s results are projected to reflect year-over-year fall in earnings and revenues.\n\n\n\nIn the last reported quarter, Franklin\u2019s results surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company\u2019s results reflected a strong capital position. However, escalating expenses, lower revenues and reduced assets under management (AUM) were recorded. Further, net outflows were an undermining factor.\n\n\n\nIn addition, Franklin recorded positive earnings surprise in three out of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 1.7%.\n\n\n\nFranklin Resources, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nFranklin Resources, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise More\n\nFranklin Resources, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Franklin Resources, Inc. Quote\n\nNevertheless, the company\u2019s activities in the fiscal fourth quarter were inadequate to win analysts\u2019 confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 65 cents remained unchanged over the last seven days. Also, the figure reflects year-over-year fall of 17.7%.\n\n\n\nEarnings Whispers\n\n\n\nFranklin does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients \u2014 positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better \u2014 to increase the odds of an earnings beat.\n\n\n\nYou can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\n\n\nEarnings ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.\n\n\n\nZacks Rank: Franklin\u2019s Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) decreases the predictive power of ESP.\n\n\n\nFactors at Play\n\n\n\nStrong Markets: Performance of equity markets remained impressive during the July-September quarter. The S&P 500 Index increased nearly 2.2% year over year and 1.2% sequentially in the quarter. Moreover, the index measuring international equity performance \u2014 the MSCI EAFE \u2014 inched down 1.5% year over year but was up 1.1% sequentially. This is anticipated to have driven the California-based asset manager\u2019s results to a large extent.\n\n\n\nHigher AUM: Given Franklin\u2019s AUM disclosure for September 2019 and favorable foreign-currency fluctuations, its results are predicted to display higher AUM, on a sequential basis. However, the company is expected to have recorded outflows mainly tied with U.S. and non-U.S. mutual funds.\n\n\n\nPer the Zacks Consensus Estimate, total AUM for the to-be-reported quarter is projected to be down 3% to $693 million sequentially.\n\n\n\nRevenue Growth: Investment management fees, which mark a significant portion of the company\u2019s revenues, might have recorded growth in the fiscal fourth quarter. The consensus estimate for investment management fees of $1.03 billion indicates slight sequential increase. Furthermore, sales and distribution fees are projected to have improved 1.4% sequentially to $373 million in the quarter. Also, shareholder servicing fees are estimated to be have increased marginally on a sequential basis to $54 million.\n\n\n\nOverall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $1.45 billion indicates a year-over-year fall of 4.8%.\n\n\n\nControlled Expenses: Management remains focused on effective cost control. However, management projects additional expenses of around $15 million associated with increase in termination benefits, and implementation of additional cost structure and business optimization initiatives for the quarter to be reported. The company also anticipates additional acquisition-related retention expenses of about $20 million.\n\n\n\nStocks That Warrant a Look\n\n\n\nHere are some stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.\n\n\n\nFidelity National Information Services, Inc.
