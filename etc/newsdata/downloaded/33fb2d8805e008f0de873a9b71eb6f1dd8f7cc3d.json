So it\u2019s good for everyone to keep playing the way they have been.\u201d\n\nPart of the criticism levelled at Henderson is that he is not creative enough, and he certainly does not score enough goals with just 26 in 337 games for the club.\n\nHis equaliser against Spurs was perfect timing then.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really care who scores goals as long as we win,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cPeople will analyse and say we want more goals from midfield but ultimately if the forwards score the goals then what does it matter?\n\n\u201cAs long as we win games, the midfielders can contribute in other ways throughout the game.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not always goals. Now and again it\u2019s nice to get on the scoresheet, but for us it\u2019s about performance, it\u2019s about working together as a team, and it doesn\u2019t matter who scores.\u201d\n\nFabinho is Klopp\u2019s one \u2018undroppable\u2019 midfielder and he showed his value and versatility with a game-changing second-half performance.\n\nThe Brazil international, the defensive midfield linchpin, adopted a more adventurous approach after the break and provided the assist for Henderson\u2019s goal.\n\n\u201cFab has been excellent. Another good performance from him, (he\u2019s) so good in that position,\u201d said Henderson.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve played in that position for a while and it is a tough position. He\u2019s perfect for it; he reads the game so well and breaks the play up and starts attacks off.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a fantastic player and he\u2019s in great form and hopefully that can continue.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson admits the midfield options Jurgen Klopp now has at his disposal are great for the manager, although not so much for the players competing for those positions.
