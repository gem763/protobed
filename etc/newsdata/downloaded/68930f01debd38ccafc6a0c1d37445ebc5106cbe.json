(Picture: Butts County Sheriff\u2019s Office)\n\nA judge has banned police from putting warning signs outside sex offenders\u2019 houses in a bid to keep young trick-or-treaters away.\n\nThe federal judge ruled in favor of three sex offenders who sued Butts County Sheriff Gary Long, who put the signs in their yards last year and planned to do it again this year.\n\nSheriff Long\u2019s signs feature stop signs and big bold capital lettering that reads: \u2018WARNING! NO TRICK-OR-TREAT AT THIS ADDRESS\u2019\n\nGeorgia state law prohibits registered sex offenders from putting Halloween decorations on their property \u2013 but they said the signs go too far.\n\nMark Yurachek, the lawyer representing the plaintiffs, Christopher Reed, Reginald Holden and Corey McClendon said: \u2018State Law does require him to notify the public in very specific ways, and none of those ways includes placing signs on registrants\u2019 lawns.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nSheriff Long said: \u2018My office took precautions and placed signs indicating \u2018No Trick-or-Treat\u2019 at each registered sex offender\u2019s residence in the county. This was done to ensure the safety of our children.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe sex offenders argued in the lawsuit that Sheriff Long \u2018exceeded his authority\u2019 when he put the signs up, according to the lawsuit. They also said he trespassed on their property when doing so.\n\nBoy, 16, murdered cheerleader girlfriend and unborn baby after she kept pregnancy secret\n\nThe lawsuit continues to say that the police caused \u2018anxiety, embarrassment and humiliation,\u2019 and damaged their trust in law enforcement.\n\nJudge Marc Treadwell ultimately ruled that the signs infringed on the three plaintiff\u2019s rights to free speech \u2013 but the ruling did not extend to all sex offenders in the county.\n\nHowever, the judge did ward Sheriff Long that he \u2018should be aware that the authority for blanket sign posting is dubious at best and even more dubious if posted under the objection of restraints.\u2019\n\nWoman 'strangled man to death after he raped her'\n\nAfter the ruling, Sheriff Long said he \u2018respectfully and strongly\u2019 disagreed with the judge and vowed to keep a \u2018very strong presence in the neighborhoods where we know sex offenders are likely to be.\u2019\n\nA local mother, who remained unnamed, told Fox 8: \u2018I understand that not all sex offenders are the same, but as an overall consensus I believe that we need (the signs).\u2019\n\nIn every US state, a person may be ordered to register as a sex offender if they are arrested for public urination and are charged with indecent exposure or lewdness, according to Attorney Janet Portman.", "description": "udge Marc Treadwell ultimately ruled that the signs infringed on the three plaintiff's rights to free speech", "authors": ["Jacob Geanous"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/comp-1572440889_1572443128.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
