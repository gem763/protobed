The woman's parents, who were staying with her, contacted police after she did not return, police said.\n\n\"They heard dogs yelping or barking,\" Ontario Provincial Police Constable James Davis told Minneapolis ABC affiliate KSTP. \"The dogs returned to the cottage, the female didn't and the parents grew concerned.\"\n\nKeithbinns/STOCK PHOTO/Getty Images\n\nPolice, which had to take a half-hour boat ride to the remote island, searched the woods on the island and found Mueller's dead body and bear.\n\n\"They observed there was a bear standing on top of the female,\" Davis said. \"The bear was dispatched; it was shot by officers and the bear killed.\"\n\nJolanta Kowalski, a spokesperson for the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, called the bear attack \"very rare.\"\n\n\"It sounds like something so rare, that doesn't happen, we're kind of in shock,\" Mueller's friend, Vonnette Mills, told KSTP.\n\nFatal bear attacks in North America are rare, though a man was killed by a brown bear in Canada's remote Northwest Territories two weeks ago, according to The Washington Post.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
