USA TODAY\n\nThere\u2019s nothing more fetch than quoting \u201cMean Girls.\u201d\n\nThe 2004 teen comedy starring Lindsay Lohan became culturally iconic almost instantly, creating quotable moments, catapulting the careers of Rachel McAdams and Amanda Seyfried to superstar levels and sparking a sequel and a Broadway musical adaptation.\n\nIn honor of the film\u2019s annual \"Mean Girls\" Day on Oct. 3 (see: No. 12), we\u2019re settling in with some Kalteen bars and mocktails (thanks, Mrs. George) to celebrate the genius behind Tina Fey\u2019s whip-smart script, partially based on Rosalind Wiseman's 2002 self-help book, \"Queen Bees and Wannabes.\"\n\nAfter combing through the movie's gold mine of comedic quips, we've rounded up the 15 best quotes from the cult classic below.\n\nThe titular characters in \"Mean Girls\" wore pink on Wednesdays. (Photo: Photo by Michael Gibson, Paramount Pictures)\n\n15. \"On Wednesdays we wear pink.\" \u2013Karen Smith (Amanda Seyfried)\n\nPart of the allure of the titular mean girls in the movie is their seemingly perfect facade, dictated by a set of bylaws and rules that included only wearing jeans and sweatpants on Fridays, absolutely no vests and wearing pink on Wednesdays.\n\n14. \"You can't sit with us!\" \u2013 Gretchen Wieners (Lacey Chabert)\n\nGretchen finally stands up to Regina, screaming this line in the cafeteria as if she has been storing it in a plastic Pandora's box. It's similar to when she says \"We should totally just stab Caesar!\" but now she's untangling herself from Regina's clutches instead of struggling in them. You can sit with us, Gretch.\n\n13. \"Damn Africa, what happened?\" \u2013Kevin Gnapoor (Rajiv Surendra)\n\nThis quote from mathlete Kevin Gnapoor to Lohan's Cady Heron, a Chicago transplant who spent her childhood years in Africa, has come back into circulation in the past few years. As life seems to spiral out of control in a variety of ways across the world, people have resurfaced this quote as a way to simultaneously remember the \"better\" days and roast the current state of affairs.\n\n12. \"It's October 3rd.\" \u2013Cady Heron (Lindsay Lohan)\n\nThis quote sparked an entire day dedicated to the movie each year, and it's not even the strongest quote from the movie. That pretty much proves the film's cult status.\n\n11. \"I'm not like a regular mom, I'm a cool mom!\" \u2013 Mrs. George (Amy Poehler)\n\nEat your heart out, Kris Jenner. Amy Poehler\u2019s role as Regina\u2019s plastics-wannabe mother set the (very high, Juicy pink) bar for \u201ccool moms\u201d everywhere. Trading her room so Regina could have it? Done. Helping Regina get ready for prom after she gets hit by a bus? Done. Your favorite mom could never.\n\n10. \"Get in loser, we're going shopping!\" \u2013 Regina George (Rachel McAdams)\n\nThis line is teen suburbia at its finest. After the movie became a hit, teens everywhere could be heard yelling this in school parking lots.\n\n9. \"That is so fetch!\" \u2212 Gretchen Wieners\n\nWe know, we know, this is low on our list. But that\u2019s exactly the point: The British \u201cslang\u201d Gretchen tries to use doesn\u2019t cut it for Queen Bee Regina, but who can forget it?\n\n8. \"I can't go out tonight. I'm sick.\" \u2013Karen Smith\n\nThis is the ultimate fake-out, and on a three-way call, no less. The fake cough Karen inserts after saying she can't go out has made its way into the lexicon of excuses to not get off the couch.\n\n7. \"It\u2019s like I have ESPN or something!\" \u2212 Karen Smith\n\nKaren Smith\u2019s ESPN/ESP mix-up is one for the ages. This is a character, yes, who doesn\u2019t understand why it\u2019s bad to make out with your cousin and thinks there\u2019s a 30% chance it\u2019s already raining, but the ESPN gaffe is palatable to any and all fans of this film who may not otherwise enjoy some of the more subtle comedy.\n\nLindsay Lohan is Cady, Amanda Seyfried is Karen, Rachel McAdams is Regina and Lacey Chabert is Gretchen in \"Mean Girls.\" (Photo: Michael Gibson, AP)\n\n6. \"Raise your hand if you have ever been personally victimized by Regina George.\" \u2013 Ms. Norbury (Tina Fey)\n\nWhether someone is making fun of you in the family group text or your boss calls you out in a meeting, it's 2019 and we've all felt victimized at this point. Thanks to Fey, we have the perfect way to express it.\n\n5. \"Made out with a hot dog? Oh my god that was one time!\" \u2212 Amber D'Alessio (Julia Chantrey)\n\nYes, Amber D\u2019Alessio admitted to making out with a hot dog after the Burn Book went public. There\u2019s a series of other gut-busting lines that happen during this scene but no other delivery sticks quite like this one. The quote is also easily recyclable in typical trashy banter. \"Was my pun that horrible? Oh my god, that was one time!\" for example.\n\n4. \"Four for your Glen Coco! You go, Glen Coco!\" \u2013Damian (Daniel Franzese)\n\nAlthough this is not Damian's funniest quote from the movie, nor the most memorable scene, this line has withstood the test of time. To this day, people recite the quote in Damian's Santa Claus accent whenever they're distributing four of something to anyone.\n\n3. \"You could try Sears.\" \u2212 Salesperson (Jo Chim)\n\nWho knew four words could cause third-degree burns? A sales associate at the store \u201c1-3-5\u201d deadpans the line to Regina after she can\u2019t squeeze into a size 5 dress. While \u201cget in loser, we\u2019re going shopping\u201d is also iconic, there\u2019s something about the specificity of Sears that makes the quote shine. Regina probably wishes she could\u2019ve put it in the Burn Book herself.\n\n2. \"Oh my God, Danny DeVito, I love your work!\" \u2212 Damian\n\nThis is one of the most underrated comedic lines in the entire movie. When a female classmate calls out Damian for being in the girls' bathroom at school, he responds with the unmatched quote, comparing her to DeVito while running her out of the bathroom, gender norms be damned.\n\n1. \"She doesn\u2019t even go here!\" \u2212 Damian\n\nThis Damian line, which he shouts during an all-girls assembly after the movie\u2019s infamous \"Burn Book\" comes up more often than you\u2019d think in every day life. \u201cDoes that man even work in our office? He doesn\u2019t even go here!\u201d Case in point: We\u2019re glad Tina Fey went here.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2019/04/30/mean-girls-anniversary-definitive-ranking-movies-quotes/3589736002/", "description": "In honor of \"Mean Girls\" Day on Oct. 3, we rounded up the best quotes from the Tina Fey comedy.", "authors": ["David Oliver", "Anika Reed", "Published A.M.
