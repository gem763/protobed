(Celeste Sloman/for The Washington Post)\n\nLester Holt started thinking about crime and punishment in 1995 after serving as a media witness to the execution of George Del Vecchio.\n\n\u201cThere was something about that night,\u201d Holt recently recalled, while seated in his fourth-floor office overlooking Rockefeller Plaza in Midtown Manhattan. \u201cIt was after midnight, and we\u2019re in this cold brick building. There was a curtain. The curtain opened up and the warden was wearing a headset, and then he said,\u201d \u2014 Holt tilted his slim 6-foot-2 frame forward and lowered his already low newscaster baritone \u2014 \u201c\u2018Proceed.\u2019\u201d\n\nAt the time, Holt was an anchor at the local CBS affiliate in Chicago. \u201cI wanted to stand up and go, \u2018Wait a second, we\u2019re going to kill a guy?\u2019 \u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t, Holt was quick to point out, that the experience caused him to oppose the death penalty. He had no great sympathy for Del Vecchio, who had killed a boy and raped the boy\u2019s mother. Holt simply wondered, after the curtain opened and the injection was given, whether Del Vecchio\u2019s death made the world any safer.\n\nBut that was the mid-1990s, when the 1994 federal crime bill stiffened sentencing requirements and contributed to what is now call mass incarceration. \u201c[Criminal justice] wasn\u2019t a proper thing to talk about,\u201d Holt said. \u201cIt was not something that I covered much after that for many years.\u201d\n\nBut time has caught up with the issue, and Holt\u2019s question is freshly relevant. It feels like a story he has been waiting all this time to cover.\n\nAnd, he\u2019s primed to do it from one of the most powerful chairs in the news business as the anchor of NBC\u2019s \u201cNightly News.\u201d \u201cNow,\u201d Holt said, \u201cit is very popular to talk about these things.\u201d\n\nBut he is mostly recognized for his staid and steady demeanor and describes his style as \u201crespectful and respectfully persistent.\u201d He persisted his way into getting President Trump to admit in 2017 that \u201cthis Russia thing with Trump\u201d was on his mind when he decided to fire FBI Director James B. Comey.\n\nHis reserve on air can feel like a throwback. While cable news invites anchors to express disapproval and horror at the day\u2019s events or to tear up at all the right moments, the nightly news broadcasts \u2014 which draw vastly larger audiences than their cable counterparts \u2014 resist that impetus.\n\nSince Holt took the anchor chair, NBC has dropped behind ABC\u2019s \u201cWorld News Tonight With David Muir\u201d in total viewers, but his show remains the No. 1 program among adults 25-54, the demographic advertisers most care about. Both programs rate above \u201cCBS Evening News,\u201d which recently anointed Norah O\u2019Donnell as its anchor in an effort to boost its third-place ranking.\n\nDespite his position, Holt represents \u201cthe anti-diva approach to being the network news anchor,\u201d said Andrea Mitchell, chief foreign affairs correspondent for NBC News. \u201cI\u2019ve seen him in the middle of the night in terrible weather on the tarmac in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, anchoring \u2018Nightly News\u2019 without a teleprompter and just notes off an iPad. We\u2019re all in sleeping bags with no facilities, and he\u2019s just completely calm.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn his free time, Holt plays in a band. (Celeste Sloman/for The Washington Post)\n\n[ABC news anchor David Muir: \u2018I\u2019m having a conversation with America in a very polarized time\u2019]\n\nHolt, who is 60, is the first African American to anchor a broadcast nightly news program without a white counterpart. (Max Robinson was one of three anchors of ABC's \"World News Tonight\" alongside Peter Jennings and Frank Reynolds from 1978 to 1983. CNN's Bernard Shaw anchored the cable network's prime-time news program beginning in 1980.)\n\nHe is often described in terms of the racial barrier he broke and admits that he \u201csometimes bristles at covering every story as the first this or the first that,\u201d because \u201cmany of these things are just a matter of now the moment has come. I mean, there was no sign that said: \u2018Blacks Need Not Apply for Nightly News,\u2019 but the reality was that there are only three jobs between the three networks, and by all appearances all those people were going to be in those jobs for a very long time.\u201d\n\nBut then, Brian Williams, who hosted \u201cNightly News\u201d until 2015, embellished his own role in covering the news, and Holt \u2014 who had been a weekend anchor for NBC News \u2014 was suddenly in the chair.\n\nHolt\u2019s versatility says something about how he managed to get here.\n\nHe initially wanted to be a disc jockey, and his first paying broadcast job was as an overnight weekend DJ at a country western radio station in Sacramento, with the call letters KRAK. \u201cK-R-A-K,\u201d Holt helpfully spelled out. \u201cImagine that name in 2019.\u201d\n\nHe transitioned to a full-time job as a news reporter. They gave him a Jeep Cherokee with the KRAK logo emblazoned on it and outfitted the interior with radio scanners so he could chase fire and police calls. In that job, Holt discovered his love of the news.\n\nEventually, he was hired by Johnathan Rodgers as an anchor at WBBM, the CBS-owned TV station in Chicago. Both men had grown up as military brats, and Rodgers, who is black, said that when he met Holt, he immediately wanted to hire him because he thought, \u201cOh this guy is just like me!\u201d\n\nRichard Prince, who is a veteran journalist and writes a column about diversity in the news media, said Holt was hired in Chicago amid a boycott of the local station led by Jesse Jackson, who argued that they did not have enough African Americans on air.\n\n\u201cSo [Holt] has a history of being intertwined with the race issue, but when he got the job he tried to shy away from that,\u201d Prince said.\n\nHolt spent 14 years in Chicago but was eventually faced with relatively low ratings and a possible demotion. Instead of staying, he hunted for a new job and in 2000 found one at MSNBC in New York.\n\nHis career setback in Chicago shook his confidence and made him work even harder. At MSNBC he reported from the anchor chair for such long stretches that colleagues gave him the nickname \u201cIron Pants.\u201d The next five years provided him ample opportunity to be noticed. First came the Florida recount, then 9/11, then the invasion of Afghanistan, then the invasion of Iraq. He started appearing on \u201cWeekend Today\u201d and eventually moved to the broadcast division of NBC News.\n\n\n\nHolt in his office. (Celeste Sloman/for The Washington Post)\n\nLately Holt, who was a registered Republican until 2016 and is now an independent, has been shaping his program to include more explicit discussions of race.\n\nLast fall, Andrew Tyndall, who tracks the weekday network evening newscasts at the three networks, penned a report focused on Holt\u2019s nascent coverage of racially significant topics.\n\nIn it, Tyndall wrote that after several years of projecting \u201ca persona that was uninflected by racial insights,\u201d Holt had aired segments on his own discovery \u2014 at the National Memorial for Peace and Justice (informally known as the National Lynching Museum) \u2014 that one of his ancestors had probably been lynched. Another segment focused on redlining in Kansas City.\n\nWhile Holt acknowledges that he is making the broadcast his own, he appears loath to embrace labels.\n\n\u201cThere has been no sense of, \u2018I\u2019m a black anchor and therefore we\u2019re going to do black stories,\u2019 \u201d he said. Race and criminal justice are \u201cthe issues of our time right now.\u201d These are issues \u201cwe\u2019re all reporting on.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never come with an agenda. I was one of those that always said, \u2018I\u2019m an anchor who is black, but I don\u2019t come here as a black anchor, and there\u2019s a difference. . . . I can\u2019t escape the fact that I\u2019m here as a result of people who\u2019ve demanded rights and tried to awaken this country. So I have a certain sensitivity and a certain access to cover certain stories, and that\u2019s what we ask of anyone here.\u201d\n\nRodgers noted that Holt has always wanted to be assessed first for his work and perceived as \u201can anchor who happens to be black by the audience and management.\u201d But however Holt wanted to be seen, a third of the audience in Chicago was African American, Rodgers said. \u201cThey perceived him as a black anchor, and that was beneficial to us.\u201d\n\nErrin Whack, who covers racial issues for the Associated Press, said Holt\u2019s reserved demeanor has helped gain the trust of millions of Americans. Now, \u201che has the power with his perch in the \u2018Nightly News\u2019 kingdom to say that criminal justice is a priority.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are not many people who are black who have had the trust of as many white Americans as this man has,\u201d added Whack, who is black.\n\n[\u2018Time to shake things up\u2019: Norah O\u2019Donnell takes over at ratings-challenged \u2018CBS Evening News\u2019]\n\nThe incarcerated population in the United States makes up 20 percent of the total number of people in prison globally. But the country represents only 5 percent of the global population. That statistic was among the many that Holt and \"Dateline\" producer Dan Slepian presented to NBC News top brass to persuade them to devote a week of programming to the criminal justice system with Holt acting as something of the master of ceremonies. The focus is in part because of Holt's own championing of the issue internally.\n\nOnce NBC was on board, the question was how to make a compelling show about prison reform. \u201cI guess there were conversations, \u2018What if we lock up Lester?\u2019 \u201d Holt recalled. \u201cI laughed and I said, \u2018Are you crazy?\u2019 \u201d\n\nHis first concern was that it would feel like a gimmick. But he was eventually convinced that he could embed in the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola, the country\u2019s largest maximum-security prison, in the same way a reporter embeds with troops at war.\n\nThe land on which Angola sits was formerly three separate slave plantations, one of them named after the home country of the slaves held there.\n\nThe significance of embedding a black man in a prison filled mostly with other black men was not lost on Holt.\n\nAngola still operates a farm, where prisoners grow everything from tobacco to carrots. The inmates are paid pennies a day for their work. One afternoon, Holt was out in the fields with them, and one said: \u201cIt\u2019s like slavery out here.\u201d Holt replied, \u201cEveryone here looks like us.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously not slavery, but you know, I couldn\u2019t help but be struck by here we are a bunch of black guys picking produce,\u201d he said.\n\nThis story has been updated to correct the date of Holt\u2019s party affiliation change and the classification of Angola.", "description": "The NBC anchor brings old-school poise to coverage of the criminal justice system.", "authors": ["Sarah Ellison", "Reporter Covering Media", "Its Intersection With Politics", "September At Am", "Sarah Ellison Is A Staff Writer Based In New York For The Washington Post.
