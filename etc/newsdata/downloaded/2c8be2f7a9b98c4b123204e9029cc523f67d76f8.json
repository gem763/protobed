His privilege made him do it!\n\nThis, in essence, is the Canadian prime minister\u2019s defense for having donned blackface or brownface on one, or three, or, honestly, who knows how many occasions in his younger and more callow years, including as, uh, a teacher of impressionable children. Oh, Canada . . .\n\nPeople in the United States might feel a smidge of schadenfreude at our neighbor\u2019s struggle with a transgression alarmingly common among politicians here at home \u2014 if only our own schaden weren\u2019t so tremendous. Still, there\u2019s something about the Trudeau story that makes it especially hard to ignore, and his explanation for his behavior gets right at it.\n\n\u201cI came from a place of privilege . . . but now I have to acknowledge that that comes with a massive blind spot,\u201d Trudeau told reporters in the latest of his multiple apologies for his multiple mistakes. \u201cThe fact of the matter is I\u2019ve always \u2014 and you\u2019ll know this \u2014 been more enthusiastic about costumes than is sometimes appropriate,\u201d he told reporters in the first instance.\n\nTrudeau\u2019s critics, of course, have been saying he loves costumes for a long time now. He masks the shallowness of his commitment to the First Nations people with a tattoo based on a Haida design on his sculpted left triceps; he camouflages a retreat from welcoming refugees with a constant flow of lovely language condemning President Trump\u2019s xenophobia.\n\nYet the trouble with Trudeau\u2019s comment comes not only from casting modern-day minstrelsy as just another \u201ccostume,\u201d or even in the coy familiarity Trudeau assumes his audience has with his proclivity for dress-up. No, the trouble comes from the concept that enthusiasm is an excuse \u2014 as if Trudeau were a small child who simply could not help himself from dressing up in Jamaican garb and singing the banana boat song, or dressing up as a turbaned character from \u201cAladdin\u201d for an Arabian Nights party, or dressing up as whatever on earth he\u2019s supposed to look like in the most recently released dark makeup video, because, gosh, it was just so fun!\n\nTrudeau speaks with the bashfulness of a man who expects sympathy from a country that adores him as a father does his little boy. That\u2019s fitting for the scion of a Quebecois dynasty and son of former prime minister, the late Joseph Philippe Pierre Yves Elliott Trudeau. He didn\u2019t do better because he didn\u2019t \u201cknow better,\u201d and he didn\u2019t know better because no one ever taught him.\n\nJustin Trudeau sounds a bit like the adult version of the notorious affluenza teen who drunkenly drove a Ford F-350 into more than 14 people and killed four, then had a psychologist testify that his permissive upbringing in a world of wealth had left him ignorant of the ramifications of his actions. You see, your Honor, he was never told \u201cno.\u201d\n\nThat Trudeau is a relatively liberal politician living in a relatively liberal country \u2014 one that markets itself as a haven of multiculturalism and tolerance and, in many ways, actually is \u2014 likely amplified the problem. He never learned a lesson because he was always getting gold stars for doing relatively liberal things.\n\nIt\u2019s obvious what\u2019s wrong with treating the thing that caused insensitive behavior as a reason you expect forgiveness for that same insensitive behavior. Ignorance won\u2019t go away if it justifies itself. There\u2019s a catch, though: Trudeau isn\u2019t wrong.\n\nTrudeau says he \u201cdidn\u2019t understand how hurtful this is to people who live with discrimination every single day,\u201d because he doesn\u2019t live with discrimination every day. It\u2019s a cop-out on one level, but on another his words underscore a precept of responsible identity politicking: Check your privilege, the exhortation-turned-clich\u00e9 goes. It means acknowledge your advantages \u2014 both how they\u2019ve helped you, and how they limit you when it comes to comprehending others\u2019 less-charmed lives.\n\nThe line between checking privilege as a responsible exercise and checking privilege as an irresponsible excuse might depend in part on what exactly \u201ccheck\u201d means. Does it mean just taking a look at to make sure the privilege is there, and then declaring it as if you were passing through customs? You\u2019ve admitted you have it, so now you\u2019re off the hook? Or does it mean checking it like you check a coat? You leave it behind, and you leave yourself exposed to all those consequences the privilege has so far permitted you to avoid?\n\nWhat Trudeau teaches us is that there\u2019s a difference between insisting that you didn\u2019t see something and insisting that you couldn\u2019t see something \u2014 between blaming your fortunate circumstances for your failure and blaming yourself, then accepting whatever comes your way because you failed.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t consider it racist at the time,\u201d Trudeau said, \u201cbut now we know better.\u201d There\u2019s the essential question: Do we really?", "description": "Now that he knows better, will he really do better?", "authors": ["Molly Roberts", "Editorial Writer Covering Technology", "Editorial Writer", "September At Pm", "Molly Roberts Writes About Technology", "Society For The Post'S Opinions Section."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/OaQiZHnqWcDBuohk7-i5SVZCvGE=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PJNP5PG36MI6TP5RQSMIONUUOY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
