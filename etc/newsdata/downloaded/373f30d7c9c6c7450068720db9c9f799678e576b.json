The Los Angeles County District Attorney's office announced the decision Tuesday about the case stemming from a masseur's allegations that Spacey inappropriately touched him during a massage session at a home in Malibu, California, in October 2016.\n\nThe decision states that the allegations against Spacey could not be proven without the masseur's participation. The man also sued Spacey under the alias John Doe in a case that remains pending in federal court.\n\nAn email sent to Spacey's lawyer Alan Jackson was not immediately returned.\n\nMassachusetts prosecutors in July dropped a criminal case against Spacey filed after accusations that he groped an 18-year-old man at a bar on the resort island of Nantucket in 2016. In that case, Spacey's accuser invoked his Fifth Amendment right not to testify about text messages from the night of the alleged groping that the defense claimed were deleted.\n\nPolice in London are also investigating allegations of sexual misconduct by Spacey, but there's been no public update on that inquiry.\n\nSpacey publicly apologized in October 2017 to \"Star Trek: Discovery\" actor Anthony Rapp, who accused Spacey of making a sexual advance years ago in his New York apartment, when Spacey was 26 and Rapp was 14. Spacey received flak for coming out as gay in his statement apologizing to Rapp.", "description": "The man also sued Spacey under the alias John Doe in a case that remains pending in federal court", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/07/17/fab3cdb2-beb5-4e8b-a62c-16678bf5c6c3/thumbnail/1200x630/a2eea2b9ff082806f60b481869b4a64b/ap-19170693151002.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
