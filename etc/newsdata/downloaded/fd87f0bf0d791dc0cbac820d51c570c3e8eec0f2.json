Now he has switched up his leaders on the pitch as the club enters a new era.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the game against Southampton on Sunday, Lampard said: 'Yes, Jorginho is vice-captain as it stands. [Azpilicueta] is the captain and that was clear at the start of the season and I think his professionalism and career here speaks for itself.\n\n'Jorginho, I keep talking about him, is a character and a driver. It is very evident to see on the pitch. That\u2019s the situation as it stands.\n\nWhile the 27-year-old is not fluent in English, he has been boosting his language skills in a bid to improve his standing as a leader.\n\nLampard says he believes Jorginho is 'a character and a driver' on and off the pitch\n\n'It is obviously important, we always try here to push that along as soon as players come in because communication is key on and off the pitch,' Lampard said.\n\n'He crosses the borders as it is easy when you come in sometimes to stay within groups of nationalities. Jorginho doesn\u2019t. He is a driver on and off the pitch.'\n\nThe manager's new captains Jorginho and Cesar Azpilicueta link up together in training\n\nJorginho will be relishing his new role when he takes to the field against Southampton this weekend, but Lampard said there were doubts over the fitness of N'Golo Kante. The Frenchman played the full 90 minutes against Lille in midweek but has suffered from niggling injuries this season.\n\nHe added: 'That\u2019s something we will have to watch over the next 24 or 48 hours to make sure he is still on a semi-recovery, as they all are from the trip to Lille. The fact [is] he hasn\u2019t played much obviously.\n\n'In terms of the injury, he is fine. There is no fall out from that from the game. It is just making sure he is fit and ready and that\u2019s a call for myself.'", "description": "Lampard said the former Napoli star was an influential member of the team on and off the pitch despite only recently joining from Italy.", "authors": ["Oli Gamp For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/16/19302662-0-image-a-102_1570201770218.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
