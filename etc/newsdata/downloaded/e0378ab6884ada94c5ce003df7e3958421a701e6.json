Bond market returns were also subdued as a consequence of the US Federal Reserve ( )\u2019s perceived unwillingness to lower interest rates sharply \u2013 despite its 50bps of cuts during the quarter and easing measures in several other countries as well. Amid the increasingly bearish environment in July and August, investor sentiment turned even more cautious, to the benefit of safe havens like gold and bonds (the latter to a lesser extent), while emerging markets suffered losses. Only in September was there some relief for equities, with an uptick across most markets as risk appetite improved. However, this wasn\u2019t enough to erase the quarter\u2019s losses in many markets. For South African investors, local equities posted negative returns, while bonds were only marginally positive, and the rand depreciated notably against all the major currencies for the quarter after having rallied in Q2.\n\nAs shown in the table below, in US$ terms, global equities (the MSCI All Country World Index) were flat for the quarter, with developed markets delivering 0.5% and emerging markets returning -4.2%. Global bonds produced 0.7% and global property 5.7%, buoyed by the Fed\u2019s rate cuts.\n\nMSCI All Country World Index\n\nUS-China trade hostilities ramped up significantly during the quarter: from 1 September the US imposed new tariffs worth US$112 billion on Chinese goods including clothing, shoes and other basic commodities. China retaliated with a further US$75 billion in tariffs (including on ) and a halt in buying some US agricultural goods.\n\nMeanwhile, the Fed lowered interest rates by 25bps in both July and September, in the face of the prospective negative impacts of the trade war and slower global growth. However, it downplayed the prospect of further cuts given the still-expansionary local economy. The latest Fed inflation rate forecasts show no rate changes for the rest of 2019 and 2020, although Fed policymakers were divided in September: 7 members wanted at least one more 25bp cut in 2019 versus 10 advocating against. US GDP growth for Q2 2019 surprised positively at 2.0% y/y, with wage and inflationary pressures remaining subdued. The rate cuts combined with the risk-averse sentiment and surplus global capital to send the 10-year US Treasury (UST) yield down from around 2.0% at the start of the quarter to a low of 1.5% in early September, before weakening again to around 1.7% at quarter-end. The 30-year UST yield, meanwhile, dropped very near a historic low of 1.95% in August. In the equity market, the US returned 1.7%, the 1.3% and the Industrial 1.8% - all in US$. The Barclays (LON: ) US Treasury Index returned 2.4% for the quarter, while the SPDR Barclays 0-5 Year US High Yield Bond UCITS (LON: ) returned 1.3%. The Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Bond Index (US$) delivered 0.7%.\n\nThe UK moved further into a Brexit-related crisis during Q3 as new PM Johnson\u2019s move to suspend Parliament was found to be unlawful by the UK Supreme Court, and Parliament reconvened to pass a measure preventing a no-deal Brexit. With Johnson calling for fresh elections and threatening to ignore Parliament, the foundation of British democratic institutions was challenged. Amid the heightened uncertainty, the pound fell to its lowest level in 12 years against the US dollar and Q2 GDP growth slowed to 1.3% (q/q annualised) versus 2.1% (q/q annualised) in Q1. The BOE left its base interest rate unchanged at 0.75% in September. The UK\u2019s returned -2.2% for the quarter in US$, and government gilts (bonds) delivered 3.2%.\n\nIn the 19-member Eurozone, growth slowed further as the area\u2019s Q2 fell to 1.1% (q/q annualised) from 1.2% previously, impacted significantly by Germany\u2019s export-led economy which slumped to 0.4% growth (q/q annualised) vs 0.9% the previous quarter. Germany\u2019s September dropped to 41.7, its biggest contraction in 10 years. The European Central Bank (ECB) opted to cut interest rates by 10bps to -0.5% (below market expectations of a 20bp cut) and pledged to keep rates at accommodative levels. The ECB also pledged to resume its corporate bond repurchase programme to add stimulus from 1 November. Bond yields across the EU consequently fell further into negative territory. Faced with negative interest rates and relatively high budget deficits in member countries, the EU has little room to add further stimulus should growth falter further. In more positive news, Italy\u2019s politicians managed to form a coalition government, and also avoided EU budget deficit sanctions. For the quarter, Germany\u2019s produced -4.0% and the French delivered -1.7%, while the Barclays (LON: ) Euro Treasury Index returned -0.6% (all in US$).\n\nJapan\u2019s growth decelerated in Q2 2019 to 1.3% (q/q annualised) from 2.2% in Q1 as its export-driven economy continued to be impacted by the US-China trade war and weak business and consumer sentiment. The Bank of Japan left its key interest rate on hold at -0.1% in September but signalled it could implement more stimulus measures as soon as October. Investors and economists are anxious about the planned imposition of a new consumption tax planned for October. For Q3, the returned 2.8% and the Barclays (LON: ) Global Treasury Japan Index posted 0.2% (both in US$).\n\nIn China, 16 consecutive weekends of large and increasingly violent protests in central Hong Kong started to make their impact felt on the island\u2019s economy in the form of lost consumer sales and business turnover. Although the HK government eventually formally withdrew its bill easing extradition conditions to the mainland, residents\u2019 protests swelled over concerns about losing their democratic rights.\n\nAt the same time, Chinese exports continued their decline, impacting China\u2019s overall Q2 growth which came in at 6.2% (q/q annualised), the lowest in 27 years. However, subsequent data showed that the government\u2019s stimulus (in the form of tax cuts, infrastructure spending and lower bank reserve requirements) had started to work, as fixed investment, industrial output and have all risen more recently. Hong Kong\u2019s returned -7.9% for the quarter, and the MSCI China returned -4.7%, both in US$.\n\nAmong other emerging markets, the only strong performance in US$ for the quarter came from the MSCI Turkey, with an 11.7% return. The weakest market was the MSCI South Africa at -12.4%, while the MSCI India recorded -5.2%, South Korea\u2019s -4.8%, Brazil\u2019s -4.6% and the MSCI Russia -0.9%, all in US$.\n\nThe price of fell during Q3, starting off July at around US$65 per barrel and ending September at around US$62 per barrel. In between, however, it weakened to near US$60 per barrel on the back of softer global growth and then spiked some 13% to over US$68 per barrel in reaction to the 17 September drone strike on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil production facilities, which impacted over 50% of the oil giant\u2019s supply. The spike lasted only a day, as Saudi Arabia reported it would be able to recover most of its production very quickly. However, longer-term concerns remain over the protection of Saudi facilities and rising tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Other commodity prices were mixed, as gold gained 5.8% (up 25% in the past year on its safe-haven status), palladium jumped 10%, platinum rose 11.7% and lead was up 8.9%. However, the prices of aluminium, and zinc were all down between 4-8%.\n\nContinue reading", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by David Knee covering: Nasdaq 100, FTSE 100, S&P 500, CAC 40.
