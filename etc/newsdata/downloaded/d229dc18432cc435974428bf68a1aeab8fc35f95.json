He was also ordered by the court not to return to the gas station and to submit to twice-weekly alcohol and drug testing, the Detroit Free-Press reported.", "description": "A man testing out tires crashed his truck into the front doors of a Michigan gas station before he fled the scene, video shows.", "authors": ["Katherine Rodriguez"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Truck-Crashes-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
