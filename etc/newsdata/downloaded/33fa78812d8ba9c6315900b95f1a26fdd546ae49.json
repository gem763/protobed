She got a standing ovation at the show and tons of love online, but her fianc\u00e9 and forever cheerleader Alex Rodriguez may have been the most floored of all.\n\nOn Saturday, A-Rod was obviously still thinking about the show-stopping moment. He posted a behind-the-scenes shot of J.Lo posing in front of a mirror in the gown. His caption was short but pretty direct: \"This woman...,\" he wrote.\n\nThe former baseball player has always shown his love for the singer through very public displays of affection. Not that that's surprising; he said 20 years ago that Lopez was his dream date \u2014 which, we should point out, was right around the time she first wore the iconic plunging-neck sheer dress to the 2000 Grammy Awards. The couple got engaged this year after dating for two years, but J. Lo has said that they're not in a rush to start wedding planning. She's been busy on tour and wrapping up Hustlers, which is being called the \"movie of the year\" and is getting some serious Oscar buzz.\n\nIn an interview with Vogue, J.Lo opened up about the iconic garment, and how it marked a major fashion and pop culture moment (and made her fans' jaws collectively drop both in 2000 and today).\n\n\"That was a moment that captured people\u2019s imaginations, I think . . . in terms of my career, this dress really marked a moment in time,\" she said. \"Even if you don\u2019t know my music and you don\u2019t know my movies, people know about that moment and that dress. That was it.\"\n\nOriginally Appeared on Glamour\n\n", "description": "He posted a behind-the-scenes look of J.Lo in THAT dress.", "authors": ["Julyssa Lopez"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2TJ4TuRkX2yEYNFsuY_8Zg--~B/aD02ODM7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/glamour_497/83e01519e62c6d93fae64afe3d9bc2b2", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
