As a result of the influx, rents across much of Berlin have doubled over the past decade and are rising faster than in any other German city, far outpacing income growth.\n\nThe development has triggered an emotional debate over the rights of renters and property owners, stirring political ghosts many believed lay buried under the rubble of the Berlin Wall. Facing pressure from the 85 percent of Berliners who rent, the city\u2019s leftist government is likely to enact legislation in the coming weeks straight out of the Hugo Ch\u00e1vez playbook.\n\nInvestors and most economists warn that proposed rent controls will only worsen the crisis by stifling investment in new construction and fueling a black market for flats. Anyone with an existing contract in a good location will be loathe to give it up. The only viable way to alleviate the price pressures would be for the city to cut red tape for new construction and offer investors incentives to build.\n\n\u201cThis is about values. We want radical change\" \u2014 Sandrine Woinzeck, activist campaigning for political intervention\n\nThose arguments have largely fallen on deaf ears, however. For many locals, \u201cinvestor\u201d is a four-letter word. Giving capitalists more influence would be tantamount to treason. For the hardcore Berliner, what\u2019s really at stake isn\u2019t just how much rent people pay, but the city's soul.\n\n\u201cThis is about values,\u201d Sandrine Woinzeck, an activist campaigning for political intervention, explained during a recent demonstration. \u201cWe want radical change.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s in the right place.\n\nRadical measures\n\nA local initiative recently collected nearly 80,000 signatures supporting the expropriation of apartments owned by large corporate landlords, a step Berlin\u2019s government \u2014 a coalition of the Social Democrats, the Left and the Greens \u2014 is now considering. Just how much the current owners would receive in compensation isn\u2019t clear.\n\nNot to be outdone, Berlin\u2019s top housing official proposed a set of radical measures last month that would cut many existing rents by more than half and freeze them for five years.\n\nUnder the plan, which will go to a city council vote next month, most new rents would be capped well below current market rates. Tenants could apply for a reduction in their existing rent if they spend more than 30 percent of their household income to service the lease, provided the city determines the size of the flat is commensurate with the number of people living in it. The city wants to prevent the well-off and those living alone in large apartments from benefiting.\n\nIf these ideas sound like vestiges of Berlin\u2019s recent communist past, that\u2019s because they are. Berlin housing chief Katrin Lompscher, the plan\u2019s mastermind, belongs to the Left party, the successor to the Communist Party that ruled East Germany for decades, and to which she also belonged.\n\n\u201cWe want to set a rent level that people can afford,\u201d she said during a public radio discussion earlier this month.\n\nThat\u2019s a new challenge for the city.\n\nWhen I moved to Berlin a decade ago, what struck me most was that Berliners never talked about real estate.\n\nOver the past decade, Berlin\u2019s population has grown by 12 percent to 3.75 million.\n\nArriving from New York, a city where every chat at a dinner party or playground would inevitably turn to the latest news on rents, housing prices or the conversation killing \u201cif only we\u2019d bought five years ago,\u201d it was jarring to find myself in the company of people for whom the subject of housing was as compelling as a wet schnitzel.\n\nIn Berlin \u2014 whether in bobo Prenzlauer Berg, trendy Kreuzberg or on the leafy streets of staid Charlottenburg \u2014 nice apartments were plentiful and affordable. The rent for the newly renovated pre-war apartment we moved into in 2009 was slightly less than half what we'd paid in Brooklyn for a place less than half the size.\n\nA city of more than 4 million before World War II, Berlin\u2019s population had shrunk by 20 percent by the time the Wall fell and didn\u2019t grow much over the next two decades.\n\nJust about anyone could afford to move to the German capital and in the years that followed my own arrival, it seemed like they did. The city\u2019s cheap rents and reputation as Europe\u2019s capital of cool drew newcomers like moths to the flame.\n\nOver the past decade, Berlin\u2019s population has grown by 12 percent to 3.75 million. The number of Ausl\u00e4nder, foreigners like me, has grown even faster \u2014 by 65 percent since 2009 to 759,000.\n\nWhile the influx has undoubtedly made the city more diverse and dynamic than at any time since the 1920s, it\u2019s also to blame for the rise in rents.\n\nAs a result, Berlin has started to sound a lot more like New York, with old-timers complaining about getting \u201cpriced out\u201d of trendy neighborhoods and everyone complaining about the cutthroat competition for new flats.\n\nStrike up a conversation with a Berliner these days and it won\u2019t be long before they give you an earful about the dearth of apartments and the scourge of rising rents. Tens of thousands of people have turned out to demonstrate against rising rents in favor of expropriating large real estate investors in recent months.\n\nThe art of real estate\n\nThe housing woes are even driving the discussion in the city\u2019s burgeoning post-modernist arts scene.\n\nOver the summer, artist Clemens Sch\u00f6ll unveiled an installation he calls \u201cFrom one who set out to find an apartment in Berlin. A drama of automation in three acts.\u201d\n\nIn act two \u2014 called \u201cThe Promise of the Bot\u201d \u2014 Sch\u00f6ll, who is also an IT specialist, offered Berliners free access to a program that trolls real estate websites and automatically sends applications for apartments that meet an individual\u2019s requirements. The Berlin market has become so competitive that some ads are online for an hour or less before the landlord, overloaded by applications, removes them. Sch\u00f6ll\u2019s tool levels the playing field.\n\nSch\u00f6ll hoped the project would highlight the societal tensions automation creates between those who are pushed out of their jobs and apartments by gentrification and those who have new opportunities as a result of technological advances.\n\nThat deeper meaning is likely lost on most users, however, for whom Sch\u00f6ll\u2019s innovation is simply a useful weapon to combat der Mietenwahnsinn.\n\nVirtually no one is spared the effects of Berlin\u2019s dog-eat-dog real estate world, a reality I\u2019ve discovered manifests itself in surprising ways.\n\nLast weekend, a neighbor stopped by to apologize for a group of kids that had been screaming in the courtyard of our building at lunchtime. Her landlord is trying to sell her apartment to cash in on the booming property market and the neighbor was hoping to scare off potential buyers during an open house that day.\n\nThe neighbor has been living in the apartment for 10 years, but once it is sold, she and her family are likely to get kicked out. Finding a new place in central Berlin for a good price will be next to impossible, even if the city government pushes through rent control reform.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m losing it,\u201d she confided.\n\nOne by one the residents in our building have faced a similar fate.\n\nMy family and I were the first.\n\nAfter a decade of paying bargain-basement rent, der Mietenwahnsinn left us with only one option: We bought.", "description": "Berliners never used to talk about real estate.
