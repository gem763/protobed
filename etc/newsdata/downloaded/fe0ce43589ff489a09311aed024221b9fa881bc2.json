It\u2019s now up over 25% from its August low, although it\u2019s still lost around half its value since May 2018.\n\nLikewise, Ryanair (LON: ) and EasyJet (LON: ), two of the online-savvy discount flyers who created the opportunities for people to take their business away from Thomas Cook, also extended their rally, rising 2.2% and 0.9%, respectively.\n\nEasyJet is now testing a four-month high, having recovered in recent weeks amid growing confidence that a disorderly \u201cHard Brexit\u201d can be avoided at the end of October. Ryanair, which is exposed to almost all the same risks as its rival, has made less of a recovery due to rolling strikes by its aircrew, but that issue also seems as if it may be edging closer to resolution after pilots based in the U.K. called off a series of strikes that were scheduled for this week.\n\nSo, all-clear for take-off then? Probably not. Here\u2019s what Tui had to say about the underlying market conditions in a statement to the stock exchange on Monday. A roaring bull case, it isn\u2019t. It starts by saying its vertically integrated business model is \u201cresilient\u201d, but quickly goes on to list some formidable and long-running challenges: \u201cOur Markets & Airlines business faces a number of ongoing external challenges such as the grounding of the 737 MAX aircraft, airline overcapacities and continued Brexit uncertainty.\u201c\n\nUnderlying operating profit this year is still expected to drop 26% from 2018, and \u201cthese external challenges will continue in (2020) \u2013 therefore, we will focus on becoming more cost competitive in our Markets & Airlines business to protect and extend our market share where possible.\u201d\n\nAnd that's before the weakening labor market in Germany starts hitting people's travel budgets.\n\nThe travel companies are all outperforming their local benchmarks for a second day, after the German business survey reinforced the picture of gloom around Europe's largest economy and the comparable French Insee business confidence index also inched down. The benchmark was up 0.2% at 390.58, while the German was up 0.1% and the was essentially unchanged.", "description": "StockBeat: Thomas Cook Demise Leaves Tui Sitting (a Bit) Prettier", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEE780OD_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
