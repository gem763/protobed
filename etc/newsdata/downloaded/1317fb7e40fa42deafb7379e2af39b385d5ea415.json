Mr Price said Horizon still faced interest rates of up to 14 per cent on loans that may be required for its $52 million purchase and refurbishment of a gold mill near West Australia's Coolgardie in the state's east.\n\nMr Price said they will not invest in a project unless they can make a minimum profit margin of $500 per ounce. Asked why he would not invest if he could only make $300 per ounce, he said: \"There is an inherent risk in mining...it often costs more, it often takes longer and the grade can often disappoint.

It would be good to hear more such reports.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTreasurer Josh Frydenberg has repeatedly urged companies to invest in growing their business, rather than return capital to shareholders.\n\nAGL Energy chief financial officer Damien Nicks said the utility's hurdle rates hadn't changed and stood at 12 per cent, on a post tax nominal basis.\n\nAsked about hurdle rates for new projects such as batteries at AGL Energy's investor day in Sydney, Mr Nicks said the level was \"absolutely appropriate in today's market\" given the projects had asset lives of 10, 15 or 20 years.\n\nMr Nicks said AGL had never had a project not get up because of hurdle rates, adding that good projects typically made the grade.\n\nAny project involving a higher level of risk requires a higher hurdle rate, he said.", "description": "Chief executives and chairman aren't rushing to lower hurdle rates, despite urging from RBA governor Philip Lowe.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2188%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_471%2C$y_117/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c9ba1466f3cd9ffe987d42063ac4447debd88777", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
