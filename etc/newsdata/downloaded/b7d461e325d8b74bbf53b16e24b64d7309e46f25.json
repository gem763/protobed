LeBron James. Anthony Davis. The Los Angeles market. Great weather.\n\nThe Lakers can offer plenty to anyone who gets bought out this season.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nNow, the Lakers \u2013 who lost DeMarcus Cousins to a torn ACL \u2013 get a mechanism to offer post-buyout players more money.\n\nShams Charania of The Athletic:\n\nThe Lakers have been granted a disabled player exception worth $1.75M from the NBA for the expected season-ending ACL injury to DeMarcus Cousins, league sources tell @TheAthleticNBA @Stadium. It expires on March 10, 2020. \u2014 Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) September 19, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nThe exception holds little value presently. It\u2019s worth less than a full-season minimum salary for anyone with more than four years experience.\n\nBut minimum-salary and mid-level exceptions decline throughout the season. This exception does not.\n\nSo, on March 1, a team with only a minimum slot available can offer a free agent just between $233,459 and $666,546 (depending on the player\u2019s experience level). The Lakers can offer $1.75 million.\n\nThis means an NBA-appointed doctor ruled Cousins is \u201csubstantially more likely than not\u201d to be out through June 15. Given that prognosis, the Lakers could open a roster spot by waiving Cousins, who\u2019s on a one-year deal and facing a domestic-violence charge. They\u2019d still keep the exception.\n\nIf Cousins can return more quickly than expected, he\u2019d be eligible to play, whether or not the Lakers use the exception.", "description": "The Lakers \u2013 who lost DeMarcus Cousins to a torn ACL \u2013 get a mechanism to offer post-buyout players more money.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/AR6BUBwCuMo8Yyu0WTXeNg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/OCzyBDWE_caFOLzwyo.ysQ--~B/aD01NzY7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/c08be11262d9be97cf5e1dfeb30224b3", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
