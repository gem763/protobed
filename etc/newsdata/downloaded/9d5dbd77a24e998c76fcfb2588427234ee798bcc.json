Trigger warnings are given verbally or on an internal website named Moodle so that students know about content that could upset them. Complaints have led to warnings being read out.\n\nSo-called 'trigger warnings' are part of a growing trend which sees undergraduates warned about content they could find disturbing\n\nClassics students at Glasgow, studying Greek and Roman culture, said staff 'frequently flag if we are dealing with certain types of content, both to alert students to what is coming and to make it clear that we are examining a very different culture from our own - and certainly not endorsing the material covered'.\n\nThey said that this could include 'sexual assault and rape', 'extreme expressions of misogyny', suicide, and racist language and behaviour.\n\nIn a theology and religious studies course at Glasgow University, students are told 'we are going to be talking about torture and brutal violence with sexual elements', adding: 'Otherwise, no trigger warnings.'\n\nAnd a history lecturer, teaching courses on sex and religion in the West, and Christianity and the sexual revolution, reads out a trigger warning which states: 'Some of the references will be to heterosexual and homosexual activities between adults which were illegal in the mid-20th century, and a few are still illegal. But there will be 'no display of sexually explicit material, merely discussion of it'.\n\nSome of the material in the fairytales includes child abuse, incest and other violent material\n\nGlasgow University's veterinary college said that in an animal biology course, 'humorous' images are used to 'highlight and illustrate important discussion points'.\n\nIt added: 'In response to a complaint (before the lecture, not after, and based on the draft slides put on Moodle), a content trigger warning was included on three slides that go up on Moodle.\n\n'The complaint was about what can be summed up as \"sexism\". The wording of my warning in the slides is: \"Images used here are light-hearted humour intended to illustrate important points being discussed at this point in the lecture\".\n\n'This serves to warn students that the images used in the actual lecture are NOT intended to be taken seriously, they serve to engage the students to think about what the real state of the world is, as opposed to what popular imagination holds it to be.\n\n'The topic being covered at this point in the lecture is the evolution via sexual selection of differences in brain structure and function between males and females of several species, including the idea that this is likely also to be true for humans.'\n\nThe University of Edinburgh said the school of history, classics and archaeology 'provides a warning for a tutorial in the \"Medieval Worlds: A Journey Through the Middle Ages\" course that involves discussion of a piece of medieval travel writing that reports acts of sexual violence witnessed by the writer'.\n\nThe school said: 'Before accessing the document, students are given a warning stating: \"Please note that there are details of sexual abuse and violence in the extracts\".'\n\nIn 2017, the Mail revealed that students of religion at Glasgow University were being warned about images of the Crucifixion that could upset them - understood to relate to a screening of the Mel Gibson film The Passion of the Christ.\n\nLast night, Dr Waiton said: 'One of the potential dangers of trigger warnings is that they help to elevate the idea that words are harmful.\n\n'The fairytale example is particularly illustrative given the past presumption that children could read these books without the need of therapeutic guidance.' Glasgow University said the fairytale warning related to a course which ran last academic year, but declined to comment further.\n\nUniversities Scotland previously said there was no sector-wide policy on trigger warnings, but it was 'monitoring' the situation.\n\nLast night, the body said it could not comment on the policies of individual universities.\n\nA Scottish Tory party spokesman said: 'This advice seems to be a bit patronising to young adults who have most likely long since stopped reading fairytales. If trigger warnings are throwing up this kind of \"concern\", universities have to consider if they are fit for purpose.'", "description": "A modern languages and cultures course at Glasgow University is giving students 'trigger warnings' about fairytales such as Snow White, Hansel and Gretel and Little Red Riding Hood.", "authors": ["Graham Grant Home Affairs Editor For The Scottish Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/11/20213444-0-image-a-27_1572086220779.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
