Harry has been going to the awards for years as a patron and supporter.\n\n\"Yet this year, it resonates in a different way, because now I\u2019m a father,\" he said. \"Last year, when my wife and I attended, we knew we were expecting our first child \u2013 no one else did at the time, but we did \u2013 and I remember \u2026\"\n\nPrince Harry gets emotional while speaking about Archie at the #WellChild Awards (via @hellomag) pic.twitter.com/wpGKB72AJM \u2014 HELLO! Canada (@HelloCanada) October 15, 2019\n\nAt this point, Harry, 35, stopped, chuckled a little and then bent slightly over the podium.\n\nAs he fought back tears, the awards host, British actress and presenter Gaby Roslin, stepped over to pat his back as the crowd applauded, according to video posted on Twitter.\n\nThen he continued.\n\n\"I remember squeezing Meghan\u2019s hand so tight during the awards, both of us thinking what it would be like to be parents one day, and more so, what it would be like to do everything we could to protect and help our child should they be born with immediate challenges or become unwell over time,\" he said.\n\n\"And now, as parents, being here and speaking to all of you pulls at my heartstrings in a way I could have never understood until I had a child of my own,\" Harry said.\n\nPrince Harry and Duchess Meghan of Sussex at the annual WellChild Awards in London on Oct. 15, 2019.

So thank you for being you.\"\n\nMeghan, 38, later joined him on the stage but did not speak.\n\nEarlier, at a reception with families, they received gifts for Archie, born May 6, including a baby onesie. Pictures of the two of them showed Meghan looking adoringly at Harry; they were holding hands when they arrived.\n\nPrince Harry and Duchess Meghan of Sussex look at a gift for baby Archie at the annual WellChild Awards in London on Oct. 15, 2019.
