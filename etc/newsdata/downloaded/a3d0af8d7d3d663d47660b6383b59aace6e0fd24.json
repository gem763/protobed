Regulators filed a lawsuit against Navient, accusing it of making it harder for borrowers to repay loans by giving th Expand\n\nThe memo\u2060 \u2060\u2014 written in 2010 by an employee of Navient\u2019s then-owner Sallie Mae \u2014 emphasizes the company\u2019s strategy relying on forbearance, which postpones loan payments for a time while interest continues to accrue.\n\n\u201cOur battle cry remains \u2018forbear them, forbear them, make them relinquish the ball.\u2019\u201d the memo states. \u201cSaid another way, we are very liberal with the use of forbearance once it is determined that a borrower cannot pay cash or utilize other entitlement programs.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany borrowers would be better off being placed on income-driven repayment plans that would prove to be cheaper in the long run, according to the Student Borrower Protection Center.\n\nSeth Frotman, the center\u2019s executive director and a former official with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, said the practice added billions of dollars of debt for struggling borrowers.\n\n\u201cThis follows a decade-long pattern of Navient ripping off service members, disabled veterans, teachers and American taxpayers,\u201d he said.\n\nThe CFPB has made similar accusations, which Navient has denied. Officials alleged the company added nearly $4 billion in interest between 2010 and 2015 with predatory servicing practices and the overuse of forbearance. The bureau and the company have been locked in a legal battle since 2017, and the memo was unsealed in a filing related to that case.\n\nPaul Hartwick, a company spokesperson said the memo was written in June of 2010, before any direct federal loan cases had been referred to Navient. He called the way the memo has been characterized in the CFPB\u2019s lawsuit \u201cunfair and misleading.\u201d\n\nThe unsealed memo goes on to state that seven out of 10 of its education borrowers will forbear.\n\n\u201cThat mix is likely to change over time as we improve our ability to communicate the benefits of and fulfill other programs such as \u2018Income-Based Repayment,\u2019\u201d it reads.\n\nThe Student Borrower Protection Center said Navient\u2019s CEO was repeatedly told that customers had been placed into high-cost repayment options instead of the income-driven repayment, but the company's leadership didn't act in the best interest of consumers.\n\n\u201cThe time has come for policymakers to admit this company\u2019s practices are predatory and corrupt,\u201d Frotman said. \u201cIt should not be given a single additional taxpayer dollar.\u201d\n\nNavient says on its website that it \u201cis a leader in enrolling eligible borrowers into income-driven repayment programs\u201d and that it services more student loan balances for the government that are enrolled in such programs than any comparable company.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "A student loan processing company has been accused of pushing borrowers to plans that incurred more interest.", "authors": ["James Leggate"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/studentloan-2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
