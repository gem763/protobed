The companies pay the associated costs and use the bodies for medical education and research, and families save burial or cremation costs.\n\nBut Jim Stauffer, one of the men suing BRC, said he felt \u201cfoolish\u201d after donating his mother\u2019s body to the firm. It later emerged the 74-year-old\u2019s corpse was passed to the US Army, who strapped it to a chair and detonated a bomb underneath.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a trusting person, but in this situation \u2013 you have no idea this is going on \u2013 you trust. That trust is what they feed on,\u201d said Mr Stauffer, who added that he had explicitly asked his mother\u2019s remains not be used in this way.\n\nDavid TeSelle, representing the families who filed the lawsuit, told jurors on Monday that the facility had promised them their relatives\u2019 remains would be used for medical research and treated with respect and dignity.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

He showed jurors the business\u2019 price list, noting that a torso without a head went for $4,000 (\u00a33,100).\n\n\u201cThis is a case about honesty, dignity and respect owed to a loved one,\u201d Mr TeSelle said.\n\nIn all, the relatives of 23 people are suing BRC.\n\nThough Gore has denied the allegations in the lawsuit, he acknowledged when pleading guilty in 2015 that his company had provided vendors with human tissue that was contaminated and used the donations in ways that went against the wishes of the donors.\n\nIn a letter to the sentencing judge, Gore said he should have supervised his employees more closely and could have been more transparent about the donation process in his company\u2019s brochure.\n\nOn Monday, Gore\u2019s lawyer Timothy O\u2019Connor said the facility\u2019s clients had signed consent forms granting permission to dissect donated bodies, and that it was legal for the facility to make a profit. \u201dEvery single donor or a family member signed one of these consent forms,\u201d he said.\n\nAdditional reporting by Associated Press", "description": "A company handling dead bodies that were donated for medical research secretly sold them on for military explosives testing, a court has been told.
