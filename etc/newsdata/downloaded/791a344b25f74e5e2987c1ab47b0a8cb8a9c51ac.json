'To grab him and kiss him, he was always playing around the mosque.\n\n'It's more than horrible. We cannot express - words cannot explain our feelings.'\n\nSarim Ahmed, five, was tragically killed on Tuesday night after he was hit by a car while riding his bike home from Mosque with his father\n\nThe young boy had been riding his bike, which still had training wheels on it, home from daily prayers with his father when tragedy struck about 7.30pm\n\nMr Ahmed is unable to speak, the Imam said, and the boy's mother is still waiting for her son to come home.\n\n'The mother is only just realising it's happened, she says 'I don't believe this has happened', she is still waiting for him to come back,' he said.\n\nWitnesses tried to save the youngster, but he died in hospital a short time later.\n\nForensic crash investigators are still meticulously examining the scene but a spokeswoman for Queensland Police earlier said the crash appeared to be a 'tragic accident'.\n\n'It all appears very innocent - it looks as though a young boy was just riding a bike and was tragically hit,' she said.\n\nImam Salik said while he also believed the crash was a tragic accident, there were important lessons to be learned from it.\n\n'When someone is leaving the driveway or coming out - they should be watching their speed and looking,' he said.\n\n'It's something for not just that driver - but all of us to think about.\n\n'It is an accident in one sense, but in another it is a black dot on someone's heart forever.'", "description": "A community in northern Queensland has been left devastated after a five-year-old boy was killed as he rode his bicycle home from a local mosque on Tuesday night.", "authors": ["Hannah Moore For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/06/19475516-0-image-a-34_1570597794684.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
