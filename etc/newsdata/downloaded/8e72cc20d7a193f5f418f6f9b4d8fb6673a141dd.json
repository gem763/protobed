Facebook said in a blog post that it had investigated millions of apps and targeted those that had access to \u201clarge amounts of information\u201d or had the \u201cpotential to abuse\u201d its policies. The company said some of the apps were banned for inappropriately sharing users\u2019 data, the same violation of company policy that led to the Cambridge Analytica scandal. It added that its investigation isn\u2019t yet complete.\n\nBut the apps Facebook found as part of its internal probe may have posed a greater threat to users than the company portrayed.\n\nFacebook \u201cidentified approximately 10,000 applications that may also have misappropriated and/or misused consumers\u2019 personal data,\u201d according to court documents also unveiled Friday from Massachusetts\u2019 attorney general, which has been probing Facebook\u2019s data-collection practices for months. The court filings say 6,000 apps had a \u201clarge number of installing users\u201d and 2,000 exhibited behaviors that \u201cmay suggest data misuse.\u201d\n\nThe new revelations add to Facebook\u2019s mounting woes, illustrating that the company\u2019s efforts to improve its privacy practices remain a work in progress, compounding users\u2019 fears about the tech giant. Facebook\u2019s limited disclosures also are likely to rankle regulators, who have pushed the company to provide greater transparency and oversight.\n\nSen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said, \u201cThis wasn\u2019t some accident. Facebook put up a neon sign that said \u2018Free Private Data,\u2019 and let app developers have their fill of Americans\u2019 personal info. The FTC needs to hold Mark Zuckerberg personally responsible.\u201d\n\nFacebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg seeks to reassure wary lawmakers about Libra, elections in rare D.C. trip\n\n\u201cOur goal is to bring problems to light so we can address them quickly, stay ahead of bad actors and make sure that people can continue to enjoy engaging social experiences on Facebook while knowing their data will remain safe,\u201d said Ime Archibong, the company\u2019s vice president of product partnerships.\n\nSome of the apps were suspended before they had become available to mainstream users. Many were still in their testing phase at the time of suspension, Archibong said.\n\nBut Facebook appeared to know about some of the problematic apps months before it revealed its suspensions to the public. Since last year, the company had been locked in a legal war with the Massachusetts attorney general, a standoff that became public as a result of court documents unsealed Friday.\n\nMassachusetts\u2019s top enforcement official initially went to court to compel Facebook to turn over more information in connection with that probe, including the identification the roughly 10,000 apps may have misused data, according to its petition. Facebook, however, argued it is not required to identify any of them on grounds it is \u201cprotected attorney work product,\u201d the attorney general contends.\n\nThe company\u2019s admissions are likely to reignite calls for heightened regulation of Facebook, while infuriating critics in Congress who believe the social-networking giant has escaped tough punishment for its past privacy abuses. Lawmakers including Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) sharply challenged Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg over his company\u2019s data collection practices during private meetings in Washington this week.\n\n\u201cAnd now, barely 24 hrs after insisting to my face that Facebook takes personal privacy more seriously than anything else, FB reveals potentially massive data breaches,\u201d Hawley tweeted Friday.\n\nMark Zuckerberg says Facebook will audit thousands of apps after \u2018breach of trust\u2019\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission in July issued a record-breaking $5 billion fine and other penalties against Facebook for a series of privacy scandals, including its missteps related to Cambridge Analytica. The settlement ending the probe, which isn\u2019t final until it is approved in federal court, also required Facebook to submit to unprecedented government oversight of its privacy practices, while policing third-party apps more aggressively. But critics, including the FTC\u2019s Democratic commissioners, argued that it failed to hold Facebook fully accountable and did little to change the company\u2019s data collection practices.\n\n\u201cThe FTC was aware of a widespread problem involving app developers on Facebook\u2019s platform and that\u2019s why the agency obtained the relief it did,\u201d spokeswoman Juliana Gruenwald said in a statement. \u201cThe FTC did a thorough investigation that found Facebook was not adequately policing third party app developers.\u201d The agency declined to detail the exact evidence it obtained, including whether it probed the thousands of apps Facebook suspended Friday.\n\nOn Friday, Facebook again did not name the apps or developers it suspended. In May, the company sued the South Korean analytics firm Rankwave, saying the company had offered dozens of apps to people and businesses but had refused to cooperate in Facebook\u2019s investigation.\n\nDiscover something new:\n\nWe\u2019ve curated these stories to inspire your curiosity.\n\nUnderstanding your browser\u2019s privacy issues\n\nOur tech reviewer found more than 11,000 requests in a week for trackers from websites in Google Chrome.
