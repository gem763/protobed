We will not hesitate to take the necessary action to do so. Therefore, please only make claims directly through the official dedicated website: thomascook.caa.co.uk/refunds.\n\n\"Please help us to combat the risk of fraud by not submitting your details to any other website.\"\n\nSome of the concern is understood to have risen from a series of low-level claims, which often indicates fraud.\n\nAround 100,000 claims have been made since the website went live on Monday morning.\n\nIt was set up to enable people with Atol-protected bookings for Thomas Cook holidays due to begin after the firm collapsed on September 23 to obtain refunds.\n\nThis relates to more than 360,000 bookings covering trips set to be taken by 800,000 people.\n\nAtol-protected customers who were already abroad when Thomas Cook failed can also claim for the cost of replacing the parts of their holiday which were financially protected, or out-of-pocket expenses for delayed flights.\n\nThe CAA is aiming to pay refunds within 60 days of receiving a valid form and wants to crack down on fraudulent activity to avoid any delay.\n\nHutton said: \"Our focus is on getting money back to the right people as soon as possible and combating fraud in every way possible.\n\n\"We are informing the police of this activity and are implementing further verification checks to protect consumers. Where we see evidence of fraud, we will seek to prosecute any individuals or organisations involved.\n\n\"We will publish further updates as soon as more information is available, and we remain committed to processing refunds to Thomas Cook customers quickly and securely.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThis news comes after warnings on Monday that a suspicious Thomas Cook refund website was encouraging customers to hand over personal information in return for help with their refund claim.\n\nOne site people were warned about was \"thomascookrefunds.com\" - which the CAA said was not related to them and and warned people to only use the official version - https://thomascook.caa.co.uk/refunds/ .\n\nWhich? Travel editor Rory Boland said: \"Fraudsters circle like sharks around financial disasters, so people should be aware that there are likely to be fake refund websites set up to fleece Thomas Cook customers - and some of them may look very convincing.\n\n\u201cRefunds for Thomas Cook customers will either be handled by the Civil Aviation Authority from Monday (7 October) or by banks and card providers, so we would urge anyone waiting to claim their money back to ignore alternative websites and unsolicited calls or texts promising a refund.\"\n\n(Image: ARMANDO BABANI/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nMike Haley, chief executive of anti-fraud unit Cifas, said: \"Scammers are quick to react to opportunities such as the collapse of Thomas Cook, and we\u2019ve already seen reports that they are looking to take advantage of affected holiday makers.\n\n\"If you did book a holiday with Thomas Cook, be cautious if you receive unsolicited calls or emails from companies suggesting that you rebook your holiday through them, or offering you a holiday that\u2019s much cheaper than it should be.\n\n\"Remember never to give bank details or personal information such as passwords or PINs, or to transfer money quickly \u2013 especially if you are being put under pressure to do so.\n\n\"If you think you\u2019ve been a victim of fraud then speak to your bank immediately, and report it to Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040.\"", "description": "The Civil Aviation Authority has issued a new warning to customers of failed travel company Thomas Cook, as criminals attempt to rip them off as they seek refunds", "authors": ["James Andrews", "Image", "Julian Hamilton Daily Mirror", "Pa", "Armando Babani Epa-Efe Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20156087.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JHP_MDM_230919ThomasCook_04.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
