Moreover, \u201cin a country there will be peace if there is access to healthcare for all citizens.\u201d\n\nThe African politician was speaking in Madrid at a conference titled \u201cEncounter for Peace,\u201d organized by the Saint Egidio Catholic community.\n\nIn his address, Touad\u00e9ra underscored the need \u201cto renew the essential link between Africa and Europe,\u201d while also proposing that disarmament, universal health care, and the abolition of the death penalty are essential conditions to achieving peace.\n\n\u201cWhat Europe has done is today a dream in Africa,\u201d Touad\u00e9ra said. \u201cPeace without borders is not just a beautiful title but a beautiful perspective to look toward.\u201d\n\nThe Central African Republic has experienced an ongoing civil war since 2012, which shows little sign of abating, and tensions are compounded by religious strife between Muslim S\u00e9l\u00e9ka fighters and Christian anti-balaka militias.\n\n\u201cThe Central African Republic is a house in which many weapons have entered, so now we are going to launch a disarmament program,\u201d Touad\u00e9ra said, insisting that \u201cthe blood of our people spilled unjustly urges us not to make the same mistake in the future.\u201d\n\nThe African president also stressed that war is avoidable but that peace demands a concerted effort from everyone.\n\n\u201cWar and violence are not an inevitable destiny,\u201d he said, but peace can never be taken for granted but requires ongoing vigilance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like building a house that always needs maintenance because otherwise it would be at the mercy of the wind,\u201d he said.\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "The president of the war-torn Central African Republic warned Sunday that stability in Europe is conditioned upon stability in Africa.", "authors": ["Thomas D.
