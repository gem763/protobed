But to go that distance, they have to get halfway there, then half the remaining distance, then half again, and half again. The runner can get incredibly close but never cross the finish line. Instead, they\u2019re stuck reaching an infinity of halfway points.\n\nThis little parable is my new default response when somebody asks me if the iPad can really be your main computer. Of course it can. But if you measure all of the different things you might need it to do, you will never get there. That\u2019s the story of iPadOS: it gets us halfway closer to the iPad being able to replace your laptop.\n\nIf you already thought the iPad could be your main computer, iPadOS makes it 50 percent easier to do the things you want. If you thought there\u2019s no way the iPad could do what you really need, iPadOS will get 50 percent of the way toward changing your mind.\n\nOur review of Apple iPadOS 13 Verge Score 7 out of 10 Good Stuff Browser compatible with more websites\n\nProper filesystem with USB support\n\nSidecar Bad Stuff Still buggy\n\nMultitasking can be confusing\n\nStill no multiuser support\n\nIf you have no interest in turning your iPad into something more than what it already is, I have good news: with iPadOS, it remains a great couch and travel device that serves as a companion to your phone and laptop. Beyond a preponderance of bugs that are getting squashed with a succession of rapidly released post-launch updates, there\u2019s very little to complain about if you use your iPad for basic stuff.\n\niPadOS remains fast and easy to understand, with a huge set of apps that are optimized for touch and large screens. That all sounds like a pretty low bar, but it\u2019s still one that competing operating systems have consistently failed to clear.\n\nHere are some things I think everybody will enjoy:\n\nThe new Safari browser works better on many more websites\n\nA new home screen. You can set it to have a higher density of apps in the grid so you don\u2019t have to page around as much. You can also pin your widget bar to the home screen, which seems like a petty thing, but it really does change my experience in a meaningful way. Having my calendar \u201cjust there\u201d whenever I go home is a huge help.\n\nThe floating keyboard. You can pinch on the keyboard to turn it into something that\u2019s the size of an iPhone keyboard. You can then move it anywhere you like on the screen and just use one thumb to swipe on it to type. (It\u2019s still buggy for me in iPadOS 13.1.2, jumping around the screen for some reason.)\n\nSidecar. This allows you to use your iPad as a secondary display for macOS Catalina computers. It works wired or wirelessly. If you\u2019re a Mac user, it\u2019s extremely convenient to have a second monitor hanging around if you need it.\n\nSafari. Apple changed Safari so that it would tell websites it is a Mac instead of an iPad. The result is that you are more likely to get the \u201cfull\u201d desktop version of a lot of sites. This sometimes results in weirdness because Apple has to translate your taps and swipes into the mouse cursor actions some desktop websites expect. But overall, it\u2019s a huge win.\n\nSlideover. If you\u2019ve only ever used one app at a time on your iPad, I encourage you to give Slideover a try. Drag an icon up from the dock until it looks like a tall floating window. You can have several of them in a stack that you can swipe through just like you do on an iPhone, and it\u2019s easy to swipe them all away off to the side of your screen. It\u2019s super convenient for lightweight apps that you only need to use briefly, like Music or Messages.\n\nDark mode. Here\u2019s where Apple\u2019s app ecosystem really shines: even though iPadOS and iOS 13 have only been officially out for a short time, a large number of popular apps have already updated to support Dark mode. I also like that you can set Dark mode to work on a schedule, turning it on or off with the sun or your own custom times.\n\nBut what if you want to use the iPad to its fullest as your only machine? Let\u2019s get into it.\n\nLast year, Apple introduced an iPad Pro that was significantly more powerful and impressive than any iPad we\u2019d seen before. That made it all the more frustrating when we tried to make the software accomplish seemingly basic computing tasks because the hardware was clearly capable of so much more.\n\niPadOS is explicitly designed to ease that frustration. In some ways, its introduction felt like a point-by-point response to our review. I\u2019ve been using it since the first beta and have found that I need to pull out a \u201creal\u201d laptop like a MacBook, Windows PC, or even a Chromebook less often.\n\nThe Files app is much more powerful now\n\nIt hasn\u2019t gotten all the way there for me, though. It\u2019s the iPadOS paradox: when you measure the individual needs each person has to make it their main computer, it always comes up just short. For me, it\u2019s the new fancy \u201cdesktop-class\u201d Safari. It just happens to work worse on one specific website that I need to use every day. (That would be Chorus, the software that runs our website.) For you, it will be something else.\n\nBut zoom out, and just watch people as they do something today that wasn\u2019t possible six months ago. My colleague Chris Welch built a special shortcut macro for watermarking images. Once Adobe updates its Lightroom app to directly import images, it will mean my entire workflow can happen on the iPad with only a few hacky workarounds \u2014 whereas before, it didn\u2019t work at all.\n\nShortcuts can fill in a lot of gaps, and I\u2019ve been amazed by what some people are able to do with them. (Just look at this massive repository maintained by MacStories.) But I am glad Apple has realized that Shortcuts isn\u2019t a substitute for simply making the OS more capable for people who don\u2019t want to use Google to hunt down macros to get their work done.\n\nThat\u2019s one reason why I\u2019m so pleased that the filesystem on iPadOS no longer has one hand tied behind its back. Working with files is still a little \u201ciPad-y\u201d to me. There are weird corners where opening or saving a file is odd. But they\u2019re few and far between, and a lot of it is just getting used to the iPad way of doing things. The Files app on iPadOS is more than I hoped for or expected from Apple on the iPad.\n\nThe lack of multiuser support on the iPad is ridiculous\n\nIncreasingly, I\u2019m finding that the only reason I can\u2019t get something specific done on an iPad is because the app I want just hasn\u2019t been brought up to par with its desktop equivalent. The reason used to be that Apple was philosophically against allowing it, so we\u2019re making real progress.\n\nApple\u2019s biggest miss in iPadOS is that it still doesn\u2019t allow for multiuser support on the iPad, more than 13 versions into the OS. Apple\u2019s television OS supports multiple users, yet the iPad does not. It\u2019s flat-out embarrassing that this isn\u2019t an option yet. It\u2019s punitive to families that don\u2019t want to have to buy a whole other device for their kids.\n\nThe way text manipulation works on iPadOS is a series of overthought and overwrought changes that aim for the stars and reach the ditch. The three-finger gestures for cut / copy / paste are frankly bad. They\u2019ve improved over the course of the beta, but even on the official release, I find them difficult to use. Fortunately, the three-finger tap to bring up a text editing menu is better.\n\nCursor placement is similarly too clever by half. I never know if I\u2019m moving the cursor or selecting text or what when I interact with text on the screen. As of this writing, some apps like Google Docs don\u2019t even support Apple\u2019s new cursor placement code, and I\u2019m weirdly grateful because I think it\u2019s bad.\n\nWe\u2019re deep in nitpick land, but nitpick land is where people live when they\u2019re trying to decide if they can truly trust a computer to be the only thing they toss into their bag. It\u2019s less about capabilities and more about trust \u2014 and trust is built with consistency.\n\nThat brings me, of course, to the new multitasking features on iPadOS.\n\nIf you\u2019re not familiar, Apple has added a lot of new capabilities to iPadOS. There are lots of different modalities for app windows now, and it can be a little overwhelming. So here are the main things to know about multitasking on iPadOS:\n\nThe aforementioned Slideover windows, which you can stack\n\nA single app can spawn multiple windows\n\nYou can switch between a usual Expos\u00e9 view that shows all of your app spaces and also an app-specific Expos\u00e9 view that shows only the windows from a specific app\n\nYou can drag certain things on the screen to turn them into new windows, like links or individual notes\n\nThere are little bars at the tops of apps in split screen or Slideover, and you can grab them to move windows around\n\nAs I\u2019ve written before, making sense of all these options is not easy. It is easy to feel unmoored, unsure of where your stuff is. When you tap on an icon, why does something different than what you expected pop up? Is it because there are multiple windows? Is it because you left an app in Slideover, and they launch full screen if you open them from the home screen? Even after months of using iPadOS daily, I still have seemingly random things happen when I try to launch an app.\n\nThere are so many ways to make windows now that it\u2019s easy to forget what state they were in\n\nAt first, I assumed the problem was me, that I was stuck in the old desktop way of thinking. But more and more, I think the problem isn\u2019t me. It\u2019s how multitasking works on iPadOS. Even more than that, I think maybe it\u2019s not really a problem at all.\n\nMost operating systems piggyback off of a way you already understand the physical world to help you figure out the digital world. Sometimes these metaphors go way too far. For example, Microsoft Bob famously worked by forcing you to click around a representation of an office.\n\nUsually, it\u2019s simpler. At its root, a desktop OS works by letting you place things in space. You move windows around, and they stay where you put them. You can make them bigger or smaller or stack them on top of each other like they\u2019re pieces of paper.\n\nNone of that makes sense for a small screen, like the one on your phone. So instead, your phone uses a time metaphor. When you multitask, it presents you with a stack of your most recently used apps, arranged in reverse-chronological order.\n\nWhat makes iPadOS confusing is that it mixes time and space metaphors. Sometimes, your apps are located in space, like the ones you\u2019ve split screened or scurried away in Slideover mode. But then your apps are also presented in reverse-chronological order when you go to the multitasking view.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s possible to wrap our minds around something that blends time and space \u2014 just ask Einstein \u2014 but it\u2019s not easy. I just wish the whole thing was more comprehensible. And even though I know it was me who lost my windows and not technically the OS, the effect is the same. Since you can\u2019t consistently know what will happen when you try to find or open a window, it leads you to subconsciously distrust the whole thing.\n\nFortunately, it\u2019s fast and easy to reorganize your workspace when you get lost\n\nBut after using the iPad for a while, here is why I think this problem is not a problem at all: iPadOS is fast. Apps launch very quickly on the whole, and they also do a fairly good job of saving their state when they\u2019re closed. The result is that even though your windows might not be in the state you expect them to be, it\u2019s super easy to set up a new workspace.\n\nIn the video for this review, I joked that you should think of your iPadOS windows like they\u2019re part of a Buddhist sand mandala: beautiful and meaningful but ephemeral. Don\u2019t worry about being lost; instead, accept the transient and temporary nature of digital things.\n\nIt\u2019s a joke, but it\u2019s not. Just don\u2019t overthink how the windowing system works on iPadOS. Over time, you\u2019ll get a feel for it even though you probably won\u2019t ever really know exactly where (or when) your windows are at any given time.\n\nThis is the first time Apple gave the iPad\u2019s OS its own name, separate from iOS on the iPhone. I\u2019m not particularly interested in the semantics of iPadOS or the branding discussion. What I really care about is whether Apple can find a way to open it up to allow users to take full advantage of the iPad\u2019s powerful hardware without overcomplicating it for everybody.\n\nApple finally had the courage to make the iPad a little complicated\n\nI think iPadOS has a different learning curve than what we\u2019re used to. It\u2019s not a straight line, but it seesaws between shallow and steep. It is easier than nearly any other computer in history to start using. But when you start trying to get the same sorts of capabilities out of the iPad that you\u2019d expect from a high-end laptop, that curve hockeysticks.\n\nI\u2019m weirdly proud of Apple for having the courage to present power users with that difficulty curve spike. Apple used to be so worried that people would get lost that it kept the iPad working like a big iPhone for a really long time. Now, it\u2019s not afraid to just make things complicated and assume people who need it will figure it out.\n\nThat sure sounds like a computer to me.", "description": "If you already thought the iPad could be your main computer, iPadOS makes it 50 percent easier to do the things you want.
