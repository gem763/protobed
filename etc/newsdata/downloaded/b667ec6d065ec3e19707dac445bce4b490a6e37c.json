Kim Kardashian and Kendall Jenner were part of the on-going and seemingly endless parade of presenters at this year\u2019s Emmy Awards ceremonies, but it was an ill-timed quip and possibly a stitch-up of Hollywood-proportions that managed to yoink the limelight away from the high-powered pair.\n\nOn-stage to present the award for Outstanding Reality Competition Program \u2013 an award won by RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race because hell yeah it was \u2013 Kardashian and Jenner may have unwittingly read out a joke at their own expense without realising what they were doing until it was too late.\n\nReading the teleprompter text written for them by Emmys producers, Kardashian noted \u201cOur family knows firsthand how truly compelling television comes from real people just being themselves.\u201d\n\nJenner then finished the line off, asserting bone seriously, \u201cTelling their stories unfiltered and unscripted.\u201d\n\nThat caused the packed Microsoft Theatre crowd to erupt in laughter as the pair quite clearly shuffled about awkwardly, apparently unaware they\u2019d just landed arguably one of the jokes of the night.\n\nKim Kardashian West and Kendall Jenner got bullied on the #Emmys2019. Why people are laughing at them? So rude and disrespectful. These people are still not over the fact that the Kardashians are succeding? pic.twitter.com/81kOMyetcS \u2014 superficial doll????

That\u2019s a joke someone wrote for the two of them that they\u2019ve glossed over without realising what it is.\n\nThe only possible way that plays out the way it did is if everyone just assumed they would read that as a joke and the only two people to not immediately recognise it as one were Kim and Kendall themselves, or that\u2019s a deeply shifty stitch-up from a probably quite-fired writer/producer.\n\nEither way, it\u2019s a hell of a moment for a whole mess of reasons. Most of them funny.\n\nMost of them.", "description": "Kim Kardashian & Kendall Jenner either just accidentally roasted themselves or got monumentally stitched-up at the Emmys.
