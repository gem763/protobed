Although Chile\u2019s President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era has now suspended the fare hike, the protests grew, fueled by wider complaints about the rising cost of living and social and economic inequality. Pi\u00f1era has declared a state of emergency, including overnight curfews, as some demonstrations have devolved into looting and arson. Authorities say 15 people have lost their lives so far amid clashes with riot police and chaotic scenes in damaged and burning buildings.", "description": "Widespread anger over the high cost of living and social inequality in Chile has sparked days of sometimes violent protest.", "authors": ["Alan Taylor"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/photo/2019/10/chile-tk/c01_RTS2S1J1-1/facebook.jpg?1571770549", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
