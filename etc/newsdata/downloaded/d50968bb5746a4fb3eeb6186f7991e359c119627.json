It was a trip that included a close encounter with the unpredictability of the Trump White House, a foreign policy pivot, and a backlash about a lack of climate policy action. Guardian Australia\u2019s political editor, Katharine Murphy, travelled, with the prime minister. Here is what she witnessed:\n\nWashington\n\nWe\u2019ve been positioned at the White House since 5am, watching the sun creep over the American capital. Security is as laborious as you\u2019d expect. Dogs sniff bags, then the secret service guys have a good look, passports are collected, checked and returned, White House passes and pins are distributed, and then at last we clear the metal detectors. Eventually we make it to the press briefing room, the small blue one, famous through several presidential administrations but now abandoned by Donald Trump. The modest proportions don\u2019t fit his presidency. Now it\u2019s just a transit zone.\n\nWe are greeted by a blond woman in a broad-brimmed hat. June, a self-described southern belle, is receiving visitors in the briefing room, although it\u2019s not clear why. She identifies herself as a fellow scribe working for Christian radio and television in Nashville. When she\u2019s not reporting on the Trump White House, she\u2019s rallying Christians for the president. This seems something of a line cross for a reporter with White House press accreditation \u2013 but we\u2019ve been on the premises for about 10 minutes and it\u2019s clear that we\u2019re not in Kansas any more.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Donald and Melania Trump welcome Scott and Jenny Morrison on the south lawn with full military honours. Photograph: MAI/REX/Shutterstock\n\nOn the other side of the building, visitors are streaming across the South Lawn to grab prime positions to witness The Donald receiving The Scott at the official welcome. Flags, American and Australian, are held aloft on a glorious summery day. Eventually we are permitted to wander down to the lawn as well.\n\nThe Donald\u2019s grass is lush and slightly dewy, making me regret my choice of footwear. The daylight is now dazzling but the bucolic scene is disturbed by Austin rebuking Steve in the media pen. The confrontation happens just before the splendidly peppy pipe band strides across the lawn for the ceremonial welcome.\n\nI\u2019ve never met Austin before this moment but he looks about 30, buttoned down and watchful as a raptor \u2013 a White House wrangler who looks as though he hasn\u2019t sat down, eaten anything apart from a protein bar, or slept more than four hours straight a night since early infancy. Steve has transgressed and Austin convenes a short, sharp show trial in front of me. I\u2019ve nabbed a prime position on the fence in the media pen right in front of the entrance, and I don\u2019t intend to move unless the secret service guy standing beside me gets feisty.\n\n\u201cYou left the media area to make a call,\u201d Austin says, voice appropriately low so as not to disdain the Wonderful Occasion swelling around us. Steve is older than his accuser and possesses the rumpled look of a longtime print or news wire reporter. I\u2019ve never seen Steve before either, but he\u2019s clearly part of the White House press pool and looks like a man disinclined to small talk. My guess, from my quick scan of the body language, the suppressed inner sigh, is that Steve has seen a number of Austins in his reporting lifetime, perhaps a small production line of them, and is not much gripped by this power play.\n\nSteve says nothing. Austin persists. In a minute we are going to go full Veep. \u201cThe secret service told me you left the media area to make a call \u2013 is this correct?\u201d Steve, at the end of his tolerance for J\u2019Accuse now, delivers his mic drop. \u201cYah,\u201d he says. \u201cOne of the secret service guys held back the rope so I could get out to make the call. I needed to take the call.\u201d I suspect Austin doesn\u2019t really know where to take this from here. The aide returns to the front of the fence, shoulders back, eyes front. It\u2019s showtime.\n\nTrump strides out of the White House with Melania. From my vantage point they look like a pair of Easter Island statues. This is my first encounter with the current leader of the free world and my curiosity is intense. How will Trump look uncut?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Donald and Melania Trump arrive to greet Scott Morrison. Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAP\n\nWill he look how he does on television, with that weird affect \u2013 the pursed lips, narrowed eyes and nose and chin set to an upward inflection, indicative of defiance and displeasure? Or is this a posture he adopts only after he pulls on the presidential onesie every day and heads for Fox News, purring \u201cready for my close-up Mr DeMille\u201d?\n\nI discover this is how Trump looks all the time, or at least all the time he is in open space. He\u2019s striding to the podium with exactly that look, with Melania, who is a dignified presence yet strangely devoid of life force. Perhaps she laughs and sings and dances in her track pants like no one is watching in her private domain but, in public, Mrs Trump looks like a perfectly proportioned doll in a doll\u2019s house.\n\nOver the next little while, Trump will lavish praise on Melania for her crack presidential spouse skills. The first lady, Trump reports over and over during the course of Friday, \u201cworked so hard\u201d on the table settings for the state dinner, pondering every detail. The flowers, the centrepieces, so wonderful, so beautiful. The best table decorations anyone has ever seen.\n\nIt\u2019s hard for me to imagine the reality of the first lady\u2019s life, what it must be like to agonise over centrepieces for state dinners amid the sound and fury of her husband\u2019s bitterly contested presidency. Given her reserved public presence, it feels like an impertinence to wonder.\n\nThere\u2019s no time for whimsy in any case, because the Morrisons are now on the premises, ready for their induction into the Trumpiverse. In comparison with the Trumps, Scott and Jenny Morrison, from the Sutherland shire, Australia \u2013 more latterly of Kirribilli House \u2013 look like a well-to-do couple from the suburbs. They are earthed in this big moment, respectful of the tradition they are now associated with, the tradition of Washington\u2019s special friends being drawn to the nation\u2019s bosom.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Scott Morrison\u2019s arrival in Washington marks the second state visit of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. Photograph: Tasos Katopodis/ABACA POOL/EPA\n\nPresumably they are buzzing with anticipation and anxiety, given that the unofficial White House weather forecast for Friday is clear skies, a light breeze and a high probability of catastrophic cyclone once their delegation reaches the Oval Office. Looking normal in this environment takes some doing, but the Morrisons manage.\n\nThe troops march, and are duly inspected; the visitors clutch their flags, which flutter gaily in the breeze. The anthems are played. The two couples appear content with each other and the scripted remarks they share with each other and the crowd. Just before the conclusion of the formalities, Austin is back working the fence line to move us, lickety split, to the holding pen outside the Oval Office. Fortunately, the war with Steve seems to have subsided.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Trump and Morrison review the troops during an official arrival ceremony. Photograph: Joshua Roberts/Reuters\n\nI wash up near Steve and the other White House wire reporters. One of the group explains to me that Steve is the man if they want to get a question to the president. Trump will answer Steve. It\u2019s unclear why that\u2019s the case, and I don\u2019t ask.\n\nShe also gives us tremendously helpful advice: Trump will be on for a rave when we get in there. We are surprised by this. Our assumption was we\u2019d be in and out in a matter of minutes. Our river guide shakes her head. Trump, she says, is in an expansive frame of mind. Best we prepare some questions. She also predicts that Trump will struggle to understand our accents. If he doesn\u2019t understand, the president will say: \u201cSay it.\u201d This means ask the question again, she says.\n\nI assume this is some sort of weird in-joke until I hear Trump do just that. \u201cSay it,\u201d Trump says, narrowing his eyes and curling his lip. It\u2019s utterly peculiar, but it\u2019s an earworm. Once you hear it, it\u2019s hard to get the locution out of your brain. Say it.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Trump reacts to questions during a joint press conference with Morrison. Photograph: Sipa USA/SIPA USA/PA Images\n\nThe door of the Oval Office swings open and we are thrust into pure madness. The media scrum feeds off the static electricity in the room. It heaves like a wave. Our questions crash on the shore. Thud, thud, thud. Mr President. The Americans in the pool want to know about Joe Biden and the Ukraine controversy \u2013 a story that will spiral towards impeachment during the week of our visit.\n\nNo American journalist gives a crap about Australia, and Morrison, and the second state visit to Washington of this febrile presidency. Fun fact: Emmanuel Macron, back when he imagined he had a talent for Trump whispering, was the first to be afforded the honour. But who cares? Conventions are devalued in the coarseness of politics in 2019. No one pretends to care. Everyone just has to emerge with what they need.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Journalists crowd around Morrison and Trump during their press conference. Photograph: REX/Shutterstock\n\nOnce we realise this is going to be nuts \u2013 a small blazing blitzkrieg at the seat of American power with no rules of engagement \u2013 Australian reporters also start hurling questions across a range of topics. Trump looks delighted by the disorder. It\u2019s where he thrives. Morrison shifts in his seat.\n\nThe president lays into the media. We are hopeless, finished, friendless. But Mr President, what about the call? Did you speak to Ukraine\u2019s new president? It was a beautiful call. Next question. Say it.\n\nThe Morrisons sit tight as the stiff westerly blows. The prime minister isn\u2019t visibly alarmed but he\u2019s hyper alert. Jenny Morrison composes her face into a placid mask \u2013 until Trump suddenly raises the spectre of nuclear weapons and Iran. I catch her eye at that moment and she startles, ever so slightly. Her eyes, to me, say \u201chelp me\u201d. I catch Morrison\u2019s eye a couple of times and the corners of his mouth crinkle.\n\nI am a spectator at this circus but the prime minister isn\u2019t permitted the luxury of distancing. Morrison is a peer of the president, a leader of a respectable middle power who has chosen, as the New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd puts it with just the right squeeze of lemon during our visit, \u201cto play ball with the Mad King\u201d \u2013 to give friendless Donald a friend.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u201cIt was a beautiful call.\u201d Trump responds to journalists asking about his call with the president of Ukraine. Photograph: REX/Shutterstock\n\nThe prime minister, unlike us, enjoys the benefit of knowing what Trump really thinks on a range of fronts; he has that baseline to keep him tethered through the rhetorical turbulence. But back in the nosebleed seats we lack those insights. During our 33 minutes in the Oval Office, Australian journalists are on a rollercoaster, hanging upside down, while the president indulges a dialogue with himself about whether to launch a military strike against Iran, or whether restraint is the better course. He lands eventually at restraint but the disorientation is so profound it takes me a while to process that\u2019s where we\u2019ve landed.\n\nEventually Trump stops feeling all the feelings and we are herded out. I ask one of my fellow travelling reporters whether the president just raised the prospect of nuclear attack, because I fear the sleep deprivation might be messing with my cognition. He\u2019s as knocked around as I am. Yes, he thinks so, but he needs to listen to the recording. TV reporters are wondering out loud how on earth they are going to distil what just happened into a package. How do you do this in a minute and a half?\n\nAt the height of my disorientation, I spot Paul Murray from Sky\u2019s Fox News lite after-dark crew at the back of the room. As we are guided out, Morrison beckons Murray forward and introduces him to the president. This introduction yields an exclusive interview with Trump which includes the simpering question: \u201cWhat do you want to say to your many Australian supporters who wish you nothing but the best in November 2020?\u201d I suppose it could have been what was his favourite colour.\n\nStephen Mayne (@MayneReport) Paul Murray gets his exclusive with \u2066@realDonaldTrump\u2069 but talk about not asking the hard questions. pic.twitter.com/5QnxMW5cHh\n\nThe madness persists. The day ends with wranglers trying to facilitate some access to the state dinner, which is al fresco, in the Rose Garden. As we are herded through the South Lawn accompanied by the lilt of violins serenading guests and the murmur of clinking glassware and small talk, a secret service guy in night goggles, with foliage in his helmet, suddenly materialises from the bushes and sprints across in front of us.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mr. and Mrs. Trump meet with Mr. and Mrs. Morrison as they attend a state dinner. Photograph: Pool/ABACA/PA Images\n\nShortly after this our White House wrangler declares this walk off the record, which generates considerable confusion among the scribes. How can a walk to a pool position be off the record? Which bit is off the record? This walk never happened? How do we explain our capacity to bear witness to events at the state dinner? Did we parachute in?\n\nWe resolve not to overthink this and press on, and eventually get close enough to see the guests drifting around the Rose Garden: the Australian billionaire box maker Anthony Pratt is hard to miss with his shock of orange hair; the younger Murdochs are there, Lachlan and Sarah, I reckon I\u2019ve spotted the mining magnates Twiggy Forrest and the generally reclusive Gina Rinehart, who appears to be floating. I rub my eyes, fearing a fancy. Perhaps Rinehart is not floating, more likely I\u2019m swaying, peering through a large shrub, sleep deprived and smacking the mosquitos that threaten my ankles, questioning my life choices.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Fox CEO and co-chairman of News Corp Lachlan Murdoch (L) and Sarah Murdoch arrive for the state dinner. Photograph: Ron Sachs/POOL/EPA\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hancock Prospecting chairwoman Georgina Rinehart arrives for the state dinner. Photograph: Ron Sachs/POOL/EPA\n\nI see Rinehart again the next day, floating (she is definitely wafting like a cloud, because I know I\u2019m no longer swaying) into a soiree at the Australian ambassador Joe Hockey\u2019s residence, in a white dress with sequins and what appear to be pom poms trailing at the back. Morrison\u2019s old chief of staff and new department head, Phil Gaetjens, by contrast, is wandering around in a Wallabies rugby jersey with cut-off sleeves.\n\nWhile the grandees mingle, Rinehart sets up court with her entourage in a shaded corner of the garden on what looks like a sedan chair, but is actually just a garden settee. The visual cue is Ms Rinehart is receiving guests, as long as they are not journalists. The media mogul Kerry Stokes is also said to be mingling but I don\u2019t clap eyes on him.\n\nIn Hockey\u2019s garden I strike up a conversation with an expatriate pub owner who is now the mayor of Annapolis and is campaigning to tighten gun control. Gavin Buckley, formerly from Western Australia, is an avuncular Democrat at a Republican knees-up, a fish out of water who can\u2019t quite believe his luck. Buckley tells me he hugged Hockey for the great honour bestowed upon him.\n\nThe whole scene is F Scott Fitzgerald meets the pre-woke capitalism of the 1980s, and the humidity is sending us all bonkers. Servers hand out party pies and sausages with disturbing names like cheese and Vegemite, and bald men in linen sports jackets compete for shade. One of our travelling media pack then proceeds to conduct a mock interview of a new magnolia tree which has just been planted to celebrate the Morrison state visit. With the Magnolia, this is Brett Mason, SBS News. It\u2019s a joke, hijinks to help us stay alert when we are hitting that hour of the day when jetlag threatens to take your legs out. But we\u2019ve crossed the sense barrier and we haven\u2019t even hit the Trump rally. What could possibly go wrong?\n\nOhio\n\nIt\u2019s a voyage with billionaires, this American excursion with Morrison. I confess that this is new territory for me. The cashed-up and politically connected drifted past us during the pomp and circumstance in Washington, and now we are closing in on Anthony Pratt as we speed to Wapakoneta, first airborne and then jammed in Morrison\u2019s motorcade with police cars racing past, sirens blaring, to stop traffic on the freeway.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Crowds await the opening of Pratt Paper Plant in Wapakoneta, Ohio. Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAP\n\nMorrison, who will be thriving on all this hard work and energised by the thought that he might be called upon to pull things back from the brink, is upbeat during a quick amble down the back of the plane. He wonders what we have made of the Oval Office. \u201cTwo words,\u201d I shoot back. \u201cHow good?\u201d\n\nThe gaggle of Morrison staff tumbling in and out of black vans in the motorcades, and standing glassy eyed at midnight in hotel foyers, clutching their phones and wondering what day it is, look in reasonable shape despite the fact that most of them won\u2019t have slept much. Team Morrison and senior bureaucrats drift in and out of our orbit, leaving us mostly in the hands of a crack team of departmental minders. These officials, particularly the logistics people, are always the unsung heroes of these trips. The wranglers on this trip are outstanding. The pace is punishing \u2013 at times it feels like early in the Kevin Rudd era. The transitions are down to the second and there are no screw-ups, at least none that are visible to us.\n\nOne of Morrison\u2019s press secretaries, Nick Creevey, has joined us for the sprint to Wapakoneta on the commandeered Dayton school bus. We\u2019re all practising the pronunciation of Wapakoneta. Wah-pa, Christ, how do you spell this bloody place again? Katina Curtis, the meticulously prepared Australian Associated Press reporter, is patient with the spelling drills. Hey Katina. How do you spell \u2026\n\nThere are few female journalists on this trip, and overseas voyages, in my experience, tend to take on an Aussie barbecue dimension. This is a generalisation but, as generalisations go, not an unfair one. Male correspondents largely herd together, socialise together, crack jokes together, reinforce one another\u2019s insights, and women run on a parallel track. It\u2019s a strange dynamic at times; stranger because the blokes who engage in the behaviour would be entirely unconscious that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. It\u2019s just custom, or muscle memory. Hashtag road trip. Hashtag dudes.\n\nDayton to Wapakoneta is flat and rural. The billboards we pass are a combination of fast food temptations and Jesus Christ, saving the born and unborn. I\u2019m both fascinated to learn what we are driving into and mildly apprehensive, given that Trump rallies can be hostile to the media covering them, and hackles in the base must be raised by the latest mainstream media pursuit over Trump and Ukraine. The president loves a persecution narrative with him at the centre of it \u2013 it fuels the righteous rage of his supporters. Everyone can be aggrieved together.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Trump supporters await the arrival of their hero in Wapakoneta. Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAP\n\nNobody in the PM\u2019s entourage expresses any apprehension at all about Ohio, not even a hint of it. But my instinct suggests they are also worried about the unknown. There are risks in the look of this thing. Should Morrison really be at a Trump rally (even though the Ohio event is more complicated than a 2020 campaign whistle stop with Morrison attached). Apart from the possibility of any bizarre, indefensible off-piste business, there is also the risk of Trump banging on and on and on. It is entirely possible scheduled remarks at the opening of a box factory could stretch into a Castroesque monologue that kills our logistics stone dead. Morrison\u2019s crew had expected the Oval Office encounter to last for a few minutes and instead it stretched, putting them behind for the remainder of the day.\n\nI filed a column describing our arrival into Wapakoneta and the rapturous welcome the locals gave Trump, but there were some other memorable moments behind the scenes. When Trump and his entourage finally blow in to town in a blaze of police sirens and secret service agents, we are reunited with the same White House press pool we met on Friday outside the Oval, grinding through another event. I clock Steve in the distance, kicking on.\n\nTrump engages Pratt the minute he\u2019s in the factory. The two billionaires exchange lavish compliments as they amble towards the gaggle of reporters. Presumably the box maker is explaining recycling to Trump as they go. Rubbish in, box out, cash in.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Trump and Morrison with the chairman of Pratt Industries, Anthony Prat. Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters\n\nThe president then tracks towards where the journalists are corralled behind the fence, straining to get an iPhone snap for Twitter. He\u2019s looking for Steve, the Trump whisperer, because he\u2019s got exciting information to share. \u201cSo that\u2019s 100% recycled paper into a really, fine finished product,\u201d the president enthuses on the fence line. \u201cIt\u2019s really amazing, Steve. They start off with \u2026\u201d Trump pauses delicately \u2026 \u201ccan I use the word \u2018garbage\u2019?\u201d\n\nPratt is entirely comfortable with the word. Pratt Industries, Ohio, is proudly euphemism-free. Trump picks up the story: \u201cThey start off with waste, garbage, and they end up building it into a \u2013 making it into really great cardboard and paper.\u201d\n\n\u201cA hundred per cent of the plant\u201d. As I mentioned earlier, I\u2019ve never seen Steve before these couple of brief encounters, he is a complete stranger to me, and what follows is pure speculation, but I\u2019m going to hazard a guess that he knows what recycling is. I reckon Steve does know about it.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest In the last presidential contest, Anthony Pratt bet $100,000 on Trump to win against Hillary Clinton. Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTrump is another story. Possibly this impromptu recycling-for-dummies tutorial is just the president being performatively didactic, or perhaps he is inoculating himself from cable TV hysterics who might associate reuse with One World Government. Or perhaps this is the first time in his life he\u2019s encountered recycling.\n\nTrump continues to roll this newfangled Pratt magic around in his mind, and engage journalists enthusiastically along the fence line. \u201cThat\u2019s really some equipment. The finest equipment in the world. And more and more people are going this way.\n\n\u201cNormally, you take down trees and you make the paper. In this case, Anthony does 90, 95% out of waste, out of garbage, and they make incredible final product through a very \u2013 through really a very \u2013 a really costly but efficient process.\u201d He could be describing the interface between tycoons and politicians but let\u2019s not be caustic or labour the metaphor. We need to continue with our story.\n\nEmboldened by this level of engagement from the president, one of the Australian journalists calls out: \u201cDo you want more businessmen like Mr Pratt, Mr President?\u201d. Trump is confused. Say it. (Implied, not stated: louder visiting freak, take two.) Say it.\n\nScott Morrison praises Donald Trump's political priorities Read more\n\n\u201cDo you want more businessmen like Mr Pratt to invest in America like he has?\u201d Trump narrows his eyes. \u201cYeah, well, we have some good ones. But this man is number one in Australia, they say.\u201d Number one of course, being the highest Trump accolade. That and apex predator.\n\nPratt returns the favour before we leave America. He tells the Australian newspaper Trump is going to win in the 2020 election. Lest this just appear guesswork, or another shovel load of obsequiousness, history shows that Pratt has a sharp eye. In the last presidential contest the billionaire box maker bet $100,000 on Trump to win against Hillary Clinton.\n\nAsked whether he\u2019d make the same bet again, Pratt reports that he\u2019s raised the stakes. There is now $2bn on the table \u2013 investments in new paper operations in the US. \u201cI told the president we want to continue to invest and fulfil our pledge,\u201d Pratt tells the paper. \u201cIt was very gracious of him to come to our Ohio plant opening. I was fortunate to spend some time with him. He was as gracious as ever.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Trump departs after the tour and plant opening with Morrison and Pratt. Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters\n\nGracious indeed. As another wealthy entrepreneur, Malcolm Turnbull, was once fond of saying. What. A. Time. To. Be. Alive.\n\nNew York\n\nBy the time we roll out of Chicago \u2013 a whistle stop characterised by a serious foreign policy pivot from Morrison, and an unfortunate photo opportunity in front of a McDonald\u2019s smart board that built a visual bridge to Engadine for people familiar with the infamous internet meme (let\u2019s just leave it at that) \u2013 and on to New York, the drumbeat is cacophonous, literally and figuratively.\n\nIt is leader\u2019s week at the UN general assembly, and the area around the headquarters is locked down. The streets teem with protesters and delegates, and groups of Africans gather on Forty-fourth Street to drum and sing. The UNgeneral assembly circus drives New Yorkers bonkers, the streets are gridlocked and the eateries overflow, but the vibrancy of it is quite wonderful: the convivial murmur of languages on the east side of Midtown, the colour and style of the clothing, the downing of late-night whiskey amid animated conversation.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Morrison delivers his statement to the 74th session of the UN general assembly. Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAP\n\nTrump declares theatrically, with Nancy Pelosi closing in, during his address to the UN national assembly, that this is the time for patriots, not globalists. It\u2019s a soundbite crafted for Breitbart or Fox News, potent with his rusted-ons, but a hollow slogan in the world of facts and evidence. Did I miss the bit of history where globalisation became optional? For what it\u2019s worth, New York categorically ignores him. On the streets, in the stores, in the financial district, globalisation prevails. It\u2019s not even a contest.\n\nBeyond the literal, the figurative drumbeat is for Trump. Impeachment is closing in on the president. Some commentators say he looked subdued at the UN, which would be a rare lapse in self-confidence. The mood at the start of the week in Washington was come and get me suckers. But I\u2019m out of the presidential orbit now so I have no first-hand observation to report.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Trump waits to give his address. Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAP\n\nMorrison, comprehensively overshadowed by movements in the tectonic plates of the major powers, ploughs on diligently with his UN program and seems unperturbed by the misfortune of his two mates, Boris Johnson and Trump, hitting some serious turbulence. If the prime minister had any regrets about taking hospitality from Trump and aligning Australia\u2019s diplomatic language precisely with the president on some thorny geopolitical issues, he certainly didn\u2019t show it.\n\nA certain defensiveness did creep in on climate change, though. Morrison wasn\u2019t cranky but there were persistent pesky questions from the travelling media about Australia\u2019s lack of policy ambition, and about his decision not to attend the UN climate summit on Monday. Even Trump called by. Why didn\u2019t Morrison? There was the sound of prime ministerial teeth being gritted.\n\nInterestingly, Morrison\u2019s speech to the UN general assembly, which was billed initially as being an address about practical environmentalism, not climate change, drifted back into climate. There was a significant chunk defending his government\u2019s policies, and some umbrage at the media for feeding false narratives \u2013 not fake news, mind you, but stoking prejudicial sentiment.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Morrison defends his government\u2019s record on climate change to the UN general assembly. Photograph: Lucas Jackson/Reuters\n\nIn New York we meet our final billionaire, Mike Cannon-Brookes. The final piece of my triptych, the next gen mover and shaker, moves in different circles to Pratt and Rinehart. MCB didn\u2019t make the cut for the state dinner at the White House, evidently, but he made a bit of a splash at the UN.\n\nThe Atlassian founder went to the climate summit to commit his company to a target of net zero emissions by no later than 2050. Cannon-Brookes nudged Morrison on Twitter: \u201cPlease give us a future we can believe in tomorrow. Inspire us. Lead us. Don\u2019t bullshit us. I\u2019m happy to help, as are millions of Aussies.\u201d\n\nI meet Cannon-Brookes at the Flower Shop, a hipster bar on the Lower East Side. His minders invited us down for a beverage. Most of my colleagues are punctual but I\u2019m late, because the traffic is terrible, and the bearded tech entrepreneur lobs late as well. There is an overwhelming smell of weed that eddies through the bar as we settle in, which I stress is not connected to anyone in our group or Atlassian\u2019s.\n\nI don\u2019t know who is responsible for this licentiousness and don\u2019t intend to investigate, frankly \u2013 but it\u2019s surreal, meeting a thirty-something billionaire in a bar as the bookend of this bonkers week, and having the bar reek of marijuana \u2013 that I find it hard to stop laughing at the unlikeliness of it all. It caps off the Through the Looking Glass sensation of the US odyssey.\n\nThe evening is convivial and, unsurprisingly, there is much impassioned talk about climate change and energy policy and a fair sprinkling of acronyms \u2013 a bunch of Aussies jousting good naturedly about the future of the planet in a bar in Manhattan.
