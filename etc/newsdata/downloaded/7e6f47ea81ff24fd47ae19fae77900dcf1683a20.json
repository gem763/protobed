A 2002 Gallup poll found just 14 percent of Americans support cash reparations for slavery. When Gallup polled again earlier this year, support had jumped to 29 percent.\n\nEven with an increasing number of people open to the concept of reparations, a crucial question looms over the debate: Who would be eligible to receive the payouts?\n\nDarity has long advocated that reparations should be given to people who prove they descended from a person enslaved in the United States \u2014 increasingly possible, he notes, because of online ancestry databases \u2014 and show that they have identified as black in public documents for at least 10 years. A program with such parameters would exclude a number of black Americans whose ancestors were enslaved elsewhere, such as Jamaica, Haiti or the Bahamas.\n\nWhy haven\u2019t the nation\u2019s schools done a better job of teaching about slavery?\n\nDarity\u2019s core argument is that black slaves were subject to a form of sustained, race-based discrimination unique in American history, robbing them of individual agency, voting rights and the ability to accumulate wealth and education.\n\nThe lingering result, Darity argues, is a stunning wealth gap \u2014 a recent study that he co-authored found median wealth in greater Los Angeles was $355,000 for white households and just $4,000 for African Americans \u2014 that drives other racial disparities in areas such as crime, education and health outcomes.\n\nDarity\u2019s cohort includes historians and economists from Duke, North Carolina Central University, Florida State University and the University of Connecticut, as well as Mary Frances Berry, a former chairwoman on the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. They plan to deliver their report in early 2020 so if Congress establishes a commission to study reparations, the proposal can provide a vital road map.\n\nThe ADOS movement\n\nA key challenge, Darity and his partners concede, will be convincing the public that reparations are achievable.\n\n\u201cWe need to overcome this perception that reparations is sort of a pie-in-the-sky concept,\u201d said Trevon Logan, an economic historian at Ohio State University who is working with Darity.\n\n\u201cThis is not a new item on the agenda. African Americans, from immediately after emancipation, were seeking to find ways to close the racial wealth inequality,\u201d Logan said. \u201cEarly black politicians were interested in using tax policy to try to redistribute wealth and to increase landownership among former slaves.\u201d\n\nWhen he was in the House, John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.) proposed a congressional study into the feasibility of reparations \u2014 H.R. 40 \u2014 during every session of Congress from 1989 through 2017. That push was modeled largely after the successful efforts that, in 1988, secured an official apology and monetary reparations for Japanese Americans held in internment camps during World War II.\n\n\u201cThe descendants of slaves certainly deserve the same considerations,\u201d said JoAnn Watson, a former Conyers aide who later spent a decade as a Detroit city councilwoman. \u201cThe time for reparations has come.\u201d\n\nDarity\u2019s efforts will probably be both furthered and complicated by his public association with a small but outspoken online movement called American Descendants of Slavery, or ADOS, which draws a stark distinction between the lineage of slave descendants and that of American-born descendants of black immigrants.\n\nThe group, like Darity, advocates that reparations be strictly reserved for those who can trace their lineage to enslaved people held in the United States, excluding the children of more-recent African and Caribbean immigrants who have also been subject to race-based discrimination. More divisively, the group and its leaders also have aggressively argued that current immigration levels present a threat to the livelihood of black Americans.\n\nA few liberal activists challenged Kamala Harris\u2019s black authenticity. The president\u2019s son amplified their message.\n\nThat framing has rankled many black activists \u2014 some of whom have documented being harassed online by ADOS supporters \u2014 who have long adopted a more Pan-African ideology and see any effort to delineate among various groups of black Americans as having the potential to fuel xenophobia. In interviews, half a dozen activists and academics praised Darity\u2019s work but found themselves perplexed by his willingness to associate with ADOS.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely difficult to separate classes of black people,\u201d said Nkechi Taifa, a D.C.-based activist who has advocated reparations for more than three decades. \u201cThe idea that unless you can actually trace your family directly to a slave that you haven\u2019t been subject to the legacy of slavery is a bunch of hogwash.\u201d\n\nStill, Taifa said she is encouraged by how mainstream the discussion of slavery\u2019s lasting effects has become.\n\n\u201cWhen we were doing this work decades ago, we knew we were planting seeds,\u201d she said. \u201cI never imagined I\u2019d be able to sit under the shade of the trees from the seeds that I was planting.\u201d\n\nDarity, who has in the past defended ADOS from charges of nativism, says he does not agree some of the most vitriolic messaging, but he credits ADOS with helping raise the profile of the push for reparations.\n\nIn defending his rationale for limited eligibility for reparations, Darity notes that the majority of black immigrants came after the civil rights period in the 1960s. While it is clear that more recently arrived black Americans have faced discrimination \u2014 and in many cases have ancestors who were enslaved \u2014 Darity said he finds it hard to argue that those who immigrated voluntarily deserve the same reparations as the descendants of those brought to the United States in chains.\n\n\u201cIf you told me that the only way that I could have a reparations program is that if I gave it to more people, then I\u2019d say okay,\u201d Darity said with a laugh. \u201cBut I\u2019m trying to think about how we craft a case that is specific to the United States government as the perpetrator, and I think it becomes very difficult to argue that the United States government should pay reparations to people who have chosen to come here.\u201d\n\nPast efforts to advocate reparations have similarly centered on the experience of descendants of American slaves, said Ashley D. Farmer, a history professor at the University of Texas at Austin who has studied black-nationalist groups.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure that the folks that I\u2019ve studied where particularly well versed in slavery outside of the American context,\u201d said Farmer, who is not affiliated with Darity's efforts. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting blind spot.\u201d\n\nA shift on the left\n\nThe current iteration of the reparations debate was kick-started nationally in 2014 when the Atlantic magazine published Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019s \u201cThe Case for Reparations.\u201d\n\nAs with most issues of race and justice, public opinion is divided along racial and partisan lines. A significant majority of black Americans polled (73 percent) and a plurality of Democrats (49 percent) told Gallup pollsters earlier this year that they support cash reparations. The same poll found that the vast majority of white Americans (81 percent) and Republicans (92 percent) oppose cash reparations.\n\nA group of black teenagers went searching for a sunken slave ship. It changed how they view slavery.\n\nFormer president Barack Obama, the nation\u2019s first black president but not a descendant of slaves, has long declined to directly answer whether he would support a reparations program, instead focusing on its lack of political feasibility.\n\n\u201cYou can make a theoretical, abstract argument in favor of something like reparations. And maybe I\u2019m just not being sufficiently optimistic or imaginative enough,\u201d Obama told Coates in an interview in 2016, \u201c. . . but I\u2019m not so optimistic as to think that you would ever be able to garner a majority of an American Congress that would make those kinds of investments.\u201d\n\nSome prominent Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), publicly support the resolution to launch a formal study of how reparations could work. And at least four Democratic presidential primary candidates \u2014 Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), former Housing and Urban Development secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro and Marianne Williamson \u2014 have expressed support for the concept of paying reparations to the descendants of slaves.\n\nRepublican officials, meanwhile, have largely dismissed the concept. In June, on the same day the House Judiciaries Committee was set to hold a hearing on the topic, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) announced his opposition.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think reparations for something that happened 150 years ago, for which none of us living are responsible, is a good idea,\u201d said McConnell, whose ancestors owned slaves.\n\nDarity and other reparations supporters say that the current political moment should encourage politicians to pursue policies once considered impossible \u2014 after all, a reality-television star is president.\n\n\u201cTrump has made it clear that positions that we have typically considered to be extreme or out of the boundaries no longer are, on the right,\u201d Darity said. \u201cSo why not reconsider things on the left?\u201d", "description": "A group of experts led by economist William \u201cSandy\u201d Darity is trying to define who is a \u201cdescendant of slavery.\u201d", "authors": ["Wesley Lowery", "National Correspondent Covering Law Enforcement", "Justice", "Their Intersection With Politics"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/I4X25BAHRAI6RB3XFICZ6FUN2I.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
