But according to bestselling management author and CNBC contributor Suzy Welch, you should have your answer meticulously prepared.\n\nCNBC Contributor Suzy Welch.\n\nPotential employers will use your response to determine two things: your maturity and your authenticity, Welch tells CNBC Make It. Here's the best way to answer this common question.\n\nTell your story with the job in mind\n\nWhile it may sound like the hiring manager has asked for your life story, they don't want to hear a long-winded, aimless tale. And they already have the bulk of your professional narrative in front of them, in the form of your resume.\n\n\n\n\"The interviewer, usually your future boss, wants to know the parts of your life story that relate to your doing well in the open job,\" Welch says. For example, if you are interviewing for a job in sales, tell the hiring manager how you ran lemonade stands when you were a kid, sold products in college or pitched a new project at your last job. Ask yourself, \"What is it about me that he or she cares about?\" Welch says. This shows the hiring manager that you are aware of what they're looking for, which is a sign of maturity.\n\nDon't be afraid to show who you really are", "description": "You might think you can wing it \u2014 but that's a mistake.", "authors": ["Kathryn Dill Marguerite Ward", "Kathryn Dill", "Marguerite Ward"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105119238-Suzy_Welch_organge.jpg?v=1529477963", "published_at": "2018-09-19"}
