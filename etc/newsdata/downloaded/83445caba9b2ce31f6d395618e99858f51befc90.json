Recruitment recommendations and decisions are worked on on a day-to-day basis, by this department and the manager and his team.\n\n\u201cThese investments, together with the commitments we made to Ole and his coaching staff in March, have given us the building blocks for success.\n\n\u201cWhilst we are confident this investment will deliver results, it's important that we are patient while Ole and his team build for the future. We will continue to focus on the long-term strategy and won't be influenced by short-term distractions.\"", "description": "Ed Woodward has stressed that Manchester United will be\u00a0patient as the\u00a0club rebuilds under the management of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.
