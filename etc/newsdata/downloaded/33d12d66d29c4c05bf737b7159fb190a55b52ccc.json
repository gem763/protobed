Trump warned on Wednesday afternoon that the Never Trump Republicans, or those who identify as Republican but refuse to support President Trump, could possibly be worse than the Democratic Party. Since before he was elected, there was a small but vocal number of conservative pundits and politicians who condemned Trump and his \"Make America Great Again\" policies.\n\n\"The Never Trumper Republicans, though on respirators with not many left, are in certain ways worse and more dangerous for our Country than the Do Nothing Democrats. Watch out for them, they are human scum!\" the president tweeted.\n\nThe Never Trumper Republicans, though on respirators with not many left, are in certain ways worse and more dangerous for our Country than the Do Nothing Democrats. Watch out for them, they are human scum! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 23, 2019\n\nPresident Trump had been railing against \"Do Nothing Democrats\" all day on Twitter on Wednesday, promising the GOP will fight the Democrats before he sent his Never Trump tweet.\n\nRepublicans are going to fight harder than ever to win back the House because of what the Do Nothing Democrats have done to our Country! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 23, 2019\n\nIt never ends. The Do Nothing Dems are terrible! https://t.co/l7Qk0WU8ML \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 23, 2019\n\nAn example of a Never Trump Republican would be one like Utah Senator Mitt Romney. He boldly opposed the president by using a fake Twitter account called \"Pierre Delecto\" to send passive aggressive tweets, like things from the mainstream media, and bash the commander-in-chief.", "description": ".10/24/2019 0:51:42AM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Beth Baumann", "Bronson Stocking"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/291/ebf31651-2100-49af-8278-8eec6ee83cd0.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
