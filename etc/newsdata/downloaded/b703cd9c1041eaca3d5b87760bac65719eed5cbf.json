Woke: Pierre Delecto", "language": "en", "text": "File this under Too Good To Check. It turns out that Mitt Romney (or possibly one of his aides, probably both) has been running a fake Romney supporting Twitter account for years. He\u2019s even admitted to it after being outed by a reporter at Slate. But it\u2019s the name that really gives this story that special chef\u2019s kiss. Mitt went with \u201cPierre Delecto\u201d as his pseudonym. And I think we can all admit that it\u2019s about the best fake Twitter name imaginable. (WaPo)\n\nFor years, Pierre Delecto\u2019s presence on Twitter largely went unnoticed. Operating a bare-bones account with the handle \u201c@qaws9876,\u201d the user\u2019s limited activity only revealed an interest in politics \u2014 namely supporting Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah). So when \u201cPierre Delecto\u201d started trending Sunday on the social media platform, people were understandably confused. \u201cWhy are we talking about Pierre Delecto,\u201d one person asked. \u201cWTH is a Pierre Delecto & why is everyone going crazy about it?\u201d another wanted to know. On Sunday, Twitter users lost their collective minds when they learned that \u201cPierre Delecto\u201d wasn\u2019t a bot or a random Romney superfan, but an account created by the Republican senator himself.\n\nRomney took the account private almost immediately, but give him credit for owning up to it with style. When asked if he was really the account owner, Mitt answered \u201cC\u2019est moi.\u201d\n\nAs \u201cscandals\u201d go, I\u2019m not sure that this one winds up amounting to much. I suppose it\u2019s technically a violation of Twitter\u2019s rules about using fake identities so they could cancel it if they wanted to, but what\u2019s the point now, really?\n\nAlso, it\u2019s not as if he\u2019s being accused of posting pornography or anything really salacious. All he appears to have been doing is \u201cliking\u201d tweets critical of President Trump or saying things to defend himself. (By that I mean the actual Mitt Romney, not Delecto.) As a side note, Romney\u2019s wife Ann allegedly also has a fake account under the name of \u201cPatience Darling\u201d which is also private.\n\nHere\u2019s the interview in the Atlantic where Mitt let the cat out of the bag. What\u2019s curious is why he decided to mention it unless he planned on making the fake account public anyway.\n\nHe explained that he uses a secret Twitter account\u2014\u201cWhat do they call me, a lurker?\u201d\u2014to keep tabs on the political conversation. \u201cI won\u2019t give you the name of it,\u201d he said, but \u201cI\u2019m following 668 people.\u201d Swiping at his tablet, he recited some of the accounts he follows, including journalists, late-night comedians (\u201cWhat\u2019s his name, the big redhead from Boston?\u201d), and athletes. Trump was not among them. \u201cHe tweets so much,\u201d Romney said, comparing the president to one of his nieces who overshares on Instagram. \u201cI love her, but it\u2019s like, Ah, it\u2019s too much.\u201d\n\nReading that through for a second time, maybe Mitt really didn\u2019t think that he would be found out. Yes, he admitted to having a secret \u201clurker\u201d account, but he didn\u2019t give up the name. But saying exactly how many other accounts Delecto followed and then including a number of names meant that a dogged reporter would be able to narrow it down pretty quickly. And that reporter was Slate\u2019s Ashley Feinberg.\n\nSo what\u2019s our takeaway from all this? Not much, really. It\u2019s a funny story, but it doesn\u2019t have nearly as much meat on the bone as Carlos Danger\u2019s online adventures. I\u2019m confident that Feinberg must have downloaded all of Pierre Delecto\u2019s tweets before it was taken private and if there was anything really incendiary in there we\u2019d already know about it.", "description": "Too good to check... for years", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/romney-up.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
