She was surprised when he started talking to her.\n\n'The pair went downstairs and he sat on the sofa next to her. The next thing the woman knows is that Niubasaga had knelt down in front of her and began touching her up.\n\n'He told the woman that he didn't like the way she dressed and said that it would invite unwanted attention. At this point he pushed her legs apart and touched her private parts and attempted to have oral sex with her.\n\n'The woman pushed his bald head away, but this failed to make him stop and he then got on top of her and raped her.\n\n'She tried to push him away by putting her hands on her chest and saying no to him.\n\n'The woman said that after she had protested for a while, he stopped and left. The situation left her feeling emotionally drained and didn't know what to do.\n\n'She phoned a friend who was a serving female soldier at another base and told her what had happened. The soldier then contacted a mutual friend to go and assist.\n\nThe mutual friend found the woman crying hysterically and called the police.. She also went upstairs to check on the other woman in bed who said to her, 'who was that man?'.\n\nThe jury was told that the police went to talk to the woman in bed and she described a man coming into the bedroom and sexually touching her between the legs.\n\n'She told the police that it was the 'Fijian man'.\n\nThe trial continues today.", "description": "Corporal Serupepeli Niubasaga, 40, a Fijian who lives in Hullavington, Wiltshire, pleaded not guilty to the the alleged offences, which occurred on May 26 and May 27 last year.", "authors": ["Joe Middleton For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/17/20339044-0-image-a-6_1572369895402.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
