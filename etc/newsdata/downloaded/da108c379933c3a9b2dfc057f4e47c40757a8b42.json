United is adding 3D views during ticket booking", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE United is now providing a virtual seat-selection map for select aircraft, beginning with the Bombadier CRJ-550. United Airlines\n\nNot sure what you're getting when you pick that airline seat assignment, many of which increasingly come with a fee?\n\nUnited Airlines is rolling out a feature that allows passengers to take a tour of the seats before reserving one as well as seeing other features of the plane.\n\nThe new virtual seat map will debut on the airline's website Saturday for one type of plane, its plush new 50-seat CRJ 550, and will be expanded to other types of planes.\n\nLinda Jojo, United's executive vice president of technology and chief digital officer, said the main goal of the seat map is to \"demystify'' the different types of seats on a plane today.\n\nUnited and other major airlines have been carving up their cabins into different seating sections aimed at travelers with different budgets and travel tastes. They call it segmentation.\n\nNo, you can't move into that empty legroom seat on your flight.They cost extra.\n\nTour your \u2708\ufe0f before you board. Our new virtual tour lets you experience seats + cabin features during the booking process. Live this weekend for flights on our CRJ-550 and on additional fleet types soon. So go on and select that perfect window (or aisle) spot. #UnitedFlightPlanpic.twitter.com/QcNpFDlKfN \u2014 United Airlines (@united) October 25, 2019\n\nThe introduction of different types of seats, including different sections within the economy cabin, some with extra legroom and other perks including free drinks, has led to confusion for many passengers.\n\nFor example, on most airlines, a preferred seat in the economy cabin doesn't come with any extra perks. It is simply a seat in a spot the airline considers more desirable, such as aisles and windows closer to the front of the plane. United's Economy Plus seats, in contrast, come with extra legroom and in-seat power outlets.\n\nAsked whether the virtual seat map is a tool to get passengers to buy a cushier seat, Jojo said that is not the primary goal, though \"that might happen.''\n\n\"We do have a more segmented product right now,'' Jojo said. \"So for customers to understand the difference in those segments, so when they buy it they know what they bought, is really the most important thing.''\n\nPrices for different seats won't be shown on the virtual seat map as they are on the regular online seat maps but that is planned in the future, United said.\n\nNo more being told there's no room for your carry-on:United adding bigger overhead bins\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2019/10/25/united-airlines-adding-3-d-views-seats-during-ticket-booking/2454781001/", "description": "Starting this weekend, you'll be able to take a virtual tour of certain aircraft during the booking process so you can pick the perfect sea location.", "authors": ["Dawn Gilbertson", "Published P.M.
