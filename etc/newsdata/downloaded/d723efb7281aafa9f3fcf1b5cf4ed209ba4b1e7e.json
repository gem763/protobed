REUTERS/Henry Nicholls\n\nThe battle over Brexit spilled onto the streets of London when hundreds of thousands of people gathered to demand a new referendum while lawmakers decided the fate of Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union.\n\nMany turned to sometimes risqu\u00e9 British humor.\n\nDominic Cummings, cast by his enemies variously as the puppet master of Brexit, Britain\u2019s Rasputin or a political vandal, was made into a giant effigy of the devil, complete with horns and manipulating his boss, Johnson.\n\n\u201cDemonic Cummings\u201d was scrawled across the head of the effigy, pulled by protesters, some with berets sporting the stars of the European flag.\n\nAnother placard said: \u2018I didn\u2019t vote for Dominic Cummings\u2019.\n\nOther targets were the privileged financial backers of Brexit.\n\n\u201cBrexit is a billionaire con,\u201d read one banner. \u201cBrexit = Disaster Capitalism\u201d read another.\n\nUnder the slogan \u201cEton Mess\u201d one placard showed former Prime Minister David Cameron and Johnson, both of whom studied at Britain\u2019s most privileged school - Eton College. They were cast as Horror and Lardy in the pose of Laurel and Hardy, complete with bowler hats.\n\nIn 2016, 17.4 million voters, or 52%, backed Brexit while 16.1 million, or 48%, backed staying in the EU. Both campaigns were supported by wealthy backers.\n\nSex, of course, was one topic employed on Saturday, as peculiarly, were vegetables and fruit.\n\n\u201cBrexit is like consent - we can change our minds during foreplay,\u201d read one placard. \u201cPulling out never works,\u201d read another.\n\nOne man was dressed as broccoli while another was dressed as a banana with a sign: \u201cWe are ripe for change.\u201d", "description": "Anti-Brexit protesters on Saturday used a bizarre array of humor to lampoon Britain's leaders, casting Prime Minister Boris Johnson's chief adviser as a manipulating devil behind a divorce that was the work of a privileged few.", "authors": ["Dylan Martinez", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191019&t=2&i=1442666121&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9I0AW", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
