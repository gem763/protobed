Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.), a surrogate for the campaign of former vice president Joe Biden \u2014 argues that such coarse chants are inappropriate for a democracy, and that talk of jailing political opponents is the stuff of authoritarian regimes.\n\n\u201cI frankly think the office of the president deserves respect, even when the actions of our president at times don\u2019t,\u201d Coons told CNN the morning after the game.\n\nOther Democrats argue that Trump, a president they see as morally unfit for office and worthy of impeachment and removal, does not deserve the esteem that would be reserved for any other occupant of the White House.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI actually applaud when he faces a mass protest by everyday citizens, who were not organized, who turned his own words against him,\u201d said Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank. \u201cTrump is a street fighter, and if you\u2019re not ready to fight in the street, you should get out of the way.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nJennifer Granholm, the former Michigan governor, also welcomed Sunday night\u2019s eruption. \u201cI confess I felt a little guilty pleasure in the chant, but then I thought of kids in cages and my guilt morphed into rage,\u201d Granholm said via Twitter. \u201cGive me the key; I\u2019d love to lock him up.\u201d\n\nThe debate reflects Democrats\u2019 dilemma on how to channel the volcanic energy gathering on the left. Is it best to energize the party base by deploying Trump\u2019s own weapons against him, or should Democrats seek to show that their party occupies the higher ground?\n\nAD\n\nCalls to the Democratic campaigns suggest the candidates are not inclined to embrace chants like the one Sunday night, though several chose not to address the issue.\n\nElizabeth Warren has confronted \u201cLock him up\u201d chants, and her response was to discourage her crowds from repeating the slogan. Biden\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t report any known instances of the chant at his events, and spokesman Andrew Bates said if they did occur, the former vice president would say \u201cDon\u2019t chant, vote.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nA spokesman for Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019s campaign declined to comment. So did Sy Lee, a spokesperson for businessman Andrew Yang, who noted that Yang doesn\u2019t mention Trump that much at his events. Spokespeople for South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) didn\u2019t respond to questions.\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s \u201cLock her up\u201d chant entered the political consciousness when it became a feature of his 2016 campaign rallies, an early example coming in February of that year when roughly 11,000 supporters in Florida repeated the chant. It was a way of suggesting that Clinton was more than just a political opponent \u2014 that she was guilty of criminal acts, despite a lack of evidence to that effect.\n\nRepetitive chanting proved an energizing technique at Trump\u2019s rallies; other slogans included \u201cBuild the wall\u201d and \u201cRomney sucks\u201d \u2014 a barb directed at former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney.\n\nAD\n\nBy the time of the 2016 Republican National Convention in Ohio, \u201cLock her up\u201d had become an unofficial party motto, with speakers leading the GOP delegates in yelling the slogan from the floor.\n\nAD\n\nTrump still refers to Clinton at his rallies from time to time, standing back as the crowd recites the chant. His audiences have embraced other controversial phrases, at one point breaking into calls of \u201cSend her back\u201d in reference to U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), a liberal Somali American who has attracted Trump\u2019s ire.\n\nThe debate among Democrats over \u201cLock him up\u201d reflect a concern in some parts of the party that Trump has changed the nature of politics and it would be foolish to play by rules that no longer apply.\n\n\u201cDemocrats usually come with white papers and statistics to talk about why we should reduce CO2 levels. We can\u2019t do that anymore,\u201d said Kelly Dietrich, CEO of the National Democratic Training Committee, a group that teaches would-be candidates how to run for office. \u201cDemocrats do need to use more emotion.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStill, he added, \u201cThe \u2018Lock him up\u2019 is funny, but if I were running and I wanted a crowd chanting something, I would want them chanting \u2018Fix my health care.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThis tension between a boiling fury at the president and a desire to operate on a higher level has already begun playing out on the Democratic campaign trail.\n\nWarren, who has attracted some of the biggest crowds in the presidential campaign, tends to steer her supporters toward policy-oriented chants like \u201ctwo cents,\u201d a shorthand for her proposed 2 percent annual tax on fortunes over $50 million.\n\nBut her supporters have also turned their attention to the president. At a town hall event several weeks ago in Carson City, Nev., Warren\u2019s crowd began yelling \u201cLock him up!\u201d after a pro-Trump protester interrupted her speech.\n\nAD\n\nWarren insisted that the chants stop. \u201cNo, no!\u201d she called, waving her hand to quiet her fans.\n\nAD\n\nThen she sought to turn the protester into a symbol of her own success as a candidate. \u201cI understand Donald Trump and his supporters are getting really nervous,\u201d Warren said. The crowd stopped chanting and began applauding.\n\nAfterward, Warren told reporters that she tried to tamp down the chants because she did not agree with the sentiment. \u201cWe have an ongoing impeachment proceeding right now in Washington that is a serious constitutional undertaking, and we need to treat it with seriousness,\u201d Warren said. \u201cThis is a hard time in our country.\u201d\n\nBut Democratic audiences sometimes do not want to hear talk of coming together with Republicans, in part because they believe the GOP has adopted a scorched-earth approach. At one rally in Detroit, Booker\u2019s high-minded rhetoric about love and unity was interrupted by a foul-mouthed supporter when the New Jersey senator referred to Trump.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe is going to try to divide. Our call is to unite,\u201d said Booker. \u201cHe is going to try to revive hatred in this nation...\u201d\n\n\u201cF--- that!\u201d the supporter yelled.\n\n\u201c. . . and we need a revival of civic grace,\u201d Booker concluded.\n\nSanders has adopted a more nuanced attitude toward protesters, at times acknowledging them and incorporating their emotion into his speeches.\n\nOver the summer in Santa Monica, Calif., as he talked about Medicare-for-all, he slammed the pharmaceutical industry and then turned his attention to the environment.\n\n\u201cToday, we say to the fossil fuel industry. . .\u201d Sanders said, pausing for breath. A member of the crowd offered filled in the sentence, yelling: \u201c \u2018F--- you!\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cThat is one way of saying it,\u201d Sanders replied. \u201cNot exactly the way I was going to say it.\u201d\n\nAt its root, the debate reflects an uncertainty among Democrats about how to grapple with a political phenomenon they find disorienting and traumatic. Watching Trump ignore so many rules, and pay so little price, makes some wonder if it\u2019s time for them to do the same. But the Democratic Party has long prided itself on seeking a better society, and engaging in coarse rhetoric hardly seems a reflection of that.\n\nAD\n\nThe dispute may not be settled until there is a Democratic nominee, and perhaps not even then. For now, some on the left have begun taking their passion to Trump rallies, eager to confront their adversaries.\n\nAt a recent Trump rally in Minneapolis, a group of protesters wearing dark clothing and with their faces covered crowded around a handful of police officers, repeatedly chanting, \u201cWhose streets? Our streets!\u201d And then: \u201cKill a cop, save a life!\u201d\n\nOccasionally, Trump supporters walked through the crowd, only to have protesters try to steal their red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats.\n\nThe stolen Trump gear went into in a pile. It was set ablaze in the middle of the street.", "description": "A World Series crowd broke into a chant of \u201cLock him up\u201d when Trump appeared at the game.
