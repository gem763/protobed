Frank Lampard has been able to call upon a new \u00a358million signing this season and on Saturday Christian Pulisic showed why he's been chosen as Eden Hazard's successor.\n\nThe paperwork to sign Pulisic from Borussia Dortmund was completed in January \u2013 before the embargo officially started \u2013 but he only arrived in England this summer and has had to wait to make his mark.\n\nThis was his first Premier League start since August and the 21-year-old American winger proved beyond doubt he can handle a freezing Saturday night in Burnley.\n\nChristian Pulisic scored his first Chelsea goals and a hat-trick as they secured a 4-2 victory in their clash away to Burnley\n\nPulisic celebrates after scoring his first Chelsea goal, which put his side in the lead in their game against Burnley\n\nPulisic has had to be patient for opportunities but the United States international seized his chance against Burnley\n\nPulisic is congratulated by his Chelsea team-mates Cesar Azpilicueta and Willian after scoring his first goal of the game\n\nMATCH FACTS, PLAYER RATINGS AND LEAGUE TABLE Burnley (4-4-1-1): Pope 6; Lowton 5, Tarkowski 5, Mee 6, Pieters 6; Hendrick 6 (Brady 84), Cork 7, Westwood 6, McNeil 7; Rodriguez 6; Barnes 5.5 (Vydra 63 6) Subs not used: Hart, Bardsley, Taylor, Long, Lennon Goalscorers: Rodriguez 86, McNeil 90 Booked: Pieters, Hendrick, Brady Chelsea: (4-3-3): Arrizabalaga 6; Azpilicueta 5.5, Tomori 6.5, Zouma 6, Alonso 6.5 (James 63 6); Kovacic 7, Jorginho 7; Willian 7 (Hudson-Odoi 72 5), Mount 6.5, Pulisic 8.5; Abraham 6 (Giroud 70 6) Subs not used: Caballero, Guehi, Pedro, Batshuayi Goalscorers: Pulisic 21, 45 & 56, Willian 58 Booked: Willian Referee: Michael Oliver 6 Season at a glance Live tables\n\nFixtures\n\nScores Premier League\n\nPremier League\n\nChampionship\n\nLeague One\n\nLeague Two\n\nScottish Premiership\n\nScottish Div 1\n\nScottish Div 2\n\nScottish Div 3\n\nLigue 1\n\nSerie A\n\nLa Liga\n\nBundesliga\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first hat-trick of his career \u2013 his first goals for Chelsea \u2013 was not only 'perfect' because it consisted of left foot, right foot, head.\n\nEach one also oozed class, the first two included a stepovers and body swerve past England contender James Tarkowski, and the treble goal was a flick header directed by the back of his neck.\n\n'I used to score headers as a youth, as a professional not so much,' said Pulisic afterwards. 'It was special and I couldn't believe it had gone in when I looked round.'\n\nNot surprisingly, Lampard was thrilled to see Chelsea's latest big-money recruit make such a match-winning impact.\n\n'I'm delighted for him because I know the pressure of settling in a new league,' he said. 'Quite rightly, he is a star of his country so you'll get asked when he is going to start games. I have competition in the wide areas but the way he's been in training the last few weeks, he deserved to start.\n\nThe 21-year-old showed impressive composure as he steered the ball into the back of the net in the 21st minute\n\nChelsea boss Frank Lampard was delighted after seeing Pulisic make it 2-0 to Chelsea against Burnley at Turf Moor\n\nPulisic scored his, and Chelsea's, second goal of the game with another fine effort just before the half time whistle\n\nPulisic is delighted after scoring his second goal of the game, with his efforts helping Chelsea go two goals to the good\n\nChelsea midfielder Mason Mount congratulates Christian Pulisic after the latter scored his second goal of the game\n\n'He has a great talent. There is a lot of physicality in the Premier League, particularly at places like Burnley, but he moved the ball quickly and it was great to see his balance and the stepover for his first goal. I hope it gives him confidence.'\n\nChelsea's victory was their seventh in a row in all competitions and lifted them up to fourth in the Premier League table. Pulisic put them 3-0 ahead by the 56th minute before Willian added a fourth.\n\nThat left Burnley boss Sean Dyche fearing the worse but their performance deserved the two late consolation goals scored by Jay Rodriguez and Dwight McNeil. There was even a VAR controversy on an action-packed evening, Chelsea awarded a penalty before the decision was checked and Callum Hudson-Odoi booked for diving.\n\nNaturally the managers disagreed on that. 'Not clear cut,' said Lampard. While Dyche fumed: 'If young players are diving, the game is in trouble because they are the future.'\n\nPulisic replaced Hudson-Odoi on the left of a 4-2-3-1 in the only change from Chelsea's midweek Champions League win at Ajax.\n\nPulisic completed his hat-trick in the 56th minute of the game when he scored a header following Mason Mount's corner\n\nPulisic (second left) celebrates scoring his third goal with team-mates Tammy Abraham, Fikayo Tomori and Mason Mount\n\nIt proved an inspired selection by Lampard as Pulisic ruthlessly took the chances afforded him by an unusually sloppy Burnley.\n\nThe opening goal after 21 minutes arrived when Matt Lowton dwelt on the ball midway inside his own half when Pulisic pounced and set off towards the penalty area.\n\nOnce in full flow, the American tricked his way past Tarkowski without breaking stride and gave Nick Pope no chance with his finish from the left-hand side of the penalty area into the bottom corner.\n\nAshley Barnes missed two headers he'd normally put away as Burnley tried to retaliate. But the home side were undone on the stroke of half-time when Tarkowski's pass was intercepted by Willian and Pulisic again ran from distance into the box.\n\nThis time, he bodyswerved to the right and his shot deflected off Ben Mee to wrongfoot Pope.\n\n'The second goal was a killer,' admitted Dyche. 'By the time it got to 4-0 you were wondering what kind of night it would turn out to be. Credit to us for coming back and continuing to try and slug it out.'\n\nWillian celebrates after his third goal of the season, scored in the 58th minute, made it 4-0 to Chelsea against Burnley\n\nWillian's goal inflicted further misery upon Burnley - it came just two minutes after Pulisic had completed his hat-trick\n\nJay Rodriguez scored an impressive goal from distance in the closing stages as Burnley reduced the deficit\n\nDwight McNeil is congratulated by team-mate Robbie Brady after scoring Burnley's second goal in their loss to Chelsea\n\nPulisic is only 5ft 8ins but produced a clever jump to complete his hat-trick. Mason Mount's original corner was charged back down to him but the Englishman's delivery was much better at the second attempt and Pulisic guided his header with his back to goal.\n\nIt was then time to share the goals around a bit and Willian added a fourth shortly before an hour, receiving Tammy Abraham's pass and firing low past the outstretched leg of Erik Pieters into the bottom corner.\n\nBurnley deserved their late rally with Chelsea 'keeper Kepa earlier making a good save from McNeil at 1-0.\n\nWillian attempts to retain possession for Chelsea while being tracked by Burnley midfielder Jack Cork\n\nTammy Abraham attempts to make a major impact for Chelsea as he is pursued by Burnley defender James Tarkowski\n\nChelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga is forced into a save during the first half of his team's game against Burnley\n\nAfter 86 minutes, Pulisic made his only mistake of the evening with a slip and Rodriguez took advantage with a thunderous drive from 30 yards. McNeil's deflected strike of Fikayo Tomori as injury-time was about to begin gave the scoreline a fairer look.\n\nBy that time, 18-year-old Hudson-Odoi was in the referee's book for a vault between Lowton and Tarkowski that initially led ref Michael Oliver to point to the spot.\n\nThe frantic end didn't spoil Lampard's evening though. 'The two goals didn't take the gloss off for me,' he said. With Chelsea winning at the moment in every competition they play in, you can't blame him.
