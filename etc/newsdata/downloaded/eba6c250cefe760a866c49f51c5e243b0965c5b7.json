There are so many things that aren't right.\n\n'There's absolutely no leadership from the very top of the club to the bottom.\n\nSunday's defeat meant Manchester United dropped into the bottom half of the Premier League\n\n'It begs the question, what exactly are the team working on in training? What are they doing?\n\n'I want Ole to do well, because I want the club to do well, but all he keeps saying is 'we're working hard', but what on?\n\n'We've seen no improvements in the team. I want to know what exactly they're supposed to be working on, because I'm not seeing anything.", "description": "Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Ince says the Red Devils are 'a complete mess' and branded David De Gea's post-match interview at Newcastle a 'disgrace'.", "authors": ["David Wood For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/23/19368506-0-image-a-19_1570488057120.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
