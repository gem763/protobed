The alligator weighed between 180 and 200 pounds, Bedard told Fox News on Thursday.\n\n\u201cHe was mellow when I caught him. I named him \u2018Cool Hand Luke\u2019 because the gator was so mellow and so cool,\u201d Bedard told Fox News. \u201cHe didn\u2019t try to get away from me, he didn\u2019t try to come after me, he was just really cool. He\u2019s got a real mellow personality.\u201d\n\nFLORIDA BOY, 12, WITH FAILING HEART SCORES TOUCHDOWN: 'THIS WAS SO MUCH BIGGER THAN FOOTBALL'\n\nBedard added that he had not rescued an alligator of this size from a pool in more than a year.\n\nBedard, who said he has been working with alligators for about 30 years, told Fox News the husband of the woman who reported the alligator said he saw it walking across the street when he went to work, \u201cand because it\u2019s Parkland, Florida he didn\u2019t think anything of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen about an hour later the gator decided to walk through a screen and into the swimming pool and the wife was not as accepting of the gator\u2019s presence as the husband was so she made a call to the nuisance alligator hotline and they gave me a call,\u201d Bedard said.\n\nHe documented the rescue in an Instagram post, which included seven photos.\n\n\u201cThese [pool rescues] are actually fun because the gator can't go anywhere and the water's almost always crystal clear,\u201d Bedard wrote in the Instagram post.\n\nSOUTH CAROLINA WOMAN, 68, BIT BY ALLIGATOR WHILE WALKING DOG NEAR POND\n\n\u201cSo all I have to do is jump in the water play around with him until he's tired and I can either hold his mouth shut and put a snare on it and tape it, or if he [sic] super energetic I can get him tired enough where I can just pick him up without the tape and carry him out in the yard and then tape him up once I get there.\u201d\n\nBedard said this alligator didn't give him a hard time, so \u201cI couldn't get him to spin on me he really wanted nothing to do with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI simply made a frontal catch put a snare on his mouth and taped him up,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat finally got him to expend some energy ... I didn't want to pull him out of the water until he was tired, because he'll usually go into a death roll and smash himself up on the concrete or, if he's not taped, bite the concrete or something so it's always better to make him expend that energy in the water where (the alligator) is not going to get banged up.\u201d\n\nBedard said the entire rescue operation, which he categorized as \u201csmooth,\u201d took about 20 minutes. He told Fox News he only felt challenged once he got the alligator out of the pool.\n\n\u201cI had just done a quintuple Ironman, which is a 12-mile swim, 560-mile bike [ride] and then [a] 131-mile run,\" he said. \"So, my legs were still cooked and I didn\u2019t realize how bad my legs were until I picked him [the alligator] up and carried him up the stairs.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cThere were three people watching me so at that point I was committed to it and had to keep going.\u201d\n\nBedard said \"Cool Hand Luke\" has been brought to Everglades Holiday Park in Fort Lauderdale, where he will participate in educational shows.\n\n\u201cI only use real mellow alligators [in the shows]\" he said.", "description": "A Florida man\u00a0who chronicled his\u00a0rescue of a 9-foot-long alligator\u00a0in a series of photos on his Instagram page\u00a0says\u00a0the animal will be used for educational purposes.", "authors": ["Talia Kaplan", "Talia Kaplan Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com.
