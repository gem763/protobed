His bond is set at $1 million.\n\nPolice say Gonzales is cooperating with their investigation, but they have not disclosed whether or not he has revealed a motive for the shooting.\n\nThe shooting occurred around midnight Saturday outside Greenville, 15 miles southwest of a satellite campus of the Texas A&M University System.\n\nAuthorities believe the shooter may have been targeting just one person at the party of about 750 people and that others may have been shot at random.\n\nKevin Berry Jr., 23, of Dallas and Byron Craven Jr., 23, of Arlington were killed in the gunfire.\n\nKevin Berry Jr. (left) and Byron Craven Jr. (right) were both killed in the mass shooting\n\n23-year-old Berry was a father of two young children before he was fatally shot at the college party\n\nThe incident took place at what has been described as a Halloween 'twerk or treat' party for students at Texas A&M University-Commerce, though officials said it was not a school-sanctioned event.\n\nThe party was held at a facility called The Party Venue, along a highway in a rural area around 2.5 miles from the Greenville city limits.\n\nAuthorities believe the shooter entered the venue through the back door and began firing with a handgun.\n\nHunt County Sheriff Randy Meeks described 'complete chaos' after the shots rang out, with hundreds of people fleeing, including the gunman.\n\nBodies are removed from the Party Venue after the mass shooting\n\nGraphic footage from the scene of the shooting showed seriously injured people on the floor with people screaming in the background\n\nVideo from the homecoming shooting was shared on social media with graphic footage purported to show seriously wounded victims lying on the ground as crying and screaming could be heard in the background.\n\n'I just briefly saw one that was a very graphic video,' Meeks told reporters on Sunday.\n\nA patrol sergeant and deputy were at the venue when the shooting occurred, having been called there for complaints about illegal parking. An off-duty Farmersville police officer was also there, working as security for the party.\n\nAuthorities were questioning someone who appeared to be intoxicated when they heard gunshots from the back of the building.\n\nOf the 12 people injured, six were shot and six were trampled or hurt by glass.\n\nAs of Monday, five remained hospitalized, one in critical condition and four in good condition, Meeks said.\n\nThe shooting came as Texas A&M University-Commerce, about 60 miles northeast of Dallas, celebrated homecoming weekend. According to its website, it is the second-largest university in the Texas A&M University System.\n\nHalloween masks litter the ground following the deadly shooting at a college party in Greenville\n\nThe families of the two victims have spoken publicly, expressing their shock over the senseless crime.\n\nCraven Jr's Mother, Brandise, said she would always warn her son to be vigilant when leaving the house.\n\n'Every time he left, I said, 'Be careful. Please be careful,'' she told NBC5.\n\n'There are no words to express the loss,' Bryon Craven Sr told the news network. .\n\nHe added: 'This is not something I want anybody to go through. There's no love for each other'.\n\nMeanwhile, Berry Jr. was a father to two young children aged three and two. '\n\n'We are sad, we are torn apart, my brother was a good person,' his sister Taviara Berry said to NBC5. 'He took care of his family and he loved everybody. He didn't have any enemies.'\n\nAfter a vigil for Berry on Sunday night at a Dallas park, at least one person opened fire. Dallas police said no one was injured but several vehicles were reported.", "description": "Brandon Ray Gonzales, 23, of Greenville, Texas, was arrested less than 48 hours after the shooting at a college party in Greenville.
