Marco Rubio is asking the US government to investigate TikTok over claims it's censoring content that might upset China", "language": "en", "text": "Marco Rubio, the US senator from Florida, has asked the US government to investigate TikTok, the globally popular short-form video app owned by a Chinese company.\n\nRubio wrote on Twitter that there's \"ample and growing evidence\" that TikTok censors content \"in line with China's communist government directives.\"\n\nThe Guardian reported last month on internal documents that show TikTok instructed moderators to censor content addressing political issues likely to anger the Chinese government.\n\nA TikTok spokesperson told Business Insider that the Chinese government does not ask the social app to censor content, and does not have the jurisdiction to do so because TikTok does not operate in China \u2014 its Chinese version of the app is called Douyin.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nUS Senator Marco Rubio is calling on the federal government to investigate the popular video-sharing app TikTok based on \"ample and growing evidence\" that it's censoring content at the request of China.\n\nRubio posted Wednesday on Twitter to share his concerns about TikTok, the short-form video app owned by the massive Chinese tech company ByteDance.\n\nThe senator's request comes just a couple weeks after The Guardian reported on TikTok internal documents that directed platform moderators to censor content that was likely to anger the Chinese government \u2014 namely, videos criticizing China's version of political policies and historical events, such as the Tiananmen Square protests.\n\nRead more: Internal documents showed TikTok censoring topics that would anger China\n\nRubio said he was directing his request to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a federal investigative group housed under the US Department of Treasury that reviews national security implications of foreign investments into the U.S. The committee declined to comment on the matter, citing its policy not to discuss specific cases.\n\nThe investment that Rubio is calling to be reviewed is ByteDance's acquisition of Musical.ly, a now-defunct US-born app that was incredibly similar to TikTok. ByteDance \u2014 a $75 billion company \u2014 bought Musical.ly back in November 2017 in a deal valued at $1 billion. It then shut down Musical.ly a year later in order to merge it with TikTok and launch the app in the US.", "description": "This follows a recent report on internal documents showing TikTok instructed moderators to censor content likely to anger the Chinese government.", "authors": ["Paige Leskin"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9e29f0122bd5736d72f245?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
