We want our dreams, not just our realities, to be represented.\n\nThe same goes for \u201cBlack Panther.\u201d Let me go out on a limb and say that the fictional land of Wakanda isn\u2019t a very representative picture of black life on any continent. What made the film so important, the writer Allegra Frank tells us, is that \u201can entire group of people that look like me\u201d got to be heroes in a big-budget blockbuster. Yes, actors of color are often stars of such movies, but that usually feels like a casting choice, not an indelible feature of the character. It mattered that the characters in \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d not to mention the film\u2019s Afrofuturist vibe, were specifically and not contingently black.\n\nWhat such films deliver is a way of \u201clooking like me\u201d that\u2019s as much about aspiration as identification. We say that their characters look like us; maybe what we mean is that we wish to look like them.\n\nLil Nas X, whose song \u201cOld Town Road\u201d galloped to the top of the charts and set up a homestead there, wasn\u2019t exactly speaking his \u201ctruth\u201d when he rapped, \u201cI got the horses in the back.\u201d A young black man from Atlanta, Lil Nas X had never been on a horse. The \u201cyeehaw agenda\u201d \u2014 the trend of black cultural figures in rancher attire that fueled and was fueled by his country-trap hit \u2014 is chiefly an aesthetic, the cowboy counterpart to the tech-infused offerings of Afrofuturism. It proceeds in defiance of social realism, that default mode of early-stage minority representations. It\u2019s a mash-up of memes, an exercise in cultural unbundling. That\u2019s why Lil Nas X didn\u2019t think twice about releasing a remix with a Korean rapper titled \u201cSeoul Town Road.\u201d\n\nOr consider Tessa Thompson, the mixed-race actor who played the superhero Valkyrie in \u201cThor: Ragnarok.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s really great that young comic book readers that look like me can see themselves in a film,\u201d she said. The Valkyries are an inheritance from Norse mythology, no doubt signal-boosted by the clich\u00e9 of the Wagnerian soprano wearing horns. Should black girls be encouraged to identify with the ultimate Nordic icon? Well, why not?\n\nWhat these fantasies ask is, Who gets to tell you what you look like? It\u2019s not a representation of identity so much as it is a renegotiation of it.\n\nHow identity relates to identification is, of course, a complicated matter. Consider Gurinder Chadha\u2019s recent film \u201cBlinded by the Light,\u201d based on a memoir by the journalist and broadcaster Sarfraz Manzoor. Set in the late 1980s, the film is about a teenager from a Pakistani family in the working-class English town of Luton. His father loses his job at the auto plant; racist hooligans pose a regular menace. Then our protagonist discovers the albums of Bruce Springsteen. The lyrics \u2014 about restive dreams amid disappointment, about a desperation to leave the hardship town of his childhood \u2014 hit him with the force of revelation.", "description": "Minorities can find it gratifying to see people who resemble them onscreen.
