Can you really make the grade?' Can you cut it?' \u2014 What do you do in those instances?\u201d Obama asked, according to The Hill. \u201cAll you can do is put your head down and do the work and let the work, your truth, speak for itself.\u201d\n\nObama added that she is mystified by the concept of discrimination.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t make people not afraid of black people,\u201d she said, according to The Hill. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. I can\u2019t explain what\u2019s happening in your head.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t make people not afraid of black people. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. I can\u2019t explain what\u2019s happening in your head. \u2014 Michelle Obama\n\n\"But maybe if I show up every day as a human, a good human, doing wonderful things, loving my family, loving our kids, taking care of things that I care about \u2014 maybe, just maybe that work will pick away at the scabs of our discrimination. Maybe that will slowly unravel it.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nEarlier this month, a Boston Herald-Franklin Pierce University survey found that Obama would become an instant Democratic frontrunner in New Hampshire if she decided to seek the White House in 2020 \u2013 although she has said there is \u201czero chance\u201d that she\u2019ll enter the race.\n\n\"There are so many ways to improve this country and build a better world, and I keep doing plenty of them,\u201d she told Amtrak's magazine The National this past August, \u201cfrom working with young people to helping families lead healthier lives.
