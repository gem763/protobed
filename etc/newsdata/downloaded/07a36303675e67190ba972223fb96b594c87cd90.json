He struck out three times in Game 1, calling himself \u201chorrible.\u201d Including Tuesday\u2019s home run and a grand slam in Game 4, Bregman has six hits in 26 plate appearances. But because the story of Bregman this October has been both good and bad, that Game 2 also featured a costly fielding error in a seventh inning that saw the Nationals score six runs.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile Soto may not have liked Bregman\u2019s cocky reaction to his home run, Soto isn\u2019t exactly a keeper of baseball\u2019s old-school traditions either, criticized by some for his \u201cSoto shuffle\u201d during at-bats, when he stares down opposing pitchers and occasionally mixes in a crotch grab.\n\nFor a World Series that hasn\u2019t been short on drama, two of baseball\u2019s brightest stars just added a little more.\n\nAlex Bregman carried his bat to first base after homering.\n\n\n\nJuan Soto made sure he did too when he gave the Nationals the lead \ud83d\udc40\n\n\n\n(via @FOXSports)pic.twitter.com/pQigeey6uG \u2014 Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) October 30, 2019\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "If the Nationals didn\u2019t have enough fueling them in an elimination Game 6 of the World Series, that they took exception to Bregman\u2019s antics showed on Juan Soto\u2019s home run in the fifth inning.", "authors": ["Isabelle Khurshudyan", "Reporter Covering The Washington Capitals"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/B_0hVqBxMq8VYo8jzjBs05Jwr8o=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7MSRY4O3J5C6XA55RRGZF7YDXU", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
