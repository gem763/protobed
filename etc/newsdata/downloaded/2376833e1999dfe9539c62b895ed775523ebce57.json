Consumers would have to give their permission before such data could be sold, and they would gain the ability to block companies from monetizing those sensitive insights through targeted ads.\n\nMactaggart\u2019s proposal also includes the creation of an agency in California to enforce privacy protections, along with tougher penalties for mishaps involving children under age 16. And it would require companies to demystify their secret algorithms when such software is used to profile a person, such as determining their employment prospects or their ability to obtain housing, credit cards, loans or other key services.\n\nThe campaign by Mactaggart and his organization, Californians for Consumer Privacy, once again threatens to touch off an expensive, high-stakes war between consumer advocates and well-funded corporations in Silicon Valley and beyond. Many businesses have said that federal regulators, not those in the states, should set a national standard for online privacy. Yet Washington remains paralyzed by indecision, partisan gridlock and industry lobbying, and unable to write widely sought rules protecting privacy even after years of continued scandal.\n\n\u201cPrivacy, I think, demands a greater set of protections,\u201d Mactaggart said in an interview, later adding of the fight to come: \u201cI hope it\u2019s not a situation where we have another $6 trillion market cap opposition\u201d \u2014 a reference to the value of the publicly traded companies his effort targets.\n\nTwo years ago, Mactaggart sought to muscle privacy protections into law much as he is now \u2014 by putting the idea before voters. He said he spent more than $3 million of his own money on a ballot initiative that initially drew sharp opposition from tech giants such as Facebook, Google and Uber, whose privacy abuses inspired Mactaggart to act in the first place.\n\nBut his campaign obtained more than 600,000 signatures, twice as many as he needed to put the matter to a referendum. The strong show of support forced state legislators, tech companies and privacy advocates to broker a compromise on legislation, which they adopted in 2018.\n\nCalifornia adopted the country\u2019s first major consumer privacy law. Now, Silicon Valley is trying to rewrite it.\n\nThose protections under CCPA take effect Jan. 1, having survived an all-out, last-minute assault from Facebook, Google and other corporate giants. The law as it stands will grant Web users the ability to see what information is collected about them and stop that data from being sold, while empowering California\u2019s attorney general to penalize the worst offenders. Tech giants had sought to tweak key elements of the rules before the state\u2019s legislature adjourned Sept. 13, but those efforts failed.\n\n\u201cIndustry wanted a lot,\u201d said Justin Brookman, the director for consumer privacy and technology policy at Consumer Reports. \u201cThey didn\u2019t get a lot.\u201d\n\nEven as he hailed the law, though, Mactaggart stressed in an open letter announcing his new ballot initiative that CCPA \u201cnow seems insufficient,\u201d citing incidents ranging from Facebook\u2019s entanglement with Cambridge Analytica and the security breach at Equifax, a credit-reporting bureau, that exposed more than half of all U.S. adults\u2019 data. He said in an interview that the \u201clandscape has changed dramatically,\u201d warranting another push to grant California residents privacy protections through the ballot box.\n\nSome elements of the proposal won early support from organizations such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation, where Adam Schwartz, a senior staff attorney, said more protections around sensitive personal data \u2014 and the ability to block ads targeting it \u2014 would be a \u201cstep forward.\u201d\n\nBut Schwartz, who said EFF is still reviewing the ballot initiative, said it could have gone further in one respect: allowing consumers to sue when their privacy has been violated. The idea has drawn sharp tech industry opposition.\n\nAlong with privacy, Mactaggart\u2019s proposal also wades into the thorny issue of elections. The initiative would require that businesses disclose if they ever seek to use Web users\u2019 data to shape the outcome of an election. Mactaggart acknowledged his concerns are hypothetical, but he cited recent developments in Washington to make the point that caution is warranted. \u201cWhat we thought were sacrosanct norms can be broken,\u201d he said.\n\nMactaggart still must embark on a lengthy process that begins with collecting signatures, and he estimates that they will need more than 1 million to put the proposal in front of voters next November. If it is adopted, though, it could make it difficult for industry lobbyists to weaken California\u2019s rules in the future: Lawmakers in Sacramento could only make adjustments if it is in \u201cfurtherance\u201d of its stated goal to protect Californians\u2019 privacy, he said.\n\n\u201cMy intention is to go to the ballot,\u201d Mactaggart pledged. \u201cThis human right deserves special status in California law.\u201d", "description": "The activist who spurred the state to adopt the country's first-ever consumer privacy law is pushing an initiative that would be even tougher on big tech companies.", "authors": ["Tony Romm", "Senior Tech Policy Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/qVaq4wFnZJnw24PUDx_RW8VICDY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TODSEFRAC4I6TEKFH52AOC55XE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
