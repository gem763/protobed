Congress wants to know. According to protocol for these kinds of things, they should.\n\nBut that may never happen. Everything about this whistleblower complaint is so outside the procedural norms that there isn\u2019t a recourse for Congress if the administration won\u2019t follow the rules and hand the information over, says Molly Claflin, chief oversight counsel at American Oversight, a liberal watchdog group, and a former Senate aide for Democrats.\n\n[9 questions about the Trump whistleblower complaint, answered]\n\nFirst, the rules: When someone files a complaint with the inspector general for U.S. intelligence agencies, the inspector general determines whether it is credible and urgent. If it matches those descriptions, that person shares it with the corresponding intelligence committees in Congress.\n\nBut the inspector general in this case, Michael Atkinson, told Congress that his boss, Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, isn\u2019t allowing him to share it with the intelligence committees.\n\nThat has Democrats in Congress concerned that people in the highest levels of government are trying to keep this secret to protect Trump.\n\nClaflin said it\u2019s unprecedented for the nation\u2019s top intelligence official to prevent the intelligence community\u2019s watchdog from alerting Congress about what he deems an \u201curgent\u201d and credible complaint. It\u2019s unprecedented for the complaint to be about the president and for the potential retaliation to come from the president or people within his orbit. There just aren\u2019t rules for how Congress can deal with this.\n\n\u201cWhistleblower rules are not set up this way,\u201d Claflin said. \u201cThe idea of whistleblower protection rules is that the agency wants to do the right thing, and there may be a middleman bad actor who is causing problems for employees down the line. But we are dealing with the pinnacle of the U.S. government, the president is the potential retaliator in question here. And that\u2019s a real problem, and I don\u2019t think the laws go anywhere close to being able to deal with that.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot much,\u201d said University of Richmond law professor Carl Tobias in an email to The Fix about Congress\u2019s options. Tobias said they can hold hearings to grill the officials involved. (Maguire will go before the House intelligence committee on Thursday.) They can even cut funding for involved agencies, but that would be tantamount to cutting funding for agencies that keep America safe.\n\nThe member of Congress at the center of this is House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.). His committee questioned Atkinson behind closed doors for hours Thursday, but Atkinson said he wasn\u2019t permitted to share the complaint. Afterward, Schiff threatened legal action against the director of national intelligence, Maguire, alleging he is blocking the information to cover for the president.\n\nSchiff told reporters Thursday that someone \u201cis trying to manipulate the system to keep information about an urgent matter from the Congress. \u2026 There certainly are a lot of indications that it was someone at a higher pay grade than the director of national intelligence.\u201d\n\nSchiff predicted he would have a good case to make in court to get this information and get it quickly because \u201cthe inspector general has said this cannot wait. \u2026 There\u2019s an urgency here that I think the courts will recognize.\u201d\n\nClaflin said asking the courts to step in is probably Schiff\u2019s only option. But she was far less certain this would come out well for Congress. \u201cWhat that looks like and what the outcome would be is so far outside of whatever\u2019s been done before that it is really hard to predict,\u201d she said in a phone interview Friday.\n\nCongress could also try to learn of the complaint through a more roundabout way, by keeping up a public pressure campaign to get Trump to release the transcripts of his July call with the newly elected Ukrainian president.\n\nThe Washington Post has reported the whistleblower complaint centers on Ukraine. The Wall Street Journal reported that, on the call with Ukraine\u2019s leader, Trump \u201crepeatedly pressured\u201d him to investigate former vice president Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter, who has ties to a Ukrainian energy company.\n\nTrump maintains that he did nothing wrong on the call. So why wouldn\u2019t he release it? That could be the argument Schiff and House Democrats make to try to learn publicly the information they were supposed to learn privately.\n\nThat carries with it its own risks that could go far beyond even this: that future government whistleblowers won\u2019t see the point of going through the proper chain of command. Would they stop sharing information at all? Would they share it publicly in a way that could compromise classified information?\n\nRep. Denny Heck (D-Wash.) warned that could lead future whistleblowers to \u201cconsider the Edward Snowden approach\u201d and leak classified information widely instead of to Congress.\n\n\u201cI hope nobody does that because the truth is, that can compromise national security procedures,\u201d Heck said. \u201cBut this precedent creates a perverse incentive for somebody to consider that. The bottom line is, we\u2019re less safe if this law is not applied.\u201d\n\nMeaning: If Congress can\u2019t persuade the Trump administration to share this whistleblower complaint with them, all the rules about whistleblowing could be blown up.\n\nMike DeBonis contributed to this report.", "description": "The rules just aren't set up for something this big.", "authors": ["Amber Phillips", "Reporter For The Fix Covering Congress", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/-tnogj9wgvw9iUx0OO7i9hnYLCI=/1484x0/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/09-19-2019/t_daf9caab87da4aa5af6c17a90ebe298e_name_d8afe63a_db08_11e9_a1a5_162b8a9c9ca2_scaled.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
