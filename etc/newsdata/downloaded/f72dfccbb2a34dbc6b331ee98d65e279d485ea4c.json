Roberts Jr. on Tuesday brushed off accusations of the Supreme Court becoming politicized, instead blaming the criticism \u201con a misperception of the court.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you live in a polarized political environment, people tend to see everything in those terms. That\u2019s not how we at the court function and the results in our cases do not suggest otherwise,\u201d Mr. Roberts said during a speaking engagement at Manhattan\u2019s Temple Emanu-El Streicker Center.\n\nDemocrats have accused the Supreme Court of being motivated by politics. President Trump has also criticized federal courts that have blocked his policies.\n\nWhile the court has a 5-4 conservative majority, Justice Roberts \u2014 who has become the frequent ideological swing vote following former Justice Anthony Kennedy\u2019s departure \u2014 pointed out only seven of the court\u2019s 19 5-4 rulings fell on ideological lines.\n\nThe criticisms of the court\u2019s conservative majority have worried some about landmark decisions possibly being overturned, such as pro-choice activists fighting to keep the abortion protections allowed in Roe v. Wade.\n\nJustice Roberts dismissed those fears, saying he has a respect for precedent, and there is \u201cno reason to suppose that I and my eight colleagues are any better at discerning the meaning of the Constitution than members of the courts that went before us.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
