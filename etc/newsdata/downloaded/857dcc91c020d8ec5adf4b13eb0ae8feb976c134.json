Trump tweeted an hour before the data was released.\n\nTrump had previously promised economic growth of up to 6%, saying just before Christmas 2017: 'The economy now is at 3%. Nobody thought it would be anywhere close. I think it could go to 4, 5, and maybe even 6%, ultimately.'\n\nHowever he has more recently blamed the Federal Reserve for growth staying around 2%, and a fall in growth in the last quarter would have been bad news in the West Wing.\n\nBut while the White House may breathe a sigh of relief, the details also offered a few reasons to gasp.\n\nClaim: Donald Trump's tweet just before the figures were revealed comes despite his promise he could get growth up to as high as 6%\n\nTrump had previously promised economic growth of up to 6%, saying just before Christmas 2017: 'The economy now is at 3%. Nobody thought it would be anywhere close. I think it could go to 4, 5, and maybe even 6%, ultimately.'\n\nRattled by the uncertainty of Trump's trade wars and a global economic slowdown, business investments tumbled the most in nearly four years, according to the report.\n\nThe decline in investments in structures - stores, offices, factories and hotels - accelerated to their second straight double-digit drop.\n\nConsumer spending, a mainstay of the economy, remained solid but slowed ahead of the holiday season, with spending on durable goods like autos and computers cut nearly in half, the data showed.\n\nThe housing sector, meanwhile, was a bright spot.\n\nAfter dragging on the economy for a year and a half, spending on new and existing homes jumped higher as would-be home owners pounced on attractive mortgage rates in recent months.\n\nExports also recovered slightly, posting a modest increase and adding somewhat to growth after tumbling in the second quarter.\n\nA slowing global economy has hit foreign demand for US goods and services, raising fears the world's troubles could wash up on US shores.\n\nThe Fed has rolled back some of the increases in the benchmark lending rate implemented last year when the economy was strengthening, but if GDP growth holds up it makes the decision on the next step more complex.\n\nA minority of voices among Fed policymakers say the slowdown this year is merely the economy cooling back to a more normal pace as the boost from tax cuts and fiscal stimulus fades, which reduces the need for more stimulus.\n\nAnd a key measure of inflation in the GDP report - personal expenditure prices excluding food and fuel - surpassed the Fed's two percent target, rising to 2.2 percent the highest level since the start of 2018.\n\nAccelerating inflation will reinforce the arguments of Fed hawks who oppose further rate cuts but are unlikely to silence Trump's loud demands for stimulus from the central bank.\n\nSome analysts continue to think the economy is poised to weaken further, but others caution that special factors may have be exaggerating the worrisome signs.\n\n'In short, growth has slowed, but it is still not especially weak,' said economist Jim O'Sullivan of High Frequency Economics.\n\nGrounded: The troubled Boeing 737 MAX8 program is now hitting the wider economic growth picture, with business statistics dragged down by the airplane manufacturer having to order existing planes out of service and slow its manufacturing of new ones while regulators prevent them flying after two fatal crashes\n\n'The drop in business investment in equipment is attention-grabbing, but weakness is being exaggerated by Boeing\u00b4s problems.'\n\nGrowth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, slowed to a still-healthy 2.9% rate last quarter after surging at a 4.6% pace in the second quarter, the fastest since the fourth quarter of 2017.\n\nConsumer spending is being powered by the lowest unemployment rate in nearly 50 years. But some economists are starting to question the resilience of the consumer after retail sales fell in September for the first time in seven months.\n\nConsumer confidence has also been trending lower and wage growth is stalling. Income at the disposal of households rose at a 4.5% rate in the third quarter compared to a 4.8% pace in the prior period.\n\nConcerns about the health of the consumer were highlighted by a separate report on Wednesday showing private payrolls increased by 125,000 jobs in October after rising 93,000 in September. Job gains have been slowing this year, but still remain enough to keep up with growth in the working-age population.\n\nTrade tensions are undercutting business investment, which fell at a 3.0% rate in the third quarter, the sharpest contraction in more than 3-1/2 years, after falling at a 1.0% rate in the second quarter. It was pulled down by declines in spending on equipment and nonresidential structures such as mining exploration, shafts and wells.\n\nDesign problems at aerospace giant Boeing have also hurt business investment. The world's largest planemaker last week reported a 53% drop in quarterly profit because of the grounding of its best-selling 737 MAX jets. The planes were pulled out of service in March following fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia.\n\nThe rebound in exports blunted a surge in imports, leading to a narrowing in the trade deficit. Trade subtracted a negligible 0.08 percentage point from GDP growth in the third quarter after cutting 0.68 percentage point in the prior period.\n\nBusiness accumulated inventory at $69.0 billion pace in the last quarter after building stocks at a $69.4 billion rate in the April-June period. Inventories trimmed GDP growth by only 0.05 percentage point in the third quarter compared to 0.91 percentage point in the second quarter.\n\nGovernment spending cooled after rising at its fastest pace in 10 years in the second quarter. Spending on homebuilding rebounded at a 5.1% rate after contracting for six straight quarters, which was the longest such stretch since the Great Recession.", "description": "The steady expansion offered President Donald Trump a measure of relief for his economic agenda, which has failed to produce the three percent growth he touted.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/15/20382052-0-image-a-6_1572449167635.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
