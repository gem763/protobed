(AP) - California is considering tightening the rules for children under 13 using social media.\n\nThe state Senate voted 31-4 on Thursday to require social media companies to first get the consent of a parent or guardian before creating an account for a child the company knows is under 13.\n\nFederal law already requires social media companies to get permission from parents for collecting data children under 13. That\u2019s why most social media companies, including Facebook, already ban children under 13 from creating accounts.\n\nBut the bill moving through the California Legislature would also extend those protections to children creating social media accounts.\n\n\u201cSocial media is powerful, and it\u2019s also very, very dangerous,\u201d Democratic state Sen. Susan Rubio said. \u201cIt is a real threat to our children.\u201d\n\nBut Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener says the bill would harm LGBT youth who live in abusive households by isolating them from others like them.\n\n\u201cThese kids without access to the internet are quickly cut off from any hope of understanding that there is hope for them and that there are people like them in the world,\u201d said Wiener, who is chairman of the California Legislative LGBTQ Caucus.\n\nThe state Assembly still must approve the bill before sending it to Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s desk.\n\nThe bill would give companies several options for verifying parental consent, including getting a signature on a consent form, collecting credit or debit card information from the parent or setting up a toll-free number staffed by people trained to verify the person giving consent is the legal guardian of the child.\n\nFederal regulators have also cracked down on companies who fail to protect kids online. The Federal Trade Commission and the state of New York slapped video streaming site YouTube with a $170 million fine last week to settle a claim that the Google-owned site collected personal information from children without parental consent.\n\nEven though YouTube says it is intended for people ages 13 and older, younger kids often use the site.\n\nYouTube said it will limit data collection on any video aimed at kids, and will promote its YouTube Kids site and app, which require parental consent. The company uses math questions on its YouTube Kids site to verify it is an adult signing in.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press Technology Writer Rachel Lerman contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "California is considering tightening the rules for children under 13 using social media.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Adam Beam"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
