It points to algorithms \u201cdestabilising competition\u201d and possible blowback for banks given the technology could introduce unfair biases, propagating financial disadvantage, and erode human banking skills.\n\nBut at the same time the forum is guiding financial services players on how to implement AI, which it says could ultimately improve the delivery of financial services to customers. A core focus should be policies to explain how decisions are made.\n\n\u201cThe enormous complexity of some AI systems makes it difficult to obtain an interpretable explanation for why the system has produced a given output,\" the report says. \"[But] the ability to interrogate specific aspects of an opaque model\u2019s thought process is critical to informed trust, particularly if bias is a concern.\u201d\n\nNew APRA, ACCC\n\nThe World Economic Forum, which hosts the elite Davos conference in January, predicts AI will fundamentally change the role of prudential supervisors, forcing the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority to monitor broader risks given growing connectivity.", "description": "Banks using AI will be exposed to many new risks, and so will regulators, says a new report published ahead of the Davos conference.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2648%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/2c3096e73a6a98ad0c7850ad379739686c35bb8a", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
