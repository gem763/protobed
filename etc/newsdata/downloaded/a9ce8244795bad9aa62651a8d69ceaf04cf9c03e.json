It retains both its distinctive look \u2013 think 18th-century French punk \u2013 and the environmental activism she embraced decades before it became acceptable, let alone fashionable, in mainstream culture. The Dame herself watched Saturday\u2019s show from the front row, and joined Kronthaler arm-in-arm for a catwalk lap of honour.\n\n\u201cWe have to take sustainability seriously,\u201d said Kronthaler before the show. \u201cI think that is obvious now, no? So I try to be as conscious and as careful as possible.\u201d Much of the raw material for this collection was \u201cfabrics that already exist \u2013 it\u2019s called deadstock, although I think that\u2019s a bit of a strange name\u201d. He worked with Wastemark to collect fabric surplus from top Italian mills, \u201cand mostly I didn\u2019t dye the fabric, just washed it and fitted it\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bella Hadid walks the runway in swimsuit and knee-high socks.

I want each look to be a world of its own.\u201d\n\nAn oversized black net hat with an elegant elongated shape, somewhere between a very chic crocodile mask and an Admiral\u2019s bicorne hat, had in fact been inspired by rowers who Kronthaler saw carrying their upturned boats high above their heads into the Thames, on a visit to Henley. There were references to 1950s pin-ups and to Fellini\u2019s 1976 film Casanova. And there were plenty of party dresses in the classic Westwood style, with opulent layers unpeeling over bare shoulders, waists cinched with a corset, skirts flounced.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest There were plenty of party dresses in the classic Westwood style.

Married since 1993, they have been a de facto design team for much of that time. In 2016, the name of the Paris fashion week show was changed to acknowledge Kronthaler\u2019s contribution.\n\nHe said: \u201cI have reduced the collection to its essence \u2013 if people are going to buy less, then I should be making less \u2013 and then to stretch it into a show I make some pieces with fabric that is dormant around the studio.\u201d A box of scrapped sequins found in a cupboard became an one-off sparkly fish, worn as an enormous hat, and embellishment for a T-shirt dress with the face of a tiger, to support the work of Fauna and Flora International, the world\u2019s first international wildlife conservation organisation, in their mission to protect the critically endangered Sumatran tiger, of which fewer than 400 are estimated to remain in the wild.", "description": "Dame Vivienne\u2019s husband takes top billing in Paris, but the look remains unmistakably Westwood", "authors": ["Jess Cartner-Morley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d137f97fb22914b574a3841ddd4b976896c7f37e/0_11_2347_1408/master/2347.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c144c803412b90820715a9a36d1df9ca", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
