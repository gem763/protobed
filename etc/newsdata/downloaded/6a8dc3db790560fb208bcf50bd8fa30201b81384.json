No more brass\n\nMetallic accents in the home have been a strong look for the past few years - and 2019 was no different.\n\nWhile brass was big this year in fixtures, fittings and accesories, it's no longer a metal considered current.\n\nInterior designer Kendall Wilkinson said the problem was brass now feels 'trendy as opposed to special'.\n\n'We feel like its time has also come to make way for something new,' she told Domain.\n\n2. Palms are now pass\u00e9\n\nAn enduring trend for the past few years has been greenery in the form of myriad potted indoor plants.\n\nThe look was taken even further in 2019 with furnishings featuring a tropical palm print, something seen on bedding, wallpaper and upholstery.\n\nAlessandra Wood, an interiors expert at Modsy, said while she loved palm prints, the 'oversaturated use' made it lose some of its appeal.\n\nIn 2019, palm prints were seen everywhere, something that's made the look passe in the eyes of leading designers\n\n3. Steer clear of neutrals\n\nMinimalism, in various forms, has been huge for the past five years, a look that's extended to decorating spaces in completely neutral tones.\n\nWhile Maggie Griffin of Maggie Griffin Design said 'clean colour palette' is always a great starting point, pattern, colour and texture are a must.\n\n'I'm hoping for more colour, more pattern, and more daring choices,' she told the publication.\n\nIf you want to decorate using neutrals, make sure you add bright pops of colour and create interest through texture\n\n4. Move over millennial pink\n\nMillennial pink, a soft-hued shade, first crested the waves of interior design trends in 2015.\n\nSince then it has endured, however, designers have said it has had its day and it is now well and truly out.\n\nIf you are a fan of pink, consider adding it to the home in 2020's hot new hue: watermelon.\n\nStacy Garcia of Stacy Garcia Inc. said the brighter colour pairs well with shades of clay or terracotta.\n\nWhat are the top five interior trends for 2020? Leading Australian interior designer Darren Palmer (pictured) has revealed the top trends for 2020 According to The Block's Darren Palmer, 2020 is the year homes will sport exposed brick, mosaic tiles and woven furnishings. 1. Mosaic tiles: Darren's recommendation is to use mosaic tiles as a splashback feature behind the sink in the bathroom or kitchen, or to create a small statement feature in the middle of a wall. 2. Rattan furniture: Rattan sofas, headboards and lampstands make a stylish addition to modern living spaces, particularly when paired with clean, straight lines and monochrome colour schemes. 3. Exposed brick: If you feel drawn to a statement wall, make sure you choose exposed brick. The colour of the bricks pairs well with soft greens like mint. 4. Textured chairs and accessories: Darren said there's recently been a new focus on tactility and texture - which translates to furnishings with unusual textures. Think coarse Berber rugs to crushed velvet seating. Source: Darren Palmer via Daily Mail Australia\n\n5. Give accent walls a rest\n\nA statement wall was once considered the height of interior style, however, it is now well and truly out.\n\nNina Magon of Contour Interior Design said the accent wall once added a splash of colour or drama, however, walls sporting this look now seem 'unfinished and non-cohesive'.\n\nShe said modern trends see the use of wallcoverings throughout a space or all walls, including the trim, are painted the same colour.\n\n'This will create a much better impact by creating a cohesive and balanced backdrop for furniture and decor,' she said.", "description": "Top Australian designers have revealed the interior trends you need to ditch in 2020.
