Johnson to warn \u2018back deal or back delay\u2019 as Brexit talks go down to wire", "language": "en", "text": "EU leaders are talking this weekend about Brexit\n\nBrexit talks will continue today between British and EU officials amid rising speculation a deal is on the cards.\n\nThe EU\u2019s chief negotiator Michel Barnier gave the green light yesterday for intensive discussions to begin.\n\nOfficials are attempting to break the deadlock over the Irish border issue and, if successful, the UK could leave the EU on October 31.\n\nToday\u2019s talks between EU leaders come ahead of a crunch European summit on Thursday and Friday (October 17 and 18)\n\nAny new agreement would need to be signed off by all 27 EU member states by then.\n\nBoris Johnson is set to call a vote on Saturday which will determine the fate of the UK (Picture: AP)\n\nOn Saturday, October 19, the UK Parliament will sit at a weekend for the first time in almost four decades.\n\nThis morning there were reports there could be a final Brexit vote during the so-called \u2018Super Saturday\u2019 sitting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to challenge MPs to back any deal secured with Brussels or force through yet another delay.\n\nIf the vote passes, parliament will sit for seven days a week in order to push legislation through both the House of Commons and House of Lords before the end of the month.\n\nA source told the Times: \u2018It\u2019s decision time for MPs.\n\n\u2018They can either back the deal or back a Brexit delay.\n\n\u2018It will be a binary choice.\u2019\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn and his MPs will have a choice to make next week (Picture: PA)\n\nRemain MPs have made a no-deal Brexit illegal and are still said to be planning to try and force through a vote on a second referendum.\n\nIt paves the way for a mass rebellion by Labour and opposition MPs.\n\nLabour have yet to officially comment but MP Peter Kyle, who has hinted at a confirmatory vote being attached to Mr Johnson\u2019s deal, said: \u2018It\u2019s crunch time.\n\n\u2018We are well and truly into the end game.\n\n\u2018This country needs this resolved and parliament is determined to give this the resolution that the country expects.\n\n\u2018We will seek to attach a confirmatory ballot to any deal he brings to the Commons.\u2019\n\nThursday\u2019s talks between Ireland\u2019s Taoiseach Leo Varadkar (L) and Britain\u2019s Prime Minister Boris Johnson appeared to go well (Picture: AFP)\n\nGovernment officials are remaining tight-lipped over an apparent breakthrough on a divorce settlement, in stark contrast to leaks earlier in the week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut there is intense speculation the issue has turned a corner after Thursday\u2019s talks between Mr Johnson and his Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar appeared to go well.\n\nThe unexpected thawing of tensions saw the pair say a deal looked \u2018promising\u2019 although there was \u2018still a way to go.\u2019\n\nTheir vague optimism was matched by European Council President Donald Tusk who said he had received \u2018promising signals.\u2019\n\nIt is understood that Mr Johnson has resurrected plans drawn up by Theresa May for a customs partnership between the EU and the UK.\n\nHe has, however, insisted that Northern Ireland be able to take advantage of any new trade deals that the UK can strike with other nations.\n\nThat would allow the border on the island of Ireland to remain open, something crucial to the Good Friday Agreement that secured peace after four decades of troubles.\n\nIt would essentially mean politically Northern Ireland is in a customs union with the EU but that it would be administered by the UK.\n\nA source familiar with the situation told The Times: \u2018Northern Ireland effectively stays in the EU\u2019s customs union but for the purposes of trade it\u2019s in the UK\u2019s customs union.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a fudge.\u2019\n\nDUP Leader Arlene Foster still needs to give her backing to a deal (Picture: PA)\n\nOn Friday, Mr Johnson said he was adamant he would not do anything that damaged the ability of the \u2018whole of the United Kingdom\u2019 to take full advantage of Brexit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe PM still needs to \u2018sell\u2019 the deal to the DUP, whose support will be crucial if he is to get his deal through a bitterly divided Parliament.\n\nHe also needs to persuade Tory MPs who repeatedly voted against Mrs May\u2019s deal in Parliament, leading to her resignation.\n\nMinisters believe, however, that Mr Johnson is better placed to persuade Eurosceptic Tories and the DUP.\n\nThe DUP have hinted privately they could be supportive but leader Arlene Foster publicly warned they would only agree if the measures were in the \u2018long-term economic and constitutional interests\u2019 of Northern Ireland.\n\nYesterday the pound hit its highest level since Mr Johnson took office and the stock markets rallied amid rising hopes of a breakthrough.", "description": "Brexit talks will continue today between British and EU officials amid rising speculation a deal is on the cards.
