He had been accused of plotting against King James I.\n\nIn 1787, Don Giovanni by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, had its first performance.\n\nIn 1901, Leon Czolgosz was electrocuted for the assassination of President William McKinley inside the Temple of Music at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, N.Y.\n\nIn 1923, following the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, the Republic of Turkey, under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal, was proclaimed from the capitol city of Ankara.\n\nIn 1923, the musical Runnin\u2019 Wild, which introduced the Charleston, opened on Broadway.\n\nIn 1929, the sale of 16 million shares marked the collapse of the stock market, setting the stage for the Great Depression. This day became known as \u201cBlack Tuesday.\u201d\n\nIn 1946, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin responded to United Press questions, saying Winston Churchill is the greatest threat to peace and denying tension growing with America.\n\nIn 1956, Israeli forces, in a plan later found to have been coordinated with Britain and France, invade the Sinai Peninsula, pushing Egyptian forces back to the Suez Canal. The Suez Crisis, which lasted just over a week, would keep the waterway closed from Oct. 1956 until March 1957.\n\nIn 1969, the first connection on what would become the Internet was made when bits of data flowed between computers at UCLA and the Stanford Research Institute.\n\nIn 1971, Duane Allman, guitarist and leader of the Allman Brothers band, died in a motorcycle crash in Georgia.\n\nIn 1994, a Colorado man was arrested after he sprayed the White House with bullets with an assault rifle. U.S. President Bill Clinton was inside at the time but no one was injured. The gunman was sentenced to 40 years in prison.\n\nIn 1998, U.S. Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, who in 1962 became the first U.S. astronaut to orbit Earth, returned to space aboard the shuttle Discovery. At 77, he became the oldest person to travel in space.\n\nIn 2004, Osama bin Laden, in a videotape to the American people, said he ordered the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.\n\nIn 2006, a Boeing 737 crashed near Nigeria\u2019s Abuja airport, killing 96 of the 104 people aboard. Officials said the pilot took off after disobeying an air traffic controller and the plane crashed moments later.\n\nIn 2012, the storm that began as Hurricane Sandy, which had hit several Caribbean countries, made landfall in New Jersey \u2014 after being reclassified as a still-powerful post-tropical cyclone \u2014 and continued on a destructive path in the Northeast. Differing death tolls were reported in subsequent days. Eventually, the National Hurricane Center reported 72 deaths in the United States, 54 in Haiti, 11 in Cuba, three in the Dominican Republic, two in the Bahamas, two at sea, and one each in Jamaica, Puerto Rico and Canada.\n\nIn 2015, China announced it was ending its nearly 40-year one-child policy, allowing couples to have two children without facing punishment.\n\nIn 2018, Lion Air Flight JT-610 crashed into the sea 1 minute after it took off from Soekarano-Hatta International Airport in Jakarta, Indonesia, killing 189 people. It was the first of two crashes of a Boeing 737 Max 8, calling attention to problems with the aircraft that would lead to a worldwide grounding in 2019.\n\nA thought for the day: \u201cThe serious problems facing the world \u2026 will only be solved if women have a seat at the table and are listened to as to what is required. These issues will never be solved until women are able to use their full potential on behalf of themselves, their families and their global and local communities. \u2014 former New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley", "description": "Today is Tuesday, Oct. 29, the 302nd day of 2019 with 63 to follow.
