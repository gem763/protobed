The carrier hasn\u2019t been accused of wrongdoing and received all the necessary regulator approvals to start trading the stock, it added.\n\nThe company\u2019s Lagos head office was raided by the financial crime agency on Friday in connection with the probe, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.\n\nWhile Nigeria is central to MTN\u2019s growth strategy and home to about 60 million of the company\u2019s subscribers, a string of accusations and legal claims by various authorities have weighed on the carrier\u2019s shares. The listing on the Nigerian Stock Exchange was itself a condition of a settlement reached with the telecommunications regulator in 2016 over the handling of customers without proper documentation, while MTN is also fighting a claim that it owes $2bn in back taxes.\n\nSince the listing, MTN Nigeria\u2019s stock has jumped 41%, closing at 140 naira per share on Friday, giving the company a market capitalisation of $7.8bn. That makes the firm the second-biggest listed company in Nigeria, behind only Dangote Cement.\n\nThe Lagos-based bourse said on May 21 that MTN Nigeria\u2019s shares weren\u2019t available for buyers and urged the company to provide more of the stock for investors. Parent company MTN plans to sell some of its majority stake at a later date.\n\nMTN\u2019s shares have declined 55% over the past four years in Johannesburg, largely as a result of Nigerian setbacks. The company is valued at R189bn ($13 billion).", "description": "MTN\u2019s Nigeria listing is being investigated by local authorities, the latest in a series of disputes in the wireless carrier\u2019s largest market.", "authors": ["Anthony Osae-Brown", "Dulue Mbachu"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6819/6a89156ce5ca41f3804691b5c007f482.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-25"}
