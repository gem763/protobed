But he also accused her parents of exploiting that passion. \u201cWhen someone is using children and teenagers in personal interests, it only deserves to be condemned,\u201d Putin said. \u201cI\u2019m sure that Greta is a kind and very sincere girl. But adults must do everything not to bring teenagers and children into some extreme situations.\u201d This is the best summery I've read so far. This child, with zero life experiences is being played. She just doesn't know it.", "description": "Tributes are pouring in on social media after news of MMA fighter Katy Collins's death at the age of 32.
