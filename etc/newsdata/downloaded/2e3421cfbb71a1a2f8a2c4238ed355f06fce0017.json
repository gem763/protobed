But the problem for Argentina is that while they are talking the talk, history shows in this fixture that they struggle to walk the walk.\n\nEngland have won the last nine meetings with the Pumas and are the overwhelming bookmakers\u2019 favourites to make it 10 tomorrow, with Mario Ledesma\u2019s side winning just one of their last 10 Tests against all opposition \u2013 last weekend\u2019s victory over Tonga a welcome respite for a team that that was quickly forgetting what it felt like to win.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

But if you look at across 2019 and take in all results, performances, rankings and the individual players who make up the squad, England have joined that heavyweight division.\n\nIt is why, when he attempted to explain what England\u2019s first real test of the World Cup will be, Eddie Jones chose his words specifically to gee-up his heavyweight forwards.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cArgentina base their game on the scrum,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a test of manlihood so you have to take them on up-front \u2013 scrum, maul, ruck attack, ruck defence. That\u2019s where it will be won.\n\n\u201cEveryone trained really well this morning \u2013 they\u2019re looking fit, fast, brutal and ready to go.\n\n\u201cThere are no last-minute messages. The players are well prepared after a good week\u2019s preparation. They know what to do, now they just have to go out there and do it.\u201d\n\nThe plan is to batter Argentina into set-piece submission, which as we\u2019ve seen in previous games allows George Ford and Owen Farrell to start pulling the strings behind the pack. That takes time to implement, with the energy reserves needing to be drained before such a plan can be effective, and six days on from the frantic and fascinating affair between Wales and Australia, Tokyo Stadium looks set for something far more sluggish.\n\nWhich brings us to Agustin Creevy\u2019s comments in mid-week, specifically that the English rugby structure can be seen as a more boring version of the Argentinian philosophy. It drew mixed responses from the England camp: Jones identified it as a blatant attempt at mind games, assistant coach Scott Wisemantel laughed it off and captain Owen Farrell did his best to ignore it.\n\n\u201cIf I grew tired of it, it would be bothering us,\u201d Farrell said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it is bothering us whatsoever.\n\n\u201cCreevy played at Worcester for a good while, so he was obviously talking about the differences between what his set-up is now, compared to what it was then. But he also said that it worked. I don\u2019t know. It doesn\u2019t cross my mind, when we\u2019re preparing for what\u2019s in front of us.\u201d\n\nSo are England boring? It is a question that stretches back as long as the memory does, an allegation usually generated by the Welsh or French or All Blacks who believe historically that they play a more attractive brand of rugby than the English. That would maybe stick a little more if England hadn\u2019t scored at an average of more than 36 points per game this year \u2013 including putting 32 and 57 points past Ireland.\n\nEngland definitely have a style of rugby that they look to stick to, and through that and the big-pressure moments that have cost them during this four-year cycle it is far to argue if it is the right style, but to claim they are boring is unfair.\n\n\u201cWe obviously have a structure and we play a certain way, but at the same time we want to play what is in front of us, move the ball to space, score tries, kick to the corner and do whatever is on. That\u2019s the way we like to play rugby,\u201d added Farrell.\n\n\u201cOur game is that we are a pretty physical team that can also play. Hopefully we can do things a number of ways.\u201d\n\nEngland will try to use a tight gameplan early before exposing Argentina\u2019s weaknesses \u2013 which despite all of the talk could well prove to be in the scrum. Ledesma has not had long to address what was a problem position in the Rugby Championship, and although there were notable signs of improvement against France and Tonga, neither have been a match for England when playing them this year.\n\nWhat the Pumas do have in their corner though is the undeniable passion that fuels their every move on a rugby pitch. Jones is well aware of this, and though he is never one to shy away from fighting fire with fire, he understands that it is a case of finding the best way possible to use that against Argentina themselves.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t be seduced by Argentina\u2019s state,\u201d Jones added. \u201cWe know they play with a lot of pride and a lot of passion and that will be multiplied by the fact they are in a game that\u2019s very important to them.\n\n\u201cSo that allows us to try and take away their strengths \u2013 it is pretty clear how they will play by the side they have picked \u2013 and then try and attack their weaknesses.\n\n\u201cRugby is a tough physical game. We have seen that already at this World Cup. The passion and pride come down to the toughness of your play. But then there\u2019s emotional control because when you have a lot of passion and pride, it tends to multiply your strengths and multiply your weaknesses.\u201d\n\nEngland would settle for a boring victory on Saturday if it means quarter-final qualification with a game to spare, but expect them to on a number of occasions show that they can play a bit of rugby too. It\u2019s simply about how much they want to show that message, as if they fall into the trap of running it too often or failing to convert penalty kicks to the corner instead of at goal, Argentina are good enough to pick them off, and if they do, the questions of England\u2019s big-game mentality return immediately.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit like a tea bag isn\u2019t it? You don\u2019t know good it is until you put it in hot water,\u201d Jones said. On Saturday, he finally gets his answer.", "description": "If Argentina\u00a0are to remain in this Rugby World Cup\u00a0beyond the pool stage, they are certainly making the right noises.
