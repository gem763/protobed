He was whimpering, screaming and crying,\u201d Trump said, adding that Baghdadi and \u201cthe losers\u201d under his command \u201cwere very frightened puppies.\u201d\n\nTrump even likened his real-time monitoring of the mission to \u201cwatching a movie,\u201d although the overhead surveillance feeds he was viewing during the raid could not display what was happening in the underground tunnel where Baghdadi killed himself and three children \u2014 nor the sounds he was making at the time of his death, according to a report by The New York Times.\n\nTrump\u2019s descriptions of sensitive details regarding the long-planned assault by Army Delta Force commandos also provoked alarm among veterans of previous operations who worried the president\u2019s remarks could imperil future raids and intelligence gathering.\n\nDespite those disclosures, Trump on Monday again defended his decision not to read in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) or other top congressional Democrats on plans for the raid, criticizing House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and his handling of the ongoing impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cThey were talking about, \u2018Why didn't I give the information to Adam Schiff and his committee?\u2019 And the answer is because I think Adam Schiff is the biggest leaker in Washington,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou know that. I know that. We all know that. I've watched Adam Schiff leak. He\u2019s a corrupt politician. He\u2019s a leaker like nobody's ever seen before.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/a3/83/96259f424b7b893d16e3c09e8cd1/191028-trump-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
