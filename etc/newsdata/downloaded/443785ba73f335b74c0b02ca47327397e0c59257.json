It followed two days of talks in Washington between Liu He, China's vice-premier, and US officials.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who described the talks as a \"love fest\", said the preliminary deal would take about five weeks to complete.\n\nHe added that he might sign the deal alongside Chinese President Xi Jinping at a United Nations summit in Chile in December.\n\nHowever, Chinese officials have been more cautious about the outcome, simply claiming there had been progress between the countries.\n\nUS officials also warned last week that tariffs on a different set of Chinese goods, which are due to go into effect in December, remained an option.\n\nStill talking\n\nMr Mnuchin told CNBC: \"I have every expectation if there's not a deal, those tariffs would go in place - but I expect we'll have a deal.\"\n\nThere are still major issues to be negotiated, including industrial subsidies and cybertheft.\n\nMr Mnuchin said more trade negotiations at various levels would take place over the coming weeks, including a phone call between himself, US Trade Representative Lighthizer, and Mr Liu.\n\nDespite the treasury secretary's caution, analysts said it still look as if talks were progressing. \"Investors are trying to wrap their head around this 'non deal',\" said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at SlateStone Wealth, in New York.\n\n\"If (the market) was really sceptical, it would be selling off a lot harder. But it's not because there are some good points to it - that they are still talking and potentially reaching a deal.\"\n\nAsked on CNBC about a dispute between China and the US National Basketball Association, stemming from a tweet by Houston Rockets manager Daryl Morey expressing support for pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, Mr Mnuchin said he hoped the two sides could come to a solution.", "description": "Tariffs on $156bn of Chinese goods will be imposed if a trade deal is not finalised by December, Steve Mnuchin says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/408E/production/_108362561_gettyimages-1143921300.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
