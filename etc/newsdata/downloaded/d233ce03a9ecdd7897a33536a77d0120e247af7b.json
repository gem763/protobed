Really and truthfully, the guys in and around him aren\u2019t doing much.\n\n\u2018Why is he all of a sudden there again? He\u2019s not won the eliminator yet\u2026we\u2019ll see what happens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018But for me, I\u2019ve been there and done it. I didn\u2019t win it in the style I wanted to win it, but I still won the fight.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve made my intentions clear. I only want meaningful fights and fight the other big names of the division.\u2019\n\nWarrington is back in action this Saturday in his hometown, taking on experienced Frenchman Sofiane Takoucht.\n\nWarrington believes he\u2019s cleared out the domestic scene (Picture: Getty)\n\nDespite boasting a 35-3 record, Takoucht is not the name Warrington expected after he beat Galahad.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve cleared out the domestic scene. If I could have things my way I would be fighting a world champion,\u2019 Warrington said, with more than a hint of frustration in his voice.\n\n\u2018Up until I was given the name, I\u2019d not heard too much about him (Takoucht). I\u2019d seen his name in the rankings.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve studied him a little bit and I\u2019ve seen he\u2019s very tough. He\u2019s a pressure fighter and is a southpaw. He\u2019s only lost to high level opposition really.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s never been stopped and got a decent knockout ratio, better than mine actually. People turned down this fight, but he jumped at this opportunity. I imagine he\u2019ll be well up for it.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Warrington the return to Leeds might be slightly bittersweet, but after a disappointing performance against Galahad the Leeds Warrior has gone back to basics.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not that I overlooked Kid Galahad at all, because I never do that, but there were things we didn\u2019t take into consideration,\u2019 he explained.\n\nWarrington expects a big performance from himself against Takoucht (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018I wasn\u2019t happy and his tactics were to spoil the fight, so we went back to basics and how we used to train techniques.\n\n\u2018The last build-up there was a lot of media which seemed to dictate my training more. That affected me in the long run.\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019ll be disappointed with myself if this turns out to be a long points win,\u2019 Warrington insisted. \u2018The way he fights plays into my hands.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ll be looking to send a statement out. I\u2019ll be wanting to finish the fight early.\u2019\n\nTickets for Warrington vs Takoucht on Saturday Oct 12th are available via Ticketmaster.co.uk", "description": "Josh Warrington admitted he was baffled to learn Kid Galahad could be his mandatory again by the end of the year.
