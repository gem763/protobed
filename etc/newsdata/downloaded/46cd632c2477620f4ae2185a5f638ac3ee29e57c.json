But they were too strong, too fearful of outside dominance and, over the course of the war, had built too many institutions of self-rule to be simply folded back into the Syrian state.\n\nAt the same time, the outside world saw Kurdish autonomy as essential to running out the Islamic State, but knew it was, long-term, a barrier to ending the war. Syria\u2019s government would never accept losing the north\u2019s oil and agricultural wealth. Turkey\u2019s government, just across the border, saw permanent Kurdish autonomy as an unacceptable threat.", "description": "The violence precipitated by the American withdrawal is an outcome of tensions that have been building since the conflict began more than eight years ago.", "authors": ["Max Fisher"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/15/world/15int-syria1/15int-syria1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
