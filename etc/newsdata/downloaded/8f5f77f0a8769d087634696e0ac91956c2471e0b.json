That's why tablets for kids exist: so you don't have to worry about handing them your precious iPad, only to find that it breaks the second they drop it. These kid-friendly tablets are often similar to regular versions, except they're often more durable and come with educational apps for kids.\n\n\n\nAt the Good Housekeeping Institute, our lab experts regularly test all kinds of tech and children's products from cribs to toys (many of our engineers are parents themselves!), so you can trust our recommendations.\n\nWhen shopping for a kid-friendly tablet, there are two important things to look for: storage and parental controls. Parental controls allow you to manage how your kid uses the tablet, whether that's limits on screen time or restrictions on content. If you plan on downloading a lot of content (like videos, games, or additional apps), look for a tablet for kids with 16GB of storage or more.\n\nAt what age should you give your child a tablet?\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends avoiding digital media for kids under 18 to 24 months. If you let kiddos watch videos or play games, be sure to do it with them so that they can learn from you. As for kids ages 2 to 5, the AAP recommends limiting their screen time to one hour per day.\n\nWhat's the best tablet to buy for a toddler?\n\nThe best option for toddlers ages 1 to 3 is Fisher-Price's Laugh & Learn Smart Stages Tablet, because it has three different levels so it can grow with your child. It's not a real tech \"tablet\" since you can't download more apps, but it does the trick for the little ones. Our top pick, the Fire HD Kids Edition Tablet, is best for kids ages 3+.\n\nRachel Rothman, chief technologist at the Good Housekeeping Institute, loves how the Fire tablets can use FreeTime Unlimited: a subscription that gives your kids access to tons of age-appropriate content on their Fire tablets, ranging rom TV shows to apps.
