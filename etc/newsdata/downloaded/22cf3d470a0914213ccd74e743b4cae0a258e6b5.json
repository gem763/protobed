They did not announce which ones. Toyota hybrid technology was already being used in a version of the Subaru Crosstrek.\n\nEngineers at Subaru and Toyota will also jointly develop four-wheel-drive vehicles and work together on a redesigned version of the Toyota 86 and Subaru BRZ.\n\nIn addition, the companies will share expertise in the development of self-driving car technology and cooperate on technology that enables cars to communicate wirelessly.\n\nTo cement their deal, each company will acquire more stock in the other. Toyota will boost its shares of Subaru from 16.8% today to at least 20%. It was not immediately clear how many Toyota shares Subaru will acquire.\n\nCars have a problem: They last longer, and that means the insides get grubby and outmoded\n\nConsumer Reports: These are the 10 best cars, SUVs and pickups of 2019\n\nThe deal follows a series of similar collaborations announced throughout the auto industry in which automakers are combining their powers to reduce the costs of vehicle development. For example, General Motors and Honda are working together, Ford and Volkswagen are collaborating, and BMW and Mercedes-Benz maker Daimler are coordinating.\n\nToyota CEO Akio Toyoda praised \"the wonders\" of Subaru's four-wheel-drive system after test-driving the Subaru Impreza, saying in a statement that he \"felt (it) in my veins.\"\n\n\"Our companies, both of which have long pursued driving enjoyment, now want to pursue the possibilities of making ever-better cars suitable for the ... era by bringing together our strengths and by further deepening our relationship,\" Toyoda said.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Toyota, Subaru team up for new BRZ, 86 sports cars, hybrids", "description": "Toyota and Subaru will work together as they aim for a future dominated by electric cars and self-driving technology.", "authors": ["Nathan Bomey", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
