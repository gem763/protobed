At the heart of it all is the unexpected rebirth/return of a guy we\u2019d thought consigned to NFL Films: Richard Sherman, who has transitioned smoothly from Legion of Boom loudmouth to needling, elder-statesman Jedi master. He\u2019s the kind of guy you hate with the fury of a thousand suns \u2026 until he\u2019s on your sideline, and then you\u2019ll run through fire for him.\n\nSherman comes along at an optimal time for these 49ers, a team still coalescing and seeking an identity but with all the parts in place for a run to match the standards of the past. The 49ers of Montana and Young always had a sleek corporate quality about them, striding through the league with an air of relentless blue-chip Masters of the Universe. The Super Bowl 49ers of a few years back existed in a perpetual tug-of-war between Jim Harbaugh\u2019s disappointed-Little-League-dad persona and Colin Kaepernick\u2019s improvisational freestyle; management opted to dump them both, and the result was a long tour along the ocean floor of the NFL standings.\n\nThese Niners? Well, we\u2019re not quite sure yet. Kyle Shanahan is validating his offensive-mastermind rep, Jimmy Garoppolo is still figuring out whether he\u2019s as good as everyone thought he could be in New England, and everyone else is taking turns in the spotlight, like Tevin Coleman\u2019s four (!) touchdowns Sunday in a total decimation of allegedly good Carolina.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\u2018Uncle Sherm\u2019 is back for a second act\n\nStory continues\n\nHere\u2019s what we know. Sherman, dubbed \u201cUncle Sherm\u201d by his much younger teammates, is proving to be a unifying force. He\u2019s not the uncle who embarrasses you at Thanksgiving by braying about politics at the table; no, he\u2019s the uncle who takes you for a ride on his motorcycle after dinner and tells you not to tell your mom.\n\nIt\u2019s a strange marriage, Sherman and the 49ers. For years, Sherman and San Francisco had a hate-hate relationship. He famously smoked Michael Crabtree on national television during the NFC championship in 2014. He ate a turkey leg on the 49ers logo when Seattle beat San Francisco on Thanksgiving later that same year.\n\nBut nothing turns an enemy into an ally like a common foe, and after Seattle cut ties with Sherman in 2018 after injury, both San Francisco and Sherman had chips on their shoulders, people to prove wrong, games to win.\n\n\u201cWhen I go out there, I expect to dominate. I expect to perform at a high level,\u201d Sherman said in 2018 when asked about his goals with the 49ers. \u201cI expect to make my stops, to play my technique, to be where I\u2019m supposed to be when I\u2019m supposed to be there. Outside of that, I expect to be a great teammate and to encourage my young guys when I\u2019m not practicing.\u201d\n\nSherman continues to deliver\n\nTurns out he has done exactly that. Like an old rock star hauled back up onstage for one more go, Sherman\u2019s playing like he\u2019s running wild in the Seattle secondary again. He has three interceptions, his highest total since 2016, and 65 receiving yards, his highest total since 2014. He is getting playing time, too; he has been on the field for 94 percent of San Francisco\u2019s defensive snaps, his highest percentage since the high-90s playoff days of 2012-16 in Seattle. With 23 tackles through seven games, he\u2019s on pace to record his highest tackle total since 2016.\n\nHe has been around long enough to be the NFL\u2019s active leader in interceptions (35, tied with Aqib Talib). But he\u2019ll still go to the wall for a young teammate, like he did last season when he got himself thrown out of the season\u2019s second-to-last game when he started a fight with most of the Bears\u2019 sideline to defend a teammate. That\u2019s the kind of attitude that makes an impression.\n\nHe\u2019s also susceptible to \u2014 or, more likely, lets himself surrender to \u2014 mental tricks, just like a shot-out-of-a-cannon rookie. Niners receiver Dante Pettis may have had some inside intel on Sunday\u2019s game plan, or he may have just been trying to fire Sherman up. Pettis, apparently a friend of Kyle Allen, pulled Sherman aside prior to the game and said, \u201cHey, man \u2014 his plan is just to go at you.\u201d\n\nSherman used that as motivation, intercepting the previously unpicked Allen \u2014 one of three 49er INTs on the day \u2014 and reveling in the complete salt-the-earth destruction of a no-longer-unbeaten quarterback. Here\u2019s what he offered to Twitter on the matter:\n\nAfter the game, Sherman allowed to the San Francisco Chronicle that Pettis might have made the whole thing up to get Sherman going. \u201cHe knows how I am, too. So he could have not known this kid at all and just said that,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he said it, but Pettis said he said it, so it pissed me off.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a turnabout of another infamous Sherman moment from earlier this season \u2014 when he tried to gin up controversy about Baker Mayfield not shaking his hand at the pregame coin flip, even though replays showed Mayfield had done exactly what he was supposed to. Find motivation wherever you can, even if you have to create it out of thin air. It worked for Shaq, who famously created a feud with David Robinson out of a perceived slight that never really happened, and it\u2019s working for Sherman, too.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019ve got to understand,\u201d Sherman said after the Carolina game. \u201cI\u2019m not new to this. I\u2019m true to this. And my 15 minutes [of fame] started an hour ago.\u201d\n\nThe way he and the 49ers are playing, those 15 minutes might last right on through to February.\n\nThese are good days for Richard Sherman.
