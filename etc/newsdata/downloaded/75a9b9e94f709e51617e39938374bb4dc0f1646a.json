The Finnish racer will start from the pit lane after making changes to his Alfa Romeo car. It's been a weekend to forget for him. Welcome to The Independent's live coverage from the Autodromo Nazionale Monza where Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton start on the front row.\n\nPREVIEW\n\nCharles Leclerc put Ferrari on pole position for their home Italian Formula One Grand Prix on Saturday in a qualifying session that ended in farce and with drivers under investigation.\n\nFive times world champion Lewis Hamilton joined the 21-year-old Monegasque on the front row for Mercedes, with Finnish team mate Valtteri Bottas third and Ferrari\u2019s Sebastian Vettel fourth.\n\nThe last lap saw nine drivers cruising around, weaving and braking but with nobody willing to take the lead, and only McLaren\u2019s Carlos Sainz making it to the line in time for a final fast lap. He ended up seventh.\n\n\u201cThat was worse than a junior formula,\u201d a fuming Toto Wolff, team principal of world champions Mercedes, told Sky Sports television.\n\n\u201cThe problem was everyone wants a slipstream and nobody wants to go first...and then everyone looks like idiots.\u201d\n\nStewards summoned drivers after the session but resolved to take no further action, other than issuing reprimands and calling on the FIA to \u201cexpedite a solution to this type of situation.\u201d\n\nAlfa Romeo\u2019s Kimi Raikkonen, the other driver through to the final phase of qualifying and last year\u2019s pole sitter for Ferrari, had earlier crashed at Parabolica -- halting the session for 11 minutes.\n\nWhen the session re-started, with Leclerc on provisional pole after setting the pace before the red flag, there were minutes of inaction.\n\nThat was followed by a sudden flurry, with cars streaming out of the pitlane and jostling for position in a closely-grouped pack.\n\nThe irony of the slowest of qualifying laps at the fastest of tracks, a circuit where slipstreaming can be a huge benefit to lap times, was not lost on Hamilton, who has taken more poles than any driver in history.\n\n\u201cThey basically timed us out,\u201d said Hamilton. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting. Get pole position in the first run and then just time everyone out.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous for us all. There\u2019s people slowing down and you don\u2019t know who\u2019s alongside you and that,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely risky business out there.\u201d\n\nFerrari\u2019s army of fans were left celebrating anyway in grandstands strewn with banners from all over Italy declaring their passion and loyalty.\n\nBIG MESS\n\nThe pole was Leclerc\u2019s fourth of the season and second in a row. The Monegasque will be chasing his second successive victory on Sunday after winning for the first time in Belgium last weekend.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy with the pole but it\u2019s a shame at the end there was a big mess and I hoped our last lap was enough,\u201d said the youngster.\n\n\u201cI think the pace was quite good actually during the race simulations,\u201d he said of Ferrari\u2019s hopes of ending a win drought at Monza dating back to 2010, when Spaniard Fernando Alonso was triumphant.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s looking positive, better than in Spa.\u201d\n\nRenault\u2019s Nico Hulkenberg, who qualified a provisional sixth and behind Australian team mate Daniel Ricciardo in fifth, took some of the heat afterwards for running off track after being first out of the pits.\n\nHe told reporters he had not done it deliberately and made a mistake after concentrating too much on what was in his car\u2019s mirrors.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all looking for a tow,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you drive on your own you lose on the straights and you can\u2019t make up that time. Hence, we ended up with this situation. Of course it was a bit weird and strange.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what happens when everyone starts slowing down and nobody wants to be first in the train.\u201d\n\nRed Bull\u2019s British-born Thai driver Alex Albon qualified eighth, and blamed Hulkenberg for what had happened, while Canadian Lance Stroll will line up ninth for Racing Point.\n\nStroll has always gone well at Monza and qualified on the front row with Williams in 2017.\n\nRed Bull\u2019s Max Verstappen, winner of two races this season, will start at the back of the grid due to engine penalties, along with Toro Rosso\u2019s Pierre Gasly and McLaren\u2019s teenage rookie Lando Norris.", "description": "Charles Leclerc starts on pole at the Italian Grand Prix, his fourth of the season and his second\u00a0in a row, after coming out on top of a farcical qualifying session at Monza.\u00a0 Lewis Hamilton will begin on the front row alongside his Ferrari rival as the Briton looks to tighten the screw on the world title.", "authors": ["Callum Rice-Coates", "Samuel Lovett", "Tom Kershaw"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/08/13/monza-0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
