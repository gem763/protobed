Military personnel stayed nights at Turnberry, spending federal funds for lodging and food that went to the president\u2019s company, both Politico and The New York Times reported.\n\nThe fuel could have been obtained more cheaply at an American military base.\n\nBoth the government-owned Prestwick and Trump\u2019s Turnberry have struggled financially, but their bottom lines have improved since Trump moved into the White House.\n\nPrestwick\u2019s refueling contract with the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) is about to expire. Total payments to the airport since 2017 could total as much $21 million by the time the contract ends, The Scotsman reported.\n\nBut the airport has a new, longer contract beginning October 1 and running through the end of September 2024, the newspaper reported. The value is yet to be determined. But the new deal would involve supplying some 12.4 million gallons of aviation fuel \u2014 about 3 million more than the current deal, according to The Scotsman.\n\nThe House Oversight Committee has spent months looking into the U.S. military activity near Turnberry as part of its investigation into the Trump administration\u2019s potential violations of the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, which forbids presidents from using their office to enrich themselves.\n\nIn a June letter obtained by Politico to acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan, committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) and Rep. Jaime Raskin (D-Md.) called on the Pentagon to turn over documents regarding the military stops. The letter indicated the refueling arrangement may be part of a plan to help keep the struggling Prestwick airport open and aid sales at Turnberry. \u201cU.S. military expenditures at the airport appear to increased substantially since the election,\u201d the lawmakers noted. The Pentagon has so far refused to cooperate with Cummings\u2019 request for documents, a source told Politico.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump pledges to make Prestwick Airport 'really successful'\u201d\n\nhttp://t.co/JZ1dnBqwV1 via @STVNews \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 14, 2014\n\nThe Scottish government is taking heat from the public over Prestwick\u2019s link to the U.S. military as the government-owned airport collects money from the Trump administration while leaders publicly attack the president\u2019s character and his foreign policies, The Scotsman has reported.\n\nThe U.S. military is currently Prestwick\u2019s biggest customer. According to records viewed by The Scotsman, Prestwick was paid $11 million over just six months from last October to March.\n\nSome 64 pages of American procurement records viewed by The Scotsman detail 644 separate orders placed for aviation turbine fuel by the energy division of the DLA, which is located in Virginia and manages the global supply chain for the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force.\n\nPrestwick held discussions in 2017 about \u201cpotential partnership opportunities\u201d and business development targets with Trump Turnberry, according to documents obtained by The Scotsman\u2019s Sunday newspaper. Prestwick is currently up for sale.\n\nThe House Oversight Committee also now plans to investigate Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s stay at Trump\u2019s Irish golf resort during an official visit to Ireland last week, even though the resort was 180 miles away \u2014 on the other side of the island nation \u2014 from planned meetings in Dublin.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee has also said it will look into the president\u2019s suggestion that next year\u2019s G7 summit be held at his Miami golf resort.", "description": "As House investigators probe suspicious refueling stops, the Defense Department has a longer, pricier deal beginning in October, The Scotsman reports.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7438743b0000207fd0c1a0.jpeg?cache=uvftelbwql&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
