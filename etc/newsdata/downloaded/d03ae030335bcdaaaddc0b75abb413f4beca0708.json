His body was found near a school shortly after.\n\nMark told The Mirror: 'We were absolutely devastated to lose Karis, she was an amazing person.\n\n'Our feelings are compounded by grief as we learnt of the ways in which Karis could still be alive today.'\n\nHe added that he was shocked to find out something similar had already happened and questioned how it had been allowed to occur again.\n\nKaris had suffered from depression since she was 13-years-old and had a long history of suicide attempts.\n\nKaris had tried to end her life by jumping onto the tracks at a station in Dagenham the day before she died but the approaching train managed to come to stop and three members of the public helped pull her off the tracks.\n\nKaris had suffered from depression since she was 13-years-old and had a long history of suicide attempts\n\nAn inquest heard that hospital staff were told that Karis had 'an active plan of suicide' and but were not 'receptive' to receiving a handover from the paramedics which stressed their concerns about Karis.\n\nShe was admitted to hospital and assessed the next day. During the 27-minute assessment she told staff she was no longer suicidal but wished that her previous attempt had been successful.\n\nStaff did not see key information from her records and didn't know the full details of what had happened the day before.\n\nKaris' stepfather Mark said she was an amazing girl and that her family was devastated to lose her\n\nShe was discharged at 2.30pm and instead of being taken home in a taxi with a member of hospital staff she caught two buses to Goodmayes Station, where she took her life at 3.28pm.\n\nMark said: 'I had no idea about any of the failures, all I knew that she'd died. It's a terrible nightmare.'\n\nThe family made a formal complaint to the North East London Foundation NHS Trust.\n\nA report found that Karis 'showed clear and unequivocal evidence of suicidal behaviour of the highest risk' and that 'the decision to discharge Karis so soon after the incident was not based on reliable information.'\n\nA trust spokesman told The Mirror: 'We have offered our sincere condolences to Karis' family and friends following the tragic death of Karis.\n\n'We are now in the process of putting the coroner's recommended actions in place and it would not be appropriate for us to comment further at this stage, in view of an ongoing legal claim.'\n\nFor confidential support call the Samaritans on 116123 or visit a local Samaritans branch, see www.samaritans.org for details.", "description": "Karis Braithwaite, 24, from Dagenham, who was a patient at\u00a0Goodmayes Hospital in north east London, had tried to take her life just the previous day.", "authors": ["Amelia Wynne For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/15/19628102-0-image-a-26_1570890024279.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
