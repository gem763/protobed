The home team took a while to get in gear, perhaps due to excessive confidence and insufficient motivation against a division foe predicted to dwell in the cellar.\n\nBut by afternoon\u2019s end at Lincoln Financial Field, normalcy had returned. Philadelphia resembled a Super Bowl contender and the \u2018Skins looked like a candidate for the No. 1 draft pick. The Eagles put Washington in its place and coasted to a 32-27 victory.\n\nThe difference between the first 30 minutes and latter 30 minutes was stark, highlighting the gulf that separates these teams. In a sense, it mirrored last season, when Washington started 6-3 but won just once down the stretch.\n\nThe culprits in 2018 were an injury at quarterback and a collapse by the defense. On Sunday, starting quarterback Case Keenum escaped unscathed but defensive end Jonathan Allen was hurt in the first quarter and didn\u2019t return, while both sides of the ball caved during a second half dominated by Philadelphia.\n\nOf their seven possessions after Allen departed with a sprained left knee, the Eagles scored five times. Making matters worse, backup defensive end Caleb Brantley suffered an ankle injury that ended his day, too, leaving the D-line with just three healthy players.\n\n\u201cThey took our bulls off the field,\u201d cornerback Josh Norman said. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t have that surge up front, (Eagles quarterback Carson) Wentz is just back their freaking and extending drives.\u201d\n\nFor a squad among the league\u2019s most injured in recent seasons, and a medical/training staff facing internal and external criticism, this was a most inauspicious start. But the \u2018Skins did themselves no favors with self-inflicted wounds like penalties and blown coverages, pillars of losing that are all too familiar.\n\nNo one was imagining a defeat when Washington went up 17-0 early in the second quarter. Keenum was gashing the Eagles defense, finding wide-open receivers or hurdling tight ends. The latter was Vernon Davis. He leaped over a would-be tackler en route to a 48-yard touchdown on the game\u2019s opening possession, then was overcome by emotion and thoughts of his grandfather, who passed away on Saturday.\n\nKeenum\u2019s beauty of a 69-yard bomb to rookie Terry McLaurin, and a pair of Dustin Hopkins field goals gave Washington four scores in its first six possessions. They looked like the Maryland Terrapins for a while but couldn\u2019t sustain it once the Eagles realized that the regular season was underway.\n\n\u201cThe game is 60 minutes,\u201d Philadelphia defensive tackle Fletcher Cox said. \u201cWe started kind of flat but got a wake-up call when we were down 17-0.\u201d\n\nThe Eagles executed a sleeper hold after intermission. They maintained possession for 21 of the second half\u2019s initial 27 minutes. Washington was limited to 10 snaps while watching its 20-7 lead deteriorate into a 32-20 deficit. Penalties on offensive linemen doomed Washington\u2019s first three drives of the second half, none of which included a first down.\n\nTruthfully, the end result was pretty as much expected, although Washington\u2019s TD with a half-dozen seconds left allowed it to cover the spread (despite the inability to cover DeSean Jackson). There was plenty of reason for optimism in the locker room \u2014 typical for 0-1 teams that enjoyed modicums of success \u2014 but Washington has been selling confidence and positivity for a long time without much to show for it.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot to like about the offensive performance with Case Keenum and the young receivers,\u201d coach Jay Gruden said. \u201cBut defensively, we have too good of personnel to play like that.\u201d\n\nYou certainly couldn\u2019t tell by the 436 total yards allowed, 123 on the ground. You couldn\u2019t tell by Wentz\u2019s 72% completion rate and 313 passing yards, or Jackson\u2019s eight catches for 154 yards with a pair of long touchdowns.\n\nYou could almost hear the Eagles saying, in Dennis Green fashion, \u201cthe \u2019Skins are who we thought they were!\u201d\n\nBut unlike Green\u2019s Arizona Cardinals, who in 2006 blew a winnable game against a superior Chicago Bears team, the Eagles handled their business as anticipated. The final score is as much a mirage as Washington\u2019s early lead turned out to be.\n\n\u201cI think the 17-0 kind of woke us up, and we knew what we had to do,\u201d Philadelphia coach Doug Pederson said. \u201cWe had to just kind of stay within our game plan.\u201d\n\nFor Washington, it\u2019s back to the drawing board and they have a tough task ahead. Trading places with elite teams like the Eagles won\u2019t be easy.\n\nAnd it can\u2019t be done halfway, either.\n\n\u2981 Deron Snyder writes his award-winning column for The Washington Times on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
