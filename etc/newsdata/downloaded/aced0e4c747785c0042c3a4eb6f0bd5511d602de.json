While the casserole bakes, toast the panko bread crumbs and season them with dill. Serve the chicken with a squeeze of lemon for brightness and a sprinkle of herby bread crumbs for crunch.", "description": "This one-dish dinner is indeed a casserole \u2014 but it\u2019s bright and light, and nearly effortless Toss canned artichokes with capers, garlic and chicken stock, pour over chicken breasts and broccoli florets, then let the oven do the work Canned artichokes are the main flavor builder here so opt for the firmer water-packed variety, which hold their shape better during cooking", "authors": ["Kay Chun", "Colu Henry", "Yewande Komolafe", "Alison Roman", "Melissa Clark", "Claire Saffitz", "Sam Sifton"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/11/dining/kc-chicken-and-artichoke/merlin_151400640_0b036e33-6417-414c-9055-dff9d5e3713d-articleLarge.jpg"}
