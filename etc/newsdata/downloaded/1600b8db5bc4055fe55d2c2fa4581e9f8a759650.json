Perhaps, this occurred because this is the fifth straight quarter of revenue decline, amid a global slowdown.\n\nThe stock's price is the same as it was two years ago, before these missed revenues. While that might suggest that investors are willing to look past slowing growth within a complex global environment, a longer view reveals signs of overall weakness.\n\nIBM Weekly Chart\n\nWhile the current price is flat when compared to two years ago, in December, the price plunged 25%. That selloff formed another trough, reinforcing the downtrend since the March, 2013 top at $216, over 70% higher.\n\nIBM has been fluctuating for the past five weeks, ultimately has made no headway in either direction \u2014 as it struggles to break free of its entrapment between the 200 and 100 DMAs. The levels of fluctuation just happen to be at the same levels as those of the April highs.\n\nIf the price declines from here, it will have formed the right shoulder \u2014 at the same height as the left shoulder \u2014 of a H&S top, with the neckline connecting the May and August lows of the left shoulder and head, at $132.\n\nAs we often point out, the placement of a pattern is crucial to its interpretation. This H&S top is below the 200 DMA and the long-term downtrend line since March 2013, helping to explain why investors might want to stay away from the stock at these levels, at this time.\n\nNote, the volume has been drying out, even amid the post-Christmas-Eve rally.\n\nA downside breakout of the H&S pattern would imply a lower trough, extending the long-term downtrend, and boosting the U.S. slowdown story.\n\nTrading Strategies \u2013 Bear Position Setup\n\nConservative traders should wait for a downside breakout, employing a minimum of a 3% and 3-day (preferably including a weekend) filter, to avoid a bear trap. Then, they\u2019d wait for a return move, which would demonstrate resistance.\n\nModerate traders may wait for the pattern completion, with just a 2% penetration and a 2-day filter. Then, they may wait for a pullback for a better entry but not necessarily for trend confirmation.\n\nAggressive traders may short now, relying on the pattern\u2019s momentum, the low volume, the 200 DMA and the proximity of the long-term downtrend line, after the December trough re-established the long-term downtrend.\n\nTrade Sample \u2013 Short Position Setup\n\nEntry: $142\n\nStop-Loss: $145, above the October high\n\nRisk: $3\n\nTarget: $133\n\nReward: $9\n\nRisk:Reward Ratio: 1:3\n\nNote: A trade sample is just a sample. It\u2019s a rough example of what elements to pay attention to when \u201cplaying the odds,\u201d not predicting an outcome, and is not investment advice but rather a teaching tool.", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Investing.com (Pinchas Cohen/Investing.com) covering: International Business Machines.
