Biden Jr. has unveiled a new government ethics plan and vowed that his family members would do no business overseas during a Biden presidency. His son, Hunter Biden, said he would step down from his role with a Chinese investment firm, and sat for his first television interview of the campaign. And in Iowa, the elder Mr. Biden delivered a fist-pounding diatribe against President Trump, casting him as the embodiment of public corruption.\n\nAltogether, it has added up to the most assertive attempt by Mr. Biden and his camp to extinguish questions about his son\u2019s business activities since Mr. Trump began raising them as a campaign issue, often in false or exaggerated terms.\n\nWhat remains to be seen is whether Mr. Biden can put those issues to rest on a far bigger stage \u2014 at the CNN/New York Times Democratic primary debate in central Ohio on Tuesday night.\n\nAs fierce as Mr. Biden\u2019s efforts have been since the start of the weekend, he has in some ways raised as many questions as he has answered. If his family intends to shun foreign business in the event that he becomes president \u2014 as Hunter Biden said he would on Sunday \u2014 voters may wonder why they didn\u2019t do it far sooner, when Mr. Biden was conducting foreign diplomacy as vice president.", "description": "Mr. Biden in recent days has been more forceful in defending his family and denouncing the president.
