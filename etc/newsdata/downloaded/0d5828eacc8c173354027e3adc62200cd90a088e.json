When the man fainted, he fell forward and knocked her onto the tracks with his head.\n\nSurveillance footage showed the woman fall onto the tracks, appearing to hit her head and fall unconscious.\n\nMoments later, a subway train pulled into the station. The commuters on the platform frantically waved at the train engineer to hit the brakes. The engineer took notice, stopping the train just feet away from where the woman lay on the tracks.\n\nOnce it was safe, several men then jumped down onto the train tracks to pull her to safety. The courageous strangers stayed with her until paramedics arrived to give her medical attention, People Magazine reported.\n\nTrain operator Roxana Elizabeth Flores called the rescue \u201ca miracle,\u201d in an interview with the Telef\u00e9 news channel, according to Spanish-language news outlet La Nacion.\n\n\u201cPeople signaled and I immediately saw the person on the tracks and applied the emergency brake, as the protocol says,\u201d she told the outlet.\n\nThe woman\u2019s husband, Marcelo, told La Nacion that she is starting to become more lucid and can feed herself but is still in shock.\n\n\u201cToday she asked to watch the video [of the incident] and she began to cry,\u201d he said. \u201cShe can\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n\nPolice took the unidentified man in for questioning but later released him.\n\nMarcelo told La Nacion that when he got to the platform, the man had a cut on his forehead. He added that they all rode together in an ambulance, where the unidentified man told him he felt sick at work and fainted while on his way home.", "description": "A crowd of commuters in Argentina saved a woman who was accidentally pushed onto the subway tracks, according to video captured last week.", "authors": ["Katherine Rodriguez"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-518418202-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
