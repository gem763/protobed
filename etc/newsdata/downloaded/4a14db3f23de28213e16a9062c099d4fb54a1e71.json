Stars who have performed it include Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, Dean Martin, Lady Gaga and Tom Jones.\n\nThe song has long been controversial, but has come in for special criticism in the wake of the #MeToo movement that heightened awareness of sexual violence and coercion against women \u2013 particularly the line \u201cSay, what\u2019s in this drink?\u201d, which has been read as a date-rape attempt.\n\nIn 2018, numerous US radio stations took the song off the air. Dean Martin\u2019s daughter criticised the decision, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s a sweet, flirty, fun holiday song \u2026 I know my dad would be going insane right now.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of the controversy, Legend, along with lyricist Natasha Rothwell, has rewritten the song for a duet with Kelly Clarkson. An interview with Legend in Vanity Fair reveals that the new lyrics include: \u201cWhat will my friends think...\u201d \u201cI think they should rejoice.\u201d \u201c...if I have one more drink?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s your body, and your choice.\u201d\n\nThe new version will feature on an updated version of Legend\u2019s 2018 album, A Legendary Christmas, to be released on 8 November.\n\nThe author of the Vanity Fair profile, Karen Valby, describes the original song as \u201cdate-rapey\u201d, and a Salon article in 2012 described it as a \u201cdate rape anthem \u2026 icky at best, at worst reprehensible\u201d.\n\nOthers have read the song as a knowing portrait of a time when women were not allowed to be openly sexual. Writing in Variety in 2018, Chris Willman has described it as \u201cthe story of a woman doing battle \u2013 not with a guy who won\u2019t take no for an answer, but with the expectations of a society that won\u2019t take yes for an answer,\u201d while a 2010 essay by Slay Belle, published by women\u2019s website Persephone, calls it \u201ca song about the desires even good girls have\u201d.", "description": "A new version of the 1944 duet, whose gender dynamics have long been argued over, will appear on Legend\u2019s forthcoming Christmas album", "authors": ["Ben Beaumont-Thomas"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45271fee99d4482a125a7df5c55cefbe96784624/0_264_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=66db3a3c417e32bdb1ec47f71df0e58f", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
