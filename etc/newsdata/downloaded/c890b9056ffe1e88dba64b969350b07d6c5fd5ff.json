Facebook has defended allowing the ad to stay on its platform.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Breaking news: Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook just endorsed Donald Trump for re-election,\" the mock Warren ad states. \"You're probably shocked, and you might be thinking, 'how could this possibly be true?' Well, it's not. (Sorry.)\"\n\n\"But what Zuckerberg *has* done is given Donald Trump free rein to lie on his platform -- and then to pay Facebook gobs of money to push out their lies to American voters,\" the ad continues.\n\n\"If Trump tries to lie in a TV ad, most networks will refuse to air it. But Facebook just cashes Trump's checks,\" the ad states. \"Facebook already helped elect Donald Trump once. Now, they're deliberately allowing a candidate to intentionally lie to the American people. It's time to hold Mark Zuckerberg accountable.\"\n\nAsked about the Warren ad, a Facebook spokesperson told The Hill in a statement on Saturday that the company \"believes political speech should be protected.\"\n\n\"If Senator Warren wants to say things she knows to be untrue, we believe Facebook should not be in the position of censoring that speech,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nRead more here.\n\nMORE ZUCKERBERG: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg defended himself on Monday afternoon after receiving pushback over a report that he has recently held a string of private meetings with conservative politicians, pundits and journalists.\n\nBehind closed doors over the past several months, Politico reported, Zuckerberg has been meeting with top GOP figures including Sen.

Nominal outreach won't cut it.\"\n\nRead more on Zuckerberg's pushback here.\n\nCRITICISM OVER ONLINE EXTREMISM BILL: Civil liberties and technology groups have been sharply critical of a draft bill from House Homeland Security Committee Democrats on dealing with online extremism, saying it would violate First Amendment rights and could result in the surveillance of vulnerable communities.\n\nOver the summer, Democrats circulated an early draft of the bill seeking input from stakeholders, but the proposal received almost immediate pushback. Civil liberties groups want to rework the bill entirely, questioning whether government should play any significant role in identifying and combating online extremism.\n\nDemocrats had planned to mark up the legislation last month, but pulled the bill at the last minute, with a spokesman telling The Hill it was \"not ready.\" The spokesman said the committee is still hoping to mark it up by the end of the month, calling the legislation \"still fluid.\"\n\nThe opposition from civil society groups is another challenge in an already tough legislative path. Democratic lawmakers had already faced concerns from Republicans, who say the bill should scale back its scope.\n\n\"Right now, the Homeland Security Committee's efforts should be narrowly focused on addressing illegal terrorist activity not protected by the Constitution, while ensuring that the First Amendment is respected,\" Rep. Mike Rogers Michael (Mike) Dennis RogersCivil liberties groups sound alarm over online extremism bill Extremists find new home in online app Telegram China cheats \u2014 and we let them MORE (R-Ala.), the ranking member on the committee, said in a statement to The Hill.\n\nThe wrangling over the bill is highlighting how complicated it can be for the federal government to act against online radicalization without running into First Amendment concerns.\n\nAccording to a copy of the bill circulated in September and obtained by The Hill, the National Commission on Online Platforms and Homeland Security Act would create a 12-member commission of experts who would work up recommendations for Congress to address online extremism while taking \"individual privacy civil liberties\" into account. The members would be appointed by Republicans and Democrats in Congress and the president.\n\nBut the government-appointed body would be given the power to subpoena communications, a sticking point that raised red flags for First Amendment advocates concerned about government surveillance.\n\nRead more on the opposition to the bill here.\n\nCYBER KUDOS: Democratic Sens.

SiteLock evaluated cyber awareness based on how integrated cybersecurity was in a candidate's platform, how often the candidate discussed it, and the actions taken in relation to cybersecurity by the candidate.\n\nSome of the factors SiteLock used to make these evaluations were whether a candidate had ever been involved in a data breach, whether campaign email addresses had been found on the dark web, if the candidate had publicly supported legislation on cybersecurity issues and whether the candidate had a published privacy policy on their campaign website.\n\nSiteLock also scanned candidate websites to ascertain how at-risk they were to cyberattacks, finding that 58 percent of the candidates' sites use out-of-date software.\n\n\"Technically, anything short of perfect cybersecurity awareness practices should be viewed as a security flaw because it only takes a single vulnerability to fall victim to a bad actor,\" SiteLock wrote in a blog post announcing the report card findings. \"The fact that not one candidate can be credited with a perfect score proves that cybersecurity awareness is an overlooked issue.\"\n\nRead more here.\n\nA CAN'T MISS HEARING: House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio Peter Anthony DeFazioHere are the Democrats who aren't co-sponsoring an assault weapons ban To stave off a recession, let's pass a transportation infrastructure bill The Hill's 12:30 Report: Trump issues Taliban warning at Sept. 11 memorial MORE (D-Ore.) on Monday sent letters to ride-sharing giants Uber and Lyft warning them not to miss an upcoming hearing.\n\n\"I intend to pursue legislative solutions to address numerous issues plaguing the ride hailing industry, many of which will be raised at this hearing,\" DeFazio wrote in letters to Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi and Lyft CEO Logan Green.\n\n\"These include conditions governing your partnerships with States and local governments and transit agencies, the labor impacts of your business model, and disturbing reports of public safety problems among those who use your platform.
