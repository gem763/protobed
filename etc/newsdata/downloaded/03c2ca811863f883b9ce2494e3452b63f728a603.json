Photo: David Moir/Netflix\n\nSometimes a TV show should not continue beyond its first season. For indisputable proof, look no further than 13 Reasons Why, a Netflix drama about teen suicide that was controversial but often compelling in its first season, and should have ended immediately after that season concluded.\n\nInstead, the first season\u2019s success led to a second and, as of last Friday, a third that devotes its 13 episodes to resolving a mystery only tangentially related to the show\u2019s initial concern of why high school student Hannah Baker killed herself. The question that dominates season three is \u201cWho is responsible for the death of Bryce Walker?\u201d That\u2019s right, Bryce Walker: the serial rapist who raped Hannah and never faced serious consequences for the crimes he committed. Bryce Walker: Perhaps the least liked character on 13 Reasons Why. A classic rich, white, male villain who, in the first two seasons, seemed to have been created based entirely on the following concept: \u201cWhat if Steff from Pretty in Pink, except even more of a dick?\u201d\n\nIn a lot of ways, season three of 13 Reasons Why is a redemption tour for Bryce, played by Justin Prentice, who we learn via flashbacks was, prior to his death, trying to learn from his bad behavior and become a better person, albeit with mixed results. The Bryce through line allows the 13 Reasons Why showrunner, Pulitzer Prize\u2013winner Brian Yorkey, and his writers to double down on what has been a theme in 13 Reasons all along: the idea that everyone is fighting a hard battle that may not be apparent on the surface. In season three, those battles affect multiple characters and involve almost every social issue that currently may affect the youth (and non-youth) of America: bullying, sexual assault, suicide, abortion, steroid abuse, the opioid crisis, gun violence, marginalization based on sexual identity, and the crackdown on illegal immigration. Tossing all of these serious matters into the same slow-cooking, melodramatic stew degrades the importance of each one. It also often turns what is clearly aiming to be an unflinching portrait of contemporary teen life into an unintentional comedy.\n\nTo be more blunt: What I\u2019m really saying is that the third season of 13 Reasons Why is a ridiculous, maddening, overlong example of Peak TV-era television that doesn\u2019t know how to quit when it\u2019s ahead. It irritated me to no end, and here are 13 reasons why.\n\nMajor 13 Reasons spoilers to follow.\n\n1. Ani\u2019s instant friendships with literally everyone\n\nAni (Grace Saif) is brand new to the show in season three, and has just moved to the U.S. from Great Britain. (Her mother is Kenyan.) She starts attending Liberty High School in the months leading up to Bryce\u2019s death. Despite the short time she\u2019s been there, she seems to instantly know every teenager within a 30-mile radius. She becomes very close with Clay Jensen (Dylan Minnette), who, of course, develops a crush on her. (Classic Clay.) She develops a tight relationship with Bryce Walker. (Ani\u2019s mother is the caretaker for Bryce\u2019s ailing grandfather, which means Ani and her mom live with the Walkers, thereby enabling Ani to start having sex with Bryce. Obviously.) She has intimate conversations with Jessica Davis (Alisha Boe) about her sexuality that lead to a vibrator shopping spree. She seems to know Tony Padilla (Christian Navarro) very well, for reasons I cannot fully ascertain. Clearly she\u2019s been added into the mix as a Hannah Baker surrogate: the narrator who knows everybody and is teed up to frame the show\u2019s narrative. But her instant infiltration into everyone\u2019s lives is just jarring and weird. So is her voiceover narration. Speaking of which \u2026\n\n2. Ani\u2019s voiceover narration\n\nI don\u2019t blame Saif for the overbearing, relentlessly repetitive nature of the narration in season three. I do blame the writers, though, for leaning on the narration so hard and making it sound like Deep Thoughts by Jack Handey, except much less insightful and unintentionally funny. \u201cEverything affects everything,\u201d Ani tells us, portentously, in one episode. Wow. When you think about it, that really is true.\n\n3. So much Ani lurking!\n\nIn addition to somehow knowing everyone instantly, Ani also is constantly eavesdropping or shoving her nose into people\u2019s business for the purposes of gaining intel. (Why is she so curious? I watched all the episodes \u2014 I still can\u2019t answer that question!) She\u2019s even worse than Clay in this regard, and that is saying a LOT. Basically, Ani is like every character on Downton Abbey who ever lingered in a doorway to listen to a conversation, all rolled into one high-school student who thinks she\u2019s Veronica Mars for some reason.\n\nSeriously: At one point, during a scene that depicts an argument between Bryce and his parents, the camera suddenly pans across the room to show us this:\n\nPhoto: Netflix\n\nNever forget: Ani is around every corner, listening to everything you\u2019re saying and recording it like the human equivalent of Alexa. I stopped calling her Ani at a certain point and started referring to her as Lurkapalooza 2019.\n\n4. The flashbacks\n\nThe third season includes flashbacks that run on two tracks. Some of the flashbacks unfold before the night of the homecoming game, when Bryce goes missing \u2014 it\u2019s later determined that he was murdered \u2014 and some of them unfold in the wake of Bryce\u2019s death. To distinguish between the two, the first set of flashbacks is depicted in saturated color and the ones post-Bryce-mortem are washed out. At least I think that\u2019s right \u2014 while I initially thought I had this straight, I eventually started getting confused, in part because both timelines contain so many conversations between people raising allegations about other characters, then having additional conversations about who also knows what they know. After a while, it really does blend together into a never-ending stream of, \u201cDo you think he did it?\u201d and, \u201cDo you think he could do it?\u201d and, \u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a good idea, Clay.\u201d\n\n5. The oversimplification of #MeToo\n\nJessica Davis is one of Bryce\u2019s rape victims and publicly comes out as such in season two. In the third season, she goes a step further by running for student-government president on an anti-rape culture and anti-jock platform \u2014 she wins \u2014 and then forms a coalition of assault survivors intent on making their voices heard. That all could serve as a great foundation for exploring the aftereffects of assault and the challenges of getting a student population to engage with that issue. Too often, though, it results in scenes where students stand up in school meetings and shout \u201cFuck rapists!\u201d and an overuse of the phrase \u201ctopple the patriarchy.\u201d (Example: \u201cTurns out this whole \u2018toppling the patriarchy\u2019 thing is really hard.\u201d) The show\u2019s good intentions, unfortunately, translate into dialogue that sounds like it was borrowed from the pages of Wokeness for Dummies. (Note: This is not an actual book \u2026 yet.)\n\n6. The ridiculous number of \u201cissues\u201d\n\nAs noted earlier, this season of 13 Reasons Why goes to town on tackling hot-button topics. By taking on so much, the show does itself \u2014 and each of the issues it tries to address \u2014 a disservice. It also does a disservice to its actors, who are trying their damnedest to find authenticity in moments that often seem anything but authentic. Christian Navarro has some really heartfelt, emotional scenes as Tony adjusts to the news that ICE has taken his parents and siblings away. But since their unjust deportations don\u2019t come up until episode six \u2014 because, like everyone, Tony has secrets \u2014 what should be a meaningful and relevant storyline just feels like the issue that finally knocks over the show\u2019s game of Social Relevance Jenga.\n\n7. All the emphasis on secrets\n\nIn conversations between characters and Ani\u2019s aforementioned voiceover, the show mentions that everyone has secrets constantly. It happens so often that I\u2019m pretty sure American television as a whole has now exceeded its quota on the use of the word \u201csecret.\u201d Like Popeye\u2019s did with its chicken sandwich, TV has completely run out of that word. Maybe \u201csecret\u201d will be back in stock in time for the fall season, but don\u2019t bet on it.\n\n8. Clay generally being an asshat\n\nClay Jensen has always been nosy. He\u2019s always been obsessive to an unhealthy degree. But he\u2019s also always been a character who engenders some amount of empathy. In season three, it gets harder and harder to empathize with him because all he cares about is himself and getting the answers he needs about Bryce. When he finds out that Tony hasn\u2019t told him about his family being taken by ICE, for example, Clay doesn\u2019t initially ask Tony how he\u2019s doing or how he can help. His immediate response is to be pissed that Tony didn\u2019t tell him about what happened sooner. \u201cWe deserve an explanation,\u201d he says, the \u201cwe\u201d in that statement also including Ani, who, I can\u2019t stress this enough, theoretically barely knows these people!\n\n9. Mrs. Baker\u2019s voicemail\n\nWhen the police begin to place their focus on Clay as a person of interest in Bryce\u2019s murder, a voicemail left for Clay by Hannah\u2019s mom, Olivia Baker (Kate Walsh), becomes a potentially important piece of evidence. It turns out the voicemail, in which Olivia says she\u2019d like to kill Bryce (And I \u2026 oop!), was recorded when she was drunk, distraught, and visiting Hannah\u2019s grave. Which is \u2026 weird? I understand why Olivia would be upset and crying and drunk and inclined to reach out to someone. But why reach out to the boy who had an unrequited crush on your daughter? The show never acknowledges the strangeness of this, which makes it even more strange.\n\n10. The fact that there are 13 episodes\n\nIn the first season, it made sense that there were 13 episodes, one for each of the tapes Hannah recorded. Even that season felt longer than it needed to be, but with Jay Asher\u2019s eponymous novel still providing a jumping-off point for the season, structuring it that way made some sense. The subsequent seasons, which have no source material from which to work, have stuck with that model and wow, is there no reason for it at all in season three. Every moment just draaaaags. The whole time I wondered if I might have been less annoyed with some of the tics and flaws in this show if the storytelling was at least more concise.\n\n11. Even the episode titles are freaking long\n\nOkay, maybe this is petty, but even the titles of the episodes on this show \u2014 which are taken from the voiceover narration \u2014 are an affront to brevity. \u201cIn High School, Even on a Good Day, It\u2019s Hard to Tell Who\u2019s on Your Side\u201d? What is that, the name of the next Fiona Apple album?\n\n12. The confusing treatment of Bryce\n\nAs I said earlier, the season goes to great efforts to show other sides of Bryce, as well as the factors in his life that may have led to him becoming an abuser. I wasn\u2019t sure there was enough nuance in that characterization, but nevertheless, it\u2019s clear the writers are trying to demonstrate that even people who do awful things are more complicated and capable of change. So what does the series do in the final reveal of who killed Bryce? After Alex (Miles Heizer), against Jess\u2019s wishes, tries to help an injured Bryce into his car \u2014 Bryce was severely beaten earlier by Zach (Ross Butler) \u2014 Bryce immediately goes off about he\u2019s going to destroy Zach. Basically, he turns back into King of the Assholes, which undoes all the work the show has done up until that point to show us he\u2019s become a better human. I don\u2019t think this is supposed to prove that Bryce is irredeemable. I think this happens purely to justify Alex shoving Bryce into the water to his death and giving us another twist. Which, ugh.\n\n13. And then there\u2019s the whole Monty thing\n\nMonty de la Cruz (Timothy Granaderos), the closeted football player who is publicly aggressive, rude, and homophobic to mask what\u2019s really going on inside of him, becomes the Bryce of season three. He\u2019s the most loathsome character, which is why it doesn\u2019t feel like a bad thing when Alex\u2019s father, Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Bill Standall (Mark Pellegrino), who is fully aware of his son\u2019s role in Bryce\u2019s death, pins the murder on Monty. Why? Because Monty has, in an obscenely brief amount of time, been arrested for using a broomstick to rape Tyler, the student who teetered on the edge of becoming a school shooter in season two, then put in jail, where Monty is killed in his cell. Did the cops have the evidence they needed to charge Monty with either of these crimes? Was there a trial regarding his assault of Tyler? These are questions the show doesn\u2019t bother to answer. After 13 episodes, including a 71-minute (!) season finale, somehow 13 Reasons Why manages to rush a key part of its story. Maybe this is something the show plans to address in season four. But I\u2019m not sure I can take another 13 episodes to get to the bottom of it.
