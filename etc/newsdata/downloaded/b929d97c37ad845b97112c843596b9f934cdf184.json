And the feelings of the players won\u2019t have changed.\n\nI was playing for Villa when we had battled to the semi-finals of the then Coca-Cola Cup, but had been stunned by Tranmere Rovers, losing 3-1 in a poor first-leg display at Prenton Park to a side from a division below us.\n\n\n\nInstrumental in victory: Dean Saunders couldn't play the guitar, but he could score goals\n\nSupport act: Villa fans mob Saunders after the penalty shootout win\n\nWe're Ron our way to Wembley: Big Ron Atkinson celebrates Villa's semi-final win\n\nJust like Paul Lambert\u2019s side, we had not turned up in that first leg and our boss, Ron Atkinson, was absolutely furious. At the time, I was teaching Dean Saunders to play the guitar and he had taken it with him to the team hotel so he could practise there. After the match, Ron decreed: \u2018Everyone back to Bodymoor Heath.\u2019 (Villa\u2019s training ground)\n\nDeano and Macca (Paul McGrath) both lived 30 minutes away from Tranmere, on the Wirral. Double trouble: Shaun Teale and Neil Cox try to stop John Aldridge as Pat Nevin looks on\n\nRoverjoyed: Aldridge celebrates scoring past Mark Bosnich\n\nNet loss: Bosnich is beaten by Mark Hughes in the first leg as Tony Daley (right) looks on\n\nSaunders, now manager of Wolves, voiced his anger at this \u2014 saying it was silly having to drive past his house to get to Bodymoor. Bear in mind it was close to 11pm by this time. \u2018Not my problem you live near Manchester,\u2019 said Ron, whereupon Deano, sitting at the back, slung his kitbag over one shoulder and picked up his guitar, before marching off the bus in protest. He was in a filthy mood and smashed his instrument off the back of every player\u2019s head.\n\nKeep going: The tension mounts in the shootout as Tranmere's Eric Nixon (left) swaps places with Mark Bosnich\n\nIt was about the best noise Deano ever got from that guitar... but Ron was still furious and warned him that he would be fined two weeks\u2019 wages if he got off. Deano did get off the coach \u2014 though I don\u2019t know if he was ever hit in the pocket \u2014 but he was back in the good books when he grabbed the first goal in the second leg with a near-post finish.\n\nShaun Teale\u2019s second put us back on level terms, but John Aldridge then showed he still had a goal in him when he raced clear of our defence and keeper Mark Bosnich brought him down. He slotted home the penalty and we were back behind. It stayed that way until the last few moments when Dalian Atkinson scored. But then Liam O\u2019Brien, who was a bit like Darron Gibson of Everton in that he had a thumping shot on him, curled a great free-kick which hit the inside of a post in injury time. If that had gone in, we would never have had the chance to win the semi-final on penalties \u2014 and then go on to enjoy that wonderful final victory over Manchester United a few weeks later. Show stopper: Bosnich saves a kick in the shootout\n\nAnd I think there are a few pointers from that evening which may help. The atmosphere will go up by about three levels from what Villa\u2019s players have seen before. It will be totally different to what the majority of Bradford\u2019s team are used to as well.\n\nYou can harness that. Villa\u2019s players will need to start strong and get the crowd behind them. The fans will need to be shown that they can turn it around, even if the early goal isn\u2019t forthcoming.\n\n\n\nHowever, while this Villa team have raw enthusiasm, they don\u2019t have the game-management skills that we had. It was an experienced team with the likes of McGrath, Ray Houghton and Kevin Richardson.\n\nBut I can\u2019t stress how important, at the current stage of Villa\u2019s development, winning this tie would be. It would be crucial for survival and could give a stamp of acceptability to their season. It certainly did for us back in \u201994.\n\nSo, I\u2019ll be keeping my fingers crossed. I\u2019m still the last person to lift a trophy for Villa \u2014 in the same competition in \u201996 \u2014 and that\u2019s too long a time to go without winning something. And, as both my lads are Villa fans, I\u2019m hoping they can experience a day out at Wembley of their own.\n\nStronger at the back: Villa will have to defend better against crosses to have any chance in the second leg\n\n\n\nCup of joy: Captain Andy Townsend celebrates Villa's 1994 Wembley win against Manchester United with Tony Daley (right)\n\n\n\n", "description": "I know exactly how those Aston Villa boys will be feeling as they line up in the tunnel before tonight\u2019s game.
