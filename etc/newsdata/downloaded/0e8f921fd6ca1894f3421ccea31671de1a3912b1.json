Rand Paul of Kentucky that would have cut spending levels in the bill by 2%.\n\nThe Senate Appropriations Committee on Thursday was also weighing five full-year 2020 spending bills that would fund programs dealing with the environment, foreign operations, commerce, justice, science, the legislative branch, and homeland security.\n\nThe homeland security bill includes $5 billion in additional money for the wall, which Democrats oppose.\n\nBut Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby said on Thursday if Democrats can\u2019t work out a deal with the president on border security, Congress might ultimately have to pass a full-year \u201ccontinuing resolution\u201d that would essentially keep funding at its current levels through next September.\n\n\u201cThat is not the outcome I am hoping for and, I trust, neither are my colleagues,\u201d said Mr. Shelby, Alabama Republican.\n\nHe said it would be a \u201cshame\u201d to shortchange the military and other agencies, after lawmakers signed off on a two-year budget agreement over the summer that allows Congress to spending about $320 billion more than what had been allowed under law.\n\nSen. Patrick J. Leahy, the top Democrat on the panel, said he wished he could support the homeland security bill but that the additional wall money was a waste of taxpayer dollars and \u201cbad for our country.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not about solving real problems, it is about fulfilling a campaign promise,\u201d Mr. Leahy said.\n\nHe also objected to additional funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention beds, another thorny issue that will ultimately have to be worked out in House-Senate negotiations.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
