Biden said his actions were in line with pressure from other foreign leaders to fire the prosecutor.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t pressing Ukraine to get rid of a tough prosecutor. We were pursuing Ukraine to replace a weak prosecutor who wouldn\u2019t do the job,\u201d Biden said this past Wednesday of an Obama administration policy supported by other Western governments that viewed Shokin as incompetent or perhaps corrupt.\n\nThe U.S. also had support internationally for its opposition to Shokin. Ukrainian officials, including Shokin\u2019s successor, have said since that the Bidens were never implicated in any wrongdoing.\n\nBiden\u2019s \u201cunhinged\u201d comment came amid a challenging weekend for the Trump administration as reports emerged that a second whistleblower \u2013 this one with firsthand knowledge of the phone call between Trump and Zelensky \u2013 has spoken to the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general.\n\nThe first whistleblower was subjected to criticism from Trump and his supporters based on an apparent lack of direct knowledge of the president\u2019s conversation with Zelensky, as well as what Trump has called an inaccurate description of the call.\n\nThe new whistleblower also faced the ire of Trump, who has been even more active on social media over the weekend than normal. Targets of his social-media attacks included House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah.\n\n\u201cThe first so-called second hand information \u201cWhistleblower\u201d got my phone conversation almost completely wrong, so now word is they are going to the bench and another \u201cWhistleblower\u201d is coming in from the Deep State, also with second hand info, Trump tweeted. \u201cMeet with Shifty. Keep them coming!\u201d\n\nBiden held a nine-point advantage over Trump in the crucial swing state of Wisconsin, according to a Fox News poll out Sunday.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBiden bested Trump by nine points (48-39 percent) and had the only lead outside the poll\u2019s margin of error. Bernie Sanders was up by five points over Trump (45-40) and Elizabeth Warren had a four-point edge (45-41). In each case, the remaining 13-14 percent of undecided/third-party voters was enough to shift the race either way.\n\nTrump received 41 percent support or less in each of the matchups -- well below the 47 percent he received when he won Wisconsin in 2016. At the same time, none of the Democrats hit 50 percent.\n\nFox News' Dana Blanton, Adam Shaw and Ronn Blitzer contributed to this report.", "description": "Former Vice President Joe Biden took a shot at President Trump on Sunday, calling him \u201cunhinged\u201d amid Trump\u2019s response to the impeachment inquiry into him and the president\u2019s own allegations of wrongdoing by Biden and his son with Ukraine.", "authors": ["Andrew O'Reilly"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/03/694940094001_6091892155001_6091892796001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
