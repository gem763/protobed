Michael Luttig told The Washington Post.\n\nThe outcome could also guide whether Bolton, who has not been subpoenaed, will face House investigators as part of the impeachment inquiry. Bolton and Kupperman, both represented by attorney Charles Cooper, are important witnesses for Democrats on Capitol Hill. Unlike some of the witnesses who have appeared in the inquiry so far, both have long records as Republican advisers \u2014 and both had access to private deliberations at the White House involving the president\u2019s communications about Ukraine. Democrats on the House Intelligence and Judiciary Committees have expressed keen interest in having both men testify.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHouse Democrats subpoenaed Kupperman Friday, ordering him to appear for a Monday morning deposition, according to the lawsuit. Kupperman\u2019s attorney immediately asked the White House for the president\u2019s position on the document.\n\nIn a letter, White House counsel Pat Cipollone responded that \u201cconstitutional immunity\" protected Trump\u2019s current and former senior advisers and that Kupperman was \u201cabsolutely immune from compelled congressional testimony with respect to matters related to his service as a senior adviser to the President.\u201d The letter ordered Kupperman not to comply with the subpoena.\n\nThe directives have created a Catch-22 for Kupperman, according to the lawsuit: He wants to do his constitutional duty, but needs the courts to step in to tell him exactly what that duty is.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAbsent a definitive judgment from the Judicial Branch,\u201d the lawsuit said, \u201cPlaintiff will effectively be forced to adjudicate the Constitutional dispute himself, and if he judges wrongly, he will inflict grave Constitutional injury on either the House or the President.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe lawsuit noted that the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel has for nearly 50 years held that the president and his immediate advisers can\u2019t be compelled to testify on matters related to their official duties.\n\nBut the filing also cited a 2008 case, related to the George W. Bush administration\u2019s controversial termination of nine U.S. attorneys, in which a federal court ruled that \u201cabsolute immunity\u201d had some limits. In that case, the court found that the president\u2019s counsel was not entitled to absolute or qualified immunity in a congressional inquiry because the inquiry did not \u201cinvolve the sensitive topics of national security or foreign affairs.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThere was ambiguity about how those legal principles applied to the current investigation, the lawsuit stated, forcing Kupperman into a position in which he could potentially break the law.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, an erroneous judgment to abide by the President\u2019s assertion of testimonial immunity would unlawfully impede the House from carrying out one of its most important core Constitutional responsibilities,\u201d the lawsuit read. \u201cOn the other hand, an erroneous judgment to appear and testify in obedience to the House Defendants\u2019 subpoena would unlawfully impair the President in the exercise of his core national security responsibilities.\u201d\n\nKupperman asked the court to expedite the case \u201cin light of the pending impeachment proceedings.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit names Trump and several top House Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who is leading the inquiry.\n\nThe White House didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment late Friday. Neither did Schiff. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) declined to comment on the lawsuit.\n\nAD", "description": "Charles Kupperman, former deputy assistant to the president for national security affairs, filed a lawsuit late Friday asking a federal judge to rule on whether he must comply with a subpoena from House Democrats.", "authors": ["Derek Hawkins", "National", "Breaking News Reporter", "Tom Hamburger", "Investigative Reporter Focused On The Intersection Of Money", "Politics In Washington"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/82ldYmFgDCo1z4HmkmsYsMuRdjI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UGARTZOI4REBLLAB45I7F6NNH4", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
