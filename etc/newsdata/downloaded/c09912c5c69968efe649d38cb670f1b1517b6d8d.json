The clock is ticking\u201d \u2014 EU diplomat\n\nOne senior diplomat said the customs compromise is \u201cstill a big hurdle.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe still have to work on almost everything but meetings have been constructive,\u201d said another diplomat.\n\nThe European Commission also called the talks \u201cconstructive\u201d in a statement after Barnier\u2019s briefing, adding that \u201ca lot of work remains to be done.\u201d Discussions at the technical level will continue Monday and Barnier will brief EU ministers at a meeting on Tuesday, the Commission added.\n\nThe first EU diplomat said the starting position of the next round of talks will be \u201ccomplicated,\u201d especially because it comes right before the EU leaders\u2019 summit.\n\n\"If the British government wants a solution, it must move quickly now. The clock is ticking,\u201d said the EU diplomat.\n\nOne of the remaining obstacles in reaching a deal, according to diplomats, is that the U.K.'s Brexit adviser David Frost has his hands tied when it comes to moving on key issues, like keeping Northern Ireland in the EU customs union and getting the consent of Northern Ireland lawmakers, which London has demanded.\n\nTalks began to show signs of progress last Thursday after a meeting between U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar, leading Barnier to announce Friday the resumption of serious talks. But time is running short to get a deal agreed ahead of the EU leaders\u2019 summit and Brexit day on October 31.\n\nDiplomats say that the possibility of an extension wasn't discussed in-depth at Sunday's meeting but it was mentioned as something that will need to be considered at some point. \u201cAll scenarios are open,\u201d said one of the diplomats.\n\nOn Sunday, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said he would back a further Brexit extension, if the U.K. asks for one. Johnson has promised to take the U.K. out of the EU deal or no deal on October 31, though the British parliament passed legislation to force the government to seek a delay.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s up to the Brits to decide if they will ask for an extension,\u201d Juncker told the Austrian newspaper Kurier. \u201cBut if Boris Johnson were to ask for extra time \u2014 which probably he won\u2019t \u2014 I would consider it unhistoric to refuse such a request.\u201d\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO\u2019s premium Brexit service for professionals: Brexit Pro.
