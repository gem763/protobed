The company\u2019s social media team is dedicating the entire month of October to celebrate Mimikyu, who first made its debut in Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Pok\u00e9mon Moon in November 2016. The company tweeted its plans to pay homage to \u201cthis lonely, terrifying Pok\u00e9mon \u2014 who really just wants to snuggle\u201d all month long, but didn\u2019t suggest what that entails. There could be some cool Mimikyu-related swag (perhaps a new plushie?) or maybe there\u2019s nothing at all beyond a series of loving tweets directed at the ghost-pok\u00e9mon.\n\nThe spotlight\u2019s on you, Mimikyu!\n\n\n\nAll month long, we\u2019ll be celebrating this lonely, terrifying Pok\u00e9mon \u2013 who really just wants to snuggle\u2026\n\n\n\n\u2026forever. #MimikyuMonth pic.twitter.com/jT3rKmpdR3 \u2014 Ghost-type Pok\u00e9mon (@Pokemon) October 1, 2019\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about Mimikyu: its entire life is tragic. No one knows what it looks like, but according to official Pok\u00e9mon lore, the sole person who did get a glimpse of the actual creature \u201cwas overwhelmed by terror and died from the shock.\u201d To counteract the effect Mimikyu has on other people (specifically, death), Mimikyu decided to wear a costume \u2014 it drew a mouth and rosy red cheeks on a dirty old rag so it could look more like a truly beloved pok\u00e9mon, Pikachu.\n\nMimikyu is technically a ghost-pok\u00e9mon, which is perfect for Halloween, but beyond that it\u2019s a sad creature who just wants to be loved. If it takes too much damage in battle and its neck is disfigured, it spends all night trying to fix it, crying.\n\nHeck, this is a pok\u00e9mon whose power move in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is quite literally called \u201cLet\u2019s Snuggle Forever.\u201d If Mimikyu were a song, it\u2019d be \u201cHands Down\u201d by Dashboard Confessional.\n\nI love Mimikyu. I love it so much that I got its costumed body tattooed on my forearm. I\u2019m typing this on a desk with a big Mimikyu plushie (snuggled in close to an even bigger Squirtle). The only Pok\u00e9mon clothing I own are a pair of Mimikyu socks. Part of my adoration for Mimikyu comes from it being obscenely adorable. But I think the idea of what Mimikyu encompasses, this lonely creature who just wants to shower its friends with love and be equally loved in return, is endearing. Mimikyu might start out hating Pikachu in the Pok\u00e9mon anime, but that stems from being jealous of a pok\u00e9mon who knows nothing but love.\n\nIt\u2019s easy for Mimikyu to get lost in a crowd of pok\u00e9mon, especially as the roster expands to include pok\u00e9mon designed around household items like trash bags and house keys, but it deserves to be in the spotlight. Finally, The Pok\u00e9mon Company is giving it that chance.\n\nMimikyu will also be available to catch \u2014 and love \u2014 in Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Pok\u00e9mon Shield on November 15th.", "description": "The Pok\u00e9mon Company is dedicating the entire month of October to celebrate Mimikyu, the ghost-pok\u00e9mon who first made its debut in Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Pok\u00e9mon Moon in November 2016.
