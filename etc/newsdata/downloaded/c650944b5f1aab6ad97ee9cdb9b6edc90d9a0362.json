Big things are coming at Michigan.\u201d\n\nThat statement begs the question: What does Todd\u2019s commitment mean for the Wolverines?\n\nFrom a basketball standpoint, Todd brings the perfect mix of versatility and tenacity that will make him an instant impact player.\n\nAt 6-foot-10, Todd scores efficiently on all three levels, is a strong rebounder and an underrated rim protector.\n\nCHOSEN 25: 2020 boys basketball player rankings\n\nMICHIGAN: Juwan Howard talks up Wolverines at media day\n\nDAILY SPORTS, DELIVERED: Get the best Sports news in your inbox!\n\nIsaiah Todd is headed to Michigan. (Photo: Jason Jordan)\n\nLast season, Todd averaged 28 points and 15 rebounds a game. He was subsequently named ALL-USA Player of the Year in North Carolina. This summer, Todd averaged 18.3 points and 8.4 rebounds a game with NightRydas Elite (Florida) in the Nike EYBL, the most grueling summer shoe circuit in the country.\n\nOff the court, having Todd on board should pay off big for the Wolverines as well because he\u2019s well-liked among other Chosen 25 players and has deep connections with elite players around the country.\n\nSimply put: Todd is a player that other elite players want to play with.\n\nCouple that with the general consensus among elite players at USA Basketball Junior Minicamp in Colorado Springs, Colo., last weekend that Howard was a coach you have to give strong consideration; reasons ranged from love for the \u201cThe Fab Five\u201d documentary to his resume as a NBA player and assistant coach.\n\nTodd\u2019s commitment will likely only heighten the intrigue among other elite players, and he\u2019s not wasting any time trying to capitalize off of that.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve already started coming after a bunch of guys now,\u201d Todd said. \u201cI want to be in the best position to win, and I feel like I\u2019ll be able to get some guys to join us. I think we\u2019ll be fine either way. I believe that much in Coach Howard.\u201d\n\nFollow USA Today High School Sports' Jason Jordan on Twitter @JayJayUSATODAY.", "description": "Michigan basketball took a big step Thursday, locking in the first five-star recruit in the Juwan Howard era with a commitment from Isaiah Todd.", "authors": ["Jason Jordan", "Usa Today High School Sports", "Published A.M.
