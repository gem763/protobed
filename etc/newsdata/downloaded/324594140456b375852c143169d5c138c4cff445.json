On Aug. 30, he was stripped of the industry portfolio, removed as chairman of Aramco on Sept. 2 before being replaced as energy minister on Sept. 8.\n\nBut Prince Abdulaziz, an older half brother of the Crown Prince, is not expected to change the kingdom\u2019s oil and OPEC policies, Saudi officials and analysts say.\n\n\u201cHe will focus on enhancing the relationship within OPEC and with non-OPEC producers to strengthen the stability of the international oil market,\u201d a Saudi official told Reuters.\n\nBassam Fattouh, head of Oxford Institute for Energy Studies and a regular attendee of OPEC meetings, said he believed that the prince\u2019s appointment represents \u201ca continuation of existing policy\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Prince has been a key shaper of Saudi oil and OPEC policy for many years,\u201d said Fattouh, adding that he has also been a key player in domestic oil policy such as the kingdom\u2019s energy pricing reforms, renewables and energy efficiency.\n\nGary Ross, a veteran OPEC watcher and founder of Black Gold Investors, said he first met Prince Abdulaziz in early 1980s.\n\n\u201cThere is no one in the kingdom who knows more about oil than Prince Abdulaziz,\u201d said Ross who said he believed the new minister will stick to production cuts to maximize revenues for Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u201cI expect no policy change - the objective is to deliver higher prices and the IPO for Aramco,\u201d said Amrita Sen, co-founder of Energy Aspects think tank, which closely follows OPEC policies.\n\nFIRST ROYAL\n\nThe prince\u2019s appointment broke with long-held tradition that saw oil technocrats and non-royals overseeing the energy portfolio in the world\u2019s top oil exporter.\n\nSaudi Arabia has had five oil ministers since 1960, and none of them has been a royal.\n\nConventional thinking has been that the ruling Al Saud family has viewed the oil portfolio as so important that giving it to a prince might upset the dynasty\u2019s delicate balance of power and risk making oil policy hostage to princely politicking, Saudi sources and diplomats say.\n\nSome industry insiders say the prince\u2019s lengthy experience has overcome what has always been seen as the impossibility of appointing a royal to the post.\n\nFormer U.S. ambassador Chas Freeman said the prince represents a new phenomenon he called \u201ca royal technocrat\u201d.\n\n\u201cBright, cosmopolitan, expert on the work of the ministry in which he made his career,\u201d said Freeman. \u201cAbdulaziz bin Salman can finally attain the position for which he has been preparing himself for so long.\u201d\n\nPrince Abdulaziz, 59, joined the oil ministry in 1987 and worked closely with previous oil ministers Hisham Nazer and later with Naimi as his deputy for years.\n\nBesides delivering extra budget revenue via higher oil prices, the new minister will also have to foster relations with non-OPEC member Russia, which was instrumental in shaping a deal with non-OPEC producers.\n\nTies between OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia and Russia have developed since 2016 after the producer group and a number of non-member countries formed the so-called OPEC+ alliance.\n\nTwo Russian energy sources said they didn\u2019t expect cooperation to change because both sides are benefiting.\n\nPrince Abdulaziz was also instrumental in formalizing a long-term charter of cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC exporters which was signed by the countries in June, OPEC sources said. He has also been directly involved in talks with the United States to bring nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia.", "description": "When former Saudi oil minister Ali al Naimi crushed oil prices in 2014 by adding to global oversupply, one man in the kingdom stood firmly against this strategy.", "authors": ["Rania El Gamal", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
