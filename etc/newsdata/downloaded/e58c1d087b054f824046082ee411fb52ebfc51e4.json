However, was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is... a swamp in many ways? Yeah.\u201d\n\nThe 49 year old has largely kept out of public view since the launch of the impeachment investigation into whether Mr Trump attempted to push Ukraine to help his re-election campaign.", "description": "Hunter Biden has admitted he exercised \"poor judgement\" over his foreign business dealings in his first public comments since he became a focal point in the impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Rozina Sabur", "Philip Johnston"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/15/TELEMMGLPICT000212910257-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqplGOf-dgG3z4gg9owgQTXPGkjMqXV6CT_ASrwFoxoSc.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
