A few friends and beauty-industry peers told me that the elixir Curology sent them had incredible longterm acne-fighting abilities. One even told me she saw a bigger change after a few weeks of Curology\u2019s regime than she did after the first time she tried Biologique\u2019s cultish P50.\n\nA few weeks into my new, Curology-based routine, I noticed several pros (my dark spots were fading, my hormonal jawline breakouts were nonexistent), and one serious con: My new 4 percent azelaic acid (an ingredient used to unclog pores and smooth textural issues), 4 percent niacinamide (an antioxidant that helps brighten dark spots), and one percent clindamycin (an antibacterial ingredient that helps reduce inflammation and bacterial-triggered acne) Curology treatment cream was severely drying out my skin. And worst of all, my go-to trusty hydrating products, from my Cosrx Hyaluronic Acid to my Snail Mucin, were suddenly no longer working. It was disturbing.\n\nIf any other product did this to my skin, I\u2019d quit using it immediately. But according to the brand\u2019s online dermatologist and my Curology devotee friends, this was all a part of the process \u2014 my skin, everyone said, would soon adjust and then look brighter and smoother than ever. So I continued using it every evening. And began to look for the strongest, most moisturizing product I could find.\n\nI went through a mental list of everything that\u2019s ever been recommended to me for dryness, and suddenly remembered something I\u2019d bought on a whim a couple of months back: Go-To\u2019s Face Hero, a face oil created by beauty editor Zoe Foster Blake. I looked up its ingredients online and found that it was chock full of hydrating nut and seed oils such as arnica, jojoba, and evening primrose oil. That night, I washed my face with Dr. Loretta\u2019s Gentle Cleanser, mixed the Curology treatment in with my Cosrx Hyaluronic Acid and smothered my skin with it, then topped it off the whole thing with a pump of the Go-To Face Hero. When I woke in the morning, before I even looked in the mirror, I noticed my skin felt different. In the week I\u2019d been using Curology, I\u2019d grown accustomed to waking with an uncomfortable tightness around my mouth and jaw. That was gone.\n\nWhen I went to the bathroom to brush my teeth, I noticed that my previously cracked and miserable skin looked bright, nourished, and plump. For the first time in weeks, I was able to put on my Glossier Skin Tint without it pilling. Deeply impressed, I decided to really put the oil to the test: I brought it with me on a short trip to Los Angeles. My face becomes an irritated mess basically the second the plane lands in California, so I figured it would be a good time to see just how powerful this stuff was. I used it every evening I was there, and my skin stayed hydrated for the duration. And it wasn\u2019t just a fluke: The one evening I forgot to put it on, I woke the next morning covered in scaly red patches.\n\nWhich is all to say, while the jury is still out on Curology (I promise to keep you all updated on that journey), it is decidedly in on this face oil: It might just be the most effectively hydrating product I\u2019ve ever tried. I can\u2019t recommend it more.\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
