Because Facebook shared data before 2018, it was fined just \u00a3500,000 - as opposed the millions it could have been landed with today. The Information Commissioner has the power to fine firms who have infringed data regulations. The regulator may issue fines based on the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement. The type of data involved will be considered alongside factors such as how the breach came to light. Facebook was fined the maximum possible for the time the breach occurred. But had it occurred today, the firm could have been fined more than \u00a317million as the General Data Protection Regulation was implemented in May this year\n\nThe ICO also said in its 2018 complaint that the social media company did not take action quickly enough after the misuse of data was discovered in 2015.\n\nThe breach was thought to affect 87 million worldwide users with at least one million people based in the UK. The ICO later found no evidence that any UK user\u2019s data was shared with Cambridge Analytica.\n\nFollowing the ICO\u2019s findings and issue of the penalty in October 2018, Facebook launched an appeal the following month.\n\nIn June 2019, an interim decision was made by the appeal court where the ICO was asked to disclose files about its decision-making process in order to examine potential bias against Facebook.\n\nThe ICO appealed against this decision in September before both parties came to the agreement announced on Wednesday.\n\nBoth appeals will now be withdrawn and Facebook and the ICO will pay their own legal costs. The fine will be paid to the Treasury.\n\nICO deputy commissioner James Dipple-Johnstone said: \u201cThe ICO\u2019s main concern was that UK citizen data was exposed to a serious risk of harm.\n\nCambridge Analytica founder Alexander Nix told the Parliament\u2019s Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee in 2018 that his company had not received data from Facebook\n\n\u201cProtection of personal information and personal privacy is of fundamental importance, not only for the rights of individuals, but also as we now know, for the preservation of a strong democracy.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased to hear that Facebook has taken, and will continue to take, significant steps to comply with the fundamental principles of data protection.\u201d\n\nFacebook director and associate general counsel Harry Kinmonth said: \u201cWe are pleased to have reached a settlement with the ICO. As we have said before, we wish we had done more to investigate claims about Cambridge Analytica in 2015.\n\n\u201cWe made major changes to our platform back then, significantly restricting the information which app developers could access.\n\n\u201cProtecting people\u2019s information and privacy is a top priority for Facebook, and we are continuing to build new controls to help people protect and manage their information.\u201d\n\nThe ICO\u2019s wider investigation into the use of data analytics for political campaigning is ongoing.\n\nFacebook is now able to continue with its own internal investigations into the Cambridge Analytica scandal on the direction of the ICO.", "description": "The UK's privacy watchdog said the tech giant had withdrawn its appeal and would accept the fine without admitting any liability.", "authors": ["Sophie Curtis For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/11/wire-20371562-1572434959-581_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
