The world needs more female economists | Jill Priluck", "language": "en", "text": "This week, MIT\u2019s Esther Duflo became the second female economist to win a Nobel prize. She and her husband, Abhijit Banerjee, also of MIT, and Michael Kremer of Harvard University, shared the award \u201cfor their experimental approach to alleviating global poverty\u201d.\n\nIn Poor Economics: A Radical Rethinking of the Way To Fight Global Poverty, Duflo and Banerjee studied the poor not as \u201ccartoon characters\u201d but as human beings \u201cin all their complexity and richness\u201d. In 2003, they founded the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab at MIT to study poverty.\n\nA coincidence, perhaps, but it\u2019s telling that Duflo collaborates with her husband. For decades, it has been common for female economists to marry fellow economists. The profession has been notorious for its lack of gender parity. It\u2019s the reason we need more female economists like Duflo.\n\nA 2018 American Economic Association (AEA) survey found that nearly 100 female economists said that a peer or colleague had sexually assaulted them and nearly 200 claimed they were the victims of attempted assault. Nearly half of the women surveyed said they had avoided speaking at a conference or seminar because of possible harassment or \u201cdisrespectful treatment\u201d. Seven in 10 women said they felt their colleagues\u2019 work was taken more seriously than their own.\n\nEconomics Nobel prize won by academics for tackling poverty Read more\n\nThe survey was part of a reckoning in economics on the topic of women. The University of California, Berkeley, undergraduate Alice Wu\u2019s 2017 paper on gender bias in the economics job market reported that women are held to higher standards and get less credit for co-authored work. Wu scoured more than a million anonymous posts in online message boards where economists gossiped about hiring. She found that the words most associated with discussions of women included \u201chotter\u201d, \u201chot\u201d and \u201cgorgeous\u201d. Wu\u2019s work led the AEA to address the status of women in the profession, including through the survey and a new code of professional conduct.\n\nEconomists have long held biased views of women. In 1973, a year after Duflo was born, the US Congress Joint Economic Committee held hearings on the economic role of women following a Council of Economic Advisors report. Marina Whitman, then a CEA staff member and University of Pittsburgh economics professor \u2013 who would become a chief economist at General Motors \u2013 testified that \u201cthe economics profession has been slow in developing expertise on the special problems of women\u201d.\n\nThe topic of discussion was a passage in the MIT professor Paul Samuelson\u2019s textbook Economics, published in 1948, about rationing. \u201cOf course, there are always a few women and soapbox orators, who are longer on intuition than brains and who blame their troubles on the mechanism of rationing itself rather than on the shortage,\u201d wrote Samuelson.\n\nThe MIT economist had created a firestorm over remarks in the New York Times that female students at a Virginia women\u2019s college wouldn\u2019t be able to handle extra credit questions in the new edition of his textbook.\n\nSamuelson received letters. Patricia Eames, general counsel of the Textile Workers Union, asked why he had to \u201cgo around making male chauvinist statements\u201d. The Columbia University professor Ann Harris wrote: \u201cYour remark implies a sexual bias and helps to perpetrate the idea that women are no good at mathematics and economics and not much interested in such things anyway. I happen to know several women at Columbia who are economists or are studying to be economists. They find a great deal of male bias and prejudice faces them.\u201d A public apology was offered. In Newsweek, he admitted he made \u201csome derogatory remarks\u201d and apologized to the college and \u201cto the feminine sex in general\u201d.\n\nSamuelson was part of a grand economics tradition of marginalizing women. Economics textbooks included biased representations of fictional characters and under-represented female business leaders, entrepreneurs and policymakers. That tradition is still strong, but we are making strides in seeing women represented more fairly in the field.\n\nThis long history of bias, discrimination and underestimation of women in economics is why Esther Duflo\u2019s prize is a such a great step forward. One can only hope that many more female economists will follow in her footsteps.", "description": "The long history of bias, discrimination and underestimation of women in the field of economics is why Esther Duflo\u2019s prize is a such a great step forward", "authors": ["Jill Priluck"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fca3e448fb2fc60feec5a1a2327be76aa28f099/0_0_4256_2555/master/4256.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=dffab09dea3c668f3a9cd37622b64566", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
