We have no time to lose.'\n\nThe final draft, which has been agreed by countries meeting in Monaco, also warns of damage to fish stocks and seafood which millions rely on.\n\nWhile sea level has risen globally by around 15cm during the 20th century, it is currently rising more than twice as fast, at 3.6 mm per year, and speeding up as Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets melt.\n\nSea levels could rise by around 30cm to 60cm by 2100 even if greenhouse gases are rapidly cut and global warming is kept to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels, but around 60-110 cm if emissions continue to increase, the study said.\n\nRising seas combine with tides or storms to create extreme surges and flooding - and the report warns further warming will mean events that occurred once a century could happen every year by mid-century.\n\nAnnual coastal flood damages are projected to increase 100 to 1,000 times by 2100, and some island nations are 'likely to become uninhabitable' due to climate change, the report said.\n\nThe world's oceans absorb much of the extra heat being generated by global warming and take in a proportion of the emissions of carbon dioxide, making the seas more acidic which can damage sea creatures.\n\nDr Pep Canadell, Chief Research Scientist at CSIRO and Executive Director of the Global Carbon Project said: 'There is absolutely no doubt that we are at a critical point in time of intensification of climate change impacts, and we need to begin deploying strategies for climate change adaptation.\n\n'And above all, greenhouse gas emissions need to peak immediately and come down at a rapid pace if we are to avoid the worse impacts of climate change.'\n\nThe report covers what can be done to alleviate the problems, such as the importance of protecting the oceans and restoring habitats which absorb and store carbon such as sea grass beds in shallow waters.\n\nProfessor Steven Sherwood, Director of the Climate Change Research Centre at The University of New South Wales, said: 'One new thing is that we can now say with some confidence that Arctic sea-ice decline is unprecedented in at least 1,000 years, which is some of the clearest evidence yet that human impacts on climate already dominate over anything natural.'\n\nThe report encountered resistance at the last minute yesterday, with Saudi Arabia bickering over the wording of the executive summary.\n\nThe special report by the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) was finalised in an all-night debate yesterday.\n\nSaudi Arabia had been obstructing the process by taking issue with the inclusion of a report which predicted the effects of a 1.5\u00b0C (34.7\u00b0F) average global temperature rise.\n\nBut the oil-rich nation was finally satisfied last night and the IPCC said it would go ahead with the report about oceans and the cryosphere \u2013 the Earth's icy regions.", "description": "The final draft, which has been agreed by countries meeting in Monaco, also warns of damage to coastal megacities in devastating annual events.", "authors": ["Joe Pinkstone For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/25/10/18868972-0-image-a-4_1569402884338.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
