(Daniel Acker/The New York Times)\n\nINDIANOLA, Iowa \u2014 Just a half-block off the old courthouse square here lies a handsome storefront with bunting and a vintage sign that reads \u201cWarren for President.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a field office for Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who along with Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, is one of only two Democratic candidates with a brick-and-mortar presence in this college town 30 minutes south of Des Moines.\n\nWarren and Buttigieg have broken away from the Democratic pack with the most field offices overall in the four early states, and they are making an expensive bet that organizational strength on the ground will catapult them to crucial top finishes in Iowa\u2019s first-in-the-nation caucuses. Their ground games give them more workspaces for organizers and volunteers. More organizers lead to more in-person contact with potential supporters in every nook and cranny of a state.\n\nAnd in Iowa, where picking a candidate is akin to a religious conversion following extended evangelism from a supporter, a strong and broad organization is often the backbone of a winning campaign.\n\nThe offices also serve as an advertisement that Democrats do still exist in more rural areas, like Indianola, that swung to President Donald Trump in the 2016 election. Surrounding Warren County, which former President Barack Obama carried in 2008, went for Trump in 2016 by 16 percentage points.\n\nIn a 19-way race in which three candidates, or at the most four or five, will emerge as viable options out of Iowa, the locations of field offices reveal clues about their strategies.\n\nEvery first-tier candidate is represented in the state\u2019s delegate-rich urban centers, like Des Moines and Cedar Rapids. But Sen. Amy Klobuchar has an office in Clear Lake, a northern Iowa town where voters get their news from TV stations in Minnesota, her home state. Former Vice President Joe Biden has a cluster of offices in far southeast Iowa, an old union stronghold that swung hard to Trump in 2016.\n\nWhile Warren\u2019s Indianola office is a brief walk from the local high school and Simpson College, Buttigieg\u2019s is a mile up the road in a strip mall alongside Pizza Ranch, a chain ubiquitous in rural Iowa that is popular with social conservatives.\n\n\u201cI just tell people we\u2019re by the Pizza Ranch,\u201d said Stephen Dee, the Warren County organizer for the Buttigieg campaign.\n\nAt the Buttigieg office this week, Marcia Peeler sat on the floor, calling her friends and family to ask them to think about backing the 37-year-old\u2019s candidacy.\n\nPeeler, a 59-year-old public relations professional, had never volunteered for a political campaign before walking into the Buttigieg field office in Indianola Tuesday night. How she got there helps explain the value in Buttigieg having more field offices in Iowa than any Democrat in the 2020 race.\n\nA registered Republican who caucused for John Kasich in 2016, Peeler was resolved to vote against Trump in 2020 but hadn\u2019t latched onto any of the Democrats running. Then in August she got a cold call from Dee, 30, who this summer quit his corporate law job in New York to move to Indianola and work for Buttigieg. Dee had gotten Peeler\u2019s number from someone at her church.\n\nAlong with Indianola, the two campaigns are also the only ones with field offices in Republican-leaning rural areas such as Clinton, a Mississippi River town in a county that swung 28 percentage points from Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016. In Fort Dodge, where Trump did 27 points better than Obama, Buttigieg, Warren and Biden are the only campaigns to have offices.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the Warren office in Indianola teemed with retirees and students from Simpson College, texting neighbors to ask if they will caucus for Warren, and an 11-year-old girl who came with her father to fold Warren literature into envelopes for canvassers who would later knock on doors for the campaign.\n\nIt\u2019s the candidates, not the field organizers, that generate excitement for the campaigns. But if a campaign doesn\u2019t already have a credible early-state field program in place, they are nearly out of time to create one, said Jon Carson, who was the field director for Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign.\n\n\u201cTo barnstorm in now in mid-October and say you\u2019re going to build up a whole office strategy now doesn\u2019t work,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you have been laying an infrastructure, that can work.\u201d", "description": "INDIANOLA, Iowa -- Just a half-block off the old courthouse square here lies a handsome storefront with bunting and a vintage sign that reads \"Warren for President.\"It's a field office for Sen.
