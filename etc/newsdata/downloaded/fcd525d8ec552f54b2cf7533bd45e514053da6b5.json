The company has also sent out invitations for a September 10th event, at which the media expects an announcement for new iPhones and maybe pricing details for its subscription television service.\n\nLot's of excitement and details to focus on but let's take a deep breadth and check out the charts for this Real Money Stock of the Day.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of AAPL, below, we can see that some of our technical indicators weakened in the past month. Prices have moved sideways to slightly higher testing the cresting 50-day moving average line.\n\nTrading volume has declined and the On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has moved sideways.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is barely above the zero line with the two moving averages that make up the indicator right on top of each other. This suggests little in the way of \"trend strength\".\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of AAPL, below, we can see a weak set-up. Prices are above the slightly rising 40-week moving average line. Trading volume has declined.\n\nThe weekly OBV line has been soft the past four months and the MACD oscillator has narrowed towards a bearish crossover.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of AAPL, below, we can see a potential upside price target of $247 but we can also see that a trade at $199.42 will probably weaken this chart.\n\nBottom line strategy: Remembering the Wall Street adage that it is not the news that is important but rather how a stock reacts to the news, I would take a defensive position with AAPL this month.", "description": "Let's check the charts for this Stock of the Day....AAPL", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Weakness In Apple Could Gain Traction In September", "Let'S Check The Charts For This Stock Of The Day.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Eric Jhonsa", "Kevin Curran", "Timothy Collins", "Bob Lang"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/0f99ec60-ca79-11e9-848d-c32afef302b7.jpg"}
