Simple things like spelling mistakes, an unusual sender address or a request for money or personal details in the email all indicate that it may be fraudulent and therefore should be reported to the bank directly\n\n'It is not necessary to know every detail about PSD2, but a basic awareness of why it exists and the topics it covers will help protect you.'", "description": "Almost a quarter of people believe that recent changes, which mean those logging into online banking must provide a second layer of authentication, are banks combating cybercrime.", "authors": ["George Nixon For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
