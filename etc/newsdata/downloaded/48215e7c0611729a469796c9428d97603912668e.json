I\u2019m going to take this further\u201d before walking out of the inquest.\n\nShe didn\u2019t want to say anything further to Devon Live following the hearing.", "description": "An inquest heard how a consultant believed the timing of Peter Heard's stroke to be a coincidence and felt the surgery did not play a part - however a coroner did describe the timing as 'suspicious'", "authors": ["Lee Trewhela", "Image", "Google"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20752483.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Anne-Heard.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
