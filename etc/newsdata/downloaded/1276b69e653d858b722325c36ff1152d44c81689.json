The Pixel 4 comes in three new colors: white, black, and a limited-edition orange option. It goes up for preorder today, and ships October 24th. The Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL will be sold by every major US carrier. The regular Pixel 4 starts at $799.\n\nThe Pixel 4 XL has a 6.3-inch Quad HD display, while the 5.7-inch Pixel 4\u2019s screen is 1080p. Both feature a 90Hz max refresh rate for ultra-smooth scrolling and responsiveness, but the refresh rate automatically adjusts to the usual 60Hz in some circumstances (where you wouldn\u2019t even notice) to optimize battery life.\n\nIn the top bezel area of the Pixel 4, Google has housed a number of sensors that enable a new feature called Motion Sense, which allows the Pixel 4 to be controlled with hand gestures \u2014 no touching the phone required. This utilizes Google\u2019s Project Soli technology. With Motion Sense, you can do things like control music or dismiss an incoming call with a wave of your hand near the phone\u2019s display. Motion Sense processing happens locally on device, and Google noted that the feature can be disabled at any time.\n\nIntroducing Google #pixel4, our most helpful phone yet. Built around the Google software you know and love that you won't find on any other smartphone. #madebygoogle pic.twitter.com/JZxU2phmcW \u2014 Google (@Google) October 15, 2019\n\nFor this year\u2019s camera system, Google has added a telephoto portrait lens beside the standard primary rear camera. The telephoto lens offers 2x zoom through a hybrid of optical and digital focus, according to Google.\n\nThe new Pixels arrive just as Apple has finally caught up to Google\u2019s camera performance, with some believing that the new iPhone 11 offers superior picture quality. Even on the Android side, companies like Huawei have steadily chipped away at Google\u2019s once-significant camera advantage. Aside from adding a secondary rear camera for the first time, Google is also adding new software tricks and improving existing modes like Night Sight. Live HDR+ offers a real-time look at the picture you\u2019ll get after Google applies its image processing. There\u2019s also a new shadows slider if you want more control over what HDR is doing, and Google says it has improved white balance in all photo modes.\n\nThe Pixel 4 also introduces a new Recorder (voice memos) app that automatically \u2014 and very quickly \u2014 transcribes what\u2019s being said using Google\u2019s speech recognition. This being a Google product, you can search through all past recordings for a particular word. And again, all of this happens on the device itself without help from the cloud.\n\nDeveloping.
