Video footage showed him dressed in shorts and a t-shirt as he was brought out on a raft along with his family members.\n\nSaket Kumar Singh, who lives in the city's Boring Road area, said he was stranded for four days, with about two feet of water inside his house.\n\n\"There was no electricity and, despite having money, I was helpless,\" Singh, 45, said.\n\nIn neighbouring Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, heavy rains have brought down more than 800 homes and swaths of farmland are submerged.\n\nData released by the federal home ministry shows that, as of September 29, 1,673 people have died because of floods and heavy rains this year.\n\nOfficials said that many of these deaths were caused by wall and building collapses, including in Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra, the western state that has seen 371 flood-related deaths in 2019, the highest in the country.\n\n\"The danger of old or weak structures collapsing increases during the heavy rainfall, like what happened this time,\" Chandrakant Sharma, a flood expert with Uttar Pradesh's disaster relief department, told Reuters.\n\nIndia's flood prevention and forecasting systems are lacking, other experts say, even as the total flood-prone area in the country has increased in recent decades because of deforestation, degradation of water bodies, and climate change.", "description": "Data released by the federal home ministry shows that 1,673 people died because of floods since June.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/2/d8ffc70d8e7644afae67eb87738e2660_18.jpg"}
