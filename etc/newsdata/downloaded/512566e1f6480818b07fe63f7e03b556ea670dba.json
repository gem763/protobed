The Washington teen was accused of plotting to kill her ex-boyfriend Ryan Vaughn\n\nHadley's classmates and co-conspirator Jeremiah Cunningham testified against her at trial\n\nSurveillance video shows Cunningham wearing a red mask and drawing a kitchen knife from his jacket on the day of the planned attack\n\nAfter failing to lure Vaughn to his death, Cunningham headed to school, still wearing his red mask (pictured above)\n\nAuthorities say Vaughn never went behind the store after seeing a person in a red mask, later identified as Cunningham, lurking nearby, reported Tri-City Herald.\n\nOther students riding scooters in the area noticed suspicious activity and alerted authorities.\n\nDuring Hadley's week-long trial, prosecutors argued that the teen was angry at Vaughn for breaking up with her and concocted the murderous plot to get back at him.\n\nAppearing as a witness for the prosecution, Cunningham described Hadley as the 'lure and leader' of the murder plot, but admitted that he was the one whose job it was to stab Vaughn.\n\nCunningham who, like Hadley, was 16 years old at the time, told the court that he was supposed to ambush Vaughn from behind, trip him, plunge a large kitchen knife into his chest, and then drag his body into a nearby ditch.\n\nCunningham and Hadley, who had been friends since grade school, dated for a short time, and the young man said he still had feelings for the girl at the time of the botched murder plot.\n\nHadley took the stand in her own defense on Friday, telling the jury that someone hacked her Facebook account and sent multiple messages to Vaughn asking him to meet her behind the Ki-Be Red Apple Market to talk.\n\nHadley claimed someone hacked her Facebook account and sent Vaughn messages asking him to meet with her. She also said it was Cunningham who wanted Vaughn dead\n\nShe also argued that it was Cunningham who came to her saying he was angry with Vaughn and wanted to kill him, but she did not believe him and thought he would just beat him up.\n\nBut another classmate testified that Hadley once bragged that her 'boyfriend' was going to murder Vaughn as a birthday present.\n\nIt took jurors less than three hours to convict Hadley on Monday evening. The teenage defendant showed no emotion when the guilty verdict was announced.\n\nHadley remains in custody on $100,000 bail pending her sentencing hearing, which is expected to be scheduled in the next month.\n\nCunningham and Pfliger pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit first-degree murder and second-degree assault with a deadly weapon, respectively.\n\nCunningham, who was charged as an adult, was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Pfliger, who was charged as a juvenile, was sentenced to 30 days in jail and community service.", "description": "Fe Hadley, from Washington state, was convicted on Monday of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder in a November 2017 planned attack on her ex-boyfriend Ryan Vaughn.", "authors": ["Snejana Farberov For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/20/20345072-0-image-a-2_1572380941488.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
