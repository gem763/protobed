We thought this time was the time we turned the corner. He had a DUI conviction about 12 or 13 years ago that he finally got off his record,' Rosbach said.\n\n20 years: 'We spent 20 years, every night, waiting for the phone call saying either he was in jail or that he was dead,' Rosbach said\n\n'He'd got himself a car.

We moved a couple of different times,' he said, 'Those moves weren't easy on Josh.'\n\nHe added that his son broke his feet after a nasty car accident, and he was given prescription painkillers.", "description": "Below Deck star Lee Rosbach is opening up about his son Josh's death from an accidental opioid overdose.", "authors": ["Brian Gallagher For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/07/19679204-0-image-a-108_1571034450380.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
