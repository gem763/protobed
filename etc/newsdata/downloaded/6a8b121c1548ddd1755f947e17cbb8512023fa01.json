Shares were sold in the days and weeks after the results as investors wanted to rid their portfolios of the stock.\n\nThe company missed on earnings, revenue and same-store sales. Worse, management cut its outlook for each of the three metrics as well. The insider selling from April suddenly made a bit more sense.\n\nBut Cramer noticed an interesting development after this brutal decline.\n\nFirst, some of those insiders have started buying again, and unlike selling, there's only one reason to buy: Because they think the stock will go back up.\n\nFurther, the stock has begun to rebound recently, but slipped 2% on Thursday. Cramer said he believes the rebound is real and that investors who like the name should consider buying a portion of their desired allocation now and more on a deeper decline.\n\nIt's true the stock has a slower growth rate than before, but Ulta is still doing well as a retailer in this environment. However, its valuation now looks a lot more attractive than it did earlier this year, he reasoned.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of ULTA, below, we can see the sharp downside price gap (price void) and the recent partial recovery. The u-turn in prices in September does not look all that different than the reversal back in December but that is where the comparison stops in my mind.\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line did not turn up in September as it did in December and January.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator went to a lower low from back in December so it did not show us a bullish divergence.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of ULTA, below, we can see the sharp decline but the way this chart is constructed we do not see the price gap. Prices are holding the prior low of December but we don't have much confidence in it as this low has not been retested.\n\nThe weekly OBV line shows a quick uptick but the MACD oscillator is still very bearish.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of ULTA, below, we can see that the software has projected a relatively nearby price target of $274. Not all that far from current levels. That is not to say that ULTA cannot rise any further but it is saying that some technically oriented traders may not be willing to push it much higher than $274.\n\nBottom line strategy: Our Point and Figure chart (above) suggests that ULTA can trade higher but the rest of our charts are not constructive and the combination is going to keep us sidelined for now.", "description": "Let's check the latest charts and indicators of ULTA to see if it is showing improvement....ULTA", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Ulta Beauty Could Trade A Bit Higher But A Quality Base Has Not Yet Developed", "Let'S Check The Latest Charts", "Indicators Of Ulta To See If It Is Showing Improvement.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Guy Ortmann", "James", "Rev Shark", "Bret Jensen", "Carolyn Boroden"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/8ff8c4e6-b409-11e7-b31e-0f25eb71d019.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
