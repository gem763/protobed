The scene\u2019s subreddit\u2014where a large portion of community news is shared and broken\u2014is filled to bursting with pro-blitzchung and anti-Blizzard sentiments. One of the moderators, citing dissatisfaction with Blizzard\u2019s response to the blitzchung incident, has stepped down from his role. Since then, the blitzchung ruling has become the Hearthstone community\u2019s elephant in the room, with silence on the matter becoming increasingly difficult to maintain. Now, after a period of soul-searching, responses have begun to flood in from some of the most visible members in the scene.\n\nEarlier this week, the streamer and Hearthstone esports shoutcaster Brian Kibler published his own thoughts on the matter in an extensive blog post. While he voiced understanding toward Blizzard\u2019s decision to act on the politicization of one of their broadcasts, he expressed concern that Chung\u2019s punishment\u2014in this case a one-year suspension and revocation of prize money\u2014greatly outweighed the crime. To end his blog post, Kibler announced that he would not be casting the Grandmasters finals at BlizzCon, an event that\u2019s scheduled to happen later this month. \u201cI will not be a smiling face on camera that tacitly endorses this decision,\u201d Kibler said in his post. \u201cUnless something changes, I will have no involvement in Grandmasters moving forward.\u201d\n\nKibler\u2019s decision is noteworthy because it\u2019s the first to come from the most visible quotient of the Hearthstone community\u2014the streamers themselves. But Kibler\u2019s initiative seems to have been the catalyst for a wave of streamer action. In the aftermath of his post, another top Hearthstone streamer, Octavian \u201cKripparrian\u201d Morosan, published his own TwitLonger post weighing in on the blitzchung story, which is particularly notable considering his past refusal to bring any political discussion into his streaming content whatsoever:\n\n...I want to be clear that I support those protesting in Hong Kong. With such a large part of their country pushing for change, they are, and deserve to be on the right side of history. I haven\u2019t been involved with competitive esports Hearthstone for years now, but Hearthstone for me is much more than their esports division and their recent poor decision making. I invite Blizzard to reconsider their position. Sure, they are in the entertainment space, so they want to keep anything that isn\u2019t about Hearthstone out of their official broadcast, but the penalty on Blitzchung and the casters seems just too over the top. All of us who have spent the best part of our lives on Battlenet expect better out of Blizzard.\n\nThe next day, the pro player William \u201cAmnesiac\u201d Barton, another competitor in the Hearthstone Grandmaster League, tweeted his support for Chung\u2019s actions and denounced Blizzard\u2019s ruling. \u201cI recognise that my decision to speak up may have consequences, but I believe it\u2019s important to stand for what you think is right, and stand for the rights of others when they can\u2019t necessarily do so themselves.\u201d\n\nFollowing that, the shoutcaster Nathan \u201cAdmirable\u201d Zamora threw his hat into the ring, saying that he too would not be casting any more Hearthstone Grandmasters events for the rest of the season and through BlizzCon later this month. \u201cBlitzchung\u2019s actions to support Hong Kong speak to me far more than I could have imagined,\u201d he said in a tweet on Thursday. \u201cIt takes courage to stand up for what you believe in, and to make sacrifices in the process. His actions are inspiring to me, and I support him wholeheartedly.\u201d\n\nFrom left: Alex \u201cRaven\u201d Baguley, Simon \u201cSottle\u201d Welch, Brian Kibler, and Dan \u201cFrodan\u201d Chou. (Photo: Blizzard)\n\nMeanwhile, the shoutcasters Simon \u201cSottle\u201d Welch, Alex \u201cRaven\u201d Baguley, and Darroch Brown all decided to continue casting Grandmasters games in accordance with their existing contracts while vocally disapproving of Blizzard\u2019s actions. \u201cI fully support Blitzchung\u2019s right to protest and have immense sympathy for his cause and for the plight of the Hong Kong people,\u201d Welch said in a tweeted statement on Thursday. \u201cHowever, in light of the recent revelations that one or more casters will be stepping away from Hearthstone, I would like to affirm that I fully intend to fulfil my contracts with Hearthstone Esports and am open to work with them in the future.\u201d\n\nIn contrast with Barton and the casters, players and streamers have been slower to respond. While some immediately voiced that they were puzzled by the blitzchung verdict, a significant majority declined to say anything at all, opting instead to continue streaming and publishing as usual. In a tweet that has since been deleted, the pro streamer and Hearthstone Grandmasters competitor Paul \u201cZalae\u201d Nemeth said that he had been experiencing pressure to \u201cmake huge career/financial sacrifices to support a political cause on the other side of the planet that I know almost nothing about.\u201d In general, the trend toward silence suggests that many others harbour a similar instinct to approach the issue with caution.\n\nAs the situation developed further, Nemeth retweeted both Brian Kibler\u2019s blog post and Admirable\u2019s statement\u2014suggesting solidarity with their decisions to step down from Blizzard casting. The popular Hearthstone streamer Jeffrey \u201cTrump\u201d Shih acted similarly, retweeting Kibler\u2019s announcement post and thanking him for his decision to act on the matter. In response to Simon \u201cSottle\u201d Welch\u2019s post about continuing to participate in Hearthstone-related activities despite his disapproval for their actions, Shih responded with the closest he\u2019s gotten to a statement yet: \u201cIt\u2019s basically the same decision I\u2019m making.\u201d\n\nThursday afternoon, in a Hearthstone-related news show called Omnistone, 2014 Hearthstone world champion James \u201cFirebat\u201d Kostesich weighed in on the matter. While he didn\u2019t mention the Hong Kong protests explicitly, he voiced concern over Blizzard\u2019s dramatic response: \u201cMurdering a guy\u2019s Hearthstone career, or attempting to anyways, off of that is... it\u2019s very hard to see\u2026 Using a player as an example for some sort of thing, it doesn\u2019t make me feel good.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see why streamers might feel as if they\u2019re stuck between a rock and a hard place. Recently, a statement emerged from the Taiwanese pro player Chen \u201ctom60229\" Wei Lin, who won the Hearthstone World Championship in 2017. Like Nemeth, Lin was also pragmatic in his approach to the situation, and while he criticised Blizzard\u2019s actions as \u201cinappropriate and irrational,\u201d he said he would withhold his full statements until after he was done competing in the current round of tournaments. \u201cOnly then I will do what needs to be done and say what needs to be said\u2026After all, in the moment of competing in tournaments, I do not think there is any meaning in saying and doing anything.\u201d\n\nThroughout the scene, streamers are posting their recent streams to YouTube as they normally do, with Brian Kibler and Kripparrian themselves posting Hearthstone stream videos as recently as today. The difficulty of taking a huge career risk in the wake of a corporate blunder may be part of the reason Kibler himself encouraged onlookers to refrain from passing judgement on streamers and other high-profile members of the Hearthstone community. \u201cDo not take your anger out on the other casters, or streamers, or employees of Blizzard,\u201d he said in his post. \u201cThis is not the kind of decision that comes from the rank and file.\u201d\n\nJeremy \u201cDisguisedToast\u201d Wang, a former mainstay of the Hearthstone community who has since moved on to Teamfight Tactics, acknowledged the difficulty streamers in the scene face in approaching the issue. In a tweet on Thursday, he showed empathy toward Hearthstone streamers while adding a bit of his signature snark:\n\nHearthstone streamers are being pressured to stop streaming Hearthstone due to the Blitzchung drama, but that's financially unrealistic for them. So I'll make this offer instead. BLIZZARD, I will START playing Hearthstone again if you reconsider your position about his ban. \u2014 Disguised Toast (@DisguisedToast) October 11, 2019\n\nUnfortunately, streamers and pro players may find it increasingly difficult to avoid involvement as the situation continues to develop. Already, Twitch chat and YouTube comment sections are overflowing with controversial discussions about Blizzard and Hong Kong. Jason \u201cAmaz\u201d Chan, a community mainstay who recently began streaming Hearthstone again after a hiatus, says he cut off his stream early on Tuesday when his chat section was overrun with comments about Hong Kong: \u201cI\u2019m obviously aware of the Hong Kong issue right now, and I follow it quite a bit. My family lives there, so how could I not. I still find it very annoying that my chat gets spammed with \u2018FREE HONG KONG\u2019 every now and then.\u201d\n\nFor now, the streamers mentioned have yet to respond to Kotaku\u2019s requests for comment. We will continue to monitor the situation as more people speak out and BlizzCon approaches.", "description": "In the days since Chung \u201cblitzchung\u201d Ng Wai received a one-year suspension from the Hearthstone esports scene following his support for the ongoing protests in Hong Kong in the middle of a stream, the community has become a hotbed for politically charged discussion.
