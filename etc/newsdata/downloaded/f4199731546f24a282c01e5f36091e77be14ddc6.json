It says it is committed to the \"one country, two systems\" arrangement and denies meddling in Hong Kong's affairs.\n\nChina is eager to quell the unrest before the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China on Oct. 1. It has accused foreign powers, particularly the United States and Britain, of fomenting the unrest.\n\nBritain says it has a legal responsibility to ensure China abides by its obligations under the 1984 declaration.\n\n\"The Joint Declaration is a legally binding treaty between the UK and China that remains as valid today as it was when it was signed and ratified over 30 years ago,\" a British Foreign Office spokeswoman said in June.\n\n\"As a co-signatory, the UK government will continue to defend our position.\"\n\nBut there is little London can do to force Beijing's hand, pinning its hopes on closer trade and investment cooperation with the world's second-largest economy after Britain leaves the European Union as planned at the end of next month.", "description": "Hong Kong pro-democracy activists plan sit-ins at shopping malls and student rallies on Saturday after a night in which protesters took to the hills to form lantern-carrying human chains, the latest demonstrations in months of unrest.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106129519-1568427792598gettyimages-1167878069.jpeg?v=1568427942", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
