Here's how the equinox marks the changing of seasons.", "language": "en", "text": "Monday is this year's fall equinox.\n\nAlso called the September or autumnal equinox, this astronomical event signals the arrival of fall, summer's end, and a trend toward increasingly cold and dark days as winter comes.\n\nAt least, that's the case for people who live in Earth's northern hemisphere, which roughly 90% of all human beings call home. (Blame Earth's shifting land masses for that fun fact.)\n\nFor those in the southern hemisphere, the milestone marks the official beginning of spring. The days down under are growing longer, the weather is warming, and sunlight is growing brighter as winter approaches.\n\nTwo factors drive these all-important seasonal shifts: Earth's tilted axis and the planet's orbit around the sun.\n\nHow the fall equinox works\n\nThe Earth orbits the sun once every 365 days and 6 hours. Our planet also rotates once per day around a tilted axis.\n\nThat tilt is about 23.5 degrees (for now), which means different parts of the world get bathed with various intensities of light over the course of a year. Meanwhile, the planet's rotation keeps the heating even \u2014 it's sort of like a 7,917-mile-wide rotisserie chicken made of rock and a little water.\n\nThe fall equinox occurs when the sun's warming rays line up perpendicular to Earth's axial tilt:\n\nShayanne Gal/Business Insider\n\nIf you were to stand directly on the equator at the moment the equinox peaks \u2014 which came at precisely 3:50 a.m. ET Monday morning, according to the National Weather Service\u2014 the sun would appear more or less directly overhead. Your shadow would also be at its absolute minimum. The sun sets and rises roughly 12 hours apart on this day, too.\n\nBut this moment doesn't last, since the Earth makes its way around the sun at a speed of roughly 66,600 mph.\n\nUneven seasons\n\nOur planet's orbit is elliptical and its center of gravity slightly offset from the sun, so the time it takes to cycle through the seasons isn't perfectly divvied up.\n\nRead more: The speed of light is torturously slow, and these 3 simple animations by a scientist at NASA prove it\n\nAbout 89 days and 19 hours after the fall equinox, the Earth will reach its winter solstice \u2014 when the most direct sunlight strikes the Southern Tropic (or Tropic of Capricorn). Another 89 days later, the spring or vernal equinox will occur.\n\nThen it's another 93 days and 18 hours to the summer solstice \u2014 when the most direct rays of the sun reach their northernmost latitude, called the Northern Tropic (or Tropic of Cancer) \u2014 and another 92 days and 16 hours to get back to the fall equinox.\n\nHow Earth, its axial tilt, and the sun work to create solstices, equinoxes, and seasons. Shayanne Gal/Business Insider\n\nThe animation below, from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, shows this seasonal progression.\n\nIt was created using geosynchronous satellite images taken over Africa; such satellites fly around Earth in a geosynchronous orbit, which means they move fast enough to hover above one spot on the planet. This creates a great opportunity to photograph Earth over the course of the year and see how the the angle of sun changes.\n\nTake a look:\n\nThe truth about the egg-balancing trick\n\nWhile we're talking about equinoxes and solstices \u2014 that whole business of only being able to balance an egg on-end during a solstice is a myth. You can balance an egg any time you please, thanks to very small pores in its shell.\n\nThose pores create nearly invisible dimples in the shell upon which a (very, very) patient person can stand up the egg.\n\nDon't look for any gravitational interplay between Earth and the sun to help you out either; that's far too weak to make a noticeable difference.\n\nThis is an updated version of a story that was originally published on March 20, 2019.", "description": "The autumnal equinox happened at 3:50 a.m. ET on September 23, 2019.
