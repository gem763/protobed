(Photo: TOBY MELVILLE / POOL, EPA-EFE)\n\nIt's OK to not be OK.\n\nDuchess Meghan's interview heard around the world resonated with new moms everywhere for one simple reason \u2013 no one asks if they're OK.\n\nA clip from ITV News has gone viral because of the duchess' emotional response to anchor Tom Bradby asking her how she was doing under media scrutiny since becoming a mother. Bradby was interviewing Markle for a documentary about her and her royal husband, Prince Harry.\n\n\"Thank you for asking, because not many people have asked if I'm OK, but it's a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes,\" Duchess Meghan said.\n\nMeghan Markle\u2019s @itvnews interview shouldn\u2019t just be a reality check for those of us working in the press. We all should be asking those whom we care about, even if we consider them to be privileged, whether they\u2019re okay. pic.twitter.com/7Nw6dshX0o \u2014 Jamil Smith (@JamilSmith) October 19, 2019\n\nEarlier this month, Prince Harry issued an open letter denouncing the coverage of his wife.\n\n\"Unfortunately, my wife has become one of the latest victims of a British tabloid press that wages campaigns against individuals with no thought to the consequences \u2013 a ruthless campaign that has escalated over the past year, throughout her pregnancy and while raising our newborn son,\" he wrote in a statement.\n\nIn \"Harry and Meghan: An African Journey,\" the duchess spoke out about how challenging it is to be pregnant and dealing with the fierce and often critical media spotlight.\n\n\"Any woman, especially when they're pregnant, you're really vulnerable, so that was made really challenging and then when you have a newborn...\" the new mom said. \"Especially as a woman, it's really \u2013 it's a lot. So you add this on top of just trying to be a new mom or trying to be a newlywed.\"\n\nBradby follows up asking, \"Would it be fair to say not really OK? As in it's really been a struggle?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Duchess Meghan answers in brutal honesty.\n\nHer raw and emotional response to Bradby's questions hit home for a lot of women dealing with the stress of either being pregnant or caring for a newborn, or just generally facing life's struggles.\n\n\"I just want to thank Meghan Markle for saying she's not OK instead of some fluffy PR response,\" wrote Ashley Simpo on Twitter. \"The idea that women can do it all, mothers are superheroes and parenthood is obvious are hurtful, ignorant and damaging to women. We're not OK. Millennial parenthood is (expletive) hard.\"\n\nPeople appreciated the Duchess' very real answer in letting the world know that she was struggling to cope with everything.\n\n\"Even princesses know it is hard. I love this. This would help so many people feel ok about the struggle of it all,\" one person responded in the comments section of the clip.\n\nKatie Couric chimed in as well praising Duchess Meghan's honesty.\n\n\"I so admire #MeghanMarkle for being honest, open and vulnerable about the struggles she\u2019s faced as a new mother and very public figure,\" tweeted Couric.\n\nI so admire #MeghanMarkle for being honest, open and vulnerable about the struggles she\u2019s faced as a new mother and very public figure. #WeLoveYouMeghanpic.twitter.com/mWpFOwVeLk \u2014 Katie Couric (@katiecouric) October 18, 2019\n\nI just want to thank Meghan for remain REAL! for showing her postpartum body with pride, for not hidden her real emotions & talk openly about the struggles women go through pregnancy & as new moms. Young girls needs as examples real women not Barbie dolls \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd\u2764 #WeLoveYouMeghan \u2014 Julieth \ud83c\udf3b (@troubleshade) October 18, 2019\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that long ago that I was a new mom, and I certainly will never forget the postpartum depression. Can\u2019t imagine having to live under royal and public scrutiny on top of all the responsibilities. #weloveyoumeghanhttps://t.co/sfeK8jOQnr \u2014 Lexi Courtis\ud83e\udd89 (@lexi_courtis) October 18, 2019\n\nThis made me so emotional. Pregnant women need support. Moms with newborns need support. Moms need support. This woman is doing all of this & her life is under scrutiny 24/7. She is amazing! #WeLoveYouMeghanhttps://t.co/e70AJU3KTn \u2014 its leviOsa\u26af\u035b (@itsleviOsa934) October 19, 2019\n\nREAD MORE\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/parenting/2019/10/22/meghan-markle-interview-reminds-new-moms-its-ok-not-ok/4061138002/", "description": "Duchess Meghan's interview heard around the world resonated with most new moms everywhere\u00a0for one simple reason\u00a0\u2014 no one asks if they're OK.", "authors": ["Rasha Ali", "Published A.M.
