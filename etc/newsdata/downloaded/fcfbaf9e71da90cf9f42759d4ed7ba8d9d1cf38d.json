Cory Booker (D-NJ) falsely claimed Tuesday night at the Democrat presidential debate in Ohio that President Donald Trump is the \u201cmost unhealthy\u201d person seeking the presidency in 2020.\n\n\u201cI feel qualified to say this as the vegan on the stage,\u201d Booker said. \u201cIt\u2019s rich to me that we asked three people about their health when looking at this stage, we know that the most unhealthy person running for the presidency in 2020 is Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nContrary to Booker\u2019s claim, both former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) have encountered a few health scares over recent months.\n\nIn September, 76-year-old Biden was the target of health scares after his eye filled with blood as he spoke at the CNN town hall on climate change, apparently from a burst vessel.\n\nEarlier this month, Sanders\u2019 presidential campaign confirmed that the 78-year-old Vermont senator had experienced a heart attack.\n\n\u201cI want to thank the doctors, nurses, and staff at the Desert Springs Hospital Medical Center for the excellent care that they provided,\u201d Sanders said in a statement after he was released from the hospital.\n\nHe added, \u201cAfter two and a half days in the hospital, I feel great, and after taking a short time off, I look forward to getting back to work.\u201d\n\nIn February, Trump\u2019s Navy physician Sean Conley said the president is in \u201cvery good health.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile the reports and recommendations are being finalized, I am happy to announce the President of the United States is in very good health and I anticipate he will remain so for the duration of his Presidency, and beyond,\u201d Conley said in a memo sent to White House reporters.", "description": "Cory Booker falsely claimed\u00a0Tuesday night that President Donald Trump is the \"most unhealthy\" person seeking the presidency in 2020.", "authors": ["Kyle Morris"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1181331376-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
