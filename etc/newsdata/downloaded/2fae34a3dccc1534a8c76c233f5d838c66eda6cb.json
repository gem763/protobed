SoftBank\u2019s Adam Hieber is taking over as interim CEO. Painter will stay on as chairman of Fair. His brother, who was Fair\u2019s CFO, left the company last week.\n\n\u201cAs I\u2019ve said so often in the last few days - - what we do hasn\u2019t changed; how we do it must change,\u201d Painter said in an email to staff that was obtained by The Verge. \u201cI\u2019m so incredibly proud of the company and the team we have built, and I\u2019m not going anywhere. I will continue to be Fair\u2019s fiercest advocate, and I\u2019m here to support the entire team, including the team of experts we\u2019ve brought in to help sharpen Fair\u2019s focus on sustainable growth.\u201d\n\nPainter confirmed the news in a message to The Verge. \u201cI am not leaving the company at all. Different skill sets are needed during different phases of a companies growth. Right now Adam and our new additions to the leadership team will confirm our commitment to being a profitable business,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSuccessful companies MUST operate and grow in a sustainable manner and ultimately be profitable. The decisions that get made while growing a game changing business at speed are tough but they are necessary if you are going to build enduring companies.\u201d\n\nHave a tip?

The company grew to around 700 employees over the last three years, and bought up a few similar car leasing and subscription startups along the way.\n\nFair acquired Uber\u2019s leasing subsidiary (Xchange Leasing) around the end of 2017, just a few months after Dara Khosrowshahi replaced Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick as CEO. Shutting down Xchange Leasing was one of Khosrowshahi\u2019s first cost-cutting moves after the company wound up losing far more money on each lease than it had originally estimated. SoftBank invested $385 million in the startup shortly thereafter, skyrocketing its valuation past $1 billion.\n\nFair also bought Ford\u2019s Canvas subscription platform earlier this year. At the time, the startup claimed it would be adding Canvas\u2019 customers to an existing base of about 45,000 monthly users in the US. But three current and former employees who\u2019ve spoken to The Verge on the condition of anonymity have called those numbers into question, saying they were inflated.\n\nThings seemed to turn south in recent weeks for Fair customers, with some reporting sudden and uncharacteristically massive down payments for monthly car subscriptions on the platform.\n\nAt the same time, the employees say, SoftBank pushed fair to trim operating costs across a number of meetings with Fair\u2019s leadership over the last month, ultimately leading to last week\u2019s layoffs of 40 percent of the staff. The Japanese tech giant has been looking to pare losses in its myriad investments after big bets on Uber and the calamitous WeWork have turned sour.\n\n\u201cSoftBank, despite what is going on in the media, has been a steadfast supporter of mine and this business,\u201d Painter told The Verge on Wednesday. \u201cThis pivot flatly would not be possible without their full support and engagement. This is a development that I welcome completely.\u201d\n\nIn his message announcing last week\u2019s layoffs, Painter said he had decided to focus the Fair\u2019s resources on strengthening \u201ccore technology and reducing costs associated with the capital-intensive supply side of our business,\u201d which would require a smaller team \u201cfocused on doing fewer things well.\u201d\n\nUpdate October 30th, 6:21PM ET: Added comment from Scott Painter.", "description": "Scott Painter, the founder of SoftBank-backed car leasing startup Fair.com, has resigned following last week\u2019s layoffs and restructuring, The Verge has learned.
