But a group of protesters instead decided to offer a demonstration of the heckler\u2019s veto, shouting over McAleenan every time he tried to say a few words.\n\nProtesters stood and chanted when McAleenan took the stage as keynote speaker at an annual conference hosted by the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. The event\u2019s attendees included immigration lawyers, current and former DHS officials and pro-migrant advocates. \u201cWhen immigrants are under attack, what do we do? Stand up, fight back!\u201d the protesters shouted. The protesters read the names of children who died at the border under the Trump administration and held signs bearing the message, \u201chate is not normal.\u201d\u2026 McAleenan tried several times to begin his speech Monday, but protesters repeatedly interrupted him.\n\nDoris Meissner, a former INS commissioner who was on the dais, repeatedly asked the activists to sit down. The third time McAleenan was interrupted she said, \u201cIt\u2019s time to finish this. You\u2019re robbing the rest of this audience of an opportunity to engage in a dialogue that is important to have on a university campus.\u201d She added, \u201cUntil we hear we are not in a conversation, so let\u2019s stop the one-way street. Let\u2019s listen to the speaker, then let\u2019s have an exchange.\u201d\n\nMcAleenan started again but five seconds later the protesters, who never sat down, resumed chanting. Meissner once again asked the activists to be quiet but McAleenan could be seen signaling a member of his security detail, \u201cOne more time.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a career law enforcement professional, I\u2019ve dedicated my career to protecting the right to free speech and all the values we hold dear in America, from all threats,\u201d McAleenan said.\n\n\u201cBulls**t,\u201d someone in the audience replied. A moment later, as the chanting started up again, McAleenan shook hands with Meissner and prepared to leave.\n\nBefore he could get out the door, Andrew Selee of the Migration Policy Institute came to the microphone to address the protesters: \u201cColleagues, you\u2019re invoking democracy. Democracy requires dialogue. It requires listening,\u201d he said. McAleenan didn\u2019t look pleased but agreed to try again. This time he got a few sentences out before the chanting started up. McAleenan said \u201cThank you,\u201d to Meissner and walked out. Selee later tweeted he was \u201cdeeply saddened\u201d by the behavior of the activists:\n\nDeeply saddened that protesters decided to interrupt @DHSMcAleenan during his speech at a conf organized by @MigrationPolicy @cliniclegal @GeorgetownLaw. We need to hear from diverse perspectives in a democratic society, and the audience lost the chance to engage w/him on policy. \u2014 Andrew Selee (@SeleeAndrew) October 7, 2019\n\nThis is a perfect example of the heckler\u2019s veto in action. These protesters didn\u2019t want to challenge McAleenan, they wanted to silence him. Meissner and Selee said the right things but didn\u2019t ask the protesters to leave. Better yet, they could have had security remove the protester after the third or fourth interruption. That\u2019s what they should have done once it became clear reasoning with the activists wasn\u2019t working. There was also a smaller group of student protesters outside the speech who seem to be surrounded by security:\n\nGeorgetown Law students are standing up to protest DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan\u2019s visit to the school today. #ICEfreeGULC #AbolishICE pic.twitter.com/ZmiHuz98pr \u2014 Sam Singleton-Freeman (@_sam_sf) October 7, 2019\n\nAt least one Georgetown Law professor praised the students who shouted McAleenan down. Notice the wording here. Organizers \u201crefused to heed\u201d attempts at persuasion:\n\nThankful this happened, given that organizers refused to heed persuasive discussion from colleagues about the utter inappropriateness of having Acting Sec McAleenan keynote. #immconf pic.twitter.com/8I9y5BtiYF 1/ \u2014 Heidi Li Feldman (@HeidiLiFeldman) October 7, 2019\n\nProud of Georgetown Law students and colleagues who today stood up for the difference. 3/3 #immconf \u2014 Heidi Li Feldman (@HeidiLiFeldman) October 7, 2019\n\nI suspect this professor wouldn\u2019t enjoy someone doing this to her in her classroom. But for the new left, free speech is contingent on saying what they want to hear.
