It has said most patients affected reported using products containing THC.\n\nMore than two-thirds of patients are male. The median age of cases is 23 years, with about 62% of patients aged 18-34, according to the CDC.\n\nThe VTA says Baker's ban, if left standing, will irreparably destroy Massachusetts' $331 million nicotine vapor products industry and the livelihoods of the nearly 2,500 workers it employs.\n\nThe lawsuit is one of a number filed nationwide by vape shops and the VTA challenging restrictions announced by various states in response to the outbreak of vaping-related illnesses.\n\nGovernors in Michigan and Rhode Island have also restricted sales of flavored e-cigarette products in recent weeks. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine on Tuesday called on state lawmakers to pass a ban on most flavored e-cigarettes.\n\n(Reporting by Nate Raymond in Boston; Writing by Tim McLaughlin in Boston; Editing by Scott Malone, Bill Berkrot and Bernadette Baum)", "description": "Massachusetts officials on Friday are expected to defend their crackdown on sales of vaping products in a courtroom battle testing the toughest prohibitions yet in a rapidly developing response to e-cigarettes and their potential link to a lung disease.
