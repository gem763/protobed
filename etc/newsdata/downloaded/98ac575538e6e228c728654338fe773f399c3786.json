I would say at this moment in time he has better delivery but Kieran is a better defensive player,\u2019 Hartson told The Daily Record.\n\n\u2018Kieran gets low and defends well and he can also play as wing-back if needed.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018I watched Robertson when he was playing for Dundee United when I was covering the game and he was good.\n\n\u2018He went down to Hull and his career fizzled out there but Liverpool took him for \u00a310m and now he is on fire.\n\n\u2018Once Kieran finds his feet he will do well. Nobody wants to go to a new club injured and not to be playing.\n\n\u2018Kieran is a proud boy and he will be wanting to prove to everyone what a good player he is.\n\n\u2018He is worth \u00a325m and he can excel in a different league because there\u2019s a perception the Scottish league is just not as good.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHartson is confident the \u00a325m Arsenal spent on Tierney will prove to be a bargain down the line.\n\n\u2018Arsenal probably got him on the cheap if you look at the fact Manchester United paid \u00a350m for Aaron Wan-Bissaka,\u2019 he added.\n\n\u2018Also, average players are going for \u00a330m or \u00a340m and Kieran is certainly not average.\n\n\u2018Celtic could have held out for another \u00a35m or so but it is still good money they have banked, especially due to the fact he has come through the ranks and hasn\u2019t cost the club a penny.\u2019\n\nHartson has no doubts Tierney will succeed at Arsenal (Picture: Getty)\n\nHartson is confident Tierney is in good hands, with Unai Emery building \u2018something special\u2019 at Arsenal.\n\n\u2018He made his second start on Thursday in a team that is trying to do something,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018I think Emery is trying to build something special.\n\n\u2018They have been a bit tight with the purse strings in recent years with the stadium building but you only have to look at the players they have brought in this summer, [Nicolas] Pepe for \u00a370m, \u00a325m for Kieran and \u00a352m for [Alexandre] Lacazette a couple of seasons ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Arsenal are on the right track. They will be looking to make the top four and they might be able to capitalise on Chelsea not being able to sign players because there is a transfer ban.\n\n\u2018You look at Spurs and they are in a bit of a mess with players running their deals down and Dele Alli not in the team.\n\n\u2018Is their manager happy? They are in a bit of turmoil and so Arsenal will be pushing for a top-four place.\u2019\n\nMORE: Manchester United squad \u2018unconvinced\u2019 by first team coach Kieran McKenna", "description": "John Hartson has backed Arsenal summer signing Kieran Tierney to be a great success in the Premier League and claims the left-back is better defensively than Liverpool's Andy Robertson.
