There\u2019s no such thing.\n\n\"He\u2019s taken a few words and put them together and made them sound somewhat scientific but it\u2019s meaningless.\u201d\n\nThe made-up concept was brushed away as \"legacy material\" by Mr Miles in an interview with news.com.au.\n\nWhen pushed on what the rain machine was, he likened it to a bank vault.\n\n(Image: LUKAS COCH/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nHe went on to claim that Miles Research had not tried to patent the device for fear doing so would reveal how it is made.\n\n\"If we did that we\u2019ll lose it, it will be taken up as a national security interest and it\u2019ll then be weaponised,\" he said.\n\nDespite sitting on what Mr Miles claims is technology capable of changing the weather, the company is not in good financial shape.\n\nIts most recent accounts how Miles Research lost $70,000AU (\u00a337,2390) in the last financial year and currently has debts of $780,000AU (\u00a3414,871).\n\nMr Miles blamed some of the cash issues on having to repay some farmers for not producing enough rain - the company's time having been taken up, he claimed, by a Consumer Affairs investigation.\n\nNot one to be deterred, the weather man now wants to raise $10 million (\u00a35.32 million) to build a \u201cfacility\u201d to fully develop and prove the technology.\n\nIf Mr Miles can prove his detractors wrong he will prove a popular man.\n\nThe south-east of Australia is in the midst of a two year drought that is the worst in the area's history.", "description": "David Miles claims he can navigate the physical space-time continuum and bring future rain into the present", "authors": ["Milo Boyd", "Image", "Vimeo", "Getty Images", "Lukas Coch Epa-Efe Rex Shutterstock"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20706765.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_David-Miles.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
