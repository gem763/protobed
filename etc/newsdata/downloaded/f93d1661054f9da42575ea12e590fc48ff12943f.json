He cited the infamous \u201cSharpiegate\u201d as an example, where federal agencies assisted after Trump claimed that a hurricane was headed for Alabama.\n\n\u201cI see things happening that are hard to understand,\u201d said Powell. \u201cA couple weeks ago the president put a circle around southeast Alabama, saying it\u2019s going to get hit by a hurricane. He put it on top of the meteorological prediction. In my time, one of us would have gone to the president and said, \u2018Mr. President, you screwed up, so we\u2019ve got to fix it and we\u2019ll put out a correction.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou know what they did this time?\u201d Powell continued. \u201cThey ordered the Commerce Department to go out and backup whatever the president missaid. This is not the way the country\u2019s supposed to run, and Congress is one of the institutions that should be doing something about this.\u201d\n\nIf we accept the idea that in Powell\u2019s day officials didn\u2019t massage facts, or outright lie, in order to serve a president\u2019s objectives, how do we explain Powell\u2019s speech before the United Nations?\n\nPowell knew a war with Iraq was a bad idea, and he frequently clashed with Vice President Dick Cheney and Pentagon chief Donald Rumsfeld over the issue. Yet somehow, the four-star general was prevailed upon to betray his own doctrine, set aside his misgivings, and appear on the world stage to make the case for war.\n\nOnce thought of as a potential GOP presidential candidate, Powell tarnished his distinguished reputation when he addressed a plenary session of the United Nations Security Council on February 5, 2003. Because of his apolitical gravitas and stellar career as a general and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, when he addressed the world and said that Iraq had mobile biological-warfare labs and that there was a \u201csinister nexus\u201d between Iraq and al-Qaeda terrorists, Americans believed him.\n\nPowell said, \u201cThere can be no doubt that Saddam Hussein has biological weapons and the capability to rapidly produce more, many more.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy colleagues, every statement I make today is backed up by sources, solid sources,\u201d he told the U.N. \u201cThese are not assertions. What we\u2019re giving you are facts and conclusions based on solid intelligence.\u201d\n\nYet Powell\u2019s own intelligence staff, the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Intelligence and Research, prepared two memos commenting on drafts of the presentation that cast doubts on whether the Iraqis were, in fact, covertly producing nuclear weapons.\n\nEven worse, in order to make the case for war stronger, Powell presented information that he\u2019d embellished, if not falsified, for effect, according to reporting in Bob Woodward \u2018s 2004 book Plan of Attack. When Powell used an intercept of a conversation between Iraqi army officers about the U.N. inspections, his translation from Iraqi to English went \u201csubstantially further\u201d and cast the conversation in the most negative light possible. To seal the deal, Woodward wrote, Powell also added words that were not in the intercept.\n\n\u201cPowell took evidence of the Iraqis doing what they were supposed to do \u2014 i.e., searching their gigantic ammunition dumps to make sure they weren\u2019t accidentally holding onto banned chemical weapons \u2014 and doctored it to make it look as if Iraq were hiding banned weapons,\u201d reported The Intercept in 2018.\n\nPowell\u2019s presentation also omitted extremely relevant information, like that Saddam Hussein had actually destroyed its chemical weapons.\n\nThere was \u201cno doubt in my mind\u201d that Saddam was acquiring components to enable the production of nuclear weapons, he said in his speech.\n\nExcept there was doubt in Powell\u2019s mind.\n\nPowell\u2019s chief of staff Larry Wilkerson said that Powell had said privately, \u201cI wonder how we\u2019ll all feel if we put half a million troops in Iraq and march from one end of the country to the other and find nothing.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what happened: we invaded and no WMDs were located. Powell has always maintained that he was unaware that the intelligence estimates he used in the speech were wrong. He\u2019s called his UN presentation \u201ca blot, a failure\u201d that \u201cwill always be attached to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am mad mostly at myself for not having smelled the problem. My instincts failed me,\u201d he wrote in his book, It Worked for Me: In Life and Leadership.\n\nIn a chapter of the book titled \u201cTell Me What You Know,\u201d Powell writes that no intelligence officials had the \u201ccourage\u201d to warn him that the information he was using about Iraq in the buildup to the war was wrong.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing worse than a leader believing he has accurate information when folks who know he doesn\u2019t don\u2019t tell him that he doesn\u2019t,\u201d Powell writes. \u201cWhy did no one stand up and speak out during the intense hours we worked on the speech? Some of these same analysts later wrote books claiming they were shocked that I have relied on such deeply flawed evidence.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not what the intelligence bureau says. Greg Thielmann, head of the Office of Strategic, Proliferation, and Military Issues in the INR until September 2002, completely contradicts Powell\u2019s account. Theilmann told CBS News that the secretary of state took intelligence information and turned it on its head in order to \u201cbuild the strongest possible case for arguing that there was no alternative to the use of military force.\u201d\n\nAnd why did Powell do this? \u201cI can only assume that he was doing it to loyally support the president of the United States,\u201d said Thielmann.\n\nIn other words, Powell deceived the world in order to appease the president. Sound familiar?\n\nLike a good soldier, Powell took orders and followed them. He didn\u2019t admit publicly that he had reservations about the war until years later, after 10 Republican senators had already defected on the issue.\n\nStanley Milgram, an American social psychologist who designed the classic test on obedience to authority, wrote in his book: \u201cOrdinary people, simply doing their jobs, and without any particular hostility on their part, can become agents in a terrible destructive process. Moreover, even when the destructive effects of their work become patently clear, and they are asked to carry out actions incompatible with fundamental standards of morality, relatively few people have the resources needed to resist authority.\u201d\n\nPowell could have shown empathy for Republicans who cower before Trump. He could have shared his personal experience of how difficult it can be to have moral courage.\n\nInstead he offered this criticism:\n\nThe Republican Party has got to get a grip on itself. Right now, Republican leaders and members of the Congress, in both the Senate and in the House, are holding back because they\u2019re terrified of what will happen to any one of them if they speak out. Will they lose a primary? I don\u2019t know why that\u2019s such a disaster, but will they lose a primary? \u2026[T]hey need to get a grip, and when they see things that are not right they need to say something about it\u2026.\n\nPowell is right when he says that Trump officials and Republicans in Congress are weakening the country when they cave in to the president\u2019s demands. Yet though it may seem like cravenness and obsequiousness to authority is worse today under Trump, it is a perennial human failing. When Powell says that in his day, officials confronted presidents instead of massaging their egos with falsehoods, he expects us to have very short memories.\n\nPerhaps under Bush, officials were not asked to alter a meteorological prediction about the path of a hurricane in order to bolster one man\u2019s ego. Fair enough. But Powell was asked to do something far worse: to make the specious case for sending thousands of men to their deaths in Iraq.\n\nBarbara Boland is The American Conservative\u2019s foreign policy and national security reporter.
