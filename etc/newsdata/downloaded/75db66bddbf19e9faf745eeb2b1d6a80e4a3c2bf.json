However, it looks like many of them won't forgive Deavan Clegg for her stance on the Trump administration and racism. The furor all started when a story got shared on her Instagram Stories, which alleges she and Jihoon felt that the Trump Administration's immigration policy's racist. That upset the pro-Trumpers. Then she took to Instagram and denied that. So that upset the anti-Trump crowd. Stuck in the middle, it looks like Deavan and Jihoon lose fans from both sides of the spectrum.\n\nDeavan Clegg - stuck in the middle of Trump policies, '90 Day Fiance' couple gets hate\n\nDeavan first picked up a lot of hate after the IG Story appeared. It's one of those swipe to read things. Deavan later said that she didn't post it. It's apparently done by another company. Anyway, Korea's in a different time zone, so she didn't know the story went out. But she woke to a lot of hate. Her reaction video got grabbed by \"90 Day Fiance\" guru and blogger John Yates, where fans commented on it.\n\nOn her own Instagram, under an unrelated post, the first hate rolled in from Pro-Trump supporters. One fan said, \"I just read the article about your life being in danger and frankly I am totally disgusted by this...Jihoon may not be white, but the majority of the white nationalists in the Trump administration pushing against immigrants of color are somewhat more tolerant of South Koreans...If this is was you Deavan then I AM OUT. I certainly hope not cause I really like your family.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the latest news! Click on the topic you interest most. We'll keep you updated with all the news you shouldn't miss. Donald Trump Reality TV\n\n\"White nationalists in the Trump administration\" OH PLEASE.\"\n\n@johnyates327tv shares Deavan's denial of Trump's racism\n\nThe @johnnyytes327tv account on Instagram got ahold of the two videos that Deavan made. Upset, she denied she posted the story and denied that they ever said anything about the Trump Administration being racist. She said they cannot control what that company shares on her Stories. One \"90 Day Fiance\" fan noted she might not have shared the story.\n\nThey wrote, \"Some of the other cast members said that it is part of the contract that those companies can post for them.\"\n\nDeavan said in the video that she's very upset. But, as she continued talking, she made other followers upset as she came across as pro-Trump. She said, \"We have nothing against the president of the United States.\" She added, \"We live in Korea, and Jihoon could easily go to America whenever he wants.\" The \"90 Day Fiance\" mom said, \"Just because he's 'of color' we know that's not an issue.\" Later, Deavan said, \"I don't care if I lose followers, but we support the president, no matter who it is.\"\n\nFans slam the '90 Day Fiance' couple, some unfollow\n\nAfter getting slammed and unfollowed by pro-Trumpers, on her IG now the turn of the anti-Trumpers came.\n\nOn the @johnyates327tv account, their feelings came out: Here's what a few of them said:\n\n\"eww they support Trump. Now they\u2019re one of my least favorite couples.\"\n\n\"ugh just when I was starting to like her.\"\n\n\"She sounds so stupid, so trump can\u2019t be a white supremacists because you\u2019re white?!?! Take them off the [90 Day Fiance] show, HATE them now.\"\n\n\"She must be living under a rock.\"\n\n\"This video made me dislike her quite a bit .\"\n\n\"You haven\u2019t experience racism because your white. You will never know what that is. I\u2019m Hispanic, and I have experience at first hand. 2. You need to travel to other states so you can see what real life is about. 3. You know you won\u2019t support just any president for being president, stop lying. You will only support anyone that has your same beliefs.\"\n\nWhat do you think about \"90 Day Fiance\" fans unfollowing Deavan Clegg for denying Trump's administration's racist?\n\nDeavan spoke about living in Korea because of a deranged relative. Is it her fault the writer made it sound like she hated Trump's immigration policies? She never shared the story, but when she addressed it, she got lots more people hating on her. Do you think the less said the better?\n\nRemember to follow the Reality TV Channel on Blasting News for more insights into the cast of \"90 Day Fiance.\"", "description": "Deavan first got into hot water for sharing a story that alleged the Trump Administration's racist, then got more hate as she denied he's racist.", "authors": ["Music Crowns", "Tresa Patterson", "Milos Kitanovic", "Ramon Sanchez", "Read More On The Same Topic Jane Flowers", "Day Fiance' Jay Smith Slams Jon Walters Over Him Allegedly Forcing Ashley", "Day Fiance'", "Evelin Says 'See You Again' - It Could Be A Hint We See More Of Them", "Newcomer Syngin Colchester", "David Toborowsky Share Common Interest"], "top_image": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2019/10/27/os/b_1200x630/90-day-fiance-deavan-clegg-denies-she-thinks-trumps-racist-gets-hate-on-ig-image-credits-deavan-clegg-instagram_2345359.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
