Shokin had investigated the company that employed Hunter Biden, but the investigation had ended without charges before the vice president\u2019s involvement, and there is no evidence \u2014 although Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani claims to possess it \u2014 that Joe Biden was intervening to help his son.\n\nAsked by reporters whether he felt pressured by Trump to investigate Biden, Zelensky said, \"I think you read everything. So I think you read text. I'm sorry but I don't want to be involved to democratic open elections of USA. I think we had good phone call. It was normal. We spoke about many things. I think, and you read it, nobody pushed me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn other words, no pressure,\u201d Trump replied.\n\nUkraine President Volodymyr Zelensky listens to President Trump at the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday.

According to the memo, Trump raised the issue of Biden after he and Zelensky discussed U.S. support for Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI would like you to do us a favor,\u201d Trump told Zelensky before asking him to look into both Biden and his son and for Ukraine\u2019s help investigating the 2016 hacking of a Democratic National Committee server.\n\nAt the time of the call, much-needed U.S. military aid for Ukraine had been held up for unexplained reasons, reportedly at the request of the White House.\n\nTrump suggested Zelensky work with Giuliani and with Attorney General William Barr. Giuliani had separately pressed Ukrainian officials for a Biden inquiry.\n\n\u201cI would like to have the attorney general call you or your people, and I would like you to get to the bottom of it,\u201d Trump said, according to the White House memo.\n\n[Read the full memo on Trump's call with Ukraine]\n\nThe call is reportedly part of a whistleblower\u2019s complaint against Trump, which led to more Democratic calls for his impeachment.\n\nOn Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi acceded to mounting pressure from her caucus, announcing a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump's behavior.\n\n\"The president has admitted to asking the president of Ukraine to take actions which would benefit him politically,\" Pelosi said. \"The actions of the Trump presidency revealed the dishonorable fact of the president\u2019s betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections.\"\n\n\"The president must be held accountable,\" Pelosi added. \"No one is above the law.\"\n\nTrump responded to a question about the impeachment inquiry by implying he no longer intended to deal with Pelosi as the head of another branch of government. \u201cNancy Pelosi, as far as I\u2019m concerned, unfortunately she\u2019s no longer the speaker of the House,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump also expressed the belief that emails erased from a server belonging to his 2016 opponent, Hillary Clinton, might still exist in Ukraine. During the campaign, Trump asked for help from Russia in tracking down the emails. The memo of his call with Zelensky shows Trump asking about an email server and CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm that helped investigate the 2016 hack into the Democratic National Committee. Trump has said previously the company was owned by a rich Ukrainian, but the California-based company\u2019s IPO filing says that the biggest shareholders are American venture-capital backers.", "description": "Amid mounting calls for President Trump\u2019s impeachment over his July 25 phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump met face-to-face with Zelensky on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly.", "authors": ["Dylan Stableford", "Christopher Wilson", "Senior Staff"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cLhmTlgc07Cj3hwQrZbbVw--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/adb081f0-dfc8-11e9-be57-064970bbfabb", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
