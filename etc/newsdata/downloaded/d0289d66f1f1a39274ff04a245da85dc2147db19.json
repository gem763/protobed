Guess \u201cpeace\u201d isn\u2019t going to be high on the list. Probably reinforces some of the negative perceptions. It\u2019s a largely domestic play, stoking the 1.3 billion with patriotic/nationalistic pride.But for what? \u2014 Li Yuan (@LiYuan6) October 1, 2019\n\nAccording to an analysis of by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the missile is capable of striking the continental US within 30 minutes.\n\nOther weapons featured were the JL-2 missile, which can be launched from a nuclear submarine \"providing sea-based nuclear deterrence\", as well as a new generation of anti-ship missiles called YJ-18, according to state television CGTN.\n\nA new and advanced radar system that could \"detect jets and missiles\" was also introduced, as well as new HQ-9B surface-to-air missiles \"capable of intercepting multiple air strike weapons in a complex electro-magnetic environment\".\n\nThe DF-41 intercontinental ballistic missile has the longest range in the world [ Ng Han Guan/AP]\n\nIn all, 160 aircraft and 580 pieces of military equipment, as well as 15,000 military personnel, were in the parade, according to the state-owned news website, Xinhua.\n\nIn 2018, China spent an estimated $250bn on its military, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. In comparison, the US spent $649bn during the same period.\n\nChina has the largest standing military in the world, with a total of two million active members, compared to1.29 million in the US.\n\nTan Min, the parade organiser, was quoted as saying that all the weapons and equipment displayed were \"domestic and in active service\" complete with advance technology for \"better strike accuracy\".\n\nHu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the state-owned Global Times newspaper, wrote on social media that the display was a show of \"military transparency\".\n\n\"China with strong military strength is conducive to curb the strategic impulse of external powers towards China,\" he said.\n\nA total of 188 military attaches from 97 countries were reportedly invited to watch the military display.", "description": "Beijing also showcased inter-ballistic missile capable of reaching US in 30 minutes during 70th anniversary parade.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/1/65957d1372284602b9b0d9941c225941_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
