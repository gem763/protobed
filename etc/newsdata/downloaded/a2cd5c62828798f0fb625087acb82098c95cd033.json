Napoli deserved their 2-0 victory to start this Champions League campaign for the will displayed, but Liverpool will look to slack final touches at both ends. This was not just a slow start for the defending European champions, but their most tepid display of the season so far. It was actually a little difficult to square the side that were so luscious in attack against Newcastle United at the weekend with the team so lacking in force at the end here.\n\nThis was what led to their undoing, even if some of it was with some mischievous ingenuity from Jose Callejon. Napoli were sharper in those two key moments, more attentive. So when Andy Robertson came in on the forward cleanly but a little clumsily in the 81st minute, Callejon saw his opportunity.\n\nIt was much the same for the goal that clinched it. That somehow saw Virgil van Dijk, a defender who has physically dominated most of Europe in the last year, outdone by a striker in Fernando Llorente who is basically at the club because he isn\u2019t quite the physical specimen he was. The striker did get the \u201crevenge\u201d he wanted for Tottenham Hotspur here, but this wasn\u2019t really the same Liverpool that won last season\u2019s Champions League.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

One quick one-touch passing move almost put Dries Mertens through as the Italian side just wondrously weaved their way through the Liverpool backline, one flurry forced Adrian into two quick-fire instant saves from pummelled shots, before a goal was ruled out for offside.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The only issue initially them was that pace, and the high line it necessitated, left an awful lot of space in behind. Mo Salah was only too willing to consume it, and was almost in twice in the opening minutes. He probably should have done better with one early opportunity where a brilliant Jordan Henderson ball put him right in behind Kalidou Koulibaly.\n\nSalah\u2019s final touch \u2013 as was the case throughout the team throughout the entire game \u2013 was just a little off.\n\nAdrian\u2019s touch, at least, it wasn\u2019t. From that, there was no question about the best moment of the game.\n\nThat was the stand-in goalkeeper\u2019s frankly astonishing save from Mertens.\n\nIt was one of those where it didn\u2019t quite seem physically possible, and you\u2019re left wondering how it happened.\n\nAfter the ball had been brilliant clipped in behind the Liverpool backline, Mertens seem to have the goal at his mercy as he volleyed it toward the net. Adrian at once seemed to hang in the air for an age and arrive in the nick of time, as he clasped the ball away with his back-hand.\n\nIf all that seems contradictory, that\u2019s why it was so good.It somehow kept Mertens out. Adrian couldn\u2019t keep him out for the penalty, though, despite getting a touch.\n\nAnd that was the thing about this match. It was as if Napoli just eventually forced it over the line.\n\nThat\u2019s what it came down to.\n\nThis is the flip side of being the champions. Opposition sides raise their game for you.\n\nThe frustration was that the moment actually came when Napoli had seemed to drastically drop off. It was as if Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s subs had sapped some of his side\u2019s energy, Llorente particularly limiting their movement.\n\nLiverpool evidently sensed opportunity to win it, but that just made them even looser at the back.\n\nCallejon took advantage, Llorente later took his opportunity.\n\nNapoli thereby take the initiative, as Liverpool must take stock.", "description": "A decisive moment that summed up the game: debatable.
