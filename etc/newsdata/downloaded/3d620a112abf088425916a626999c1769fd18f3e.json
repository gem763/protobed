Israeli officials denied claims of casualties.\n\nHezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah later said his organisation would respond to any further Israeli attacks with strikes \"deep inside Israel\" and not just along the border.\n\nIran-backed Hezbollah, considered a terrorist organisation by Israel and the United States, is a major political actor in Lebanon and a key government backer in war-torn Syria.\n\nThe flare-up was sparked by an Israeli strike in Syria which killed two Hezbollah fighters on August 24 and was followed by what the movement described as an Israeli drone strike on its Beirut stronghold.\n\nIsrael has not acknowledged that attack, but accused Hezbollah and Tehran of colluding to produce precision-guided missiles on Lebanese soil.\n\nIsrael has staged hundreds of strikes against what it says are Iranian and Hezbollah targets in Syria since the civil war began there in 2011, vowing to prevent its arch-foe Iran from entrenching itself militarily in the neighbouring country.\n\nBut a drone attack by Israel inside Lebanon would mark a departure -- what Nasrallah labelled the first such \"hostile action\" since a 2006 war between them.\n\nThe 33-day war killed 1,200 Lebanese -- mostly civilians -- and 160 Israelis, mostly soldiers.\n\nThe flaring tensions come just a week ahead of Israel's September 17 election, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seen as wanting to avoid a major conflict ahead of the vote.", "description": "Hezbollah said Monday it had shot down an \"Israeli drone\" as it crossed the border into Lebanon, a week after a flash confrontation between the arch-foes.
