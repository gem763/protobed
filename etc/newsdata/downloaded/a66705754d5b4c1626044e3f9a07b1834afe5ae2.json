Prime Minister Justin Trudeau committed in 2015 to doing so, but federal legislation to that effect died in the Senate in June. Trudeau, who won a second term this week but lost his parliamentary majority, said previously his government would attempt to implement the declaration if re-elected.\n\nMcIvor said requiring consent was not the same as having veto power, a key concern that held up the federal legislation in the Senate.\n\nThe British Columbia bill unanimously passed its first legislative hurdle on Thursday and faces its next step on Monday.\n\nFraser\u2019s office worked with First Nations Summit (FSN), which represents the majority of British Columbia Indigenous councils, and others to write the bill.\n\n\u201cThe provincial government has a long history of denying the very existence and rights of indigenous peoples,\u201d Cheryl Casimer, one of three political executives for FSN, said in a statement.\n\nCasimer said the west coast province\u2019s New Democratic Party government was embarking on a new path for building a respectful and modern government-to-government relationship.\n\nThe provincial bill \u201cunderlines that there is a serious commitment\u201d by the government to change the relationship \u201cfrom one that is simply ticking boxes in a consultation-based world ... into respecting indigenous rights,\u201d McIvor said.", "description": "The Canadian province of British Columbia took its first step on Thursday toward implementing the landmark U.N. agreement on the rights of indigenous peoples, which provides a legal framework for governments' relationship with indigenous peoples, including formally given them a say in matters affecting their rights.", "authors": ["Moira Warburton", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
