A buyback program would also be rolled out for those already in the hands of Canadians.\n\nGun violence in Canada has been far less frequent and impactful than in the neighboring United States.\n\nBut it has become an election issue with the mayors of Toronto and Montreal demanding stricter measures, and the Conservatives -- who support tougher penalties for gun crimes -- running Trudeau's Liberals neck and neck in the polls.\n\nCanadians will vote on October 21, with the campaign dominated in recent days by Trudeau's apologies over decades-old images of him wearing \"blackface\" makeup.", "description": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, campaigning for re-election, vowed on Friday to ban assault rifles but fell short on handguns, saying only that he would help cities restrict pistols and revolvers in response to a spate of shootings. \"You don't need military-grade assault weapons, ones", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5YqYGMwG9dxwoQyWJ5D9eQ--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://slick-prod.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/slick_thumb/yahooNews-307527-1569005440002.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
