REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/Files\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said they spoke to Trump by phone on Sunday morning, which marked 200 days since the Democratic House passed legislation to expand background checks to all gun purchases.\n\nIn the aftermath of a series of mass shootings in August that killed more than 30 people, Trump has been discussing potential legislation with lawmakers in both parties. He said on Wednesday that progress was being made on gun legislation, adding that many areas were under discussion, including background checks.\n\nThe Republican-controlled Senate has yet to take up the House bill. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters last week: Until the White House gives us some indication of what the president is willing to sign we are waiting to see what it looks like.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThese horrendous shootings - in my opinion -deserve a response, I hope we can get something that can actually become the law of the United States of America.\u201d\n\nPelosi and Schumer said in a joint statement after the phone call with Trump: \u201cThis morning, we made it clear to the President that any proposal he endorses that does not include the House-passed universal background checks legislation will not get the job done, as dangerous loopholes will still exist and people who shouldn\u2019t have guns will still have access.\u201d\n\nThe two leaders said they promised to join Trump \u201cfor a historic signing ceremony at the Rose Garden\u201d if the president would endorse the legislation and lean on McConnell to pass it \u201cto save as many lives as possible.\u201d\n\nThe White House described Trump\u2019s call with Pelosi and Schumer as \u201ccordial,\u201d but said the president had not made any commitments on the House bill, known as H.R. 8.\n\nTrump has \u201cinstead indicated his interest in working to find a bipartisan legislative solution on appropriate responses to the issue of mass gun violence,\u201d White House spokesman Judd Deere said in an emailed comment. \u201cThe president reiterated his commitment for his administration to continue work on these issues.\u201d\n\nPrevious attempts to pass gun control after mass shootings, including the December 2012 killings of 20 children and six staff members at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, have mostly failed in the face of fierce lobbying by the National Rifle Association and other gun groups.\n\nThe shooting sprees in August in Texas and Ohio put renewed focus on the issue. Trump said he favored action, possibly on tackling mental health issues related to the violence or expanded background checks.\n\nThe White House has yet to outline any specific proposals, but officials said the measures might include expediting the death penalty for mass shooters.", "description": "Top Democrats in Congress told Republican President Donald Trump on Sunday that any gun control legislation that falls short of universal background checks for gun sales \u201cwill not get the job done.\"", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430312759&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F04V", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
