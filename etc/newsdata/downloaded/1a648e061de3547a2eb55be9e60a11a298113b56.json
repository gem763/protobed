He said in court papers that he faces \u201cirreconcilable commands\u201d \u2014 a subpoena from House Democrats requiring him to cooperate and an order from the White House not to testify.", "description": "", "authors": ["Msn.Com En-Us News Politics Impeachment-Panels-Threaten-Contempt-If-Official-Defies-Subpoena"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
