I rely on the cold roastie leftovers on Boxing day to get me out of my wine-flu.\"\n\nAnother commented: \"Hang on a minute... that roast potato/parsnip/sprout ratio is ALL wrong... and where ARE the pigs in blankets! I made 72 last year! (There were seven of us).\"\n\nA third added: \"Actually a food crime. It\u2019s a five roast potato minimum, with the option to have at least two/three more from the \u2018extras\u2019 bowl. And no one I know wants one whole parsnip to themselves!\"\n\nSomeone else wrote: \"100ml of gravy????? Madness. I need double that.\"\n\nThe BBC Good Food Twitter account later responded to Alice's tweet, with a drawing clarifying what they meant by \"one\" potato.\n\nThey said: \"There's been some heated Christmas dinner debate today, so here are our workings.\n\n\"Rest assured there are plenty of us in the Good Food offices with giant festive appetites who'd up the quantities too (particularly the gravy). We love how passionate you all are about the potatoes!\"\n\nThe drawing, titled Turkey Dinner Maths, shows how \"one potato\" didn't mean one roastie, but one whole potato cut into four pieces.\n\nAll four of the pieces were intended for one person to consume. Similarly if a person chose to use two smaller potatoes, these would be cut in half, to also generate four roast potatoes per person.\n\nPhew!", "description": "A Twitter user started a strange debate after sharing a Christmas dinner shopping guide she'd found", "authors": ["Courtney Pochin", "Image", "Getty", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article13691038.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Roast-potatoes-for-dinner.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
