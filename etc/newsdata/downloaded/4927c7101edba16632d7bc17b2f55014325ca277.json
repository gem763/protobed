Any captured ISIS fighters are now the responsibility of Turkey, the White House added.\n\nThe Kurds, an ethnic group, lead the Syrian Democratic Forces, the main ally of the U.S. in Syria. The Turkish government, however, considers them to be terrorists. Middle Eastern and foreign policy experts have warned that allowing Turkey to invade northern Syria will result in a genocide against the Kurds.\n\nBut Trump, in a series of tweets Monday, essentially told the Kurds that the United States has supported them for years, but now they\u2019re on their own.\n\n\u201cThe United States was supposed to be in Syria for 30 days, that was many years ago,\u201d the president wrote. \u201cWe stayed and got deeper and deeper into battle with no aim in sight.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Kurds fought with us, but were paid massive amounts of money and equipment to do so,\u201d he continued. \u201c[I]t is time for us to get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars, many of them tribal, and bring our soldiers home. WE WILL FIGHT WHERE IT IS TO OUR BENEFIT, AND ONLY FIGHT TO WIN.\u201d\n\nTrump added that it\u2019s now up to Turkey, Europe, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia and the Kurds to \u201cfigure the situation out.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey all hate ISIS, have been enemies for years,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cWe are 7000 miles away and will crush ISIS again if they come anywhere near us!\u201d\n\nThe United States was supposed to be in Syria for 30 days, that was many years ago. We stayed and got deeper and deeper into battle with no aim in sight. When I arrived in Washington, ISIS was running rampant in the area. We quickly defeated 100% of the ISIS Caliphate,..... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 7, 2019\n\n....including capturing thousands of ISIS fighters, mostly from Europe. But Europe did not want them back, they said you keep them USA! I said \u201cNO, we did you a great favor and now you want us to hold them in U.S. prisons at tremendous cost. They are yours for trials.\u201d They..... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 7, 2019\n\n.....again said \u201cNO,\u201d thinking, as usual, that the U.S. is always the \u201csucker,\u201d on NATO, on Trade, on everything. The Kurds fought with us, but were paid massive amounts of money and equipment to do so. They have been fighting Turkey for decades. I held off this fight for.... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 7, 2019\n\n....almost 3 years, but it is time for us to get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars, many of them tribal, and bring our soldiers home. WE WILL FIGHT WHERE IT IS TO OUR BENEFIT, AND ONLY FIGHT TO WIN. Turkey, Europe, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia and the Kurds will now have to..... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 7, 2019\n\n...figure the situation out, and what they want to do with the captured ISIS fighters in their \u201cneighborhood.\u201d They all hate ISIS, have been enemies for years. We are 7000 miles away and will crush ISIS again if they come anywhere near us! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 7, 2019\n\nIn a statement Sunday, the SDF said a Turkish invasion would \u201cdisplace our people\u201d and could \u201cresult in many civilian casualties.\u201d The forces warned that Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw support in northern Syria will reverse the progress they\u2019ve made on defeating ISIS and make the war-torn country a \u201cpermanent conflict area.\u201d\n\nSeveral senior Republicans pushed back on Trump\u2019s plan to desert the Kurds.\n\n\u201cI hope I\u2019m making myself clear how shortsighted and irresponsible this decision is in my view,\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told \u201cFox & Friends\u201d on Monday. \u201cThis, to me, is just unnerving to its core.\u201d\n\nTrump called for the complete withdrawal of U.S. forces in Syria last December, but he ultimately reversed his decision following backlash from American intelligence officials, foreign allies and U.S. lawmakers, including Graham.\n\nThis story has been updated with a statement from the Syrian Democratic Forces.\n\nLove HuffPost?
