Rather than allow lies to triumph, this court should listen to the angels of its better nature and rule that this prorogation is an unlawful abuse of the power of prorogation which has been entrusted to the government.\n\nQ&A What is the UK supreme court and how does it work? Show Hide The supreme court of the United Kingdom was formally established on 1 October 2009. It is the ultimate court for hearing cases of the greatest public or constitutional importance, and is the final court of appeal in the UK, except for criminal cases heard in Scotland. The supreme court took over the judicial functions of the House of Lords, separating the judiciary from the legislature. It brought an end to the system of appealing to the \"lords of appeal in ordinary\" - commonly known as the law lords. The court comprises the president and deputy president and 10 other judges of the supreme court. Judges are appointed by the Queen on the advice of the prime minister, to whom a name is recommended by a special selection commission. The prime minister is obliged to recommend this name. The judgments in all decided cases from the court are published on the court's website.\n\n\u201cThis government has proved itself unworthy of our trust as it uses the power [of its] office ... which is corrosive of the constitution and destructive of the system of parliamentary democracy on which our union polity is founded. Enough is enough. Dismiss this appeal and let them know that. This is what truth speaking to power sounds like.\u201d\n\nIn contrast with other lawyers who addressed the supreme court this week through detailed reference to past cases and subsections of legislations, O\u2019Neill adopted a centuries-long historical perspective and an emotive approach to the nature of the UK\u2019s constitution.\n\nUrging judges not to make this a \u201cDred Scott moment\u201d \u2013 referring to the landmark 1857 US supreme court case that affirmed slave owners\u2019 rights and paved the way to the civil war \u2013 O\u2019Neill urged the court to \u201cstand up for truth, stand up for reasons, stand up for unity in diversity, stand up for democracy\u201d.\n\nThe justices should dismiss the government\u2019s appeal against the ruling by the inner house of Scotland\u2019s court of session by \u201cupholding a constitution governed by laws not by the passing whims of men\u201d, he said.\n\nThe UK was a parliamentary representative democracy, O\u2019Neill said, where the executive was subordinate to the law and accountable to parliament. Unlike in the US, the executive was not elected directly by the people. Parliamentary democracy was the \u201canimating principle of the UK constitution\u201d, he said.\n\nHis opening flight of oratory, lasting half an hour \u2013 during which he was barely interrupted by the justices \u2013 took in the 1314 battle of Bannockburn, Hamlet\u2019s Macbeth, the German constitutional court in Karlsruhe, Oliver Cromwell and Nelson Mandela. The UK was a \u201cstate of nations\u201d rather than a single nation state, O\u2019Neill suggested.\n\nHe dismissed the government\u2019s claim that parliament had the power to resist prorogation. Under the rules in the parliamentary handbook, Erskine May, O\u2019Neill said, MPs could vote to remain in session but required assent for it to become effective in law \u2013 something which ministers would withhold.\n\nInappropriate for judges to intervene in prorogation, says government lawyer Read more\n\nEven if the government had neither intended to avoid parliamentary scrutiny nor acted in bad faith, O\u2019Neill continued, \u201ctheir ignorance of our constitution does not make what they have done lawful. That\u2019s why the effect [of closing down parliament] is what\u2019s significant \u2026\u201d\n\nDowning Street officials had looked at their diaries and found the largest period of time permitted under legislation to close down the Commons, he said. \u201cThey have seen a black hole and leapt in,\u201d O\u2019Neill said. \u201cIt\u2019s clever-clever perhaps, but is it constitutional?\u201d\n\nThe phrase \u201croyal prerogative\u201d, frequently deployed by government lawyers, covered a bundle of unrelated residual powers and was not a \u201cmagic\u201d word that could obstruct accountability to parliament, the judges were told.\n\nEarlier in the day Sir James Eadie QC, representing Boris Johnson\u2019s government, argued there were areas of political process and \u201chigh policy\u201d that could not be subjected to any judicial standards. It was constitutionally inappropriate for the courts to intervene in the prime minister\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament because there was a clear separation of powers, he told the court.\n\nEadie said the only \u201csure and proper guide\u201d for courts to intervene in cases was on the basis of already enacted legislation. Otherwise, he said, it moved the courts into the territory of \u201cparliamentary controversy\u201d.\n\nThere were a \u201cmyriad of reasons for the length of this prorogation\u201d, Eadie said. \u201cReading [Cabinet Office] documents the evident aim was everyone was concerned to get to a place where a Queen\u2019s speech was produced.\u201d\n\nIn written submissions, Lord Garnier QC, representing the former prime minister John Major, said it would be remarkable if the courts took the view \u201cthat there is nothing in law to prevent a prime minister from proroguing parliament in any circumstances or for any reason\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe fact that there are constitutional safeguards which operate on the well-intentioned [prime minister] is no reason for the courts to reject any possibility of intervening even in other cases.\u201d\n\nThe supreme court case has generated widespread interest. The first members of the public began queueing at 6.30am on Wednesday to secure a seat in court. The livestreamed broadcast of the proceedings had attracted more than 4m requests to view during the course of Tuesday morning\u2019s hearing.\n\nThe hearing continues.", "description": "Scottish lawyer at prorogation hearing says Johnson government has proved itself unworthy of trust", "authors": ["Owen Bowcott", "John Crace"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06703ce6eb3fedc7291fe6452c1993bba4194bc1/0_412_6186_3712/master/6186.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d2e037ab6aefd3034b2c37fbbce8dec9", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
