We\u2019re dealing with a state that is so repressive.\u201d\n\nInfluencers travelling under a state-sponsored program are not getting the full picture, Ismail says.\n\n\u201cIf someone goes to Saudi Arabia and sees all the changes that are taking place in Saudi Arabia and how some Saudis particularly younger Saudis are enjoying themselves, of course they\u2019re going to say that \u2018this is great the Saudi state is changing its liberalising\u2019. But on the other hand, we\u2019re dealing with a very repressive state.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe also cautions that those working on the regime\u2019s image need to consider the ethical dimensions of doing so.\n\n\u201cSometimes you have to pick a stand. The standard you walk past is the standard you accept. If you see the country violating human rights. Do you turn a blind eye or do you take a stand?\u201d\n\nShe points to recent cases, including Nicki Minaj, who pulled out a concert in Saudi Arabia to show support for women and LGBTI people.\n\n\n\nAustralians Gab Scanu @gabscanu (363,000 followers) and Tara Whiteman @taramilktea (1.3m followers) have been influential in selling Saudi Arabia to young Australian tourists.\n\nScanu, a 22-year-old photographer, was one of the first influencers enlisted by Gateway KSA to film a video of the kingdom in February 2018 and has received plenty of backlash for accepting the sponsored trip.\n\nHe says he accepted the invitation for creative purposes and did not consider the political implications.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t agree with \u2018influencers\u2019 travelling there and commenting on issues they\u2019re not educated in,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not what the media makes it out to be. I think there are a lot of improvements to be made for sure but I never felt unsafe or in danger while there.\u201d\n\nGuardian Australia contacted almost 50 influencers who appeared to have accepted sponsored trips or been paid for advertisements. Two of them who were posting photos of Saudi Arabia to five Instagram accounts with a combined 4.65m followers cancelled five minutes before an arranged interview. They say the Saudi tourism board sent a group message asking influencers not to speak to media.\n\nA few weeks ago the absolute monarchy announced it was introducing a tourist visa, open to 49 nationalities, including Australians. It also pledged it would allow unmarried foreign men and women to share hotel rooms. Previously the kingdom had been off limits for most tourists.\n\nThe influencers were enlisted in the lead-up to the announcement to soften the country\u2019s image and gloss over human rights abuses.\n\nThere is a long list of rules for visitors to observe, including dressing modestly, not showing public affection, and not drinking alcohol. It is also illegal to display sympathy towards Qatar, practise homosexual acts, practise a religion other than Islam, or make comments online that ridicule or criticise religion, the Saudi royal family, Saudi Arabia or its leadership.\n\nUnder crown prince Mohammad bin Salman, Saudi Arabia has attempted to reform its ultra-conservative reputation and plans to diversify the nation\u2019s economy through sectors such as tourism, reducing Saudi Arabia\u2019s economic dependence on oil exports.\n\nRapid development has seen high-end resorts popping up across the Red Sea across 50 islands and 34,000 sq km.\n\nSaudi Arabia pays UK firms millions to boost image Read more\n\nThe past few years have seen gradual improvements in women\u2019s rights. In January 2015 women were permitted to run for office in municipal elections, and in 2017 they were granted the right to drive. The country\u2019s strict guardianship rules, which required women to gain permission from a male relative to travel or apply for a passport, were relaxed in August.\n\nScanu says local women he met during his sponsored tour claim the media misrepresents women\u2019s rights in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u201cWe actually spoke to a lot of young females who voiced the fact that they studied abroad in the US and did not agree with the way women\u2019s rights are portrayed in the media as they were all very proud of their country and culture,\u201d he says.\n\nBut while influencers talk of a nation opening up to the world, six women who spearheaded the campaign to allow women to drive remain in prison without charge.\n\nOne of them is a Saudi women\u2019s rights activist, Loujain al-Hathloul, who alleges she was tortured after being abducted and forcibly returned to Saudi Arabia while studying for a master\u2019s degree at the University of British Columbia.\n\nThe Dutch-Australian founder of tGateway KSA, Nelleke Van Zandvoort-Quipsel, says issues such as the treatment of women, the guardianship law, Saudi Arabia\u2019s role in the war in Yemen and the murder of Jamal Khashoggi are all discussed \u2013 and no topic is off limit.\n\n\u201cAll the Saudis they meet are willing to talk about their views candidly and openly,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s real people, sharing real experiences, and from that they can judge and form their own opinion. We don\u2019t guide them in how or what to think, whether positively or negatively.\u201d\n\nDespite the assurance of openness, influencers overwhelming focus on the country\u2019s landmarks and natural attractions and steer clear of controversy.\n\nA former Bachelorette contestant, Kasey Stewart (20.8k followers), travelled to Saudi Arabia last September after meeting Van Zandvoort-Quipsel in Antarctica.\n\nThe Oklahoma social media personality says change is happening in \u201cbaby steps\u201d.\n\n\u201cI know enough that I do know that obviously with a country that has hundreds of thousands of years of history and culture to it that it\u2019s not something that is going to happen overnight,\u201d Stewart says.\n\n\u201cI think the biggest thing that I took away was how many genuine people live in the country that do love their country and wanted to see it change. They\u2019re normal people that want normal lives. A lot of them are really happy and sure some of them aren\u2019t. But yeah it is a really beautiful country.\u201d\n\nGuardian Australia contacted Saudi Arabia\u2019s tourism board for comment.", "description": "Social media stars have been taking paid trips to the kingdom and posting lavish praise in return \u2013 avoiding its troubling human rights record", "authors": ["Eden Gillespie"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef4078306ecbf0c5565bc0520378f37a5f238b87/0_171_4488_2694/master/4488.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bdbbc029563bc5c75734f2c3011f77f4", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
