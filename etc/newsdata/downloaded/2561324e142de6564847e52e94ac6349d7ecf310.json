He said the growth in rooftop solar generation will force out \"dispatchable\" plants that can be switched off during the sunniest hours, maintaining a value for solar generated on rooftops.\n\nMore interconnection in the power grid will also help, said Mr Dufty. \"I don't think we will see a time when there will be zero feed-in tariffs in the market,\" he added.\n\nSolar feed-in tariffs for households in south-east Queensland ranged from 4\u00a2 a kilowatt-hour to 10\u00a2/kWh last year, according to the Australian Energy Market Commission, although it noted that many other solar products are on offer, some of which have no explicit price for exports. That compares with the 44\u00a2/kWh fixed tariff that the first solar households were able to lock in from the government and which lasts until 2028.\n\nBoth AEC and Energy Edge said the expected decline in solar tariffs should encourage households to buy batteries.\n\nFor large-scale solar projects operating in the merchant market, the reduction in average spot prices due to negative prices has combined with the decline in the price of large-scale renewable energy certificates and grid bottlenecks to slash annual income.\n\nEnergy Edge calculates that a hypothetical 100 MW solar farm in Queensland reliant on the spot market would have seen annual revenues drop 43.8 per cent since 2017, only partly offset by declining project construction costs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the rate of new wind and solar project development has slowed, fresh figures released on Tuesday by Rystad Energy still found that 2019 has set a new record already for utility-scale solar, wind and storage project proposals, with 133 gigawatts in the pipeline, up from 94 GW at the start of the year.\n\nRystad said that coal power generation \"could be extinct by 2040\" in Australia as coal generators struggle to remain economic amid a growth in storage and growing consumer sentiment for clear fuel.", "description": "Homes that don't have regulated solar feed-in tariffs are likely to be affected as retailers reduce the price they offer for power pumped into the grid.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2686%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_95/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1756233261b25518ec843fde847498b705d5f8bb", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
