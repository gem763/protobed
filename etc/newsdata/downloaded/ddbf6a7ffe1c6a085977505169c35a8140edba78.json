This one has my testing results of the new iPhone 11 models. The other, found here, is an advice column for the many readers we\u2019ve heard from who have older phones\u2014I\u2019m looking at you, iPhone Sixers!\n\nOne day, I\u2019ll tell my grandchildren of a time before the iPhone 11.\n\nI\u2019ll regale them with stories of portable chargers the size of cinder blocks strapped to the backs of our phones. I\u2019ll tell them how we scoured walls in search of power outlets. I\u2019ll describe the panic that set in when the red empty-battery icon dipped below 5%.\n\nIn the scheme of iPhone upgrade history, the new iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max sure seem boring. Same designs\u2026but new colors! Cameras\u2026but three of them! Glass\u2026but stronger?! After a week of testing, I can tell you that\u2019s mostly just smoke-and-mirrors marketing, except for one thing many of us have wanted all along: phones that are a bit heavier and thicker\u2014but work when we damn well need them to. Yes, longer battery life.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t been following along, here\u2019s the lineup, which arrives Friday:\n\n\u2022 iPhone 11 ($699 and up): An upgrade to last year\u2019s iPhone XR, it has a 6.1-inch screen that covers the whole front (no fingerprint sensor) and two cameras on the back. The LCD screen isn\u2019t as nice as the OLED on the pricier models, but I promise you won\u2019t even think about it.\n\n\u2022 iPhone 11 Pro ($999 and up): The smallest of the bunch with a 5.8-inch OLED screen, it now has three cameras on the back.\n\n\u2022 iPhone 11 Pro Max ($1,099 and up): Identical to the 11 Pro, save for a 6.5-inch screen.\n\nApple has been talking up these phones\u2019 cameras, and it\u2019s true: If you enjoy taking pictures, especially of kids or pets, they do have some great tricks. The wide-angle camera is sure to have people mistaking me for Ansel Adams. The newly added night mode, while a bit buggy, is an improvement over previous dimly lit, washed-out shots.\n\nNow, as we review my key findings, promise me you\u2019ll follow my annual advice: Regardless of what you\u2019re upgrading from, choose which features matter to you most, and try to ignore Apple\u2019s marketing machine.\n\nDow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, has a commercial agreement to supply news through Apple services.\n\nThe 11 Pro (center) and the 11 Pro Max (right) are virtually identical, except for their battery life and the size of their high-resolution OLED screens.

After my daily routine of quite-heavy phone use, I have about 5% to 10% still remaining by my 11:30 p.m. bedtime\u2014with no extra charging during the day.\n\nAll three new iPhones met or exceeded that in my real-world use. However, my video streaming tests didn\u2019t always show as big of a leap in battery life as my actual usage\u2014nor as big as Apple\u2019s battery-life claims. Battery testing is a tricky thing. Between screen-brightness settings and our countless app options, we all use our phones differently. Here are my notes on all three phones.\n\niPhone 11: In my full day using the 11 as my primary phone (email, a lot of Twitter and texting, phone calls, too much tapping through Instagram), I was left with a 15% charge by 11:30 p.m. The iPhone 11 streamed video on YouTube for 13 hours and 20 minutes\u2014about 20 minutes longer than the XR. (Apple promises an extra hour of battery life.)\n\niPhone 11 Pro: With the 11 Pro as my primary phone, I was left with just under a 10% charge at 11 p.m. That\u2019s far longer than I used to get with the X but not as long as with the 11. The 11 Pro streamed video on YouTube for 13 hours\u2014three hours longer than the XS.\n\niPhone 11 Pro Max: On 11 Pro Max battery-testing day, I was left with a roughly 20% charge by lights out. I could go to sleep and wake up with enough juice to get me through the morning. Even after a grueling day of camera testing at the New York Renaissance Faire, it had 25% left, while the other two were in the dreaded 10% territory.\n\nWhy are the Pro phones lasting so much longer? The screen and processor are more power efficient, but they also have bigger batteries\u2014part of the reason they\u2019re a fraction of an ounce heavier and 0.02 inches thicker.\n\nMiracles happen, my friends. After more than a decade of including the rinky-dink five-watt charging cube in the box, the Pros finally include faster 18-watt chargers. They went from zero to 50% in just 30 minutes.\n\nThe standard iPhone 11 has two cameras, a wide angle and an ultra-wide angle. The Pro models have both of those, along with a telephoto. Photo: David Chow For The Wall Street Journal\n\nTwo Cameras or Three?\n\nAfter snapping 1,000 photos in over a dozen settings with a bevy of smartphones\u2014the new models, older iPhones and even some Android competitors\u2014here\u2019s my assessment of the new camera features.\n\nWide shots: How hard is it to just step back for a wider shot? That was my thought when I heard Apple was adding a wide-angle lens to the iPhones. I was wrong.\n\nThe telephoto, wide and ultra-wide lenses on the Pro models let you capture different parts of a scene without ever moving. Photo: Joanna Stern/The Wall Street Journal\n\nI found myself using the ultra-wide-angle lens on all three phones all the time. Landscapes look great but so do tighter shots\u2014like one of my son standing in the hallway, which looked like the work of an artist, with minimal fisheye distortion.\n\nNight mode: In low-light situations (a dark restaurant, a night flight), the camera automatically goes into night mode, indicated by a little yellow icon. Snap a photo and it prompts you to hold still for a few seconds. In the background, the camera system gathers multiple images and then forms a brighter, crisper shot than you\u2019d get in regular shooting.\n\nNight mode vs. no night mode. The new low-light setting turns on automatically on all three of the new iPhones in dark or dimly lit conditions. Photo: Joanna Stern/The Wall Street Journal\n\nIt feels like a magic trick, and I ended up taking pretty impressive illuminated shots. But the Google Pixel 3\u2019s Night Sight mode produced low-light photos that were often even better.\n\nI also learned two important things: to tell my subjects to freeze like mannequins, and to hold my breath so I don\u2019t move during the pause. Movement can cause funky light streaks. That\u2019s why I wish the feature were easier to disable. Plus, the new sensors in the wide-angle camera improve regular low-light shots, too. (Night mode and the camera app also froze from time to time\u2014one of several iOS 13 bugs I encountered during my tests.)\n\nPortrait mode: For the most part, portrait mode\u2014where the phone artfully blurs the background\u2014looks the same as it has for years. It doesn\u2019t always blur edges perfectly, but it\u2019s a nice option. On the iPhone 11 Pro, you now have a choice of shooting portrait mode with the wide or telephoto lenses.\n\nThe iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max now let you shoot portrait-mode shots using the telephoto and wide lenses. Portrait mode, available on all the new phones, still struggles with some sharp edges. Photo: Joanna Stern/The Wall Street Journal\n\nOn the basic iPhone 11, it\u2019s only available on the standard wide-angle lens. But unlike the XR, the 11 now lets you shoot portrait mode with your favorite pet. I can confirm it works with dogs and birds alike.\n\nVideo: If you shoot a lot of video, you\u2019ll notice improved stabilization. At the Renaissance Faire, I handed the iPhone 11 Pro Max and the older iPhone XS Max to a knight on horseback for a joust. Both shots are still bouncy, but the Pro\u2019s footage is smoother and easier to watch.\n\nPerhaps even more significant, you can finally switch lenses for shooting. Zooming in and out, from one lens to another, is smooth, but I did find the cameras sometimes struggled to quickly refocus.\n\nWhen one iPhone camera array rubbed up against the other iPhone\u2019s screen, it left a permanent scratch.

Join the conversation below.\n\nBattery and camera weren\u2019t the only iPhone 11 highlights, though they were certainly the biggest. I didn\u2019t really test the added water and dust resistance, but I did discover one thing by accident: The supposedly more durable glass still isn\u2019t scratch resistant. When I carried two iPhones together during a shoot, the cameras on one rubbed against the screen of another, causing some permanent scratches. Best advice: Don\u2019t carry two iPhones at once.\n\nAs for your buying decision, with its price-to-feature ratio, the $700 iPhone 11 has the broadest appeal. However, there are far more choices than just these three phones, as I cover in my other column.\n\nLast year\u2019s XR is now a great value at $600. If you\u2019re a photography nut and are OK spending over $1,000 for the absolute best, the Pros are there for you. Just don\u2019t be mad when next year\u2019s iPhones\u2014potentially with 5G connectivity\u2014blow them away.\n\nHeck, you could also buy the Pro Max, just so you can tell your grandchildren about the iPhone that finally lasted more than a day on a single charge.\n\nThough it\u2019s hard to tell, the latest iPhones are a hair thicker than their predecessors. It isn\u2019t a coincidence that they also have better battery life.
