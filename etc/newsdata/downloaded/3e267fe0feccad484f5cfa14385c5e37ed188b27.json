It\u2019s a problem if it happens to someone\u2019s personal computer. But if crooks break into a town\u2019s computer system, they can shut down important information like police records and tax payments.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nThat\u2019s probably why there\u2019s an apparent increase in ransomware attacks targeting municipal government agencies. The cybersecurity firm Recorded Future said that, as of May, more than 170 city, county or state government systems had been attacked since 2013, including at least 45 police and sheriff\u2019s offices.\n\nRansomware is most frequently spread through malicious links or attachments in emails. Adjusted losses attributed to ransomware rose from $2.3 million in 2017 to $3.6 million in 2018, according to the FBI. But authorities have said they may only be aware of a small fraction of these incidents, as some victims are too embarrassed to report the attacks.\n\nThe FBI encourages ransomware victims to not pay the requested ransom, as it encourages the attackers to continue and doesn\u2019t guarantee that they will actually release the encrypted files.\n\nBut some local governments, faced with the loss of irreplaceable data, have given in and paid. Here\u2019s a look at some recent ransomware attacks that have hit municipal governments and how much they cost:\n\nBaltimore, Maryland \u2014 May 2019\n\nRansomware hit the city on May 7 and the hackers initially demanded a ransom of $80,000.\n\nOfficials have estimated recovering from the attack will cost $18.2 million. The city\u2019s information technology office has spent $4.6 million on recovery efforts since and expect to spend another $5.4 million by the end of the year. Officials said another $8.2 million in revenue was lost or delayed as a result of the attack.\n\nInvestigators have also found that more than one group had breached Baltimore\u2019s computer network.\n\nIn August, officials voted to transfer $6 million from a fund for parks and public facilities to help cover the costs of the attack. The city council is also considering a contract for cyber liability coverage.\n\nAkron, Ohio \u2014 January 2019\n\nA cyberattack forced the city to shut down much of its 311 system at the tail end of a severe snowstorm. Officials said the hackers were demanding a \u201cfive-figure sum\u201d of money.\n\nMayor Dan Horrigan asked Gov. Mike DeWine for help from the Ohio National Guard Cyber Team. The governor approved it, and the state sent eight cybersecurity experts.\n\nAkron didn\u2019t need to pay the ransom because it had daily back-ups of all city files, officials said.\n\nLincoln County, North Carolina \u2014 July-August 2019\n\nThe county suffered two cyberattacks last summer. The first came on July 26, and authorities said hackers held the sheriff\u2019s office computers and website hostage.\n\nThe second attack came on the night of Aug. 6 and crippled county communications, but officials said they were not made aware of any ransom requests.\n\nThe county worked with the FBI and the North Carolina National Guard\u2019s IT disaster relief team to investigate and recover from the attacks. The sheriff\u2019s office has been rebuilding their servers in stages, and the new systems should be safer. They\u2019ve already spent $200,000 to upgrade equipment.\n\nLake City, Florida \u2014 June 2019\n\nA cyberattack disabled the city\u2019s computer systems for days. The town worked with the FBI and outside consultants to restore phone lines, email and utility payments.\n\nThe city\u2019s information technology director was fired. City leaders approved paying the hackers 42 bitcoin, worth about $460,000, through its insurance company.\n\nRiviera Beach, Florida \u2014 May-June 2019\n\nHackers apparently got into the city\u2019s computer system when a police department employee clicked on a malicious link in an email. The city lost its email system and 911 dispatchers were unable to enter calls into the computer.\n\nOfficials agreed to have the city\u2019s insurer pay 65 bitcoin, worth about $600,000, as it became apparent they wouldn\u2019t be able to regain access to data, which hadn\u2019t been backed up.\n\nThe city council also voted to spend $941,000 on hundreds of new computers and other hardware in order to rebuild its IT infrastructure.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Cybercriminals have shut down municipal computer systems and demanded ransoms.", "authors": ["James Leggate"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/12/0/0/Hacker-using-phone-iStock.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
