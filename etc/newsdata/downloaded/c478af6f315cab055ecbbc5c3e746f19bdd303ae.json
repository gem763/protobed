Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., or some other cast of characters.\n\nBut a large part of our disarray comes not from these symptomatic individuals, but from a whole lot of Americans having figuratively lost their minds. Our recent leadership is a reflection of that, not a cause of that.\n\nGOP SHIFTS FOCUS TO HOUSE DEM 'SQUAD' IN CAMPAIGN ATTACKS\n\nOnce upon a time, politics was just that \u2014 politics.\n\nIn recent years, politics has become both a religion and a sport for many, a dangerous path that creates teams, but without rules and good sportsmanship. And unlike traditional sports, there are no long-term winners. We all lose.\n\nAs former Defense Secretary James Mattis said in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed, tribalism is a real threat for America. His words resonate with me. There are many of us somewhere \u201cin the center\u201d\u2014 whether like me (a free market capitalist and defender of individual rights) or other moderate Democrats, Libertarians, classical liberals and moderate Republicans \u2014 who try to stick to principles over people and parties.\n\nWhen you believe in principles, you criticize people when you disagree with their actions and laud them when you agree. It\u2019s not cut and dried \u2014 not all or nothing. It\u2019s nuanced, as life and policy are.\n\nBut deep dives have been thrown out the window. Everything has been turned into a caricature, and if you don\u2019t fall in line on either side, you can become the object of ridicule, threats or other mob behaviors.\n\nThink about it. I bet that our great thought leaders of years past, like economist Milton Friedman, would be ostracized in a hot minute today.\n\nOur current social cycle is a vicious one that, whether you love Trump or despise him, created the ability for him to be elected president. Those on the left who despise him, or at least don\u2019t like him, still don\u2019t realize or accept their part in creating him.\n\nThe same name-calling behaviors, the bullying others for having a different opinion \u2014 or even being tangentially connected to someone who has an opinion they don\u2019t deem appropriate \u2014 is what created Trump. And, if they don\u2019t stop that, he will surely be elected again.\n\nThose who adore Trump, who feel like he gave them back some power in the face of bullying and underrepresentation, also are at fault. Because if you dare criticize something the president does (and there are many areas that are fair game for criticism), you are also ostracized or cast aside.\n\nGood people operate at hysteria levels 24 hours a day. Family relationships and friendships break apart. And over what?\n\nNot being able to give the president any criticism in areas like trade, global alliances or his online bullying and divisive language, doesn\u2019t allow for any legitimate feedback or for him to be thoughtful about those things. That mindset gives rise to opposing fringe politicians.\n\nThis vicious cycle then repeats. Everything becomes an outrage.\n\nGood people operate at hysteria levels 24 hours a day. Family relationships and friendships break apart. And over what? Because some people can\u2019t appreciate that not everyone holds exactly every same opinion as them and deems any dissent unworthy?\n\nThat\u2019s not American. That\u2019s insanity.\n\nOur lives and the policies that shape us are full of nuance. But social media and our communication have been reduced to out-of-context sound bites, so that when someone is against \u201cThe Fluffy Puppy Bill,\u201d for instance, it may not be that they, in fact, hate puppies, but rather that the bill was mostly about increases in spending for geckos (no disrespect meant to geckos).\n\nToday, though, those opposing such a bill would be mocked as \"puppy haters,\" regardless of their reasonable intentions.\n\nWe need more focus on people\u2019s concrete actions and less on their purported beliefs. We need less speculation and meanness. We need to put ideas at the forefront and stop with personal attacks and perpetual emotional outrage.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nPeople need to be able to give feedback without name-calling and ad hominem attacks. If we're ever going to live up to being the United States of America, this needs to change. And, while providing possible solutions would take another column, each of us can do our part to not make everything so one-sided.\n\nThe pushback to this will be \u201cwhataboutism.\" There is always something you can look back to in order to score a talking point. But only looking backward doesn\u2019t move us forward.\n\nOthers will say it starts at the top, with our leaders, but one person\u2019s bad behavior doesn\u2019t excuse yours. It\u2019s akin to saying, \u201cBut he started it!\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWe also need more focus on principles over political parties. At the end of the day, our president and lawmakers don\u2019t make us great; our people do. Politicians will come and go, and we need to all feel represented when \u201cour team\u201d isn\u2019t in power.\n\nAnd that starts with every one of us.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY CAROL ROTH", "description": "The only way to unite America and heal our divides is for all of us to stop focusing on our differences and end the personal attacks and perpetual emotional outrage.", "authors": ["Carol Roth", "Carol Roth Is The Creator Of The"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/08/01/694940094001_6066767842001_6066759415001-vs.jpg"}
