What should our drug laws aim to do? The current approach aims to minimise drug use, and that has proved to be a spectacular failure by any measure.\n\nThe mantra of the Home Office is to simultaneously reduce the supply and demand for drugs. Trends for both show this isn\u2019t working. Today\u2019s own Home Office survey shows rising demand and a greater proportion of people saying they can access drugs within 24 hours.\n\nSuch ease of access to a product remains an ambition for many retailers but is proving all too easy for those supplying illicit drugs. It shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone that drug dealers have proved adept at responding to demand \u2013 they have embraced social media platforms to provide improved access to their products.\n\nOur current drug laws were formulated at the time decimalisation was introduced in the 1970s. It\u2019s no wonder an increasing number of us don\u2019t see the law as relevant. But the law should be relevant as it has the potential to do good.\n\nPerhaps the starkest indicator of failure in our current approach to drug policy is the record numbers dying as a result of drug use.\n\nThe philosophy of viewing drugs as a criminal matter rather than a health one is old fashioned and costly. Even if the record numbers of deaths isn\u2019t persuasive the financial waste of tax-payers money might sway you, with an estimated \u00a310bn spent annually on propping up the current outdated policy through policing, crime and healthcare.\n\nSurely we can produce a better outcome with such a large proportion of tax-payers money?\n\nSo this is an area where our policy makers could make a real impact and reduce mortality. But our politicians seem to be paralysed, stuck in a hypocritical approach to drug use where they confess to using drugs but refuse to protect the people they serve by providing an evidenced based approach to drug policy. Perhaps we get the politicians we deserve.", "description": "One in three people now confess to using a drug, so if evidence were needed that our drug laws are redundant the sheer number of people breaking the law is a significant indicator.
