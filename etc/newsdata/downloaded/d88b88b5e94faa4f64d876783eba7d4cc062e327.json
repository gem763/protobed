But a source familiar with the matter said it alleged \u201cmultiple acts\u201d by Trump, not just a phone call with a foreign leader. The source requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.\n\nTrump dismissed the Sept. 12 complaint from the whistleblower within the intelligence community as a partisan hit against him.\n\nTrump had spoken with Ukraine\u2019s recently elected president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, less than three weeks before the complaint was filed. Trump is due to meet Zelenskiy during a United Nations gathering in New York.\n\nThe July 25 call between the leaders is under investigation by three Democratic-led House committees, who want to know if Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, tried to pressure the Ukrainian government into aiding Trump\u2019s re-election campaign.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Trump urged Zelenskiy about eight times during the call to work with Giuliani to investigate Biden and Biden\u2019s son. The Washington Post and New York Times also reported details of the call.\n\nTrump said earlier on Friday he did not know the identity of the whistleblower nor the precise accusations but that all of his conversations with foreign leaders had been appropriate.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what I discussed but I will say this: somebody ought to look into Joe Biden\u2019s statement because it was disgraceful, where he talked about millions of dollars that he is not giving to a certain country unless a certain prosecutor is taken off the case. Somebody ought to look into that,\u201d Trump said.\n\nIn a statement, Biden said the reports about Trump\u2019s pressure on the call - if true - showed the president abused his office for his own gain. Biden urged the White House to release a transcript of the call and allow Congress to hear from the whistleblower.\n\n\u201cSuch clear-cut corruption damages and diminishes our institutions of government by making them tools of a personal political vendetta,\u201d Biden said.\n\nGiuliani said on CNN on Thursday he had asked the Ukrainian government to investigate Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Biden.\n\nOn Friday, Giuliani was seen by Reuters reporters at the Trump International Hotel, a few blocks away from the White House, sitting next to Lev Parnas, a Ukrainian businessman with whom he has recently been working. Giuliani declined comment.\n\nHe later was seen at a White House state dinner.\n\nGiuliani has alleged that as vice president, Biden sought the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was investigating his son\u2019s business dealings. Biden and his son have denied the charge.\n\nThe former prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, had been criticized by the U.S. government and the European Union for larger issues, including blocking reforms to Ukraine\u2019s legal system. Ukraine\u2019s parliament approved his dismissal in March 2016.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump walks to address the media before boarding Marine One for a trip to New Mexico, on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, U.S., September 16, 2019.

Pence told reporters at the time that he had not discussed Biden in the meeting but did focus on \u201cthe issue of public corruption.\u201d\n\nAn intelligence community watchdog determined that the whistleblower complaint was credible and should be shared with congressional leaders through a process laid out by U.S. law.\n\nThat determination was overridden by acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire after consulting with the Justice Department. Maguire is slated to testify next week at the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nDemocratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the administration was violating federal law by \u201cstonewalling\u201d a congressional inquiry.\n\n\u201cReports of a reliable whistleblower complaint regarding the president\u2019s communications with a foreign leader raise grave, urgent concerns for our national security,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cIf the president has done what has been alleged, then he is stepping into a dangerous minefield with serious repercussions for his administration and our democracy.\u201d\n\nA senior Democratic member of the House Judiciary Committee, which is considering whether to impeach Trump, said the incident could feed into the panel\u2019s deliberations.\n\n\u201cThis is deadly serious,\u201d Representative David Cicilline said on Twitter. \u201cIf the President does not allow the whistleblower complaint against him to be turned over to Congress, we will add it to the Articles of Impeachment.\u201d", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly pressured Ukraine's president to investigate Joe Biden, one of Trump's chief political rivals, in a July phone call, according to reports on Friday by the Wall Street Journal and other U.S. media outlets.", "authors": ["Jonathan Landay", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1432148856&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J1HP", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
