For some reason, the former top diplomat decided to weigh in on a controversy involving the press and the royals in an interview with the Times of London. While doing a press tour for her new book Gutsy Women, Hillary accused the tabloids of unfairly scrutinizing former American Meghan Markle, and said she believes the now-princess\u2019 biracial ethnicity is at least part of the reason:\n\nHillary Clinton defended Meghan Markle in a new interview, saying her biracial background \u201ccertainly\u201d played a role in the British tabloids\u2019 harsh treatment of her. \u201cI do want to say that the way she\u2019s been treated is inexplicable,\u201d the former Secretary of State told The Sunday Times of London in an interview. \u201cIf the explanation is that she\u2019s biracial, then shame on everybody,\u201d Clinton said \u2014 adding she believes race is \u201ccertainly part of it.\u201d\n\nFirst of all, whether it\u2019s true or not, why is Hillary Clinton lecturing Brits over their alleged latent racism? It\u2019s as much a non-sequitur as having Boris Johnson or David Cameron drop by to lecture us on whatever wokeness deficiency they might see among Americans. Whether or not it\u2019s factual is almost beside the point. How would they grasp the issue without living here to know the parameters of the issue? It\u2019s cultural imperialism of the kind over which we actually do get lectured by our elites.\n\nAnyway, the charge is almost impossible to verify, plus it ignores decades of rabid coverage and criticism of the royals long before Markle showed up on the scene. British tabloids have hounded royals without shame or ethics at least since Charles courted Diana, and the tabloids literally chased Diana to her death 22 years ago. It\u2019s not difficult to believe that the tabloids are treating Markle unfairly, but they\u2019ve been doing that with royals for a very long time without needing racism as animus. One would imagine that Markle would have understood that before marrying into the highest-profile, most privileged family in the West, if not the world.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not pretend that the royals aren\u2019t playing the media at the same time. Prince Harry and Princess Meghan have been doing publicity for a show that will air this weekend titled Harry and Meghan: An African Journey, a show that includes exclusive looks at their baby Archie. The show also airs their side of the couple\u2019s fight against the tabloids while at the same time serving as a platform for their self-promotion. If the British tabloids treated anyone else outside of the royal family unfairly, would they also get an ITV Sunday night PR film to set the record straight?\n\nIf the royals want to use accusations of racism as a brush-back pitch, that might be one thing. Why Hillary feels the need to inject herself into that feud is impossible to grasp, unless it\u2019s out of solidarity from one self-regarded royal to another.", "description": "How about a little cultural imperialism?", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hillary-view.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
