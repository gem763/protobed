(He escaped indictment in Mississippi and conviction in Florida.) And it wasn\u2019t until more recently that Texas Ranger James Holland managed to win over Little\u2019s trust, leading the imprisoned killer to confess to 93 killings. So far, 50 of the purported cases have been verified by FBI. On Sunday, the FBI released information on five of those unmatched cases in hopes that the public will help identify the victims.", "description": "This week, the FBI announced that Samuel Little confessed to 93 murders spanning 35 years", "authors": ["Lena Felton", "Lena Felton Is A Multiplatform Editor At The Lily.
