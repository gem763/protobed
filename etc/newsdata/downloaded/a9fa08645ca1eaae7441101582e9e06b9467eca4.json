That\u2019s my impression of Washington right now. There\u2019s something quiet going on, a mood shift.\n\nImpeachment of course will happen. The House will support whatever charges are ultimately introduced because most Democrats think the president is not fully sane and at least somewhat criminal. Also they\u2019re Democrats and he\u2019s a Republican. The charges will involve some level of foreign-policy malfeasance.\n\nThe ultimate outcome depends on the Senate. It takes 67 votes to convict. Republicans control the Senate 53-47, and it is unlikely 20 of them will agree to remove a president of their own party. An acquittal is likely but not fated, because we live in the age of the unexpected.\n\nHere are three reasons to think the situation is more fluid than we realize.\n\nFirst, the president, confident of acquittal, has chosen this moment to let his inner crazy flourish daily and dramatically\u2014the fights and meltdowns, the insults, the Erdogan letter. Just when the president needs to be enacting a certain stability he enacts its opposite. It is possible he doesn\u2019t appreciate the jeopardy he\u2019s in with impeachment bearing down; it is possible he knows and what behavioral discipline he has is wearing down.\n\nThe second is that the Republican leader of the Senate, Mitch McConnell, told his caucus this week to be prepared for a trial that will go six days a week and could last six to eight weeks. In September there had been talk the Senate might receive articles of impeachment and execute a quick, brief response\u2014a short trial, or maybe a motion to dismiss. Mr. McConnell told CNBC then that the Senate would have \u201cno choice\u201d but to take up impeachment, but \u201chow long you are on it is a different matter.\u201d Now he sees the need for a major and lengthy undertaking. Part of the reason would be practical: He is blunting attack lines that the Republicans arrogantly refused to give impeachment the time it deserves. But his decision also gives room for the unexpected\u2014big and serious charges that sweep public opinion and change senators\u2019 votes. \u201cThere is a mood change in terms of how much they can tolerate,\u201d said a former high Senate staffer. Senators never know day to day how bad things will get.\n\nThe third reason is the number of foreign-policy professionals who are not ducking testimony in the House but plan to testify or have already. Suppressed opposition to President Trump among foreign-service officers and others is busting out.\n\nThe president is daily eroding his position. His Syria decision was followed by wholly predictable tragedy; it may or may not have been eased by the announcement Thursday of a five-day cease-fire. Before that the House voted 354-60, including 129 Republicans, to rebuke the president. There was the crazy letter to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, which was alternately pleading (\u201cYou can make a great deal. . . . I will call you later\u201d) and threatening (\u201cI don\u2019t want to be responsible for destroying the Turkish economy\u2014and I will\u201d).\n\nThere was the Cabinet Room meeting with congressional leaders, the insults hurled and the wildness of the photo that said it all\u2014the angry president; Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, standing and pointing at him; and the head of Gen. Mark Milley, the new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, bowed in\u2014embarrassment? Horror? His was not the only bowed head.\n\nThe president soon tweeted about a constitutional officer of the U.S. House, who is third in line for the presidency: \u201cNancy Pelosi needs help fast! There is either something wrong with her \u2018upstairs\u2019 or she just plain doesn\u2019t like our great Country. She had a total meltdown in the White House today. It was very sad to watch. Pray for her, she is a very sick person!\u201d\n\nAs the Democratic leaders departed, he reportedly called out, \u201cSee you at the polls.\u201d Mr. Trump is confident that he holds the cards here\u2014he\u2019s got the Senate, and the base of the party says all these issues should be worked out in the 2020 election. But he is seriously weakening his hand by how he acts.\n\nThat meeting will only fortify Mrs. Pelosi\u2019s determination to impeach him.\n\nThe president tweeted out the picture of that meeting just as the White House made public the Erdogan letter\u2014because they think it made the president look good. Which underscored the sense that he has no heavyweight advisers around him\u2014the generals are gone, the competent fled, he\u2019s careening around surrounded by second raters, opportunists, naifs and demoralized midlevel people who can\u2019t believe what they\u2019re seeing.\n\nAgain, everything depends on the quality and seriousness of the House hearings. Polling on impeachment has been fairly consistent, with Gallup reporting Thursday 52% supporting the president\u2019s impeachment and removal.\n\nSerious and dramatic hearings would move the needle on public opinion, tripping it into seriously negative territory for the president.\n\nAnd if the needle moves, the Senate will move in the same direction.\n\nBut the subject matter will probably have to be bigger than the Ukraine phone call, which is not, as some have said, too complicated for the American people to understand, but easy to understand. An American ally needed money, and its new leader needed a meeting with the American president to bolster his position back home. It was made clear that the money and the meeting were contingent on the launching of a probe politically advantageous to Mr. Trump and disadvantageous to a possible 2020 rival.\n\nEveryone gets it, most everyone believes it happened, no one approves of it\u2014but it probably isn\u2019t enough. People have absorbed it and know how they feel: It was Mr. Trump being gross. No news there.\n\nTruly decisive testimony and information would have to be broader and deeper, bigger. Rudy Giuliani\u2019s dealings with Ukraine? That seems an outgrowth of the original whistleblower charges, a screwy story with a cast of characters\u2014 Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, natives of Ukraine and Belarus, respectively, who make you think of Sen. Howard Baker\u2019s question to the Watergate bagman Tony Ulasewicz: \u201cWho thought you up?\u201d\n\nMore important will be a text or subtext of serious and consistent foreign-policy malfeasance that the public comes to believe is an actual threat to national security. Something they experience as alarming.\n\nIt cannot be merely that the president holds different views and proceeds in different ways than the elites of both parties. It can\u2019t look like \u201cthe blob\u201d fighting back\u2014fancy-pants establishment types, whose feathers have been ruffled by a muddy-booted Jacksonian, getting their revenge. It can\u2019t look like the Deep State striking back at a president who threatened their corrupt ways.\n\nIt will have to be serious and sincere professionals who testify believably that the administration is corrupt and its corruption has harmed the country. The witnesses will have to seem motivated by a sense of duty to institutions and protectiveness toward their country.\n\nAnd the hearings had better start to come across as an honest, good-faith effort in which Republican members of Congress are treated squarely and in line with previous protocols and traditions.\n\nWith all that the needle moves. Without it, it does not.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://peggynoonan.com/wp-content/uploads/im-118185turtletrap-300x200.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
