In 2018, 4,359 deaths were directly attributed to substance misuse in England and Wales \u2013 a 16 per cent increase in a year \u2013 while Scotland had a higher rate of drug-related deaths than any other EU country last year, after a 27 per cent increase brought the total to its highest level since records began 23 years ago.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

The government should learn lessons from the international experience, including countries like Portugal and [cities such as] Frankfurt.\u201d\n\nDr James Nicholls, chief executive at Transform Drug Policy Foundation, welcomed the demands for the government take a public health approach, saying ministers must act on the report \u201cas a matter of life or death\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe also support the call for decriminalisation of people in possession of drugs. Moving drugs to the Department of Health and establishing harm reduction at the heart of UK drug policy is crucial if we are to save lives.\n\n\u201cHowever, if we are to seriously get drugs under control we must legalise and regulate their supply as well as decriminalising people who use them.\u201d\n\nCara Lavan, of the Anyone\u2019s Child campaign group, echoed the calls for regulation of the supply of drugs, saying: \u201cWe welcome the committees call for the decriminalisation of the drug trade but would urge them to go further.\n\n\u201cThe government must control and regulate the trade if they want to remove organised criminals from the market. Only then will we stop our family, friends and loved ones from dying.\u201d\n\nA government spokesperson said: \u201cWe are committed to reducing the use of drugs and the harms they cause and the Home Office has commissioned a major independent review to examine these issues.\n\n\u201cWe must prevent drug use in our communities, support people through treatment and recovery, and tackle the supply of illegal drugs.\n\n\u201cThe government has no plans to decriminalise drug possession. The decriminalisation of drug possession in the UK would not eliminate the crime committed by the illicit trade, nor would it address the harms associated with drug dependence and the misery that this can cause to families and communities.\u201d", "description": "Ministers must consider decriminalising the possession of drugs, MPs have said in a new report that calls for \u201cradical change\u201d\u00a0to the UK\u2019s\u00a0approach.
