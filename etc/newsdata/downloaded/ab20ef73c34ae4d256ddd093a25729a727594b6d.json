Testimony before House lawmakers has depicted Morrison, a Bolton acolyte, as similarly unnerved by Trump\u2019s desire to withhold all assistance from Ukraine. Morrison also kept the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, William Taylor, abreast of developments inside the White House.\n\nBut Patel\u2019s involvement demonstrates that the president had at least some support for the scheme from within the NSC, and has given House impeachment investigators yet another name to add to their witness list\u2014a name they are already familiar with, given Patel\u2019s previous work in Congress to discredit the Russia investigation.\n\nPatel joined the National Security Council\u2019s International Organizations and Alliances directorate in February and was promoted to a senior counterterrorism role around the same time as Trump\u2019s fateful call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he urged the newly elected leader to investigate Biden and \u201cget to the bottom of\u201d Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nThe type of Ukraine work Patel was doing that Hill described would not be within his purview as a senior counterterrorism adviser, said Joshua Geltzer, who held Patel\u2019s position early on in the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cIf true, this sort of activity seems wildly outside the scope of anything a counterterrorism senior director at NSC should be spending their time on,\u201d Geltzer said. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, it politicizes a piece of the NSC staff that administrations of both parties have worked for decades to keep as apolitical as possible.\u201d\n\nPatel\u2019s name has been brought up in several recent depositions, according to another person with direct knowledge of the interviews, in connection with the shadow foreign policy campaign Trump allegedly directed in an effort to extract political favors from the newly elected Zelensky.\n\nOn Tuesday, Taylor \u2014 who remains the acting ambassador in Kiev \u2014 gave lawmakers one of the most detailed timelines to date of how Trump and his allies sought to leverage American military and diplomatic might to coerce Zelensky into a coordinated campaign to damage Joe Biden, Trump\u2019s chief political rival. Taylor testified that he was told that Trump wanted to withhold security assistance to Ukraine unless Zelensky agreed to announce an investigation into Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company on whose board Biden\u2019s son Hunter served.\n\nAmbassador William Taylor. | J.

It accused the FBI of omitting \u201cthe role of the\u201d Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign in paying Steele for his research on the Trump campaign, and led Trump to accuse DOJ and FBI leaders of politicizing \u201cthe sacred investigative process in favor of Democrats and against Republicans.\u201d\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, accused Nunes and the Republicans of politicizing law enforcement and the Russia investigation in an effort to shield the president.\n\nPrior to that, Patel circulated an internal memo urging Nunes to hold top DOJ and FBI officials in contempt for failing to turn over documents related to the warrant process undertaken during the transition period.\n\nHe also traveled to London in 2017\u2014without the knowledge of the U.S. embassy, the British government, or Adam Schiff, then the committee\u2019s ranking member\u2014in search of Steele, whose lawyer denied Patel access to his client.\n\nPatel\u2019s ascension to the NSC staff earlier this year\u2014and particularly his promotion to a senior counterterrorism role that was created for him within the directorate, according to a former official familiar with the matter\u2014raised eyebrows among some in the NSC who didn\u2019t believe he was experienced enough for the role, despite a two-year stint from 2014-2016 as a counterterrorism prosecutor at the Justice Department.\n\nHis \u201cunique access\u201d to the West Wing, and the ease with which he has been able to interact directly with the president without NSC leadership\u2019s involvement, has also struck some as unusual, the former official said.\n\nNahal Toosi contributed reporting.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/79/8b/635c57634befa2d88fb701475de7/20191023-devin-nunes-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
