European diplomats have tried to get Iran and the US in the same room ever since Donald Trump canceled the JCPOA or \u201cIran deal\u201d and adopted his \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d sanctions campaign over Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons development. Tehran has refused to negotiate unless the US lifts sanctions, a point Rouhani\u2019s government reiterated earlier this week.\n\nTo hear him tell it now, the US called his bluff \u2014 and he reneged anyway:\n\nThe United States offered to remove all sanctions on Iran in exchange for talks but Tehran has not yet accepted the offer due to the current \u201ctoxic atmosphere\u201d, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Friday. \u2026 \u201cIt was up for debate what sanctions will be lifted and they (the United States) had said clearly that we will lift all sanctions,\u201d Rouhani said, according to his official website. Iran was ready for negotiations but not in an atmosphere of sanctions and pressure, the Iranian president said. \u201cThis action wasn\u2019t in a manner that was acceptable, meaning that in the atmosphere of sanctions and the existence of sanctions and the toxic atmosphere of maximum pressure, even if we want to negotiate with the Americans in the 5+1 framework, no one can predict what the end and result of this negotiation will be,\u201d he said.\n\nIf the US made that offer and Iran refused it, his friends in Europe are going to be pissed. They\u2019re already unhappy about Iran\u2019s new aggressions in the region, especially regarding shipping through the Straits of Hormuz and their attempts to end-run sanctions on Syria. France and Germany, Iran\u2019s major trading partners outside of the sanctions issues, just blamed Iran for the attack on the Saudi oil refinery, along with the UK\u2019s Boris Johnson.\n\nTrump hotly denied making any such offer, and in fact painted it as an Iranian demand:\n\nIran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on them in order to meet. I said, of course, NO! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s not entirely out of the realm of believability that Trump might have made such an offer, though. He has made remarks about finding ways to meet with Rouhani to dial down tensions, and reportedly was looking at a $15 billion \u201cbailout\u201d of Iran as a sweetener for talks. Trump hiked sanctions instead, but also sacked hardline national security adviser John Bolton at the same time. Combined with some of his other out-of-the-box foreign policy moves, and perhaps his political woes at home, such an offer would be possible. Perhaps not likely but not impossible either.\n\nAnd it might have been a smart move to do so, forcing Rouhani to shoot himself in the foot on the international stage. Despite his earlier attempts to make Trump the obstacle to talks, it\u2019s now pretty clear that Ali Khameini has Rouhani on a short leash indeed, and that Rouhani might have just gotten yanked back by it. If that\u2019s in fact what happened, it has provided a moment of clarity about Iran\u2019s intentions and the need to keep up the maximum pressure campaign until Khameini is ready to deal more honestly.", "description": "Call me, maybe?", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/trump-rouhani.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
