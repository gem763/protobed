In fact, the two sides don\u2019t even agree on who asked whom to meet.\n\nInterested in Trump Administration?

One of them, showing Pelosi standing and pointing toward the president, has since gone viral. The text accompanying the photo reads, \u201cNervous Nancy\u2019s unhinged meltdown,\u201d echoing Pelosi\u2019s criticism.\n\nThe tit-for-tat continued when the speaker subsequently turned the photo into the background on her Twitter page. When asked Thursday what was happening at the time the photo was taken, Pelosi smiled. \u201cI think I was excusing myself from the room,\u201d she said.\n\nPelosi said the president called her a \u201cthird-grade politician,\u201d at which time House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer urged her to leave the meeting. According to Democratic sources, as they left the room, Trump said, \u201cGoodbye, we\u2019ll see you at the polls.\u201d\n\nSchumer soon followed them, but hung back for a few minutes to express his concern over the security of ISIS prisoners formerly guarded by the Kurds.\n\nAt one point, Schumer began citing Trump\u2019s former secretary of defense, retired general James Mattis, who has warned ISIS will come back if the pressure on the terror group is relieved. According to sources, Trump interrupted, claiming credit for defeating ISIS and calling Mattis, \u201cthe world\u2019s most overrated general.\u201d\n\nAfter the meeting ended, Republicans gathered on the White House driveway to share their account of what happened behind closed doors.\n\n\u201cI see a pattern of behavior with Speaker Nancy Pelosi,\u201d House Minority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy said. \u201cUnfortunately, the Speaker tries to make everything political. Her own statements weren\u2019t productive. To storm out of a meeting, which I\u2019ve watched time before during other crises, is really not the ability of a speaker or the style how a speaker should carry herself out.\u201d\n\nPelosi pushed back on the Republicans\u2019 account of how the meeting played out, and suggested a simple solution for achieving clarity.\n\n\u201cI think it would be interesting, you tell me, if we could have a recording of what goes on in those offices,\u201d Pelosi mused. \u201cBecause when they come out and say, \u2018Oh, this happened and that happened,\u2019 and you\u2019re like we must have been at two different meetings because that didn't happen.\u201d\n\nThat would be interesting, indeed.", "description": "After House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused him of", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/pelosi-trump-mtg-ht-ps-191017_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
