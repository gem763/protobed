For example, it would take saving over $1,495 in September 2018 (the latest data available) to match the buying power of $1,000 in January of 2000, according to the BLS' Inflation Calculator.\n\nAnd over the long term, inflation becomes increasingly powerful. It would take about $10,742 in September 2018 to match the buying power of $1,000 in January of 1950, according to the calculator.\n\nAlthough you do earn interest on money deposited in a savings account at a bank, the amount is far too low to keep up with the negative impact of inflation, Dalio points out.\n\n\"When you put your money in cash or short-term deposit, look at the interest rate you're getting in relationship to the inflation rate,\" Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, explains. \"You will see that your after tax return will be below the inflation rate. That means that you're experiencing a tax on that [money] equal to that difference. So you can't keep your money in cash. If you think that's safe, you're looking at it wrong \u2014 it's a sure losing strategy.\"\n\nRight now, the national average interest rate for a savings account is only 0.09 percent, according to data from Bankrate. Meanwhile, the Consumer Price Index \u2014 which measures inflation \u2014 rose 2.7 percent in the past year.\n\nSince keeping your money in a savings account is a guaranteed way to lose money, you have to turn your savings into investments, Dalio says. Then, your money is growing while you sleep.\n\n\"Over a longer period of time, equities [or stocks] will have a higher return, bonds will have a higher return, real estate will have a higher return than cash,\" he explains. While there are no guarantees in the stock market, from 1928 through 2017, the S&P 500 index produced a 9.8 percent average annualized total return.\n\n\"People with great ideas create productivity and get paid for it,\" Dalio says. \"It is better to invest in productivity than to not invest in productivity, because otherwise your money will lose buying power.\"\n\nDon't miss: Billionaire Ray Dalio remembers the moment he saw the financial crisis coming: 'This is the big one'\n\nLike this story?
