Officials are primarily employed to offer a service and the complaints point to dereliction of duty by some officials, yet they continue to draw a salary at the end of the month,\u201d Chauke said.\n\nAccording to Chauke, this behaviour by home affairs officials has been witnessed at ports of entry and gives a bad impression to visitors when they arrive in the country.\n\n\u201cThis is more concerning because the president [Cyril Ramaphosa] has anchored his economic growth drive on tourism, which will be undermined by poor service.\u201d\n\nChauke called for the drafting of a guiding framework on the use of cellphones at front desks to ensure standardisation. The framework should also include guidelines for how officials can be contacted in cases of family emergencies.\n\n\u201cOne of the keys to resolving the long queues at Home Affairs offices is by ensuring that officials are at their desks offering the services they are employed to do.\n\n\u201cWe are, of course, cognisant that one of the major causes of long queues is the downtime caused by unreliable information and technology software, but professional service at the department must improve,\u201d Chauke said.\n\n\u201cPublic service is based on adherence to Batho Pele principles, which call for high quality service and courtesy. As such, measures must be put in place to encourage and, where necessary, enforce adherence to these principles,\u201d he said.\n\nAt its first meeting of the year, the committee will invite the minister and the acting director-general to give an update on measures implemented to resolve this challenge.\n\nTalk to us Do you think banning cellphones will improve the level of service delivery at home affairs offices?
