However, retailers will also have to grapple with a shorter holiday shopping period and the fact that Christmas falls on a Wednesday.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nShoppers, brace yourselves. Black Friday is around the corner.\n\nThis year, America's most famous shopping day will fall on November 29, which is the day after Thanksgiving. And the experts at Adobe Analytics are expecting retailers to pull in as much as $7.5 billion in just one day. That's an increase of more than 20% over 2018.\n\nWhile Adobe Analytics is expecting online shopping to \"hit new highs\" over the holiday season, it also said that retailers will be grappling with a shorter holiday shopping period this year. There are only 26 days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year, which works out to be about a week less than the same period in 2018.\n\nBecause of this, retailers could miss out on as much as $1 billion in revenue, Adobe Analytics said. This may cause retailers to start sales earlier than usual. Walmart, for example, began its holiday sales online on Friday \u2014 about a week earlier than it did last year \u2014 and sales will start in stores on November 1.\n\nNPD analyst Marshal Cohen said that it's not only the shorter time period that retailers need to worry about. They are also likely to suffer from Christmas falling in the middle of the week, on a Wednesday, this year.\n\n\"It takes the pressure of Super Saturday away,\" Cohen told Business Insider's Hayley Peterson in a recent conversation. Super Saturday is the Saturday before Christmas Day, when many shoppers dash to stores to make last-minute purchases \u2014 and possibly spend more money because of the time crunch.\n\n\"Everybody sits there and says, 'Oh, I got a couple more days. I don't have to rush and fight the crowds.' That keeps people from fighting the frenzy, and the frenzy feeds the beast,\" he said.\n\nOverall, he's expecting a \"lackluster\" holiday season in 2019.", "description": "Shoppers will spend as much as $7.5 billion online over Black Friday 2019, according to Adobe Analytics.", "authors": ["Mary Hanbury"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db70c96dee01961fc6e9ca6?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
