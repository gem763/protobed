Understandably so. Given the massive online outcry every time Facebook changes the placement of a button, it\u2019s in UX designers\u2019 best interest to keep changes gradual and subtle. These days, the overarching philosophy of operating system design seems to be more about guiding the user\u2019s hand and making pronounced changes over time.\n\nBy the standard of annual consumer electronic upgrades that Apple has played a key role in perpetuating, updates to MacOS have, perhaps, been too subtle to foster the same sort of excitement. And honestly, that\u2019s perfectly fine. If a laptop is a flashy new car, the operating system is the great steering wheel that doesn\u2019t whiff out the window while you\u2019re driving.\n\nCatalina bucks the trend of recent MacOS updates a bit, in that the updates feel more pronounced. While it\u2019s true that the underlying principles are the same, there are some fundamental changes to day-to-day applications that both impact current use and lay the groundwork for future evolutions of the desktop operating system.\n\nThe most pronounced change is the much ballyhooed death of iTunes. The name will continue to exist in some residual instances, but for most intents and purposes, iTunes is being laid to rest with Catalina. Eighteen years was a pretty good run, of course, and signs of the once mighty music application will very much live on in Apple Music. But the new operating system finds the company very much planting its flag with premium content plays, the undisputed future of Apple\u2019s massive revenue generating machine.\n\nThat extends, of course, to the arrival of an upgraded TV app, which sets the stage for TV+ and Arcade, which also gets a handful of new arrivals to celebrate today\u2019s public release of Catalina. Podcasts also gets its own desktop app, but for now, at least, that\u2019s not a direct revenue source for the company. It is, however, important for the company to lay claim to the rapidly mainstreaming medium to which it indirectly gave name.\n\nThe arrival of Catalyst, meanwhile, lays the seeds for the future of Mac apps. Following the arrival of Apple\u2019s own News, Stocks, Voice Memos and Home, the company has opened the program up to all iPad developers to easily port their apps to the desktop. In a broader sense, the move continues to blur the lines between the two operating systems, for better and worse. For Apple, however, the decision is much more pragmatic: Mac software development has stalled as iOS has boomed. This is a simple solution to help keep thing this in check.\n\nAccessibility gets some much welcome updates, too, including much improved Voice Control, while Apple continues to add updates on the security side.\n\nFor the sake of this writeup, however, I\u2019m going to start with the bit that gets me the most excited: Sidecar. From my own perspective, Apple tends to bury the lede in its own feature set. Though I completely understand that it\u2019s simply not as universal an application as, say, Music, TV or (likely) Arcade. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m just getting back from yet another work trip (we held a little event in San Francisco), but Sidecar is a legit productivity game changer for me.\n\nAgainst all recommendations, I opted to run a beta of Catalina on my primary work machine. I know, I know, but when a beta drops while you\u2019re on the road, there\u2019s really no other option. I had some issues with the software I won\u2019t go into here, because betas gonna beta. I surprisingly had some issues getting the feature to work again with the latest version of iPadOs and the GM of Catalina, but everything should be smooth sailing by the final release.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt, of course, that this is the latest bit of Sherlocking \u2014 Apple integrating its own version of a popular third-party app into the operating system. But with something like this, there\u2019s really no competing with native support for most users. For those who need fair more nuanced use of things like Apple Pencil for, say, art making, Duet and Luna may still be worth checking out. If, like me, you just want to use the iPad as a second screen for some added real estate on the road, Sidecar\u2019s the thing.\n\nEnabling the feature is as simple as signing into all of your accounts: Make sure all of the relevant wireless protocols are turned on and then select the associated device from the drop-down. Your primary desktop can either be mirrored or used as an extension like a standard external monitor. The primary benefit of mirroring seems to be the ability to essentially use the screen as a touchscreen and iPad input. This should prove appealing for artists and a potential alternative to a pro tablet like the kind Wacom makes.\n\nFor me, the second display is the thing. Hooking up the extending real estate is a big sigh of relief, making it far easier to keep multiple windows open at the same time. Having Slack open on the iPad while I use Pages and Chrome on the main desktop is a pretty significant time saver.\n\nA small quibble: Keeping the Sidecar and display settings separate is a bit of an annoyance. The side I ultimately use for the iPad usually comes down to where I\u2019m sitting. It would be great to be able to swap on the fly. The addition of a virtual sidebar, meanwhile, is an interesting one, but pretty redundant in mirrored mode.\n\nAll told, however, Sidecar is far and away the best addition to MacOS in recent memory.\n\nI\u2019m less in love with the loss of iTunes. I totally understand why Apple made the switch, and honestly, I\u2019m a bit surprised it took them this long. I\u2019m a long-time Spotify user with no interest in making the jump to Apple Music. I prefer the device flexibility Spotify affords. Among other things, the move to Music feels like an opportunity to constantly push users to \u201cTry it Free.\u201d\n\nMusic can still be used to play a locally stored song, but the move to streaming service has weaned me off of the notion of digital music ownership. Somewhere in my apartment, there\u2019s a dusty old hard drive with hundreds of gigs of music, including weird old stuff that no one bothered to obscure the distribution rights for. Perhaps one day I\u2019ll dive back in, but honestly it\u2019s feeling increasingly less likely.\n\nThe principles of Podcast should be familiar to anyone who\u2019s ever used the mobile app. It\u2019s all pretty simple and, like Music, focused on discovery. Separating it from Apple Music seems to imply that the company doesn\u2019t have much interest in making huge Spotify-esque investments in the category. And for now, at least, why bother? Apple has a pretty massive head start in the space.\n\nApple TV gets a nice refresh, as well. It, too, is focused on discovery. Even more importantly for Apple\u2019s long game, however, it lays the groundwork from TV+, which is set to arrive next month. Premium channels like HBO, Showtime and Starz have been integrated here, in a bid to become a more robust cable replacement for cord cutters. Also nice is the arrival of a dedicated Kids section with curated all ages content.\n\nArcade certainly isn\u2019t what people are referring to when discussing the Mac\u2019s long journey to becoming a more serious gaming system. And while the titles are largely designed to be played on mobile devices, those subscribing at $5 a month will no doubt welcome the ability to play on the desktop. There\u2019s a lot to be said for the ability to take a quick work break with a round of the excellent Zelda knockoff/homage, Oceanhorn 2.\n\nPhotos adopts some key features from its mobile counterpart. AI/ML will determine and highlight your best shots, while images are categorized by days/months/years. Photo previews are large and now include live photo and video playback.\n\nOn the more pragmatic side of things, syncing and backup get some nice upgrades, now available outside of iTunes. That\u2019s a change that certainly makes sense, with those features now accessible through the Finder. Honestly, that\u2019s where they belong. Accessing them through iTunes always felt like a relic of the early iTunes/iPod days. This information is available directly in the main Finder sidebar.\n\nAs ever, there\u2019s no hesitation in recommending Mac users update to the latest version of the operating system. Of course, that\u2019s helped along by the fact that it\u2019s a free upgrade. This is one of the more transformative MacOS updates in recent memory, and most of the new features are welcome \u2014 as I said, I\u2019m not in love with Music for personal workflow reasons, but Sidecar is a biggie.\n\nMacOS Catalina is now available for all users.", "description": "For years now, Apple\u2019s been judicious with its MacOS updates.
