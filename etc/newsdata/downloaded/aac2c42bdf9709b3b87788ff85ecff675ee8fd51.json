Photo: PA Images via Getty Images\n\nAt certain points, Elton John\u2019s memoir, Me, reads like a conversation with Tahani Al-Jamil from The Good Place (and let\u2019s be honest, they probably know each other!). References abound \u2014 to feeling \u201cworse than I did after Ringo Starr\u2019s 1974 New Year\u2019s Eve Party,\u201d to how actress Elizabeth Hurley \u201chad stayed at Woodside [John\u2019s Berkshire home] after she had given birth to keep out of the media\u2019s glare,\u201d to John\u2019s \u201cold costumier Bob Mackie.\u201d (Don\u2019t worry, Cher\u2019s in there, too.) He\u2019s Eminem\u2019s AA sponsor, if you didn\u2019t know, and Lady Gaga is one of the godparents of his child. Prior to the book\u2019s release, stories about royalty, musicians, and actors alike came out, but that was only the tip of the iceberg. Here are 13 of the most iconic celebrity moments from his book.\n\nA random assortment of performers first told him he was gay: \u201cPeople form adjoining tables became involved. Because it was the Bag O\u2019 Nails, the people from adjoining tables all happened to be pop stars, which lent everything an increasingly surreal edge. Cindy Birdsong from the Supremes chipped in \u2014 I\u2019d known her back in the Bluesology days, when she\u2019d been one of Patti LaBelle\u2019s Blue Belles. Then, somehow, P.J. Proby became embroiled in the conversation. I\u2019d love to be able to tell you what the trouser-splitting, ponytail-wearing enfant terrible of mid-sixties pop had to say regarding my impending wedding, its potential cancellation and, indeed, whether or not I was a homosexual, but by then I was incredibly pissed.\u201d\n\nHe partied with every iconic \u201960s musician ever, at once: \u201cI was invited to a party at Mama Cass Elliot\u2019s house on Woodrow Wilson Drive in LA, famed as the leading hangout for Laurel Canyon\u2019s musicians, the place where Crosby, Stills and Nash had formed and David Crosby had shown off his new discovery, a singer-songwriter called Joni Mitchell, to his friends. When I arrived, they were all there. It was nuts, like the record sleeves in [my] bedroom at Frome Court had come to life: what the fuck is happening?\u201d\n\nKatharine Hepburn used (and cleaned) his pool: \u201cOne summer Sunday afternoon, John and I were sitting outside the bungalow having a snack, when we noticed a sixty-something lady who looked a little like Katharine Hepburn cycling up our drive. It was Katharine Hepburn: \u2018I\u2019m staying with [Stepford Wives director] Bryan Forbes \u2014 he said it would be OK if I used your pool.\u2019 John and I just nodded, dumbstruck. Five minutes later, she reappeared in a swimsuit, complaining that there was a dead frog in the pool. When I dithered about how to get it out \u2014 I\u2019m a bit squeamish about things like that \u2014 she just jumped in and grabbed it with her hand. I asked her how she could bear to touch it.\n\n\u201c\u2018Character, young man,\u2019 she nodded sternly.\u201d\n\nStevie Wonder visited his Rocky Mountain hole-up: \u201cMusicians passing through Denver or Boulder would drop by to visit \u2026 Stevie Wonder turned up one day and took out a snowmobile, insisting on driving it himself. To pre-empt your question: no, I have no idea how Stevie Wonder successfully piloted a snowmobile through the Rocky Mountains of Colorado without killing himself, or indeed anyone else, in the process, but he did.\u201d\n\nJohn Lennon convinced him to not let Andy Warhol in his room: \u201cOne evening in New York, we were holed up in my suite at the Sherry-Netherland hotel, determinedly making our way through a pile of coke, when someone knocked at the door. My first thought was that it was the police: if you\u2019ve taken a lot of cocaine and someone unexpectedly knocks at the door, your immediate thought is always that it\u2019s the police. John gestured at me to see who it was. I looked through the spyhole. My reaction was a peculiar combination of relief and incredulity.\n\n\u201c\u2018John,\u2019 I whispered. \u2018It\u2019s Andy Warhol.\u2019\n\n\u201cJohn shook his head frantically and drew his finger across his throat. \u2018No fucking way. Don\u2019t answer it,\u2019 he hissed.\n\n\u201c\u2018What?\u2019 I whispered back. \u2018What do you mean don\u2019t answer it? It\u2019s Andy Warhol.\u2019\n\n\u201cThere was more knocking. John rolled his eyes. \u2018Has he got that fucking camera with him?\u2019 he asked.\n\n\u201cI looked again through the spyhole and nodded. Andy took his Polaroid camera everywhere.\n\n\u201c\u2018Right,\u2019 said John. \u2018And do you want him coming in here taking photos when you\u2019ve got icicles of coke hanging out of your nose?\u2019\n\n\u201cI had to concede that I did not. \u2018Then don\u2019t fucking answer it,\u2019 whispered John, and we crept back to doing whatever we were doing, trying to ignore the continued knocking of the world\u2019s most famous pop artist.\u201d\n\nAnd he claims he got John back together with Yoko: \u201cHe still played with us at Madison Square Garden on Thanksgiving 1974, on the condition that we made sure Yoko didn\u2019t come: they were still estranged. Of course, Yoko turned up anyway \u2014 which I have to say is very Yoko \u2014 but Tony [King, manager of Apple Records] made sure her tickets were out of the sightline of the stage. Before the show, she sent John a gardenia, which he wore in his buttonhole onstage \u2026\n\n\u201cAfter the show, Yoko came backstage. We all ended up back at the Pierre hotel \u2014 me, John, Yoko, Tony and John Reid. We were sat in a booth and having a drink and \u2014 as if the whole situation wasn\u2019t peculiar enough \u2014 Uri Geller suddenly materialized out of nowhere, came over to our table and started bending all the spoons and forks on it. Then he began doing his mind-reading act. It had been a bizarre day. But ultimately it led to John reuniting with Yoko, having Sean \u2014 my godson \u2014 and retreating into a life of domestic contentment in the Dakota Building.\u201d\n\nHe and drag icon Divine got turned away from the club: \u201cThat was the music I heard when I went out to gay clubs in New York: Crisco Disco, Le Jardin and 12 West. I loved them, even though Crisco Disco once refused to let me in. I was with Divine, too, the legendary drag queen. I know, I know: Elton John and Divine getting turned away from a gay club. But he was wearing a kaftan, I had on a brightly coloured jacket and they said we were overdressed: \u2018Whaddaya think this is? Fuckin\u2019 Halloween?\u2019\u201d\n\nA typical L.A. day might feature Dusty Springfield or Paul Simon: \u201cIf Dusty Springfield was around, we\u2019d go to the roller derby to see the LA Thunderbirds. It was so camp and fabulous, all scripted, like wrestling, but lesbians loved it \u2014 it was basically a load of dykes whizzing round on skates and fighting each other. And we\u2019d have fantastic lunch and dinner parties. Franco Zeffirelli came for lunch and revealed that his close friends called him Irene. Simon and Garfunkel had dinner one night, then played charades. They were terrible at it.\u201d\n\nYes, Mae West once came onto him: \u201cIt was the city where, more or less, I\u2019d become a star; where I\u2019d been feted by my idols; where I\u2019d somehow ended up taking tea with Mae West (to my delight, she swanned in with a lascivious smile and the words, \u2018Ah, my favorite sight \u2014 a room full of men\u2019, which, given that the men present were me, John Reid and Tony King, suggested she was in for an evening of disappointment).\u201d\n\nDepending on the day, he could see Lou Reed or Liza Minnelli at Studio 54: \u201cRocket [Record Company] once threw a party there, and at one point, I spotted Lou Reed and Lou\u2019s transgender lover Rachel locked in conversation with, of all people, Cliff Richard. While it was nice to see people with what you might tactfully describe as having different outlooks on life getting along so famously, the mind did boggle a little at what on earth they were actually talking about \u2026 One night I was interrupted by a visibly zonked Liza Minnelli, who wanted to know if I would marry her.\u201d\n\nHe never wore his best watch for Elizabeth Taylor: \u201cShe was incredibly kind and welcoming and she was hilarious \u2014 she had a really filthy English sense of humor \u2014 although you had to watch your jewellery around her. She was obsessed. If you were wearing something she liked the look of, she\u2019d somehow just charm you into giving it to her; you would walk into her dressing room wearing a Cartier watch and leave without it, never entirely sure how she\u2019d managed to get it off you.\u201d\n\nEven on his deathbed, Freddie Mercury loved to throw shade with him: \u201cHe was too frail to get out of bed, he was losing his sight, his body was covered in Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma lesions, and yet he was still definitely Freddie, gossiping away, completely outrageous: \u2018Have you heard Mrs Bowie\u2019s new record [Tin Machine II], dear? What does she think she\u2019s doing?\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd his stag party with then-fianc\u00e9 David Furnish, thrown by \u201cour friend Patrick Cox,\u201d the fashion designer, featured everyone you\u2019d expect: \u201cPaul O\u2019Grady hosted the whole thing and sang a duet with Janet Street-Porter. Sir Ian McKellen came dressed as Widow Twankey. Bryan Adams sang and Sam Taylor-Wood did a version of \u2018Love to Love You Baby.\u2019 There were video messages from Elizabeth Taylor and Bill Clinton in between performances by the famous New York drag act Kiki and Herb and Eric McCormack, who played Will in Will and Grace, and was an old schoolfriend of David\u2019s back in Ontario. Jake Shears from the Scissor Sisters got so overexcited he ended up taking all his clothes off and demonstrating the pole-dancing skills he\u2019d learned working in New York strip clubs before the band became successful.\u201d", "description": "The new memoir by musician Elton John, \u201cMe,\u201d features stories about John Lennon, Freddie Mercury, Katharine Hepburn, Elizabeth Taylor, Stevie Wonder, and more.", "authors": ["Justin Curto"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/15/15-elton-john-royal-family.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
