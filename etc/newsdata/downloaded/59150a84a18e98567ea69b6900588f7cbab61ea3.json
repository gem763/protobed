It\u2019s weird \u2013 what is going on.\u2019\n\nShe was concerned about the colour of her vomit, which was yellow and dark green, her inquest heard.\n\nNatalie and Abbey met a year earlier while travelling in Bali (Picture: SBNA)\n\nNatalie messaged her mum in the hours before her death to say she was feeling unwell (Picture: SBNA)\n\nAfter messaging her mum to say she had a severe stomach ache, Natalie told Wendy that she and her friend might go out to get something to make them better.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut hours later, staff at the hostel where Natalie and Abbey were staying found them them dead in their beds.\n\nCoroner Geoffrey Sullivan recorded an open verdict after hearing Natalie and Abbey brought an unknown over-the-counter medication before they died in November 2017.\n\nThe hearing in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, was told Natalie and her friend were taken ill with severe sickness and diarrhoea soon after.\n\nNatalie, from Shefford, Bedfordshire, had flown out to Cambodia to meet up with Abbey in November 2017. The pair had met and become friends on a previous trip to Bali a year earlier.\n\nShe had quit her job as an accounts manager and bought a one-way ticket, not knowing yet when she would return home.\n\nIn Cambodia, Natalie posted photos online as she and Abbey travelled through the country, and messaged her family daily to let them know where she was and what she was doing.\n\nPolice investigate the room where the girls died in their hostel in Kampot, Cambodia (Picture: SBNA)\n\nNatalie was a keen adventurer and had booked a one-way ticket to Cambodia (Picture: SBNA)\n\nThe inquest was told that on the day of their deaths other backpackers brought both women food and drink as their conditions deteriorated.\n\nBecause of the remote location of the hostel there was no hospital nearby, but a local villager eventually took Natalie to a local doctor.\n\nBut by the time she arrived she was unconscious and was brought back to the hostel.\n\nShe and Abbey were dead a short time later, just six days after arriving in the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNatalie\u2019s body was brought back to the UK where Hertfordshire police examined the Cambodian investigation into Natalie\u2019s death.\n\nOfficer Paul Myhill said there was no evidence of \u2018foul play\u2019 but the court was told that a sample of Natalie\u2019s blood that had accompanied her body back to the UK couldn\u2019t be tested because there was no proper labelling on the vials.\n\nTissue and fluid sample obtained back here provided no \u2018significant toxicological\u2019 findings, the inquest heard.\n\nTributes left to Natalie back home in the UK (Picture: SBNA)\n\nDr Rajiv Swamy, who carried out the post mortem examination, said examination of her liver showed evidence of small droplets of fat being present which indicated the possibility of \u2018drug toxicity\u2019.\n\nHe said that was sometimes seen as a result of taking over-the-counter medication like paracetamol or anti-convulsants.\n\nThe condition he found, which he referred to as \u2018idiopathic hepatotoxic micro vesicular steatosis\u2019, was the cause of death, Dr Swamy said.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
