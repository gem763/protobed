The bill to do that is called the EU Withdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB), and it is expected that the text of that bill will be published late Monday. Parliament is expected to debate the WAB on Tuesday.\n\nOpponents of Johnson's deal could try to slow down the WAB's passage into law by introducing amendments intended to delay proceedings until time runs out \u2014 the U.K. is currently scheduled to leave the EU on October 31. If they are successful, the EU could grant the U.K. an extension to that end-of-October deadline.", "description": "\"The motion will not be debated today as it would be repetitive and disorderly to do so,\" the speaker of the House of Commons says", "authors": ["Haley Ott"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/21/b5be56be-35e7-4e24-b9a1-03e3390de6a0/thumbnail/1200x630/0c776e99ea8c2c7d23f6289532147b70/ap-19294441136797.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
