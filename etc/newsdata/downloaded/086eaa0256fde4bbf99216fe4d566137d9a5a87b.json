Naturally! The NAB even topped the biography with her induction into the Order of Australia this year, a ludicrous non-qualification with which to lead a director\u2019s profile.\n\nIncitec announced Fagg\u2019s place would be taken by former Newcrest Mining chief executive Greg Robinson. Having covered the last joint in shit, Robinson\u2019s the ideal director for a fertiliser producer.\n\nOver his three years running Newcrest (July 2011 to July 2014), total shareholder returns were negative 70 per cent. And in a settlement with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the gold miner agreed to pay a record $1.2 million fine for selectively briefing the market in 2013.\n\nAs for Fagg, one might\u2019ve imagined she\u2019d have her hands full as chairman of Boral, a job she took on in July last year (having been a director since 2014). The board let CEO Mike Kane pay $US2.6 billion (then $3.5 billion) for Utah building products group Headwaters in May 2017. Boral\u2019s TSR since then? Negative 15.8 per cent. Inexplicably in light of the company\u2019s lacklustre performance, in March Fagg allowed Kane to distract himself with a side hustle and join the board of Sims Metal. Management oversight doesn\u2019t get much feebler.\n\nOn goes the time-honoured principle of Australian business: FUMU.
