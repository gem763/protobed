We respect the decision made by the clerk,\" Trudeau said at the time of dissolution.\n\nThe Liberal leader has acknowledged he needs to earn back Canadians' trust after his campaign was rocked by last week's revelations that Trudeau wore blackface on at least three separate occasions.\n\nTrudeau, campaigning in Sudbury today, was asked what he could do between now and election day to prove he's trustworthy. He replied he would \"continue to focus on the things that Canadians care most about.\"\n\n\"Canadians care about fighting against intolerance and racism, and I will keep standing up against intolerance every single day,\" he said.\n\nEthics act violation\n\nLast month, Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion found Trudeau violated the Conflict of Interest Act by trying to influence Wilson-Raybould to overrule a decision denying a deferred prosecution agreement to the Quebec-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin.\n\nIn his report, Dion wrote that \"the prime minister, directly and through his senior officials, used various means to exert influence over Ms. Wilson\u2011Raybould.\"\n\n\"The authority of the prime minister and his office was used to circumvent, undermine and ultimately attempt to discredit the decision of the director of public prosecutions as well as the authority of Ms. Wilson\u2011Raybould as the Crown's chief law officer,\" Dion wrote.\n\nSNC-Lavalin is facing bribery and fraud charges related to alleged payments of close to $50 million to public officials in Libya between 2001 and 2011 to secure government contracts.\n\nIn the 2002 Babcock decision, the Supreme Court of Canada defended the principle of cabinet confidence, saying that if cabinet members' statements were subject to disclosure they might end up censoring their words, consciously or unconsciously.\n\n\"The process of democratic governance works best when cabinet members charged with government policy and decision-making are free to express themselves around the cabinet table unreservedly,\" it reads.", "description": "The SNC-Lavalin affair returned to the\u00a0campaign trail today, with the Conservatives promising to launch a judicial\u00a0inquiry into the scandal if they form government this fall.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5298305.1569515292!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/fedelxn-conservatives-20190926.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
