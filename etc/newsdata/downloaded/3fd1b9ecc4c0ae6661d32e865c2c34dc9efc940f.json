White House officials moved to cover up the incident, the anonymous whistleblower alleged, including by moving evidence of the phone call to a classified \u201ccodeword-level\u201d computer system.\n\n\u201cAccording to White House officials I spoke with, this was \u2018not the first time\u2019 under this Administration that a Presidential transcript was placed into this codeword-level system solely for the purpose of protecting politically sensitive \u2014 rather than national security sensitive \u2014 information,\u201d the whistleblower said.\n\nCastro questioned whether Trump had discussed similar matters on other calls. \u201cI believe that server they secreted away with these call summaries and transcripts on should be delivered to Congress, so that we can see what else he\u2019s been telling foreign leaders,\u201d he said.\n\nThe White House, which released a rough summary of the July 25 call this week, did not immediately return a request for comment on Castro\u2019s comments.\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham told reporters in a statement Thursday that the whistleblower\u2019s complaint was \u201cnothing more than a collection of third-hand accounts of events and cobbled-together press clippings,\u201d and that the White House would \u201ccontinue to push back on the hysteria and false narratives being peddled by Democrats and many in the mainstream media.\u201d\n\nTrump, who denies any wrongdoing, has called the Ukraine affair \u201canother witch hunt.\u201d\n\nCastro maintained that talking about impeachment wouldn\u2019t hurt Democrats, pointing to new polls that show support for impeachment inching up. A Morning Consult/Politico poll conducted between Sept. 24 and 26, for example, showed that support had risen 7 points and opposition had decreased 6 points since a poll taken the previous weekend.\n\n\u201cBy the time this is over, I\u2019m confident that more than a majority of the American people are going to support removing him from office \u2014 not only impeaching him, but removing him from office,\u201d Castro said.\n\nCastro, who is a former San Antonio mayor and the sole Hispanic contender in the 2020 presidential election campaign, spoke from the L\u2019Attitude entrepreneurship conference in San Diego, where the nonprofit Latino Donor Collaborative unveiled a report conducted by California Lutheran University arguing that the Hispanic population represented the future of the economic growth in the United States.\n\nAsked what economic obstacles he believes U.S. Latinos face, Castro pointed to a financial literacy gap and noted that many Latinos remain unbanked. Some 14% of Hispanic households in 2017 were unbanked, or lacking a checking or savings account, compared to the national rate of 6.5%, according to FDIC data.\n\n\u201cSmall business owners also face a tremendous lack of access to capital \u2014 which is a common challenge for a lot of small-business owners, but especially in communities of color, there\u2019s oftentimes an even higher barrier,\u201d Castro added.\n\nThe candidate faces hurdles to gaining traction in national opinion polls. In a fundraising email this week, he projected that failure to meet the Democratic National Committee\u2019s fifth-debate polling cutoff would doom his campaign. His polling average sits at 1.4%, according to RealClearPolitics. Castro, a first-time presidential candidate, said that \u201cstarting from scratch\u201d on email lists and name identification had posed an early challenge to his campaign.\n\n\u201cLittle by little in this race, I\u2019ve been getting stronger and stronger,\u201d he said, citing recent polls that put him at 2% and 3%. \u201cBut the email that I sent out to our supporters was an honest one \u2014 that this is crunch time.\u201d", "description": "The controversy over President Trump\u2019s request for Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son is \u201cjust the tip of the iceberg\u201d for...", "authors": ["Meera Jagannathan"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS259_castro_ZG_20190927203823.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
