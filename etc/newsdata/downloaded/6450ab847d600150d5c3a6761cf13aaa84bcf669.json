But we think\u2026 we\u2019ve done everything we can.\u201d\n\nWearing orange hi-vis vests with \u201cGet Ready for Brexit\u201d on the back, port workers braved wind and rain to distribute booklets with information on customs procedures that will change once Britain leaves the 28-nation bloc.\n\nThe port is now handing out 25,000 of the leaflets \u2014 which carry a picture of a furry blue monster that the Dutch government has adopted as its symbol of Brexit chaos, lying down on a road barrier to block a lorry.\n\nIt is also putting up banners in key locations, and leaving Brexit information folders at 12 trucker cafes and parking areas in the port area.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Is England ready for Brexit!\u2019 \u2013\n\nSome of the truckers seemed familiar with the Brexit information, while others, including many from Eastern Europe, appeared bemused by the leaflets.\n\n\u201cIs England ready for Brexit!\u201d Dutch lorry driver Peet van der Akker shouted as he passed through the port, adding that \u201cI don\u2019t hope\u201d Johnson would get his deal through parliament, and that Britain would stay in the EU.\n\nDijk said 82 percent of trucks that pass through Rotterdam had registered on the \u201cPortbase\u201d system, which links the Dutch customs service with ports and aims to ensure smooth passage despite Brexit, \u201cbut that still means 18 percent is not registered.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if you realise that around 3,000 or 4000 trucks a day are coming in and going out, then there are still 300 or 400 trucks daily that are not prepared.\u201d\n\nRotterdam has been planning almost since the day Britain voted to leave the EU in June 2016, given that trade between Britain and Rotterdam amounts to 40 million tonnes a year.\n\nBrexit is expected to make that figure dip by up to 30 percent, depending on the kind of arrangement Britain makes with the EU afterwards, hitting the port\u2019s overall business by between two and four percent, Dijk said.\n\nThe leafleting campaign is crucial to ensuring that things keep moving and the effect on trade is not even worse, officials say.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important that all the preparations are done before they come here,\u201d said Marty van Pelt, communications manager for Portbase, who is responsible for its \u201cGet Ready for Brexit\u201d programme.\n\nAs for whether Johnson can win what is set to be a knife-edge parliamentary vote on Saturday on his Brexit deal with the EU, van Pelt was hopeful.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s hope there will be some kind of deal, I think it\u2019s better for all of us, for logistics in general, for the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019ll have to wait and see what parliament will decide.\u201d", "description": "The Hague (AFP) \u2013 While Boris Johnson scrambled Friday to sell his EU divorce deal to parliament, the Dutch port of Rotterdam handed out", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/18/3619e6_staff-europe-busiest-seaport-stepped-up-campaign-ensure-lorry-drivers-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
