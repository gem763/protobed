The apps were varied, with a horoscope app, a security app, and a selfie camera filter among those removed.\n\nThe filter app - called Sweet Camera - was reportedly amongst the developer's most popular, with 50 million downloads.\n\nNeither Google nor iHandy were immediately available for comment when contacted by Business Insider. A Google spokesperson refused to explain why the apps had been removed when asked by BuzzFeed, but confirmed Google has launched an investigation into them.\n\nWhen BuzzFeed reported the story eight of iHandy's apps were left on the Play Store, but more seem to be disappearing - as of writing, only five remain.\n\niHandy executive Simon Zhu told BuzzFeed that the removal was a surprise to the company. \"It is an unexpected action from our point of view. We are trying to find out the reasons. Hope the apps will be back to Play Store as soon as possible,\" he said.\n\n\"As we all know that in recent years, Google keeps improving policies and process to build a healthier ecosystem for users and developers. We are definitely willing to follow these improvements as a developer in good standing.\"\n\nOn its website, iHandy says that it partners with Apple, Google, and Facebook.\n\nBusiness Insider found at least 12 apps by iHandy live on Apple's App Store. It's not immediately clear if Apple has taken action against any of the developer's apps, and the American tech giant did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "The apps from Chinese developer iHandy kicked from the Play Store included a horoscope app, a security app, and a selfie filter app.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9412/54b1dd7d2c604fdca47f5459fceca43d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
