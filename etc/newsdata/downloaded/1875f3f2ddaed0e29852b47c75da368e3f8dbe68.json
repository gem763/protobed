Ricky-- a pseudonym-- had known he was gay since his early teens but had almost never dated. His relationships were mostly restricted to a tiny circle of friends who had discovered their sexuality together as they grew up. He was careful, he would normally only meet people 3 or 4 times a-year.\n\nThen one day the police arrived at his work.\n\n\"The first day they took me and locked me in the cell in our city police station,\" Ricky said. \"Then they took me to another place.\" After that, the torture began.\n\n\"At first, they were just beating me. They punched me and then they hit me with electric shock. They did waterboarding, which was the worst,\" Ricky told ABC News in a recent interview.\n\nThe police had discovered Ricky because of one his friends. They confronted him with a video passed to them by the friend that showed them together, discussing LGBT issues.\n\n\"I gave up then. I really thought they were going to kill me,\" Ricky said. \"They said it would be better if I was a terrorist than gay.\"\n\nRicky's ordeal was in mid-2018 and it was a familiar story.\n\nIn early 2017, the world had became aware of reports that Chechen authorities were rounding up and torturing dozens of men they suspected of being gay, in what came to be known as a \"gay purge\". Over 100 men were reported by rights groups to have been swept up by the security services and taken to police stations and secret prisons. From there, many accounts emerged describing beatings with plastic rods, electrocution, waterboarding. Rights groups have since reported several suspected deaths.\n\n(MORE: That time I told the head of Chechen police I was gay. Standing in a jail cell: Reporter's notebook)\n\nThe international outcry to the alleged abuse of the LGBT community in Chechnya was huge -- protests were held in cities around the world and Western governments condemned the reports. The Trump administration imposed sanctions on top Chechen officials for their role in the persecution.\n\nThree years later, however, little has changed and no one has been held accountable. Instead, reporting by ABC News and others shows that-- while not on the same scale-- the detention and torture of LGBT people in Chechnya never really stopped. Nor did it begin in 2017.\n\nIn January 2018 Russian LGBT activists reported a fresh wave of detentions, this time also involving gay women. Although far smaller than in 2017, it underlined a grim reality, that the so-called \"purges\" are in fact more like spikes in what is a routine practice in Chechnya-- the detention and torture of men suspected by police of being gay.\n\nPHOTO: ABC News' James Longman toured a prison with Apti Alaudinov, the head of police in Chechnya, a Russian republic that has allegedly purged LGBTQ people over the last two years. (James Longman ) More\n\nFor almost a year, ABC News has recorded the stories of LGBT men and women persecuted in Chechnya and the surrounding region, or living in terror of exposure there. The names of most of those interviewed have been changed at their request out of concern the Chechen authorities or their families might harm them.\n\nTheir accounts paint a picture of a place where there is now virtually no space to be gay, where dating carries potentially lethal consequences and the suppression of their identity is obligatory for LGBT people.\n\n\"Any day in Chechnya you can be taken,\" Ricky said. \"There is no life.\"\n\n'It's a dictatorship'\n\nChechnya is a republic traumatized by violence. Located on Russia\u2019s southwestern edge in the mountains of the North Caucasus, the area was devastated in two wars between the mid-1990s and later 2000s with Russia. Russian federal troops, crushing a separatist rebellion and then an Islamic insurgency, devastated the republic. Grozny was levelled and hundreds of thousands were killed.\n\nSince 2007, Chechnya has lived under the rule of Ramzan Kadyrov, a former rebel appointed by Russian President Vladimir Putin to subdue Chechnya. He has done that, using allegedly savage methods, and in the process Kadyrov has remodelled Chechnya around himself, erecting a police state and a cult of personality built around an obsessive machismo centered on sport, particularly martial arts.", "description": "Ricky said he had known the man who betrayed him for 10 years.  \"The first day they took me and locked me in the cell in our city police station,\" Ricky said.
