As the pilots powered up the plane at Miami International Airport, they saw an error message for a system that tracks speed, nose direction and other critical flight information and aborted the takeoff.\n\nWhen mechanics examined the plane, they found a piece of foam glued inside a navigation system part called an air data module. Video from an American Airlines surveillance camera captured a person who drove up to the plane, got out and spent seven minutes working around the compartment containing the navigation system, according to the affidavit.\n\nspyderskidoo via Getty Images The American Airlines plane, not pictured, was attempting to depart the Miami International Airport in July when pilots noticed an error message.\n\nThe person was later identified by co-workers as Alani, in part by his distinctive limp, the affidavit said.\n\nWhen he was interviewed Thursday, \u201cAlani stated that his intention was not to cause harm to the aircraft or its passengers,\u201d according to the affidavit by Jose A. Ruiz, a federal air marshal who serves on an FBI terrorism task force.\n\nAlani explained that stalled contract negotiations between American Airlines and the mechanics\u2019 unions were hurting him financially, and he tampered with the plane \u201cto cause a delay or have the flight cancelled in anticipation of obtaining overtime work,\u201d Ruiz wrote.\n\nAmerican has accused mechanics of an illegal work slowdown that has led to hundreds of canceled flights in recent months. The airline successfully sued two unions that represent the workers. This week, both sides announced that they will resume negotiations Sept. 16 in Washington, with help from a federal mediator. The mechanics\u2019 unions have been trying to secure a new contract for more than three years.\n\nIn a statement, American Airlines said it cooperated fully with the investigation \u201cand we are taking this matter very seriously.\u201d The Fort Worth, Texas-based airline said the plane was taken out of service after the July incident and repaired and inspected before it was allowed to fly again.\n\nAlani was charged with willfully damaging or disabling an aircraft. He is expected to appear in federal court in Miami on Friday.\n\n___\n\nKoenig reported from Dallas.", "description": "The plane, with 150 people on board, aborted takeoff in Miami after the pilots saw a system error message.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d724b34240000621c77af2c.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
