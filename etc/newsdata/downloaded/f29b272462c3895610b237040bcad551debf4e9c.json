Opponents \u2013 including priests and the religious \u2013 screamed \u201ckillers!\u201d at the lawmakers as the vote occurred, while women in the green handkerchiefs of the pro-choice movement chanted, \u201cYes we can!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have made history for the dignity, rights and life of the women of Oaxaca,\u201d said Magaly L\u00f3pez a local representative of Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s Morena party.\n\nMagaly L\u00f3pez told reporters that illegal abortions are the third-largest cause of maternal deaths in the state. \u201cThe women who die are poor, and cannot pay for [abortions]\u2026 They are judged and sentenced to death by a system which believes it is dangerous for them to make decisions about their body,\u201d she said.\n\nThe vote made Oaxaca just the second jurisdiction in Mexico to decriminalise abortion, following Mexico City, which scrapped its prohibitions on abortion in 2007 \u2013 a measure upheld by the supreme court a year later.\n\nBut the early advances provoked a backlash: 20 of Mexico\u2019s 31 states subsequently approved constitutional prohibitions on abortion. In the eastern state of Veracruz, the controversial then-governor Javier Duarte pushed through a total ban on abortion \u2013 even as crime soared and accusations of massive corruption mounted.\n\nMexico baby death trial reveals growing persecution of women who miscarry Read more\n\nHuman rights group Fundar Mexico hailed a \u201chistoric day for women\u201d and called for \u201clegal, safe and free abortions\u201d.\n\nAndr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, the president who won power last year in an electoral alliance with a party founded by Evangelicals, has shown little support for reopening the abortion issue.\n\n\u201cThere are many important issues and at this time I think the most important is cleaning corruption from government,\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador said in response to a reporter\u2019s question in March.\n\nBut some momentum seems to be building for decriminalising abortion. The supreme court recently upheld a health secretariat ruling which allows women to have an abortion in the case of rape. The court also ruled women in such situations must be attended to by public hospitals, do not need to file a criminal complaint with the police, and minors do not need to obtain their parents\u2019 permission.\n\nL\u00f3pez Obrador, commonly called \u201cAmlo,\u201d also sent an amnesty bill to Congress on the eve of the country\u2019s 16 September independence celebrations. The bill would offer an amnesty to poor people languishing in prison for minor crimes and low-level individuals in the illegal drugs business \u2013 but also women who have abortions.\n\nThe president did not mention abortion during his regular morning press conference on Thursday. But the federal government sent out a tweet congratulating the Oaxaca lawmakers.\n\n\u201cOur democracy is strengthened with the extension of rights and the recognition of the autonomy of women to make decisions over their own bodies,\u201d the tweet read.", "description": "Lawmakers voted to scrap restrictions on abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy in a win for reproductive rights advocates", "authors": ["David Agren"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4aebf6a8e2f8a63e03ed45549d51e93fd0722cea/0_154_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b11c1989700a128a62fa4f8c76b7cebd", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
