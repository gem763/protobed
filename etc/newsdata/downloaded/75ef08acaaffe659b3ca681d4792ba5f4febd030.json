A lot of shadow cabinet ministers who would be raising concerns are going to be speaking at Remain rallies in Brighton during that time.\u201d\n\nThe NEC statement says a Labour government will take up to three months to negotiate a deal based on customs union membership, a close single market relationship, protection of the Good Friday Agreement, rights for EU citizens in the UK and safeguards for workplace rights and environmental and consumer protections.\n\nThe deal would be put to a public vote wihtint six months of Mr Corbyn taking office, and a one-day special conference would be held after the election of a Labour government to decide whether the party should back Remain or Leave in the campaign.\n\nIt is expected that the NEC statement will go forward for a vote on Tuesday alongside a separate motion explicitly backing Remain.\n\nMore than 80 constituency Labour parties have put forward motions backing a pro-Remain campaign in any referendum, but the exact wording to be put to the vote will be decided in a \u201ccompositing\u201d meeting on Sunday evening.\n\nBut the pro-Remain source said: \u201cThe NEC statement will get through.

Offering everyone in the country the final say is the best way to begin bridging this divide.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of our members, our MPs and our voters want to remain in Europe. If we win our fight for a people\u2019s vote I believe our members, our MPs and our party will lead the campaign to Remain. That\u2019s not just because it is the best way of reconnecting with our voters, but also because it is the best way of standing up for our values.\n\n\u201cWe are a Remain party. We are a European party. We are an internationalist party. That is who we are. Not perfect, not pure. But overwhelmingly committed to Britain remaining in Europe and reforming Europe.\n\n\u201cBy backing a people\u2019s vote, by backing Remain, I am sure we can deliver the Labour government the people of this country so badly need.\u201d", "description": "Labour\u2019s leadership has been accused of a \u201ctotal stitch-up\u201d over Brexit, after members of its ruling National Executive Committee were given 90 minutes to raise objections by email to a statement backing Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s position.", "authors": ["Andrew Woodcock"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/22/12/labour-conference-protest-3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
