The United States can't abandon our fierce allies to Turkey.", "language": "en", "text": "The Kurds have been a reliable partner for the United States. Betraying them now risks undermining all our progress against the Islamic State.\n\nU.S. military service members\u2019 worldviews are shaped by the jobs they do, places they\u2019ve been and comrades in arms they\u2019ve fought alongside. As a major in the Air Force who has flown combat missions against the Islamic State, I have seen firsthand the capability of Kurdish fighters. During my missions in 2016, they made up a critical mass of the ground forces flushing ISIS from its strongholds across Iraq and Syria. Together with a small number of U.S. special operators and others making up the moderate Syrian Democratic Forces, the Kurds were instrumental in ending the Islamic State\u2019s territorial caliphate.\n\nNow is no time to abandon them to the designs of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has just launched a military offensive into Kurdish-controlled parts of Syria.\n\nI was sitting on an operations floor the night of a failed Turkish coup attempt against Erdogan in 2016, about the same time I was flying combat missions in support of Kurdish fighters on the ground. I remember the turbulence of those days, when it was unclear when \u2014 or whether \u2014 ISIS would be pushed from the vast territory it had seized.\n\nIt was with this in mind that I heard the news Monday that the United States has withdrawn troops from the northern portion of Syria and that the president did not object to an attack that Turkey launched Wednesday against Kurdish forces in the area \u2014 the same forces that were so critical in liberating large swathes of Iraq and Syria from ISIS control.\n\nA valuable partner put in jeopardy\n\nThe administration's overnight announcement drew an immediate and almost universal rebuke from the foreign policy and military community, even including condemnation from some of the president\u2019s closest usual allies. In the fight against ISIS, it has been U.S. policy to back the Kurds in Syria, and their extremely capable fighters. This week\u2019s decision to turn this policy on its head now puts an extremely valuable partner in jeopardy, risks creating space for the reemergence of the Islamic State, and leaves the status of thousands of captured ISIS fighters uncertain.\n\nTrump's failure is not in leaving Syria: Get out of Syria, but give the Kurds fair warning\n\nAmerica has a long-standing relationship with the Kurdish people, despite a history of overpromising, underdelivering, and often supporting the Kurds when it was helpful and convenient and ignoring them when it was not. After the breakup of the Ottoman Empire, President Woodrow Wilson supported the idea of an independent Kurdish state, but this dream fell apart when Turkish borders were redrawn in 1923. Denied a homeland of their own, the Kurdish diaspora came to be spread across Turkey, Iraq, Syria and Iran, facing pressure and often outright hostility in countries that viewed them with suspicion.\n\nIn the Syrian village of al-Hashisha in September 2019.

In the aftermath of the Persian Gulf War, the United States imposed \"no-fly\" zones that prevented further aggression against the Kurds by Hussein, and President Bill Clinton's administration later helped bring an end to the Iraqi Kurdish civil war. The Kurds in Iraq supported the U.S. invasion of 2003, and were quite possibly the most effective allied fighting force on the ground in the battle against ISIS.\n\nA moral and strategic failure\n\nThey did all this with the hope \u2014 despite past disappointments \u2014 that America would repay the Kurds by continuing to support Kurdish ambitions in the region. Tragically, they\u2019ve been let down once again, causing many to fear for a humanitarian disaster. With an effective green light from the United States, Erdogan feels empowered to take military actions to sweep the Kurds from territory near the Turkey-Syria border. The repercussions for America and its allies could be huge.\n\nEditorial Board: Syria policy wasn't broke. Why is Donald Trump wrecking it?\n\nThe moral failure of the decision would be bad enough were it not for the strategic implications as well: An invasion by Turkey could roll back allied successes and provide ISIS with space to operate. Kurdish-run camps for detained ISIS fighters \u2014 like the one at Al Hol \u2014 will be in fresh jeopardy, as the Kurds are forced to divert manpower and resources to engaging with the Turks. As a result, not only will ISIS recruiters have an easier time infiltrating their message but also an easier time exfiltrating their new recruits.\n\nTurkish army vehicles drive toward the Syrian border on Oct. 9, 2019.

The Kurds have proved time and again their capability as a disciplined, effective fighting force and their commitment to the kind of stable, moderate governance that is sorely lacking in the region.\n\nPrevious U.S. presidents have recognized this and committed themselves to standing side by side with the Kurds. The administration\u2019s plan of abandoning them now would not just be a reversal of long-established policy, it also would be a betrayal of one of America's few reliable regional partners.\n\nJason Baker is a major in the Air Force who flew combat missions and provided direct planning support in the fight against the Islamic State in 2016.
