Investors are often drawn to strong companies with the idea of reinvesting the dividends. If you are hoping to live on the income from dividends, it's important to be a lot more stringent with your investments than the average punter.\n\nIn this case, DS Smith likely looks attractive to investors, given its 4.7% dividend yield and a payment history of over ten years. We'd guess that plenty of investors have purchased it for the income. There are a few simple ways to reduce the risks of buying DS Smith for its dividend, and we'll go through these below.\n\nClick the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis\n\nLSE:SMDS Historical Dividend Yield, October 22nd 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. So we need to form a view on if a company's dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. Looking at the data, we can see that 82% of DS Smith's profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. It's paying out most of its earnings, which limits the amount that can be reinvested in the business. This may indicate limited need for further capital within the business, or highlight a commitment to paying a dividend.\n\nWe also measure dividends paid against a company's levered free cash flow, to see if enough cash was generated to cover the dividend. The company paid out 82% of its free cash flow as dividends last year, which is adequate, but reduces the wriggle room in the event of a downturn. It's positive to see that DS Smith's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.\n\nIs DS Smith's Balance Sheet Risky?\n\nAs DS Smith has a meaningful amount of debt, we need to check its balance sheet to see if the company might have debt risks. A rough way to check this is with these two simple ratios: a) net debt divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and b) net interest cover. Net debt to EBITDA is a measure of a company's total debt. Net interest cover measures the ability to meet interest payments. Essentially we check that a) the company does not have too much debt, and b) that it can afford to pay the interest. DS Smith has net debt of 2.92 times its EBITDA. Using debt can accelerate business growth, but also increases the risks.\n\nWe calculated its interest cover by measuring its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), and dividing this by the company's net interest expense. DS Smith has EBIT of 8.31 times its interest expense, which we think is adequate.\n\nWe update our data on DS Smith every 24 hours, so you can always get our latest analysis of its financial health, here.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nOne of the major risks of relying on dividend income, is the potential for a company to struggle financially and cut its dividend. Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well - nasty. For the purpose of this article, we only scrutinise the last decade of DS Smith's dividend payments. This dividend has been unstable, which we define as having fallen by at least 20% one or more times over this time. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was UK\u00a30.088 in 2009, compared to UK\u00a30.16 last year. Dividends per share have grown at approximately 6.3% per year over this time. The growth in dividends has not been linear, but the CAGR is a decent approximation of the rate of change over this time frame.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Could DS Smith Plc (LON:SMDS) be an attractive dividend share to own for the long haul?
