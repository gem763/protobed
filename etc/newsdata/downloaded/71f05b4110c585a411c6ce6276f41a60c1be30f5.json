But there was also an equal amount of criticism, with some saying it looked more suited to doing the school run than crossing the Serengeti.\n\nOne of the biggest complaints was the purchase price for the reborn version of what was once an iconic utilitarian workhorse that cost just \u00a3450 when it launched in 1948.\n\nThe cheapest all-new Defender - the three-door 90 - expected to set customers back \u00a340,000, while the most luxurious Defender 110X rings in at a staggering \u00a378,000.\n\nFortunately, there's a much more affordable version coming to the market that's expected to cost \u00a3159.99. The only problem is it's made from Lego.\n\nBuilt in Slovakia; built in your kitchen: Lego and Land Rover have teamed up to launch a new brickwork Defender that you can make at home rather than wait for one to arrive from the British brand's new \u00a31billion factory in Nitra\n\nLand Rover has teamed up with the legendary toy maker to release a 1/16-scale Technic version of the new Defender.\n\nIt's no small build, either; in total there are 2,573 pieces that make up the brick off-roader, which features plenty of moving parts.\n\nLego describes it as 'an automotive icon you can build at home', with the kit giving Land Rover fans the chance to piece together a new short-wheelbase Defender 90 that's loaded with extra equipment you can get for the real thing.\n\nIt's due to go on sale on 1 October, priced from \u00a3159.99 and is almost like-for-like with the new SUV, but in a miniature form.\n\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a The model is a 1/16-scale version of the real thing. It's a pretty accurate depiction of a vehicle that's been splitting opinion this week\n\nIn total there are 2,573 pieces that make up the brick off-roader, which features plenty of moving parts\n\nLego has sold detailed Technic versions of much-loved cars in the past, including the Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 GT3 RS\n\nNot only does it look just like the new car, it also has a functioning four-wheel-drive system, fully independent suspension and a straight-six engine that you can see chugging away under the bonnet.\n\nIt also has the electric winch (though not actually electric for the Lego model), the standing roof rack and side-mounted ladder, all of which are available as part of a range of accessory kits that are available for the real thing.\n\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a The most luxurious Defender 110X ringing in at a staggering \u00a378,000. The Lego Defender will cost from - a reported - \u00a3159.99\n\nNot only does it look just like the new car, it also has a functioning four-wheel-drive system, fully independent suspension\n\nIt's a detailed bit of kit. The interior is loads of moving parts, as does the boot with the spare wheel fixed to the tailgate\n\nNiels Henrik Horsted, marketing director at Lego said: 'Together with Land Rover, we\u2019ve blended elements, design and innovative engineering into a set that shows the boundless creativity of Lego play, and that with Lego Technic you can build for real.'\n\nThe Lego Defender could be a big hit for the Danish toy firm, with previous brick versions of cars like the Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 GT3 RS proving immensely popular in the past.\n\nThere was even a full-scale Lego version of Bugatti's \u00a32million hypercar.\n\nThe real Defender has somewhat divided opinion this week, but the Lego one is expected to garner plenty of fans\n\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a The Lego model has many features the real Defender boasts, such as a winch , roof rack and side-mounted ladder, all of which are available as part of the variety of accessory kits for the actual thing\n\nThe Lego Technic Land Rover Defender is expected to cost a reported \u00a3159.99. That's quite a lot of money for a toy\n\nThat said, some fans of the original might not want a Lego version, based on the reaction to the real thing.\n\nThe remake of one of Britain's most iconic cars has divided opinion among the public, with some describing it as 'glorious' while others think it's an overpriced 'insult' to its boxy, functional forerunner.\n\nThe Defender, a 71-year-old institution beloved by Her Royal Highness the Queen, featured in James Bond films, deployed by the army and considered the quintessential farmer's car has been 'reimagined for the 21st century'.\n\nBut critics say its sleek design and plush interior - all for the princely sum of \u00a345,000 - are more suited to Waitrose runs than crashing about on country lanes.\n\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a Both the real Land Rover Defender and the Lego one have been unveiled at this week's Frankfurt Motor Show\n\nNiels Henrik Horsted from Lego said the model blends 'elements, design and innovative engineering into a set that shows the boundless creativity of Lego play'. It hasn't been confirmed if the model will be a limited production like previous Lego cars\n\nOne fan decried the dashboard gadgetry, saying: 'Now I have a 60k iPod that I can't put the dogs in. Why do we need another disco? (Land Rover Discovery).'\n\nBut others claimed to like the new style, one said it looked 'fabulous' while another said it was 'macho'.\n\nMade in Slovakia, the new Defender was launched at the Frankfurt Motor Show on Tuesday and Land Rover claimed its silhouette made it 'instantly recognisable'.\n\nBut one fan hit back: 'They've taken a staple country 4x4 and made it into some yummy mummy school run wagon. There's already enough Chelsea tractors, Porsche cayenne, Range Rover Vogue etc etc.'\n\nOthers described its price as 'insane' and many shared photos of their original Defenders, saying they had no intention of trading them in.\n\nOne proud owner posted a picture of his Defender covered in mud and surrounded by cattle in a field, saying: 'That new thing you have produced will be no good for what I do.'\n\nScroll down for This is Money's first look.\n\nLand Rover's new Defender - there are two 'passenger' versions at launch \u2013 the three-door Defender 90, priced from around \u00a340,000, and the five-door 110 costing from \u00a345,240\n\nThe Defender, a 71-year-old institution beloved by Her Royal Highness the Queen, featured in James Bond films and is considered the quintessential farmers' car has been 'reimagined for the 21st century'\n\nReaction on social media this afternoon ridiculed the new Land Rover Defender, with some comparing it to cheaper cars from the Far East or to an oversized MINI Countryman, MINI's 4x4 variant\n\nPedigree: The final version of the previous-gen Land Rover Defender coming off the production line at Solihull in 2016\n\nThe promotional footage for the new car shows it tackling brutal terrain, ploughing through flooded roads and climbing over sandy dunes.\n\nBut a Twitter user commented: 'Where's the school-run and shopping-centre-trips footage that they're all inevitably going to be used for?'\n\nMany said it looked much like Land Rover's other recent models, such as the Discovery or the Freelander.\n\nOthers went further still, comparing the new Defender to the Mini Countryman, while others said it did little to distinguish itself from the hugely popular, far cheaper, Nissan and Kia SUVs.\n\nAnother upset fan wrote: 'A defender for footballers wives. You have completely missed the boat on what existing owners want, but you'll probably make a packet. I'll be keeping my current 110 till diesel engines are phased out in the UK. It'll last till 2040.'\n\nOne user commented below their video showing dramatic scenes of off-roading capabilities, 'Where's the school-run and shopping centre-trips footage?'\n\nThe Queen has frequently been pictured at the wheel of her Land Rover Defender, mostly in use on the Sandringham Estate\n\nState of the art 'cyber security' built into the new Defender's system is promised to deter thieves, according to Land Rover\n\nSeparated by decades: Having the new Defender pose next to an original Land Rover shows how far vehicle design has come\n\nJaguar Land Rover ended production at its Solihull factory in the West Midlands in January 2016 amid difficulties in meeting modern safety and emissions standards.\n\nLand Rover said their new model is 'the ultimate 4x4 for overland adventures', with a towing capacity of 3,500kg and a wading depth of up to 90cm.\n\nLand Rover chief design officer Gerry McGovern said: 'The new Defender is respectful of its past but is not harnessed by it.\n\n'This is a new Defender for a new age. Its unique personality is accentuated by its distinctive silhouette and optimum proportions, which make it both highly desirable and seriously capable - a visually compelling 4x4 that wears its design and engineering integrity with uncompromised commitment.'\n\nAmid the battle over the car's appearance, others objected to the vehicle for a more fundamental reason. It's carbon emissions.\n\nOne wrote: 'Is It electric powered or is it one of those old polluting combustion engines?'\n\nAnd another said: 'How many Landcover [sic] customers honestly go off road?...farmers...who mostly have decent old ones...these new ones are town, city cars...they don't go off road.'\n\nLand Rover tweeted back: 'True benefits of a 4x4 will only be seen in off-road environments. We'd recommend you visit your nearest approved retailer to arrange a Land Rover Experience day.'\n\nOne proud owner posted this photograph of his classic Defender covered in mud and surrounded by cattle, saying: 'That new thing you have produced will be no good for what I do'\n\nAnother proud owner posted this picture of his rugged classic Defender, saying the new variant was designed for mothers off to get a coffee\n\nThe Defender name can be traced back to the early 1990s but it represents the continuation of the very first Land Rover, which came on to the scene in April 1948 and was modelled on wartime Jeeps.\n\nThe Queen took delivery of her first one shortly after coming to the throne in 1952 and has used Land Rovers ever since.\n\nReady for anything, including collecting a takeaway: Land Rover's new \u00a340,000 Defender 4x4 offers everything from an electric winch to six curry hooks\n\nBy Ray Massey for MailOnline and This Is Money\n\nLand Rover has officially launched its 21st century successor to the iconic 71-year-old Defender 4X4 \u2013 the quintessential British off-roader loved by millions, including Her Royal Highness the Queen.\n\nThe new Defender is built to be tough enough to tackle any adventure at home or abroad - from Sandringham, to the school run, to the Serengeti.\n\nUnveiled on Tuesday morning at the Frankfurt Motor Show following a stream of high-profile leaks, the hi-tech and hardcore off-roader is the modern day successor to the original rufty-tufty 1948 Land Rover, but 'reimagined for the 21st century'.\n\nThat means it will be ideal for the impenetrable jungles in Africa and Asia, but also just as capable when it comes to navigating the trendy urban jungle of London's Shoreditch, or collecting a family takeaway in the Shires - with the help of six curry hooks.\n\nIt's back! Land Rover has unveiled the all-new Defender (right) - the return of the iconic model that's ready for 21st-century living, the British brand says\n\nThe eagerly-anticipated new Land Rover Defender was launched at the Frankfurt Motor Show on Tuesday morning and is the car maker's most significant new model for years\n\nLand Rover describes the new Defender - which has been proved to be one of the car industry's recent worst kept secrets following a string of image leaks - as 'expedition ready' and 'fun without the flaws' of the ageing original.\n\nBut although the new incarnation of the British icon has been designed and engineered in the UK, the new Defender will be built abroad - at Jaguar Land Rover's massive new factory at Nitra, in Slovakia, giving the firm a foothold within the EU if, as planned, the UK leaves following the growing Brexit row.\n\nThe boxy and upright new off-roader promises the traditional go-anywhere ability to traverse deserts, mountains, rocky terrain, and Arctic ice.\n\nIt can paddle through rivers and streams to a depth of up to 900mm, aided by the car maker's first electronic wade programme that's been tested to the extreme.\n\nIn fact, the new Defender has been subject to 62,000 different tests over 744,000 miles in some of the world's harshest climates from 50-degree desert heat to minus 40 degree Baltic conditions to ensure it is ready to take the iconic mantle.\n\nThe new Defender has been subject to 62,000 different tests over 744,000 miles in some of the world's harshest climates from 50-degree desert heat to minus 40 degree Baltic conditions to ensure it is ready for every eventuality\n\nGloss white steel rimmed wheels echo those on early Land Rovers for the most basic version available\n\nThe boxy and upright new off-roader promises the traditional go-anywhere ability to traverse deserts, mountains, rocky terrain, and arctic ice\n\nGround clearance of up to 291mm means it can tackle steep angles easier \u2013 downhill and uphill.\n\nBut it also includes hi-tech features including the 'X-ray vision' mode first seen in the new Range Rover Evoque.\n\nThis uses exterior cameras to allow drivers to see on the central touchscreen what's under the vehicle, plus a digital rear mirror - also using cameras - to give motorists a clear view behind unimpeded by passengers.\n\nA new generation infotainment system can connect two smartphones at the same time and the wi-fi connected car is 5G future-proofed by allowing software updates to be downloaded over the air. It can even handle satellite phones, just in case you are taking your Defender into remote areas.\n\nThe vehicle's pioneering 'terrain response' system means that experienced off-road drivers can choose the setting they want want for the ground being covered \u2013 such as ruts, mud, sand, rock or snow\n\nThe Defender can paddle through rivers and streams to a depth of up to 900mm, aided by the car maker's first electronic wade programme that's been tested to the extreme\n\nLand Rover Defender: Will it fit in my garage?

And a portable rinse-system to washout mud is also available.\n\nA central 'jump' seat \u2013 like the one available in the original - gives the option of having three seats up front.\n\nIt means the smaller Defender 90 can have up to six seats, while the larger four-door 110 can be specified as a five, six or seven-seater.\n\nAlso reflecting the design of the original are the tread-plates on the bonnet and the side-hinged rear tailgate and the option to have the spare wheel on the back.\n\nWhat is new is the 'alpine lights' options, which are small windows near the roof that allow in the light but also let passengers to look up at mountains...or the city high-rises.\n\nAn optional folding fabric roof - also echoing the original Defender - gives an open-top feel and allows passengers in the second row of the 110 to stand up when parked to provide the full safari experience.\n\nGloss white steel rimmed wheels echo those on early Land Rovers for the most basic version available and there will even be side-saddle storage panniers built into the side windows on some models.\n\nBut the Defender is not all about extreme outings.\n\nFor modern families needing somewhere to hang their takeaways safely when driving home, there is not one but SIX curry hooks and storage space for a couple of two-litre bottles of water - or wheatgrass juice if you're a hipster.\n\nGround clearance of up to 291mm means the new Defender can tackle steep angles easily, whether they're downhill or uphill\n\nLand Rover said the new Defender 'raises the threshold for both off-road ruggedness and on road comfort' offering 'first class long-haul comfort' across any terrain\n\nAlthough a brand new vehicle, the new Defender has many styling and practical cues which hark right back to the original of 71 years ago, updated for modern lifestyles, Land Rover says\n\nThere are lots of accessory packages geared for every eventuality, too - readying you for the rainforests of Kuala Lumpar or the red carpets of Knightsbridge.\n\nThe main packs are: Explorer, Adventure, Country and Urban - you can work out who each one is aimed at.\n\nThe most hardened customers looking to make the most of the Defender ownership can customise their SUV with an electric winch, a roof-top tent (taking up to 300kg of weight, which is around four medium-sized adults), a roof rack platform plus the specially designed extendable ladder on the side to get you up there, tow-bar, inflatable waterproof awning, and bespoke air-intake snorkel.\n\nThose who want to get their 4X4s muddy and dirty \u2013 without spoiling or scratching the original paintwork \u2013 can have a factory-fitted special protective satin film wrap over the bodywork in seven shades, such as Pangea Green, Indus Silver and Gondwana Stone, which can be removed later if desired.\n\nA panoramic glass roof is another optional feature.\n\nThe most hardened customers looking to make the most of the Defender ownership can customise their SUV with electric winch\n\nThose who want to get their 4X4s muddy and dirty \u2013 without spoiling or scratching the original paintwork \u2013 can have a factory-fitted special protective satin film wrap over the bodywork in seven shades\n\nThere are lots of accessory packages geared for every eventuality, too - readying you for the rainforests of Kuala Lumpar or the red carpets of Knightsbridge\n\nExplorers can customise their SUV to have a roof-top tent, which can take a weight of up to 300kg, which is around four medium-sized adults\n\nBut Land Rover thinks the smaller three-door Defender 90 will be particularly popular with young urban fashion-conscious customers \u2013 and has created personalisation kits and big 22-inch wheels to add edgy bling to the mix.\n\nBoth the Defender 90 and 110 have four engine variants at launch: a 2.0 litre direct injection 4-cylinder inline diesel with either 200HP or 240HP; a 2.0 litre 4-cylinder inline petrol (300HP); or a new straight six-cylinder 3.0 litre petrol (400HP) with mild electric hybrid. All are linked to an eight-speed automatic gear-box with permanent all-wheel drive. The diesels promise fuel economy of up to 37.2mpg with CO2 emissions of 199g/km.\n\nA plug-in hybrid (PHEV) version is to follow next year, allowing the vehicle to run for periods in electric-only mode.\n\nBoth the Defender 90 and 110 have four engine variants at launch: two diesels and two petrols. There will also be a plug-in hybrid powertrain from next year\n\nIts practical contemporary interior means it's also perfectly suited for the school run and shopping trips and can tow trailers up to 3,500kg\n\nLand Rover has moved the gear stick from the centre console to the dashboard so that owners can spec their Defenders with a middle 'jump' seat. That means the smaller Defender 90 can seat six people in total\n\nLand Rover said the new Defender had been 'engineered with capability and safety for all the family'.\n\nState of the art 'cyber security' is also pledged to deter thieves.\n\nJaguar Land Rover's executive director for product engineering engineering Nick Rogers said: 'Our mission was to reimagine the icon.\n\n'We have also been obsessed about its off-road capability and about its practicality.. But it must also have agility on the road as well. It has. Its manners on the road are stunning.'\n\nChief designer Gerry McGovern added: 'The new Defender is respectful of its past but is not harnessed by it. This is a new Defender for a new age.'\n\nLand Rover features and technology at a glance FEATURES - Five trim levels: S, SE, HSE, First Edition and top-of-the range 'Defender X' - Front middle 'jump seat' for three-abreast travel (made possible by dashboard mounted ear-stick) - Optional folding fabric roof, echoing original, gives an open-top feel and allows passengers I the second row of the 110 to stand up when parked. - Durable rubberised flooring for easy brush or wipe clean - Portable rinse-system to washout mud. - Optional satin protective film 'wrap' to protect paint-work - Six 'curry hooks' for carrying take-aways - Tread-plates on top of bonnet reflect those on the original - 'Alpine lights' \u2013 small upper windows allowing passengers to look up at mountains - Exposed interior structural elements emphasise its industrial nature and simplicity - Side-hinged rear tail-gate - Exterior spare wheel on the back - Lots of interior grab-handles - 'Side-saddle' storage over side windows - Gloss white steel rims wheel option, like original - Storage space for two 2-litre bottles ACCESSORIES - Four accessory packs: Explorer, Adventure, Country and Urban - Electric winch - Roof-top tent - Roof rack platform - Specially designed side extendable ladder - Tow bar - Inflatable waterproof awning - Bespoke air-intake snorkel\n\nLand Rover Defender: An iconic British car...built in Slovakia\n\nJaguar Land Rover \u2013 which holds three royal warrants \u2013 from the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh and Prince Charles - announced in late April that new generation of its rugged Defender 4X4 will be built abroad in Slovakia rather than Britain.\n\nThe shock confirmation to build what is considered a legendary British car on the Continent will be seen by many as a bitter blow for the UK \u2013 but the firm has insisted that Brexit 'had not played a role in the decision'.\n\nJaguar Land Rover chief executive Professor Sir Ralph Speth, born a German national, has taken UK citizenship and was recently knighted.\n\nThe new Defender will be built at Jaguar Land Rover's new \u00a31billion state-of-the art factory stretching over 30,000 square metres and with capacity for 150,000 vehicles a year \u2013 with the option to double that - in Nitra, Slovakia, where the the Land Rover Discovery has been built since it opened last October.\n\nThe new Defender will be built at Jaguar Land Rover's new \u00a31billion state-of-the art factory in Nitra, Slovakia\n\nThe plant, opened last October, spans 30,000 square metres and has the capacity to churn out up to 150,000 vehicles a year\n\nSwitching production to Slovakia will free up capacity at Solihull to build the flagship Range Rover and Land Rover models, the manufacturer says\n\nLand Rover said the new off-roader and been designed and engineered in Britain \u2013 at its growing engineering centre in Gaydon, in Warwickshire \u2013 with petrol and diesel engines supplied from its factory in Wolverhampton.\n\nIt said switching production to Slovakia would free up capacity at Solihull to build the flagship Range Rover and Land Rover models, including electrified versions of its 4X4, and would be 'balanced by significant new investment'.\n\nMuch is riding on the new Defender which replaces the original iconic, boxy and massively popular Land Rover which went into production in 1948 after its debut at that year's Amsterdam Motor Show priced from \u00a3450.\n\nThere is also some sensitivity over whether the new model can recapture the spirit of the original. So much so that Billionaire British petro-chemical tycoon Sir Jim Ratcliffe is planning a rival back to basics Projekt Grenadier 4X4 to fill the gap left by the original Defender.\n\nThe outgoing 71-year-old Defender model was built at Jaguar Land Rover's Solihull factory near Birmingham until production ceased in 2016.\n\nLand Rover Defender: A brief history\n\nThe original Land Rover started life as a squiggle in the sand when, shortly after the Second World War, Rover director Maurice Wilks sketched out a car on a beach near his holiday cottage in Anglesey. It was the workhorse 4X4 vehicle he needed to replace the American army surplus Jeep he was then using.\n\nThe first pilot pre-production model called 'Huey' after its registration number 'HUE 166' and is fully working.\n\nThe original Defender began life in 1948 when it made its debut at the Amsterdam Motor Show as the first Land Rover, created out of aluminium as a practical vehicle for farmers and was meant to be Britain's answer to the Jeep during the immediate post-war austerity when steel was scarce.\n\nThe final version of the previous-generation Land Rover Defender being driven off the production line on 29 January 2016\n\nThe outgoing 71-year-old Defender model \u2013 much loved and often driven by the Queen, other members of the Royal Family, and Winston Churchill \u2013 was built at Jaguar Land Rover's Solihull factory near Birmingham until production ceased in 2016. Since then second-hand prices of existing Defenders have soared as they become 'collectors' items' \u2013 and increasingly a target for thieves.\n\nAstonishingly, some three-quarters of the two million Defenders ever built since then are said to be still in regular use.\n\nThe Defender name itself can be traced back to 1990. It was created to avoid confusion with a new Land Rover launched the previous year called Discovery.\n\nTo cheering and applause from the workforce at Land Rover's Solihull factory near Birmingham, the final Land Rover Defender 4X4 drove off the production line in January 2016 and joined the firm's heritage collection.\n\nThe Royal relationship with Land Rover goes back to 1948 when King George VI viewed the original Land Rover.\n\nThe Defender is aimed at everyone, from families needing a car for the school run to those who want to enjoy an extreme outdoors lifestyle\n\nThe Queen, who is regularly photographed at the wheel, took delivery of her first one shortly after coming to the throne in 1952 and has driven or been driven in Land Rovers ever since. She used a specially adapted one for her first world tour in 1953.\n\nWinston Churchill was given one as an 80th birthday present at his home in Chartwell, while another was used for Pope John Paul II's tour of England in 1982.\n\nPrince Harry became the first person to enjoy an exclusive sneak-peek at the new Defender at a pre-launch event in Holland ahead of next May's 'Invictus Games The Hague 2020', of which he is patron.", "description": "Not only does it look just like the new Defender, it also has a functioning four-wheel-drive system, fully working suspension and a straight-six engine that you can see chugging away under the bonnet.", "authors": ["Rob Hull For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
