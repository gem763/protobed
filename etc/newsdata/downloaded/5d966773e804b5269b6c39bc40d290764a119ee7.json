A real baby.\n\n\u2018This baby is lying there like \u201cwhat the f***?\u201d Then a monster, deformed, walks up and puts his clawed finger on this poor baby\u2019s face and the baby starts screaming.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m like \u201cwe\u2019re f***ing traumatising this poor kid\u201d.\u2019\n\nDan added: \u2018It was not our proudest moment.\u2019\n\nThe pair spoke openly about their time on set of Game Of Thrones (Picture: Getty)\n\nA recording of the panel, which has since been put online, also tapes Dan cracking jokes about the time a mother became uncomfortable when she overheard him planning numerous shots of her baby son\u2019s penis.\n\n\u2018It was very important for the story, because the boy children got given [to the White Walkers] and that the girls stayed,\u2019 Dan explained. \u2018So it was important that you saw this was a boy child, and I remember sitting there talking to the director, oh we were the directors of that actually weren\u2019t we?\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter another bout of laughter from the audience, he said: \u2018We were speaking going, \u201cno, we need to see the baby\u2019s penis. We need to see the baby\u2019s penis\u201d.\n\nIn the scene, the baby was seen slightly upset, but calm in the arms of the Night King (Picture: HBO)\n\n\u2018I was saying the words \u201cbaby\u2019s penis\u201d over and over again and I looked to my right and the baby\u2019s mother was standing there, as she would be if there\u2019s a baby on set.\u2019\n\n\u2018We had needed to reshoot that scene and do some pick-ups for that scene and the baby\u2019s mother opted out,\u2019 he added.\n\n\u2018She didn\u2019t feel comfortable about the director making loud, overt references to her baby\u2019s penis in front of 25 people.\u2019\n\nMore: Game Of Thrones Game of Thrones stars Maisie Williams and Sophie Turner named in under 30s rich list Game of Thrones\u2019 Grey Worm returns to promote Krept & Konan\u2019s new album Game Of Thrones creators drop out of planned Star Wars trilogy to focus on Netflix project\n\nThose poor, terrified kids!\n\nThe rare panel appearance also saw both Dan and David confess to \u2018making a mistake in everything they did\u2019 with the show, adding that they didn\u2019t have the experience to take on a series of this scale when they got it.\n\nGame Of Thrones streams on Sky Atlantic and NOW TV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
