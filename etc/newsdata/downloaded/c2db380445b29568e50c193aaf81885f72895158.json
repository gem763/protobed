These cuts could lead to demonstrations, the prime minister told CNBC's Hadley Gamble in an exclusive interview which aired Wednesday.\n\n\"Everyone is conscious there is a problem and everyone wants to take action. The issue is how to combine all our efforts in one big package of reform that will come with all the things we need to do. It's going to be tough but it's worth the time, the hours, the risk,\" he said in Beirut.\n\n\"We will have demonstrations in Lebanon, I'm saying it now. But we will have it one time, and that's it, fix it.\"\n\nHariri lauded the leaders of Saudi Arabia and Egypt for their focus on the potential of their respective countries. \"This is when I commend what President (Abdel Fattah) Sisi is doing, in Egypt, what MBS (Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman) is doing in Saudi Arabia. There is a lot of, you know, if you take the case of Egypt, how much Egypt is working on its economy, how much reform they are doing, how much they did in electricity, they did, this is what we need to do.\"", "description": "Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri said his approach to reform would not follow the tactics employed by other leaders in the region.", "authors": ["Emma Graham"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104851369-RTS1IF9J.jpg?v=1529452397", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
