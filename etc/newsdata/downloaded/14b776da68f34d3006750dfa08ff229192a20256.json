Pyongyang repaid President Donald Trump\u2019s walk-out from the February 2019 Hanoi summit by rejecting the U.S.\u2019s revised offer in Stockholm. The State Department, by contrast, claimed the two sides had good discussions in Stockholm.\n\nPyongyang characteristically took a maximalist approach, both in its rhetoric and its demands. Having commanded the U.S. to adopt a totally \u201cnew method of calculation,\u201d the regime disparaged Washington\u2019s new proposals. North Korean negotiator Kim Myong-gil declared that denuclearization is possible only after the cessation of all U.S.\u2013South Korean joint military exercises\u2014which Pyongyang claims President Trump already promised during earlier meetings with Kim\u2014and removal of U.N. economic sanctions.\n\nWhen asked which sanctions Pyongyang would like to see lifted first, North Korean Ambassador to the United Nations Kim Song replied: \u201cAll the sanctions.\u201dREF Pyongyang\u2019s insistence on sanctions relief runs counter to its post-Hanoi summit statements that dismissed sanctions as a concern while emphasizing that the U.S. must provide a security guarantee to the regime.\n\nThe Trump Administration provided a much more optimistic spin on the meeting, rebuffing North Korea\u2019s assertion that it had not provided a new proposal. A State Department spokesperson commented that \u201cthe U.S. brought creative ideas and\u2026previewed a number of new initiatives that would allow us to make progress in each of the four pillars of the Singapore joint statement.\u201dREF\n\nSecretary of State Michael Pompeo said, \u201cWe came with a set of ideas,\u201dREF and President Trump suggested last month that an unspecified \u201cnew method\u201d could help move the stalled negotiations forward. Pre-Stockholm meeting media reportingREF suggested that the Trump Administration was considering partial sanctions relief in return for incremental denuclearization steps.\n\nStorm Clouds on the Horizon. Pyongyang dismissed U.S. eagerness to resume talks in two weeks, declaring it had \u201cno intention to hold such \u2018sickening negotiations\u2019\u201dREF before the U.S. takes substantial steps to end its hostile policy. Nuclear negotiator Kim Myong-gil cautioned that without significant U.S. policy changes, the bilateral engagement \u201cmay immediately come to an end for good\u201d and depicted the situation on the Korean Peninsula as precariously \u201cat the crossroads of dialogue or confrontation.\u201dREF\n\nKim Myong-gil warned that, if the U.S. does not respond appropriately, \u201chorrible disasters\u201dREF could occur and ominously warned that the regime maintaining its moratorium on nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) tests depends entirely on U.S. actions. Subsequent to the Stockholm meeting, North Korea referenced a recent U.S. ICBM test and warned that it could \u201cgive tit for tat\u201dREF but, at least for the moment, the regime thought it premature to do so. Throughout the year, Pyongyang affirmed North Korean leader Kim Jong-un\u2019s admonition that regime patience only lasts until the end of the year when the prospect of settling issues becomes \u201cgloomy and very dangerous.\u201dREF\n\nWho Is in the Driver\u2019s Seat? Some dismiss North Korea\u2019s acerbic comments as diplomatic maneuvering and indeed, the regime often engages in brinksmanship to wrest additional concessions from opponents. But underlying the tactical maneuvering are enduring North Korean strategic objectives to maintain its nuclear arsenal. The regime has declared that it \u201cwill never barter the strategic security of the country for sanctions relief.\u201dREF\n\nPresident Trump declared that \u201cthe best thing that\u2019s happened to this country\u201d during his Administration was his \u201cvery good relationship with Kim Jong-un.\u201dREF But this relationship has not produced any progress on denuclearization. Despite repeated claims by Secretary Pompeo that Kim Jong-un agreed to complete denuclearization, the two sides have yet to even agree on a definition of \u201cdenuclearization\u201d or the \u201cKorean Peninsula.\u201d North Korea continues to expand and refine its nuclear and missile arsenal.\n\nSome argue, incorrectly, that there has been no cost to President Trump\u2019s approach. However, that neglects the large U.S. sanctions relief, cancellation of numerous military exercises, and embrace of a purveyor of crimes against humanity, which undercut all components of the maximum pressure policy. The U.S. also accepted 21 North Korean violations of U.N. resolutions this year without any response or repercussions to the regime. President Trump has now adopted a weaker version of the Obama Administration\u2019s strategic patience policy and timid incrementalism of sanctions enforcement.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s reticence to working-level meetings reflects its desire to deal only with President Trump. The President\u2019s dismissal of National Security Advisor John Bolton was taken as portending a softening of U.S. policy. Bolton\u2019s departure removed the strongest proponent for a U.S. preventive attack if North Korea conducts a successive ICBM test as well as the biggest constraint to an incomplete deal that prematurely reduces pressure prior to real denuclearization.\n\nDespite the setback in the February 2019 Hanoi summit, Kim Jong-un may feel he has the upper hand in negotiations. Pyongyang publicly referenced the 2020 presidential electionREF and may hold threats of resuming nuclear and ICBM tests as a Damocles sword over President Trump\u2019s head to induce additional concessions.\n\nWhat Washington Should Do\n\nThough there is little reason for optimism, the U.S. should continue diplomatic attempts to reduce the North Korean nuclear threat. But the Trump Administration should not become overeager to accept a weak, flawed agreement.\n\nThe U.S. should:\n\nInsist on a detailed, comprehensive road map to denuclearization. Any future agreement must include an unambiguous and public North Korean commitment to abandoning its nuclear and missile production capabilities and existing arsenals. The accord should clearly delineate necessary actions by all parties, linkages to benefits to be provided, sequencing, and timelines for completion.\n\nAny future agreement must include an unambiguous and public North Korean commitment to abandoning its nuclear and missile production capabilities and existing arsenals. The accord should clearly delineate necessary actions by all parties, linkages to benefits to be provided, sequencing, and timelines for completion. Require a robust verification protocol in any agreement, including data declarations of North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programs and arsenal, provisions for the dismantlement of those facilities, and destruction of the regime\u2019s arsenals of weapons of mass destruction. There should be inspections and long-term monitoring of declared facilities, as well as the right to conduct short-notice challenge inspections of non-declared facilities.\n\nincluding data declarations of North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programs and arsenal, provisions for the dismantlement of those facilities, and destruction of the regime\u2019s arsenals of weapons of mass destruction.

Announce it will resume canceled military exercises with South Korea and more fully implement sanctions if Pyongyang continues to drag its feet on complying with U.N. denuclearization requirements. America\u2019s self-imposed concessions did not lead to diplomatic progress nor reduce the North Korean military threat.\n\nWhile the U.S. should continue to strive for a diplomatic solution to the North Korean nuclear threat, it is more likely that North Korea will remain a threat that requires a bipartisan policy of deterrence, containment, and compellence. The best policy for the U.S. is a comprehensive strategy of diplomacy, upholding U.N. resolutions and U.S. laws, and deterrence until the nuclear, missile, and conventional force threat is reduced.\n\nBruce Klingner is Senior Research Fellow in the Asian Studies Center, of the Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy, at The Heritage Foundation.", "description": "North Korea and the United States gave strikingly different interpretations of the collapse of working-level denuclearization talks.
