REUTERS/Murad Sezer/File Photo\n\nTurkey says it is ready to advance into northeast Syria, after the United States began pulling back troops from the Turkey-Syria frontier in an abrupt policy shift widely criticised in Washington as a betrayal of America\u2019s allies.\n\nThe U.S. move will leave Kurdish-led forces long allied to Washington vulnerable to attack by the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK), which brands them terrorists because of their links to Kurdish militants who have waged a long insurgency in Turkey.\n\nGiving details of the overnight strike, a security official said one of the main goals was to cut off transit route between Iraq and Syria often used by Kurdish armed groups \u201cbefore the operation in Syria\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn this way, the group\u2019s transit to Syria and support lines, including ammunition, are shut off,\u201d the official said.\n\nIt was not clear what damage was done or whether there were casualties. Details of the strike, a joint operation by Turkey\u2019s intelligence service and the military, were hazy. One official described them as an air strike, while the other said the site was made \u201cunusable through various means\u201d.\n\nPresident Donald Trump meanwhile denied he had abandoned the Kurdish forces, the most effective U.S. partners in fighting Islamic State in Syria. But he praised Turkey as a trade partner, in a softening of tone hours after threatening Ankara\u2019s economy if it acted \u201coff limits\u201d in Syria.\n\nAmid deepening humanitarian concerns, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged all parties in northeast Syria to exercise maximum restraint and protect civilians.\n\nSignalling a further potential shift in the region\u2019s power balance, the Kurdish-led forces said they might start talks with Damascus and Russia to fill a security vacuum in the event of a full U.S. withdrawal from the Turkish border area.\n\nTurkey sought to underscore its determination to act. \u201cThe TSK will never tolerate the establishment of a terror corridor on our borders. All preparations for the operation have been completed,\u201d the Turkish Defence Ministry said.\n\nROCKET SYSTEMS\n\nBut a Reuters witness saw no sign of military activity near the Turkish border town of Akcakale, across from Syria\u2019s Tel Abyad. Howitzers were placed behind earth embankments on Turkey\u2019s side of the border, pointed towards Syria.\n\nSome 60 km (40 miles) to the west, multiple launch rocket systems mounted on two trucks were deployed behind earth embankments near Suruc, opposite the Syrian border town of Kobani. Artillery was also stationed in the area, and soldiers wandered around a nearby military camp.\n\nU.S. forces evacuated two observation posts at Tel Abyad and Ras al Ain on Monday, a U.S. official said.\n\nTrump\u2019s warning on Turkey\u2019s economy on Monday appeared aimed at placating critics who accused him of abandoning the Syrian Kurds by pulling out U.S. forces. The decision drew criticism from Democrats and a rebuke from some of his fellow Republicans in Congress, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\n\u201cAs I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I\u2019ve done before!)\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nHis remarks, reiterated on Tuesday in slightly modified form, met an angry response in Turkey, including from opposition party politicians such as Iyi Party leader Meral Aksener.\n\n\u201cThreatening Turkey\u2019s economy is a diplomatic catastrophe,\u201d she told her party\u2019s lawmakers in a speech in parliament. \u201cThe best response to this insolence is to go into the east of the Euphrates and break the terror corridor.\u201d\n\nBut on Tuesday, Trump tweeted: \u201cSo many people conveniently forget that Turkey is a big trading partner of the United States ... They have been good to deal with.\u201d\n\n\u201cWONDERFUL FIGHTERS\u201d\n\nAs for the Kurds, Trump said their \u201cwonderful fighters\u201d continued to receive U.S. help with finance and weapons.\n\nThe Kurdish-led forces have denounced the major U.S. policy shift as \u201cstab in the back\u201d.\n\nMustafa Bali of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said the continued Turkish military buildup on the border, together with information about further mobilisation of Turkey-backed Syrian rebels, indicated that \u201can attack is imminent\u201d.\n\nSyrian Kurdish official Badran Jia Kurd said Kurdish-led authorities in northern Syria may open talks with Damascus and Russia U.S. forces fully withdrew from the Turkish border area.\n\nHis comments to Reuters reflect the predicament of Kurdish-led forces in northern Syria after the partial withdrawal of U.S. troops who in effect shielded the area from Turkish attack.\n\n\u201cAt that time we may hold talks with Damascus or the Russian side to fill the void or block the Turkish attack,\u201d he said.\n\nSyria insisted it would defend itself against any Turkish assault. Damascus, however, was unable to prevent Turkey taking control of a swathe of northwestern Syria earlier in the war.\n\nRussia, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s strongest foreign ally, said it was not told in advance by Washington or Turkey about any agreements to pull U.S. troops from the northeast, adding it was watching the situation very closely.\n\nIran, another Assad ally, voiced opposition to any Turkish operation in Syria.\n\nGermany and Britain expressed concern about Turkey\u2019s plans for military action. German government spokeswoman Ulrike Demmer said a military intervention would \u201chave fatal security, political and humanitarian consequences\u201d.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump speaks about the House impeachment investigation during a formal signing ceremony for the U.S.-Japan Trade Agreement at the White House in Washington, October 7, 2019.
