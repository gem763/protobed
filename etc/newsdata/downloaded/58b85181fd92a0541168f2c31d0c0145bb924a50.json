General Assembly in New York on Wednesday. (Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nMedia critic\n\nThe Wall Street Journal last week affixed a number to President Trump\u2019s Ukraine scandal: Eight. That\u2019s how many times, according to the Journal, that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u201cto work with Rudy Giuliani on a probe that could hamper Mr. Trump\u2019s potential 2020 opponent.\u201d The pressure, noted the Journal, came in a July 25 phone call that became the subject of a whistleblower complaint, as The Post reported.\n\nWall Street Journal reporters Alan Cullison, Rebecca Ballhaus and Dustin Volz saw their reporting submitted to high-profile fact-checking on Wednesday, as the Trump administration released a memo of that July 25 conversation between the two heads of state. Reviews from some quarters weren\u2019t favorable:\n\nThe transcript proves the #FakeNews got it WRONG!\n\n\n\n\u274c No quid pro quo\n\n\u274c No mention of Biden 8 times\n\n\u274c No evidence of wrongdoing pic.twitter.com/g6wd1lfUEa \u2014 Team Trump (@TeamTrump) September 25, 2019\n\nIn the instanalysis on Fox News, host Bret Baier said, \u201cI don\u2019t see eight times Joe Biden being mentioned. I count three, tangentially. So some of the earlier reporting may have been something different.\u201d Fox News correspondent Catherine Herridge said, \u201cThere are not multiple references, as widely reported, to the former vice president and his son. Based on our count, there\u2019s a key reference and then some follow-on references, so a handful, approximately three.\u201d Later on, host Harris Faulkner referred directly to the Journal\u2019s reporting: \u201cIt says that the look into Joe Biden was mentioned eight times, when in fact, the first time you hear Rudy Giuliani\u2019s name on it is from the president of Ukraine and I can only find six instances of anybody\u2019s name, north of a couple of times, and it was Giuliani.\u201d\n\nAlso on Fox News, Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-Tex.) said, \u201cI didn\u2019t see Joe Biden\u2019s name mentioned in there eight times.\"\n\nWell, the Wall Street Journal never made that representation. To repeat, it reported that Trump had urged Zelensky \u201cabout eight times to work with Rudy Giuliani on a probe that could hamper Mr. Trump\u2019s potential 2020 opponent.\u201d So how does that claim compare with the \u201cMemorandum of Telephone Conversation\u201d?\n\nAs ABC News reports in a detailed breakdown of the document, there are eight distinct Trump requests for a favor/assistance with an investigation. Not all of them reference Giuliani by name, but the message is clear through repetition: Get with Rudy on this!\n\nA Wall Street Journal spokesman sent the Erik Wemple Blog this note: \u201cThe call record released today is not a word-by-word transcript, and while we do not know the totality of the conversation, this record clearly shows multiple references to Mr. Giuliani and a proposed investigation, which supports our earlier reporting.\u201d\n\nBolding added to highlight a key point. Fine print on the document reads, \u201cA Memorandum of a Telephone Conversation (TELCON) is not a verbatim transcript of a discussion.\u201d There are ellipses in the document that could be swallowing relevant portions of the presidential conversation. They also could be swallowing meandering Trump gibberish that defies transcription, even description.\n\nWhatever the case, the reporting of the Journal \u2014 and The Post, as well \u2014 was \u201cbasically on target,\u201d concluded Fox News media correspondent Howard Kurtz.\n\nCorrect. In his public comments regarding this scandal, Trump has complained about \u201cfake news\u201d and \u201ccorrupt reporting.\u201d In a remarkable twist of events, however, Trump himself authorized the release of a \u201cMemorandum of Telephone Conversation\u201d that corroborated this \u201cfake news.\u201d Thanks for confirming, Mr. President.\n\nRead more:\n\nErik Wemple: Fox News: Ukrainian president seems cool with the Trump-Biden thing!\n\nMax Boot: The rough transcript is devastating.
