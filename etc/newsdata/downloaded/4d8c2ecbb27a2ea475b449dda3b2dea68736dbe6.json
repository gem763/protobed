Ninow's legal aid lawyer Herman Alberts closed his case without calling any witnesses.\n\nWhile Ninow did admit to raping the victim, by forcing his penis into her mouth and inserting his fingers into her vagina, he claimed the victim found him in the bathroom and he acted impulsively.\n\nIn Ninow's plea explanation, he said he went to the women's bathroom to snort the drug CAT because he was afraid of being caught.\n\nThe State disputed this, saying that Ninow planned the assault and preyed on the victim, following her into the bathroom in a premeditated way.\n\nA mother's greatest fear\n\nNews24 previously reported that the mother of the victim had found Ninow naked in the bathroom with her daughter.\n\n\"No parent should ever see what I witnessed,\" she told the court.\n\nREAD: 'No parent should see what I witnessed' - mother of Dros rape victim\n\nShe testified that Ninow came out of the toilet and ran to the men's bathroom.
