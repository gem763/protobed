The result is a creation that wowed the international judging panel with its inventiveness and playfulness.\n\n\u201cThe idea of the magnetic wallpaper really stemmed from my final year university project,\u201d Zeng told HuffPost. \u201cI was writing a thesis about Little Red Riding Hood and how the story has evolved and been retold over the centuries. I was fascinated by the fact that the same set of characters appear in so many different versions of the story around the world. As humans, storytelling is fundamental to how we connect and communicate. I wanted to explore this concept, so I created an interactive surface that served as a base for this storytelling.\u201d\n\nTed + Chelsea Etsy's Design Award Grand Prize winner.\n\nZeng said her magnetic wallpapers are a fun choice for children\u2019s playrooms, but also have broad appeal.\n\n\u201cWe have speech bubble magnets in our shop, and we see lots of people using these on the magnetic wallpaper to leave notes for each other, written on the magnets themselves or on paper held up by the magnet,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great way to keep in touch as a family, or in the office.\u201d\n\nBelow, you can browse all of the category award winners for the first-ever Etsy Design Awards.
