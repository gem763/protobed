(\u201cIBC\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (TSX-V: IB; OTCQB: IAALF) today announced that it has signed a two-year supply agreement with a leading global manufacturer of semiconductor and electronics assembly equipment under which IBC will supply Beralcast\u00ae 363 cast components in multiple design configurations over a two-year period.\n\n\n\nSubject to the parameters set forth in the supply agreement, all purchase orders are at the discretion of the purchaser, and no proceeds may be realized under the supply agreement. However, if minimum order quantities are received, the agreement may result in purchase orders totaling approximately US$2.5 million over the term of the agreement.\n\nIBC has supplied Beralcast\u00ae components to this customer for more than 10 years, and recently completed a collaboration with the customer to further optimize the design of IBC\u2019s Beralcast\u00ae part.\n\n\u201cHigh-performance automation and manufacturing are great applications for Beralcast\u00ae materials,\u201d said IBC Engineered Materials President Ben Rampulla. \u201cRobotics, precision manufacturing, and automated assembly equipment use sophisticated designs and complex components to meet demanding design criteria and critical tolerances. IBC\u2019s Beralcast\u00ae components are ultra-lightweight, with high modulus and excellent thermal characteristics, and are ideally suited to applications requiring high precision and performance. We are excited to be involved in precision manufacturing and to continue to expand our long-term relationship with this customer.\u201d\n\nIBC Board Chairman Mark Smith commented: \u201cWe are pleased to be strengthening our relationship with a recognized global leader in this industry sector, and we look forward to supporting them for many years to come. IBC\u2019s collaboration with this customer to improve the design of our Beralcast\u00ae part illustrates how IBC works in partnership with our customers to maximize the design and effectiveness of the products we deliver. Those product development partnerships are key to building long-term relationships with our customers and helping to better meet their current and future needs.\u201d\n\nBeralcast\u00ae alloys are ideally suited to many applications where lightweight, high modulus, and cost are critical performance factors. The principal Beralcast\u00ae alloys are three times stiffer than aluminum with 22% less weight and can be substituted for aluminum, magnesium, titanium, metal matrix composites as well as pure beryllium or powder metallurgy beryllium-aluminum.\n\nOn Behalf of the Board of Directors:\n\n\"Mark Smith\u201d\n\nMark Smith, Chairman\n\nContact:\n\nMark A.
