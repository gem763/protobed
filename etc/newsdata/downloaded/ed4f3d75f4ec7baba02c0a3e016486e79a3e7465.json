Me: \"No problem\".'\n\nRefusing to make the payment, she transformed her overweight baggage from nine kilos to a light 6.5 kilos after layering herself with multiple t-shirts, pants and jackets.\n\nGel Rodriguez (pictured), from the Philippines, decided to wear 2.5 kilograms of her garments after her carry-on luggage exceeded the maximum weight of seven kilos\n\n'I didn't want to pay the fee for the excess baggage because it was only two kilograms (4.4 lbs), Gel told VICE.\n\nDespite her genius solution to avoid paying for her excess baggage, Gel said she will never attempt to layer herself with clothing at the airport again.\n\n'It was really hot,' she said.\n\nShe also joked that if she had known her post would go viral, she would have 'posed better' in the picture.\n\nIn her Facebook post on October 2, she shared a picture of herself proudly wearing what appeared to be five t-shirts, three pairs of pants, and three jackets.\n\n'From 9kg to 6.5kg baggage,' Gel wrote, adding a laughing emoji, along with the hashtag: #ExcessBaggageChallengeAccepted.\n\nHer hilarious post has since amassed more than 33,000 'likes', 1,000 comments and 'shared' more than 20,000 times.\n\n'Why didn't I think of this hahaha,' one said.\n\n'I wish I did this, I ended up throwing some of my things in the trash bin. What a pity,' another said.\n\nOne said: 'Hahaha good idea.'\n\nOthers admitted they have done this previously to avoid paying weight fees.", "description": "Airline passenger Gel Rodriguez, from the Philippines, has gone to extreme lengths\u00a0to avoid paying for extra baggage on a flight by wearing at least 10 pieces of her clothes.", "authors": ["Cindy Tran For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/04/19867238-0-image-a-44_1571367795728.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
