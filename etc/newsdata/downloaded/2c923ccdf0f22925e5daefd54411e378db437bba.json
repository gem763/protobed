It was team MVP Anthony Rendon collecting three RBI on three different at-bats \u2014 two of them on unsexy, but very MVP-like sacrifice flies.\n\nAnd it was 35-year-old Ryan Zimmerman pounding a 3-run home run that lit up the home crowd that\u2019s cheered for him since before Nationals Park opened.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in this game a long time,\u201d manager Dave Martinez said, \u201cand (in) big moments, big players seem to come through.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals handled the Los Angeles Dodgers 6-1 to tie the NLDS and force a Game 5 Wednesday, a potential turning point of historic magnitude for the franchise.\n\nKnown for their failures in the divisional round, the Nationals can advance to the NLCS for the first time by winning Game 5 in Los Angeles, where Stephen Strasburg is expected to start. Washington is 0-for-4 in NLDS appearances, dropping Game 5s in 2012, 2016 and 2017.\n\nZimmerman reflected on how going through the early lean years of the Nationals\u2019 time in Washington helped him prepare for moments like this week.\n\n\u201cA lot of these guys didn\u2019t ever even go through that kind of stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a good thing. We\u2019re moved on to: We\u2019re expected to make the playoffs every year. We\u2019re expected to compete. We have an ownership group that puts a competitive team on the field every year, which we\u2019re very thankful for.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals wouldn\u2019t be on the NLCS\u2019s doorstep without dominant performances from their elite pitchers. Scherzer had no problem recovering from a Justin Turner solo home run in the first inning, finishing with seven strikeouts and four hits on 109 pitches. He struck out the side in the fifth inning and forced two outs to escape a bases-loaded jam in the seventh.\n\nRendon tied the game in the third on a sacrifice fly off Dodgers starter Rich Hill to score Michael A. Taylor. Hill walked the bases loaded twice that inning before being yanked after 22/3 innings of work.\n\nThe Nationals had their way with the ensuing parade of relievers. Rendon singled home Trea Turner in the fifth, Howie Kendrick hit a clutch single and right after a Dodgers pitching change, Zimmerman smacked his home run 414 feet.\n\n\u201cI stood there and watched from third base,\u201d Rendon said. \u201cIt was a good way to get the crowd into it. He is a franchise player. He means everything to this city, to this team.\u201d\n\nRendon added his third RBI on another sac fly in the sixth. Sean Doolittle got four consecutive outs in the eighth and the start of the ninth before Daniel Hudson entered to ice it.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
