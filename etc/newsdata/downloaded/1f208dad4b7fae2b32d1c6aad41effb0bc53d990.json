(ANGO), a leading provider of innovative, minimally invasive medical devices for vascular access, peripheral vascular disease, and oncology, today announced financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2020, which ended August 31, 2019.\n\n\u201cOur top-line and gross-margin performance in the quarter was in line with our expectations,\u201d commented Jim Clemmer, President and Chief Executive Officer of AngioDynamics, Inc. \u201cWe continue to build momentum and remain focused on driving growth by creating a suite of disruptive and differentiated technology. The divestiture of the NAMIC Fluid Management business allowed us to begin the year with a strong balance sheet, enabling strategic acquisitions like Eximo Medical, Ltd., which we announced this morning. Additionally, we continue to make steady progress with site initiation in our NanoKnife DIRECT study for pancreatic cancer.\u201d\n\nFirst Quarter 2020 Financial Results\n\nNet sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 were $66.0 million, an increase of 3.3%, compared to $63.9 million a year ago and representing a decline of 1.0% organically. Excluding the impact of Asclera, sales of which were discontinued during fiscal year 2019, net sales grew 5.6% year over year and grew 1.3% organically. Foreign currency translation did not have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s sales in the quarter.\n\nOncology net sales were $14.0 million, an increase of 20.9% from $11.6 million a year ago, led by sales of the Company\u2019s BioSentry Tract Sealant System, the Alatus and IsoLoc balloon products, NanoKnife, and Solero.\n\nVascular Interventions and Therapies (\u201cVIT\u201d) net sales were $28.9 million, an increase of 1.1%, compared to $28.6 million a year ago. Excluding last year\u2019s Asclera Sales of $1.4 million in the first quarter, VIT grew 6.4%, as strong growth in sales of the Company\u2019s AngioVac and Thrombolytic product line offerings was partially offset by a decline in the overall Core VIT business.\n\nVascular Access net sales were $23.2 million, a decrease of 2.7% from $23.8 million a year ago, as lower sales of Ports and PICCs negatively offset growth in the Midlines and Dialysis businesses.\n\nU.S. net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 were $52.9 million, an increase of 2.8% from $51.5 million a year ago, and International net sales were $13.1 million, an increase of 5.3% from $12.4 million a year ago.\n\nGross margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was 57.9%, an increase of 170 basis points compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019, driven primarily by productivity and supply chain improvements as well as positive product mix.\n\nThe Company recorded a net loss from continuing operations of $1.3 million, or a loss of $0.03 per share, in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. This compares to a net loss from continuing operations of approximately $5.7 million, or a loss of $0.15 per share, a year ago.\n\nExcluding the items shown in the non-GAAP reconciliation table below, adjusted net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was $3.2 million, or $0.08 per share, compared to adjusted net income of $0.7 million, or $0.02 per share, in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.\n\nAdjusted EBITDAS in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, excluding the items shown in the reconciliation table below, was $7.3 million, compared to $5.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.\n\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company used $6.5 million in operating cash flow and had capital expenditures of $1.4 million. As of August 31, 2019, the Company had $83.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and no debt outstanding.\n\nFiscal Year 2020 Financial Guidance\n\nThe Company continues to expect fiscal year 2020 net sales to be in the range of $280 to $286 million and gross margin to be in the range of 58% to 59%, inclusive of the Eximo acquisition.\n\nSeparately, the Company is updating its expectations for full-year adjusted earnings per share to account for investments related to the full-market launch of the products acquired from Eximo, anticipated in the second half of fiscal year 2020, and now expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $0.10 to $0.15.\n\nConference Call\n\nThe Company\u2019s management will host a conference call today at 8:00 a.m. ET to discuss its fiscal 2020 first quarter results.\n\nTo participate in the conference call, dial 1-877-407-0784 (domestic) or +1-201-689-8560 (international) and refer to the passcode 13694372.\n\nThis conference call will also be webcast and can be accessed from the \u201cInvestors\u201d section of the AngioDynamics website at www.angiodynamics.com.

Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, not as a substitute for or as superior to, financial reporting measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. In this news release, AngioDynamics has reported adjusted EBITDAS, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share, free cash flow and net sales on an organic basis, excluding acquired assets and Asclera. Management uses these measures in its internal analysis and review of operational performance. Management believes that these measures provide investors with useful information in comparing AngioDynamics' performance over different periods. By using these non-GAAP measures, management believes that investors get a better picture of the performance of AngioDynamics' underlying business. Management encourages investors to review AngioDynamics' financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP to understand AngioDynamics' performance taking into account all relevant factors, including those that may only occur from time to time but have a material impact on AngioDynamics' financial results.
