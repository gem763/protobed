The FRC said it wants companies to improve judgments and estimates and will continue to press companies that do not meet its requirements.\n\nThe regulator also said it expects companies to present better disclosures on forward-looking information, risks, the carrying value of assets and the recognition of liabilities.\n\nIt recommends to companies affected by the phasing out of the London interbank offered rate in 2021\u2014an important benchmark rate used to calculate interest costs\u2014to start planning now for the transition to new rates. \u201cThis should include early consideration of the need to renegotiate relevant contracts and agreements,\u201d the FRC said.\n\nWrite to Nina Trentmann at Nina.Trentmann@wsj.com", "description": "The U.K. Financial Reporting Council is calling upon audit committee chairs and finance directors to boost the quality of their companies\u2019 financial reports, a move that comes on the heels of a review in which the accounting regulator found room for substantial improvement.", "authors": ["Nina Trentmann", "Nina.Trentmann Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-122123/social", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
