Fraud Guarantee advertises itself as a business which aims to help clients 'reduce and mitigate fraud',\n\nFederal prosecutors are 'examining Giuliani's interactions' with Parnas and another Giuliani associate, Igor Fruman, who was also indicted on campaign finance charges, a law enforcement source told Reuters on Sunday.\n\nLast week, The New York Times reported that Parnas had told associates he paid Giuliani hundreds of thousands of dollars for what Giuliani said was business and legal advice.\n\nGiuliani told Reuters for the first time on Monday that the total amount was $500,000.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, has admitted he was paid $500,000 for work he did for a company co-founded by the Ukrainian-American businessman, Lev Parnas, who was arrested last week on campaign finance charges\n\nLev Parnas and Igor Fruman were arrested and charged with campaign finance crimes in an indictment unsealed Thursday\n\nGiuliani told Reuters the money came in two payments made within weeks of each other. He said he could not recall the dates of the payments. He said most of the work he did for Fraud Guarantee was completed in 2018 but that he had been doing follow-up for over a year.\n\nParnas and Fruman were arrested at Dulles Airport outside Washington last week on charges they funneled foreign money to unnamed U.S. politicians in a bid to influence U.S.-Ukraine relations in violation of U.S. campaign finance laws. The men were preparing to board a plane to Europe.\n\nAccording to an indictment unsealed by U.S. prosecutors, an unidentified Russian businessman arranged for two $500,000 wires to be sent from foreign bank accounts to a U.S. account controlled by Fruman in September and October 2018.\n\nThe money was used, in part, by Fruman, Parnas and two other men charged in the indictment to gain influence with U.S. politicians and candidates, the indictment said.\n\nForeign nationals are prohibited from making contributions and other expenditures in connection with U.S. elections, and from making contributions in someone else\u00b4s name.\n\nFruman (second from left) and Parnas (center) are pictured with VP Mike Pence, President Donald Trump and Rudy Giuliani in 2018\n\nParnas and Furman are accused of funneling $325,000 from a mystery Russian businessman into America First Action, a pro-Trump super PAC.\n\nThe House Intelligence committee wants both men to testify about their work with Giuliani in Ukraine as part of its impeachment probe into Trump's interactions with Ukraine.\n\nBoth men met with Trump and Giuliani at The White House in 2018, where they posed for pictures with the President.\n\nHowever, Trump has denied any relationship with the men, stating last week: 'I have pictures with everybody. I don't know if there's anybody I don't have pictures with,' he said. 'I don't know them. I don't know about them. I don't know what they do.'", "description": "The businessman, Lev Parnas, is a close associate of Giuliani and was involved in his effort to investigate Trump's political rival, Joe Biden.", "authors": ["Andrew Court For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/06/19725542-0-image-a-18_1571119192408.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
