And not just any workplace, NBC News - where I spent 20 years of my career,' said Couric at the top of the podcast,\n\n'The story that Ronan Farrow chronicles in his new book Catch and Kill is full of intrigue, deception and accusations of sexual assault and corporate malfeasance.'\n\nCouric then went on to explain: 'It's a story I've been thinking a lot about and processing for the past two years, and one I am actually writing about as I work on my own book about my personal and professional life.'\n\nLauer hosted Today alongside four women during his 20 years in the anchor chair - Couric, Meredith Vieira, Ann Curry and Savannah Guthrie.\n\nTo date, only Curry has come out and said she was aware of women who had made allegations of sexual misconduct against Lauer.\n\nFarrow writes in his book that Vieira is the one who urged Lauer's accuser Brooke Nevils to come forward, but she had yet to confirm this or publicly speak about Lauer and the allegations.\n\nGuthrie meanwhile is still an employee at NBC, making it almost impossible for her to weigh in on what Couric refers to as 'corporate malfeasance.'\n\nCouric's silence on the matter had initially seemed like a sign of support for her longtime friend Lauer, but it now seems that this may not be the case.\n\nShe has said however that she did not experience any incidents involving Lauer while at NBC.\n\n'It has been painful time for a lot of people who worked with Matt, knew him and really cared about him - and who never witnessed or experienced any of this behavior that is now obviously being talked about,' said Couric in an appearance on Wedndy Williams' talk show last year.\n\n'I don't know the full extent of all these things that happened. I can only talk about my personal experience and I was treated respectfully and appropriately.'\n\nVague: Couric had previously said in interviews that that she personally did not experience any sexual misconduct involving Lauer\n\nWilliams asked Couric if she believed that Lauer would be able to make a comeback on television.\n\n'You know Wendy, that is not really for me to say,' replied Couric.\n\n'It depends on the path he chooses and how he decides to handle what has happened.'\n\nShe then added: 'And the full of extent of what has happened I don't think has truly been revealed.'\n\nWilliams then jumped in to offer her opinion, stating that she did not trust him and taking specific issue with the revelation that Lauer had a button under his desk to open and close his door.\n\n'I think it would be challenging. I do. I think the whole button thing, a lot of stuff gets misreported and blown out of proportion,' said Couric.\n\n'A lot of NBC executives, they make it sound like a den of inequity. I don't know what was happening but a lot of NBC executives had those buttons that made the doors open and close.'\n\nWilliams asked Couric if she ever had one of those buttons.\n\n'No, I did not,' said Couric.\n\n'I think it was an executive perk that some people opted to have and I think it's been misconstrued.'\n\nLittle Brown, who will release Coruic's book, described a few of the topics America's Sweetheart is set to cover in a press release.\n\n'In these pages she will spill the intriguing, little-known details of being wooed by Les Moonves to leave Today and anchor CBS Evening News, and the less than warm welcome she received upon her arrival from some of her colleagues at the \"Tiffany Network,\"' reads the release,\n\n'Couric will reveal the unapologetic Mad Men culture, ubiquitous in many news organizations, that led to revelations about some of the biggest names in the business, including her longtime co-anchor and friend Matt Lauer.\n\n'And she\u2019ll describe her failed efforts to follow in Oprah\u2019s footsteps when she jumped into the treacherous waters of daytime syndication ( Katie), and her misadventures as Yahoo global news anchor during CEO Marissa Mayer\u2019s rocky tenure.'", "description": "Katie Couric said that allegations of sexual misconduct and reports of wrongdoing by executives at NBC would be included in her memoir Unexpected, which is set to be released in 2021.", "authors": ["Chris Spargo For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/22/19858942-0-image-a-19_1571348550567.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
