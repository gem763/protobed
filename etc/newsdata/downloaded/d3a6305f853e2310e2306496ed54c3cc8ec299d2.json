The system has been tied to the crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that together killed 346 people.\n\nThe messages, which sources provided to Reuters, appear to be the first publicly known observations that MCAS behaved erratically during testing before the aircraft entered service. (tmsnrt.rs/2OZl4Ic)\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration ordered Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg to give an \u201cimmediate\u201d explanation for the delay in turning over the \u201cconcerning\u201d document which Boeing discovered some months ago.\n\nThe fresh discovery came days before Muilenburg, who was stripped of his chairman title by the board last week, is due to testify before Congress.\n\n\u201cThese messages indicate that Boeing withheld damning information from the FAA, which is highly disturbing,\u201d Peter DeFazio, Chair of the U.S. House of Representatives transportation committee, wrote in a letter to U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao on Friday.\n\nThe FAA said it \u201cis reviewing this information to determine what action is appropriate.\u201d\n\nA person briefed on the matter said Boeing failed to turn over the documents to the FAA for four months and that the Justice Department is also in possession of the messages.\n\nBoeing said on Friday that Muilenburg had called FAA Administrator Steve Dickson to respond to the concerns raised in his letter and assured him that the company \u201cis taking every step possible to safely return the MAX to service.\u201d\n\nIt said it had produced the document containing a former Boeing employee\u2019s statements to the appropriate investigating authority earlier this year, and brought it to the attention of the Department of Transportation on Thursday.\n\nBoeing has been cooperating with the House of Representatives Transportation & Infrastructure Committee\u2019s probe into the 737 MAX and will continue to do so in investigations by U.S. authorities, the company said.\n\nBoeing turned the documents over to the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI in February, one source said.\n\nFederal prosecutors aided by the FBI, the Department of Transportation\u2019s inspector general and several blue-ribbon panels are investigating the 737 MAX\u2019s certification. And the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee confirmed it will question Muilenburg at an Oct. 29 hearing, one day before a House of Representatives panel is scheduled to question him.\n\nThe 737 MAX has been grounded worldwide since March, forcing more than 100 daily flight cancellations at large U.S operators of the aircraft such as Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) and American Airlines (AAL.O), and eroding their profits.\n\nBoeing has said the grounding has already cost it at least $8 billion.\n\nIts shares fell 6.8% to close at $344.00 (265.8 pounds), before edging up 1.4% after hours.\n\n\u2018I BASICALLY LIED\u2019\n\nForkner said in one text message, \u201cI basically lied to the regulators (unknowingly).\u201d The other employee responded that \u201cit wasn\u2019t a lie, no one told us that was the case\u201d of an issue with MCAS.\n\nForkner responded soon after: \u201cGranted I suck at flying, but even this was egregious.\u201d At one point Forkner said \u201cthere are still some real fundamental issues\u201d in the simulator.\n\nIn the exchange, Forkner said he was writing while \u201cdrinking icy cold gray goose.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you read the whole chat, it is obvious that there was no \u2018lie,\u2019\u201d Forkner\u2019s lawyer David Gerger said by email on Friday.\n\n\u201cThe simulator was not reading right and had to be fixed to fly like the real plane. Mark\u2019s career \u2013 at Air Force, at FAA, and at Boeing \u2013 was about safety. And based on everything he knew, he absolutely thought this plane was safe.\u201d\n\nForkner and his colleague allude to technical problems with the simulator itself, which one former Boeing test pilot said may have contributed in some way to Forkner\u2019s observations and conclusions of MCAS\u2019 behavior.\n\nIn a separate batch of emails, released by the FAA on Friday, Forkner said in November 2016 that he was working on \u201cjedi-mind tricking regulators into accepting the training that I got accepted by FAA.\u201d\n\nDeFazio, the House committee chair, said such \u201ctricks and boasting\u201d indicates \u201cimproper coziness between the regulator and the regulated.\u201d\n\nForkner is no longer employed by Boeing. The Seattle Times reported in September that he repeatedly invoked his Fifth Amendment right to not turn over documents subpoenaed by the Justice Department.\n\nThe FAA reiterated that it is \u201cfollowing a thorough process, not a prescribed timeline, for returning the Boeing 737 MAX to passenger service. The agency will lift the grounding order only after we have determined the aircraft is safe.\u201d\n\nBoeing has been revising the 737 MAX software as part of its efforts to win fresh approval for the jet to fly again.\n\nSouthwest, the world\u2019s largest operators of the 737 MAX, said in a statement it had been unaware of the messages but continued to work with the FAA and Boeing to safely return the aircraft to service.\n\nFILE PHOTO: An aerial photo shows Boeing 737 MAX aircraft at Boeing facilities at the Grant County International Airport in Moses Lake, Washington, September 16, 2019. REUTERS/Lindsey Wasson\n\nThe Southwest pilots union, which has filed a lawsuit against Boeing for lost wages during the grounding, said in a statement that the document was \u201cmore evidence that Boeing misled pilots, government regulators and other aviation experts about the safety of the 737 MAX.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs pilots, we have to be able to trust Boeing to truthfully disclose the information we need to safely operate our aircraft. In the case of the 737 MAX, that absolutely did not happen,\u201d Southwest Airlines Pilots Association President Jon Weaks said.", "description": "A Boeing Co senior pilot said he might have unintentionally misled regulators, in a series of internal messages from 2016 that became public Friday, plunging the world's largest airplane maker into a fresh crisis.", "authors": ["David Shepardson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442466849&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H1Q6", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
