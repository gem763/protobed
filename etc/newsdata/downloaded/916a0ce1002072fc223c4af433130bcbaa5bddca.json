You\u2019re not alone.\u201d\n\nWhile Mr. Brees is well-known for his Christian faith, critics faulted him for partnering with an \u201canti-gay group\u201d as Newsweek put it, pointing to Focus on the Family\u2019s opposition to same-sex marriage and support for gay conversion therapy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing he\u2019s lending his face to a video targeted at schools on behalf of an bigoted organization that presents a threat to the lives of kids who weren\u2019t born to fit into their little Christian box,\u201d tweeted Louisiana Atheists.\n\nAmerican Atheists blasted Mr. Brees for appearing in \u201ca Christian hate group\u2019s promotional videos,\u201d while the progressive Big Easy Magazine launched the hashtag #SaintsDontHate.\n\nOthers rushed to the quarterback\u2019s defense.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous that the Left turns an encouragement to share God\u2019s love into hate-mongering,\u201d said Rep. Jim Banks, Indiana Republican, in a statement. \u201cNeither Drew Brees nor Focus on the Family have mentioned LGBT people\u2014they\u2019ve only promoted Bring Your Bible to School Day.\u201d\n\n.@drewbrees, a Christian, recorded a video with @FocusFamily (a popular org that provides resources to families) encouraging kids to carry Bibles. Somehow, some have leaped to the conclusion he hates LGBT persons.\n\n\n\nThe relentless assault on Christians must stop. \u2014 Jim Banks (@RepJimBanks) September 5, 2019\n\n\n\nFocus on the Family president Jim Daly said the organization had \u201cgreat respect\u201d for Mr. Brees and praised him for \u201cencouraging young people to show God\u2019s love by participating in this year\u2019s celebration.\u201d\n\nAs for the criticism, \u201cAmerica\u2019s pluralism demands tolerance and civility towards those who may hold to a different point of view.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs such, it\u2019s our hope that those who may object to us expressing our deeply held religious beliefs may nevertheless afford us the same respect they rightly expect in return,\u201d Mr. Daly said.\n\nAlso taking on the critics was New England Patriots tight end Benjamin Watson, who blasted BlackSportsOnline\u2019s Robert Littal for his tweet skewering Focus on the Family as an \u201cAnti-Gay Religious Cult.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is so weak. Stop lying,\u201d tweeted Mr. Watson, adding, \u201cHave done plenty of work with @FocusFamily and will continue to. No problem speaking up for my friends when they are being slandered.\u201d\n\nHave done plenty of work with @FocusFamily and will continue to. No problem speaking up for my friends when they are being slandered.\n\n\n\nThanks for calling me Benjamin btw \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe \u2014 Benjamin Watson (@BenjaminSWatson) September 5, 2019\n\nSpeaking from within the Saints headquarters and practice facility in Metairie, Mr. Brees released a videotaped statement in which he denied knowledge of any group\u2019s ideology and rejected any such labels on himself.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of negativity spread about me in the LGBQT community recently,\u201d Mr. Brees said, attributing the \u201cconfusion\u201d to a slanted headline he said reflected neither his intent nor belief.\n\nSaying he wanted \u201cto set the record straight,\u201d Mr. Brees then said he is guided by two Christian codes, one of which is \u201clove thy neighbor as thyself.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does that mean to me?\u201d he said. \u201cThat means love all, respect all and accept all. And that\u2019s how I live my life.\u201d\n\nWhat he took to be a straightforward attempt to encourage Christians to \u201clive your life with confidence,\u201d has instead been wildly misconstrued, Mr. Brees said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure why the negativity spread or why people had to rope me into certain negativity,\u201d he said. \u201cI do not support any groups that discriminate or that have their own agendas that are trying to promote inequality, OK? So hopefully that has set the record straight and we can all move on, because that\u2019s not what I stand for.\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s Bring Your Bible to School Day is scheduled for Oct. 3.\n\nThe Advocate, an LGBTQ publication, noted that Mr. Brees has \u201csignaled his support for LGBTQ youth,\u201d partnering with talk-show host Ellen DeGeneres on an anti-bullying campaign, adding \u201cwe have a few questions.\u201d\n\nHe has been an advocate for anti-bullying with Ellen Degeneres.\n\n\n\nSo\u2026we have a few questions. https://t.co/ddNMDbu2sc \u2014 The Advocate (@TheAdvocateMag) September 4, 2019\n\n\n\nAlso appearing in a Bring Your Bible to School Day promo is Christian singer Francesca Battistelli.\n\n\u201cGod made you for freedom.\u201d Grammy Award-winning recording artist Francesca Battistelli wants to encourage you to live out your faith by participating in #BringYourBible to School Day on October 3! pic.twitter.com/KApV36C38q \u2014 Bring Your Bible (@BringYourBible) August 26, 2019\n\n\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
