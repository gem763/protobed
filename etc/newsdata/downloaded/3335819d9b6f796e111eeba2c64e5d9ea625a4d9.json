He used slides and history lessons during a private Senate GOP lunch in the Capitol to talk about the process.\n\nWhile that was going on, Chuck Schumer said he knows his House colleagues didn't run for office to conduct an impeachment investigation, but:\n\nThe facts that are already in the public domain are so deeply troubling and must be taken very seriously.\n\n\n\nAnother key figure in the impeachment investigation, special envoy Kurt Volker, also returned to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to review the transcript of his 3 October testimony to investigators\n\n.\n\nVolker provided text messages to lawmakers that revealed an effort at the State Department to push Ukraine's leader into opening an investigation of the gas company Burisma connected to Biden's son, Hunter, in return for a visit with Trump.\n\n\n\nThat effort soon escalated into what one diplomat feared was a quid pro quo for US military aid. Trump has denied that, saying assistance to Ukraine was delayed to pressure the country into addressing corruption.\n\n\n\nAnother ambassador involved in those text message exchanges, Gordon Sondland, has been asked to appear on Thursday.\n\n\n\nThe testimony so far from the witnesses, mainly officials from the State Department and other foreign policy posts, largely corroborates the account of the government whistleblower whose complaint first sparked the impeachment inquiry, according to lawmakers attending the closed-door interviews.\n\n\n\nOne witness - George Kent - said it appeared Rick Perry - had taken over foreign policy. Another - Fiona Hill - quoted national security adviser John Bolton as calling Giuliani a \"hand grenade\" for his back-channel efforts to get Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. One witness -- said it appeared \"the Three Amigos\" tied to the White House - Sondland, Volker and energy secretary- had taken over foreign policy. Another -- quoted national security adviseras calling Giuliani a \"hand grenade\" for his back-channel efforts to get Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.\n\n\n\nTrump's 25 July phone call in which he pressed Ukraine's president , Volodymr Zelensky, to investigate Biden's family is at the centre of the Democrats' inquiry.\n\n\n\nPelosi, despite intensifying calls from Trump and Republicans to hold a formal vote to authorise the impeachment inquiry, showed no indication she would do so. She said Congress will continue its investigation as part of the Constitution's system of checks and balances of the executive branch.\n\n\n\n\"This is not a game for us. This is deadly serious. We're on a path that is taking us, a path to the truth,\" Pelosi told reporters Tuesday.\n\n\n\nTrump calls the impeachment inquiry an \"illegitimate process\" and has blocked officials from co-operating.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, Republicans are bracing for a vote and trial. House GOP whip Steve Scalise invited senator Lindsey Graham, who was an impeachment manager decades ago during president Bill Clinton's impeachment, to brief Republican lawmakers on the process ahead.\n\n\n\nAdam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee overseeing the probe, has praised the State Department officials for stepping forward, under subpoena, to shed light on the matter.\n\n\n\n\"We have learned much of this thanks to the courageous testimony of the State Department officials who have been put in an impossible situation by the administration,\" which is urging them not to comply with requests to testify to Congress, he said. \"They are doing their duty.\"", "description": "Donald Trump\u2019s administration announced a ceasefire in northeastern Syria\u00a0 after paving the way for Turkey\u2019s offence to occur in the first place, with the president celebrating the move as a \u201cgreat day for civilisation\u201d. The announcement was followed up swiftly by comments from the Turkish government casting doubt on the news, and criticism from those who have suggested that", "authors": ["Chris Riotta", "Joe Sommerlad", "Clark Mindock"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/17/09/donald-trump-0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
