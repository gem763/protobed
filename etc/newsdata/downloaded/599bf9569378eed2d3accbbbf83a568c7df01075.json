I would be nothing without it [\u2026] If there\u2019s a reboot of the show, it won\u2019t be as good as what it was, so why do it? It would ruin it.\"\n\nHer words echoed those of Friends co-creator Marta Kauffman who has always insisted that a reboot would never happen.", "description": "Meghan Markle and Prince Harry set a new record when they launched their official SussexRoyal Instagram account in April, but this week they lost their crown", "authors": ["Zoe Forsey", "Image", "Instagram", "Nbc Via Getty Images", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20641038.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_GettyImages-1178570604.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
