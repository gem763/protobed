Hold on to Your Hat.", "language": "en", "text": "President Trump is holding his first campaign rally Thursday since the House began an impeachment inquiry, and it\u2019s in a seemingly odd location: royal blue Minneapolis, home of political adversary Congresswoman Ilhan Omar.\n\nBut the Trump campaign views Minnesota, which he lost by less than 2% in 2016, as a potential win in the 2020 electoral map, according to several senior campaign officials and other people close to the operation. \u201cWe\u2019ve always believed that we can win Minnesota,\u201d one advisor told VICE News.\n\nBut the campaign officials aiming to sway some Minnesotans are also holding their breath on a second hope: that the president can stay on message. His recent public appearances since it came to light that he pressured the president of Ukraine to investigate the Bidens have often gone off the rails. In a press conference last week with the President of Finland, Trump called the inquiry \u201ca fraudulent crime on the American people.\u201d He\u2019s also accused those leading the inquiry of \u201ctreason.\u201d\n\nA Trump campaign official offered a blunt assessment, calling the show of force in the state a \u201cshiny object\u201d \u2014 a distraction for a president (and constituents) who have been increasingly focused on his possible impeachment.\n\nRead more: Trump's legal position on impeachment is bananas.\n\nStill, that\u2019s not to say focusing on Minnesota is a bad idea for Trump in 2020. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won the state by less than 2% which translated to Trump losing by 44,765 votes. The official pointed to similar demographics in neighboring states like Wisconsin and Iowa, which both went red in 2016.\n\n\u201cThe issue sets are similar as well,\u201d an advisor added, pointing specifically to Obama-era regulation of the mining industry that affected Minnesotans in the northern, more conservative part of the state.\n\nJennifer Carnahan, chairwoman of the Minnesota Republican Party, told VICE News in a phone call that it\u2019s \u201cvery significant\u201d to have both Trump and Vice President Mike Pence visiting the state this early in the campaign season. Pence will not only be on stage, but he also has a couple of official appearances in the state before this evening\u2019s rally. Second Lady Karen Pence and Lara Trump, the president\u2019s daughter-in-law, held a Women for Trump event in Minnesota on Wednesday.\n\nCarnahan said the slate of events indicate the the Trump campaign is taking a different approach to the state in 2020.\n\nRead more: Democrats are vowing to impeach Trump \"as fast as possible.\" But at what cost?\n\n\u201cLast time there was no strategic effort, no focus on the state because most people thought the state would go blue,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Trump campaign hopes to take a page from an unusual example in 2018 of a congressional district flipping from blue to red. That happened in Minnesota\u2019s 8th Congressional District, where Republican Pete Stauber won by more than five points.\n\nCarnahan also pointed to that district as a measurable way that Republicans are gaining strength in the state ahead of the 2020 presidential elections. \u201cOur 10 electoral votes are very much in play,\u201d she said.\n\nOne way that the impeachment inquiry doesn\u2019t appear to be hurting the president ishis fundraising efforts.\n\nTrump campaign manager Brad Parscale told the Associated Press that in the 24 hours after the impeachment inquiry was announced that the campaign raised $5 million from donors online in all 50 states.\n\nIn Minnesota, Carnahan says that they\u2019ve seen a spike in fundraising numbers for the state party in the last three to four weeks: 45,000 individual donors, which is a 50% increase versus where the state party typically is, she says.\n\nCover: President Donald Trump arrives to speak at a campaign rally at the Santa Ana Star Center, Monday, Sept. 16, 2019, in Rio Rancho, N.M.
