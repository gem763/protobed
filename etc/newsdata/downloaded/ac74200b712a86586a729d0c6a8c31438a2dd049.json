The same holds for Amazon's Prime Video service.\n\nBe smart: According to Mike Bloxham, SVP of global media and entertainment at research consultancy Magid, people are willing to spend around $38 monthly total on streaming services.\n\nThat means that they will likely chose between 3-4 services to invest in monthly.\n\nYes, but: Unlike cable contracts, most streaming services allow users to share passwords, or cancel at any time. Because of this, streaming services need to worry about how to retain customers, not just accrue them.\n\nOur thought bubble: The key differentiator for all of these new streaming offerings will be whether the packages are \"sticky\" enough to keep users coming back after they finish their favorite show or original series. For companies like Apple, even with a low pricing advantage, smaller content libraries will make it harder to attract and retain subscribers.\n\nGo deeper:", "description": "As streaming services multiply, consumers will be watching their total subscription bill.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/BFV-Scrr3EMSYePZfRqoXNi-iXI=/0x0:1600x900/1920x1080/2019/09/13/1568377323429.png", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
