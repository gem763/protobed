Here's what it could mean for you.", "language": "en", "text": "It seems like only yesterday that the Federal Reserve was steadily raising interest rates as the U.S. economy picked up steam after years of near-zero rates following the Great Recession of 2007-09.\n\nBut the Fed cut its key rate in July for the first time in a decade, another such move is likely next week and there\u2019s growing talk of pushing rates down to, or even below, zero.\n\nJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon this week said bank executives have discussed imposing certain fees on consumers if rates fall to zero. And President Donald Trump on Wednesday tweeted that the Fed \u201cshould get our interest rates down to ZERO, or less,\u201d allowing the federal government to refinance its massive debt at a lower cost.\n\nHere's why the Fed may eventually lower rates to zero or below \u2013 and what that would mean for consumers.\n\nPouring it on: President Trump rips Fed as 'boneheads,' calls for zero or negative interest rates\n\nWhen might the Fed reduce its benchmark rate to around zero?\n\nThe central bank almost certainly would not take such a step in the short term. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said the U.S. economy is performing well, and the Fed\u2019s key rate is well above zero at a range of 2% to 2.25%. But Powell and other Fed officials are worried about risks that could derail the record 10-year-old economic expansion, such as Trump\u2019s trade war with China and a slowdown in global growth.\n\nAs a result, the Fed is likely to continue to gradually trim the rate to spur more borrowing and economic activity, with markets expecting five more quarter-point cuts by early 2021, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. That would leave just three more decreases to get to zero, suggesting it could happen in 2021.\n\nWhy would the Fed lower the rate to zero?\n\nIt likely would take a recession, says economist Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics. But it wouldn\u2019t necessarily need to be a deep recession, such as the 2007-09 downturn, he says. That\u2019s because rates are already historically low as a result of a slow-speed U.S. and global economic recovery rooted in an aging population and weak productivity growth. Many economists are forecasting a recession by the end of next year.\n\nWhat are the benefits of a zero, or near-zero, Fed rate?\n\nA Fed rate at zero doesn\u2019t mean consumers wouldn\u2019t have any borrowing costs \u2013 banks still need to make a profit \u2013 but it likely would mean very low monthly interest costs for home and car buyers, as well as businesses and other borrowers. The problem: Far fewer households and businesses will be eager to take out loans if the economy is in recession, says Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for Bankrate.com.\n\nWhat's the downside?\n\nSeniors and other Americans who depend heavily on income from bank savings would be frustrated by a return to microscopic savings rates below 1%.\n\nLow rates also squeeze the profit margins of banks, who make money by paying interest to depositors and lending it out at higher rates to borrowers. The prospect of slimmer margins is what prompted JPMorgan\u2019s Dimon to say bank officials are considering introducing new fees to bolster earnings if rates dropped to zero.\n\nThat could mean raising overdraft charges and ATM fees and adding or increasing monthly maintenance fees for checking accounts, McBride says. Some banks might even hit customers with charges to transfer money or complete other transactions in person rather than online, he says.\n\nWhat would it mean for the Fed to lower rates below zero?\n\nA negative interest rate means banks would pay a small amount of money each month to park some of their money at the Fed \u2013 a reversal of how a bank typically works. Banks, in turn, could pass those interest costs to customers by charging for deposits. Currently, banks earn a small amount in interest by leaving cash at the Fed.\n\nDoes that mean you would have to pay interest on savings and money market accounts?\n\nBanks likely would charge big companies and other large depositors who need a place to store their many millions of dollars but could protect consumers from negative rates on deposits.\n\nDo negative rates mean you could get paid to take out a mortgage or other loan?\n\nThat\u2019s theoretically possible, but it\u2019s more likely a bank would charge very low interest rates on loans. If a loan did carry negative interest, the bank would increase other fees to ensure it makes a profit.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Trump wants the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates to zero or below.
