When not starting to freak out about how soon the New York City Marathon is, we've been busy keeping tabs on all the biotech news and beyond that came out this week.\n\nThe healthcare team is also planning to add two great reporters to the team \u2014 one to cover pharma/biotech and another (for the first time!) to cover health policy. Please, please help me cover the \"Medicare for All\" debate, things'll get busy on that front soon I'm sure. Know someone great for the job? Interested in what it's like to work at BI? My inbox/DMs are always open.\n\nNew to the newsletter? You can subscribe to Dispensed here.\n\nLet's dive in.\n\nA big week in biotech\n\nHoo boy, it's been a wild week in the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nTo start, on Monday, four healthcare firms agreed to a $260 million deal to settle key opioids cases ahead of a trial in Ohio. That's related to cases in just two Ohio counties, and more settlements are expected to leave drugmakers and distributors on the hook for billions in cases related to their roles in the opioid epidemic.\n\nThen Tuesday, we wok to the news that Biogen had resurrected aducanumab. Back in March, Biogen and its partner Eisai had written the drug off after predictions that two key trials were set to fail. After a reassessment of the data and work with the FDA, the drugmakers reversed course.\n\nThat puts us on the brink of the first new treatment for Alzheimer's in almost two decades. Here's what you need to know.\n\nI'm curious to hear what y'all think of this massive reversal. To me, it seems like it'll all come down to the data.\n\nBut thinking about the amyloid hypothesis's track record, I'm also worried about the emotion/politics that might be placing pressure on the science. It would be remarkable to get a drug approved that slow down the rate of cognitive decline in people living with Alzheimer's. I just hope we're not just trying to will it into existence.\n\nLooking back on the decade, we took a trip down memory lane thanks to a report put out this week by analysts at Leerink about ranking the best and worst pharma deals of the past decade.We added some context about why the top five triumphed (helps to have a blockbuster immunotherapy drug) or tanked (the hubris of biotech investing).

The quest is to find non-animal-based proteins that will melt like cheese.\n\nA food startup focused on protein just raised $3.5 million from VC firm Lux Capital, the company told Business Insider exclusively.\n\nThe company, called Shiru, is led by a scientist who spent 2.5 years at Silicon Valley food startup Just.\n\n\"What I'm interested in is unlocking the actual chemistry of how and why proteins behave,\" she told Business Insider.\n\nI took a look at the pitch deck of Hometeam founder Josh Bruno's latest venture, Path. Here's how he's convincing employers to work with him on their addiction-treatment benefits.\n\nMeet Path, a startup that aims to help employers offer better benefits to employees living with substance-use disorder. Path was founded by Josh Bruno, who previously started Hometeam, which provides in-home care for seniors.\n\nSo far, the company has raised $5.35 million from investors including Upfront Ventures, Meridian Street Capital, and Sequoia Consulting Group's venture fund as well as from former heads of benefits at Disney, Chevron, US Foods, and Cisco.\n\nHere's the pitch deck Bruno uses to sell the service and persuade more employers to rethink how they support their workers.\n\nClarrie Feinstein listened in to the podcast \"A Healthy Dose,\" in which Maven Clinic CEO Kate Ryder spoke with investors Steve Kraus and Trevor Price. In it, they had an interesting discussion about Ryder's career prior to becoming an entrepreneur. Before, she was one of us \u2014 a journalist!\n\nKate Ryder is the CEO and founder of Maven Clinic, a digital-health startup that helps women and families get access to healthcare.\n\nMaven offers tools for companies to support working parents, such as online doctor visits and a concierge who can help women and families make appointments. It has raised $42 million from investors.\n\nRyder attributes her success to her previous career in journalism, she said on a recent episode of the podcast \"A Healthy Dose.\"\n\nRyder began her career working for publications like The Economist and The New Yorker.\n\nShe said she learned two important skills from being a journalist that have helped in her success as a CEO: Always ask for the best expert opinion when making decisions and be a storyteller.\n\nI'll be out in Las Vegas this week for the HLTH conference, and if you are too be sure to come find me and say hi! I'll be the one looking for good running routes around the strip.\n\nI'll also be moderating a panel Tuesday morning and then having a conversation onstage with Ancestry CEO Margo Georgiadis Tuesday evening. Be sure to check them out amid the endless networking I can only imagine goes on!\n\nBe sure to send your burning questions for Georgiadis and my panelists to me at lramsey@businessinsider.com.

You can email the entire team at healthcare@businessinsider.com.\n\n- Lydia", "description": "Welcome to Dispensed, our weekly dispatch of healthcare, biotech, and pharma news from Business Insider.", "authors": ["Lydia Ramsey"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5c2f7f05bd77305daf6487b5?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
