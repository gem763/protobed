According to the affidavit, Anthony's probing of the network began on around December 7, 2016, and continued after he was terminated.\n\nSee also: Dark Web drug kingpin charged, forfeits $4 million in Bitcoin\n\nUS prosecutors said that not only did the Maryland-based engineer sabotage US Army Chaplain Corps servers by deleting all administrator and user accounts with the exception of his own, but also changed domain name WHOIS information to seize control.\n\nThe engineer did not have the authority to do so but was still able to contact GoDaddy and switch registrant data for the chaplaincorps.net domain to \"Anthony Enterprises.\"\n\nIn addition, 19 students of a Chaplaincy Resource Management course taking place in Jackson, South Carolina were unable to access the network or their accounts, which disrupted their training.\n\nAfter making sure he had sole access to the army network, Anthony then \"unlawfully shared proprietary information\" belonging to Federated IT and went on a file-deletion spree.\n\nCNET: Amazon bolsters Alexa privacy after user trust takes a hit\n\nDownloaded data included AWS service account information and network diagrams. Backup system images, known as Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), were also downloaded and shared.\n\nThis information has been given an estimated value of over $1 million by the engineer's former company.\n\nAfter termination, Anthony was linked to the full wipe of a test server belonging to the US Army Web Application system, and as there were no backups, this system had to be rebuilt from scratch. Prosecutors say there is \"probable cause\" that the engineer sent the data-deleting command, given he was the one with sole access at the time.\n\nTechRepublic: How to avoid the dreaded Google Calendar malicious invite issue\n\nA total of 37,439 brute-force attacks later launched against the same system have also been attributed to Anthony.\n\nThe engineer has been sentenced in the US and will spend the next two years in prison.\n\nInsider threats remain a constant worry and fear for the enterprise. Even if the concept of least-privilege is maintained to make sure that employees only have the access controls required for their roles, some -- such as IT admins and engineers -- require more than your average member of staff. The Ponemon 2018 Cost of Insider Threats report estimates that the average enterprise may suffer losses of up to $8.76 million a year due to insider threats.\n\nPrevious and related coverage\n\nHave a tip?
