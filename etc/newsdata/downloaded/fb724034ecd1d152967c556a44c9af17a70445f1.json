Disclosures by journalists helped to start impeachment proceedings in the Richard Nixon and Donald Trump presidencies in a country where the constitution expressly protects press freedom. Information brought to light in the media is no less important to the workings of the UK\u2019s unwritten constitution. In this era of challenge to professional journalism, that contribution deserves notice.\n\nConstitutions have formal players \u2013 in parliament, executive government and courts \u2013 with access to information that the public often lacks. Media disclosures, through leaks planned and unplanned, affect the players\u2019 calculations, partly because a more informed public is better able to judge them.\n\nWithout the Observer\u2019s detailed disclosure of prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s plan to prorogue parliament, would the opposition parties have prepared as successfully as they did to pass legislation aimed at compelling Johnson to delay Brexit in the event of no deal with the European Union by 19 October? Without the Sunday Times publishing details of the adverse impact of a no-deal Brexit, as assessed by the civil service in the Operation Yellowhammer papers, would parliament have known what to compel the government to release?\n\nMedia disclosures affect the players\u2019 calculations, partly because a more informed public is better able to judge them\n\nAnd when the minister Michael Gove made his initial offering, Hilary Benn MP was equipped to follow up in a letter to Gove (17 September): \u201cI would be grateful if you could explain why the document we received is entitled \u2018reasonable worst case scenario\u2019 whereas it has been reported that a very similar if not identical version obtained by the Sunday Times was entitled \u2018base scenario\u2019. Could you set out and explain any differences between the two documents?\u201d\n\nOn 2 September, when Tory party MPs were deciding whether to defy Johnson in crucial parliamentary votes over the coming few days, how many were influenced by this reporting in his most supportive newspaper: \u201c\u2026 despite Mr Johnson\u2019s claims progress is being made in the EU talks, the Daily Telegraph understands the government is to ask the EU to enter into talks about managing a no-deal Brexit \u2026 Multiple sources also claimed that Dominic Cummings, Mr Johnson\u2019s top adviser, considered the EU negotiation process to be \u2018a sham\u2019\u201d? Downing Street denied the report. In parliament, 21 Tory MPs rebelled.\n\nAfter a court in England decided that it could not rule on the lawfulness of Johnson\u2019s advice to the Queen to prorogue parliament, a Scottish court decided that it could rule, and found that the advice had had an improper purpose: to stymie parliamentary scrutiny of the government. The supreme court reviewed both decisions and found the prorogation unlawful because it had the effect, without reasonable justification, of frustrating or preventing the ability of parliament to carry out its constitutional functions. In such a situation, 11 justices said, the court will intervene if the effect is sufficiently serious.\n\nIn the mix in all three proceedings were official documents from which had been redacted Johnson\u2019s handwritten assessment of one of his predecessors as prime minister, David Cameron, as a \u201cgirly swot\u201d. The public learned this detail when Sky News reported it on 6 September, just as two of the court cases were being argued and decided.\n\nDemagogues thrive by whipping up our fury.

(The Scottish court referred to the leak in its judgment.) Johnson\u2019s note is an insight into the thinking of the prime minister when making a decision of major constitutional significance. Like the public and MPs, the judges could mull this private insight as they listened to counsel for the government advocating for Johnson\u2019s formal argument for prorogation.\n\nMore routine, but also valuable, is the straight reporting of proceedings in courts and parliament. Journalists are consistently providing news and analysis of the players\u2019 doings at times of historic importance for the democracy everyone shares.\n\nAny living constitution, written or unwritten, breathes partly through journalism.\n\n\u2022 Paul Chadwick is the Guardian\u2019s readers\u2019 editor", "description": "At times of historic importance, the media provides information that breathes life into our democracy, says Paul Chadwick, Guardian reader\u2019s editor", "authors": ["Paul Chadwick"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b13c1589519b9d67c909a449e945a6ea311ac11/0_300_6551_3930/master/6551.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=5559a940c2ccf91eb855ef3664ac2b1c", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
