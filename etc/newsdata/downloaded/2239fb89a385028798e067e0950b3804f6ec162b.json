Sign up here.\n\nEven a personal escort from a high-profile 2020 presidential candidate didn\u2019t help a group of LGBTQ asylum-seekers trying to enter the U.S. on Monday.\n\nTexas Democrat Juli\u00e1n Castro visited a camp of asylum-seekers in Matamoros, Mexico \u2014 people who\u2019d been forced into the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d program \u2014 and then walked 12 of them to the U.S. border, hoping to persuade immigration officers to let them wait for their cases to play out in the U.S.\n\nBut just a few hours later, all 12 migrants \u2014 some of whom said they\u2019d been harassed and assaulted in Mexico because of their sexual orientation \u2014 were sent back to Mexico.\n\nEight members of the group were LGBTQ asylum-seekers from Cuba, Guatemala, and Honduras, according to the Los Angeles Times. A deaf woman from El Salvador and her three relatives also attempted to cross from Matamoros to Brownsville, Texas, with Castro.\n\nSome of the asylum-seekers had previously asked to be removed from the program, officially known as the Migrant Protection Protocols, which requires migrants to wait in Mexico while their immigration cases are decided \u2014 a process that can take months or even years.\n\n\u201cWe tried this before and it didn\u2019t work, so hopefully with the support that we have today, it will work,\u201d Ray, a 35-year-old asylum-seeker from Cuba, told BuzzFeed News. Ray said he'd fled his country after being fired from his job because of his sexual orientation.\n\nWhen the group got to the middle of the bridge connecting Matamoros with Brownsville, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers stopped them and had them wait for a supervisor, who escorted them to the U.S. side for interviews. The group stayed in U.S. custody for about three hours, according to the Texas Civil Rights Project, which represents the asylum-seekers. Instead of being let into the U.S. to continue their cases, they were turned away.\n\nDespite its name, migrants enrolled in the MPP are often kidnapped or extorted by gangs and drug cartels. A recent report by Human Rights First found that at least 340 asylum-seekers forced to wait in Mexico have reported attacks including rape, kidnapping, and torture.\n\nSome migrants are particularly vulnerable, including those who are LGBTQ, and the Department of Homeland Security has said people from \u201cvulnerable populations\u201d can be removed from the MPP on a \u201ccase-by-case basis.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt flies in the face of the tradition in the United States of allowing people seeking asylum to make that claim and to remain in the safety of the United States instead of having to be in places like Matamoros,\u201d Castro told BuzzFeed News. \"A lot of families along the border who are part of this MPP program have been subjected to violence, some have been kidnapped, some have been extorted, some have been treated a lot worse than what they were fleeing from.\u201d\n\nCover: Democratic presidential candidate Julian Castro places flowers on the wooden markers of those who have died crossing the Rio Grande Monday, Oct. 7, 2019, on his visit to a migrant campsite in Matamoros, Mexico.(Denise Cathey/The Brownsville Herald via AP)", "description": "DHS has said people from \u201cvulnerable populations\u201d can be removed from the program on a \u201ccase-by-case basis.\u201d Not this time.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d9c9c6b5050a6000a260664/lede/1570544749108-AP_19280669359699.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.8438563327032136xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
