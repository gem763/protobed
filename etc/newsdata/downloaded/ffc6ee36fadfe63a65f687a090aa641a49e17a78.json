Photo: Courtesy of the retailer\n\nI don\u2019t work out regularly per se (aside from the triathlons across New York City that are my daily commutes), but in the past few years I have become a connoisseur of the protein bar. I currently eat about two a day, one for breakfast and another to crush hunger between lunch and dinner. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m completely uninterested in the stated function of a protein bar \u2014 I\u2019m currently trying to gain weight by any means necessary \u2014 but, like many regular-but-casual protein-bar consumers, my primary focus is on a bar\u2019s ability to deliver a combination of taste, high protein, and low sugar (with as few chemical sugar substitutes as possible, even with my emphasis on taste).\n\nIn my experience, most protein bars fall into two categories: glorified candy bar (looking at you, Clif Bars) or flaccid chemical-protein hunk (any bar with packaging that looks like the work of product designers for Axe Body Spray). For years, I\u2019ve searched for a bar that falls somewhere in the middle of that spectrum \u2014 tasty enough to satisfy the 10-year-old me who was raised on refined sugar, healthy enough to placate the 30-year-old me who is paranoid about ingredients and balanced nutrition, and filling enough to serve as a meal/snack replacement. In that time, I\u2019ve tried more than 20 kinds. I had a thing with Quest Bars until I couldn\u2019t trust them (the company changed their recipe to include more processed-corn products). I wanted to love Perfect Bars, but they are too high-maintenance (refrigeration is needed). Combat Crunch Bars were substantial, but I never once was excited to bite into one. All these on-again-off-again flings had me ready to quit protein bars entirely, but then, while on vacation in Toronto, I found the one \u2014 the protein bar I now consider my soul mate \u2014 while browsing a local health-food store.\n\nLove Good Fats Bars, Coconut Chocolate Chip - Box of 12 $32 (was $34, now 6% off) [Editor\u2019s note: To get the sale price, you must click the box to apply a coupon on Amazon, which will show the discount when you check out.] $32 at Amazon Buy $32 at Amazon Buy\n\nBefore I get more into why I love these ridiculously good bars made by the ridiculously named company Love Good Fats, I think it\u2019s worth elaborating on the nutrition-related criteria I considered on my journey to find them. Depending on whom you ask, some doctors and nutritionists say most protein bars are basically candy, while others argue that they can be an integral part of a healthy diet. If you\u2019re looking for the latter, it shouldn\u2019t be surprising that one thing people from both camps tend to agree on is ingredients are what matters most. And when it comes to reading an ingredient label, experts say the key things to look for are sources of protein (duh), sugar content, and ingredient complexity. Although protein bars in general tend to have a lot of ingredients and are processed foods by nature, I try to apply the Michael Pollan principle and look for ones made with as few things as possible. Protein types vary widely across bars: Most are okay, with experts typically naming whey, rice, or nuts as the best. (Dr. Stephanie Middleberg, the founder of New York City\u2013based Middleberg Nutrition, recommends staying away from bars containing soy-protein isolate, as the chemical process used to derive it often leaves behind additives like aluminum.) When it comes to sugar, there\u2019s no shortage of evidence that a lot of can be bad for you, and many protein bars will profess to be healthy by citing low sugar counts. But a lot of those actually contain artificial sugar substitutes like aspartame or sucralose (Splenda), which, according to a Duke University study, may destroy healthy gut bacteria and cause a spike in your glycemic index. If you\u2019re looking for a bar low in sugar, the Mayo Clinic recommends sticking to ones that use natural sweeteners like agave nectar or honey.\n\nGetting back to the Love Good Fats bars: They are keto-friendly, gluten-free, and made with a blend of healthy fats, including almond butter and coconut (these healthy fats help keep me feeling full after I eat one). The protein in most of the bars is derived from whey/milk, which means a lot aren\u2019t vegan, but the brand does sell some bars made with brown-rice protein. All the bars have roughly the same 9 grams of protein\u2013to\u20132 grams of sugar ratio; that might seem low, but I\u2019d say the average amount of protein is 12 grams (at least in bars I\u2019ve tried), so these still deliver a comparable amount with minimal processed sugar. There are no highly processed or chemically made sugar alcohols in them, only small amounts of Stevia (which, while neither agave nor honey, is an FDA-approved sweetener that the European Food Safety Authority and the World Health Organization say is \u201csafe in the amounts typically used,\u201d according to reports). When it comes to the number of ingredients, Love Good Fats bars have fewer than 20; many other bars I\u2019ve tried have more than 30, so while these are by no means a \u201cwhole\u201d food, they are by far the lesser of many very processed evils. And perhaps most importantly (to me), they are delicious. The bars taste exactly like a sugar-packed chocolate bar \u2014 even if a somewhat off-brand one \u2014 but have a fraction of those things\u2019 horrific ingredients and nutritional value. They\u2019re great at room temperature, but I also discovered they\u2019re equally delicious frozen, because the bars\u2019 texture changes into something like that of an ice-cream bar after a few hours in the freezer.\n\nLove Good Fats recently expanded its distribution beyond Canada, so now the bars are available at most Whole Foods stores and online retailers, including Amazon. I\u2019m partial to Coconut Chocolate Chip and Rich Chocolatey Almond, which are basically stand-ins for Almond Joy and Mounds bars, but the brand offers five varieties within its primary flavors, including a chocolate-and-peanut-butter bar that has only one gram of sugar. Every person I\u2019ve recommended them to \u2014 fitness obsessive or not \u2014 has since quickly incorporated the bars into their daily routine. Apparently, like mine, their love for Love Good Fats knows no bounds.\n\nLove Good Fats Bars, Rich Chocolatey Almond - Box of 12 $32 (was $34, now 6% off) [Editor\u2019s note: To get the sale price, you must click the box to apply a coupon on Amazon, which will show the discount when you check out.] $32 at Amazon Buy $32 at Amazon Buy\n\nMore Love Good Fats bars\n\nLove Good Fats Bars, Peanut Butter Chocolatey - Box of 12 $32 (was $34, now 6% off) The brand\u2019s \u201cbest-selling\u201d peanut-butter-chocolate flavor, with one gram of sugar.
