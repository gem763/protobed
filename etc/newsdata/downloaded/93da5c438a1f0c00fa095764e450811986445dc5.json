That comes after brand sponsor Adidas in December modified its eight-year deal through 2026-27 for a total of 408 million euros plus bonuses - for a base rate of 51 million euros per season.\n\nAlso at a shareholders meeting Thursday, Juventus president Andrea Agnelli announced plans to build a new stadium for the club\u2019s women\u2019s team - which is the two-time defending Serie A champion - to share with the Under-23 squad.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Juventus will now be making more than $100 million per season from its jersey sponsorships.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/22/italy_soccer_champions_league_60155_c0-298-2598-1813_s1200x700.jpg?b67d9ae4b5644e2d24055bae3d4860d0a83c3943", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
