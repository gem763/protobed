Alpina's got your back.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen spy photos of the upcoming Alpina XB7 on several occasions but today\u2019s the first time we can take a look at the vehicle in motion through this spy video. Coming courtesy of Automotive Mike on YouTube, it shows a near-production prototype lapping the Nurburgring at full throttle.\n\nSee the previous spy photos:\n\nIf this is your first virtual meeting with the seven-seat SUV, let us give you all the details you need to know in short. The XB7 will be Alpina\u2019s variant of the BMW X7, which is currently the largest SUV in the Bavarian brand\u2019s lineup. Basically, it will be the most powerful and faster X7 with a factory warranty money can buy.\n\nIt is believed the Buchloe-based automaker is working on two different versions of the performance high-riding people mover. The less expensive one will get a 3.0-litre inline-six diesel with more than 394 bhp and 560 pound-feet. This compression ignition motor could turn the XB7 into the most powerful production diesel SUV in the world.\n\nOn the other hand, a V8-powered sibling is also in the cards and, judging by the engine and exhaust sounds of the prototype, we are dealing with the eight-cylinder model in the video above. Both engines will be paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission, sending power to all four wheels through BMW\u2019s xDrive system. The petrol-fed motor will deliver in excess of 600 bhp.\n\nWord on the street is Alpina will launch the XB7 in Europe before the year\u2019s end. The debut should come just weeks after the company revealed the new B3 Sedan at the Tokyo Motor Show.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Want an X7 M?
