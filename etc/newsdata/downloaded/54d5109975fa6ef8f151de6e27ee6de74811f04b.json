This might sound ridiculous to anyone unfamiliar with the career path of the man widely regarded as England\u2019s greatest captain, but then sometimes the leader in the pack is not the one who tosses the coin.\n\nEngland\u2019s captain may be Owen Farrell, but it is Maro Itoje, at the tender age of 24, who has rapidly established himself as the commanding force among the side\u2019s forwards.\n\nThis will come as no surprise to anyone who watched the British and Irish Lions tour of 2017. Sam Warburton captained that tour magnificently, Peter O\u2019Mahony took on the responsibility for the first Test without hesitation \u2013 and did a mighty fine job despite what would follow in the later weeks \u2013 and Alun Wyn Jones led by example.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Search for the match highlights now, and it will be impossible to not hear \u201cOh Maro Itoje\u201d sung by 30,000 Lions fans.\n\n\u201cI remember most things about the game,\u201d recalls Itoje. \u201cIt struck me as quite a dramatic game. I\u2019m sure they could make an opera about it.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Ratings: England vs Australia Show all 31 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Then the red card [to Sonny Bill Williams] happened but we still had to work hard to try and wrestle the game back. It was just a good day, to be honest.\u201d\n\nItoje\u2019s modest words are not replicated by his teammates within that squad. A number of them, Irish, Welsh and English, spoke of a breakout performance that day, the type that puts you on the radar of the world, and it was no surprise when Warburton himself hailed Itoje as a Lions captain of the future. \u201cNo doubt\u201d, said the greatest British captain in the history of the Lions, and that includes Johnson and Willie John McBride.\n\nYet here we are, a World Cup semi-final against New Zealand where once again Itoje may not be the captain, but the leader of the pack. The Saracens lock has his way with words \u2013 the degree from the London School of African and Oriental Studies explains why he has such a descriptive way of giving his answers \u2013 and yet it is surprising, almost jaw-dropping, to hear him use a WWE analogy to describe the biggest game of his career.\n\n\u201cAs Ric Flair [the WWE 16-time world champion] said, \u2018To be the man you\u2019ve got to beat the man\u2019.\u201d\n\nItoje is of course talking about the All Blacks. \u201cThey are two-time World Cup winners in a row, and they have obviously been the dominant team over the last eight years and if you want to be the best, you\u2019ve got to beat the best. That is our challenge, that is what is in front of us on Saturday.\u201d\n\nFor a man of such a young age in rugby years, it is quite conceivable why his go-to analogy in the biggest week of his life is from a scripted WWE promo. But then that has nothing to do with the confidence that flows not just within his own veins, but within this team. The interactions with the entire 31-man squad throughout their stay in Japan has been one of educated confidence \u2013 not delusion, or hot air, or anything that may have been found in a WWE interview \u2013 but the genuine belief that regardless of what has or hasn\u2019t happened in the past, this England squad genuinely believes it will beat New Zealand on Saturday.\n\n\u201cQuite honestly, even if I hadn\u2019t experienced beating them, I\u2019d still have that same confidence,\u201d explains Itoje. \u201cMy confidence doesn\u2019t derive from the 2017 Lions tour. It\u2019s a different team and different circumstances. Their team has changed a lot too.\n\n\u201cBut my confidence derives from the personnel we have, the confidence we have, the other players we have and what we are capable of. I\u2019ve never ever gone into a game thinking that this team is going to beat me in this game. I respect what New Zealand have done but I don\u2019t see them as a team that is going to beat us on Saturday. I see them as a very good team and obviously they have to do some very dangerous things, but I still think that if we play our best rugby we will win.\u201d\n\nIt is a remarkable statement from someone still so young, and could well be used against him come Sunday if the semi-final doesn\u2019t go England\u2019s way. But win or lose, they are a leader\u2019s words, captain or no captain.\n\nWhat has become apparent on this World Cup tour is that for most of Eddie Jones\u2019s squad the 2003 final is their first and most motivating rugby memory from their childhood. But it is a different final that stands out within Itoje\u2019s memory, and one that shows the power of how winning on Saturday could yet be enough to inspire the next generation \u2013 after all, England don\u2019t tend to win World Cup semi-finals that often.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always believed in England, even as a young rugby fan,\u201d said Itoje. \u201cI remember watching the 2007 Rugby World Cup \u2013 that was probably the first World Cup where rugby really captured my imagination. I\u2019ve always seen England as a team that should be there competing for World Cups and should be there winning World Cups.\n\n\u201cAs a young rugby player you watch all these tournaments and think: \u2018I want to win. I want to be part of something special.\u2019 When Eddie said that [about this team], I hadn\u2019t played for England at that point, but I definitely bought into it from the start.\u201d", "description": "After captaining the British and Irish Lions to a series victory in South Africa in 1997, it took two more years for Martin Johnson to be named England captain.
