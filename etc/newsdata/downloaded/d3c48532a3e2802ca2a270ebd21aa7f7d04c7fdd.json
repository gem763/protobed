Then the honourable thing would have been for him to walk.\u201d\n\nBut Taylor, 74, didn\u2019t \u00adapologise. He didn\u2019t even \u00adattend the \u00adunveiling of the \u00adreport or, as the FA did, ring the Astle \u00adfamily when the findings \u00adbecame clear. \u00ad\n\nInstead, in what seemed like a dictated statement handed to him by lawyers, he is quoted as saying it\u2019s \u201cincumbent on football \u00adglobally to address this issue in a comprehensive and united manner\u201d.\n\n(Image: Paul Currie/BPI/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nWhen what the hundreds of families of ex-players \u00adcurrently battling dementia needed from the trade union leader was a sincere mea culpa.\n\nThey wanted steps to make an obscenely wealthy sport pay back those who helped build its global profile and a pledge to \u00adincrease the \u00a3565,000 it gives each year to affected members. A sum that is less than a quarter of Taylor\u2019s \u00adannual \u00a32.29million pay \u00adpackage.\n\nThe lack of a decent \u00adreaction wouldn\u2019t have \u00adsurprised Dawn Astle.\n\nWhen she met Taylor for a TV \u00addocumentary two years ago, he said he wasn\u2019t sure of any link between dementia and heading old leather balls.\n\nWhen she told him the PFA had a duty of care, he pleaded poverty \u2013 causing her to pull off her mic and storm out in tears.\n\nIt baffles virtually everyone in football that, after almost four decades in charge of the PFA, despite a litany of \u00adcock-ups and a vague vow to go sometime in the future, Taylor still remains in control like a septuagenarian Third World dictator.\n\nThe only silver lining in this sad saga is that \u00adTaylor\u2019s indifference to calls from people like Chris Sutton and the Astles to do the decent thing and resign sums up his legacy to perfection.", "description": "The PFA chief confirmed in March he would step down when a review of the organisation ends - but he must resign and walk away now", "authors": ["Brian Reade", "Image", "Empics Sport", "Getty", "Birmingham Mail", "Paul Currie Bpi Rex Shutterstock"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article18890143.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Gordon-Taylored.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
