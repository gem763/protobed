The charts show a gradual rise starting on October 6th, today reaching the highest level in the last 30 days, in which time it appreciated more than 50% in total. It\u2019s now moving toward its highest price in the last three months (USD 3.21). All in all, over the course of the last year, Chainlink\u2019s price is up 728%.\n\nLINK price chart:\n\nAnd though the market doesn\u2019t seem particularly interested in major announcement concerning some coins (we\u2019re looking at you, Tether), it seems that it\u2019s reacting swiftly \u2013 and positively in this case \u2013 to the news coming out of the Chainlink network.
