Attorneys general in Massachusetts and New York reportedly oppose the offer to settle more than 2,000 lawsuits alleging that Purdue Pharma created \u2014 and stoked \u2014 the nation's opioid crisis, allegations the Stamford, Connecticut, company denies.\n\nIf Purdue Pharma files for bankruptcy, it will dodge an October trial related to a rash of lawsuits that have been consolidated before an Ohio judge.\n\nPurdue Pharma declined to comment on the Reuters story but told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement it \"believes a settlement that benefits the American public now is a far better path than years of wasteful litigation and appeals. While the company is prepared to defend itself vigorously in the opioid litigation, Purdue has made clear that it prefers a constructive global resolution.\"\n\nAccording to Reuters, Purdue claims its global settlement offer \u2014 through which privately owned Purdue would file for bankruptcy and reorganize to become what's known as a public benefit corporation \u2014 has the \"potential to save tens of thousands of lives and deliver billions of dollars to the communities affected by the opioid crisis.\"\n\nIn addition to ceding ownership of the company, Purdue's founding Sackler family would contribute $3 billion of their fortune over seven years, plus another $1.5 billion after they sell Munidpharma, another family-owned business.\n\nA number of state attorneys general argue the family's settlement contribution is too low, according to Reuters.", "description": "Lawyers for opioid peddler Purdue Pharma have documents in works for a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, Reuters reports", "authors": ["Megan Cerullo"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/03/29/9c198fcb-d0b3-46a2-9397-7087a976758a/thumbnail/1200x630/96e9e3e265088ab72db1e20a7f8c999b/craig-oxycontin-lawsuit-3-2017-3-29.jpg"}
