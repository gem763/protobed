Beijing did not specify the value of the goods that face higher tariffs from Sunday.\n\nAlthough U.S. President Donald Trump has said the two countries will hold talks in September, there are doubts any such talks would lead to a breakthrough. far Trump appears defiant though on the tariff hikes, blaming the Fed and American companies for their difficulties in dealing with the tariffs,\" said Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP in Sydney.\n\n\"There is a long way to go though and re-establishing trust will be difficult after the experience since mid-last year. Share markets may still have to fall further to pressure Trump to resolve the issue.\"\n\nMany market players say the market's reaction was likely exaggerated by algorithm-driven players' flows in thin trading conditions at start of Asian trade on Monday.\n\nLiquidity could be even more limited than usual because of a U.S. market holiday on Monday.\n\n\"(The market move) goes to show you how many data mining algos are involved with equity linked compared to forex-linked.
