The brand has garnered endorsements from celebrities Cardi B and Kylie Jenner. And U.K.-based retailers Asos and Boohoo have also boosted sales by churning out clothing trends faster than traditional retail can keep up.\n\nEcommerce will comprise 36 percent of total retail sales by 2022, according to the latest report by market research firm Forrester.\n\nAnd rising rents have plagued some of the biggest brick-and-mortar fashion retailers. Barneys said in August it would close 15 of its 22 stores after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, while Lord & Taylor and Henri Bendel flagships closed this year after 104 years and 123 years in business, respectively.\n\nHudson\u2019s Bay announced earlier this month it would sell Lord & Taylor to rental subscription service Le Tote for $100 million. American Eagle and Urban Outfitters started renting out clothing such as jeans, tops and dresses earlier this year for $50 to $88 per month.\n\n\u201cIn-store retail will need to provide more real-time engagement with consumers,\u201d Brent Shelton, retail expert with Bospar.com, told FOX Business, stressing the importance of social media and in-store mobile prompts to retain customers. \u201cThey\u2019ll need to be flexible with payment options to compete with those associated with online shopping.\u201d\n\nBarneys aimed to do that in March when it launched a luxury cannabis boutique at its Beverly Hills store called The High End, a head shop selling smokers\u2019 accessories such as leather ashtrays, bespoke glass bongs and rolling papers.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nSaks Fifth Avenue, meanwhile, capitalized on the wellness trend, opening a pop-up at its New York City flagship offering manicures, boutique fitness classes and cold-press juices alongside clothing items such as yoga pants and leggings.\n\nOther stores have leveraged tech to upgrade user experiences. Kate Spade New York uses augmented reality to let customers browse through hundreds of personalized handbag options for its \u201cMake It Mine\u201d option.\n\nNearly 7,000 stores announced closings in 2017, and the number this year is up 23 percent this year from 2018, according to data from Coresight Research reported by Sourcing Journal. And, like Forever 21, 1,800 stores scheduled to close this year are in the apparel sector.", "description": "Forever 21 bankruptcy shows shifting demand for e-commerce.", "authors": ["Jeanette Settembre"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/08/0/0/Forever-21.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
