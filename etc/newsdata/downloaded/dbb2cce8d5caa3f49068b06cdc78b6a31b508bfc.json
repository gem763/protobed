Spokesperson Oupa Segalwe told News24 that Part 2 dealt with the role of politicians in the matter, as well as the \"plight of members of the public who were meant to benefit from the project\".\n\nOn Thursday, the High Court ruled that Mkhwebane had failed the people of South Africa with her first investigation into the Estina dairy farm, which had previously been set aside.\n\n\n\nThe court ruled that she should be personally held liable for the legal costs in the case and that she should pay 7.5% of the DA's legal costs, as well as 7.5% of the Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution's (Casac) costs.\n\nThe court further ruled that the Public Protector should pay 85% of the DA's attorney's fees and 85% of Casac's in her official capacity.\n\nIn her ruling, Judge Ronel Tolmay lambasted Mkhwebane, saying she had showed a \"total disregard for the taxpayers who will have to foot the bill and flies in the face of her complaint about how financial constraints limited her ability to properly investigate\".\n\n\"The failures and dereliction of duty by the Public Protector in the Estina matter are manifold. They speak to her failure to execute her duties in terms of the Constitution and the Public Protector Act,\" Judge Tolmay added.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
