This new RCS protocol will offer new features like the ability to request and send \"read\" receipts or to send and receive video messages as well.\n\nAT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon have partnered on a joint venture before. Their unfortunately-named Isis mobile wallet platform launched in 2012. Wanting to not be compared with the Middle Eastern terrorist organization with a similar name, the venture changed its name to Softcard in 2014, Bloomberg reported. Google acquired the company and integrated parts of it into its Google Wallet service in 2015.\n\nMichel Combes, President and CEO of Sprint, said in a statement that the new joint venture will bring a \u201cconsistent, engaging experience\u201d that makes messaging easier for consumers.\n\n\u201cAs we have seen in Asia, messaging is poised to become the next significant digital platform,\u201d he said. \u201c[The initiative] will make it easy for consumers to navigate their lives from a smartphone.\u201d\n\nRCS messaging will also create a seamless experience across carriers around the world.\n\nDavid Christopher, the executive vice president and general manager of AT&T Mobility, said the service will \u201cpower new and innovative ways for customers to engage with each other and their favorite brands.\u201d\n\nThe new standard will also provide customers the ability to message brands in order to do things like order a ride, pay bills or schedule appointments, the companies said.\n\n\u201cPeople love text messaging for a reason,\u201d Christopher said. \u201cTexting is trusted, reliable and readily available \u2014 which is why we\u2019re using it to build the foundation of a simple, immersive messaging experience.\u201d\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "The Cross Carrier Messaging Initiative will deploy a new messaging service starting with Android devices as soon as next year.", "authors": ["James Leggate"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/08/0/0/Cellphone-users-iStock.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
