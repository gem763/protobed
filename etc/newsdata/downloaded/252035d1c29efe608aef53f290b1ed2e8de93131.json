Zambrano refused to leave his car to address members of Maduro\u2019s Secret Police (the SEBIN), so SEBIN agents towed his car into the Helicoide, the regime\u2019s most notorious political prison.\n\nAs Maduro has not been the legitimate head of state of the country since January \u2013 and the National Assembly used its constitutional powers to make Guaid\u00f3 interim president to fill the void \u2013 Guaid\u00f3 is also the legitimate commander in chief of the country\u2019s armed forces. Military leaders have remained loyal to Maduro, however, making it impossible for Guaid\u00f3 to use his constitutional powers.\n\nMaduro\u2019s socialist tribunal announced on Tuesday that Zambrano is facing charges of \u201cattempts against the Venezuelan State,\u201d but that he would now await sentencing in a state of limited freedom, in which he will have to report to a court every 30 days to ensure he does not leave the country. Venezuelan state television cited Maduro\u2019s attorney general, Tarek William Saab, as saying that Zambrano\u2019s freedom was a direct result of the alleged dialogue between the regime and the \u201copposition,\u201d an assortment of Marxist groups to which Guaid\u00f3, also a member of a socialist political party, does not belong.\n\nZambrano spent about four months in prison despite the Maduro regime not producing any evidence tying him to criminal activity.\n\nHis dramatic arrest occurred in early April in front of the National Assembly. Zambrano was driving when SEBIN agents surrounded his car and demanded he step out. Instead, he took to Twitter, narrating the details of his apprehension.\n\n\u201cWe alert all the people of Venezuela that at this moment, 6:35 p.m., we are surrounded by SEBIN [agents], we are in our vehicle at the headquarters of [political party] Democratic Action in la Florida [a Caracas street],\u201d he wrote on May 8. Less than an hour later, SEBIN agents tied his car to a tow truck and hoisted him away.\n\n\u201cWe were surprised by the SEBIN, as we refused to get out of our vehicle, they used a tow truck to transfer us forcibly to the Helicoide. We democrats will stay firm on our feet in this struggle,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.\n\nThe Helicoide, once destined to be a luxury shopping mall, is the Maduro regime\u2019s special facility for prisoners of conscience; it also houses SEBIN headquarters. Survivors of the Helicoide say that torture is commonplace there, including electrocution, sleep deprivation, crucifixion, and rape.\n\nFollowing his release, Zambrano used his first moments in public to demand freedom for all political prisoners.\n\n\u201cThere must be a significant effort, first of all, to secure the liberation of all political prisoners, civilian and military,\u201d he told reporters. He described his prison time as \u201cbeing caged like animals\u201d and said that talks with the regime may soon generate the release of as many as 58 political prisoners.\n\nAccording to the Venezuelan Penal Forum, an NGO dedicated to tracking prisoners of conscience in the South American country, there are currently 477 political prisoners in Venezuela and over 8,000 people under \u201cprecautionary\u201d deprivation of liberty measures, like house arrest or probation, in the country.\n\nGuaid\u00f3 participated in negotiations with the regime for months following his rise to power in January. As any negotiation with the regime remains extremely unpopular among Venezuelans, Guaid\u00f3 insisted that the talks were not \u201cnegotiations,\u201d but \u201cmediations,\u201d without explaining the difference. Finding that the talks yielded nothing but time for the regime to regroup, Guaid\u00f3 walked out in early July, but changed his mind by the end of the week.\n\nGuaid\u00f3 is currently not in talks with the Maduro regime. Instead, Maduro has launched a \u201cdialogue\u201d with the Movement Toward Socialism, Progressive Alliance, and Red Flag parties \u2013 a consortium of unpopular Marxist groups. As a result of the talks, the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) \u2013 Maduro\u2019s party \u2013 will soon reenter the National Assembly, which it walked out on and replaced with an unconstitutional \u201cNational Constituent Assembly\u201d in 2017. Returning to the constitutional legislature may allow Maduro to unseat Guaid\u00f3 from the inside, though Maduro does not currently hold any legal public office.\n\nMembers of the opposition have reacted to Zambrano\u2019s release with caution. Journalist Ib\u00e9yise Pacheco referred to his release as a \u201cdistraction,\u201d a \u201cplay to try to create a smokescreen\u201d to empower Maduro. Julio Borges, a senior opposition member, rejected Maduro\u2019s \u201chostage trading.\u201d\n\n\u201cNicol\u00e1s Maduro is trading his dictatorship\u2019s hostages at the convenience of his miserable project to stay in power,\u201d Borges wrote on Twitter. \u201cWe are happy that his victim, Edgar Zambrano, is free, but we cannot lose the context of what is truly behind this.\u201d\n\nMar\u00eda Corina Machado, one of the few conservative members of the Venezuelan opposition, issued a statement saying she was \u201chappy\u201d Zambrano was out of prison, \u201cbut he is not free.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will all only be free once we expel these mafias from power, all the truth is known, as justice is done,\u201d she said.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "The socialist dictatorship ruling Venezuela released Edgar Zambrano,\u00a0first vice president of the National Assembly, from political prison.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/GettyImages-1168968379-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
