Instead, she\u2019s channeling her energy into competing on this season of \"Dancing with the Stars.\"\n\nAlaina told Fox News after Monday night's premiere that the show has been a welcome distraction for her and added that relations are amicable between herself and her comedian ex.\n\n\u201cJohn and I are still really good friends. It just, like, didn't work out, but it was good timing for me to come to LA and dance on TV. So it works out!\u201d she said.\n\nBut so far, Alaina's stint on the show hasn\u2019t exactly been the laid back vacation from reality that she thought it would be.\n\nLAUREN ALAINA REVEALS SHE AND BOYFRIEND JOHN CRIST HAVE BROKEN UP\n\n\u201cMy feet hurt so bad!\u201d she admitted, noting that during the first week of rehearsals, she was feeling the burn. \u201cI got blisters and my shoulders hurt because he [partner Gleb Savchenko] was constantly telling me to put my shoulders back. Apparently that's a thing I'm not very good at.\"\n\nTo alleviate the pain, Alaina got foot rubs and putting her feet in ice: \u201cIt was so cold!\u201d she exclaimed.\n\nFortunately, she\u2019s getting the hang of how demanding dancing can be on the body and has taken some proactive measures.\n\n\u201cI've been putting Band-Aids on my toes before the rehearsals. Before I even get the blisters now I'm like, 'we're not getting blisters again,\u2019\u201d she revealed, adding that her feet are a bit less painful now.\n\nLAUREN ALAINA DATING COMEDIA JOHN CRIST MONTHS AFTER ENDING ENGAGEMENT\n\nWhen asked if Savchenko was strict, Alaina flashed a big grin to which Savchenko replied: \u201cAm I strict? Am I like a Russian dictator?\u201d The country songstress playfully nodded and added that she thinks that they are a perfect match on the ballroom floor.\n\n\u201cI'm really good for him because I don't know if Gleb laughs a lot, but he laughs a lot with me,\" she revealed. \"I've made him laugh until he cried like four times.\"\n\nAlaina was shocked to find out that she earned a 7 from one of the judges after her debut performance. \u201cI thought we were going to get threes and fours! ... I thought I passed out for a second and like was asleep and then I was like, \u2018Did we actually just get a seven?\u2019\u201d\n\nHANNAH BROWN HOPES 'DANCING WITH THE STARS' WILL SHOW A NEW SIDE OF HER AFTER 'BACHELORETTE' HEARTBREAK\n\nSavchenko was thrilled with how well his partner did on her very first performance night: \u201cShe's amazing. We got a seven. I'm so proud of you. Awesome for week one. We\u2019ve got some work to do, but we're going to stay,\u201d he said, pulling her in to wrap his arm around her. For extra reassurance, he told her that he\u2019d been on the show since season 16 and had never had a seven in week one. \u201cThis is my first seven,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe duo have undeniable chemistry, so much so that one reporter asked Savchenko if he was single, implying that he could be the perfect rebound for the recently single Alaina.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m married,\u201d he explained. Alaina then sarcastically said, \u201cThat wouldn't be bad for me at all. Yeah, good plan,\u201d with a laugh before adding, \u201ceven if he was single, that would be a bad idea.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe show tapes in the same studio as \"American Idol,\" the show on which Alaina finished runner-up behind Scotty McCreary in 2011.\n\n\"I was very excited it was in the same building because my life literally changed in this building,\" she said. \"So that gave me like some sort of peace or something. But the dance scared me today.\"", "description": "Lauren Alaina may have split with former\u00a0boyfriend John Crist,\u00a0but she isn\u2019t curled up in bed\u00a0with a tub of ice cream.", "authors": ["Nicole Pajer"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/lauren-alaina-getty-2017.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
