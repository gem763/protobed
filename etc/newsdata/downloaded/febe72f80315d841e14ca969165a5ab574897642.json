It\u2019s an almost utopian image of a blended family, a notion that is solidified when the adult Rainbow Johnson (Tracee Ellis Ross) notes via voice-over that within the bubble of the commune there was \u201cno racism, no sexism, and everyone was truly equal.\u201d\n\nThis sort of sentiment around interracial partnerships isn\u2019t new. As Lauren Michele Jackson wrote for BuzzFeed two years ago, there\u2019s a \u201cculture-wide infatuation with interracial relationships and their heteronormative outcome, multiracial children. In advertising, on film, and on TV, there is a common preference for multiracial-looking people, along with the belief that they represent a utopian political future. Why do multiracial children so often function as the antonym for racism? What is the political value of an interracial relationship? The notion that cream-colored babies will save the world is a popular one. Unfortunately, it\u2019s a myth.\u201d\n\nGoing into Mixed-ish, I wondered what edification the show could offer about these questions of multiracial identity and family. Could a sitcom of this sort truly deal with the thorny politics of being half-white and half-black in America during the 1980s and still speak eloquently to today? I was granted only one episode for review, but as it stands, Mixed-ish has work to do before it achieves the right balance. While the show is mostly well cast, with the expressive Arica Himmel making a great 12-year-old Rainbow Johnson, the humor in the premiere episode vacillates between being too saccharine and too bluntly reliant on well-worn racial stereotypes.\n\nMixed-ish begins with the clumsy framing device of the adult Rainbow reflecting back on her childhood after being reminded that she grew up in what was essentially a cult. Ross\u2019s voice-over is gentle and illuminating, placing us in the mind-set of her younger self, who is fiercely trying to hold on to her old way of life and, by extension, the na\u00efvet\u00e9 that allowed her to avoid considering race as a factor in her life. Ross\u2019s voice-over reminds us that Loving v. Virginia had just made interracial marriage legal in 1967 and that pairings like these are far more common now than they were in 1985.\n\nIt\u2019s a fair point worth making, but the show\u2019s depiction of the Johnson siblings \u2014 who also include the sassy, wise beyond her years youngest, Santamonica (Mykal-Michelle Harris); and the middle child, Johan (Ethan William Childress) \u2014 being ostracized at school left a sour taste in my mouth. Walking into the lunchroom, the siblings are confronted by a black kid who asks, \u201cWhat are you weirdos mixed with?,\u201d prompting Rainbow to wonder in confusion, \u201cWhat\u2019s mixed?\u201d The Johnson siblings may have lighter complexions, but it\u2019s hard to imagine their mere presence leaving another black person confused even in the 1980s. Even stranger is how the narrative sets up the idea that the Johnson siblings must choose between being black or white, as if the racial codes of America would ever make such passing possible for them. In this moment, the prickly racial dynamics of the fledgling series feel both blunt and thinly construed \u2014 which is perhaps understandable at this early stage but would have been easier to endure if the show\u2019s humor fared better.\n\nIn both concept and casting, Mixed-ish possesses the right pieces, but it hasn\u2019t yet figured out how to fit them together in a satisfying way. Tika Sumpter is radiant as Rainbow\u2019s mother, Alicia, but it\u2019s hard to buy into the character given how quickly she goes from wanting her children and family to be \u201cabove race\u201d to realizing how impossible that is. Sumpter and Mark-Paul Gosselaar, as the family\u2019s idealistic patriarch, Paul, share flashes of easygoing charm, but the chemistry between them hasn\u2019t gelled. Worse yet is Gary Cole, an actor I typically like but who is saddled here with playing a blunt caricature of a Republican who says lines like \u201cThis is why I don\u2019t do cocaine. I am cocaine.\u201d That the character has any impact at all is thanks to Cole\u2019s skills as a comedic performer. But like so much about the premiere \u2014 from its too-clean set design to its too-clean outlook on race \u2014 it only half works, at best.", "description": "A review of ABC\u2019s Mixed-ish, a spinoff from Black-ish creator Kenya Barris and Peter Saji, starring Arica Himmell as a 12-year-old Rainbow Johnson, the Black-ish character played by Tracee Ellis Ross, who provides narration.", "authors": ["Angelica Jade Basti\u00e9n"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/24/24-mixed-ish.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
