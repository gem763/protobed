A senior Democratic aide with insight into moderate Democratic thinking told CNN that many members preferred for Pelosi to wait until the end of the week when the contents of the complaint and transcript were fully known.", "description": "", "authors": ["Cnn.Com Politics Live-News"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
