Snyder was just 34 when he bought the team he grew up rooting for in 1999, paying $800 million.\n\nA new story from the Washington Post\u2019s Adam Kilgore takes at look at the first two decades of Snyder\u2019s ownership and comes to the same conclusion many of the team\u2019s fans have come to: it\u2019s not going well.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\u2018Unlike Snyder, I return phone calls\u2019\n\nNow 54, Snyder is unlike many of his fellow team owners in that he says very little publicly. He declined to sit down with Kilgore through a spokesman, and when Snyder grants interviews they\u2019re usually done with team-friendly outlets.\n\nWashington franchise owner Daniel Snyder has owned the team for 20 years. (AP)\n\nHe owns a legendary franchise in a huge media market, but is elusive. It has not gone unnoticed.\n\nIn his reporting, Kilgore called John Kent Cooke, the son of Jack Kent Cooke, who owned Washington until his death in 1997. John Kent Cooke was part of a group that tried to buy the franchise after his father\u2019s passing and was outbid by Snyder.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem John Kent Cooke is a fan of Snyder or what he\u2019s done with the team his father had for 36 years.\n\n\u201cUnlike Snyder,\u201d he said. \u201cI return phone calls.\u201d Cooke continued: \u201cI think that what\u2019s happened over the 20-year period is that he has taken a franchise that has been universally respected in sports, not just the NFL, and proceeded to drag it down to mediocrity. It\u2019s no longer one of the premier sports franchises in the United States.\u201d\n\n\u2018As long as Dan\u2019s there, they don\u2019t have a chance\u2019\n\nCooke isn\u2019t the only one bothered by Snyder\u2019s tenure and how Washington has played and been run on his watch.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Stephen Jones, the son of Dallas Cowboys owner/general manager Jerry Jones and the Cowboys\u2019 chief operating officer called Snyder \u201ca visionary,\u201d one former high-ranking Washington employee said Snyder is the problem.\n\n\u201cAs long as Dan\u2019s there, they don\u2019t have a chance,\u201d the former franchise employee said. \u201cEven though the players are much better than they were \u2026 at the end of the day, everybody has to be beating on the same drum. If you\u2019re not on your game [in the NFL], you\u2019re going to get exposed very quickly. And that\u2019s what\u2019s happened to him.\u201d\n\nAccording to NFL insiders, Snyder has become less involved in football decisions, but still doesn\u2019t always trust and listen to the people he hires \u2014 especially if their opinion conflicts with his.\n\n[Watch live NFL games all season long for free on the Yahoo Sports app]\n\nUnder Snyder, the Redskins are 139-180-1, a .436 winning percentage. They\u2019ve won just three NFC East titles in that time, including in his first season, 1999 (the others came in 2012 and \u201815). They\u2019ve made the playoffs five times, and finished last in the division eight times.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s just not being run properly\u2019\n\nThe years since that 2015 NFC East crown \u2014 Washington lost a home game in the wild-card round to Green Bay \u2014 have not been great. Washington has finished third in the division in each of the past three years, and not much is expected again this season.\n\nLast year\u2019s home opener wasn\u2019t a sellout, which would have been unthinkable several years ago. At times, the empty seats were hard not to notice during television broadcasts. There\u2019s no longer a waiting list for season tickets.\n\nWhile Washington\u2019s struggles don\u2019t necessarily impact the value of other NFL teams, the optics of one of the league\u2019s marquee franchises struggling on-field and being a mess off it isn\u2019t great.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more the perception of it,\u201d an NFL power broker said. \u201cYou have a top-flight franchise that should be doing very, very well. But they\u2019re not. \u2026 It\u2019s just not being run properly.\u201d\n\nWhile the Redskins provided Kilgore with three individuals who spoke highly of Snyder \u2014 including current Los Angeles Rams head coach Sean McVay, who was Washington\u2019s offensive coordinator before he was hired by the Rams \u2013 others who spoke anonymously in order to be frank said they know Snyder has the drive to win but just doesn\u2019t know how.\n\nLast year, the team hired marketing executive Brian Lafemina away from the NFL office. Lafemina is highly regarded, so the move was considered a good one by observers. But Snyder fired Lafemina after only eight months. Almost 40 other business-side employees have left since Lafemina was ousted.\n\nKilgore gets into more, including Washington\u2019s pursuit of a new stadium, which is both needed and could offer a boost to the franchise.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "A new story reflects on the first 20 years of Snyder as a franchise owner.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/7Ne3cjf40xr3183Z37u.IQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/YrbeupwRhlHj0Mc4U7DJGg--~B/aD0yMTk2O3c9MzI5NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/05c83ac0-ce73-11e9-9cdb-e65ccba809d5"}
