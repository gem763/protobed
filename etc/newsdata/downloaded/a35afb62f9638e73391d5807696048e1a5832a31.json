(iStock)\n\nYour best friend may not know when you last had sex, but it\u2019s possible that Facebook does.\n\nAt least two menstruation-tracking apps, Maya and MIA Fem, were sharing intimate details of users\u2019 sexual health with Facebook and other entities, according to a new report from Britain-based privacy watchdog Privacy International. In some cases, those details, which are self-recorded by users in the app, included when a user last had sex, the type of contraception used, her mood and whether she was ovulating.\n\nThe findings raise questions about the security of our most private information in an age where employers, insurers and advertisers can use data to discriminate or target certain categories of people.\n\nThe information was shared with the social media giant via the Facebook Software Development Kit, a product that allows developers to create apps for specific operating systems, track analytics and monetize their apps through Facebook\u2019s advertising network. Privacy International found that Maya and MIA began sharing data with Facebook as soon as a user installed the app on her phone and opened it, even before a privacy policy was signed.\n\n[Code words and fake names: The low-tech ways women protect their privacy on pregnancy apps]\n\nFacebook spokesman Joe Osborne said advertisers did not have access to the sensitive health information shared by these apps. In a statement, he said Facebook\u2019s ad system \u201cdoes not leverage information gleaned from people\u2019s activity across other apps or websites\u201d when advertisers choose target users by interest. BuzzFeed first reported the news.\n\nPeriod- and pregnancy-tracking apps such as Maya and MIA have climbed in popularity as fun, friendly companions that provide insights into the often daunting world of fertility and pregnancy. They can also be used to track sexual health more generally, moods and other intimate data. But many apps aren\u2019t subject to the same rules as most health data.\n\nThat has raised privacy concerns as some of the apps have come under scrutiny as powerful monitoring tools for employers and health insurers, which have aggressively pushed to gather more data about their workers\u2019 lives than ever before under the banner of corporate wellness. Plus, it appears the data could be shared more broadly than many users recognize, as flagged by the Privacy International study.\n\n[Is your pregnancy app sharing your intimate data with your boss?]\n\nSeveral period- and pregnancy-tracking apps have been called out for sharing health data with women\u2019s employers and insurance companies, as well as for security flaws that reveal intimate information. As a result, many women say they\u2019ve devised strategies to use the apps without revealing all of their most sensitive information. Among those strategies: using fake names, documenting only scattered details and even inputting incorrect data.\n\nUsers and experts alike worry that the data could be exposed in security breaches, or used by employers and insurance companies to discriminate against women by increasing their premiums or not offering them leadership positions.\n\nDeborah C. Peel, a psychiatrist and founder of the nonprofit Patient Privacy Rights, said people expect that their health data will be protected by the same laws that protect their health information in a doctors office, but that many apps aren\u2019t subject to the same rules.\n\n\u201cMost people would want to make their own decisions about what\u2019s known about their sex life, about whether it\u2019s shared or not,\u201d said Peel. \u201cRight now we have no ability to do that.\u201d\n\n[Facebook wants to find you a soul mate. Will users trust the company with their secrets?]\n\nFacebook, the world\u2019s largest social media platform with 1.2 billion daily users, is asking users to trust it with more and more sensitive information than at any time in the past. Last week, the company launched Facebook Dating in the United States, a matchmaking service that suggests potential love interests to users based on preferences, interests and Facebook activity.\n\nAt the same time, Facebook has come under fire in recent years for multiple scandals involving misinformation, fake accounts and breaches of trust. That includes the 2018 revelation from a whistleblower that Facebook had allowed political consultancy firm Cambridge Analytica to improperly access data from millions of users. In that case, the data was harvested through a third-party quiz app.\n\nIn a Facebook statement included in the report, the company said its terms of service prohibit app developers from sharing health or sensitive data, and that it has been in contact with Maya and MIA to notify them of a possible violation of those terms. Facebook also said that while it has systems in place to automatically detect and delete information like Social Security numbers and passwords from the information shared by apps, the company is \u201clooking at ways to improve our system/products to detect and filter out more types of potentially sensitive data.\u201d\n\nPlackal Tech, which developed Maya, said in its statement to Privacy International that it would remove the Facebook Software Development Kit from a new version of its service. There was no published response from Mobapp Development, the company behind MIA, and the company did not have an immediate comment.", "description": "A new report found that some period-tracking apps shared intimate information with Facebook.
