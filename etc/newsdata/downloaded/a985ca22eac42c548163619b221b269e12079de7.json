Elizabeth Warren\u2019s campaign has yet another program and another slogan \u2014 this time, she wants to ban fracking, the still-new technology in oil and gas drilling. Fracking produced the most energy-independent U.S. in modern history, cut inflation, boosted workers\u2019 real incomes \u2014 and vastly reduced the most obvious cause of climate change, electrical utility emissions.\n\nOther than that, banning it is brilliant!.\n\nThe cause, of course, is preventing climate change, which mostly comes from burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas. It\u2019s true that the day when fracking will be obsolete is coming into focus: Wind power is now cheaper for new utility plants than building gas-powered plants, according to the Rocky Mountain Institute, whose leaders did an excellent piece that ran on MarketWatch last week. And electric cars are coming soon in numbers that will drive gasoline demand far lower.\n\nBut they aren\u2019t here yet. And the costs of a rapid, bumpy transition would be too high \u2014 in jobs, corporate profits and household budgets. But mostly in terms of the fact that there is no alternative available yet that can instantly run everything that fracked oil and gas power do now.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. has gone from producing 5 million barrels per day of crude oil to 12 mbpd on the back of hydraulic fracturing,\u201d Moody\u2019s Analytics energy economist Chris Lafakis says. \u201cU.S. crude oil production would nosedive over a two-year period. This would cause a sharp escalation in oil prices at a time when the global economy is struggling to grow.\u201d\n\nAbout two-thirds of U.S. oil and gas is produced by fracking. It\u2019s responsible for all of the increase in U.S. production since 2008, which has helped shave almost $100 off the cost of a barrel of oil CL00, -0.06% and $1.50 per gallon of gasoline. Cheap natural gas also helped utilities double the share of power made with hydro, wind and solar technologies to 18% without raising rates. The gas power offset more expensive renewables even before costs to build wind and solar plants fell more recently.\n\nRead: Companies are too slow with shift to carbon neutral, say investors with $35 trillion at stake\n\nNatural gas used to make electricity has half the carbon of coal \u2014 so both gas and renewables, for now, contain carbon emissions by replacing coal-fired juice. By 2050, renewables will replace most gas and nearly eliminate emissions in electricity-making, forward-looking utilities like Xcel Energy say, and can cut emissions 80% by 2030.\n\nUtilities have already cut U.S. carbon utility emissions 27% since 2005, according to the Edison Electric Institute, a trade association, in line with goals in the Paris climate accord. A long list of utilities say like Southern Co. SO, +0.53%, Duke Energy DUK, +1.39% and DTE Energy DTE, +0.57% they can cut carbon to half of 2005 levels by 2030.\n\nRead: This German utility \u2014 the EU\u2019s largest emitter \u2014 has a 2040 pledge to be carbon neutral\n\nCoal\u2019s share of electricity has fallen to the low 20s from 50%. As long as that\u2019s above zero, both gas and renewable electricity can reduce carbon.\n\nBut it took a decade to build enough wind plants to boost wind\u2019s share of electricity to 8% from 2%. To shut natural gas plants entirely, as a fracking ban implies, you\u2019d need at least a decade to build enough capacity to absorb gas\u2019s 35% of electricity demand, let alone coal\u2019s rump share.\n\nCars are even farther from a solution.\n\nThe most optimistic experts think electric vehicles will be cheaper than internal combustion engine-powered versions by the mid-2020s, as hundreds of new models hit the market. (Until then, tax credits can make up some of the difference, but they are expiring for EV pioneers like Tesla TSLA, -0.83% and General Motors GM, -0.24% ).\n\nRead: This could be the next gold mine for Tesla and other electric vehicles\n\nThen, since cars stay on the road for about a decade, and not everyone will buy EVs immediately, there will be a 20-year period where an appreciable (but steadily diminishing) number of cars need oil.\n\nThose two sources \u2014 electricity and transportation \u2014 account for most U.S. carbon emissions. And we can\u2019t go cold turkey on either one of them.\n\nThere\u2019s also the matter of replacing the 159,000 jobs in oil and gas that were added between 2008 and 2016. But those jobs are at risk anyway. Take it from an old newspaper reporter: When the new thing (in my case, Google GOOG, +1.28% GOOGL, +1.21% advertising; for gas drillers like Exxon Mobil XOM, +0.25% or Chevron CHV, -0.50%, wind power) becomes a better economic mousetrap, no politician is saving your job.\n\nThe better way \u2014 politically and substantively \u2014 is for a president taking office in 2021 to plan for about a 10-year transition,.\n\nThis means keeping tax subsidies that have already helped push the effective cost of renewable power and electric vehicles lower, but are slated to phase out. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, for example, has proposed boosting the $7,500-or-less tax credit for EVs to $10,000, making a cheaper EV like Nissan\u2019s Leaf positively thrifty. Get people to buy EVs faster and you\u2019ve made a big move.\n\nSubsidies for new wind and solar electricity should be extended, too, even expanded. Closing every last coal plant should be a national goal \u2014 we can find other work for the 11,000 remaining coal miners.\n\nA fast fracking ban would bring coal plants back, at least for a while. We\u2019d buy more oil on world markets, empowering Saudi Arabia and its odious Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman. We may even tolerate more guff from Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin. The late Sen. John McCain taught us the difference between running a gas station, as Putin does, and running the superpower he thinks he does \u2014 there\u2019s no point in making Putin correct.\n\nBy 2030 or 2035, natural gas should be obsolete for power production as wind plants get built. By 2035 to 2040, a cash-for-clunkers-like program can clear old gasoline-powered vehicles from roads. Clean electricity will assume most of the role gas plays in powering vehicles and heating homes now, assuming we upgrade electric grids.\n\nThat\u2019s the way out \u2014 and with small enough lifestyle disruptions that America will buy it.", "description": "Aside from the jobs, it\u2019s the utility rates, the price of gas \u2014 and Mohammad bin Salman.", "authors": ["Tim Mullaney"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HH231_frack__ZG_20190409111345.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
