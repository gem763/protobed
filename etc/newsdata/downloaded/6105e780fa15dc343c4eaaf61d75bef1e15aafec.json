If this can't give any club a lift to compete, nothing will.'\n\nJones had double reason to celebrate when he was given the news that he had been named as part of the Great Britain squad to tour New Zealand and Papua New Guinea, before heading up the aisle.\n\nHe had planned to leave his mobile with a team-mate in the congregation to answer, but as things transpired the GB call came through before the ceremony.\n\nSalford were beaten 23-6 by St Helens but earned plenty of praise for getting to the final\n\n'The wedding was supposed to be last weekend but I said I thought we were going to get to the Grand Final so we put it back,' he explained.\n\nAlthough Jones will be at Hull next season, he is hopeful his ex-employers can progress under highly-rated coach Ian Watson.\n\nVictorious Saints prop Alex Walmsley, 29, said: 'This has been five years in the making. We'd lost in every semi-final before this year. At 21 I was playing on Saturdays in front of 200 people for Dewsbury Celtic in a farmer's field.'", "description": "MIKE KEEGAN AT OLD TRAFFORD: Salford Red Devils' incredible run to the Grand Final may have ended in defeat but it can inspire others and breathe life into Super League, believes Josh Jones.", "authors": ["Mike Keegan For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/20/19663198-0-image-a-11_1570993429463.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
