To date, BoxGroup has been internally backed, meaning that the cash came from none other than the three partners at the firm, David Tisch, Adam Rothenberg and Nimi Katragadda. BoxGroup has primarily written smaller checks, usually between $250K and $500K, for early-stage startups.\n\nThe new fund is actually two separate funds: a regular seed fund and an Opportunity fund, each managing $82.5 million in capital. Limited partners in BoxGroup IV include Willoughby Capital, TrueBridge and founders from BoxGroup\u2019s portfolio, TJ Parker (PillPack), Jeff Raider (Harry\u2019s) and Nat Turner (Flatiron Health).\n\nThat said, not much should change at BoxGroup. The firm will still be writing $250K to $500K checks for pre-seed, seed and early Series A companies as a participant, not a lead.\n\n\u201cThe most important part of our message with this is that we\u2019re not changing,\u201d said Tisch. \u201cIn an industry where everyone is regularly changing, we believe it\u2019s important to stay true to what we do, which is write collaborative seed checks.\u201d\n\nBoxGroup doesn\u2019t take board seats or \u201cownership\u201d over the companies in which it invests, but rather participates in seed rounds across a wide variety of verticals, including health, biotech and food among the usual suspects like SaaS products, marketplaces and e-commerce.\n\nThe portfolio thus far includes names like Warby Parker, Airtable, Flexport, Roman and RigUp, which recently raised $300 million led by Andreessen Horowitz. The firm also takes a shine to New York-based companies, including Bowery Farms, ClassPass, Glossier, Chief, Mirror and David Chang\u2019s Ando.\n\nBoxGroup has also had three separate (nearly) billion-dollar exits: Flatiron Health, which sold to Roche for $2.1 billion, Harry\u2019s, which sold for $1.37 billion to Edgewell Personal Care and PillPack, which sold to Amazon for just shy of a billion.\n\nSo why raise outside capital after 10 years of internal backing?\n\n\u201cThis is the right evolution for our fund,\u201d said Tisch. \u201cIt takes about 10 years to get returns and results in this business and we\u2019re about 10 years old. We feel very good about what we\u2019re doing. We have the confidence and track record now to justify asking other people to take risks on us and our model.\u201d\n\nTisch added that this external money will allow BoxGroup to better support its portfolio of early-stage companies with follow-on investments.", "description": "BoxGroup, the seed-stage investment firm led by David Tisch, has today announced that it has raised its very first fund from limited partners.
