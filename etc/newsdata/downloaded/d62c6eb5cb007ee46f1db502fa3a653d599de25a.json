His family describe him as a doting father. He is trying his hardest to change and would never do anything like this again.\"\n\nJudge Thackray said the violence was \"a drunken rampage.\"\n\nHe added: \"You will use and brandish weapons and if they are not to hand you use your teeth.\"\n\nMr Thackray said he had imposed an extended sentence because of the danger he posed to the public.\n\nHe jailed Furnell for six years and eight months and added an extended term of four years.\n\nFurnell will have an extended period on licence from prison of four years.\n\nSpeaking after the sentencing Detective Sergeant Tom Kelly of Humberside Police said: \u201cThese appalling unprovoked assaults were inflicted upon two innocent people just going about their own business.\n\n\u201cFurnell\u2019s victims suffered some very serious injuries. A man suffered from a bite wound to his neck which removed a large chunk of his skin, leaving him scarred for life and worried about going out for fear of people staring at him. He is also having to undergo further treatment for his injury.\n\n\u201cThe woman victim was head-butted in the assault and says the assault has changed her. She was confident, bubbly and outgoing before this horrendous attack.\n\n\"It is awful now that this man has taken her confidence away and she has said the memories of that night will stay with her for the rest of her life.\n\n\"Not only have both victims suffered physical injuries, but long lasting psychological damage as well.\n\n\"The officers weren't physically injured, however in all cases like this we do not accept or tolerate verbal or physical attacks on any of our officers during the course of their duties. Their primary focus overall is to keep people safe, and not expect to be treated in this way.\n\n\"This investigation was conducted by officers in Grimsby CID and was very much a team effort, working hard with determination to secure this conviction for the victims in this case.\n\n\u201cI want to thank all the officers involved in this for their continued hard work. The sentence reflects the seriousness of this offending by this individual.\n\n\"I hope this now gives a sense of justice to the victims following what they suffered that evening and beyond.\u201d", "description": "Jamie Furnell, 28, from Grimsby, was branded a danger to the public and was jailed for 10 years and eight months", "authors": ["Peter Craig", "Chiara Fiorillo", "Image", "Grimstelegraph", "Men Media", "Rick Byrne", "Grimsbylive"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20537831.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS195346294.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
