A special congressional election was ordered after last year\u2019s voting was tainted by fraud.\n\nBoth Trump and Vice President Mike Pence flew to North Carolina on Monday for last-minute campaigning with Bishop, a 55-year-old state senator who has embraced Trump\u2019s policies and politics.\n\n\u201cYou have a Democrat named Dan McCready, and he wants open borders, he wants sanctuary cities, he\u2019s not going to protect your Second Amendment,\u201d Trump told the cheering crowd at a rally in Fayetteville, referring to the constitutional right to bear arms.\n\nThere were signs the race was close on Tuesday evening as local Republicans sought an extension of voting hours in one precinct in Union County, a suburban Charlotte county that some analysts say could be a battleground in the race. Republicans said the voting station had been moved and that one in five voters was showing up at the wrong location.\n\nThe State Board of Elections met to hear the request, but took no action on it. With little time left, McCready encouraged voters to still head for the polls.\n\n\u201cBe in line to vote by 7:30 p.m. (0030 GMT Wednesday) and election officials must let you vote,\u201d the Democratic candidate wrote. \u201cPlease stay in line. This is going to come down to hundreds of votes.\u201d\n\nA Republican victory would help the party launch a comeback effort to wrest the House of Representatives away from Democrats after losing 40 seats and overall control in House elections last year.\n\nDan Bishop, Republican candidate in the special election for North Carolina's 9th Congressional District, speaks to the media at an election day campaign stop, in Indian Trail, North Carolina, U.S., September 10, 2019. REUTERS/Jonathan Drake\n\nA Democratic win would send hopes soaring that 2018 was not necessarily their high-water mark as they aim to lure more voters away from Trump and his fellow Republicans in 2020 elections to Congress and the White House.\n\nThe North Carolina contest is the second most expensive special election for a House seat in U.S. history, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which said candidates and outside groups had spent more than $18 million to fill the airwaves with ads.\n\nOnly a 2017 race in Georgia cost more, when Republican Karen Handel beat Democrat Jon Ossoff in a $27 million blitz.\n\nCLOSELY FOUGHT\n\nNorth Carolina\u2019s 9th District was already getting more competitive in 2018, when McCready lost narrowly before state officials ruled the election was tainted by an absentee-ballot fraud scheme that benefited his then-opponent, Republican Mark Harris. A new election was ordered, and Harris declined to run again.\n\nRepublicans nominated Bishop, who has campaigned on taxes, the economy and immigration. He has echoed Trump\u2019s political themes, asserting that McCready \u201cadmires socialism\u201d and linking him to the \u201cSquad,\u201d a group of progressive Democrats in the House who Trump has repeatedly attacked.\n\n\u201cI share your values. I\u2019m not ashamed of your values,\u201d Bishop told attendees at the rally with Trump on Monday. \u201cI\u2019m going to defend your values in Washington D.C.\u201d\n\nMcCready, a 36-year-old small-businessman and U.S. Marine Corps veteran, has sought to steer the campaign discussion away from Trump and onto issues such as healthcare, education and teacher pay.\n\nMcCready met with fellow veterans in Fayetteville hours before Trump\u2019s speech and talked about how Americans were getting \u201ccrushed\u201d by healthcare costs.\n\nSlideshow (19 Images)\n\nHe has labeled Bishop, who sponsored a 2016 measure in the state legislature restricting public restroom access for transgender people, as a \u201ccareer politician.\u201d\n\nA wave of recent Republican retirements from the House has fueled speculation that Republicans fear they will not win back the majority in that chamber next year. They will need to gain 19 seats to regain the majority, or 20 if they lose North Carolina\u2019s 9th District on Tuesday.\n\nRepublicans are expected to keep the seat in another special election on Tuesday in the state\u2019s 3rd District. Republican Greg Murphy and Democrat Allen Thomas are vying for a seat left vacant by longtime Republican Representative Walter Jones\u2019 death in February.", "description": "One of the most expensive special elections for the U.S. Congress was taking place on Tuesday in North Carolina, with both major parties watching to see whether President Donald Trump's Republican Party can keep its grip on a long-held seat.", "authors": ["Susan Cornwell", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428443911&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8922Q", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
