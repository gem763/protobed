The pair had been planning a trip across China together, but weren\u2019t able to take it.\n\nOne day, Yi finds a yeti on the roof of her flat and, together with Peng, her basketball-obsessed neighbour, and his cousin Jin, who cares more about his image and taking the best selfie, they embark on a quest to return the creature to his home on Mount Everest.\n\nVideo of ABOMINABLE All Movie Clips + Trailer (2019)\n\nThe animation is gorgeous; there\u2019s one scene in particular, where Yi plays her violin on a cliffside and flowers grow around her as she plays, that\u2019s particularly breathtaking. You also you get to see some beautiful Chinese scenery, including the Yangtze River and the Gobi desert.\n\nFurthermore, the film touches beautifully on a particularly difficult topic for an animated film to cover: how grief affects a child. We see this in the way that Yi cherishes her father\u2019s violin, and is unable to connect with her family because it no longer feels whole.\n\nIt\u2019s also cool to see many elements of Chinese culture on screen, from Yi\u2019s grandmother\u2019s char siu bao, to the bamboo scaffolding on the side of her building. Abominable is definitely a worthwhile watch \u2013 but you might want to bring some tissues.", "description": "Chloe Bennet stars as a young girl who travels across China to reunite a magical yeti with his family on Mount Everest.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/dcddac20-e8e0-11e9-9e8e-4022fb9638c4imagehires170121.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
