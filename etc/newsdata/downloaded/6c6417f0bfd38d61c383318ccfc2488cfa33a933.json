But am I affected personally? Sure. Of course ... I\u2019ve become the punchline of a joke a little bit more than normal.\u2019 Monica Lewinksy\n\nAs Monica Lewinsky revealed her new cyberbullying PSA video on the \u201cToday\u201d show on Wednesday, she also discussed her own experiences being harassed, shamed and ridiculed since 1998. That\u2019s when her sexual relationship with President Clinton while she was a 22-year-old intern in the mid-90s came to light, leading to his impeachment.\n\nAnd a lot of that personal trauma is being stirred up again in light of the Trump impeachment inquiry, she said, as people compare the current political turmoil to when Clinton was impeached.\n\nRelated: Monica Lewinsky \u2018wins the internet\u2019 with fierce 3-word take on Mueller\u2019s report\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ve found myself the last few weeks \u2014 I\u2019m certainly more sensitive. Some people in my world might say \u2018cranky,\u2019\u201d said Lewinsky, now 46. \u201cI\u2019ve needed more self-care.\u201d\n\nShe said something similar to People, admitting that, \u201cI\u2019ve been a little more on edge,\u201d but also telling the magazine that impeachment is \u201cbigger than anyone one person.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, this is hard for me, but I don\u2019t want to give anyone the impression that in the scheme of things I think that matters ... It\u2019s far bigger and greater than me,\u201d she said.\n\n\"Impeachment is a constitutional crisis, it's much bigger than me. But am I affected personally? Sure.

Lewinsky has become an antibullying advocate and public speaker, pushing for a safer social-media environment in particular. And her new, interactive \u201cThe Epidemic\u201d PSA is her latest campaign against online bullying.\n\nIt begins with a trigger warning that some content and imagery could be upsetting to some viewers. And it depicts a \u201cmysterious virus sweeping the country\u201d through the eyes of a teen girl named Hailey, who struggles to eat and sleep, throws up and stays home sick from school. It climaxes as she reaches for a bottle of pills, and gets rushed to the emergency room.\n\nViewers are then told to visit the-epidemic.com/realstory and enter their phone number. They are then sent a link to watch an extended version of the video \u2014 but this time, the viewer receives a flurry of slut-shaming and bullying text messages that Hailey had been getting throughout the story. This puts her physical and emotional suffering into greater context. And extended scenes show her attempting to overdose on the pills, and her mother rushing her to the hospital.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly devastating and powerful,\u201d said Lewinsky on \u201cToday.\u201d She created the video with the BBDO New York ad agency and her PR firm, Dini von Mueffling Communications.\n\n\u201cThe bullying crisis has become a global epidemic. It can be hard to see the signs of when someone\u2019s going through this,\u201d she added. \u201cEven though [cyberbullying] takes place online, there are offline consequences, and these consequences can range from bad to grave.\u201d\n\nWatch the PSA below.\n\nstop scrolling and watch this film about a devastating epidemic that\u2019s going unnoticed. #TheEpidemic #HardToSee [Trigger Warning.
