(Picture: David Fisher/BAFTA/REX)\n\nIt\u2019s the news all Fleabag fans have been waiting for \u2013 TV\u2019s hottest priest Andrew Scott has revealed he\u2019s teaming up with fellow star Phoebe Waller-Bridge once again.\n\nThe man who became an unlikely sex god overnight told ES Magazine the exciting news as well as discussing his role in Fleabag, how he found acting and his love-hate relationship with Ireland and Catholicism.\n\nThe star didn\u2019t give too much away about when he and Phoebe will be reuniting but he did reveal they have \u2018exciting plans\u2019.\n\nHe said: \u2018We have plans to work together. She\u2019s a total delight. I love her. We\u2019ve got exciting plans afoot.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAndrew, who rose to fame playing villain Moriarty opposite Benedict Cumberbatch\u2019s detective in Sherlock, said not only does he feel proud of Fleabag but America\u2019s response to the series has been \u2018incredible\u2019.\n\nHe added: \u2018It wasn\u2019t just a storyline for shock value.\n\n\u2018To see a priest who is a human being is important. To fall in love with somebody but to be married to the church \u2014 that\u2019s a really interesting dilemma. I think more people of our generation would enter the church if they could have a love as well as a spiritual life.\u2019\n\nA Fleabag reunion is incoming (Picture: BBC/Getty)\n\nOn America\u2019s response to Fleabag he said: \u2018It was absolutely incredible, completely joyful. This is a six-part BBC3 show and you\u2019re there with these monsters of American television. Phoebe said to me, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to come to America because you see how much they really responded to the show.\u201d And they really have. It was brilliant.\u2019\n\nNot only was the show a hit in American, but Fleabag also completely wiped the floor at this year\u2019s 71st Primetime Emmys, picking up four gongs at the ceremony.\n\nThe hit BBC series took home the accolade for Best Comedy Series, with Phoebe winning Lead Actress in a Comedy Series and Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series, and Harry Bradbeer being named Outstanding Director for a Comedy series.\n\nAndrew Scott is proud of his role in Fleabag and loves the feedbag from American fans\n\n(Picture: ES Magazine)\n\nDespite the exciting news of a reunion, Fleabag fans may have to wait for the next series as Phoebe admitted that she has no plans of reprising the role before she turns 50.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough Andrew has revealed that he\u2019ll gladly come back to the show, no matter how long the wait is.\n\nSpeaking to Digital Spy about the thought of rejoining the show in over a decade, the 42-year-old actor joked: \u2018Oh, I\u2019ll probably be dead.\u2019\n\nHowever, he continued: \u2018But if I\u2019m still alive, yeah. Listen, I\u2019ll be there, whatever she wants me to do.\n\n\u2018I love the fact that that story was completely self-contained and beautiful,\n\n\u2018I think sometimes when something is a success, you just want to elongate it for the wrong reasons.\u2019\n\nFleabag is available to stream on BBC iPlayer.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
