Critics have long decried the agreement, saying American taxpayer dollars should not help fund Israel\u2019s occupation of the West Bank or its blockade of the Gaza Strip.\n\nSanders has floated the idea of leveraging aid to Israel in the past, saying in July that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Benjamin (Bibi) NetanyahuMORE leads \u201can extreme right-wing government with many racist tendencies\u201d in reference to Israeli policies in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.\n\nSanders told advocates on Monday that some of the military assistance to Israel should instead be allocated to the Gaza Strip in the form of humanitarian aid.\n\n\u201cIf you want military aid, you\u2019re going to have to fundamentally change your relationship with the people of Gaza,\" he said. \"In fact, I think it is fair to think that some of that $3.8 billion should go to humanitarian aid to Gaza.\u201d\n\nSanders went further in his willingness to place conditions on aid than four other 2020 Democratic contenders who spoke at the J Street conference over the past two days.\n\nSouth Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg Peter (Pete) Paul ButtigiegBiden: 'I know I'm the frontrunner' in 2020 race 2020 Democrats set sights on corporate tax hike 2020 Democrats commend US forces on ISIS leader's death MORE and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro expressed openness to conditioning aid so that U.S. assets would not be used for building or annexing West Bank settlements, while Sens.
