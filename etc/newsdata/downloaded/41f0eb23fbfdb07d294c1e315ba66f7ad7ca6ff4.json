She took responsibility almost immediately. She was contrite. Did not try to minimize her conduct,' said Lelling.\n\n'I think she handled it in a classy way. And so, at the end of the day, we thought the one-month was proportional. It think the two weeks she got was proportional. We're happy with that.'\n\nHe then added: 'I think it was a thoughtful sentence.'\n\nLelling was singing a different tune however when talk turned to the other high-profile defendant in the case.\n\nThe US Attorney's Office will be going to trial with Loughlin and her husband, two of the 19 defendants who have chosen to fight the charges against them at trial.\n\nLawyers for those individuals are due in court next for a status conference in January.\n\n'If she is convicted, we would probably ask for a higher sentence for her than we did for Felicity Huffman,' Lelling said of Loughlin.\n\n'I can't tell you what that would be. The longer the case goes, let's say she goes through to trial. If it is after trial, we would ask for something substantially higher. If she resolved it before trial, something lower than that.'\n\nHuffman, 56, addressed the court at her sentencing last month, saying: 'I have inflicted more damage than I could\u2019ve ever imagined.'\n\nShe then admitted her guilt once more and told the judge her actions were 'frightened, stupid and so wrong,' and added that she deserved whatever sentence was handed down.\n\nRight off the bat, the prosecution commented on Huffman's claim that it was her 'parental anxiety' that led her to bribe an official in order to guarantee her daughter a better SAT test score.\n\n'With all due respect to the defendant, welcome to parenthood,' said Assistant US Attorney Eric Rosen.\n\n'There's no instruction manual. Parenthood is exhausting and stressful, but that's what every parent goes through.'\n\nHe later noted: 'Parenthood does not make you a felon or make you cheat. It makes you serve as a positive role model.'\n\nHuffman was ordered to self-report to a facility determined by the Bureau of Prisons on October 25 by Judge Indira Talwani, who shared with the court how she arrived at her ruling after hearing from prosecutors, the defense and Huffman.\n\n'The outrage in this case is a system that is already so distorted by money and privilege in the first place,' noted Judge Indira Talwani.\n\n'And that in a system in that context, that you took the step of having one more advantage to put your child ahead.'\n\nWhen you're lost out there and you're all alone: Loughlin and her husband Mossimo Giannulli (above in August) are two of the 19 parents fighting the charges against them in the Operation Varsity Blues scandal at trial\n\nClass act: In the same interview, Lelling praised Felicity Huffman (above with William H Macy last month at her sentencing) while also stressing why it was important she went to prison\n\nLoughlin is facing a different charge than Huffman, but made donations totaling $500,000 as opposed to the $15,000 that the Desperate Housewives star paid to have a proctor edit her daughter's standardized aptitude test.\n\nLoughlin and her husband are now facing 40 years in prison and over one-million dollars in fines for allegedly bribing officials in a bid to get their daughters into the University of Southern California.\n\nOne day after 13 parents entered guilty pleas for their roles in the Operation Varsity Blues scandal, the 19 who did not admit guilt were hit with an additional charge of money laundering in addition to mail fraud.\n\nPARENTS CHARGED IN OPERATION VARSITY BLUES William Rick Singer, the 'mastermind' Rudolph Meredith Mark Riddell John Vandemoer Igor Dvorskiy Gordon Ernst William Ferguson Martin Fox Donna Heinel Laura Janke Ali Khosroshahin Steven Masera Jorge Salcedo Mikaela Sanford David Sidoo Jovan Vavic Niki Williams Gregory and Marcia Abbott Gamal Abdelaziz Diane and Todd Blake Jane Buckingham Gordon Caplan Michael Center I-Hsin \"Joey\" Chen Amy and Gregory Colburn Robert Flaxman Lori Loughlan and Mossimo Giannulli Elizabeth and Manuel Henriquez Douglas Hodge Felicity Huffman Agustin Huneeus Bruce and Davina Isackson Michelle Janavs Elisabeth Kimmel Marjorie Klapper Toby MacFarlane Bill McGlashan Marci Palatella Peter Jan Sartorio Stephen Semprevivo Devin Sloane John Wilson Houmayoun Zadeg Robert Zangrillo\n\nAmong those named are William McGlashan, Manuel and Elizabeth Henriquez, and Loughlin and husband Mossimo Giannulli.\n\n'The charge of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and honest services mail and wire fraud provides for a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release, and a fine of $250,000 or twice the gross gain or loss, whichever is greater,' said a release from the US Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts.\n\n'The charge of conspiracy to commit money laundering provides for a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release, and a fine of $500,000 or twice the value of the property involved in the money laundering. Sentences are imposed by a federal district court judge based upon the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.'\n\nLoughlin and Giannulli 'agreed to pay bribes totaling $500,000 in exchange for having their two daughters designated as recruits to the USC crew team - despite the fact that they did not participate in crew - thereby facilitating their admission to USC,' according to the documents.\n\nThe couple emailed mastermind William Rick Singer in 2016 about their daughters college prospects, stating that they wanted to do the necessary work to see that the girls got into USC as opposed to ASU.\n\nEmails obtained by investigators revealed that it was soon decided that bribes would be paid to have the girls recruited as crew coxswains.\n\nA short time after that, photos were taken of older daughter Isabella on an ergometer.\n\nDr. Donna Heinel, the senior associate athletic director at USC, presented Isabella as a potential athletic recruit a month later and she was approved for conditional admission.\n\nIt was then asked that a check be sent to Heinle for $50,000 from Giannulli, who a short time later asked if he could mention the story to the athletic director at USC when the two men were at Augusta, likely playing at the famed golf club.\n\nSinger stated that this was not a good idea because when he discussed the possibility of Isabella's admission with him a year he thought the family 'would be good for a million plus.'\n\nIsabella received her admission letter the following March, which was followed by another note requesting a donation of $200,000 to Key Worldwide Foundation.\n\nAfter the amount was wired to the organization a note was returned that stated no good or services had been exchanged for the money, which according to the documents is false.\n\nThis same exact process was then repeated with the young daughter, Olivia, it is claimed.\n\nProblems arose however when Olivia's guidance counselor became curious as to how she managed to receive admission based on her involvement in crew since she did not row.\n\nAt the same time, Loughlin complained that her daughter was having difficulty filling out her other college applications, prompting Singer to ask an employee to take care of that task.\n\nThis was done so as not to draw attention to the fact that it was already confirmed that she had received conditional admission to the school.", "description": "The prosecutor in the Operation Varsity Blues case praised Felicity Huffman and sent out a warning to Lori Loughlin in a rare interview over the weekend with an ABC affiliate.", "authors": ["Chris Spargo For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/21/19412202-0-image-a-32_1570479881740.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
