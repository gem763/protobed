In brief \u2013 the government seems open to a 10 or 11 December date, but is dead set against amendments extending the vote to 16- and 17-year-olds or EU nationals.\n\nOn the date, while the Lib Dem hope for a 9 December poll, Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesman said this would require parliament to dissolve at the start of Friday this week, so as to allow the necessary 25 working days between dissolution and polling.\n\nThis would make it \u201cvery difficult\u201d for both the election bill and a separate bill on budgets for the suspended Northern Ireland assembly to pass through the Commons and Lords and receive royal assent in time, the spokesman said.\n\nAlso, 9 December is a Monday, meaning election preparations would take place of the preceding weekend, which would be logistically difficult and costly, he added.\n\nHowever, it seems the government could compromise on 10 or 11 December.\n\nIn contrast, there seems no possibility of compromise on adding younger voters or EU nationals, with Johnson\u2019s spokesman saying that longstanding convention dictates that changes to the franchise only happen after extensive consultation. He said:\n\nThe election law on the franchise should not be changed days before the calling of a general election. The Electoral Commission warns against changing electoral laws less than six months before an election.\n\nAdding 16- and 17-year-olds would be \u201cadministratively impossible to deliver in the time available\u201d, he said, warning also that adding EU nationals would bring \u201cadministrative chaos\u201d.\n\nThe latter point seems less certain given that EU nationals can already vote in local elections, and so many are registered.\n\nBut the No 10 spokesman added: \u201cIt would also mean EU nationals in the UK enjoying wider voting rights than UK nationals in any other country other than Ireland.\u201d", "description": "Rolling coverage of the day\u2019s political developments, as MPs debate the government bill for an early election", "authors": ["Andrew Sparrow", "Peter Walker", "Polly Toynbee", "John Crace"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae498d436725f5bb1bfc82eb52ba8f6182c288d6/0_132_3937_2362/master/3937.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctbGl2ZS5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b3ba3a6ca5bd6dc0ade40a7cc5a03724", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
