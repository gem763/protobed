REUTERS/Brian Snyder/File Photo\n\nGregory and Marcia Abbott received lighter sentences than the eight-month terms sought by federal prosecutors in Boston after they admitted to paying $125,000 to have a corrupt test proctor secretly correct their daughter\u2019s answers on college entrance exams.\n\nThe couple\u2019s sentence by U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani also includes a requirement that they each pay a $45,000 fine. They previously pleaded guilty in May to conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud.\n\nLawyers for the Abbotts did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Abbotts are among 52 people charged with participating in a vast scheme in which wealthy parents conspired with a California college admissions consultant to use bribery and other forms of fraud to secure the admission of their children to top schools.\n\nWilliam \u201cRick\u201d Singer, the consultant, pleaded guilty in March to charges that he facilitated cheating on college entrance exams and helped bribe sports coaches at universities to present his clients\u2019 children as fake athletic recruits.\n\nThe 35 parents charged in the investigation include executives and celebrities, such as \u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d star Felicity Huffman and \u201cFull House\u201d actress Lori Loughlin.\n\nHuffman was sentenced to 14 days in prison on Sept. 13 after pleading guilty to engaging in the college exam cheating scheme. Loughlin has pleaded not guilty.\n\nProsecutors said the Abbotts in 2018 arranged through Singer to have an associate pose as a proctor for their daughter\u2019s ACT and SAT exams to correct her answers at a test center Singer controlled through bribery.\n\nThe proctor was Mark Riddell, a former counselor at a Florida private school who pleaded guilty in April to secretly taking SAT and ACT college entrance exams in place of Singer\u2019s clients\u2019 children or correcting their answers.\n\nProsecutors said the Abbotts\u2019 goal was to improve their daughter\u2019s prospects for gaining admission to Duke University, Marcia Abbott\u2019s alma mater.\n\nIn papers, the Abbotts\u2019 lawyers said they were good people who made an \u201caberrational, terrible decision.\u201d They argued the couple deserved a term of probation.", "description": "The founder of a food and beverage packaging company and his wife were each sentenced to one month in prison on Tuesday for their roles in what prosecutors say is the largest college admissions scam uncovered in the United States.", "authors": ["Nate Raymond", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438578073&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF971QW", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
