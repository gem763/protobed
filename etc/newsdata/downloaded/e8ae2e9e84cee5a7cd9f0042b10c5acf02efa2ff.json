And proof:\n\nLee Gregory doesn't have to ask for permission anymore. Since the former chef of the popular Roosevelt struck out on his own with Alewife last September, Gregory gets to call the shots. That means embracing bluefish, mackerel and skate \u2014 Mid-Atlantic fish in abundant supply and priced to please. The seafood-themed restaurant, which replaces a corner store in Church Hill, takes its name from a species of herring whose shape supposedly reminded American colonists of a plump tavern-keeper's wife.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI\u2019m sold before I step inside, and not just because I\u2019ve lapped up the chef\u2019s cooking on earlier forays to Richmond, where he once worked at the esteemed Acacia and still has a stake in the Southern-accented Southbound. When I call to let Alewife know I\u2019m delayed in traffic, the voice on the other end of the line assures me my reservation is safe. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I\u2019m told. \u201cThe table is yours for the night.\u201d (Imagine hearing that from a Washington hot spot on a weekend.)\n\nTom Sietsema\u2019s favorite places to eat right now\n\nThe physical storefront, whose porthole-shaped mirrors shore up the water theme, is just as sincere. High pressed-tin ceilings, worn wood floors and a busy bar are easy on the eyes, if hard on the ears. Alewife takes its drinks, designed to flatter seafood, seriously. So should you. \u201cScenic Pastures\u201d is one of many pleasures, swirling together tequila, smoky mezcal and a pineapple-oregano shrub.\n\nAlewife\u2019s sustainable catch comes in surprise cuts. Skate chop, anyone? The kite-shaped fish is decked out with pickled pineapple that gives the dish, splayed over a pool of green curry, a sweet-sour lilt. The chef has also been known to serve monkfish rib cages, buttermilk-bathed and fried, the aquatic equivalent of pork ribs. Speaking of turf, Gregory entertains the meat-and-potatoes set with juicy pork tenderloin fanned along a puddle of refried lentils smothered with thinly sliced charred peppers \u2014 everything good to the last mop.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTom Sietsema\u2019s Dining Guide\n\nDessert includes soft-serve ice cream in fun flavor combinations (chocolate-cherry swirled into a spire with banana ice cream on my visit). The cool confection is an easy execution for restaurants, but Gregory also likes how it plays into a sunny boardwalk theme. In addition, there might be moist poundcake served with whatever fruit is at its peak, all but buried under a loose drift of whipped cream.\n\nFrom first sip to last crumb, Gregory\u2019s vision is to drive for.\n\nThe menu simply refers to the appetizer as \"crab.\" But when it's set before me, the plate is so vivid that it prompts a heart emoji. The signature ingredient is concealed under a nori crepe \u2014 an undulating green carpet the color of a golf course after a good rain \u2014 and a violet garnish of bachelor buttons. Dare I disturb the canvas, set off with dollops of onion-and-corn puree? Doing so uncovers a little treasure of sweet jumbo lump crab, pickled onion and corn that sings of summer as it pops in the mouth.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLongoven has me at first bite. Second, third and fourth, too. What began as a Sunday night pop-up at the rustic Sub Rosa Bakery four years ago became a chic, bricks-and-mortar restaurant in trendy Scott\u2019s Addition only last summer. That\u2019s what happens when you look at more than a dozen permanent sites, many prospects fall through and, well, life intervenes. The drawn-out rehearsal seems to have paid off for the principals: co-owners Andrew Manning, a Richmond native, and husband and wife Megan Fitzroy Phelan and Patrick Phelan. (She\u2019s the executive pastry chef; he\u2019s Manning\u2019s co-chef in the open kitchen.) If you have time for a single splurge here right now, this place, the successor to a cinder block paint storage facility, is where you want to book. The restaurant\u2019s name is a reference to community ovens dating to the Civil War, says Manning.\n\nHis crab salad has peers in just about everything else I encountered on the creative a la carte list this summer. (Longoven also offers a six-course, $65 tasting menu.) Foie gras and cream are blended into a ganache, set on crushed hazelnuts and dolloped with a white cloud, fiery with Fever-Tree ginger ale, that lasts little longer than it takes to read this sentence. Frozen grapefruit bits atop the ganache lighten the pleasure. Cured, glazed, grilled pork gets an overlay of housemade kimchi \u2014 like a lot of contemporary chefs, Longoven\u2019s worship at the altar of fermentation \u2014 and acoustics courtesy of puffed fried rice, seasoned with furikake. Duck, lightly smoked over hickory, is served as blushing slices over horseradish cream and beside a red hedge of grilled radicchio and fermented turnips.\n\nThe courses, refined and restrained, seem designed with food critics in mind. Diminutive portions encourage more sampling. I had room, in other words, for what a server playfully described as \u201ca birder\u2019s\u201d risotto. Separately toasted millet, quinoa, chia and sunflower seeds suspended in fontina fondue cross hippie food with Italian.\n\nPatrick Phelan, an Army brat and former musician, met Manning when they both worked at Helen\u2019s, a longtime Southern restaurant in Richmond where the untrained Phelan sometimes had his efforts judged the hard way, with Manning throwing his food in the trash. \u201cThere were definitely lots of do-overs,\u201d says Manning, whose skills are informed in part by 11 years of cooking in Piedmont, Italy. Megan Fitzroy Phelan, a veteran of Manhattan\u2019s esteemed Daniel restaurant and Sullivan Street Bakery, creates desserts, only subtly sweet, that are very much to my taste. Smoked vanilla ice cream is paired with black walnut mousse and finished with a caramel coaxed from miso and fig. Don\u2019t be surprised to find manchego ice cream gracing milk chocolate-hazelnut mousse.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe interior, a mini-series of bar and two dining rooms, channels the spare thinking of Japan and Denmark. A single piece of art graces a rear wall. \u201cWe wanted the food to be the star,\u201d says Phelan, who volunteers that customers either admire or dislike the austerity. (A post on Yelp compared the setting to a hospital. Patients should be so lucky!) Still, the picture window in the rear dining room captures a definite asset: a patio with a menu of its own. Yes, you can get wings here, and half off select wines on Fridays.\n\nThe owners see the alfresco venue as an approachable way for locals in particular to dip their toes (and forks) in Longoven. This devotee considers it another excuse to return to one of the best things to open in Richmond in seasons.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this review referred to the skate chop as a bone-in fish. Skate has cartilage, not bones.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor stories, features such as Date Lab, Gene Weingarten and more, visit WP Magazine.\n\nFollow the Magazine on Twitter.\n\nLike us on Facebook.\n\nEmail us at wpmagazine@washpost.com.\n\nAlewife (Unrated) 3120 E.
