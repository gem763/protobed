WTF Lucifer's daughter is Colombian.'\n\nOther viewers called out the show's participants as 'privileged' and careless.\n\n'This #DoingDrugsForFun programme was good....... hope they run the programme again in 10 years when some of them are bankrupt, lost their families and have got serious mental health issues. Because that's what really happens, in real life,' one wrote.\n\nIn the show, the four Brits traveled around Colombia to meet with cartel members, locals, cocaine farmers and authorities to get a grasp of just how dangerous their party drug habits are to Colombian communities.\n\nChanel went to meet a cartel assassin, who said she'd been forced into a life of crime, which she wouldn't have chosen for herself, but added that it was representative of the 'kill or be killed' reality of cartel life in Colombia.\n\nChanel traveled to a remote part of the Colombia rain forest in order to meet the woman at a cabin owned by the cartel\n\nWhilst they found the show interesting, some viewers felt the four Brits traveling to Colombia were 'privileged'\n\n'I liked getting paid to kill,' she said, as she met with Chanel in a remote cabin, owned by the cartel.\n\n'I love the madness. Not when I was a little girl, but from the age of 15 I've loved seeing things fall down around me,' she added.\n\nWhen Chanel, asked the hit woman when her last hit was, the woman explained she had killed a man eight days prior in very graphic terms.\n\nThe woman, who started working for the cartel as an assassin aged 15, said she liked to be paid to kill\n\nThe hit woman added she had killed pregnant women and her cousin, as otherwise, she would have been killed by her boss\n\n'Eight days ago I killed a guy because he wouldn't kill someone else,' she said.\n\n'We chopped him up, put him in a bag, and threw him in the river and goodbye,' she added. 'Nobody is going to see him again.'\n\nPressed by an increasingly shocked Chanel, the woman admitted to killing her own cousin in order to save her own life, saying the cartel would have had her murdered if she'd refused to do it.\n\nChanel, who seemed really shocked by what she was hearing, asked the woman if there was any rules to the assassin lifesty;e. The woman said there weren't, and added she 'didn't give a s***'\n\nFor the Brit, the interaction was eye-opening, as it showed how much of an impact her party drug had in Colombia\n\nLater on, the woman delved into how ruthless her assassin job could be, saying she killed many men and even pregnant women and didn't 'give a s***.'\n\n'I will carry on until I get killed, until that's it,' she said, 'there's no turning back.'\n\nChanel was in deep thought following her one-to-one with the woman.\n\n'What can you say, really,' she said, 'it's f****** disgusting.'\n\nThe woman said she would be an assassin until she was killed by someone else, in the heavy interview\n\n'If there weren't cartels running the streets of Colombia, people like her wouldn't exist. She would have had a completely different career route.'\n\nIn the documentary, we learned that a crushing majority of the children in Medell\u00edn would be forced into joining the cartels or trafficked for sexual purposes, and many would lose their lives doing so.\n\n18,000 children were recruited by the cartels in the past decade.\n\nThe realisation that their party habits had a direct impact on the lives of many children came as a shock for Chanel, Troi, Louis and Amber.\n\nThe last part of Doing Drugs for Fun airs tonight at 9pm on Channel 5.", "description": "A 39 year old hit woman working for a Colombian drug cartel said she killed pregnant women, chopped a man into pieces and killed her own cousin after starting on the job at 15, and she loves it.", "authors": ["Claire Toureille For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/10/19482922-0-image-a-5_1570612462722.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
