He\u2019s fully in command. And he\u2019s keeping world leaders on edge and unsure of his next moves, all without being hemmed in by aides or the traditional strictures of a White House.\n\nAfter four national security advisers, three chiefs of staff, three directors of oval office operations and five communications directors, the president is now finding the White House finally functions in a way that fits his personality. Trump doubters have largely been ousted, leaving supporters to cheer him on and execute his directives with fewer constraints than ever before.\n\n\u201cIt is a government of one in the same way in which the Trump Organization was a company of one,\u201d said a former senior administration official.\n\nThe transformation of the Trump White House, from its early attempts at a traditional structure to its current freewheeling style, has exacted a heavy toll his staff.\n\n\u201cIn the first year in office, President Trump was new to the job. He was more susceptible to advisers and advice. There were more people urging caution or trying to get him to adhere to processes,\u201d the former senior official added. \u201cNow, there are very few people in the White House who view that as their role, or as something they want to try to do, or who even have a relationship with him.\u201d\n\nThis Presidency of One is now heading into an election year supported by campaign staffers and White House aides who are quick say Trump is the best political strategist as well as the most effective messenger, and they intend to follow his lead wherever 2020 goes.\n\nThe transformation of the Trump White House, from its early attempts at a traditional structure to its current freewheeling style, has exacted a heavy toll his staff. But a steady stream of departures \u2014 the highest senior staff turnover of any recent president by far \u2014 has also left fewer forces trying to bend the president to the usual process of the top ranks of government.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very easy, actually, to work with me. You know why it\u2019s easy? Because I make all the decisions. They don\u2019t have to work,\u201d Trump told reporters last Friday as he explained why being his national security adviser, in his mind, is now a low-key post. Trump fired his third such adviser, John Bolton, last week, and he named a new national security adviser on Wednesday morning by tweet.\n\nActing chief of staff Mick Mulvaney gives the president free rein to \u201cLet Trump Be Trump,\u201d as Mulvaney has said, having seen the fate of his two predecessors, Reince Priebus and John Kelly.\n\nThe dwindling of top senior staff has left the president in the company of his family members, Mulvaney, Kellyanne Conway, Larry Kudlow, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the omnipresent Stephen Miller, who mostly focuses on immigration, current and former senior administration officials say.\n\nIn the past three years, Trump also lost several trusted aides, most of whom played no role in major policy decisions but were frequent presences. Trump trusted them. They could read his moods, and their loss has been felt throughout the building, say current and former White House aides. This includes his former bodyguard Keith Schiller, former body man John McEntee, former Communications Director Hope Hicks and former Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who left the administration in June after morphing into more of a top adviser than a top communications aide.\n\nTo outsiders, it\u2019s felt like watching an increasingly unbound, or unleashed version of the Trump presidency.\n\nBut to many Trump allies, aides and longtime observers, the president is showing the world the way he\u2019s always operated. Only now it has become clearer because he is receiving less pushback from staff and advisers \u2014 and has very few effective checks on his administration from Congress, the national security community or fellow Republicans.\n\n\u201cThe Trump I\u2019m seeing now, to me, is the same Donald Trump who has existed for the 50 of his last 73 years. This is very much in keeping with how he rolled in the business world. The only difference is now he is doing it on the global stage,\u201d said Timothy O\u2019Brien, author of \u201cTrumpNation: The Art of Being the Donald\u201c and executive editor of Bloomberg Opinion.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just turn the economy on and off. These are big, slow-moving machines\" \u2014 White House adviser\n\nThere is little policy process left as the White House faces consequential decisions on Iran, North Korea, China, trade and the economy, even as the president intends to use the last-named as a major selling point for his reelection bid.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just turn the economy on and off. These are big, slow-moving machines. And he\u2019s operating under this major fallacy that he can keep telling the market things, and they will keep believing him on China or whatever else,\u201d said one adviser close to the White House. \u201cAnd that he can just all of a sudden turn things around with a China deal or whatever it is and it doesn\u2019t work that way.\u201d\n\nOne of Trump\u2019s top White House aides disputed the notion of a fractured policy process. \u201cWith every decision he makes, there is a deliberative, coordinated policy process and ultimately the president makes the best decision in the interest of the American people,\u201d said Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary. \u201cNo president has had more success in his first 2\u00bd years than President Donald J. Trump. In spite of 93 percent negative news coverage, this president has built a safer, stronger, and more secure America, including record job gains, economic growth, fair and reciprocal trade, criminal justice reform, energy independence, combatting the opioid epidemic, lowering prescription drug prices, and restoring our standing in the world.\u201d\n\nIn the past few weeks, Trump has publicly announced that the U.S. is \u201clocked and loaded\u201d in case Iran turns out to be the culprit behind last weekend\u2019s missile strikes on Saudi Arabian oil facilities. He laid out on Twitter since-scrapped plans to invite the Taliban to Camp David for negotiations days before the anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks.\n\nAnd he introduced the idea of additional tariffs on China one Friday, setting off a scramble inside the West Wing that forced his top economic officials to abandon top-level meetings, rush to the Oval Office and make policy in the wake of his tweet.\n\nIf the president seems liberated, it\u2019s been an evolution to reach that point.\n\n\u201cThe downward momentum in Trump\u2019s approval rating scares me a bit from a foreign policy perspective because he is a win-at-all-costs type of a person. I worry he could get us into an ill-advised military conflict in an attempt to regain support,\u201d said Anthony Scaramucci, the New York financier and short-lived White House communications director. \u201cFrom an economic perspective, he\u2019s going to reach into his bag of tricks to try to stimulate growth. I think he\u2019ll end up cutting a trade deal with China to remove that cloud of uncertainty from markets, but I think due to his increasing desperation it will end up being a bad deal for the United States.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the president\u2019s relative isolation, he and the administration face several challenges this fall over which Trump does not have total control, including foreign policy challenges such as Iran, China or North Korea, ongoing risks to the economy, passage of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement or potential congressional action on gun control.\n\nThis uncertainty might not sit well with a president who has said he likes to make all the decisions, said O\u2019Brien, the author of \u201cTrumpNation.\u201c\n\nWhatever actions he does take now will also become part of his record heading into the election. \u201cHe will have to answer specific questions about that report card, and he will be frustrated by those,\u201d O\u2019Brien added.\n\nIf the president seems liberated, it\u2019s been an evolution to reach that point.\n\nIn the early days, Trump felt out of his depth on national security and foreign policy or what he legally could do through executive action, said three former senior administration officials. He knew, for instance, he wanted to roll back the Obama legacy on regulations or environmental rules, but he did not initially grasp the mechanics of doing so.\n\nNor did he understand the breadth of the federal government \u2014 like the huge number of people it employed, or the usual checks on presidential power like Congress or the courts, said one of the officials. Trump is the first president elected who did not first hold political office or serve in the military. While this outsider status helped propel his political rise and underscored his populist message, it also left his government far behind operationally and organizationally as it took over the White House.\n\nIn the ensuing three years, Trump has grown more comfortable with the trappings of the office and has formed his own relationships with world leaders, say current and former administration officials, even as he\u2019s upended traditional global alliances. He\u2019s earned a greater understanding of his executive authority and has developed relationships with many members of Congress, whom he calls directly.\n\nNow the White House runs as he prefers, with him at the center of the action \u2014 speaking directly to reporters from the Oval Office, breaking his own news and laying out policy decisions by tweet.\n\n\u201cThis is now more of a government built on the basis of Trump\u2019s reactions to things,\u201d said one of the former senior administration officials. \u201cThe president has learned as much as he cares to know about the mechanics of government. He\u2019s figured out, on most things, he can continue to play a public relations battle.\u201d\n\nDaniel Lippman and Ben White contributed reporting.", "description": "No longer hemmed in by aides, Trump has bent the presidency into the mold of his Trump Organization setup \u2014 with him at the center.", "authors": ["Nancy Cook", "Daniel Lippman", "Rosa Prince"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1168700433-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
