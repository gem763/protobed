He was studying at Gloucester University and had his sights on a career in film production. And anyone lucky enough to have known Sam would know that when he set his sights on something, he always achieved it.\n\n\"He was a young man that all of us are proud to say was a friend and was a credit to his parents and to Esher Rugby Club.\n\n\"But he's been taken from us too young; the Abbots have lost a brother. We'll miss you, Potts, but we'll never forget you.\"\n\nOn May 12th loved ones went to Widden Rugby Club in Gloucester to release Chinese lanterns in Sam's memory.\n\nA fundraising campaign for a memorial bench at the rugby club raised more than \u00a33,500, and it was hoped there would also be enough for a bench at his university campus.", "description": "University of Gloucestershire student Samuel Potter, 19, from Hersham, Surrey, was \"a young man destined for success\"", "authors": ["John Hawkins", "Image", "Esher Rugclub Bpm Media", "Go Fund Me", "Google Streetview"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article16220528.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_JS1832094581.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
