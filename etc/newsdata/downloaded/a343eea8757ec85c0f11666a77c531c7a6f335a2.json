He is a grandson of Robert F Kennedy, who was attorney general under his brother John F Kennedy, then a senator for New York and a presidential candidate before being assassinated, like his brother before him, in 1968.\n\nJohn and Robert\u2019s brother Ted was a prominent Massachusetts senator until his death in 2009.\n\nJoe Kennedy made official his challenge to Markey, 73, a co-sponsor with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of the Green New Deal, on Saturday morning.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a time for waiting,\u201d Kennedy wrote, \u201cfor sitting on the sidelines, or for playing by rules that don\u2019t work any more. This is the fight of our lives, the fight of my generation \u2013 and I\u2019m all in.\u201d\n\nIn a video, he added: \u201cIn this moment, we refuse to accept the status quo that tells us big things aren\u2019t possible. I\u2019m running for Senate because this is the fight of our lives.\u201d\n\nThe son of former Massachusetts congressman Joe Kennedy II will pose a serious challenge. A Boston Globe and Suffolk University poll released earlier this month found Kennedy leading by 14 points in a head-to-head contest.\n\nMarkey has been in Congress since 1976 and the Senate since 2013. In a statement anticipating Kennedy\u2019s challenge, he said he would \u201crun on all the issues I\u2019ve been fighting for today and into the future\u201d, which he listed as \u201cclimate change, income inequality, a woman\u2019s right to choose and on gun safety legislation.\n\n\u201cI am going to continue those fights into this campaign and I will do so every day that I\u2019m out there crisscrossing the state of Massachusetts and fighting for the people of our state.\u201d\n\nKennedy and Markey are not far apart ideologically but the challenger sees a national Democratic party with more energetic leadership, standing up to Republicans who have chosen to back Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cThis about leadership,\u201d a Democratic operative familiar with Kennedy\u2019s thinking told the Guardian on Saturday. \u201cIt\u2019s why he was asked to offer the party\u2019s response to Trump\u2019s state of the union address [in 2018], and should be seen in the context of the post-2016 election [era].\u201d\n\nThe challenge for Kennedy will be to articulate a compelling reason, other than his bloodline, for seeking to knock Markey out. The congressman planned a seven-stop tour of Massachusetts on Saturday, meeting figures from Democratic state leadership.\n\nOn Friday, Salem mayor Kim Driscoll co-authored an op-ed in CommonWealth magazine in which she explained her endorsement of the congressman.\n\n\u201cAs mayors, our highest priority when it comes to partners in Congress is a leader who shows up. And Joe shows up for Massachusetts,\u201d she wrote.\n\nHis challenge will also invite criticism that he is embarking on an expensive and divisive fight at a time when the party should be united in seeking to unseat Trump and secure a majority in the Senate.\n\nMarkey\u2019s supporters include his fellow Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, who told reporters last month he had been \u201ca great partner in the Senate\u201d. But the presidential hopeful also acknowledged Kennedy, noting he had once been her student.\n\n\u201cI worked with Joe before either one of us was in politics and have worked with him ever since he\u2019s been in Congress,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s really an amazing person.\u201d\n\nMarkey has the support of the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, and Ocasio-Cortez, the New York congresswoman who dominates the progressive wing of the party. He has also lined up more than 100 state legislators, many of whom point to his leadership on climate change.\n\n\u201cWe are lucky to have one of the nation\u2019s strongest climate champions, Ed Markey, representing Massachusetts in the US Senate,\u201d Environment Massachusetts state director Ben Hellerstein said on Friday, saying the group would put $5m forward to support his reelection campaign.\n\n\u201cVoters need to know what Ed Markey has done throughout decades of public service to advance renewable energy, clean water, clean air, and the protection of our public lands. We intend to tell his story.\u201d", "description": "* Congressman, 38, to challenge Ed Markey in Massachusetts  * \u2018This is the fight of our lives, the fight of my generation\u2019Joe Kennedy, pictured on Saturday in Boston with his wife Lauren and son James, will take on Ed Markey in the Democratic primary.
