Janice Bowling, a Republican from Tullahoma, Tennessee, says she was surprised by AT&T\u2019s adversarial reaction to her bill to allow cities to expand their broadband networks. (Allan Holmes/Center for Public Integrity)\n\nKey findings: More than 130 U.S. cities currently offer a fiber or cable Internet connection to residents. Twenty states in the U.S. ban or restrict municipal broadband, cities say those bans stifle economic growth. Rather than invest in infrastructure, big telecom has spent millions lobbying, donating to state lawmakers and litigating to keep bans alive. AT&T\u2019s political action committee gave $13.6 million to state lawmaker campaigns during the 2012 election cycle. FCC is considering pre-empting state law on municipal broadband, public comment period ends Friday, Aug. 29. FCC\u2019s municipal broadband authority could come down to a footnote from an appeals court ruling earlier this year.\n\nJanice Bowling, a 67-year-old grandmother and Republican state senator from rural Tennessee, thought it only made sense that the city of Tullahoma be able to offer its local high-speed Internet service to areas beyond the city limits.\n\nAfter all, many of her rural constituents had slow service or did not have access to commercial providers, like AT&T Inc. and Charter Communications Inc.\n\nBut a 1999 Tennessee law prohibits cities that operate their own Internet networks from providing access outside the boundaries where they provide electrical service. Bowling wanted to change that and introduced a bill in February to allow them to expand.\n\nShe viewed the network, which offers speeds about 80 times faster than AT&T and 10 times faster than Charter in Tullahoma according to advertised services, as a utility, like electricity, that all Tennesseans need.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t quarrel with the fact that AT&T has shareholders that it has to answer to,\u201d Bowling said with a drawl while sitting in the spacious wood-paneled den of her log-cabin-style home. \u201cThat\u2019s fine, and I believe in capitalism and the free market. But when they won\u2019t come in, then Tennesseans have an obligation to do it themselves.\u201d\n\nAt a meeting three weeks after Bowling introduced Senate Bill 2562, the state\u2019s three largest telecommunications companies \u2014 AT&T, Charter, and Comcast Corp. \u2014 tried to convince Republican leaders to relegate the measure to so-called \u201csummer study,\u201d a black hole that effectively kills a bill. Bowling, described as \u201cfeisty\u201d by her constituents, initially beat back the effort and thought she\u2019d get a vote.\n\nThat\u2019s when Joelle Phillips, president of AT&T\u2019s Tennessee operations, leaned toward her across the table in a conference room next to the House caucus leader\u2019s office and said tersely, \u201cWell, I\u2019d hate for this to end up in litigation,\u201d Bowling recalls.\n\nThe threat surprised Bowling, and apparently AT&T\u2019s ominous warning reached her colleagues as well. Days later, support in the Tennessee House for Bowling\u2019s bill dissolved. AT&T had won.\n\n\u201cI had no idea the force that would come against this, because it\u2019s just so reasonable and so necessary,\u201d Bowling said.\n\nAT&T and Phillips didn\u2019t respond to emails asking for comment.\n\nA national fight\n\nTullahoma is just one battlefront in a nationwide war that the telecommunications giants are fighting against the spread of municipal broadband networks. For more than a decade, AT&T, Comcast, Time Warner Cable Inc., and CenturyLink Inc. have spent millions of dollars to lobby state legislatures, influence state elections and buy research to try to stop the spread of public Internet services that often offer faster speeds at cheaper rates.\n\nThe companies have succeeded in getting laws passed in 20 states that ban or restrict municipalities from offering Internet to residents.\n\nNow the fight has gone national. The Federal Communications Commission in Washington, D.C., is considering requests from Chattanooga, Tennessee, and Wilson, North Carolina, to pre-empt state laws that block municipalities from building or expanding broadband networks, hindering economic growth, the cities argue.\n\nIf the FCC rules in favor of the cities, and the ruling survives any legal challenges, municipalities nationwide will be free to offer high-speed Internet to residents when they aren\u2019t satisfied with the service provided by private telecommunications companies.\n\nTo better understand the municipal broadband debate, the Center for Public Integrity traveled to two southern cities. Tullahoma, which has a broadband network, and Fayetteville, North Carolina, which doesn\u2019t.\n\nCity-provided broadband widespread\n\nMore than 130 cities from Norwood, Massachusetts, to Clallam County, Washington, currently offer fiber or cable Internet connections to their communities, according to the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a group that supports municipal broadband. The municipalities are mostly small to mid-sized cities that critics say large Internet providers avoid because the return on investment is too low.\n\nCities build broadband networks to support businesses, improve health care and education, and attract jobs, they say. About 89 cities offer gigabit speeds, a rate that can download a 4.5 gigabyte movie in 36 seconds. The same file takes an hour at 10 megabits per second. Slower DSL or dial-up connections, which are common in rural areas, would take many hours longer.\n\nMouse over or tap cities with municipal fiber to see available plans. Tap the commercial providers to see coverage.

They don\u2019t want the competition, and they\u2019ll do anything to keep it out.\u201d\n\nMost of the telecommunications companies say they support municipal broadband, but only for those areas that they don\u2019t serve.\n\n\u201cThe idea of private capital competing with taxpayer-provided capital just feels inconsistent to us with what a free-market system looks like,\u201d AT&T Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson said at a U.S. Senate hearing in June. \u201cBut where it\u2019s unserved, it seems like a logical place for government to step in and provide a solution.\u201d\n\nBy far, AT&T is the company with the most political influence in states, say statehouse watchers.\n\n\u201cOn a scale of 1 to 10 on who is the most powerful lobbying presence in Tennessee, AT&T is a 12,\u201d said a long-time lobbyist in Nashville who asked not to be identified so he could speak candidly about lobbying in the state. \u201cThey are the big horse in the race, and they are unstoppable.\u201d\n\nAT&T spent between $250,000 and $300,000 this year hiring 15 lobbyists, ranking it among the largest spenders, according to the Tennessee Ethics Commission.\n\nAT&T\u2019s political action committee is also the biggest donor among telecommunications companies to state campaigns nationwide. Since 2000, its donations more than tripled to $13.6 million in the 2012 election cycle, according to the National Institute on Money in State Politics, which tracks campaign contributions in the states.\n\nIn Tennessee, AT&T\u2019s giving in the 2014 election cycle was more than $370,000, almost five times what it was in 2000. In North Carolina, AT&T\u2019s total campaign giving in the 2012 election cycle, including 2011, when the General Assembly passed a bill to restrict municipal broadband networks, was more than $404,000, 60 percent higher than in 2000.\n\nAT&T didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. Stephenson said during the Senate hearing that he wasn\u2019t aware that AT&T had spent millions of dollars on lobbying for laws that restrict municipal broadband.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying we haven\u2019t,\u201d Stephenson said. \u201cI just don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nComcast, the second-largest campaign contributor among telecommunications companies in Tennessee, also has upped its PAC giving from about $3,200 in the 2004 election cycle to a record of more than $270,450 in the 2012 cycle, according to the money in state politics institute.\n\nGoing to court\n\nTelecommunications companies aren\u2019t hesitant to spend millions of dollars on lawsuits to kill municipal broadband.\n\nLafayette, Louisiana, population 123,000, considered building a network in 2004 when city leaders couldn\u2019t convince BellSouth or Cox Communications Inc. to install a fiber network for residents. For the next three years, Lafayette spent $4 million responding to three lawsuits and subsequent appeals from BellSouth, which AT&T bought in 2006, and Cox. The city eventually borrowed $125 million to build the network.\n\nTerry Huval, director of utilities for the city, told a U.S. Senate committee in 2010 that the companies\u2019 actions were \u201cgrossly excessive.\u201d\n\nThe companies have also used traditional campaign tactics such as newspaper ads, push polls, direct mail and door-to-door canvassing to block municipal networks. And they\u2019ve tried to undermine the appetite for municipal broadband by paying for research from think tanks and front groups to portray the networks as unreliable and costly.\n\nIn a June 19 op-ed in The Wall Street Journal, Thomas Schatz, president of Citizens Against Government Waste, and Royce Van Tassell, vice president of the Utah Taxpayers Association, wrote that an effort by Utah cities to build a municipal broadband network \u201chas caused a spectacular financial failure.\u201d\n\nThe authors cited a study by Joseph Fuhr Jr., an economics professor at Widener University in Chester, Pennsylvania, who gave examples of municipal broadband networks that were failing.\n\nSchatz and Tassell did not mention the study was paid for by the Coalition for the New Economy, which says it consists of \u201cbusinesses, associations, and individuals who are concerned about wasteful duplication of existing or planned Internet service.\u201d\n\nThe group\u2019s IRS Form 990 for 2012 shows it gave between $5,000 and $15,000 to each of seven conservative groups, including Americans for Prosperity and the 60 Plus Association, which are backed by billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch; the Center for Individual Freedom, which has been funded by Crossroads GPS, the nonprofit political outside spending group co-founded by Karl Rove; and the tea party-backed FreedomWorks Inc.\n\nThad Nation, a former staffer to two Democratic governors who is listed as executive director on the form, didn\u2019t return calls or emails asking for comment.\n\nImpact on business\n\nThe success of these tactics worries Ted Hackney, executive director of the Industrial Board of Coffee County, who\u2019s in charge of attracting businesses to the Coffee County Joint Industrial Park, a 400-acre development five miles outside Tullahoma.\n\nThe site is home to just four businesses, including a tool and die shop and a food processor. A visit in July revealed that it consisted mostly of acres of tall, green stalks of corn.\n\nHackney is trying to attract technology companies including a large data center, but the Internet service from Charter won\u2019t support such data-hungry businesses. The only network that can provide robust capacity at an affordable price is LightTUBe, the municipal Internet run by the Tullahoma Utility Board (TUB).\n\nIf the park can\u2019t get the service, \u201cit certainly would be disappointing,\u201d Hackney said. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t completely wipe us out, but we need it if we are really going to make a go of this.\u201d\n\nHackney is partial to LightTUBe because it\u2019s a local business and it\u2019s financially stable. In its first year, LightTUBe reported a positive cash flow, but showed losses due to the depreciation of assets.\n\nToday, it has 3,250 customers, about 35 percent of the market, with Charter claiming about the same, estimates Brian Skelton, TUB\u2019s general manager. The utility has paid off more than $3 million of the $16.9 million in bonds it issued to build the network, and it projects it will report its first profit this year \u2014 $200,000 \u2014 one year behind schedule.\n\nIts success rebuts one of the arguments telecommunications companies have made against municipal broadband systems \u2014 that small cities don\u2019t have the technical expertise to operate complex networks or the financial experience to manage the funding. Tullahoma, population 18,700, is one of the smallest cities in the nation with a gigabit network.\n\nTo be sure, several cities have had financial difficulties. They include Ashland, Oregon; Burlington, Vermont; and the 11-city Utah Telecommunications Open Infrastructure Agency. Some, such as Provo, Utah, and Groton, Connecticut, have sold their networks.\n\nBut proponents of municipal broadband say the successes outnumber the failures. And for Tullahoma officials, the characterization is insulting.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like everyone in Tullahoma was barefoot and dumb,\u201d said Cope, who works for Avion Solutions Inc., a major engineering defense contractor and is chairman of TUB. \u201cWe do have a fair amount of sophistication in the community, despite what many people think.\u201d\n\nLightTUBe\u2019s Internet packages are lower-priced than Charter\u2019s or AT&T\u2019s when speed is accounted for.\n\nTUB\u2019s annual customer turnover is low, with less than 1 percent leaving compared with the industry average of 1 to 2 percent. The low rate is surprising, Skelton said, because if a customer moves out of the city limits, \u201cwe can no longer serve them because of the state law.\u201d About 80 percent of the customers who leave TUB do so because they have moved out of the city, with most of the other 20 percent leaving for promotional offers like a $200 credit card from AT&T, he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re cheaper than anyone, but we can\u2019t compete with the teaser offers,\u201d Skelton said.\n\nDavid Lufty, president of AgiSent Technologies Inc., said the company moved to Tullahoma, Tennessee, for the city\u2019s high-speed broadband network.\n\nAllan Holmes/Center for Public Integrity\n\nService serves hospital\n\nLightTUBe\u2019s customers include big manufacturers, insurance agents, car dealerships and doctors\u2019 offices, as well as \u201cmom and pop shops,\u201d Skelton said\n\nLisa Hayes, owner of 1st Choice Realtor, which employs 15 people, said LightTUBe\u2019s reliability has helped her triple her sales this year since she moved to a Web-based listings service. She switched from Charter because her Internet connection would frequently crash and response times were slow.\n\n\u201cWe just can\u2019t afford to be down at all, and we can\u2019t wait for two weeks to get something fixed, or we\u2019ll lose customers,\u201d Hayes said.\n\nAgisent Technologies Inc., which provides online records management for police departments and city jails, moved to Tullahoma in 2011 because it needed a fast reliable broadband network that had a backup if the connection failed, said David Lufty, the company\u2019s president.\n\nCharter and AT&T couldn\u2019t offer redundancy, but LightTUBe could.\n\n\u201cSince we\u2019ve been here, we haven\u2019t had more than five minutes of downtime in almost three years,\u201d Lufty said.\n\nCharter didn\u2019t respond to phone calls and emails seeking comment.\n\n1st Choice and Agisent are examples of what fast and reliable broadband can do to encourage economic growth, according to Robert Litan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who has researched the economics of technology. In a 2007 study, Litan and his colleagues found that for every one-percentage-point increase in the availability of broadband in a state, the number of jobs increased up to three-tenths of a percent per year. Faster broadband speeds likely have the same effect, he said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the magnitude would be, but I am convinced you can show there is an incremental benefit,\u201d Litan said.\n\nThe Tullahoma Utilities Board touts the advantages of its gigabit LighTUBe broadband network on a sign outside its offices.\n\nAllan Holmes/Center for Public Integrity\n\nEmployment in Tullahoma lagged statewide job growth before theLightTUBe was turned on. Since the recession ended in 2009, two years after the city began offering broadband, the city has outpaced job growth in Tennessee. The city added 3,598 jobs from April 2009 to April 2014, a 1.63 percent annual growth rate, about double the statewide rate, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nArnold Air Force Base and its flight simulation development complex, as well as a regional medical center, are the primary engines for employment, officials say, but \u201cif the city of Tullahoma can offer to businesses high-speed Internet at a reasonable price as part of the city\u2019s overall infrastructure, we think that\u2019s a huge advantage for us and one that businesses look for,\u201d said Thom Robinson, executive director of the Tullahoma Area Economic Development Corp.\n\nMeanwhile, in Fayetteville\n\nIn Fayetteville, the story is different.\n\nLike Tullahoma, the North Carolina city is adjacent to a military base: Fort Bragg. But Fayetteville\u2019s economy has been struggling for years. Unemployment has been reduced since the depths of the recent recession, but not as quickly as in the rest of the state. The unemployment rate in Cumberland County, where Fayetteville serves as county seat, was 7.6 percent in June, placing it 78th out of the 100 counties in North Carolina and a sharp drop from 21st just five years ago, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nEric Mansfield, a former state senator and an ear, nose and throat specialist in Fayetteville, North Carolina, supports city-run broadband.\n\nAllan Holmes/Center for Public Integrity\n\nIt took shop owners on the north (right) side of Hay Street in Fayetteville, North Carolina years to convince Time Warner Cable to provide them with Internet service, even though the south side of the street was wired.\n\nAllan Holmes/Center for Public Integrity\n\nJob growth has been anemic in the last five years, with employment increasing 0.55 percent a year compared with 1.27 percent statewide.\n\nIt was the struggling economy, combined with his own experience that led Eric Mansfield, a soft-spoken physician in Fayetteville and a former Democratic state senator, to fight a law that would restrict his city from providing fast Internet to its residents and businesses.\n\nThe city\u2019s Public Works Commission operates a gigabit network of more than 200 miles of fiber-optic cables throughout Fayetteville that connect computer systems to monitor its electric, water and sewer systems, and provide Internet access to local government buildings, fire stations and the city\u2019s hospital.\n\nBut residents and businesses can\u2019t hook into the network. Mansfield\u2019s Cape Fear Otolaryngology pays $359 a month to Time Warner Cable for a slower connection that frequently crashes trying to manage the load from the practice\u2019s electronic medical records and CT scans, Mansfield said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just horrible,\u201d he said.\n\nTime Warner told Mansfield it would cost $500 a month for a faster line.\n\nMansfield said as a businessman he understands Time Warner Cable\u2019s refusal to upgrade its network in Fayetteville, because the return on its investment is just not there.\n\n\u201cBut we still need a fast, affordable network,\u201d Mansfield said. \u201cThey have a monopoly, and they act that way. I just think a little competition from the city would go a long way in getting better service for everyone.\u201d\n\nTime Warner Cable said it couldn\u2019t respond to Mansfield\u2019s experience unless they knew the facts of his situation.", "description": "", "authors": ["Allan Holmes"], "top_image": "https://publicintegrity.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Coffee2cc-1170x600-c-default.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
