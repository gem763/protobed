Today, mental health is rarely out of the headlines.\n\nBut we have reached a critical point: continuing to \u2018raise awareness\u2019 of mental health \u2014 the goal of recent public campaigns \u2014 has become a double-edged sword.\n\nIndeed, so \u2018aware\u2019 are people, we risk driving more and more of them to seek help when they don\u2019t actually have a mental illness.\n\nFreddie Flintoff and Nadiya Hussain (pictured) are featured in the film to promote the Every Mind Matters campaign. It is being narrated by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\n\nGP surgeries and mental health services \u2014 as my colleagues and I know only too well \u2014 are being inundated with people struggling to cope with everyday difficulties that can make all of us feel sad, anxious or low.\n\nSo what we need to do now is concentrate on enabling people to help themselves when it comes to their mental health.\n\nWhich is why I feel so passionately about Public Health England\u2019s (PHE) new initiative Every Mind Matters \u2014 not least because I was involved from its conception.\n\nIt launched this week with a three-minute TV film by Love Actually director Richard Curtis. Among the cast are Gillian Anderson, Glenn Close, Nadiya Hussain and Freddie Flintoff, and it is narrated by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.\n\nThe focal point is a specially-developed website that provides access to the first preventative mental health resource of its kind in the world.\n\nApproved by the Royal College of General Practitioners, the website takes users through a series of questions to build a personalised action plan.\n\nActress Glenn Close is also seen in the three-minute TV film by Love Actually director Richard Curtis. And Public Health England has been keen to ensure the campaign does not medicalise people and overwhelm mental health services\n\nThe predominant message is that taking care of our mental health is as important as good physical health. And when we\u2019re struggling a bit, there are easy things we can do to get back on track. The website shows users how to build simple change into their lives: such as \u2018reframing\u2019 unhelpful thoughts, breathing exercises and increasing physical activity.\n\nSome cynics have suggested the new campaign is a surefire way of labelling everyone with a mental illness. Actually, it\u2019s the precise opposite.\n\nFrom the beginning, PHE was keen to ensure the campaign didn\u2019t medicalise people and further overwhelm mental health services.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have reunited for the campaign which will see Mind offering personalised advice for people struggling with stress, depression or poor sleep\n\nIn a moment of television history, a short film promoting the new resource was broadcast across all commercial channels\n\nThe aim is to strengthen mental resilience so people can live more fully in the present, feel and function better, enjoy more positive relationships, and be better placed to manage difficult times without resorting to their GP or mental health services.\n\nTake the young man referred to me recently: he\u2019d been prescribed antidepressants after breaking down in tears in front of his GP. I discovered he was grief-stricken over the death of his mother. I immediately stopped the medication. Crying because your mother has died is normal and I\u2019d be more worried if the patient had not showed his emotions.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say his situation wasn\u2019t deeply challenging for him, but it wasn\u2019t pathological. Life can be difficult, frustrating, disappointing and uncertain \u2014 and that\u2019s when we need mental resilience.\n\nEvery Mind Matters is backed by a coalition of mental health charities and groups including, including Mind, Samaritans and the Royal College of GPs (the logo is pictured)\n\nWe know prevention is better than cure and the opportunity for early intervention provided by the Every Mind Matters website will help reduce the risk of deterioration into full-blown mental illness.\n\nIn the long-term, I hope this campaign will ease the pressure on health services as people distinguish between the need for \u2018self-care\u2019 or seeking clinical help.\n\nIn the 20 years that I\u2019ve worked in mental health things have changed beyond all recognition. This is a very welcome next step.\n\nwww.everymindmatters.co.uk\n\nSchools should ban unjabbed pupils Health Secretary Matt Hancock has suggested childhood vaccination should be made compulsory. I have some sympathy with this view. The idea people might risk the lives of their children because of a denial of the science or the lies of anti-vax propagandists is tantamount to child neglect. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has suggested that childhood vaccinations should be compulsory (pictured with Secretary of State for Wales Alun Cairns). There is merit to this view as with parental rights come responsibilities - and they should protect their children So I, along with tens of thousands of healthcare professionals, welcome the Mail\u2019s brilliant new campaign \u2014 Give The Children Their Jabs \u2014 which aims to improve uptake of vaccinations. There is a fine balance between allowing parents the right to make choices on their children\u2019s wellbeing and the rights of others not to be put at risk because of those choices. A parent who decides not to vaccinate their child is selfishly placing other children who are unable to have vaccines for medical reasons in direct danger. If you choose, for whatever reason, not to give your child the MMR jab or any other vaccination, then I believe they should be excluded from school. For me the choice is simple: with parental rights come responsibilities. Protect your own child and ensure the health of their classmates. If you shirk that responsibility, then it is only right you \u2014 and unfortunately your child \u2014 are penalised.\n\nDr Max prescribes...\n\nThe idea behind the \u2018ReMe\u2019 app is to provide carers of those with dementia, cognitive impairment or learning disabilities with a better understanding of the person they are looking after.\n\nIt helps carers build an ever-growing database of knowledge about their patients \u2014 their likes, dislikes, habits, favourite memories, family members, treasured photographs and so on.\n\nI love this idea. When carers see their charges as individuals with a past, present and future and not just as a job, the care they deliver is significantly improved.\n\nremindmecare.com\n\nIt's ageist to dose elderly with pills\n\nThe number of over-65s on antidepressant drugs has doubled in the past 20 years, according to research by the University of East Anglia.\n\nWhich rather raises the question \u2014 why are so many being given medication instead of talking therapies?\n\nThe answer is ageism. It is easier (and cheaper) to write a prescription than it is to arrange for counselling or psychotherapy for this age group. I think there\u2019s a sense of \u2018what\u2019s the point?\u2019 and an assumption that they\u2019re stuck in their ways.\n\nOver-65s should be given more talking therapy such as counselling sessions instead of handing them antidepressants. The number of pensioners on these drugs has doubled in the past 20 years, according to research by the University of East Anglia\n\nBut the evidence is that over-65s respond very well to therapy and are more likely to attend appointments than other groups, not least because they have more time.\n\nAnd older people may do far worse on medication. Their slower metabolisms mean they are more at risk of side-effects \u2014 often more pronounced, too \u2014 than those experienced by younger people.\n\nThe drugs can affect blood clotting, increase confusion, cause chemical imbalances in the blood and make patients feel dizzy or light-headed.\n\nThey may also interfere with other medications commonly prescribed to older people such as high blood pressure pills.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that these drugs aren\u2019t useful and that some older patients don\u2019t need them. But depriving the older population of talking therapies is wrong. We need to extend access now.\n\nBoris Johnson is being urged by the head of NHS England, Simon Stevens, to be \u2018led by the evidence\u2019 that shows sugar taxes work.\n\nI\u2019ve been against the tax on sugary drinks because I saw it as state interference. But, as the saying goes, \u2018when the facts change, I change my mind\u2019. Now, the facts suggest it is effective. People really are drinking fewer sugary drinks.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has been urged to show NHS England how the sugar tax works\n\nWe have an obesity epidemic to tackle and extending the sugar tax is part of this.\n\nIt is a psychological \u2018nudge\u2019 tactic \u2014 encouraging behaviour change.\n\nMinimum pricing for alcohol is another example. Alcohol sales in Scotland have fallen to their lowest level since records began after a minimum price of 50p per unit was set last year.\n\nIt\u2019s estimated this will result in nearly 400 fewer deaths in the first five years. Who would argue with that? It\u2019s nudgism, not nanny-stateism.", "description": "DR MAX: The Every Mind Matters Campaign, ReMe app for carers and counselling for over-65s, instead of giving them antidepressants  are ways we can help ourselves to better mental health.", "authors": ["Dr Max Pemberton For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/01/19612244-0-image-a-95_1570840904979.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
