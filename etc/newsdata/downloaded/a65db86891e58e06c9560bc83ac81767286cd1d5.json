You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe task of finding out \u201cwhat the person on the street really thinks\u201d, otherwise known as vox pops, is usually pretty arduous for a journalist. You might be standing alone in the rain, perhaps with a print out of a proposed new government anti-smoking campaign. You try your best, but most of the time asking passersby for their thoughts is inefficient and, worse, you have no guarantee of capturing an accurate representation of the public\u2019s view, as if such a thing exists anyway.\n\nTake the same tactics to a major demonstration or protest, however, and the vox pop becomes something really worth doing.\n\nWhen around a million people take to the streets to demand something, in this case a Final Say referendum, you already know what it is they want. They\u2019re in good spirits and always happy to offer their opinion when a camera is shoved in their face. What this allows for is moments of eloquence, as with the viral bootleg of the Sky News clip.\n\nThese people are generally informed on the topic you\u2019re asking them about, as opposed to conjuring an opinion after being ambushed with a disgusting picture of a lung full of tar.\n\nAs a co-organiser of Saturday\u2019s march, The Independent was there in full force. \u201cI want a good future for my children,\u201d one man told Alastair Campbell and I as we roamed around Parliament Square filming our very own vox pop video.\n\nA 13-year-old girl explained to us how she felt it was unfair she wasn\u2019t able to express her voice on an issue that will effect her future so heavily, before telling 62-year-old Alastair that it\u2019s about more than just the lives of \u201c50-year-olds and above\u201d.\n\nSo the march for a Final Say last weekend had multiple benefits. Not only did it fight for democracy and demand that the will of the people be respected, it also made a usually thankless task for people like me utterly worthwhile, interesting and informative.\n\nYours,\n\nTom Richell\n\nHead of video", "description": "The result of the EU referendum in 2016 \u201cdoesn\u2019t deserve respect\u201d says a woman clutching her young daughter at the Let Us Be Heard march on Saturday in London.
