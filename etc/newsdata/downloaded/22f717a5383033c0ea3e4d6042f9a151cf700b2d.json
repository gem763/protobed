Some trusts are having to spend as much as one-sixth of their entire budget on repaying debts falling due as a result of the \u201ctoxic\u201d PFI scheme, says the IPPR thinktank.\n\nThe \u00a313bn of investment that PFI brought into hospitals will end up costing the NHS in England a staggering \u00a380bn by the time all contracts come to an end, the IPPR says. Sherwood Forest trust in Nottinghamshire has a \u00a3326m PFI deal that costs it \u00a350.3m a year in repayments and eats up the largest proportion of its budget of any trust: 16.51%. The \u00a31.2bn outlay to build the Royal London hospital will have cost the Barts Health trust \u00a36.2bn by the time it ends, according to Treasury figures. \u201cAll trust debts should be wiped clean by the Treasury, and contracts renegotiated and brought back into public ownership on grounds of poor value,\u201d said Dr John Puntis, co-chair of the campaign group Keep Our NHS Public.\n\nLawless Johnson warned \u2013 Civil service union the FDA has put Boris Johnson on notice not to make its members break the law, after his refusal to comply with legislation to prevent a no-deal Brexit. The union has told the PM that the civil servants\u2019 code binds them to \u201ccomply with the law and uphold the administration of justice\u201d. Leaked warnings about a no-deal Brexit that the government previously dismissed as outdated have been affirmed after MPs forced the government to release its plan, known as Operation Yellowhammer. No deal could result in rising food and fuel prices, disruption to medicine supplies and public disorder on Britain\u2019s streets, according to the documents. In Ireland the price of bread is likely to go up: the only two industrial-scale flour mills on the island are in Northern Ireland, so cross-border tariffs would be introduced. The uncertainty is leaving the all-island agri-food sector in disarray, Lisa O\u2019Carroll writes. Ivor Ferguson, Ulster Farmers Union president, says: \u201cAll in all, no deal will be a total disaster and a percentage of farmers would be out of business.\u201d\n\nLitter louts all \u2013 Jeremy Paxman will today indict Britain as \u201ca nation of litter louts\u201d and blast government efforts to clean up the country\u2019s act. \u201cThere is, in truth, only one way to solve this problem,\u201d the patron of Clean Up Britain will tell a waste and recycling conference. \u201cPeople have to change the way they behave. Our ambition is to reach a point where dropping litter is as socially unacceptable as drunk driving.\u201d Paxman has called for measures including number plate recognition to catch litterers at drive-throughs. He hit out at the government and the Keep Britain Tidy charity as both \u201cuseless\u201d \u2013 the latter responded that it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d to be attacked by a kindred campaigner. Meanwhile MPs have been told that increasingly used biodegradable alternatives to plastic packaging can be just as harmful if not broken down in industrial composting facilities as intended. MPs say the focus should be on reducing plastic packaging rather than using other materials. And farming may be under threat because the earthworms that ensure soil health are stunted by ever more prevalent microplastic pollution, scientists have found.\n\nHealth records thrown open \u2013 Britain is to allow pharmaceutical firms, doctors and academics access to millions of NHS patients\u2019 medical histories to help the search for cures for ailments from cancer to mental illness. Seven \u201cdata hubs\u201d will be set up. It is likely to raise anxiety about possible breaches of patients\u2019 privacy and the commercialisation of patient records. The programme will be run by Health Data Research (HDR) UK, a non-profit body independent of government. It says the data will be anonymised. Separately, chances of surviving cancer are improving in the UK but have not caught up with other comparable countries, a 20-year research exercise has shown. Other countries are doing better thanks to new technologies and efforts to catch and treat cancer early.\n\n\u2018Loot boxes\u2019 under scrutiny \u2013 Video game \u201cloot boxes\u201d should be regulated as gambling and children barred from purchasing them, a House of Commons committee has advised. The in-game rewards offer a random selection of items to players who buy or earn them. The digital, culture, media and sport (DCMS) committee says games that include the purchase of loot boxes for real money should be marked as containing gambling and age-rated content, and the government should consider regulating them as games of chance under the Gambling Act 2005. The recommendation is part of the committee\u2019s report on immersive and addictive technologies, to be delivered today.\n\nKeep working \u2013 A study commissioned by the Labour party has come down against a French-style legal cap on the length of the working week. The cross-bench peer Robert Skidelsky found a reduction in hours was desirable but a blanket limit was unrealistic. Instead he proposed a sector-by-sector approach. The report notes full-time workers in the UK do longer hours than in any EU country except Greece and Austria. \u201cAt present the rules governing employment are largely set by financial logic. This is inimical to a civilised reduction in hours,\u201d Skidelsky wrote. \u201cThere is therefore a strong argument for setting up countervailing institutions to \u2018nudge\u2019 society in a direction which science and technology makes possible, and which is also desired by most people.\u201d John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said he would use the report in formulating Labour policy.\n\nToday in Focus podcast: How Dorian devastated the Bahamas\n\nOliver Laughland tells Rachel Humphrys about the destruction he witnessed in the Bahamas in the aftermath of Hurricane Dorian. Also today: Chris Hanretty on the Scottish court\u2019s ruling that the British government\u2019s suspension of parliament was unlawful (more on that here).\n\nToday in Focus The horrors of Dorian Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https://audio.guim.co.uk/2019/09/11-65356-190911TIF_bahamas.mp3 00:00:00 00:22:00\n\nLunchtime read: Life and death on the high seas\n\nIn August 2010, the captain of the South Korean fishing trawler Sajo Oyang 70 ordered the net back over the side one more time. At about 3am on 18 August, the ship\u2019s first mate roused Captain Shin from his sleep. The net was too full, the first mate told him. It was pulling the boat under.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A cargo ship in a Mediterranean thunderstorm.

When he would finally belay that order and allow the net to be cut free, the knives came out too late \u2013 the ship rolled over. Six crew members, including Shin, lost their lives in the waters of the Pacific. From bullying and sexual assault to squalid living conditions and forced labour, working at sea can be a grim business \u2013 and the deep-sea fishing fleet of the Sajo Group is particularly notorious, Ian Urbina reports.\n\nSport\n\nJoe Root has said the planning for England\u2019s next Ashes tour to Australia begins right away, after dropping Jason Roy for today\u2019s fifth Test, which the tourists\u2019 captain Tim Paine has described as a Grand Final, despite having already retained the urn. Dylan Hartley has said friends reacted to the news he had missed out on England\u2019s Rugby World Cup squad almost as though he had died.\n\nThe Sri Lankan cricket board says it has been warned about a possible terrorist threat during its planned tour of Pakistan. As Europe and the US prepare to face off at Gleneagles the claims that the Solheim Cup is \u2018the pinnacle of women\u2019s golf\u2019 fall flat with only two of the world\u2019s top 10 playing. And Gareth Southgate has admitted he fears the worst when it comes to England\u2019s next two qualifying matches and the potential for disorder involving the team\u2019s supporters.\n\nBusiness\n\nThe Hong Kong stock exchange has made a surprise \u00a332bn bid for the London Stock Exchange in the latest example of growing Chinese interest in British companies. It is the seventh bid for the LSE since 2000. All have failed and Nils Pratley, our financial commentator, reckons this one won\u2019t be any different because it doesn\u2019t offer enough of a cash incentive and there\u2019s too much exposure to political uncertainty in the territory. Asian markets were up overnight on hopes of more monetary easing from the European Central Bank today. The FTSE100 is seen rising 0.5% while the pound is at $1.233 and \u20ac1.119.\n\nThe papers\n\nThe Guardian reports: \u201cFears of no-deal chaos as ministers forced to publish secret documents\u201d, the Times has: \u201cPM blocks key memos on shutting Commons\u201d and the Express reports: \u201cBoris: I won\u2019t do deal with Farage\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Guardian front page, Thursday 12 September 2019.\n\nThe i (\u201cQueen dragged into \u2018unlawful\u2019 shutdown of Commons\u201d) and the Mirror (\u201cBoris lied to the Queen\u201d) take aim at Johnson\u2019s advice to prorogue parliament being deemed illegal. The Telegraph says: \u201cTory rebels offered an olive branch\u201d, with news there may be a way for them to return to the fold.\n\nThe Sun has news of Freddie Flintoff: \u201cFreddie in 124mph Top Gear smash\u201d, the Mail reports of Britain ranking bottom of an international survival table: \u201cUK\u2019s cancer care shame\u201d and the FT has: \u201cLondon Stock Exchange poised to rebuff \u00a332bn Hong Kong bid\u201d.\n\nSign up\n\nThe Guardian Morning Briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes bright and early every weekday.
