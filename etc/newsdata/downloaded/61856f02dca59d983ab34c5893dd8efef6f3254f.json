REUTERS/Feisal Omar\n\nNo casualties were reported in either attack, U.S and Italian officials said.\n\nTwin vehicle-borne bombs at the Baledogle base, where Somali forces and Ugandan peacekeepers are also housed, were followed by small arms fire, a security source and Somali police said.\n\n\u201cTwo suicide car bombs ... tried to attack Baledogle airport but they detonated outside the airport gate,\u201d police Major Abdullahi Nur told Reuters.\n\nThe al Qaeda-linked group al Shabaab said it carried out the attack.\n\nBaledogle is about 100 km (60 miles) west of Mogadishu. Insurgents attacked the base in February using mortars, but caused no casualties.\n\n\u201cThe security forces stopped this ultimately failed attack due to their alertness and swift response, not allowing the attackers to breach the outer defensive perimeters of the base,\u201d the U.S. embassy said in a statement.\n\nThe attack showed al Shabaab maintains a good intelligence network and can mount complex operations, said Hussein Sheikh-Ali, a former national security adviser and founder of the Mogadishu-based security think-tank the Hiraal Institute.\n\nThe attack hit a part of the base that houses U.S. special forces, who supervise Somali forces on operations, he said.\n\n\u201cIt implies they have a high intelligence and a degree of capability just to get close to that place,\u201d he told Reuters.\n\nThe base is also used to mount drone attacks.\n\nMonday\u2019s attacks follow a dip in U.S. airstrikes in Somalia. Africa Command has carried out four in the past two months, compared with 28 in the first three months of 2019. Africa Command said it was monitoring the situation.\n\nCONVOY HIT\n\nAl Shabaab said its fighters had breached the base perimeter, though police denied that.\n\n\u201cIn the early hours of Monday morning, an elite unit of soldiers from Harakat Al-Shabaab Al Mujahideen\u2019s Martyrdom Brigade launched a daring raid on the U.S. military base,\u201d the group said in a statement.\n\n\u201cAfter breaching the perimeters of the heavily fortified base, the mujahideen (holy warriors) stormed the military complex, engaging the crusaders in an intense firefight.\u201d\n\nAl Shabaab is fighting to overthrow the weak, U.N.-backed Somali government and enforce its own strict version of Islamic law in a country riven by civil war since 1991.\n\nIn a separate attack on Monday in Mogadishu, a roadside bomb targeted an Italian military convoy. A Reuters journalist saw a seriously damaged armoured vehicle bearing a small Italian flag sticker. The Italians are part of a European Union mission training Somali forces.\n\nThe incidents follow several other major al Shabaab attacks.\n\nOn Sept. 22, insurgents attacked a base in El Salini, southwest of Mogadishu, using a suicide car bomb and gunmen.\n\nA week earlier, al Shabaab said it killed 14 Burundian peacekeepers. The African Union said three Burundians were killed.
