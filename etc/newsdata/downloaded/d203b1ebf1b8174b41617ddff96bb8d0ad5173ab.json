But it exploded Friday with demonstrators setting fire to subway stations, buses and a high-rise building. It then spread nationwide, fueled by simmering frustration by many Chileans who say that they are not sharing in the advances of a country that is one of Latin America\u2019s wealthiest.\n\n\u201cThe students jumped the turnstiles, and as it happens in revolutions, the elements that trigger a social phenomenon are not very rational,\u201d said Marta Lagos, director of the polling firm Latinobarometro.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just this government\u201d that\u2019s to blame for the frustrations, she said. \u201cThis has been accumulating in the last four governments.\u201d\n\nShortly before the rioting broke out, Conservative President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era boasted in an interview with The Financial Times that Chile \u201clooks like an oasis\u201d in the region because it has a stable democracy, the economy continues to grow and it has been creating jobs, improving salaries and maintaining its macroeconomic balance.\n\nBut its wealth is unevenly spread, with one of the region\u2019s highest rates of inequality. Many Chilean families earn $550 to $700 a month, and pensions can be as low as $159.\n\n\u201cYou can argue \u2026 that we have reduced poverty, that there\u2019s no inflation these days, that the economy is controlled, etc., etc.,\u201d Lagos said. \u201cAnd all those arguments mean nothing to the people who can\u2019t make it to the end of the month.\u201d\n\nJos\u00e9 Tom\u00e1s L\u00f3pez, a cook, said he was protesting \u201cbecause I\u2019ve seen how my other lives, with a salary of not more than ($700) to maintain my three siblings, and I know her debts and all her efforts to meet them.\n\n\u201cI fight so that all that will end and so that all of us will have something fair,\u201d he added.\n\nAfter the protests erupted, Pi\u00f1era rolled back the subway hike and declared a state of emergency. He later said that Chile is \u201cat war with a powerful, relentless enemy that respects nothing or anyone and is willing to use violence and crime without any limits.\u201d But he did not identify the enemy, and the remark brought rebukes from celebrities, politicians and soccer players.\n\n\u201cA war needs two sides,\u201d Chilean soccer player Gary Medel said on Twitter. \u201cAnd here, we\u2019re just one people who want equality.\u201d\n\nPi\u00f1era, a billionaire and former airline owner then switched to a more conciliatory tone. He said that the government is working on a reconstruction plan to cover the hundreds of millions of dollars in damaged infrastructure. Pi\u00f1era also planned meetings with the opposition to explore a \u201csocial agreement\u201d to solve \u201cthe problems that affect Chileans.\u201d\n\nBut some leftist parties said they would boycott the meeting with Pi\u00f1era to protest the nearly 10,000 soldiers patrolling the streets, part of a curfew that brings back haunting memories.\n\nAt least 3,095 suspected leftists were killed during Gen. Augusto Pinochet\u2019s 1973-1990 military dictatorship, according to government figures, and tens of thousands more were tortured or jailed for political reasons.\n\nMost of the demonstrations have been peaceful, with people banging on pots, a common form of protest in the region.\n\nThe government says that some marches have been infiltrated by violent groups of hooded vandals who seek to destabilize the country.\n\nRiot police also used tear gas on Tuesday to break up a group of people who tried to loot a supermarket in the Chilean capital while screaming mothers tried to get milk for their children, according to local Radio Cooperativa.\n\nAbout 2 million students were also forced to stay homes from classes and many people were unable to arrive to their jobs.\n\n__\n\nHenao reported from Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Chile's government said Tuesday that 15 people have been killed in five days of rioting, arson and violent clashes that have almost paralyzed the South American country and rocked its global image as the region's oasis of stability.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Eva Vergara", "Luis Andres Henao"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/22/chile_protests_15186_c0-280-6720-4200_s1200x700.jpg?549b535615f604a464414eea45420bce1df5565c", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
