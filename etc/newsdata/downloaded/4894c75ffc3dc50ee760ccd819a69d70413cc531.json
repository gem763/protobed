He took to Twitter to make threats, inflame his base ahead of the event and lash out at me and the diverse city I represent.\u201d\n\nFrey added that at the moment, the matter \u201cremains a stand-off,\u201d with the booking agent still seeking payment from Trump\u2019s campaign as the city of Minneapolis continues to seek reimbursement.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nTrump accused the Minneapolis mayor last week of trying to \"price out\" free speech with the massive $530,000 bill.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "The mayor of Minneapolis defended his pursuit of Trump reimbursing the city for over $500,000 following the president's campaign rally on Thursday.", "authors": ["Matthew Mcnulty"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/AP19284049539932-e1570987622211.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
