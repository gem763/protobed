Longtime Epstein employees Richard Kahn and lawyer Darren K. Indyke\u2014the executors of his estate\u2014are named as defendants, too.\n\nAraoz first came forward in July, days after Epstein was arrested for child sex-trafficking. In an interview with NBC\u2019s Today show, Araoz said the financier began abusing her in New York when she was 14 and forcibly raped her when she was 15.\n\nShe filed a lawsuit against Epstein before his jailhouse suicide in August, and she was the first accuser to sue Epstein\u2019s estate after his death.\n\nAraoz says a young woman recruited her into Epstein\u2019s sickening orbit in 2001, when she was standing outside her performing arts high school\u2014which was just blocks away from Epstein\u2019s mansion on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side.\n\nThe unnamed recruiter told Araoz she knew a \u201cgreat guy\u201d who believed in helping people, and the two women eventually visited Epstein\u2019s palatial home.\n\nGroff and Espinosa were employees Araoz met there, the lawsuit alleges.\n\nGroff was in her 30s and Epstein\u2019s \u201csecretary\u201d when she facilitated his child sex ring, the amended complaint alleges. According to court papers, Groff \u201cwas one of the people in charge of scheduling for all Epstein\u2019s owned and/or controlled companies, foundations and trusts.\u201d\n\nAn attorney for Groff recently told The Daily Beast that she never engaged in any misconduct during her tenure with Epstein.\n\nGroff, now 52, lives in Fairfield County, Connecticut, and is Facebook friends with Espinosa, according to a recent review of social media.\n\nEspinosa, who lives in California, is also accused of coordinating Araoz\u2019s visits to Epstein\u2019s New York mansion.\n\nThe 52-year-old was listed in Epstein\u2019s infamous Little Black Book of contacts under the business \u201cEpstein Interests,\u201d which was located at 457 Madison Avenue.\n\nShe even has the Epstein-related job experience listed on her LinkedIn page.\n\n\u201c In order to help you with your modeling career, I will need to see your body. \u201d \u2014 Jeffrey Epstein, to a 14-year-old victim\n\nAccording to the online resume, she was \u201cexecutive assistant to the president/CEO\u201d of NES, LLC, a corporation registered in New York and which lists Epstein\u2019s Virgin Islands address, from October 1996 to January 2003.\n\nEspinosa indicates she was a \u201ckey contact for all business and personal communications for this high profile, high net worth Entrepreneur.\u201d\n\nHer duties included: \u201cmaintain all scheduling and appointments\u201d and \u201crecruited, managed and coordinated a staff of approximately 40 people for 7 personal estates worldwide, including executing background checks and confidentiality agreements.\u201d\n\nShe also \u201cmanage[d] 11 corporate apartments, including guest arrivals,\u201d her LinkedIn page states.\n\nAccording to the amended lawsuit, when the recruiter first brought Araoz to Epstein\u2019s mansion, they were taken to Groff\u2019s office to wait. Epstein\u2019s maid, Lynn Fontanilla, who died in 2016, then offered Araoz cheese, crackers and wine.\n\nAt the time, Araoz says, she informed Groff and Fontanilla she was a freshman in high school who had dreams of becoming a singer and actress.\n\nAraoz claims she and the recruiter would drop by Epstein\u2019s home about once or twice a week for the first month. During these visits, Groff would hand Araoz $300 in cash and say Epstein \u201cwanted to help her out,\u201d the complaint alleges.\n\nBut during Araoz\u2019s visit alone with Epstein, the financier molested her after ordering her to remove her top and give him a massage.\n\n\u201c There were also two assistants of Epstein that would call Ms. Araoz from Epstein\u2019s office to schedule these sexual encounters. \u201d\n\nGroff had contacted Araoz directly to schedule this first solo visit, which resulted in the sexual abuse, the complaint states.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll bet your body is incredible,\u201d Epstein told Araoz after escorting her to the massage room, which was on an upper floor of the townhouse. \u201cIn order to help you with your modeling career, I will need to see your body.\u201d\n\nEpstein said she\u2019d \u201cdo great\u201d in the modeling industry and that his connections could help launch her career.\n\nThis visit quickly turned sexual, when Epstein told Araoz to take off her shirt and groped her chest.\n\n\u201cHe then asked her if she was good at giving massages, and considering all of the financial help he had been giving her family over the past month, insinuated that he would like one,\u201d the complaint alleges.\n\nEpstein, who changed into a towel, laid on the message table and ordered Araoz to massage his back. After 20 minutes, he suddenly turned over, removed his towel and began masturbating.\n\nEpstein paid her $300 in cash before she was escorted out of the mansion.\n\n\u201cGoing forward, sometimes Epstein would call Ms. Araoz directly, but primarily Ms. Groff would call, email and/or page Ms. Araoz, not necessarily in that order, but they would speak on the phone and she would give her instructions for her next sexual encounter with Epstein,\u201d the complaint alleges.\n\n\u201cThere were also two assistants of Epstein that would call Ms. Araoz from Epstein\u2019s office to schedule these sexual encounters,\u201d the lawsuit states, adding: \u201cOne of those assistants was Ms. Espinosa, who Ms. Araoz would see at the property after speaking to.\u201d\n\nAraoz\u2019s lawyers, Dan Kaiser and Kimberly Lerner, held a press conference Tuesday to announce the first amended complaint filed Tuesday.\n\nKaiser said Epstein\u2019s corporate entities were now defendants because Epstein used them to \u201cfurther the sex-trafficking conspiracy that extended over decades.\u201d\n\nHe said Groff and Espinosa \u201cwere deeply involved in the scheduling of appointments\u201d and \u201cmanaging the flow of girls\u201d into Epstein\u2019s lair.\n\nIn a 2005 New York Times article on executive assistants, Epstein boasted of having a three-woman executive team that included Groff.\n\n\u201cCiting scientific studies, he calls them a \u2018social prosthesis,\u2019 whereby their intuitive knowledge of his needs and their 24-hour presence make them virtually indispensable to his success,\u201d states the article, written by Landon Thomas Jr. (This year, it was revealed Thomas became friends with Epstein and solicited money from the multi-millionaire for a Harlem cultural center.)\n\n\u201cThey are an extension of my brain,\u201d Epstein told the Times . \u201cTheir intuition is something that I don\u2019t have.\u201d\n\nThe article states that when Groff became pregnant, he bought her a Mercedes-Benz and a full-time nanny so she wouldn\u2019t stop working for him.\n\n\u201cThere is no way that I could lose Lesley to motherhood,\u201d Epstein said.\n\nThe complaint also seeks to void the transfer of assets Epstein made shortly before his suicide on Aug. 10, in order to shield them from claims made by victims, Kaiser said.\n\nKaiser said one key player in Epstein\u2019s world, British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, hasn\u2019t responded to their original lawsuit against her.\n\nThe law firm\u2019s investigators haven\u2019t been able to track Maxwell down, and Maxwell\u2019s attorneys in other civil cases \u201care not prepared to accept service on her behalf,\u201d Kaiser said.\n\n\u201cWe have reason to believe the FBI knows her location,\u201d Lerner added, \u201cso we may know sooner than later.\u201d", "description": "Jennifer Araoz, who was raped by Epstein as a teenager, has accused two of the financier's assistants of facilitating her abuse in an amended lawsuit against his estate.", "authors": ["Kate Briquelet", "Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_3780,w_6720,x_0,y_518/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570560299/100819-Briquelet-epsteinexpress_un4vdj", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
