But by the end of the episode everybody\u2019s thoughts will have been on Ric Griffin (Hugh Quarshie) and his decision to have super-risky surgery to remove his brain tumour.\n\nSerena heard about this surgery from Max and Ric, without realising that Ric was the patient under discussion. She said she would advise the patient whose MRI scan they were looking at \u2018not to start any box sets.\u2019 When Ric told her it was his scan they were looking at she was mortified. She tried to persuade him not to have the surgery, which has never before been successfully tried on a human. \u2018I don\u2019t want my friend to be a dead guinea pig,\u2019 she said. \u2018If I can\u2019t be a surgeon, what is the reason for my existence?\u2019 he argued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe were left in no doubt that if anyone can do it, Max can. She was at Holby to see a patient of hers (Max is currently a neuro consultant at The Mythical St James\u2019s, but we already know that Jo Martin is joining the Holby cast soon so expect an offer from the equally mythical Holby HR department very soon). The patient had long term neurological problems and more recent appendicitis, which meant Serena and Max had to work together \u2013 and the tension between them was highly amusing to watch. We also got to see at first hand that Max is a brilliant surgeon who is ice cool in a crisis. Exactly what we need if Ric is going to have any chance at all.\n\nMeanwhile, Essie was shocked when Isla\u2019s mother Frankie (Sophie Harkness) returned unexpectedly. She said she had her life sorted out, including a job in Birmingham, and she was now ready to take Isla back. This wouldn\u2019t have been great news for Essie at the best of times because she\u2019s become so attached to Isla, but she noticed that Frankie was ravenously hungry and also had some injuries which could have been caused by Connor, Isla\u2019s father. Essie wasn\u2019t happy to let Isla go under those circumstances. It was Sacha (Bob Barrett) who got through to Frankie and made her realise that she still wasn\u2019t in a position to take care of a baby, so Isla is still in Essie\u2019s care for now.\n\nStill holding on to Isla (Picture: BBC)\n\nJac was back from a trip to Disneyland with Emma, and she seemed in an unusually mellow and happy mood. She didn\u2019t even mind when Fletch (Alex Walkinshaw) and Nicky (Belinda Owusu) used a picture of her dressed as Elsa from Frozen as a screensaver. This sunny mood didn\u2019t last long, though. We heard that Emma had spent most of the time they were away talking to Jonny and his wife Stacey on the phone. Then Jac got a call and told Kian (Ramin Karimloo) she\u2019d have to go as Emma\u2019s babysitter had double-booked herself \u2013 but on her way out she was apologising to someone and saying she never messes up like this. What\u2019s going on?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCameron (Nic Jackman) was feeling the pressure already, as it was the day his mum\u2019s body was being returned to the UK and he had another funeral to arrange. Still eaten up with guilt over the way he stood by and let Evan die, he was further upset by Chloe asking him about Evan\u2019s death. She hadn\u2019t known that Cameron was present at the time and thought he\u2019d died alone. \u2018Was he in any pain?\u2019 she wanted to know. \u2018In my opinion, not nearly enough,\u2019 was his honest reply.\n\nSue Haasler is the author of the official Holby City book, which you can read about here.
