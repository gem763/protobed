Raul Grijalva leading charge to prevent Trump admin. from drilling near the Grand Canyon", "language": "en", "text": "Democratic Rep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva of Arizona has submitted a bill to prevent the Trump administration from mining near the Grand Canyon.\n\nMr. Grijalva, chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, said the bill would ban mining throughout all federal land in Arizona because he wants to ward off the \u201cimminent threat\u201d of drilling near the nation\u2019s iconic national park.\n\nThe full House will vote Wednesday on the bill.\n\n\u201cFundamentally \u2026 this is what we need to be doing to deal with climate change in our public lands \u2014 to begin to reduce the extraction and promote the conservation side of it,\u201d Mr. Grijalva told The Hill.\n\nMr. Grijalva said the legislation is intended to protect the natural wonder from recommendations from a White House Uranium Mining Group, which could suggest drilling near parts of the national park.\n\n\u201cBefore the working group, the motivation for this was: We\u2019ve wanted to do this for a long time, even during [the Obama administration]. But then the motivation became: They\u2019re going to lift the moratorium,\u201d the congressman said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always felt that we could wait these people out and then get back to it when we had an administration to work with. But then it was verified for us when we saw the working group. And then I said, \u2018Yeah, it\u2019s pretty real,\u2019 \u201d he added.\n\nIn 2017, Mr. Trump appeared to favor uranium mining by declaring it as a critical element for national security uses \u2014 a view shared by other uranium mining and utility companies, who have said continuing to buy uranium overseas could risk national security.\n\nIn September, the Trump administration attempted to open more than 40,000 acres of an Alaskan national forest for logging before it was blocked by a federal judge.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
