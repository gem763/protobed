And as they both took the world stage at the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, they shared something else: gathering political clouds back home in their capitals.\n\nIn Washington, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, was convening a meeting with the entire House Democratic caucus amid rising momentum for impeachment, after revelations that Mr. Trump pressed Ukraine\u2019s president for dirt on his leading Democratic rival, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., while blocking American aid to Kiev.\n\nMr. Trump has acknowledged raising questions about Mr. Biden and accusations of corruption with Ukraine\u2019s new president, Volodymyr Zelensky, in a July 25 telephone call. He also personally ordered his staff to freeze more than $391 million in aid to Ukraine in the days before he pressed Mr. Zelensky to investigate Mr. Biden.\n\nThe timing of the decision to block the aid and Mr. Trump\u2019s involvement, which were first reported by The Washington Post, further fueled the intense debate over the president\u2019s effort to persuade Ukraine to examine unsubstantiated corruption accusations involving Mr. Biden and his son Hunter Biden.", "description": "President Trump and Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain, leaders who share an affinity and style of politics, are attending the United Nations General Assembly with domestic troubles at home.", "authors": ["Peter Baker", "Megan Specia"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/24/world/24trump-johnson/24UNGA-live3-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
