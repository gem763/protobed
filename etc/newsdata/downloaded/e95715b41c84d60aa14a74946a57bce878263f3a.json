The Guardian first reported on the existence of the firm in December 2015.\n\nCSPAN (@cspan) \"So, you won't take down lies or you will take down lies? I think that's just a pretty simple yes or no.\"\n\n\n\nComplete exchange between @RepAOC @AOC and Mark Zuckerberg at today's House Financial Services Cmte hearing.\n\n\n\nFull video here: https://t.co/heT7Psnlp1 pic.twitter.com/0iiWtfU5gQ\n\nZuckerberg claimed on Wednesday that he learned of Cambridge Analytica \u201caround the time [the news] became public \u2026 around March of 2018\u201d. Ocasio-Cortez asked if anybody on Zuckerberg\u2019s leadership team knew about the firm prior to the report published by the Guardian on 11 December 2015.\n\n\u201cI believe some folks were tracking it internally,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cI do think I was aware of Cambridge Analytica as an entity earlier, but I don\u2019t know if I was tracking how they were using Facebook specifically.\u201d\n\nOcasio-Cortez went on to ask the executive about Facebook\u2019s policy on exempting political advertising from fact-checking, asking if she could pay to advertise an incorrect election date to people in a primarily black zip code, for example.\n\nZuckerberg said Facebook does support removing content in cases of violence or of census or voter suppression. He did not answer whether the company would take down outright lies if they were in political advertisements.\n\n'You're trying to help drug dealers': Zuckerberg faces angry lawmakers at Libra hearing Read more\n\nThis month, the company declined to take down a Trump campaign ad that included a misleading portrayal of the former vice-president Joe Biden\u2019s work in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cDo you see a potential problem here with a complete lack of fact-checking on political advertisements?\u201d Ocasio-Cortez asked.\n\nShe also asked Zuckerberg about his \u201cdinner parties with far-right figures\u201d and if at those meetings he addressed the popular rightwing theory that Facebook cracks down on conservative speech, a question Zuckerberg also dodged.\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s testimony marked the first time he has appeared before Congress since April 2018, when he spoke at a hearing regarding Cambridge Analytica. The executive repeatedly acknowledged Facebook\u2019s mistakes during the questioning on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI get that I\u2019m not the ideal messenger for this right now. We\u2019ve faced a lot of issues over the past few years and I\u2019m sure there are a lot of people who wish it were anyone but Facebook that was helping to propose this,\u201d he said.", "description": "Democratic lawmaker challenges Facebook CEO during hearing over Libra cryptocurrency", "authors": ["Kari Paul"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbf98a23815b2a2635cddaf2f9e555b316f4620d/0_0_6384_3830/master/6384.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ea290ead43cc0f623688d103b4ed6b55", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
