[Photo/Agencies]\n\nCANBERRA - The body representing Australian surgeons has called for the legalization of cannabis in the nation's capital to be repealed.\n\nThe Royal Australasian College of Surgeons (RACS) warned that laws legalizing cannabis in small quantities for personal use will lead to more deaths and injuries on the road.\n\nIt comes as the federal government considers whether to intervene to overturn the laws, which will allow the possession of up to 50 grams of cannabis and a maximum of four cannabis plants per household in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) from January 2020.\n\nJohn Crozier, a member of the RACS, said that the ACT should heed the warning of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development Michael McCormack who described the laws as crazy.\n\nAccording to The Canberra Times on Tuesday, Crozier said surgeons witnessed the carnage from road crashes every day and were \"duty-bound to speak with concern.\"\n\n\"The college has been absolutely consistent over many many years, chilled by the evidence of the coroners' courts and with the knowledge of what we deal with within the walls of our hospitals every day,\" he said.\n\n\"We know as day follows night, people who drive at under the influence of cannabinoids are at risk of death and serious injury to themselves, and critically to other road users.\"\n\nThe RACS did not make a submission to an inquiry held by the ACT Legislative Assembly before the laws were passed in September but the Australian Medical Association did make a submission opposing the legalization of cannabis.", "description": "The body representing Australian surgeons has called for the legalization of cannabis in the nation's capital to be repealed.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/08/5d9c2d53a310cf3e97a01536.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
