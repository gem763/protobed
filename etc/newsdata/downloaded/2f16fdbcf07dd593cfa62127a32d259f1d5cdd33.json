WOCHIT\n\nHUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. \u2013 Five people were hurt and revelers scrambled for safety when a series of explosions in an underground electrical vault sent flames shooting into the sky during an Oktoberfest celebration at a German-themed shopping and dining complex in Southern California, authorities said Sunday.\n\nThe first blast blew a vault door off its hinges and knocked several people to the ground after firefighters responded to reports of a possible electrical fire Saturday evening at Old World Village in Huntington Beach, witnesses and officials said.\n\nTwo firefighters and two restaurant employees were treated for minor injuries, according to Battalion Chief Jeff Lopez with the city\u2019s fire department.\n\n'He's a hero'\n\nBernie Bischoff, the owner of Old World restaurant, was seriously hurt, Oktoberfest spokesman Dan Escamilla said.\n\nHe was hospitalized in \u201crough shape,\u201d with second- and third-degree burns to 38% of his body, Escamilla told the Long Beach Press-Telegram.\n\nBischoff had evacuated the dining area about 40 minutes before the blast, after noticing an odd smell from the area of the vaults, he said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a hero,\u201d Escamilla said, adding that more people could have been hurt if the dining area had been full.\n\nManhunt underway: 4 dead, 5 others injured in shooting at Kansas City bar\n\nThe first explosion splattered heated mineral oil used to cool the transformers and possibly ignited subsequent blasts, authorities said at a press conference. The cause is under investigation.\n\nWitnesses said they heard as many as three explosions coming from the annual celebration about 35 miles south of downtown Los Angeles.\n\nDallas shooting trial: Key witness in ex-officer Amber Guyger\u2019s murder trial shot and killed\n\nMegan Houck, 26, said she saw flames come up from the floor near a patio area.\n\n\u201cIt was just like one giant fireball that went up,\u201d she told the Press Telegram. \u201cAnd then there was a second explosion maybe 10 or 20 seconds later.\u201d\n\nHouck said the flames went well above the roof of the village, up to 40 feet in the air.\n\nRevelers, some wearing traditional German costumes including lederhosen, ran from the scene as police evacuated the complex.\n\nSouthern California Edison crews worked through the night to replace three damaged transformers in the vault and restore power, spokesman Robert Villegas said. As many as 1,700 customers lost electricity, he said.\n\nPat Brassil, 27, said he was outside one of the Oktoberfest tents when he saw flames shoot out from another tent near the festival\u2019s entrance.\n\n\u201cIt just lit up the sky,\u201d he told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cEveryone was going pretty crazy and screaming.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/10/06/oktoberfest-explosion-huntington-beach-california-5-injured/3891325002/", "description": "Bernie Bischoff, the owner of Old World restaurant, evacuated the dining area about 40 minutes before the blast, after noticing an odd smell.", "authors": ["Associated Press", "Published P.M.
