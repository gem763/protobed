We welcome its findings and thank Dr Willie Stewart for diligently leading this important research.\n\n\u201cThe whole game must recognise that this is only the start of our understanding and there are many questions that still need to be answered. It is important that the global football family now unites to find the answers and provide a greater understanding of this complex issue. The FA is committed to doing all it can to make that happen.\"", "description": "The study, led by the University of Glasgow, revealed the impact on the health of former footballers", "authors": ["Liam Prenderville", "Image", "Getty", "Getty Images Eyeem", "Mirrorpix"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article16549890.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Jumping-to-head-the-ball.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
