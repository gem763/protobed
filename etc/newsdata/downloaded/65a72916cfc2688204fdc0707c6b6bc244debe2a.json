The rear of the bus is the heaviest part of the vehicle, the agency added, since that is where its engine is located.\n\nPhotographs posted to social media by Pittsburgh Public Safety show a blue Kia Optima with its two front tires hanging over the hole, with its driver seemingly escaping serious injury by inches. In a follow-up tweet, officials said the sedan was safely removed from the scene after crews arrived.\n\nAt the time of the accident, only the driver and a single passenger were aboard the bus. The passenger experienced minor injuries and was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment, officials said.\n\n\u201cTwo people on \u2066@PGHtransit bus, one transported to hospital [with] minor injuries,\u201d read a tweet from Pittsburgh Public Safety on Monday. \u201cKids at Small World child care evacuated to Westin, and are happy and safe.

Once the liquid accumulates underground, it erodes rock and minerals.\n\n\u201cAs more soil washes down (over years or maybe just days), the void space moves toward the surface until it can\u2019t hold together anymore,\u201d the department\u2019s website explains.\n\nThis creates a hole that can eventually grow large enough that the ground above it collapses \u2014 resulting in a sinkhole.\n\nPittsburgh Public Safety Dept/Twitter More\n\nRELATED: Large Texas Sinkhole Swallows Sheriff\u2019s Deputy\u2019s Car \u2014 Killing Her in \u2018Terrible Tragedy\u2019\n\n\u201cWhen it collapses (or subsides), you see the sinkhole on the surface,\u201d they added. \u201cOften, you can only see soil in the hole and not the actual hole in the rock itself because the rock is too far below.\u201d\n\nTwo cranes were en route to the area to hoist the large bus from the opening, Pittsburgh Public Safety tweeted Monday morning, but because the vehicle landed on power lines, the city will have to temporarily cut power in the area during its removal.", "description": "Sinkhole Devours Half a City Bus in Downtown Pittsburgh", "authors": ["Jason Duaine Hahn"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/oxEOcJuIbE0u.ASVyXXZmA--~B/aD0xODAwO3c9MjcwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/1f1a3d62b255bb2b50cfba01ebc252fb", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
