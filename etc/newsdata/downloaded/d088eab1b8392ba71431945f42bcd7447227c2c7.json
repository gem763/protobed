The first two hosted 20 candidates over the course of two nights, but the third only saw 10 candidates take the stage due to stricter Democratic National Committee guidelines. Twelve will take the stage during October's debate.\n\nAs the field narrows, here is a look at the current 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls:\n\nMichael Bennet, 54\n\nMichael Bennet has served as a US senator from Colorado since 2009. Bennet, a former head of the Denver school district, carved out a profile as a wonky, policy-oriented senator.\n\nHe gained internet fame this year for a harsh scolding of Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas over the government shutdown.\n\nBennet was close to launching a presidential campaign after that, but had to pause it when he was diagnosed with prostate cancer.\n\nBennet's office said last month that the senator was successfully treated. That cleared the way for his May 2 campaign launch.\n\nBennet has so far only made the debate stage twice, during the first and second debates. He failed to qualify for the September and October debates.\n\nJoe Biden, 76\n\nJoe Biden served as vice president under former President Barack Obama from 2009 to 2017 after nearly four decades serving as a senator from Delaware.\n\nBiden is the most experienced politician in the race, and the among the oldest at 76. This will be his third presidential run. His first White House bid in 1987 ended after a plagiarism scandal.\n\nIn a video announcement of his candidacy posted on Twitter on April 25, Biden focused on the 2017 deadly clash between white supremacists and counterprotesters in Charlottesville, Virginia. Biden noted US President Donald Trump's comments that there were some \"very fine people\" on both sides of the violent encounter, which left one woman dead.\n\n\"We are in the battle for the soul of this nation,\" Biden said. \"If we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation - who we are. And I cannot stand by and watch that happen.\"\n\nLast month, Biden struggled to respond to comments from Lucy Flores, a 2014 lieutenant governor nominee in Nevada, who said he made her uncomfortable by touching her shoulders and kissing the back of her head before a campaign event. Several other women have made similar claims.\n\nIn a video, Biden pledged to be \"more mindful\" of respecting \"personal space\", but Flores told Fox News this week that the former senator's jokes on the matter have been \"so incredibly disrespectful\".\n\nThe incident is just a glimpse of the harsh vetting from both Democrats and Republicans expected for Biden, who has run for president twice before but never from such a strong political starting position.\n\nIn recent months, he was repeatedly forced to explain his 1991 decision, as Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, to allow Anita Hill to face questions about her allegations of sexual harassment against Clarence Thomas, then a nominee for the Supreme Court.\n\nBiden has since apologised for his role in the hearing. But in the #MeToo era, it is another example of why critics believe he may struggle to catch on with the Democratic primary voters of 2020.\n\nBiden has also become a prominent figure in the House of Representatives impeachment inquiry of Trump. That probe is centred on a July 25 phone call in which Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden and his businessman son, Hunter.\n\nDemocrats have accused Trump of pressuring Ukraine to find incriminating information on Biden after withholding nearly $400m in US security aid to Ukraine. There has been no evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens.\n\nBiden has called for Trump's impeachment.\n\nAs the frontrunner, Biden has made all four debate stages during this campaign season.\n\nCory Booker, 49\n\nCory Booker has served as a US senator from New Jersey - the first African American in the state's history to hold the office - since 2013. He was the mayor of Newark from 2006 to 2013.\n\nHis entry into the Democratic primary was steeped in history and symbolism, befitting his status as the second black candidate in an historically diverse field. Invoking the legacy of the national movements for civil rights and for women's suffrage, the New Jersey senator during his candidacy announcement urged a return to a \"common sense of purpose\".\n\nBooker could face difficulty winning the hearts of the progressive Democratic base due to his past financial ties to banking and pharmaceutical interests. He said he would stop taking contributions from pharmaceutical companies in 2017.\n\nHe announced his presidential bid on February 1.\n\nAs for the debates, Booker has qualified for all four events so far.\n\nSteven Bullock, 53\n\nThe Democratic governor of Montana, re-elected in 2016 in a conservative state that Trump carried by 20 percentage points, has touted his electability and ability to work across party lines.\n\nBullock, 53, has made campaign finance reform a cornerstone of his agenda, and emphasises his success in forging compromises with the Republican-led state legislature on bills to expand Medicaid, increase campaign finance disclosures, bolster pay equity for women and protect public lands.\n\nBullock failed to make the debate stage in June, but did so in July. Due to the stricter guidelines for the September and October events, however, he did not qualify.\n\nPete Buttigieg, 37\n\nPete Buttigieg has served as mayor of South Bend, Indiana, since 2012.\n\nBefore that, Buttigieg was a consultant for McKinsey and company.\n\nHe is the first openly gay Democratic candidate to run for president. He announced his presidential bid on January 23, 2019.\n\nThere are no policy positions on his website. He has virtually no paid presence in the states that matter most. And his campaign manager is a high-school friend with no experience in presidential politics.\n\nDespite this, he has suddenly become one of the hottest names in the Democrats' presidential primary season. On the campaign trail, he has frequently spoken about the struggle to legalise same-sex marriage.\n\nHe has also repeatedly criticised Vice President Mike Pence for his views that undermine LGBTQ rights.\n\n\"I'm not critical of his faith; I'm critical of bad policies. I don't have a problem with religion. I'm religious, too. I have a problem with religion being used as a justification to harm people and especially in the LGBTQ community,\" the Indiana Democrat said in an interview with NBC's The Ellen DeGeneres Show this month.\n\nButtigieg's moment may pass if he does not take swift action to build a national organisation capable of harnessing the energy, he will need to sustain his surge in the nine months or so before the first votes are cast.\n\nButtigieg has qualified for all four debates so far.\n\nJulian Castro, 44\n\nJulian Castro was elected mayor of San Antonio, Texas in 2009 and served until 2014.\n\nHe served as the 16th US secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) under US President Barack Obama from 2014 until 2017.\n\nCastro, the grandson of Mexican immigrants, was raised by a local Latina activist, and after a brief career in law, he was elected mayor of the nation's seventh-largest city at the age of 34.\n\nIt was not long after that election that Democrats nationally embraced him as a star in the making, particularly one from Texas, where a booming Hispanic population is rapidly changing the state's demographics and improving the party's fortunes.\n\nHe announced his presidential run on January 12, 2019.\n\nAs for the debates, Castro has made all four events so far.\n\nJohn Delaney, 56\n\nJohn Delaney served as a US congressman for Maryland's sixth district from 2013 to 2019.\n\nDelaney, a former banking entrepreneur, is known as politically moderate with a willingness to reach across the aisle.\n\nHe has supported a measure to raise money to build infrastructure by allowing US corporations to avoid taxes when they repatriate profits overseas if they buy bonds that would be used to build infrastructure.\n\nHe announced his presidential run in a Washington Post op-ed published on July 28, 2017.\n\nDelaney, one of the wealthiest members of Congress, was the first to announce he will seek his party's nomination in 2020.\n\nHe said he was entering the presidential race early because he knows he will need time to build name recognition.\n\nHe failed to qualify for the first debate, but was able to do so for the second. He could not, however, meet the guidelines for the third and fourth debates.\n\nTulsi Gabbard, 38\n\nTusi Gabbard has served as a US congresswoman from Hawaii's second district since 2013.\n\nGabbard is the first Hindu member of Congress. At the age of 21, she became the youngest to be elected to a US state legislature serving on the Hawaii House of Representatives.\n\nShe has also served in the Hawaii Army National Guard in a combat zone in Iraq and was deployed to Kuwait.\n\nShe was a fierce opponent of same-sex marriage when she served in the state legislature in her 20s. But she has since disavowed those views and professes her support for LGBTQ rights.\n\nCritics have pounced on her efforts to block the legalisation of same-sex marriage in Hawaii and a meeting she held with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Earlier this year, she penned an op-ed responding to media reports about her alleged ties to Hindu nationalists.\n\n\"While the headlines covering my announcement could have celebrated this landmark first, and maybe even informed Americans about the world's third-largest religion, some have instead fomented suspicion, fear and religious bigotry about not only me but also my supporters,\" she wrote.\n\nGabbard officially launched her presidential campaign on February 2, 2019.\n\nAs for the debates, Gabbard qualified for the first two debates, but failed to do so for the third. She did qualify, however, for the October event.\n\nKamala Harris, 54\n\nKamala Harris has served as a US senator from California since 2017.\n\nBefore joining the Senate, Harris was the attorney general of California. She has also served as San Francisco district attorney.\n\nHer track record as San Francisco's district attorney and California's attorney general has drawn scrutiny in a Democratic Party that has shifted in recent years on criminal justice issues.\n\nHarris is the daughter of immigrants from Jamaica and India.\n\nShe supports a middle-class tax credit, Medicare for All healthcare funding reform, the Green New Deal and the legalisation of cannabis.\n\nShe launched her presidential run on January 21, 2019.\n\nHarris has qualified for all four debates so far.\n\nAmy Klobuchar, 58\n\nAmy Klobuchar served as a US senator from Minnesota since 2007, becoming her state's first elected female senator.\n\nBefore joining the Senate, she was the Hennepin County lawyer.\n\nKlobuchar gained national attention in 2018 when she sparred with Brett Kavanaugh during Senate hearings for his Supreme Court nomination.\n\nShe announced her presidential run on February 10, 2019.\n\nOn the campaign trail, the former prosecutor and corporate lawyer supports an alternative to traditional Medicare healthcare funding and is taking a hard stance against rising prescription drug prices.\n\nShe has qualified for all four debates so far.\n\nWayne Messam, 44\n\nWayne Messam has served as mayor of Miramar, Florida, since 2015.\n\nMessam grew up in South Bay, an agricultural town of 3,500 people, adjoining Lake Okeechobee. His parents emigrated from Jamaica.\n\nMessam believes Miramar has much that the rest of the US would like to have: environmentally friendly development, high-end manufacturing and major corporate operations.\n\nPundits have said he is unlikely to win due to low name recognition and funding. No sitting mayor has ever won the presidency and he has a lack of political experience.\n\nOn March 28, 2019, he announced he was running for president.\n\nMessam has failed so far to make a single debate stage.\n\nBeto O'Rourke, 46\n\nBeto O'Rourke served Texas's 16th congressional district in the House of Representatives from 2013 to 2019.\n\nO'Rourke gained fame last year for his record fundraising and ability to draw crowds before of his unexpectedly narrow loss in the US Senate race against Republican incumbent Ted Cruz.\n\nHis Senate bid generated a torrent of media attention and excited voters in a party desperate for fresh political faces. He lost the race by fewer than three percentage points, the tightest senate contest in the state in four decades.\n\nO'Rourke announced a $6.1m fundraising haul for the first 24 hours of his campaign, bettering his Democratic opponents.\n\nSince his Senate bid ended, O'Rourke has worked to keep himself in the public eye, regularly staying in touch with his supporters and sitting for an interview with Oprah Winfrey.\n\nBut with progressive policies and diversity at the forefront of the party's nominating battle, O'Rourke will face a challenge as a wealthy white man who is more moderate on several key issues than many of his competitors.\n\nHe announced his presidential bid on March 14, 2019.\n\nHe has met the threshold for all four debates so far.\n\nTim Ryan, 45\n\nRyan has served as a US House representative from Ohio's 13th district since 2003.\n\nHe represents a northeastern Ohio area that has reportedly lost manufacturing jobs in the past few years and shifted to Republican Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nRyan has said Trump has turned his back on those blue-collar voters who fled to him in 2016 and failed to live up his promise to revitalise the manufacturing industry.\n\nRyan pledged to create jobs in new technologies and to focus on public education and access to affordable healthcare.\n\nHe first gained national attention when he unsuccessfully tried to unseat Nancy Pelosi as the House Democratic leader in 2016, arguing it was time for new leadership.\n\nRyan announced his presidential run on April 4, 2019.\n\nHe qualified for the first two debates, but failed to do so for the September and October events.\n\nBernie Sanders, 77\n\nBernie Sanders served as a US representative for 16 years before being elected to the Senate in 2006 where he currently represents the state of Vermont.\n\nA progressive and cofounder of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, he is the longest-serving Independent in the history of Congress.\n\nSanders announced his presidential run on February 19, 2019. Sanders ran an unsuccessful bid for president in 2016 after losing to Hillary Clinton.\n\nIn the 2020 race, Sanders will have to fight to stand out in a packed field of progressives touting issues he brought into the Democratic Party mainstream four years ago.\n\nHis proposals include free tuition at public colleges, a $15 minimum hourly wage and universal healthcare.\n\nHe benefits from strong name recognition and a robust network of small-dollar donors, helping him to raise $5.9m during his first day in the contest.\n\nSince then, he has qualified for all the debates held so far.\n\nJoe Sestak, 67\n\nFormer US Representative Joe Sestak joined the race in June.\n\nIn announcing his candidacy, Sestak, 67, a retired three-star US Navy admiral, emphasized his 31-year military career, the need to restore US leadership in the world and challenges from climate change and China's growing global influence.\n\n\"Our country desperately needs a president with a depth of global experience and an understanding of all the elements of our nation's power, from our economy and our diplomacy to the power of our ideals and our military, including its limitations,\" Sestak said in a video released on his campaign website.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Joe Sestak speaks during the West Des Moines Democrats' annual picnic [File: Charlie Neibergall/AP Photo]\n\nSestak represented a district in eastern Pennsylvania including the former industrial cities of Allentown and Bethlehem for two terms from 2007 to 2011.\n\nHe ran for the US Senate in 2010 and lost to Republican Pat Toomey in a year that saw Republicans take control of the House of Representatives. Sestak sought a rematch with Toomey in 2016 but lost in the Democratic primary.\n\nSestak has yet to qualify for a debate.\n\nTom Steyer, 62\n\nTom Steyer, a billionaire donor and liberal activist, announced on July 9 he was joining the Democratic presidential field after initially saying he would not run to focus his attention on impeaching Trump and getting fellow Democrats elected to Congress.\n\n\"There's a breakdown in Washington DC, and I don't mean just Donald Trump,\" Steyer tweeted in a thread announcing his candidacy. \"I'm talking about corporate money and our broken political system.\"\n\nThe 62-year-old is one of the most visible and deep-pocketed liberals advocating for Trump's impeachment. But he has previously said he has grown frustrated at the pace at which the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives is approaching Trump.\n\nTom Steyer, founder of NextGen Climate, speaks during the California Democratic Convention in San Francisco, California [File: Stephen Lam/Reuters]\n\nHis announcement made no mention of impeachment issue, instead focusing on why he believes there is a need to reduce the influence of corporations in politics. He also said he plans to target climate change, which is the focus of the Steyer-backed advocacy group NextGen America.\n\nCiting issues including climate change and the opioid crisis, Steyer said that in nearly every \"major intractable problem, at the back of it, you see a big-money interest for whom stopping progress, stopping justice is really important to their bottom line.\"\n\nSteyer announced his presidential bid after the first presidential debate in June. He failed to make the debate stage in July and September. He did, however, qualify for the October event.\n\nElizabeth Warren, 69\n\nElizabeth Warren has served as a US senator from Massachusetts since 2013.\n\nWarren, known as a progressive, taught law at several universities and was a Harvard professor.\n\nWarren is a leader of the party's liberals and a fierce Wall Street critic who was instrumental in creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nEarlier this year, she apologised to the Cherokee Nation for taking a DNA test to prove her claims to Native American ancestry, an assertion that has prompted Trump to mockingly refer to her as \"Pocahontas\".\n\nShe announced her presidential run on February 9, 2019. She has promised to fight what she calls a \"rigged economic system\" that favours the wealthy.\n\nShe recently unveiled a student loan forgiveness proposal that would cancel up to $50,000 of debt for millions of Americans. She also supports free college tuition for students at two and four-year institutions.\n\nWarren has qualified for all the debates so far.\n\nMarianne Williamson, 66\n\nMarianne Williamson is an author, entrepreneur and activist. Williamson is the founder of Project Angel Food, a volunteer food delivery programme serving homebound people with life-changing illnesses.\n\nShe is also cofounder of the Peace Alliance, an education and advocacy organisation.\n\nThe Texas native believes her spirituality-focused campaign can heal the US.\n\nA 1992 interview on Oprah Winfrey's show propelled her to make a name for herself as a \"spiritual guide\" for Hollywood and a self-help expert.\n\nShe is calling for $100bn in reparations for slavery over 10 years, gun control, education reform and equal rights for lesbian and gay communities. In 2014, she made an unsuccessful bid for a House seat in California as an independent.\n\nShe announced her presidential run on January 29, 2019.\n\nWilliamson qualified for the first two debates, but failed to do so in September and October.\n\nAndrew Yang, 44\n\nAndrew Yang is the founder of Venture for America. In 2012, the Obama administration selected him as a Champion of Change.\n\nIn 2015, he was selected as Presidential Ambassador of Global Entrepreneurship.\n\nHe filed with the Federal Election Commission to run for president in 2020 on November 6, 2017.\n\nThe entrepreneur and former tech executive is focusing his campaign on an ambitious universal income plan.\n\nYang wants to guarantee all American citizens between the ages of 18 and 64 a $1,000 cheque every month.\n\nThe son of immigrants from Taiwan, Yang also is pushing for Medicare for All and proposing a new form of capitalism that is \"human-centred\".\n\nYang has qualified for all the debate so far.\n\nWho has dropped out?\n\nSo far seven candidates have dropped out of the race, with more likely to end their campaigns as the top tier of the field continue to increase its lead.\n\nHere's a look at who has dropped out so far:\n\nBill de Blasio, 58\n\nThe New York City mayor emerged as a progressive standard-bearer in 2013, when he won the first of two four-year terms at the helm of the country's biggest city on a platform of addressing income inequality. But he has struggled amid middling approval ratings and some political setbacks to build a national profile.\n\nAfter making the first two 2020 Democratic debates, but failing to qualify for the September event, the New York City mayor dropped out of the race in mid-September.\n\n\"I feel like I've contributed all that I can to this primary election,\" de Blasio told MSNBC when announcing he was withdrawing from the race. \"It's clearly not my time.\"\n\nKirsten Gillibrand, 52\n\nKirsten Gillibrand has served as a US senator from New York since 2009.\n\nAfter failing to qualify for the third Democratic presidential debate, Gillibrand, who campaign on a platform centred on women's rights, dropped out of the race.\n\nIn announcing her decision on August 28, Gillibrand told US media she had not decided which candidate to endorse.\n\n\u201cI think that women have a unique ability to bring people together and heal this country,\u201d Gillibrand told the New York Times\n\n\u201cI think a woman nominee would be inspiring and exciting,\" she added.\n\nMike Gravel, 89\n\nMike Gravel, the 89-year-old former senator made a little-known run for the Democratic nomination in 2008, took another stab at it early in the Democratic race.\n\nHis goal was to make the debate stage, but when that didn't happen, he officially ended his campaign in August, and endorsed Sanders.\n\nJohn Hickenlooper, 67\n\nJohn Hickenlooper served as the governor of Colorado from 2011 to 2019.\n\nHe announced he was ending his presidential bid on August 15 in a video posted on Twitter.\n\n\"While this campaign didn't have the outcome we were hoping for, every moment has been worthwhile and I'm thankful to everyone who supported this campaign and our entire team,\" Hickenlooper tweeted.\n\nLater in August, Hickenlooper announced he would run in the US Senate race against Republican incumbent Cory Gardner in Colorado.\n\nJay Inslee, 68\n\nJay Inslee has served as the governor of the state of Washington since 2013.\n\nOn August 21, he announced he was dropping out of the race, saying \"it has become clear that I'm not going to be carrying the ball. I am not going to be the president.\"\n\nInslee made fighting climate change the central issue of his campaign. In announcing his withdrawal, Inslee said he hopes other 2020 candidates would use his detailed 10--year climate plan.\n\nSeth Moulton, 40\n\nSeth Moulton has served as the US representative for Massachusetts's sixth congressional district since 2015.\n\nOn August 23, he announced he was dropping out of the 2020 race, telling US media if one of the more progressive candidates win the nomination it could make it harder for the Democrats to beat Trump.\n\n\"I think it's evident that this is now a three-way race between Biden, Warren and Sanders, and really it's a debate about how far left the party should go,\" Moulton told the New York Times.\n\nRichard Ojeda, 48\n\nRichard Ojeda was the first official presidential contender to drop out of the race.\n\nIn January, the former West Virginia state senator announced he was suspending his campaign, acknowledging he \"does not have the ability to compete\".\n\nEric Swalwell, 38\n\nEric Swalwell, an Iowa native, has served as a House representative from California's 15th congressional district since 2013.\n\nHe dropped out of the presidential race after the first primary debate in June.", "description": "The pool of candidates vying for their party's nomination in 2020 is among the largest and most diverse in US history.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/7/31/663e63d9bf644d7c879c4e40dba8ab0b_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-02-20"}
