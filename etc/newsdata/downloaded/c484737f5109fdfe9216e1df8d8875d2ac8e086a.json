The most visible of professions are public servants who make society a safe place to be. Naturally, we think of police officers, firefighters and military, plus many skilled workers who ensure our power lines are functioning, roads are repaired and pilots are flying airplanes that carry people 2.7 million people daily in the U.S.\n\nThey, plus many more, are heroes. They\u2019re out there in plain sight, and greatly appreciated.\n\nThere is, sadly, one exception.\n\nThe most underappreciated public servants in America are corrections officers or jail guards. Unless we have a significant friend or relative in prison, we rarely give a second thought to one of the most dangerous jobs on the planet. Out of sight, out of mind.\n\nCONSIDER SUBSCRIBING TODAY: Help support our local journalism\n\nMore opinion columns: One of many digital benefits of a FLORIDA TODAY subscription\n\nMarshall Frank: Gun accountability, not control, will stop nation's shootings\n\nIn my 30 years as a Miami-Dade County cop, I often met with corrections officers and wondered how they were able to maintain a positive attitude, managing inmates and coping with the pall of danger from the moment they arrive at work to the minute they finish their shift. I recall many officers within prison halls who wore a burdened expression, though most were quite professional handling my concerns.\n\nTurnover rates for such officers are exceptionally high, thus leading to too many unfilled positions. According to the Bureau of Labor, Florida\u2019s prisons have a 20% turnover rate. Consider Mississippi\u2019s turnover rate is over 50%. That\u2019s a lot of vacancies that the working guards absorb.\n\nIn a 2014 photo, Brevard County jail inmates do chain gang work at the North Animal Care Center in Titusville. (Photo: CRAIG RUBADOUX/FLORIDA TODAY)\n\nAccording to the Department of Justice, suicide is the leading cause of deaths among inmates at 29%. It is reported that over 33,000 corrections officers are assaulted by inmates each year, or 90 assaults per day.\n\nIt is an environment of gloom. Imagine working in a place where no one is happy. Inmates have few personal choices to engage in. An inmate\u2019s every move is monitored, one way or another. Corrections officers do the tough job of keeping people safe and under control, but the average citizen doesn\u2019t know that. There is no glamour. Very few books are written or movies made about day-to-day prison life, the boredom, the wailing anger from inmates, the monitoring, the discontent, the screams, the fights, sex offenses, and much more.\n\nSexual issues are blatant in prison settings. In a 2018 article published in Vice, female officer TaLisa J. Carter graphically imparts how she often faced chilling degradation from inmates that cannot be described in this article. She suffered while working as a woman in a man\u2019s prison, most often from mentally imbalanced inmates.\n\nOpinion: In today's political environment, who will risk becoming a cop?\n\nOpinion: Reparations would set America's race relations back\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are more than 2.2 million prison inmates in America supervised by more than 415,000 corrections officers in state systems. That\u2019s roughly half the number of police officers. Florida employs the third most corrections officers behind New York and California.\n\nRisks are great. officers must be cautious and alert while working in a prison system, especially for:\n\n\u2022 Drug addicts coming off a high;\n\n\u2022 Risks of being blindsided or assaulted by angry inmates;\n\n\u2022 Mental illness among the prison population;\n\n\u2022 Attacks with homemade weapons;\n\n\u2022 Exposure to inmates carrying diseases, i.e., Hepatitis C, HIV, tuberculosis, and more.\n\nOne published article by Scottie Andrew in Newsweek in July, 2018 concluded that post-traumatic stress disorder was just as prevalent among corrections officers as among veterans of foreign wars.\n\nOpinion: It's the police's job to protect. Profiling might be necessary\n\nOpinion: I'm a retired cop. Here's why I ... am a conservative and against death penalty\n\nThese are the unsung heroes of America who rarely receive recognition for their service. Their average salary in Florida is $48,000, which sounds acceptable \u2014 but is it? Some would rather have had regular police jobs but settled for prisons instead. Most do a credible job amid so many risks.\n\nNext time you drive a highway where you pass by a distant building surrounded by razor wire, give a thought to all the misery that prevails inside that facility, among correctional officers as well as inmates. They are the forgotten heroes.\n\nMarshall Frank is a retired police captain from Miami-Dade County, author and frequent contributor.
