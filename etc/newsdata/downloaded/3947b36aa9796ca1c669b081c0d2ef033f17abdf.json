They traveled to Rome from the region for three weeks of debate at a special synod, or meeting, which has become one of the most controversial of Francis\u2019 papacy.\n\nAmong the most contentious proposals on the agenda is whether married elders could be ordained priests to address the chronic priest shortages in the region. Currently indigenous Catholics in remote parts of the Amazon can go months without seeing a priest or having a proper Mass.\n\nAnother proposal calls for the Catholic church to identify new \u201cofficial ministries\u201d for women, though organizers have made it clear that priestly ordination is off the table.\n\nFrancis\u2019 conservative critics, including a handful of cardinals, have called the proposals \u201cheretical\u201d and an invitation to a \u201cpagan\u201d religion that idolizes nature rather than God. They have mounted an opposition campaign, issuing petitions and holding conferences to raise their voices.\n\nIn many ways, Francis opened the synod last year, when he travelled into the Peruvian Amazon and demanded that corporations stop their relentless extraction of timber, gas and gold.\n\nMeeting with native families in steamy Puerto Maldonado, Francis declared that the Amazon and its indigenous peoples are the \u201cheart of the church\u201d and demanded that governments recognize their rights to determine the region\u2019s future.\n\nThe seeds of the Amazon synod, however, long predate that visit and even Francis\u2019 landmark 2015 encyclical \u201cPraise Be,\u201d in which he denounced the profit-at-all-cost business interests destroying the rainforest.\n\nThe pope, when he was the former Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Argentina, drafted the final document of the 2007 meeting of South American bishops in Aparecida, Brazil, which identified the Amazon and its indigenous peoples as threatened by global economic interests and deserving of the church\u2019s utmost attention. Francis\u2019 closest advisers have said the Aparecida document was in many ways a blueprint for the papacy.\n\nScientists say the vast rainforest\u2019s lush vegetation absorbs heat-trapping carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The moisture given off by its trees also affects rainfall patterns and climate across South America and beyond.\n\nWhile the numbers of fires burning in the Amazon declined sharply last month, parts of the rainforest burned at a pace in July and August unseen since 2010. That fueled global worries about climate change, put the fires on the agenda of the Group of Seven summit hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron and directed environmental outrage at the pro-development stance of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.\n\nBolsonaro has repeatedly said he wants to promote economic development in the Amazon and regularize small-scale illegal mining. He has also strongly criticized foreign countries for meddling with what he sees is a domestic Brazilian matter.\n\n___\n\nRead more stories on climate issues by The Associated Press at https://www.apnews.com/Climate", "description": "VATICAN CITY (AP) \u2014 Pope Francis on Sunday opened a divisive meeting on preserving the Amazon and ministering to its indigenous peoples as he fended off", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/06/ac3616_vatican-amazon-28911-pope-francis-celebrates-an-opening-mass-amazon-synod-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
