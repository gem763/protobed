Potter could only make 2 tops or 3 people disappear at a time with the help of his invisibility cloak. However a tech firm has taken that concept to another level and has now come up with a technology that might make an entire building invisible.\n\nThis futuristic technology is called Quantum Sheath and has been developed by Hyperstealth Biotechnology Corporation. The sheath is reportedly made of light-bending material and the company claims that it can \u2018hide a person, a vehicle, a ship, spacecraft and buildings\u2019, according to the Mirror.\n\nHyperStealth Corp\n\nAccording to the CEO of Hyperstealth, Guy Cramer the material is paper-thin and does not even require any power source. The most interesting bit is that the material can not only hide objects in the visible spectrum but also \u2018in the UV, infrared and shortwave infrared, making it a \u2018Broadband Invisibility Cloak\u2019\u2019.\n\nGuy Cramer reportedly said, \u201cI'm excited to finally be able to speak about something that I haven't been able to for the last nine years and while I have a passion for my work I'm both excited and concerned for the different uses that will be employed moving forward.\n\nDon't Miss 22.4 K SHARES 9 K SHARES 8.5 K SHARES 6.3 K SHARES 4.5 K SHARES\n\nHyperStealth Corp\n\nMy first choice was to keep quiet about the technology and allow only allied forces access but with the release of the patents, everyone can access how to reproduce it and that's not necessarily a good thing.\u201d\n\nA statement reportedly said, \u201cOne piece of Quantum Stealth can work in any environment, in any season at any time of the day or night, something no other camouflage is capable of.\u201d\n\nDetails like what this real life cloak will be used for and how much it might cost is still under the cloak itself.", "description": "Harry Potter is about to get real but on a much larger scale.
