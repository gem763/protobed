The asteroid makes just over 3 orbits of the Sun between discovery and the possibility of an impact in 2027\n\nThe threat of asteroid impacts has gained increasing prominence over recent years, particularly since the Chelyabinsk fireball of 2013.\n\nThe meteor, which blazed across the southern Ural Mountain range in February 2013, was the largest recorded meteor strike in more than a century, after the Tunguska event of 1908.\n\nMore than 1,600 people were injured by the shock wave from the explosion, estimated to be as strong as 20 Hiroshima atomic bombs.\n\nIn preparation for a possible impact, NASA and other international science organisations will participate in the 2019 Planetary Defense Conference next week.\n\nA 'tabletop exercise' will play out the realistic\u2014but fictional\u2014scenarios for an asteroid and a comet on an impact trajectory with Earth.\n\nThe NEO impact scenario have been developed by the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Center for NEO Studies (CNEOS).\n\nThe asteroid scenario begins with the premise that on March 26, astronomers 'discovered' an asteroid that they consider is potentially hazardous to Earth.\n\nAfter a 'few months' of tracking, observers predict that this NEO \u2013 dubbed 2019 PDC \u2013 will pass within 0.05 astronomical units (AU) of Earth.\n\nOne AU is the distance between the Earth and the sun and equates to 92,955,807 miles (149,597,871 km).\n\nIn the fictional simulation, NASA claims the asteroid poses a one in 100 chance of colliding with Earth and it may land on April 29, 2027.\n\nIt is first located 35 million miles (57 million kilometres) from Earth and approaching at 31,000 mph (14km per second) and getting progressively brighter.\n\nWeeks of observation found it more and more likely it would impact Earth in 2027 but details of the asteroid's shape, size and composition remain scarce.\n\nAll that is known is the asteroid's average size could be anywhere from 330 feet to 1,000 feet (100 meters to 300 meters).\n\nMore than a month after first spotted it continues to fly towards Earth and passes Earth at a distance of 0.13 au on May 13 2019. it is next expected to return close to Earth in 2027.\n\nThe conference will pick up the event at this point and decide on the best course of action.\n\nExperts will discuss the dangers posed by NEOs and actions that might be taken to deflect a threatening object.\n\n'These exercises have really helped us in the planetary defense community to understand what our colleagues on the disaster management side need to know,' Lindley Johnson, NASA's Planetary Defense Officer, said.\n\n'This exercise will help us develop more effective communications with each other and with our governments.'\n\nThis diagram zooms in on the intersection point of the orbits and shows the uncertainty in the predicted position of the asteroid (red dots reveal potential spots for where the asteroid will pass Earth). The uncertainty region is several times longer than the diameter of the Moon's orbit but will shrink as more data is gathered on the asteroid's path and trajectory\n\nIntersection of the uncertainty region with the Earth creates a'risk corridor' across the surface of the Earth. The corridor wraps more than halfway around the globe (pictured, red dots are potential landing locations) on the risk corridor\n\nNASA is conducting planetary defence drills to see what would happen if an apocalyptic asteroid was heading straight for Earth. The Manicouagan impact crater in Quebec, Canada (circled right), is one of our many reminders that asteroids have impacted Earth\n\nThe conference will also discuss a hypothetical comet impact scenario.\n\nThis fictional event states a comet was spotted on April 4 2019 and could collide with Earth on February 28, 2021.\n\nIt has an orbital period believed to be several thousand years and astronomers speculate that its core is possibly only about 0.62 miles (1 kilometre) in size.\n\nNASA has in recent weeks announced measures it hopes will help to combat the threat posed by by NEOs.\n\nThe conference will also discuss a hypothetical comet impact scenario.

Currently Nasa would not be able to deflect an asteroid if it were heading for Earth but it could mitigate the impact and take measures that would protect lives and property. This would include evacuating the impact area and moving key infrastructure. Finding out about the orbit trajectory, size, shape, mass, composition and rotational dynamics would help experts determine the severity of a potential impact. However, the key to mitigating damage is to find any potential threat as early as possible. Nasa is currently moving forward with a refrigerator-sized spacecraft capable of preventing asteroids from colliding with Earth. A test with a small, nonthreatening asteroid is planned for 2024. This is the first-ever mission to demonstrate an asteroid deflection technique for planetary defence. The Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) would use what is known as a kinetic impactor technique\u2014striking the asteroid to shift its orbit. The impact would change the speed of a threatening asteroid by a small fraction of its total velocity, but by doing so well before the predicted impact, this small nudge will add up over time to a big shift of the asteroid's path away from Earth.\n\nA top NASA asteroid scientist also recently said that the best way to defend the Earth from asteroids is to build a new telescope capable of spotting them as soon as possible.\n\nDr Amy Mainzer from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, said that trying to spot asteroids with current telescopes was like trying to spot a 'lump of coal in the night's sky'.\n\nIn April 2019, her team proposed a new system designed to spot large meteors capable of causing significant damage.\n\nIt would identify incoming asteroids capable of causing huge loss of life - just like the meteor which wiped out the dinosaurs 66 million years ago.\n\nThey claim this would give the scientists more time to come up with a strategy to intercept the rock.\n\nA NASA scientist has said that to defend the Earth from dangerous asteroids is to detect them via heat using an infra-red telescope called the Near-Earth Object Camera (NEOCam). Comet Catalina (pictured) in 2015 was captured by such a telescope called NEOWISE\n\nDr Amy Mainzer said that trying to spot asteroids via their 'faint' light was like trying to spot a 'lump of coal in the night's sky', but that a proposed Near-Earth Object Camera mission (pictured) that detects heat waves would make it a lot more accurate\n\nIncoming space rocks are not always spotted in advance of their arrival, however.\n\nIncredible images released in March 2019 revealed a meteor that exploded in the Earth's atmosphere in December with ten times the force of the Hiroshima bomb - yet no one detected it.\n\nThe incident took place at 11:50pm GMT (3:30am EST) on December 18, 2018, over the Bering Sea - between Russia and Alaska - but has only just been discovered.\n\nIt is believed to be the second largest meteor explosion in the last 30 years, and the biggest since the high-profile Chelyabinsk incident.", "description": "NASA is investigating how best to respond to the possibility of an asteroid or a comet colliding with Earth in fictional situations.", "authors": ["Tim Collins", "Joe Pinkstone For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/04/26/13/12752114-0-image-a-53_1556280848234.jpg", "published_at": "2019-04-26"}
