Now, it's aiming to have Alexa come with you everywhere, by putting it on your face, in your ears, and even on your finger.\n\nAt a major media event on Wednesday , Amazon introduced a wide range of new products and services \u2014 all part of an ongoing effort to make Alexa an ever-more-important part of users' lives. While the assistant started out in 2014 as the helper built into Amazon's Echo smart speaker, the universe of Alexa-infused products produced by Amazon itself now includes a bevy of smart speakers, a smart oven, a clock, and three wearables.\n\nAmazon introduced a slew of new devices and services on Wednesday, including three wearable gadgets.\n\nThese Alexa-summoning wearables \u2014 a pair of black glasses called Echo Frames, a dark gray ring called Echo Loop, and a pair of earbuds called Echo Buds\u2014 mark a move into a notoriously tricky market. For years, companies such as Fitbit, Jabra, Apple, and countless others have tried to convince consumers to wear tech all over their bodies, with limited success beyond watches (you've probably seen plenty of people sporting Apple's AirPods, for instance, but lots of other companies hawking wearable technology, such as Google with its Google Glass, failed).\n\nSo how does Amazon plan to succeed? From what it showed off on stage and during product demonstrations on Wednesday, it will be by making wearables that can do a few complicated things in ways that feel simple and look unobtrusive. It's making Echo Frames and Echo Loop available by invitation only through a program called Day 1 Editions, signaling that they're earlier-stage products that only some people will be able to get their hands on -\u2014 for now, at least. All will be available later this year, the company said.\n\nI got a chance to (briefly) try out each of these products, all three of which are dependent on a nearby smartphone running Amazon's Alexa app. This much was clear: The decision to wear any of these gadgets will be deeply personal, and depend both on the fit and functionality.\n\nRead More", "description": "Amazon doesn't just want to bring its virtual assistant, Alexa, to your home.
