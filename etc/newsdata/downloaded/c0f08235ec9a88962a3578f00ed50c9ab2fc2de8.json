Medicare was billed about $2 billion.\n\nDubbed \u201cOperation Double Helix,\u201d the crackdown targeted telemarketing companies, doctors and labs, in a joint effort by the FBI, U.S. attorneys\u2019 offices, and the Health and Human Services inspector general. More than 30 people were charged around the country.\n\nThe alleged scam flourished at a time when many people are getting DNA tests to trace back their family heritage.\n\nFraudsters preyed on people\u2019s fears of harboring genetic markers for diseases such as cancer. However, genetic testing is not routinely used to screen for cancer.\n\n\u201cA decade ago, it would have given Medicare beneficiaries pause if someone wanted to get a swab from their cheek of their saliva,\u201d said Shimon Richmond, who heads the inspector general\u2019s investigative division. \u201cToday people know and recognize what (genetic testing) is, and they think \u2018I can get that done, and I can get it done for free and find out if I have health issues that I need to address.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a bad decision, said Richmond. Not only does it put the patient\u2019s Medicare ID in the hands of fraudsters who can then keep reselling it for illicit purposes, but it can potentially compromise unique details of an individual\u2019s make-up.\n\nAnother downside: Medicare might deny future coverage for genetic testing when it\u2019s really needed, since the patient\u2019s record would show such an analysis was already done. Patients should only have genetic testing if their own doctor orders it, officials said.\n\nThe alleged scam worked like this: Officials said a telemarketing or in-person \u201crecruiter\u201d would convince a Medicare enrollee to take a genetic test, assuring them that the program would pay the full cost. The patient would provide their Medicare information. A doctor in league with the fraudsters would approve the test, and collect a kickback from the recruiter company. A lab participating in the scheme would run the test, bill Medicare, and share payments collected from the government with the recruiter.\n\nBills to Medicare connected with the scheme typically ranged from $7,000 to $12,000, Richmond said, with some much higher. In many cases the patient never got a report back, or the results provided were incomprehensible. Medicare paid out hundreds of millions of dollars before authorities detected the fraud and moved in.\n\nThere was no single organization behind the fraud and Friday\u2019s operation went after several regional networks.\n\nMedicare enrollee Linda Morris of Parker City, Indiana, said she was roped in at a conference on aging well. The retired high school math and journalism teacher got her cheek swabbed by one of the many health vendors at the event.\n\n\u201cTheir ploy was, \u2018Get a mouth swab and we can analyze how well your system synthesizes the drugs you are taking,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt never crossed my mind there was anything wrong with this.\u201d\n\nThen her Medicare statements started coming in, showing charges as high as $33,000. The program paid almost $10,000.\n\nMorris said she was never billed, and was never sent results. When she looked up the address for the test vendor it was \u201ca house on a back road.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel stupid, and in the meantime, I\u2019m furious,\u201d Morris said. Health fairs, church events, and senior centers are like magnets for the fraudsters, officials said.\n\nDennie Krivokapich of Farmington, New Mexico, said he almost sent in his cheek swab following a telemarketing pitch. The retired accountant is a three-time cancer survivor and concerned about his future risk. The company sent him a kit, but the paperwork that came with it made him suspicious.\n\n\u201cThe physician who requested it was not my physician,\u201d said Krivokapich. The marketing company kept calling him, until he blocked the number.\n\nGovernment-backed anti-fraud organizations known as the Senior Medicare Patrol have been trying to spread the word about genetic testing scams. Retired federal investigator Jennifer Trussell, a consultant to the groups, said fear of cancer is the scam artists\u2019 most effective tool. \u201cThese are bad actors trying to take advantage of good medicine,\u201d she said.\n\nFraud against government health care programs is a pervasive problem that costs taxpayers tens of billions of dollars a year. The true extent is unknown.\n\nExperts say part of the problem is that Medicare is required to pay medical bills promptly, which means money often goes out before potential frauds get flagged. Investigators call that \u201cpay and chase.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, Medicare has tried to adapt techniques used by credit card companies to head off fraud. Law enforcement coordination has grown, with strike forces of federal prosecutors and agents, along with state counterparts, specializing in health care investigations.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Federal agents took down an alleged Medicare fraud scheme Friday that exploited seniors' curiosity about genetic medicine by enticing them to get their cheeks swabbed for unneeded DNA tests.
