Reopening and re-staffing the Homestead centre would take \u201ca minimum of 90 to 120 days,\u201d according to Mr Hayes.\n\nThe plan was made to keep the facilities open \u201cgiven the extreme uncertainty of referrals coming across our nation's southern border and how many kids we might have to care for,\u201d Mr Hayes said.\n\nClosing Homestead \u201cisn't really a switch that we're ready to turn off at this point\u201d, he added.\n\nMr Pocan then chided the official over the staggering costs to keep the Homestead facilities open for \u201cinvisible, imaginary, nonexistent human beings\".\n\nWhile officials saw a high of nearly 16,000 unaccompanied migrant children in US custody last year, there are currently about 5,700, according to the Office of Refugee Resettlement.\n\nMr Trump and his administration were criticised by Democrats at the hearing for taking hard-line immigration policies at the US-Mexico border that they said only further contributed to the humanitarian crisis in the region.\n\nThe president was forced to roll back several of those policies, including one that extended the amount of time migrant children were in custody by requiring every single person in a household to receive fingerprint background checks before a child can be released to anyone in that family unit.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
