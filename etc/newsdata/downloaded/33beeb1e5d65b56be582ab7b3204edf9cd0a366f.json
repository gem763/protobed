There are parts of it we can't show you, or rather, there are parts of it we're not going to show you,\" Todd said Friday on MSNBC. \"The president's red meat vitriol wasn't new. Neither was his use of profanity.\n\n\"The president went further than he's ever gone before. So we are going further than we've ever gone before to say we aren't going to play the sound. We aren't going to repeat the president's vicious attacks on Hunter Biden,\" Todd added.\n\nThe news anchor claimed Trump character \"assassinated\" Hunter Biden, saying it was particularly inappropriate because he was a private citizen. Todd noted the attack was \"newsworthy\" but that he could not air it in \"good conscience.\"\n\nTrump's campaign responded to Todd on Twitter Friday night saying, \"Go ahead, keep protecting the Bidens and censoring the movement to #DrainTheSwamp.\" They then attached a video of Trump's attack.\n\nThe president attacked Hunter Biden for five minutes during his rally in Minnesota. As a part of the attack, he acted out a fake interview between Biden and Todd. Trump called NBC \"one of the worst\" networks and mocked Todd as being a Biden promoter.\n\nThe president and his allies have accused the Bidens of corruption over their dealings in Ukraine, pointing out that Hunter Biden was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company while his father was vice president.\n\nTrump's rally in Minnesota turned violent Thursday after protesters snatched hats off rallygoers and burned them in a fire. The Trump campaign has been targeting Minnesota for the 2020 presidential election with hopes of flipping it red.\n\n", "description": "MSNBC host Chuck Todd called President Trump's attacks on Joe Biden's son, Hunter, \"vicious\" and said that the network was not going to \"reward\" the president by airing them.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5c69932/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2520x1323+0+24/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediadc.brightspotcdn.com%2F40%2Fbe%2F99cad89e4f2789aae7db9c630c0f%2Fscreen-shot-2019-10-12-at-12.30.30%20PM.png", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
