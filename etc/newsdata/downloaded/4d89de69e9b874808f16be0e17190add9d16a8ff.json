Elephants have been known to display signs of grief.\n\nThere are around 300 wild elephants in the park, which is home to various wild animals, including bears and gibbons, and is a popular destination for tourists.\n\nNational park officers are trying to retrieve the bodies from the river as there are fears the carcasses might contaminate the water.\n\nAccording to the Bangkok Post, the new death toll makes it one of the biggest losses to Thailand's elephant population in recent memory.\n\nThe Haew Narok waterfall has a history of similar incidents. A herd of eight elephants died after falling in 1992, in a case that brought national attention.\n\nAround 7,000 Asian elephants remain in Thailand, with more than half living in captivity.", "description": "It is thought the adult elephants may have been trying to save a calf who slipped down a waterfall.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F74F/production/_109111336_71401654_1922954617850015_1383157396922171392_o.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
