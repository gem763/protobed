Wharf Real Estate Investment Co. and New World Development Co. rallied at least 8%. The Hong Kong dollar gained as much as 0.08%. The Hang Seng Index was up 3.5%.\n\nLam plans to formally withdraw the bill, the South China Morning Post reported on Wednesday, citing unidentified sources. Lam has called for a meeting with pro-establishment politicians at her residence at 4 p.m. local time, HK01 news website reported, without saying where it got the information.\n\nA spokeswoman for Lam\u2019s office wasn\u2019t immediately available to comment by phone or email on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThe MSCI Hong Kong Index tumbled 8.6% last month as increasingly violent protests and an economic slowdown darkened the outlook for the city\u2019s companies.\n\n\"The withdrawal is sign of an inflection point in the 13-week long crisis,\" said Justin Tang, head of Asian research at United First Partners. \"Retail and property stock investors are signalling their optimism and putting their money where it matters.\"\n\nThe Hang Seng Properties Index rose 6.4%. The gauge had tumbled more 20% since its April high through Tuesday. Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. headed for its best gain since 2009.\n\nMTR Corp., which has seen a number of stations deliberately damaged in the protests, climbed 5.7%.\n\nThe rebound may be short-lived, according to Gary Ching, vice president of the research, wealth management department at Guosen Securities (HK).\n\n\"If the reality turns out to be a let-down, the disappointment may suppress shares even further,\" Ching said. \"It\u2019s unlikely that retracting the bill will be enough to placate the unrest -- this concession by the government may instead motivate protesters to do more to get their other demands met. Even if the bill is retracted as the market expects, we are a long way from wrapping this up. \"\n\n--With assistance from Philip Glamann, Jeanny Yu and April Ma.\n\nTo contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Livia Yap in Singapore at lyap14@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Will Davies at wdavies13@bloomberg.net, Richard Frost\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Hong Kong stocks jumped, led by property developers, after reports Chief Executive Carrie Lam will formally withdraw the extradition bill that\u2019s sparked months of protests.The MSCI Hong Kong Index surged 4.6%, poised for its biggest gain since October 2011.
