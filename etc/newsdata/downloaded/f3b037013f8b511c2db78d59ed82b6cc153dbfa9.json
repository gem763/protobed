(Picture: Netflix)\n\nWarning: Contains spoilers for Stranger Things season three.\n\nMillie Bobby Brown has responded to a Stranger Things fan theory which believes Eleven could turn evil, and she\u2019s digging the idea.\n\nWhile many might be wondering if Hopper is still alive after the show\u2019s third season, some fans believe Eleven could have been infected by the Mind Flayer after a part of its flesh got stuck on her leg, potentially turning her into a villain for the next season.\n\nMillie Bobby Brown, who plays Eleven, has since given her verdict on this very theory \u2013 and she\u2019s a bit freaked out by the possibility of it.\n\nAsked by Elle about the theory, Millie said: \u2018I kind of like it! I\u2019m into it. I wasn\u2019t playing it like that. We don\u2019t know what happens in season four. I definitely don\u2019t.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018In scenes after the Mind Flayer grabbed me, I wasn\u2019t playing it as I was infected. I was definitely playing it as normal as possible. And maybe that\u2019s the reason they didn\u2019t tell me. To make it as real as possible. I don\u2019t know.\n\nStranger Things 3 was a huge hit (Picture: Netflix)\n\n\u2018Those theories freak me out a bit. Because I\u2019m like, \u201cOh god, that could genuinely be true.\u201d And what if she is the villain? That would be so cool. Wouldn\u2019t that be cool? I\u2019d love to be the villain, but then I also wouldn\u2019t because Eleven is perfect. It would suck.\u2019\n\nWhile it could be a tricky path for creators The Duffer Brothers to navigate, the idea of Eleven turning evil would be an interesting twist \u2013 especially after her powers have become a crutch for Mike (Finn Wolfhard), Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo), Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) and Will (Noah Schnapp).\n\nNetflix recently confirmed Stranger Things season 4 is in the works for 2020, following positive reception from audiences and critics to the show\u2019s third outing.\n\nThe Duffer Brothers have also signed a multi-year deal to produce television series and films for Netflix.\n\nSpeaking about the deal and renewal, the Duffer Brothers said: \u2018We are absolutely thrilled to continue our relationship with Netflix. Ted Sarandos, Cindy Holland, Brian Wright, and Matt Thunell took a huge chance on us and our show \u2013 and forever changed our lives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018From our first pitch meeting to the release of Stranger Things 3, the entire team at Netflix has been nothing short of sensational, providing us with the kind of support, guidance, and creative freedom we always dreamed about. We can\u2019t wait to tell many more stories together \u2013 beginning, of course, with a return trip to Hawkins!\u2019\n\nStranger Things season 4 will release on Netflix in 2020.\n\nMORE: Gemma Collins believes she has powers and compares herself to Stranger Things character Eleven\n\nMORE: Stranger Things fan nails the most convincing Jim Hopper theory ahead of season 4", "description": "Millie Bobby Brown has responded to a theory Eleven could turn evil in Stranger Things season 4.", "authors": ["Adam Starkey"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/stranger-things-main-e310_1570609519.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
