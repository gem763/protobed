It\u2019s pretty much exactly what it sounds like.\n\nNow available nationwide, the new \"pizza\" looks like a giant Cheez-It, albeit stuffed with mozzarella cheese (pepperoni is also available). A single order comes with four large squares containing the mozzarella inside a cheese-baked crust. It also comes packed with a side of marinara sauce for dipping.\n\nThe concept was apparently born when Pizza Hut realized that Cheez-Its were popular among the chain\u2019s largest fan base: college students.
