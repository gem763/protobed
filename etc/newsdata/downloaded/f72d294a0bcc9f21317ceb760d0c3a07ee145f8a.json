The report added that Kay told investigators he likely did not supply the drugs Skaggs took just before his death because the pitcher typically took the drugs as soon as he got them from Kay.\n\nThe report also said that Kay gave DEA agents the names of five other players who he believed used opiates while they were with the team.\n\n\u201cWe have never heard that any employee was providing illegal narcotics to any player, or that any player was seeking illegal narcotics,\u201d Angels president John Carpino said in a statement. \u201cThe Angels maintain a strict, zero tolerance policy regarding the illicit use of drugs for both players and staff.
