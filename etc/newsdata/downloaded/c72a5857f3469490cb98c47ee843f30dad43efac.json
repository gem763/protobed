There, to the north-west, are the Julian Alps, still slightly frosted in the late spring sunshine. Below, bathed in the same glow, is Ljubljana, all orange tiles, pastel-hue churches and winsome spires \u2013 the River Ljubljanica slipping woozily through its centre.\n\nAnd there, in a corner, is the hotel\u2019s current use for its upper level. Two squat beehives. A cloud of the insects shakes and shimmers in front of the access slits \u2013 causing Gorazd Trusnovec to smile. A stocky, unshaven man, he goes under the title \u201cPresident of the Ljubljana Urban Beekeeping Association\u201d. And today, he is feeling particularly proud of these twin outposts of his empire \u2013 dozens of hives, rented to keen apiarists across the Slovenian capital.
