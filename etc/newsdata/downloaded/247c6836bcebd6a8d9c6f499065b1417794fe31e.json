I locked myself quietly in this toilet, and wrote to my family that I love them, and waited for something to happen.\u201d\n\nThe gunman appeared to have problems with what he called an \"improvised weapon\" jamming and cursed repeatedly, before shooting a man hiding behind a drinks fridge at point-blank range.\n\nThe livestream showed him leaving the takeaway and opening fire at vehicles in the street, before returning to the kebab shop and shooting the same victim several times.\n\nHe then stopped his car in the road and appeared to fire randomly over its roof towards motorists, before driving away.\n\n\"I\u2019m a complete loser,\" the attacker said, then disappeared after apparently discarding the camera and dumping his Volkswagen Golf.\n\nOne victim's body was in the street outside the synagogue, while another victim was found inside the Turkish kebab shop.\n\nOfficials at the Uniklinikums Halle hospital said it was treating two more people for gunshot injuries, including a victim undergoing surgery.\n\nA separate shooting was later reported in the town of Landsberg, around a 20 minute drive from Halle.\n\nAnja Werner, the mayor of Landsberg, later said a car had been hijacked and driven onto a motorway that leads to Munich.\n\nHalle's main railway station was shut as the search operation continued, and Germany's federal police were increasing controls at land borders and airports to prevent any potential escape.\n\nInvestigators said they had arrested one person following the attack, but it was unclear whether other suspects could be at large.\n\nThe country\u2019s federal public prosecutor has taken over the investigation into the case - a move commonly seen for suspected terror attacks.\n\nBefore the Twitch footage emerged, a spokesperson told The Independent they were looking into potential ideological motivations including far-right extremism, but had not confirmed the background to the shootings.\n\nThe footage has since been removed from the Twitch website, which focuses on video game streaming, but was still being spread online.\n\nA live broadcast was also made by the Christchurch shooter, who used Facebook Live, and posted a \u201cmanifesto\u201d espousing a theory that white people are being eradicated from Western nations on the 8chan image board.\n\nThe attack inspired copycat terrorists around the world, including in the UK, Norway and the American cities of El Paso and Poway - where a synagogue was attacked.\n\nOn the 4chan website, some posters were comparing the Halle shooter to \u201cSaint [Brenton] Tarrant\u201d, while another wrote: \u201cKill society, one lone gunman at a time. F***, I\u2019m lovin it.\u201d\n\nOthers ridiculed the shooter, who called himself a \u201closer\u201d repeatedly in the video, for failing to kill more victims.", "description": "A neo-Nazi who killed at least two people after\u00a0attacking a synagogue in Germany\u00a0broadcast his rampage on the Twitch live-streaming video platform.
