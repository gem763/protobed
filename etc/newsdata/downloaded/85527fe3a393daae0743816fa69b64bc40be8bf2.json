I just knew I was going in the army' Daniel revealed.\n\n'It turns you, it changes you. I was the JCB driver so I was driving vans down to the big tanks and I was barely getting any sleep.\n\n'You're the first one up and the last one working.

He then started working as a personal trainer and a DJ, and it was a chance encounter that lead him into porn\n\n'When I was working as a DJ, there was a fan of mine, a girl, who worked as a dominatrix.\n\n'She tells me about this guy, she says \"he's \"totally straight but does gay porn\"'.\n\n'This is a low-budget British company. The guy rings us and says, \"the majority of it's fake\".\n\nHe then offered Daniel \u00a3750 for a short shoot.\n\n'I just made \u00a3750, and I want that again' Daniel continued. 'Imagine, if I got one of those weekly, \u00a3750 a week! And then he's like \"yeah two weeks time, three weeks time\" and goes off the radar for months'.\n\n'When I was working as a DJ, there was a fan of mine, a girl, who worked as a dominatrix.

For a straight guy, there's way more money in gay porn.'\n\nThe documentary also spoke to his girlfriend Freya, who said she didn't care if people thought her partner was gay because she knew the truth.\n\n'It's fake. People say he must be a little bit gay' Freya said.\n\nThe documentary also spoke to his girlfriend Freya (pictured together) who said she didn't care if people thought her partner was gay because she knew the truth.\n\n'When he gets back [from a shoot], he doesn't want to think about anyone with a d***' she added.\n\nExplaining why she remained nonplussed by her partners career choices, Freya continued: 'If it was straight porn, he would be attracted to the people he was working with.\n\n'So in theory its still the same, but there would be potentially he's attracted to them, but that risk isn't there because it's full of men that he doesn't think are fit.\n\n'People can sit at home and think he's gay, but he's not, so whatever'.\n\n'People outside the industry think I must be gay. They don't know the tricks of the trade. They say \"you look like you're enjoying it\". And I say, \"thanks, that means I'm a good actor' Daniel added.\n\n'If I was gay, and it's out there to the world, why wouldn't I come out?'\n\n'People outside the industry think I must be gay. They don't know the tricks of the trade. They say \"you look like you're enjoying it\". And I say, \"thanks, that means I'm a good actor' Daniel added.\n\nLater, Daniel explained the logic behind staying in the industry.\n\n'I ain't smart, academically. It's either this or going to work in a warehouse, 'cause I have no qualifications. I have driving qualifications, but obviously I've had one of them lifestyles where I've been banned from driving.\n\n'So driving jobs are a no go. You need to make your money, man. I'm glad I found porn because I make more money now than I ever have.\n\n'I see the perks of it now, I don't even think about what I've got to do anymore, it's that easy.\n\n'I'm not in it for pleasure, regardless of what anyone thinks. I'm in it because it's a well paid job, and I'm not going to make that kind of money, legally, anywhere else'.\n\nLater, speaking on a five-day shoot Mexico, Daniel is asked by his make-up artist 'Do you ever see any repercussions from your baby mama?'\n\n'I ain't smart, academically. It's either this or going to work in a warehouse, 'cause I have no qualifications. I have driving qualifications, but obviously I've had one of them lifestyles where I've been banned from driving' Daniel explained\n\nHe said: 'She knows. As long as she's getting paid I don't actually think she cares'.\n\n'There were times before I started this where I didn't really have any money.\n\n'I was out on my a**e and I barely got anything. Now I've got a contract, and got regular money coming in, she gets paid what she wants.\n\nWhen asked if he considers himself a gay ally, he added 'No, I don't know. My brother's gay'.\n\n'When I was in the Army, there were people that used to do stuff with each other, and say it was banter.\n\n'My mum hasn't got a clue I do porn. She knows I do some kind of gay modelling, I could never tell her, she'd probably just laugh but I can't physically get it out of my mouth to her' Daniel said\n\nHe then makes his co-stars laugh with very graphic stories of living in shared quarters with other solders and adds 'compared to what I've done in the army, this is a walk in the park'.\n\nHe later adds: 'I told him I wasn't gay, but he thought I was just in that process. He went through a process where he was so homophobic it was just unbelievable. But then he came out as gay.\n\nWhile his brother and sisters know about his career, he isn't as open with his parents about it.\n\n'My mum hasn't got a clue I do porn. She knows I do some kind of gay modelling, I could never tell her, she'd probably just laugh but I can't physically get it out of my mouth to her.\n\n'I told my sisters, but Mum and Dad are different. Nannas and stuff, you don't want to know.\n\n'My sexual identity is straight, one hundred per cert straight.'", "description": "Daniel McGraffin, from Wigan, who goes by the porn name Geordie Jackson, opened up about his gay porn career in Channel 5's documentary, The Sex Business: Swinging Both Ways", "authors": ["Bridie Pearson-Jones For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/10/20173638-0-image-a-39_1571996375706.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
