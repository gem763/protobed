So, we had felt at that time, at the banks\u2019 guidance, that it was not the best time in going forward with the transaction,\u201d ESR Chairman Jeffrey Perlman said at a press conference to launch the deal.\n\n\u201cThe confidence now is evident in the substantial cornerstone investment that has been made.\u201d\n\nCompanies are pushing ahead with listing plans in Asia\u2019s top financial hub despite months of anti-government protests in Hong Kong.\n\nAB InBev floated its Asia-Pacific unit (1876.HK) in Hong Kong\u2019s biggest listing this year in September.\n\nBased on ESR\u2019s price range of HK$16.2 to HK$17.4 ($2.07-$2.22) a share, the firm could raise up to $1.45 billion before any over-allocation option is included, giving it a market capitalization of $6.27-$6.74 billion, a term sheet seen by Reuters showed.\n\nThe valuation is the same as that sought by ESR in its June IPO attempt.\n\nExisting shares will make up 57.1% of the deal, which includes an option allowing insiders to sell more shares, worth up to 15% of the base deal.\n\nUsing that \u201coffer size adjustment\u201d option would net sellers additional funds of as much as $218 million.\n\nAt least seven existing shareholders are selling shares in the IPO, including a Warburg Pincus unit, a Goldman Sachs unit and e-commerce firm JD.com Inc\u2019s (JD.O) Jingdong Logistics Group Corp, the term sheet showed.\n\nCLSA and Deutsche Bank are joint sponsors for the IPO. Morgan Stanley has joined as the leading joint global coordinator.\n\nESR was formed in 2016 by the merger of the Japan-centric Redwood Group and China-focused e-Shang, co-founded by Warburg Pincus in 2011.\n\nIts shares will be priced on Oct. 25 and trading is scheduled to start on Nov. 1.\n\nIPO ACTIVITY PICKS UP\n\nHong Kong topped the global charts in 2018 for funds raised through IPOs.\n\nBut roiled by a five-month long political crisis, it is currently lagging both the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq with $18.5 billion raised as of mid-October, Refinitiv data showed.\n\nThat compared with $21.9 billion on the NYSE and $23.3 billion on Nasdaq.\n\nBut IPO activity in the city has picked up, marked by AB InBev\u2019s Budweiser Brewing Company APAC Ltd (1876.HK), which raised about $5 billion in Hong Kong\u2019s biggest and the world\u2019s second-largest IPO so far this year.\n\nIt had dropped plans for a bigger float in July, just as the deal was meant to price, citing market conditions among other factors.", "description": "Property investor ESR Cayman Ltd <1821.HK>, backed by private-equity firm Warburg Pincus [WP.UL], relaunched an initial public offering (IPO) worth up to $1.45 billion on Monday in what could be Hong Kong's second-biggest deal this year.", "authors": ["Julie", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
