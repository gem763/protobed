So give yourself a break and turn to one of these show-stopping celebration cakes instead.\n\nWhether you\u2019re looking for something super sweet and child-friendly or are in need of an altogether more grown-up option, we\u2019ve found budget supermarket creations through to splash-the-cash cakes they\u2019ll remember long after they\u2019ve blown out the candles.\n\nThe important things to remember when choosing your birthday cake is how many you\u2019ll need it to serve.\n\nWe found that some retailers rather overestimated how many slices you\u2019d get out of their cake, so best err on the side of caution and go up a size if, like us, you\u2019re a greedy bunch.\n\nAnd while you don\u2019t want to leave it too late, a fresh cake always tastes best, so check the shelf life before buying.\n\nSome only last a day or two, others weeks and many can even be frozen until you need it.\n\nSo gather around the troops, get ready for the obligatory out of tune rendition of \u201chappy birthday\u201d and whatever you do \u2013 don\u2019t forget the candles.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews. We may earn commission from some of the retailers, but we never allow this to influence selections, which are formed from real-world testing and expert advice.

The beauty of this clever cake is that it contains 14 unique, pre-sliced flavours with a separator between them. So unlike some of the other, slightly questionable serving suggestions we tested, here you know exactly how many portions you\u2019re getting. Each generous wedge, genuinely tasted different from the next, without being overly sweet, sickly or artificial tasting.\n\nHighlights for us included the carrot, red velvet and bakewell but there are also slices of cookies and cream, apple crumble, chocolate orange, victoria, coffee, sticky toffee, rocky road, chocolate, lemon, millionaires and a seasonal special. Left it a bit late? Sponge offer next day delivery, with ours arriving in perfect condition \u2013 and it even includes a few napkins so you can dive straight in.\n\nBuy now\n\nWaitrose Heston top hat cake: \u00a345, Waitrose\n\nWe were blown away by the presentation of this show-stopping birthday cake \u2013 but then we\u2019d expect nothing less from the theatrical Heston range. The top-hat design is covered in a smooth chocolate fudge icing, decorative sugar \u201ccards\u201d and a silky ribbon. Cut into it and the drama continues, revealing four different coloured layers of moist flavoured sponge \u2013 including sherbet lemon, raspberry jam, blackcurrant and chocolate and salted caramel. Even the base is edible, made from a chunky chocolate and almond tiffin similar to rocky road. The only slight downside is that due to its height, slices need to be thin (otherwise they\u2019d be huge!) but it should easily serve 20 people. Make it even more special by adding a personalised message to it for free!\n\nBuy now\n\nM&S personalised giant Colin the caterpillar cake: \u00a340, M&S\n\nIs it even your birthday unless you\u2019re blowing out candles on a Colin the Caterpillar cake? Young, old, David Beckham, Judi Dench, we\u2019ve all celebrated getting a year older with this much-loved character but now M&S have supersized him \u2013 ideal if you\u2019re having a bigger bash (it serves 40). You\u2019re probably familiar with this one, but just to recap, the giant chocolate sponge roll is filled with buttercream, coated in more chocolate, sprinkled with chocolate beans and finished with the cheerful white chocolate face (which must always be saved for the birthday boy or girl). This larger version also has space for a personalised message. Impersonators have come and gone but for us, you can\u2019t beat the original.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe deluxe chocolate hazelnut truffle cake: \u00a323, Desserts Delivered Bakery\n\nThis 6-inch cake may look on the small side but thanks to the three layers of chocolate sponge, sandwiched together with Nutella-flavoured buttercream, you\u2019ll find it serves 10 easily. It\u2019s delivered frozen to make it a bit sturdier, so do factor in time for it to defrost before serving. Topped with melted chocolate which has dripped artfully down the sides, a layer of frosting, a sprinkling of toasted hazelnuts and 10 Ferrero Rocher\u2019s \u2013 we were impressed to see it was completely intact on arrival.\n\nBuy now\n\nFunfetti cookie cake: From \u00a360, Baked by Steph\n\nAppealing to Instagram-loving millennials, this clever cookie cake can unfortunately only be delivered within London. However we just couldn\u2019t resist including in our round-up as it really is a looker. Adorned with a riot of macarons, chocolate-covered pretzels, meringue kisses and edible leaf, you can choose any combination of letters or numbers for the lucky recipient, with each character serving about 10 people. The cookie cake base comes in a choice of nine flavours \u2013 from the original vanilla, through to decadent chocolate and salted caramel or fruity mango & coconut. As if it didn\u2019t look special enough already, you can also add edible flowers to your design.\n\nBuy now\n\nBaker Street chocolate celebration cake: \u00a37.65, Ocado\n\nWe liked the simplicity of this celebration cake. Presented in a large rectangle traybake style, it\u2019s super easy to portion up into equal pieces and a doddle to transport (we took ours into the office where it went down a treat). Moist and light chocolate sponge is topped with chocolate icing and finished with a trio of chocolate swirls. It\u2019s a great price and the simple design means it will appeal to all ages and serves an impressive 20.\n\nBuy now\n\nTesco unicorn cake: \u00a312, Tesco\n\nThe classic madeira sponge and strawberry jam filling is a winning combination for kids birthday parties. Here, Tesco has included four layers of sponge before it\u2019s hand-decorated with white frosting and topped with cute icing ears and the all-important unicorn horn, along with a swirl of rainbow coloured icing mane. As you might expect from looking at it, the icing is incredibly sweet, so you won\u2019t need much. Serves 18 according to Tesco but we couldn\u2019t manage more than 16 slices out of it \u2013 and you might get some arguments over who gets the magical horn.\n\nBuy now\n\nBetty\u2019s Happy Birthday chocolate cake: \u00a318, Betty\u2019s\n\nThis one felt very grown up \u2013 in part due to the apricot preserve filling which was the perfect surprise accompaniment to the rich chocolate ganache. Topped with a layer of chocolate swirls and a Happy Birthday disc, it serves six people comfortably, eight at a push and will last up to four days but can be frozen if necessary. There was a good weight to this one, rather how we imagine Bruce Bogtrotter\u2019s chocolate cake in Roald Dahl\u2019s Matilda.\n\nBuy now\n\nSainsbury's loaded lemon drizzle cake: \u00a312, Sainsbury\u2019s\n\nIf lemon drizzle is the birthday person\u2019s go-to cake of choice with their afternoon cuppa, they\u2019ll love this luxe version for a special occasion. It\u2019s not quite a lemon drizzle as you may know it. Instead, the base is three layers of madeira sponge, sandwiched together with layers of lemon curd with more drizzled on top. There was an impressive waft of white chocolate as we opened the box, with artfully displayed shards stuck on top of the cake, along with pieces of crunchy meringue and sweet lemon-tinged buttercream. A sophisticated crowd-pleaser for adult birthdays.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Birthday cakes\n\nWe feel the Sponge super sharing cake represents fantastic value for money \u2013 you\u2019re essentially getting 14 cakes in one! Each flavour tasted exactly as described and our guests loved fighting over their favourite (and saved us the faff of cutting it up!). From the supermarkets, both Heston\u2019s top hat and M&S\u2019s supersized Colin the caterpillar came in as joint favourites which will appeal to both kids and adults alike.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
