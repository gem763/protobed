They seemed timid in comparison to the heinous material he watched daily as a content moderator. Max \u2013 not his real name \u2013 found the workload heavy, but manageable. By the time he would eventually leave his job reviewing video as a contractor for a major social media platform, so many flagged clips were being deposited through his inbox that the review process for each could only stretch to 30 seconds.\n\nMost of them were benign, mistakenly flagged and easy to filter out. Once in a while, though, the worst of it \u2013 an animal abused, a head disconnected \u2013 would play peekaboo in the lineup. Over time, Max grew jaded, his skin a little thicker. Occasionally, the worst images would continue to flash in his memory, at great cost to his personal life.\n\n\u201cThis one time my girlfriend and I were fooling around on the couch,\u201d before Max\u2019s girlfriend made an innocuous joke and he shut down the conversation. \u201cI doubt, maybe a decade down the line, maybe I will stop encountering these things that bring it up, but who knows?\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever flagged something offensive or disturbing on Facebook, YouTube or Twitter, it will almost certainly have been sent to someone like Max. Every day, millions of videos, status updates and images are reviewed by teams of moderators around the globe, patiently sifting through batches upon batches of material to find and delete signs of graphic violence, sexual or animal abuse, racism and pornography.\n\nSometimes, these individuals are gig workers, clicking through image after image from the comfort of their own homes. Many more are to be found sitting at rows and rows of desks in anonymous offices in Silicon Valley, Florida, Morocco, Manila or Bangalore.\n\nScattered reports suggest that the psychological impact of long-term exposure to images of graphic violence is devastating, with many content moderators reporting symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), paranoia and political extremism. These same reports suggest little in the way of mental health support. Despite this evidence, however, there have been few, if any, formal psychological surveys in this area on people like Max.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no longitudinal study that I know of that has tracked these individuals once they are out of the employ of these firms,\u201d Sarah Roberts tells me. A professor of information studies at UCLA, Roberts interviewed moderators like Max for her book Behind the Screen. That social networks have not bothered to investigate the psychological impact their content can have on the moderators they employ is, she believes, out of a sense of wilful rather than genuine ignorance. \u201cNot knowing means plausible deniability of responsibility, to a certain extent.\u201d\n\nCommercial content moderation \u2013 a term coined by Roberts \u2013 has been around almost as long as the internet itself. Its promise as a medium for the free exchange of information and ideas also implied its abuse, a theory that rapidly became reality in the 1990s as popular forums like LambdaMOO became embroiled in sexual harassment scandals. This is no less true for the social networks of today.\n\n\u201cThese companies rose to prominence on a premise, sometimes implicit but many times overt, that what they were offering was an unfettered mechanism for people to express themselves,\u201d explains Roberts.\n\nThe existence of a social network, however, is only made possible by advertisers paying to access the vast consumer base of people choosing to express themselves on that platform. This, says Roberts, explains both the reason for and the nature of the relationship between these platforms and content moderators: it is an exercise in brand management, and one that is to be talked about as little as possible.\n\nAdvertisers would refuse to engage with social networks if they became known as breeding grounds for racial hatred, violent imagery or hate speech. Employing hundreds if not thousands of content moderators to winnow it out of their platforms is, therefore, the most expedient way of threading the vision with the reality of social networks, but not one that they are keen to promote.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 14 women using social media to change the world Show all 14 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

What followed was a viral social media campaign, #1000blackgirlbooks, calling for titles featuring black girls as protagonists to be donated. Nearly 4,000 books were donated, and Dias now tackles prejudice and advocates for diversity in literature. Getty 2/14 Rina Sawayama @rinasonline Rina Sawayama came in a blaze of neon and sci-fi coolness in early 2016 when she released the single 'Where U Are', which explored how humans interact with digital media. Since then, the singer and model from north London has been a trailblazer for intersectional feminism. Whether it\u2019s singing about her experiences as a pansexual woman or starting Twitter conversations about cultural appropriation in the media, Sawayama has taken both the music world and social media by storm with her politically vibrant work. A quick look at her Instagram account (@rinasonline) will reveal a confident woman who is not afraid to voice her opinions to her 141,000 followers. Getty 3/14 Chidera Eggerue @theslumflower At only 24 years old, Eggerue came to prominence with her viral 2017 social media campaign #SaggyBoobsMatter. 'It was only small-boobed women who were \u2018allowed\u2019 to not wear a bra,' the author said in an interview with The Guardian. \u201cI couldn\u2019t understand why \u2026 I had to challenge it.\u201d Her decision to not wear a bra shouldn\u2019t be deemed radical, yet here she is in 2019 challenging the ideas that women are pressured to confirming too. Women of all ages and shapes use the hashtag to show pride in themselves, as a result of the body positivity Eggerue championed. Her blog, The Slumflower, also discusses sexism, feminism and racism.

However, Scarlett Curtis is a trail-blazing feminist in other ways too. The author of Feminists Don\u2019t Wear Pink & Other Lies co-founded The Pink Protest \u2013 a collective helping young feminist activist to take action online \u2013 in 2017, all while using her social media to challenge misogyny whenever she encounters it. Getty 5/14 Tarana Burke @TaranaBurke Also known as the mother of the #MeToo movement, Tarana Burke is an American social activist who is largely responsible for the international movement against sexual harassment that went viral in October 2017. The phrase was first used in 2006 on Burke\u2019s Myspace account after she responded to a 13-year-old girl who had been sexually assaulted. The hashtag gained traction after actress Alyssa Milano encouraged victims of harassment to tweet the phrase. The call-out followed sexual abuse allegations against disgraced film producter Harvey Weinstein and has been used at least 19 million times on social media. Burke is a life-long activist for victims of sexual assault and harassment and continues to campaign such issues on social media. She has single-handedly changed the conversation on sexual violence. Getty 6/14 Sophie Sandberg @catcallsofnyc Tired of being unable to walk down the street without being constantly catcalled by men, activist Sophie Sandberg took to Instagram to expose an epidemic rife in society. Armed with multi-coloured chalk, she began documenting the horrific words that had been said to her all over New York in late 2016. Talking to the BBC about the project she stated: 'By writing [catcalls] in the same place that it happened, I hope the words may remember and think \"Oh those were my words\".' Women around the globe have been inspired by Sandberg\u2019s work and Instagram accounts of women chalking messages have since sprung up from Columbia to Bangladesh. Sophie Sandberg 7/14 Hannah Witton @hannahwitton Hannah Witton is a sex-positive YouTuber and author who has vlogged candidly about sexual health, relationships and women\u2019s issues since 2011. Over the years, the Mancunian has amassed over 500,000 subscribers. Witton is inspirationally confident and isn\u2019t afraid of talking about her sex life to her thousands of subscribers in videos such as 'How Many People Have I Slept With?' and 'The Benefits of Porn'. The vlogger is also a champion for body positivity (her most viewed video with over 8 million views is about the struggles of large boobs) and invisible illnesses \u2013 as she herself suffers from ulcerative colitis and proudly wears a stoma.

It began in 2015 with an Instagram account and now serves as a place to discuss topics affecting women without any fear of judgement. It has since grown into a weekly podcast and a series of organised events that have brought women together from across the globe. Talking to the BBC about the project, Aboah noted: 'At school there still isn\u2019t a place for girls and boys to realise they\u2019re not alone \u2026There is a light at the end of the tunnel. I promise that.' Getty 9/14 Laci Green @gogreen18 YouTuber Laci Green has been educating her subscribers on the nuances of sex education for over 10 years and has amassed over 1.4 million subscribers. The vlogger's videos, which are prominent in the sex-positive movement due to their candour, cover topics such as birth control, hormones and abortion in an attempt to remove the stigma surrounding them. Green is also very outspoken against slut-shaming and sexual harassment, being one of the first YouTubers to address the sexual harassment claims levied against vlogger Sam Pepper in 2014.

Meanwhile, her Instagram showcases all her campaigning work including protests on climate change and Brexit. Sarkar is also a senior editor at Novara Media \u2013 an independent, radical left-wing news organisation. Ash Sarkar 11/14 Gina Martin @ginamartin Writer and activist Gina Martin hit national headlines when she began a viral campaign to make 'upskirting' illegal. Taking to Facebook, Martin explained how a man took photos of her crotch without her permission and got away with it in a post that subsequently went viral in 2017. She then launched a petition for her case to be reopened and for the action to be made part of the 2003 Sexual Offences Act. Using the hashtag, #StopSkirtingTheIssue, the petition managed to get over 100,000 signatures. As of 2019, 'upskirting' is now illegal and this is largely down to the efforts of Martin. The activist continues to promote feminist causes to her 40,000 Instagram followers.

Videos include 'Why is \"LeftTube\" So White' and 'Cultures Are Not Costumes'. Getty\n\nMost content moderation is reactive. Content thought to be offensive and therefore in violation of a site\u2019s rules is flagged. Depending on the website \u2013 in addition to social media platforms, media outlets and e-commerce sites also employ moderating teams on a smaller scale \u2013 this material will go through a set of automated filters to check for obvious signs of pornography and copyright violations, before landing in the inbox of a dedicated moderating team, usually outside contractors.\n\nAt MegaTech, the pseudonymous social media platform where Max worked, the process of working through flagged videos quickly became rote. Videos are broken down into a string of 30 thumbnails and sent to moderators in groups of 10. After surveying the images for signs of animal abuse, graphic violence or pornography, among other things, Max would start on the next batch. A typical day would see him moderate up to 2,000 videos.\n\nLike Max, most of the screeners Roberts interviewed for her book were bright young twentysomethings straight out of university. They considered the job well paid and, for all its proximity to the likes of Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, prestigious. \u201cFor many people, what they saw in this job opportunity was, \u2018I\u2019m going to be working in the tech industry\u2019,\u201d she explains. \u201cAnd that\u2019s where things fall down.\u201d\n\nWhat many of these recruits discovered was an extremely demanding role with little in the way of pastoral support or prospects of advancement. Most content moderation work is kept at arm\u2019s length away from the platforms requiring it, outsourced either to freelancer networks like Amazon Mechanical Turk, boutique firms in the website\u2019s country of origin, or dedicated call centres in India and the Philippines.\n\nA few contractors, like Max, are brought literally, if not legally, in-house to work in the social network\u2019s headquarters. Even then, their lower status in the company is confirmed by their exclusion from certain privileges. \u201cThis is the stupidest thing in retrospect, but there was a rock-climbing wall in the lobby,\u201d Max told Roberts. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t use it because we weren\u2019t on the company insurance plan.\u201d\n\nMore serious was the absence of pastoral care for content moderators. At MegaTech, counselling was treated as an afterthought. Moderators were left to develop thicker skins, which seems to have reinforced a culture of cynicism around the mental health sessions that were promoted by management. Many succeeded, or at least gave the outward appearance that they had. The workers Roberts spoke to often denied that they experienced any long-term impact on their personal wellbeing.\n\n\u201cI had no reason to think otherwise when people would say things like that,\u201d she explains. \u201cBut you know, somewhere down the line in the interview, after a period of time, that same worker might say to me, \u2018Since I\u2019ve taken this job, I\u2019ve been drinking a lot. I find myself opening a beer as soon as I get home.\u2019\u201d Others are reluctant to socialise with friends, for fear that the conversation might turn to work, while some \u2013 like Max \u2013 find the worst material they\u2019ve seen intrude into their lives as disturbing flashbacks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m careful to differentiate between what these workers deal with psychologically and what workers who are in physical danger deal with,\u201d says Roberts. Even so, \u201cwhen you\u2019ve had some kind of psychological damage done, it\u2019s very difficult to put barriers up and leave it at the office, as it were, even though a lot of people would tell me that\u2019s what they would try to do. But I don\u2019t know how one does that.\u201d\n\nNone of the workers Roberts interviewed said they were comfortable with talking about what they had seen with friends and family, not only because they were reluctant to expose them to harmful material or remind themselves of it, but also because many had signed non-disclosure agreements prohibiting such conversations.\n\n\u201cIt goes to the point that these practices were treated, on the one hand, like trade secrets,\u201d explains Roberts. \u201cBut I also think it\u2019s because it was a dirty little secret towards the public.\u201d\n\nDespite this, workers like Max have some measure of pride in what they do. \u201cThey had a sense that they were doing something to the benefit of the greater good and on behalf of people who, unfortunately, didn\u2019t even know they existed, much less the work that they did,\u201d says Roberts. \u201cSo, while they had this real sense of pride and altruism, it was kind of diminished by the fact that their work was erased and invisible.\u201d\n\nThe looming prospect of their jobs being outsourced to India and the Philippines didn\u2019t help either. During Max\u2019s time at MegaTech, many of the more routine screentasks \u2013 deleting pornography, for example \u2013 were diverted to teams in these countries. \u201cThey paid me a decent amount, and it was still miserable,\u201d Max told Roberts. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine doing it for nothing.\u201d\n\nThe reality is a little more complex. While moderators in India and the Philippines are certainly paid less than their American counterparts, many consider the role as the first rung of a potential career in the sector. When Sabrina Ahmad was researching content moderation in India for the Oxford Internet Institute, she found herself interviewing screeners who had already been doing the job for one company or another for up to five years.\n\n\u201cA lot of them said, \u2018This is a career for me\u2019,\u201d says Ahmad, not only because it is seen in India as a stable profession, but also one with real prospects for advancement. \u201cPeople are getting promoted, which in of itself is a very big thing, and they get to work with the internet.\u201d\n\nEven so, content moderators in India and the Philippines are expected to work much harder than in the west, given the fragility of the contractual relationships at stake. Shift work is commonplace, as firms alter start times of their workforces to adapt to the moderation needs of clients in Europe and North America. It isn\u2019t unusual to see content screeners spill out of offices in downtown Manila to take advantage of happy hour at a nearby bar \u2013 at 7am.\n\nFor the screeners Roberts interviewed in Manila, the message was clear: \u201cIf you don\u2019t meet the metrics, if your accuracy is poor\u2026 we will lose the contract and that will affect all of the workers,\u201d she explains.\n\nNone of these workers are immune to the effects of the imagery they are required to vet. Counsellors for moderators in the Philippines have reported symptoms of PTSD, and Indian screeners have complained of long, stressful hours, completely incommensurate with their base salary.\n\nChange has been promised by social media platforms \u2013 what shape it will take remains to be seen. In 2017, Facebook announced its intention to dramatically increase its army of moderators from 4,500 to over 20,000, and invest in artificial intelligence research to lighten the load on human shoulders even further.\n\nOutsourcing content moderation to machines is, Roberts says, the ultimate desire of Silicon Valley\u2019s brightest minds. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not going to happen any time soon.\n\n\u201cWe know [human moderators] are engaged because of their sophisticated ability to judge and to make meaning and to have nuance, and to do all of that in a split second,\u201d explains Roberts. \u201cAnd computers just can\u2019t equal that.\u201d\n\nCurrently, AI is really only useful in select moderation scenarios. \u201cIt\u2019s really good at dealing with material that already exists in the world,\u201d says Roberts. \u201cWhen there\u2019s known bad material that gets recirculated, it can successfully find and rescind that material very quickly, before it really is even up, per se.\u201d\n\nEven so, Roberts believes that this will at best only result in a hybrid combination of human and machine analysis. After all, there\u2019ll always be a job for someone to train the algorithms.\n\n\u201cAnd I actually think that is to the benefit of most people, to have humans involved in vetting these tools,\u201d says Roberts.\n\nMeanwhile, the other solution \u2013 throwing more bodies at the moderation problem \u2013 does little in itself to alleviate the psychological trauma inflicted upon moderators. What, then, should be done?\n\nGreater provision of mental health support services in moderation firms is a no-brainer, says Roberts. Treating these workers with the dignity they deserve is another, according to the moderators she interviewed. \u201cThe first thing they say to me \u2013 it should come as no surprise \u2013 is \u2018Pay us. Pay us properly,\u2019\u201d says Roberts.\n\nInternet companies should also remember that their responsibility to their moderation workforce does not end with the termination of their employment. \u201cFigure out what people need over the long-term, when they are out of [the job] but you have fundamentally changed them in the course of having employed them,\u201d says Roberts.\n\nSome have waited to receive adequate compensation. A class action filed against Facebook in California last year cites the social network as having inflicted PTSD on moderators after it \u201cbombarded\u201d them with detestable content.\n\nModeration at the scale currently being performed could decline: the growth in encrypted messaging apps like WhatsApp suggest a retreat among younger demographics from public social media into private groups with private cultures. The need for some workforce though, exposed night and day to graphic content, is unlikely to disappear.\n\nAs well as imbuing Roberts with a renewed admiration for this new digital underclass, the experience of writing Behind the Screen gave her an unwelcome initiation into the sheer range of disturbing behaviours human beings are capable of. She recalls one particularly depressing conversation with an ex-content moderator for a news site whose comment sections had to be regularly scrubbed clean of homophobic, racist and sexist slurs.\n\n\u201cAt the end of that interview, she described herself as a \u2018sin eater,\u201d says Roberts, a figure in English folklore who consumed the sins of a deceased neighbour by eating bread passed over their body. Conversations like this made her question how much the architecture of the internet itself and its uncanny valley of a public commons has given deviants a new stage on which to dance.\n\n\u201cThe question becomes, to what extent are these systems themselves encouraging more and more debased, prurient, abhorrent content, which \u2013 frankly \u2013 is a representation of behaviour,\u201d says Roberts. \u201cI find that disturbing, all the time.\u201d\n\n\u2018Behind the Screen: Content Moderation in the Shadows of Social Media\u2019 is out now", "description": "Horror films were no longer convincing for Max. They seemed timid in comparison to the heinous material he watched daily as a content moderator.\u00a0Max \u2013 not his real name \u2013 found the workload heavy, but manageable. By the time he would eventually leave his job reviewing video as a contractor for a major social media platform, so many flagged clips were being deposited through", "authors": ["Greg Noone"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/04/17/content-moderator-2.jpg"}
