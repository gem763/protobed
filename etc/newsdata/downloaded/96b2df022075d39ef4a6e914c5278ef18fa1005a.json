They informed the 63-year-old that they planned on firing Jay Gruden, gauging the offensive line coach\u2019s interest in becoming the interim coach.\n\nBy that evening, Callahan had a new job. By Monday morning, Gruden did not.\n\nWith the Redskins 0-5, Callahan will now be tasked with leading an NFL team \u2014 a role he hasn\u2019t held since the Oakland Raiders fired him in 2003. And in his new capacity, Callahan made his priorities clear: He wants to re-establish the run.\n\nThrough five games, the Redskins have the third-fewest rushing attempts in the NFL with just 88. The ground game has been largely ineffective, averaging just 68.8 yards per game.\n\nAs for who will hand off the ball, Callahan said Sunday\u2019s starter has yet to be decided \u2014 except for the fact it won\u2019t be rookie Dwayne Haskins. Like his predecessor, Callahan views Haskins as not quite ready to start games, adding he plans on giving the 22-year-old more practice reps first.\n\nThat means Colt McCoy or Case Keenum will start against the winless Miami Dolphins. And get ready to see a lot more of Adrian Peterson.\n\n\u201cI envision ourselves as a running team,\u201d Callahan said. \u201cI\u2019d like to get our run game going. I think that\u2019s important because everything else is complementary off it \u2014 the run-action, passes and protections off of it complement your running game. If we can play two down football and go from second down to first down, that would be huge.\n\n\u201cIn order to do that, the consistency of the running game is going to have to take place.\u201d\n\nCallahan will make other changes to the Redskins\u2019 preparation, although he didn\u2019t disclose what those might be. During Gruden\u2019s five-plus seasons, the 52-year-old coach was knocked for his team\u2019s lack of discipline. Former safety D.J. Swearinger often suggested the team didn\u2019t practice hard enough.\n\nThat critique hasn\u2019t been lobbied toward Callahan \u2014 if anything, he\u2019s faced criticism for running the offensive line too hard after practice. The linemen are routinely the last position group off the field. As injuries have piled up at that position over the last few years, some have wondered if that\u2019s been the result of Callahan pushing them too far.\n\nAllen called Callahan, who has been with the Redskins since 2015, a \u201cseasoned veteran.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has a track record as a head coach,\u201d Allen said. \u201cHe is already implementing a plan for this team and schedules are going to change and things of that nature. It is 0-5. We have 11 regular season games left and we still can accomplish many of our goals.\u201d\n\nOne aspect Callahan won\u2019t change, for now at least, is the defensive staff. Callahan and the Redskins elected to keep oft-criticized defensive coordinator Greg Manusky, despite the defense giving up more than 30 points for the fourth time in five games.\n\nElsewhere, offensive coordinator Kevin O\u2019Connell will take over play-calling duties with Gruden gone.\n\nThe rest of the season is essentially an audition for O\u2019Connell, a 34-year-old offensive guru who has been compared to Rams coach Sean McVay. If the offense performs well, the former quarterback will be floated for the Redskins\u2019 job.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be unheard of for the offensive coordinator to be named head coach over the interim, either. The Cleveland Browns did exactly that over the offseason, replacing Gregg Williams with Freddie Kitchens.\n\nCallahan, meanwhile, called his promotion \u201cbittersweet.\u201d\n\nIronically, this isn\u2019t the first time he has replaced a Gruden \u2014 taking over for Jay\u2019s brother, Jon, in 2002. In two seasons, Callahan went 15-17 \u2014 making the Super Bowl his first year \u2014 but was fired following a 4-12 campaign the next year. He then coached four years at Nebraska at the collegiate level.\n\nNow leading the Redskins, Callahan said there\u2019s no \u201cmagic formula\u201d for a turnaround.\n\nAsked if he was angling to be named to be Washington\u2019s next coach on a permanent basis, Callahan dismissed the idea.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been auditioning for over 20 years in the National Football League,\u201d Callahan said. \u201cI\u2019m not auditioning. Nothing but trying to get our team better and really be focused on Miami. It\u2019s a good opportunity to help improve our team and to lead the team forward.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not worried about me; it\u2019s not about me. It\u2019s about our team, and it\u2019s about what we can do to get us out of this rut that we\u2019re currently in.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
