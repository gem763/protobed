USA TODAY\n\nSaturday is what we\u2019ve been waiting for.\n\nAfter rain and lightning delays, while watching a Big 12 back soar to the top of the nation\u2019s rushing statistics, after listening to Mike Gundy blow up about the Internet one week and at a reporter the next ...\n\nYes, it\u2019s time for another Red River Showdown.\n\nFinally, the best two teams in this conference will clash \u2014 Oklahoma against Texas on Saturday at the Cotton Bowl.\n\nThey\u2019ve been atop the weekly Power Ratings all season, and they\u2019ll likely be there at this time next week, as well.\n\nBut will Lincoln Riley\u2019s Sooners continue No. 1?\n\nOr will Tom Herman\u2019s bunch replace them?\n\nOklahoma running back Trey Sermon avoids a tackle attempt by the Texas defense during their game at the Cotton Bowl in 2018. (Photo: Tim Heitman, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nWho wins the quarterback battle, Oklahoma\u2019s Heisman contender Jalen Hurts, or Texas\u2019 Sam Ehlinger?\n\nSet your recording device if you can\u2019t watch it live. It promises to be a dandy.\n\nHere's the Week 7 Big Power Rankings:\n\nNo. 1 Oklahoma (5-0, 2-0 Big 12)\n\nLast week\u2019s ranking: 1\n\nLast weekend: Defeated Kansas 45-20.\n\nIn a nutshell: It\u2019s doubtful that Jalen Hurts will be rattled while playing in Saturday\u2019s Red River Showdown. He faced Auburn in the annual Alabama-Auburn Iron Bowl, so playing against Texas Saturday in Dallas isn\u2019t likely to elicit a bunch of pre-game nervousness. For what it\u2019s worth, the Alabama transfer completed 40 of 59 passes for 451 yards and four touchdowns in three Iron Bowls.\n\nOn deck: Saturday vs. Texas, noon ET, Fox.\n\nPOWER RANKINGS: ACC | Big 12 | Big Ten | Pac-12 | SEC\n\nRE-RANK: Ohio State takes over as the latest No. 1 in NCAA Re-Rank 1-130\n\nWINNERS AND LOSERS: Highs and lows from Week 6 in college football\n\nNo. 2 Texas (4-1, 2-0)\n\nLast week\u2019s ranking: 2\n\nLast weekend: Defeated West Virginia 42-31.\n\nIn a nutshell: Saturday\u2019s four-interception game could bode well for the Longhorns, who are 14-2 under Tom Herman when forcing multiple turnovers. Ehlinger, the Big 12\u2019s second-best quarterback, must be good at keeping possessions alive and keeping the Sooner\u2019s high-octane offense on the sidelines. It\u2019s an offense that\u2019s averaging a nation\u2019s-leading 643.8 yards and 53.4 points a game.\n\nOn deck: Saturday vs. Oklahoma, noon, Fox.\n\nNo. 3 Baylor (5-0, 2-0)\n\nLast week\u2019s ranking: 4\n\nLast weekend: Defeated Kansas State 31-12.\n\nIn a nutshell: Underrated team led by underrated quarterback. Baylor and Charlie Brewer are proving doubters wrong, while showing the Big 12 world that the Bears are no flash in the pan. Winning by double-figures at Kansas State was impressive, and Saturday, Matt Rhule\u2019s team has another chance to do big things against the team that just knocked off Oklahoma State.\n\nOn deck: Saturday vs. Texas Tech, 4 p.m., FS1.\n\nNo. 4 Iowa State (3-2, 1-1)\n\nLast week\u2019s ranking: 6\n\nLast weekend: Defeated TCU 49-24.\n\nIn a nutshell: The Cyclones roll as quarterback Brock Purdy rolls. Against what\u2019s usually a very good TCU defense Saturday, the sophomore had an impressive 349 yards of offense \u2013 247 on completions to 10 receivers, and 102 on a dozen rushes. It\u2019s safe to speculate that coaches will wind him up every game, because he\u2019s not only the Cyclones\u2019 best quarterback, but also the best rushing threat.\n\nOn deck: Saturday at West Virginia, 4 p.m., ESPN.\n\nNo. 5 Texas Tech (3-2, 1-1)\n\nLast week\u2019s ranking: 9\n\nLast weekend: Defeated Oklahoma State 45-35.\n\nIn a nutshell: Fans wondered with concern when Matt Wells named Jett Duffey the starting quarterback while Alan Bowman recovered from injury. All he did Saturday, was complete 26 of 44 passes for 424 yards and four touchdowns.\n\nOn deck: Saturday at Baylor, 4 p.m., FS1.\n\nNo. 6 Oklahoma State (4-2, 1-2)\n\nLast week\u2019s ranking: 3\n\nLast weekend: Lost to Texas Tech 45-35.\n\nIn a nutshell: At least Chuba Hubbard continued playing all right, the nation\u2019s top rusher adding 156 more yards on 36 carries to his impressive stats. Other than that? Nothing. Quarterback Spencer Sanders threw three interceptions and fumbled twice, then told reporters: \u201cNot the offensive line, not the receivers, not the defense. I did. Spencer Sanders had five turnovers. I\u2019ve just got to do better.\u201d There\u2019s some cleaning up to do before returning to the field against Baylor.\n\nOn deck: Oct. 19 vs. Baylor.\n\nNo. 7 West Virginia (3-2, 1-1)\n\nLast week\u2019s ranking: 8\n\nLast weekend: Lost to Texas 42-31.\n\nIn a nutshell: Quarterback Austin Kendall is still a bit of a work in progress, after throwing four interceptions in a nonetheless close game. He\u2019s thrown seven interceptions this season, and he\u2019s preparing this week to face an Iowa State pass defense that\u2019s at time shaky. Kendall, however, kept the Mountaineers close with 31-of-46 passing for 367 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nOn deck: Saturday vs. Iowa State, 4 p.m., ESPN.\n\nNo. 8 TCU (3-2, 1-1)\n\nLast week\u2019s ranking: 5\n\nLast weekend: Lost to Iowa State 49-24.\n\nIn a nutshell: In case you missed it, here\u2019s what coach Gary Patterson said after Iowa State beat his team in all ways Saturday: \u201cThey kicked our butts. Every phase, pretty simple. Not much more you can say.\u201d TCU came into the game averaging 275.2 rushing yards, but managed just 63, before forced into second-half comeback passing mode.\n\nOn deck: Oct. 19 at Kansas State.\n\nNo. 9 Kansas State (3-2, 0-2)\n\nLast week\u2019s ranking: 7\n\nLast weekend: Lost to Baylor 31-12.\n\nIn a nutshell: The Wichita Eagle named punter Devin Anctil Kansas State\u2019s MVP after a second Big 12 double-figure loss in a row last Saturday. He was very good on a day when his teammates weren\u2019t. It\u2019s been tough going after a 3-0 non-conference start included an upset win at Mississippi State. The offense has averaged just 12.5 points in Big 12 losses against Baylor and Oklahoma State. The defense has given up an average of 28.5. Chris Klieman\u2019s team has a bye week in which to figure stuff out.\n\nOn deck: Oct. 19 vs. TCU.\n\nNo. 10 Kansas (2-4, 0-3)\n\nLast week\u2019s ranking: 10\n\nLast weekend: Lost to Oklahoma 45-20.\n\nIn a nutshell: You could see this one coming, coach Les Miles\u2019 Sunday firing of offensive coordinator Les Koenning. Take away the Jayhawks\u2019 48-24 victory at Boston College, and Kansas has averaged just 17.8 points. That\u2019s not cutting it in the high-scoring Big 12, so it\u2019s starting over with Brent Dearmon, who Miles promoted from senior offensive analyst. \u201cBrent is one of the brightest individuals I have encountered in all my years of coaching,\u201d said Miles, whose 16 seasons as a college coach include stops at Oklahoma State and LSU, where his team won the 2011 national title. Dearmon was the head coach at NAIA Bethel University last season.\n\nOn deck: Oct. 19 at Texas.", "description": "Baylor and Iowa State ticked up this week in the Big 12 power rankings as eyes now turn to Oklahoma and Texas meeting in the Cotton Bowl.", "authors": ["Randy Peterson", "Published P.M.
