Called the Apple Watch Series 5 and iPad, the devices follow the unveiling of Apple\u2019s latest iPhones, the iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max.\n\nAvailable Sept. 20 and starting at $399, the Apple Watch Series 5 brings a new always-on display and built-in compass feature. The iPad, meanwhile, gets a larger display and will launch Sept. 30 for $329.\n\nAn Apple Watch Series 5 is seen on display in the demonstration area during a launch event at their headquarters in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 10, 2019.

It now stays on all the time regardless of whether you\u2019re looking at it or not. This always-on display allows you to check the time, as well as complications like distance walked or the weather, without having to raise your watch or tap its display.\n\nSurprisingly, Apple managed to get the same amount of battery life out of the Series 5 as the Series 4. To achieve that, the company says it created a new kind of screen for the watch called a low-temperature polysilicone and oxide display. The Series 5 watch also gets an ultra-low power display driver and new ambient light sensor. All of that essentially means that the display uses less power than previous versions of the Apple Watch.\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 5 with its always-on display.

When not in use, the always-on display runs at a lower display brightness and loses features like the second hand. But raise the watch, even slightly, to your eyes, and the display lights up. It actually felt like the display activation was faster than the Series 4, which makes sense considering the Series 5 also gets a new, more powerful processor.\n\nThe Series 5 with its display active. (Image: Howley) More\n\nApple says that it has optimized its various watch faces for the new always-on display, as well as the Workout app. That means you\u2019ll be able to see your workout progress without having to lift your watch all the way to eye level or tap the display, which can be difficult during certain exercises.\n\nOther smartwatches already offer always-on displays, including Fitbit\u2019s new Versa 2, but the Apple Watch\u2019s display doesn\u2019t turn to grey scale when not active, so your apps will still have color.\n\nApple has also added a new built-in compass to the Apple Watch, which makes tracking your exact location on the Maps app on the watch easier. If you\u2019re a serious outdoors enthusiast who\u2019d rather keep their phone at home, the compass should be a welcome addition to the watch.", "description": "Apple's new Apple Watch Series 5 and iPad bring incremental updates and a larger size that should entice consumers.", "authors": ["Daniel Howley", "Technology Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7qrJgCMwd_99wrce83TSxA--~B/aD0yNjEwO3c9MzkxNDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/a02673a0-d41f-11e9-bf5f-d7f62eb45ea8", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
