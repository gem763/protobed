Ten percent more teenagers have died by suicide each year since then.\n\nNetflix's controversial show, 13 Reasons Why came under scrutiny for 'glamorizing' suicide in its depiction of the aftermath of a high school students death by suicide.\n\nHealth officials worried that the show might trigger an increase in suicides.\n\nIndeed, researchers found a bump in online searches after the show's March 2017 premier - but the latest data barely capture teen suicide deaths that took place after the show debuted, suggesting that the trend began long before 13 Reasons Why did.\n\nHomicide deaths have declined among teenagers between 15 and 19 (green) while suicides (blue) show up by 76% between 2000 and 2017\n\nAfter declining from 2007 to 2014, homicides are back on the rise among teenagers, increasing by 30 percent since 2014.\n\nTrends in the oldest group included in the report have been somewhat less dramatic - although the increase in suicides has accelerated since 2013, increasing by six percent year-over-year.\n\nAfter falling by 28 percent from 2000 to 2014, the homicide rate had ticked back up by 15 percent by 2017, the CDC reports.\n\nThe new report doesn't attempt these disturbing trends, or why one form of violent death might decline while the other surges so dramatically.\n\nBut it follows broad reports that rates of anxiety, depression and mental health issues in general are on the rise among kids, teens and young adults in the US.\n\nA recent American Psychological Association study found that the the number of adolescents who reported enduring 'serous psychological distress' have increased significantly among both adolescents and young adults.\n\nAs of 2018, one if five teenagers between 12 and 18 had at least one mental health disorder.\n\nDepression, trauma, alcohol and substance abuse disorders and access to lethal means are top risk factors for suicide among young people, and working to address each of these could save the lives of scores of young people in the US.", "description": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's report on violent deaths shows that while homicides have fallen since 2000, suicides among 10- to 24-year-olds have risen sharply.", "authors": ["Natalie Rahhal Deputy Health Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/17/19843698-0-image-a-3_1571329851845.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
