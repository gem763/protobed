An independent regulatory commission will decide whether Silva deserves a six-game ban and has the power to increase or decrease that depending on mitigating circumstances.\n\nThe FA said: \u201cIt is alleged that the Manchester City player\u2019s activity breaches FA Rule E3(1) as it was insulting and/or improper and/or brought the game into disrepute. It is further alleged that the activity constitutes an \u2018Aggravated Breach\u2019, which is defined in FA Rule E3(2), as it included reference, whether expressed or implied, to race and/or colour and/or ethnic origin.\u201d\n\nSilva, who has until 9 October to respond to the charge, was accused of using a \u201cracial stereotype\u201d by Kick It Out, football\u2019s anti-discrimination charity, after tweeting a picture of Mendy as a child next to the Conguitos logo with the caption \u201cGuess who?\u201d. The tweet was later deleted and Silva has expressed regret in a letter to the FA at any unintentional hurt he may have caused. The 25-year-old has also received support from Mendy, with whom he has a close friendship with the pair having also played together at Monaco.\n\nSilva faced further criticism when an Instagram video from an earlier date emerged of him appearing to reference Mendy\u2019s skin colour by asking him why he was naked. Mendy is wearing a black T-shirt in the clip.\n\nPep Guardiola has said that \u201cBernardo is maybe going to take a lesson and it\u2019s not going to happen again\u201d and defended Silva\u2019s character on multiple occasions last week.\n\n\u201cIf they believe, if the people believe, that Bernardo is this type of player they are completely wrong,\u201d City\u2019s manager said. \u201cThey judged one joke, I judge three years every single day with him and how he is and his friendship. Nothing more to add.\u201d\n\nGuardiola also defended Silva by arguing that Mendy bears a resemblance to the Conguitos logo. \u201cIt was just a joke,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a cartoon and the face is quite similar. The same happened a thousand million times with white people.\u201d", "description": "Manchester City\u2019s Bernardo Silva has been charged with misconduct by the Football Association over a tweet to his teammate Benjamin Mendy", "authors": ["Jacob Steinberg"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5ad914cbae1492e1e9665ca5a1eaab6a1f4b94c/872_141_3317_1990/master/3317.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0df989578be48f5616461183107c8460"}
