I\u2019ve just tried to beat myself. And I think I found a formula that works. I just want more.\u201d\n\nJohnson-Thompson fell short of the 7,000-point mark, something she says is one of her main career goals, but finished with the sixth-best heptathlon points haul of all time.\n\nThe 25-year-old Thiam, who walked away from her third attempt in the javelin, finished the 800m in 2:18.93, finishing 304 points behind Johnson-Thompson.\n\nJohnson-Thompson said of her Belgian rival: \u201cI witnessed her making 7,000 points and showing that it is doable and also a requirement in order to win. She\u2019s raised the bar and I\u2019m glad I\u2019m able to follow and step up.\u201d\n\nDina Asher-Smith had won the 200 metres on Wednesday to become the first British woman to claim a global sprint title.", "description": "Katarina Johnson-Thompson clinched gold in the heptathlon with the year's best performance after holding off the challenge of defending champion Nafissatou Thiam on Thursday to give Britain their second title at this year's world championships.", "authors": ["Gabrielle T\u00e9trault-Farber", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436809558&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF921T9"}
