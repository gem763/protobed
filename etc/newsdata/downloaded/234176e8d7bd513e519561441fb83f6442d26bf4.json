Prez Won\u2019t Read All About It", "language": "en", "text": "Trump\u2019s move is not without precedent.\n\nAs Michael Grynbaum reported in The Times, J.F.K. was widely mocked when he canceled The New York Herald Tribune and said he would read The St. Louis Post-Dispatch instead. After sneaking in copies of The Tribune for a while, President Kennedy resumed openly reading it.\n\nThe same will happen with Trump. He can\u2019t quit us. The relationship of Donald and the media is the greatest love affair \u2014 and mutual addiction \u2014 of all time. When he cancels subscriptions, it\u2019s like an angry lover tearing up pictures of a woman he is obsessed with but cannot win over.\n\nNewspapers are liquid history, with deadlines pressing and people trying to pull the wool over our eyes. God knows, we\u2019re not perfect. But we\u2019re definitely better arbiters of objective reality than Donald Trump, Lindsey Graham, Kevin McCarthy and Steve Scalise.\n\nGiven the perverted values we\u2019ve seen in other institutions, such as Facebook, the Catholic Church, the Bush-Cheney White House and the Trump White House, it feels good to be part of an institution that aims to illuminate rather than obscure.\n\nSpeaking of spin, I\u2019ve got a push alert for Kellyanne Conway: No matter how many reporters you dress down, your tortured triangle with George and Donald is a real story. No one in Washington has seen anything like it since the days of Martha Mitchell.\n\nSo, Mr. President, given that you are shorn from The Times and The Post, I feel an obligation to fill you in on what you\u2019re missing:\n\nYou\u2019re about to be impeached.\n\nNancy Pelosi is kicking your butt.\n\nThe Deep State is not only out to get you; it\u2019s gotten you.\n\nThe Republicans on the Hill who tried to crash the hearing \u2014 even though their fellow Republicans were taking part \u2014 looked like fanatical losers. Matt Gaetz compared his stunt to the Spartans and the movie \u201c300,\u201d but he\u2019s no Gerard Butler and his pizza party was lame.", "description": "Snowflake Trump wants us off his lawn.", "authors": ["Maureen Dowd"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/27/opinion/27Dowd/27Dowd-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
