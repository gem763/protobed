Helium-3 is a non-radioactive isotope that could be used for power.\n\nThe Artemis program will also make history by landing the first woman on the moon. \u201cAt this point, any of the 45 active astronauts are fair game for missions to the moon,\u201d Feustel said. \u201cWe\u2019re all interested in this mission.\u201d\n\nNASA CHIEF: FUTURE ARTEMIS MOON MISSIONS WILL BUILD ON APOLLO 11\u2019S INCREDIBLE LEGACY\n\nFeustel, who has a Ph.D. in geological sciences, told Fox News that he would love to see the lunar surface up close.\n\nA veteran of three spaceflights, he also acknowledges that the 2024 deadline is looming. \u201cIt is close and it\u2019s a formidable challenge for us,\u201d he said. \u201cThe key is going to be the allocation of funds \u2013 I think we can do it with the right funding in place.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing will happen if we can\u2019t get the federal government to provide the allocation and for everyone to get on board -- that's what we're working on,\" he added.\n\nBUZZ ALDRIN PREDICTS ARTEMIS PROGRAM WILL LEAVE DECADES-LONG LEGACY LIKE APOLLO\n\nFeustel recently announced the winners of Emmy\u2019s in science and technology programming at Lincoln Center in New York. The nominations were announced by astronauts on the International Space Station. \u201cIt brought some visibility to the work that NASA is doing,\u201d Feustel told Fox News.\n\nNASA recently revealed details of its vision for the Artemis Moon Lander that will return U.S. astronauts to the lunar surface.\n\nIn a notice posted to the Federal Business Opportunities website, NASA seeks \u201cproposals from industry for the development of integrated human lunar landers and execution of crewed flight demonstrations to the lunar surface by 2024.\u201d\n\nON APOLLO 11 ANNIVERSARY, PENCE ANNOUNCES THAT ORION CAPSULE FOR MANNED MOON MISSIONS IS READY FOR DEBUT FLIGHT\n\nSpeaking at Kennedy Space Center on the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon landing on July 20, Vice President Mike Pence also announced that the Orion capsule that will take American astronauts back to the moon is ready.\n\nIn documents posted on the FBO website, NASA explains that astronauts will be flown in an Orion spacecraft to the \u2018Gateway,\u2019 a space station orbiting the moon. The Gateway vessel will be used to support the transfer of crew and supplies into the Moon Lander.\n\nInitial mission capability for 2024 involves landing two astronauts on the moon\u2019s South Pole. Astronauts will live and work out of the lander for 6.5 days, according to NASA.\n\nTO PREPARE ASTRONAUTS FOR THE MOON, NASA IS USING A GIANT WATER TANK\n\nLonger term, the lander will need to transport four people to the lunar South Pole.\n\nNASA anticipates that a three-stage landing system will be used to take astronauts to and from the lunar surface. \"The three-stage concept includes a transfer element for the journey from the lunar Gateway to low-lunar orbit, a descent element to carry the crew to the surface, and an ascent element to return them to the Gateway,\u201d it explained, in a statement. \u201cFrom there, they would board Orion for the 250,000-mile trip back to Earth.\u201d\n\nThe space agency, however, says that it is also interested in alternative approaches \u201cthat can accomplish the same long-term goals of global lunar access and a reusable landing system.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAfter Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin set foot on the moon on July 20, 1969, only 10 more men, all Americans, walked on the lunar surface. The last NASA astronaut to set foot on the moon was Apollo 17 Mission Cmdr. Gene Cernan on Dec. 14, 1972.\n\nFollow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogers", "description": "From mining clean energy to harnessing polar ice for rocket fuel propellant, America\u2019s return to the Moon could unlock a vast trove of space resources, according to NASA astronaut Drew Feustel.", "authors": ["James Rogers"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/DrewFeustelGetty2018.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
