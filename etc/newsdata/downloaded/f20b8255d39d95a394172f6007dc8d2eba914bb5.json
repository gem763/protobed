Already Tyrone (Alan Halsall) has forgotten to apply for a place at the local school for Hope, resulting in home schooling her, Hope has started a fire in the factory (thankfully it was only a small fire) and now it seems things are about to get even more complicated for Fiz, as it appears Hope\u2019s live-in tutor Jade (Lottie Henshall) is hiding something\u2026\n\nBefore Jade\u2019s arrival, Fiz was acting strange around Tyrone which lead him to believe she was having an affair when in actual fact she had been speaking to Jade (who was Hope\u2019s teaching assistant in Birmingham) who was offering her advice on Hope\u2019s home schooling. At Fiz\u2019s invitation, Jade arrives at No.9 to be Hope\u2019s live-in tutor. However whilst everyone was pleased to welcome her, Evelyn (Maureen Lipman) sneered at her willingness to drop everything\u2026\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Jade serves breakfast Evelyn eyes her suspiciously. A delighted Fiz tells Tyrone that she\u2019s accepted Gary\u2019s (Mikey North) offer of a job at the furniture shop. Meanwhile Evelyn quietly lets herself into No.9 and catches Jade rifling through the drawers.\n\nWhen Jade tells Evelyn all about her terrible marriage, she explains that if it weren\u2019t for Fiz she would have never survived and how she was actually searching for a photo she could get framed to say thanks. Fiz returns home and is taken aback to find Jade pouring her heart out to Evelyn about her abusive ex-husband.\n\nAfter Fiz gets in trouble with Gary whilst working at the furniture shop, she tells him to stick the job and walks out. Later, Jade persuades Gary to reinstate Fiz at the shop, in turn securing her own job.\n\nWhat could Jade be up to?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Fiz is in danger in Corrie.", "authors": ["Calli Kitson"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/04_09_coro_fiz_gary_02-f92e_1570185333.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
