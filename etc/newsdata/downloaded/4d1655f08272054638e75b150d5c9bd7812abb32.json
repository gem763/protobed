He reached on a fielder\u2019s choice in the fourth and eventually scored his first run on a wild pitch. He collected his first two RBIs on a bouncer that landed just inside the line and rolled into the left field corner for a triple in the fifth. With the pro-Cubs crowd cheering for him in the sixth, he hit a two-run single up the middle. He received another loud ovation in the eighth before grounding out.\n\nHis first three at-bats were against rookie Cal Quantrill, whose Stanford careers overlapped by one season.\n\nHoerner made a backhanded grab of Nick Martini\u2019s shot in the first for his first assist, and made another nice play on Wil Myers\u2019 grounder in the second.\n\nFans chanted \u201cNico! Nico! Nico!\u201d as the team headed for the dugout after the final out.\n\nNicholas Castellanos hit a two-run homer in the first inning, his 25th, and Kyle Schwarber had a solo shot leading off the five-run fifth, his 35th, to back Kyle Hendricks, who pitched 5 2/3 strong innings.\n\nHendricks (10-9) was hit on the lower right leg by a comebacker by Manny Machado in the fifth but stayed in the game. He allowed two runs, one earned, on seven hits while striking out five and walking one.\n\nQuantrill (6-7) allowed eight runs and 10 hits in 4 1/3 innings, struck out five and walked two. He\u2019s allowed eight runs in each of his last three starts. He\u2019s lost four straight starts.\n\nCUBS INJURIES\n\nThe Cubs said B\u00e1ez could return if they reach the playoffs. He saw a hand specialist in Chicago who confirmed he has a hairline fracture of his left thumb. B\u00e1ez was hurt on a headfirst slide into second base during a 4-0 loss to Milwaukee on Sept. 1. He is batting .281 with 29 homers and 85 RBIs.\n\nRussell was hit in the head by a pitch from Milwaukee\u2019s Adrian Houser on Sunday.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCubs: LHP Jose Quintana (13-8, 4.00) is scheduled to start Tuesday night. He\u2019s 2-0 with a 4.50 ERA in three career starts against San Diego.\n\nPadres: Rookie RHP Roland Bola\u00f1os (0-1, 3.00) is scheduled to make his second career start and first at Petco Park. He threw five innings of two-run ball at Arizona in his MLB debut a week of Tuesday but took the loss.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Touted prospect Nico Hoerner had three hits and four RBIs in his big league debut and made some nice plays at shortstop for the Chicago Cubs, who beat the San Diego Padres 10-2 Monday night to snap a three-game losing streak.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Bernie Wilson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/10/cubs_padres_baseball_37347_c0-222-5304-3314_s1770x1032.jpg?775c51d32d274a212fc078b454e4a0dc7e9c7958", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
