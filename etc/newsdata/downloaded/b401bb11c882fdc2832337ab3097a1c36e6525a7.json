The head coach, Gary Gold, has carried on the good work of John Mitchell, ensuring dominance over Canada and a rise to No 14 in the world. Scotland were beaten in Houston, Samoa knocked off twice. But the Eagles\u2019 have also lost heavily to Ireland and the Maori and in Japan their last game, against Tonga in Hanazono on 13 October, presents their only realistic hope of a win. Unfortunately, it will come after brutal tests against England, France and Argentina.\n\nWhat is different about the Eagles\u2019 approach to this year\u2019s Everest is that their squad is almost entirely paid to play. There are top-flight pros, like fly-half AJ MacGinty of Sale, hooker Joe Taufete\u2019e of Worcester and tighthead Titi Lamositele of Saracens. There are second-tier stalwarts like locks Nick Civetta (Doncaster) and Ben Landry (Ealing). But most importantly, a hardcore of the squad has had two years of Major League Rugby at home.\n\nThe wing Blaine Scully is captain, in fact not currently paid by a club after five years with Leicester and Cardiff. His back line is swift and, perhaps more importantly, coached in defence by Jaque Fourie, a World Cup winner with South Africa in 2007. Paul Lasike of Harlequins, plucked from Utah Warriors, once a Chicago Bears full-back, is a monstrous midfield presence.\n\nBut it is up front where the Eagles\u2019 troubles often begin, with more experienced packs able to get a shunt on, undermining the defenders behind. In Japan the forwards will have to absorb plenty of punishment \u2013 and deal out as much in return as they can.\n\nThere will be no Samu Manoa, the former Northampton, Toulon and Cardiff back-row having retired from internationals. But there is talent: Hanco Germishuys of the Glendale Raptors is a pocket battleship of a flanker, as South African in style as his name suggests; Tony Lamborn is an experienced back-row out of Hawke\u2019s Bay, New Zealand. There is ballast at lock, Greg Peterson of Bordeaux B\u00e8gles a bearded lump half the size of Greenland. In the front row, Taufete\u2019e is one of the biggest hookers in world rugby and a try-scoring threat \u2013 ask the Scots \u2013 and Lamositele has started a European final. With that lot present, if fatigue can be managed, the English, French and Argentinian packs might face a bit of a fight.\n\nMight. Expect at least one game to be sacrificed with a second-string, as happened four years ago against South Africa, producing defeat 64 to zip. Otherwise, expect gung-ho, hard-hitting, very American defiance. This team will be on NBC back home, MLR is growing and a bid to host is possible.
