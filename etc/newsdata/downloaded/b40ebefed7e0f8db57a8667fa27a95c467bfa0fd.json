The situation was made worse by U.S. sanctions against China\u2019s Huawei Technologies, a major purchaser of Samsung\u2019s chips.\n\nAnalysts say Samsung\u2019s sales during the third quarter should have been boosted by the launch of its Galaxy Note 10 smartphone and an improvement in display shipments driven by the release of new devices by Apple.\n\nThe company did not provide a detailed account of its performance by division. Its finalized earnings report is due later this month.", "description": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 Samsung Electronics on Tuesday predicted its operating profit for the last quarter will fall by more than half from a year", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/08/1d1862_south-korea-earns-samsung-electronics-11753-visitors-tour-logo-samsung-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
