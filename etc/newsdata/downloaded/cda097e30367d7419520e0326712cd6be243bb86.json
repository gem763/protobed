She wants to raise that tax to 30 percent while increasing the tax on ammunition to 50 percent.\n\nBecause excise taxes are paid directly by the consumer\u2013the taxes are added to the price of the goods\u2013this means a $500 gun would immediately cost $515 and the price for a $20 box of ammo would immediately rise to $30.\n\nWarren claims this taxation policy would \u201cbring in new federal revenue\u201d that can used for \u201cgun violence prevention.\u201d And she simultaneously suggests the tax would raise the price on guns and ammo to a level sufficient to stifle sales.\n\nShe does not explain how reducing sales via tax policy can bring in new revenue. Rather, she cites\u201dfederal excise tax on cigarettes, domestic wine, or even airline tickets,\u201d to try to bolster justify pushing for more taxes on firearms and bullets.\n\nIronically, Warren also wants government-imposed limits on the number of guns Americans can purchase. This would cut sales as well, further reducing tax revenue.\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.
