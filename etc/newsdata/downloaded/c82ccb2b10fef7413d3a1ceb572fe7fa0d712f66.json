The show, which focused on the daily lives of ordinary Hongkongers struggling to make a living, struck a chord with many, and the lyrics of \u201cBelow the Lion Rock\u201d evoked the hardships people faced while still trying to come together \u201cto pen the everlasting Hong Kong story.\u201d The show and song gave birth to the so-called \u201cLion Rock spirit\u201d \u2014 but the ballad, while beautiful, is not easy to sing along to. And as Hong Kong has evolved into a first-world society, its lyrics no longer resonate in quite the same way, particularly with young people who dream of more than just a job that keeps food on the table.\n\nWe did, briefly, have the Cantonese song \u201cFor Freedom.\u201d Written exactly 30 years ago when the pro-democracy movement in China seemed to be gaining momentum and Hong Kong\u2019s entertainment business was at its peak and still at the forefront of the city\u2019s political fights, the song was written and performed by the era\u2019s brightest Canto-pop stars. \u201cFor Freedom\u201d served as the theme of the Concert for Democracy in China, a 12-hour marathon concert attended by hundreds of thousands of people to raise money for students in Beijing on May 27, 1989. Structured like an eighties power ballad, with a distinctive rhythm, \u201cFor Freedom\u201d is largely in Cantonese, though the key lines \u2014 \u201cLove freedom, for freedom\u201d \u2014 are in Mandarin.\n\nAt the time, 10-year-old me also attempted to play the song on the piano at home, despite my very limited skills. But China\u2019s pro-democracy movement ended in bloodshed and in the decades since, \u201cFor Freedom\u201d seems to have been largely forgotten. The celebrities who once led the people of Hong Kong in singing \u201cfor freedom, you and I, hand in hand, fight together\u201d have either passed away or moved on. Some, like Alan Tam, Kenny Bee and Maria Cordero, who sang for students in Beijing 30 years ago, have become supporters of the police today, attending pro-police, pro-government rallies.\n\nThen there was \u201cBoundless Ocean, Vast Skies,\u201d a song by the legendary Hong Kong rock band Beyond. The song evokes a yearning for freedom in spite of obstacles. Five years ago, it became the de facto anthem of the pro-democracy Umbrella Movement, eclipsing another song, \u201cRaise the Umbrella,\u201d which had been written to capture the spirit of the protests. But the song is relatively mellow; its appeal to the emotions is subtle. It does not have the swelling orchestral strains of \u201cGlory to Hong Kong,\u201d which seem to have channeled Hongkongers\u2019 hopes, fears and despair in a unique way.\n\nAs \u201cGlory to Hong Kong\u201d spread like wildfire over the past week, echoing through the atriums of shopping malls across the city day after day, I felt both inspired and nervous. The song both symbolizes and accelerates the birth of a renewed Hong Kong identity \u2014 the last thing Beijing wants. It was only a few months ago that the Hong Kong government was planning to introduce a new national anthem law that proposed making intentional insults to \u201cMarch of the Volunteers\u201d \u2014 the national anthem of the People\u2019s Republic of China \u2014 a criminal offense. That bill has been postponed amid the current crisis, but in the meantime \u201cMarch of the Volunteers\u201d is being deployed by pro-Beijing protesters, like those who sang it during lunch hour at a Central Hong Kong mall last Thursday, creating a cacophony of dueling anthems.", "description": "I just didn\u2019t realize it.", "authors": ["Vivienne Chow"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/16/opinion/16Chow2/16Chow2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
