Some try to steal passwords, others just attempt to track you or quietly serve you excess ads. And some just try to take you for all you're worth immediately. These are called jackpotting attacks, and they usually target ATMs.\n\nWhy jackpotting? Well because when they infect an ATM, they make it spew out all the money inside like a slot machine jackpot prize. And they're becoming increasingly more common around the world.\n\nAccording to a collaborative investigation by Motherboard and German newsroom Bayerischer Rundfunk, hackers around the world are increasingly realising this is a cheap and easy method to make some quick cash. They're targeting ATMs with outdated software using black market code, and walking away with millions in just a few hits.\n\nIt's another demonstration of the most basic concept of cybersecurity; your system is only as safe as the weakest link. In this case it doesn't matter how high-end the banks' security measures are. If their unguarded ATMs are also running old and unsecured software, hackers will just take the easy route and hit there.\n\nDon't Miss 2.4 K SHARES 2.8 K SHARES 179 SHARES\n\nThe Cutlet Maker interface - Twitter/@cryptoinsane\n\nThere were at least a few of these high-profile jackpotting attacks in Germany back in 2017. Previous reports had claimed that they have decreased in number since, but the new investigation reveals they've actually become more common.\n\n\"Globally, our 2019 survey indicates that jackpotting attacks are increasing,\" David Tente, of the ATM Industry Association, told Motherboard. Other anonymous sources agreed as well. \"There are attacks happening, but a lot of the time it's not publicized,\" said one.\n\nThe attacks in Germany especially, as well as other places in Europe, seem to be largely carried out using a Russian-origin software called Cutlet Maker. The name is a play on the word for cutlet in Russian, which could also mean a bundle of cash. According to Motherboard, a person can buy this software for as little as $1,000, or about Rs 71,000. In the US meanwhile, the software Ploutus.D is more popular for jackpotting.\n\nBoth programs need to be installed on the target ATM through a USB port or other physical access point. While this does require the hackers to gain physical access to the ATM hardware, most times this isn't very hard to do given the nature of how we treat these machines.\n\n\"The bad guys are selling these developments [malware] to just anybody,\" David Sancho, a jackpotting expert cybersecurity firm Trend Micro, told the publication. \"Potentially this can affect any country in the world.\"", "description": "Malware come in different flavours and effects.
