The Gucci Changemakers initiative was announced in March with the aim of supporting \"industry change and to foster unity through community action.\"\n\nThe scholarships for students attending four-year universities will consider ethnic and gender diversity. Gucci said special consideration would be given to students attending black colleges or universities, and living in 12 North American cities: Atlanta, Chicago, Detroit, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New Orleans, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Toronto and Washington, D.C.\n\nAlong with the scholarships of up to $20,000 per student for the 2020-21 academic year, Gucci also announced $1 million in grants to community-based organizations focusing on education; social justice and equity; and art and culture. Grants run from $10,000-$50,000 for one year, with the program slated to run for five years.\n\nTwo scholarships will be awarded to design students in conjunction with the Council of Fashion Designers of America. Another 20 to 50 scholarships will be awarded by the Changemakers council to students aiming for fashion careers but not necessarily design.\n\nApplications for both the scholarship and grant programs opened on Monday. The grant deadline is Nov. 7; scholarship applications close on Dec. 31.\n\n\"With the scholarship program, we aim to create opportunities and visibility for traditionally underrepresented creatives,\" said lawyer and writer Yaseen Eldik, who is co-chair of the Changemakers Council.\n\n\"Our goal is to break down barriers, particularly financial, and make fashion for diverse and inclusive.\"\n\nChangemakers was initially launched as a program to allow employees up to four days to volunteer in community programs. It was expanded earlier this year to include external outreach after the controversy over a black wool balaclava sweater that evoked racist imagery of blackface. Gucci immediately withdrew the garment from sale and said the incident would be \"a powerful learning moment.\"\n\nAmong its responses to date, Gucci hired Ren\u00e9e E. Tirado as a global director for diversity based in New York in July. Tirado previously had a similar role at Major League Baseball.\n\nThe fashion house has also hired three new designers with diverse backgrounds for its Rome design office, and is in the process of hiring two more.\n\nAnd Gucci is working with 10 universities, including four in Africa and three in Asia, on a fellowship program aimed at helping \"underrepresented\" groups get into fashion. Fellows are being selected through design competitions and the winners will be announced later this month.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFor more, please see http://changemakersus.gucci.com", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
