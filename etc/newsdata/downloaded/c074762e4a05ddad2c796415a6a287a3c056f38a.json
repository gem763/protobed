Or worse, a red.\n\nHansen had already seen the All Blacks get issued their first yellow cards of this tournament. Props Nepo Laulala and Ofa Tuungafasi were sin-binned in separate incidents for similar tackles at Tokyo Stadium: Their arms hit the heads of players who were ducking into contact.\n\nWorld Rugby\u2019s updated high tackle framework this year has sought greater protection for players by tasking referees with zero tolerance for contact with the head or neck in matches. The showpiece Rugby World Cup in Japan has magnified the attention on the framework and the pressure on referees to strictly apply it. Of eight instances of suspensions in the tournament, five have been for dangerous high tackles.\n\nHansen repeated on Monday the two yellows against the defending champion All Blacks were fair, but believed a big match was going to be impacted by a card for a high tackle.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say so,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cthere\u2019s no point moaning about it. It\u2019s about accepting it, try and come up with solutions the best you can, and keep your fingers crossed.\u201d\n\nAll Blacks are taught to tackle under the ball, which is easier when a player is upright. But when the ball carrier is bent over, the tackler\u2019s options are limited. Laulala and Tuungafasi paid for it, and Hansen sympathized with them.\n\n\u201cThe game is incredibly difficult under those guidelines when players are falling at your feet,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cThere\u2019s certain things we\u2019re going to have to make sure we do. You can\u2019t have an arm behind your shoulder, because it looks like you\u2019re swinging an arm.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t go into a lot of detail here because it\u2019s something we\u2019re working on, and I\u2019m sure everyone else is, but it\u2019s being able to recognize how quickly they are falling, and how to pull out of a tackle or how to do the tackle differently.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to find a way. The rules aren\u2019t going to change, so we have to accept that, adapt, and adjust quicker than we have.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to tackle under the ball, and yesterday we saw two exceptions. That\u2019s made us put our thinking caps on. Our challenge is to try and mitigate the circumstance of getting yellow cards. You\u2019re not going to get red-carded for that, the mitigating circumstances are they\u2019re falling. But you don\u2019t want yellow cards either.\u201d\n\nHansen said it is hard for players to uphold the framework simply because it\u2019s a contact sport played at speed.\n\n\u201cOur game is about intimidation - some people might not want to hear that, but that\u2019s a fact,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cIt\u2019s about me dominating you, and you do that through intimidating, legally not illegally. If you\u2019ve got a small technique problem in how you present yourself into those tackles, you\u2019re vulnerable. Even if you\u2019ve got great technique, you\u2019re going to be vulnerable.\n\n\u201cOur game is very fluid and, in a second, something you thought you saw can change. Particularly for those big boys. Their agility is not the same as someone like Beauden Barrett, who can change direction on a sixpence. Some of those bigger boys take a wee bit of time. Like the Titanic didn\u2019t move quick enough and sunk.\u201d\n\nHansen said the All Blacks will trial different techniques. Some players will get it quick, and others won\u2019t. But he believed the problem will balance out.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of people getting concussed who are actually making the tackle as opposed to the ball carrier, so we are in a pattern of trying to fix a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cHave we got it 100% right? No. But it is what they\u2019ve asked us to do and as keepers of the game, players and coaches, we\u2019ve got a responsibility to try to respond to that and do the best we can.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "As New Zealand was winding up its Rugby World Cup romp against Namibia on Sunday, coach Steve Hansen was hoping his side didn't have to make any more tackles.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Foster Niumata"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
