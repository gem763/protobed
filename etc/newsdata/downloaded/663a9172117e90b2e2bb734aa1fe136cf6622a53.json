So I brought up Ireland in a very unconventional way. I just wanted her to be free.\n\n\"If she wanted to have her friends over and write over the walls with pen, that was fine. I wanted her childhood to be full of love and light and animals and friends.\"\n\nAlec gave an interview with The Guardian in which he candidly told that the years of divorce proceedings from Kim was like \"staring off a cliff for six years.\"", "description": "Kim cut a sophisticated figure on the red carpet at the Last Chance For Animals' 35th Anniversary Gala", "authors": ["Will Twigger", "Image", "Mediapunch Rex", "Getty Images", "Splashnews"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20661608.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Last-Chance-For-Animals-35th-Anniversary-Gala.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
