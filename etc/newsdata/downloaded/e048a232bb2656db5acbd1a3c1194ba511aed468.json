That's why I made him my buddy,\" she said.\n\n\"I would say things like 'you don't want me, I'm high maintenance and very demanding'. He used to laugh and say 'I don't believe that at all.'\"\n\n(Image: Paul Clarke)\n\nShe added: \"He would say 'Jennifer, you're the Mount Everest every man wants to climb.'\n\nBut the last thing I wanted to be was the girl that showed up, sh***ed him and left.\"\n\nInstead, she said it was \"far more rewarding for me to have a friendship with Boris because he was charismatic and fun and a stimulating person.\"\n\nThe prime minister is now facing conflict of interest allegations and is being investigated by the London Assembly over his links to Arcuri when he was in office.\n\nHer companies were awarded \u00a3126,000 in public money, and she accompanied Johnson on three overseas trade trips.\n\nHowever, both Johnson and Arcuri have repeatedly refuse to confirm or deny if the pair had a sexual relationship.\n\n(Image: Paul Clarke)\n\n(Image: Paul Clarke)\n\nArcuri said: \"I don't want to say there was no affair and I don't want to say there was an affair.\n\n\"I just want people to see there was a unique connection between me and Boris. We definitely got on.\"\n\nShe also repeated her insistence that all grants given to her company were \"totally above board\" and she had \"every right\" to be on the trade delegations as a businesswoman.\n\nArcuri, who said the pair were close from 2011 until 2016, admitted she was aware of the former Mayor of London's womanising reputation, but wasn't \"sitting there, questioning his marriage. I didn't care.\"\n\nHowever, it would appear that Johnson was less relaxed about Arcuri's private life, as she said he would ask her: \"Are you driving men crazy? Are the men filling the streets with weeping tears? I saw a man sobbing earlier - please tell me you didn't break his heart\".\n\n(Image: Paul Clarke)\n\n(Image: Copyright unknown)\n\nShe added: \"He'd ask me who I was dating and I'd say 'everyone'. And he was like 'Oh! Did you give them your virtue?'\"\n\nArcuri also said she she openly told Johnson when he was looking \"pale and fat\", warning him that \"no one likes as chubby leader\" and it was time to eat more vegetables.\n\nShe said she was able to talk to him like that \"because I was his muse\".\n\nMuch focus has been given to Arcuri's former flat in Shoreditch, east London, where Johnson reportedly made repeated visits.\n\nBut Arcuri insisted the dancing pole installed in the flat was only there for \"exercise\", adding: \"I didn't pole dance for Boris and Boris has never pole danced for me.\"", "description": "The American businesswoman says the prime minister called her 'the Mount Everest every man wants to climb' but refuses to confirm affair", "authors": ["Pippa Allen-Kinross", "Image", "Paul Clarke", "Copyright Unknown"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20564590.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Innotech_26Apr_190.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
