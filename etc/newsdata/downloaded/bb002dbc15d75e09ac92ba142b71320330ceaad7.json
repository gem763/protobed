Snooker player Steve Davis put his attractive Essex home on the market for \u00a31.25m last summer\n\nPot black: Steve Davis is a legend in the world of snooker having won six world titles\n\nThat works out at nearly \u00a360,000 per year of price growth - more than twice the national average annual salary - if he manages to secure a buyer for the price it is listed for.\n\nThe attractive four-bedroom property has been on the market since last July, but has so far failed to sell.\n\nIt has been a challenging time in the housing market amid the uncertainty of Brexit and the toll of high moving costs, particular for higher-priced properties that have been hit by stamp duty hikes.\n\nAnyone considering buying the property would have to pay \u00a368,750 in stamp duty. If the buyer already owns another home, then the stamp duty would jump significiantly to \u00a3106,250 due to the three per cent stamp duty surcharge on second homes.\n\nThe snooker champion and BBC commentator will walk away with a \u00a3515,000 profit before tax and any expenses - such as solicitor's and estate agent's fees - if he can offload the property without reducing the existing asking price.\n\nThe exterior of the front of the house is particular pretty at this time of year as it covered in a blanket of purple wisteria\n\nThe most famous match in snooker history? The 1985 World Championship final between Steve Davis and Dennis Taylor\n\nThe Grade II listed property is called Brick House and is on the high street in the popular village of Stock, six miles south of Chelmsford, Essex. It boasts a conservatory, walled garden and plenty of period features.\n\nThe exterior of the front of the house is particular pretty at this time of year as it covered in a blanket of purple wisteria.\n\nPictured from left to right: World champions Steve Davis and Mark Selby, and businessman Fred Done\n\nAttractive purchase: The Essex property is currently vacant, meaning there is no chain for potential buyers\n\nPeriod features: This living area has a brick fireplace and grey panelled walls walls, with a door to the conservatory\n\nThe finer details: There is decorative glass in the windows and doors throughout the house\n\nThe sale of his property is taking far longer than Steve's infamous 1985 Word Championship final.\n\nThe 'black ball' final is widely considered to be the most famous match in snooker history, holding the record for Britain's largest after-midnight television audience with 18.5million viewers.\n\nThe total match time of 14 hours 50 minutes is the longest for a best-of-35 frame game, with his opponent Dennis Taylor winning, 18 frames to 17.\n\nThree years later, Steve won the BBC's Sports Personality of the Year and he remains the only snooker player ever to win the award.\n\nAs well as continuing to play professional snooker, he is a BBC commentator with the final of the World Championships taking place this weekend at the Crucible Theatre, Sheffield.\n\nOutdoor space: The large walled garden mainly consist of a lawn area that is perfect for a family\n\nThere are period features throughout the property, including wooden beams on the walls and ceilings\n\nKeeping warm and cosy: There are several fireplaces in the house, including this brick version\n\nThere is a garden patio area at the rear of the large house and a door to the garage\n\nThe attractive four-bedroom property in Stock Village has been on the market since July last year\n\nEntertaining space: The kitchen leads through to the dining area in the modern conservatory\n\nOriginal features: There are four bedrooms and two bathrooms at the Essex home\n\nA light and bright modern kitchen has been installed with white cabinets and chrome accessories\n\nThe conservatory overlooks the garden and is the perfect space for eating and entertaining\n\nWHAT'S IT LIKE TO LIVE IN STOCK? Stock is one of the most affluent villages in Essex - and homes frequently command seven-figure sums, says a local resident. It is sandwiched in the triangle of town Billericay, village Ingatestone and city Chelmsford. Billericay train station is roughly a 10 minute drive away, and it is half an hour into London Liverpool Street from there. Meanwhile, Chelmsford is roughly a 15 minute drive \u2013 or bus ride away \u2013 and its recently renovated Bond Street area now has a John Lewis department store. The village benefits from three stellar pubs, with the pick of the bunch being The Hoop, which is frequently packed out at the weekend and holds an immensely popular beer festival. It is also home to an award winning florist, a cute caf\u00e9 called Dandelion and a recently renovated bar-stroke-hotel, the Havard. Roughly 2,000 people live in the village, many of whom are city slickers commuting into the capital. It is the ultimate stockbroker place to live, thanks to its name.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Having bought the house almost a decade ago in the summer of 2010 for \u00a3735,000, he stands to make a cool \u2018profit\u2019 of \u00a3515,000 - but only if he finds a buyer willing to pay the current asking price.", "authors": ["Myra Butterworth For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/05/04/09/13079052-0-image-a-5_1556958355922.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-04"}
