They were planning to use DNA analysis to identify the dead, many of whom were charred beyond recognition.\n\nThe fire broke out around 3am on Monday morning and spread so fast that the captain and four other crew members on deck had no chance to pull anyone else to safety and ended up jumping off the vessel as it became engulfed in flames. In a harrowing Mayday call to the coast guard, one of the crew said: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d\n\nThe dispatcher asked of the others below deck: \u201cAre they locked inside the boat?\u201d In the recording released to the public, the answer to this question is inaudible.\n\nThe FBI\u2019s Evidence Response Team has collected evidence both from the charred remains of the diving boat, which was docked a few yards off Santa Cruz Island, 25 miles south of Santa Barbara, and from its intact sister vessel, Vision, which was harbored in Santa Barbara.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is expected to issue preliminary findings on the causes of the fire within 10 days, pending a full report that could take as long as two years.\n\nPreliminary reports suggest that there were no locks preventing the 33 passengers and single crew member trapped below decks from coming up. Rather, the problem was that the two exits required by law both led to a galley area that was consumed by flames and blocked any possible escape.\n\nThe Conception\u2019s operator, Truth Aquatics, has a good reputation and the coast guard has reported that the boat passed all its most recent inspections, which meant it was fitted with fire extinguishers and with a fire suppression system in its engine room.\n\nOne former NTSB officialpointed at inadequate safety rules for boat construction. \u201cIt appears that both exits from the sleeping quarters bring you up inside the vessel,\u201d the former head of the NTSB\u2019s Office of Marine Safety, Marjorie Murtagh Cooke, told the Los Angeles Times.\n\n\u201cWith 30-plus people dying, the investigation could lead to changes in the way vessels are designed or protected.\u201d\n\nThose aboard the Conception were largely families and diving enthusiasts who relished the chance to explore Santa Cruz Island, an uninhabited environmental treasure in the Pacific Ocean. The victims included a father, stepmother and three daughters from Stockton in northern California.\n\nSanta Barbara county sheriff\u2019s lieutenant Brian Olmstead told reporters, that three dozen divers had been out looking for bodies around the clock since the disaster, spending long hours in the cold water and returning \u201cemotionally drained\u201d.\n\n\u201cOur priority,\u201d he said, \u201cis trying to find the last victim.\u201d\n\n\u2022 This article was amended on 4 and 5 September 2019 to clarify that the incident is California\u2019s worst maritime disaster in recent history, and because an earlier version referred to Brian Olmstead as the sheriff of Santa Barbara county, when he is a lieutenant in the sheriff\u2019s office.
