That\u2019s the biggest cash haul since 2010 and eclipses the $38.1 billion they picked up during the 54-week stretch that ended in 2016, according to Refinitiv\u2019s Lipper US Fund Flows data.\n\nSeveral factors are helping to feed the demand, including interest-rate cuts that have pushed up the price of outstanding bonds and sent the market to its biggest gain since 2014. But a major reason is the tax overhaul that capped the federal deduction of state and local taxes, which caused some Americans to use their investments as a way to drive down what they owe.\n\n\u201cMunis have become more of a pure investment. It\u2019s a tax vehicle for many,\u201d said Peter Block, head of municipal bond strategy at Ramirez & Co., who described the appetite for tax shelters as \u201cvoracious.\u201d\n\n\u201cClearly it\u2019s taking off as a tax strategy for the advisory community,\u201d Block said.\n\nWhile the muni market has weakened recently, it\u2019s still delivered returns of about 6.7% this year, and it has fared better than others as prices retreated after August\u2019s big rally. The muni market\u2019s one-month loss of 0.84% compares with the 0.95% loss for Treasuries and the 0.75% loss for corporate bonds, according to Bloomberg Barclays indexes.\n\nMeanwhile, offerings of new municipal bonds this year haven\u2019t kept pace with demand because the tax overhaul did away with a major refinancing tactic and states and cities remain hesitant to run up debt. But for those who do sell, they can lock in borrowing costs near historical lows.\n\n\u201cYou have this limited supply of bonds-- great for you guys to issue debt,\u201d Terry Goode, a senior portfolio manager at Wells Capital Management, told municipal representatives at a Bond Buyer conference in San Francisco on Tuesday. \u201cAnd people like me are clamoring for those particular bonds.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Maria Elena Vizcaino.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Romy Varghese in San Francisco at rvarghese8@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Elizabeth Campbell at ecampbell14@bloomberg.net, Michael B.
