Use it. We are talking about pain.\u201d\n\nPain and Glory marks the eighth collaboration between the legendary Spanish filmmaker and his muse. It centers on Salvador Mallo (Banderas, sporting Almod \u00f3 var\u2019s signature spiky hair), a filmmaker in the twilight of his career whose struggles with chronic pain and creative ennui cause him to re-examine the seminal moments of his life, from his sexual awakening as a boy in 1960s Paterna to his torrid affair with Federico ( Leonardo Sbaraglia) in \u201880s Madrid. Both contend it is their most personal work yet.\n\n\u201cMy sense of Antonio these days is that, because of things that have happened in his life, he has become more sensible and sensitive to certain things,\u201d Almod \u00f3 var says of Banderas\u2019 remarkably tender turn. \u201cSomething deep in him changed for the better.\u201d\n\nBanderas nods, the warm smile vanishing from his face. \u201cWhen you see death very closely, there is something that is different; suddenly, all of these things that you considered very important in your life, they sink, and the important things stay at the surface. Those things were my daughter, my family, my friends, and my vocation\u2014not my profession but my vocation as an actor, and telling stories about the complexity of a human being.\u201d\n\nOn January 25, 2017, Antonio Banderas had a heart attack\u2014or a \u201ccoronary event,\u201d as he so elegantly calls it\u2014and almost died. It is a baffling revelation for anyone who\u2019s had the distinct pleasure of basking in his presence (though 59, the dashing actor doesn\u2019t look a day over 40), and has even confounded his longtime collaborator/pal, who gazes in his direction and proclaims, \u201cHe looks amazing.\u201d\n\nThe night of his surgery, wherein three stents were planted in his heart, an elderly nurse appeared by Banderas\u2019 recovery room door. \u201cI never saw this nurse before or after,\u201d recalls Banderas. \u201cShe says to me, \u2018Do you believe in popular culture?\u2019 and I said, \u2018Yeah. Why?\u2019 And she asks, \u2018Why do you think people say, I love you with all of my heart, and not, I love you with all of my brain, or I love you with all of my kidneys? People say that because the heart is not only an organ that sends oxygen to your body; your heart is a warehouse of feelings, and now you are going to get really sad.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThat happened, right then?!\u201d says a surprised Almod\u00f3var, who\u2019s hearing this story for the first time.\n\n\u201cThe next three months, it was unbelievable\u2014and trust me, I am not a wet, emotional guy\u2014but I was crying at everything,\u201d he continues. \u201cMusic, movies, everything. Fuck! It was like a new universe formed around me.\u201d\n\nAnother operation for arrhythmia followed, and Banderas was put on a series of blood thinners, the side effects of which were very Interview with the Vampire. \u201cWhat happens when you\u2019re on three blood thinners at the same time is you bleed constantly. So, I woke up every morning for a year and a half bleeding\u2014always,\u201d says Banderas. \u201cMy pillows were all filled with blood. You touched me and I got a bruise. If I had an accident, I would have died.\u201d When he played Picasso in Genius, a performance that earned him Emmy and SAG nominations, Banderas had to sign insurance papers freeing the production company from any liability should he bleed out. \u201cI have to take aspirin for the rest of my life. Seventy-five milligrams every morning to keep the blood flowing,\u201d he shares, removing a pill from his pocket and holding it to the light.\n\nThe most beautiful sequence in Pain and Glory\u2014and perhaps in any film this year\u2014sees Banderas\u2019 Salvador reunite with his star-crossed lover, Federico, in his apartment. As Federico freeheartedly recounts their relationship and how it\u2019s colored his life, Banderas gazes at him with a look of warm affirmation, tears welling in his eyes. \u201cThey were seeing each other, which is the most difficult thing, and loved each other no matter what\u2019s transpired in their lives,\u201d explains Almod\u00f3var.\n\nWhen they filmed the master shot, the scene \u201cdidn\u2019t go that far,\u201d remembers Banderas. The following morning, Sbaraglia arrived on set and confessed, \u201cAntonio, I feel a little bit insecure with my lines. Do you mind if we go with you first?\u201d He obliged, and then something strange happened: Sbaraglia extended his hand an inch from Banderas\u2019 heart and began massaging it. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d a confused Banderas asked him. \u201cIt\u2019s going to make you feel better,\u201d asserted Sbaraglia.\n\n\u201cI started the scene, and I couldn\u2019t contain myself. Every word that he said was hitting me like a hammer,\u201d says Banderas. \u201cI thought he was going to cut, and we finished the scene and I said, \u2018Pedro, I\u2019m sorry, give me another chance,\u2019 and he said, \u2018Are you fucking kidding me? We got it! If you want to do it again fine, but we don\u2019t need it.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI was very moved by that sequence,\u201d adds Almod\u00f3var. \u201cThere is fiction and reality, and sometimes reality is just the pretext. But in the case of Federico, it belongs to a period in my life. I know what it means to stop a passionate relationship with someone that, after trying during several years, you have the certainty that you have to stop. And it\u2019s very painful. Everything that is alive, like a passion, is awful to sever. It\u2019s like amputating an arm. And this is the first time that I put it in a movie. The rest around the story, however, is not real, and I did not re-encounter that guy. But fiction helps you lead the lives you wanted to lead that life didn\u2019t allow you to.\u201d\n\nSalvador\u2019s remembrances of things past transport him to his childhood in a small village outside Paterna, where he was raised by his strong-willed mother (Pen\u00e9lope Cruz), and the chiseled laborer who introduced him to the vicious pangs of desire. A looming retrospective also impels him to reconnect with Alberto Crespo (Asier Etxeandia), a volatile actor who starred in several of Mallo\u2019s finest films, and whose heroin addiction doomed their relationship.\n\nFrom an outsider\u2019s perspective, this on-screen reunion bears echoes of Almod\u00f3var and Banderas\u2019 professional estrangement, which lasted 22 years as the actor navigated Hollywood in films like Philadelphia, Desperado, and The Mask of Zorro. But both claim it\u2019s not a send-up of their real-life drama.\n\n\u201cAntonio isn\u2019t the actor I\u2019m talking about there! It\u2019s a mix of actors\u2019 relationships I\u2019ve had in the 21 movies I did,\u201d says Almod \u00f3 var. \u201cBut seriously, Antonio was present when I had a problem with these two or three different actors, so he knows very well\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014where they are buried, and how they were killed!\u201d chimes in Banderas.\n\n\u201c\u2014what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d says a chuckling Almod \u00f3 var.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Frankenstein\u2019s monster of many actors\u2014and a few actresses, too,\u201d adds Banderas, looking at a grinning Almod \u00f3 var. \u201cWe kept talking during the 22 years that we weren\u2019t working, and we remained friends. And with this movie, we were connected more than any other movie we\u2019ve done before. It\u2019s a personal feeling I had where, after a week of working, he was confident, released the reins, and I felt a little bit more free. It was not problematic\u2014like in some other shootings, it was far more complex, the relationship.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cproblematic\u201d shoot Banderas is referring to is The Skin I Live In, the 2011 thriller that saw the duo reunite for the first time since 1990\u2019s Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!\n\n\u201cI went back after 22 years and I threw on the table everything I\u2019d put together in those 22 years in Hollywood,\u201d says Banderas. \u201cI said, \u2018Pedro, this is what I know how to do now, look what I learned, I can do my voice in this way, I can use my body language this way.\u2019 And after a week of rehearsing, he said, \u2018You know, that\u2019s great for your American directors, but I cannot use that for my movies. I need Antonio back.\u2019 So we clashed a little bit on The Skin I Live In.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt \u2026 took time to agree on everything,\u201d Almod\u00f3var confesses. \u201cWe needed time to meet each other again in the field of working\u2014not in our personal life, because we see each other ordinarily as friends, and Antonio never left Spain completely. But it\u2019s true, the first time that we worked together again, we needed to work through it. He calls it a big mistake, but it was a natural adjustment.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are friends\u2014that never was broken\u2014and there were beautiful times shooting [The Skin I Live In],\u201d says Banderas. \u201cBut it made me think, because I saw the movie in Toronto, and all his ideas were correct. I thought, \u2018Oh my god, that\u2019s the character he created that I didn\u2019t even know I had inside.\u2019 That was a big lesson to me: You have to be able to learn from your mistakes.\u201d", "description": "The acclaimed director-actor duo sat down with Marlow Stern in New York to discuss their eighth collaboration, which both admit is their most personal work yet.", "authors": ["Marlow Stern", "Senior Entertainment Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570524389/191007-stern-banderas-tease_rbyi1n", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
