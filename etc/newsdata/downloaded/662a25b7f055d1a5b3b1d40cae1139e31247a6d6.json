(The Logic)\n\nTalking point: One of CETA proponents\u2019 main arguments was that the deal would allow Canadian businesses more access to the EU\u2019s 500 million consumers. Since CETA was signed, the value of Canada\u2019s trade balance with Europe (exports minus imports) has dropped 22 per cent\u2014the equivalent of $323 million per month. The outlier is energy: so far in 2019, Canada is exporting more energy to Europe than it\u2019s importing, the first time that\u2019s happened since at least 2014. Net mineral exports are also up, but food products have taken one of the largest hits. That\u2019s a problem for Canadian farmers, who are also facing pressure from China, which has declined to take some Canadian products amid tensions between the two countries.", "description": "", "authors": ["Zane Schwartz"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
