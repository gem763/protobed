Why should I feel sorry for them?'\n\nHe also related the seven backpacker deaths to the deaths of his mother and sister.\n\n'[Death] happens all the time,' he said.\n\nWhether detectives believe him was 'immaterial' to him, he said.\n\n'I know in my heart, in front of God or whatever, I'm quite ... you know, happy with what when I say this,' Milat said.\n\nInvestigators visited Milat (pictured) a total of eight times to try and get a confession\n\nWhen speaking about the unsolved murders police suspect he committed, Milat said: 'You could blow me eyes with a blowtorch and I still could not tell you one word about any of them missing people.'\n\nMilat, whose memory was described as 'encyclopedic', then continued to claim his innocence.\n\nHe said he was able to recount every detail of his case backwards, and often used this skill to explain and discount the evidence against him found at his family's property in the 1990s.\n\n'He was cold hearted to the end. Even when the videos were shown there was no emotion, no empathy, just nothing,' one officer previously told the Daily Telegraph.\n\nAnother senior police source added: 'Different approaches were made and different people used to try and get him to make admissions.\n\nMilat (pictured), whose memory was described as 'encyclopedic', always claimed innocence\n\n'He talked about some things, but not any confessions.'\n\nThe recordings after 10 Daily revealed Milat handed a sealed letter to his brother Bill just days before he died, to be opened after his death.\n\nIn one final insult to Australians, Milat used the letter to demand the New South Wales government pay for his funeral.\n\nHe also asked for his belongings and legal documents to be handed over to his family, Network Ten reported on Monday.\n\n'Please don't pay for my funeral services or contribute in any way,' the 74-year-old wrote.\n\n'Corrective Services NSW to fund it all - a pauper's burial or whatever is suitable.'\n\nToday it was revealed Milat (pictured) used the letter to insisted the New South Wales government pay for his funeral\n\nBill Milat told Ten on Monday: 'It's the taxpayer that put him in there (prison) so the taxpayer has to pay. Corrective Services had him all this time so Corrective Services can foot the bill.'\n\nIvan Milat signed off the letter with his name and a small illustration of a figure with a halo above the word 'innocent'.\n\nCorrective Services on Monday said its commissioner hadn't received any recent correspondence from Milat.\n\n'Corrective Services NSW will under no circumstances be paying for this funeral,' a spokeswoman said.\n\nThe killer's nephew Alistair Shipsey has also been a vocal supporter of his uncle.\n\n'I'm glad that he is out of pain for something he didn't do, he'd been victimised with lies and with no proof,' Mr Shipsey told The Daily Telegraph.\n\nHis brother Bill Milat (left) and nephew Alistair Shipsey (right) always believed Milat was innocent\n\nFormer detective Clive Small, who led the Milat investigation in the mid-1990s, said he believed Milat (pictured holding a firearm) would confess\n\nOnly one member of the Milat family, Ivan's brother Boris, has criticised the backpacker killer.\n\n'He was dead to me a long time ago,' Boris told Channel Nine's 60 Minutes.\n\n'This man is just an evil serial killer right to the last bone of him.'\n\nFormer detective Clive Small, who led the Milat investigation in the mid-1990s, told The Project why he never believed the man would confess.\n\n'I never thought he would, from the moment he was arrested, confess to anything,' Mr Small said.\n\n'Milat's personality, on my assessment, was such that he thought he was the boss.\n\n'He was in charge of everything he wanted to do or wanted to be in charge of, and the way he kept that position was by keeping information to himself or keeping info he knew other people would be interested in.'\n\nMr Small went on to explain the nation's most notorious serial killer believed that as long as he was withholding information others wanted, despite receiving seven consecutive life sentences for murder in 1996, he was in control.\n\nCaroline Clarke (pictured) was murdered by Ivan Milat along with travelling companion Joanne Walter\n\nTwo of Milat's victims in the 1990s were Anja Habschied (left), 20, and Simone Schmidl (right)\n\nMilat was hospitalised in May and again earlier this month for stomach and throat cancer before being returned to the hospital wing of the jail on Tuesday.\n\nHis death was slow and painful as the cancer spread to his liver, lungs, bones and lymph nodes and he developed fluid on his heart.\n\nMilat's body will be transferred to the New South Wales State Coroner who will decide, after consultation with his family, how it will be disposed.\n\nThere will be an inquest into his death, as is the case with all deaths in custody.\n\nMr Small also said there are at least three unsolved murders with good reasons to suspect Milat.\n\n'We looked at literally hundreds of other unsolved murders and disappearances ... There were three other murders that were unsolved where I think you could strongly point your finger at Ivan.\n\nFormer detective Clive Small, who led the Milat investigation in the mid-1990s, explained why he never believed the man would confess (pictured: Milat smiling after attending court)\n\nPictured is a room in the hospital section of Long Bay prison where Milat died on Sunday\n\n'In one case I've got no doubt about it because the fire arm used in the killing of the backpackers was also used in this particular killing that was unsolved.'\n\nMilat was arrested in May 1994, following two months of surveillance.\n\nPolice were aided by an identification of Milat by British man Paul Onions, who had accepted a ride from him while hitchhiking out of Sydney in 1990 and managed to escape the car, running down the road while Milat shot at him.\n\nHis victims were English backpackers Caroline Clarke, 21, and Joanne Walters 22; Melbourne couple James Gibson and Deborah Everist, both 19; and German backpackers Simone Schmidl, 20, Gabor Neugebauer, 21, and Anja Habschied, 20.\n\nHe stabbed most, decapitated one whose head has never been found and shot another 10 times.\n\nMany were knifed so savagely their bones were chipped, some had been gagged or bound, and some were suspected of having been sexually assaulted.", "description": "Milat, 74, was found guilty of killing seven people in the Balenglo State Forest in Sydney's south in the 1990s and is suspected of killing dozens of others, but never confessed to any crimes.", "authors": ["Charlotte Karp For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/09/20272264-0-image-a-7_1572255084576.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
