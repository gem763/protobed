The rights group said at least 14 had been killed and more than 100 people were injured.\n\nIt urged the Iraqi authorities to \u201cimmediately rein in\u201d its security forces saying they had used \u201cexcessive and lethal force\u201d.\n\nThe city\u2019s police chief and governor denied the killings took place in public statements.\n\nBut security officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, confirmed that 18 were killed.\n\nIf true the Karbala attack would mark one of the single deadliest attacks since anti-government protests erupted earlier this month.\n\nIn total at least 250 people have now been killed as the leaderless and largely spontaneous, rallies have been met with bullets and teargas.\n\nA local journalist in Karbala told The Independent that protesters defied a curfew imposed by the local governor on Monday night and tried to enter a local government building.\n\nLater, men wearing plain black uniforms attacked, firing teargas and live ammunition at the protesters by the government building before moving to Education Square and firing on the crowds there.\n\n\u201cThey arrested scores of youth, activists and journalists, and then used live ammunition against them ...
