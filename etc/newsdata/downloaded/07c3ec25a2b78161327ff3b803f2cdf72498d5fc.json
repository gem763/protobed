This included talking to friends, ladies-in-waiting and relatives. But, according to The Guardian, she didn\u2019t stop there.\n\nNetflix Helena Bonham Carter as Princess Margaret in Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Crown.\u201d\n\nIn order for Bonham Carter to be as accurate as possible, she also consulted a graphologist, an astrologer (Margaret was a Leo, in case you were wondering) and a psychic.\n\nThe latter allowed Bonham Carter to talk to Princess Margaret herself, and it sounds like the two had a very interesting exchange.\n\nPrincess Margaret, for instance, seemed mostly satisfied that Bonham Carter would be portraying her.\n\n\u201cShe said, apparently, she was glad it was me,\u201d Bonham Carter said. \u201cMy main thing when you play someone who is real, you kind of want their blessing because you have a responsibility.\u201d\n\nBut the late Margaret\u2019s approval wasn\u2019t completely wholehearted.\n\nDALMAS via Getty Images Princess Margaret and her husband, the Earl of Snowdon, in the Bahamas in 1967.\n\n\u201cSo I asked her, \u2018Are you OK with me playing you?,\u2019 and she said: \u2018You\u2019re better than the other actress\u2019 \u2026 that they were thinking of. They will not admit who it was. It was me and somebody else.\u201d\n\nIt sounds like Margaret was referring to the other actor who was considered to play an older version of herself (rather than Vanessa Kirby, who played a younger Princess Margaret in the first two seasons of \u201cThe Crown\u201d), whose identity she presumably gleaned from her perch in the afterlife. The late princess\u2019s slight also felt authentic to Bonham Carter.\n\n\u201cThat made me think maybe she is here,\u201d Bonham Carter said. \u201cBecause that is a classic Margaret thing to say. She was really good at complimenting you and putting you down at the same time.\u201d\n\nThrough the psychic, Princess Margaret also offered Bonham some advice \u2014 and another jab \u2014 as well.\n\n\u201cThen she said: \u2018But you\u2019re going to have to brush up and be more groomed and neater.\u2019 Then she said: \u2018Get the smoking right. I smoked in a very particular way. Remember that \u2014 this is a big note \u2014 the cigarette holder was as much a weapon for expression as it was for smoking.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnwar Hussein via Getty Images Princess Margaret smokes a cigarette at the Windsor Horse Show in April 1978.\n\nSpeaking to Princess Margaret beyond the grave was not the only connection Bonham Carter has to the famous royal.\n\nShe also said at the festival that her uncle, Mark Bonham-Carter, once dated Princess Margaret, The Sun reported.\n\n\u201cUncle Mark escaped as a prisoner in Italy in the Second World War,\u201d she said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t send him away again, they put him at Windsor and he guarded Princess Margaret an\u00add Elizabeth. I have photos of [Mark and Margaret] together. They looked dashing and remained good friends.\u201d\n\nBonham Carter then jokingly remarked on her role, \u201cIt\u2019s weird, I basically went out with my uncle.\u201d", "description": "As part of her research for the role, the actor communicated with the late royal through a psychic and had an enlightening conversation.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9b8a66210000b103ab946b.jpeg?cache=imsvlogvpq&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
