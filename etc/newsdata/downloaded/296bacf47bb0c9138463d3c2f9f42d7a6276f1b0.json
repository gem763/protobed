The bill must still be approved by parliament.", "description": "New measures will also include tougher rules on gun ownership and increasing funding for deradicalization programs.", "authors": ["Janosch Delcker"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1172482634-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
