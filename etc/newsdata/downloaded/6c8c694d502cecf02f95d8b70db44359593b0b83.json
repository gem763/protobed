When you see something happen in sport that you didn't think was possible, it's just a really historic and special moment for our sport.\"\n\nWorld No 2 Rory McIlroy who tied third, a distant six strokes behind Woods, said he'd quickly done the maths and said he would have to win \"six times a year for the next 10 years\" to get close to Woods.\n\nUS Open champion Gary Woodland had a front-row seat as Woods' playing partner for the last two rounds and said it had been a privilege to watch.\n\n\"I think it's a lot harder to win week-in and week-out out here, \" he said.\n\n\"Obviously the majors speak for themselves, but 82's just a crazy number. You look at the guys that have won 10 times and it's pretty special.\n\n\"To battle through the injuries he's dealt with, gosh, he's young and he's playing unbelievable. I think there's a lot more in store.\"\n\nThe last word belonged to Monahan, who said it was fitting that he should tie Hall-of-Famer Snead in an overseas event.\n\n\"To be our inaugural event and to have Tiger win it, when you think of Tiger, you think of his global reach and his global relevancy,\" said Monahan as Woods notched up a PGA Tour win in a record seventh different country.\n\n\"To me it's only fitting that he would tie the record overseas.\"\n\nIncredibly happy for @TigerWoods--and for game of golf--on his 82nd @PGATOUR win. For a number of years, all we wanted was to see Tiger healthy again, but for his quality of life. But it's very obvious that the surgery and the hard work Tiger put in resulted in quality of golf! \u2014 Jack Nicklaus (@jacknicklaus) October 28, 2019\n\n_@TigerWoods validated his hard work at the TOUR Championship 13 months ago; boldly underlined it at @TheMasters; and puncuated it with today's record-tying victory. The 82 wins serve as a reflection of consistency over 24 years, and strength of mind as much as strength of game.. \u2014 Jack Nicklaus (@jacknicklaus) October 28, 2019", "description": "Jack Nicklaus led the tributes to Tiger Woods after the golfing great secured a record 82nd PGA Tour win at the weather-disrupted Zozo Championship.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7981/b0afb240e28a43fc80bc0f8cdbbb0dc2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
