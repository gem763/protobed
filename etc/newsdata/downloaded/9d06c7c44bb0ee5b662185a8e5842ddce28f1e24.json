As part of the review, Barr met recently with officials in Italy, where in 2016 a Trump campaign adviser met Joseph Mifsud, a professor whose actions figured prominently into the FBI\u2019s rationale for opening the Russia inquiry.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and some of his allies have asserted without evidence that a cabal of U.S. officials \u2014 the so-called deep state \u2014 embarked on a broad operation to thwart Trump\u2019s campaign. The conspiracy theory remains unsubstantiated, and the Justice Department has not explained why Barr feels the allegations merit a review, though he would need to run down all leads if he was to conduct a thorough audit.\n\nWho is Joseph Mifsud?\n\nMifsud was a professor at the London Academy of Diplomacy who also spent time as a political science faculty member at Link Campus University, a school in Rome.\n\nSome of the president\u2019s allies have pushed an unfounded theory that the Maltese-born Mifsud is a Western intelligence agent possibly under the control of the FBI or CIA whom deep state officials dispatched as a counterintelligence trap for the Trump campaign.\n\nMifsud told a Trump campaign adviser, George Papadopoulos, in the spring of 2016 that the Russians had \u201cthousands\u201d of stolen Democratic emails that could prove damaging to Trump\u2019s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, if they became public.\n\nJames Comey, the former FBI director, has called Mifsud a Russian agent. Mifsud maintained contacts with Russians associates, including a former employee of the Internet Research Agency, which used social media posts to sow discord in 2016 as part of Russia\u2019s election sabotage.\n\nMifsud told an Italian newspaper in 2017 that he was not a secret agent. \u201cI never got any money from the Russians,\u201d he said. \u201cMy conscience is clear.\u201d\n\nWhat did he tell the Trump campaign?\n\nMifsud and Papadopoulos first met in March 2016 in Italy. The next month, after Mifsud had traveled to Moscow, they met again in London, where Mifsud revealed that the Russians possessed information that could damage Clinton.\n\nMifsud suggested that the Russian government could assist the Trump campaign through the \u201canonymous release of information that would be damaging to Hillary Clinton,\u201d according to the report by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, who took over the Russia investigation in May 2017.\n\nHow did the FBI learn about his offer?\n\nPapadopoulos bragged in May 2016 to a pair of Australian diplomats about Mifsud\u2019s offer of Russian dirt about Clinton\u2019s hacked emails. The Australian government passed the information to the United States, but only months later \u2014 after WikiLeaks published the stolen Democratic emails.\n\nThe Australians\u2019 account, including the revelation that a member of the Trump campaign may have had inside information about the email hacking, was a driving factor in the FBI\u2019s counterintelligence investigation in July 2016 into Russia\u2019s attempts to disrupt the election and whether any Trump associates conspired.\n\nWhat happened to Papadopoulos?\n\nThe FBI began investigating him, along with three other Trump associates, as part of the counterintelligence inquiry. When agents questioned Papadopoulos about his interactions with Mifsud, he repeatedly lied, according to court records, hindering investigators\u2019 attempts to potentially detain Mifsud.\n\nHe had been in the United States and agents interviewed him once, but Mifsud left the country. He has since disappeared from public view.\n\nPapadopoulos was eventually convicted of lying to federal investigators and served 12 days in prison.\n\nSince leaving prison, Papadopoulos has promoted unfounded assertions and outright conspiracy theories about the Russia investigation. He wrote a book, \u201cDeep State Target,\u201d accusing the Obama administration of mounting a coordinated effort to spy on the Trump campaign and keep Trump from being elected and asserting that he was a pawn in that operation.\n\nHow does Mifsud fit into that theory?\n\nPapadopoulos has posited that Mifsud was \u201can Italian intelligence asset who the CIA weaponized\u201d as part of the unsubstantiated \u201cdeep state\u201d plot. The president\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani has claimed, also without evidence, that Mifsud was a \u201ccounterintelligence operative, either Maltese or Italian.\u201d", "description": "WASHINGTON -- Attorney General William Barr has said he is reviewing the origins of the Russia investigation.
