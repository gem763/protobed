Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), a former Marine Corps reservist who served in Iraq, made the comments on Tuesday after Zuckerberg\u2019s address at Georgetown University last week. During the event, Zuckerberg cited the Iraq War as at least partially responsible for his decision to create Facebook and defended the company as a bastion of free speech.\n\n\u201cI remember feeling that if more people had a voice to share their experiences, maybe things would have gone differently,\u201d the Facebook co-founder said Thursday. \u201cThose early years shaped my belief that giving everyone a voice empowers the powerless and pushes society to be better over time.\u201d\n\nBut those remarks puzzled Gallego and others who were at Harvard during the social media network\u2019s early years, after it was spawned from a website created to rank college students based on attractiveness. They said the earliest versions of Facebook didn\u2019t even allow users to communicate with each other or debate political issues.\n\n\u201cI was the only reservist on the campus and was keenly aware of the Iraq Debate on campus,\u201d Gallego, who said he had one of the \u201cfirst\u201d Facebook accounts, wrote Tuesday. \u201cThis is no where near the truth, it was designed to be [an] easier cleaner MySpace based off our House books.\u201d\n\nI was at Harvard with Mark and have one of the first facebook accounts. I was the only reservist on the campus and was keenly aware of the Iraq Debate on campus. This is no where near the truth, it was designed to be and easier cleaner MySpace based off our House books. https://t.co/AzsuzWUh7X \u2014 Ruben Gallego (@RubenGallego) October 22, 2019\n\nThe lawmaker clarified his remarks in an interview with The Washington Post, accusing Zuckerberg of trying to recast Facebook\u2019s image as it draws fire over a recent decision to allow political ads filled with lies to proliferate on the platform. Facebook has been widely lambasted after it allowed a Donald Trump campaign ad to spread on the network even though it featured falsehoods about Democratic presidential rival Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s rewriting history so it gives him an excuse to regulate himself,\u201d Gallego told the Post about Zuckerberg\u2019s Iraq War origin story. \u201cIt\u2019s false. It\u2019s completely false.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s Georgetown speech was one of his more ardent defenses of the social media network in recent months, which has also faced a bevy of criticism over its data practices. Facebook was fined a record $5 billion by the Federal Trade Commission in July over privacy violations related to the Cambridge Analytica scandal (although many critics referred to that figure as merely a slap on the wrist).\n\nIn a separate interview with the Post, Zuckerberg said he was \u201cdeeply\u201d worried about an \u201cerosion of truth\u201d in society but said the responsibility should not lie with Facebook to police such discourse.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think people want to live in a world where you can only say things that tech companies decide are 100 percent true,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think that those tensions are something we have to live with.\u201d\n\nThose statements are unlikely to curtail scrutiny of the social media network. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), also a presidential candidate, has been prodding Facebook with her own spate of false political ads targeting Zuckerberg himself. Fellow tech tycoons have hypothesized about the company being broken up, and 46 state attorneys general are investigating Facebook\u2019s business practices.\n\nMark Zuckerberg's speech today shows how little he learned from 2016, and how unprepared Facebook is to handle the 2020 election. https://t.co/2JHCuihexR \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 18, 2019\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nElizabeth Warren Takes Facebook's Ad Policy, Fires It Back At Zuckerberg And Trump\n\nMark Zuckerberg Cites The Iraq War In Defense Of Allowing Lies On Facebook\n\nMark Zuckerberg Says He Gave Pete Buttigieg's Campaign Unsolicited Hiring Advice\n\nLove HuffPost?
