(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Latest on President Donald Trump and the Democrats' impeachment inquiry (all times local):\n\n6:25 p.m.\n\nA House committee has sent a subpoena to the White House demanding documents that could provide details on President Donald Trump's effort to push Ukraine to produce information that could damage Joe Biden's presidential run.\n\nThe subpoena was issued by the House Oversight and Reform Committee as part of Democrats' impeachment investigation of Trump.\n\nTrump has resisted Democratic attempts to produce documents and administration witnesses for the impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe subpoena seems likely to escalate the clash between the two branches of government.\n\nPanel Chairman Rep. Elijah Cummings had threatened the subpoena Wednesday, after the White House ignored two letters in September seeking the documents.\n\nTrump was withholding military aid to Ukraine when he used a July phone call to ask its president to investigate Biden for corruption, an unfounded allegation\n\n__\n\n3:45 p.m.\n\nHouse investigators want Vice President Mike Pence to give them documents that could shed light on whether he helped President Donald Trump pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden.\n\nIn a letter to Pence on Friday, the Democratic chairmen of three House committees cite reports that a Pence aide may have listened to the July phone call in which Trump pushed Ukraine's president to investigate unfounded charges that Biden was involved in corrupt activities there.\n\nThey say they also want to learn more about Pence's Sept. 1 meeting with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\n\nThe letter says there are \"questions about any role you may have played in conveying or reinforcing the President's stark message to the Ukrainian President.\"\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\n___\n\n11:35 a.m.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is insisting that his call for China to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden will have no bearing on upcoming high-stakes trade talks with the nation.\n\nTrump is telling reporters at the White House Friday that, \"one thing has absolutely nothing to do with the other.\"\n\nNegotiations between the U.S. and China are set to resume next week as a protracted trade war continues.\n\nTrump on Thursday publicly encouraged China to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter, snubbing his nose at an impeachment inquiry into whether a similar, private appeal to Ukraine violated his oath of office.\n\nTrump says he believes China wants to make a deal.\n\n___\n\n11:20 a.m.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is denying there was quid pro quo as he sought for the Ukrainian government to investigate Joe Biden, and says he didn't do it for political purposes.\n\nTrump says: \"We are looking at corruption, we're not looking at politics.\"\n\nHe adds: \"I believe there was tremendous corruption with Biden.\"\n\nTrump has asked Ukraine and China to launch probes into the former vice president and 2020 Democratic hopeful, alleging without evidence that there was misconduct by Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nHe claims his call for the investigations wasn't political, because \"I never thought Biden was going to win\" the primary.\n\nTrump says of rooting out corruption: \"I actually feel I have an obligation to do that.\"\n\n___\n\n11:10 a.m.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is acknowledging that Democrats in the House have the votes to begin a formal impeachment inquiry into his conduct.\n\nTrump is telling reporters at the White House that while, \"Republicans have been very unified,\" the \"Democrats, unfortunately, they have the votes.\"\n\nBut he's insisting the move will backfire on the party, saying: \"I really believe that they're going to pay a tremendous price at the polls.\"\n\nTrump said Friday the White House would be sending a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to formally object to the inquiry. It's expected to say officials won't cooperate with the probe because it was initiated without a vote of the House.\n\nPelosi last week announced that the House was beginning the formal inquiry but didn't seek the consent of the full chamber.\n\n___\n\n11:05 a.m.\n\nWhite House economic adviser Larry Kudlow says he \"seriously\" doubts China's response to President Donald Trump's call for the rival nation to investigate a Democratic political rival will play a role in upcoming high-stakes trade negotiations between the nations.", "description": "A House committee has sent a subpoena to the White House demanding documents that could provide details on President Donald Trump's effort to push Ukraine to produce information that could damage Joe Biden's presidential run.
