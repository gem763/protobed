All the experts surveyed by Bankrate disagree, saying Americans should be better off.\n\n\u201cOne could make the argument that you should\u2019ve had more substantial improvement when [Trump] likes to point to things like...the Dow Industrials Average, as if that is a benchmark of the financial standing of all Americans,\u201d Bankrate Senior Economic Analyst Mark Hamrick said on Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cThe First Trade.\u201d\n\nDALLAS, TEXAS - OCTOBER 17: U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a \"Keep America Great\" Campaign Rally at American Airlines Center on October 17, 2019 in Dallas, Texas.

Of households earning $75,000 or more a year, 84% say their finances have improved or stayed the same. That\u2019s true for only 66% of households earning under $30,000 per year.\n\n\u201cWe continue to have a significant divide in the country\u201d when it comes to the economic standing of low-income Americans. \u201cA significant number of Americans are still living paycheck-to-paycheck,\u201d Hamrick said. Indeed, despite record-low unemployment rates, wage growth has largely been flat: over last year, average hourly earnings rose just 2.9%, marking the slowest pace of increases since July 2018.\n\nKey issues for Americans in 2020 election\n\nLooking ahead to next year\u2019s presidential election, health care, employment, and taxes lead the list of financial concerns. Experts agree on health care and employment, but foreign trade ranks No. 3 on their list of financial concerns.\n\n\u201cIn terms of health care,\u201d Hamrick said, \u201cwe know that it\u2019s not just access to health care, it\u2019s the cost of health care, even for healthy people.\u201d\n\nThe average health insurance premium for family coverage has increased 22% over the last five years and 54% over the last 10 years, significantly more than either workers\u2019 wages or inflation, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nBreaking down the results demographically, housing affordability made its way into the top 3 concerns for key groups including Democrats, women, and millennials.\n\nSource: Bankrate More\n\n\u201cMillennials put employment as a priority over health care,\u201d Hamrick said, because they \u201cdon\u2019t have to tap the health care system as often.\u201d\n\nHousing affordability is also higher ranking among younger Americans, and Hamrick said the \u201ccomplicated issues\u201d of income inequality, housing affordability, and unemployment create an opportunity for Democrats going into 2020.\n\nFollow Katie on Twitter: @hashtagkatie.\n\nRead More:\n\nRead the latest stocks and stock market news from Yahoo Finance\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and reddit.", "description": "Most Americans say their finances haven't improved since President Trump took office, according to a survey from Bankrate, but experts say Americans should be better off.", "authors": ["Katie Krzaczek", "Associate Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0.17BNOV_ZkRvvqez3TWQg--~B/aD00MDk2O3c9NjE0NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/bd6b5150-f595-11e9-97ff-22cc24d11d9b", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
