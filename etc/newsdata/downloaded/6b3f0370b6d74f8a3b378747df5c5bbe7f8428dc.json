Her response that the judgment of the court creates a bad precedent is contemptuous of the court and does her no credit.\"\n\nThe Constitutional Court majority judgment upheld a February 2018 Gauteng High Court ruling that Mkhwebane pay 15% of the SA Reserve Bank's legal fees in the Absa/Bankorp review case.\n\nHer remedial action that Absa should pay back R1.2bn for an apartheid era bailout to its subsidiary and the central bank's mandate should be widened were set aside.\n\nThe apex court found she had acted in bad faith and put forward a \"number of falsehoods\" during the litigation.\n\nIn August, the Hawks confirmed they were investigating Mkhwebane after a complaint was laid by Accountability Now, which laid criminal charges of perjury and defeating the ends of justice against her.\n\nIt also lodged a maladministration complaint against her with the very office she heads.", "description": "An application from anti-corruption pressure group Accountability Now seeking to have Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane declared unfit for office will only be heard next year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9504/2b721a262b7b46d6ad8b5023873a0fbe.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
