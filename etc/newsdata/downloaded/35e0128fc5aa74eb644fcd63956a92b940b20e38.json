Pictured: HMV flagship store in Oxford Street, London\n\nIt will stock more than 100,000 LPs and CDs, and boasts a large stage in the middle.\n\nMr Putman said introducing more live music and 'local bands particularly' to stores is a core part of the strategy to bring more people to HMV's high street sites.\n\nWhich HMV stores closed? Ayr Bath Bluewater, Kent Bristol, Cribbs Causeway Chichester Exeter, Princesshay Fopp, Bristol Fopp, Glasgow Byres Fopp, Manchester Fopp, Oxford Glasgow, Braehead Guernsey Hereford Trafford, Manchester Merry Hill, Dudley Oxford Street, central London Queensgate, Peterborough Plymouth, Drake Circus Reading Meadowhall, Sheffield Southport Thurrock Tunbridge Wells Uxbridge Watford Westfield Shepherds Bush Wimbledon\n\nHe said his new strategy for the company will see the 'first 20ft of stores transformed' to feel less corporate, more focused and cleaner than before.\n\nThe transformation of stores comes after the new owner, who runs Canadian record store business Sunrise, closed 15 stores after taking control earlier this year.\n\nHMV was purchased in a rescue deal by the music mogul in February after it crashed into administration for the second time in five years in December 2018 when previous owner Hilco failed to make the business sufficiently profitable.\n\nIt saw 27 stores closed and resulted in 455 redundancies.\n\nThe rescue bid saw 100 stores escape closure, which saved 1,487 jobs.\n\nMr Putman said he faced a 'long list of issues' ranging from trying to secure new leases with landlords and improving the relationship with suppliers after he took control.\n\nHe added that 'unsustainable' business rates are a particular burden on the business and called for a reduction to help high street retailers.\n\n'You have to hope someone wakes up sooner rather than later over rates. We want to open more stores, but we need help when it comes to rates to make that possible,' Mr Putman said.\n\n'It would be a scary thing if the high street wasn't here. As someone from Canada I'd stress how much it should be treasured.'\n\nAway from the high street, HMV has faced huge pressure from Amazon and other online retailers.\n\nThe company is currently running a limited service online but will launch all of its stock on its site by November 1, it said.\n\nMr Putman added: 'We're excited to have online back and running and it will be fully functional ready for Christmas.\n\n'This is where a huge amount of the market is and we realise that.'", "description": "Canadian businessman Doug Putman bought HMV in February and has promised more stores, including ones in London and Birmingham.", "authors": ["Lara Keay For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/15/19543736-0-image-a-67_1570717748948.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
