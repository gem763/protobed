The red and white Scania Super truck had a sticker on the windscreen reading \u201cThe Ultimate Dream\u201d.\n\nPolice believe the trailer travelled from Zeebrugge in Belgium into Purfleet in England, and then docked in the Thurrock area after 12:30am on Wednesday morning, while the tractor unit originated from Northern Ireland.\n\nPolice have not yet revealed the identities or genders of the 39 victims, but they are believed to be 38 adults and one teenager.\n\nExclusive: Video shows lorry in which 39 bodies were later found in Essex, moments before turning into industrial park https://t.co/kubNQBQoJY pic.twitter.com/6werJqWisi \u2014 ITV News (@itvnews) October 23, 2019\n\nmedia_camera British Police officers in forensic suits begin work on what is set to be a lengthy investigation.

Picture: Ben STANSALL / AFP.\n\nCOMPLEX INVESTIGATION\n\nRoad Haulage Association chief executive Richard Burnett told the Irish Mirror the style of container appeared to be a refrigerated unit which would have been \u201cabsolutely horrendous\u201d for anyone trapped inside.\n\nTemperatures can reach as low as -25 degrees for frozen products, causing humans to \u201close their lives pretty quickly,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be dark. If the fridge is running it\u2019s going to be incredibly cold.\n\n\u201cThe only place to go to the toilet is on board the back of the trailer. You can imagine if they\u2019ve been in there for days then there will be faeces, there will be urine,\u201d he said.\n\nmedia_camera The lorry container where 39 bodies were found in Essex.

Picture: Sky News\n\n\u2018ABSOLUTE TRAGEDY\u2019\n\nDeputy chief constable Pippa Mills from Essex Police said it was \u201can absolute tragedy and a very sad day\u201d for officers and the community.\n\n\u201cWe believe the lorry is from Bulgaria and came in to the UK through Holyhead on the 19th of October,\u201d she told reporters at a press conference.\n\n\u201cAt this stage we have not identified where the victims are from or their identities, and we anticipate that this could be a lengthy process.\u201d\n\nThe East England Ambulance Service (EEAST) said it was first alerted to the scene after receiving a phone call in the early hours of the morning, but could not confirm who made the phone call.\n\nEarlier, chief superintendent Andrew Mariner said: \u201cThis is a tragic incident where a large number of people have lost their lives. Our inquiries are ongoing to establish what has happened\u201d.\n\nmedia_camera Chief Superintendent Andrew Mariner said the lorry arrived in the UK on Saturday.

I am receiving regular updates from the Home Office and will work closely with Essex Police as we establish exactly what has happened,\u201d he tweeted.\n\n\u201cMy thoughts are with all those who lost their lives and their loved ones.\u201d\n\nmedia_camera Authorities said they believed the lorry originated in Bulgaria.

Essex Police has arrested an individual and we must give them the space to conduct their investigations. \u2014 Priti Patel MP (@patel4witham) October 23, 2019\n\nBut Thurrock MP Jackie Doyle-Price was quick to blame people smugglers for the deaths.\n\n\u201cPeople trafficking is a vile and dangerous business \u2026 let\u2019s hope they bring these murderers to justice,\u201d she tweeted.\n\nAmnesty International UK\u2019s refugee and migrant rights director, Steve Valdez-Symonds, also weighed in.\n\n\u201cThis is a heartbreaking and horrifying incident. People who are forced to take dangerous and sometimes fatal passages to reach the UK often do so because current immigration policies and practices deny them safe and legal options,\u201d he said.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn said it was an \u201cunbelievable human tragedy\u201d.\n\n\u201cCan we just think for a moment of what it must have been like for those 39 people, obviously in a desperate and dangerous situation, for their lives to end, suffocated to death in a container?\u201d he said.\n\nLabour MP Diane Abbott said: \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that these 39 poor, unfortunate people are the victims in this.\n\n\u201cThey are preyed on by the greedy, unscrupulous and people who simply have a wilful disregard for the lives of others.\u201d\n\nmedia_camera Essex Police said the people were all pronounced dead at the scene.

Picture: Ben Stansall/AFP\n\nThe UK\u2019s Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants called for government action, saying the nation needed \u201cmore than empty expressions of shock and sadness from Priti Patel and Boris Johnson\u201d.\n\n\u201cNobody should be in any doubt that the ultimate responsibility for these deaths lies with government policy which has deliberately closed down safe and legal routes into Britain,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\n\u201cPeople move, they always have and they always will. Nobody should have to risk their lives to do so.\u201d\n\nBULGARIA INVESTIGATING ORIGIN OF TRUCK\n\nBulgaria\u2019s foreign ministry said it could not confirm at this stage whether the truck had started its journey from the country.\n\n\u201cWe are still checking the information, published in the British media and we\u2019re contacting the authorities,\u201d foreign ministry spokeswoman Tsvetana Krasteva said.\n\nDan Peters, from a hydraulic maintenance company on the industrial estate where the bodies were found, said it was \u201cterrible\u201d news. He said the industrial estate was made up of courier and logistics companies.\n\nmedia_camera A Police forensic investigation team is parked near the site where the bodies were discovered.

They then found 34 Afghan Sikhs alive inside suffering from severe dehydration, hypothermia and lack of air.\n\nOne man was found dead, having passed away during the sea crossing from Belgium.\n\n-With wires\n\nOriginally published as 39 people found dead in truck container", "description": "British police have launched a murder investigation after 39 bodies were found dead in a truck container.
