His grandfather played left in the final game of his career - Oct. 2, 1983 - a position where he won seven Gold Gloves, playing in front of the fabled Green Monster.\n\n\u201cFor life,\u201d he told the media, sitting in the dugout about 4 \u00bd hours before the game when asked when he thought about playing his first game in Fenway. \u201cIt\u2019s always a dream to play here when you\u2019re a kid growing up in New England.\u201d\n\nBefore he talked to the media, the younger and older Yaz chatted together as they walked Fenway\u2019s outfield.\n\n\u201cIt was awesome,\u201d Mike said. \u201cWe got a chance to catch up. I normally don\u2019t get a chance to see him during the season, so that\u2019s a bonus.\u201d\n\nGiants manager Bruce Bochy decided it was fitting for him to play left.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s played left a lot. To be honest, I wanted to have him play left field tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a cool moment for a lot of people here. It\u2019s going to be a great reminder of a lot of things his grandfather did and bring some special memories to peoples\u2019 mind.\u201d\n\nHe got a nice ovation when he batted leadoff to open the game.\n\nCarl, who turned 80 in August, played his entire 23-year career with the Red Sox, retiring in 1983 with 3,419 hits, including 452 homers and over 1,800 RBIs. In 1967, he won the AL MVP after capturing the Triple Crown.\n\nHe was inducted into the Hall in 1989 and the Red Sox dedicated a statue of him outside the right-field entrance in 2013.\n\nGrowing up about 30 miles north of Fenway, Mike didn\u2019t realize the impact his grandfather had on Red Sox fans and the type of legend he was until high school.\n\n\u201cI was probably in the middle of high school; 15, 16 when I started to understand what he had done was so special and the career he had,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I turned 23, that was kind of the big shocking moment that for my entire life he had showed up to Fenway Park every day. That kind of blew my mind.\u201d\n\nSo, what did the newest Yaz learn from his grandfather about playing left?\n\n\u201cHis advice is: Take balls in BP because no fungo is going to simulate the ball that\u2019s going to be hit live if it\u2019s hit off that wall,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd what other advice did he get?\n\n\u201cTo not be anybody different than the guy that got me here,\u201d he said.\n\nMike played in Baltimore\u2019s organization for six years before he was traded to San Francisco in March. He entered the night hitting .265 with 19 homers and 51 RBIs.\n\nHe knows he\u2019ll have plenty of memories from his first game in Fenway.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the best,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody dreams about going home and playing in their hometown. To be here and make this trip is special.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "For the first time in more than three decades, there was a \"Yaz\" patrolling left field in a big-league game at Fenway Park.
