REUTERS/Aly Song\n\nPRAGUE (Reuters) - The Czech Republic is likely to follow the approach of Germany and other neighboring countries in addressing issues related to Huawei while building 5G networks, the industry minister was quoted as saying on Thursday.\n\nThe Czech cyber security watchdog NUKIB warned last December of potential risks from using Huawei technology, which raised questions over the role it can play in building next-generation 5G mobile networks after a frequencies tender next year. But that has not led to an outright ban of the Chinese company.\n\nIt comes as the United States has led a campaign to convince allies to ban the firm from future networks. Huawei denies U.S. allegations it is able to spy on customers.\n\nGermany this month finalised rules for the build-out of 5G networks that will not exclude Huawei.\n\nCzech Industry Minister Karel Havlicek told newspaper Pravo on Thursday that the state was following how the issue was playing out in Europe.\n\n\u201cThe technology which is the foundation of building 5G networks has a global character and I cannot imagine that we would have different parameters set for the approach to Huawei or any other company in the Czech Republic than in Germany or Poland,\u201d Havlicek said.\n\nThe telecoms regulator CTU is due to launch an auction of 5G frequencies early next year and has said the Huawei issue is not a threat to that plan.\n\nThe NUKIB warning from last December was still valid, Pravo also quoted the office\u2019s head, Radek Holy, as saying on Thursday. Holy said a report on the state of cyber security in the country would be ready at the earliest by the end of the first quarter next year.", "description": "The Czech Republic is likely to follow the approach of Germany and other neighboring countries in addressing issues related to Huawei while building 5G networks, the industry minister was quoted as saying on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444417176&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N0IT-OCATC", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
