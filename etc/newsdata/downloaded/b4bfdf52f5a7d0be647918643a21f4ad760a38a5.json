Only he didn\u2019t remember a thing.\n\n\u2018Everything else was on its side, or upside down, or in pieces. Sitting among the splinters was a cowboy hat that [personal assistant] Bob liked to wear. It was completely flat, like Yosemite Sam\u2019s after Bugs Bunny drops an anvil on his head,\u2019 he wrote of his PA waking up him to survey the damage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018\u201dF***ing hell,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d There was a long pause. \u201cElton,\u201d he said eventually. \u201cYou happened\u201d.\u2019\n\nElton revealed the shoot in Cannes kicked off at 4am, before wrapping at sunset with the crooner going back to his room before the night schedule began. It was there he bumped into Duran Duran\u2019s Simon Le Bon and joined him for a drink at the bar.\n\nAfter downing \u2018either six or eight vodka martinis in the space of an hour, and a couple of lines of coke\u2019, Elton returned to set where he \u2018started rolling around on the floor naked\u2019 before punching his then-manager John Reid.\n\nIt was then in the extract Elton began to detail his battle with cocaine, after he started taking the drug in 1974.\n\nSpeaking about how it made him feel, the singer admitted he enjoyed the \u2018jolt of confidence and euphoria\u2019 it gave him \u2013 however he insisted it gave him too much, after feeling the icy gaze of Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards after one coke-fuelled stage invasion.\n\nElton in 1983 (Picture: WireImage)\n\n\u2018My appetite for the stuff was unbelievable \u2014 enough to attract comment in the circles I was moving in. Given that I was a rock star spending a lot of time in Seventies LA, this was a not inconsiderable feat,\u2019 he detailed.\n\n\u2018Once again, you might think this would have given me pause for thought, but I\u2019m afraid the next 16 years were full of incidents that would have given any rational human being pause concerning their drug consumption.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe added: \u2018That was the problem. Because I was doing coke, I wasn\u2019t a rational human being any more. You become unreasonable and irresponsible, self-obsessed, a law unto yourself.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s your way or the highway. It\u2019s a horrible drug.\u2019\n\nMe: Elton John is out on 15 October.\n\nWorried about drugs?
