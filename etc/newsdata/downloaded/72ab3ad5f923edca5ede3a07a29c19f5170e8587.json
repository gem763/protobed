And it don\u2019t take a prosecutor to see that was a confession,\u201d said Harris, in reference to Trump\u2019s acknowledgment that he withheld aid to Ukraine before calling on its president Volodymyr Zelensky in a phone call to investigate his potential Democratic 2020 rival Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cWhen people say, \u2018how long do you think this impeachment process is going to be?\u2019 Well, it shouldn\u2019t take very long, because, I mean, he did it out in the open,\u201d she added.\n\nHarris later recalled Trump\u2019s boast during the 2016 campaign that he could \u201cstand in the middle of Fifth Avenue, shoot somebody, and I wouldn\u2019t lose any voters.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, in his mind, \u2018I could do anything including in the wide open and get away with it,\u2019\u201d she noted. \u201cWell, on this he will not. Because you know what, dude gotta go. Dude gotta go, he gotta go, and this is the impeachment process.\u201d\n\nCheck out the clip here:\n\nSen. @KamalaHarris at UFCW on impeachment: \"I mean, we have a confession...It shouldn't take long, because, I mean, he did it out in the open!\" pic.twitter.com/HMxe45FSiC \u2014 Tommy X-TrumpIsARacist-opher (@tommyxtopher) October 14, 2019", "description": "\u201cDude gotta go,\u201d said the Democratic presidential candidate.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da57bd7210000150e345147.jpeg?cache=vxwowkfaxq&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
