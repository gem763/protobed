Now, it\u2019s like the all-encompassing wave that appears when a Pok\u00e9mon uses Surf. Google seems to have Pok\u00e9mon on the mind, too, because it apparently plans to help teach you how to use Motion Sense \u2014 its Soli-powered motion-sensing technology baked into the Pixel 4 \u2014 using a short, adorable Pok\u00e9mon demo.\n\n9to5Google obtained the demo, which is apparently called Pok\u00e9mon Wave Hello. It offers instructions for brief interactions with Pikachu, Eevee, and the three starters from the upcoming Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield. The whole thing looks like it can be finished in about two and a half minutes. It\u2019s unclear if it\u2019s designed as both a Motion Sense demo and a teaser for Sword and Shield, or just the former.\n\nGrid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause 9to5Google doesn\u2019t have a phone with Motion Sense, its screenshots and video only show touchscreen interactions with the Pok\u00e9mon, like swiping up to make Scorbunny jump, instead of motion gestures. For now, we\u2019ll have to wait until the Pixel 4 launch to see what motion gestures will be used to befriend the pocket monsters.\n\nWhile it\u2019s fun to see this demo in advance, it seems like the waves of Pixel 4 leaks might ruin all of the surprises not just from Google, but from Google\u2019s partners, too. And there\u2019s still 13 potential days of leaks ahead until Google\u2019s October 15th hardware event.", "description": "We\u2019ve moved beyond a flood of Pixel 4 leaks.
