But this is what the stock market is all about. Sooner or later, the truth will out.\n\nSending a signal\n\nCulp bought 331,684 shares at $9.04 and 252,200 at $7.93 last week.\n\nGranted, he bought some of them before Markopolos published his critique. But buying the stock sends a signal about where he thinks it\u2019s going.\n\nCulp now owns 1.1 million GE shares, valued at about $10 million. It may not sound a lot for a top boss. But he only joined the company last year. And the company\u2019s accounts reveal he has another $13.7 million in \u201cperformance stock units\u201d and \u201crestricted stock units\u201d tied to GE\u2019s stock price performance.\n\nTotal amount Culp now has riding on GE stock: Nearly $24 million.\n\nMeanwhile, some are questioning Markopolos\u2019 motives.\n\nAfter all, say critics, he\u2019s working on behalf of a hedge fund and will stand to make profits from any slump in GE\u2019s stock. He won\u2019t name the fund.\n\n\u2018Bear raiders\u2019\n\nSo-called \u201cbear raiders\u201d seek to profit by driving down a stock price. They typically operate by borrowing stock in a company and selling it, expecting to buy it back later at a lower price once the stock has fallen.\n\nAlmost nobody on Wall Street likes bear raiders. They always make an easy target. Optimism, not pessimism, is considered as American as apple pie.\n\nThe arguments against Markopolos don\u2019t hold much water. Why shouldn\u2019t he get paid for his work? It takes a lot of experience and diligence to produce a 175-page detailed study of a major corporation\u2019s accounts. If he\u2019s right about GE, he should make money from it.\n\nThe internet is full of people who get paid for their own work, and then expect everyone else to work for free.\n\nWhat if he\u2019s spreading false rumors, say critics? Well, yes. It\u2019s always a risk on markets. But in this case it seems unlikely because it would be very unwise. It would destroy Markopolos\u2019 reputation if, and when, it came out. And it would put him at risk of civil and potentially criminal sanctions. Spreading false information to manipulate a stock for profit is against the law.\n\n\u201cTo the extent that you knowingly put out false information to distort the trade in shares to your own benefit, that could violate provisions of the 1934 Securities Exchange Act, and potentially violate criminal laws,\u201d says veteran securities lawyer Ernest Stern, a partner at Culhane Meadows law firm in Atlanta. \u201cYou could be pursued by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice,\u201d he adds.\n\nWorld of hurt\n\nCatching market manipulators is \u201cdifficult (but) not impossible,\u201d says corporate lawyer Braden Perry, a partner at Kennyhertz Perry in Kansas City and a former prosecutor for the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission, the regulator that oversees the commodities markets. And he says one of the biggest challenges in such cases is proving in court that the accused moved the stock price. In the case of Markopolos and GE last week, most observers would agree, that would be easy.\n\nAnyway, investigations are \u201cinvasive and intrusive\u201d for the accused, Perry says. In other words: Miscreants may be entering a world of hurt.\n\nMeanwhile, if it\u2019s OK to seek to profit from a rising stock price, why is it wrong to seek to profit from a falling one? Markets are supposed to reveal or \u201cdiscover\u201d the correct value of a security. Stocks can be overvalued or undervalued. Surely we should welcome anything that tries to move them toward the equilibrium price.\n\nTo hear the critics of Markopolos and other bears, you\u2019d think the major risk to U.S. securities markets today is that stock prices are too low.\n\nIn the past 20 years, we\u2019ve seen two massive stock market bubbles inflate and then collapse, leaving terrible financial damage. You could argue we need more and better bears questioning stock prices during the bubbles. Overvalued stocks, not undervalued stocks, have caused the most damage in recent history.\n\nIs Markopolos right about GE? Only time will tell. Yes, he was correct about Madoff. But we don\u2019t know what other calls he made. And if he was right all the time, he wouldn\u2019t be advising a hedge fund today. He\u2019d be the hedge fund.\n\nBrett Arends is a MarketWatch columnist.", "description": "The General Electric CEO buys the company\u2019s shares to reassure investors.", "authors": ["Brett Arends"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GR880_culp_l_ZG_20181016154813.jpg"}
