A social Europe, a Europe of solidarity, a Europe against racism, populism and the extreme right.\u201d\n\nA woman added:\n\n\u201cI think everyone understands that what happened to Greece and other southern European countries over the last three years is only the beginning. These policies are intended for northern Europe as well.\u201d\n\nThe forum called for fiscal pacts imposed on indebted countries to be cancelled, for a moratorium on debt repayments, higher taxes on the rich and more scrutiny of offshore accounts.\n\nThe organisers claim the event is an act of solidarity towards Greek social movements in their struggle against austerity.\n\nDuring the two day gathering, round tables are being held in order to discuss the movement\u2019s alternative proposals against the crisis and draft a common agenda of action, which is to be called the Athens Manifesto.\n\nAt the end of the summit on Saturday afternoon a big rally is to be staged in the streets of downtown Athens.\n\nEuronews correspondent Stamatis Giannisis said at the summit :\n\n\u201cThe Alter Summit, according to its organizers, aims to bring the various European social movements closer together in their fight against the unpopular austerity policies being implemented by most EU governments. And with Greece going through yet another year of austerity, Athens was to them a most symbolic place to meet.\u201d", "description": "Anti-austerity groups from across Europe have gathered in Athens for the two-day Alter Summit calling for radical changes in policy from western", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/archive/1000x563_archive.jpg", "published_at": "2013-06-07"}
