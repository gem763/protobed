This means rethinking technology and how it folds into your business and unleashes potential. It also means changing the focus of the business from a machine with many moving parts being driven by a central command to a future-facing organisation that is seen \u201cas something that is still robust but more organic and evolving\u201d.\n\nBailey and her colleagues said this will allow organisations to leverage technological change and shifts in talent in a manner to move beyond current business and profit models.\n\n\u201c[All] business is now a technology business. No longer can companies think of their technology function as a separate, independent, and siloed entity,\u201d the authors said.\n\nPractically, this means embedding technology throughout the company and the know-how to use it across the entire business. It will require a change in thinking from leaders, which will also impact how those leaders deploy their technology and human resources and how they facilitate the optimum collaboration between these two important aspects of any company in the modern economy.\n\nTech is the enabler to unleash productive workers and for businesses to have a more positive impact on society as well, BCG said.\n\nThat last point on positive impact is important because the authors point out millennials and Gen Z will make up 59% of the workforce in 2020, according to Manpower research, and these employees have different expectations about how they are deployed, engaged and the businesses they work in. And according to a Gallup study the authors cite, \u201c67% of millennials expect employers to have purpose and their jobs to have societal impact\u201d.\n\nIncreasingly this cohort of workers is also either happy to work remotely or to be independent contractors to businesses. That\u2019s another fundamental shift in the old hierarchical structure where a company had a centralised headquarters or regional satellite where their workforce toiled or went out to meet their market.\n\nGetting this shift right is crucial, the authors said, highlighting that to succeed, \u201corganisations need to fundamentally rethink the way they work\u2014to leverage technology to unleash the potential of people and the ecosystems in which they operate to serve companies, stakeholders and society overall\u201d. Success will then be delivered both commercially and societally, they said.\n\nIn order to adapt and thrive in this evolving environment, BCG shared areas of focus they say will help organisations be more innovative, build better relationships with customers, and get the best out of their human and technological combinations.\n\n\u201cLeveraging technology just to replace employees is a limiting concept for the future,\u201d the authors said. They instead highlight that companies can combine the abilities offered by both technology and humans to get greater leverage for the business and unlock more fully the potential productivity gains.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to simply automate to improve efficiency, productivity, improve quality, and reduce costs. But BCG said companies \u201cmust aspire to go beyond that \u2013 to solve unanticipated problems and to allow people to focus on creativity, improvements, and reimagination\u201d.\n\nBailey and her colleagues cite work MIT is undertaking where it is seeking to \u201ccombine traffic data, shopping data, and human movement data with urban design models\u201d in a way which will eventually reshape how urban planning is done.\n\nBCG also highlights one of the obvious shifts in this trend to human-tech collaboration is the movement from human-run to human-designed, which it said shifts the boundary between human and technology and requires a rethink of how work gets done. The result will be that business will need to have a \u201cwillingness to regularly rethink the organisation structure and an acceleration of workforce planning cycles to keep pace with evolving work, skill, and technology needs\u201d.\n\nThat, in turn, is going to require constant education and re-skilling across employees working lives \u2013 either self directed or company provided.\n\nIn the end, BCG said, this evolution will require \u201coverall ways of working that are more iterative, cross-functional, human-centred in design, and more reliant on decentralised decision making in empowered teams\u201d.\n\nAre you and your business ready to let go to improve performance? That\u2019s the big question being asked in today\u2019s economy.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
