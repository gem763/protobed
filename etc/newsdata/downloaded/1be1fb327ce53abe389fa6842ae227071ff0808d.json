The video shows his coach crawling through the streets. The cyclist, rather than waiting or overtaking on the right, attempts to squeeze between the coach and the kerb.\n\nAfter seeing the video, Ms Evens said today: 'I have offered a full apology to the Goodwin's bus driver and I hope this will be accepted. 'I am someone who is passionate about cycling and walking and in my professional life I work to ensure that other cyclists and pedestrians are as safe as they can be when using our roads. 'However, in this case I clearly jumped to the wrong conclusion and made a mistake. It is clear that the company takes protecting other road users very seriously.'\n\nGeoff, who spent \u00a312,000 on a 360 degree camera system on the coach, was unimpressed.\n\n'If I hadn't invested in all the cameras on my coach it could have been a very different story for the cyclist, but also for me - because I wouldn't be able to prove I didn't do anything wrong,' he said.\n\n'All she saw was me with my handbrake on at the lights and then she heard me beep my horn and say to the cyclist, 'That was dangerous'. 'I just think, what gives her the right to accuse me of this? It's not about her getting it wrong, it's about her making the story up without witnessing it.'\n\n'That woman just saw me and assumed I was in the wrong because I was the coach driver, not the cyclist. 'If this is the treatment you get for doing nothing wrong, god forbid if you do mess up. 'I'm going to make a complaint to Transport for Greater Manchester about her conduct,' Geoff added.\n\nBryony began working at Christopher Little Literary Agency in 1994, after doing a BA in English Literature at the University of Ulster.\n\nIt was here she 'discovered Harry Potter' and after JK Rowling had already had an extensive amount of rejection letters, finally sold it to Bloomsbury in 1995.\n\nChris Boardman was appointed as Greater Manchester's cycling and walking commissioner in 2017.\n\nHe is a British former racing cyclist who won an individual pursuit gold medal at the 1992 Summer Olympics, broke the world hour record three times, and won three stages and wore the yellow jersey on three separate occasions at the Tour de France. In 1992, he was awarded an MBE for services to cycling.", "description": "The PA of Olympic cycling hero Chris Boardman, has been forced to apologise to a coach firm boss.
