A couple of other candidates made very brief appearances including Marianne Williamson via astral projection.\n\nMore from Deadline\n\n\u201cThe Democratic candidates have united together and have decided to handle the impeachment the only way they know how, with a muddled, 10-person Town Hall debate,\u201d moderator Erin Burnett (Cecily Strong) said in opening the proceedings.\n\n\u201cDaddy\u2019s here, America,\u201dHarrelson\u2019s Biden said. \u201cI see you, I hear you, I sniff you, and I hug you from behind.\u201d\n\nHe later added, \u2018I\u2019m like plastic straws, I\u2019ve been around forever, I\u2019ve always worked, but now you\u2019re mad at me? Drink up America.\u201d\n\nDuring the discussion, Biden\u2019s segregation-related background was referenced, and the former VP name-dropped his former mate Barack Obama multiple times\n\n\u201cI\u2019m America\u2019s cool aunt, a fun aunt, I call that a funt,\u201d Rudolph\u2019s Harris said. \u201cThe kind of funt that will give you weed but then arrest you for that weed.\u201d\n\nHarris has changed her stance on marijuana laws several times during her tenure as California Attorney General and during her time in the Senate.\n\n\u201cI hope you all enjoyed hot girl summer, because it\u2019s school librarian fall,\u201d McKinnon\u2019s Warren said.\n\nDavid\u2019s Sanders poked fun at Biden\u2019s difficulty connect with voters, saying: \u2018Remember when everyone thought I would be the one to seem out of touch, this guy makes me look like Drake.\u2019\n\nThe skit got thumbs-up by Harris and Andrew Yang who liked Rudolph\u2019s and Bowen Yang\u2019s impersonations of them, respectively. Harris used what has become one of her signature lines \u2014 spoofed in the skit \u2014 \u201cThat girl was me.\u201d\n\nThat girl being played by @MayaRudolph on @nbcsnl?
