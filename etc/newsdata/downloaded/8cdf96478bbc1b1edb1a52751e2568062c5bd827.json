The job description that afternoon at Crystal Palace, once the home of British amateur boxing, was simple: Was it worth sending any of the British women to the first Women\u2019s World amateur championships? No, was the simple answer.\n\nIn 2016 Adams did win the World amateur title and in 2012 she became the first woman to win an Olympic gold medal, a second followed at the Rio Olympics, then she was a celebrity, then she turned professional, last October she won an \u2018interim\u2019 version of a world title in just her fifth fight and on Friday she has a real fight when she defends her title against Mexico\u2019s Maria Salinas. As I said, she is under pressure to win, to win well and then to get back in the ring and start fighting the ten or more leading women at her weight.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

It is also now 18 years since the first women\u2019s world amateur championships and the hopeful thinking has always been that quality will follow depth, and that the professional business would by now be thriving. It is not, it is that simple.\n\nIn every single top ten of the weight divisions in the professional business \u2013 a total of 17 \u2013 there are novices, raw novices, beginners, which is something I thought would have changed by now. In 2002 I went to Turkey to cover the 2nd Women\u2019s World amateur championships and I was optimistic that the sport would grow, impressed with the variety of styles, the different countries making an early impact. In Antalya that year the North Koreans boxed like pros from the Fifties, the Indians were brilliant, the Turkish and French and Italians were a match for the Russians. It was quality, I left that odd city confident of a real revolution. Now, a few weeks before the 11th edition, a year from the third Olympics with women boxing and with a British woman defending a world title at the Royal Albert Hall on Friday, I\u2019m not so sure.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

September top 10 pound-for-pound boxers in the world 1/11 Who is the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world? The ranking of The Independent's 10 best male boxers on the planet. Take a look through to see who comes out on top. AP 2/11 10. Manny Pacquiao (62-7-2) The Filipino looked sensational to outpoint Keith Thurman, flooring the American and rolling back the years at 40 years old to confirm himself as the No 3 welterweight in the world at worst. Considering the illustrious names on his resume, a place inside the top 10 pound-for-pound list and a world class win this year confirms his place here. AP 3/11 9. Juan Francisco Estrada (39-3-0) The two-weight world champion grabbed the lineal super flyweight title against Sor Rungvisai to snatch his pound-for-pound status and the WBC gold. Getty Images 4/11 8. Mikey Garcia (39-1-0) Despite coming up short against Errol Spence in their welterweight bout, Garcia is still a modern great as a four-weight world champion. Getty Images 5/11 7. Gennady Golovkin (38-1-1) Despite suffering the first loss of his career against Canelo Alvarez, Golovkin's stellar career keeps him in our rankings. Getty Images 6/11 6. Errol Spence (25-0-0) After his impressive win over Garcia in which he didn't drop a round, Spence added another big name to his record. Shawn Porter will be next, to unify the belts and perhaps further close the gap between himself and rival Terence Crawford in the P4P standings. Getty Images 7/11 5. Oleksandr Usyk (16-0-0) The undisputed, undefeated, unified cruiserweight world champion moves up in weight, but injury has delayed his debut against Carlos Takam. Getty Images 8/11 4. Naoya Inoue (18-0-0) The man nicknamed the 'monster' destroyed Emmanuel Rodriguez in two rounds to win the IBF world bantamweight title, elevating his status as one of the world's most dangerous fighters. Getty Images 9/11 3. Terence Crawford (35-0-0) Another three-weight world champion, Crawford enters our top three and reaffirmed his place as one of the sport's greats after a knockout win against Amir Khan. Getty Images 10/11 2. Canelo Alvarez (52-1-2) One loss and a whole heap of controversy but Canelo's record is one to be celebrated, a three-weight world champion and still just 28. The biggest star in the sport and an impressive win over Daniel Jacobs cements his standing, arguably has a claim to the throne, but he just misses out here. Getty Images 11/11 1. Vasyl Lomachenko (14-1-0) There can only be one. The king of the amateur game has stepped up to become the king of the professionals. Just 15 fights into his career and despite one career defeat, the current unified lightweight world champion sets records for days. Loma won a world title in his third fight, became a two-weight champion in his seventh, and a three-weight champion in his twelfth fight. The king. Less magic against a brave Luke Campbell, but more brutality, slashing body shots and exquisite balance and movement. Who's next? Commey, Lopez, Davis?

That saddens me.\n\nIn 1998 Jane Couch was granted the first professional female boxing licence by the British Boxing Board of Control after a stupidly long series of legal battles. Couch, whose book is out, took on the Board and won the right to fight. She is the true pioneer, a scrapper from a different era, poorly paid, neglected, abused in many ways and always overlooked. Couch\u2019s victory over the Board 21 years ago, which was celebrated with the type of diabolical mismatch that has never quite left the women\u2019s side of the game, was meant to be the catalyst. It was not and ten years after her victory there were just a couple of licenced British female professional boxers. The women\u2019s game was nearly dead and then the Olympic lifeline was thrown its way.\n\nThe Olympic rush in 2012 was finally meant to change the game, testimony mounted from mums and dads and little girls rushing to gyms and participation increased at amateur level. There might be record numbers of girls and women walking through the doors at boxing gyms up and down the land, but so far the numbers have not altered the landscape.\n\nAdams is a big name, but not yet a big boxing attraction in the real world of rivalries, competitive fights, great champions and the promise of proper fights. The men\u2019s game offers enough facile matches, but the depth means there are still real fights even if some of the best boxers avoid each other.\n\nOn Saturday night in Manchester I was at a small-hall show and four of the five fights on the bill were genuine 50-50 matches between, mostly, unbeaten novices; I just can\u2019t imagine how long it will be before I will be able sit down and watch a night of British women\u2019s boxing with the same statistics. In 1998 I might have offered a guess, but not now.\n\nSo, as I said, Nicola Adams, the double Olympic champion, one of the best amateur boxers in British history \u2013 male or female \u2013 is under pressure on Friday night. Salinas has lost seven of her 31 fights, has met higher-ranked women than Adams and knows that winning the title can be instantly turned into cash on the thriving Mexican women\u2019s circuit. It will be a good fight and hopefully it will raise the profile of the professional side of the sport in Britain.", "description": "Nicola Adams is under pressure on Friday night at the Royal Albert Hall on both sides of the ancient ropes as she fights for credibility and to test the real popularity of women\u2019s boxing.", "authors": ["Steve Bunce"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/23/12/gettyimages-1090879482.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
