Santander (MC: ), the country\u2019s largest bank which gets most of its profits from the Americas, was up 2.3%. The laggards were those banks who have some of the highest excess reserves, notably the Netherlands\u2019 ING Groep (AS: ) and ABN AMRO (AS: ) \u2013 both of whom have relatively strong balance sheets, by European standards.\n\nAustrian banks Raiffeisen Bank International (VIE: ) and Erste Bank (VIE: ) also underperformed after the country\u2019s new central bank governor made clear he had dissented from Thursday\u2019s actions.\n\nThe biggest beneficiaries on Thursday had been Italy\u2019s banks, as the resumption of quantitative easing promises to lock in profits for them on their disproportionately large holdings of sovereign bonds. The recent installation of a new Italian government that is not threatening to break the EU\u2019s budget rules had, of course, removed a key obstacle to the ECB resuming QE in the first place, neutering one of the (German-led) objections to fresh bond-buying.\n\nEven so, it\u2019s hard to argue that the ECB package on its own is going to be a game-changer for a sector whose returns remain crimped by high legacy costs, high capital requirements and structural challenges such as the rise of online financial platforms.\n\nNor has the bank\u2019s latest interest rate cut made the political backdrop for more aggressive actions to turn the euro zone economy around any easier: German newspapers raged Friday at \u201cCount Draghila, who sucks our bank accounts dry.\u201d\n\nThe was up less than 0.1% at 390.54, on track for a fourth straight weekly gain; Spain\u2019s was up 0.4% and Italy\u2019s up 0.3%, while the fell 0.3% as sterling surged again on confidence that a disorderly Brexit will be avoided. U.K. bank stocks, with their domestic focus, were among the biggest outperformers.", "description": "StockBeat:  \"Count Draghila\" Sends Euro Bank Stocks Flying", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEA6G0CD_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
