It said the possibility of attacks extended to coming months in Naypyitaw, Yangon and Mandalay, the country's three biggest cities.\n\nThere was no explanation of why there might be attacks on those specific dates and no other details were provided. There were no reports that any attack took place Thursday.\n\nThe Canadian and British advisories specified that the potential attacks could be bombings.\n\n\"The Myanmar government has not corroborated this information. No specific measures are recommended at this time,\" said the statement issued by Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth Office.\n\n\"When traveling anywhere in Myanmar, you should monitor the latest developments, continue to remain vigilant, take sensible precautions, avoid large demonstrations or gatherings, and follow the advice of the local security forces,\" it advised.\n\nSeveral armed ethnic groups are battling Myanmar's government for more autonomy, but the fighting usually takes place in their home regions in border areas.\n\nIn August, the authorities were caught by surprise by coordinated attacks staged by an ethnic rebel alliance in five locations, including a military academy outside normal combat areas, where a civilian was killed and a soldier wounded.\n\nThe Northern Alliance, a coalition of armed groups from the Kokang, Rakhine and Ta-ang, or Palaung, minorities, claimed responsibility for the attacks in Mandalay region, where the Defense Services Technology Academy is located, and in Northern Shan state, where 14 people were reported killed.\n\nCombat in Northern Shan State is not unusual, but attacks in Mandalay region, the country's heartland, are virtually unprecedented.\n\nThe rebel alliance said it launched the attacks in self-defense because the Myanmar military didn't stop offensive operations in areas where the minorities live.\n\nSince obtaining independence from Britain in 1948, Myanmar has been wracked by fighting with minority groups in border areas seeking greater autonomy from the central government.\n\nIn the past three decades, the government has reached various cease-fire arrangements with many groups, but it is striving for a comprehensive, more permanent political solution. Most of the groups have so far rejected the government's attempts at a settlement, and combat is ongoing in northern and western areas of the country.\n\nThe rebel alliance comprises the Kokang minority's Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, the Ta'ang National Liberation Army), and the Arakan Army. The Arakan Army has also been engaged in fierce attacks against government forces in its home ground in Rakhine state.", "description": "Canada, Australia and Britain on Friday joined the United States in advising their citizens about possible violent attacks in Myanmar.
