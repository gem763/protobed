The latter term is Maryland's version of an insanity defense.\n\nEmployees of the newspaper who attended the hearing held hands as the attorney addressed the court.\n\nRamos' plea is the latest turn in his long history with the newspaper.\n\nBefore the shooting, he had been accused of harassing the Capital Gazette's staff in connection with a defamation suit he filed against the newspaper in 2012 after it ran a column about his pleading guilty to harassing a former high school classmate who alleged he was stalking and harassing her. The suit was thrown out.\n\nHis anger at the newspaper began with an online harassment and stalking case stemming from late 2009 or early 2010.\n\nThe woman eventually went to police, and Ramos pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor harassment charge. The newspaper's story about the case touched off a tirade from Ramos.\n\nAuthorities say Ramos stormed the newspaper office in June 2018 with a shotgun and methodically killed Gerald Fisch\u00adman, 61; assistant editor Rob Hiaasen, 59; sportswriter, reporter and editor John McNamara, 56; sales assistant Rebecca Smith, 34; and reporter Wendi Winters, 65. It was one of the deadliest attacks on journalists in U.S. history.\n\nPolice say they arrested Ramos after the shooting as he hid under a desk in the newsroom.\n\nSurveillance video from the shooting doesn't show anyone getting shot, but it shows Ramos entering the building with a shotgun, flashes of gunshots and several victims trying to escape. Law enforcement officials are pictured at the scene after the tragedy on June 28, 2018\n\nEditor Rick Hutzell (center) gives a speech to his staff on April 15, 2019, after the Capital Gazette won a special Pulitzer Prize citation for its coverage and courage in the face of a massacre in its own newsroom\n\nEmployees of the newspaper who attended the hearing held hands as the attorney addressed the court.\n\nAnne Colt Leitess, the state's attorney prosecuting the case, described in a statement of facts how Ramos gave himself up to police.\n\n'I surrender. I surrender. I'm your shooter,' Ramos said, according to Leitess' statement of facts, which she read in court.\n\nRamos' mental health had been a point of contention between defense attorneys and prosecutors as they prepared for his trial and he had earlier pleaded not criminally responsible, citing a mental disorder that kept him from understanding the illegality of his actions at the time of the shooting.\n\nAccording to the state's attorney, jury selection would start Wednesday if the judge does accept his guilty plea. A hearing to determine whether Ramos is criminally responsible would begin in November.\n\nThe defense has argued that video of the June 2018 shooting inside the Capital Gazette's Annapolis newsroom is too graphic to be shown at his November trial.
