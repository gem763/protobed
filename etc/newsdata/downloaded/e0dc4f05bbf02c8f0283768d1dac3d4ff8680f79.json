However, there is a worldwide precedent for using the spread in such dishes.\n\nIn Ecuador, a warm, cumin-and-onion-infused peanut sauce is served drizzled over potato cakes; peanut butter is stirred into West African chicken soup and stew to add creamy body and nutrition; and Southeast Asian cuisine boasts the mouthwatering satay sauce, a tangy-spicy-savory peanut sauce, for dipping skewered meats.\n\n[How to upgrade your favorite sandwich]\n\nThat dipping sauce \u2014 and my general love of peanut butter \u2014 inspired this exciting sandwich, where simply grilled chicken is piled onto whole-grain bread, then smothered luxuriously with the boldly flavorful sauce before being layered with crisp, colorful vegetables \u2014 sliced cucumber, grated carrot and fresh spinach leaves. While it\u2019s not a true satay sauce, it hits similar notes with ingredients you probably already have in your pantry. To make it, simply stir the ingredients together in a bowl until creamy and incorporated. As this sauce can be made several days ahead and refrigerated, as can the chicken, the resulting sandwiches make for a thrilling, satisfying meal at a moment\u2019s notice.\n\nMake ahead: The chicken may be made up to 4 days ahead and stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator.\n\nIngredients\n\nFor the sauce\n\n2 tablespoons creamy, natural peanut butter\n\n1 tablespoon water\n\n2 teaspoons reduced-sodium soy sauce\n\n2 teaspoons fresh lime juice\n\n2 teaspoons honey\n\n1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger\n\n1/2 teaspoon Thai red curry paste\n\n1/2 teaspoon Sriracha\n\nFor the chicken\n\n4 pieces chicken cutlets or thin-cut chicken breast, 4 to 5 ounces each\n\n2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil\n\n1/4 teaspoon kosher salt\n\n1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n\n1 tablespoon fresh lime juice\n\n8 slices whole-grain bread (1 ounce each)\n\n1/4 large English cucumber, thinly sliced (4 ounces)\n\n1/2 cup coarsely grated carrot\n\n1 cup baby spinach leaves\n\nSteps\n\nStep 1\n\nMake the sauce: In a small bowl, vigorously stir the peanut butter, water, soy sauce, lime juice, honey, ginger, curry paste and Sriracha until the mixture is well combined and creamy.\n\nStep 2\n\nMake the chicken: Brush both sides of the chicken cutlets with the oil, and season with salt and pepper.\n\nIn a hot grill pan over medium high heat, add the chicken and cook until just cooked through and grill marks have formed, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer the chicken to a plate and sprinkle with the lime juice.\n\nStep 3\n\nMake the sandwiches: Slice the chicken against the grain. To make a sandwich, top a slice of bread with a quarter of the chicken slices, drizzle with about 1 tablespoon of the peanut sauce, then layer with sliced cucumber, carrot and spinach before closing the sandwich with another piece of bread. Repeat to make 4 sandwiches and serve right away.\n\nFrom nutritionist and cookbook author Ellie Krieger, a registered dietitian nutritionist and author who hosts public television\u2019s \u201cEllie\u2019s Real Good Food.\u201d Her new cookbook \u201cWhole in One: Complete Healthy Meals in a Single Pot, Sheet Pan or Skillet\u201d was recently released.
