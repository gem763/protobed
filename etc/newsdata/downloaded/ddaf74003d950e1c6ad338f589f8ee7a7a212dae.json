Lawmakers will be testing Sondland\u2019s willingness to offer clear answers and his loyalty to Trump.\n\nSondland, a hotel executive who donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee, came under increased scrutiny last week after Kurt Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine, turned over text messages in his closed deposition that showed Sondland seeking to encourage Ukrainian officials to agree to \u201cthe deliverable.\u201d\n\nTo get to the bottom of that request, Democrats are trying to establish what leverage Trump used to ask Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Biden, now a political rival for the 2020 election. They have faced broad resistance from the Trump administration, as the president and his legal counsel reject demands for documents and witness testimony.\n\nTrump has responded furiously to the impeachment process, calling the inquiry a \u201cscam\u201d and a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d He will hold political rallies this week in Minnesota and Louisiana, and will likely offer his own defense to his most passionate supporters.\n\nThe heart of the House inquiry, led by the committees on Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight, is the accusation that Trump sought to use U.S. military aid to Ukraine as leverage to get that country to pursue probes, including one against the Bidens, The committees are requesting testimony from State Department officials and others who may have helped Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, push Ukrainian officials to comply.\n\n\u2018Navigate\u2019 Trump\u2019s Demands\n\nThe contents of Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Zelenskiy was initially revealed in a complaint filed by a intelligence community whistle-blower, whose identity remains unknown. That report details Sondland\u2019s trip to Kyiv with Volker on July 26 -- a day after Trump\u2019s call -- to meet \u201cwith President Zelenskiy and a variety of Ukrainian political figures.\u201d\n\nAccording to the whistle-blower\u2019s complaint, \u201cAmbassadors Volker and Sondland reportedly provided advice to the Ukrainian leadership about how to \u2018navigate\u2019 the demands that the president had made of Mr. Zelenskiy.\u201d\n\nThe texts given to the committees last week also show that Sondland and another top American diplomat helped script a proposed announcement by Ukraine\u2019s leader to say his government would investigate Biden and his son Hunter, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. That announcement was never made.\n\nThe texts also show Sondland defending Giuliani\u2019s efforts to get Ukraine to look into the Bidens, even over concerns raised by the top American diplomat in Ukraine, Bill Taylor, who warned against conditioning U.S. military assistance on an \u201cinvestigation.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs I said on the phone, I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d Taylor wrote on Sept. 9.\n\nSondland replied that Trump isn\u2019t seeking \u201ca quid pro quo,\u201d but wanted to test Ukraine\u2019s commitment to reform. He then suggested they stop texting and said Taylor should speak directly to Secretary of State Michael Pompeo.\n\nThough Ukraine is not part of the European Union, the documents now made public show that Sondland, the ambassador to the E.U., played a central role in Trump\u2019s efforts to convince Ukrainian leaders to carry out the investigations.\n\nSome Democrats, including Representative Gerald Connolly of Virginia, a Democratic member of the Oversight Committee, say Sondland should resign.\n\n\u201cThese text messages are deeply troubling. Mr. Sondland has lost credibility and must resign,\u201d said Connolly, in a statement.\n\nSubpoenas Threatened\n\nSondland\u2019s testimony comes after the lawyer for two Giuliani associates -- Ukrainian-born businessman Lev Parnes and his business partner Igor Fruman -- said on Monday they would, for now, put off a request to testify and turn over additional documents by Oct. 14. The committees are prepared to respond with subpoenas to force them to testify, according to a House official.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment defense strategy will be put to the test Tuesday as one of his top diplomats appears before House committees to explain his call for Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden.The fact that Gordon Sondland, U.S. ambassador to the European Union, is", "authors": ["Billy House"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/HlhISlGGFF8SXPX2rHxu6g--~B/aD0yNzAyO3c9MzY4ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/3e5c8b614a4de17dd747946f5d3d0e74", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
