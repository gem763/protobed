Investing.com -- Here's a rundown of the most important regulatory releases from the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday, 30th October. Please refresh for updates. BP (LON: ) PLC tried to repair the damage done by chief financial officer Brian Gilvary on Tuesday's conference call when he said it was unlikely that the company would raise its dividend this year. \"No decision has yet been made with respect to the 4Q 2019 or any future dividend. Any decisions with respect to future dividends will be made by the Board of BP (LON: ) p.l.c. following the end of each quarter,\" the company said in a brief statement. BP (LON: ) had announced an unchanged dividend of 10.25c a share for the quarter. The shares now yield an annualized 6.29%. Next (LON: ) said sales and profit growth slowed in the three months to Oct. 26 after a summery September stopped people buying its new autumn collection. Sales perked up as soon as temperatures fell in October, but the rest of the year is unlikely to be as strong as the last month, it said. Full-price sales rose 1.6% on the year, with store sales falling 6.3% and online sales rising 9.7%. The company maintained its guidance for the full year of a 5.2% increase in earnings per share and a 3.6% increase in full-price sales.\n\nPremarket London: BP Says Don't Give up on Divvy; Next Sales Slow", "description": "Premarket London:   BP Says Don't Give up on Divvy; Next Sales Slow", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPED8A17L_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
