(Photo: Kevin Winter, Getty Images)\n\nHOLLYWOOD \u2013 Should Oscars be called Annas?\n\nSuch was the siren call sent by famed Italian director Lina Wertm\u00fcller at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' 11th annual Governors Awards Sunday night, as the 91-year-old received her honorary Oscar.\n\nAppearing before a ballroom packed with stars including Leonardo DiCaprio, future Batman Robert Pattinson, Jennifer Lopez and Lupita Nyong\u2019o, the diminutive Wertm\u00fcller stood onstage flanked by Sophia Loren and Isabella Rosselini. She held the room rapt as she announced her support for a female Oscar.\n\n\"She would like to change Oscar to a feminine name. She would like to call it \u2018Anna,'\" translated Rossellini. The director launched a chant: \u201cWomen in the room, please scream, 'We want Anna, a female Oscar!'\"\n\n(Mid-translation Rossellini began to chuckle as Wertm\u00fcller told the actress she didn\u2019t care for her plum gown, considering the color bad luck. \u201cThe next time I come dressed in purple,\u201d Rossellini translated, \u201cshe will undress me.\u201d\n\nGeena Davis accepts the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award at the Governors Awards on Sunday, Oct. 27.

She was the first woman to ever be nominated in the directing category for her 1975 film \u201cSeven Beauties.\u201d\n\nOnly five women have ever been nominated in the category. Three were in the room Sunday, including \"Lady Bird\" Greta Gerwig, whose take on \u201cLittle Women\u201d hits theaters this Christmas. \"She's a godmother to us all,\" said Gerwig, introducing Wertm\u00fcller alongside Oscar-nominated director Jane Campion.\n\nCampion additionally drove home sobering statistics, noting 350 men have been nominated for best director. \u201cI\u2019ve been asked to talk about the history of women in the directing category. It\u2019s a very short history. More of a haiku,\u201d she said.\n\nAlso honored was Geena Davis, 63, who was presented with the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award for her work as an advocate for gender equality. Tom Hanks introduced his \u201cA League of Their Own\u201d co-star, happily bringing the crowd back to their Dottie Hinson and Jimmy Dugan days.\n\nDavis said if those gathered were going to be labeled as Hollywood liberals, they may as well lean in and take action addressing gender disparity in scripts. \u201cIf we\u2019re supposed to be a bunch of gender fluid intersectional feminists, then by god, let\u2019s do it right!\u201d she deadpanned.\n\nFour-time Oscar nominated director David Lynch, 73, saw his first statuette Sunday night, too, after a career spanning productions from \u201cThe Elephant Man and \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d to \"Eraserhead\" and \u201cMulholland Drive.\u201d\n\nHis speech was swift and sweet, clocking in at under 45 seconds. He thanked \u201ceveryone who helped me along the way\u201d and complimented his gold Oscar. \u201cYou have a very nice face,\" Lynch remarked, looking at the statue.\n\nAnd after an introduction from his \"Hostiles\" co-star Christian Bale and U.S. poet laureate Joy Harjo, \u201cDancing with the Wolves\" actor Wes Studi made history by becoming the first Native American to win an Oscar, ever.\n\nWes Studi accepts an honorary award at the Governors Awards on Sunday, Oct. 27, 2019. (Photo: Chris Pizzello, Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP)\n\n\u201cI'd simply like to say, it\u2019s about time,\" said Studi, 71. \"It's been a wild and wonderful ride, and I'm really proud to be here tonight as the first indigenous Native American to receive an Academy Award. It's a humbling honor to receive an award for something I love to do.\" Studi then closed his speech in Cherokee.\n\nThe annual dinner is a must for awards season contenders, and Sunday saw plenty, with stars including Eddie Murphy \u2013 recently back in the Oscar conversation thanks to \"Dolemite Is My Name\" \u2013 Quentin Tarantino representing \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,\" Scarlett Johansson who was present for ''Marriage Story\" and \"JoJo Rabbit\" and Taron Edgerton, who continues to rise thanks to his portrayal of Elton John in \"Rocketman.\"\n\nWhen the Oscars were handed out, the afterparty continued just outside the ballroom, where heat lamps, circling trays of French fries and cocktails fueled the starry crowd.\n\nOlivia Wilde held court with her \"Booksmart\" stars Kaitlyn Dever and Beanie Feldstein; Jordan Peele and Nyong'o kept a circle of friends entertained; \"Harriet\" star Cynthia Erivo and Dakota Johnson were deep in conversation; and inside the emptying ballroom, David Oyelowo, Charlize Theron and Quentin Tarantino mingled.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/10/28/governors-awards-2019-geena-davis-female-oscar/2483134001/", "description": "Famed director Lina Wertm\u00fcller has a suggested name change for Oscar.
