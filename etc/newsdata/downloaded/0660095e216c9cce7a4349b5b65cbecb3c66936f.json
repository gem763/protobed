It is the second sexual assault investigation he is facing in Ireland. The first case was reported by The Times in March. McGregor has not been charged in either case, though he was arrested in January for an alleged assault that took place in December 2018, questioned, and released pending the investigation \u2013 which is standard procedure in Ireland.\n\nThe Times reports a woman in her 20s alleged she was sexually assaulted outside a Dublin pub while in a vehicle this past week. The Times report says McGregor has not been charged or interviewed by Irish police in the case.\n\n\u201cConor McGregor is frequently the subject of rumors. He emphatically denies any report accusing him of sexual assault,\u201d a McGregor publicist told The Times in a statement via email.\n\nIreland\u2019s police force, the Garda, told The Times in a statement that investigations were proceeding and no arrests have been made.\n\nIreland\u2019s laws don\u2019t allow individuals charged with sexual assault or rape to be named until they are convicted. To get around issues of potential libel, news outlets in Ireland in both cases typically have referred to the suspect as a \u201cwell-known Irish sports star.\u201d\n\nThe same day news of the first alleged sexual assault was reported by The Times in March, McGregor abruptly announced his retirement from MMA. But he has walked that back in recent months almost to the point of most forgetting it even happened. Most recently, he started a campaign to fight former lightweight champion Frankie Edgar, but UFC president Dana White said that fight will not happen.\n\nMcGregor has been no stranger to brushes with the law in recent years. In April 2018, he showed up in Brooklyn at UFC 223, where rival Khabib Nurmagomedov was scheduled to fight. After being let into a back entrance to Barclays Center, McGregor and a crew of people went after a bus carrying UFC fighters, including Nurmagomedov and his camp. McGregor threw a hand truck through a bus window and left two fighters injured \u2013 and subsequently off that week\u2019s event.\n\nHe wrapped up the criminal case from that infamous incident earlier this year with a plea deal to avoid jail time.\n\nIn March in Miami Beach, McGregor was charged with strong-arm robbery and criminal mischief after he took a person\u2019s phone outside a hotel and smashed it, then left with it. That case ultimately wound up with reduced charges, and a civil suit was dropped.\n\nIn April, McGregor was caught on video punching a man at a Dublin pub after he apparently rejected McGregor\u2019s offer of a serving of his Proper Twelve whiskey brand. McGregor later did an interview with UFC broadcast partner ESPN and apologized for the incident, admitting it was him in the video.\n\nDespite his lack of MMA fights the past three years, McGregor remains arguably the UFC\u2019s most bankable star \u2013 even if people like White now admit that others, like Nurmagomedov, may be passing him in the cage.", "description": "According to\u00a0The New York Times, UFC star Conor McGregor is being investigated in Ireland over\u00a0a sexual assault allegation, the second one he faces.", "authors": ["Mma Junkie Staff", "Published P.M.
