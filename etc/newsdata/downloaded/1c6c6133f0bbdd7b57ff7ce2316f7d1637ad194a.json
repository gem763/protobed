But sometimes, they have it worse than we do, especially when wardrobe malfunctions happen on the ramp; literally everyone in the room is watching them. In a similar incident, a Pakistani model was walking the ramp when her heel broke.\n\nThe incident took place on the third day of Fashion Pakistan Week, when Kesha Siddique was walking the ramp and her heel broke. A fellow model, Subhan Awan, came to her rescue and quickly attempted to fix her heel. After not being able to fix it, he unstrapped her heels and carried them as the two walked the ramp.\n\nThe video of the incident also went viral on social media. Here is the video:\n\nWho is this Gentleman ?

Not so long ago, after suffering a last-minute green room wardrobe malfunction, the actress - Jenna Fischer - turned up wearing a towel. Why? Because, the show must go on, she said. She turned up wearing a towel with a pair of jeans and heels. And along with that, she carried the burgundy dress she was supposed to wear!\n\nThat is what you call confidence!", "description": "From broken zips to broken heels, celebs are also just like us!
