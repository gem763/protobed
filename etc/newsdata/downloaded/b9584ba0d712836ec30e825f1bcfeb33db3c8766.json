The Kurdish fighters had few options after the United States abandoned them, and it had been anticipated they would turn to Assad\u2019s government for support.\n\n\"An agreement has been reached with the Syrian government \u2014 whose duty it is to protect the country's borders and preserve Syrian sovereignty \u2014 for the Syrian Army to enter and deploy along the Syrian-Turkish border to help the SDF stop this aggression\" by Turkey, the SDF said in a statement.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that the deal was reached after three days of negotiations between the Kurdish forces, Russian envoys and Damascus.\n\nJIM HANSON: US MUST DO THIS TO PREVENT ISIS RESURGENCE\n\nOver the past five days, Turkish troops and their allies have pushed their way into northern towns and villages, clashing with the Kurdish fighters over a stretch of 125 miles. The offensive has displaced at least 130,000 people.\n\nOn Sunday, at least nine people, including five civilians, were killed in Turkish airstrikes on a convoy in the Syrian border town of Ras al-Ayn, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and Syrian Kurdish officials.\n\nPresident Trump's decision to essentially give Turkey a green light to advance on the country has been widely criticized as abandoning the Kurds, who were instrumental in the fight against ISIS in Syria. Trump insisted that his decision stems from making good on his promise to get the U.S. out of years-long wars.\n\n\"Very smart not to be involved in the intense fighting along the Turkish Border, for a change. Those that mistakenly got us into the Middle East Wars are still pushing to fight. They have no idea what a bad decision they have made,\" Trump said in a tweet.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nLate Sunday, Syrian TV broadcast from the northern town of Hassakeh where residents took to the streets to celebrate the announcement of cooperation between the Syrian government and the Kurds, and many vowed to defeat the Turkish invasion.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report", "description": "Nearly a week after the U.S. announced its decision to pull\u00a0out troops from northern Syria to make way for a Turkish incursion, Kurdish forces in the country have\u00a0reportedly agreed to a\u00a0new deal with Damascus in a desperate bid to face off against Ankara's offensive.", "authors": ["Edmund Demarche", "Edmund Demarche Is A News Editor For Foxnews.Com.
