Josh Matavesi\n\nMoriarty swapping for Wainwright is another rotational switch. Moriarty had started 28 of his 29 Tests between 2016 and this World Cup but lost his place to Wainwright out in Japan for the Georgia and Australia matches.\n\nThe other change to the side that beat Australia is Rhys Carre, 21, coming onto the bench for Nicky Smith \u2013 another chance for Gatland to see a player who has not played a minute yet out in Japan.\n\nWales know that any win sends them through to the quarter-finals. They have not gone through a World Cup Pool stage unbeaten since 1987 \u2013 the edition where they finished third, their best ever effort.\n\nFiji meanwhile have changed one in their starting XV from the win over Georgia. Edinburgh's No 8 Viliame Mata comes in for Peceli Yato.\n\nFiji coach John McKee expects the battle of the breakdown to be key.\n\nVictory against Fiji would send Warren Gatland's side through to the quarter-finals\n\n'We've looked at Wales closely and we can see what a strong side they are around the breakdown,' he said.\n\n'One of the closest battles will be around the breakdown.\n\n'Wales certainly look to attack the ball on the carriers and either try to win turnovers or slow the ball up. That is going to be a critical area for us, firstly to make sure we get good continuity and that secondly we are effective enough to get quick ball.\n\n'We have got some very good back-rowers, and whichever way we play them it is a very strong strong back row on the park.\n\n'With Viliame Mata coming back from a slight calf strain against Australia, the plan against Georgia was to limit his game time, but he came through with no further problems and he has been training really strong this week.'", "description": "WILL KELLEHER IN BEPPU: Wales have swapped in two back-rowers for their match against Fiji at the World Cup, with Davies and Moriarty starting ahead of Tipuric and Wainwright.", "authors": ["Will Kelleher For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/06/19381432-0-image-a-11_1570425934045.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
