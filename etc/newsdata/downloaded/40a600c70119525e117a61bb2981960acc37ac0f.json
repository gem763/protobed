He was immediately smitten. She was a harder sell. \u201cThat was my first three-year campaign,\u201d he said wryly. It was good practice. Running for office that long takes a toll on a candidate, on staff, and on voters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a completely unique situation,\u201d said Michael Bitzer, a professor of politics and history at Catawba College. \u201cI think he\u2019s still trying to portray himself as an outsider, as a non-politician, but I\u2019m not sure you can claim outsidership when you\u2019ve been running for two and a half, three years for the same seat.\u201d\n\nMcCready says the revelation of the fraud gave him new purpose to keep going.\n\n\u201cWhen they stole these people's votes\u2014you know they targeted the elderly, they targeted African Americans, they targeted Native Americans\u2014I thought I had to fight back,\u201d he said. \u201cYour vote is your voice. If you don't have that, you don't have anything. This is the people's chance to get justice and there's nothing to do but give it our all.\u201d\n\nHe paused.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m ready to be done.\u201d\n\nOf course, if McCready does win, he\u2019ll have to turn around and begin campaigning for reelection in 2020 almost immediately, but he doesn\u2019t want to talk\u2014or think\u2014about that right now.\n\nOver the course of two years, issues can change, too. McCready began his campaign running with a Republican majority in Congress. Now Democrats are in charge of the House, and there\u2019s a hotly contested presidential primary. McCready also has a much stronger opponent in Bishop than he did in Harris. Harris won the 2018 primary by running to Pittenger\u2019s right, but turned out to be a flawed candidate even before the revelation of electoral fraud. Bishop combines much of Harris\u2019s conservatism with the seasoning of a career in politics. Naturally, that can cut both ways. Bishop was the architect of North Carolina\u2019s controversial \u201cbathroom bill,\u201d and McCready has criticized him for his votes on health care in the state legislature. (Bishop\u2019s campaign did not respond to interview requests.)\n\nWhile some Republicans running in 2018 tried to localize their races, deflecting attention away from the unpopular president, Bishop has been happy to nationalize his bid. He has criticized McCready for taking a donation from Representative Ilhan Omar (which McCready later returned). A Bishop ad tied him to Omar, other members of the \u201csquad,\u201d and Senator Bernie Sanders. A Republican ad called him an \u201cElizabeth Warren Democrat.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen the Republicans were in charge in November, it was, Oh, those mean nasty Republicans. Well, now it's more like, Wait a second, you guys weren't supposed to go up there and take a hard left turn like you're going straight to California. You were supposed to govern as moderates,\u201d says Larry Shaheen, a Republican strategist in Charlotte who backs Bishop. \u201cDan McCready has unfortunate timing, and now he is stuck with the leadership team in Washington, which does not play well to your average North Carolinian.\u201d", "description": "North Carolina\u2019s Dan McCready has been running for Congress for three years.", "authors": ["David A.
