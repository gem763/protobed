Specifically, Trump urged Zelensky to work with his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and attorney general William Barr to investigate allegations that Biden used his influence as vice president to quash an investigation into a Ukrainian energy company that had recently hired his son, Hunter, to serve on its board.\n\nPresident Trump admitted Tuesday that he withheld nearly $400 million in congressionally mandated Ukrainian military one week before his call with Zelensky, prompting speculation that he was preparing to engage in a quid pro quo arrangement with his Ukrainian counterpart.\n\nAccording to the whistleblower, Zelensky believed ahead of the July call that his ability to meet with, or speak to, President Trump was predicated on his willingness to look into the Biden allegations.\n\n\u201cMultiple U.S. officials told me that Ukrainian leadership was led to believe that a meeting or phone call between the President and President Zelensky would depend on whether Zelensky showed willingness to \u2018play ball\u2019 on the issues that had been publicly aired by Mr. Lutsenko and Mr. Giuliani,\u201d the complaint reads.\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "The House Intelligence Committee has released the whistleblower complaint on suspected abuse of power by President Trump.The complaint, which has been redacted, can be found here.Citing multiple White House officials, the unnamed whistleblower accuses President Trump of attempting \u201cto solicit interference", "authors": ["Jack Crowe", "Zachary Evans"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/IQ0ugE1z_qIrCgbLOUGD_Q--~B/aD01OTc7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/816b9179e7fbf81838d54b7abacff8a7", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
