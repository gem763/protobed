(John McDonnell/The Washington Post)\n\nIn January 1973, while he was a young banker based in Sydney, Chuck Coltman paid to listen to the Super Bowl VII broadcast via telephone as the Dolphins completed their undefeated season with a win over his beloved Redskins.\n\n\u201cBack then, I couldn\u2019t afford that,\u201d said Coltman, now 76, who is still demonstrating his passion for the burgundy and gold with his wallet.\n\nOn Sunday, the retired banking executive forked over $1,600 to have an advertising firm fly a banner over Miami\u2019s Hard Rock Stadium for two hours before the Dolphins hosted the Redskins in a battle of winless teams. \u201cHelp Skins Fans Fire Bruce Allen!\u201d the banner read, a direct shot at Washington\u2019s team president, who has presided over two playoff appearances and zero postseason wins during his 10-year tenure.\n\n[The first instance of #FireBruceAllen was tweeted in jest. Now it's a movement.]\n\n\u201cUnder Bruce Allen, it\u2019s just been horrible,\u201d Coltman, who has followed the Redskins since 1956, said in a telephone interview after watching Washington improve to 1-5 from the Hard Rock Stadium stands. \u201cIt seems to me it\u2019s a total lack of understanding of how to manage something. You can\u2019t allow internal competition and internal politics to interfere with the objective. \u2026 That\u2019s what Bruce Allen has done historically, and he\u2019s going to keep doing it unless we change it.\u201d\n\nRedskins fans asking the Dolphins for help.

It\u2019s unclear if Allen or Snyder noticed it, but fans on social media and in the stands sure did. Many told Coltman he was a hero and offered to buy him beers.\n\n\n\nRedskins fan Chuck Coltman. (Tim Lyden)\n\n\u201cIt was very exciting to see everyone pointing at it and taking pictures of it,\u201d Coltman said. \u201cI had people telling me it was on Twitter and Facebook. That\u2019s what I wanted. I wanted it to spread around social media and hopefully the team will think about other options than keeping the same Allen regime in charge.\u201d\n\n[Bruce Allen defends Redskins' tenure, says the culture is 'actually damn good']\n\nColtman, who spent most of his career living and working in Philadelphia, gave up his Redskins season tickets about five years ago, but still attends a few games every season.\n\n\u201cI want to want to go to every game, but you\u2019ve gotta have a winner every once in a while,\u201d he said. \u201cThe NFL needs a good team in Washington. If Dan Snyder is a good businessman, he needs to realize he\u2019s losing his customer base. He\u2019s not going to sell the team. If he wants to keep Allen for the stadium deal, fine, but darn it, keep him out of the politics of the football team. Let\u2019s get a pro.\u201d\n\nYou know it's rough when... pic.twitter.com/MVxPFQK2IC \u2014 FOX Sports: NFL (@NFLonFOX) October 13, 2019\n\nColtman took a photo with several fans in \u201cFire Dan Snyder\u201d T-shirts after Sunday\u2019s game. He said he was happy to see a Redskins win, even an ugly triumph that hurt Washington\u2019s chances of landing the No. 1 pick in next year\u2019s draft and may have decreased the likelihood, however slightly, of Allen being relieved of his duties.\n\n\u201cI hope Dan Snyder paid attention and might try something different,\u201d he said.\n\nJust saw this flying outside of Hard Rock Stadium pic.twitter.com/VyyLk34QnF \u2014 Pete Hailey (@PeteHaileyNBCS) October 13, 2019\n\nRead more on the Washington Redskins:\n\nBrewer: The Redskins beat the Dolphins, but there are no winners here\n\nThe key moments from the Redskins\u2019 17-16 win over the Dolphins in Miami\n\nFox sideline reporter Lindsay Czarniak feels your pain, Redskins fans\n\nESPN\u2019s Scott Van Pelt says Daniel Snyder\u2019s Redskins are \u2018on a treadmill to nowhere\u2019\n\nRedskins coaches under Daniel Snyder: A brief, sad history", "description": "Chuck Coltman arranged for the message to be flown over Hard Rock Stadium in South Florida for two hours before Sunday's game.", "authors": ["Scott Allen", "Reporter Covering D.C.
