Ficus benghalensis). \u2018The next big tree is Ficus Audrey, 100 percent,\u2019 says Bullene. Hilton Carter, plant stylist and author of Wild at Home: How to Style and Care for Beautiful Plants, says he\u2019s been seeing it \u2018here and there on Instagram,\u2019 and getting some questions about it on his book tour, so that\u2019s a sign that something is brewing. \u2018When people start asking about particular plants in my workshops, that\u2019s when I know they\u2019re really starting to blow up.\u2019 (Carter also loves Audrey: \u2018Who doesn\u2019t want a plant that already comes with a name?\u2019)\n\nOur experts highlighted its low-maintenance and more forgiving nature when it comes to water and light, which is something Tavella thinks people are starting to prioritize. According to Bullene, Ficus Audrey is a much better fit for most people. \u2018Audrey doesn\u2019t have the same light requirements as the fiddle-leaf fig, so it\u2019s really more adept with filtered light. And with watering, it likes it more moist than the fiddle, but it\u2019s also okay drying out completely. The fiddle really responds negatively to any inconsistency, but Audrey is more tolerant.\u2019\n\nThe fact that Ficus Audrey is relatively easy to care for is definitely the main appeal, but some were equally enthusiastic about its looks. Ficus Audrey bears a striking resemblance to the rubber plant, but it swaps out the glossy, moody, burgundy leaves for some that are small, matte, and emerald green; the leggy and dark trunk for one that\u2019s thick and white, almost birchlike. Bullene told us that you can let it grow straight up as a pole, or it can be (pretty easily) trained to take on a \u2018traditional tree shape,\u2019 leaf canopy and all. Plant Shed\u2019s Joseph Sharp \u2014 who we should note was the first one to tip us off to Ficus Audrey \u2014 thinks that surreal effect of \u2018having something that looks like it should be outside but inside\u2019 is what really makes it stand out. It will be hard to find it in tree form right now, but Roy Paar and Milana Naumenko, co-owners of Water & Light Plant Shop, told us that \u2018growers are very responsive to trends.\u2019\n\nThings are heating up for the new status plant. Water & Light\u2019s stock constantly sells out: \u2018We had to tell our staff they couldn\u2019t buy any because there wouldn\u2019t be anything left for the customers.\u2019 And Bullene says the same thing about the Greenery\u2019s supply. \u2018I just got 20 of our six-foot Audrey poles. I sent an email that they\u2019re back in stock, and they\u2019ll be gone in two days. Everybody is asking for these.\u2019", "description": "We asked plant store owners, plantfluencers, and various other plant and design experts what they predict will be the next status plant (that isn\u2019t a fiddle leaf fig).
