It has been produced by the company ANYbotics and is already on the market.\n\nImage copyright ORCA Hub\n\nOxford's Dynamics Robot Systems Group is using ANYmal to develop new planning and navigation techniques.\n\nPrincipal investigator at the Orca Hub, Prof David Lane of Heriot-Watt, says it presents new opportunities in the energy industry.\n\n\"A lot of the offshore platforms we work on are very small. The spaces are very confined, and wheeled robots won't be able to negotiate their way around the whole platform,\" he says.\n\n\"So robots that crawl, that have legs and can walk, they can go places on the platform that other robots wouldn't be able to.\"\n\nBuilding trust\n\nOrca's partners are also developing offshore robots that can roll on wheels, float on water or sink beneath its surface.\n\nHeriot-Watt were early leaders in developing submersibles that can inspect, repair and help decommission offshore structures.\n\nBut Orca's game changer lies in developing robots that are not remotely controlled but autonomous and make decisions for themselves.\n\nUsing artificial intelligence to create machines that can learn on the job means repairs and inspections can be carried out where radio signals don't reach and control cables won't stretch.\n\nTo the relief of many, there is still a degree of human supervision.\n\nImage copyright ORCA Hub\n\nHelen Hastie, professor of computer science at Heriot-Watt and one of Orca's technical leads, says it is a question of building trust between human and machines.\n\n\"They have an autonomous element, which means that they sense the environment and can make certain decisions by themselves,\" she says.\n\n\"But what's important is transparency, so that the operator understands what the robot is doing and why, and we're trying to get the robots to be explainable so they can explain their behaviour to the operator.\"\n\n'Out of harm's way'\n\nThe Orca Hub is part of the UK government's \u00a393m R&D funding for robotics and AI for extreme environments.\n\nThe offshore industry is under constant pressure to become more efficient. This can be a euphemism for redundancies.\n\nProf Lane says it's not a question of putting people out of work.\n\n\"People just do different jobs,\" she says. \"What it does it take people out of harm's way.\n\n\"The robots will be offshore doing the work but there will still be plenty of people back onshore who will be working on the data and actually working on the robots.\n\n\"The robots don't fix themselves.\"", "description": "Scientists develop fully autonomous robots that could end the need for workers to scale dangerously-tall wind turbines.", "authors": ["Ken Macdonald", "Bbc Scotland Science Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/C33C/production/_109208994_orca1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
