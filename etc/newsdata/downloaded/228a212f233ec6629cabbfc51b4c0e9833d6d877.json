(Hans Gutknecht/Getty Images)\n\nConor McGregor may finally be ready to get back into the Octagon, and he\u2019s apparently willing to do it for free.\n\nThe UFC sent out a tweet wishing former lightweight champion Frankie Edgar a happy birthday on Wednesday. McGregor replied to the tweet just a few hours later, also wishing Edgar a happy 38th birthday. He added, though, a cryptic \u201csee you in December\u201d to the tweet \u2014 making it seem like McGregor is ready to fight Edgar later this year.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nHappy birthday Frankie, see you in December. \u2014 Conor McGregor (@TheNotoriousMMA) October 16, 2019\n\nEdgar responded less than an hour later, saying he has already agreed to a potential fight in December, if McGregor and UFC president Dana White can get it set up.\n\nThat\u2019s when McGregor called on White to set up the fight \u2014 and offered to put up his purse to charity.\n\nThere you go White, make the bout. Give my purse to charity.\n\nFirst responders.\n\nOne for All! @ProperWhiskey \u2014 Conor McGregor (@TheNotoriousMMA) October 16, 2019\n\nEdgar currently boasts a 22-7-1 record. He fell to Max Holloway at UFC 240 in July, marking his second loss in his past three fights.\n\nStory continues\n\nMcGregor hasn\u2019t fought since his loss to Khabib Nurmagomedov last November at UFC 229, and has even announced his retirement on social media since the bout. The former UFC featherweight and lightweight champion was charged with assault after an alleged bar fight in Dublin in April, and is still under investigation for sexual assault. With his current legal issues, it\u2019s unclear if White actually wants him back just yet.\n\nStill, if McGregor\u2019s tweets are to be taken seriously, it sounds like he\u2019s more than ready to fight again. The ball, it seems, is now in White\u2019s court.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "In a series of tweets, Conor McGregor and Frankie Edgar agreed to a fight in December if Dana White can get it set up.", "authors": ["Ryan Young"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/BL8SuXCus2X4T1zWlAxdCg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NzAuNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/y1JBjlB2RjhlcaBseCydKQ--~B/aD0yOTAzO3c9NDI3MTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/b987c9a0-f073-11e9-bbed-22acbfc100a3", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
