Where are we, what's happening here?\"' said Daniel Tommie, 57, a Seminole tribe member.\n\nTommie works in the Ah-Tah-Thi-Ki museum, 60 miles west of Hollywood, in the Big Cypress Indian reservation in the Everglades wetlands.\n\n'Financially there are some tribes that wanted to stay away from gaming because they saw the negative effects ... There is too much crime coming to the reservation, too many elders spending all their money,' he said.\n\n'So I think the important thing is to enjoy that success, but to remember how we got here. Because if you lose your way I'm not sure what will happen.'\n\nJim Allen, CEO of Hard Rock International, said the brand already is filled with guitars, so why not a hotel?\n\n'Wouldn't it be really cool if we could design a hotel shaped like a guitar?' Allen remembers saying. 'Before, we were more of a locals facility. Now, we have the ability to market this internationally.'\n\nAs for the guitar shape, Allen said it's meant to be generic and not necessarily the Gibson Les Paul made famous by Page and others. But he added that Hard Rock has relationships with both Gibson and Page, and the hotel and casino features many Led Zeppelin artifacts.\n\n'When we present the Hard Rock brand on a global basis, it literally starts with Jimmy Page saying, \"It was a cool idea then and it's a cool idea now,\"' Allen said.", "description": "Boasting a 7,000-seat casino floor, 1,200 hotel rooms and 3,000 slot machines, the soaring blue glass Guitar Hotel opened last night with a star-studded event in Hollywood.", "authors": ["Jack Newman For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/10/20173994-0-image-a-18_1571996985347.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
