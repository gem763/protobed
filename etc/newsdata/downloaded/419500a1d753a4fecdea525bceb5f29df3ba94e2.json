At first the inflation will feel great. It\u2019s not until much later will it actually cause any real problems for the economy.\u201d\n\nIn that kind of climate, Muir says a return of inflation is the best long-term risk-reward trade out there. \u201cHands down,\u201d he said. \u201cNo other trade even comes close to offering this payoff asymmetry.\u201d\n\nHis play: Get long inflation breakevens.\n\n\u201cAlthough many investors understand that TIPS (Treasury Inflation Protected Securities) are designed to offer an investor a way to insulate their bond against inflation, less recognize these securities offer a way to bet on inflation,\u201d Muir explained in a blog post. \u201cInflation breakevens are simply the level of inflation the TIPS market is pricing in over the life of the bond.\u201d\n\n\u2018It\u2019s what market participants are least prepared for, and what will hurt the most.\u2019 Kevin Muir\n\nHe added that if we know the TIPS yield and also the yield on a regular nominal bond of similar maturity, we can calculate the market\u2019s expectation for inflation \u2014 the inflation breakeven rate. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing more than the difference in yield between the two different types of bonds,\u201d Muir said.\n\nSo what\u2019s the play? This is where it gets pretty wonky.\n\nIn his words, it\u2019s as simple as getting long TIPS and short the regular bond. \u201cIf inflation ends up being more than the inflation breakeven rate,\u201d he said, \u201cthen the trade would be profitable. If it ends up being less, it would result in a loss.\u201d\n\nThat might be more than the average investor wants to take on. \u201cWhoa!\u201d Muir said, imagining the response. \u201cI don\u2019t want that sort of hassle.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the simpler, ETF way to get long breakevens for those who want to stay out of the fixed-income weeds and still profit from spiking inflation: Go long the iShares TIPS Bond ETF TIP, +0.20% and short the iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF IEF, +0.04% in equal dollars.\n\n\u201cWhat \u2018everyone knows for sure but just ain\u2019t so\u2019 is the belief that inflation won\u2019t (and can\u2019t) return,\u201d Muir said. \u201cIt\u2019s what market participants are least prepared for, and what will hurt the most.\u201d\n\nHe predicts that sometime in the next decade that TIPS will see a surge in demand as investors desperately try to hedge themselves, which makes long inflation breakevens a core holding for Muir and one of the few assets he welcomes getting cheaper so he can build his position at better prices.\n\n\u201cMaybe my confidence is misplaced. Maybe all these deflationists are correct that governments are powerless to hit their inflation targets,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHowever, I\u2019m willing to take the other side of that trade. I think governments will figure out how to create inflation... when they do, it\u2019ll be too late to buy your insurance.\u201d\n\nStocks were holding up nicely on Thursday, with the Dow DJIA, -0.19% , S&P SPX, +0.00% and Nasdaq COMP, +0.07% all logging gains.", "description": "Kevin Muir, longtime trader and market strategist at Toronto-based East West Investment Management, says he\u2019s preparing for a market storm that everybody...", "authors": ["Shawn Langlois", "Social-Media Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR647_inflat_MG_20190919121937.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
