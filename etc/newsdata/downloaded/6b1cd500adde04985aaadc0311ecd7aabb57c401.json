But if you want an island that perhaps most of your jetsetting friends have yet to hear about, consider Spetses.\n\nA spit away from the mainland (or a two-hour hydrofoil from Piraeus port in Athens), Spetses\u2014a densely forested Saronic island surrounded by turquoise bays and home to about 4,000 people\u2014is known to all Greeks because of the role it played in the 1821 War of Independence. This was where Greece began its revolt against the Ottomans. (Literary enthusiasts might be interested to know that John Fowles\u2019The Magus was partially set on Spetses, too.)\n\nIn more modern times, the island\u2019s fame is rooted in its reputation for being the unassuming hideaway of the bold and the beautiful: a Greek prince was married here in 2010; the Niarchoses (who own the neighboring island of Spetsopoula) used to party here; and even the likes of Jackie Kennedy and Ingrid Bergman have retreated to this island on lavish, under-the-radar vacations.\n\nToday, this is what a lot of stylish Athenians pick for a quick jaunt where they don\u2019t need to fight overly tanned tourists for a beach lounger. Instead, they get an island that is so steeped in idyllic tranquility that even the troubling murmur of car tires rolling over pebbled street can\u2019t wrestle guests out of their dreamscapes\u2014only four taxis are allowed access to Spetses.\n\nVilla Persa is a six-bedroom, three-building estate. Louisa Nikolaidou for White Key Villas\n\nSTAY\n\nComing in at under nine square miles in size, Spetses is a breeze to explore regardless of which corner of it you decide to stay in. And because it\u2019s not a massively booming holiday destination (yet), it isn\u2019t crowded with cookie-cutter accommodations. In fact, many of the well-heeled Athenians who come for weekends own homes on the island.\n\nOthers rent them out to travelers. Villa Persa, for instance, is a six-bedroom, three-building estate, which offers incredible privacy thanks to its perch over the old harbor. Exclusively managed by White Key Villas, a travel company based in Greece that can add a culinary team or a local fixer to your stay, this property is just entering the market this season. Owned by a Greek family with an aristocratic lineage, Villa Persa blends stunning architectural details (including the pebbled mosaic courtyard, a feature that is popular on the island) with a charming lived-in aesthetic. It has a lush garden, several dining areas (both indoor and outdoor, of course, should you wish to hire a private chef), and a 52-foot long pool if you don\u2019t want to make your way to the beach.\n\nOrloff Resort is a more straight-forward hotel concept featuring a historic stone mansion that dates back to 1865. Accommodation styles range from a standard double room to a secluded two-bedroom suite to a sprawling three-story residence. Everything is thoughtfully decorated with modern furnishings, most of which were handmade by local artisans.\n\nEAT & DRINK\n\nFind a taverna that appeals to you, ask for a table outside, and then dig into whatever the sea provided that morning is as good a strategy as you can employ when deciding where to eat on the island. In fact, if you\u2019re on Spetses long enough, you may find yourself going back to the same eatery over and over again, such is the casual, convivial energy most of these tavernas exude. The service is typically easy-going, and the food is flavorful and rustic.\n\nFresh seafood at Orloff Restaurant. Orloff Restaurant\n\nAt Tarsanas, which directly faces out to the old harbor, one of the house specialties includes a whole fish prepared a la Spetsiota, oven baked with tomato, onions, garlic, and parsley, which tastes as Greek as it sounds. Not far is Orloff Restaurant (from the same family who owns the hotel mentioned above). Inside a centuries-old building that used to house the island\u2019s very first port authority, the nearly 30-year-old restaurant (it opened in 1991) is a lively spot during peak season. It\u2019s where sun-worshippers hang for gin and tonics at happy hour, which is whenever you\u2019ve had enough of the sand but are not quite hungry for dinner yet. For dinner, tuck into classics like taramosalata, a savory spread made of fish roe (no Greek meal is complete without one) and a portokalopita, an orange pie with yogurt custard, for dessert.\n\nIf you want something a few notches higher up the fanciness scale, book ahead for a table at On the Verandah, which shows off award-winning chef Stamatis Marmarinos\u2019 upscale take on the national cuisine. More impressive still is the comprehensive inventory of Greek wines that you can pair with it. If you don\u2019t know much about Greece\u2019s production, On the Verandah\u2019s wine list is a fantastic tool to learn with, especially if you like ros\u00e9. There are five bottles here, all approachably priced under 40 euros (US$42) to aid with your Greek wine education.\n\nEXPERIENCE\n\nYou\u2019re on a Greek island, so you\u2019re going to spend a lot of time either in or by the sea. But part of the fun on Spetses\u2014where cars are verboten\u2014is reaching that water. One option is on bike. Dotting the island are countless companies where you can rent all sorts of permitted motorized vehicles, which also include motorbikes and ATVs. Many of these outfitters offer guided tours, which is a great way to get the lay of the land\u2014zipping up and down its hills alongside pine forests, stopping only to take photos from incredible view points and eventually down to hidden beaches for a cooling dip. Cycling is in fact one of the activities the island is most famous for because of a triathlon hosted every spring, charmingly nicknamed the Spetsathlon.\n\nThe less taxing and far more luxurious option for getting to the beaches, however, is via a private boat charter. Spetses Cruising is a newly launched \u201cwater limo\u201d operation that offers all sorts of sailing services\u2014from transport (they can be hired for a private Athens-to-Spetses transfer, for example) to day trips around the island, aboard everything from chase boats to superyachts.\n\nFor your day trip, the staff can bring lunch, drinks, stand-up paddle boards, jet skis, and whatever else you desire. They\u2019ll find secret coves and quiet beaches for your to discover or point out mansions for sale (you know, just in case). You don\u2019t even have to restrict yourself to Spetses: They can sail you to nearby Hydra or all the way out to Epidaurus, where a beautifully preserved ancient theater awaits.", "description": "A retreat for well-heeled Athenians, this off-the-radar destination is steeped in idyllic tranquility", "authors": ["Chadner Navarro"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-104872/social", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
