The losing is beating him.\n\nAnnoyed with a reporter\u2019s line of questioning about a drive at the end of the first half in last week\u2019s loss at New England, the Browns fiery quarterback abruptly ended his weekly interview session on Wednesday and stormed off.\n\nMayfield, who is tied for the NFL lead with 12 interceptions, grew increasingly agitated when a reporter asked him about a failed two-minute drive in a 27-13 loss to the Patriots. The Browns were called for a penalty, which Mayfield said prevented them from moving the ball.\n\n\u201cWas I happy with the drive? No, we didn\u2019t score points,\u201d Mayfield chirped. \u201cThat\u2019s the dumbest question you could ask. What?\u201d\n\nMayfield then disgustedly walked away from the lectern and toward his locker.\n\nSoon after, the former No. 1 overall pick went on Twitter to explain his exasperation. Picked by some experts to win the AFC North, the Browns (2-5) haven\u2019t played up to enormous expectations and have lost three straight games.\n\n\u201cEverybody wants to hear the truth until they actually get it,\u201d Mayfield wrote. \u201cI am who I am and always have been. Don\u2019t call it emotional when it\u2019s convenient and then passion when it fits. I care about winning, so yeah I\u2019m frustrated.\n\n\u201cIf I was to act like it\u2019s okay to lose, then y\u2019all would say that I\u2019ve gotten complacent. My sense of urgency is at an all time high. And if I offend anybody along the way. that\u2019s too bad.\u201d\n\nBefore his minor meltdown, Mayfield was cordial while answering questions about Cleveland\u2019s numerous issues this season. The Browns lead the league with 70 penalties, the offense has been unable to find a consistent rhythm and Mayfield has thrown just six touchdown passes after setting the league rookie record with 27 last season.\n\nHe\u2019s ranked 32nd with a 57.6 percent completion rate, and Mayfield \u2014 along with Browns first-year coach Freddie Kitchens \u2014 haven\u2019t figured out how to best use wide receivers Odell Beckham Jr. and Jarvis Landry, who have combined for one TD reception.\n\nMayfield has had a somewhat strained relationship with the Cleveland media since he arrived in 2018. He\u2019s been defensive about some things, but this was the first time his temper got the best of him.\n\nThe exchange Wednesday began innocently with a reporter asking why there didn\u2019t seem to be urgency late in the half.\n\n\u201cWhen the penalty happened, then we were behind the chains,\u201d Mayfield countered.\n\nWhen the reporter interjected with, \u201cbut,\u201d Mayfield shot back.\n\n\u201cNo, stop saying \u2018but.\u2019 I just told you the clock was running and we had a penalty,\u201d Mayfield snapped. \u201cDo you want to give them the ball back? No. You do not play; you do not know it. That is just plain and simple.\u201d\n\nWalking away angrily from a media session isn\u2019t a major sin, but it\u2019s not a great look either for a team leader or the player dubbed as the face of Cleveland\u2019s franchise.\n\nMayfield\u2019s emotions fuel him on the field, where he\u2019s willing to engage in trash talk with opponents or join his teammates for an end-zone celebration following a score.\n\nMayfield developed a reputation for brash behavior while winning the Heisman Trophy at Oklahoma. He infamously grabbed his crotch during a game at Kansas and angered Ohio State fans by planting a red-and-white OU flag at midfield at Ohio Stadium after the Sooners beat the Buckeyes.\n\nHe\u2019s been mostly well-behaved as a pro, but his second season has been a major struggle. After playing one of the league\u2019s toughest schedules through seven games, the Browns visit Denver (2-6) on Sunday before playing three straight home games.\n\nMayfield said it\u2019s time to start winning.\n\n\u201cWe have to take responsibility and take it personal to do our jobs the very best to the highest ability,\u201d he said when asked about improving in the season\u2019s second half. \u201cDoing everything right. Physical mistakes are going to happen, but that is OK. Guys understand that we are human, but the mental aspect of it and the penalties and things like that are things we need to iron out, and that we will get fixed.\n\n\u201cI am taking it personal on the offense to establish that within everybody, and we have everybody on board right now. I think the defense has the same M.O. and we are going to feed off each other.\u201d\n\nNOTES: The Browns claimed LB Tae Davis on waivers from the Giants, who released him earlier this week. He\u2019s appeared in 18 NFL games with five starts. Cleveland had an open roster spot after DE Genard Avery was traded Monday to Philadelphia. \u2026 S Damarious Randall remains sidelined with a hamstring injury sustained on Oct. 13 against Seattle.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "description": "BEREA, Ohio (AP) \u2014 Baker Mayfield's frustration finally boiled over.
