That is why I am seeking a General Election in December to ensure the election of a fresh Parliament which is capable of resolving the issue in accordance with our constitutional norms.\u2019\n\nMr Johnson also asks the EU to \u2018make clear\u2019 that another extension beyond 31 January will not be granted if MPs fail to back his call for a December election.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
