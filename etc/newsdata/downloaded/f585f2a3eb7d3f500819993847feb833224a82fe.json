He had to slam on the brakes because if he hadn't he would have gone into the back of me.\"\n\nAfter pointing out the impatient driver behind her to her daughter, Jess was left even more shocked by what happened next.\n\n\"He then pulled out alongside me to overtake,\" the 39-year-old said.\n\n\"As he pulled in front a knife came flying out of the passenger window.\n\n\"It was black handled - it was like a knife I would use in my kitchen.\n\n\"I had to swerve a little bit to avoid the knife and he pulled in in front of me before quickly pulling out and overtaking the car and lorry in front of us. He then shot off away from us.\"\n\nJess, who owns a pet business, said she went on to \"autopilot\" before realising the seriousness of what had happened.\n\n\"It all happened in the space of about 90 seconds,\" she said. \"I couldn't believe it. We came home and unpacked the shopping and then I rang the police.\n\n\"After thinking about it I realised how dangerous it could have been - it's so shocking.\n\n(Image: Google Streetview)\n\n\"What would have happened if the knife had hit my windscreen? Or if his car had hit mine? Or if he'd hit an oncoming vehicle?\"\n\nJess doesn't think she was deliberately targeted by the act, but thinks that the person who threw the knife could have been trying to get rid of evidence of another crime.\n\n\"I rang the police and they said they could have been throwing away evidence from a crime - which had crossed my mind- so they'd go and have a look and see if they could find the knife,\" she said.\n\n\"I asked my daughter to get his number plate but he was gone so quickly she could barely get her phone out before he was gone. She was left just as shocked as I was.\n\n\"She's thinking about learning to drive when she's 17 in a few months and I hate to think she has to share the road with people like this.\"", "description": "Jess Ebbs, from Long Sutton, says she had been driving home from Wisbech with her 16-year-old daughter", "authors": ["Matthew Lodge", "Image", "Bpm Media", "Google Streetview"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20527335.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_MLL_HMB_061019JessEbbs02.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
