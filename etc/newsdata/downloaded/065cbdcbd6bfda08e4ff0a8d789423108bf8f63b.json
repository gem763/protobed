The cars will also have a driver in them ready to take control should anything go awry.\n\nStan Boland, co-founder and CEO of FiveAI, said the most driverless trials so far had been conducted in the West Coast of America where, roads tended to be wider and on a grid system.\n\nHowever, the Bromley trials would allow the company to see how its cars fare on Britain\u2019s narrower roads and less clement weather conditions\n\nHe said: \u201cIn Northern Europe, we have lower lighting, poorer satellite coverage, higher rainfall and greater density of road users. We also have to deal with erratic, medieval street plans that are nothing like the grid systems of the US.\u201d\n\nThe project behind the trials, StreetWise, has received \u00a312.776 million in Government funding to develop the technology for the UK\u2019s roads network.\n\nThe scheme is being backed by the Direct Line insurance group, who are providing the volunteers from its workforce in its Bromley headquarters.\n\nJade Trimbee, external affairs manager for Direct Line, said that the company had had little trouble recruiting enough volunteers for the trials.\n\n\"I think if you speak to someone who doesn\u2019t work in insurance it is quite astounding to think you will be in a car where there is no driver, she said.\n\n\"But the fact that we work in insurance and there is already quite a lot of work going on on this they are more used to that idea.\n\n\u201cIt is not as scary as some people think it is, it\u2019s happening and it\u2019s here\u201d.", "description": "Driverless cars are set to carry human passengers on Britain\u2019s roads for the first time, a government-backed consortium has announced.", "authors": ["Mike Wright", "Rupert Christiansen", "Allister Heath"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/23/DSC04722_alt-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq7geLMoG17vYWpU6PNwRUHYsTkKcG7L-c0AnKL9Y2_Kw.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
