While a tweet of the kind might appear to be positive and encouraging, it\u2019s also worth noting that it could have an impact on BNB\u2019s price, given Zhao\u2019s influence on the community, hence making the entire thing rather questionable. After all, we\u2019ve witnessed prominent CEOs getting sued for propping up the value of their companies. The question is how long will it take until the crypto industry is held under the same scrutinous standards?\n\nCZ Emphasizes The Value of Holding BNB\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say that Binance Coin (BNB) has seen better days. Over the past few months, the cryptocurrency lost almost half of its value, plummeting from its all-time high of around $40 in June to where it currently trades at $21.\n\nInterestingly enough, the decrease comes amid seemingly massive developments for Binance and its ecosystem in general. Yet, all of this seems to have no impact on investors.\n\nAmong all that, the CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao, posted a seemingly controversial tweet today, \u201cwarning\u201d people that not holding BNB could be a bad play.\n\nI asked this on Dec 8, 2018, when #BNB reached a low of $4.22. We kept on building, never doubted it. Launchpad released in Jan. And now, we continue to #buidl, more ferocious than ever. I want to ask this question again. In the future, don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t tell you. https://t.co/075HkWgqMi \u2014 CZ Binance (@cz_binance) September 14, 2019\n\nWhile the majority of the text seems like a simple recollection of BNB\u2019s glory days, the last sentence is questionable, to say the least.\n\nAfter pointing out BNB\u2019s surge, Zhao said: \u201cIn the future, don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t tell you.\u201d While subjected to interpretation, this sounds awfully lot like a warning that not holding BNB is a bad choice. Moreover, interpreted at large, it could also sound like a piece of financial advice. Needless to say, this line of expression is completely unacceptable in traditional financial markets and we\u2019ve already seen the consequences of it.\n\nStandards Are Not The Same\n\nWhile a lot of the cryptocurrency proponents are urging for regulatory clarity and definitions, it appears that the standards applied for traditional financial markets and for the crypto world are a tad bit different, to say the least.\n\nBack in August 2018, Elon Musk, a person who\u2019s considered to be one of this century\u2019s visionaries, as well as CEO at SpaceX, co-founder, and product architect at Tesla Inc, and a whole lot of other ventures, got into a legal storm with the SEC over a tweet.\n\nMusk said that he\u2019s considering to take Tesla private and that he had secured the funding necessary for it. Back then, he was also a Chairman of the company.\n\nThe SEC took measures immediately, pressing charges against the entrepreneur. Despite voicing his disagreements, Musk settled, agreeing to pay a $20 million fine, to step off as a chairman of Tesla, and to get pre-approval for his tweets from the company\u2019s legal counsel.\n\nIn other words, the US SEC does take social media behavior seriously. And it probably should. Apart from being major shot-callers at their respective companies, a lot of the rich and famous CEOs, including Changpeng Zhao, for that matter, have a serious social media following.\n\nZhao, for instance, has over 429,000 followers on Twitter. Hence, it\u2019s only natural that his opinions would have some sort of influence over the people who read them. As such, it\u2019s questionable at best to use this platform to give any sort of financial advice, let alone one that would impact the price of an asset that his company created.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s worth noting that Zhao is far from being the only one doing so, even subtly. Justin Sun, TRON\u2019s founder, is perhaps the best example of such behavior.\n\nAfter all, we haven\u2019t seen Jeff Bezos directly propping up Amazon\u2019s stock, have we?\n\nBe the first to know about our price analysis, crypto news and trading tips: Follow us on Telegram or subscribe to our weekly newsletter.\n\n", "description": "In a recent tweet, the CEO of the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, emphasized the potential profits that BNB brings to its holders.
