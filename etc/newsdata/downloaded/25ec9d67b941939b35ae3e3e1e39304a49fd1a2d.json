'Then he got really juicy, full of gravy, really fluffy.'\n\n'I was never fluffy honey, I'm sorry,' Joe said cantankerously. 'I was always very hard. I might have been big, but I was never fluffy.'\n\nNever fluffy: Joe insisted that he was never 'fluffy'\n\n'You were just swollen,' Teresa rejoined.\n\nJoe, who lost at least 40lbs since entering federal prison, said that his first stint wasn't the worst: He earned his high-school diploma and did six months of computer courses.\n\nHe also started a business 'with a stock guy' in which they would do 'sports picking.'\n\nPrison life: The reality star, who lost at least 40lbs while in federal prison, said he earned his high-school diploma and did six months of computer courses while incarcerated\n\nAndy asked him if that meant gambling, which Joe denied.\n\n'We're basically just picking sports\u2014let's just say, football, we pick the teams, we don't take the bets,' Joe explained. 'There's a lot of companies\u2014there's a lot of guys out there that do that.'\n\nThe ICE facility, which he moved to next, 'was a terrible experience I don't wish on anybody,' he added, noting that he spent five months in a room with eight people.\n\nImmigration facility: Joe said the ICE facility 'was a terrible experience I don't wish on anybody'\n\n'I literally was going bonkers in there,' he noted, as Teresa listened quietly.\n\nJoe was put into solitary confinement for one week after opening a gym window, which he called 'ridiculous,' saying that the place 'should be shut down.'\n\n'My wife and kids came a few times to see me and it was terrible. You're literally behind a glass, and then I gotta be in an orange jumpsuit\u2026' he complained.\n\nSolitary confinement: Andy Cohen asked Joe about spending time in solitary confinement\n\n'You went from an orange jumpsuit to an orange sportscoat tonight,' Andy pointed out, adding that the first interview he did with Teresa, she wore an orange jumpsuit, too.\n\nWhen Joe left ICE custody, the officers wanted to handcuff him, but he promised to behave, even taking selfies with them and giving them recommendations for things to do in Italy.\n\nAndy asked Joe if it was hard to decide to go to Italy, knowing he may never return.\n\nColor theme: Joe wore an orange sportscoat reminding Andy of Teresa's jumpsuit from a prior interview\n\n'There was no way I was gonna do another year in that county prison there,' noted Joe, who'd asked to leave early. 'Being in there is like having your head in a panini press. Or in a vise.'\n\nTeresa said that she and her three older girls\u2014Gia, 18, Gabriella, 15, and Melania, 14\u2014agreed that he needed to go, especially when they saw how the experience was twisting him.\n\n'It was a little excessive, what I had to go through,' Joe said of his sentence. 'My wife should have definitely did nothing.'\n\nLittle excessive: The native of Italy said that Teresa should not have been forced to serve time\n\nHe explained that his intended plea-bargain would have had him doing 41 months in prison, with Teresa earning no time, but the attorney general 'started pushing the prosecutors\u2026 to put my wife in prison.'\n\n'Well, her signature was on the documents, right?' Andy asked, referring to the fraud.\n\n'Well, no,' Joe rejoined. 'It was on one document, one house, that was probably 10 years ago or however long it was, and\u2026 nothing was probably even done illegal.'\n\nThe host: Andy hosted the The Real Housewives Of New Jersey Special Event: Joe and Teresa Unlocked after the couple spent five years behind bars\n\n'They just get everything and put it together and say everything is done illegal. It doesn't matter if it's one house or two houses, or whatever it is,' he continued.\n\nInstead, Teresa got an 11-month sentence, 'which I thought was really crazy, because my wife never even got a parking ticket before.'\n\n'Do you feel that you are to blame for that?' Andy queried.\n\n'Of course,' Joe admitted. 'I am the one who was doing all the deals.'\n\nTaking blame: Joe accepted the blame for Teresa going to prison for 11 months\n\nLeaving the US was tough, he added: 'I'm happy that I'm out, but sad at the same time. I'm sad that I'm not with my family, I'm sad that I'm not with my wife, of course, and with all my friends and everything back at home. That's where my life is. It's not here, it's there.'\n\nAndy asked the Giudices if they'd thought of reaching out to President Donald Trump, a friend, for help, but Teresa said they wouldn't 'do that to him.'\n\nAsked if she might later request a pardon for Joe, she said: 'We'll see. You never know. I mean, I would love to be pardoned!'\n\n'My mistake was I never became a citizen\u2014that was stupid of me,' Joe admitted. 'But when you're raised here as a kid, you go to school here, you do everything here\u2026 it's not a big deal\u2026 especially when you're not really, you're not a criminal.'\n\n'All's I did was just busting my a** my whole life, and believe me, I was a hard worker. I wasn't one of these guys that just sat around doing nothing all day.'\n\nPresidential intervention: Andy asked if they would consider asking President Donald Trump for help\n\n'But you broke the law,' Andy countered.\n\n'I broke the law, exactly, alright?' Joe retorted. 'But when you come in illegally and you break the law, I think it's a lot worse, you know what I mean? And these guys have more rights than the people that come in legally.'\n\n'By the courts' argument, you are not here legally,' Andy emphasized.\n\n'Every case is different,' Joe said.\n\nTeresa said she was nervous about her upcoming visit to Joe in Italy, as she hadn't seen him in nearly four years, and knew that both of them had changed.\n\nUpcoming visit: Teresa admitted that she was nervous about her upcoming visit to Joe in Italy, as she hadn't seen him in nearly four years\n\nShe cried watching old footage of her daughters dealing with Joe's imprisonment, acknowledging that they had been through 'a lot,' and had to grow up quickly.\n\nJoe said that prison altered him.\n\n'I definitely have a lot more patience nowadays,' he noted. 'You just take things for granted when you have everything... until everything is taken away.'\n\nPast footage: The footage of their daughters brought Teresa to tears\n\n'Listen, I've apologized to my wife, and I've apologized to my kids many times,' he added. 'The only thing you can do is just look forward.'\n\nAsked what he thought of Teresa's foray into bodybuilding, which he had once barred her from doing, Joe begrudgingly said he supported her.\n\n'She did good,' he said. 'She got, what third place or something like that?'\n\n'Did she look hot to you, her body like that?' Andy asked.\n\nNew hobby: Asked what he thought of Teresa's foray into bodybuilding, which he had once barred her from doing, Joe begrudgingly said he supported her\n\nJoe paused before answering, then said: 'Um, I mean, that's the way she looked when we first started dating. She was kind of chopped up like that, she was ripped up like that.'\n\nHe mentioned that it was 'very hard' when Teresa was in prison, saying he would drink 'two bottles of wine' after the kids went to sleep and think about her every night.\n\n'I couldn't stand going there, seeing her there,' he said. 'I would, like, lose it. She didn't deserve to be there. And of course, me feeling guilty that she's there.'\n\nHe was also upset that his own prison stint meant he hadn't gotten to see his eldest graduate from high school or been able to take her to college.\n\nWine drinking: Joe said he drank bottles of wine while Teresa was incarcerated\n\nBut Joe conceded that he had become 'pretty good' at co-parenting, constantly texting his daughters, sending them photos and doing video chats.\n\nTeresa said she blamed Joe for the time she lost with her kids and her mother, who died soon after she was released, filling her with enormous anger.\n\nHer attorneys had told her to stay quiet about the case, lest it hurt her further, she said, and she'd had to endure others criticizing her.\n\nTime lost: Teresa said she blamed Joe for the time she lost with her kids and her mother, who died soon after she was released, filling her with enormous anger\n\nBoth members of the couple thought the other had been unfaithful to them, which shocked Andy, as Teresa had always defended Joe.\n\n'When I was away, he was photographed with women,' she pointed out. 'And he was photographed with women in the beginning of the show.'\n\nJoe recently had to deal with paparazzi photos of Teresa holding another man's hand in Miami.\n\nHe appeared sanguine when Andy asked him about it, saying 'Look, Andy, I'm in here. She's out there. I don't know what's going on. I mean, I wasn't happy about it, of course.'\n\nPaparazzi photos: Joe recently had to deal with paparazzi photos of Teresa holding another man's hand in Miami\n\n'If we stay together, we stay together. If we don't, we don't,' Joe added.\n\n'He's not the jealous type,' countered Teresa, noting that once she jumped on a guy 'and he still brings that up,' to which Joe said, 'She did a little more than jump on him.'\n\nHe'd asked her about the photo, and Teresa said the man was 'a friend.'\n\n'I told Joe: I have a lot of guy friends,' she shrugged. 'We were at a charity event, and my feet were killing me, and he was walking me to my car.'\n\nHolding hands: Teresa said that Joe was not the jealous type\n\n'Is this the guy I met you on the beach with that time?' Andy asked.\n\n'Yes. If I was trying to hide, I would not be in public,' Teresa said.\n\n'I didn't know you were on a beach with him,' Joe paused. 'What beach was that Andy?'\n\n'I told you we were everywhere together,' Teresa protested. 'Him and his friends. I wasn't trying to hide it. If I was trying to hide it, then I would not leave my hotel room, correct?'\n\nShe pointed out that Joe had been photographed with women, to which he said: 'That's what made it okay for you?'\n\n'We're in the public eye, things like that happen,' Teresa responded.\n\n'I'm not the same Teresa I was, and I know he's not the same Joe,' she told Andy. 'I want us to always respect each other, and I do love him as a person. I'll start crying\u2014I do care about him, I love him, I don't know how I'm gonna feel when I see him\u2026'\n\n'Do you still feel the same attraction for him physically?' Andy asked.\n\n'Not while he was in there,' she replied, referring to prison. 'Every time I went to go see him, I felt nothing. I don't know if it was just the place where he was at\u2026 I never wanted to kiss him or anything, 'cause I just didn't like the whole environment.'\n\nTeresa started crying, saying: 'We've been through a lot and I'm just happy he's free.'\n\nHappy tears: The reality star admitted that she was not attracted to Joe physically while he was behind bars and cried as she reflected on all they've been through\n\n'Those don't seem like happy tears,' Andy said.\n\n'It's just mixed emotions I feel,' she responded. 'I'm happy for my daughters that they can FaceTime him now. I'm just happy he's free.'\n\n'It was torturous, him being in there. Mostly the last seven months he was in ICE. 'Cause he was so nasty, and it was mentally draining me. And it was mentally draining my daughters. That's why they were like, ''He has to get out of there''.'\n\nAndy asked Joe if he'd felt anything for Teresa when she was locked up.\n\n'I'll be honest with you,' he said. 'I didn't like her being locked up in that environment, either. I didn't look at her and find her attractive in there. I really didn't.'\n\nTeresa said her girls were aware that she and Joe might divorce if he stayed in Italy, noting: 'I don't think they want to see it happen, obviously. But I think they understand.'\n\nMother and daughters: Teresa was shown with her four daughters while Joe was in prison\n\n'I don't think he would be faithful, and I just don't want to live that life,' she explained.\n\n'It's been three-and-a-half years,' Joe rejoined. 'If I wanted to be with somebody I coulda been with somebody already this week. That's not what I'm lookin' to do.'\n\nHe said he would always love Teresa, 'no matter what happens.'\n\nAndy said Teresa spoke about the relationship in past tense, to which she said: 'That's how I feel right now.'\n\nHer daughter Gia suggested that she reserve judgment until she saw Joe in Italy, and she was trying to do that, she explained.\n\nForever love: JOe said he would always love Teresa, 'no matter what happens'\n\nJoe snarked back: 'I might see my wife and be like, ''Oh, man, you're way too old for me now, honey.'' No, I'm kidding. You never know.'\n\n'I want to wake up with someone every single day. And go to sleep with them,' Teresa offered, noting that the kids didn't want to go to Italy to live, and neither did she.\n\n'My kids are grounded there,' Joe stated. 'I'm not going to pick them up and bring them over here.'\n\nHe suggested that he might meet his children at an intermediary place between the US and Italy, saying 'We could make things work if we wanted to make things work.'\n\n'Listen, Andy,' Teresa said. 'A lot's happened. I want the best for him. I want him to be successful\u2026 but I don't know if we could stay together.'\n\nUnknown future: Teresa said she wants the best for Joe but wasn't sure if they would stay together\n\nShe said that she and Joe needed to talk about whether they'd keep their large house, too.\n\n'I tell her, she's got to get somebody with a lot of money\u2026 to take care of all those things,' Joe said. 'She needs to not date these little young guys that have no money.'\n\n'You've got four kids, her way of living isn't cheap\u2026 she's high-maintenance.'\n\n'She makes a pretty good paycheck,' Andy recoiled.\n\n'At the end of the day she needs more,' Joe boasted. 'I've supported her for a long time.'\n\nDating advice: Joe suggested that Teresa date somebody with a lot of money\n\nAndy mentioned that RHONJ star Caroline once predicted Joe would go to jail.\n\n'It's just so sad, 'cause she's lived that crooked life,' Teresa opined. 'I've never lived that crooked life. And I guess she has and who she comes from\u2026 right back at her.'\n\n'My thing is, ''How could she predict that?'' Does she have anything to do with what happened to Joe and I? Was she a rat?'\n\n'Do you think she called the Feds?' Andy asked.\n\nBold prediction: Caroline Manzo was shown predicting that Joe would go to jail someday\n\n'Maybe,' Teresa mused. 'You never know. Why would she predict those words?'\n\n'Mmm, well, no, I know who went to the Feds,' Joe interjected. 'Let's just forget that.'\n\nAndy asked them if they regretted being on the show, to which Teresa said no.\n\n'Teresa always wanted to be on television,' Joe jabbed. 'She always wanted to be a movie star since she was a little girl. She got her wish, which is good.'\n\n'I wish I never would have done it,' he added, complaining about all the lawsuits he'd been hit with since starring on the show.\n\nTV star : Andy asked them if they regretted being on the show, to which Teresa said no\n\n'Did it change my life? Yes. Did it change Teresa's life? Who knows. Now there's only one thing to do: Make things better and move on.'\n\n'By the way, not to say that you wouldn't have gotten caught,' Andy insisted.\n\n'It was probably the best thing that ever happened to you, Andy,' Joe said. 'I don't think that anybody knew what this Housewives thing was before we started it.'\n\n'There was Orange County and New York before you, and the greatest thing that happened in my life was the birth of my son,' Andy shot back.\n\nBest thing: Joe said they were the best thing that ever happened to Andy, but the host said the birth of his son Benjamin was the best thing to ever happen to him\n\n'And the birth of the New Jersey Housewives,' Joe said.\n\nAs the show closed, Teresa offered up a Sophia Loren quote that comforted her, saying: 'If you haven't cried, your eyes aren't beautiful.'\n\n'These eyes have done a lot of crying,' she affirmed. 'I must have the most beautifulest eyes in the world.'", "description": "The 47-year-old reality star wiped away tears watching clips of her daughters struggling with the imprisonment of her husband Joe, 47, during a joint long-distance interview with him.", "authors": ["Dailymail.Com Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/04/20267210-0-image-a-49_1572237639174.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
