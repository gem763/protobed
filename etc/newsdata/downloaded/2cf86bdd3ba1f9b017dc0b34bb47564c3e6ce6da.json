Agnostics now make up 5 percent of the adult population, up from just 3 percent in 2009, while those who describe their religion as \u201cnothing in particular\u201d has leapt from 12 percent to 17 percent in this ten-year period.\n\nIn absolute terms, the number of religiously unaffiliated adults in the U.S. has grown by almost 30 million since 2009.\n\nThe increase of the religiously unaffiliated has been most acute among young adults, resulting in a markedly less religious generation. Fewer than half of Millennials (49 percent) describe themselves as Christians, while four-in-ten identify as religious \u201cnones\u201d and another ten percent identify with non-Christian faiths.\n\nAlong with the trend toward religious disaffiliation, a similar trend away from religious practice has also emerged over the past decade, Pew found. The number of regular worship attenders (who say they attend religious services at least once or twice a month) dropped by 7 percentage points since 2009, offset by a comparable rise in the number who now say they attend religious services less often (if at all).\n\nWhereas in 2009 regular worship attenders outnumbered those who attend services only occasionally (or not at all) by a margin of 52 percent to 47 percent, today those figures are reversed, Pew discovered. Now a majority of Americans say they attend religious services a few times a year or less (54 percent) while 45 percent say they attend at least once a month.\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "Christianity in the United States is declining at an unprecedented rate and the percentage of Christians has hit an all-time low.", "authors": ["Thomas D.
