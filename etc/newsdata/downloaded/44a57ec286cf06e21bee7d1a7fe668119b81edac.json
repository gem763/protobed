(AP) - An edgy and almost defiant quarterback Mitchell Trubisky insisted he has the support he needs from coach Matt Nagy and the Chicago Bears\u2019 struggling offense will not be torn apart by outside criticism.\n\nHe said Nagy has \u201cmy back no matter what.\u201d And he was adamant the offense is sticking together even though it\u2019s looked unglued on the field lately.\n\nThe Bears will try to put it all together after back-to-back losses when they host the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got each other\u2019s back and we\u2019ve just got to continue to remind each other of that because people are going to continue to try and break us apart, saying we\u2019re not doing this and we\u2019re not doing that,\u201d Trubisky said Wednesday.\n\n\u201cA lot of people on the outside would probably do things differently or do things their way. But the fact of the matter is this is our team, our family, he\u2019s the head coach. We can do it however we want but the fact that we have each other\u2019s backs and we\u2019re going to do it our way, it gives me a lot of confidence.\u201d\n\nThere are all sorts of questions hanging over the Bears (3-3) and Trubisky - and not much room for error.\n\nComing off a 12-4 season and NFC North championship in Nagy\u2019s first year, Chicago appeared poised for bigger things. The Bears were counting on Trubisky to take another step after showing some promise last year and lead the offense to another level.\n\nInstead, Trubisky\u2019s struggling. The offense appears stuck. The vaunted defense has been pushed around lately, too.\n\nThe Bears were 3-3 last year, then went on a 9-1 run to make the playoffs for the first time since 2010. But Trubisky acknowledged this has a different feel, that the frustration on offense is leading to mental errors.\n\nChicago trails Green Bay by 2\u00bd games and Minnesota by 1\u00bd in the division and can hardly afford to lose more ground.\n\n\u201cComing into this year, our highest intentions weren\u2019t to be toward the bottom of the league in offense,\u201d Nagy said.\n\nBut that\u2019s exactly where they are at the moment.\n\nChicago ranks 26th in points per game, 30th in total offense, 29th in passing and 28th in rushing. The Bears have converted just 32 percent of their third downs.\n\nThe run game has struggled with a franchise-low seven rushing attempts in a 36-25 loss to New Orleans last week. The blockers aren\u2019t creating many holes or much protection. But Trubisky simply hasn\u2019t played as well as the Bears hoped. In his third NFL season and second in Nagy\u2019s system, he is averaging 167.8 yards per game and ranks near the bottom of the league at 5.2 yards per attempt.\n\nBut Chargers coach Anthony Lynn apparently saw what Bears general manager Ryan Pace saw when he traded up a spot to draft Trubisky with the No. 2 overall pick in 2017.\n\n\u201cHe reminded me sometimes of Aaron Rodgers,\u201d Lynn said.\n\nThe Bears were hoping Trubisky would build on a solid effort against struggling Washington in a Week 3 victory following rough outings against Green Bay and Denver. But a left shoulder injury early in the win over Minnesota on Sept. 29 forced him out of that game.\n\nHe sat out a loss to Oakland in London the following week. And coming off a bye, Trubisky put on a performance against New Orleans that raised more questions about whether he is the quarterback to lead the Bears to the next level.\n\nThough Trubisky threw for 251 yards and two touchdowns, most of that came late when the game was out of hand. The Bears had only four first downs through the first three quarters.\n\nHe was off target, looked uncomfortable in the pocket and acknowledged he had \u201chappy feet\u201d at times. Trubisky said he needs to \u201ccalm down\u201d and improve his footwork.\n\n\u201cHis confidence isn\u2019t at an all-time high,\u201d Nagy said. \u201cWe\u2019re struggling right now. But he\u2019s not the only one.\u201d\n\nTrubisky insisted the offense will click.\n\n\u201cI think we all know we\u2019re capable of, talent-wise on offense and what we can be and what we did last year,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe in that you\u2019re in the wrong spot, the wrong place.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "An edgy and almost defiant quarterback Mitchell Trubisky insisted he has the support he needs from coach Matt Nagy and the Chicago Bears' struggling offense will not be torn apart by outside criticism.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Andrew Seligman"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/20/saints_bears_football_48715_c0-126-3013-1883_s1200x700.jpg?ecd0d7622a9dc0162a3a9839f761cb4241466345", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
