Until then, most U.S. imports of clothing and shoes from China have been spared.\n\nNow, economists at the University College London and the London School of Economics estimate the newest tariff could cost average households about $460 over a one-year period, according to the New York Times. For some of the wealthiest households, that cost might spike to $970, but fall to as low as $340 for the poorest.\n\nThe cost of the trade war is expected to increase more sharply for nondurables, like food and clothing, than durables, like cars and electronics, the Times reported. That\u2019s where the cost increase of tariffs could bite: Unlike durables, most Americans rely on non-durable goods and therefore can\u2019t really avoid the price hike.\n\nThe trade spat between the U.S. and China first began in March 2018, when Trump imposed tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods, targeting 1,300 items. Less than two weeks later, China responded in kind, slapping tariffs on 128 American products ranging from aluminum, airplanes and cars to pork and soybeans. (When researchers conducted a similar analysis last year, they estimated tariffs cost $60 annually).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe tit-for-tat fight has continued to escalate; up until Sunday, the U.S. already imposed a 25 percent tariff on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods.\n\nNow, however, the share of Chinese imports of textiles and clothing affected by Trump\u2019s tariffs leaps to 87 percent from 10 percent, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics. In fact, under the new schedule, 69 percent of consumer goods will face an import duty, up from 29 percent now.\n\nEarlier tariffs imposed by the Trump administration mostly avoided direct consumer hits, instead of narrowing in on items like imported parts and components. By last September, almost 82 percent of imported inputs from China were covered by a tariff.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is that, for the first time, Trump\u2019s trade war is likely to directly raise prices for a lot of household budget items like clothing, shoes, toys, and consumer electronics,\u201d PIIE senior fellow Chad Brown wrote in a report.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nMore than 160 business organizations, represented by Americans for Free Trade, urged Trump to postpone all tariff rate increases, citing concerns about cost increases for U.S. manufacturers and farmers.", "description": "Economists at the University College London and the London School of Economic estimate it could cost average households about $460 over a one-year period.", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/06/0/0/tugboat-tariffs-tractor-trailer-trucks.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
