In it, the character of Kai (played by Tyler DiChiara), who identifies as trans, is racked with emotion while viewing himself in a mirror with his chest bound.\n\nThe film follows Kai as he escapes from treatment facility with four additional patients: social media influencer Aspen (Hana Hayes), drug-addicted athlete Levi (Mateus Ward), bipolar Theo (Rio Mangini) and alien-obsessed Sawyer (Chelsea Zhang). Together, the members of this motley crew head to the fictional Dreamland Music Festival and, along the way, learn a few things about perseverance.\n\nDiChiara\u2019s performance as Kai has already generated significant buzz, given the scarcity of openly transgender actors in trans roles in both television and film. Ward told HuffPost he and the movie\u2019s casting director spent four months auditioning hopefuls before selecting DiChiara, who recently won a Young Artist Award.\n\nCourtesy of Justin Ward Justin Ward's coming-of-age road trip drama, \"Relish,\" debuts Friday at the Burbank International Film Festival.\n\n\u201cBefore I wrote the script, [producer] Terry Nardozzi and I discussed \u201cRelish\u201d being about five teenagers who need inclusion in their lives to survive,\u201d Ward said. \u201cI knew this was a character I had to handle with care ... [Tyler\u2019s] tape was raw, over-the-top, and it was clear he had very little experience, but man, did he get it! His choices were clear, smart and real. He was Kai.\u201d\n\nThe filmmaker was adamant that Kai be set apart from other transgender characters in that he had \u201cother interests and quirks ... that existed beyond [his] gender identity.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis character would be wild, the life of the party, confident,\u201d Ward said. \u201cFlawed? Absolutely, just as much as the rest of the teens, but not the victim. [He\u2019s] a strong character who loves life and wants to make the most of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cRelish\u201d debuts Sept. 6 at the Burbank International Film Festival.\n\nWatch the official trailer below.", "description": "Justin Ward's road trip drama features trans actor Tyler DiChiara as Kai, who is nobody's victim.
