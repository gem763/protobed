The rookie blasted 53 home runs with 120 RBI this season, providing a bright spot for a New York squad that didn't reach the playoffs despite an impressive second-half run.\n\nHe provides hope for the future for Mets fans and could do the same for Seinfeld supporters willing to suspend disbelief about the clear joke in the tweet.", "description": "No pressure,  Pete Alonso , but television viewers may be treated to a reboot of one of the all-time classics if you're willing to appear on the show...", "authors": ["Scott Polacek"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/830/649/hi-res-919d0724722070b008c173ee0c630c6a_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
