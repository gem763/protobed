It\u2019s a chance for \u201cThe Big Ticket\u201d to prove where he stands in the division, and despite facing an opponent with significantly more experience, thinks he brings something unique to the table.\n\n\u201cHe ain\u2019t seen me,\u201d Harris told reporters, including MMA Junkie, backstage at UFC on ESPN 6 on Friday. \u201cGo back through his log and you have never seen a guy that fought him like I\u2019m going to fight him. Or even a guy that presents the challenges that I\u2019m going to present to him. I respect Overeem, I have the utmost respect for him, but every dog\u2019s got his day and I feel like it\u2019s my time, it\u2019s my turn to step into that spotlight and be what I\u2019m supposed to be. I\u2019m ready for success.\u201d\n\nIf Harris can get past Overeem in their main event matchup, which takes place Dec. 7 at Capital One Arena in Washington, D.C., he would be on a three-fight winning streak. That would give him position for another big fight, and with the heavyweight belt tied up until Stipe Miocic and Daniel Cormier have their trilogy, there\u2019s a clear target.\n\nFrancis Ngannou (14-3 MMA, 9-2 UFC) recently expressed his unhappiness to MMA Junkie about being the odd man out of the title picture. He wants to keep active, and Harris said he would be a more than willing foe.\n\n\u201cSomeone sent me an article today where Ngannou was frustrated,\u201d Harris said. \u201cHe mentioned my name. That\u2019s a fight I\u2019ve always wanted so when I get the win over Overeem fighting him would be good \u2013 that would put me at the cusp of doing what I came here to do, you feel me? So him, Derrick Lewis, all these heavyweights I feel like I match up well with all of them and I feel like I bring something to the table that they really, really going to have to grind and themselves ready for.\u201d\n\nFirst things first, though, Harris must get past the task at hand. Overeem might be on the back end of his career, but the former Strikeforce and DREAM champ has proven he\u2019s still dangerous. Harris said he respects what Overeem brings to the table, because he\u2019s been watching \u201cThe Reem\u201d for as long as he can remembers.\n\n\u201cFighting Overeem is something I\u2019ve always wanted,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI watched this guy fight before I ever put a pair of gloves on, so to be able to step in the octagon and compete against somebody who is widely considered a legend, is a great moment for me. And I think it\u2019s my time so I\u2019m going to go in there and take him out.\n\n\u201cThe only time I ever (idolized an opponent) was in the (Andrei) Arlovski fight. I did. I was like, \u2018Oh man, this is \u2018The Pitbull.\u201d I saw the mouthpiece, I was like, \u2018Holy crap, I remember watching him blitz across the cage.\u2019 But now it\u2019s like, I belong here. I\u2019m in my spot where I\u2019m supposed to be and it\u2019s only up from here for me.\u201d", "description": "Walt Harris is on an upward trajectory in the UFC heavyweight division, and he doesn't want it to stop.", "authors": ["Mike Bohn", "John Morgan", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Farah Hannoun"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/walt-harris-ufc-boston-post-fight-video.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
