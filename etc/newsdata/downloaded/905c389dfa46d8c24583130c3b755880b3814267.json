Nearly complete melting and disappearance of the ice will likely take a couple millennia to go to completion, but it should be a scene of continuous, increasing melting for decades and centuries to come.\n\n\u201cThere seems to be no stopping it at this point.\u201d\n\nDr Roger Braithwaite of the University of Manchester, a glaciologist at the Geological Survey of Greenland from 1979 to 1994, said of Dr Box\u2019s \u201cdeath sentence\u201d statement: \u201cIt\u2019s dramatic, and I\u2019ve heard the words, \u2018Glaciers are doomed\u2019, but if a temperature increases such that a glacier doesn\u2019t have a balanced mass budget, then it will lose mass.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s true enough \u2013 death sentences over thousands of years are still death sentences.\u201d\n\nDr Box\u2019s warning came less than a month after a Cambridge researcher said the \u201cNiagara Falls\u201d-style melting of Greenland\u2019s ice risked pushing up the sea level, threatening coastal settlements around the planet.\n\nThe ice sheet, which holds enough water to raise the sea level by 7m, is \u201cdecaying quite rapidly\u201d, warned Professor Peter Wadhams. He added: \u201cGreenland is now the driver for global sea level rise and will be until the ice has gone from Greenland.\u201d\n\nBut in comments shared with The Independent, two further scientists were more circumspect.\n\nJulienne Stroeve, professor of Polar Observation and Modelling at University College London, said data from thousands of years ago suggested more caution was warranted.\n\nShe said: \u201dWhile rising temperatures are contributing to Greenland losing mass and rising sea levels, calling it a death sentence is somewhat premature as ice cores retrieved in northwest Greenland reveal that during the Eemian period the ice sheet [there] was only a few hundred meters lower than today, despite the Eemian being warmer and sea levels higher than today.\u201d\n\nAnd Dr Twila Moon, from the University of Colorado\u2019s national snow and ice data centre, said: \u201cIt is certain that we are going to continue to lose ice from Greenland over the coming decades, and centuries. However, the amount of ice that will be lost, and the speed of loss, is still heavily dependent on human actions.\u201d", "description": "Rising global temperatures constitute a \u201cdeath sentence\u201d for Greenland as we know it, according to a scientist from the Geological Survey of Denmark. \u201cWe\u2019re losing Greenland, it\u2019s really a question of how fast,\u201d said Dr Jason Box, who is studying the island\u2019s ice sheet.
