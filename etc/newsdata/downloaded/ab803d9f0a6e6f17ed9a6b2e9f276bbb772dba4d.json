But not everyone is standing up to applaud.\n\nEchoing many of his less-than-impressed fellow Germans, the chief executive officer of insurer Allianz SE laid into both the ECB and Draghi last week. \u201cThe politicians and the regulators have told us they fixed the banking system and insurance system in terms of this negative spiral of financial sector risk morphing into sovereign risk and [looping] back,\u201d Oliver Baete said. \u201cIt is the biggest non-truth that exists.\u201d\n\nComing from the boss of Germany\u2019s pre-eminent commercial financial institution, that\u2019s a stinging judgment. What seems to have riled him most is any implication that there is no reason to worry about national commercial lenders holding too much of their country\u2019s sovereign debt, and the resulting potential for market contagion if a bank (or a sovereign) gets into trouble.\n\nIn fairness to the ECB president, his constant deluge of monetary stimulus has worked well for most at-risk euro area countries, who have used the opportunity to painstakingly work themselves out of financial stress.\n\nBut Baete is looking squarely at the exception: Italy, the euro zone\u2019s third-biggest economy. Rome is still saddled with the bloc\u2019s biggest national debt and its debt-to-GDP ratio is above 130%. What galls the Allianz boss is that a policy that\u2019s essentially there to solve Italy\u2019s problems (negative rates) makes it extremely difficult for his company to squeeze out a profit.\n\nAnd as the chart below shows, there\u2019s no evidence of the link between Italy\u2019s banks and its sovereign debt being broken.\n\nThis so-called \u201cdoom loop\u201d between sovereign debt and banks was a big fault-line during the the euro crisis earlier this decade. Fears grew about certain countries being too reliant on domestic banks buying their bonds \u2014 an umbilical cord that meant the state was propped up by its lenders and vice versa. It was a highly stressful time where some sovereign bond yields soared to double-digits.\n\nIt has taken 2.7 trillion euros ($3 trillion) of quantitative easing \u2014 increasing by 20 billion euros a month from November \u2014 along with other stimulus programs to force yields down to where they are today. Ireland, Spain and Portugal have even managed to achieve mainstream bond market status, with negative yields on debt out to nearly 10 years in maturity. Countries such as Spain have taken the opportunity to lower their debt in relative terms, as the chart below shows. Italy, not so much.\n\nExacerbating those lingering doom-loop concerns are other worries about whether the ECB is providing rigorous enough oversight of the bloc\u2019s banks, another key part of Draghi's remit since 2014. My Bloomberg Opinion colleague Elisa Martinuzzi has written about the central bank\u2019s troubling support for the bailout of Italy\u2019s Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA.\n\nWithout Draghi, and his \"whatever it takes\" promise to support the euro in July 2012, the single currency project may have collapsed. But the too-big-to-fail problem still exists in European banking. This is one area where Draghi doesn\u2019t deserve full marks.\n\nTo contact the author of this story: Marcus Ashworth at mashworth4@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Boxell at jboxell@bloomberg.net\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\nMarcus Ashworth is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering European markets.
