The rights of the minority were protected. The American people\u2019s right to know what was going on was protected.\n\nChairman Rodino himself set a standard for fairness and seriousness as a congressman exercising constitutional oversight. In fact, the Rodino Rules for bipartisanship were widely considered so fair and legitimate that when we were faced with a special counsel report charging that President Clinton had committed 11 potentially impeachable offenses, our initial response was bipartisan.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nDemocratic leader Dick Gephardt and I held a joint press conference announcing that we had agreed the entire report should be published so the American people could make up their own minds.\n\nCompare their behavior with the wild lies House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., has been telling for two years \u2013 first about the Russian collusion hoax and now about the Ukrainian absurdity.\n\nIf you read the opening statements of Rodino and Hyde, and then look at the profoundly dishonest, totally made up and entirely false opening statement by Schiff, you can see the difference between people who are trying to uphold the rule of law and those who seek to destroy a president at any cost.\n\nThe result of these very different approaches can be seen in the voting pattern in the House.\n\nIn the current atmosphere \u2013 with the dishonest, one-sided rigged game, and indeed, an obvious liar as chair of the investigation \u2013 can you imagine two-thirds of House Republicans voting with Pelosi and Schiff for a witch hunt conducted under totally partisan rules?\n\nIn November 1973, the House voted to fund the investigation into President Nixon on a bipartisan 367-51 vote. By February 1974, everyone was so convinced that Rodino was being fair and non-partisan that the resolution to conduct a formal investigation passed 410-4.\n\nWhen we were faced with the Starr Report we were in a more polarized environment. The Clinton team had concluded that they had to run a very partisan defense. Despite the intense efforts of James Carville and others to polarize the Democrats, we continued to push with Henry Hyde in an open way.\n\nThe result of our openness was that a substantial number of Democrats continued to vote with us on the procedures despite intense pressure from the White House and outside groups.\n\nIn September 1998, the House released the Starr Report on a 363-63 vote. Democrats favored an investigation by a better than 2-to-1 margin.\n\nIn the current atmosphere \u2013 with the dishonest, one-sided rigged game, and indeed, an obvious liar as chair of the investigation \u2013 can you imagine two-thirds of House Republicans voting with Pelosi and Schiff for a witch hunt conducted under totally partisan rules?\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nEveryone interested in better understanding how fair people used judicial standards and basic fairness in 1973 and 1998 should read former GOP Congressman James Rogan\u2019s personal account of the process in an important book: \"Catching Our Flag: Behind the Scenes of a Presidential Impeachment.\"\n\nIt will make crystal clear that the current partisan actions are a complete sham.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM NEWT GINGRICH", "description": "House Democrats led by Nancy Pelosi are creating a rigged game that sets up a coup to destroy the president.", "authors": ["Newt Gingrich", "Former Speaker Of The U.S. House Of Representatives Newt Gingrich Is The Host Of The"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/05/694940094001_6092465644001_6092461600001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
