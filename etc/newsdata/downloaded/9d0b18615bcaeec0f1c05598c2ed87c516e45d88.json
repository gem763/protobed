You must live in the US or UK and be an Xbox Insider in the Alpha and Alpha Skip-Ahead rings (wow, that kind of makes it sound like a cult). You also must own a device running Android 6.0 or higher and a Bluetooth-capable Xbox One controller. They also recommend using one of those phone-holding controller clips, though that could be because Microsoft is personally selling them.\n\nBut if you have all those things, you can now test the local streaming capabilities of your Xbox. To do this, download the Xbox Game Streaming app on your console, which will run a test to make sure your network connection is strong enough. Then you\u2019re off to the races. Microsoft recommends an upstream bandwidth of \u201cAt least 4.75 Mbps required, 9 Mbps preferred.\u201d\n\n\n\nJonathan Hildebrandt, the Principal Program Manager, said in the announcement, \u201cThis preview is an important step in our journey to deliver game streaming to Xbox players around the world. We\u2019ll work closely with you and the Insider community to gather feedback that will shape and define future iterations of Xbox Console Streaming.\u201d\n\nNote that this isn\u2019t the same thing as Project xCloud, Microsoft\u2019s entry in the cloud gaming race. That service allows you to stream games from a cloud server (hence the term) to your devices. Xbox Console Streaming allows you to stream something from your personal Xbox. I\u2019ll go out on a limb a bit and hope that that means less chance for latency issues, but who knows for sure?\n\nHildebrandt encourages users to test streaming with as many different Xbox One games as possible \u2014 this is basically a test, so it makes sense \u2014 but adds that Xbox 360 and original Xbox games aren\u2019t supported at the moment.\n\nXbox Console Streaming (Preview) Starts Today on Xbox Wire", "description": "", "authors": ["Rachel Kaser"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FXbox-Console-Streaming.jpg&signature=4e4caad00ba1d1e8e07283464305d072", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
