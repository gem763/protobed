The rapper has been prolific as ever \u2013 appearing on popular tracks like Hot Girl Summer and BAPS this year and regularly hosting her Queen Radio show. There is the sneaking suspicion Minaj might be pulling the biggest troll of 2019. But there\u2019s an even worse fear: she\u2019s telling the truth.\n\nMinaj put a time limit on her musical career from the very start. \u201cAs long as seven years from now I\u2019m taking my daughter to preschool,\u201d she rapped on her 2014 track All Things Go. And she frequently rhapsodized on what her influence and power would look like at the finish line. \u201cI will retire with the crown, yes,\u201d she exclaimed on her 2010 anthem Moment 4 Life. There was a consistent through-line in these self-aggrandizing lyrics: a strong desire to open up doors for other female rappers to be proper stars, and not sidekicks or novelty acts. With a crop of new female wordsmiths in the game (Megan Thee Stallion, Cardi B, Sawtee), it is very likely Minaj now considers her work done.\n\nNicki Minaj says she is retiring from music Read more\n\nThese new stars have adopted and improved on the qualities that made Minaj famous. There\u2019s the colorful hair, sex-positive lyrics, and empowering messages about hard work and education. These women are poised to achieve a cultural ubiquity \u2013 both commercially and critically \u2013 that was simply not available to Minaj at the start of her career.\n\nMinaj frequently talks about ushering in a new era of female rap in her songs. But there\u2019s one thing she leaves out of the narratives: how bittersweet it is to see those who come after you have it easier. And as other female rappers have begun to shine, Minaj has grown increasingly outspoken and critical of the music industry and the media in general.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Minaj performs at the iHeartRadio Music Festival in 2011.

And yet Cardi B won a Grammy for best rap album this February for her debut, Invasion of Privacy.\n\n\u201cThe Grammys have brainwashed us for years into believing that the Grammys are about talent,\u201d Minaj responded to the snub, during a candid interview on The Joe Budden Show last month. The remark felt like a sore loser declaring the game\u2019s rigged only when the fraud doesn\u2019t work out in their favor. She\u2019s also handed out \u201cCocksucker of the Day\u201d awards on her radio show, the recipients frequently being journalists who dare to criticize her (as when a Forbes writer said she\u2019s fighting to remain relevant).\n\nOther rappers have retired early, only to later return. Jay-Z made a big hoopla of calling his 2003 record, The Black Album, his final piece of work. He\u2019s released seven albums since then. The stark difference here is Jay-Z walked out victorious, not still fighting tooth and nail for his accomplishments and influence to be properly recognized.\n\nLike many successful people of color (and especially women of color), Minaj had to fight insanely hard to gain respect. But what were once sharp, perfectly timed callouts (\u201cMiley, what\u2019s good?\u201d) have snowballed into almost nonsensical self-comparisons to Rosa Parks and long-winded verbal lashings. To a fan, it feels like Minaj no longer knows where to throw her punches. I would much rather see her step out of the ring with her head held high.\n\n", "description": "The musician has paved the way to fame for other female rappers but she has struggled to accept a changing industry", "authors": ["Andre Wheeler"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/382b299f589a0f0a2190a8231f2fe1c3a64b515a/0_235_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=586ce170d36bbfc605599fc8d2c657c4", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
