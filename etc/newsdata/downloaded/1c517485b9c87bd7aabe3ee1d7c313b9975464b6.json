Instead, it heads into the bye with another loss on the heels of Monday\u2019s blowout loss against San Francisco.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe effort was always there, trying to overcome every obstacle whether it be the turnovers, the self-inflicted mistakes that we had, the defense,\u201d Mayfield told reporters. \u201cWe almost had a complementary football game and we overcame a lot of mistakes.\n\n\u201cWe never quit and there\u2019s a lot of stuff on this tape that we\u2019ll learn from. That\u2019s the hard part. It\u2019s a loss. We\u2019re sick of losing.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, Mayfield took a hit to his left hip and left the field for X-rays. Although he didn\u2019t miss a snap, he didn\u2019t look terribly comfortable afterward. Add to that his perceived regression this season. Through six games, he has passed for five touchdowns with 11 interceptions, the most by a Browns quarterback through six games since Paul McDonald had 12 in 1984, according to ESPN Stats and Info.\n\nAD\n\nCleveland.com\u2019s Mary Kay Cabot broke it down last week. \u201cDefenses have dug into the film and are pressuring Mayfield more, and also trying to force him to go to his right at times. He\u2019s under more duress, and his throws have been off, as evidenced by his 55.9 completion percentage, which is 33rd in the NFL. He also hasn\u2019t had his favorite go-to guy this season in Rashard Higgins, which has hurt him considerably. He\u2019s hanging onto the ball too long, and has been unwilling at times to try to squeeze the ball into Odell Beckham Jr., because he often has a safety over the top.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCabot predicted that Freddie Kitchens, in his first season after the firing of Hue Jackson, would tailor the offense more to Mayfield. That happened at times Sunday \u2014 and Mayfield passed for 249 yards \u2014 but the Browns looked a lot like those old bumbling Browns teams at key stretches. They scored touchdowns on their first three possessions, living up to the hype for a quarter.\n\nThen there was the blocked punt, two interceptions and a lost fumble. They regained the lead, but lost it. They got the ball with a chance to win as the clock was winding down \u2014 only to have another interception.\n\nAD\n\nIt didn\u2019t help that in the zany fourth quarter, when the Browns drove to the 1-yard line and Jarvis Landry fumbled, Kitchens challenged whether the ball had broken the plane when Landry extended his arms, and lost. Seattle ended up taking over on downs at the 2. Late in the game, Kitchens didn\u2019t have a challenge available to him to contest a questionable catch by Seattle\u2019s DK Metcalf.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t move the ball if you keep turning it over,\u201d Kitchens told reporters. \u201cWe scored 28 points and had four turnovers.\u201d\n\nMayfield wasn\u2019t thrilled with the officiating, either.\n\n\u201cThe refs are never an excuse, but I\u2019ll probably be fined for saying this, but it was pretty bad out there,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cKinda ticks me off.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSo now a team that was 2-3-1 on Oct. 14, 2018, takes a similar record (2-4) \u2014 and an 0-3 mark at home \u2014 into the bye week, tasked with maximizing the talent on its roster. And when it returns, it faces the prospect of traveling to New England to play the Patriots on Oct. 27.\n\nRead more on the NFL from The Post:\n\nAD", "description": "Cleveland loses 32-28 to the Seahawks at home, ahead of a bye followed by a road game against the Patriots.", "authors": ["Cindy Boren", "Reporter Covering Sports", "With An Emphasis On Politics", "National Stories"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/3pK925yd_9fDyr_uUtmx2F_Vgok=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5UDNYLXN7II6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
