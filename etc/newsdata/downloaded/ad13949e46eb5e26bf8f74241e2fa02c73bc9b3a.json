Biden to declare his support for impeachment, President Trump stole the spotlight.\n\nMr. Trump announced in a tweet that he was going to do exactly what Mr. Biden planned to demand: release the transcript of his much-discussed phone call with the Ukrainian president.\n\nThe tweet, which he typed out just minutes before Mr. Biden\u2019s major news conference, forced the campaign team into a hectic rewrite session that delayed the speech for an hour.\n\nThroughout a day dominated by an impeachment circus that spanned from Capitol Hill to the campaign trail, Mr. Trump repeatedly showed he was the ringmaster.\n\nHe preempted Mr. Biden\u2019s speech, launched an anti-impeachment fundraising drive for the Trump reelection campaign and did a victory dance when told by reporters that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat, was opening a formal impeachment inquiry.\n\nHe called Mrs. Pelosi\u2019s move \u201ca positive for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur country\u2019s doing the best it\u2019s ever done. They\u2019re going to lose the election,\u201d he told reporters in New York, where he attended the United Nations General Assembly. \u201cHow can you do this and you haven\u2019t even seen the phone call?\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s phone call in July with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was the impetus for the Democrats\u2019 latest impeachment push. A whistleblower accused Mr. Trump of pressuring Mr. Zelensky, using U.S. foreign aid as a lever, to investigate corruption involving Mr. Biden and his son Hunter, who served on a board of a Ukrainian gas company.\n\nHouse Democrats demanded that Mr. Trump turn over documents including a transcript of the call, and Mr. Biden was expected to predicate his endorsement of impeachment on Mr. Trump\u2019s compliance with the request.\n\nBut the Trump tweet threw Mr. Biden a curveball.\n\nMr. Trump promised to release Wednesday a \u201ccomplete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript\u201d of the July 25 phone conversation Mr. Zelensky.\n\n\u201cYou will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNo pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo! This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!\u201d\n\nWhen Mr. Biden eventually got behind the press conference lectern, he said the transcript wasn\u2019t enough.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s failure to fully comply with all document requests and all investigation would leave Congress \u201cno choice but to initiate impeachment.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday evening, though, multiple news outlets reported that the White House was dropping its objections to the whistleblower\u2019s testimony before Congress and to providing the written complaint to the inspector general, though some details on the testimony still needed to be worked out.\n\nHowever the Trump reelection campaign began raising money off House Democrats\u2019 impeachment fervor, which had been building for days and forcing Mrs. Pelosi to drop opposition to the politically risky endeavor.\n\nThe Trump campaign offered to sell his fans a $5 membership in the \u201cOfficial Impeachment Defense Task Force.\u201d\n\nThe soliciting email said Democrats \u201cknow they have no chance of winning in 2020, so now they are crying, \u2018Impeachment!\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t stand for this any longer, and neither should YOU. Which is why President Trump is launching the Official Impeachment Defense Task Force,\u201d it said. \u201cThis task force will be made up of only President Trump\u2019s most LOYAL supporters, the ones committed to fighting for him, re-electing him, and taking back the House.\u201d\n\nThe plea came with a deadline of 4 p.m., when Mrs. Pelosi was scheduled to convene a meeting with the House Democratic Caucus to discuss the sanctioned impeachment effort.\n\nThe email said the $5 contribution would be \u201cdouble-matched.\u201d\n\nThe campaign later resent the email with the deadline extended to midnight.\n\nMrs. Pelosi\u2019s intention to announce a \u201cformal impeachment inquiry\u201d was leaked to the news media before the caucus meeting.\n\nIt was unclear how Mrs. Pelosi\u2019s announcement impacted Mr. Trump. The speaker didn\u2019t announce a House vote to proceed with impeachment or say what had changed for several ongoing investigations of the president.\n\n\u201cThey never even saw the transcript of the call. A total Witch Hunt!\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted.\n\nHe then resorted to his signature all-capital-letters style to call the matter \u201cpresidential harassment!\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
