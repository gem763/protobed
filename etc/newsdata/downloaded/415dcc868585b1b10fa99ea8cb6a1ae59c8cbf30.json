The precise limits of that exemption are a matter of some confusion, but the police said they could ask revelers to remove their masks if they begin chanting protests slogans or engaging in other political activities.\n\nHalloween in Hong Kong this year is going to be LIT, especially in light of the newly enacted anti-mask law. There'll be a Halloween Masquerade party next Thu., & there's even a Google Drive of masks that people can print out & make for themselves: https://t.co/24aWv3gAgo pic.twitter.com/Bhoqpe75A2 \u2014 Mary Hui (@maryhui) October 24, 2019\n\nHong Kong police declared the proposed Halloween gathering to be an \u201cunauthorized assembly\u201d that could \u201cimpose a serious threat to public order and public safety.\u201d\n\nBusiness owners were advised to stand by for police advisories to \u201cclose earlier if necessary\u201d on Thursday to ensure \u201cthe safety of lives and properties.\u201d\n\nThat could be a problem for Hong Kong\u2019s entertainment industry, which views Halloween as a major event for both adults and children. Since the mask ban covers face paint, stations have been set up around popular children\u2019s attractions to help them remove Halloween makeup before venturing back onto the street. The protest movement derided such services as a grim example of Hong Kong\u2019s increasingly authoritarian trajectory.\n\nProtest leaders said they would march even without police permission along a route that will take them past the most crowded bars and clubs. Some of those areas were seen as dangerously overcrowded on Halloween long before the current protests began.\n\nThe police announced plans to deploy 3,000 riot officers and several water cannons on Hong Kong Island, establishing an aggressive early presence on Halloween evening to discourage mobs from forming.\n\n\u201cWe will carry out stop-and-search operations in various locations including MTR stations and intercept vehicles that we suspect are being used to deliver supplies of weapons, petrol bombs and protective gear to protesters on the front line,\u201d a police source told the South China Morning Post on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cPolice will take action if radicals build road barriers and set fires,\u201d another source said.\n\nBusiness owners said they feared clashes between protesters and police could shut them down on a lucrative evening. At least one major event, the Ocean Park Halloween Fest, was canceled in advance.", "description": "Hong Kong protesters are putting together a \u201cHalloween masquerade\u201d for Thursday, complete with downloadable templates for masks.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1176565697-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
