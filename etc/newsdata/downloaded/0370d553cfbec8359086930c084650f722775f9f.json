I came across a businesses \"valued\" at $20 million with no revenue, no prototype just an idea on paper. It's just ludicrous!\n\nOn the rare occasion I do invest in a zero revenue generating company, I would look at the strength of their management team and the potential of the industry. Unfortunately there is a lot of dumb money out there, so it is quite easy to raise millions with just an idea on paper.\n\nDo you think we are in a fintech bubble?\n\nI've being saying yes for years, but the valuations of tech businesses continue to grow and grow. Call me old fashioned, but I prefer businesses that make actual profit rather some tech businesses that raise year on year based on crazy valuations. Some of the tech businesses coming out of Australia are fantastic but I think globally valuations of tech businesses need to be scrutinised.\n\nThere are plenty of stocks trading on hefty multiples. Do you think the market is currently over valued?\n\nYes, to a degree. I believe there are various industries that trade at ridiculous multiples. Hype creates demand!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich stocks are catching your eye?\n\nNASDAQ: Hubspot is an amazing CRM (customer relationship marketing), making moves. ASX: Xero will make some big moves over the next 12 months.\n\nWhat is the dream company you'd love to own (on the ASX) indiscriminate of its valuation?\n\nXero's is a great piece of software that is continually evolving, their revenue will continue to grow.\n\n(Bell sold out of Hubspot but wished he didn't, while he is an investor in Xero).\n\nDo you think value investing will make a comeback?\n\nI don't think its disappeared. I believe there are plenty of stocks on the ASX that are completely undervalued.\n\nProperty markets are softening. What's your expectations for the market over the next 12 months? Are you a buyer, seller or holder?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI don't research the property market heavily, but a good mate of mine who has made a few hundred million in property firmly believes you buy and hold. Yes there will be dips, but over time, property prices will increase. Have a little patience.\n\nBest bit of advice you can give someone with $50,000 to invest?\n\nInvest in yourself with further education and health.\n\nWorst investment you've made?\n\nThe list is long. Invest in industries you understand and if you invest in a start-ups ensure the founder(s) and yourself are on the same page. Some, not all, of new start-ups spend other people's money recklessly. You'll be surprised how common this is.\n\nWhen I started making a little bit of money, I engaged so called professionals to invest on my behalf, all three were a disappointment. If something sounds too good to be true, it generally is. Take that money, invest in your own businesses that you control.\n\nDo you have an investment idol or someone you admire?\n\nSuccessful investors with humility.", "description": "Young tech entrepreneur Nick Bell reckons he's a bit old-fashioned, preferring to invest in businesses that make 'actual profit'.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_1.3889%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_576%2C$x_904%2C$y_316/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/bf03fdab032f82126ffe71401740552aa8c28410", "published_at": "2018-10-01"}
