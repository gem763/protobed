I find myself struggling to remember the last time I read a story about the City by the Bay that didn\u2019t involve some jaw-dropping level of stupidity. So I suppose it\u2019s rather pointless to complain about their latest fit of nonsense, coming in the form of declaring the National Rifle Association to be a terrorist organization. Still, I suppose we should take a look at the coverage from CBS San Francisco and see what all of this is about.\n\nBy a unanimous vote, San Francisco\u2019s Board of Supervisors have passed a resolution declaring the National Rifle Association a domestic terrorist organization and urging other cities to follow their example. While the vote was mostly symbolic, city officials were ordered to \u201ctake every reasonable step to limit\u201d business interactions with the NRA and its supporters. Supervisor Catherine Stefani, whose district includes the Marina and Presidio neighborhoods, sponsored the resolution because of federal inaction in the wake of a mass shooting in nearby Gilroy where a gunman opened fire at the city\u2019s famed Gilroy Garlic Festival, slaying three, injuring 20 before killing himself.\n\nWhat\u2019s perhaps even sadder is the fact that the NRA actually felt they had to respond to this meaningless gesture. The group tweeted out an answer, calling the vote \u201ca reckless assault on a law-abiding organization, it\u2019s members, and the freedoms they all stand for.\u201d\n\nThe one aspect of this whole \u201cdomestic terror\u201d debate that liberals always seem to miss is that we don\u2019t actually have a statue under federal law criminalizing or even defining \u201cdomestic terrorism.\u201d All of our terror laws focus on attack and threats coming from outside our borders. (We could probably use such a statute, but it\u2019s not in place yet.)\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean that San Francisco\u2019s vote is without teeth. You\u2019ll note that the resolution demands that the city \u201ctake every reasonable step to limit business interactions with the NRA and its supporters.\u201d We are once again facing the liberal tactic of blacklisting those they disagree with, only now it\u2019s being officially endorsed by a municipal government rather than some random celebrity or Twitter mob.\n\nThe phrase \u201cand its supporters\u201d is of particular concern. Is the city planning on refusing to accept contract bids from anyone with an NRA membership or a pro-Second Amendment bumper sticker on their truck? Will they start firing municipal employees who are members? Any actions such as those should land them in court immediately, and I certainly hope that\u2019s what happens.\n\nThis is yet another example of how we are now truly living in the boycotocracy. Seeking to economically damage anyone you disagree with is a festering problem that will continue to spread. And before long, conservatives will be doing it to liberals in a game of oneupmanship, if that\u2019s not already happening. Eventually, we find ourselves in a state of civil war that\u2019s only missing the actual firefights.
