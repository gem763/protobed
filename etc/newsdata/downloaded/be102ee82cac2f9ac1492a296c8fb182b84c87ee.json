He rebuffed Democrats\u2019 calls last month to immediately reconvene the Senate to take up House-passed legislation on gun background checks, and instead ordered three Senate committee chairmen to explore what they can do with bipartisan support in the upper chamber.\n\nPresident Trump had expressed an interest in the background check issue after the El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, shootings last month that collectively claimed the lives of more than 30 people.\n\nBut after another shooting in West Texas over the weekend in which at least seven people were killed, the president downplayed that aspect of the debate as the administration prepares legislation to expedite executions for people found guilty of mass killings.\n\n\u201cGoing back, even five or six or seven years, for the most part, as strong as you make your background checks, they would not have stopped any of it,\u201d the president told reporters.\n\nDemocrats say new gun controls, including bans on some semi-automatic rifles and high-capacity ammunition magazines, as well as \u201cred flag\u201d laws that allow law enforcement to temporarily seize guns from dangerous people, need to be a top priority when lawmakers return to Washington next week from their summer break.\n\n\u201cWhen will enough be enough?\u201d said Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee. \u201cPresident Trump and Senate Republicans need to stand up to the NRA and say it\u2019s time to take action, it\u2019s time to save lives.\u201d\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, meanwhile, blasted Mr. McConnell\u2019s cautious approach to deciding what to put on the floor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to lead on this issue. Put the House-passed background checks bill on the Senate floor for debate and a vote,\u201d the New York Democrat tweeted.\n\nMr. Schumer is likely to be much less happy with Mr. McConnell\u2019s more aggressive stance on a potential Supreme Court opening.\n\nThe GOP leader said Republicans would \u201cabsolutely\u201d support filling a potential vacancy on the Supreme Court if one happens between now and the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to leave a single vacancy behind by the end of next year,\u201d he told Mr. Hewitt.\n\nDemocrats have accused Mr. McConnell of a double standard, after he famously cited the looming 2016 presidential election as reason to slow-walk the confirmation process for Judge Merrick Garland, who President Obama nominated to fill the seat of the late Justice Antonin Scalia that year.\n\nBut Mr. McConnell said Tuesday that historically, Supreme Court nominees don\u2019t get confirmed in the throes of a presidential election campaign when the White House is held by a different party than the Senate. That was the case in 2016, but isn\u2019t the case now.\n\n\u201cThere was nothing I did that would not have been done had the shoe been on the other foot had there been a \u2026 Republican president and a Democratic Senate,\u201d Mr. McConnell said on Tuesday. \u201cSo look, they can whine about this all day long, but under the Constitution there is co-responsibility for appointments \u2014 the president makes the nomination and the Senate confirms. We are partners in the personnel business, up to and including the U.S. Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg recently underwent treatment for pancreatic and lung cancer, sparking speculation of a new vacancy, though she said over the weekend she\u2019s on the way to being \u201cvery well.\u201d\n\nThere has also been intermittent talk about the potential retirement of Justice Clarence Thomas, though he has pushed back against those rumors this year.\n\nMr. McConnell on Tuesday also said Democrats\u2019 priorities such as the Green New Deal environmental and social overhaul were unlikely to make it through the Senate, and that voters will have their say next year.\n\n\u201cIf the Democrats get power again, they\u2019re going to turn us into a socialist country,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Green New Deal, \u2018Medicare for All,\u2019 add it all up, and you have fundamentally changed America into a country it\u2019s never been before. That\u2019s what\u2019s really at stake next year, not all of this hot rhetoric, but the cold, hard reality of what they\u2019ll do if they get power.\u201d\n\nHe also shot back at those critics on the left who\u2019ve labeled him \u201cMoscow Mitch\u201d for not moving quickly to pass election security legislation. Mr. McConnell says the administration has already taken major steps behind the scenes against Russia and other potential election interferers, and he said to call him soft on Moscow is wrong.\n\n\u201cUnbelievable for a Cold Warrior like me who spent a career standing up to the Russians to be given a moniker like that. It\u2019s an effort to smear me,\u201d he said. \u201cSo they\u2019ll say anything and do anything. This is what we\u2019re up against with the hard left today in America.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
