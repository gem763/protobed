Rescue efforts stalled by flooded vehicles and roads turned to rivers. Communications in ruins and basic infrastructure \u2014 including shelters, hospitals and public buildings \u2014 under water.\n\nAnd all around, vicious winds and crashing waves brought on by Hurricane Dorian, one of the most powerful storms recorded in the Atlantic, continued to whip the low-lying islands of the northwestern Bahamas for a second day.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the power and ferocity of the storm, it\u2019s also the length of time it spent over Abaco and Grand Bahama,\u201d said Marvin Dames, the minister of national security of the Bahamas. \u201cThat\u2019s a disastrous outcome.\u201d\n\nFive people have died. Children were among them, Mr. Dames said earlier, adding that he expected the death toll to climb.", "description": "The true extent of its toll is only beginning to emerge, even as Hurricane Dorian continues to lash the archipelago.
