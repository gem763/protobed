This was a character based storyline of a young couple, a family and community all dealing with the reality of what we all must face \u2013 but for Sinead, she was facing it all too soon.\n\nCoronation Street have taken their time with this. We have watched the relationship of Sinead and Daniel grow from something viewers who still thought she was best placed with Chesney, could engage with and believe in.\n\nAnd longer than that, we have enjoyed Sinead as the ditzy, quirky, uniquely stylish, fun loving, old before her time, streetwise yet naive but selfless and caring character. Characters come and go in soaps all the time \u2013 especially a soap that\u2019s nearing the age of 60. But Sinead is a fairly unusual character for soap and one that could easily have been a staple of the show and later become one of their old guard when the century anniversary comes along.\n\nThe death of Sinead has not been rushed, nor was the decision that she should even be killed off by all accounts. It\u2019s a story that has grown organically and sought to be human and mostly grounded in reality. And a very harsh reality \u2013 no more so when she was forced to make the horrific choice of whether to go through with her pregnancy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite the story being almost two years on screen since Sinead started to become unwell, the ending suddenly feels it has come from nowhere \u2013 and isn\u2019t that just the very nature of death? Even when we see it coming, nothing can prepare us for how heavy it is.\n\nAnd Corrie weren\u2019t pulling the punches with the last episodes, which had a raw and gritty feel to them. Throughout the scenes in the wake of Sinead\u2019s terminal diagnosis, there has been humour, laughter and hope through the gloom.\n\nBut as it ended, there was little joy to be had as Sinead clung to the last wisps of her young life, not ready to leave her family and dreading the prospect of Bertie not remembering her.\n\nShe gave an outstandingingly delivered and written piece to a recorded video for Bertie where she passed all of her own values of being kind onto her son \u2013 and it\u2019s a video I hope to see the show revisit as Bertie grows up as it\u2019s a mantra that has never been more relevant and will continue to be so.\n\nIt\u2019s very unusual for a soap to have such a long scene of one character simply delivering dialogue. Almost the entire first half of an episode was Katie McGlynn lying in bedand speaking to a webcam. But it was one of the soap\u2019s most captivating scenes of all time.\n\nIn every living room across the country, you would be able to hear a pin drop as viewers hung onto every word, their forkful of dinner half way to their mouth and their eyes gathering tears. In the age of our busy lives, catch up, Netflix \u2013 for a mainstream channel to be able to do that live is an achievement. And it only got more emotional from there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe guilt of Sinead\u2019s mum was surprisingly touching and the effects of Sinead drifting between sleep and seeing her day disjointed was realistic and impactful. There was no drawn out dramatic death scene or implication that Sinead was not suffering, struggling or feeling afraid. Katie performed the subtle attributes of the physical acting so well \u2013 with harboured breathing and tired fatigue. This story should be the making of Katie \u2013 who deserves a bright future in the acting world.\n\nAnd both she and Rob delivered some of the most heartwrenching scenes I have seen on television in those final moments as they went over memories, and he begged her to stay just a bit longer. She passed away peacefully but the whole community was impacted.\n\nLike in the episode following Aidan\u2019s death, this sent ripples through the whole of Coronation Street. Scenes in the Barlow household reflecting on the death of characters such as Alma, Hayley and Mike were deeply moving and very toned down, without hysteria or sensationalism.\n\nThe gathering in the pub of everyone supporting one another and remembering Sinead were also very touching \u2013 and it can\u2019t be forgotten about how much it must have hit Chesney too as he sat numbly throughout. This was a woman he had loved for years and probably always will, let\u2019s not forget.\n\nCoronation Street dealt with the most human and relatable of stories with honesty, a little bit of brutality but also with care, consideration and laced it with human flaws and vulnerabilities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd every one of us were sitting in bits as they played out, episodes for the show\u2019s history books, as we held onto those we love just that little bit tighter and remembered to phone or messaged those we don\u2019t speak to nearly enough.\n\nThis death may have been fictional, but the reality of it is not \u2013 and not one viewer could have failed to have been moved or impacted in their own way by it.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what true drama can still do.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Corrie aired devastating scenes.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay", "Soaps Editor"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Sinead-Tinker-inCoronation-Street-ce0a_1572008865.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
