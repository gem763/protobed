Ananidze curled a free-kick well over. Hendrick lashed into the side-netting after a goal-mouth scramble. Connolly\u2019s late cameo saw the striker sprint clear on goal only to slash wide.", "description": "Tbilisi (AFP) \u2013 Republic of Ireland were forced to settle for a dour 0-0 draw against Georgia in Tbilisi as their bid to qualify for Euro 2020", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/12/0abe3e_republic-ireland-manager-mick-mccarthy-had-settle-goalless-draw-georgia-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
