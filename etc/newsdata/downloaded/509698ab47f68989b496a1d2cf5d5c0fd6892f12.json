But you look at it as a whole and see if you can live with it.\u201d\n\nWorkers could be back at factories as soon as Saturday. Picket lines, which have been staffed round-the-clock by workers at GM plants from West Virginia to Texas for the nearly six weeks since the strike began on Sept. 16, will end.\n\nEmployees said they wanted a more equitable contract as General Motors reaped near-record profits while shutting plants in the United States. Many said the company\u2019s growing use of temporary workers, including many who\u2019ve worked for years alongside permanent employees for significantly less pay and fewer benefits, was a motivation for the stoppage. Workers also pointed to the wage system GM instituted after the recession, which required a lengthy period \u2014 eight years \u2014 for workers to \u201cgrow in\u201d to full hourly pay of about $32 an hour or less.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cGM is proud to provide good-paying jobs to tens of thousands of employees in America and to grow our substantial investment in the U.S,\" company CEO Mary Barra said in a statement.\n\nUAW General Motors members ratified the 2019 Collective Bargaining Agreement this evening ending the longest automotive strike in 50 years. https://t.co/Ijap4brQdX \u2014 UAW (@UAW) October 25, 2019\n\nAnd workers described a lingering sense that the company, which has enjoyed near record profits in recent years, was not paying its fair share to workers, whose inflation adjusted pay has declined over the last twenty years while executive compensation, like the $22 million package giving to Barra, had ballooned.\n\n\u201cThe contract made significant gains for GM workers, including temps, and the UAW can legitimately call it a hard-fought victory,\u201d said Joseph A. McCartin, a labor scholar at Georgetown University. \u201cThat it lasted 40 days and cost GM an estimated $2 billion showed how hard a fight it was. But the fact that there was some doubt over whether it would be ratified, that it wasn\u2019t ratified in every factory, and was narrowly ratified in others, indicates that the issues raised in this fight haven\u2019t been permanently settled.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTutwiler said he hoped that the fight would inspire other workers pushing for change around the country. The action came amid a surge in the number of workers participating in strikes. In 2018, the most recent full year for which statistics are available, nearly 500,000 walked off their jobs, the highest number since 1986, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nHow big were the teacher strikes last year?

Other unions, as well as more informal groups of organized workers, say they are paying attention.\n\nLast week, 25,000 teachers in Chicago began a strike that has canceled classes in the country\u2019s third-largest public school district. Some union organizers said they had been watching the GM situation closely.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe length of the UAW strike \u2014 the longest at GM since 1973 \u2014 exacted a cost for both the company, workers who have forgone regular paychecks, and related businesses from the Midwest into Canada and Mexico which experienced layoffs.\n\nWe've reached an agreement with the UAW that recognizes our employees for the important contributions they make to the success of the company. Our new four-year labor agreement provides employees with a world-class wage, benefit & profit-sharing package. https://t.co/KijJWZKIRo pic.twitter.com/LfJHOzuof8 \u2014 General Motors (@GM) October 25, 2019\n\nThe auto giant has lost more than $1 billion in earnings, while workers have forfeited $835 million in wages, though the signing bonus will wipe out the lost earnings for most, East Lansing consultancy the Anderson Economic Group estimated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m ready to go back to work,\u201d said Vanessa Banks, president of UAW Local 1590, which represents GM workers at a plant in Martinsburg, W.Va.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The strike is part of an uptick in stoppages the last two years, giving unions a sense of momentum.
