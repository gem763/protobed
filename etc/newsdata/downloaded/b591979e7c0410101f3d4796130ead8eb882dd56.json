My season had ended a little bit earlier than I had expected it,\u201d the 15-time major winner told reporters at Narashino Country Club near Tokyo.\n\n\u201cI had the procedure a little bit early and got ahead of it,\u201d he added.\n\nWoods is in Japan this week to play in the US PGA Tour\u2019s inaugural Zozo Championship, a $9.75 million event that is the second tournament of an almost $30 million Asian swing.\n\nHe then intends to round off his year by playing in the Hero World Challenge on December 4, before going to Australia to captain Team USA in the Presidents Cup which begins on December 13.\n\n\u201cI thought that I had enough time to rehab it correctly and be ready for this event, be ready for Hero, and I\u2019m going to Australia either way whether I\u2019m playing or not,\u201d Woods said.\n\n\u201cI had it done and, as I said, it\u2019s been nice to be able to squat down and read putts and I started going at it full speed again.\u201d\n\nWoods, who completed a remarkable return from years of injury and personal problems to win the US Masters in April, said his knee had been giving him more pain as the year wore on.\n\n\u201cIt progressively got worse and got to the point where it was affecting even reading putts,\u201d the 43-year-old Woods said.\n\nWoods has a large depth of talent from which to make his four captains picks ahead of the match against Ernie Els\u2019s International team at Royal Melbourne.\n\nHe admitted it hasn\u2019t been easy. \u201cI\u2019ve been pretty consumed by it,\u201d he said, adding his return to fitness made it more likely that he would use one of his wildcards on himself.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Tall order\u2019 \u2013\n\n\u201cIt made me more hopeful that I could play this week, play Hero and play Australia,\u201d said Woods, who has dropped one place to number 10 in Monday\u2019s new world rankings.\n\n\u201cThe way I was feeling towards the middle part of the year, it was going to be a tall order to be able to do it all.\u201d\n\nIf Woods burns one of his picks on himself that leaves him the difficulty of choosing three players from the likes US Open champion, Gary Woodland, Tony Finau, Rickie Fowler, Kevin Kisner and Jordan Spieth, who showed a return to form at the CJ Cup in Korea which ended Sunday.\n\nAll except newlywed Fowler, who is on honeymoon, are playing in Asia over the next two weeks. Woods has to nominate his side directly after next week\u2019s WGC-HSBC Champions in Shanghai.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been able to communicate with all the eight (already qualified) guys who they want on the team and who they think that will fit on the team,\u201d he said.\n\nWoods also reiterated he wanted to come back to Japan next year to represent the US at the 2020 Olympics.\n\n\u201cI would love to play in an Olympic Games,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOver the years, having friends compete in the Olympics, seeing golf be part of the Olympics, it would be an honour to represent my country in an Olympic Games.\n\n\u201cHopefully next year I can have a good year and qualify.\u201d\n\nBefore all that, however, he was taking part in a Skins Challenge on Monday afternoon against Rory McIlroy, Jason Day and Hideki Matsuyama to kick off Zozo Championship week.", "description": "Narashino (Japan) (AFP) \u2013 Tiger Woods said Monday his fitness was ahead of schedule after arthroscopic knee surgery, and dropped a heavy clue he", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/defd66_happy-healthy-tiger-woods-attends-press-conference-pga-tour-zozo-championships-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
