Each time McDonald's have tried to downplay the numbers involved,' a spokesman for Bakers Union told The Sun.\n\nThe hard left Bakers Union is backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn\n\nThey added: 'McDonald's claim they offer all staff guaranteed hours. Many workers have never been offered that, you have to qualify for it, and it's still at the manager's discretion.\n\n'They are using it a smokescreen to cover up for the fact workers don't have the hours they need to put food on the table.'\n\nA McDonald's spokesman said: 'We are extremely disappointed that a very small number of our people in just a handful of our restaurants are considering industrial action.\n\n'It is encouraging that there has been a steady decrease in the already small numbers of our people previously balloted.'\n\nThe spokesman added that employees chose to remain on flexible contracts because they value 'the ability to work their shifts around their lives'.\n\n'We remain committed to our people and value the contribution they make to our organisation, and would like to reassure them, and our customers, that the six restaurants will remain open if industrial action takes place.'\n\nIn October 2018, when activity was last planned, no restaurant staff took part in the action, according to the McDonald's spokesman.", "description": "The hard left Bakers Union, backed by Jeremy Corbyn, announced the 'Mcstrike' for November 12 with demands including pay of \u00a315 per hour - \u00a33.70 more than the starting salary of police.", "authors": ["Emily Webber For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/00/20201812-0-image-a-7_1572045859209.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
