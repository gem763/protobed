They make up the fourth-largest ethnic group in the Middle East, but they have never obtained a permanent nation state.\n\nWhere do they come from?\n\nThe Kurds are one of the indigenous peoples of the Mesopotamian plains and the highlands in what are now south-eastern Turkey, north-eastern Syria, northern Iraq, north-western Iran and south-western Armenia.\n\nToday, they form a distinctive community, united through race, culture and language, even though they have no standard dialect. They also adhere to a number of different religions and creeds, although the majority are Sunni Muslims.\n\nKurdistan: A State of Uncertainty\n\nWhy don't they have a state?\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Despite their long history, the Kurds have never achieved a permanent nation state\n\nIn the early 20th Century, many Kurds began to consider the creation of a homeland - generally referred to as \"Kurdistan\". After World War One and the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, the victorious Western allies made provision for a Kurdish state in the 1920 Treaty of Sevres.\n\nSuch hopes were dashed three years later, however, when the Treaty of Lausanne, which set the boundaries of modern Turkey, made no provision for a Kurdish state and left Kurds with minority status in their respective countries. Over the next 80 years, any move by Kurds to set up an independent state was brutally quashed.\n\nAiming to change the outcome of World War One\n\nWhy were Kurds at the forefront of the fight against IS?\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga fighters have been fighting IS militants in northern Iraq\n\nIn mid-2013, the jihadist group Islamic State (IS) turned its sights on three Kurdish enclaves that bordered territory under its control in northern Syria. It launched repeated attacks that until mid-2014 were repelled by the People's Protection Units (YPG) - the armed wing of the Syrian Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD).\n\nAn IS advance in northern Iraq in June 2014 also drew that country's Kurds into the conflict. The government of Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan Region sent its Peshmerga forces to areas abandoned by the Iraqi army.\n\nIn August 2014, the jihadists launched a surprise offensive and the Peshmerga withdrew from several areas. A number of towns inhabited by religious minorities fell, notably Sinjar, where IS militants killed or captured thousands of Yazidis.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Turkish military personnel did not intervene in the battle for Kobane\n\nIn response, a US-led multinational coalition launched air strikes in northern Iraq and sent military advisers to help the Peshmerga. The YPG and the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey for three decades and has bases in Iraq, also came to their aid.\n\nIn September 2014, IS launched an assault on the enclave around the northern Syrian Kurdish town of Kobane, forcing tens of thousands of people to flee across the nearby Turkish border. Despite the proximity of the fighting, Turkey refused to attack IS positions or allow Turkish Kurds to cross to defend it.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Kurds accused Turkish authorities of complicity after a 2015 suicide bombing in Suruc\n\nIn January 2015, after a battle that left at least 1,600 people dead, Kurdish forces regained control of Kobane.\n\nThe Kurds - fighting alongside several local Arab militias under the banner of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) alliance, and helped by US-led coalition air strikes, weapons and advisers - then steadily drove IS out of tens of thousands of square kilometres of territory in north-eastern Syria and established control over a large stretch of the border with Turkey.\n\nIn October 2017, SDF fighters captured the de facto IS capital of Raqqa and then advanced south-eastwards into the neighbouring province of Deir al-Zour - the jihadists' last major foothold in Syria.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) alliance captured the IS stronghold of Raqqa\n\nThe last pocket of territory held by IS in Syria - around the village of Baghouz - fell to the SDF in March 2019. The SDF hailed the \"total elimination\" of the IS \"caliphate\", but it warned that jihadist sleeper cells remained \"a great threat\" to the world.\n\nThe SDF was also left to deal with the thousands of suspected IS militants captured during the last two years of the battle, as well as tens of thousands of displaced women and children associated with IS fighters. The US called for the repatriation of foreign nationals among them, but most of their home countries refused to do so.\n\nNow, the Kurds face a military offensive by Turkey, which wants to set up a 32km (20-mile) deep \"safe zone\" inside north-eastern Syria to protect its border and resettle up to 2 million Syrian refugees. The SDF says it will defend its territory \"at all costs\" and that hard-won gains in the battle against IS are being put at risk.\n\nThe Syrian government, which is backed by Russia, also continues to promise to take back control of all of Syria.\n\nWhat has Kobane battle taught us?\n\nRaqqa: The city fit for no-one\n\nWhy does Turkey see Kurds as a threat?\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan has been imprisoned by Turkey since 1999\n\nThere is deep-seated hostility between the Turkish state and the country's Kurds, who constitute 15% to 20% of the population.\n\nKurds received harsh treatment at the hands of the Turkish authorities for generations. In response to uprisings in the 1920s and 1930s, many Kurds were resettled, Kurdish names and costumes were banned, the use of the Kurdish language was restricted, and even the existence of a Kurdish ethnic identity was denied, with people designated \"Mountain Turks\".\n\nIn 1978, Abdullah Ocalan established the PKK, which called for an independent state within Turkey. Six years later, the group began an armed struggle. Since then, more than 40,000 people have been killed and hundreds of thousands displaced.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption More than 40,000 people have been killed since the PKK launched an armed struggle in 1984\n\nIn the 1990s the PKK rolled back on its demand for independence, calling instead for greater cultural and political autonomy, but continued to fight. In 2013, a ceasefire was agreed after secret talks were held.\n\nThe ceasefire collapsed in July 2015, after a suicide bombing blamed on IS killed 33 young activists in the mainly Kurdish town of Suruc, near the Syrian border. The PKK accused the authorities of complicity and attacked Turkish soldiers and police. The Turkish government subsequently launched what it called a \"synchronised war on terror\" against the PKK and IS.\n\nSince then, several thousand people - including hundreds of civilians - have been killed in clashes in south-eastern Turkey.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption The city of Cizre was devastated by fighting between Turkish forces and the PKK\n\nTurkey has maintained a military presence in northern Syria since August 2016, when it sent troops and tanks over the border to support a Syrian rebel offensive against IS. Those forces captured the key border town of Jarablus, preventing the YPG-led SDF from seizing the territory itself and linking up with the Kurdish enclave of Afrin to the west.\n\nIn 2018, Turkish troops and allied Syrian rebels launched an operation to expel YPG fighters from Afrin. Dozens of civilians were killed and tens of thousands displaced.\n\nTurkey's government says the YPG and the PYD are extensions of the PKK, share its goal of secession through armed struggle, and are terrorist organisations that must be eliminated.\n\nTurkey's fear of a reignited Kurdish flame\n\nProfile: The PKK\n\nWhat do Syria's Kurds want?\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption The Democratic Union Party (PYD) is the dominant force in Syria's Kurdish regions\n\nKurds make up between 7% and 10% of Syria's population. Before the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad began in 2011 most lived in the cities of Damascus and Aleppo, and in three, non-contiguous areas around Kobane, Afrin, and the north-eastern city of Qamishli.\n\nSyria's Kurds have long been suppressed and denied basic rights. Some 300,000 have been denied citizenship since the 1960s, and Kurdish land has been confiscated and redistributed to Arabs in an attempt to \"Arabize\" Kurdish regions.\n\nWhen the uprising evolved into a civil war, the main Kurdish parties publicly avoided taking sides. In mid-2012, government forces withdrew to concentrate on fighting the rebels elsewhere, and Kurdish groups took control in their wake.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption The YPG has emerged as a key ally of the US-led coalition battle against IS\n\nIn January 2014, Kurdish parties - including the dominant Democratic Union Party (PYD) - declared the creation of \"autonomous administrations\" in the three \"cantons\" of Afrin, Kobane and Jazira.\n\nIn March 2016, they announced the establishment of a \"federal system\" that included mainly Arab and Turkmen areas captured from IS.\n\nThe declaration was rejected by the Syrian government, the Syrian opposition, Turkey and the US.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption The creation of a federal system in Kurdish-controlled northern Syria was announced in 2016\n\nThe PYD says it is not seeking independence, but insists that any political settlement to end the conflict in Syria must include legal guarantees for Kurdish rights and recognition of Kurdish autonomy.\n\nPresident Assad has vowed to retake \"every inch\" of Syrian territory, whether by negotiations or military force. His government has also rejected Kurdish demands for autonomy, saying that \"nobody in Syria accepts talk about independent entities or federalism\".\n\nWill Iraq's Kurds gain independence?\n\nImage copyright Hulton Archive Image caption A peace deal agreed by the KDP and Iraq's government in 1970 collapsed four years later\n\nKurds make up an estimated 15% to 20% of Iraq's population. They have historically enjoyed more national rights than Kurds living in neighbouring states, but also faced brutal repression.\n\nIn 1946, Mustafa Barzani formed the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) to fight for autonomy in Iraq. But it was not until 1961 that he launched a full armed struggle.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Some 1.5 million Iraqi Kurds fled into Iran and Turkey after the 1991 rebellion was crushed\n\nIn the late 1970s, the government began settling Arabs in areas with Kurdish majorities, particularly around the oil-rich city of Kirkuk, and forcibly relocating Kurds.\n\nThe policy was accelerated in the 1980s during the Iran-Iraq War, in which the Kurds backed the Islamic republic. In 1988, Saddam Hussein unleashed a campaign of vengeance on the Kurds that included the chemical attack on Halabja.\n\nWhen Iraq was defeated in the 1991 Gulf War, Barzani's son Massoud and Jalal Talabani of the rival Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) led a Kurdish rebellion. Its violent suppression prompted the US and its allies to impose a no-fly zone in the north that allowed Kurds to enjoy self-rule. The KDP and PUK agreed to share power, but tensions rose and a four-year war erupted between them in 1994.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Massoud Barzani's KDP and Jalal Talabani's PUK shared power after the fall of Saddam\n\nThe parties co-operated with the US-led invasion in 2003 that toppled Saddam and governed in coalition in the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), created two years later to administer Dohuk, Irbil and Sulaimaniya provinces.\n\nMassoud Barzani was appointed the region's president, while Jalal Talabani became Iraq's first non-Arab head of state.\n\nIn September 2017, a referendum on independence was held in both the Kurdistan Region and the disputed areas seized by the Peshmerga in 2014, including Kirkuk. The vote was opposed by the Iraqi central government, which insisted it was illegal.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption People in Kurdish-held areas decisively backed independence in a September 2017 referendum\n\nMore than 90% of the 3.3 million people who voted supported secession. KRG officials said the result gave them a mandate to start negotiations with Baghdad, but then Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi demanded that it be annulled.\n\nThe following month Iraqi pro-government forces retook the disputed territory held by the Kurds. The loss of Kirkuk and its oil revenue was a major blow to Kurdish aspirations for their own state.\n\nAfter his gamble backfired, Mr Barzani stepped down as the Kurdistan Region's president. But disagreements between the main parties meant the post remained vacant until June 2019, when he was succeeded by his nephew Nechirvan.\n\nIraqi Kurdistan: State-in-the-making?\n\nIraqi Kurdistan profile", "description": "Kurds make up the Middle East's fourth-largest ethnic group, but they have never obtained statehood.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/150ED/production/_98535268_gettyimages-51348574.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
