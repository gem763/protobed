Those officials requested anonymity to discuss private conversations about the internal atmosphere at the agencies, and to avoid retaliation.\n\nIt is possible that additional whistleblowers will come forward to pile on evidence that President Trump is committing crimes, making the original Ukraine whistleblower the impetus for a watershed moment that will topple Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nOne former intelligence officer who also served on the National Security Council told Yahoo News that a CIA analyst, in some ways, makes for the perfect whistleblower: someone familiar with a \u201cset of constraints\u201d that, once \u201cviolated,\u201d inspires that person to speak out.\n\n\u201cPeople in the intel community really do believe in the rule of law [and] will stand up if they see something egregious,\u201d said another former senior intelligence official.\n\nHowever, for the average analyst, the president\u2019s general proclivity towards ignoring expert advice and criticizing civil servants is well established. The secretive society of the nation\u2019s intelligence employees, while certainly not a monolith or united in matters of opinion, has largely managed to insulate itself from many of the daily challenges of working within or alongside an unstable White House.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never once seen a dramatic shift in how the [intelligence community] does their jobs,\u201d said one national security official who requested anonymity to discuss interactions with intelligence officers. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of resignation. ... It\u2019s no secret ... that Trump doesn\u2019t listen to their advice,\u201d but \u201cthese guys are pros,\u201d continued the official.\n\nOne former official who recently met with current intelligence officers said that \u201cwhile they talked about how nuts it was\u201d to be serving amid one of the most tumultuous periods of Trump\u2019s presidency to date, \u201cthey mostly were focused on it being promotion season.\u201d\n\nAnother former official who recently attended meetings at different intelligence agencies said it was almost \u201cweird\u201d how \u201cpeople were just going about their business,\u201d they continued. \u201cSome of the higher-ups are retiring sooner than planned, but nothing drastic.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone respects the whistleblower but people are doing their jobs regardless,\u201d said another national security expert with ties to the intelligence community.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a blend of \u2018Here we go again\u2019 and \u2018I guess at least they are taking baby steps towards resolving this\u2019,\u201d added a former foreign intelligence officer, who argued there likely wouldn\u2019t be a mass defection from the government unless the president ordered the intelligence agencies to investigate Biden or \u201crenewed his insane calls to do torture.\u201d\n\nWhile there is always a certain amount of anxiety and frustration associated with the president\u2019s negative comments about the intelligence community, including comparing them to Nazis or threatening to revoke opponents\u2019 security clearances, like Trump did with former CIA Director John Brennan, the agencies\u2019 leadership has worked hard over the last several years to keep their business off the front page of the newspapers.", "description": "While two intelligence officers have taken the rare step of formally reporting concerns about President Trump\u2019s activities, others employed throughout the government\u2019s intelligence community are putting their heads down and hope to stay out of the political fray.", "authors": ["Jenna Mclaughlin", "National Security", "Investigations Reporter"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/wahMb_bThoj.wlz38kuBdg--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/392462d0-ea2b-11e9-bfff-6eda335636e8", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
