Now I'm like, 'Come on, I'm at the airport, no job right now, no ring -- and things are looking real bleak for me at the moment.'\"\n\nHe returned to the Hyatt Place hotel but couldn't find the ring, WGRZ-TV reported.\n\nBut that's when things turned: He soon received a text message from the Ravens that they were signing him to its practice squad and that a housekeeper had found the ring in the hotel room's kitchen area.\n\nThe team picked up the ring and overnighted it to Harris in time for him to pop the question, to which Marinelli said yes.\n\nTOM BRADY 'SETTING UP TO MOVE ON' FROM PATRIOTS, NFL INSIDER THEORIZES\n\n\"I was more concerned about the ring than my job.
