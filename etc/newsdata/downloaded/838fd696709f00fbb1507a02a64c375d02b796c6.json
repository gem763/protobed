The award categories include best children or young adult book, book of the year, digital book of the year, best manga and best European book.\n\nLaura Dean Keeps Breaking Up With Me is about a high school student named Freddy and her frustrating on-again, off-again relationship with a popular girl named Laura Dean.\n\n\"I didn't want it to just be a story where the goal is just to find love and love is achieved,\" said Tamaki in an June 2019 interview with CBC Books.\n\n\"When I was a younger person, especially a queer younger person, all I wanted were stories about relationships. But a lot of the love stories I read were about people looking for the perfect person and finding that person. I didn't see that experience of being with the wrong person.\"\n\nIt was recently announced in the New York Times that Tamaki will be launching a new books imprint, Surely Books, which will focus on publishing comics by queer creators.\n\nTamaki's other books include the acclaimed graphic novels Skim and This One Summer.\n\nTamaki has also worked on series for Marvel and DC like She-Hulk and Supergirl.\n\nOriginally from Toronto, Tamaki now lives in California.\n\nValero-O'Connell is an American illustrator who has worked on the popular series Lumberjanes, as well as comics for DC.\n\nThe other 2019 Harvey Award winners were:\n\nBook of the year: Hey Kiddo by Jarrett J.
