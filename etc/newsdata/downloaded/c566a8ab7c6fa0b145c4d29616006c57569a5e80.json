I met him on a handful of occasions, used to give him a cigarette or have a chat with him.\n\n\"He was a likable enough guy. I think he was more harmful to himself that anyone else.\n\n\"In terms of street drinking hierarchy, he was near the bottom, he was very vulnerable. And very apt at being bullied by others on the streets.\"\n\nAt an early age, after her parents separated, Thorpe became the main carer for her father.\n\nBrian said: \"Lorraine was never given the opportunity to have a childhood. She became Des\u2019s carer at a very, very young age.\"\n\nHe describes Paul as a \"very dangerous individual\" - and crucially he had Thorpe under his spell.\n\nRetired Det Chf Insp of Suffolk Police, Rick Munns, said while he was certain Thorpe and Clarke were responsible for Rosalyn's death, that he was certain others were involved too.\n\nHe explained: \"We know from the evidence that we obtained from witnesses that the group in and around Rosalind\u2019s flat would\u2019ve consisted, obviously, of Rosalyn, Paul Clarke, Lorraine Thorpe, Des Thorpe, Lorraine\u2019s father, very often a man called John Grimwood who was part of the group.\n\n\"He was certainly present in and around the two addresses and at varying times over the days running up to when we believe Rosalind was killed and some of the witnesses certainly gave evidence of him committing physical assaults against Rosalind at that time.\"\n\nThe three stood trial for murder. Thorpe, who became Britain's youngest double murderer, was jailed for 14 years while Clarke was sentenced to 27.\n\nBut Grimwood was cleared and soon drifted back into street drinking.\n\nHis girlfriend was Alison Studd, who had a history of drink and drug problems, and many in the street drinking community had heard about his involvement in the earlier murders.\n\nAlison was also regularly seen with black eyes and split lips but refused to leave the increasingly violent Grimwood.\n\nThen in January, 2001, Carrie Talbot was chatting to Alison close to the Odeon cinema in Ipswich.\n\nGrimwood approached her and asked her to walk round the corner with him - she said now and started to walk off.\n\nThe next thing Carrie felt was Grimwood 'punching' her in the back, she asked him why and he punched her a few more times.\n\nCarrie said: \"A friend of mine who was sat up at the Odeon said, 'Carrie, run! He\u2019s not punching you, he\u2019s stabbing you'.\"\n\nShe had been repeatedly knifed and was bleeding heavily.\n\nCarrie said: \"I had so much running through my head. I was scared, I didn\u2019t know what was going on, I didn\u2019t know why he had done it.\n\n\"I couldn\u2019t make sense of what had just happened. I knew I had to get away. I ran past a few shops. I don\u2019t know why but Argos just seemed the obvious shop to go to.\n\nSo that\u2019s where I came to. Told them that I thought I\u2019d been stabbed. I was like, 'Can you call me an ambulance, I think I\u2019ve been stabbed'.\n\n\"And at the time I didn\u2019t actually realise how bad it was.\"\n\nShe was rushed to hospital and straight into intensive care - but that wasn't the only admission at the hands of Grimwood.\n\nAlison was dead, killed by her partner, who had crawled along the floor and into the kitchen to slash her under the knee.\n\nHe had hit a main artery and she bled to death.\n\nBefore his violent attack the couple had rowed about tobacco.\n\nGrimwood denied killing his partner but was found guilty and jailed for at least 20 years.\n\nCarrie said: \"Nobody could understand why he ever got released. I still have nightmares about John. He is just pure evil.\"", "description": "John Grimwood stood trial for a brutal murder but was cleared before going on the kill his own girlfriend", "authors": ["Jane Lavender", "Image", "Police Pic", "Albanpix Rex Shutterstock"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20531235.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0__53942491_01johngrimwood280611.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
