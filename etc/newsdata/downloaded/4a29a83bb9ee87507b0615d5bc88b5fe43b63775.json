After all, who could argue with buying companies that are cheap relative to underlying fundamentals like earnings, sales and dividends?\n\nWell, after a decade\u2019s worth of underperformance, even the most diehard value investor is asking whether the strategy is obsolete in an era of relentlessly growing technology platform companies like Facebook (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), Netflix (NASDAQ: ) and Google (NASDAQ: ).\n\nWhile it\u2019s a bit beyond our typical traders\u2019 timeframe, we would note that similar periods of extended value underperformance have eventually led to dramatic reversals back in favor of cheap stocks. After trailing the in the peak of the tech boom from 1996 to 1999 (to say nothing about the more dramatic moves in the high-flying ), Warren Buffett\u2019s value-focused Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: ) went on to outperform the index by nearly 25% per year from 2000-2002.\n\nThis week\u2019s price action suggests that we may be nearing a similar \u201cchanging of the guard\u201d back toward value stocks.

As of writing, growth stocks (IWF) have underperformed value stocks (IWD) by 2.8% this week alone. If it holds through the rest of the trading day, this would mark the biggest shift in favor of value stocks since the Great Financial Crisis in 2009!\n\nOf course, we\u2019ve similar one-week \u201cgrowth panics\u201d do little to deter the long-term trend in favor of growth, but at a minimum, this week\u2019s drop should serve as a reminder that growth doesn\u2019t always outperform value, and could lead to more two-way trade moving forward.\n\nThis week\u2019s price action suggests that we may be nearing a similar \u201cchanging of the guard\u201d back toward value stocks.
