But the donations Sheikh Mohammed Al Rahbani tried to send to Obama\u2019s inaugural committee were funneled through a seasoned straw donor, the records and the AP analysis show.\n\nThat intermediary, Imaad Zuberi, agreed this month to plead guilty to making illegal campaign contributions to several American political candidates on behalf of foreign nationals. He is also set to plead guilty to concealing his work as a foreign agent as he lobbied high-level U.S. government officials.\n\nThe prosecution by the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles is the latest in a string of cases that highlight the prevalence of banned foreign money in American politics and the often lax approach campaigns take in vetting contributions.\n\nZuberi, a jet-setting fundraiser and venture capitalist, has raised millions of dollars for Democrats and Republicans alike over the years. Prosecutors say he has worked on behalf of several foreigners, not just Rahbani.\n\nHe served as a top fundraiser for both Obama and Hillary Clinton during their presidential runs, including stints on both of their campaign finance committees, before switching his support to President Donald Trump immediately after his 2016 victory, pumping nearly $1 million into the Republican\u2019s inaugural committee.\n\nFederal Election Commission records show hundreds of donations from Zuberi and his family to Republican and Democratic national committees, the presidential campaigns of Trump and Clinton, and dozens of congressional candidates across the political spectrum. Zuberi-linked donations often went to lawmakers who are influential or outspoken on foreign policy issues, like Sen. Lindsey Graham and Democratic Rep. Eliot Engel, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\n\nOnly Zuberi has been charged in the case, and prosecutors have not alleged that any campaign that received money from him was aware that at least some of his donations were financed by foreigners.\n\nZuberi\u2019s case raises questions about the degree to which political committees vet donors. One campaign, not identified by name, accepted donations made in the name of one of Zuberi\u2019s dead relatives, prosecutors said. Another political committee took donations from a person Zuberi invented.\n\nSome donations reported by political campaigns were made in Rahbani\u2019s and others\u2019 names but were paid for with credit cards belonging to Zuberi or his wife, prosecutors said.\n\nRequests for comment were sent to representatives for Graham, Clinton and Engel.\n\nSteve Kerrigan, CEO of Obama\u2019s 2013 inauguration committee, said it had a very thorough vetting process that included requiring donors to certify that their contributions complied with the law. He declined to comment further on the specifics of Zuberi\u2019s donations.\n\nAs a middleman, Zuberi was deeply flawed.\n\nZuberi, 49, admitted in a plea agreement that only $97,500 of the $850,000 that he was supposed to deliver to the Obama inaugural committee on Rahbani\u2019s behalf actually made it into the committee\u2019s hands. The rest, he skimmed for himself.\n\nRahbani declined to comment through an assistant. Zuberi\u2019s attorneys and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Los Angeles all declined to comment.\n\nThe case shares similarities with others recently filed against people accused of channeling banned foreign donations to U.S. candidates.\n\nTwo associates of Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, pleaded not guilty Wednesday to federal charges they used foreign money to make unlawful campaign contributions to several U.S. candidates and committees.\n\nProsecutors said the donations orchestrated by Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman included a $325,000 contribution to a group supporting Trump\u2019s reelection, made at a time when the pair were lobbying U.S. politicians to oust the country\u2019s ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nIn April, a Washington political consultant was sentenced to three years of probation after admitting he made a $50,000 straw donation on behalf of a wealthy Ukrainian client who wanted tickets to Trump\u2019s inauguration. Like Zuberi, W. Samuel Patten also was charged with to failing to register as a foreign lobbyist.\n\nThe FEC earlier this year fined a super PAC that supported Jeb Bush\u2019s failed 2016 Republican presidential bid for accepting $1.3 million in illegal donations from Chinese nationals.\n\nZuberi has also been under scrutiny by federal prosecutors in New York after he donated $900,000 to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee and $100,000 to a Republican campaign committee. Those donations occurred around the time Zuberi accompanied Qatar\u2019s foreign minister to a meeting at Trump Tower.\n\nTrump\u2019s inaugural committee has not been accused of wrongdoing in connection with the money it received from Zuberi. It says it has cooperated with the federal inquiry.\n\nRahbani is named in the charging documents in Zuberi\u2019s case only as \u201cPerson A,\u201d but the AP was able to identify him through biographical details in the court filing and by matching the timing and amounts of donations mentioned in the court filing to publicly available campaign finance records.\n\nFor instance, prosecutors in court filings said \u201cPerson A\u201d and his wife made four donations of $2,700 to \u201cCampaign J\u201d on Sept. 28, 2016, while one of Rahbani\u2019s business associates donated $400 to the same campaign on that date.\n\nFEC records indicate that Rahbani, his wife, Kate Rahbani, and one of Rahbani\u2019s business associates made donations in those amounts on that date to Graham\u2019s Senate campaign. Those donations, unlike others in the case, were listed in the FEC records with the Rahbanis\u2019 names and address in London. Graham\u2019s campaign returned some of those donations in 2017, and when doing so listed them as going to Zuberi\u2019s address, FEC records show.\n\nThose are just a few of several donations mentioned by prosecutors that the AP was able to match with public campaign records that listed Rahbani and people associated as the donors.\n\nProsecutors also described Person A as having dual citizenship in Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom, a residence in Switzerland and an American wife. In media profiles, Rahbani has talked about owning homes in London and Switzerland. His wife is an American.\n\nThe criminal case against Zuberi doesn\u2019t explain why Rahbani would have wanted to contribute to American political campaigns.\n\nHis company SAFID \u2014 a manufacturer of air conditioning-related products \u2014 is active throughout the Middle East and says on its website that it has worked on projects financed by the Saudi government.\n\nRahbani, in a few past interviews, has talked about his support of Obama. He posted pictures on his website of himself and his wife standing with Obama, former Vice President Joe Biden and their spouses at a 2013 inaugural event. The website was taken down shortly after Zuberi\u2019s plea was made public.\n\nProsecutors said $100,000 from Rahbani\u2019s company meant for the inaugural committee was earmarked for \u201cphotos.\u201d\n\nIt isn\u2019t unusual for political fundraisers to offer photo sessions with candidates in exchange for donations and such practices are legal \u2014 although the ban on donations from foreign nationals would apply.\n\nZuberi, however, tried to get Rahbani and one of his business associates to donate even more money by falsely claiming they had taken too many people to a photo session with Obama and Biden and owed more money as a result, prosecutors said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m deeply concerned about foreigners trying to intervene in our elections, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re doing enough to try to stop it,\u201d FEC chairwoman Ellen Weintraub told the AP. \u201cThey don\u2019t get a say in who we elect \u2014 or at least they\u2019re not supposed to.\u201d\n\n___\n\nSuderman reported from Richmond, Virginia.
