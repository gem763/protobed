Rice yields in 80 percent of Japan have declined due to the rising temperatures. . . . In nearby Murfreesboro, Tenn., we\u2019ll see a quarter decline in soybean yields within the next 30 years.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGore spent the better part of 90 minutes detailing the pressures of drought, heat, flooding, superstorms, \u201crain bombs,\u201d invasive insects, fungi and bacterial blight on food producers. \u201cWe may be approaching a threshold beyond which the agriculture that we\u2019ve always known cannot support human civilization as we know it,\u201d he declared in a low growl. \u201cThat\u2019s something we need to avoid.\u201d\n\nAlice Waters, who Gore said catalyzed his interest in food and who had volunteered to cook the vegetarian lunches served to attendees (using local, seasonal and organic ingredients, natch), said the presentation was bittersweet: \u201cI am deeply depressed. But on the other hand, the solution seems so, so unbelievably transformational. . . . We can restore the health of the planet while also restoring the health of people and communities.\u201d\n\nNaomi Starkman, editor-in-chief of \u00adCivil Eats, which covers news on sustainable agriculture, was similarly fraught: \u201cGore spoke with such devastating and fierce clarity, connecting the dots between the ways agriculture is implicated in and impacted by the climate crisis. But it also felt like a hopeful moment wherein agriculture, and farmers in particular, are taking a front-and-central place in solving one of the most urgent issues of our time.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMark Bittman, the former New York Times food columnist, was more circumspect: \u201cThere are ways in which the conversation here isn\u2019t quite realistic. Regenerative agriculture is not about increased yield, it\u2019s about producing more of the right food in the right ways. ... But kudos to Al Gore for taking it on. There\u2019s no more important conversation to have.\u201d\n\nI sat down with the former vice president to dive deeper into the details. Edited excerpts of our conversation follow:\n\nQ: The main way most humans will experience climate change is through its impact on food: Is this a fair statement?\n\nA: Ever since 2015, it\u2019s been clear that the impact on the food system was underestimated in previous years. And there is a natural resistance that many of us have had to getting too concerned about the food system. Food insecurity had been declining steadily for the last couple of decades, just as extreme poverty had been declining. But in the last couple of years, that too has changed, and the principal reason is the climate crisis.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfrica, by mid-century, will have more people than either China or India. And by end of century, more people than China and India combined. And you combine that with the impact of the climate crisis on subsistence agriculture in Africa, the importance of subsistence agriculture in Africa, the poor quality of the soils, the persistent problems of land tenure, and the economic and social structures that discourage good stewardship of the land, then, wow. We really need to wake up quickly to the serious crisis that could develop there.\n\nQ: What are the most crucial policy measures that need to be taken to encourage regenerative farming in the U.S. and climate-smart agriculture broadly?\n\nA: We need leadership to completely refocus USDA to completely change the system of farm subsidies to stop the massive subsidies for crops that are not eaten by people, that go to bio\u00adfuels, that go to animal feed. We should eventually work our way toward a system for compensating farmers for the buildup of soil carbon. That\u2019s not possible yet, partly because we are still developing a measurement of soil carbon buildup that is necessary for the confidence of policymakers and voters that this is not some boondoggle. But eventually, that\u2019s where we need to be.\n\nQ: On one hand you have Bill Gates saying, \u201cThe time has come to reinvent food,\u201d and on the other you have Alice Waters and others saying, \u201cLet\u2019s de-invent food, let\u2019s go back to preindustrial agriculture,\u201d essentially. What do you think the role of tech should be?\n\nA: We want a single, magic answer that\u2019s going to solve a big, complicated problem, and I think that in agriculture and food and climate, these systemic approaches are usually more likely to be successful. But technology and science has an important role to play. Measuring soil carbon is one. That team at the Salk Institute has a really interesting proposal to modify roots to sequester more suberin, a form of carbon that stays in the soil for a long time. If their hypothesis is correct, the root structures of food plants can be made much more robust in a way that simultaneously sequesters more organic carbon and increases yields. So that\u2019s technology that is worth exploring and evaluating.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn general, the solutions in agriculture are more to be found in going back to some traditional approaches that worked but were discarded because of the pressure for short-term profit maximization. And that includes crop rotation. It includes cover crops to put key chemicals and nutrients back in the soil after it\u2019s been used for a particular cash crop. It includes rotational grazing, which is not without controversy but has been proven to work, at least on farms of this scale.\n\nQ: What role must consumers play in the shift toward sustainable food systems and climate resilience?\n\nA: There\u2019s a danger in focusing on consumer behavior. There\u2019s a danger of giving the impression that the solutions to the climate crisis have to be shouldered by women and men who care enough about it to change their personal choices. They do. But as important as it is to change a lightbulb, it is way more important to change policies. And in order to change policies, we have to have new policymakers. So the most important role that individuals can play is in taking their concern and passion for a better world into the voting booth and turning out in large numbers to overcome the dominance of our political system by big money.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nQ: Some permaculture and regenerative farmers that I met with have said that it\u2019s more expensive to farm this way. They can\u2019t afford their own products. How do we address that?\n\nA: I don\u2019t want to deny the premise of your question, but some regenerative farmers have saved a lot of money on their input costs. Now, how do we develop markets for healthier, organic, regenerative-agriculture food? That\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019re incorporating efforts to get school systems and hospitals and nursing homes and long-term care facilities to provide markets for healthier food.\n\nQ: Still, there are real concerns from \u00admiddle- and low-income consumers that this is an elitist movement.\n\nA: It hasn\u2019t been very many years since solar panels were considered an elitist movement. And you heard exactly the same critique. \u201cFor those who can afford them, that\u2019s fine. But don\u2019t tell me that\u2019s going to be a significant development, because only the wealthy elite are doing it.\u201d Well, that\u2019s not true anymore, because that was the beginning of a movement that drove scale and accelerated the cost reduction curve. And now you\u2019ve got people putting rooftop solar on and community solar, and it is really taking off dramatically. But it started as an elitist movement. The same thing is beginning to be true of electric vehicles. If we can democratize and widely distribute the soil carbon assessment technologies, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that hard to imagine technology driving the cost down to the point where this can spread more rapidly.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nQ: The agriculture industry is so interesting because it is a major driver of the climate problem, but it is also more vulnerable than any other industry to the pressures of climate change.\n\nA: Many pioneers of regenerative agriculture are finding that their farms are more resilient to drought and flood and extreme weather than with the older established farming techniques. Building the health of the soil does not mean just more organic carbon. It also means building the ability of the soil to absorb the higher rainfall events and to withstand drought events more effectively.\n\nQ: One scientist said to me the most delicious fruits are dying because the specialist crops, the ones that we love the most, are hardest to adapt to new circumstances. Of all the crops that are most vulnerable, which would be the hardest for you to live without?\n\nA: Chocolate. Cacao. Absolutely.\n\nLittle is author of \u201cThe Fate of Food: What We\u2019ll Eat in a Bigger, Hotter, Smarter World\u201d (Harmony, 2019).\n\nMore from Food:\n\nAD", "description": "Q&A | At a conference at his family farm, he details the impacts \u2014 and talks about solutions", "authors": ["Amanda Little"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/jl1856b_5q2CfwLDggY52QjKy5g=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NINLEEXREUI6TCPL5RLM2QKHGI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
