We\u2019re not fresh out of college anymore.'", "description": "Prime subscribers who live in one of the more than 2,000 US delivery locations can request to be alerted to when they can start shopping with Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods Markets.", "authors": ["Ian Randall For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/13/20326552-0-image-a-53_1572356384796.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
