So what do shoppers think of the practice?\n\nStep into your local post office during your lunch break and you will see them: queues of shoppers, packages in hand, waiting to return items they have bought online. But not all of the clothes being returned to major retailers will be unworn. According to a survey, a fifth of shoppers admit to buying items with the intention of wearing them and then returning them. \u201cWardrobing\u201d is estimated to cost UK retailers \u00a31.5bn, and they are increasingly clamping down on the practice: earlier this year, the online retailer Asos announced it would blacklist serial returners. We took to the streets of London to find out how common wardrobing really is \u2013 and whether the retailers should be worried.\n\nMichael Howard, 49, gardener\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Michael Howard: \u2018We live in a wonderful free-market economy, don\u2019t we? Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian\n\nI never shop online personally; I like to go to shops and try things on. My wife sells clothes at Spitalfields market, and when you\u2019re a small retailer who only has one of each size in stock, wardrobing would be a nightmare. But I don\u2019t know about a ban on it. We live in a wonderful free-market economy, don\u2019t we? People wouldn\u2019t accept it. They\u2019d prefer to have someone out there being paid peanuts to make clothes and deliver them, without thinking too much about it.\n\nBruna Siofeather, 19, student\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bruna Siofeather: \u2018Sometimes you need to return it.\u2019 Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian\n\nI do the opposite. I buy things all the time and I can\u2019t be bothered to return them. Wardrobing isn\u2019t right anyway, so I wouldn\u2019t do it. It\u2019s not very nice. I feel sorry for the companies, but I don\u2019t think you should be banned from returning things if you do it too often. Sometimes you get stuff and you really don\u2019t like it, and you do need to return it. There are some brands now that put the tag on the outside so you can\u2019t wear things and take them back. Other brands should just do that.\n\nNatalie Galvau, 21, design student\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Natalie Galvau: \u2018I am trying to make more of an effort not to consume as much.\u2019 Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian\n\nLately I have tried to get into the habit of shopping on the app Depop, or doing charity shopping, because of how bad fast fashion is for the environment, so I don\u2019t wardrobe. I am trying to make more of a conscious effort not to consume as much, which is difficult because everything is so readily available on the internet. I don\u2019t think you should be banned from returning things. It would be an issue for me because I like to take things home and see how they look.\n\nOcean Lewis, 20, model\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ocean Lewis: \u2018I\u2019m too lazy to take things back.\u2019 Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian\n\nI have never done wardrobing, but I have friends who do. And stylists who I have worked with on shoots do it. They\u2019ll order clothes for the model to wear and then return them. But I\u2019m too lazy to take things back. I really am! Seriously, though, it doesn\u2019t seem right. People get their picture taken in the clothes, and then send them back. Imagine if everyone did that.\n\nMatt Hurst, 36, sales account manager\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Matt Hurst: \u2018I wouldn\u2019t want to receive something that had been worn by someone else.\u2019 Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian\n\nI\u2019ve heard of someone who does it \u2013 she even has a special gun to put the tags back on. She\u2019ll buy a nice dress for an event, wear it once, and then send it back. I have no idea where she got the gun from. I guess you could say she\u2019s a professional wardrober. I don\u2019t like the idea of people doing it, though. I wouldn\u2019t want to receive something that had been worn by someone else. I actually always check my clothes when I buy them, to check there are no signs of wear.\n\nTheo Hausler, 33, facilities manager\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Theo Hausler: \u2018Wardrobing must have a big carbon footprint; it\u2019s very wasteful.\u2019 Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian\n\nI don\u2019t do that. Maybe I\u2019m old-fashioned, but I like to buy my clothes and see that they fit and keep them for a good amount of time. Wardrobing must have a big carbon footprint: it\u2019s very wasteful. But I guess that\u2019s just the fashion industry in general. We have lost the worth of the actual labour behind what we buy. We never keep anything.
