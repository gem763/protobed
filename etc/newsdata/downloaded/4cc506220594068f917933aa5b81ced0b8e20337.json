We realized that it wasn\u2019t a joke only when we saw the security service inside the exhibition space at 9 am on Tuesday,\u201d they told HuffPost via email.\n\nHillary Clinton spent an hour yesterday reading her emails at my exhibition of all 62,000 pages of them in Venice. She is pictured here at a replica of the Oval Office Resolute Desk, stacked with her emails. pic.twitter.com/V8T27klycr \u2014 Kenneth Goldsmith (@kg_ubu) September 11, 2019\n\nGoldsmith\u2019s exhibition makes public \u201cfor the first time in printed format\u201d some 60,000 pages of Clinton\u2019s emails, which, per WikiLeaks, \u201cwere sent from the domain clintonemail.com between 2009 and 2013,\u201d according to the description from exhibit co-organizer Zuecca Projects.\n\nThen-candidate Donald Trump turned the emails, which were stored on a private server while Clinton was secretary of state, into rallying cry during the 2016 election.\n\nThe documents are being displayed in an environment that \u201cconverts in a lo-fi format some of the furnishings of the Oval Office in the White House,\u201d the description says.\n\n\u201cEverybody was very excited [during Clinton\u2019s visit],\u201d Urbano Ragazzi said. \u201cI think the scene was so extraordinary that many customers believed that she was just a lookalike at first.\u201d\n\nThe description explains that \u201cthe pile of papers is rather unimpressive, rebutting Trump\u2019s efforts to make them monumental.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn this way, Goldsmith creates an anti-monument to the folly of Trump\u2019s heinous smear campaign against Clinton,\u201d it concludes.\n\nThe artist shared on Twitter that Clinton read her emails for an hour and, per a translation from an Italian news outlet, said: \u201cThis exhibition is further proof that nothing wrong or controversial can be found on these emails. It makes them accessible to everyone and allows everyone to read them.\u201d\n\nHe also recalled Clinton saying, as an aside, to Urbano Ragazzi: \u201cThey are just so boring.\u201d\n\nGoldsmith told HuffPost that he \u201choped that she would see it as an act of tribute and love,\u201d which he believes she did.\n\nUrbano Ragazzi added that organizers wanted Clinton to \u201cunderstand the intentions\u201d of the project.\n\n\u201cIn the digital age, making these documents available to everyone in a touchable format is a way to focus on something concrete in order to exit the impalpable toxicity of ideological narratives,\u201d they said, before adding: \u201cThe exhibition is a way to allude to an alternative world that will never exist. We are happy that the real Hillary has been part of this image full of possibilities.\u201d\n\nThe exhibition, which began in May, runs until Nov. 24, 2019. It is curated by Francesco Urbano Ragazzi and organized by The Internet Saga and Zuecca Projects with collaboration and support from Circuitozero, The Bauers, NERO and Despar Aspiag Service.\n\nHuffPost has reached out to Clinton for further comment.", "description": "The 2016 Democratic nominee dropped by an art exhibit in Venice, Italy, featuring all 60,000 pages of the infamous emails: \"They are just so boring.\"", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d79405a230000580551428e.png?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
