An election is unlikely to send the pound plunging with the Conservatives ahead in the polls, strategists say, yet there is enough uncertainty around the result and the Brexit outcome that it also won\u2019t prompt a huge rally.\n\n\u201cThe most severe of the longer-term structural risks facing the U.K. -- a no-deal crash out -- have all but evaporated,\u201d said Ned Rumpeltin, European head of currency strategy at Toronto-Dominion Bank. \u201cThere is a lot of good news in the price, and the balance of headlines may not be as constructive once we head into an election cycle.\u201d\n\nThe pound is headed for its best month against the dollar since January 2018, with no-deal Brexit risk reduced after lawmakers voted to force Prime Minister Boris Johnson to seek an extension to the deadline. The likely election now looks set to become a proxy vote on European Union membership.\n\nThe pound rose 0.1% to $1.2878 on Tuesday, and climbed 0.2% to 86.16 pence per euro. The yield on U.K. 10-year government bonds held steady at 0.72%.\n\nWary Investors\n\nEven as polls suggest a Tory-led government is the most likely outcome, the market will be mindful of risks around Jeremy Corbyn. Investors have long been wary of a government led by the left-wing Labour leader, who is seen nationalizing parts of the economy, boosting borrowing and redistributing income.\n\nThere is also the question of how the two main parties position themselves on Brexit. If Labour opts to campaign on a platform of no Brexit or an arrangement where Britain maintains close ties with the EU, while the Conservatives go for a departure at any cost, volatility will likely pick up into the vote, according to Thu Lan Nguyen, a currency strategist at Commerzbank AG.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect a large market reaction in pound spot rates,\u201d said Nguyen. \u201cRather, I think we will see a repricing on options markets, factoring in an increased political risk around the date of the elections.\u201d\n\nOption pricing has been subdued in recent days, with implied volatility in the pound staying low in the shorter and longer term. This suggests traders foresee smaller jumps in the currency, reflecting optimism about the fading risk of no-deal, contained by pessimism caused by simmering political uncertainty.\n\nPersistent question marks over Brexit itself could also keep a lid on the pound. Traders may also shift their attention to the risk of the second phase of Brexit negotiations when Britain will have to decide its future relationship with the EU.\n\n\u201cThe capacity for sterling to enjoy a major relief rally that \u2018it\u2019s over\u2019 may be more constrained than others may think because, let\u2019s face it, it\u2019s not over,\u201d said Toronto-Dominion\u2019s Rumpeltin. \u201cNot by a long shot.\u201d\n\n(Adds options context, comments from Commerzbank, updates pricing.)\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Charlotte Ryan in London at cryan147@bloomberg.net;Anooja Debnath in London at adebnath@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Paul Dobson at pdobson2@bloomberg.net, William Shaw, Michael Hunter\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Sign up to our\u00a0Brexit\u00a0Bulletin, follow us @Brexit\u00a0and\u00a0subscribe to our podcast.Pound traders are unlikely to find that the promise of a December U.K. election provides an escape from the Brexit maze.The currency pared losses after the Labour Party backed government plans for an early poll", "authors": ["Charlotte Ryan", "Anooja Debnath"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/l1eZ5g_NW5LcMuR1bhevIQ--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/ffb0187369607a95a83844114be118c5", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
