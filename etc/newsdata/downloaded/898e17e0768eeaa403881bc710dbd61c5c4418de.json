REUTERS/Ivan Alvarado\n\nLIMA (Reuters) - Ecuadorean indigenous group Conaie said late on Saturday that it would continue anti-austerity protests after President Lenin Moreno imposed a military-enforced curfew in the capital Quito and the armed forces said they would restrict movement across the country.\n\nThe group suggested that its decision earlier in the day to hold direct talks with Moreno about a decree that cut fuel subsidies might be at risk by the military crackdown. Conaie has led protests against the law but has rejected vandalism that swept Quito on Saturday.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no real dialogue without guarantees for the safety of indigenous leaders,\u201d Conaie said in a statement on Twitter.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll carry out approaches to try to repeal the decree,\u201d it added, \u201cbut we will hold protest actions nationally..exhorting the government to provide necessary guarantees.\u201d\n\nIt did not specify when it would hold protests or if it would do so in defiance of the curfew. Moreno did not say when the curfew in Quito would end.", "description": "Ecuadorean indigenous group Conaie said late on Saturday that it would continue anti-austerity protests after President Lenin Moreno imposed a military-enforced curfew in the capital Quito and the armed forces said they would restrict movement across the country.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191013&t=2&i=1440241267&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9C03T", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
