Then he made a decision, just like the one the jury was called upon to make, the prosecutor said.\n\n\"He sentenced his kids to death,\" Hubbard said.\n\nIn a confession, Jones said he strangled 7-year-old Elias with his hands and chased down 8-year-old Merah before choking her. Her last words were reportedly, \"I love you, daddy.\"\n\nHe then used a belt to choke 2-year-old Gabriel and 1-year-old Abigail because he said his hands were too big.\n\nThat deserved death and not life, Hubbard said.\n\nThe defense focused on what Jones' lawyers called undiagnosed schizophrenia made worse by drug and alcohol use. Jurors last week rejected their arguments that Jones was not guilty by reason of insanity or guilty but mentally ill.\n\nDuring his closing argument, defense lawyer Casey Secor focused on how much Jones is loved by his family even after the killings. His grandmother, father and siblings all asked jurors to spare his life.\n\n\"How much more death does the Jones family have to endure? How many more funerals does this family have to go to? How many more tears do they have to shed? How much more heartache to they have to endure?\" Secor said.\n\nThe testimony was tragic. Jurors told the paper that they could hear each other \u201csobbing through the walls during the trial.\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHubbard said after the trial, \"No mercy was shown to the kids, but justice was done in this case.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report", "description": "At one point during the summer trial the resulted in a South Carolina father being sentenced to death for the brutal killing of his five children, a prosecutor reportedly showed jurors one of the dead children\u2019s favorite dolls that was ripped to shreds by his dad.", "authors": ["Edmund Demarche", "Edmund Demarche Is A News Editor For Foxnews.Com.
