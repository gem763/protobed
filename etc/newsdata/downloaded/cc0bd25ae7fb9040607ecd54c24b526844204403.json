Blasting operations are currently limited, since all blasting must be supervised by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (the \u201cArrangements\u201d). Presently the Arrangements are not sufficient for the desired level of operations. The Company has been working with the authorities to increase blasting availability to normal levels for an underground mine. Progress has been made and substantive investment made in accordance with recommendations, however, the Company is still awaiting final approvals from the authorities in order to be able to implement its increased blasting protocols. The Company has been waiting for some time for these approvals and although the Company expects to receive the approvals based on previous discussions with the relevant authorities, a date for receipt of the required approvals and therefore the date on which implementation of the increased blasting schedule is not yet known.\n\n\n\nThe current Arrangements are not sufficient to allow for the expansion of mine operations as envisaged by the Company\u2019s existing mine plan and until changes are agreed, the present inefficiencies caused by those Arrangements form an increasing financial burden, which has proved a significant drain on the financial resources of the Company.\n\nAccordingly, in order to reduce costs, while some mine operations will continue at the Omagh gold mine, consultation with the workforce is underway regarding a reduction in the numbers employed.\n\nIn light of the economic impingement on the Company\u2019s operations, the Company is beginning to seek strategic alternatives including reviewing its licenses and operations; and considering the possibility of engaging in a joint venture or other options with third parties and alternative financing structures. The Company expects it will have to raise funds within the next 6 months and will update the market in due course.\n\nOperational update\n\nSome two kilometres of underground drivages have been developed, with exposure of the main Kearney vein on four levels. A fifth level is near the point of intersection. The mine is serviced by a decline tunnel of 1 in 6 gradient, of dimensions approximately 4.5m by 4.5m. Recent vein intersections on the 1060 (fourth) level have proven to be strongly mineralized with vein sections some 3 metres wide and of grade mapped at over 10g/t gold.\n\nThe processing plant, which uses non-toxic flotation processing to provide a concentrate, is expected to continue to operate in the near term and is being fed from underground stock. The mine operates within regulated environmental constraints and has a zero lost time incident record.\n\nDetailed mapping has been made of the exposed mineralisation underground by in-house personnel. These studies are more intense than achievable by core-drilling because of the continuity of exposure. Zones of high grade mineralization have been identified linking adjacent levels. The reasons behind the emplacement of these zones is considered to now be identified. The implication is that such zones are expected to continue at depth, with enhanced exploration potential for targeting high grade gold resources particularly to the north and within the Company\u2019s license area.\n\nQualified Person\n\nThis disclosure has been reviewed by Roland Phelps C.Eng MIMMM (President & CEO, Galantas Gold Corporation), a qualified person under the meaning of National Instrument 43-101 and AIM rules.
