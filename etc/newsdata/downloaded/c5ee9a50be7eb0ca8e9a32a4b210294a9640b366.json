Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley execs gave us their pitch.\n\nMorgan Stanley plans to call its new feature \"Business Insights,\" Scott-Hansen said. Advisers already have access to various news services, he said, along with alerts from the firm's research group.\n\nScott-Hansen's plan for these \"quick insights\" underscores a broader trend in the wealth management industry. Big wirehouses are under pressure to upgrade legacy technology, particularly as new, low-cost roboadvisers up the game for what can be expected on the client-facing side from self-serve options.\n\nIn-house tech tools are also a key focus for the advisers themselves \u2014 in August, we talked to Paul Vienick, head of digital client platforms at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, who said that one of the first questions from prospective advisers is usually: \"What is your technology like?\"\n\nBut in general, banks also need to balance tech upgrades with managing overall costs.\n\nThe new feature's first elements will roll out during 2020. The wirehouse will also unveil new, client-facing, elements beyond the current reporting capabilities next year. Morgan Stanley did not detail what those changes would be.\n\nMorgan Stanley \u2014 which at the end of June had 15,633 advisers overseeing some $2.5 trillion in client assets \u2014 partners with the asset manager BlackRock and its Aladdin investment management technology to power Morgan Stanley's risk analytics.\n\nAladdin \u2014 short for Asset Liability and Debt and Derivative Investment Network \u2014 is software that BlackRock sells to investment managers to help them assess risks around client portfolios. Meanwhile, BlackRock's Aladdin Wealth gives wealth management firms a client-level risk perspective.\n\nBlackRock has seen wealth managers as an important pool of Aladdin users, and has been signing big managers around the world up to the wealth version of the platform. Wealth manager and investment bank UBS, HSBC, and others have also partnered with BlackRock on its Aladdin wealth technology.\n\nMorgan Stanley went live to with a new adviser platform for client portfolios in late 2018. Its capabilities include allowing the advisers to do things like run stress tests against client holdings and analyze various aspects like country and factor exposures.\n\nRead more: UBS Americas private-wealth head says he thinks losing a 'few hundred' advisers would not be a bad thing, and is looking at how robos can help keep the bank's richest clients\n\n\"Our risk analytics technology is now fully integrated into the adviser platform, allowing our advisers to provide real-time risk analytics in a way that no other provider can,\" Morgan Stanley chief financial officer Jonathan Pruzan said at an industry conference in New York last month, adding the firm has found it's acquired more client assets this way.\n\nThe tech gives advisers oversight into brokerage accounts, and helps flag potential risks for those clients, potentially building a case for transitioning into financial advice. Another aspect that can help drive business is the platform's ability to display all client assets, including what's held away from the bank.\n\nThe firm has also been adding to other ways to digitize adviser-client interactions. In late July, Morgan Stanley launched a digital document sharing tool for wealth management in partnership with cloud software company Box.\n\nOffering the best technology is now \"table stakes\" for holding onto assets and advisers alike, industry recruiters and executives have told Business Insider.\n\nAnd while many argue that there will be no full tech replacement for human advice and judgement, particularly when it comes to meeting the complex needs of the ultra-wealthy, the head of private banking at UBS told us in August that he's looking for ways for digital offerings to \"do more\" when it comes to the bank's richest clients.\n\nRead more: Morgan Stanley's wealth management arm is now the most profitable it's ever been.
