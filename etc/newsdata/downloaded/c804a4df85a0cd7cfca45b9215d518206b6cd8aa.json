Female players are still considered amateurs by Italian law and therefore are not permitted to earn more than 30,000 euros ($33,000) per year before taxes.\n\n\u201cThe difference is there and we all know it,\u201d Juventus forward Barbara Bonansea said this week when Italy\u2019s squad was awarded the Foreign Press Association\u2019s Invictus award for promoting and \u201cemancipating\u201d the female game in the country.\n\n\u201cBefore discussing earnings I would talk about our rights. I don\u2019t play because I want to earn as much as the men, also because that would not make sense, they earn so much I can\u2019t even wrap my mind around it. We just want what we deserve. That\u2019s what we\u2019re fighting for,\u201d added Bonansea, who is nearing an economics degree at the University of Turin. \u201cIf there\u2019s more coverage of our games and more sponsors come in, then we deserve more, too.\u201d\n\nThe Italian soccer federation and Vincenzo Spadafora, Italy\u2019s new Minister for Sport and Youth Policies, both support changing the 1981 law and making the women\u2019s league professional.\n\nStill, new legislation remains a long way off.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the minimum they deserve,\u201d Italian national team coach Milena Bertolini said. \u201cWe have an antiquated law. It\u2019s shameful. If we want to be a modern, democratic and open society . we need to be treated with dignity.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a similar situation in Spain, where players in the women\u2019s league decided to go on strike Wednesday after failing to reach a deal with clubs over working hours and minimum wages. Also, the U.S. women\u2019s team sued its federation in March - three months before winning the World Cup - alleging gender and pay discrimination.\n\nBonansea\u2019s two-goal performance in Italy\u2019s 2-1 comeback win over Australia got the ball rolling for the Azzurre at their first World Cup in two decades. She discussed the \u201cpyschological violence\u201d that she and other players faced growing up in a country where girls were not expected - or even allowed - to play soccer.\n\nBonansea began playing on her brother\u2019s team and didn\u2019t join a girls\u2019 squad until she was 13.\n\nThe 53-year-old Bertolini had to dress up as a boy to play as a kid.\n\n\u201cWhen I was 9 or 10 I had short hair and my teammates didn\u2019t even know whether I was a boy or a girl. So I played and everyone called me \u2018Mario\u2019 and nobody noticed,\u201d Bertolini said. \u201cThis caused a lot of (pain) which I had to bear for a long time.\u201d\n\nSexism remains embedded in the Italian game\u2019s terminology with coaches referred to as \u201cMister\u201d - a term left over from when the English introduced soccer to Italy at the end of the 19th century.\n\n\u201cI call (Bertolini) Mister,\u201d Bonansea said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of habit. But we can change it.\u201d\n\nThe word \u201cuomo\u201d - man - is used to announce when an opposing player is coming up from behind and in \u201cmarcatura a uomo\u201d - man-to-man defense.\n\n\u201cThe terminology we use on the field is copied completely from male soccer. Our soccer is still in its early stages but I think it\u2019s important that this should change,\u201d Bertolini said. \u201cThe word used most on the field is \u2018uomo.\u2019 And I don\u2019t like that.\u201d\n\nBut the women\u2019s players are changing perceptions in other ways.\n\nBonansea is the face of a Nike campaign aimed at young girls in Italy while Juventus and national team captain Sara Gama - the daughter of an Italian mother and a Congolese father - had a Barbie doll modeled after her.\n\nLast week, national team defender Elena Linari became the first prominent Italian soccer player - male or female - to publicly come out as gay.\n\n\u201cHere in Madrid I don\u2019t have any problems,\u201d said Linari, who plays for Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. \u201cWhereas in Italy, I\u2019m afraid to discuss the subject because I don\u2019t know what the reaction might be.\n\n\u201cMy grandmother\u2019s reaction was touching. She was happy for me but she was crying when she said she was afraid for me because we\u2019re not protected,\u201d Linari added to RAI.\n\nBertolini applauded Linari\u2019s announcement, noting the prejudice toward homosexuals in Italy.\n\n\u201cKids are afraid to express themselves,\u201d Bertolini said. \u201cShe was very courageous and now let\u2019s hope announcements like these help change the mentality here.\u201d\n\nMaking the women professionals would be a big improvement, too.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nAndrew Dampf on Twitter: www.twitter.com/AndrewDampf\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Italy's surprise run to the quarterfinals of the Women's World Cup this year went a long way toward changing misconceptions about the female game in a country where the most popular sport is dominated by men.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Andrew Dampf"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/24/italy_spotlight_women_not_pros_19199_c0-154-2175-1422_s1200x700.jpg?a5dd0abf76bd7ac104a3f7553dcccee85d6bb636", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
