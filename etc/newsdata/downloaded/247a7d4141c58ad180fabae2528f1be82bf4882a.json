Neighbourhood officers will be returning to several areas, including Vanier/Overbrook, Heron Gate and the south end, and Carlington/Caldwell. 0:48\n\nGloucester-South Nepean Coun. Carol Anne Meehan questioned Bell about what she should tell her constituents, who will be disappointed to be left out of the pilot.\n\nBell responded that they want to start small, but that people across the city will reap the benefits.\n\nWith a team of officers dedicated to proactive policing in the most challenging parts of the city, frontline officers will be able to put time into other areas, he said.\n\n\"Although there is a concentrated effort in certain neighbourhoods, there will be an increased availability of officers,\" he said.\n\n\"This is a net benefit to the entire community.\"\n\nImpact to be studied\n\nEight officers and one sergeant will be assigned to each of the target neighbourhoods.\n\nAt the urging of the community, many of the officers will be assigned for five-year terms to ensure there are familiar with their assigned areas.\n\n\"It's pretty crystal clear that we need the same faces, we need the same voices, we need the same contacts and relationships with the residents,\" said Insp. Ken Bryden, the lead on the pilot project.\n\nInsp. Ken Bryden is leading the pilot project to reinstate three community policing teams. (Laura Osman/CBC News)\n\nThe value of the new pilot project will be evaluated by a group of academics from Carleton University, who will report back next year.\n\nOne of the reasons community police took a hit was because the service wasn't able to demonstrate the positive benefits, Bryden told the board, and they hope this evaluation will change that.\n\nThe officers said the force hopes to expand the revamped community police model to other areas if money becomes available in future budgets.", "description": "The whole city will get a crime-fighting boost when new neighbourhood police officers are deployed to three key communities, interim Chief Steve Bell told the police services board Monday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5215985.1563414135!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/interim-chief-steve-bell-ottawa-police-july-17-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
