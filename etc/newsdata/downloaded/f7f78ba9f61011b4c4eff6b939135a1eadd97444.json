Nothing is made explicit here, but it starts to set new expectations about the coming course of policy for 2020.\u201d\n\nIn late 2017, Kim visited Mt Paektu days after North Korea launched its largest intercontinental ballistic missile, and weeks before he made a key New Year\u2019s speech in which he opened the door to engagement with South Korea.\n\nLast year, Kim took South Korean President Moon Jae-in to the top of the mountain as part of a historic summit.\n\nSince then relations have cooled and Kim has said he will only wait until the end of the year for the United States to soften its stance in denuclearisation negotiations before North Korea will pursue an unspecified new path forward.\n\nSeveral experts said much of the rhetoric in the KCNA report revolves around the economy, and they suspect North Korea may soon conduct a space launch. That would enable the North to show of its economic and technological power in a less provocative way than by testing an ICBM.\n\nThe language in Wednesday\u2019s state media report suggests Kim may be \u201ccontemplating some major policy decisions,\u201d said Rachel Minyoung Lee, an analyst with NK News, a website that monitors North Korea.\n\n\u201cThe report in Korean has characterized Kim\u2019s climb up to Mt Paektu on horseback as a new \u2018myth\u2019, and that, together with the images of him on a white horse, appear to have been designed to create maximum propaganda effect, which I believe media will play up in the days to come,\u201d Lee said.
