A defeat would likely mean another delay to a Brexit saga that has already lasted more than three years and transformed the U.K.\u2019s normally staid politics.\n\nParliament is due to sit on the weekend\u2014for the first time since the 1982 Falklands War\u2014to consider the revised Brexit plan agreed upon by Mr. Johnson and European leaders on Thursday.\n\nThe vote is likely to come down to just a handful of ballots either way. Mr. Johnson lacks a majority in Parliament and needs to bring on board party rebels and political opponents to prevail.\n\nMr. Johnson has already lost his party\u2019s Northern Irish allies. Many of the pro-Brexit Conservative lawmakers who opposed a deal negotiated by Mr. Johnson\u2019s predecessor have made positive noises but have yet to commit. Opposition Labour lawmakers representing Brexit-backing districts will be pivotal to his success or failure.\n\nDeal or No Deal? Here\u2019s a cheat-sheet of the most likely paths that Brexit could take. Parliament votes on deal reached in Brussels Passes Fails Govt. asks for extension until Jan. 31, 2020 Govt. refuses to ask for extension Parliament ousts Johnson or he resigns.* Caretaker govt. Govt. asks for extension until Jan. 31, 2020 Second Referendum No-deal Brexit Exit EU with a deal Election\n\nConservative whips were working overtime to build support on Friday. Downing Street officials said that an effort to reach out to Labour lawmakers who support Brexit was also under way and that the prime minister was spending the day on the phone to win over potential supporters.\n\nThe government\u2019s biggest selling point: Britain can finally turn the page on a political psychodrama that has dominated the country\u2019s politics since 2016.\n\n\u201cThis is the opportunity to get Brexit done, to turn the page and to allow the country to move forward,\u201d Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the British Broadcasting Corp. on Friday. \u201cThat\u2019s why [members of Parliament] on all sides, in my view, should vote for it on Saturday.\u201d\n\nA defeat would require Mr. Johnson to seek a three-month extension for Brexit to Jan. 31 under a law passed by Parliament last month in the teeth of fierce government resistance. Withdrawal has already been twice postponed.\n\nA delay would set the stage for a national election in the coming months. Mr. Johnson, who has gained ground in polls since taking office in July, is hoping such a vote would deliver him the comfortable majority needed to get Parliament to endorse his Brexit plan and finally take the U.K. out of the European Union.\n\nFor now, the ruling Conservatives have 287 voting lawmakers but Mr. Johnson will need 320 to get his deal over the line. Mr. Johnson\u2019s predecessor, Theresa May, failed on three occasions to garner enough support for the original withdrawal agreement.\n\nMr. Johnson\u2019s task will be made harder by the opposition to his deal of Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party. Ostensibly Conservative allies, the DUP on Friday said its 10 lawmakers would vote against Mr. Johnson\u2019s withdrawal package in Saturday\u2019s vote because it treats Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the U.K. in areas such as customs and tax.\n\nOne potential pool of votes is the fervently pro-Brexit wing of the Conservatives, often known collectively as the European Research Group. Twenty-eight of their number voted against Mrs. May\u2019s Brexit deal on all three occasions it came before Parliament.\n\nMr. Johnson\u2019s prospects for winning over this group are mixed. Some, such as Jacob Rees-Mogg and Priti Patel, were given government jobs by Mr. Johnson and should back the deal. A handful have signaled they will support it. ERG member Andrea Jenkyns, for example, tweeted on Thursday that she wants to see the detail but thought Mr. Johnson\u2019s deal better than Mrs. May\u2019s.\n\nThe group met on Friday to discuss the deal and will wait until Saturday before deciding whether to back it, according to one lawmaker. Many around the table expressed concern that the DUP says it won\u2019t endorse the agreement. \u201cWe want the entire U.K. to leave the EU after Brexit,\u201d the lawmaker said.\n\nIn a joint statement Friday, pro-Brexit groups aligned to the Conservative euroskeptic faction urged lawmakers to reject Mr. Johnson\u2019s deal, calling it \u201cdefective\u201d and inferior to quitting the EU without any deal at all. The groups believe a no-deal exit would be the best outcome for the economy, a view at odds with the government\u2019s own analysis. Their message may be persuasive for a kernel of ERG members who are similarly drawn to an abrupt \u201cno deal\u201d split with the bloc.\n\nMr. Johnson\u2019s charm offensive will also focus on 22 former Conservatives who quit or were kicked out of the party for opposing the prime minister\u2019s Brexit strategy. Many supported Mrs. May\u2019s Brexit deal but clashed with Mr. Johnson over his early enthusiasm for leaving without a deal. Now that he has struck a deal, many are likely to swing behind him. Already, figures from this group such as former Health Minister Stephen Hammond and former Digital Minister Margot James have said they would support the prime minister.\n\nEuropean Union and U.K. negotiators agreed on a draft Brexit deal, paving the way for a crucial vote in the U.K. Parliament. Investors are bracing for sharp movements in markets as the political drama builds.

Six supported Mrs. May\u2019s deal in defiance of party orders. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn on Thursday called Mr. Johnson\u2019s deal a sellout that threatens workers\u2019 rights and the economy, and he was expected to order lawmakers to oppose it.\n\nMr. Johnson will need to persuade more than twice that number to back his deal to win. The 19 Labour lawmakers who wrote to European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker last week urging a deal, including Stephen Kinnock and Caroline Flint, are the prime prospects who may back it.\n\nRonnie Campbell, a Labour lawmaker who supports Brexit, said that after voting against previous deals he is leaning toward voting for Mr. Johnson\u2019s deal\u2014but doubted that enough Labour lawmakers would back it to ensure the deal passed Parliament.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time we got the things settled\u2026I mean three years, it\u2019s just crazy,\u201d he said.\n\nHead to Head How Boris Johnson's Brexit agreement differs from Theresa May's.

Already, lawmakers have proposed amendments that would delay departure until Parliament has passed all relevant legislation and even to revoke Brexit altogether.\n\nMany lawmakers favor a second referendum on whether to leave the EU at all and may use Saturday\u2019s vote, or further votes next week on other legislation, to try to win support for a do-over.\n\n\u2014Alistair MacDonald contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Jason Douglas at jason.douglas@wsj.com and Max Colchester at max.colchester@wsj.com", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson wooed lawmakers in a last-minute charm offensive to back his Brexit deal ahead of a decisive vote.", "authors": ["Jason Douglas", "Max Colchester", "Jason.Douglas Wsj.Com", "Max.Colchester Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-118281/social", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
