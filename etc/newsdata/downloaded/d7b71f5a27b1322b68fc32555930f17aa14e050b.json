One of the Hottest Emerging-Market Bond Trades Is Fizzling\n\n(Bloomberg) -- For GAM UK, Vontobel, and Amundi one of the hottest emerging-market bond trades is starting to lose its charm.\n\nEven as central bankers around the world push on with policy easing, some of the biggest developing-nation investors are warning the dash for duration is overdone. After offering six times the return of bonds with less sensitivity to interest-rate changes, high-duration debt has stumbled in the past five weeks on signs the rally may have gone too far.\n\n\u201cThe risk is that it unwinds a bit,\u201d said Paul McNamara, a London-based fund manager who helps oversee $9.4 billion in assets at GAM UK. \u201cWe really need significantly worse news for rates to continue to rally.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if a soft U.S. jobs report on Friday would be enough to spur fresh interest after bonds with duration of at least 10 years handed investors an almost 24% return over nine months. According to Vontobel Asset Management, a pivot toward greater fiscal stimulus by governments could also eventually hamper the trade.\n\n\u201cPolicy makers are changing and recognizing that monetary policy alone cannot do all the heavy lifting,\u201d said Wouter Van Overfelt, a Zurich-based senior money manager at Vontobel, which oversees 128 billion Swiss francs ($128.6 billion) in assets. \u201cWhen it happens, or when markets get the impression it will happen, rates will move up and so that is why I think duration is actually a big risk today.\u201d\n\nAfter a 6% gain in August, bonds with a duration of at least 10 years flipped to a 1.4% loss last month. That compares with a 0.5% gain for debt with duration of zero to 1 year, according to a Bloomberg Barclays (LON: ) index tracking dollar-denominated debt. Those losses have extended into October.\n\nHeadwinds Remain\n\nNot everyone agrees the trade is fizzling.\n\nA host of headwinds, from weak U.S. manufacturing data to the U.S.-China trade war and Brexit mean inflation will remain elusive and rates may go lower still, fueling the hunt for yield.\n\n\u201cThe environment is still positive for duration,\u201d according to Stuart Ritson, an emerging-market bond fund manager at Aviva (LON: ) Investors in Singapore. \u201cGlobal growth continues to weaken, particularly in the manufacturing sector, and inflation is still low almost everywhere, and we\u2019ve got continued easing by global central banks.\u201d\n\nRay Jian, London-based portfolio manager and head of emerging-markets aggregate debt at Amundi Asset Management, is long duration versus his benchmark, but has been trimming the position since the summer.\n\nHe cites the risk to the trade from a possible breakthrough in trade talks, which would send yields higher. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He visits Washington for negotiations with his U.S. counterparts next week.\n\n\u201cWe believe most of the rally is behind us,\u201d Jian said.\n\n(Updates to add chart)", "description": "One of the Hottest Emerging-Market Bond Trades Is Fizzling", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEE7G0MD_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
