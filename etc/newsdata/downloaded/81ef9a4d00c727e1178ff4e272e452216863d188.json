It's also the second time it's topped the UK list, having previously won the accolade in 2015.\n\n(Image: Courtesy of TripAdvisor)\n\nAdam Stokes, who runs the restaurant with wife Natasha, said in a statement: \"We are absolutely thrilled to be awarded number one in the UK and 10th in the world in the Travellers\u2019 Choice Awards for Fine Dining Restaurants.\n\n\"This is our sixth proud year of being included in these customer focused awards and it is a huge achievement. I am immensely proud of our whole team AKA the \u2018Adam\u2019s family\u2019.\n\n\"With special credit to our Service Manager Shaun who has been with Adam\u2019s since day one and really embodies all that the 'Adam\u2019s family' is about. Thank you also to all our guests, old and new and those regulars we see time and time again.\"\n\n(Image: Courtesy of TripAdvisor)\n\nAs for everyday eateries?\n\nThese were picked based on being 'restaurants that provide great meals for any occasion that don\u2019t break the bank'.\n\n(Image: Courtesy of TripAdvisor)\n\nThe Dome in Edinburgh took the top spot, impressing with its culinary feats which showcase some seriously tasty Scottish favourites - not to mention its photogenic afternoon teas in its Georgian Tea Room never fail to be a hit with the Instagram crowd.\n\nAnother Edinburgh restaurant took one of the top three spots too; Makars Gourmet Mash Bar where you can find some hearty local fare and friendly staff.\n\n(Image: Courtesy of TripAdvisor)\n\nMeanwhile, London's Steak & Co won over diners thanks to the steaks served on hot plates with heaps of delicious sides.\n\nYou can check out the full list for both the everyday and fine dining categories below...\n\nUK's best everyday restaurants\n\nUK's best fine dining restaurants", "description": "The UK's best restaurants for 2019 have been revealed by TripAdvisor whether you're after fine dining or laidback dinners", "authors": ["Julie Delahaye", "Image", "Courtesy Of Tripadvisor"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20668090.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_UKs-best-restaurants-revealed-for-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
