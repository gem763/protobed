But the exact details of where the money has come from are not disclosed in the documents.\n\nThe BBC\u2019s pay report, released in the summer, showed that the presenter was paid up to almost \u00a3615,000 for his work for the corporation, but this did not include his fee from The Graham Norton Show. His other BBC work includes a Radio 2 show and presenting the Eurovsion Song Contest.\n\nThe figures from So Television, which includes what Mr Norton has earned from his chat show being sold around the world and other payments, will lead to speculation that he has taken a pay cut.\n\nNorton has recently appeared as a guest judge on Ru Paul's Drag Race UK alongside comedian Alan Carr (right) and Michelle Visage (centre)\n\nSo Television was bought by ITV in 2012 but Mr Norton remains a director of the company. He recently admitted that he could not \u2018justify\u2019 his wages so he did not try to. He said: \u2018Am I still cashing the cheques? Yes, because somehow the market forces have decreed this is my value.\u2019\n\nThe BBC\u2019s annual report in the summer put Mr Norton as its third most highly paid performer, behind Gary Lineker, on \u00a31.75million, and Chris Evans \u2013 who has now left the corporation \u2013 on about \u00a31.25million.\n\nBut Mr Norton questioned whether they really are \u2018top of the tree\u2019 in terms of BBC pay. He said: \u2018We all know there are people who earn a lot more than me and Gary.\u2019\n\nHowever, many of the BBC stars are paid through production companies, including BBC Studios, which do not have to declare what they are paying.\n\nLast week, Mr Norton said the outrage over his salary would be greatly diminished if the public knew how much his contemporaries at ITV made. He told Radio Times: \u2018For some reason, MPs want to know what famous people at the BBC earn. If they could get ITV to tell them what [This Morning presenter] Phillip Schofield gets, they\u2019d love to know. Also, what would really shock the public is to discover the disparity between ITV and BBC. People would go, \u201cWow!\u201d \u2019", "description": "Figures released by the company show that Mr Norton earned \u00a32.97 million from 'presenter fees', 'production fees' and 'royalties' in 2018, mostly for his work on BBC programmes.", "authors": ["Paul Revoir Media Editor For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/00/19611242-0-image-a-33_1570835235748.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
