He visited Sarajevo to speak with the survivors of the civil war that had divided the Serbs, Croats, and Muslims, and determined that genocide required American involvement. George H.W. Bush\u2019s administration had resisted action, leaving the troubles of the Balkans to the Europeans, and President Clinton, newly in office, wasn\u2019t much more interested in intervention. Clinton was haunted by the country\u2019s mistakes in Vietnam, but Holbrooke was convinced that involvement in Bosnia was different, and would be beneficial to American interests. By the summer of 1994, he\u2019d been named assistant secretary of state, with the directive of ending the Balkan catastrophe.\n\nPacker details how Holbrooke painstakingly worked to bring the leaders from the various factions together in Dayton, Ohio, to sign a peace agreement, albeit an uneasy one that created a state led by three presidents (one of each of the main ethnic groups). The agreement was a victory for American influence and saved many lives, though Packer writes, \u201cDayton did not mark a new path onward and upward in American history. It was closer to the end of something.\u201d He points to 1998 as the true beginning-of-the-end, when the Lewinsky scandal led to legislators spending a full year attacking each other, rather than focus on the national interest. \u201cDid any country ever combine so much power with so little responsibility?\u201d Packer asks. \u201cSlowly, imperceptibly at first, we lost that essential faith in ourselves.\u201d\n\nFor Bosnians who survived the civil war and the bitter nationalism that led to it, President Trump\u2019s rhetoric and his ethnic politics feel familiar, and concerning. In their own country, the Serb member of Bosnia\u2019s presidency is advocating secession, and the Dayton peace agreement is at risk as Russia fills the geo-political vacuum left by the United States. \u201cNow that the American century is over, even Bosnia, which would not exist without the United States, is slipping away,\u201d Packer writes. \u201cThere\u2019s something else that would trouble Holbrooke\u2019s ghost. Not the end of our global leadership\u2014it was never sustainable and 1995 was unique\u2014but the withering-away of our example.\u201d\n\nThe cover story is online today, April 10, 2019, at TheAtlantic.com.
