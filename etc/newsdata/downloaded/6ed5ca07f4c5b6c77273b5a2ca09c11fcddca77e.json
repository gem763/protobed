Apple rose 1.9%. Product and chipmakers have been among the most sensitive to developments in the trade dispute. Many of the companies in that sector rely on China for sales or parts.\n\nMerck rose 1.8% and did much of the heavy lifting for health care stocks. Medical device a drug maker Abbott Laboratories rose 2.5%.\n\nMakers of consumer products and consumer-oriented companies also made broad gains.\n\nBanks wobbled between small gains and losses while energy companies slid along with declining oil prices. Marathon Petroleum fell 2.1% and Occidental fell 1.4%.\n\nBond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 1.68% from 1.67% late Friday.\n\nTrade tensions seemed to ease a bit. China said its top negotiator will lead a 13th round of talks aimed at resolving the trade war with the U.S. The negotiations are expected to take place after Oct. 7.\n\nThe reassuring news follows a report Friday that the U.S. might seek to escalate the feud again by considering ways to limit U.S. investments in China. The Treasury Department, though, said there weren\u2019t currently plans to block Chinese companies from listing shares on U.S. stock exchanges.\n\nKEEPING SCORE: The S&P 500 index rose 0.7% as of 1:20 p.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 156 points, or 0.6%, to 26,977. The Nasdaq rose 0.8%.\n\nOVERSEAS: Stocks in Europe moved broadly higher. Unemployment in the 19 countries that use the euro fell in August to its lowest rate since May 2008, according to the European Union\u2019s statistics agency. Germany, Europe\u2019s biggest economy, separately reported a drop in its unemployment rate.\n\nAsian markets were mixed. Chinese manufacturing improved in September, even as demand for Chinese goods has been hurt by slower economic growth and the trade feud with the U.S.\n\nCHOPPY QUARTER: The trade war put a damper on the market again during the third quarter. The U.S. and China again escalated their trade war in August, blunting gains for every major U.S. index. Stocks started climbing again in September as both sides made conciliatory moves to ease tensions ahead of another round of planned talks in October.\n\nThe S&P 500 and the Dow are both on track for quarterly gains of more than 1%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq never fully recovered from the August hit and is wobbling between small gains and losses.\n\nSmall companies bore the brunt of the trade war damage during the quarter. The Russell 2000 is on track for a 3% loss.\n\nANALYST\u2019S TAKE: Investors are putting a frustrating quarter behind them and gearing up for what could be another tough period. The trade war and Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union will loom over the market. The impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump also has the potential to crimp the market\u2019s gains.\n\n\u201cThe consumer\u2019s been enough to keep the economy moving, but things like consumer confidence seem to be plateauing,\u201d said Emily Roland, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management.\n\nThe latest earnings results from companies in the next few weeks will give investors a better picture of the economy\u2019s potential direction. \u201cWe need that earnings engine to kick in to drive markets higher,\u201d Roland said.\n\nHOME STRETCH AHEAD: Investors are heading into the final quarter of 2019 with the trade war hanging over the market and corporate financial results on the way in mid-October.\n\nThe next round of trade negotiations could be the key to heading off another round of destructive tariffs in December. Both sides have postponed some of the more worrisome tariff increases, which would more directly raise prices on consumer goods and potentially crimp consumer spending.\n\nInvestors will soon get a better glimpse of the trade war\u2019s impact with the next round of corporate financial results later this month. Analysts are forecasting that profits will contract by more than 3%, according to FactSet.\n\nLast year, the market slumped 14% in the fourth quarter as investors became rattled over a slowdown in economic growth and the Federal Reserve\u2019s plans to keep raising interest rates. This time around, the Federal Reserve has shifted gears by cutting interest rates in an effort to help shore up economic growth. The central bank has signaled that it is ready to take additional measures, if necessary, to offset the damage being done by the trade war.\n\nPROFIT HAMMER: Thor Industries surged 17% after the maker of Airstream recreational vehicles beat Wall Street\u2019s fiscal fourth quarter profit forecasts.\n\nEGGED RESULTS: Egg producer Cal-Maine fell 10.8% after the company said too many eggs on the market battered its first quarter financial results. The oversupply significantly lowered the price of eggs and cut into the company\u2019s revenue. It recorded a surprisingly large loss.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Stocks marched higher in afternoon trading Monday as investors moved closer to wrapping up a highly volatile quarter in which the market was buffeted by swings in the U.S.-China trade war.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Damian J.
