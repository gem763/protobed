The vote tally will prove a final do or die moment before the October 31 withdrawal deadline.\n\nJohnson\u2019s predecessor, the politically impotent Theresa May, submitted withdrawal plans four separate times to parliament, which rejected all of them with solid majorities. Subsequently, parliament, hostile to a hard Brexit and independence from the continent, passed a law demanding a deadline extension if no deal was reached by October 17.\n\nEven hamstrung, Johnson was able to narrowly beat the clock and negotiate a new proposal.\n\n\u201cWhere there is a will, there is a deal\u2014we have one! It\u2019s a fair and balanced agreement for the EU and the UK and it is testament to our commitment to find solutions,\u201d said outgoing President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker.\n\nThe primary difference between the deals produced by May and Johnson revolve around the Irish question. Northern Ireland, as part of the United Kingdom, would be part of any withdrawal process. Currently, there are no customs posts or physical checkmarks between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. This is partially because they\u2019re in the same customs union under the European Single Market, and also because of the Good Friday Agreement of 1999, which put an end to The Troubles.\n\nA sudden hard border in Ireland could rupture the peace, which put an end to thirty years of low-level warfare which led to over 3,500 deaths. Theresa May\u2019s solution, rejected by parliament, was to keep the entirety of the United Kingdom in the Single Market, subject to European regulations and economic diktats. This would have been a Brexit in name only. Johnson\u2019s new agreement takes all parts of the United Kingdom out of the Single Market, with a special addendum for Northern Ireland to follow European rules and procedures on trade.\n\n\u201cBoris\u2019s deal is definitely an improvement over May\u2019s deal,\u201d explains Andrew Stuttaford, contributing editor at National Review. \u201cThe way that the famous Irish backstop has been replaced means that the UK is not effectively locked into the EU\u2019s ecosystem . . . Northern Ireland is going to end up in the middle spot of a Venn diagram, between the EU and the UK.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven if this deal falls flat, Boris has done the impossible and found a middle ground on Brexit,\u201d says Freddy Gray, deputy editor at The Spectator. Johnson was the editor of the same publication from 1999 to 2005. \u201cPeople can say it is just May\u2019s deal and in large part it is\u2014but he has achieved real key concessions, especially in terms of the backstop and Britain\u2019s ability to control its affairs in the future.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), a North Irish political party in coalition with Johnson\u2019s Conservative Party, has come out against the deal. They believe it separates Northern Ireland too much politically from the rest of the UK.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re asking too much. I understand where they\u2019re coming from, but at the end of the day there is a limit to the extent to which they can set the agenda,\u201d says Stuttaford on the DUP\u2019s intransigence.\n\nThey\u2019re not the only ones who have come out against the deal. So have the Scottish National Party (SNP), and the Liberal Democrats, who oppose Brexit in any form. The Labour Party says \u201cthe Prime Minister has negotiated an even worse deal than Theresa May\u2019s,\u201d while Nigel Farage, head of the Brexit Party, called it \u201cthe second worst deal in history and it\u2019s still not worth voting for.\u201d\n\nThe only outside support the deal seems to be getting is from the rebel Tories, expelled from the party after voting to prevent a no-deal Brexit last month. They\u2019d likely support Johnson\u2019s new deal in exchange for amnesty. Even with a few stray Labour votes, it\u2019ll be very difficult for Johnson to cobble together a majority.\n\n\u201cThe calculations that some individual MPs will be doing will be enormously complicated. What is it going to mean for their political futures, what is it going to mean for their party\u2019s political futures, what of their own beliefs (which sometimes get forgotten)?\u201d asked Stuttaford.\n\n\u201cIf he fails in parliament tomorrow, he will only succeed more at the ballot when he finally get the general election Britain so badly needs,\u201d says Gray confidently. \u201cI don\u2019t like to gush, but it is an objectively an incredible political achievement.\u201d\n\nIf the deal fails, then Johnson will be compelled by law to request the EU for an extension. But will the EU grant it, or say a pox upon their house and leave the UK to deal with the economic ramifications of a hard Brexit?\n\nHunter DeRensis is a reporter at the National Interest.\n\nImage: Reuters", "description": "If the Brexit deal fails, then Prime Minister Johnson will be compelled by law to ask the EU for an extension.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://nationalinterest.org/sites/default/files/main_images/RTS2KWET.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
