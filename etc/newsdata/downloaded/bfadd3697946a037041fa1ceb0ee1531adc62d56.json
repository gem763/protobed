Sitting in third, Susie Appleby's side were looking to narrow the gap at the summit of the league, where earlier in the day table-toppers Harlequins survived a scare at Loughborough to recover a 17-0 deficit to triumph 36-27.\n\nEven in the absence of their captain and talismanic scrum-half Natasha Hunt, the Cherry and Whites more than matched the hosts until Hannah Botterman crashed over from a routine driving maul on the half hour mark, before Marlie Packer followed up with a try of her own.\n\nBut for large pockets of the game, Saracens struggled to imprint their brand of free-flowing rugby as indiscipline crept in, the hosts strayed offside twice in quick succession to gift Hartpury a scrum five metres out, allowing Erica Mills to squeeze through a sea of bodies en route to the whitewash with Lleucu George slotting home the extras.", "description": "Saracens 15-7 Gloucester Hartpury", "authors": ["Fiona Tomas"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/rugby-union/2019/10/26/Marlie-Packer-Wired-Photos-Matt-Impey-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqH8SigKU_VeU0bP0BbEQoy37L2GI39Rzi52FobiMZ1dY.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
