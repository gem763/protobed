Elizabeth Warren. | Scott Olson/Getty Images 2020 elections Warren announces $10 million-plus ad buy in early states\n\nElizabeth Warren\u2019s presidential campaign on Tuesday announced an early-state ad campaign of at least $10 million, suggesting that the Massachusetts senator is continuing to raise big money from grass-roots donors after an anemic start.\n\nThe campaign told POLITICO that a digital ad campaign would begin immediately and that the entire buy will ramp up over the next few months. The campaign declined to say when its spending on digital and TV ads would reach eight figures.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cRight now, our biggest expense as a campaign is our staff, but as the campaign heats up, it will be on media to reach potential voters,\" campaign manager Roger Lau wrote in a memo emailed to supporters Tuesday morning. The campaign \"will be more digital than old-school broadcast television.\u201d\n\nThe campaign also released three ads Tuesday \u2014 15-second, 30-second, and 1-minute spots \u2014 which highlight Warren\u2019s policy plans and her intention to crack down on corruption in government.\n\nThe shorter ads both end with: \u201cI\u2019m Elizabeth Warren. I know what\u2019s wrong. I know how to fix it. And I\u2019ll fight to get it done.\u201d The longest one finishes with footage from Warren\u2019s recent rally in New York City and concludes with her saying, \u201cIt\u2019s corruption: pure and simple. We must root it out and return our democracy to the people. And yes, I got a plan for that.\u201d\n\nLau echoed that message in his memo, writing, \"We've released dozens of plans in the past seven months, but they're really one big, simple plan: to break the stranglehold of corruption on Washington and put political and economic power in the hands of the people, where it belongs.\u201d\n\nThe ad campaign will be a test of Warren\u2019s in-house production team, which she adopted instead of the usual consultant and media-buying campaign model. Warren's aides said all three ads were produced inside the campaign.\n\n\u201cWe have built an in-house staff to produce videos and ads rather than adopt the consultant-driven approach of other campaigns (and the big commissions and fees that come along with it),\u201d Lau wrote.\n\nWarren is one of several candidates who have recently announced at least part of their strategy for the final months before the Iowa caucus next February.\n\n\n\nSen. Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign told reporters earlier this month that she is going all-in on Iowa, doubling their state staff and planning weekly visits. Sen. Cory Booker\u2019s campaign manager announced the campaign was in dire financial straits and would potentially withdraw from the race unless it could raise $1.7 million in the last 10 days of the third quarter.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign also held a background briefing with reporters earlier this month in which they downplayed expectations in the early contests of Iowa and New Hampshire. The memos and briefings also come in the final weeks of the third fundraising quarter.\n\nIt was the second time this year that Lau has publicly outlined his approach to the race. The Warren campaign sent a memo near the end of the first fundraising quarter when several other candidates significantly outraised Warren\u2019s underwhelming $6 million. The memo played down expectations by casting the campaign as an \u201cunderdog,\u201d and took direct aim at some of the punditry narratives surrounding Warren\u2019s electability.\n\n\u201cNeither President Barack Obama nor President Donald Trump fit the idea of \u2018electability,\u2019\u201d Lau wrote. \u201cElections are not won by nominees chosen to appeal to or pacify the other side: elections are won by candidates who inspire their party\u2019s voters to turn out on Election Day and who have an effective organization to drive it home. ... Electability requires boldness.\u201d\n\nThe memo highlighted Warren's tactical choices, such as investing early in organizers and integrating its data and tech teams in-house. Both moves have been praised by Democratic activists in early states and some digital organizers.", "description": "The campaign told POLITICO that a digital ad campaign would begin immediately and that the entire buy will ramp up over the next few months.", "authors": ["Alex Thompson"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/b7/e5/014358694c148bcb1097028b6827/190924-elizabeth-warren-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
