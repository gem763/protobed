Look familiar?", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announces a formal impeachment inquiry into President Trump on Tuesday. (Andrew Harnik/AP)\n\nUnderpromise. Overdeliver. It\u2019s the best advice to everyone in any business, on any subject, but especially true in media and politics. Put another way: Don\u2019t get caught opening Al Capone\u2019s vault and finding, well, nothing.\n\nOf course, it would be even worse to hype the opening of the vault, the way Geraldo Rivera did for a TV special in 1986, and, finding it empty, to nevertheless declare triumphantly, \u201cThere you have it! The greatest discovery of all time.\u201d That would transform a foolish move into a permanent scar.\n\nWhich is essentially the way House Democrats (mis)handled the guaranteed-to-get-him-impeached rough transcript of the phone call in July between President Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine. Many Democrats, egged on by a complicit Greek chorus \u2014 media artists formerly known as \u201cthe echo chamber\u201d \u2014 were stuck with on Wednesday. Out they marched, declaring the empty vault of the transcript a bill of particulars against Trump that would require the drafting of articles of impeachment and their immediate passage not just by a select committee but by the whole House.\n\nFreshman Democrats elected in 2018 from Trump-majority congressional districts have been cornered by these events. The average voter in the three key states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin is going to think this impeachment circus absurd. Especially given that Democrats now have enough empty vaults to open a new Fort Knox.\n\nThe much-touted investigation by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III found no collusion by Trump with the Russians in the 2016 election. What about obstruction of justice? Attorney General William P. Barr, buttressed by then-Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, determined that none had occurred.\n\nMix in the damning report by the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general regarding former FBI director James B. Comey\u2019s mishandling of documents, and the apparently imminent prosecution of former acting FBI director Andrew McCabe for misleading federal investigators, and the public is rightfully suspicious of the latest frenzy over supposed Trump transgressions.\n\nNow the hugely hyped rough transcript of the president\u2019s phone call has turned out to be a nothingburger, and the ground is suddenly shifting not under Trump but under \u201cthe Resistance.\u201d All of those moderate Democrats in precarious seats have been exposed as auxiliaries of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and her hard-left allies in \u201cthe Squad.\u201d\n\nTrue, a more circumspect president might have steered clear, in the call with Zelensky, of discussing Ukraine\u2019s history of corruption. And another president might have considered it bad form to bring up former vice president Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, and his involvement with a Ukrainian energy company.\n\nBut Trump isn\u2019t circumspect. If something is on his mind, that\u2019s what he says, and he speaks directly, not with diplomatic evasions. As Kimberley Strassel says in her perceptive new book \u201cResistance (At All Costs),\u201d Trump has no filters. A great swath of America believes that filters do undeniably exist around Washington\u2019s Beltway \u2013 and that those filters are malign, functioning to distort information and mislead the rest of the nation.\n\nThese voters like \u2014 indeed, love \u2014 the fact that they get \u201cTrump Unplugged\u201d almost every day. They read the phone call\u2019s rough transcript and laugh at the politicos and pundits who are desperately pivoting to it from their other failed narratives about the president: Trump/Russia gave way to Trump/racist, then Trump/recession and now Trump/Ukraine. People are also wising up to the striking similarities in these tales, which are populated with unnamed accusers and eyebrow-raising tactics. Yet on and on the Democrats come, as unstoppable yet hapless as Wile E. Coyote in pursuit of Donald J. Roadrunner.\n\nIf you are part of the 1 percent of America who watches MSNBC or CNN, you are going to be told tonight, tomorrow and frequently in the days and weeks ahead that Trump is in deep trouble.\n\nIf you watch Fox News or listen to center-right radio, you are going to hear a lot of replays of Biden\u2019s bragging about getting a Ukraine prosecutor fired (which may have been a good thing). You will also hear plenty about the former vice president\u2019s son pulling down $50,000 a month for serving on the board of a Ukrainian gas company (which may have been perfectly legitimate, but you have to ask, \u201cWhat did the owner think he was buying?\u201d).\n\nWhat you won\u2019t be hearing, no matter what you watch or listen to, is a roll-call vote for a House select committee on impeachment in response to revelations about the contents of the president\u2019s fabled phone call. Because, well, the vault was empty. Again.\n\nRead more:\n\nMarc A.
