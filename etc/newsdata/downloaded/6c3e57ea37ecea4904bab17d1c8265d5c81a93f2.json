Barclays set aside an extra \u00a31.4billion.\n\nLloyds is expected to reveal a \u00a31.7billion hit from missold PPI\n\nLloyds said in July that it was getting 190,000 PPI claims each week.\n\nBut this rocketed to between 600,000 and 800,000 in the run-up to the claims deadline earlier this year on August 29.\n\nProfits at Britain\u2019s banks have tanked as hundreds of thousands of customers rushed to claim PPI repayments.\n\nPPI was sold to cover customers if they were not able to meet repayments on loans, credit cards or mortgages. In some cases, people were not told the cover had been added to their loan contracts. Others were sold PPI even though they would never have been eligible to claim on the policy.\n\nPPI providers paid out \u00a336.4billion in redress between January 2011 and July 2019, according to the Financial Conduct Authority.\n\nTotal monthly payouts jumped 27 per cent to \u00a3432.9million between June and July this year \u2013 and it is thought the figures for August will spike again.\n\nEconomists have estimated that the end of payouts could trigger a 0.3 per cent decline in consumer spending.", "description": "Lloyds will this week reveal its profits were practically wiped out by a flood of claims for missold payment protection insurance (PPI) ahead of the deadline for customers seeking redress.", "authors": ["Helen Cahill For The Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
