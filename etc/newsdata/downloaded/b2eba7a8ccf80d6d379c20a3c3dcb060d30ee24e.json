During the same period last year, 109 people died.\n\nOfficials say another concerning trend is an increase in the number of housed people who are dying from fentanyl-related overdoses. From June to September, 21 housed people have died from overdoses that somehow involved fentanyl, a synthetic narcotic much more potent than other opioids like heroin.\n\nSince January, 63 housed people have died from fentanyl. That exceeds last year\u2019s total of 62.\n\nPublic Health found that from mid-June through August, only one person experiencing homelessness died from fentanyl-related causes.\n\nOverdose deaths continue to rise in King County and across the state, driven by fentanyl.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Seattle Times, http://www.seattletimes.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Officials with Public Health - Seattle & King County say pills and drugs in powder form laced with fentanyl are behind a spike in overdose deaths across King County.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
