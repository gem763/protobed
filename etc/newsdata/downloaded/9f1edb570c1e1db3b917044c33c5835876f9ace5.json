The life insurance giant has had to set aside \u00a3110million to pay redress to 17,240 savers, most of whom have already been contacted. Total compensation to be paid out by Prudential is expected to be approximately \u00a3250million.\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority also said the Pru did not make sure that its call handlers had 'appropriate' documentation to support customers, and 'failed to monitor calls with customers properly'.\n\nFollowing concerns about the opaqueness and poor value of annuities, as well as the failure of many customers to compare deals, insurers are now required to explain to customers that they may get a better rate if they shop around on the open market.\n\nThe FCA gave the example of a customer who phoned Prudential to inform them they suffered of asthma.\n\n'The call handler confirmed that Prudential would not offer an enhanced annuity based on asthma but failed to inform the customer that they may have been able to find an alternative provider who might pay an enhanced income based on their medical condition,' the FCA report states.\n\n'The call handler also failed to ask questions in relation to lifestyle conditions.'\n\nThe FCA said Prudential call handlers may have put their own financial interests before the best outcome for customers on annuities\n\nThe FCA noted how, before 2013, the Pru's call handlers were given sales-linked incentives, which means they 'might [have] put their own financial interests ahead of ensuring fair customer outcomes'.\n\nCall handlers working at the Pru before 2013 could earn 37 per cent on top of their salary depending on how many sales they achieved, as well as winning prizes such as spa breaks or weekend holidays.\n\nThe FCA's Mark Steward said: 'Prudential failed to treat some of its customers, who could have secured a better deal on the open market, fairly.\n\n'These are very serious breaches that caused harm to those customers. Prudential is now rightly focussed on redress and today\u2019s financial penalty reinforces the cardinal obligation of fairness that firms owe to customers.'\n\nPrudential said they were 'deeply sorry' for the 'historic failings'.\n\n'We are working hard to put this right and are on schedule to offer redress to the vast majority of affected customers by the end of October this year,' a spokesperson for the company said.\n\nThe failure over annuities at Prudential compounded the problems savers already faced from falling annuity rates in the wake of the financial crisis.\n\nThe failure to shop around for annuities was also a widely-known issue in the financial world and one that This is Money and our sister newspaper publications had campaigned for many years.", "description": "A sales culture that saw life insurance giant Prudential fined almost \u00a324million by the FCA for failing to tell customers they could get a better deal on annuities, has been laid bare in a report.", "authors": ["Camilla Canocchi For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
