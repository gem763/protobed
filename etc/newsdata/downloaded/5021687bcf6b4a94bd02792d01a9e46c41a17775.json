Ali\u2019s win not only helped the U.S. tie for most track world golds with 14 wins overall, but it also inspired countless parents around the world.\n\n\u201cJust because you\u2019re a mom doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t get out here and continue to be an athlete as well, a top, world-class athlete,\u201d Ali said on Saturday. \u201cI know [Yuri] is going to look up to me and look at this and it\u2019s definitely going to keep her motivated and show what strength really looks like to be able to go through this and train hard and be on top.\u201d\n\nSunday\u2019s win was not Ali\u2019s first time getting back on the field not long after giving birth. According to NBC Sports, prior to her world title, Ali earned silver in Rio one year after the birth of her son. She was also one of several mothers during this year\u2019s championships that made history as well. Allyson Felix won her 12th gold medal 10 months after the birth of her daughter in November \u2014 and after being dropped by Nike during her pregnancy \u2014 topping a record previously held by Usain Bolt. Shelly-Ann Fraser Pryce, 32, of Jamaica became the first mom to win a Olympic 100-meter title.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been such an inspiration to see everyone come together and feed off each other,\u201d Ali said.\n\nAli is not the only one inspired by the women at this years\u2019 World Athletics Championship:\n\nThis is what a world athletics champion black mother of two children looks like.
