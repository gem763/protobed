S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures also indicated steep decline.\n\nTech shares fell in the premarket. Facebook and Amazon dropped 1% and 0.8%, respectively. Netflix lost 0.6% while Alphabet slid 0.7%. Industrial shares such as Caterpillar and Union Pacific pulled back more than 1% each.\n\nConcern around the economy was sparked on Tuesday after the Institute for Supply Management said U.S. manufacturing activity fell last month to its lowest level in more than 10 years.\n\nThe weak data sent the major indexes tumbling on Tuesday, the first day of the fourth quarter. The Dow dropped more than 300 points while the S&P 500 slid 1.2%, their biggest one-day drops since Aug. 23. Those losses were enough to wipe out the Dow and S&P 500's gains for the entire third quarter.\n\nNicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, said the market will \"want to see real progress\" from the upcoming U.S.-China trade talks after the disappointing data. \"Markets will be looking for positive commentary from both sides going into this meeting and tangible steps to an agreement immediately after,\" he said in a note.\n\nChinese and U.S. officials are scheduled to meet in Washington next week. Both sides have been in a trade war since last year that has rattled investor sentiment and economic growth expectations.\n\nWall Street's focus remained on the economic data as private payrolls growth slowed down in September, according to a report from ADP and Moody's Analytics. Payrolls increased by 135,000 in September, a drop from 157,000 in August. The data from ADP and Moody's Analytics is seen by investors as a preview to the government's monthly jobs report, which will be released Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET.\n\nThere are a number of Federal Reserve speeches, including from New York's Fed President John Williams at 10:50 a.m. ET.", "description": "U.S. stock index futures fell sharply on Wednesday as investors worried over the possibility of an economic recession.", "authors": ["Fred Imbert Silvia Amaro", "Fred Imbert", "Silvia Amaro"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106112173-1567630191434gettyimages-1161831193.jpeg?v=1568631712"}
