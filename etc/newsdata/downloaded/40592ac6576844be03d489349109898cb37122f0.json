However this has done little to quell online anger.\n\nBut the hashtag #ZaraStatement went viral on Weibo - racking up more than 330 million views - with many calling the statement insincere.\n\n\"This is really perfunctory. If you really want to sincerely talk about it, say it in a [proper] way. If you're not sincere, don't say anything,\" said one typical comment on Weibo.\n\nIt is not unusual for Western brands to find themselves in the middle of a consumer backlash in China - though they usually dig their way out by issuing long apologetic statements.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Zara has 14 stores in the city of Hong Kong\n\nThe pro-China internet commenters felt what was missing from Zara's statement was an overt apology.\n\n\"Show some sincerity Zara. I hope you will apologise and give a [proper] answer. If not, get out,\" one Weibo user said.\n\n\"You have the freedom to make whatever statement you want Zara. I also have the right not to buy your brand,\" another commenter said.\n\nState media outlet the Global Times on Tuesday further inflamed tensions with an opinion piece which called for Zara to give \"a solemn explanation\".\n\nIt said Zara was setting a \"very negative example\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption It is not uncommon for protesters to disrupt train services as a form of protest\n\nZara later clarified that it had \"delayed\" opening some stores on Monday because workers had trouble getting to work due to transport problems linked to the protests.\n\nActivists had on Monday disrupted train services at different stations, causing major rush hour traffic delays.\n\n\"Let us clarify that all our 14 stores in Hong Kong SAR opened and every customer was welcome that day,\" said Inditex in a statement to the BBC.\n\n\"Due to transportation difficulties, we delayed the opening of four of our stores for several hours until our employees have been able to arrive to their jobs.\"\n\nThe Global Times however, said in a separate article that its reporters had found that train services \"were not significantly delayed\", implying that Zara had not been completely honest.\n\nThe Spanish retailer said it \"deeply regretted any misunderstanding\" the move had caused.\n\nThis is not the first time Zara has come under fire in Hong Kong.\n\nLast year, it was criticised on Chinese social media for listing Taiwan - which China sees as part of its territory - as a separate country.\n\nHong Kong is now entering its 14th successive week of demonstrations.\n\nThe protests were sparked by changes to a law that would allow extradition to mainland China, but have since widened to include calls for an independent inquiry into police brutality and universal suffrage.\n\nA guide to the Hong Kong protests", "description": "Thousands called for a Zara boycott after the retailer was accused of supporting Hong Kong protests.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/FFB4/production/_108606456_gettyimages-1156688177.jpg"}
