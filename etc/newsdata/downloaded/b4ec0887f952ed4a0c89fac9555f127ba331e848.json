The administration\u2019s August 19, almost final, submission to the court, echoes that claim by ignoring the issue.\n\nSome anti-DACA legal pleas are spotlighting the government\u2019s low profile support of the 1324a claim. \u201cThe Government has never said which benefits it does not believe it may lawfully confer [to DACA recipients] \u2026 Nor has the Government explained whether or to what extent it now believes the DHS work-authorization regulation is unlawful,\u201d said a legal brief from several unions.\n\nThe near silence about DACA work permits shows that government lawyers are ignoring the best argument against Obama\u2019s DACA, said John Miano, a lawyer with the Immigration Reform Law Institute.\n\nBut the work permit issue hides a massive economic landmine: The government awards millions of work permits each year using the same legal 1324a claim that Obama used in the DACA case. If the court rejects 1324a work-permit claim, investors could lose millions of migrant workers \u2014 and so face even more pressure to raise Americans\u2019 wages.\n\n\u201cClearly, the parties do not want to discuss the question of how 1324a conferred on DHS [Department of Homeland Security] unlimited power to grant alien employment,\u201d said Miano. He continued:\n\nBoth the government and the [pro-DACA] plaintiffs simply claim it is exists \u2026 Few amici [pleas] supporting the [DACA migrants] raised the issue and those that did claimed 1324a created or ratified this unlimited power with no explanation.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook says DACA illegals are 'as American as any of us.' So Cook & his investor class peers claim the power to rewrite immigration law & create new Americans for work, consumption, and elections.\n\nBTW, progressives & estb. media are applauding. https://t.co/MIY1uBcwMd \u2014 Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) October 3, 2019\n\nThe Obama administration took two steps during the 2012 DACA amnesty.\n\nIt provided a controversial blanket get-out-0f-deportation card for 800,000 younger migrants \u2014 and it also quietly provided official, legal work permits for those migrants.\n\nThe Obama administration said the blanket no deportation policy was justified by \u201cprosecutorial discretion.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s deputies claimed the award of work-permits for foreign migrants was legal because of an obscure corner of federal code, called Section 1324a.\n\nObama\u2019s deputies argued that the first and last paragraphs of Section 1324a say presidents can award as many work permits as they wish:\n\nBefore Obama, President George W. Bush used the same 1324a claim to justify the \u201cOptional Practical Training\u201d program. The OPT program has been used by Microsoft, Intel, Cisco, and many other companies to hire foreign graduates instead of American graduates.\n\nThe administration has repeatedly refused to discuss the 1324a claim with Breitbart News. But the DACA case has forced officials to respond.\n\nIn November 2018, Trump\u2019s Solicitor General wrote in a plea to the court:\n\npre-existing DHS regulations allow all deferred-action recipients to apply for employment authorization, enabling them to work legally and pay taxes. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(h)(3) (empowering the Executive Branch to authorize the employment of noncitizens); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 274a.12(c)(14) (providing that \u201c[a]n alien who has been granted deferred action\u201d is eligible for work authorization upon a showing of \u201ceconomic necessity for employment\u201d). Indeed, \u201cDACA recipients are required to apply for employment authorization, in keeping with the Executive\u2019s intention that DACA recipients remain \u2018productive\u2019 members of society.\u201d\n\nThe administration\u2019s August 19, 2019 plea includes this supporting claim:\n\nUnder DHS regulations, aliens granted deferred action may receive certain benefits, including work authorization for the same period if they establish economic necessity, 8 C.F.R. 274a.12(c)(14).\n\nBut a Texas appeals court has already struck down the 1324a work-permit claim when it blocked Obama\u2019s follow-on amnesty \u2014 the 2014 DAPA amnesty for the illegal immigrant parents of U.S.-born children. The Texas court said:\n\nFor the authority to implement DAPA, the government relies in part on 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(h)(3), a provision that does not mention lawful presence or deferred action, and that is listed as a \u201c[m]iscellaneous\u201d definitional provision expressly limited to \u00a7 1324a, a section concerning the \u201cUnlawful employment of aliens\u201d\u2014an exceedingly unlikely place to find authorization for DAPA.\n\nIf the Supreme Court upholds the Texas court\u2019s rejection of the DACA work permits, it will bar work permits for the DACA illegals and many other foreign workers, said Miano.\n\nImmigration reform groups are trying to spotlight the issue, amid media silence. For example, Miano\u2019s Immigration Law Reform Institute submitted a plea saying:\n\nif \u00a7 1324a(h)(3) permitted DHS to give work authorization to DACA beneficiaries, it could only be because that provision allowed DHS to authorize work for any class of alien it chose; the provision contains no limiting language. If Congress had granted the executive branch such vast discretion, it would have done so clearly, not through \u201cvague terms or ancillary provisions\u2014it does not, one might say, hide elephants in mouseholes.\u201d Whitman v. Am. Trucking Ass\u2019ns, 531 U.S. 457, 468 (2001). It is not reasonable to suppose that Congress, without any clear statement that it was doing so, granted to DHS the unrestricted power to overthrow Congress\u2019s own grants of employment protection to American workers.\n\nThe 1324a claim is a huge economic issue because it justifies the award of work permits to many foreign migrants, students, and graduates.\n\nFor example, Bush\u2019s OPT and pre-graduation \u201cCurricular Practical Training\u201d program has ballooned to 430,000 active work permits in 2017. That army includes tens of thousands of foreign graduates who were invited to take jobs at prestigious U.S. firms \u2014 so denying those jobs to the children of the U.S. professional class.\n\nThe minimal media coverage of the OPT program also helps to hide the OPT fraud, which cheats the sons and daughters of middle-class Americans.\n\nGAO warns DHS to do more to prevent the smuggling of Indian and Chinese graduates into U.S. white-collar careers, such as software, healthcare, accounting, etc. Most smuggling takes place via the universities' 'OPT' work-permit giveaway to foreign grads. https://t.co/NSUIVQDO4m \u2014 Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) August 27, 2019\n\nBut the OPT program is especially important to universities because it allows them to market their expensive credentials to foreign students with promises of work permit that last up to three years. In 2018, 143,000 foreign customers of U.S. post-graduate colleges received the work-permits.\n\nThe OPT program is just one corner of the huge work-permit economy created by the 1324a claim.\n\nIn 2018, at least 1.97 million work permits \u2014 mostly lasting one year \u2014 were issued to foreigners, according to data provided by the Department of Homeland Security. The wave of work permits was issued via a diversity of mandatory and discretionary programs, including many programs justified by the 1324a claim.\n\nThe huge total provides roughly two work permit workers for every four Americans who turned 18 that year.\n\nThis gusher of foreign workers has sidelined many young and old Americans, suppressed their wages and salaries, and boosted stock-market returns by preventing a bidding war for American employees in a growing economy.\n\nThe 2018 work permit total includes 328,000 work permits for DACA migrants, 54,000 permits for the wives of Indian H-1B visa-workers, 245,000 work permits for resident foreigners who merely ask for green cards \u2014 dubbed \u201cAdjustment of Status\u201d \u2014 and 345,000 permits for migrants who ask for asylum.\n\nThe work permit total does not include at least 150,000 new visa-workers each year, such as the 100,000 new H-1B workers who joined the existing population of roughly 750,000 H-1B workers.\n\nCensus data shows how huge numbers of American software graduates have been replaced by Indian & Chinese visa-workers in N.J., California, N.C., Georgia, N.Y., Texas, Virginia, Florida, and other states. Next: Healthcare professionals. @S386 https://t.co/qH9p4Ynd34 \u2014 Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) October 3, 2019\n\nIn the 2016 election, Trump denounced the H-1B visa program, which keeps roughly 800,000 foreign graduates in U.S. jobs.\n\nBut Trump has also repeatedly said he welcomes the movement of foreign graduates into the U.S. economy. On October 11, for example, he told reporters:\n\nWe\u2019re going to be very good to Chinese students. Nope. I\u2019ve heard this question many times before, including from our own security people. We want all the people that want to come over from China. We have the greatest university system in the world, and we\u2019re going to keep it that way. And one of the reasons it\u2019s great is we have a lot of students from China. No, we\u2019re not going to make it tough. We\u2019re going to make it like for everybody else. Okay? We\u2019re going to make it \u2014 I think that\u2019s important. \u2026 I want them coming here. We want the greatest talent in the world coming to our great universities \u2014 to Harvard, Yale, Princeton, the great Wharton School of Finance \u2014 to Stanford, all of these great schools. We want them \u2014 we want them coming here. And that\u2019s what we have. And that\u2019s one of the reasons we have the great system. And there have been discussing about [stopping] that \u2014 not by me, because I ended them very quickly. I want to let you know, I end those discussions very quickly.\n\nPro-DACA groups try to minimize media coverage of the legality of the 1324a claim. But some of the pro-DACA legal briefs briefly endorse the 1324a claim. The main plaintiff, the University of California, wrote:\n\nBeginning with President Eisenhower, every administration has exercised this authority to grant deferred action to groups of otherwise removable immigrants. Congress has expressly recognized that the Executive Branch possesses this authority. It did so knowing that longstanding regulations confer benefits, such as work authorization, on individuals granted deferred action. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(h)(3).\n\nIn 2017, the University of California had more than 40,000 foreign students, and more than 10,200 OPT graduates.\n\nThe top law officers in California, Maryland, Maine, and Minnesota argued for the preservation of the work-permit claim as they wrote:\n\nBy regulation, the Attorney General (and now the Secretary) have exercised statutory authority to confer certain limited benefits on individuals who receive deferred action. Petitioners do not question these \u201clongstanding regulations.\u201d \u2026 Congress confirmed the Attorney General\u2019s authority to adopt this regulation in the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which made it unlawful for an employer to hire an \u201cunauthorized alien,\u201d defined as one who is not either a lawful permanent resident or \u201cauthorized to be so employed by [the INA] or by the Attorney General.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(h)(3) (emphasis added).\n\nThe OPT program was created at the request of Microsoft and is widely used by many companies to hire foreign graduates instead of American graduates. In 2017, the company employed roughly 1,000 OPT graduates. Lawyers for Microsoft Corp. wrote:\n\nthe statute prohibiting employment of any \u201cunauthorized alien\u201d defines that term to exclude persons \u201cauthorized to be so employed by [the INA] or by the [DHS Secretary].\u201d 8 U.S.C. 1324a(h)(3) (emphasis added). Since 1987, the Secretary has exercised this authority to permit employers to hire numerous categories of noncitizens\u2014ranging from certain persons with pending asylum applications, to non-immigrant students who face unforeseen economic hardship.\n\nNew York\u2019s top lawyers argued, \u201cCongress has both recognized the existence of deferred action and confirmed the DHS Secretary\u2019s authority to make deferred action recipients eligible for work authorization, see 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1154 (deferred action); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(h)(3) (work authorization).\u201d\n\nA group of 165 colleges and universities claimed \u201cwork authorization is not unique to DACA. Rather, it is a product of federal regulations that predate DACA by decades, that have been invoked by administrations of both parties since the 1970s, and that Congress has approved since 1986.\u201d\n\nThe establishment media have ignored the huge 1324a work-permit issue amid favorable coverage of DACA illegals, the \u201cH4EAD\u201d wives of H-1B workers, and the Central American migrants.\n\nDonald Trump's OMB again delays promised end of Obama's @H4EAD work permits for 100K spouses of 800K H-1B visa-workers who take jobs from American college grads. Big giveaway to pro-Dem Silicon Valley investors though T. needs more whte-collr votes in 2020 https://t.co/hPqGWtUW1t \u2014 Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) September 18, 2019\n\n\u201cNo-one wants to talk about it,\u201d said Miano. But \u201cif you say DACA is legal, it is legal for any president to wipe out [numerical] protections for American workers in the immigration system.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is astonishing they are defending a provision that has been most abused by the [presidential] Executives \u2026 to get around the [annual] limit on immigration that Congress has created,\u201d said Jessica Vaughan, policy director at the Center for Immigration Studies. \u201cDefending this [claimed 1324a] authority is giving the [White House] executive branch control over the number of foreign workers in our country, and that authority should rest with Congress.\u201d\n\nThis is amusing: The US biz estb. sign a legal plea to SCOTUS saying the economy shrinks if the 660K DACA workers & consumers go home. But 2 studies cited by biz to justify this obviousness also say Americans' wages go up if the judges strike DACA down. https://t.co/cCXsToIfGh \u2014 Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) October 5, 2019\n\nImmigration Numbers:\n\nEach year, roughly four million young Americans join the workforce after graduating from high school or a university. This total includes about 800,000 Americans who graduate with skilled degrees in business or health care, engineering or science, software, or statistics.\n\nBut the federal government then imports about 1.1 million legal immigrants and refreshes a resident population of about 1.5 million white-collar visa workers \u2014 including approximately one million H-1B workers and spouses \u2014 and about 500,000 blue-collar visa workers. The government also prints more than one million work permits for new foreigners and rarely punishes companies for employing illegal migrants.\n\nThis policy of inflating the labor supply boosts economic growth and stock values for investors. The stimulus happens because the extra labor ensures that employers do not have to compete for American workers by offering higher wages and better working conditions.\n\nThe federal policy of flooding the market with cheap, foreign white-collar graduates and blue-collar labor shifts wealth from young employees toward older investors. It also widens wealth gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, reduces marriage rates, and hurts children\u2019s schools and college educations.\n\nThe cheap-labor economic strategy also pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and it sidelines millions of marginalized Americans, including many who are now struggling with drug addictions.\n\nThe labor policy also moves business investment and wealth from the Heartland to the coastal cities, explodes rents and housing costs, undermines suburbia, shrivels real estate values in the Midwest, and rewards investors for creating low-tech, labor-intensive workplaces.\n\nBut President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cHire American\u201d policy is boosting wages by capping immigration within a growing economy.\n\nThe Census Bureau said September 10 that men who work full-time and year-round got an average earnings boost of 3.4 percent in 2018, pushing their median salaries up to $55,291. Women gained 3.3 percent in wages, bringing their median salaries to $45,097 for full time, year-round work.", "description": "The Department of Justice is backing President Barack Obama's award of work permits to roughly 800,000 'DACA' illegal immigrants.", "authors": ["Neil Munro"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/DACA-aliens-no-papers-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
