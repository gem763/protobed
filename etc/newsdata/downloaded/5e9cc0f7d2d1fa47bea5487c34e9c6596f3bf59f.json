Biden with Ukraine\u2019s president in a July phone call, Mr. Trump responded, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what I discussed.\u201d\n\nThe issue reportedly involves Mr. Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, and his position as director of a Ukrainian gas company while his father was serving as vice president.\n\nMr. Biden urged Ukraine in 2015 to fire its top prosecutor who had been investigating the gas company, with the threat of withholding $1 billion in U.S. aid. The former vice president even boasted about his actions in a speech last year, although he said he forced the issue because the Ukrainian prosecutor wasn\u2019t doing his job properly.\n\nMr. Trump reportedly urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u201cabout eight times\u201d to cooperate with his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani on investigating Hunter Biden, the Wall Street Journal reported Friday.\n\nMr. Giuliani said on CNN \u201cof course\u201d he pressured Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden. He tweeted that a \u201cPresident telling a Pres-elect of a well known corrupt country he better investigate corruption that affects US is doing his job.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump said Mr. Biden\u2019s role in the episode deserves more scrutiny by the media.\n\n\u201cSomebody ought to look into Joe Biden because it was disgraceful, where he talked about billions of dollars that he\u2019s not giving to a certain country, or let\u2019s say certain prosecutors taken off the case,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters. \u201cSomebody had to look into that and you wouldn\u2019t, because he\u2019s a Democrat and the fake news doesn\u2019t look into things like that. It\u2019s a disgrace.\u201d\n\nAsked to confirm whether the conversation with the foreign leader was the July 25 phone call with Mr. Zelensky, Mr. Trump replied, \u201cI really don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nThe inspector general for the U.S. intelligence community received a complaint from a whistleblower in August, and reported later that the complaint was a credible and urgent matter. Congressional Democrats complained Thursday that acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire won\u2019t turn over the complaint to lawmakers.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday the situation presents \u201cgrave, urgent concerns for our national security.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the president has done what has been alleged, then he is stepping into a dangerous minefield with serious repercussions for his administration and our democracy,\u201d she said. \u201cThe president and acting DNI\u2019s stonewalling must end immediately, and the whistleblower must be provided with every protection guaranteed by the law to defend the integrity of our government and ensure accountability and trust.\u201d\n\nShe pledged Friday to explore \u201cevery possible option\u201d in getting at the truth, urging Republicans to join Democrats in \u201csupporting the Constitution.\u201d\n\nA House Democratic leader and member of the Judiciary Committee, Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Island, warned Mr. Trump Friday that lawmakers would consider impeachment for refusing to turn over the whistleblower\u2019s complaint.\n\n\u201cThis is deadly serious,\u201d Mr. Cicilline tweeted. \u201cIf the President does not allow the whistleblower complaint against him to be turned over to Congress, we will add it to the Articles of Impeachment.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump is scheduled to meet with Mr. Zelensky next week at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.\n\nOn Sept. 12, the U.S. agreed to release $250 million in military aid to Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI had conversations with many leaders, they\u2019re always appropriate at the highest level,\u201d the president said. \u201cAnything I do, I fight so strongly for this country. It was a totally appropriate conversation.\u201d\n\nThe president also slammed the U.S. news media for having a bad week, after press reports raised more unsubstantiated allegations against Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s another media disaster, and the media has lost so much credibility in this country, our media has become the laughingstock of the world,\u201d the president told reporters. \u201cYou\u2019re a joke.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump taunted reporters about the whistleblower story: \u201cKeep playing it up because you\u2019re going to look really bad when it falls \u2026 keep asking questions and building it up as big as possible because you can have a bigger downfall.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Tom Howell Jr. contributed to this story.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
