Or worse. None of what they\u2019re saying happened in that phone call!\u201d\n\nLimbaugh then took aim at Fox News, complaining that there are \u201cNever Trumpers all over\u201d the network, mocking those at Fox who have said the call is hard to defend or inappropriate.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing hard to defend about the phone call,\u201d the radio host yelled. \u201cYou just don\u2019t want to defend it!
