He has no mandate for that and is opposed by a majority of the public. Since he became prime minister in July, Johnson has been defeated on every vote he has put to parliament. Now his undemocratic manoeuvrings and his decision to close down parliament and avoid accountability are being challenged in the supreme court. Johnson\u2019s visit to Luxembourg on Monday was a further humiliation. The prime minister went to Europe with no plan and no proposals, and did his best to hide from scrutiny while he was there.\n\nThree years ago Johnson backed Brexit because he thought it would boost his political career \u2013 writing one article in favour of remain and another backing leave. Now he\u2019s backing no deal because he thinks it\u2019s politically expedient \u2013 to win back votes from the Brexit party and keep his Tory Brexit ultras on board. At the same time he needs to look like he\u2019s trying for a deal to hold his cabinet and parliamentary party together.\n\nAmber Rudd quits cabinet and attacks PM for 'political vandalism' Read more\n\nThere is nothing new in Johnson\u2019s shenanigans. Theresa May signed up to contradictory red lines on Brexit to keep the Conservatives from falling apart, and David Cameron called the referendum in the first place to see off the threat from Ukip.\n\nThe Brexit saga of the past few years has been a litany of Tory failures, as one Conservative prime minister after another has put their own and their party\u2019s interests before the interests of the people and our country. Now we face crashing out of the EU next month without a deal, just to save Johnson\u2019s job. We know from Amber Rudd, who resigned from his cabinet this month, that there is little effort going into securing a deal with the EU \u2013 in fact it is hard to see any sign of real effort at all. That came after leaked reports that the prime minister\u2019s negotiations are a \u201csham\u201d and no deal is the real goal.\n\nIn the teeth of No 10 resistance, parliament secured the release of the confidential Yellowhammer papers, setting out the government\u2019s preparations for no deal. The government\u2019s own analysis found the UK would be at risk of food and medicine shortages, and face chaos at key ports. It also exposed that ministers had deliberately misled the public. They told us there would be no food or medicine shortages, when their own internal reports showed that there would be.\n\nYellowhammer has raised the stakes even higher. Johnson\u2019s reckless no-deal Brexit would threaten jobs and living standards and increase food prices. And it would pave the way for a one-sided trade deal with Donald Trump that could only be negotiated from a position of weakness.\n\nWe will give the people the final say, with the choice of a credible leave offer and remain\n\nIt would not be a no-deal Brexit, but a Trump-deal Brexit, with a race to the bottom in our rights and protections sold to US corporations.\n\nNor would no deal be a \u201cclean break\u201d, as some imagine. It would not mean we could \u201cjust get on with it\u201d. In reality it would be the start of a whole new period of confusion and delay, as a string of new agreements would have to be hammered out with the EU \u2013 but this time against a backdrop of rising unemployment, deepening poverty, and entire industries moving offshore.\n\nLabour will do everything necessary to stop a disastrous no deal, with all the chaos, disruption and job losses it would lead to \u2013 and the serious threat it would pose to the Northern Ireland peace process. That\u2019s why we worked with other parties across parliament to pass a law to stop us crashing out at the end of next month.\n\nBut as soon as no deal is off the table, and the prime minister has complied with the law, we need a general election to get rid of Johnson\u2019s Tory government. That election will be about much more than Brexit. It will be a choice between a Labour government that will put wealth and power in the hands of the many, and Johnson\u2019s born-to-rule Conservatives who will look after the privileged few. It will be about who will truly end austerity and deliver the change Britain needs, invest in every region and nation of our country, and rebuild our public services, communities and industry.\n\nThe people of Britain deserve to have their say in a general election. Only a Labour government would end the Brexit crisis by taking the decision back to the people. We will give the people the final say on Brexit, with the choice of a credible leave offer and remain.\n\nCorbyn vows to put 'sensible' Brexit deal to voters in referendum Read more\n\nA Labour government would secure a sensible deal based on the terms we have long advocated, including a new customs union with the EU; a close single market relationship; and guarantees of workers\u2019 rights and environmental protections. We would then put that to a public vote alongside remain. I will pledge to carry out whatever the people decide, as a Labour prime minister.\n\nWe are the only UK-wide party ready to put our trust in the people of Britain to make the decision. Johnson wants to crash out with no deal. That is something opposed by business, industry, the trade unions and most of the public \u2013 and even by the Vote Leave campaign\u2019s co-convener Michael Gove, who said earlier this year: \u201cWe didn\u2019t vote to leave without a deal.\u201d\n\nAnd now the Liberal Democrats want MPs to overturn the referendum result by revoking article 50 in a parliamentary stitch-up. It is simply undemocratic to override the decision of a majority of the voters without going back to the people.\n\nLabour is the only party determined to bring people together, and give the people the final say. Only a vote for Labour will deliver a public vote on Brexit. Only a Labour government will put the power back into the hands of the people. Let\u2019s stop a no-deal Brexit \u2013 and let the people decide.\n\n\u2022 Jeremy Corbyn is leader of the Labour party", "description": "Boris Johnson will crash Britain out of the EU.
