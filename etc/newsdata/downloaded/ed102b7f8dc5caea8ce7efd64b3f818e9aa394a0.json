Even though Neha has explained the story many times, she is still clueless as to what those five simple characters \u2013 no doubt she is the dog \u2013 that Enid Blyton wrote about have to do with their lives.\n\nThis is the problem with books, she thinks. Reality suffers under the gaze of people who read too much and then read too much into life.\n\nThere is no book that will make her life better, no book that will change her father, her mother, the way her food tastes and the manner in which a dog barks.\n\nShe pities Neha, whose literary capacities are overdeveloped to the point of delusion.\n\nFor the rest of them Romeo and Juliet is merely a school setwork to endure, but for Neha it has come to reflect the inner workings of her latest crush.\n\nShe has walked them through it point by point: yes, they can all see the feuding families, the Hindu girl and her Muslim love interest.\n\nBut if these star-crossed lovers were ever found dead, they imagine that there would only be gossip about drugs or brainwashing.\n\nUnlike Neha, they remain doubtful about whether a love of this kind can heal the unspoken animosities or the polite non-mixing of these very different religions.\n\nWhen they set out from the house, they walk all along Rose Avenue, a peculiar rose with its long and straight arrangement of petals.\n\nShejal clutches Kumari\u2019s wicker picnic basket awkwardly as they move quickly on this street; a main vein that connects the residential areas to Top Shops, mothers to groceries, young people to fast food and domestic workers to taxis.\n\nA relative, a family friend, might see them and pull them back into captivity.\n\nJanine feels the most vulnerable in her uniform; a readymade invitation for a bored patrolling policeman.\n\nWho would believe her innocence? Who would believe that she has very little that resembles a casual wardrobe, that her parents don\u2019t even know when her school holidays are and that they have never asked?\n\nA dishevelled man walks in dizzy loops. He crosses their path and the sour stench of stale beer lingers in the air in front of them.\n\n\u201cAh, hallo, Jocelene. Jocelene, hallo,\u201d he slurs.\n\n\u201cUh, hello, Uncle,\u201d says Janine, mortified as her friends\u2019 surprise settles on her.\n\n\u201cJoh, who the fuck was that?\u201d says Shejal when the man staggers away. \u201cEish, you know some hardcore characters, Janine.\u201d\n\n\u201cJocelene,\u201d laughs Neha.\n\n\u201cNo seriously, who was that?\u201d asks Shejal. He has never come that close to a homeless person before.\n\nShe looks up at each of them, their polite faces turned away. She knows they are all equally hungry for a dirty tale; a glimpse at a world that their parents have probably warned them about.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s Alkee Uncle. He stays in the same road as me, or used to stay in the same road. But then his wife threw him out and now he has taken a vow to drink himself to death until she takes him back. He doesn\u2019t eat, just drinks, for breakfast, lunch and supper.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy did she throw him out?\u201d asks Neha.\n\n\u201cCos he was drinking,\u201d says Janine, \u201cbut maybe it\u2019s cos she wanted to be with that coloured man who now stays there with her. Who knows.\u201d\n\nThe Five finally reach the very end of Rose Avenue and pass through the station market of vendors, taxi drivers and travellers.\n\nThey weave through the street-side fruit and vegetables; the bananas, oranges, tomatoes, cabbages, smelling both rancid and ripe.\n\nThey are laid out on colourful plastic plates, measured into fixed prices of five rands.\n\nThere are chicken feet and mielies roasting on fires made inside old oil drums.\n\nLarge women covered in printed blankets nurse their flames. Ripples of heat float through the air and turn the world into wavy sheets of plastic.\n\nThey try hard not to lose each other as their eyes feed on the spectacle of chaos, dirt, life and poverty.\n\nThey cruise amongst the stalls; cheap plastic combs, aprons for domestic workers and frilly dresses for little girls in small, medium and large.\n\nThey pass a makeshift tent with a hairdresser inside. The buzz of the electric razor never pauses.\n\nA board full of painted illustrations of the kind of haircuts one can receive inside stands at the front. The Five stop to look at the beheaded portraits of black men with their neat, cropped sponge-tops.\n\n\u201cAll of those haircuts look the same,\u201d Shejal laughs.\n\n\u201cWell, there isn\u2019t much they can do with their kind of hair,\u201d says Kumari, who secretly sympathises with the stubborn curl that sprouts on African heads.\n\nHer curly, dry bush of hair is nothing like the graceful, whip-in-the-wind manes of Janine and Neha.\n\nShe is the unfortunate kroeshaar of the family, as her grandmother is so fond of pointing out.\n\nKumari constantly wears her hair in a tight bun of necessity and shame.\n\nIt is to train her hair into new thinking and to hide its wicked rebelliousness, just like those men who shear their hair into nullities, never letting the sponge spew out into fully-fledged Afros.\n\nThey continue walking until they reach \u201cthe toppest of Top Shops!\u201d Neha announces it theatrically, in contrast to the lacklustre scene.\n\nA mangy dog pees on a single, drying rose bush in front of the local post office whose red and blue fa\u00e7ade is as cracked and faded as the face of a cheap clown.\n\n\u201cJoh, this is so swak,\u201d Kumari pouts.\n\n\u201cArgh, never mind \u2026 there\u2019s still Suicide Valley to see,\u201d says Devon.\n\n\u201cJa, come,\u201d barks Shejal as he starts marching ahead down Lenasia Drive. \u201cLet\u2019s go gang! Let\u2019s go.\u201d He claps his hands to get them to pick up the pace.\n\nOnce the houses have all but disappeared from view, the stretch of dry veld opens up in front of them. Kumari begins to shiver as the winds lick the fresh sweat from the back of her neck.\n\n\u201cShej, didn\u2019t your mother warn about Suicide Valley?\u201d she asks him in a whisper directed straight into his ear.\n\n\u201cOf course she did, but you should know better than to heed my mother\u2019s warnings by now,\u201d he says as he drags her by the arm.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll never go anywhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho died here anyways? Did anyone really kill themselves here?\u201d asks Neha. \u201cIt\u2019s probably all bull.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d says Janine. \u201cCome, I\u2019ll show you where it was done.\u201d\n\nShe trots ahead of the group as if smelling a trail. She brings them all to a high chain-link fence that circles the quarry.\n\nTheir fingers spill through the holes as they fasten themselves to it, staring down into the muddy water.\n\nThe fence creaks and bends under their weight; they sway along the border of life and death.\n\n\u201cBut what could possibly make you drown yourself?\u201d asks Kumari.\n\n\u201cJa, well, people were poor in those days,\u201d says Neha. \u201cI mean, if you poor, how else would you commit suicide? No pills, no gun, just good old-fashioned drowning.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh ja, and Indian people were dirt poor in those days, neh?\u201d says Kumari, the history of a struggle just dawning on her.\n\n\u201cJa, so poor and they would still have twenty thousand children,\u201d says Devon with a laugh.\n\n\u201cOh God, you should hear my father\u2019s stories about how he had to walk two kilometres with no shoes just to get to school because they were so poor and he had so many brothers and blah, blah, blah\u2026\u201d says Neha.\n\n\u201cEish you should hear my granny\u2019s stories! She\u2019s even worse. She\u2019s got some about how she had to collect cow dung just so that they could use it to cook,\u201d laughs Shejal.\n\nJanine watches the rest of them giggle at these anecdotes, but like Neha\u2019s father, like Shejal\u2019s grandmother, she knows there is nothing funny about being poor.\n\n\u201cI wonder how many people died in here,\u201d she says, still stuck to the fence like a fly in a web. \u201cAnd why.\u201d\n\nA wretched wind begins to blow. In the open field they are left exposed to the blasts that howl around them.\n\nThe reeds in the swamp begin to whip wildly against each other. The birds scatter in disarray and dart above the Five in a panic of having been evacuated without notice.", "description": "In this extract from Nedine Moonsamy\u2019s debut novel, five teenagers from the Indian suburb of Lenasia are on holiday when they decide to break the rules and take a walk to Suicide Valley.", "authors": ["Nedine Moonsamy"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9527/8d737c0ccf79493c948b0c74f52c9ef4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
