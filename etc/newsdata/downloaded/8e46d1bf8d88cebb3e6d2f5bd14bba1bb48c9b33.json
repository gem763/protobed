Mandatory Credit: Mark Konezny-USA TODAY Sports\n\nTom Brady said Monday he won\u2019t ask Rob Gronkowski to end his retirement to return to the New England Patriots.\n\n\u201cI love that guy. I\u2019m so happy that he\u2019s enjoying his time, his life,\u201d Brady said of Gronkowski, who caught 79 touchdown passes at tight end for the Patriots. \u201cHe seems to really be doing a lot of great things. He knows how I feel about him. I want what\u2019s best for him. He\u2019s the only person that can make those decisions. I don\u2019t lobby for those things.\u201d\n\nHe made his comments in his weekly radio appearance on WEEI\u2019s \u201cThe Greg Hill Show.\u201d\n\nGronkowski, 30, hasn\u2019t filed his retirement papers yet, and team owner Robert Kraft told NFL Network last week that he can \u201cpray and hope\u201d that Gronkowski will decide to play again. The Patriots have just two tight ends on the roster.\n\nGronkowski recently joined FOX Sports as an analyst, and he told the network that while he\u2019s physically prepared to play, he isn\u2019t mentally prepared.\n\nBrady said he understands.\n\n\u201cI have a great relationship with him. He\u2019s given a hell of a lot to our team already over a long period of time, and I think people should be very appreciative for what he\u2019s brought to the team and what he\u2019s brought to the region,\u201d the quarterback said. \u201cI think he\u2019s just a very special guy. He\u2019s at a different phase of his life.\u201d\n\nGronkowski played for the Patriots from 2010-18, and his 79 touchdown receptions are the most all-time by a New England receiver. His 7,861 receiving yards are second all-time for the Patriots behind Stanley Morgan (10,352).\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Tom Brady said Monday he won't ask Rob Gronkowski to end his retirement to return to the New England Patriots.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440761014&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D19I-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
