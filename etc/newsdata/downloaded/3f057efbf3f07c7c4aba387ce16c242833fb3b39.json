Desktop users will have access to six tutorials to start, but will have contextual menus to help guide users and explain tool functions.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever tried to follow along with a YouTube tutorial, you may have run into educational roadblocks like finding out that the instructor is using a different version of the software and all the UI elements have shifted positions or the names have changed. Having programmatic tutorials within Lightroom keeps the content evergreen and works especially well for international users by having the content localized in their own language.\n\nLightroom for mobile and desktop is also getting a Share & Invite menu that lets other users make a shared album. The feature works like Google Drive, with a link you can email to collaborators and adjustable permissions that can be set to view-only or grant upload access. Non-Lightroom subscribers can add their photos as well, with photo storage limits counting only toward the album owner.\n\nThere\u2019s also a new texture slider for mobile and desktop versions of Lightroom. It\u2019s good for parts of photos you want to smooth out or highlight, like smoothing the pores of someone\u2019s face, or accentuating details without affecting noise or bokeh.\n\nLightroom mobile users will get a new home view that contains the user\u2019s recent photos. Batch editing is also coming to Lightroom for Android, allowing users to copy settings and apply them to multiple images. You can access the feature by tapping the three-dot menu on the top right of the screen \u2014> Copy Settings \u2014> long press to select mode and choose photos to apply the edits to \u2014> tap the three-dot menu on the top right again \u2014> Paste Settings.\n\nThe updates are available on Lightroom today, and you can read more on Adobe\u2019s blog here.", "description": "Adobe announced the May updates to Lightroom on iOS, Android, and the Creative Cloud desktop app. The photo-editing app will get in-app tutorials that give step-by-step, contextual guidance.", "authors": ["Dami Lee", "May"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m0RA7B8wWRXZaf5L-jS2xWRXxRA=/0x91:2048x1163/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16256401/1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-14"}
