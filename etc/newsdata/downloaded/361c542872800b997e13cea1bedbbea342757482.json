At the time, the company had pledged a hefty $4 billion to the project with hopes the vehicle could make its debut sometime in 2020. But that timing was slightly adjusted last year when Dyson announced plans for a new electric vehicle manufacturing facility in Singapore that was slated to open in 2021.\n\nAccording to James Dyson\u2019s email, the company\u2019s engineers had successfully designed its electric vehicle. But throughout the development process, it became clear that there was no way Dyson could get its creation from the design stage to production and into consumers\u2019 garages while still being a profitable venture for the company.\n\nMoving forward, the company will refocus its efforts on other technologies including batteries, vision systems, as well as robotics and AI, and it\u2019s confident the 600 person team that had been working on the electric car will be able to find roles with the company\u2019s other divisions, products, and R&D efforts.", "description": "Despite developing an expertise in batteries and electric motors over the years with all the R&D behind its cyclone vacuums, in an email sent to staff today that was shared with The Verge, CEO James Dyson announced his company would abandon its plans for an electric car, citing concerns it couldn\u2019t find a way to...", "authors": ["George Dvorsky", "Matt Novak"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/bljip476uaa4h8nvshwn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
