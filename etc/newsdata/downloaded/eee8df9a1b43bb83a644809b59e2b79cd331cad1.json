Often there is a knock-on effect that lingers after the period of load shedding,\u201d Cell C told Business Insider.\n\n\u201cIn some cases, transformers at substations trip and require Eskom manpower to bring those back online, extending the period without power.\u201d\n\n\u201cAdditionally, electricity surges when power returns may mean that equipment at base stations are affected and need to be replaced or rebooted before those sites can be restored.\u201d\n\nTelkom also said the time of network disruption is often lengthened due to vandalisation of some sites.\n\nChristelle Colman, Old Mutual Insure executive for high-net-worth solutions, explained that people tend to forget about the impact of crime during load shedding.\n\n\u201cThe risk of increased opportunistic crime should be top-of-mind for South Africans, considering the load shedding schedule is made public for all \u2013 including criminals \u2013 to see,\u201d Colman said in a statement.\n\nShe said South African businesses should, therefore, ensure that backup batteries and security measures are in place before load shedding occurs.\n\nA previous version of this article was published on February 13, 2019.", "description": "Eskom implemented stage 2 loadshedding on Wednesday - the first time since March.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/1364/0f79644a00e947ce870961fa45159a12.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
