In Minnesota the state claims the authority to do the same to filmmakers. Last month the Eighth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rightly rejected this view.\n\nCarl and Angel Larsen are professional storytellers. Clients hire their firm, Telescope Media Group, to produce short documentaries. The client typically has only a basic idea of the story, so the Larsens have editorial latitude. Their consciences as Christians require that every story honor God, and many clients are religious groups. One project was a documentary for Radical, a Christian ministry, about the spiritual and physical needs of people in the Himalayas.\n\nThey decided to get into the wedding business so they could use their talents to promote their beliefs about marriage. Couples would hire them to produce videos celebrating their nuptials. Like everything else they do, they\u2019d only accept projects that align with their convictions. But as they planned to expand their business, they learned that Minnesota officials took the position, as a state website declares, that \u201cthe law does not exempt individuals, businesses, nonprofits, or the secular business activities of religious entities from non-discrimination laws based on religious beliefs regarding same-sex marriage.\u201d They sued in 2016, and the state affirmed repeatedly in litigation that they\u2019d face punishment if they declined to create marriage films that violated their beliefs.\n\nMinnesota antidiscrimination law provides for criminal penalties, including up to 90 days in jail. The state argued that Telescope was a public accommodation performing a \u201ccommercial activity,\u201d and that the state\u2019s regulatory power included the authority to overrule the Larsens\u2019 editorial decisions.\n\nIn rejecting the argument, the circuit judges noted that the First Amendment protects not only Christians but all of us. By Minnesota\u2019s logic, nothing would stop the state from compelling an atheist musician-for-hire to play an evangelical church service, a Muslim tattoo artist to inscribe \u201cmy religion is the only true religion\u201d on a Christian\u2019s skin, or a Democratic speechwriter to work for a Republican politician.\n\nThe Supreme Court has often affirmed the \u201ccardinal constitutional command\u201d that government cannot force \u201cfree and independent individuals to endorse ideas they find objectionable.\u201d This line of cases runs from West Virginia v. Barnette (1943), holding that Jehovah\u2019s Witness students couldn\u2019t be forced to salute the flag or say the Pledge of Allegiance, to the 2018 cases Nifla v. Becerra and Janus v. Afscme, which involved pro-life pregnancy centers and public employees, respectively.\n\nAlso in 2018 the court decided Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission in favor of Jack Phillips, a Colorado baker who conscientiously objects to same-sex marriage. The justices didn\u2019t reach Mr. Phillips\u2019s free-speech claim, holding instead that the process was unfair because officials were openly hostile to his religious beliefs. Eventually a case like Telescope Media Group will give the justices a chance to resolve the free-speech question they left open and protect the rights of all creative professionals.\n\nMr. Tedesco is a vice president of Alliance Defending Freedom. He represented Telescope Media Group before the Eighth Circuit.", "description": "Minnesota tried to compel Christian filmmakers to celebrate gay marriage.", "authors": ["Jeremy Tedesco"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103271/social"}
