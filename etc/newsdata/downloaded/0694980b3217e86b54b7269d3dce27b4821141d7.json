After a monumental offseason in which eight reigning all-stars changed teams and the Golden State Warriors\u2019 \u201csuperteam\u201d went kaput, the refashioned title landscape is dotted by high-profile superstar pairings.\n\nThe Lakers\u2019 LeBron James and Anthony Davis will do battle with the Clippers\u2019 Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in Los Angeles. Former Oklahoma City Thunder teammates James Harden and Russell Westbrook are reunited on the Houston Rockets. The Warriors return the healthy duo of Stephen Curry and Draymond Green, the Philadelphia 76ers bring back Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons and the Milwaukee Bucks will again turn to Giannis Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton. Even smaller-market contenders such as the Denver Nuggets, Utah Jazz and Portland Trail Blazers will be driven by two-man collaborations.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCommissioner Adam Silver has spent much of his tenure preaching the virtues of parity and competitive balance, all while Big Threes, Big Fours and even the Warriors\u2019 Big Five beat up on the competition. This season boasts more uncertainty at the top than at any point since James joined the Miami Heat in 2011, finally turning Silver\u2019s vision into reality.\n\nThe thrill of the NBA\u2019s new world order derives not just from a more equitable distribution of talent, but from the stylistic intrigue of its fresh partnerships. There simply aren\u2019t modern precedents for how the Lakers, Clippers and Rockets have chosen to build their flashy foundations, and all three teams will be must-see television as they explore uncharted territory.\n\nJames and Davis will likely prove to be the league\u2019s headlining act. Their union was finally consummated, after months of public wooing and tampering allegations, by a risky June blockbuster that joined James, 34, with perhaps the most talented teammate of his 17-year career.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHow often has a playmaker as talented as James been paired with a scorer as gifted as Davis? John Stockton and Karl Malone or Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar come to mind. But James and Davis share a combination of size, power and speed that makes them a one-of-one historical proposition.\n\nThe 26-year-old Davis is an amalgamation of James\u2019s high-profile sidekicks and trusted confidantes from his championship days with the Miami Heat and Cleveland Cavaliers. Like Dwyane Wade and Kyrie Irving, he is a proven lead scoring option. Like Chris Bosh and Kevin Love, he is a versatile big man who can flow from the inside to the perimeter. Like Chris Andersen and Tristan Thompson, he is an authoritative finisher who will feast on James\u2019s lobs and pick-and-roll feeds.\n\nAthletically, Davis belongs in a category all to himself. The 6-foot-10 forward has such long arms that his toes nearly touch the ground when he hangs on the rim, and that wingspan has helped him lead the league in blocks three times. He pirouettes through the paint and spent significant time this summer working on his perimeter scoring arsenal, a la Kevin Durant.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn preseason wins over the Warriors, Davis threw down a variety of dunks in his debut and dished out eight assists in his closing appearance. James was left most impressed not by Davis\u2019s physical feats, but by his mind and complete game.\n\n\u201c[Davis] is a very cerebral player,\u201d said James, who will play point guard this season. \u201cHe\u2019s seen multiple defenders for seven straight years in New Orleans. He\u2019s able to read the defense and create for himself any time. He\u2019s just a matchup problem. Score, rebound and pass: He does it all at a high level.\u201d\n\nIn many ways, the Clippers\u2019 Leonard and George are perfect crosstown foils for James and Davis. While the Lakers\u2019 glitzy duo spent their summer filming \u201cSpace Jam 2,\u201d the low-key Leonard engineered backroom conversations that culminated in the Thunder trading George to the Clippers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAlley-oops from James to Davis are bound to go viral all season, but Leonard and George pride themselves on their two-way play. George, who finished third in 2019 MVP voting, said this summer that he and Leonard, the reigning Finals MVP, practice a \u201clost art\u201d by balancing their scoring responsibilities with high-level defensive commitment.\n\nThere have been some imposing wing duos in recent years: Durant and Klay Thompson won two titles together on the Warriors, just as James and Wade did on the Heat. Neither comparison feels quite right. George is a more accomplished all-around scorer than Thompson, and he is taller, longer and a better outside shooter than Wade.\n\nIn search of the proper archetype for Leonard and George, one NBA executive flirted with basketball sacrilege in July by evoking the Chicago Bulls\u2019 Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen.\n\n\u201cDoc [Rivers] went too far comparing Kawhi to Michael,\u201d an NBA assistant coach said this week, referencing televised comments that got the Clippers\u2019 coach fined for tampering in May. \u201cNo one is Michael. Not Kawhi. Not LeBron. Look it up, though: Paul had better numbers [last year] than Scottie ever had.\u201d\n\nThe Rockets\u2019 duo is so exceptional, meanwhile, that Harden and Westbrook can\u2019t even be compared to the previous version of themselves. Seven years ago, the two star guards were teammates on a rising Thunder squad that reached the 2012 Finals. Harden started just two games that year and wasn\u2019t yet on the all-star radar; Westbrook played second fiddle to Durant and didn\u2019t register a triple-double all season.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs Harden and Westbrook have progressed through their primes, they have come to be defined by their eye-popping stats, individual awards and postseason shortcomings. Harden was named 2018 MVP and averaged 36.1 points per game last season, the most by any player since Jordan in 1987. Westbrook, the 2017 MVP, is the only player since Oscar Robertson to average a triple-double, and he did so in each of the past three seasons.\n\nRemarkably, though, neither Harden nor Westbrook has returned to the Finals since their split. Now, they have been reunited by a trade that sent Chris Paul to Oklahoma City for Westbrook.\n\nWhile the two L.A. products have played up their friendship of nearly 20 years, their shared tendency to dominate the ball presents a central tension. Something \u2014 or someone \u2014 has to give, right?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not on my team, I\u2019ve only got one friend and that\u2019s Spalding,\u201d Westbrook said last month, in what might as well be Houston\u2019s official slogan.\n\nAs recently as 2017-18, Harden and Westbrook ranked in the top two in usage rate and shots per game leaguewide. What\u2019s more, the top two usage rates of all time belong to Westbrook in 2017 and Harden in 2019. Given those extremes, even incredibly top-heavy teams such as Shaquille O\u2019Neal and Kobe Bryant\u2019s Lakers from the early-2000s can\u2019t serve as reasonable models for the Rockets.\n\nFor impartial viewers, Houston\u2019s potential combustibility might be just as compelling as its championship prospects. The same can be said for the new pairings in Los Angeles.\n\nAD\n\nThe reworked NBA now hinges on this question: Which of these young marriages will prove too fragile, and which will last?\n\nAD\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "New-look superstar duos on the Los Angeles Lakers, Los Angeles Clippers and Houston Rockets will shape the 2020 title chase.", "authors": ["Ben Golliver", "Nba Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/a2luQa80S06A_T6Tj3gOrQRIp8o=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6HE2NSHSEQI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
