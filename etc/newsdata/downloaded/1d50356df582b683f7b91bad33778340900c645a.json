Midlife walking speed may show state of brain and body", "language": "en", "text": "Slow walkers beware: A sluggish pace can already signal \u201caccelerated aging\u201d in adults in their 40s, while those who naturally walk more briskly may have younger brains and bodies, a new study has found.\n\nIt\u2019s a health marker anyone can easily measure.\n\nDoctors know a slow walk in elderly people can indicate poor health, but the new research, published last week in JAMA Network Open, examined whether 45-year-old slow walkers would also show signs of physical and mental decline.\n\nGait speed is fascinating because it offers so many clues about a person\u2019s health, even at a younger age, said lead author Line Jee Hartmann Rasmussen, a postdoctoral fellow who researches aging at Duke University.\n\n\u201cThe interesting thing is walking seems like such a simple thing to do, but it requires the function and interplay of a lot of different organ systems,\u201d Rasmussen told TODAY.\n\n\u201cYou need your lungs to function, you need your brain to be well-functioning, your nervous system, your muscles, your aerobic capacity. So that\u2019s why it\u2019s a good indicator of good health.\u201d\n\nShe and her colleagues examined data from the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study, which followed more than 1,000 New Zealanders who were born between 1972 and 1973. Doctors had regularly assessed their health since they were 3 and when they reached 45 years of age, 904 of the participants had their gait speed measured.\n\nThe researchers then estimated how fast they were aging by looking at 19 health markers \u2014 including body mass index, blood pressure, fitness level, cholesterol level and other measures \u2014 plus the rate of facial aging.\n\nThey also considered scans of the participants\u2019 brains and the results of their IQ, memory and learning tests.\n\nThe study then compared people with the slowest average walking speed \u2014 about 3.9 feet per second \u2014 to people with the highest average walking speed \u2014 about 5.7 feet per second.\n\nIt turned out slower gait speed at 45 was already associated with worse physical and cognitive function and an accelerated rate of aging.\n\nSlower walkers showed \u201cmore rapid deterioration of multiple organ systems\u201d and signs of \u201ccompromised structural brain integrity,\u201d including smaller total brain volume, than their faster-walking peers. Their faces also seemed to age faster.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty unconventional at the moment for people in midlife to undergo a gait speed test, but given the findings, it could be a step added to health check-ups, Rasmussen said.\n\n\u201cIt might be very easy because it\u2019s such a simple measure. It doesn\u2019t cost anything, it\u2019s not invasive \u2014 you don\u2019t have to do a blood test or anything. It\u2019s just how fast you walk,\u201d she noted.\n\nHow to measure your own walking speed:\n\nTake two pieces of tape and mark a certain distance, let\u2019s say 6 meters, or almost 20 feet, which was the length used in this study.\n\nWalk that distance at your usual pace while measuring how many seconds it takes you to do that with a stopwatch.\n\nDivide the distance (20 feet in this example) by the time result to give you a certain amount of feet per second.\n\nWhat it all means\n\nIn an accompanying commentary to the study, an expert suggested a walking speed of about 3.6 feet per second or slower should be a \u201ccut point\u201d that potentially means a person in his or her 40s may need interventions to prevent disability and dementia later in life.\n\n\u201cGait speed is a simple, inexpensive indicator of well-being across adulthood. Let\u2019s pay attention and use it,\u201d wrote Dr. Stephanie Studenski, a geriatrician at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.\n\nJust walking faster isn\u2019t the solution for people who naturally walk slower, Rasmussen said. At the same time, they\u2019re also not necessarily doomed to health problems just because they have more sluggish pace, she added.\n\nIt may just be a nudge to focus on better behaviors now, such as not smoking, eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly, to ensure good outcomes down the road.\n\n\u201cIf you live a healthier life and have healthier organs and body functions, then you probably belong in the faster walking group,\u201d Rasmussen said.", "description": "Doctors know a slow walk in elderly people can indicate poor health.
