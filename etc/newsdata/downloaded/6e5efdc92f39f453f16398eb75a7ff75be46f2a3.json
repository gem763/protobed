Janet Mills said, and injured at least six people. It also leveled the building and sent plumes of insulation and loose paper into the air, the debris later settling on the ground like volcanic ash.\n\nMills (D) said on Twitter that the state fire marshal\u2019s office will investigate the explosion.\n\n\u201cOur hearts go out to all those impacted by this tragedy, especially to the loved ones of the firefighter lost and others injured,\u201d Mills said. She later said at a news conference that she knew the firefighter who was killed.\n\n\n\nA man works on Sept. 16 at the scene of a deadly propane explosion that leveled new construction in Farmington, Maine.

There was still insulation falling from the sky like a gentle snow, and first responders were running around trying to administer first aid.\u201d\n\nPhotos taken by Gage show debris-strewn streets and cars with shattered windshields.\n\nRead more:\n\nU.S. officials knew bomb-sniffing dogs were dying from neglect in Jordan.
