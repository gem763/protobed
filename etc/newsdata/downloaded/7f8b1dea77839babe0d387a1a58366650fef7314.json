But that would be direct competition the Chinese companies could not replicate.\n\nRelated: Tencent, Fidelity Back $20 Million Round for Blockchain Firm Everledger\n\n\u201cAny internet company that has a relatively mature digital payment system, such as WeChat Pay and Alipay, would be threatened by the stablecoin if it is ever launched,\u201d the whitepaper reads.\n\nChina\u2019s central bank has been working on its own national digital currency for the past few years, while banning any fiat-to-crypto trading activities in the country since 2017. Neither Tencent nor Alibaba, which operates WeChat Pay\u2019s competitor Alipay, is involved in any known cryptocurrency or trading projects.\n\nWith more than 1 billion active daily users on Tencent\u2019s social media WeChat, its digital payment spinoff WeChat Pay is one of the two leading companies in the industry, along with Alipay, the mobile payment affiliate of Alibaba Group.\n\nBoth WeChat and Alipay have insisted on a firm stance against crypto exchanges using their payment services as a gateway for Chinese customers\u2019 fiat on-ramp in a peer-to-peer fashion through over-the-counter trading.\n\nRelated: BIS Wants \u2018Level Playing Field\u2019 for Banks Amid Threat from Facebook\n\n\u201cWeChat Pay does not support crypto trading, and the platform has never been open to any crypto category,\u201d the company\u2019s official account said in a post on Weibo.\n\n\u201cWe welcome users to report on any crypto trading on our platform and proactively collaborate with authorities to crack down on such activities,\u201d WeChat added in the post.\n\nAlipay also reiterated its ban on crypto trading in a recently tweet directed at Binance when the exchange enabled over-the-counter trading that would allow Chinese users to exchange crypto assets with a counter-party and settle payments via peer-to-peer transactions on Alipay.\n\nAlipay said in the tweet:\n\n\u201cIf any transactions are identified as being related to bitcoin or other virtual currencies, Alipay immediately stops the relevant payment services.\u201d\n\nAnd yet while both Chinese companies share the official stance on crypto assets, they are heavily investing in blockchain and cloud computing technologies.\n\nWeChat parent Tencent has been building a suite of blockchain services since they released their first white paper in 2017.\n\nThe company\u2019s new TrustSQL platform is designed as a three-part system with the core chain layer, a product and service layer, and an application layer to provide digital asset management and authentication.\n\nTencent led a $20 million Series A round in blockchain provenance startup Everledger, also participated in by asset manager Fidelity Investments, in September.\n\nThe company also partnered with Intel to develop a blockchain for internet of things applications, while starting to test blockchain financial applications with the Bank of China in 2017.\n\nIn 2018, Alipay\u2019s parent Alibaba Group actually topped the list with a total of 90 patent applications focused on blockchain-related technologies, even more than other multinational companies including IBM, Mastercard and the Bank of America.\n\n\u201cThe launch of Libra would significantly affect the course of global expansion for digital payment companies, especially for those who are not in the Libra consortium,\u201d Tencent\u2019s whitepaper said.\n\nTencent, with a market cap of nearly $400 billion, has been a communications and internet leader in China since the very beginning. Founded in 1998, the company\u2019s name echos the prior decade\u2019s favorite technology, the belt clip beeper, or pager. Known across China as \u201ccent,\u201d that suffix was added to the last character \u201cteng\u201d of the founder\u2019s name, Huateng Ma, according to Shenzhen tech lore. Tencent\u2019s first product was online software to send messages from computers to pagers.\n\nTencent image via Shutterstock\n\nRelated Stories", "description": "Chinese internet giant and parent of WeChat, Tencent said Libra would pose serious risks to current digital payment systems in the country.", "authors": ["David Pan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/AwmNCx1.GLCS63U9ntxNYQ--~B/aD02Njc7dz0xMDAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/coindesk_75/43677b1cd8fb9685657e8497200ec62c", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
