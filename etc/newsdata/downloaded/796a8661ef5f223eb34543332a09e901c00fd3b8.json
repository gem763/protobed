(Frank Gunn/The Canadian Press)\n\nThose other issues, from Kenney's perspective, are largely tied to pipelines and the province's rich oil sector.\n\nThe Alberta premier finds it particularly irksome that Quebec opposes pipeline development, but, through equalization, ends up benefiting from the profits generated by Alberta's oil.\n\nBut Tombe argues that drawing such a direct line between two provinces when it comes to equalization is flawed.\n\n\"Equalization isn't tied to any particular revenue source. It's certainly not tied to any particular pipeline,\" Tombe said. \"I think the connection is made really just because Quebec is a large recipient of equalization dollars and it's one of the more prominent provinces opposing pipelines through that province in particular.\"\n\nKenney has also said his government is \"prepared to put on the table equalization, by holding a constitutional referendum to end equalization, to assert our fight for fairness to the top of the national agenda.\"\n\nHow equalization works\n\nEqualization is a federal program that provides unconditional transfer payments to lower income provinces to help address fiscal disparity across the country and allow for comparable public services from coast to coast.\n\n(The territories are given federal funding through a separate program, known as the Territorial Formula Financing program.)\n\nAs Tombe once wrote in a CBC Opinion piece, \"provinces with stronger economies get less (or none) while provinces with weak economies get more.\"\n\nEqualization entitlements are determined by measuring provinces' ability to raise revenues, known as \"fiscal capacity.\"\n\n\"If you're below average, you get equalization; if not, you don't,\" Tombe wrote.\n\nCurrently, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec and Manitoba receive equalization payments.\n\nClarifying who pays\n\nPremiers often talk about their respective provinces and taxpayers paying for equalization.\n\nThere is confusion around Canada's equalization payment program. But it is designed so that every Canadian, no matter where he or she lives, would receive comparable services at comparable rates of taxation. (Graeme Roy/The Canadian Press)\n\nBut the money for the equalization payments comes from federal general revenue, like income and corporate taxes, the GST, and tariffs on imports that all Canadians pay into.\n\nThis means, for example, the province of Alberta doesn't write the province of Quebec or the Government of Canada a cheque to pay for its share of equalization. But it also means that Canadians with higher incomes will pay more into the equalization program, much like Canadians with higher incomes pay higher rates of income tax.\n\nBecause a lot of high-income individuals live in Alberta, they do pay a larger share of the federal budget \u2014 and an equal amount of federal spending does not end up back in Alberta.\n\nThis year, the federal government will transfer more than $78 billion to the provinces, $19 billion of which is delivered under equalization.\n\nOpt out?\n\nSince equalization payments are collected from federal general revenue, Alberta can't just withdraw from the program because there is no \"equalization fund.\"\n\n\"The design of the equalization program itself is 100 per cent federal. The provinces have no role in terms of the design and implementation of that program,\" Tombe said.\n\nEqualization is entrenched in the Canadian Constitution, which states that \"Parliament and the Government of Canada are committed to the principle of making equalization payments.\"\n\nPutting an end to equalization payments would require a constitutional amendment \u2014 something unlikely, since two-thirds of the provinces would need to support such a change.\n\nEqualization discouraging resource development?\n\nPart of Kenney's complaint is that \"other provinces benefit from equalization payments generated, in part, from our energy resources, while refusing to develop their own energy resources.\"\n\nTodd MacKay, the prairie director of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, says he believes provinces that receive equalization are disincentivized to develop their own resources. When his home province of Saskatchewan was a so-called \"have not\" province, he said he believes many decisions were coloured by how it might affect their payments.\n\n\"It was worse for us when we got money than it is now when we lose money,\" he said.\n\nQuebec Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault has said there's no appetite for a new pipeline in his province, which puts him at odds with Alberta Premier Jason Kenney, who argues pipelines to Canada's coast are essential for the prosperity of all Canadians. (Mark Blinch/Reuters)\n\nThis issue is something the equalization formula grappled with since its very beginning, Tombe said.\n\nThe reason the federal government includes only 50 cents of each dollar of resource revenue in the calculation is, in part, a compromise between two competing considerations, he said. Including 100 per cent of resource revenues would mean that if a recipient province earned a dollar in additional resource revenue, they would see their equalization fall by a dollar.\n\n\"And that would completely eliminate the incentive,\" Tombe said. \"For incentive reasons, you want to include zero, but for comparability reasons, you want to include 100 per cent. [The compromise was] they went with 50.\"\n\nProblems and possible fixes\n\nIt has certainly been noted that the Alberta premier is complaining about an equalization formula that was last adjusted in 2009 by Stephen Harper's Conservative government, of which Kenney was a cabinet minister.\n\n\"If Kenney hates the current formula so much, why didn't he do something about it when had the chance,\" asked an article published in Policy Options last year.\n\nThe piece also noted problems with equalization, including that the fiscal capacity of non-receiving provinces has shrunk, while the fiscal capacity of the recipient provinces has increased.\n\n\"As a result, the disparity between receiving provinces' fiscal capacity and the national average has narrowed.\"\n\nAlso, it argues that just using fiscal capacity of a province as the measurement \"provides an incomplete picture of the ability of a province to provide public services,\" due to differences in demographics and costs of providing services.\n\nTombe says there's no prospect for large-scale changes to equalization \u2014 but there could be room for tweaks.\n\nFor example, Kenney had proposed removing resource revenues from the calculation, which would have the effect of increasing payments to Quebec and decreasing payments to the Maritimes.\n\nShifting the sources of federal revenue to sources that are less sensitive to income is one way to shrink the gap instead, said Tombe.\n\n\"If someone wants to make the case that we should increase the GST and decrease the income taxes in order to even out federal revenue and spending across the country, that would be an entirely logical and fair position to take,\" he said.\n\n\"But then I look back to 2006, and what was the signature tax policy change of the newly elected government, of which Kenney was a part? It was to decrease the GST instead of decreasing income taxes.\"", "description": "Alberta Premier Jason Kenney finds it particularly irksome that Quebec opposes pipeline development,\u00a0but,\u00a0through equalization payments, is benefiting from high-income Albertans and the profits generated from the province's oil.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5335331.1572054636!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/jason-kenney-in-oct-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
