History", "language": "en", "text": "For its 150th anniversary, the American Museum of Natural History is celebrating its many historic moments, from its 1869 founding, to the 1902 discovery of the first T-Rex skeleton, to the creation of the Teddy Roosevelt statue erected out front in 1940.\n\nOne milestone not on that list: the biggest jewel heist in New York history, when the Star of India, a 563-carat sapphire the size of a golf ball, was snatched from its display case, along with the rare Eagle Diamond, the DeLong Star Ruby and some 20 other precious gems from a collection donated to the museum by J.P. Morgan.\n\nFor several months beginning in October 1964, the city was transfixed by the brazen robbery that the tabloids immediately labeled the heist of the century.\n\nThe culprits were not ordinary thieves. They were sharply dressed surfer dudes on a spree that took them from their base in Miami Beach up to their lair in New York, a penthouse suite in a Manhattan hotel. They were caught within two days of the crime, but the jewels remained missing. After a wild escapade in Miami \u2014 an unorthodox excursion involving a rented convertible \u2014 many of the gems were recovered, including the Star of India, which was promptly put on solo display in the museum\u2019s main floor rotunda \u2014 this time, with its own security guard and safe.", "description": "For a few months in 1964, \u201cMurph the Surf\u201d and his crew became folk heroes when they looted the Hall of Gems from the American Museum of Natural History.", "authors": ["Corey Kilgannon"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/20/nyregion/20jpMURPH1/18jewel-heist1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
