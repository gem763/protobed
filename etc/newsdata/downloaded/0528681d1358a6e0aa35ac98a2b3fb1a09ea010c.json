More than a dozen investigations of the Catholic church were announced last year in the United States, with other scandals among Southern Baptists and evangelical churches.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nExperts broadly agree on best practices for church leaders to come forward in abuse cases, but a lack of data and the historical underreporting of sex abuse in the church can make it difficult to know how to address it.\n\n\u201cThis issue should never be behind us,\u201d said Boz Tchividjian, executive director of the nonprofit Godly Response to Abuse in the Christian Environment. \u201cIt should always be on our radar screen.\u201d\n\nTchividjian, a former child abuse prosecutor and grandson of famed evangelist Billy Graham, founded GRACE to help churches respond to sexual abuse allegations and prevent them from happening again. He describes fighting abuse as a \u201ccultural transformation\u201d in churches that could take generations.\n\nAD\n\nThe first steps to take when abuse is suspected or reported are clear, experts say: Church leaders should contact law enforcement rather than rely on internal investigations. Accused people should step down from positions of power. Despite Christian dogma to the contrary, victims and perpetrators shouldn\u2019t necessarily reconcile, or be encouraged to.\n\nAD\n\nResponsibility for handling abuse cases extends beyond church leadership. Experts say congregants should be prepared to support victims during a reconciliation process that might not have a tidy ending. They might also need training in how to prevent or report sexual abuse.\n\n\u201cChurches want an easy way out \u2014 watch an online video, take a quiz and boom, you\u2019re a safer church,\u201d Tchividjian said. \u201cThat\u2019s a false narrative.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn 2010, the Rt. Rev. Sean Rowe found himself looking for a way through one such scandal that some thought he never should have taken responsibility for.\n\nRowe, who is now the bishop of the Episcopal dioceses of Northwestern Pennsylvania and Western New York, encouraged survivors to come forward with stories about his predecessor, who had abused girls as young as 10 during more than 20 years. Rowe said he was criticized for acknowledging the allegations, for which his diocese took hits to its reputation and its pocketbook.\n\nAD\n\nThe diocese repented and tried to do right by its victims, he said \u2014 while for those directly affected, it could never do enough. Rather than move past the scandal, he said it is \u201cnow an important part of who we are.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be the focus of our life and ministry,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we must keep it in front of us.\u201d\n\nA new face in a time of crisis\n\nIn Lauren\u2019s case, her abuser was swiftly caught and convicted as her struggle with PTSD began. She reached a settlement with her Virginia church, but feels abandoned by a faith community she once felt part of.\n\n\u201cEvery single thing in life comes back to Derrick,\u201d said Lauren, 20. \u201cI don\u2019t know about normal love. \u2026 It\u2019s just ruined everything for me.\u201d\n\nDerrick Ryan Trump came to Greenwich Presbyterian Church near Nokesville, Va., in 2010 and was named director of youth ministries. Then in his early 20s, Trump planned Sunday school classes, youth group meetings and mission trips. He often taught a church training course on sexual harassment, according to documents filed in Fauquier County General District Court in Virginia.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump, who didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment, came to Greenwich at a difficult time in Lauren\u2019s life. Her parents had recently separated.\n\n\u201cWith my dad gone, I was left very vulnerable,\u201d Lauren said. \u201cI started talking to Derrick. Once a month, I\u2019d meet him in his office. He slowly became a huge part of my life.\u201d\n\nIn court documents, prosecutors said Trump kissed Lauren for the first time on May 17, 2016, at his Fauquier County home. That night on the phone, they discussed sex. Trump was 28. Lauren, 16.\n\nThe next day, Trump picked Lauren up at Panera Bread. He drove her to his house and sexually abused her, prosecutors said. Afterward, he dropped her off at Panera, where her mother picked her up. They attended church with the youth group that night \u201clike nothing had happened,\u201d according to court filings.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBefore they had sex, they discussed that what they were doing was wrong,\u201d prosecutors wrote. \u201cThe defendant stated that he was willing to face the consequences for his actions.\u201d\n\nThe secret didn\u2019t last long. Within two weeks, the physical contact was over. Trump told Lauren he had \u201ca sex addiction,\u201d according to court documents; he told his wife and Lauren\u2019s mother, Cherie, about their contact on May 27, 2016. Cherie was appalled and contacted police.\n\n\u201cI was in shock,\u201d Cherie said. \u201cIt was like I was not even in my body.\u201d\n\nTrump was fired from the church. He faced criminal charges of taking indecent liberties with a child by a person in a custodial or supervisory relationship in Fauquier County, where he lived, and Prince William County, the location of the church. His home was searched, bedsheets taken as evidence. He was assigned a risk score indicating he was a lower-level sex offender, and in November 2016, he pleaded guilty to taking indecent liberties with a child.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s attorney, Nadir N. Tawil, said it \u201clooked like love\u201d to his client, adding that Trump confessed to the crimes and apologized to Lauren and the church. \u201cThis destroyed him,\u201d Tawil said.\n\nIn January, Lauren\u2019s older sister filed a police report claiming Trump sexually assaulted her in 2014, two years before his arrest in Lauren\u2019s case. Prosecutors declined to bring charges, saying the statute of limitations had passed.\n\nAt Greenwich Presbyterian Church and in the Griffis home, a cycle of anger, recriminations, denial and healing was about to begin.\n\n'It was clear we were being shunned'\n\nThe family never returned to services. Lauren was discouraged from going on a mission trip, she said. As the Griffis family tells it, some church peers stopped speaking to her, unfriended her on Facebook and told her that she \u201cruined\u201d the youth group.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt was clear we were being shunned,\u201d Cherie said.\n\nLauren said she felt compelled to speak out, worried the congregation might think of her as the \u201cother woman\u201d in a \u201clove story\u201d with a married man when she was the victim of a sex crime that resulted from failures in Greenwich\u2019s leadership.\n\nThe church didn\u2019t respond to specific claims the Griffis family made, but said in a statement that Greenwich \u201cremains attentive to the profound impact that our former youth director\u2019s sexual abuse has had upon Lauren.\u201d\n\nThe statement continued: \u201cAs Lauren tells her story, we pray it will deepen her own healing journey and that her courage will help other victims of sexual abuse find hope and strength. From the beginning of this sad ordeal we have expressed transparency and confidentiality. Out of respect for Lauren and her family, we remain circumspect in offering public statements. We continue to stand with Lauren and all survivors of sexual abuse, and pray for the end of this scourge upon the broader church and society.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAs Trump\u2019s case wound through the legal system, Lauren attended Camp Cadi, a week-long summer camp for young survivors of sexual abuse, in Dallas, Ga.\n\nAmy Barth, a therapist and sexual abuse survivor who founded the camp in 2005, said the focus is on giving girls \u201c the childhood they lost at the time of the abuse.\u201d Mornings are devoted to therapy, and afternoons are like \u201cregular camp,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s harder to heal when you\u2019re older,\u201d she said. \u201cThe more skills we give them \u2014 coping skills, the knowledge that other girls experience the same things \u2014 we get them grounded, and it\u2019s less likely they will have the same level of PTSD.\u201d\n\nLauren said she left the camp with \u201ca very different mind-set.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am realizing everything that happened to me and everything that church did and didn\u2019t do to protect me,\u201d she said. \u201cI said, \u2018I want to hire a lawyer.\u2019 \u201d\n\nShe called Pennsylvania attorney Nate Foote, who represents crime victims, including survivors of sexual assault.\n\nLauren\u2019s case caught his eye because he\u2019s originally from nearby Manassas, he said. He also thought the case was viable: Greenwich was an institutional defendant, and Trump an admitted abuser.\n\nLauren said she had asked for $350,000 and a public apology. She got a private apology and $40,000, after costs and fees. She got a new car. She got Paddington, her PTSD dog, who cost $2,000 and an additional $3,000 to train.\n\nSoon, the money was gone and Trump was out of jail, living a few miles away. Without her old church and her friends, Lauren had to find her own way forward.\n\n'Preach it on a Sunday morning'\n\nAfter Trump\u2019s arrest, the Griffis family expected to return to friends, family and their church community. It didn\u2019t feel that way.\n\n\u201cVery few people have spoken to me over the past couple of years, but when they have, it has been nothing but disrespect, re-victimizing, shaming, concern for Trump or asking why I\u2019ve acted the way I have,\u201d Lauren wrote in an email. \u201cNone of them protected me, and what\u2019s worse is, no one supported me after it happened.\u201d\n\nDon Meeks, Greenwich\u2019s pastor, grappled with whether Lauren should address the Greenwich community about her abuse. Trump had abused Lauren on his watch.\n\n\u201cNone of us knew what we were looking at,\u201d he told Lauren and her mother as they sat across from him at a Virginia Starbucks. During the meeting, which was attended by a Washington Post reporter, he called the abuse \u201cpart of a broken world we live in.\u201d\n\nLauren invited The Post to the meeting, saying she wanted a reporter to witness Meeks\u2019s atonement.\n\nAfter the lawsuit, he was the one who privately apologized to Lauren for the abuse she suffered at the church. This was a new era, he said \u2014 a \u201c#MeToo, #ChurchToo\u201d era where allegations against powerful men had raised awareness about sexual assault.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m paddling as fast as I can to catch up,\u201d he told Lauren. \u201cYou\u2019re feeling you are silenced. That was never my intention. I\u2019m in a tight spot as a leader. \u2026 I\u2019m not asking for your sympathy; I\u2019m asking for your understanding.\u201d\n\nLauren thought she should come to church and tell her story.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love you to preach it on a Sunday morning,\u201d she told Meeks.\n\nDuring the meeting with Meeks, Lauren said church parishioners \u201clook at me like I\u2019m the other woman. I need some way to express my side of the story.\u201d\n\nMeeks said the story was alive at Greenwich. Policies had been reviewed. He was meeting with church elders to discuss it. He needed time to educate others as she was educating him.\n\n\u201cMy commitment from the beginning has to be \u2014 and this is not to get in front of the story \u2014 is to tell the truth,\u201d he said.\n\nBefore Meeks left the coffee shop, he told Lauren and Cherie the conversation would continue, if they wanted it to continue. Lauren and Cherie haven\u2019t been back to church, a place Lauren says triggers symptoms of PTSD after her experiences.\n\n\u201cIf you never want to talk to me again, I get that,\u201d Meeks said.\n\nOutspoken after years of silence\n\nThe Rev. Ashley Easter, grandchild of two pastors of a Baptist church, said she knows what it\u2019s like to leave a church behind. She was taught \u201cwomen were to be in submission\u201d and said she was sexually harassed by a Christian author as a teenager.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I was 21 \u2014 when I was introduced to equality for women from a biblical perspective \u2014 that it helped me break free from this toxic patriarchal ideology, to come to grips with the ways the patriarchy influenced abuse I experienced,\u201d she said.\n\nNow ordained through the Progressive Christian Alliance, a network of liberal Christians founded in 2008, she\u2019s the founder of an annual conference for sexual abuse survivors. Abuse should be a regular sermon topic, she said, noting that one-third of women and one-sixth of men experience abuse in their lifetime.\n\n\u201cIt should be a normal part of church,\u201d she said. \u201cI think an ongoing conversation is something every church should have whether or not they had a big scandal. We talk about missions all the time. There\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t talk about people who have been hurt.\u201d\n\nChrista Brown , a survivor of sexual abuse who has written about sex crimes in Baptist churches, said those abused in faith communities face \u201can extra dimension of spiritual harm.\u201d Prosecution is rare, and even when perpetrators go to prison or churches offer recompense, it might not help victims, Brown said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a soul-murdering kind of offense,\u201d she said.\n\nLauren has jobs as a dance teacher and an assistant for a real estate agent, but \u201ctriggers are everywhere,\u201d she said. She\u2019s working toward a bachelor\u2019s degree online, uncomfortable with communicating with professors in person. She rarely goes anywhere without Paddington, and doesn\u2019t sleep much. She can\u2019t have an intimate relationship, she said.\n\nEven prayer makes her think of Trump.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not comfortable with prayer,\u201d Cherie said. \u201cDerrick ruined it for her.\u201d\n\nHer PTSD can be a problem at work, at school \u2014 in any situation involving physical contact or involving a man. It doesn\u2019t help that her abuser shares a surname with the president of the United States.\n\nShe can imagine a time when she can advocate for victims of sexual assault. The legal system dealt with Trump while keeping her an anonymous victim. Church members dismissed and excluded her, she said, and wouldn\u2019t listen to her or her family.\n\n\u201cI wanted my voice to be heard,\u201d Lauren said. \u201cEveryone got a voice. I did not.\u201d", "description": "Church leaders are increasingly becoming transparent with congregants\u00a0about allegations in the MeToo era.", "authors": ["Justin Wm.
