But no tariffs will be imposed on EU-made aircraft parts used in Airbus\u2019 Alabama assembly operations or those used by rival U.S. planemaker Boeing Co (BA.N), safeguarding U.S. manufacturing jobs.\n\n\u201cFinally, after 15 years of litigation, the WTO has confirmed that the United States is entitled to impose countermeasures in response to the EU\u2019s illegal subsidies,\u201d U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe expect to enter into negotiations with the European Union aimed at resolving this issue in a way that will benefit American workers,\u201d Lighthizer added.\n\nThe tariffs heavily target the four Airbus consortium countries, including Spanish olives, British sweaters and woollens, and German tools and coffee, as well as British whisky and French wine. Cheese from nearly every EU country will be hit with the 25% tariffs, but Italian wine and olive oil were spared, along with European chocolate.\n\nThe size and scope of the tariffs were reduced considerably from a $25 billion list floated by Washington earlier this year that included helicopters, major aircraft components, seafood, luxury goods and other big-ticket categories that were excluded from Wednesday\u2019s announcement.\n\nOne person familiar with the case said the USTR was deliberately not using the full extent of WTO-approved retaliation to coax the EU to the negotiating table.\n\nBut it came with an explicit warning.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. has the authority to increase the tariffs at any time, or change the products affected. USTR will continually re-evaluate these tariffs based on our discussions with the EU,\u201d the USTR said.\n\nNEW TRADE WAR FRONT\n\nThe USTR has sought WTO ratification of its tariff list by Oct. 14. The duties could come into force just three days after a scheduled Oct. 15 tariff increase on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, to 30% from 25%.\n\nAs Washington and Beijing try to ease their bitter 15-month trade war, the U.S.-EU trade spat looks set to worsen.\n\nAirbus spokesman Clay McConnell said the France-based planemaker was evaluating the list and its possible consequences in \u201cclose collaboration with the European Commission.\u201d\n\nThe WTO, he said, in coming months would grant the EU authority to impose tariffs on U.S. goods over its findings of illegal subsidies for Boeing from Washington state that could equal or exceed the U.S. tariffs.\n\n\u201cAirbus considers that the only way to prevent the negative effects that these countermeasures would create will be for the U.S. and EU to find a resolution to this long-running dispute through a negotiated settlement before the tariffs become effective,\u201d he said.\n\nFILE PHOTO: An Airbus A350 takes off at the aircraft builder's headquarters in Colomiers near Toulouse, France, September 27, 2019.

Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) said it has about 170 Airbus planes on order that could be affected.\n\n\u201cAircraft are significant purchases requiring long-lead times for production - often years in advance,\u201d Delta said in a statement. \u201cImposing tariffs on aircraft that U.S. companies have already committed to will inflict serious harm on U.S. airlines, the millions of Americans they employ and the traveling public.\u201d\n\nBroad selling amid worries over slowing global growth that punished European stocks earlier on Wednesday accelerated as the ruling revived worries about damage to the already-ailing European economy. The pan European STOXX 600 index finished down 2.7%, its worst day since December 2018. Airbus shares closed down 2%.\n\nWall Street\u2019s main indexes suffered their sharpest one-day declines in nearly six weeks on Wednesday after employment and manufacturing data suggested the U.S.-China trade war is taking an increasing toll on the U.S. economy.\n\nWAR OF ATTRITION\n\nAirbus and Boeing, the world\u2019s two largest planemakers, have waged a war of attrition over subsidies at the WTO since 2004 in a dispute that has tested the trade policeman\u2019s influence and is expected to set the tone for competition from would-be rivals from China.\n\nThe WTO had already found that both Airbus and Boeing received billions of dollars of illegal subsidies in the world\u2019s largest corporate trade dispute. The global trade body is due to decide early next year on the level of annual tariffs the EU can impose on U.S. imports.\n\nWhile the level of tariffs amounts to less than three days\u2019 worth of trade between Europe and the United States, importers led by U.S. airlines that buy Airbus jets have urged Washington to be selective when choosing industries to hit in order to avoid causing collateral damage to the U.S. economy.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A logo is pictured outside the World Trade Organization (WTO) headquarters next to a red traffic light in Geneva, Switzerland, October 2, 2018. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/File Photo\n\nEU manufacturers are already facing U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum and a threat from U.S. President Donald Trump to penalize EU cars and car parts. The EU has in turn retaliated.\n\nThe Trump administration believes tariffs were effective in bringing China to the negotiating table over trade and in convincing Japan to open its agricultural market to U.S. products.\n\n(For a graphic on U.S.-EU trade - here)", "description": "The United States on Wednesday said it would slap 10% tariffs on European-made Airbus planes and 25% duties on French wine, Scotch and Irish whiskies, and cheese from across the continent as punishment for illegal EU aircraft subsidies.", "authors": ["Tim Hepher", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436274677&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF910SL"}
