And when his representative Barnett did set-up an exit from the club Real Madrid renegaded at the last minute because the transfer to Jiangsu Suning was for a nominal transfer fee of under 10m euros (\u00a38.6m).\n\nSportsmail understands meeting was routine between Bale and Jonathan Barnett (pictured)\n\nHaving originally been skeptical about the switch Bale who has won four Champions Leagues at Real Madrid, had come around to the idea of becoming the biggest transfer to China in the history of the Chinese Super League.\n\nDiario AS reported on Monday lunchtime that the club were now contemplating Bale leaving in January.\n\nBut the Bale camp are not optimistic that the Madrid board's stance of not allowing him go on a near-free transfer, just to get him off the wage bill, is about to change.\n\nThat would see Bale remain at the club, at least, until the end of the season but the player is understood to still be primarily focused on trying to get back to full fitness so he can help salvage Wales' qualification to Euro 2020.", "description": "Gareth Bale flew to London to meet with his agent on Monday sparking more speculation that the Wales international remains unsettled in the Spanish capital.", "authors": ["Pete Jenson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/15/20284686-0-image-a-4_1572275680908.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
