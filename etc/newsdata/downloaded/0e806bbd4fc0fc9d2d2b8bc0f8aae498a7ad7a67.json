They think that reporters and Republicans and her rivals onstage are just looking for a sound bite about raising taxes, an \u201cAha!\u201d to stick her with all the way through the primaries, and perhaps through Election Day. They clearly take pride in not playing the game the way political insiders and Twitter critics want them to. They can also take solace in the fact that, in the month since the previous debate, when the ABC News moderator George Stephanopoulos pressed her on the tax question, her poll numbers have continued to go up.\n\nBut life\u2019s different now as the front-runner. Last night\u2019s debate made clear that Warren\u2019s Democratic opponents feel like the primary revolves around her now, with most of the 11 other candidates onstage taking swings at her and seeming to forget that former Vice President Joe Biden, until now the focus of the race, was even there. In a statement following the debate, Warren\u2019s communications director, Kristen Orthman, brushed off the attacks from other candidates: Warren\u2019s momentum comes from \u201crunning a campaign of substance,\u201d and \u201cshe took heat tonight as a result of that momentum.\u201d\n\nRead: The Democrats\u2019 new war on Warren\n\nIn the spin room afterward, the other candidates and their surrogates kept up the Warren criticism, in a sign that the next phase of the race could be even more Warren-centric. Her avoidance of the taxes question \u201churts her brand,\u201d Dayton, Ohio, Mayor Nan Whaley told me, after she popped into the spin room on behalf of South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, one of the candidates who went after Warren the hardest.\n\nJeff Weaver, Sanders\u2019s chief strategist, resisted a question from another reporter asking if Warren was dishonest, but he argued that his own boss was being \u201cstraightforward\u201d in saying that raising taxes would help pay for Medicare for All. \u201cThat\u2019s the honest answer; that\u2019s the only answer,\u201d he told me when I followed up.\n\nWhen I asked whether Warren was living up to her reputation as a truth-teller, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey said he wasn\u2019t going to attack anyone, but he made sure to point out that he wants to be defined by his own \u201cutter candor.\u201d\n\nFormer Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas wasn\u2019t so delicate. Was she telling the truth? I asked. \u201cShe failed to do that tonight, and she\u2019s failed to do that in previous debates,\u201d O\u2019Rourke replied. \u201cAnd I think on an issue as important as health care, and an issue as important as taxes on the middle class, this country deserves to hear the truth.\u201d\n\nObviously, these are all people who don\u2019t want to see Warren become the Democratic nominee. So I walked over to two women who do: Representative Deb Haaland of New Mexico and California Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez Fletcher. Both have endorsed Warren, and they were among the official representatives of her campaign in the spin room.", "description": "She\u2019s presented herself as the truth-teller, the straight-talker, the one who can break down complex economic ideas and bring nonprogressives along.", "authors": ["Edward-Isaac Dovere"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/AP_19289169736884/facebook.jpg?1571228605", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
