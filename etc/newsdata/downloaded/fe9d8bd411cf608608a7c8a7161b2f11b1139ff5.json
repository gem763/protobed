It didn\u2019t matter, though as Cishek (3-6) walked Margot to bring in Luis Urias with the winning run.\n\nUrias started the winning rally when he beat out an infield single to shortstop with one out. Austin Hedges and Travis Jankowski walked to load the bases and bring up Margot.\n\nRookie Michel Baez (1-1) pitched the 10th for the win.\n\nBryant\u2019s second homer pulled the Cubs to 8-7 after Anthony Rizzo hit a leadoff single in the eighth. Heyward tied it with his second of the night, a one-out shot to straightaway center. Both came off rookie Andr\u00e9s Mu\u00f1oz.\n\nBryant, who missed the previous two games with a sore right knee that required a cortisone shot on Sunday, has 28 overall and Heyward 21. It was the second multihomer game of the season for both players. Bryant has 12 multihomer games in his career while Heyward has eight.\n\nHeyward hit a two-run homer with one out in the second, with Bryant aboard on a leadoff walk.\n\nThe Padres went ahead 5-2 in the bottom of the inning, when second baseman Ben Zobrist\u2019s throwing error on rookie starter Ronald Bola\u00f1os\u2019 bases-loaded grounder allowed two runs to score. Bola\u00f1os was credited with his first RBI. Also in the inning, Urias hit an RBI single and Nick Martini had a sacrifice fly.\n\nRookie Ty France\u2019s homer with two outs in the third gave San Diego a four-run lead.\n\nThe Cubs got a run in the fourth thanks to video review. Heyward was originally called out on Martini\u2019s throw home on Ian Happ\u2019s fly ball to left, but the call was overturned after a review and Happ was credited with a sacrifice fly.\n\nBryant\u2019s two-run homer with two outs in the fifth pulled the Cubs to 6-5.\n\nSan Diego went up 8-5 in the seventh when Margot\u2019s hit an RBI triple and scored on Martini\u2019s single.\n\nBola\u00f1os, making his second big league start, allowed five runs and five hits in five innings. He struck out five and walked two. The 23-year-old was promoted Sept. 2 after splitting his third minor league season between Single-A Lake Elsinore and Double-A Amarillo.\n\nCubs starter Jose Quintana went just three innings, giving up six runs - four earned - on seven hits. He struck out one and walked none.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nCubs: INF Addison Russell remained in the concussion protocol after being beaned in Sunday\u2019s game at Milwaukee.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCubs: LHP Cole Hamels (7-6, 3.95), who attended San Diego\u2019s Rancho Bernardo High, is scheduled to start Wednesday night. He is 9-2 with a 2.45 ERA in 18 career starts against the Padres.\n\nPadres: Rookie RHP Chris Paddack (8-7, 3.54) will face the Cubs for the first time. On San Diego\u2019s last road trip, he threw 12 1/3 innings of one-run ball in starts against San Francisco and Arizona.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Manuel Margot drew a four-pitch, bases-loaded walk with one out in the 10th inning and the San Diego Padres overcame an impressive power display by Kris Bryant and Jason Heyward to beat the Chicago Cubs 9-8 Tuesday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Bernie Wilson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/11/cubs_padres_baseball_53521_c0-185-4428-2766_s1770x1032.jpg?48019194fbceb354727ad76508da35331fe8df11", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
