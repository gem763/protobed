I would have thought that similar memos fly around the BBC every day.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

bid to remove Watson by abolishing the deputy leader\u2019s position, but Labour\u2019s ruling National Executive Committee agreed new rules allowing the left-dominated body to appoint an interim successor if the leader resigns or is incapacitated, rather than the deputy automatically taking over.\n\nThe manoeuvring over Mr Watson\u2019s position has sparked speculation that factions within Labour are preparing for a handover of power by 70-year-old Mr Corbyn, amid claims that he is tiring of the job.\n\nBut asked whether he was considering retirement, Mr Corbyn dismissed the suggestion as \u201cwishful thinking by some people\u201d and insisted he was \u201cenjoying\u201d the work.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m taking the party into the general election,\u201d he said.\n\nChallenged over whether he would serve a full five-year term as prime minister, which would see him in Downing Street until he hits 75 in 2024, he replied: \u201cOf course, why wouldn\u2019t I? I\u2019m very surprised at this question.\u201d\n\nMr Corbyn said he was not aware that a motion to abolish the deputy leader's office was set to be tabled at Friday's eve-of-conference meeting of the NEC and was not present for the vote, which failed after opponents of Watson led by Momentum chief Jon Lansman failed to secure the two-thirds majority needed to overturn the chair's ruling that it was out of order.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
