Louie Douvis\n\nThe only way to ensure that, in Taylor\u2019s view, is by delivering more dispatchable to balance out the renewables boom. And in the short term, at least, that means baseload coal and gas-fired energy options remain crucial.\n\nThe threat of premature closure of baseload coal plants across the country \u2013 most notably AGL\u2019s Liddell plant \u2013 without plans for like-for-like replacement is Taylor\u2019s biggest fear. Which is why he believes extending the lives of those plants is crucial.\n\nKerry Schott also went out of her way to underscore her focus on the pain being felt by consumers, citing figures that showed energy bills leapt by about 120 per cent between September 2007 and September 2018, compared with a 20 per cent rise in wages and a 10 per cent rise in inflation.\n\nCoal-fired plants are 'dinosaurs'\n\nShe also warned that the investments required for changes in transmission and distribution networks would need to be borne at least in part by these same consumers.\n\nBut Schott warned that just as our transmission and distribution networks are no longer fit for purpose, coal-fired power plants aren\u2019t the answer to the dispatchable power gap.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat we need in the market is energy that is both firm and flexible,\u201d she said, pointing to the \u201cduck curve\u201d that often sees demand for coal-fired power plummet between 11am and 4pm in South Australia and Queensland as renewables kick in during the day, and then surge again as the supply of renewables falls away in the evening.\n\n\u201c[Coal-fired plants] are not flexible at ramping up or ramping down \u2013 they are dinosaurs in that sense,\u201d she said.\n\nCalabria used his speech to call repeatedly for incentives to encourage investment in flexible dispatchable power options. But exactly what those incentives might look like isn\u2019t clear.\n\nGovernment intervention, such as underwriting new generation, is an option, but one the market seems sceptical of, given the size of the investment needed. Reliability obligations could play a role and emissions intensity targets are another option, but not one Taylor is likely to embrace.\n\nIt\u2019s another question for the sector to endlessly debate.", "description": "At the AFR's National Energy Summit on Wednesday, Angus Taylor, Kerry Schott and Frank Calabria found a rare point of agreement.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2842%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_218%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/19cd46f36c3d5b712ea2fb2aea83e3253d1cc631", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
