Announcing the arrival of Adobe\u2019s app on the ARM-powered Surface Pro X, Adobe\u2019s Scott Belsky said that creativity \u201cmust not be constrained to the desktop,\u201d and added that the company is \u201cworking hard to bring other key parts of Creative Cloud to the Surface Pro X as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nAs part of the announcement we were treated to a demonstration of Adobe Fresco onstage. Fresco is Adobe\u2019s painting and drawing app which was recently released for the iPad. We saw how the Surface Pro X\u2019s new Surface Slim Pen can be used to sketch on the 2-in-1 device, including using oil brushes which blend and smear like real oils. The pen can be flipped around as you would do with a pencil to quickly erase any mistakes, or tilted on its side to achieve a different brush effect.\n\nUnfortunately, Belsky didn\u2019t offer any more details about which Adobe Creative Cloud apps could be coming to the Surface Pro X next, but the company is already hard at work on bringing \u201creal Photoshop\u201d to another ARM-based device, the iPad. This version of the software will include all the features of its traditional Windows and macOS versions. The iPadOS version of the app is yet to be officially released, but Adobe clearly sees ARM-based devices as an important part of its future.\n\nBelsky said that Fresco will be coming to the Surface \u201cvery soon,\u201d but didn\u2019t offer an exact release date.", "description": "Adobe\u2019s Fresco application will be available on the ARM-powered Microsoft Surface X, Microsoft announced.
