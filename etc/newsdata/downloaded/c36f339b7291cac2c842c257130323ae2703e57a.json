City Council would be considering \"emergency\" legislation on Tuesday that would order all D.C. government agencies and facilities from cooperating with Immigration and Customs Enforcement as well as other federal immigration authorities unless given an explicit court order. On Tuesday, the D.C. City Council voted unanimously to pass this bill, officially known as the \"Sanctuary Values Act.\"\n\nAccording to Sanctuary DMV, the final bill excludes federal inmates, but the pro-illegal immigration group praised the bill's sponsor, Ward Six councilman Charles Allen, nonetheless. \"Thank you to the DC Council for heeding the calls of immigrant communities by passing the #SanctuaryValuesAct to protect our neighbors from ICE. We\u2019re particularly grateful to Councilmembers @charlesallen, @BrianneKNadeau, and @cmdgrosso for your leadership on this issue,\" the group tweeted.\n\n\"While we\u2019re proud of this important step in protecting immigrant communities in DC, we\u2019re disappointed about the last-minute exclusion of federal inmates held at the DC Jail and we plan to fight like hell to protect these individuals in the permanent version of the bill,\" Sanctuary DMV promised.\n\nAuthor of Open Borders Inc Michelle Malkin tweeted, \"These extremist immigration outlaws, whose obstruction endangers ICE agents and the public, should be criminally prosecuted. #EndSanctuary #StandWithICE.\"\n\nThese extremist immigration outlaws, whose obstruction endangers ICE agents and the public, should be criminally prosecuted. #EndSanctuary #StandWithICE https://t.co/npoC34hVkc \u2014 Michelle Malkin (@michellemalkin) October 8, 2019\n\nPer yesterday's Townhall report, the new bill will make Washington, D.C. a true \"sanctuary\" city for illegal aliens:", "description": ".10/08/2019 20:25:23PM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/261/95413130-8198-4a00-9ec6-1f72136d70d9.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
