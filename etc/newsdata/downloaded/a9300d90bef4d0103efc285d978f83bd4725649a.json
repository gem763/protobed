But if there\u2019s a phrase that rarely applies in a media world that fawns over far leftists and liberals, that would be it. Seriously, Democrats get a lot of free media passes.\n\nJoe Biden is emerging as an exception. As a bit of a delicious about-time exception. And his campaign has all the appearances of entering panic mode.\n\nHere\u2019s what happened: The New York Times just allowed an opinion piece from \u201cClinton Cash\u201d author Peter Schweizer to grace its editorial pages. The op-ed was titled, \u201cWhat Hunter Biden Did Was Legal \u2014 That\u2019s the Problem.\u201d\n\nSchweizer went on to write \u201cWe Need a Washington Corrupt Practices Act to stop political families from self-dealing.\u201d And then he tweeted the piece, writing above the link \u2014 and above a photograph that included Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden, \u201cCongress can and should conduct an inquiry to determine whether anything illegal occurred.\u201d\n\nTeam Biden wasn\u2019t happy.\n\nNo doubt, Team Biden felt a bit betrayed.\n\nSo Team Biden, via its campaign deputy manager, Kate Bedingfield, took action and penned a scathing letter to the newspaper\u2019s executive editor, Dean Baquet, for unfairly \u201cgiving top billing\u201d to Schweizer on its editorial pages.\n\nBedingfield also slammed the newspaper\u2019s Ukraine coverage as catering to President Donald Trump\u2019s attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and serving as an \u201coutsized hand in a baseless conspiracy theory,\u201d Fox News reported.\n\nAnd there was more. Much more.\n\n\u201cDespite voluminous work done by the independent press and fact-checkers \u2014 including some by The Times \u2014 to refute the heinous conspiracy theory that Donald Trump attempted to bully Ukraine into propping-up for him, the paper ran an op-ed by none other than Peter Schweizer, making more malicious claims about the Biden family,\u201d Bedingfield wrote. \u201cThis leaves us with a critical question: are you truly blind to what you got wrong in 2016, or are you deliberately continuing policies that distort reality for the sake of controversy and the clicks that accompany it?\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign also reached out to Facebook and Twitter powers-who-be, begging them to put a stop to an advertisement that spread the word about Biden and Ukraine. Facebook said sorry, no dice; Twitter didn\u2019t respond, CNN reported.\n\nThe Times, meanwhile, shot back this to Biden\u2019s campaign: \u201cOur coverage of the Biden campaign and Hunter Biden has been fair and accurate. \u2026 [We] will continue to cover Joe Biden with the same tough and fair standards we apply to every candidate in the race and we\u2019re happy to sit down with Biden advisers anytime to discuss news coverage.\u201d\n\nWhat to make of all that flurry?\n\nOnly this: Biden\u2019s campaign is in panic mode. They\u2019re feeling the heat, feeling the snub, feeling the unaccustomed scrutiny. And they\u2019re panicking.\n\nIt\u2019s like 2016, all over again.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 heir apparent, Hillary Clinton, thought she had a cake walk to the White House \u2014 but she was wrong. She misstepped. And lost.\n\nIt\u2019s looking more and more like Biden, taking that same heir apparent approach to his presidential campaign, is misstepping, too. When a paper like The New York Times puts a long-time entrenched Democrat under the looking glass, it\u2019s a sure sign of rejection. It\u2019s a sure sign that it\u2019s time for that candidate to give up the fight.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
