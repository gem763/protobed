Many waved US flags, some sang the Star Spangled Banner, and others held signs calling on President Donald Trump to \"liberate\" Hong Kong.\n\nIn chants and speeches they called on the US to pressure Beijing to meet their demands and for Congress to pass a recently proposed bill that expresses support for the protest.\n\n\"More than 1,000 protesters have been arrested. We can't do anything but come out onto the streets. I feel hopeless,\" 30-year-old protester Jenny Chan, told AFP.\n\n\"I think aside from foreign countries, no one can really help us,\" she added.\n\nIn what has become a now familiar pattern, the main daytime rally passed off peacefully.\n\nBut as evening set in, riot police chased groups of hardcore protesters who blocked roads, vandalised nearby subway stations and set makeshift barricades on fire.\n\nOne fire burned at an entrance to the subway in the corporate district of Central, where a protester also smashed the station's exterior glass.\n\nIn the shopping area of Causeway Bay, officers fired tear gas outside another subway station.\n\nParamedics took away on a stretcher a man who collapsed after inhaling the gas, and police detained suspected protesters inside that station.\n\n- Beijing riled by criticism -\n\nHong Kong is a major international business hub thanks to freedoms unheard of on the mainland under a 50-year deal signed between China and Britain.\n\nBut Beijing balks at any criticism from foreign governments over its handling of the city, which it insists is a purely internal issue.\n\nAuthorities and state media have portrayed the protests as a separatist movement backed by foreign \"black hands\", primarily aiming their ire at the US and Britain.\n\nWhile some American politicians on both sides of the aisle have expressed support for the democratic goals of the protesters, the Trump administration has maintained a more hands-off approach while it fights a trade war with China.\n\nTrump has called for a peaceful resolution to the political crisis and urged China against escalating with a violent crackdown.\n\nBut he has also said it is up to Beijing to handle the protests.\n\nWashington has rejected China's allegations that it is backing the demonstrators and Beijing has shown little evidence to back its claims beyond supportive statements from some politicians.\n\nThe protests show no signs of abating, and the city's unelected pro-Beijing leader Carrie Lam has struck an uncompromising tone for much of the last three months.\n\nOn Wednesday, she made a surprise concession, announcing the full withdrawal of the proposed extradition bill which sparked the demonstrations.\n\nProtesters across the spectrum dismissed the gesture as too little, too late, saying their movement would only end once the remainder of their core demands were met.\n\n\"Our government continuously takes away our freedoms and that's why people are coming out,\" a 30-year-old protester in a wheelchair who gave his surname as Ho told AFP on Sunday.\n\nAnalysts say it is difficult to predict what Beijing's next move might be.\n\nUnder president Xi Jinping, China has become increasingly authoritarian and dissent is being stamped out with renewed ferocity.", "description": "A huge crowd of pro-democracy activists marched to the United States consulate in Hong Kong on Sunday in a bid to ramp up international pressure on Beijing following three months of huge and sometimes violent protests.
