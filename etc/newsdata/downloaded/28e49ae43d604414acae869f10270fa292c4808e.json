The tribunal found evidence they were \u201cbeing used as a bank of organs\u201d and subjected to regular medical testing.\n\nChina has repeatedly denied the use of unethical organ transplant practices, and said that it stopped using the organs from executed prisoners in 2015. In a statement earlier this year, it accused the London-based China Tribunal of perpetuating \u201crumours\u201d.\n\nBut Sir Geoffrey, also speaking on Tuesday at a separate NGO-hosted UN event, said the evidence collated by the tribunal meant the international community \u201ccan no longer avoid what it is inconvenient for them to admit\u201d.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Sir Geoffrey called on the International Transplant Society and national medical associations dealing with transplant surgery to \u201cface up to what is revealed in the China Tribunal judgment and act\u201d.\n\nSome countries, including Italy, Spain, Israel and Taiwan, already have restrictions in place for those seeking to travel to China for organ transplant surgery.\n\nAnd the International Coalition to End Transplant Abuse in China (Etac), which initiated the China Tribunal, said it expects a private members bill to stop unethical organ tourism will be tabled in the UK parliament in October.\n\nEtac is hoping its findings will prompt the Human Rights Council to open up a UN Commission of Inquiry into forced organ harvesting in China, said Susie Hughes, the organisation\u2019s executive director.\n\nIn his speech, Mr Sabi said that the targeting of minority groups for organ harvesting amounted to a \u201cpossible charge of genocide\u201d, and compared it to other examples of mass religious or racial persecution in recent history.\n\n\u201cVictim for victim and death for death, the gassing of the Jews by the Nazis, the massacre by the Khmer Rouge or the butchery to death of the Rwanda Tutsis may not be worse than cutting out the hearts and other organs from living, blameless, harmless, peaceable people,\u201d he told the Human Rights Council. \u201cIt is the legal obligation of UN Member States to address this criminal conduct.\u201d", "description": "The Chinese government is harvesting and selling organs from persecuted religious and ethnic minorities on an industrial scale, the UN Human Rights Council\u00a0has been\u00a0told.
