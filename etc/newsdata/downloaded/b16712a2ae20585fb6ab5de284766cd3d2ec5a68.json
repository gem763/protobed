But there was a slight crack in the armor of the city\u2019s leadership this weekend when the powers that be made a very public apology. On Sunday, a water cannon was deployed in front of one of the city\u2019s mosques and it sprayed down worshippers standing on the sidewalk in front of the building. For that, Carrie Lam and the police chief say, they are truly sorry. (Associated Press)\n\nHong Kong officials apologized to Muslim leaders Monday after riot police sprayed a mosque and bystanders with a water cannon while trying to contain pro-democracy demonstrations in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory. The city\u2019s leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, and its police chief visited the Kowloon Mosque to apologize to the chief imam and Muslim community leaders. They left without commenting, but mosque leaders told reporters that the officials had apologized.\n\nAfter the private apology at the mosque, police officials went on to offer a public apology at their daily press briefing. So all\u2019s well that ends well, right?\n\nMaybe, but there\u2019s more going on here than the simple description provided by officials suggests. First of all, that water cannon was shooting more than just \u201cwater.\u201d And the choice of targets and the timing of the deployment make this look like something far more dubious than normal police riot control protocol.\n\nIf you take a look at this Facebook video you can see the entire event play out.\n\nThe water from the cannon is mixed with a blue dye of some sort. It not only stains the walls of the mosque and the sidewalk but sends pedestrians scrambling to flush the substance out of their eyes. Many described a burning sensation.\n\nAlso, why was the cannon deployed in this case? If there are protesters (or even rioters) setting up roadblocks, shutting down traffic or breaking windows, you can almost understand a decision by the police to resort to some more strident riot control tactics. But none of that was happening in this case. The streets were clear, traffic was flowing normally and their targets were people standing on the sidewalk talking. At least one member of the press was also blasted with the blue dye.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to believe that the fact they were targeting a crowd in front of a mosque was just coincidence. While many of the residents of Hong Kong are clearly fighting for freedom and democracy, the government there still answers to Beijing. And Xi Jinping has a strict policy when it comes to religion. He\u2019s been cracking down on Christians and Buddhists, but he\u2019s really had it out for the Muslims, particularly the Uighurs.\n\nThe official position of the Communist Party is to stick to atheism, and they\u2019re engaging in a policy that\u2019s known as \u201csinicization.\u201d Under this theory, the government insists that Muslim, Buddhist, and Christian leaders move to \u201cfuse their religions with Chinese socialist thought.\u201d Those who don\u2019t comply are subject to official government repression. And since most of the religions have no interest in such ideology, they\u2019re all targets, particularly the Muslims.\n\nWith all that in mind, this incident doesn\u2019t look anything like riot control. It was an unprovoked attack on worshippers gathered on the sidewalk in front of a Mosque. Hong Kong\u2019s leaders may have apologized, but it appears that their police are enforcing strict policies coming straight from the top in Beijing.", "description": "No harm, no foul", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Taylor Millard", "Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/HongKong-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
