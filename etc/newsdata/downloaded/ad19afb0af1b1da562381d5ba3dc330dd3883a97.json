I'm sure off the court we are still friends.\n\n\"I really like the challenge. Some players are maybe afraid of the big courts but for me it is more motivation. I am really enjoying my tennis.\"\n\nPA", "description": "Teenager Bianca Andreescu's remarkable rise continued as she came from a set down to sink Elise Mertens and reach the last four of the US Open.
