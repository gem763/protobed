He's getting the prosecutor for \u2014 I guess, John, it was $2 billion - said, 'We're not going to give you the $2 billion or whatever the amount was unless you get rid of this prosecutor,' and there was, lo and behold, the prosecutor was gone.\"\n\n(In fact, Biden calling for ousting Ukraine's prosecutor was supported by the United States, the Western countries and the International Monetary Fund.)\n\nIs this where Biden hopes the campaign is the rest of the fall - in a one-on-one fight against Trump?\n\nIt might be his best strategy.\n\nSlight majority favor impeaching and removing Trump, per Fox poll\n\nOur latest NBC/WSJ poll found a plurality of Americans \u2014 49 percent \u2014 opposing President Trump's impeachment and removal from office, while 43 percent said they support it.\n\nBut a Fox News poll from yesterday showed a slight majority - 51 percent - favoring impeachment and removal.\n\nAlso in the poll, 66 percent said it was inappropriate for Trump to ask foreign countries to investigate political rivals.\n\nAnd it asked what is more important to Trump: 55 percent answered doing what's best for himself, while 39 percent said it's doing what's best for the country.\n\n2020 Vision: Sanders says he \"misspoke\" about curtailing activity after heart attack\n\n\"I misspoke the other day. I said a word I should not have said and media drives me a little bit nuts to make a big deal about it,\" Bernie Sanders said in a sit-down interview with NBC News on Wednesday. \"We're going to get back into the groove of a very vigorous campaign, I love doing rallies and I love doing town meetings.\"\n\nNBC's Gary Grumbach reminds us what Sanders said the day before the interview:\n\nSanders: Look, we were doing, you know, in some cases five or six meetings a day. Three or four rallies and town meetings and meeting with groups of people. I don't think I'm going to do that. But I certainly intend to be actively campaigning. I think we are going to change the nature of the campaign a bit. Make sure I have the strength to do what I have to do.\n\nGrumbach: What do you mean by change the nature?\n\nSanders: Well, probably not doing four rallies a day. I'm not quite sure, I could be wrong on this, I don't know if there is anybody who did more rallies than we have done all over the states and I, you know, probably not do three or four rallies a day, do two or do other things as well.\n\nAlso in the interview with NBC, Sanders dismissed concerns that he and his campaign weren't transparent since it took three days to admit he had a heart attack.\n\n\"No, I don't accept that. I think that's a media thing. You know I think that to try to understand what in fact is going on, it's uh, I think we did it appropriately and as quickly as we could. So no apologies.\"\n\nOn the campaign trail today\n\nPresident Trump holds a rally in Minneapolis at 8:00 pm ET\u2026 Nine Democratic candidates - Cory Booker, Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Beto O'Rourke, Amy Klobuchar, Julian Castro and Tom Steyer - participate in an LGBTQ forum hosted by the Human Rights Campaign and CNN\u2026 And Andrew Yang, Tulsi Gabbard and Steve Bullock are in New Hampshire.\n\nDispatches from NBC's embeds\n\nWhile campaigning in New Hampshire yesterday, Joe Biden (not so subtly) jabbed Elizabeth Warren. \"Without mentioning her name, Biden repeatedly referenced one thing that Warren is known for: her plans,\" per NBC's Marianna Sotomayor and Amanda Golden. \"'We are not electing a planner. There's no one in this race who has a stronger record passing important and consequential election law or legislation than I have,' he said. Later when discussing gun reform, Biden said 'But more important than my plan is my promise: I promise you I will get this reform done.'\"\n\nThe Elizabeth Warren-Jim Clyburn's joint event in South Carolina on Wednesday was a split crowd when considering 2020 candidates, NBC's Benjamin Pu reports. \"When I asked voters where they stood with current 2020 candidates, several said they were split between Biden and Warren. When I pointed out that they were very different ideologically, voters were quick to note the goodwill the black community felt with Biden but said that they were also considering Warren now as they were learning more about her.\"\n\nData Download: The number of the day is \u2026 26 percent\n\n26 percent.\n\nThat's the share of Americans who have a positive view of Rudy Giuliani, per our latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. Forty-two percent have a negative view, giving the former New York City mayor a net negative rating of -16 percent.\n\nIn December 2001, after Giuliani's response to the 9/11 attacks, just 2 percent of Americans had a negative view of him, with 84 percent viewing him positively.\n\nTweet of the day\n\nThe Lid: Indie Nation\n\nDon't miss the pod from yesterday, when we looked at where independents are on impeachment in our latest poll.\n\nICYMI: News clips you shouldn't miss\n\nThe death toll has climbed in northern Syria.\n\nTrump wants torace against the clockon impeachment.
