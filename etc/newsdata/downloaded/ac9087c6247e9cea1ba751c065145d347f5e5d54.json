In January, a French regulator fined Google 50 million euros ($55.5 million) for breaches of privacy laws.", "description": "An Australian regulator has filed a lawsuit against Google, accusing it of misleading smartphone users about how it collected and used personal location data.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105582177-1542631502572gettyimages-1052757248.jpg?v=1572340590", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
