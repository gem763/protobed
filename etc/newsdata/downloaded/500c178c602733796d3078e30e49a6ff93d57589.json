For nearly four decades, Ms. Ivins relentlessly and often mercilessly held state and national politicians to account, famously tagging George W. Bush with the nickname \u201cShrub\u201d and infamously suggesting that a speech given by the conservative pundit and presidential hopeful Pat Buchanan at the 1992 Republican convention \u201cwas probably better in the original German.\u201d\n\nBy the time she died of cancer, Ms. Ivins had become so well-known \u2014 as an outspoken best-selling writer, syndicated columnist and professional wit \u2014 that she was one of those first-name-only people, like Cher and Madonna. At least she was in Texas, where she grew up and where she always found her best material. She had the loudest voice for progressive politics the state had ever heard, and if you shared her views, you were a little less lonely whenever her opinions showed up in print, especially during the 1970s, when she worked at The Texas Observer. Corruption, bigotry and mind-boggling stupidity were rampant back then \u2014 as now, alas \u2014 but Ms. Ivins and her co-editor, Kaye Northcott, often seemed to be the only reporters willing to call out the criminals, bigots and idiots for what they were.\n\nOften, their targets didn\u2019t quite get it. As Ms. Ivins recalled of those days, after she reported in The Observer that some \u201cegg-suck\u2019\u201d pol \u201cran on all fours and had the mind of an adolescent pissant,\u201d he\u2019d \u201cbeam, spread his arms and holler, \u2018Baby! Yew put mah name in yore paper!\u2019\u201d\n\nBut maybe they did get it. I used to think that her Professional Texan act was just that, but I see now that it was also a way to show that we Texans were all in it together, and that the things that united us \u2014 our expressiveness and expansiveness, our culture and our nearly inexplicable love of a nearly uninhabitable place \u2014 were more important than our divisions.\n\nMore important, before Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert \u2014 and their teams of writers \u2014 Ms. Ivins was a one-woman humor mill, churning out finely honed one-liners that would today send President Trump into an envy meltdown. Unlike so many partisans on the left \u2014 and like our current president, truth be told \u2014 she understood that \u201cthe best way to get the sons of bitches is to make people laugh at them.\u201d She was nonpartisan in her attacks: Camille Paglia was a \u201ccrassly egocentric raving twit.\u201d Bill Clinton was \u201cweaker than bus station chili.\u201d Ross Perot was \u201call hawk and no spit,\u201d while Ronald Reagan \u201cproved that ignorance is no handicap to the presidency.\u201d She famously said of our former speaker of the House Gib Lewis, \u201cIf his I.Q. slips any lower, we\u2019ll have to water him twice a day.\u201d That she bullied the bullies made her a local hero at first, and then a national one.", "description": "Molly Ivins was a one-woman humor mill who understood that \u201cthe best way to get\u201d politicians was \u201cto make people laugh at them.\u201d", "authors": ["Mimi Swartz"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/09/opinion/09swartzWeb/09swartzWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
