Just a few of the jokes are different.\n\n\u201cOf course, if Trump is impeached, he could probably return here, if you believe the American press,\u201d laughed one Moscow-based moderator.\n\nAs a historian who studies contemporary Russia, I have seen the pro-Kremlin Russian political and media establishment grow increasingly skilled at spinning stories to highlight U.S. political weaknesses over the past five years \u2014 since conflict between the U.S. and Russia first erupted over Russia\u2019s annexation of a portion of Ukraine.\n\nThis latest scandal, revolving around a phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, is a gift for those wishing to advertise U.S. dysfunction without seeming to engage in heavy-handed censorship or promote obviously deceptive propaganda.\n\nOne tactic is comedy. In a catchy YouTube feature by the Kremlin-funded English-language media service RT, titled \u201cUkrainegate: The Next Best Thing,\u201d an enthusiastic young woman with a British accent gives a synopsis of the impeachment investigation. In less than three minutes, she succeeds in mocking both the U.S. and Ukrainian presidents, the U.S. political system, and the ignorance and condescension of the average Democratic operative.\n\nShe begins: \u201cDespite all the effort that went into Russiagate, the claims against Donald Trump just won\u2019t stick. Luckily for the Democrats, there are plenty more Eastern European countries that can be used to bring down a president.\u201d\n\nUkraine is, of course, the country she\u2019s referring to. \u201cIf you squint, it could even be Russia,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s big, it\u2019s cold, and everyone speaks Russian \u2026 sort of.\u201d\n\n\u0411\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043e\u043d \u0434\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0438\n\n\u0422\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043f \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043b \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0443\u044e \u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u0443 \u0432 \u0421\u0428\u0410 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0443\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0434\u0443\u0440\u044b \u0438\u043c\u043f\u0438\u0447\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430. pic.twitter.com/MsAl2v53z2 \u2014 \u0415\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0413\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432\u0430 (@galakhova71) October 3, 2019\n\n\u0415\n\nA Russian cartoon titled \u201cBastion of Democracy.\u201d Democratic soldiers are firing an \u201cimpeachment\u201d cannon backwards, while Trump defends the White House with a sword.\n\nWho is to blame?\n\nMost Russian newspapers are echoing Republican condemnation of Democrats for allegedly concocting another scandal involving Trump after failing to find proof his campaign colluded with Russia to swing his 2016 election.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats are making a laughingstock of themselves. If they are not careful, this could end up exposing a lot of Democratic corruption dating back to the Clinton years. But at least it\u2019s keeping them busy \u2014 otherwise they\u2019d return to interfering in the Russian economy.\u201d So remarked one panelist to general applause on \u201cVecher\u201d (\u201cEvening\u201d), a popular prime-time talk show with pro-Putin host Vladimir Soloviev.\n\n\u201cThe actions of U.S. Democrats are exposing their country to global ridicule,\u201d wrote Maria Zakharova, spokesperson for Russia\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on Facebook.\n\nRussian pundits are also presenting the U.S. intelligence community as highly politicized and unreliable. Many repeat variants of Trump\u2019s own angry tweets, accusing the security organs of trying to orchestrate a coup.\n\nAt the opening of Russian Energy Week in Moscow on Oct. 2, Russian President Vladimir Putin likewise criticized their actions, which he claimed had little to do with defending rule of law.\n\nDuring Watergate, Putin said, U.S. President Richard Nixon got into trouble \u201cfor eavesdropping on his political rivals. But here we have a totally different situation. Here Trump was eavesdropped on \u2026 and some kind of anonymous employee of the special services distributed that information.\u201d\n\nA Russian cartoon by Sergey Elkin, featuring Zelenskiy wondering \u201cWho should I make president of the United States?\u201d\n\nTrump slump\n\nEven in defending Trump, the Russian establishment casts him as far more vulnerable than their own leader.\n\nPutin, meanwhile, is taking a cool, professorial tone in describing the U.S. situation to international audiences.\n\n\u201cI was taught long ago to be aware that any of my conversations could end up published,\u201d Putin remarked at the Energy Week panel, alluding to his past training in espionage. He claimed that, consequently, he had nothing to hide and did not oppose making public the transcripts of his meetings with Trump.\n\nNevertheless, even independent Russian media services generally critical of the Kremlin have pointed out that Trump, not Putin, might be the one with something to hide. Citing The Washington Post, internet news company Meduza reported that in one redacted meeting Trump held in 2017 with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Trump allegedly said that \u201che wasn\u2019t greatly upset about Russian meddling in the American presidential election of 2016, given that America has done the same thing in many other countries.\u201d\n\nRussian talk show hosts, meanwhile, are expressing incredulity at the fact that a sitting U.S. president can\u2019t apparently manage to keep his would-be secrets secret.\n\nAs nationalist Eduard Limonov argued: \u201cIf I were in Trump\u2019s position, I\u2019d create my own Secret Service, answering only to me, and I wouldn\u2019t drink or eat anything that wasn\u2019t vetted by my own people.\u201d\n\nEven as Russian commentators defend both Trump and to some extent Ukrainian leader Zelenskiy, they also are taking the opportunity to remind viewers that the two men both lack political experience. Trump probably thought he and Zelenskiy, the star of a popular television sitcom before he became president, could be \u201ckindred spirits, able to reminisce about promising TV careers ruined by a move into politics,\u201d RT joked.\n\nLooking like a global leader\n\nAmid a barrage of increasingly sensational Western headlines, Russian journalists can allow the U.S. media to do their work for them. Selective quotes from U.S. coverage of Washington\u2019s bitter political battles are held up, in the Russian press, as examples of U.S. hypocrisy and decay.\n\nAt the same time, Russian leaders are presenting themselves as statesmanlike and above the fray. Their benevolent attitude, at least for the moment, appears to extend to Ukraine, thanks to Zelenskiy\u2019s apparent willingness to make peace with the Kremlin.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t envy him,\u201d said Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev on a trip to Cuba, refusing to get drawn into a reporter\u2019s question about whether \u201cZelenskiy has become Trump\u2019s Monica Lewinsky\u201d but still laughing at the jest.\n\nMeanwhile, Putin continues to position himself to look strong on the global stage. Taking questions with a panel of oil and gas executives in Moscow on Oct. 2, he joked about planning to interfere in 2020 U.S. elections.\n\nBut, speaking the next day at the Valdai Discussion Club in Sochi to an audience that included the King of Jordan and the presidents of Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and the Philippines, Putin emphasized that today\u2019s complex world requires global cooperation and a sense of \u201ccommon responsibility.\u201d\n\nTaking the tone of a parent talking about a small child, Putin suggested the U.S. try hard to correct its all-consuming domestic chaos. He stressed that Moscow will be willing to work with whomever the future U.S. leader might be.\n\nCynthia Hooper is an associate professor of history at College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass.
