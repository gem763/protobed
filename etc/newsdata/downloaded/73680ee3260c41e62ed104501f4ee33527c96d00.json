Her latest bet, ManiMe, says it uses machine learning to produce a unique 3D model of each of your nails then laser cuts gels to create a perfectly tailored stick-on nail. The nails are delivered directly to consumers for \u201cthe easiest manicure from inside your home,\u201d says co-founder and chief executive officer Jooyeon Song.\n\nManiMe, which began selling nails last week, has adopted a subscription business model to keep the nails arriving at your doorstep. They cost between $10 to $25 per set, depending on the complexity of the design, and last between 10 to 14 days (no, they can\u2019t be reapplied). ManiMe\u2019s nail sets won\u2019t necessarily save you money\u2013the average manicure is about $20\u2013but the product will save you time, considering a trip to the nail salon takes about an hour twice per month and a ManiMe application should take only five minutes.\n\nSong co-founded ManiMe alongside David Miro Llopis, the startup\u2019s chief operating officer. The pair met during Stanford University\u2019s MBA program and spent the last two years developing the proprietary 3D technology behind ManiMe. Nail innovation isn\u2019t something VCs typically invest in, despite the fact that roughly $8.5 billion was spent on U.S. nail salon services in 2018, according to data collected by Statista.\n\nWe\u2019ve yet to try out ManiMe\u2019s faux-nails, but if they\u2019re as good as the founders suggest, the company has a real opportunity to alter the American nail market. Song says they while they have aspirations to be a \u201ccategory killer,\u201d they ultimately think ManiMe will be complementary to existing nail salons, who could apply ManiMe nails to customers who might not wish to do it themselves.\n\n\u201cOur company\u2019s mission is to make women\u2019s life easier using our technology,\u201d Song tells TechCrunch.\n\nTo secure a set of ManiMe nails, a customer needs to send five images of their nails on top of a card, select art from the company\u2019s gallery, then wait three to four days for delivery. Using gel sourced from Korea, ManiMe\u2019s nails are free of harmful chemicals, a real differentiator considering many nail salons are packed with hazardous chemicals\u2013an issue that has caused illness among nail technicians across the U.S. and documented by The New York Times.\n\nThe business plans to partner with nail influencers, allowing them to display their nail art on ManiMe\u2019s marketplace. If a customer selects an influencer\u2019s design, ManiMe will give the artist a cut via a previously agreed upon revenue share agreement. The alliance gives nail influencers, of which there are many, an opportunity to monetize their work and promote ManiMe via their social media platforms.\n\nManiMe is also backed by Trinity Ventures, Techstars and NFX.", "description": "ManiMe raises $2.6M in seed funding.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/manime-product.png?w=575", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
