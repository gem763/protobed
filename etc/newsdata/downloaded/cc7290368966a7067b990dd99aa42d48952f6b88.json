People online are always asking where they can get it,'\u201d Smith said. \u201cAnd he then goes, \u2018You know, that movie had a big cast, we might even be able to do a sequel.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018Yeah man, right on. I might think about that.\u2019 And he was like, \u2018We\u2019ll talk.\u2019 \u201c\n\nHarvey Weinstein and Kevin Smith | John Shearer/WireImage More\n\nOne week after the phone call, on Oct. 5, 2017, The New York Times released a story that featured dozens of women accusing Weinstein, 67, of rape, sexual assault and sexual abuse over a period of at least 30 years.\n\n\u201cI felt sick to my stomach,\u201d Smith recalled upon reading the story.\n\nThe NYT story resulted in Weinstein\u2019s dismissal from The Weinstein Company. He was arrested in May 2018 but was released on bail. He has denied all accusations against him.\n\nAfter reading the story, Smith said he told someone who worked at Miramax, also founded by Weinstein, about the phone call. That person, according to Smith, told him they received a similar call from the now-disgraced producer.\n\n\u201cThere are people who are the real victims here, but I have to be honest with you, I felt like it was someone using something you love to provoke a reaction,\u201d he said regarding the phone call.\n\nRELATED: Gwyneth Paltrow Says Having a Teenage Daughter Caused Her to Come Forward About Harvey Weinstein\n\n\u201cHe was starting to circle the wagons,\u201d Smith continued. \u201cIt was him looking to see who was a friend still because his life was about to shift completely. And I used to be a defense guy. I wrote a piece in Variety on how he\u2019s still got the edge when people would go after him like, \u2018Harvey\u2019s lost his touch.\u2019 \u201c\n\nIn a 2004 editorial in Variety, Smith defended Weinstein after the release of Peter Biskind\u2019s book Down and Dirty, which accused Weinstein and his brother Bob of bullying and intimidation to make Miramax a hit-making production company in the \u201990s.\n\nHarvey | REUTERS/Mike Segar More", "description": "Kevin Smith Says He \u2018Felt Sick\u2019 After Call from Harvey Weinstein", "authors": ["Eric Todisco"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/z.GOv3SXm7Gjs5RQCdtzww--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/tardis/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpeopledotcom.files.wordpress.com%2F2017%2F10%2Fkevin-smith.jpg&w=1000&f=jpg&q=80", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
