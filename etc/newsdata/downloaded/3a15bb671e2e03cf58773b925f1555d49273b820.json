But such intergenerational finger-pointing is dangerous. Guthrie wouldn\u2019t have wanted fans blaming him for his own father\u2019s racism.\n\nThere\u2019s no point being a novelist in these stranger-than-fiction days. Just as Donald Trump\u2019s unlikely but successful presidential campaign began, Will Kaufman, an academic researching Woody Guthrie\u2019s life, found the lost lyrics. Guthrie, born in Okemah, Oklahoma in 1912, is associated with the Dust Bowl and the Oklahoma Panhandle not the Big Apple and the Coney Island Peninsula. Yet in the early 1950s, this troubadour of America\u2019s troubled heartland lived in Brooklyn. Two of those years he lived in Beach Haven, seven 23-story brown brick apartment towers a Queens-based real estate mogul, Fred Trump, developed.\n\nGuthrie was the idealistic folk singer, often pictured gazing off wistfully, with a suitably proletarian cap perched on his head, cradling his guitar with its sign: \u201cTHIS MACHINE KILLS FASCISTS.\u201d Trump, born in the Bronx to German immigrants seven years before Guthrie, was the cynical developer, often pictured looking fastidious, his trimmed mustache and three piece suit exuding wealth. Another photo shows Trump with his business partner and son, Donald, standing on an overpass in front of nearly a dozen brick towers. To some, those modest rental apartments represent the post-World War II American dream of affordable housing for all. Today, Trumpaphobes see the drab towers as soul-crushing and exploitative, while justifiably resenting the racism that we all now know blocked blacks from enjoying these waystations on the way to home ownership.\n\nIn December, 1950, Guthrie signed a lease above Fred Trump\u2019s name to rent one of Beach Havens\u20191800 apartments. While Guthrie could not know that in 1954, the government would accuse Trump Senior of $3.7 million in profiteering off this development, Guthrie did notice that \u201cBitch Havens,\u201d as he called it, was exclusively white. Disgusted by this \u201cJimCrow town,\u201d he scribbled: \u201cI suppose/Old Man Trump knows/Just how much/Racial Hate/he stirred up/In the bloodpot of human hearts/When he drawed/That color line/Here at his/1800 family project.\u201d\n\nTwo years later, after being diagnosed with the Huntington\u2019s disease that would kill him in 1967, Guthrie left Beach Havens with his family. Four decades after his death, Guthrie\u2019s songs remain an essential part of the national soundtrack that makes Americans, American. His \u201cThis Land is Your Land\u201d unites left and right in lyrical love of country.\n\nThat is why finding those lyrics was such a gift to the anti-Trump forces. Who could resist hanging the sins of the father onto his controversial son? \u201cI think it is really important that Woody is speaking to us from beyond the grave now,\u201d Will Kaufman observed. In describing his important find, Kaufman wrote of Guthrie and Trump, this Outer borough odd couple: \u201cNo pairing could appear more unlikely.\u201d Quoting Donald Trump\u2019s proclamation that \u201cMy legacy has its roots in my father\u2019s legacy,\u201d Kaufman concluded: \u201cThese writings \u2026 pit America\u2019s national balladeer against the racist foundations of the Trump real estate empire.\u201d\n\nThe three musicians who then recorded \u201cOld Man Trump,\u201d Ryan Harvey, Ani DiFranco, Tom Morello, joined the bandwagon. \u201cYou\u2019ve got Donald Trump talking about making America great again ... and so here\u2019s Woody Guthrie, one of the definers of American history, coming out after his death and saying \u2018No, it wasn\u2019t a great era and in fact your father was part of the problem,\u2019\u201d the folk singer Ryan Harvey said.\n\nThe German term \u201cschadenfreude\u201d means the joy derived from another\u2019s misery. Could we call these expressions \u201cshander-Freud,\u201d the psychoanalytically charged joy and supposed insight we derive from dredging up the ancestral scandals of someone we hate? \u201cSchander\u201d in German means defiler or desecrator; in Yiddish it means shame or scandal.\n\nThis psychologizing is as cheap as Fred Trump\u2019s buildings (or his son\u2019s tastes). Genealogy is not destiny. While it helps to understand who Donald Trump\u2019s father was, Donald Trump is Donald Trump because of Donald Trump and should be judged as Donald Trump.\n\nBeware our fluid Freudian determinism of convenience. When someone we dislike has a detestable parent, we say \u201cyou see!\u201d When someone we like has a disagreeable parent we say, \u201cyou see what our hero overcame!\u201d\n\nWill Kaufman writes cryptically that \u201cGuthrie had traveled a long road from the casual racism of his Oklahoma youth.\u201d That\u2019s the least of it: Charles Guthrie, father of Woody Guthrie, this icon of the American left, belonged to the Ku Klux Klan \u2013 and participated in the 1911 lynching of Laura and Lawrence Nelson. An African-American mother and son team, they probably were guilty of shooting a Deputy Sheriff over a dispute following the theft of a cow. Still, they should not have been kidnapped. Mrs. Nelson should not have been raped repeatedly. And the two should not have been left hanging from a bridge, so their murder could entertain people who saw the image on a popular postcard, offering a rare photo of a woman lynched.\n\nIn schoolyard fights, taunting someone\u2019s parent descends into the unacceptable. We have crossed that line in our politics. So many of us seize whatever we can to malign opponents because we ignore another essential Woody Guthrie lesson. His song \u201cThis is Our Country Here,\u201d acknowledges America\u2019s \u201cugly\u201d and \u201cpretty\u201d sides. He resisted \u201cjust feeling her pretty parts.\u201d But he also refused to believe \u201cthere is nothing good about her, nothing free, nothing clean, that she is all slums, shacks, rot, filth, stink, and bad odors.\u201d\n\nGuthrie explains: \u201cbecause I knew the pretty part \u2026 I wanted to change the ugly part,\u201d and \u201cBecause I hated the dirty part. .. I knew how to feel the love for the cleaner part.\u201d That is the balance of the dissenting patriot, the thinking American, and the aspirational leader. That is the kind of greatness we want in America and in our president, raising Americans to aim high, embrace the bad, fix the good. That absence, not his father\u2019s racism, is the problem with President Donald Trump.", "description": "\u201cBitch Havens\u201d was what Woody Guthrie called the Trump complex he moved into, and was horrified by this exclusively white \u201cJimCrow town.\u201d", "authors": ["Gil Troy"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1496526609/170526-troy-gurthrie-trump-tease_z1jgar"}
