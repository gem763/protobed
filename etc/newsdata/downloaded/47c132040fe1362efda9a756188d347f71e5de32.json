Tehran is due to take a fourth step on 7 November.\n\nOne source said: \u201cThe difficulty is that Iran says the steps are reversible, but if they learn about building a nuclear bomb, that is irreversible.\u201d\n\nOnce the deal\u2019s dispute mechanism is triggered, both sides have 30 days to prove significant non-compliance, and if necessary a world-wide sanctions snap-back occurs.\n\nSuch a move would be a huge blow to the EU, which has refused for 16 months to join the US in pulling out of the deal. The Trump administration has been trying to persuade the EU to abandon the deal, and the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, this week claimed the September 14 attack on the Saudi Aramco oil facilities represented \u201can awakening\u201d for Europe.\n\nThe EU warning also came after the French president, Emmanuel Macron, failed to broker a new deal between the US and Iran in which the Washington would lift sanctions, and the Tehran would return to full compliance with the agreement.\n\nMacron had hoped the shock of the attack on the Saudi oil fields, ascribed to Iran by both the EU and the US, would jolt the two sides into compromise.\n\nBut Washington\u2019s refusal to lift any sanctions before talks with Iranian officials, and Tehran\u2019s refusal to have any contacts before sanctions were eased significantly made Macron\u2019s mission impossible.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in New York on Thursday, Iran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, urged the United States to \u201ccease this policy of maximum pressure\u201d in favour of \u201cdialogue, and logic and reason\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf we reach a time when these preconditions are taken off the table, of course the possibility exists to talk with America.\u201d\n\nEU diplomats do not see an appetite in Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates to lead a war against Iran. Riyadh wants the US to lead a military response, something President Trump is reluctant to do. The UAE argues that Iran\u2019s move is ultimately counter-productive since it is forcing the EU to rethink its approach.\n\nBut European diplomats still argue that the American strategy is incoherent: Washington has applied a sanctions regime so severe that Tehran has responded militarily, but the president is not yet willing to respond in kind, meaning his only real option is more sanctions.\n\nIn early June, the Iranian government announced it would break from a key component of the Iran deal \u2013 the joint comprehensive plan of action \u2013 by ramping up its enrichment of low-grade uranium and increasing its stockpile beyond the limitations outlined in the deal.\n\nSo far, Iran has announced that it would breach on its commitments to increase the low-enriched uranium stockpile above the 300kg limit of 3.67% enriched uranium and enrich uranium above the 3.67% level. In September Iran said it would develop more advanced centrifuges that allow for more rapid uranium enrichment.", "description": "EU warns it may have no choice if Iran takes further steps away from dealHassan Rouhani this week urged the United States to \u2018cease this policy of maximum pressure\u2019 in favour of \u2018dialogue, and logic and reason\u2019.
