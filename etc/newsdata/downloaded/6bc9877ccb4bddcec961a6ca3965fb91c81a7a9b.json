But there has been no comparable questioning of the basic ideas underpinning economic policy. That needs to change.\u201d\n\nThe former Bank governor said the economic and political climate had rarely been so fraught, citing the US-China trade war, riots in Hong Kong, problems in key emerging countries such as Argentina and Turkey, the growing tensions between France and Germany over the future direction of the euro, and the increasingly bitter political conflict in the US at a time when the willingness of the US to act as the world\u2019s policeman was disappearing.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Lord Mervyn King. Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian\n\n\u201cRipples on the surface of our politics have become breaking waves as the winds of change have gained force,\u201d he said.\n\nKing said the world economy was stuck in a low growth trap and that the recovery from the slump of 2008-09 was weaker than that after the Great Depression.\n\n\u201cFollowing the Great Inflation, the Great Stability and the Great Recession, we have entered the Great Stagnation.\u201d King said that in 2013 the former US Treasury secretary Larry Summers had reintroduced the concept of secular stagnation, a permanent period of low growth in which ultra-low interest rates are ineffective: \u201cIt is surely now time to admit that we are experiencing it.\u201d\n\nStandard models were unhelpful in two important areas of economic policy \u2013 getting the world economy out of its low growth trap, and preparing for the next financial crisis.\n\n\u201cConventional wisdom attributes the stagnation largely to supply factors as the underlying growth rate of productivity appears to have fallen. But data can be interpreted only within a theory or model. And it is surprising that there has been so much resistance to the hypothesis that, not just the United States, but the world as a whole is suffering from demand-led secular stagnation.\u201d\n\nKing said the world entered and departed from the global financial crisis with a distorted pattern of demand and output. To escape permanently from a low growth trap involved a reallocation of resources from one component of demand to another, from one sector to another, and from one firm to another.\n\n\u201cThere has been excess investment in some parts of the economy \u2013 the export sector in China and Germany and commercial property in other advanced economies, for example \u2013 and insufficient in others \u2013 infrastructure investment in many western countries. To bring about such a shift of resources \u2013 both capital and labour \u2013 will require a much broader set of policies than simply monetary stimulus.\u201d\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\nHe added: \u201cIt is the failure to face up to the need for action on many policy fronts that has led to the demand stagnation of the past decade. And without action to deal with the structural weaknesses of the global economy, there is a risk of another financial crisis, emanating this time not from the US banking system but from weak financial systems elsewhere.\u201d\n\nKing said it was time for the Federal Reserve and other central banks to begin talks behind closed doors with politicians to make legislators aware of how vulnerable they would be in the event of another crisis.\n\nHe said: \u201cCongress would be confronted with a choice between financial armageddon and a suspension of some of the rules that were introduced after the last crisis to limit the ability of the Fed to lend.\u201d", "description": "Past crashes spawned new thinking and reform but nothing has changed since 2008 banking meltdown, says former Bank of England boss", "authors": ["Larry Elliott", "Larry Elliott In Washington", "Mohamed El-Erian"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c4905976b350c556874a1d63ee85475779083bd/0_188_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=24ea07a19b45cda269f5f80a0d8bfc2c", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
