Which Home Did He Choose?", "language": "en", "text": "Paul Rizza was on a bike ride in the Bronx one day in the spring of 2018 when he found himself in Joyce Kilmer Park, along the Grand Concourse, and realized that he might finally want to leave Manhattan.\n\nMr. Rizza had been living mostly in a string of Manhattan sublets since moving to New York in 2007, always with roommates. At the time, he was renting a two-bedroom on Fifth Avenue in Harlem. As the area gentrified, housing values soared and his share rose to $1,300 a month.\n\n\u201cFirst a Whole Foods opened, and it was, \u2018Oh great, I can buy my organic sausages, but my rent is going up,\u2019\u201d Mr. Rizza, 50, said. \u201cThen Shake Shack. Those things are indicative that the neighborhood is changing.\u201d\n\nHe was offered only one-year lease renewals, and his landlady would remind him that she was doing him a favor by keeping the rent low for the area. \u201cIt bothered me,\u201d Mr. Rizza said. \u201cI was living on favors. I had no sense of control over my living environment.\u201d\n\nSaddled with student-loan debt, he didn\u2019t think he could buy a co-op unit. \u201cUnder $160,000 was my comfort zone,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a one-time splurge \u2014 it\u2019s a 30-year splurge.\u201d\n\n[Did you recently buy or rent a home in the New York metro area? We want to hear from you. Email: thehunt@nytimes.com]\n\nAt one point last year, he visited a $310,000 studio in Harlem: a room with one window and one sink. \u201cIt was awful,\u201d he said. \u201cThose sorts of things discouraged me. How could it be so expensive?\u201d\n\nOn the day he and a friend rode their bikes over the Madison Avenue Bridge, which connects Harlem to the South Bronx, Mr. Rizza found himself drawn to the area, with its Art Deco style and working-class feel. Soon after, he visited a two-bedroom on the Grand Concourse, listed at $285,000. At the open house, he met Deborah Miller, a licensed agent at Halstead. He was surprised that she was willing to help someone in his price range.\n\n\u201cIn this neighborhood, just over the water, it was a whole different ball of wax,\u201d Mr. Rizza said. \u201cMy needs were simple \u2014 basic comforts that in New York are sometimes hard to find.\u201d\n\nThat meant a kitchen that allowed for cooking and a living area with room for a table \u2014 \u201ca substantial table, not an Ikea two-person table that falls over if you put something heavy on it,\u201d he said.\n\nGood public transit was important, too. Mr. Rizza commutes to the East Side, where he works at a skin bank for burn victims, and to Stamford, Conn., where he is a naturopathic practitioner and acupuncturist.\n\nThe area near Yankee Stadium was convenient for him. \u201cIf a friend says, \u2018Can you meet me in a half-hour downtown?\u2019 I want to be able to throw on some shoes and go,\u201d he said.\n\nAmong his choices:", "description": "A longtime Manhattan renter migrated north to find a comfortable home for about $150,000.
