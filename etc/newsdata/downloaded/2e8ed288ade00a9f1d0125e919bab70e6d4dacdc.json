The big leagues are prepared to participate in this discussion for something new if they are treated the same.\u201d\n\nUnder the changes, the fourth-placed side - which was Tottenham Hotspur last season - would most likely revert to the previous criteria of pre-season qualification. Another option would be for the leagues to abandon the berth altogether.\n\nOlsson said the current allocation of 13 Champions League proper matches en route to the final is the ideal amount, and he is vehemently opposed to talk of a new elite European league competition spearheaded by Juventus chairman Andrea Agnelli, head of the European Club Association.", "description": "The Premier League faces losing an automatic Champions League place under proposals being discussed by the European leagues.", "authors": ["Tom Morgan", "Sports News Correspondent", "Jim White"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/08/TELEMMGLPICT000211868359-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BquULC-Sc0EYkuqxR93ihx-aMN6lNdBPeAWXeLWFnjWkI.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
