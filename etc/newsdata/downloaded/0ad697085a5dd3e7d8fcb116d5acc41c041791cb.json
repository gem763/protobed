REUTERS/Charles Mostoller\n\nAll three have been stalled by successful legal challenges by environmental groups alleging the administration failed to apply the regulatory scrutiny required under the law.\n\nThe Republican administration tried to accelerate permits for two multi-billion-dollar natural gas lines and jumpstart the long-stalled Keystone XL crude oil pipeline that would start in Canada. Judges halted construction on all three over the past two years, ruling that the administration granted permits without conducting adequate studies or providing enough alternatives to protect endangered species or national forests.\n\nThe delays have caused the two giant gas pipelines - Dominion Energy Inc\u2019s Atlantic Coast and EQM Midstream Partners LP\u2019s Mountain Valley - to increase their cost estimates by hundreds of millions of dollars, according to the companies. The Atlantic Coast pipeline may never be completed unless the U.S. Supreme Court overturns a lower-court decision blocking its planned route, analysts said.\n\nLawsuits alleging regulatory lapses are not new, but they were unsuccessful during the administration of Trump\u2019s predecessor, Democrat Barack Obama. Plaintiffs lost five separate lawsuits alleging regulatory failures during Obama\u2019s administration, according to a Reuters review of court filings for major interstate gas pipes built since 2010.\n\n\u201cEnvironmental groups definitely have been going after these pipelines more aggressively,\u201d said Amy Vazquez, Houston-based partner at the law firm of Jones Walker, who specializes in energy litigation. \u201cIt\u2019s probably because they\u2019re having a fair bit of success.\u201d\n\nThe White House declined to comment. An Energy Department spokeswoman did not comment on the litigation but said the administration remains committed to streamlining energy infrastructure development.\n\nD.J. Gerken, senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center in Asheville, North Carolina, represented the Sierra Club and other environmental groups in cases challenging the Atlantic Coast pipeline. He said the administration\u2019s rush to help industry move faster invited the legal challenges.\n\n\u201cPressure from the utilities that stand to benefit from this project and the Trump administration produced flawed permits,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018MYSTERIOUS\u2019 REGULATORY REVERSAL\n\nIn the case of Dominion\u2019s 600-mile (966-km) Atlantic Coast gas pipeline, from West Virginia to North Carolina, the U.S. Forest Service originally expressed skepticism about the project in 2016 when Obama was president, requesting alternative designs. But after Trump took office, the Forest Service changed course, and issued permits and a waiver for the line to cross the Appalachian Trail on national forestland in Virginia.\n\nPetitioners including the Sierra Club, an environmental advocacy organization, sued the Forest Service, alleging the agency violated three federal acts in issuing a construction permit.\n\nIn December 2018, the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the Forest Service decisions, with Judge Stephanie Thacker noting in her ruling that \u201cthe Forest Service\u2019s serious environmental concerns that were suddenly, and mysteriously, assuaged in time to meet a private pipeline company\u2019s deadlines.\u201d\n\nThe court said the Forest Service lacked authority to allow Dominion to build across the Appalachian Trail, which is administered by the Department of Interior. The Forest Service declined to comment.\n\nIn July, in another Atlantic Coast case brought by groups including the Sierra Club and Defenders of Wildlife, the Fourth Circuit vacated a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service permit. Chief Judge Roger Gregory ruled that the agency, in \u201cfast-tracking\u201d decisions, lost sight of its mandate to protect threatened species.\n\nThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service declined to comment.\n\nAtlantic Coast\u2019s original cost estimate of $6 billion to $6.5 billion has risen to $7 billion to $7.5 billion, the company said. The projected completion has shifted from late 2019 to late 2021.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court in October agreed to hear the Appalachian Trail case and could overrule the decision halting construction across that route.\n\nDominion has stopped construction on the pipe since December 2018. Spokesman Aaron Ruby said the company is confident the high court will rule in its favor and \u201cuphold the longstanding precedent allowing pipeline crossings of the Appalachian Trail.\u201d\n\nRISING COSTS, LEGAL RISKS\n\nThe Fourth Circuit appeals court also stopped work on EQM\u2019s 303-mile (488-km) Mountain Valley gas pipe from West Virginia to Virginia in June 2018, agreeing with the Sierra Club and other plaintiffs that permits issued by the Army Corps violated West Virginia rules related to stream crossings.\n\nThe state has since altered its rules, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is in the process of issuing new permits for this pipeline and Atlantic Coast. But the Sierra Club is still challenging a Fish and Wildlife Service permit in a case that also is being heard by the Fourth Circuit.\n\nEQM originally expected to complete Mountain Valley by the end of 2018 at a cost of $3.5 billion. The company said publicly that it expected the pipeline, which is mostly complete, will cost up to $5 billion and enter service in mid-2020.\n\nDiana Charletta, chief operating officer at EQM, said that recent court decisions \u201chave brought uncertainty and a high-level of scrutiny to the agencies\u2019 decisions.\u201d\n\nOfficials at both Dominion and EQM dispute that approvals were fast-tracked. Dominion pointed out that it filed its application to build Atlantic Coast in 2014.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any person can look at the regulatory review process for Atlantic Coast pipeline and say that it was fast-tracked,\u201d said Ruby, the Dominion spokesman.\n\nEFFORT TO REVIVE KEYSTONE STALLS\n\nTC Energy Corp\u2019s $8 billion Keystone XL pipeline, originally blocked by Obama in 2015, was revived by Trump in 2017 with the issuance of a presidential permit for the line, which would ship crude from Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast.\n\nFederal Judge Brian Morris in Montana blocked work on the pipe in November 2018, citing a lack of due diligence by federal regulators regarding greenhouse gas emissions and Native American land rights.\n\nSlideshow (19 Images)\n\nThe Trump administration tried to circumvent that ruling by rescinding its original presidential permit and issuing a new one in March. That second permit now faces legal challenges from Native American groups.\n\nTC Energy said it continues to monitor U.S. legal and regulatory issues while it plans construction. \u201cWe are committed to Keystone XL as it remains an important project for our company and for North America,\u201d said Terry Cunha, spokesman for TC Energy.\n\nCanadian producer Suncor Energy said in early September that the uncertain U.S. political landscape makes it unclear that the pipeline will be built. \u201cThat\u2019s one a lot of people are doing soul-searching about right now,\u201d said Suncor CEO Mark Little.", "description": "The Trump administration's effort to cut red tape and speed up major energy projects has backfired in the case of the three biggest U.S. pipelines now planned or under construction.", "authors": ["Scott Disavino", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438792786&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF980RR", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
