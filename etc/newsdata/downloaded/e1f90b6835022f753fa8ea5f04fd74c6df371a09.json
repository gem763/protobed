He died like a coward. The world is now a much safer place,\" Trump said in a grisly Sunday morning address to the nation.\n\nBaghdadi died after running into the end of a tunnel, \"whimpering and crying and screaming all the way,\" as he was chased by American military dogs, Trump said. Accompanied by three young children, Baghdadi then ignited his suicide vest, killing himself and all three children, the president said.\n\nThe ISIS leader was targeted near Barisha, Syria. American forces used eight helicopters through airspace controlled by Russia and Turkey. No Americans were killed in the raid, but Trump said one of the military dogs was injured.\n\n\"Baghdadi's demise demonstrates America's relentless pursuit of terrorist leaders,\" Trump said. \"He was a sick and depraved man, and now he's gone.\"\n\nThe death of Baghdadi, who was a dangerous enemy of the U.S. and its allies in the Middle East, brings an end to a yearslong international manhunt that spanned two U.S. presidential administrations.\n\nBaghdadi, 48, was arrested by occupying American forces in 2004 and was detained at the Abu Ghraib prison before joining Al-Qaeda in Iraq. He has led ISIS since 2010. He was last seen alive in a video in April, in which he sat cross-legged on the ground and praised the Easter Sunday terrorist attacks against churches in Sri Lanka.\n\nTrump said that an on-site DNA test confirmed Baghdadi's death just 15 minutes after he was killed, and that American troops brought back \"body parts\" from the scene. The ISIS leader's death has been incorrectly reported several times in previous years.\n\nThe military operation comes after Trump's controversial decision to withdraw troops from Syria, clearing the way for a Turkish military operation against the Kurds, who fought alongside the U.S. to defeat the Islamic State.\n\nFor Trump, the operation against Baghdadi is a significant victory in the battle against the Islamic State, as well as a counterpoint against critics that have condemned him for withdrawing the troops from Syria.\n\nThough Baghdadi's death is a success for the U.S. and its allies, the deaths of past terrorist leaders leaders have not led to total victory. Former President Barack Obama ordered a raid that killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in 2011, but the terrorist group managed to reconstitute itself and gain a foothold in Syria.", "description": "Baghdadi killed himself and three children at the dead end of a tunnel, \"whimpering and crying and screaming all the way,\" Trump said.", "authors": ["Emma Newburger"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106206021-1572188131983ap_19121519623695.jpg?v=1572188196", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
