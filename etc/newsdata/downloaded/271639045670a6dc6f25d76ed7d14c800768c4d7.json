But enough. The fact is, despite its clumsy process, the Booker Prize has done a great service: Its self-induced controversy has given an astonishingly creative, insightful and humane writer the worldwide attention she has long deserved. Evaristo\u2019s \u201cGirl, Woman, Other,\u201d available next week in the United States, is a breathtaking symphony of black women\u2019s voices, a clear-eyed survey of contemporary challenges that\u2019s nevertheless wonderfully life-affirming.\n\nAlthough the novel\u2019s structure sounds daunting, \u201cGirl, Woman, Other\u201d is choreographed with such fluid artistry that it never feels labored. The story begins just hours before the debut of a play at the National Theatre in London, and it ends 450 pages later as the audience spills into the lobby. But during that brief window of time, Evaristo spins out a whole world. Novella-length chapters draw us deep into the lives of 12 women of various backgrounds and experiences. There\u2019s nothing forced about the virtual exclusion of white characters from this novel; they have simply been shifted to the periphery, relegated to the blurry sidelines where black characters reside in so much literary fiction written by white authors.\n\nThe complex movements of this large group could easily have overwhelmed all but the chess masters among us, but Evaristo doesn\u2019t shove us into the whole crowd at once. Instead, we meet these women in a series of elegantly layered stories. Young and old, some become rich, most are struggling along. A few are embittered, while others are full of hope. They fall in love with men and women, and they challenge the limits of that binary structure. They rise from a vast palette of racial and national backgrounds stretching from Northern Europe to Africa. Some, particularly the older ones, worry about their heritage being washed away in the insistent flow of white culture. As the novel progresses, their connections accrue gradually, allowing us moments of understanding spiked with surprise. Together, all these women present a cross-section of Britain that feels godlike in its scope and insight.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCentral to this cast of characters is Amma, a bold, feminist playwright finding unexpected renown in her 50s. She had \u201cspent decades on the fringe, a renegade lobbing hand grenades at the establishment that excluded her,\u201d Evaristo writes, \u201cuntil the mainstream began to absorb what was once radical and she found herself hopeful of joining it.\u201d With a swirling production called \u201cThe Last Amazon of Dahomey\u201d about to open a sold-out run at the National, Amma is anxious and proud, thirsty for acclaim but wary of the inevitable compromises.\n\nIn a sense, Evaristo has imagined into being one of the possible trajectories of her own life. In the early 1980s, passionate about acting but unable to find work, she co-founded a theater company for black women \u2014 the first in Britain. Although fiction rather than theater became the focus of her career, like Amma, she has produced a number of highly inventive feminist works that explore the function of race. And now, in a most delightful coincidence, both author and protagonist have been propelled to a whole new level of fame.\n\nAmma is the Big Bang of \u201cGirl, Woman, Other,\u201d from which the universe of this novel expands in all directions. Her only child, Yazz, is a sardonic 19-year-old riding a fresh wave of sexual politics that regards her mother\u2019s feminism as embarrassingly antique. Evaristo notes that Yazz has a unique style: \u201cpart 90s Goth, part post-hip hop, part slutty ho, part alien.\u201d Hypersensitive to hypocrisy (in others), Yazz is quick to mock her mother\u2019s newfound wealth one moment and wheedle for spending money the next. Her college girlfriends draw us down other avenues of England\u2019s complex racial metropolis.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, the opening of the play reminds Amma of her old friend, Dominique, and their time in the Bush Women Theatre Company, a group once determined to produce work \u201con their own terms.\u201d In those early days, Dominique became enthralled with \u201ca teetotal, vegan, non-smoking, radical feminist separatist lesbian housebuilder\u201d who lectures all their friends on \u201cthe racial implications of stepping on a black doormat rather than over it, of not wearing black socks (why would you step on your own people?), and don\u2019t ever use black garbage bags.\u201d She eventually lures Dominique away to a \u201cwimmin\u2019s commune\u201d called Spirit Moon, a place vaguely reminiscent of Toni Morrison\u2019s \u201cParadise.\u201d\n\nWith the passage from gentle empathy to steely realism to wry satire, one marvels at the dimensions of Evaristo\u2019s tonal range. \u201cGirl, Woman, Other\u201d is a novel so modern in its vision, so confident in its insight that it seems to grasp the full spectrum of racism that black women confront, while also interrogating black women\u2019s response to it.\n\nBut just as crucial to this novel\u2019s triumph is Evaristo\u2019s proprietary style, a long-breath, free-verse structure that sends her phrases cascading down the page. She\u2019s formulated a literary mode somewhere between prose and poetry that enhances the rhythms of speech and narrative. It\u2019s that rare experimental technique that sounds like a sophisticated affectation but in her hands feels instantly accommodating, entirely natural. It\u2019s just the style needed to carry along all these women\u2019s stories and then bring them to a perfectly calibrated moment of harmony \u2014 a grace note that rings out after the orchestral grandness of \u201cGirl, Woman, Other\u201d draws to a perfect close.\n\nRon Charles writes about books for The Washington Post and hosts TotallyHipVideoBookReview.com.\n\nRead more:\n\nGirl, Woman, Other\n\nBy Bernardine Evaristo\n\nBlack Cat. 452 pp. Paperback, $17\n\nAD", "description": "At least Evaristo is finally enjoying some well-deserved attention.", "authors": ["Ron Charles", "Critic", "Book World"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/PAVqw93-4ukcI-MkRERmmvI1z2g=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DNSSLIXWOEI6TDHQJTEZ65GRE4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
