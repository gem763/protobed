Much like the iPad Pro, this iPhone model comes in an optional larger size and offers some additional features that its less expensive sibling lacks. And of course, it's more expensive.\n\nThe biggest difference between the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro is the Pro's third camera: a 12-megapixel telephoto lens. That extra lens makes it possible to shoot with a closer optical and digital zoom and take photos in Portrait Mode from two different perspectives. You can choose to take a portrait with the telephoto camera to get a shot that more closely focuses on the subject, or take one that's more zoomed out using the wide-angle lens to get a portrait that captures more of the background.\n\nThere are also some important discrepancies when it comes to their sizes and screens: the iPhone 11 comes with a 6.1-inch LCD display, while the iPhone 11 Pro comes in either a 5.8-inch or 6.5-inch size and features an OLED screen that's brighter and offers better contrast and deeper blacks than the iPhone 11.\n\nThe iPhone 11 Pro also has a textured matte design made of glass and stainless steel, while the iPhone 11 features a more glossy build made of aluminum and glass. The Pro model is also more water-resistant than the standard 11; it can withstand being submerged in up to four meters of water for as long as 30 minutes, while the 11 can only endure two meters of submersion.\n\nAnd if you need the most storage possible on your iPhone, you'll want to check out the Pro. The Pro comes in 64 GB, 256 GB, and 512 GB storage options, while the iPhone 11 is available in 64 GB, 128 GB, and 256 GB capacities.\n\nRead more: Apple Watch Series 5 review: Apple's smartwatch just got a whole lot better at its most important job\n\nOtherwise, the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro share many of the same features: they both have 12-megapixel wide-angle and ultra-wide-angle cameras, run on Apple's new A13 Bionic chip, support Face ID, have a 12-megapixel camera for taking sharper selfies, and support Apple's new Night Mode for taking better photos in the dark.\n\nIf you're trying to decide between the iPhone 11 and the iPhone 11 Pro, consider which features matter to you most. If you feel like having that third telephoto camera lens and the option for more storage space and a larger screen are important to you, then the Pro might be the best choice for you. But keep in mind you'll be paying at least an extra $3oo to get those perks compared to the less expensive iPhone 11.", "description": "Apple now sells its new iPhone 11 and 11 Pro alongside old models like the iPhone XR and iPhone 8.
