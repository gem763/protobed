(Picture: AMC)\n\nWarning: Contains spoilers for Breaking Bad, obviously.\n\nBreaking Bad is back in the spotlight with the release of follow-up movie El Camino, but it\u2019s perhaps been a while since your last encounter with Walter White and co.\n\nThe new Netflix movie picks up directly after events in Breaking Bad season five, which saw Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) drive to freedom after escaping his white supremacist captors.\n\nConsidering the show began way back in 2008, concluding in September 2013, you might be left scratching your heads when it comes to remembering where exactly the characters ended up.\n\nNeed a refresher? Here\u2019s what happened to the key characters in Breaking Bad after the season five finale.\n\nWalter White\n\nWalter White at the end of Breaking Bad (Picture: AMC)\n\nWalter White (Bryan Cranston) died from a gunshot wound inflicted during his assault on Jack Welker\u2019s (Michael Bowen) hideout, after mowing down his white supremacist supporters with a modified M60 machine gun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalter shoots Jack in the face, similarly to how Jack killed Hank (Dean Norris), allowing a captured Jesse Pinkman to escape. As Jesse gets out of his handcuffs, Walt passes the gun to Jesse and tells him to shoot him. Jesse, in tears, refuses unless Walt tells him he wants it.\n\nWalt assures Jesse he wants to die, but Jesse drops the gun. It\u2019s argued Jesse notices Walt\u2019s gunshot wound and tells Walter to \u2018do it himself\u2019, although it could be seen as Jesse finally breaking away from Walter\u2019s grip over him once and for all, leaving on his own terms.\n\nAfter telling Lydia (Laura Fraser) he poisoned her with ricin over the phone and seeing Jesse depart, Walter enters Jack\u2019s meth lab and looks nostalgically over the equipment, before he dies on the floor as the police arrive.\n\nJesse Pinkman\n\nJesse Pinkman flees Jack\u2019s compound at the end of season five (Picture: AMC)\n\nIn season five, Jesse is kidnapped by white supremacists and forced to cook meth for leader Jack, who is the uncle of Walter White\u2019s drug distributor Todd (Jesse Plemons).\n\nAfter the death of Jesse\u2019s girlfriend Jane (Krysten Ritter) back in season two, Jesse is dealt another heartbreaking blow after he refuses to cook anymore meth for Jack\u2019s group. As punishment for his refusal and trying to escape, Todd forces Jesse to watch as he kills his girlfriend Andrea (Emily Rios) with a silenced pistol at her home, sparing her kid Brock (Ian Posada). What happens to Brock after the death of his mother is unknown.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter Walt invades the compound and rescues Jesse from captivity, killing Jack and Todd in the process, Jesse gets in Todd\u2019s El Camino car, where he\u2019s seen laughing and crying hysterically as he drives to freedom.\n\nSkyler, Walter White Jr, and Holly\n\nWalter White Jr splits up Skyler and Walter from fighting (Picture: AMC)\n\nAfter assisting Walter White in his crimes, Skyler (Anna Gunn) is interrogated by the DEA for information on him. Later that night, she is ambushed by Todd and the neo-nazi group, who warn her not to say anything about Lydia\u2019s involvement in Walt\u2019s activities after meeting her previously.\n\nSkyler is later forced to move to an apartment with daughter Holly and Walter Jr (RJ Mitte) after all her assets are seized by the DEA. She takes a job as a taxi dispatcher.\n\nWalt meets Skyler one last time, where he confesses he built his drug empire for his own enjoyment and not to help the family, contrary to what he always claimed. Skyler lets Walter hold Holly one last time, before he hands Skyler a lottery ticket with the coordinates for Hank and Gomez\u2019s burial site \u2013 presumably so she can strike a deal with the DEA for her freedom.\n\nAfter discovering the truth about his father, Walt Jr can\u2019t bring himself to forgive him for his crimes. In their last exchange over phone, Walt Jr yells at his father, \u2018You killed Uncle Hank!\u2019 repeatedly, before telling him to go die himself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalt Jr is last seen as Walter notices him walking back home from school to their new apartment. Realising he doesn\u2019t want anything to do with him, Walt leaves him alone.\n\nHank and Marie Schrader\n\nMarie and Hank watching Walt\u2019s confession is one of the show\u2019s best scenes (Picture: AMC)\n\nHank is executed by Jack during a confrontation in the desert, along with his partner Steven Gomez (Steven Michael Quezada).\n\nHank\u2019s wife Marie Schrader (Betsy Brandt), unaware of his death, forces Skyler to admit everything to her son Walt Jr, which encourages Skyler to turn against Walter in order to protect her family.\n\nMarie finds out about Hank\u2019s death from Walter over the phone, while she attempts to comfort the family when he runs off with daughter Holly. As the Schrader household is searched for Jesse Pinkman\u2019s confession tape evidence, Marie is sent to a safehouse following concerns for her safety.\n\nIt\u2019s believed Skyler and Marie broke off contact following the incident, with Marie\u2019s last moments on the show seeing her warn Skyler that Walter White is back in the area over the phone, telling her to keep safe.\n\nJimmy McGill aka Saul Goodman\n\nWalter White and Saul Goodman had one last chat (Picture: Ursula Coyote/AMC)\n\nAfter Heisenberg\u2019s identity is revealed, Saul is given a new identity and heads off to Nebraska to protect his own skin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore he departs, he encounters Walter White one last time who is also waiting to be extracted from New Mexico. As Walter tries to convince Saul to stay together, he refuses, which prompts an angry outburst.\n\nHis attempt at intimidating Saul is cut short, however, by a coughing fit due to his cancer, which prompts Saul to say, \u2018it\u2019s over\u2019, before he heads out for his new life. His future is later explored in spin-off Better Call Saul, where he works at a shopping mall under the name Gene Takovic.\n\nMike Ehrmantraut\n\nMike had a tragic end (Picture: AMC)\n\nMike is killed by Walter White after the latter blames him for everything which has gone wrong in the aftermath of Gus Fring\u2019s death \u2013 enraging Walter to the point where he shoots him.\n\nMike manages to make his way towards the river bank with a bullet wound, before Walter tries to apologise. \u2018Shut the f**k up, and let me die in peace,\u2019 Mike replies, as he passes away by the river.\n\nSkinny Pete and Badger\n\nBadger and Skinny Pete will be back for El Camino (Picture: AMC)\n\nSkinny Pete (Charles Baker) and Brandon \u2018Badger\u2019 Mayhew (Matthew Lee Jones) are Jesse\u2019s close friends who assist with the distribution of drugs.\n\nIn season five, Badger and Skinny Pete help Walter trick Elliott and Gretchen Schwartz into believing he had hired hitmen to track them, ensuring they give his fortune to Walt Jr.\n\nBoth of them are set to encounter Jesse in El Camino after he escapes the white supremacist group.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nEl Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie releases 11 October on Netflix.\n\nMORE: Breaking Bad creator finally confirms Walter White\u2019s fate ahead of El Camino release\n\nMORE: Breaking Bad brings back Old Joe for El Camino movie \u2013 but will he help Jesse?", "description": "Ahead of El Camino, here's a guide to the whereabouts of Jesse Pinkman, Walter White, Saul Goodman, and more after Breaking Bad.", "authors": ["Adam Starkey"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/breaking-bad-main-e809_1570633723.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
