So masterminds of a Delhi kidney transplant racket busted in 2016, have been found running a similar racket in Kanpur while they were out on bail. Underground kidney syndicates exploit the enormous demand-supply gap, luring poor donors with a meagre sum and extracting an exorbitant one out of the receivers. Overall the organ allocation system is perceived to be corrupt. Such lack of trust also keeps it from growing as needed.\n\nThe situation is far from ideal even in exemplar states. Tamil Nadu has received the Union health ministry\u2019s best performance award for organ donation four times in a row, with its transplant authority Transtan maintaining a registry of patients in various hospitals and allotting organs of brain dead patients to deserving patients. But there have been controversies about how organs are being allotted to VIPs out of turn. In any case, organs have been retrieved from only around 1,200 patients. Indeed, of the nearly four lakh people needing a kidney transplant across the country, only around 8,000 get it. A key reason is that 90% of kidney donations here come from a living donor but elsewhere a majority take place after death.\n\nIndia needs a major uptick in cadaver donations to reduce the demand-supply gap. Raising awareness is obviously necessary but this needs to be backed up by widespread availability of suitable medical infrastructure, such as the necessary surgical skills for removing and transplanting organs, and the facilities for speedily moving organs to where they are needed. States like Haryana, Punjab and Himachal Pradesh have very few retrieval centres, which keeps the organ donation rate forcibly low. Death can give life, if our organ donation ecosystem is overhauled.", "description": "Fruits of crime can outweigh its risks by a tempting margin.
