Read more\n\nHBO\u2019s hit fantasy drama has already beaten Frasier to become the most awarded scripted television series in Emmys history, and after winning last year\u2019s trophy for outstanding drama, it\u2019s predicted to do the same again. Earlier this month, the show picked up 10 awards at the Creative Arts Emmys that reward technical achievement, a strong sign of Academy support.\n\nBut America\u2019s biggest night of television is also set to be one of its most competitive. While the final seasons of awards stalwarts Game of Thrones and Veep may well go out with a bang, they face off against an acclaimed set of newcomers, including Succession, Pose, Killing Eve, Fleabag, Schitt\u2019s Creek and Bodyguard. Earlier this year at the Golden Globes, Killing Eve\u2019s Sandra Oh and Bodyguard\u2019s Richard Madden beat out their more established and frequently nominated competitors.\n\nGame of Thrones also enters the fray after arguably its most critically unpopular season. If the show does dominate Sunday\u2019s ceremony it will represent a bittersweet victory for HBO, which has yet to replicate the show\u2019s success with any of its blockbuster follow-ups. The network is currently in production for a prequel series starring Naomi Watts.\n\nThis year\u2019s nominees have also been criticised for their lack of diversity with just 24 above-the-line nominations for actors of colour, down from 2018\u2019s record 38 nods. Three major categories, lead actress in a comedy, supporting actress in a drama and supporting actress in a comedy, contain only white nominees. Throughout its history, just 10% of Emmy winners in the major acting categories have been of colour. Diverse winners this year could include Oh as well as the cast of Ava DuVernay\u2019s Netflix miniseries When They See Us.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jharrel Jerome in When They See Us.

Producer Don Mischer has claimed the decision will allow the show, airing this year on Fox, to be \u201ca little more unpredictable\u201d. Presenters this year include Angela Bassett, Gwyneth Paltrow, Naomi Watts, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Viola Davis, Ben Stiller and the cast of Keeping Up with the Kardashians.\n\n\u201cIf you have a host and an opening, that\u2019s 15 or 20 minutes you can\u2018t have to salute the shows,\u201d Fox Entertainment\u2019s chief executive, Dan Collier, said. \u201cThis is a pretty unique year for some of America\u2019s favorite shows going away.\u201d The night is set to include on-stage cast reunions for both Game of Thrones and Veep.\n\nIn recent years, the red carpet has been enlivened with political fashion statements and on Sunday, many stars are reported to be showing their support for the Memphis-based non-profit St Jude children\u2019s research hospital. Hollywood costume designer Arianne Phillips has created a gold pin which has been distributes to stars in attendance.\n\nLast year\u2019s biggest winners were Game of Thrones and the Amazon comedy The Marvelous Mrs Maisel. The year also brought the ceremony\u2019s lowest ratings to date, down 11% from 2017.", "description": "A host-less ceremony pits the divisive final season of the awards juggernaut against fresher contenders", "authors": ["Benjamin Lee"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5e122864e954b50986b61367e75eb6073a32290/233_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f7178a4c565acff77b0175d1319b9ec3", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
