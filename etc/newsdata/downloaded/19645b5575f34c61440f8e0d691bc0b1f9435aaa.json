Protests have turned violent over the result, with demonstrators burning ballot boxes and clashing with riot police in several cities.\n\nPreliminary results released hours after polls closed Sunday showed a tight margin between Morales and former leader Carlos Mesa, which would have prompted a runoff vote in December.
