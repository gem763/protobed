REUTERS/Yuri Gripas/File Photo\n\nThe IMF has previously warned of the continent\u2019s rising debt burden, largely the result of borrowing to plug gaping budget deficits in mineral- and oil-producing countries that followed commodities and crude oil slumps.\n\nIn its regional economic outlook, the Fund said public debt as a percentage of GDP had settled at about 55% on average.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen overall in the region is, by and large, debt levels beginning to stabilise,\u201d Abebe Aemro Selassie, director of the IMF\u2019s African Department, told Reuters.\n\n\u201cGoing forward I expect it to remain stable provided countries implement the budgets that they\u2019ve formulated.\u201d\n\nStill, seven countries - Eritrea, Gambia, Mozambique, Congo Republic, Sao Tome and Principe, South Sudan and Zimbabwe - are in debt distress, the IMF said. Nine others including Ethiopia, Ghana and Cameroon are at high risk of debt distress.\n\n\u201cNOT UNAFFECTED\u201d\n\nThe IMF projected regionwide economic growth of 3.2% this year, trimming an April forecast of 3.5%. It sees growth accelerating to 3.6% next year compared to its April projection of 3.7%.\n\nThose forecasts are more optimistic than World Bank projections released this month.\n\nThe Fund blamed the downward revision on suppressed global growth linked to trade tensions between the United States and China as well as output disruptions in African oil-exporting countries and weaker than expected growth in South Africa.\n\n\u201cThe region is not unaffected by what\u2019s going on globally,\u201d Selassie said.\n\nThe continent\u2019s most developed economy, South Africa is expected to grow just 0.7% this year and 1.1% in 2020, according to the report. Leading oil exporter Nigeria will grow 2.3% this year and 2.5% next.\n\nThe region\u2019s third biggest economy, Ethiopia, which is pursuing an ambitious reform programme under Nobel Prize-winning Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, is on track to record growth of 7.4% this year, the Fund said. That will slow slightly to 7.2% in 2020.\n\nMore generally, non-resource intensive African economies are expected to grow at an average of 6% this year, nearly three times faster than the continent\u2019s oil producers and more than twice as fast as other resource exporters.\n\nThe IMF projects inflation in the region to ease to 8% in 2020 from 8.4% this year. But, as with GDP growth, there are wide differences across countries.", "description": "Sub-Saharan Africa's public debt load is stabilising but the region's economies face mounting headwinds due to slowing global growth that will weigh on exports, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Friday.", "authors": ["Joe Bavier", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191019&t=2&i=1442635005&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9I08J-OZABS", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
