Markets are increasingly betting on a \"no-deal\" Brexit, given no divorce settlement has been agreed with the European Union.\n\nSome backers of Brexit see Britain's departure from the EU as an opportunity to revisit financial rules that are currently written in Brussels.\n\nBrazier said the way the EU bakes detailed rules into primary legislation meant they are \"inflexible\", but there is no need to weaken their substance.\n\n\"Looking ahead, we'll need a level of resilience in our system in future that's at least as great as currently planned,\" Brazier said.", "description": "BoE eyes reform to make long-term investment more attractive", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXNPEF811FQ_L.jpg"}
