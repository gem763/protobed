The NSW Liberal government has been working on proposals on national tax reform with the Victorian Labor government. \u201cThe states have an obligation to participate in reform to improve the federation, it can\u2019t simply come from the Commonwealth only,\u201d said Mr Perrottet. \u201cI\u2019m not putting a challenge to the Commonwealth, I want to work constructively with them in terms of how we can improve the system. \u201cI want taxes to be lower here in NSW, we\u2019ve already cut around $5 billion in taxes over the last four years but we want to have a tax mix that actually improves economic growth into the future.\u201d Image: News Corp Australia", "description": "Watch the Latest News.com.au Videos including Featured News Videos and Sports Videos and News Highlights.
