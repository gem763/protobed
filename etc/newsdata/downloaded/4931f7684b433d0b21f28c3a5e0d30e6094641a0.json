Indeed, the grave subject of whether or not to hand control of the Brexit process to those seeking to avoid no deal appeared to weigh particularly heavily on the shoulders of Jacob Rees-Mogg, who spent a significant portion of the time slouched on the government front bench.\n\nThe leader of the House of Commons was heavily criticised by fellow MPs, who accused him of showing contempt for parliament as he reclined on the green benches.\n\n\u201cNow, there\u2019s been a lot of talk about democracy tonight and the Leader of the House, who \u2013 I have to say \u2013 with his body language throughout this evening has been so contemptuous of this house and of the people,\u201d said the Green party MP, Caroline Lucas, as other MPs shouted at him to sit up.\n\nShe added, for the benefit of parliament\u2019s written record, that Rees-Mogg had been \u201cspread across three seats, lying out as if that was something very boring to listen to tonight\u201d.\n\nThe Labour MP, Anna Turley, called Rees-Mogg\u2019s slouching the \u201cphysical embodiment of arrogance, entitlement, disrespect and contempt for our parliament\u201d.\n\nAngela Rayner \ud83c\udf08 (@AngelaRayner) Jacob Rees-Mogg is almost lying down on the Tory front benches, l am half expecting his nanny to march into the chamber with a blanket, pillow and a hot cup of Horlicks for the poor man! \ud83d\ude33\n\nA lesser man might have jumped up, suitably admonished. Not Rees-Mogg, who remained in repose, grinning and shaking his head as he adjusted his glasses. He was sitting bolt upright, however, when the tellers returned soon afterwards to deliver the result: MPs had handed his government a crushing defeat in its very first Commons vote.\n\n\u201cMr Speaker, tonight\u2019s vote made even the Leader of the House sit up,\u201d quipped the former Tory MP, Anna Soubry.", "description": "Furious MPs criticise \u2018disrespectful\u2019 body language during crunch debate", "authors": ["Kevin Rawlinson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0e1ba00a48036d372e8f30f2c1670029406b59f/0_553_1914_1148/master/1914.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=95d6f9c1113171c1ac77cef20a5c5c4b"}
