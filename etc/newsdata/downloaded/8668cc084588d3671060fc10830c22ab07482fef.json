European Parliament President David Sassoli, after meeting the prime minister, questioned whether he had ever been serious about reaching a deal. In Brussels, negotiators from the two sides looked likely not to meet Wednesday.\n\nAny hope of a deal now rests with a meeting between Johnson and his Irish counterpart, Leo Varadkar, planned for Thursday or Friday. But neither side looks to have the political space to give the ground the other side needs.\n\n\u201cThe narrative seems to be leaning towards a blame game rather than actually trying to solve the issue,\u201d Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said in Dublin.\n\nHe spoke after a British official gave an account of a call between Johnson and Angela Merkel that accused the German leader of shifting the EU\u2019s position and making a deal less likely. That briefing itself followed a Spectator magazine article by an unnamed official in Johnson\u2019s office that suggested there was little chance of a deal and threatened retribution against EU countries backing a delay to Brexit.\n\nAll that goaded European Council President Donald Tusk into attacking Johnson on Twitter.\n\nIf there\u2019s no deal -- and the only point of agreement on all sides is that a deal is unlikely -- then Johnson says the U.K. will leave the EU without one Oct. 31. His own government\u2019s reports suggest this could cause economic chaos, principally for the U.K. and Ireland, but also for the EU. But Johnson also says he will comply with the law, which requires him to seek and accept a delay to Brexit from the EU.\n\nIn either scenario, the prime minister is likely to seek an election, asking the public either for a mandate to leave the EU without a deal, or for approval for having done so. But though some in Johnson\u2019s office are enthusiastic about such a fight, many of his ministers and members of Parliament have doubts -- when they backed Johnson to lead them, he reassured them that the chances of a no-deal Brexit were a million-to-one.\n\nThe core disagreement with the EU remains, as it has been for most of the last three years, on the question of the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. It was a subject to which Johnson and his team paid little attention when they campaigned for Brexit in 2016. Now, unless they can find a way past the problem, their ability to deliver Brexit at all could be in doubt.\n\nTuesday\u2019s descent into acrimony was focused on the offer that Johnson put on the table last week. He proposed that Northern Ireland, which is part of the U.K., leave the EU\u2019s customs union, and suggested the border could be controlled with limited customs checks away from the frontier. But Varadkar says any checks at all will put at risk peace in Northern Ireland, which suffered decades of terrorism.\n\nFive Charts Say Boris Johnson Ends Up in a Ditch: Trading Brexit\n\nThey disagree, too, about how the people of Northern Ireland should give their democratic consent to any agreement. Johnson proposes giving a regular sign-off to the region\u2019s assembly, which hasn\u2019t met for nearly three years because of internal disagreements. For Ireland and the EU, this threatens regular bouts of uncertainty.\n\nBut according to an official in Johnson\u2019s office, speaking on condition of anonymity, this offer was made in good faith, in the belief that Varadkar and the EU were ready to make a move in return. That came after discussions between the two men in September, on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.\n\nIt was during Johnson\u2019s call with Merkel on Tuesday morning that it sank in that this wasn\u2019t going to happen. Johnson told Merkel that the negotiations were like a boat stuck on rocks, and that he needed her help lifting it off. He asked her what was needed.\n\nClear Unease\n\nAccording to one British account, it was at this point that Merkel told the prime minister he would have to accept that Northern Ireland would stay in the customs union for ever. Another British official said this had been Johnson\u2019s characterization of the situation, but added that the call had been very bad from a British perspective.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Follow @Brexit\u00a0and\u00a0sign up to our Brexit Bulletin.\u00a0The U.K.-European Union Brexit talks have turned into an angry stalemate, as leaders focused on blaming each other for refusing to budge.In London, Boris Johnson\u2019s administration accused the EU on Tuesday of adopting a new, harder position", "authors": ["Robert Hutton", "Ian Wishart"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cdMZEmE5skyO1veS0mZGZA--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/0adb8a36eec9c8a87b8b613373cbaae9", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
