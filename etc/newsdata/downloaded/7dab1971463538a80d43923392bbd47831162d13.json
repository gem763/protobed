He paid attention to me and even cooked me dinner and set up a candlelit bath for us,' she said.\n\nThe woman said although she attempted to keep up the 'charade' once her partner returned from business, being a terrible actor meant she eventually caved and told him she'd been unfaithful.\n\nOne woman revealed she cheated because she realised she preferred a 'polyamorous' relationship model (stock image)\n\n'I needed to explore'\n\nOne woman shared how she cheated on her partner because she'd met him when she was far too young and the relationship had been too serious.\n\n'For me personally, I needed to go out and explore myself sexually and even in different relationship dynamics,' she wrote.\n\nShe said cheating gave her an 'easy way out' as at the time she wasn't prepared to end the relationship.\n\n'It was a confusing time in my adult life as he was my best friend and we had no real issues,' she said.\n\nWhat are some of the reasons people cheat? The most common reason for infidelity cited by women is emotional satisfaction, while men cite sexual satisfaction. Affluent women are 8 per cent more likely to be unfaithful to their husbands than middle class wives, while the prevalence of infidelity for poor and rich men is equal. People who are unfaithful in one relationship are three times more likely to be unfaithful in their next relationship, compared to those who have not been unfaithful in the first one.

She said.\n\nEventually, her curiosity got the better of her and she said in a 'weak moment' the pair got together.\n\n'Frankly, the sex wasn\u2019t that great, probably because the whole situation felt wrong to me. I regretted it immediately, and felt horribly guilty.'", "description": "Hundreds of women have taken to Reddit to reveal the reasons they've cheated on their partners.
