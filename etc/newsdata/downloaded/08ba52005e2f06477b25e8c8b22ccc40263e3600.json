It would decimate communities and you would have the reverse multiplier.\u201d\n\nShutting the elite boarding school, which was founded in 1567, would \u201cruin\u201d Rugby town, he added.\n\n\u201cRugby town will lose its biggest employer which provides more than \u00a330m directly to the town every year. We employ over 600 support staff \u2013 that is not including the teachers,\u201d Mr Green said.\n\nHe added: \u201cWhat about the restaurants which survive because of us with our parents coming, our hotels which are in the local area, what about our local building firms that we have used for new buildings?\u201d\n\nThe head of the prestigious school said an \u201cattack on excellence\u201d was not the solution. Instead, he advocated independent schools should continue their partnership work with state schools.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The Labour Party is talking about gradually shrinking the private school sector and integrating schools into the state system in a managed way. Successful independent schools won\u2019t be forced to close overnight.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIt is wildly over the top to compare the gradual integration of the independent and state school sectors with the forced closure of the UK mining industry. Drawing this parallel is likely to cause great offence in many in ex-colliery communities.\u201d\n\nHolly Rigby, a state school teacher and co-founder of the Labour Against Private Schools campaign group, noted that Rugby School\u2019s alumni includes Conservative politicians \u201cwho crushed the miners\u2019 struggle\u201d.\n\nShe said: \u201cTo suggest that Rugby\u2019s attempts to hoard its privilege and power is similar to the miners\u2019 strike is grotesque.\n\n\u201cRugby educates the elite political class in this country, and there is no surprise they are trying to fight to defend their privilege whilst talented young people in state schools like mine are left behind.\u201d", "description": "A \u201cMargaret Thatcher mining crisis\u201d will take hold across the country if Labour pushes ahead with plans to abolish private schools, the headmaster of \u00a336,000-a-year Rugby School has said.", "authors": ["Eleanor Busby"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/04/16/rugby-school-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
