The politician previously suspended his campaign in late summer, but announced via Twitter that he is dropping out for good.\n\n\"I\u2019m announcing today that I am withdrawing from the Presidential campaign,\" Ryan said alongside a video. \"I got into this race in April to really give voice to the forgotten people of our country. I look forward to continuing that fight. Thank you, to everyone who supported this campaign.\"\n\nI\u2019m announcing today that I am withdrawing from the Presidential campaign.\n\n\n\nI got into this race in April to really give voice to the forgotten people of our country.

Ryan had failed to make the third debate and was polling at roughly at one percent in his best poll. The top three candidates in the Democratic Primary are still former Vice President Joe Biden, Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Mayor Pete Buttigieg is in fourth, but it looks like Sen. Warren could secure the top spot as her campaign continues.\n\nAs seen in the following clip, one of the cornerstones of Ryan's campaign was his belief in bringing back manufacturing jobs to middle America:\n\n\n\n", "description": ".10/24/2019 20:39:28PM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa", "Bronson Stocking", "Sarah Lee"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2016/335/7c2ffaf5-eb9e-4886-be4e-fa886b49a11a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
