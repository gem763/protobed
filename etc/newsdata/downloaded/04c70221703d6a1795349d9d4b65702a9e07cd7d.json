(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nPresident Trump continued to escalate his scorched-earth campaign against a whistleblower who accused him of pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rivals, even as new evidence emerged Monday that he and his administration are urging other governments to provide assistance to a related Justice Department inquiry that has been pushed by the president.\n\nTrump said he was trying to \u201cfind out about\u201d the whistleblower Monday, the latest move in an increasingly frenetic counterassault targeting the anonymous intelligence officer and top Democrats leading the impeachment inquiry. The comments came as his allies have struggled to coalesce around a clear strategy to respond to a fast-moving and quickly mounting threat to his presidency.\n\nThe ad hoc counter-impeachment effort developing around Trump underscores the risk the president faces as Democratic leaders plan to launch a probe aimed at proving that Trump abused his presidential powers in asking Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, a leading 2020 Democratic presidential contender, and his family as well as an unsubstantiated theory that Ukrainians worked with Democrats to interfere in the 2016 election.\n\nThe White House has not yet set up anything resembling a \u201cwar room\u201d to coordinate its response, and officials spent Monday in meetings trying to determine a path forward. The president\u2019s outside legal team downplayed the threat of impeachment and dismissed the need for the kind of coordinated war-room-based effort former president Bill Clinton relied on 20 years ago.\n\nSome Republican officials have stumbled in recent days in their attempts to defend Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, and others have pushed the White House to offer more guidance to its defenders by standing up a centralized and organized response effort.\n\nTrump\u2019s reelection campaign has taken a de facto lead role in hitting back against the president\u2019s detractors, but it has not been specifically tasked with a coordinating role, according to a person familiar with the matter who, like others, discussed internal strategy on condition of anonymity.\n\nOn Monday, Trump\u2019s defenders faced new revelations contained in a Washington Post story that Attorney General William P. Barr has held private meetings overseas with foreign intelligence officials seeking their help in his department\u2019s inquiry into foreign interference in the 2016 election \u2014 a probe that Trump hopes will discredit the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s conclusion that Russia sought to assist his campaign. It was also reported that the president used a recent phone call to ask Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison to provide help to this ongoing Justice Department investigation. The Trump-Morrison phone call was first reported by the New York Times.\n\nAs he faces mounting accusations of wrongdoing, Trump is leading his own defense effort, largely from his Twitter account. He is using the kind of bluster and bravado that have come to define his presidency.\n\n\u201cThe Fake Whistleblower complaint is not holding up,\u201d he said Monday on Twitter, after lamenting \u201cThe Greatest Witch Hunt in the history of our Country!\u201d\n\nWhile the tactical logistics of Trump\u2019s legal and political defense were still being sorted out, there was a sense of agreement among the president\u2019s aides and allies that attacking Trump\u2019s detractors would be a key part of the strategy.\n\n\u201cWe are not on the defense for impeachment,\u201d said one campaign official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. \u201cWe are on offense to show the American people this is a coup d\u2019etat by elitist bureaucrats and Democrats.\u201d\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham accused the media of \u201chysteria\u201d and said Trump had \u201cdone nothing wrong\u201d in a phone call in which he encouraged Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate Biden and his son Hunter over the younger Biden\u2019s former position with a Ukranian private gas company \u2014 an arrangement Trump and his allies allege was corrupt.\n\nHunter Biden served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment. Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation. As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases. At the time, the investigation into Burisma was dormant, according to former Ukrainian and U.S. officials.\n\nRudolph W. Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal attorney, has taken a lead role is pushing Ukraine to investigate Biden as well as the theory that Ukranians worked with Democrats to undermine Trump\u2019s campaign in 2016. On Monday, the three House committees leading the impeachment effort issued a subpoena demanding Giuliani turn over all records pertaining to his contacts regarding Ukraine, the Biden family and related matters.\n\nThe committees have also subpoenaed information from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who is scheduled to leave Monday night for a six-day trip to Italy, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Greece. He is not due to return until Sunday, meaning he will be out of the country when a Thursday deadline passes for the State Department to deliver House committees documents related to Trump\u2019s July call with Zelenskiy.\n\nJay Sekulow, Trump\u2019s personal attorney, called the Democrats\u2019 impeachment effort \u201cabsurd,\u201d and claimed that his team\u2019s experience dealing with special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s extensive investigation into the Trump White House offered a template for how to deal with impeachment.\n\n\u201cWe just went through a war without a war room and that was the Mueller probe, and that worked out well,\u201d he said, describing impeachment as more of a \u201cskirmish.\u201d\n\nTrump will be the chief messenger in the response effort and his allies will likely take cues from him, said Sekulow.\n\nSome Republicans say that\u2019s the problem. In the past few days, Trump has called for the whistleblower to be unmasked, suggested that House Intelligence Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) should be arrested for treason and amplified the comment of a supporter who said impeachment could create a \u201cCivil War like fracture\u201d in the United States.\n\nBehind the scenes, the president is sounding out a range of advisers for different options, speaking to friends, outside confidants and Republican lawmakers to get advice about how to proceed, according to a senior administration official.\n\n\u201cThere are different ways to bake the cake, depending on what sort of cake you want,\u201d the official said. \u201cDifferent flavoring, different temperatures, different ingredients yield different types of cake, and the president as the master baker is testing recipes and deciding what type of cake he wants.\u201d\n\nSome Republicans have pushed the White House to set up a more organized approach, and have lamented that there\u2019s no clear plan or strategy to follow.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a cliche that Trump doesn\u2019t think anyone can defend him the way he can defend himself, but they need to try, because right now it\u2019s just him tweeting about Adam B. Schiff,\u201d said a Republican congressional aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss their view of White House\u2019s plan.\n\nTrump\u2019s reelection campaign, well capitalized from record fundraising and well-staffed after an early hiring effort, has taken a lead role in defending the president.\n\nWhile the campaign has not been officially designated as the central engine of Trump\u2019s impeachment response, it has sought to take the mantle as the most well-equipped to do so, according to a person familiar with the matter. The campaign, which has been operating since the first day of Trump\u2019s presidency, has the manpower and experience to mount a rapid response effort complete with video content, talking points and campaign ads, said this person.\n\nThe Trump campaign released a television ad on Friday that painted Democrats\u2019 impeachment effort as an attempt to \u201csteal\u201d the election. The campaign said it was spending $10 million to air the ad on cable and online.\n\n\u201cThe American people see this for what it is: yet another attempt by Democrats to disenfranchise the American people by removing a duly elected President that they disdain,\u201d campaign spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said.\n\nTrump allies are also considering running television ads that target roughly two dozen Democratic House members who won in districts that Trump carried in 2016, to argue that those members are not doing the work of the American people while they\u2019re busy focusing on trying to impeach the president. Marc Short, Vice President Pence\u2019s chief of staff, is one of those supporting this idea.\n\nIn addition to attacking Democrats, the president will also need to keep Republicans on board, as GOP lawmakers have been far from united in defending Trump\u2019s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nTrump\u2019s former homeland security adviser, Thomas Bossert, said Sunday he was \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d by Trump\u2019s conduct on the call.\n\n\u201cIt is a bad day and a bad week for this president and for this country if he is asking for political dirt on an opponent,\u201d he said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\nRep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said Sunday it was \u201cbeyond repugnant\u201d that Trump had raised the specter of civil war.\n\nAnd House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy had to defend his use of White House talking points while answering questions about the call in an interview that aired Sunday on CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if Trump\u2019s conduct on the call was \u201cappropriate,\u201d McCarthy dodged the question and said Trump \u201cdid nothing in this phone call that\u2019s impeachable.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Michael Steele, a former chair of the Republican National Committee, posted a video on Twitter of a woman trying to use a broom to push crashing waves back into the ocean, describing the futile effort as the GOP\u2019s \u201cnew strategy to address the #WhistleblowerComplaint.\u201d\n\nRepublicans are having a difficult time defending the president because the White House summary of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky, released last week, is so damning, said Lanny Davis, who helped Clinton navigate the impeachment process as a media surrogate.\n\nIn the summary, Trump told Zelensky to do him a \u201cfavor\u201d by working with Barr to investigate various allegations, including unsubstantiated claims of corruption by Biden.\n\n\u201cThe statement speaks for itself,\u201d said Davis, a lawyer who now specializes in crisis management. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to spin it. You can\u2019t spin the sentence, \u2018Do me a favor.\u2019\u201d\n\nCarol Morello contributed to this report.", "description": "The ad hoc counter-impeachment effort developing around Trump underscores the risk the president faces as Democratic leaders plan to mount a sober and surgical probe aimed at proving that Trump abused his presidential powers in asking Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate his political rivals.", "authors": ["Toluse Olorunnipa", "White House Reporter", "Ashley Parker", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/m5eTu6A8NDK92RQ0UihowPX_Avc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UWSUCLXDW4I6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
