'I don\u2019t think England have got going. They had a lucky break, a penalty after five minutes, and you\u2019re thinking they\u2019re maybe going to kick on from there.\n\n'They\u2019ve been really sloppy, Henderson and Rice \u2013 they might as well sit with us in the studio.\n\nKeane also reserved harsh words for England left-back Danny Rose and accused him of lacking effort in the first half.\n\n'Danny Rose is strolling out there, Gareth needs to give him a bit of a rollicking,' he added. 'I\u2019m sure he will do.\u2019\n\nFriday night's clash is the first of two Euro 2020 qualifiers during the international break, with Bulgaria the opposition on Monday.", "description": "Roy Keane tore into the performances of Jordan Henderson and Declan Rice after their first half performance during England's Euro 2020 qualifier against Czech Republic.", "authors": ["Alec Fenn For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/21/19606060-0-image-a-26_1570824934037.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
