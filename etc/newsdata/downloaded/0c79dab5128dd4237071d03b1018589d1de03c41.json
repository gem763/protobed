An estimated 108,000 cubic meters of untreated sewage washes into the Mediterranean Sea every day from the enclave. (Loay Ayyoub for The Washington Post)\n\nThe sea was once Gaza\u2019s only escape, the one place in this tiny enclave where residents could depart from their entrapped lives, if only for an hour.\n\nBut now a ceaseless conflict that seems to impinge on nearly every aspect of life here has claimed the Mediterranean, too. Because of skyrocketing levels of water pollution, attributable to political and economic turmoil, the 25-mile coastline is now another barrier in a place where barriers are all too common.\n\nPeople still come to watch the waves. They still stop to savor the salty breeze. But these days, many stop short of swimming. Even in the heat of summer, to swim is now to tempt fate.\n\n\u201cThis is the only place to exhale, in Gaza,\u201d said Rawya Thalenty, 37, a mother of six, sitting on the beach with a friend on a recent evening and gesturing at the water. \u201cThere are no options here in Gaza. This is truly the only place we can go.\u201d\n\nMore than a decade into a strict land, sea and air blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt to exert pressure on Hamas, the Islamist militant group that has controlled Gaza since 2007, the enclave is in the midst of a water crisis born of the region\u2019s combustible politics.\n\nThe three wars Hamas has waged with Israel since 2009 have devastated the Gaza Strip\u2019s already weak sanitation system.\n\n\n\nYoung men and boys play on an obstacle course set up on the Mediterranean shore. Many Gazans have stopped swimming in the ocean over fears of contamination. (Loay Ayyoub for The Washington Post)\n\nOn top of that, Gaza\u2019s sewage treatment plants sit idle many hours a day without the electricity to power them. That\u2019s because the Palestinian Authority, based in the West Bank, has sought to undermine popular support for its rival Hamas by halting payments to Israel for the fuel used to generate electricity in Gaza.\n\nIsrael has played power politics as well. Earlier this week, following an uptick in rockets fired into Israel from Gaza over the weekend, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the limited amount of diesel fuel Israel ships for electricity generation to be cut in half.\n\nSome studies have estimated that as a result of inadequate treatment, up to 108,000 cubic meters of untreated sewage is now discarded directly into the sea every day, and reserves of potable water have significantly diminished. A public health emergency now looms for the nearly 2 million Palestinians who live in the Gaza Strip, many of whom are refugees and the descendants of refugees from the 1948 war that established Israel\u2019s independence.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, waterborne diseases constitute about one-fourth of all illnesses in the Gaza Strip. A 2018 study by the Rand Corp. was likewise clear in its conclusion, predicting an imminent spike in bacterial, parasitic and viral infections such as cholera, giardia and viral meningitis, respectively.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just sitting,\u201d said Jabar Shamalakh, 21, sprawled on a plastic chair at the beach on a recent afternoon, at the center of a circle of his friends. He said it had been five years since he had been in the water. For his friend Loay Hamouda, 23, it was three years. For Ahmad Arafat, 21, a year and a half.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s deeply frustrating,\u201d Arafat said. \u201cI miss the sea. I used to surf sometimes. But now I can\u2019t.\u201d Shamalakh paused for a moment when asked what he missed most about feeling the water on his skin.\n\n\u201cJoy,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s clear, we feel the joy.\u201d\n\n\n\nA cascade of wastewater from the Baydar area of Gaza pours into the Mediterranean Sea. (Loay Ayyoub for The Washington Post)\n\nThe sheer amount of sewage washing into the sea has had consequences for the wider region \u2014 including for Israel, where the nearby coastal city of Ashkelon has experienced the effects of Gaza\u2019s sanitation breakdown. A study published in March by \u00adEcoPeace Middle East demonstrated that sewage from Gaza had washed up on nearby beaches, as well as interfered with the operations of Ashkelon\u2019s desalination plant.\n\nEarlier this year, Israel pledged to build both a fourth water pipeline into Gaza as well as a new sewage pipeline to treat some of Gaza\u2019s waste on the Israeli side of the border. The Persian Gulf country of Qatar, meanwhile, has tried to address the electricity shortage in Gaza but has not supplied enough money to pay for the estimated 400 to 600 megawatts the enclave needs every day.\n\nEngineers in Gaza argue that Israel\u2019s blockade has made adequate sewage treatment almost impossible.\n\nHousam Badawi, an electrochemical engineer, is overseeing the construction of a new central Gaza waste-management plant, a project that was initially slated for completion in 2005.\n\nThe reason for the delay, Badawi said, is that Israeli authorities have classified certain items and materials required for completion as \u201cdual use,\u201d meaning they could also be used to build weapons.\n\nThe new facility is funded by KfW, a German development bank, which will continue to pay a fraction of operating costs upon completion. Thomas Gaier, a German project manager on the site, said the work is now being hamstrung because of a dispute over measuring instruments, which he said Israeli authorities have held up for more than three months.\n\n\n\nWater pollution from wastewater deposits appears on the shore of the Mediterranean. (Loay Ayyoub for The Washington Post)\n\nCOGAT, the organization within the Israeli Defense Ministry that coordinates Israel\u2019s activities in Palestinian territories, confirmed in a statement that the measuring devices were classified as \u201cadvanced dual use technological equipment.\u201d But COGAT also said that KfW had been granted a permit for this equipment but had failed to procure the devices within the required 30-day \u00adwindow after the permit was issued.\n\nThe delays on the new facility, slated to process 60,000 cubic meters of sewage, have contributed to the unabated flow of sewage into the sea, with three other plants able to treat only about 85,000 cubic meters of the daily waste.\n\nMost Gazans seem aware of the pollution flowing into the Mediterranean, but many cannot bring themselves to abandon the beach.\n\n\u201cThe beach is the only source of life for Gazans \u2014 especially when the electricity is out in their homes,\u201d said Abulraheem Abu Qumbuz, director of the Gaza municipality\u2019s water sanitation department. \u201cWe consider it as a lifeline in the summer particularly.\u201d\n\nIn some areas, the putrid stench is inescapable. And if the crowds still come in the heat of summer, they mostly just sit and watch. Young children do still frolic in the water, but only because their parents say they have neither the resolve nor the heart to stop them, regardless of sanitation worries.\n\n\n\nChildren play in the Mediterranean despite wastewater pollution. Parents say they do not have the resolve to stop them amid the daily miseries of political and economic turmoil. (Loay Ayyoub for The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned about it, but I can\u2019t prevent the kids, because they see others swimming and they just start crying,\u201d said Alaa Louh, 30, who was sitting on the sand, watching her two young sons and daughter splash in the waves.\n\nIn an enclave where the average monthly salary is roughly $420 a month and 53 percent of residents live below the global poverty line of $2 per day, the beach is free.\n\nMiddle-class and well-to-do Gazans tend to do their swimming at private pools, which they can access with a day pass at one of the strip\u2019s few hotels. Or they may opt for more privacy and rent coveted chalets that come with pools, compounds that can cost between $100 and $200 per day. For most, that is out of the question.\n\n\u201cIf I could afford to go to a swimming pool \u2014 or a chalet \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t hesitate. But I can\u2019t,\u201d said Mohammad Tota, 19, who was swimming for the first time this year in what he said was a celebration for moving on to his university studies.\n\nFor him, the liberating sensation of being in the water was worth any price. \u201cPlaying in the water and feeling the waves releases the stress and lets you forget your problems,\u201d Tota said. \u201cIt reminds me of my childhood and better times.\u201d\n\nCorrection: Some 53 percent of Gaza residents live below the global poverty line. An earlier version of this article misstated the figure.\n\n\n\nMen play in the waves with their dogs.
