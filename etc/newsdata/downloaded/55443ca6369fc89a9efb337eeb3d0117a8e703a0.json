Grand Bahama, with a population of about 50,000, is only 100km (60 miles) east of West Palm Beach in Florida.\n\nDorian is travelling west at just 5mph (7km/h).\n\nThe NHC said the hurricane would \"continue to pound Grand Bahama Island\" through much of the day and evening on Monday.\n\nImage caption Dorian's position at 03:00 GMT Monday\n\nThere was little information overnight from the affected Bahamas islands amid power cuts and limited internet access.\n\nHowever, video and tweets posted by Latrae Rahming, a former aide to ex-PM Perry Christie, showed severe damage on the Abaco Islands, home to about 17,000 people.\n\nCars have been flipped over, roofs torn off and water at the coast is shown to have reached roof level at some points.\n\n\"We have lost the economy of Abaco. Praying for safety and lives,\" Mr Rahming tweeted.\n\nOne video as the storm hit carried a desperate plea for help:\n\nHigh winds and torrential rainfall have also struck Grand Bahama. The Tribune website reports that Grand Bahama International Airport is said to be under water.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Matt Taylor presents an update on Hurricane Dorian\n\nJoy Jibrilu, director general of the Ministry of Tourism and Aviation, said on Sunday afternoon: \"It's devastating. There has been huge damage to property and infrastructure. Luckily, no loss of life reported.\"\n\nHowever, Eyewitness News later carried an interview with a grandmother who said her eight-year-old grandson had drowned on the Abaco Islands.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Hurricane Dorian seen from the International Space Station\n\nThe government has opened 14 shelters and names dozens of churches, schools and other buildings on its official lists of emergency shelters.\n\nBut as sites become full, there is concern that people will be forced to take refuge in other places that aren't listed to receive food and water from the government.\n\nHow has the Bahamas prepared?\n\nThe country is one of those most regularly hit by hurricanes, and homes are required to be reinforced to withstand the winds of a category four storm.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption An image from social media of Marsh Harbour in the Abaco Islands\n\nPrime Minister Hubert Minnis did announce an evacuation order for parts of Grand Bahama and the Abaco Islands, All tourists were asked to leave.\n\nBut officials expressed dismay that some people had chosen to stay.\n\nMr Minnis said: \"I can only say to them, that I hope this is not the last time they will hear my voice and may God be with them.\"\n\nThe visibly upset prime minister said in a news conference on Sunday: \"This is probably the most sad and worst day of my life. We're facing a hurricane... that we've never seen in the history of the Bahamas.\"\n\nWhat about the US?\n\nAlthough Dorian is currently heading westwards, it is forecast to make a gradual turn north or north-west, taking it along the eastern US seaboard, making its landfall point, if any, uncertain.\n\nThe NHC said a slow weakening was expected but Dorian would remain \"a powerful hurricane during the next few days\" and would \"move dangerously close to the Florida east coast\" on Monday night through to Wednesday evening.\n\nPresident Donald Trump cancelled a planned trip to Poland last week and has met emergency management officials.\n\nHe told reporters on Sunday that the storm \"looks monstrous\" and the US east coast would \"be ultimately impacted and some of it very, very severely\".\n\nDorian has grown larger in size, with hurricane-force winds extending up to 45 miles (75km) from the storm's centre.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Hurricane preparations in Port Salerno, Florida\n\nPresident Trump has issued a federal state of emergency for Florida, and the state's governor, Ron DeSantis, has activated 2,000 National Guard troops, with another 2,000 on standby.\n\nMr DeSantis warned people not to be complacent following the change in the storm's predicted path. \"This storm at this magnitude could really cause massive destruction,\" he said.\n\nGetty Images Commonwealth of the Bahamas Capital: Nassau Population 391,000\n\nArea 13,939 sq km (5,382 sq miles)\n\nMajor language English\n\nMajor religion Christianity\n\nLife expectancy 72 years (men), 78 years (women)\n\nCurrencyBahamian dollar Source: UN, World Bank\n\nPopular attractions, including Disney World in Orlando, have said they are \"closely monitoring\" the storm. Miami has ordered the removal of electric rental scooters from the streets to avoid them becoming projectiles.\n\nSouth Carolina on Sunday issued a mandatory evacuation of the entire coast, effective of noon on Monday and affecting 830,000 people. Georgia then followed suit.\n\nHow destructive are category five hurricanes?\n\nWith sustained wind speeds of at least 157mph they are relatively rare, although four other storms reached this level in the last three years:\n\nMichael made landfall in Florida last year, causing 59 deaths and about $25bn (\u00a320bn) in damage. It was the strongest storm to make landfall in the US in 26 years and only the fourth hurricane of this category to have hit the country\n\nmade landfall in Florida last year, causing 59 deaths and about $25bn (\u00a320bn) in damage.

Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.\n\nWarm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. \"Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face.\"\n\nFlorida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017) The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.\n\nThis eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land.\n\nThese storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. \"Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye. MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!\"\n\nTweet from the National Hurricane Center The size of hurricanes is mainly measured by the Saffir-Simpson scale - other scales are used in Asia Pacific and Australia. Winds 119-153km/h\n\nSome minor flooding, little structural damage.\n\nStorm surge +1.2m-1.5m Winds 154-177km/h\n\nRoofs and trees could be damaged.\n\nStorm surge +1.8m-2.4m Winds 178-208km/h\n\nHouses suffer damage, severe flooding\n\nStorm surge +2.7m-3.7m Hurricane Sandy (2012) caused $71bn damage in the Caribbean and New York Winds 209-251km/h\n\nSome roofs destroyed and major structural damage to houses.\n\nStorm surge +4m-5.5m Hurricane Ike (2008) hit Caribbean islands and Louisiana and was blamed for at least 195 deaths Winds 252km/h+\n\nSerious damage to buildings, severe flooding further inland.\n\nStorm surge +5.5m Hurricane Irma (2017) caused devastation in Caribbean islands, leaving thousands homeless \"For everyone thinking they can ride this storm out, I have news for you: that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life.\"\n\nMayor of New Orleans Ray Nagin ahead of Hurricane Gustav, 2008 Click arrow to proceed Loading ...
