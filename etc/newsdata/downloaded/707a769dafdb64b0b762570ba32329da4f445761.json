Macron ordered a commission of researchers and historians to investigate the \"role and involvement of France\" in Rwanda from 1990-1994. It is to make conclusions within two years.\n\nKagame has won praise ending that violence and making advances in economic development and health care, although he is criticized for authoritarian control.\n\nEthnic reconciliation is a cornerstone of the rule of Kagame, Rwanda's de facto leader since the genocide ended in 1994 and the country's president since 2000. He is credited with bringing Rwanda stability, economic growth, and improved health and education.\n\nHowever, Kagame's critics charge that he is intolerant of criticism and his government is repressive, jailing opposition leaders. Some opponents say that Rwanda's reconciliation is forced.\n\nA quarter-century after the genocide, bodies of victims are still being found. Last year, authorities in Rwanda found discovered mass graves they say contain 5 400 bodies of genocide victims.\n\n\"Twenty-five years on, the victims and survivors should remain the center of everyone's thoughts, but we should also take stock of progress and the need to ensure accountability for all those who directed these horrific acts,\" Human Rights Watch said.\n\nKEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter.\n\n- FOLLOW News24 on Twitter", "description": "Rwanda somberly commemorated the start, 25 years ago, of its genocide in which some 800 000 people were killed, as the country continues to grapple with the lasting consequences of the slaughter.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7950/54c3ac1da4cf4e888c7d3c0aadf568eb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-04-07"}
