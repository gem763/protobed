His first instinct was to call his mother in New York", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE\n\nDr. Gregg Semenza was awarded the 2019 Nobel Prize for Medicine or Physiology (Photo: Johns Hopkins University)\n\nNEW YORK \u2013 It was shortly before 4 a.m. Monday that Dr. Gregg Semenza received \u201cthe call\u201d from the Nobel Committee informing him that he had won the 2019 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine.\n\n\u201cA call in the middle of the night on this particular day? It's a good idea to answer the phone,\u201d he told The Journal News in a phone interview from his office at the John Hopkins University School of Medicine in Maryland.\n\nHis first instinct after he hung up the phone: To call his mother in Tarrytown, New York.\n\nAfter several tries, Semenza, a Tarrytown native and 1974 graduate of Sleepy Hollow High School, finally got through.\n\n\u201cIt was very early in the morning and she told me that she had gotten some crank calls in the middle of the night and she was very upset,\u201d said Semenza. \u201cBut we ended up talking, and she was happy and very emotional.\u201d\n\nCell research: Nobel prize in medicine awarded to three scientists\n\nThe academy recognized Semenza, 63, the C. Michael Armstrong Professor of Medicine at Johns Hopkins, for studies on how cells respond to low oxygen levels. The research is believed to have the potential to result in treatments for a variety of illnesses including blood disorders, blinding eye diseases, cancer, diabetes, coronary artery disease and other conditions.\n\nThe prize was awarded jointly to Semenza; William G. Kaelin Jr., who teaches at Harvard University; and Sir Peter J. Ratcliffe, of the University of Oxford in England, at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm.\n\nFor Semenza, it all began in Tarrytown.\n\nHe credits his Sleepy Hollow biology teacher, the late Dr. Rose Nelson, for sparking his interest in science.\n\n\u201cMy high school biology teacher Dr. Rose Nelson was a real inspiration for me. And she taught us not just the facts of biology, but the excitement of the discoveries and about the scientists who made the discoveries,\u201d said Semenza. \u201cShe made the science come alive. She was a tremendous inspiration for me and helped me get my first research experience.\u201d\n\nMore: Controversy stalks Nobel Peace, Literature prizes\n\nThe eldest of five children, Semenza, whose mother was an elementary school teacher and father a social worker, described Tarrytown as a \u201cpicture perfect\u201d place to have grown up.\n\n\u201cI was really lucky to grow up in Tarrytown and to go to Sleepy Hollow High School because there were so many great teachers there and it really made the difference,\u201d said Semenza. \u201cAnd I think that there has to be more emphasis on teachers and supporting teachers because of the important role they have in society.\u201d\n\nTarrytown Schools Superintendent Chris Borsari said the district was \u201cincredibly proud\u201d of Semenza\u2019s accomplishment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to hear that he recalls some special people here in this district that set him on that path of inquiry and study. His research is now going to be benefiting countless people who are suffering from cancer and a number of other illnesses,\u201d said Borsari.\n\nGreta Thunberg: 'Alternative Nobel Prize' for her 'inspiring' climate change advocacy\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just incredibly proud as a community and hopefully it's an indicator that even from humble beginnings, with the help of the community and a supportive school system, motivated kids can really do anything.\u201d\n\nThe academy recognized Semenza for his groundbreaking discovery of hypoxia-inducible factor 1, or HIF-1, the protein that switches genes on and off in cells in response to low oxygen levels.\n\nThe discovery, along with Semenza's additional work clarifying the molecular mechanisms of oxygen regulation in cells, has implications in understanding a variety of diseases.\n\n\"This is a momentous day for all of us at Johns Hopkins, and we are immensely proud,\" said Ronald J. Daniels, president of Johns Hopkins University. \"Gregg's passion for discovery and the energy with which he pursues that passion exemplify Johns Hopkins' commitment to create new knowledge that helps make a better and more humane world.\n\n\"That hunger to always know more is what makes Gregg and our Johns Hopkins faculty so extraordinary.\"\n\nSo, what\u2019s next for the Nobel laureate?\n\n\u201cWe plan to work in the lab and learn more about the system and, hopefully, that'll lead to new treatments,\u201d said Semenza. \u201cThat's our major goal and that doesn't change, so we'll continue those efforts.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/07/nobel-prize-winner-gregg-semenza-calls-mom-new-york-news/3905291002/", "description": "2019 Nobel laureate Gregg Semenza of Tarrytown credits his teachers in Sleepy Hollow, New York, with sparking his interest in science.", "authors": ["Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy", "Published P.M.
