Photos from the Note 10 often look overly processed.\n\nYou can edit the photos to look less processed with pretty good results, but it\u2019s still an extra step to improve the photos.\n\nVisit BusinessInsider.com for more stories.\n\nThe Galaxy Note 10 Plus I\u2019ve been using has been an absolute treat, especially after using the Pixel 3 for several months.\n\nThe Note 10 is faster, smoother, and has significantly better battery life than the Pixel 3. By comparison, the Pixel 3\u2019s specs are sorely lacking. The 4 GB of RAM in the Pixel 3 just doesn\u2019t cut it for speed, and the phone has notoriously poor battery life. Plus, the Pixel 3 started at $800 at launch, which isn\u2019t cheap, especially for a smartphone with questionable performance.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the S Pen \u2013 I\u2019m a big fan of the S Pen. I don\u2019t need it, but it\u2019s been incredibly useful to scribble down spur-of-the-moment thoughts and reminders. And the S Pen makes more complex tasks on the Note 10 less daunting by offering more precise taps.\n\nBut when it comes to taking photos, I mostly wished I had the Pixel 3 and its single lens instead of the Note 10 Plus and its three camera lenses.\n\nSee why I wished I had the Pixel 3 instead of the Note 10 for taking photos:\n\nFirst off, I want to make clear that the Note 10 can take great photos!\n\nsource Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nIn fact, I actually prefer the Note 10\u2019s photo over the Pixel 3\u2019s here. But this is a a rarity.\n\nsource Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nI should also mention that the Note 10\u2019s ultra-wide camera gives you options that the Pixel 3 doesn\u2019t have. I\u2019m a huge fan of having the option to seamlessly switch to an ultra-wide lens on the Note 10.\n\nsource Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nBut there are often things about the Note 10\u2019s photos that don\u2019t look right. It\u2019s like the Note 10 is allergic to shadows, contrast, depth. The lighting is completely flat, and the blue sky and buildings toward the back look fake.\n\nsource Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nThe Pixel 3\u2019s photo, on the other hand, gives you a much better sense of what I was looking at.\n\nsource Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nThankfully, if you don\u2019t like the Note 10\u2019s photo, you can edit them. This is an edited version of the Note 10\u2019s photo where I added a little contrast, toned down the brightness, and de-saturated the colors a little. Now, the photo looks like it has depth, and the buildings at the back don\u2019t look as fake.\n\ncaption I edited this photo straight from the Note 10 using the S Pen. In a way, the Note 10\u2019s large screen and S Pen is perfect for quick and more precise photo edits. source Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nThis photo from the Note 10 actually looks fine \u2014 until you see what the Pixel 3\u2019s photo below. You\u2019d never know from the Note 10\u2019s photo that the trees and the grass are different shades of green.\n\nsource Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nThe Pixel 3\u2019s photo reveals just how much extra processing the Note 10 adds to photos, and there\u2019s no option to turn off that extra processing. I\u2019ve tried turning off HDR on the Note 10, but it does nothing. I also tried turning off Samsung\u2019s Scene Optimizer to no avail.\n\nsource Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nAgain, you can edit the Note 10\u2019s photos if you don\u2019t like the way they look. I edited this on my Windows 10 laptop with Samsung Dex.\n\ncaption I basically just toned down the brightness and added a bit of contrast. Samsung\u2019s Photo Editor app is great for simple touch-ups, but to get the photo to look the way I like, I\u2019d need a more comprehensive photo editing app. source Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nFor this edit, I hooked up the Note 10 to my Windows 10 laptop and edited the photo through the Samsung Dex software. It basically shows a desktop version of the Note 10\u2019s Android operating system where I can use the Note 10\u2019s apps.\n\nI simply opened the Gallery app in Dex and edited the photo using my mouse and my laptop\u2019s screen. It\u2019s easier than editing photos on a smartphone screen, even one as large as the Note 10\u2019s 6.8-inch screen.\n\nThere are times when the Note 10\u2019s extra processing isn\u2019t a bad thing. The Note 10\u2019s photo below is more appealing than the Pixel 3\u2019s.\n\nsource Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nSometimes the Pixel 3\u2019s photo can look a little too dark.\n\nsource Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nRead more: I\u2019m seriously doubting the Google Pixel 3\u2019s dominance as the best smartphone camera after taking it on vacation\n\nI should also note that the Note 10\u2019s Night Mode is better than I initially thought.\n\ncaption Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t get an equivalent shot with the Pixel 3. source Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nAt the end of the day, the Note 10 can still take great shots of things that matter.\n\nsource Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nHowever, I still prefer the Pixel 3\u2019s camera. It isn\u2019t perfect, and I\u2019ve questioned its photos in the past. But it gives me more confidence than any other smartphone that it\u2019ll take a great shot. When I\u2019m testing phones these days, I often wish I was taking photos with the Pixel 3 instead.\n\nsource Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nThe Note 10\u2019s camera doesn\u2019t give me as much confidence that the photos will turn out well. Instead, I\u2019m usually fearing that it\u2019ll process the photo too much.\n\nEditing is a solution, and the Note 10 is the best phone for things like on-device photo editing. But I\u2019d really rather not have to go back and edit photos, if I can avoid it.", "description": "Business Insider - Not even the Samsung Galaxy Note 10's three camera lenses can beat Google's year-old Pixel 3, which has a single lens..
