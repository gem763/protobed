You\u2019ve got a pile of newspaper clippings about the strategy of the month. You bookmarked an article somewhere about the newest rotation to read later.\n\nBut, despite it all, you have a nagging feeling: There\u2019s got to be an easier way to invest.\n\nIf that sounds like you, it\u2019s time to get acquainted with factors.\n\nConsider factors the performance qualities of a stock that can be identified and tracked to create an investing strategy that outperforms the broader market. Factor investing isn\u2019t new \u2014 it dates back to the mid 1970s \u2014 but it\u2019s gotten a boost over the past few years from the proliferation of exchange-traded funds.\n\nIn fact, over $900 billion is now invested in about 820 ETFs that take this approach, according to FactSet data, meaning they use a rules-based approach to achieve better returns than the broader market, when adjusted for risk. (Funds constructed around factor-driven strategies are often called \u201csmart beta.\u201d)\n\nSee: Tired of market turbulence? These ETFs offer to define your financial outcomes\n\nOne of the firms that\u2019s led both academic research into factors and the push to develop investing strategies around them is Newport Beach, Calif.\u2013based Research Affiliates.\n\nA 2016 study led by Campbell Harvey, a professor of finance at Duke University\u2019s Fuqua School of Business and a senior fellow with Research Affiliates, surveyed the academic research into specific factors around which investment strategies are constructed and counted 316 distinct factors \u2014 an estimate he concluded was likely lower than the actual figure.\n\nJonathan Treussard, head of product management at Research Affiliates, said the firm\u2019s thinking about factors focuses around four big ones. (There\u2019s also a fifth \u2014 sort of. More about that in a bit.)\n\nRelated: In investing, it\u2019s better to think big picture\n\nMarketWatch spoke with Treussard about those four major factors.\n\nValue is familiar to most investors as describing Warren Buffet\u2019s approach: \u201cbuy low, sell high.\u201d As Treussard put it, \u201cIf you can find a disciplined way to find assets at a lower price, they tend to be better investments over the longer term. Good value for money spent makes just about as much sense in investing as in real life.\u201d\n\nAs MarketWatch has observed, momentum might be quickly, if crudely, described as \u201cbuy high, sell higher.\u201d If that sounds expensive, consider this: If there\u2019s a \u201cstock that everyone\u2019s talking about at the cocktail party,\u201d it\u2019s probably not a great value play \u2014 but if all the big players in the market are buying it, it\u2019s going to go up.\n\nValue and momentum may be the yin and yang of investment strategies: \u201cValue is a long-term trade,\u201d Treussard said. \u201cIt\u2019s cheap to implement but expensive from an emotional standpoint.\u201d Conversely, he said, momentum is expensive because it necessitates a lot of trading, \u201congoing repositioning of your positions, last month\u2019s hot stocks to this month\u2019s.\u201d\n\nFactors are concepts that ring true, but are also quantifiable. The value and momentum factors are market-based: Have enough investors piled into a stock to give it momentum? In contrast, the two other biggies are more fundamental, speaking to the characteristics of a company.\n\nThe low-volatility factor is easy to grasp but more mysterious to account for. Several decades of research show that less-volatile stocks outperform the broader market. It may simply be that if investors glom onto higher-flying stocks, then less-risky ones may become value plays.\n\nQuality refers not just to a company\u2019s management and governance but also to its results: Does it reliably produce strong earnings and maintain a healthy balance sheet? That also sounds intuitive, but, Treussard cautioned, it can get murky. Among other things, \u201cbeing highly profitable is both a blessing and a curse. Company management may not be fully aligned with shareholders and may make disappointing decisions,\u201d such as enriching themselves, expanding too fast or going into riskier ventures, he said.\n\nMany analysts place a fifth factor, size, among the primary themes, but, thanks to some recent research and advocacy among market leaders, it \u2014 like Pluto among the planets \u2014 has been booted. While there is an obvious logic to the narrative that smaller companies are more likely to be undervalued, some of the initial research that supported the idea has been disproved. \u201cWe are size skeptics,\u201d Treussard said. Also worth remembering: Smaller companies are more likely to be more volatile.\n\nTreussard argued that it\u2019s important for investors to understand the narrative behind each factor. \u201cYou have to come up with a rationale or a belief that you have to truly adhere to that a particular factor is robust enough to trust,\u201d he told MarketWatch.\n\nStill, because of the rules that underpin the approach, it\u2019s a strategy that\u2019s nearly impossible for most investors to do casually, and not really appropriate for applying to single securities.
