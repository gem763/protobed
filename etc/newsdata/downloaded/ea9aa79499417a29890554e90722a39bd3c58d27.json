Chancellor Sajid Javid will announce later that 14 major roads in England will be upgraded at a cost of \u00a325bn. He'll also say he's providing \u00a35bn for ultrafast broadband across the UK.\n\nImproving infrastructure is very much a theme of the conference, with the Conservatives saying more money can be made available, as public finances are in better shape following years of spending cuts.\n\nBut is there a danger other events might distract from what's happening in Manchester? On Sunday, Downing Street denied a claim that Mr Johnson squeezed journalist Charlotte Edwardes's thigh at a lunch in 1999. And the SNP has suggested a vote of no confidence in the government could happen over the next few days.\n\nThe slogan for the conference is \"Get Brexit done\", and there will be plenty of discussion of that - in Westminster and Manchester - this week too. Here are five things to look out for at the Conservative conference.\n\nSaudi prince warns of 'unimaginably high' oil prices\n\nSaudi Arabia's Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has warned of huge oil price rises if the world does not act to deter Iran's behaviour. This follows attacks on two Saudi oil facilities two weeks ago, which many countries have blamed on Iran - but which it denies. Here are the details of what the prince said.\n\nHeart attack treatment care 'not equal'\n\nBack in the 1960s, seven out of 10 heart attacks in the UK proved fatal. These days, seven out of 10 victims survive. But the British Heart Foundation says inequalities in diagnosis, treatment and aftercare mean that hundreds of women each year in England and Wales are dying unnecessarily.

Prince Harry - who, along with his wife Meghan, has come in for fierce criticism in the media recently - has hit back, saying it is unfair to call him a \"hippy\". Writing in the Daily Telegraph, he insists that humanity must fight \"greed, apathy and selfishness\" and protect nature to ensure its own survival.\n\nThe secret tapes of Jamal Khashoggi's murder\n\nBy Jane Corbin, Panorama\n\nBritish barrister Baroness Kennedy listened to Jamal Khashoggi's dying moments. \"The horror of listening to somebody's voice, the fear in someone's voice, and that you're listening to something live. It makes a shiver go through your body.\"\n\nKennedy made detailed notes of the conversations she heard between members of the Saudi hit squad. \"You can hear them laughing. It's a chilling business. They're waiting there knowing that this man is going to come in and he's going to be murdered and cut up.\"\n\nRead the full article\n\nWhat the papers say\n\nThe PM is in the headlines once more, with the Daily Telegraph reporting that Remain-backing opposition leaders will this week try to change the law forcing him to request an extension to the Brexit deadline within the next few days. The Guardian, meanwhile, says the allegation that Boris Johnson squeezed a female journalist's knee in 1999 will overshadow the Conservative conference. Metro, however, concentrates on a \"vile show of hatred\" in Manchester, where protesters have hung effigies to greet Tory members arriving at the conference centre. Elsewhere, the Sun says a \"monster\" hybrid savannah cat is on the loose in north London. Its headline? \"Purrminator.\"\n\nDaily digest\n\nDrink and drugs Mixing cocaine and alcohol \"a deadly combination\"\n\nCancer risk Firefighters call for more protection against harmful chemicals\n\nForever 21 Fashion retailer files for bankruptcy protection\n\nPrivate schools Labour plans to ban them would be a vote-loser, say head teachers\n\nIf you see one thing today\n\nDo we all dream the same?\n\nIf you listen to one thing today\n\nWho is Baroness Hale?\n\nIf you read one thing today\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nHow much rubbish does the UK produce?\n\nSign up for a morning briefing direct to your phone\n\nLookahead\n\nToday China holds its National Day celebration to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic.
