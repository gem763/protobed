According to a detailed road map released in 2017, the government expects the area defined as core AI to be worth 150 billion yuan (US$21.2 billion) by 2020, while related industries will reach 1 trillion yuan.\n\nBy 2025, those values are expected to exceed 400 billion yuan and 5 trillion yuan respectively, with widespread adoption of AI in smart manufacturing, smart health care, smart cities, smart agriculture and national defence infrastructure.\n\nBy 2030, China targets to lead the world in innovation and building a smart economy, according to the road map. The area defined as core AI will be valued at 1 trillion yuan, supported by related industries worth over 10 trillion yuan.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s still a long way to go before the technologies can play a major role in driving the world\u2019s second-largest economy, whose gross domestic product exceeded 90 trillion yuan in 2018, according to the scholars.\n\nNevertheless, the country has been pushing ahead with plans to integrate AI applications into all walks of life, with facial recognition used to catch criminals, verify exam-takers and to name and shame minor offenders such as jaywalkers and ticket scalpers.\n\nOther applications such as voice recognition and computer vision have also found their way into retail, finance and the health care sectors.\n\nYang added another cautionary point, saying the latest industrial revolution will see faster iterations of technologies.\n\n\u201cNext generation technologies are being prepared for adoption even before the previous generation becomes industrialised,\u201d she said, citing telecoms as an example where 5G has started to be deployed commercially before 4G is universal.\n\n\u201cWith ballooning research bills, new technologies will become more expensive and hence less certain for scalable adoption,\u201d she said.\n\nHowever, a recent report from McKinsey & Co argues that although the Solow Paradox may be back, it will be resolved just as it was in the 1990s when a few sectors \u2013 technology, retail and wholesale \u2013 led an acceleration of US productivity growth.\n\n\u201cToday, with digitisation, we are living in round two of the Solow Paradox,\u201d says the report. \u201cDigitisation contains the promise of significant, productivity-boosting opportunities \u2013 but the benefits have not yet materialised at scale.\u201d", "description": "Artificial intelligence and big data have been compared to oil and electricity in terms of their importance to future economic growth but will the hype live up to reality?A growing number of academics, including some Chinese scholars, are calling for a reality check on the much-touted fourth industrial", "authors": ["Sarah Dai"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MUXYcPurEs3Ys7LTY1UkJQ--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/south_china_morning_post_621/a07475f6c24767aa26568f3f36019608", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
