Today, just nine reactors are back in operation, having passed stringent safety checks introduced after the Fukushima meltdown.\n\nBut the government is unlikely to meet its target of 30 reactor restarts by 2030 amid strong local opposition and legal challenges.\n\nAlthough he faces potential opposition from inside the cabinet, Koizumi should at least receive the backing of his father, Junichiro Koizumi, a former prime minister who has emerged as a vocal opponent of nuclear power.\n\nWhile Japan debates the future of nuclear energy, the younger Koizumi, who has been tipped as a future prime minister, is now at the centre of a controversy over the future of more than a million tonnes of contaminated water stored at Fukushima Daiichi.\n\nOn Tuesday, his predecessor as environment minister said the plant\u2019s operator, Tokyo Electric Power, had no choice but to dilute the water and release it into the Pacific ocean rather than store it indefinitely.\n\nThe prospect of dumping the water into the sea has angered local fishermen and drawn protests from neighbouring South Korea.", "description": "Shinjiro Koizumi says: \u2018We will be doomed if we allow another accident to occur\u2019", "authors": ["Justin Mccurry"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22483b7055023665b4618296a39bb49d0f99b71a/1942_365_2705_1624/master/2705.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fa2c45c0ddc7f948d2b092384752157b", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
