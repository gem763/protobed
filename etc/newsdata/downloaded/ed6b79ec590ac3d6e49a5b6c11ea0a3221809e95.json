Some people want to do it the right way \u2014 determine what you want to say and to whom, and help you do so. But some only want to bring you in line with their idea of \u201ccorrect\u201d writing. They\u2019re pedants, who think there\u2019s only one right way to express yourself, and like all pedants, they\u2019d rather be right than smart. They\u2019re neither.\n\nThere are pedants for every area of knowledge: people who gatekeep under the guise of educating others. But they crop up often, and visibly, in the area of language, where everyone has experience, so anyone can pretend to be an expert. And editor Pippa Bailey roasts them in an essay about the evolution of language.\n\nUnwavering pedantry is not a love of language, but something uglier: a desire always to be right and to put others down. It is superior and elitist; language not as a means of communication but of status.\ufeff\n\nA pedant thinks that their language was handed down from on high in its current form. They ignore all the changes that formed the language as they speak it, and they decry every change since. They think language is fixed like a law of physics. This is like thinking that a dollar is worth a dollar because of the value of green ink. It\u2019s Steve Martin\u2019s joke about visiting France: \u201cThese people, it\u2019s like they\u2019ve got a different word for everything!\u201d\n\nPedants fail to recognise that language is always imperfect, that it does not exist outside the people who use it, that it is all literally made up. Even the book of Genesis says that God took all the animals, and \u201cbrought them to Adam to see what he would call them. And whatever Adam called each living creature, that was its name.\u201d Second chapter of the ultimate book of prescriptivism, and it specifically says that God didn\u2019t name the animals but waited to see what humans would call them.\n\n[Pedants] think language is fixed like a law of physics. This is like thinking that a dollar is worth a dollar because of the value of green ink.\n\nYou can similarly take apart any form of pedantry in any area of knowledge.\n\nBut it\u2019s especially easy to recognise in language, because we\u2019re all constantly using language every day, ignoring the \u201crules\u201d and letting the language evolve. Everywhere you\u2019ll see good writing that splits infinitives or starts with conjunctions or uses too many words, good speech that stutters and skips and trails off and interrupts. You\u2019ll see bad writing and bad speech that, for better or worse, also shift our common understanding of what\u2019s right.\n\nThere are plenty of rules to all that language. For example, it helps to spell words the same way as everyone else, or to use them only with meanings that your audience already accepts or can temporarily make room for. But each particular rule of language is flexible, and some writing can break many of them at once and still succeed.\n\nIn English, our most venerated writer is Shakespeare, who introduced 422 words into the language; you can see them all here. He worked in a time when the English language was in rapid flux. Thanks to the internet, we are in another time of rapid flux.\n\nThe pedant screams, \u201cIf you don\u2019t follow my rules, then you\u2019ll have no rules!\u201d This is simply untrue. Among English speakers alone, millions of people code-switch every day, speaking to friends one way, family another, work colleagues another.\n\nThey follow not one set of rules but several intersecting sets. And they have their own personal linguistic habits, favourite phrases, words they avoid, without expecting everyone else to share their preferences. The pedant sees a dialect that\u2019s not their own, and doesn\u2019t have the imagination to recognise it as a dialect.\n\nIt is not coincidental that the pedants support the language of those in power, and insult the language of the powerless as no language at all. Pedantry is political. Pedants will defend themselves by pointing to other political uses of language \u2014 like avoiding words that stigmatised disability, or using gender-neutral pronouns\u2014and claiming they\u2019re the same as pedantry.\n\nBut they\u2019re the opposite. These \u201crules\u201d make our language include more people, whereas pedantry excludes people. That is the essence of this war.\n\nThe good news is that the pedants are losing, have already lost. The bright lights of linguistics are people like Gretchen McCulloch, whose book Because Internet celebrates the recent evolutions of language as part of an ancient and never-ending process.\n\nEditors like Pippa Bailey call out pedantry and avoid it in their work at even the most mainstream publications. People follow the Twitter account New New York Times to cheer each time the stodgy newspaper tries out a word for the first time. Through playful social media accounts, dictionary makers use their own cultural authority to undercut itself. They\u2019d rather be smart than right. They\u2019re both.", "description": "Be careful when you ask for writing advice. Some people want to do it the right way \u2014 determine what you want to say and to whom, and help you do so.
