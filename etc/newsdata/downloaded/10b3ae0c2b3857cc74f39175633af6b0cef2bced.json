That\u2019s clearly good news, even if it results in worse figures on average hourly earnings.\n\n\u201cThis shows up as a deceleration in average wage growth, but it\u2019s actually a positive phenomenon,\u201d says Ernie Tedeschi, a policy economist for Evercore ISI.\n\nThat said, notes Michael Moran of Daiwa Capital Markets, employment by industry has not shown that kind of compositional shift.\n\nAnother point is that the wage growth for production and nonsupervisory workers \u2014 worker bees, in other words \u2014 has been stronger. In September, those wages grew 3.5% on a year-over-year basis.\n\nThe implication, then, is that supervisory pay growth is slower. Managerial pay can be quite volatile, it\u2019s worth remembering, however, before you lament the demise of the middle manager.\n\nAnother puzzle is that information-sector wage growth suddenly slowed. Andrew Hollenhorst, an economist at Citi, has called that decline \u201caberrantly large,\u201d which may reflect difficulties with seasonal adjustment.\n\nAnother possibility is that wage-growth data are being hurt by a massive demographic shift in America: the nation\u2019s aging workforce.\n\nWard McCarthy, chief financial economist at Jefferies, points out that wages for workers in the 25-to-35 age group average about 80% of those from the 55-to-64 bracket. As baby boomers leave the workforce, that naturally leaves replacements earning lower wages.\n\n\u201cConsequently, when four older workers reach retirement age and actually retire, it takes five younger workers to replace the income of the four older workers who retire,\u201d McCarthy points out.\n\nBut Tedechi notes that baby-boom retirements have been occurring for years, and they are unlikely to explain the sudden shift.\n\nHe adds that a more straightforward explanation might not be a satisfying one: that there\u2019s a modest softening in demand, which isn\u2019t enough to change the unemployment trajectory.\n\nU.S. stocks DJIA, +0.89% were stronger on Friday morning, and the yield on the 10-year Treasury TMUBMUSD10Y, -0.83% fell slightly to 1.52%, with yields moving in the opposite direction to prices.", "description": "In an otherwise solid jobs report, one question that emerged is why wages slowed down at the same time the unemployment rate declined to a near 50-year-low....", "authors": ["Steve Goldstein", "European Markets Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS684_retail_ZG_20191004110245.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
