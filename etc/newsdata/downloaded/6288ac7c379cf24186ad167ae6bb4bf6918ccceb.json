We worked with urgency to remove this content and will permanently suspend any accounts found to be posting or reposting content of this abhorrent act,\" it said.\n\nThe company said the account that live-streamed the attack had been created two months before the incident. It had only attempted to live-stream once before.\n\nTwitch said it had shared a \"hash\" of the video with a group of tech companies including Microsoft and Facebook.\n\nA video hash is essentially a \"fingerprint\" of a video that helps platforms detect if the same footage has been uploaded on their service.\n\nArtificial intelligence\n\nIn March, an attack on a New Zealand mosque in which 51 people were killed was live-streamed on Facebook.\n\nThe social network was criticised for failing to prevent copies of videos of the Christchurch mosque shootings from being shared on its platform.\n\nFacebook has since discussed plans to train algorithms to recognise videos of shootings so they can be detected and removed more quickly.\n\nIt plans to use footage from police body cameras, captured during training exercises, to teach its systems to detect videos of real-life shootings.\n\n\"We are far from solving this issue,\" said Christopher Tegho, a machine learning engineer at the video analytics firm Calipsa.\n\n\"Understanding a whole scene is a more difficult and complicated task.\n\n\"One of the issues is getting enough data to understand shooting scenes. That is why Facebook is asking police to collect this data, it's the first step.\"", "description": "Twitch says a gunman's video was watched by more than 2,200 people before it was removed.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1661D/production/_109177619_gettyimages-1146666435.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
