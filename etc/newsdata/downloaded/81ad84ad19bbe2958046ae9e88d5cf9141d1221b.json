Andrew Yang\u2019s campaign promises that he\u2019ll do something that\u2019s never been seen before at tomorrow\u2019s Democratic debate. Thankfully, this will be a one-night-only affair. The downside is that its three-hours of left-wing extremism. Sadly, Marianne Williamson couldn\u2019t muster ICBMs of love to get into the debate. Still, Yang\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t offer any details. So, what could it be? Will he be crowd surfing onto the stage? He\u2019s done that before (via The Hill):\n\n\"Haven\u2019t crowdsurfed in a while #YangGang,\" the entrepreneur tweeted. The video came from the AAPI Democratic Presidential Forum in Costa Mesa, Calif., where Yang and his fellow 2020 candidates Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) and Tom Steyer spoke on Sunday. Despite his lack of political experience, Yang has accumulated significant support for his 2020 presidential bid, currently coming in at 2.7 percent support in a RealClearPolitics average of polls, ahead of seasoned politicians like Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.).\n\nAndrew Yang\u2019s campaign manager just called to tell me that at tomorrow night\u2019s debate, Yang will be doing \"something no presidential candidate has ever done before in history.\u201d He declined to go further than that. \u2014 Sam Stein (@samstein) September 11, 2019\n\nWe\u2019ll just have to find out tomorrow.\n\nMy take: Ten things to watch in tomorrow's debate...\n\n\n\n1.
