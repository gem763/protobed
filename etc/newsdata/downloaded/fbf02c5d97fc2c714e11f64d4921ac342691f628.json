He could not say more than that it is a \u201csavage and beautiful novel, and it speaks to us today, all around the world, with particular conviction and power\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe bar is set particularly high for Atwood and she soars over it,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t wait for everyone to read it.\u201d\n\nThis is the sixth Booker nomination for the Canadian author, who won the \u2019 prize in 2000 for The Blind Assassin. She is set to face off against another former winner, Salman Rushdie, who is nominated for Quichotte, a retelling of Cervantes\u2019 Don Quixote set in today\u2019s US. Rushdie\u2019s 14th novel has not gone down well with critics; the Observer felt it was \u201crarely as funny as Rushdie thinks it is\u201d, while the New York Times said his books were \u201cincreasingly wobbly, bloated and mannered\u201d.\n\nJudge and editor Liz Calder, who published Rushdie\u2019s 1981 Booker winner, Midnight\u2019s Children, denied there had been any bias at play and said they had not worked together for decades. \u201cIt is barely even a friendship,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was once.\u201d\n\nFlorence said: \u201cIf you are going to make a tilt at one of the greatest works of literature, you better hope you can play at Cervantes\u2019 level,\u201d adding that Rushdie\u2019s novel is \u201ca hell of a ride\u201d.\n\nThe giant underdog of the shortlist is Lucy Ellmann\u2019s Ducks, Newburyport, published by tiny, Norwich independent Galley Beggar Press. A 1,000-page monologue of an angst-ridden homemaker in Ohio, the British-American author\u2019s book unfolds in a single sentence and spans love, climate change, gun violence and the condition of the US. Judge and composer Joanna MacGregor called the book an example of \u201cradical literary form and voice\u201d and, despite its hefty size, praised it for flowing \u201cwith dazzling light and speed\u201d.\n\nBritish novelist Bernardine Evaristo is nominated for Girl, Woman, Other. Following 12 characters, most of them black British women, the novel sees some stories overlapping to make connections between disparate humans. Judge and author Xiaolu Guo called it \u201cimpressive and fierce \u2026 there is never a single moment of dullness\u201d.\n\nNigerian novelist Chigozie Obioma makes the shortlist for An Orchestra of Minorities. Narrated by a chi, a guardian spirit in Igbo myth, the novel follows Nonso, an ambitious Nigerian graduate who becomes trapped in Cyprus after falling for an education scam. Judge and journalist Afua Hirsch called it \u201ca crucial journey into a heartache that is both mythical and real\u201d.\n\nTurkish novelist Elif Shafak is nominated for 10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World, described by Calder as \u201caudacious and dazzlingly original\u201d. Set in Istanbul, the novel portrays in the final moments of a murdered sex worker\u2019s life as her brain slowly shuts down.\n\nFlorence said he had previously felt that Booker judges had said \u201cdeeply daft things about the need for cracking stories and relatable characters and stylistic adventure\u201d in fiction.\n\n\u201cNow find I agree with absolutely everything they\u2019ve said,\u201d he said. \u201cIs it too much to want a book to be adventurous, to be formally inventive, to have an emotional and intellectual core that grips you and sends you to new places, and deep into yourself, to understand how the world might be? I don\u2019t think it is.\u201d\n\nFour of the six shortlisted books are published by imprints of the giant conglomerate Penguin Random House. Prize rules stipulate that imprints that have never been longlisted can only submit one book a year, while previously nominated publishers can submit up to five. Florence denied that PRH\u2019s dominance suggested the rules needed reworking: \u201cGiven their bidding power, and the range, scale and quality of their editorial talent, maybe this is a great year for PRH but two or three books should be their minimum target grade.\n\n\u201cI would be more than happy to announce any of these six as the winner and feel we had got something spectacular and wonderful that would convince someone who read one book a year as well as [literary critic] Gillian Beer,\u201d he said.\n\nThe winner, who takes home \u00a350,000, will be announced on 14 October at a ceremony in London.\n\nThe 2019 Booker prize shortlist\n\nThe Testaments by Margaret Atwood (Vintage, Chatto & Windus)\n\nDucks, Newburyport by Lucy Ellmann (Galley Beggar Press)\n\nGirl, Woman, Other by Bernardine Evaristo (Hamish Hamilton)\n\nAn Orchestra of Minorities by Chigozie Obioma (Little, Brown)\n\nQuichotte by Salman Rushdie (Jonathan Cape)\n\n10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World by Elif Shafak (Viking)", "description": "The Testaments, still under wraps before publication next Tuesday, joins final six alongside Salman Rushdie\u2019s latest and a 1,000-page monologue", "authors": ["Sian Cain"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6479d0a66c842c7dce4cfc50dad5734f2807bff3/4_386_6708_4026/master/6708.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2fa79a862f25f2aba5f72a3163843c5f"}
