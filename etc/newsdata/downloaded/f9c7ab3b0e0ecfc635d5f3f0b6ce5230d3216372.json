Since starting real trials with the exoskeleton, he has been able to walk more than 100 meters in total.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about turning man into machine, but about responding to a medical problem,\u201d Alim-Louis Benabid, co-author of a new study on the exoskeleton published in the Lancet Neurology journal, told Reuters.\n\nWe\u2019re talking about \u2018repaired man,\u2019 not \u2018augmented man.\u2019\n\nThe technology, while impressive, is still a long way from everyday use, however. Tom Shakespeare, professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said a \u201cproof of concept is a long way from usable clinical possibility,\u201d and warned of the dangers of \u201chype.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlso on rt.com Exoskeleton hand lets quadriplegics manipulate objects with power of their mind (VIDEO)\n\nNevertheless, Thibault remains optimistic about the new technology\u2019s potential, which he said sends a \u201cmessage of hope to people like me,\u201d adding \u201cThis is possible, even with our handicap.\u201d\n\nI can\u2019t go home tomorrow in my exoskeleton, but I\u2019ve got to a point where I can walk.\n\nLike this story?
