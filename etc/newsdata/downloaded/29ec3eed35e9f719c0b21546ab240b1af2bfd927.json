And we talk. And whatever the accent, the same adjectives tumble out. Sensational. Unbelievable. Special. The thing that marks him out, Tony Bellew says, is just how easy he makes it look against quality fighters. Jeff Powell, who has covered boxing for the Daily Mail for nearly 50 years, reckons Lomachenko is the best technician he has ever seen. And Bob Arum, still loudly and proudly banging the promoter\u2019s drum with his 88th birthday looming, insists the Ukrainian belongs in the pantheon, alongside Muhammad Ali, Marvin Hagler, Sugar Ray Leonard, Floyd Mayweather, Oscar De La Hoya and Manny Pacquiao.\n\nBut when Lomachenko speaks to us, long past the witching hour, he does not want to engage. \u201cI don\u2019t want people to ask me if I think I am a great,\u201d he says, his words laden with understandable fatigue. \u201cThat is down to other people to talk about and decide. My opinion doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nVasiliy Lomachenko: \u2018Max was a very good person. But it\u2019s the life we all live as fighters\u2019 Read more\n\nThis is a refreshing development for modern boxing, where even a six-round club fighter could teach Dale Carnegie a thing or two about salesmanship. But at the O 2 Arena on Saturday 18,000 souls respectfully \u2013 and rightfully \u2013 disagreed with him. Few things unite Britain during these times of turbulence and strife, Brexit and Boris, proroguing and roguing. But whether it was from the posh seats or the bleachers the same cries could be repeatedly heard. \u201cLoma! Loma!\u201d and \u201cLoma\u2011Chenko! Loma-Chenko\u201d. It was an acknowledgment of sporting genius.\n\nPowell, who has followed the sport since the day he was smuggled into Earl\u2019s Court by his father to see Randolph Turpin defeat Sugar Ray Robinson, said he had never seen anything like it in a British ring. But it was impossible not to marvel at how Lomachenko defused the mines laid by Luke Campbell, who entered the ring with a large reach and height advantage and looked like a giant in comparison. It was how sport should be: the crowd hailing Lomachenko one minute and roaring on Campbell the next; wanting to purr at a masterclass while simultaneously craving a miracle.\n\nTrue, it was not Lomachenko\u2019s best performance. He said so himself. Probably a seven out of 10, he reckoned, although he would have to rewatch it to be sure. Yet he had still dominated one of the world\u2019s finest lightweights by 11 rounds to one on two of the judges\u2019 cards and by 10-2 on the other. That felt a touch harsh on Campbell, who put up a ferocious effort, but not by much.\n\nFrom ringside it was especially notable how calm Lomachenko remained under fire, as well as the way he would shift his feet or head so that his opponent\u2019s jab would frequently whistle past his ear or fall short. In his infancy as a boxer Lomachenko also learned Ukrainian dance, did gymnastics and played basketball, football and tennis, which he believes has enhanced his footwork. Watching the fighter known as \u201cthe Matrix\u201d \u2013 so called because of the way he seems to bend time and space to his will in the ring \u2013 it was impossible to argue.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Lomachenko lands a left on Luke Campbell.

According to Compubox, which tracks every punch in major bouts, he is typically hit with around one in six punches thrown at him. Against Campbell, who landed 131 of 420 shots, it was closer to one in three. Yet the Ukrainian sucked it up and replied with interest. Tellingly in the seventh, when he looked winded by a beautiful body shot and the crowd scented an upset, he responded with a series of malevolent combinations that sent Campbell tumbling backwards.\n\nEddie Hearn calls for VAR in British boxing after fight result is reversed Read more\n\nWhat is more, Lomachenko is not a natural 9st 9lb lightweight \u2013 even though he will surely add the IBF world title to his WBA, WBC and WBO belts in 2020. Really he is a featherweight or superfeatherweight, who would be even better at 9st or 9st 4lb. Yet still he marches deeper into greatness. How far could he go? Well, you don\u2019t amass a 396-1 amateur record with two Olympic gold medals \u2013 and then become the fastest fighter to win world titles in three weight classes as a professional \u2013 without being special.\n\nAnd special he is. Compubox uses a simple metric \u2013 plus/minus \u2013 to evaluate a fighter. Essentially it is the percentage of successful punches landed take away the percentage of times that same boxer is hit. It is the sport\u2019s most basic instruction \u2013 hit and not get hit - blended into an algorithm. According to Compubox numbers, Lomachenko\u2019s plus/minus rating is 18.9%, the highest among current fighters, with Terrence Crawford second on 14%.\n\nThat, incidentally, is the best since Floyd Mayweather. But while Mayweather was undoubtedly brilliant, his genius was lopsided towards defence and he often did just enough. Lomachenko, by contrast, is just as good on the front foot as back. And he seeks to thrill as well as win.\n\nSign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n\nArum believes he will only enhance his legacy by going on a world tour just like Ali during the 60s and by jumping between featherweight, super featherweight and lightweight. \u201cHe is a man who will also fight simultaneously in three weight divisions like Henry Armstong did,\u201d he hollered. \u201cThat\u2019s our dream for Loma.\u201d And after another sensational display, who would dare bet against it coming true?", "description": "The Ukrainian boxer Vasiliy Lomachenko has won world titles at three different weights and is being mentioned in the same breath as Muhammad Ali, Marvin Hagler and Floyd Mayweather", "authors": ["Sean Ingle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfbad9630eb8f575c8e60d8fbe4206fa19e9e276/0_87_2254_1352/master/2254.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=2ace7384a6c9ba8a5cc42d5ce6851e52"}
