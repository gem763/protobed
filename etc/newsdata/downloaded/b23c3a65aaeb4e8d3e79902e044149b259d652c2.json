Ms. Huffman almost repeated the scheme with her younger daughter, but ultimately didn\u2019t pursue the plan, according to court documents.\n\nProsecutors have asked that Ms. Huffman be imprisoned for one month, then given one year of supervised release and fined $20,000, arguing that she defrauded the SAT creator and administrator, the College Board and Educational Testing Service, and sought to defraud colleges by having her daughter submit the bogus scores.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What is an appropriate sentence for Felicity Huffman? Join the conversation below.\n\nProsecutors said probation or home confinement wouldn\u2019t be a meaningful punishment for a woman who lives in a large Hollywood Hills house with an infinity pool, and a fine at the high end of guidelines \u201cwould amount to little more than a rounding error\u201d for a woman of her means.\n\nMs. Huffman\u2019s legal team has asked the judge to sentence her to one year of probation, 250 hours of community service and a $20,000 fine, saying her conduct was out of character and she was repentant.\n\nProsecutors have identified the testing agencies and colleges as victims in the sprawling case, but the federal probation office has so far determined no victim suffered any financial loss. In that interpretation, each defendant would under the federal sentencing guidelines face the same zero-to-six-month prison term regardless of the size of payments to Mr. Singer. Judges often reduce that time to probation for white-collar defendants without prior records.\n\nProsecutors argue that when victims\u2019 losses can\u2019t be clearly broken down by defendant, the sentencing guidelines allow the amount gained by the perpetrator\u2014in this case, the conspiracy led by Mr. Singer\u2014to serve as a proxy. They are asking for prison time based on the payments and bribes, requesting that defendants who shelled out larger sums face much longer sentences.\n\nThe judge is expected to make a determination soon over which sentencing guidelines should frame the penalty phase.\n\n\u201cHer efforts weren\u2019t driven by need or desperation, but by a sense of entitlement, or at least moral cluelessness, facilitated by wealth and insularity,\u201d prosecutors said of Ms. Huffman in a court filing last week.\n\nMs. Huffman painted a different picture of her motivations. She hired Mr. Singer on the recommendation of a friend, she said in a letter to U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani, and used his legitimate tutoring for her older daughter for nearly a year before beginning discussions about the fraud. She did so after Mr. Singer painted a bleak picture of the girl\u2019s chances at performing-arts schools, saying even a stellar audition couldn\u2019t cancel out a poor test score.\n\n\u201cI felt an urgency which built to a sense of panic that there was this huge obstacle in the way that needed to be fixed for my daughter\u2019s sake,\u201d she said in the letter. \u201cAs warped as this sounds now, I honestly began to feel that maybe I would be a bad mother if I didn\u2019t do what Mr. Singer was suggesting.\u201d\n\nIn interviews with The Wall Street Journal, several former clients and families who considered hiring Mr. Singer described him as a person who preyed on their anxieties, dismissing the teens\u2019 strengths and convincing parents they needed his help to gain admission to top schools.\n\nMr. Singer pleaded guilty to four felonies: racketeering conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy, conspiracy to defraud the U.S. and obstruction of justice.\n\nThough prosecutors say a number of parents lied to get their children diagnosed with learning disabilities, using a clinician recommended by Mr. Singer to secure extra time on their college-entrance exams, both of Ms. Huffman\u2019s daughters were diagnosed years earlier with such issues. The older one has attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and the younger one has dyslexia.\n\nIn recommending a sentence at the low end of the zero-to-six-month range laid out in her plea agreement, prosecutors acknowledged Ms. Huffman\u2019s \u201cnearly immediate acceptance of responsibility.\u201d\n\nWrite to Melissa Korn at melissa.korn@wsj.com", "description": "Actress Felicity Huffman is slated to be sentenced Friday afternoon for her role in the college-admissions cheating scheme, kicking off the penalty portion for the 15 parents who have pleaded guilty.", "authors": ["Melissa Korn", "Melissa.Korn Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106604/social", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
