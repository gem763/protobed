She is a professor of financial economics at the University of Bonn and has been an economic adviser to Merkel\u2019s administration since 2014. If approved by European Union leaders, she\u2019ll take the seat vacated by Sabine Lautenschlaeger, who announced her surprise resignation last month.\n\nFinance Minister Olaf Scholz described the 48-year-old as an \u201coutstanding economist\u201d who will work well for the euro zone and for Germany. Schnabel said on Twitter that she is honored to be proposed and will do her best to meet the \u201chigh expectations\u201d of her in the eight-year term.\n\nGerman officials have a poor track record of finishing their stints on the ECB\u2019s six-member board, which proposes and implements policy. Lautenschlaeger, a former Bundesbank vice president, will leave on Oct. 31, more than two years early. Her predecessor Joerg Asmussen, a former deputy finance minister, served only 24 months. Before him, Juergen Stark, another ex-Bundesbank vice president, quit after less than five years.\n\nSchnabel would also be joining the ECB just as pressure mounts on governments including Germany to add fiscal stimulus to accompany the institution\u2019s monetary support. Questioned on the need for a budget boost in her country in May -- before more evidence of a deteriorating economy had emerged -- she seemed unconvinced at the time.\n\n\u201cFiscal policy at the moment is relatively loose, so I wouldn\u2019t worry about this too much,\u201d she said on Bloomberg Television. \u201cThe German economy is doing still relatively well, so we are not approaching a recession.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019ll be one of two women on the six-member board, including incoming President Christine Lagarde. There are also no women currently in the rest of the Governing Council, which totals 25 officials including the board and national central bank governors.\n\nThe lack of gender balance at the top of the ECB has long been an embarrassment to the institution. The European Parliament delayed the ratification of Executive Board member Yves Mersch in 2012 as part of an effort to cajole euro-zone governments into fixing the matter.", "description": "Merkel Shifts ECB Tactics With Schnabel Pick for Board Seat", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic79925de46c05c777c2589c4a84729a01.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
