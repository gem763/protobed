The Supreme Court is expected to announce a verdict in the 134-year-old title suit before the Chief Justice leaves office on November 17.\n\nThe dispute has run over several decades between Hindus and Muslims.

Thus the Babri Masjid got its name.\n\nDon't Miss 10.9 K SHARES 14.8 K SHARES 10.2 K SHARES 4 K SHARES 2.9 K SHARES\n\nHere is a timeline of events:\n\n1528: Mughal emperor Babur constructs a mosque and it is named Babri\n\n1853: The first recorded incident of violence over the holy site takes place during the reign of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah of Awadh.
