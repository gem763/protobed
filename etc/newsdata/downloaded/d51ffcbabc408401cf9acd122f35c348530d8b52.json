These five flavours of cupcakes will be available to buy this Friday, October 11, at all six London branches of the Hummingbird Bakery. What's more, 150 of the cupcakes are being given away on a first come, first served basis, so get your butt down to London if you're mad enough to give these a whirl. It's limited to one per person, but I can't imagine anyone going back for a second helping.\n\nThe bakery teased the collaboration today on its Facebook, Instagram and Twitter accounts, but the big tomato emoji gave it away. Well, that and the press release.\n\nIf you miss out on the freebies, you can still indulge in these mini monstrosities for \u00a33.25 ($6) a pop if you want to take them away to nibble on in the privacy of your home. If, however, you have no qualms about projectile vomiting in public, you can pay \u00a33.90 ($7) for a cupcake and eat in.\n\nSalad cream sounds like the worse one in that lineup of flavours because the sauce itself is an abomination!
