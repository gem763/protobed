The share of Americans who describe themselves as conservative has declined by nearly 20 percent since 1992, while the portion who identify as liberal has increased by nearly 50 percent.\n\nWhat's the reason for this decline in the conservative population? It's certainly not due to a lack of conservative think tanks and advocacy groups. There are hundreds of conservative state and national organizations across the country. These have helped achieve numerous conservative public policy reforms over the years, but they have evidently failed at growing the conservative ranks.\n\nWhile conservatives are leading in the battle of ideas, they have all but surrendered the culture war. Academia, entertainment and high- and low-culture are completely dominated by liberals. Conservatives must enter the cultural fray if they're going to expand their base.\n\nBARRONELLE STUTZMAN: YOUR RELIGIOUS LIBERTY IS IN DANGER IF I LOSE MINE IN A SAME-SEX WEDDING COURT CASE\n\nEntertainment taps into people\u2019s emotions, reaching a deeper level of the brain than rational appeals that usually don\u2019t penetrate the frontal cortex. We've all had that feeling of understanding something intellectually but not emotionally. Until someone laughs out loud, wells up with tears, or feels heartbreak or a frisson from a public policy white paper, entertainment appeals will always have more impact.\n\nWhen it comes to Hollywood, which is my domain as a filmmaker and actress, the story is more nuanced. Sure, movies push the latest PC claptrap, universally depict shrewd businessmen as bogeymen, and treat conservative characters as dweebs or worse. But the fundamental and time-honored Hollywood themes remain essentially conservative.\n\nEven movies that ostensibly espouse liberal values are usually undergirded with conservative concepts, because audiences still root for good values and right over wrong.\n\nSuch common themes include using ingenuity to overcome obstacles to achieve dreams; taking responsibility for actions that have consequences; and the importance of character over situation. Until there's a summer blockbuster where characters laze around performing self-destructive behaviors without consequence or a motivation to better their circumstances, the Hollywood product will never be truly liberal.\n\nEven movies that ostensibly espouse liberal values are usually undergirded with conservative concepts, because audiences still root for good values and right over wrong.\n\nOther inherently conservative Hollywood themes include the importance of family; the glorification of the American Dream; and rewards for hard work and sacrifice. Masculinity, freedom and a willingness to fight in self-defense are also almost universally glorified. Even the common Hollywood critiques of capitalism \u2013 warnings against consumerism, corporatism, cronyism \u2013 are ones with which most conservatives would agree. Imagine the cultural influence if conservatives seized this opportunity by creating and promoting conservative storylines to match these universal themes.\n\nI will make this case to conservatives at the annual State Policy Network conservative think tank confab in Colorado Springs this month. I will ask attendees to focus a little more on entertainment and a little less on Excel spreadsheets.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nWhat does this look like in practice? At the most basic level, this simply means conservative think tanks supporting the conservative offerings that come out of Hollywood by highlighting them to their audiences in blog posts, newsletters and op-eds. Who doesn't like a good movie recommendation?\n\nMore ambitious think tanks should offer a film festival like The Steamboat Institute does every summer in Colorado to highlight the latest and greatest in conservative cinema.\n\nUltimately, conservatives must build up their creative content. This doesn't mean starting with a full-length feature. But it does mean expanding video departments and providing them with the decision rights to pursue their creative visions. In addition to tapping into their followers' emotions, these organizations will expand their audience to demographics that traditionally don't care about public policy.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThere's a market for such conservative content. My husband Kevin Sorbo, well-known from \u201cHercules\u201d and \u201cGod\u2019s Not Dead,\u201d and I have recently produced the conservative film \u201cLet There Be Light,\u201d and his career spans several other conservative offerings like \u201cWhat If\" that have clearly tapped into latent demand. Our newest film, \u201cMiracle in East Texas,\" due out next spring, tells the true story of the world\u2019s biggest oil strike, highlighting entrepreneurship, conservative values and freedom as themes.\n\nBy supporting such conservative films and engaging in the culture wars, conservatives can reverse their dwindling population. It's time for conservatives to trade their green eyeshades for purple eyeglasses.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY SAM SORBO", "description": "Until someone laughs out loud or wells up with tears from a public policy white paper, entertainment appeals will always have more impact.", "authors": ["Sam Sorbo", "Sam Sorbo Is Talk Radio Host", "The Author Of"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2017/10/28/694940094001_5628259692001_5628246740001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
