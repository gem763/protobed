The remains of one worker has been removed from the building but the bodies of the other two are still inside.\n\nNew Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell has said removing those is the next priority after the cranes go down.\n\nThe streets around the building had been cleared in order to make things as safe as possible\n\nThe crane slammed down to the ground but the second of the two cranes remains standing\n\nThe cranes - one around 270 feet high, the other about 300 feet - weigh thousands of tons.\n\nThey had been tilting dangerously, and officials had feared the towers would come down on their own, possibly smashing into nearby buildings or severely damaging underground gas and electric lines.\n\nExperts, including engineers who worked on demolitions following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, were called in to try to come up with a plan to clear the site and prevent further injury and damage before the cranes fell on their own.\n\nOn Thursday, officials announced plans to bring down the structures in a controlled demolition.\n\nAfter the dust cleared, the second crane could be seen hanging over the building\n\nOne of two large cranes from the Hard Rock Hotel construction collapse is seen hanging over the edge above Canal Street in this aerial photo, after being detonated for implosion\n\nTwo large cranes from the Hard Rock Hotel construction collapse are seen in this aerial photo\n\nOther surrounding buildings don't appear to have suffered too much damage in the collapse\n\nWorkers suspended in a small bucket attached small explosives to various locations on the two cranes, with the goal of causing a series of explosions that would weaken the cranes in key locations and cause them to collapse.\n\nThe explosions were planned for Friday, but the demolition was pushed back to Saturday, then Sunday.\n\nOfficials expanded an evacuation zone in the leadup to the detonation, and in an even wider area, vehicles were prohibited and people were told to stay indoors until the demolition was complete.\n\nThe crane landed on Rampart Street in New Orleans. it will now have to be cut up and removed\n\nWorkers prepare two unstable cranes for implosion at the collapse site of the Hard Rock Hotel, which underwent a partial, major collapse while under construction last Saturday\n\nA ship floats on the Mississippi River by the Hard Rock Hotel construction site in New Orleans\n\nOfficials also called on people to stay out of the area and watch the demolition on television instead of coming down to watch in person.\n\nPolice had cleared the area ahead of the explosions, and then sounded a series of alarms that could be heard across the neighborhood before the controlled explosions were carried out.\n\nThe cause of the collapse remains unknown. The Occupational Health and Safety Administration is investigating and, Cantrell and Fire Chief Tim McConnell said, evidence gathering began soon after the collapse.\n\nLawsuits are already being filed on behalf of some of the more than 20 people injured against the project's owners and contractors.\n\nNew Orleans officials set off several explosions Sunday intended to topple two cranes that had been looming over the ruins of a partially collapsed hotel\n\nOfficials told people to watch the explosions on TV rather than stand outside to view", "description": "NEW ORLEANS (AP) - Officials set off thundering explosions that toppled two cranes Sunday that had loomed precariously for days over a partially collapsed...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/00/19969696-0-image-a-34_1571613341637.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
