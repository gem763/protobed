According to fragmented notes scribbled in his journals, Vega believed these paintings were the key to opening a doorway to another world.\"\n\nGuests start their evening on the first floor, where they have the chance to meet ghosts, magicians and musicians as well as play with a giant Ouija board.\n\n\u201cThe best way you can interact with House of Spirits is to actually engage and talk with the characters and with the ghosts and the spirits that exist in the house,\u201d according to creative director Justin Meyer, who came up with the concept.\n\n\u201cThe more you talk to them, the more story you get from them, the more you'll understand the backstory of the entire house \u2026 how all the characters are interconnected, how all the rooms, the different levels of the house, are all interconnected in different ways.\u201d\n\nGuests also receive a tarot card upon arrival, which serves as a drink ticket throughout the night as they venture room to room and floor to floor.\n\nThe upstairs is more engaging as well as frightening as guests play a game with monsters and creatures, while the basement may be the most intense section of the house, Meyer said, with its two experiences that \"are not for the faint of heart.\"\n\nThis is the first year of House of Spirits, which runs through Nov. 2.", "description": "A Los Angeles mansion was transformed into a haunted house for Halloween, featuring spooky cocktails along with ghouls, ghosts and games.
