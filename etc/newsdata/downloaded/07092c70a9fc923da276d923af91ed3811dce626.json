Calamity Came Fast.", "language": "en", "text": "Syrian refugee children play under posters depicting President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey at a camp on the outskirts of Kahramanmaras in southeastern Turkey on Aug. 31, 2019. (Mauricio Lima/The New York Times)\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s acquiescence to Turkey\u2019s move to send troops deep inside Syrian territory has in only one week\u2019s time turned into a bloody carnage, forced the abandonment of a successful five-year-long American project to keep the peace on a volatile border and given an unanticipated victory to four U.S. adversaries: Russia, Iran, the Syrian government and the Islamic State group.\n\nRarely has a presidential decision resulted so immediately in what his own party leaders have described as disastrous consequences for U.S. allies and interests. How this decision happened \u2014 springing from an \u201coff-script moment\u201d with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, in the words of a senior U.S. diplomat \u2014 likely will be debated for years by historians, Middle East experts and conspiracy theorists.\n\nBut this much already is clear: Trump ignored months of warnings from his advisers about what calamities likely would ensue if he followed his instincts to pull back from Syria and abandon America\u2019s longtime allies, the Kurds. He had no Plan B, other than to leave. The only surprise is how swiftly it all collapsed around the president and his depleted, inexperienced foreign policy team.\n\nDay after day, they have been caught off-guard, offering up differing explanations of what Trump said to Erdogan, how the United States and its allies might respond, and even whether Turkey remains a U.S. ally. For a while, Trump said he acted because the Islamic State group was already defeated and because he was committed to terminating \u201cendless wars\u201d by pulling U.S. troops out of the Middle East. By the end of the week he added 2,000 \u2014 to Saudi Arabia.\n\nOne day he was inviting Erdogan to visit the White House; the next he was threatening to \u201ctotally destroy and obliterate\u201d Turkey\u2019s economy if it crossed a line that he never defined.\n\nErdogan just kept going.\n\nTrump\u2019s error, some aides concede in off-the-record conversations, was entering the Oct. 6 call underprepared and then failing to spell out for Erdogan the potential consequences \u2014 from economic sanctions to a diminution of Turkey\u2019s alliance with the United States and its standing in NATO. He has since threatened both, retroactively. But it is not clear Erdogan believes either is a real risk.\n\nThe drama is nowhere near over. Out of necessity, the Kurds switched sides Sunday, turning their backs on Washington and signing up with President Bashar Assad of Syria, a man the United States has called a war criminal for gassing his own people. At the Pentagon, officials struggled with the right response if Turkish forces \u2014 NATO allies \u2014 again opened fire on any of the 1,000 or so Americans now preparing to retreat from their positions inside Syria. Those troops are trapped for now, since Turkey has cut off the roads; removing them may require an airlift.\n\nAnd over the weekend, State and Energy Department officials were quietly reviewing plans for evacuating roughly 50 tactical nuclear weapons that the United States had long stored, under U.S. control, at Incirlik Air Base in Turkey, about 250 miles from the Syrian border, according to two U.S. officials.\n\nThose weapons, one senior official said, were now essentially Erdogan\u2019s hostages. To fly them out of Incirlik would be to mark the de facto end of the Turkish-American alliance. To keep them there, though, is to perpetuate a nuclear vulnerability that should have been eliminated years ago.\n\n\u201cI think this is a first \u2014 a country with U.S. nuclear weapons stationed in it literally firing artillery at US forces,\u201d Jeffrey Lewis of the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies wrote last week.\n\nFor his part, Erdogan claims nuclear ambitions of his own: Only a month ago, speaking to supporters, he said he \u201ccannot accept\u201d rules that keep Turkey from possessing nuclear weapons of its own.\n\n\u201cThere is no developed nation in the world that doesn\u2019t have them,\u201d he said. (In fact, most do not.)\n\n\u201cThis president keeps blindsiding our military and diplomatic leaders and partners with impulsive moves like this that benefit Russia and authoritarian regimes,\u201d said Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., a longtime member of the Armed Services Committee.\n\n\u201cIf this president were serious about ending wars and winning peace, he\u2019d actually articulate a strategy that would protect against a re-emergence of ISIS and provide for the safety of our Syrian partners,\u201d Reed added. \u201cBut he has repeatedly failed to do that. Instead, this is another example of Donald Trump creating chaos, undermining U.S. interests and benefiting Russia and the Assad regime.\u201d", "description": "President Donald Trump's acquiescence to Turkey's move to send troops deep inside Syrian territory has in only one week's time turned into a bloody carnage, forced the abandonment of a successful five-year-long American project to keep the peace on a volatile border and given an unanticipated", "authors": ["David E.
