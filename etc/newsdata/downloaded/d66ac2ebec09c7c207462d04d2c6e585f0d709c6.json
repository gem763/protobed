Varadkar has said achieving a deal will be \u201cextremely difficult\u201d. Johnson\u2019s stance appears more positive: the prime minister tweeted to say he was \u201cstill cautiously, cautiously optimistic\u201d.\n\nThe reality is that there is a yawning gulf between the British government\u2019s position, and that of Ireland and the EU. Talks in Brussels all but broke down this week amid a bout of acrimony.\n\nThe Irish prime minister has since told parliament in Dublin his government has \u201cgrave difficulty\u201d with the UK\u2019s plan to pull Northern Ireland out of the EU\u2019s customs union without the consent of its people \u2013 a majority of whom opposed Brexit in the 2016 referendum.\n\nRead more: Why is Boris Johnson's latest Brexit plan a headache for the EU?\n\nUnder Boris Johnson\u2019s plan for a revised divorce deal, the \u201cbackstop\u201d \u2013 which would keep the UK in a customs union with the EU \u2013 would be scrapped. Instead, the whole of the UK \u2013 including Northern Ireland \u2013 would leave.\n\nDublin and the EU27 oppose customs checks anywhere on the island of Ireland. They say the UK\u2019s proposals for an automated system are unproven and cannot provide a cast-iron guarantee for an open border in the same way as the backstop.\n\nThe British want the EU to compromise over customs, arguing that they have given ground in accepting that Northern Ireland would remain under single market rules for goods and agri-food products.\n\nBut Dublin, with EU backing, opposes the UK\u2019s plan whereby the arrangement would be subject to approval every four years from Northern Ireland\u2019s elected authorities. Many among the business and farming communities in the North have also castigated Johnson\u2019s plan as unworkable and damaging.\n\nHopes are not high that the meeting between Johnson and Varadkar will bring a meeting of minds. It comes a week before a European Council summit when any deal would need to be signed off by EU27 leaders.\n\nThe British government continues to insist the UK will leave the EU on October 31. The British parliament \u2013 which has passed a law designed to force another delay in the absence of a deal \u2013 will hold an emergency session on October 19, its first Saturday sitting since 1982.\n\nRead more:\n\nBrexit countdown: blame game erupts amid day of acrimony\n\nIreland unveils \u20ac1.2 billion fund to counter impact of no-deal Brexit\n\nBrexit Guide: Where are we now?\n\n", "description": "The UK and Irish leaders meet on Thursday with few expectations of a breakthrough over a Brexit deal.", "authors": ["Alasdair Sandford"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/22/15/72/1000x563_cmsv2_99510730-09f0-542f-8036-9dd32b9d6ddc-4221572.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
