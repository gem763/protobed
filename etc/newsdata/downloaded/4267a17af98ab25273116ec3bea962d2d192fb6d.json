REUTERS/Benoit Tessier\n\nFrench junior economy minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher\n\nsaid on Tuesday the government had done all it could to prepare.\n\nBut, she told Reuters, French measures including a \u201csmart\u201d Channel border allowing trucks and others transporters to complete customs checks in advance would only go so far to help businesses if they were not ready.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve put in place a fast-track border, we\u2019ve tested it, it works,\u201d Pannier-Runacher said. \u201cBut in a truck all of the goods have to have been pre-cleared. If something being carried by a company didn\u2019t tick that box, it\u2019s going to have to stop and that will be a pain.\u201d\n\nCompanies across Europe - many of which go through France by road to reach the United Kingdom - have been rushing to prepare paperwork ahead of Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union.\n\nUncertainty over whether it will leave without a deal on Oct. 31 has exacerbated concerns over traffic pile-ups and delays at the border, which could be particularly painful for those dealing in groceries or other perishable goods.\n\nIn Britain, ferry hub Dover has said it is as ready as can be, though the port\u2019s chief executive told Reuters there were uncertainties over the extent to which freigh operators were ready for new declarations on the French side.\n\nBritish government no-deal planning documents from August, known as Operation Yellowhammer, said 50-85% of lorries might not be ready for French customs.\n\nPannier-Runacher said that within France, companies that were the most exposed to trading with the United Kingdom were largely ready and had taken other steps such as stockpiling goods.\n\nBut the government had also stepped up pressure on firms to check they were well prepared, she said.\n\n\u201cA company boss can\u2019t just sit there, arms crossed, saying \u2018I don\u2019t understand, I can\u2019t cross the border\u2019,\u201d Pannier-Runacher said.\n\nFrance had hired extra customs agents - beefing up staff in areas where more rigorous checks are needed for health reasons, such as food - and told ambassadors across Europe to whip companies into action, she added.\n\n\u201cThe French state has gone to considerable pains to ensure things will go as well as possible,\u201d Pannier-Runacher said.", "description": "France has warned companies bringing goods in and out of Britain through its border after Brexit that they are responsible for making sure their paperwork is in order.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441150075&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E1BZ", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
