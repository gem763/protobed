She fell in love with the property and persuaded Corrigan to sell it to her, promising it would make a superb hotel.\n\nThere\u2019s a wealth of art and antiques throughout, as you might expect, but the ch\u00e2teau is a place to relax, too.\n\nWhat makes the ch\u00e2teau so special is that it was shaped by the ideas of the Enlightenment, when good design was a big deal. In 1760, Louise Pineau de Viennay\u2019s father, Baron de Luc\u00e9, invited architect Mathieu de Bayeux to design a ch\u00e2teau using the most modern ideas. The house was built from limestone on a north-south axis, inspired by neoclassical symmetry \u2013 but the baron never got to live there. The story goes he went to see the finished house and dropped dead in the forecourt \u2013 whether from excitement or disappointment, nobody knows.\n\nThe opulent Baron's suite was designed for Baron de Luc\u00e9. Michael Spengler\n\nI think about the far-sighted baron as I wander through his quarters, which are usually open to guests to look through unless someone has booked the entire Baron\u2019s Suite for \u20ac15,000 ($24,450) a night. In the Salon Chinois, I admire the murals that have miraculously survived the centuries. The scenes of an imaginary Orient were painted on canvas-covered walls by Jean-Baptiste Pillement, whose work is also found in Marie-Antoinette\u2019s garden palace at Versailles.\n\nThere\u2019s a wealth of art and antiques throughout, as you might expect, but the ch\u00e2teau is a place to relax, too. The pink dining room is very Wes Anderson-ish \u2013 think of his 2014 film, The Grand Budapest Hotel \u2013 while the grand salon is light and airy. An old church has been turned into a bar, while the ornate dining room is used for events or special occasions \u2013 guests eat on the terrace or in the restaurant.\n\nThe centuries-old murals in the Salon Chinois in the Baron's Suite. Michael Spengler\n\n\u201cNo matter how many times I go through the rooms, every day I see something new,\u201d enthuses Lourine, a hotel assistant.\n\nThe hotel has been open for just a few weeks and we are the only guests, which only enhances the feeling of living a dream. Dinner is served on the terrace as the rays of the setting sun highlight the sculpted gardens, which are inspired by those at Versailles.\n\nThank goodness manners have relaxed somewhat since the 18th century \u2013 the service is friendly. The food is seriously good (thanks to chef Maxime Thomas) and the wine-matched dinner is a highlight. I particularly enjoy the extra little dishes which sneak in between courses \u2013 this is the land of amuse-bouche, after all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 4000 square-metre ch\u00e2teau is in its own little kingdom, surrounded by 30 hectares of classical gardens and statues (a gift from King Louis XV), the remains of an ancient white oak forest, a kitchen garden and a pretty pond. We borrow electric bikes and enjoy a picnic in the grounds before immersing ourselves in the pool. A fountain in a previous life, the pool provides welcome relief from the heat.\n\nThe hotel's swimming pool is perfect for whiling away a lazy afternoon. Adam Lynk\n\nI spend an afternoon poolside in the shade of umbrellas, a book in one hand and a cocktail in the other. The nearby spa, housed in a former laundry, isn\u2019t up and running yet and the surrounding buildings \u2013 an old stables and orangery \u2013 are still being restored.\n\nThe Corner King Suite Garden View is one of the most private guest rooms in the ch\u00e2teau. Micael Spengler\n\nMost of the ch\u00e2teau\u2019s guest rooms are on the first floor and each is different. Although Timothy Corrigan did the major restoration work, Paul and Shannon Wehsener of Paul Allen Design have reworked the interiors with a lighter touch.\n\nI\u2019m staying in the Corner King Suite, which is flooded with light and overlooks the forecourt, with a glimpse of village rooftops beyond and expansive views of the western garden. The room is grand, with a 4.5-metre high ceiling, huge casement windows, original oak parquetry floors, antique furniture, plush fabrics, Pratesi bedlinen and soothing green toile wallpaper (there is no TV in the room but the Wi-Fi is good). The bathroom is generous, with a separate marble shower and a claw-foot bath near the window, looking onto shimmering greenery outside.\n\nLavish attention to detail abounds, as in the King Suite Village View. Michael Spengler\n\nSadly, all good fantasies must come to an end. On our last day, we learn that a family of five are on the way, followed by the hotel\u2019s owner, Marcy Holthus, and a party of US politicians.\n\nOur stay is drawing to a close, but the ch\u00e2teau is ready and waiting to fulfil the dreams of its next visitors.\n\nNEED TO KNOW\n\nHotel Ch\u00e2teau du Grand-Luc\u00e9 9 Place de la R\u00e9publique, Le Grand-Luc\u00e9.
