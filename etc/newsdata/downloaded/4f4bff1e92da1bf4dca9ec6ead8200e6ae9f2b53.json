Lloyd, who had just purchased the car the same day, July 20, initially pulled over at a highway rest stop in Cornwall, then sped away from the police cruiser, which was equipped with a dashcam.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nVideo captured the blue hatchback crossing lines, weaving in and out of traffic and quickly accelerating to over 100 mph on the 60 mph road. After nine miles, however, the Subaru\u2019s engine gave out and smoke billowed from its exhaust as Lloyd came to a stop and the cruiser crashed into his car to keep him from escaping again.\n\nIn court, the prosecuting attorney said that \"the police were surprised the Subaru could go that fast, and in fact its engine blew up.\u201d\n\nLloyd admitted he was driving dangerously and operating a vehicle without insurance or a license.\n\n\"There were dozens and dozens of vehicles coming towards you,\" Judge Timothy Rose told Lloyd. \"One slight hiccup with the steering wheel would have caused a collision with possible multiple fatalities.\"\n\nIn addition to the jail sentence, Lloyd also received a three-year driving ban.", "description": "Perhaps he should study the rules of the road a little harder next time.", "authors": ["Gary Gastelu", "Gary Gastelu Is Foxnews.Com'S Automotive Editor.
