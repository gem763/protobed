Do you think a foreign player would like to come and play in Bulgaria after what happened tonight? Racism is a world problem that needs to be eradicated. We\u2019re all people regardless of the skin colour.\u201d\n\n(Image: Internet Unknown)\n\nHowever, Bulgaria manager Krasimir Balakov and goalkeeper Plamen Iliev were less forthcoming in their criticism of the abuse.\n\n\u201cIf I am honest, I believe they [the fans] behaved well today,\u201d said Iliev, who plays his club football for Ludogorets.\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t any abuse [as far as I could hear] and I think they [the England players] overreacted a bit.\n\n\"The public was on a good level \u2013 I didn\u2019t hear any bad language used towards their or our players.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cI personally did not hear the chanting,\" added Balakov, whose words have been criticised by England's Raheem Sterling and Trent Alexander-Arnold .\n\n\"I saw the referee stopped the game but I also have to say the behaviour was also not only on behalf of the Bulgarian fans but also the English fans, who were whistling and shouting during the Bulgarian national anthem.\n\n\"During the second half they used words against our fans which I find unacceptable.\u201d", "description": "The Euro 2020 qualifier in Sofia was twice halted on Monday night as abuse could be heard from the stands", "authors": ["Mark Jones", "Image", "Getty Images", "Internet Unknown"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20581066.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Bulgaria-v-England-UEFA-Euro-2020-Qualifier.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
