You have to decide what kind of pillow you\u2019re looking for \u2014 memory foam, plush, gusseted, high-loft, contour \u2014 and then you can find some of the best options right on Amazon. These pillows all have extremely high ratings from thousands of reviews, so when you get your new pillow, you can trust a good night\u2019s sleep is not far behind.\n\nCoop Home Goods Premium Adjustable Loft Pillow, $60: With over 17,000 reviews and a 4.3-star rating, it\u2019s hard to argue anything bad about this pillow. It\u2019s made with hypoallergenic, cross-cut memory foam that is fully customizable. That means you can take as much out or put as much in as you want to get just the right loft. It even comes with an extra bag of stuffing for those that want a little more \u201coomph\u201d\u2014as the brand calls it.\n\nBeckham Hotel Collection Gel Pillow, $35: Memory foam isn\u2019t for everyone.
