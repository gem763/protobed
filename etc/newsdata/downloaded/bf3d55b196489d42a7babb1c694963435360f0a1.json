Incredible things like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t meant to be insulting, for them it was just normal. They loved my film-making and the stories, but eventually they would say: \u2018Sorry it\u2019s too black. Our marketing department cannot sell it.\u2019\u201d\n\nPalcy is regarded in a similar light to Julie Dash, the director of the 1992 Sundance festival hit Daughters of the Dust, as a black female film-maker who has been overlooked. The Barbican\u2019s season is called Hidden Figures and focuses on \u201cgreat directors who deserve greater recognition in the UK\u201d.\n\nPalcy said she decided to focus on writing screenplays and helping to develop young film-makers, rather than making films herself, when she realised Hollywood wanted \u201cdiluted versions\u201d of her ideas that required white characters to secure financing.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Palcy on set in 1989.

I say no, I would have hated myself and I would have been miserable. I may be crazy, but I can\u2019t change how I am.\u201d\n\nPalcy said she had three \u201cspiritual mentors\u201d who helped her develop as a film-maker: Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire, the Martinique poet and founder of the n\u00e9gritude movement, supported her when she came to Paris in her 20s; Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, the French New Wave director, encouraged her to make Sugar Cane Alley after reading her screenplay; and Robert Redford acted as an advisor to the young director after seeing her first film and championed her in the US. \u201cRobert Redford saw Sugar Cane Alley and he loved it,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was like a godfather to me \u2013 any problems I just had to call him.\u201d\n\nThe director said the recent OscarsSoWhite movement and Time\u2019s Up were both positive steps to addressing the issues that stymied her Hollywood career. \u201cThese are values that I stood by for many years. It\u2019s taken time, too much time. But it is happening slowly,\u201d she said.\n\nPalcy said the achievements of Ava DuVernay and Shonda Rhimes, who has a multimillion-dollar deal with Netflix for projects with diverse casts, shows the progress that had been made. \u201cFor many years I felt like I was by myself talking about these issues of racism and sexism in film.
