The man had been accused of gambling, an offense under sharia law in the Indonesian region of Aceh\n\nOne man, who looks to be in his early fifties, stands, hands clasped with his gaze fixed resolutely in front of him, as a member of the Sharia Police hits him firmly in the back.\n\nThe other, who appears to be around the same age looks to the ground as the caner dressed in a hooded red garment his him several times.\n\nThe only sign of pain the man gives is a soft grimace each time the cane hits his clothed back.\n\nThis man, who is also identified, can be seen with a grimace on his face as a member of the Sharia police stands and whips him several times.\n\nA member of the Sharia police can be seen standing ahead of the public caning in Banda Aceh on October 21, 2019\n\nThere are few other details surrounding the circumstances that led to the whipping of these two men.\n\nBut such displays are relatively common in the conservative region of Sumatra island.\n\nUnder Sharia law, people are often caned for a range of offences, including gambling, having a homosexual relationship, sale and consumption of alcohol, and sex outside of marriage - despite much international criticism.\n\nThe Islamic penal code, which stems from interpretations of the Koran, Islam's religious text, is widely used in the Aceh region as its principal legal code - the only one in Indonesia to do so.\n\nThe province of Banda Aceh began widespread implementation of Sharia law after being granted autonomy in 2001 \u2013 in an attempt by the government in Jakarta to quell a long-running separatist insurgency.\n\nThis gained strength in 2005 when to quell a three-decade-old separatist movement the region was granted the right to use sharia law as its legal code - on the condition it remained a part of the world's most populous Muslim-majority country.\n\nUsman Hamid, the executive director of Amnesty Indonesia, told Al Jazeera, while Sharia law formed the region's criminal code how it was implemented could be considered a breach in humanitarian law.\n\n'In actuality, the many provisions of the law [are] a breach of international human rights law and standards.'\n\nHe said caning in public was in violation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment to which Indonesia is a state party.\n\nHe said the caning was more than just a light tap on the back - and could be quite severe.\n\nDespite international condemnation public flogging is a common punishment for a range of offences in the conservative region\n\nEarlier this year, there were concerns such public punishments would become more widespread, as Indonesia looked set to pass a new law that could have seen Sharia Law more widely implemented across the nation's many regions.\n\nThe law, if passed, would also have seen sex outside of marriage, abortion and insults on the president's dignity outlawed.\n\nThose who engaged in extramarital sex faced punishment of up to one year in jail, under the proposed law changes.\n\nThe shift came amidst a recent trend towards deeper religious piety and conservative Islamic activism in the South-East Asian nation.\n\nHowever, after a public and global outcry, he Indonesian President Joko Widodo called for a further review of the bill before it was passed into law.\n\nThe man can be seen with head downcast as a member of the Sharia police whips his clothed back firmly", "description": "Under Sharia law, people in Indonesia's Aceh province are often caned for a range of offences including gambling, pre-marital sex and selling and drinking alcohol.", "authors": ["Corazon Miller For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/08/19979792-0-image-a-2_1571643014850.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
