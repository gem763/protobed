In our story, Aurora is basically moving out, which is something all parents dread, and that\u2019s exactly how Maleficent feels.\u201d\n\nRonning also promises a visual spectacle that will follow up on the last film, which was widely praised for its visuals.\n\nVisual effects supervisor Greg Brozenich, who worked with Ronning on Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, had his hands full with the massive scope of the story and sheer number of magical creatures, which were entirely computer generated. The film has a grand total of 2,168 visual effect shots.\n\nVideo of Official Trailer: Disney's Maleficent: Mistress of Evil - In Theaters October 18!\n\nAccording to Brozenich, most of the film\u2019s special effects efforts went towards creating the battle sequences that take place in and around Castle Ulstead, as well as the secret weapon created by the film\u2019s villain, Queen Ingrith.\n\nHer creation, a mix of fairy dust and iron which turns into a red, powder-like substance able to cause mass destruction, is brilliantly realised on screen.\n\nWhen visualising the film, Ronning pictured the bombs exploding over Berlin during the second world war.\n\n\u201cThose were the images in my head,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s what I was trying to create.\u201d\n\nBrad Pitt goes on a quest for meaning in sci-fi Ad Astra\n\nGiven that the first film earned an Oscar nomination for Best Costume Design, there were high expectations on the production team for the sequel. Costume designer Ellen Mirojnick led a team that included cutters, dyers, textile artists, prop designers, jewellery creators and buyers, who created distinct looks for each of the three main characters, Maleficent (Angelina Jolie), Aurora (Elle Fanning) and Queen Ingrith (Michelle Pfeiffer).\n\nAs the strongest character in the film, Maleficent needed to stand out from the others, with her own unique silhouette. \u201cMaleficent is iconic,\u201d Mirojnick explains. \u201cSo you have to be able to continue that idea and raise the stakes a bit. She is the black and white movie star of the fairy tale world, and that\u2019s the image we started with. Her skin is very white, her lips are red and her body is totally silhouetted in a very strong shape.\u201d\n\nAurora\u2019s wardrobe is ethereal with a touch of sophistication, perfectly suited for someone who reigns over mystical creatures.\n\nMary Shelley movie review: Frankenstein author biopic starring Elle Fanning is an excellent story of sorrow and strength\n\n\u201cI knew as Queen of the Moors it was essential that she begin her journey in a blue dress, with an organic fairy tale design made in the forest. The result looks like hand-tied leaves made by fairies,\u201d says Mirojnick. \u201cWe needed it to look totally different from her formal courtly dresses.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, Queen Ingrith\u2019s look is regal, and suggests an air of wealth and privilege.\n\n\u201cWe used platinum, gold and champagne colours coupled with a lot of jewellery to really bling her up and make a bold statement,\u201d Mirojnick says. \u201cHer colours do not give any hint of her being evil; in fact, it\u2019s quite the contrary.\u201d", "description": "This visually spectacular fantasy, with a human story at its core, returns in dramatic style", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/a707eeb0-efd6-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e39imagehires132219.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
