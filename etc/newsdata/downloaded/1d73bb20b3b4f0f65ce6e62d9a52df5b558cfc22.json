Janmark broke up the left wing and fired a shot that bled through Binnington. Blues forward Jaden Schwartz tried to swipe the loose puck to safety, but he inadvertently scored into his own net instead.\n\nHeiskanen gave the Stars 2-1 second-period lead by beating Binnington over his left shoulder from a tough angle along the goal line.\n\nThe Stars appeared to take a 3-1 lead on an Esa Lindell power-play goal 2:16 into the third period, but the Blues successfully challenged the goal. The video review determined that Dallas was offside on its offensive zone entry.\n\nThe Blues tied the game 2-2 when Schenn fired a shot that hit Bishop in the arm, popped up over him and rolled over the goal line. Stars forward Radek Faksa reached in behind Bishop but failed to keep the puck out of the net.\n\nThe winning goal was lucky. Blues defenseman Carl Gunnarsson flipped the puck into traffic, and it deflected off the back of Blais' leg and past Bishop.\n\nThe Stars played without defenseman Roman Polak (broken sternum) and forwards Jason Dickinson (upper body) and Blake Comeau (lower body). All three were injured in the season opener.\n\nTaylor Fedun replaced Polak on defense, and forwards Rhett Gardner and Nick Caamano played their first NHL game after moving up from the AHL's Texas Stars.\n\nWith forward Robby Thomas sidelined with an upper-body injury for St. Louis, Zach Sanford stepped into the lineup on the third line with Tyler Bozak and Robby Fabbri.\n\n--Field Level Media", "description": "Brayden Schenn and Sammy Blais scored third-period goals as the St. Louis  Blues rallied past the visiting Dallas Stars 3-2 Saturday night.David Perron also...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
