I have done everything I can to improve this naturally but there has been no improvement. It is that severe I just cant fix this myself.\n\n\"I really need Jayden to have a helmet fitted that can help reshape his head again, but this isn't funded on the NHS. I really just want the best for my little boy and I'm just so worried how this will impact him in the future.\n\n\"I don't want him to be bullied or feel self conscious about the way his head looks when a helmet could give him a better shaped head.\n\n\"It usually takes a few months to see improvements but may take longer for Jayden due to his age as the best results with a helmet is between four to six months.\n\n\"With Jayden being seven-months-old, I need to raise funds quickly as it will be more effective the earlier on it's done. I will never forgive myself if I don't at least try to get him the treatment he needs.\n\n\"I'd be so grateful for any donation.\"\n\nWithin 48 hours of setting up the GoFundMe page , well-wishers have donated more than \u00a3300.", "description": "Cheri Millett's baby Jayden has severe positional plagiocephaly and she is running out of time to help him", "authors": ["Kelly Ashmore", "Kelly-Ann Mills"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20758719.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_MQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
