More than half of those accounts are in the U.S., he said.\n\nThe network, which also included a lone Facebook account, was among several the company said it removed this week for engaging in coordinated inauthentic behavior on both its namesake social networking service and Instagram, the popular photo- and video-sharing app it acquired in 2012.\n\nFacebook previously found evidence of its platforms being abused by IRA during the 2016 presidential and 2018 midterm elections, and the company has responded by repeatedly imposing new measures meant to prevent playing host to similar misconduct.\n\nExperts have warned recently that Facebook remains vulnerable ahead of 2020, however, and Instagram maybe more than ever. A report published last month by the New York University\u2019s Stern Center for Business and Human Rights warned that Instagram\u2019s focus on images rather than words makes it an \u201cideal venue\u201d for spreading easy-to-digest disinformation, weeks after Facebook\u2019s former head of security raised similar concerns.\n\n\u201cThe fact that Instagram is mostly images give some benefit, but not a ton,\u201d Alex Stamos, Facebook\u2019s former chief of security, said in August. \u201cAs you know, the Russian troll factories have professional meme farms. Like they have graphic designers using Illustrator all day to create memes. So, \u2018Is Instagram ready?\u2019 is actually a big question.\u201d\n\nFacebook has previously tied the IRA to social media accounts that boosted disinformation and other politically charged content to U.S. audiences during the 2016 and 2018 elections, including widely reported efforts during the former to disparage the campaign of former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. More recently, Facebook said it removed dozens of related Instagram accounts on the eve of last year\u2019s midterm elections.\n\nThe Justice Department has filed federal criminal charges against the IRA, its parent company and several associations, among others, in connection with its alleged conduct during the 2016 election. Lawyers for the parent company, Concord Management and Consulting, have pleaded not guilty to all counts.\n\nElena Khusyaynova, an accountant for the IRA, was separately charged in October 2018 in connection with allegedly attempting to similarly interfere in last year\u2019s elections. She was arrested in Bulgaria this month at the request of U.S. authorities but released shortly afterward.\n\nFacebook said it removed a total of four networks Monday for engaging in coordinated inauthentic behavior. The other three originated in Iran and were also conducted on both Facebook as well as Instagram, according to the company.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
