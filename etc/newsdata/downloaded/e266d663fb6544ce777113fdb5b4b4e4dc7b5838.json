Before the cap, the average deduction claimed in California, for example, was $22,000, according to Kevin de Leon, a Democratic member of the California state senate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a result, wealthier taxpayers have left these states for no-income tax destinations like Florida. While Florida received more movers than any other state last year, New York's outflows to the Sunshine State were the highest \u2013 63,772 people.\n\nNew York had the third-largest outflows of any state, with 452,580 people moving out within the past year. California, another high-tax state, had the largest outflow of domestic residents \u2013 with the highest proportion of people headed to Texas, Arizona and Washington.\n\nExodus just beginning\n\nExperts told FOX Business the exodus is just beginning \u2013 and will accelerate as people become increasingly frustrated by heightened tax liabilities.\n\nAccording to data provided to FOX Business by Geoffrey Weinstein, special counsel in the Tax, Trusts & Estates Department of Cole Schotz, an individual or couple earning $650,000 in ordinary income could save $69,719 per year by moving from New York to Florida.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo credited the SALT cap and the flight of the wealthy for a $2.3 billion budget deficit in the state \u2013 calling the fiscal situation in the state \u201cas serious as a heart attack.\u201d\n\nSome states, including New York, had devised ways to circumvent the cap \u2013 the most popular of which was officially squashed by the Treasury Department in June.\n\nNew York, New Jersey and Connecticut have filed a lawsuit challenging that ruling.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nFOX Business' Blake Burman contributed to this article.", "description": "The measure has resulted in an exodus from high-tax states like New York and California.", "authors": ["Brittany De Lea"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/08/0/0/AP19233597173858.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
