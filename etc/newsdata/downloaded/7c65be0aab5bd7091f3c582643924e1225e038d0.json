Back in April 2018 an unnamed county representative at the meeting where the ECB\u2019s plans were first announced described it to the Evening Standard as being \u201clike something out of W1A\u201d. This March a county executive told the Independent, on the subject of ongoing discussions about team names: \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s like something out of W1A at times.\u201d In April a county executive told the Sunday Times that at one meeting, \u201cI thought I\u2019d walked onto the set of W1A\u201d. This all suggests two things: that a single county executive with a particular fondness for excruciating BBC comedies has repeatedly said similar things to different journalists under the cover of anonymity; and that, whether the quotes come from one individual or several, the process of creating the competition has at times been painfully cringeworthy, marked in particular \u2013 as was the TV series \u2013 by the adoption of befuddling marketspeak.\n\nFast forward to last week\u2019s announcement of the \u201cbrand identities\u201d of the eight participating teams, which featured Rob Calder, the tournament\u2019s commercial director, awkwardly ad-libbing in an east London warehouse while assistants desperately attempted to coax some action from a video that was refusing to play. There seems little doubt what our mysterious county executive would have to say about that particular scene.\n\nStokes Supercharged and Woakes plays ball as the Hundred takes flight Read more\n\nThe ECB has certainly put plenty of effort \u2013 and a lavish budget of \u00a3180m over five years \u2013 into the tournament\u2019s creation, so much so that in England\u2019s major urban areas there can\u2019t be many groups left unfocused. The Evening Standard wrote that \u201cthe ECB are building the eight new team identities based on exhaustive research of their target market\u201d, which include shirt sponsors chosen \u2013 according to the Telegraph \u2013 to \u201chelp the Hundred reach younger urban audiences\u201d and a pared-down two-game knockout round designed \u2013 according to the Times \u2013 around \u201cconcerns about whether a long [finals] day would appeal to their target market of families and young people\u201d. \u201cThe Hundred,\u201d says the ECB\u2019s chief executive, Tom Harrison, \u201cis going to be positioned as family entertainment.\u201d As if we couldn\u2019t tell.\n\nThe ECB has come to resemble the desperate schoolteacher who imagines his students will be suddenly enthralled by Shakespeare if they are told to consider him a lyricist and read his sonnets over a hip-hop beat. In its case, it is convinced that cricket\u2019s fortunes will be transformed when the players are finally free to wear truly garish colours and the logo of a popular prawn cocktail-flavoured snack. When Virat Kohli announced last year that he would be playing no part in the competition, he used one phrase that for many rang particularly true: \u201cI feel somewhere the commercial aspect is taking over the real quality of cricket and that hurts me.\u201d\n\nIt was into this environment that the ECB launched the eight teams last week. A less charitable observer would decry their continued attempts at \u201cpositioning\u201d, but in many endeavours \u2013 we\u2019ll leave Brexit out of this if you don\u2019t mind \u2013 there comes a point where even if you consider something misguided, you must grudgingly admire the belief of those who continue to pursue it with absolute conviction. Because far from attempting to mollify the naysayers, the ECB\u2019s snook-cockers turned the irritating market-speak dial to 11, added some loud colours, shouty fonts and an advertising deal with precisely the kind of company for whom the type of people already criticising them would be guaranteed to further criticise them, and sat back to enjoy the pyrotechnics.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kenzie Benali talks to Danni Wyatt of Southern Brave.

It is, to be sure, difficult to pithily describe the make-up of teams that haven\u2019t yet been made up, but even so this was quite the achievement.\n\nManchester Originals are \u201ccelebrating a global city of firsts\u201d and \u201claughing in the face of limits\u201d. Birmingham Phoenix are \u201ca celebration of the strength in diversity, because different is good\u201d. Northern Superchargers are \u201cpowered by positivity and people who get stuff done\u201d. Southern Brave are \u201cendlessly curious, with an insatiable appetite for adventure\u201d. Trent Rockets will launch \u201cthe biggest party in the country\u201d exclusively for those \u201cwho don\u2019t mind having the most fun\u201d. Welsh Fire are \u201cburning bright with intense passion and relentless energy\u201d with \u2013 and this phrase might have felt particularly meaningful for whoever penned it \u2013 a \u201chunger to prove the haters wrong\u201d.\n\nAli Martin (@Cricket_Ali) Who are The Hundred teams? What do they stand for? The official website has the answers... https://t.co/wSrhwFxutX\n\nGiven the opportunity to change people\u2019s perceptions the ECB, which had been repeatedly criticised for using ludicrous marketing-drivel during private meetings, had used even more ludicrous marketing-drivel in public. These tactics seemed extraordinary, but then a few hours after the ECB\u2019s press conference wound down a different one took place on a different continent in which a president under fire for making objectionable requests of Ukraine in private decided that the best way to beat off that allegation would be to also and more publicly make the same requests of China. The ECB continues to be criticised for its approach in creating the Hundred, but at least it knows President Trump would be fan.\n\nIt is clear that no amount of parody or protest will change its path now. The ECB has been burrowing itself into a Hundred-shaped hole, and instead of seeking a way out it ordered up a digger. Perhaps it\u2019s time to give up on the grinching, before it gets its hands on some dynamite.\n\nThe Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\n\n\u2022 This is an extract taken from the Spin, the Guardian\u2019s weekly cricket email.
