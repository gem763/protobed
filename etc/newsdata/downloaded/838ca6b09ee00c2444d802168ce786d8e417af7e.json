That is not what we thought we\u2019d be like in the 20s, but this is the millennial life and old-age issues like backache are attacking us quicker than they did in the previous generations. Here\u2019s the catch \u2013 the whining and the constant backache is not age-related and a serious lifestyle anomaly that we need to fix right away!\n\nWe need to understand what is causing our body to have a mid-life crisis unlike any other and here\u2019s what we discovered:\n\nThe smart lifestyle is not so smart for our body\n\nPexels\n\nHunching over our smartphones all day long has led to serious neck and back issues. Constantly staring down at your phones puts pressure on your neck and shoulders which causes the muscles around your neck and back to tighten. The increasingly common syndrome plaguing the millennials is being termed as \u201ctech neck\u201d and is leaving 20-year-olds with the spine health of a 30 or 40-year-old.\n\nThis is true for most of our smart devices whether it\u2019s a laptop, smartwatch or a gaming screen \u2013 we spend countless hours each day hunched, lost in the world of likes, social validity and entertainment.\n\nSpending long hours at a desk\n\nPexels\n\nMost of us have the 9-5 work-life that involves us sitting on our desk getting the work done. And for us taking a break often means logging on to Facebook or watching a video on YouTube. What we don\u2019t realize is that our body needs to stretch and our muscles need to relax. A bad sitting posture can leave us with a stiff back. Hence, regular stretching breaks are a must!\n\nWorking out incorrectly\n\nPexels\n\nMost millennials (including me) are hit by the fitness bug. We head straight for weight training without strengthening our core muscles. Often, using heavy weights at the gym could do more harm to your body than good. And that\u2019s exactly why we first need to strengthen our muscles with stretches and workouts like yoga. Always ensure that your weight training is supervised by a professional.\n\nSleeping on an uncomfortable mattress\n\nPexels\n\nYour bedding makes the world of a difference when it comes to your backache. Sleeping on a wrong mattress can worsen your problems. Make sure that your mattress is neither too hard nor too soft; it needs to be the right balance of comfortable to keep your back muscles relaxed.\n\nWith the increasing number of young millennials suffering from back issues, mattress companies are now focusing on finding a suitable solution. Recently, Duroflex launched an orthopedic mattress range called Duropedic that is tested and certified by renowned orthopedics, and is India\u2019s only certified orthopaedic mattress. Tested and Certified by National Health Academy.\n\nDuroflex\n\nAfter an 8-month testing period, the advanced orthopedic mattress with an exclusive 5-zoned full zone support system was launched in the market. Our Human body is divided into 5 zones and each of these zones requires differentiated support based on the weight exerted. This means that the mattress one sleep on should ideally be able to provide differentiated support for pressure dissemination of each of these zones for the most optimum and restorative back support. The 5- Zoned Full Prone Support System in the Duropedic Range of Mattresses can provide this advanced support our backs need.\n\nDuroflex\n\nWith backaches becoming a mainstream lifestyle problem, this orthopedic range of mattress helps us restore our spinal alignment and strengthen our back.\n\nIf you are suffering from backache, correct your posture, take a regular break from your smart devices, exercise daily and flip your mattress for a better one.", "description": "Have you started sounding like an old man, always whining about his back issues?
