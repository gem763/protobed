REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/File Photo\n\nAccording to Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, the University of California at Berkeley economists who developed that estimate, that\u2019s in part because the wealthiest American families declare only a small portion of their actual economic gains in any given year as income, while leaving the rest invested in stocks and other assets, to grow in value.\n\nSaez, 48, has been involved in a series of what are considered groundbreaking studies of U.S. income, inequality and economic mobility that involved both developing techniques to impute income based on holdings of wealth, and extensive access to U.S. Internal Revenue records.\n\nHe and Zucman, 32, have collaborated on several papers on the topic since 2014, and recently published \u201cThe Triumph of Injustice: How the Rich Dodge Taxes How to Make Them Pay.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe greatest injustice of the US tax system today is its regressivity at the very top: billionaires in the top 400 pay less (relative to their true economic incomes) than the middle class,\u201d the economists wrote in a September paper.\n\nTheir work might have been little more than a provocative read on the economics circuit, had the idea of a wealth tax not been picked up by the two progressive politicians now vying with former vice president Joe Biden for first place in the Democratic Party\u2019s nominating contest for the November 2020 presidential election.\n\nNot only are Vermont senator Bernie Sanders and former Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s wealth tax proposals remarkably similar, both proposals have been vetted by Saez & Zucman.\n\nTaxing wealth, not income, became a hot-button topic during the Democratic debate in Ohio on Oct. 15, with several of the other 10 candidates on the stage rejecting it as too radical.\n\nEntrepreneur Andrew Yang said that implementing such a tax would be impractical. Former U.S. Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke called it \u201cpunitive.\u201d Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota senator, said \u201cwhen I look at this, I think about Donald Trump,\u201d suggesting that it would be so unpopular it could help the Republican president\u2019s re-election.\n\nWarren and Sanders, however, have pitched it as a solution to the U.S.\u2019s social and economic woes.\n\nWARREN vs. SANDERS\n\nThe two politicians have slightly different proposals, but the aim is the same -to rebalance the distribution of wealth in the U.S. to fund the social programs like free college tuition that they\u2019re promising voters.\n\nWarren would apply a 2% tax on every dollar of net worth for households worth $50 million or more, and a 3% tax on every dollar of net worth beyond $1 billion.\n\nAccording to tables in a recent paper by Saez and Zucman, this would apply to around $11 trillion of holdings this year, producing revenue of at least $220 billion.\n\nSanders\u2019 \u201cextreme wealth tax\u201d would tax households with a net worth above $32 million at 1%, meaning a household with $32.5 million would pay a tax of $5,000. That tax would rise in increments, to 2% on net worth from $50 million to $250 million all the way up to 8% on wealth above $10 billion.\n\nSanders\u2019 campaign estimated the plan, which would tax just the top 0.1% of U.S. households, would raise an estimated $4.35 trillion over the next decade.\n\nMAKE THE RICH PAY MORE\n\nSaez and Zucman say their research points to the wealth tax as an effective way to equalize the amount of tax paid by people with massive fortunes like investor Warren Buffett and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos with the middle-class, and then seed the proceeds through the economy.\n\nHad the Warren proposal been in place since 1982, the share of wealth held by the top 400 would still have risen - but only to 2%. A higher tax rate of 10% on holdings above $1 billion, meanwhile, would have kept that group\u2019s share of national wealth stable.\n\nIn more individual terms, the 3% rate on holdings above a billion would mean Bezos would be worth just $86 billion this year, versus $160 billion. At the bottom of the top 15, casino mogul Sheldon Adelson would have $18 billion, versus $35 billion.\n\nA dozen European nations used to have wealth taxes but most have done away with them. France, one of the last, abolished its wealth tax in late 2017, after thousands of millionaires relocated to neighboring, lower-tax countries.\n\nSaez and Zucman argue that Europe\u2019s history with wealth taxes is not relevant to the United States because those countries set their wealth tax bar too low, and because it\u2019s easier to relocate within the continent for favorable tax laws.\n\nThe U.S. tax system, on the other hand, essentially taxes all citizens, no matter where they live.", "description": "From 1982 to 2018 the share of U.S. wealth held by the 400 richest Americans is estimated to have grown from 1% to around 3.5%, or probably around $3 trillion.", "authors": ["Howard Schneider", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441847427&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G0XU", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
