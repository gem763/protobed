Weinstein then sent him a bottle of Grey Goose vodka.\n\nStaffers at NBC News greeted the cascade of revelations with sadness, anger, frustration and disgust.\n\n\u201cI honestly want to throw up,\u201d said one NBC News employee who, like others quoted in this story, asked for anonymity out of concern for possible retaliation for criticizing the news division\u2019s leadership.\n\nAnother network staffer said NBC\u2019s reputation \u201ctook a serious hit\u201d from the day\u2019s events. \u201cThe initial response was as good as could've been expected,\u201d they said. \u201cIt'll take more to recover, though.\u201d\n\nNevils\u2019 account of being sexually assaulted in Lauer\u2019s hotel room at the Sochi Winter Olympics in 2014\u2014\u201cIt was nonconsensual in that I said, multiple times, that I didn\u2019t want to have anal sex,\u201d she told Farrow\u2014left some employees feeling network bigwigs whitewashed the seriousness of the accusations when they fired their morning star in 2017.\n\n\u201cWomen are furious and feel Noah lied to them when he said \u2018no assault,\u2019\u201d a network insider told The Daily Beast. \u201cNoah and Andy knew all of this [about Lauer] and lied about it.\u201d\n\nA veteran employee angrily remarked: \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be hearing about this [anal rape allegations] from Variety. We should have heard it from the bosses. I hope that there are pitchforks outside the executive offices.\u201d\n\nFarrow\u2019s book doesn\u2019t hit stores until Oct. 15, but the bits that have dribbled out portray Lack and Oppenheim as capitulating to an aggressive campaign by Weinstein to quash Farrow\u2019s reporting. Farrow claims Weinstein even used as-yet-unreported accusations against Lauer as a bargaining chip with the network.\n\nThe book also says that when allegations against Lauer did ultimately become public in the wake of the Weinstein-fueled #MeToo movement, Nevils was appalled to learn that Lack and Oppenheim were emphasizing it was not \u201can assault\u201d or \u201ccriminal.\u201d\n\nAfter Nevils\u2019 on-the-record allegation broke Wednesday morning, Lack issued a statement that said: \u201cMatt Lauer\u2019s conduct in 2014 was appalling and reprehensible\u2014and of course we said so at the time.\u201d\n\nBut at the time, NBC News actually used far more neutral terminology, referring to \u201cinappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace\u201d that was \u201ca clear violation of our company\u2019s standards.\u201d\n\nIn a memo to the newsroom later on Wednesday, Lack claimed the network wasn\u2019t covering up a rape claim, saying: \u201cWe chose those words [\u201csexual misconduct\u201d] carefully to precisely mirror the public words at that time of the attorney representing our former NBC colleague.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny suggestion that we knew prior to that evening or tried to cover up any aspect of Lauer\u2019s conduct is absolutely false and offensive,\u201d Lack wrote in response to Farrow\u2019s assertions.\n\nHe said the NBCUniversal legal department \u201cuncovered no claims or settlements associated with allegations of inappropriate conduct by Lauer before he was fired.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly following his termination did NBCU reach agreements with two women who had come forward for the very first time, and those women have always been free to share their stories about Lauer with anyone they choose,\u201d he continued.\n\nLack also personally attacked Farrow for his account of NBC\u2019s handling of the Weinstein story. Farrow left the network in August 2017 after NBC refused to air the investigation that he and his reporting partner, McHugh, worked on for months; Farrow later published his reporting in the New Yorker, and won the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service\u2014an honor he shared with the New York Times for its own Weinstein reporting.\n\n\u201cIt disappoints me to say that even with passage of time, Farrow\u2019s account has become neither more accurate, nor more respectful of the dedicated colleagues he worked with here at NBC News,\u201d Lack wrote in the memo. \u201cHe uses a variety of tactics to paint a fundamentally untrue picture.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere are the essential and indisputable facts: NBC News assigned the Harvey Weinstein story to Ronan, we completely supported it over many months with resources\u2014both financial and editorial. After seven months, without one victim or witness on the record, he simply didn\u2019t have a story that met our standard for broadcast nor that of any major news organization.\u201d\n\nA representative for Farrow fired back: \u201cThe claims by NBC\u2019s senior management about Ronan Farrow\u2019s reporting are simply not true, as his book will methodically demonstrate. In fact, relevant sections of the book confirm not only how many [Weinstein accusers] were named, but also how much proof Ronan had gathered. Importantly, it documents the lengths to which NBC executives went to thwart the reporting efforts of Ronan and his producer Rich McHugh and why they did so. That is why it is called Catch and Kill, out on October 15.\"\n\nAfter Lauer was fired in November 2017 and the The New York Times and the New Yorker published their Weinstein stories, NBC News opted to conduct its own internal study of its actions\u2014instead of hiring independent outside investigators\u2014and cleared top NBC News executives of all wrongdoing and mistakes.\n\nNetwork higher-ups have been privately concerned about Farrow\u2019s book for months, fearing it could reopen years-old wounds within the network over the company\u2019s handling of the Weinstein investigation and the Lauer accusations.\n\nThe excerpts happened to come out on Yom Kippur, the Jewish holy day, when several key NBC News executives, including Lack and Oppenheim, were out of the office. On a morning network-wide call, staffers were told they could expect the memo from Lack that came later in the day.\n\nDuring a regular morning meeting between MSNBC President Phil Griffin and the executive producers of all the cable network\u2019s programming, Griffin brought up the Farrow revelations, described the allegations as serious, and essentially said that MSNBC would be covering the story like any other, with each show making its own determination about how to handle it.\n\nThe network\u2019s evening news show addressed it head-on, running with the statement from Nevils blasting NBC\u2019s one-time highest-paid star.\n\n\u201cThere's the Matt Lauer that millions of Americans watched on TV every morning for two decades, and there is the Matt Lauer who this morning attempted to bully a former colleague into silence,\u201d Nevils said.\n\nShe said Lauer\u2019s denial\u2014in which he suggested former lovers were accusing him of misconduct because they felt guilty about having affairs\u2014would not scare her.\n\n\u201cI'm not afraid of him now, regardless of his threats, bullying and the shaming and predatory tactics I knew he would (and now has) tried to use against me,\u201d she said.", "description": "\u201cI honestly want to throw up,\u201d one NBC employee told The Daily Beast amid new disturbing claims about the network\u2019s dealings with Harvey Weinstein and Matt Lauer.", "authors": ["Maxwell Tani", "Lachlan Cartwright", "Lloyd Grove", "Media Reporter", "Senior Reporter", "Editor At Large"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_675,w_1200,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570673257/191009-Tani-Cartwright-Lauer-tease_mxtm8n", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
