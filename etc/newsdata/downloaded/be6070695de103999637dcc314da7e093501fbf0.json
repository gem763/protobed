I think we should sit round a table and get to the bottom of it rather than get all legal and public.\n\n\"Coleen is a very honest and lovely girl. She would never have gone and outed someone publicly like this if she didn\u2019t have 100% proof.\"\n\nLizzie, who is one of the people with access to Coleen's private Instagram stories, thought she had just gone a bit quiet.\n\npoll loading Was Coleen right to publicly name Vardy as leak? 500+ VOTES SO FAR YES NO\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nShe admitted she had no idea that Coleen was \"being Columbo\" and was shocked by the revelations.\n\nLizzie said: \"I couldn't quite believe it. Especially being Becky Vardy. I thought why would Becky do this? She doesn't need the money or fame.\n\n\"I can only think it's to score brownie points with the journalists.\"\n\nBut fellow former WAG Danielle Lloyd admitted she was not shocked as she has had \"run-ins\" with Becky before.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nLizzie, who was married to former Chelsea striker Jason Cundy, believes Coleen could have copied Jennifer Lopez's idea of giving those she doesn't trust fake stories.\n\nShe gave her sympathy for Coleen and admitted it must have been \"disturbing\" her family life.\n\nConceding that being friends with journalists doesn't mean Becky is guilty, Lizzie said she thinks Coleen is telling the truth.\n\nShe said: \"I think Coleen had to find the truth and I don't thinks she would have gone to the measures of outing her if she didn\u2019t have concrete evidence.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nLizzie has previously been at the centre of WAG drama, having been accused of selling stories and had it happen to her.\n\nShe revealed that back in the day a WAG she knew got a brand new car that was scratched the next day out of jealousy.\n\n\"It's like the drama of the series,\" joked Lizzie. \"It's sad lawyers are getting involved. I'll be mediator.\"\n\nBecky strongly denied all the allegations in a response to Coleen's tweet.\n\n*This Morning airs weekdays on ITV at 10.30am", "description": "The former WAG does not believe Coleen Rooney would publicly accuse Rebekah Vardy of selling stories without concrete evidence", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Itv", "Ken Mckay Itv Rex Shutterstock", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20551860.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_EHP_CHP_101019TM_5746JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
