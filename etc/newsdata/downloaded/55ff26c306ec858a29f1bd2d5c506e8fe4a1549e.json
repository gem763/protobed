Keep in mind: Though Miles 2.0 is technically in his infancy as a being, he and Miles are essentially the same person, with the clone acting as a refreshed, new-and-improved version of the original. Switching perspectives allows us to see how the same person can essentially break from himself, depending on the circumstances. Both Miles and Miles 2.0, like any human being (or clone thereof), make decisions based on context, and that context can lead to radical changes in direction.\n\nIn the last episode, we witnessed Miles, in a fit of jealousy and exasperation at his clone\u2019s success, decide to sabotage the whole secret arrangement. There was a little method to his madness, too: He presumed, reasonably, that Kate would have to choose him over Miles 2.0, despite being inferior to him in every way, because there\u2019s no getting around the fact that old, beaten-down Miles has at least been present with Kate from the beginning of their relationship. Whatever his merits, Miles\u2019s clone is just this weird thing that materialized from a strip-mall massage parlor. Kate may not want to be with any version of Miles, but it\u2019s certain that Miles 2.0 doesn\u2019t have a reasonable claim on his life.\n\nOn the other hand, it is his life. What are humans if not a repository of experience and memory? Miles 2.0 is obviously aware that he\u2019s a young, unnatural being, but that doesn\u2019t erase the fact that he\u2019s wholly composed of the experiences and memories that Miles accumulated up to the second he was created. So while Kate and Miles can rationalize kicking him out of the house \u2014 and then kicking him out of their lives once the Hillston campaign is finished \u2014 \u201cSoul Mate\u201d is about Miles 2.0 coming around to the idea that he deserves a lot more than he\u2019s getting. To quote a line from Miles\u2019s terrible play: \u201cLife doesn\u2019t take courage. Life takes guts. And guts takes balls.\u201d And Miles 2.0 has the guts and the balls to stand up for himself \u2014 first by deleting that line when he\u2019s ejected from the bedroom.\n\nThe key moment in \u201cSoul Mate\u201d happens before the promotion party, when Kate catches Miles 2.0 (who she still understands as just Miles) in their bedroom in the middle of the afternoon, clutching a pillow to take in her smell. Miles 2.0 has spent the day reminiscing about Miles\u2019s life with Kate \u2014 the old wedding pictures, the carved-out wood of a drawer \u2014 and when she suggests that he should attend the party, something clicks in him. \u201cYou should really enjoy tonight,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause you deserve it.\u201d And that\u2019s a fact: the Hillston account doesn\u2019t happen without Miles 2.0\u2019s creative inspiration and hard work, and it\u2019s unfair for Miles to draft off his achievement. He should get the praise from his co-workers and another gratifying round of laughs from the same stories he told at Kate\u2019s dinner party.\n\nMiles\u2019s decision to blow up their arrangement puts Miles 2.0 in a miserable spot. Kate understandably does not want the clone in her house \u2014 and barely wants Miles to stay, for that matter \u2014 so he\u2019s tucked away in a Homeaway Suite apartment for the time being, where he can continue to work on the Hillston account by day and return to amenities like a fitness center and a swimming pool sans water. At night, he masturbates to the increasingly less sexy photos of Kate that are still on his phone, and his weekends are merely empty. His sole confidante has become Miles\u2019s sister, who happily welcomes \u201cmy clone brother,\u201d probably because her actual brother has been an inadequate presence in her life, just like he has in everyone else\u2019s. Miles 2.0 takes away some philosophy from her weirdo boyfriend/model that sounds like a Jerry Maguire romantic theorem: \u201cA marriage is a union of two halves of the same soul, separated at birth. That each of us has a literal soulmate who each of our half-souls yearns to join with to form a whole. And that we are incomplete without that union.\u201d\n\nWhen Miles 2.0 gets back to his sad little apartment, armed with this idea and a suggestion to look for some action, his first step is to ask Kaylyn from work for a drink, which lands him in bed with her one cut later. It\u2019s an unsatisfying experience, underscored by Kaylyn\u2019s suggestion that they strike out for a \u201cbarge dance\u201d at three in the morning, a very young-person thing to do. (\u201cThere\u2019s a barge dance in the city. This DJ steals barges.\u201d) He then takes the much creepier step of sneaking into the Elliots\u2019 bedroom and snipping a lock of Kate\u2019s hair, with the hope of convincing the cloning parlor to manufacture him a mate. While it seems likely that more doubles are eventually coming on this show, this is not the time for that.\n\nThe episode ends with a fascinating twist, however. When Miles 2.0 gives up and creates a profile for himself on a dating site, he gets one perfect match, who turns out to be Kate. This affirms the \u201cunion of two halves\u201d thing, but it also gives Kate a secret of her own. One of the problems with Kate on the show so far is that she\u2019s only had to react to the havoc Miles and Miles 2.0 have visited on her life, and since Living With Yourself has been sticking so rigorously to their alternating perspectives, she hasn\u2019t had much dimensionality to her character. She\u2019s been resigned to the role of the aggrieved wife, who exists only in response to her husband(s). That she\u2019s capable of creating a dating profile seems like a stretch \u2014 she hasn\u2019t seemed like the cheating kind, despite her husband\u2019s shortcomings \u2014 but it gives her something of her own. And now the clone has some leverage.\n\nDouble Yous:\n\n\u2022 Miles\u2019s refusal to play along with the \u201cbrother from out of town\u201d lie now has his co-workers believing that he has a twin whose name is also Miles.\n\n\u2022 The confrontation between Kate and the two Mileses is Paul Rudd at his best, playing the miserable, hyperdefensive old Miles next to the optimistic, eager-to-please new Miles. They\u2019re a great comedy team that the show has, to some degree, broken up for the time being.\n\n\u2022 A good rule of thumb, related to the Top Happy Spa: Never agree to a surgical procedure from a guy who peppers casual conversation with the word \u201cdude\u201d a lot.", "description": "Miles 2.0 is coming around to the idea that he deserves a lot more than he\u2019s getting.
