If you decide where to live, work, or go to church; what to eat, wear, or say; or how fast to drive, you are pro-choice. The law \u2013 whether my parents\u2019 rules growing up or federal statutes \u2013 is about whether particular choices should be available.\n\nBy the 1970s, every state had decided that abortion should not be available in most circumstances or late in pregnancy. In Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court in 1973 claimed that the Constitution makes abortion available throughout pregnancy for nearly any reason. In other words, the court said that the Constitution is pro-abortion. It imposed an abortion policy that is more permissive than those of all but a few nations anywhere in the world.\n\nFor the past 46 years, Roe has been rightly condemned as an ends-justify-the-means distortion of the Constitution. It\u2019s an example of Thomas Jefferson\u2019s warning against that document becoming \u201ca mere thing of wax in the hands of the judiciary, which they may twist and shape into any form they please.\u201d It also demonstrates the difference between, as Justice George Sutherland wrote in 1937, interpreting the Constitution and amending it in the guise of interpretation.\n\nThat alone is enough to consider correcting this constitutional error, as the Supreme Court has done hundreds of times. The mere suggestion that it might consider doing so with Roe v. Wade, however, has sent abortion advocates into orbit, and their response reveals what it really means to be pro-abortion.\n\nOn May 23, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., introduced S.1625, the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act, which purports to prevent any limitations, and even to eliminate existing ones, on abortion. It is not only more radical than Roe v. Wade as abortion policy goes but, even with Roe still on the books, the WHPA is unconstitutional on its face.\n\nThe bill would prohibit any government entity \u2013 local, state, or federal \u2013 from imposing \u201climitations or requirements\u201d that \u201cmake abortion services more difficult to access.\u201d This \u201caccess\u201d includes anything that could conceivably make abortions less likely to occur.\n\nThe WHPA is more extreme than Roe v. Wade in several ways. First, it pretends that no other human being exists during a pregnancy. The bill never uses words such as \u201cchild,\u201d \u201cbaby,\u201d \u201cembryo,\u201d \u201cunborn,\u201d or \u201cmother.\u201d It uses \u201cfetus\u201d only once, to refer to a \u201cdead fetus\u201d in the definition of pregnancy. The Supreme Court, however, uses all of these words in Roe v. Wade and explicitly acknowledges not only that another human being is present, but that its presence significantly affects how the issues should be handled.\n\nSecond, the WHPA prohibits treating abortion any differently from what it calls \u201cmedically comparable procedures.\u201d Yet the other human being involved is precisely what makes abortion incomparable. Even the Supreme Court was candid that the \u201cpregnant woman cannot be isolated in her privacy. She carries an embryo and, later, a fetus, if one accepts the medical definitions of the developing young in the human uterus.\u201d This is, the court said, what makes abortion \u201cinherently different.\u201d\n\nThird, the WHPA says that the only permissible government consideration is \u201cadvanc[ing] women\u2019s health or the safety of abortion services.\u201d Just four years after Roe, however, the Supreme Court held in Maher v. Roe that a state may \u201cmake a value judgment favoring childbirth over abortion and to implement that judgment.\u201d\n\nFourth, the WHPA would prohibit policies that the Supreme Court says Roe v. Wade allows. The WHPA, for example, would prohibit government policies that even \u201cindirectly increase the cost of providing abortion services or the cost for obtaining abortion services.\u201d In Harris v. McRae, however, the Supreme Court in 1980 upheld the federal Hyde Amendment, which prohibited federal funding of abortion, stating that there is no constitutional right for a woman to have an abortion at public expense.\n\nIn addition to being even more pro-abortion than Roe v. Wade, the WHPA is patently unconstitutional. Congress has no authority to dictate the substance of state and local legislation or regulation. Congress isn\u2019t pre-empting state or local governments by affirmatively legislating in this area; the WHPA does the opposite, outlawing any action, by any government entity, that even indirectly limits access to abortion.\n\nTo top it off, the WHPA says that its directives \u201capply to government restrictions on the provision of abortion services, whether statutory or otherwise, whether they are enacted or imposed prior to or after the date of enactment of this Act.\u201d In other words, the WHPA not only prohibits any new limitations by any government anywhere but apparently repeals all existing ones.\n\nI have not spoken to anyone who has ever heard of such a thing. This is not a \u201csense of the Senate\u201d resolution expressing the opinion that government should allow access to abortion. This is federal legislation that tells every government entity \u201cor individual\u201d what legislation or regulation it may enact and apparently wipes every \u201coffending\u201d government action off the books.\n\nThe Constitution established a system of government in which power is separated among three branches and divided between the federal and state governments. Our liberty depends on maintaining these boundaries. The WHPA would reject it all.
