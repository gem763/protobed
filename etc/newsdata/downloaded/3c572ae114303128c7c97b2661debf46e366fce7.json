The museum, which opened in 2001, is the only Holocaust museum in Latin America, according to museum officials. It will have a grand reopening at the beginning of December after a renovation to add exhibits to its original collection of photos and other Nazi propaganda.\n\n\u201cThe great surprise of these objects was that they could not have belonged to anyone but someone in the Nazi hierarchy,\u201d Mindlin added. The artefacts were examined by Argentinian and German experts, who confirmed they came from the Nazi regime.\n\nThe stash was found in 2017 in the home of Carlos Olivares, a collector and seller of antiques residing in a wealthy suburb of Buenos Aires. The home was raided after allegations he trafficked in illegal objects from China.\n\nBut a surprise awaited police: a secret room with more than 80 Nazi-era relics, the head of Argentina\u2019s federal police, N\u00e9stor Roncaglia, told Reuters.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Among the relics are cranial measurement instruments used in pursuit of the Nazis\u2019 pernicious racial theories.

The experts confirmed the relics\u2019 authenticity, and Argentinian officials donated them to the museum.\n\nOlivares is being prosecuted for violating cultural heritage protection laws and will be put on trial for keeping the Nazi objects for commercial purposes.\n\nThe collection also included cranial measurement instruments, and a Ouija board inscribed with Nazi symbols, a relic of the occult elements associated with Nazism.\n\nDead zeppelins: Brazilian gravesite is airships' stairway to heaven Read more\n\nAn unknown number of Nazis fled Germany for South America after the fall of the Third Reich at the end of the second world war.\n\nAmong them were a number of high-ranking Nazi officials, who settled in Argentina and other South American countries.\n\nAdolf Eichmann, one of the main organizers of the Holocaust, lived in Argentina under a pseudonym until Israeli agents captured him near Buenos Aires in 1960.\n\nThe relics \u201cshow again that Argentina not only received Holocaust survivors but, unfortunately, Nazi leaders\u201d, said Mindlin.", "description": "Objects including bust of Hitler and a Nazi Ouija board to feature at Buenos Aires Holocaust Museum", "authors": ["Reuters In Buenos Aires"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dceb1438a16b40cc5affc90d062f61b0072cd82f/0_116_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f8582f9a7572eddd9722a3f713b667cc"}
