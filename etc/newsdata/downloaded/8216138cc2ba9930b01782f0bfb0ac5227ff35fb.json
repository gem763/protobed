Having previously linking up with everyone from artist Jeremy Deller to i-D, they\u2019re finally lending their deft hand to New Balance: the big brothers of practical and stylish American sportswear.\n\n\n\nIn their collaboration, announced today, the London brand, spearheaded by Sofia Prantera, have left their instantly recognisable mark all over NB. It\u2019s inspired by the transitory period in which sportswear was recontextualised into the style sphere in Britain, and is harnessed by its eye catching technicolour palette.\n\nThe sneaker line-up consists of two new colourways of New Balance\u2019s iconic Made in England 991 silhouette: one a sprightly mix of oranges and yellows; the other a lightning-bolt blast of neon yellow and green. On the apparel side, Sofia has created sweatsuits emblazoned with the NB and Aries logos, must-have long sleeves and socks, and a line-up of t-shirts that riff on New Balance\u2019s moniker, bearing the word \u2018Unbalanced\u2019 instead.\n\n\u201cThe term Unbalanced seemed to fit perfectly as an Aries graphic,\u201d Sofia says. \u201cBut also as slogan to promote inclusivity and unpredictability and the way sportswear is evolving as the new uniform for everyday life.\u201d\n\nFancy getting your hands on something? Some things? All of it? Well you can grab the collection on Aries\u2019s website and at their exclusive London pop-up on October 25th, before it launches worldwide and in select stores on October 29th. With prices ranging from \u00a330 to \u00a3200, check out everything from the collection below.\n\nThis article originally appeared on i-D UK.", "description": "New Balance?
