In cinema, my relationships, like my one with [director Carlo] Verdone, last a long time.\n\n'I'm all for the exclusives, when you want everything right away but get it all wrong.'\n\nNapoli chairman Aurelio De Laurentiis has dismissed reports of a rift with coach Ancelotti\n\nDe Laurentiis also told Lorenzo Insigne he must 'change his attitude' towards Ancelotti after the striker admitted the pair had been involved in fiery exchanges at training.\n\n'Insigne's an excellent sportsman, but he must stay calm, change his attitude and lay off certain things. He's always had an attitude of discomfort in Naples. I understand him, I protect him and I like him a lot, but he's always found his situation in Naples to be uncomfortable.\n\n'Therefore, I just want to say that he needs to calm down and become a more peaceful person, but that's his problem. Neither Raiola nor Ancelotti can resolve that.\n\n'He's a great player and he can be in good form or bad form. If he's less so, it's up to the coach not to play him. Insigne can't come out cracking jokes or with an 'almost' defiant attitude. The Coach is a family man, 60 years old, and won't tell you to get lost because he's three times your age.'", "description": "Napoli owner Aurelio De Laurentiis has told unsettled coach Carlo Ancelotti he 'can stay for another 10 years.'", "authors": ["David Wood For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/18/19849090-0-image-a-10_1571332480075.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
