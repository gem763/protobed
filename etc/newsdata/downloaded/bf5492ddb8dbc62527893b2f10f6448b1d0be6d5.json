Helen Gowans from the charity said: \u201cAs an ocean conservation charity, we do not condone the eating of blue shark and were disappointed to see that a blue shark was shown off as well as being featured on the chef\u2019s stage.\u201d\n\nFin tech: underwater robot monitors sharks in Scottish waters Read more\n\nIt is understood the shark was landed as \u201cby-catch\u201d, when fish and other marine creatures are trapped by commercial fishing nets by mistake. Members of the public reacted with outrage on Facebook.\n\nOne woman said: \u201cIn a time and city where we are encouraged to help with the protection and conservation of sharks many people think this is just terrible, especially with shark numbers dwindling.\u201d\n\nAnother person wrote: \u201cTotally out of order, killed and paraded. I thought these days were over.\u201d\n\nPlymouth city council said: \u201cUnfortunately during this year\u2019s Seafood festival a shark was inadvertently caught as a by-catch by a local fisherman on one of their regular commercial fishing activities and was then brought to the \u2018catch of the day\u2019 session on the main stage of the Seafood festival.\n\n\u201cWe and our partners are committed to protecting our marine environment and sustainable fishing, especially around endangered species such as sharks, and we do not condone what happened and we want to make sure this does not happen again in future events.\u201d\n\nGlobally, the blue shark is listed as near threatened on the International Union for Conservation of Nature red list. In the UK, it is a priority species under the UK post-2010 biodiversity framework.\n\nA spokesperson for the Shark Trust said: \u201cSharks are an inevitable part of by-catch, and at this time blue shark can be legally retained, sold and consumed. Having seen the photographs related to the auction, and how the shark was handled, we can appreciate that this caused distress to some festivalgoers, and was not the most appropriate approach.\u201d", "description": "Animal is paraded through town before being chopped up as part of cookery event", "authors": ["Steven Morris"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9b963c4e0c46a77abcd31b3744ae52ef709236f/0_364_4463_2678/master/4463.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d8b750471eca1d0bd68dfe6f30e72089", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
