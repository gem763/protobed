That is not the case.\n\nWhat the Canada Elections Act requires (like the Ontario Election Act and other similar provincial legislation) is that employers ensure their employees have a window of at least three consecutive non-working hours in which to vote. In many cases, that requires no adjustments to an employee\u2019s schedule whatsoever \u2014 for example, because the employee\u2019s shift doesn\u2019t start until at least three hours after polling stations open, or because his or her shift ends at least three hours before polling stations close.\n\nIt is only when the employee\u2019s scheduled shift does not permit that three-hour window that he or she must be accommodated with a later start, an earlier finish or paid time off in the middle of the working day. An employer cannot make employees start earlier or work later on election day to accommodate the three hours as that would be a penalty under the legislation.\n\nEmployers who have not already confirmed arrangements for their workers who require shift adjustments should do so now.\n\nAnd they can encourage their people to vote. To be clear, there is nothing off-side in an employer reminding \u2014 and even urging \u2014 employees to do so. Indeed, it is a mark of good corporate citizenship.\n\nWhat employers must not do, however, is attempt to influence workers as to how they vote.\n\nIn the unionized context, the reasons flare obvious. Because unions are inherently political, and make no bones about conspicuously identifying their preferred contenders, for an employer to encourage support for anyone other than the union\u2019s pet candidate would draw inevitable complaints and allegations of pressure, intimidation and anti-union animus.\n\nMoreover, in both unionized and non-unionized settings, human rights legislation in several provinces expressly prohibits discrimination on the basis of political opinion or belief. By implication, for an employer to express a political agenda would invite human rights complaints in those jurisdictions.\n\nApropos of the Thanksgiving weekend just past, I am mindful of the maxim that \u2014 to reduce the chance of indigestion \u2014 one ought to avoid debating religion and politics around the dining room table. The same holds true for the workplace.\n\nWhat should be beyond debate, however, is the imperative for both employees and employers alike to support the democratic process, and to actively discourage voter apathy. The stakes are simply too high for Canadians not to make their voices heard on election day.\n\nHoward Levitt is senior partner of Levitt LLP, employment and labour lawyers.
