However, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson still needs Parliament to approve the deal, which was announced on Thursday.\n\nThe Democratic Unionist Party, whose support may be crucial to Johnson winning the support of MPs, has refused to back the deal.\n\nMarketWatch is rounding up the latest reaction to the news from politicians and economists across Europe.\n\nEmmanuel Macron, president of France: \u201cWe had good news this morning with the finalization of the agreement which appears to be positive for the European Union and the British side. Now we have to go through the next steps, we have to be reasonably cautious.\u201d\n\nAngela Merkel, German Chancellor: \u201cThere has been movement in recent days, significant movement\u2026so we are on a better path than before but, today I must say very clearly, we have not reached the goal yet,\u201d Merkel told Germany\u2019s Bundestag lower house of parliament.\n\nGuy Verhofstadt, European Parliament\u2019s spokesman on Brexit : \u201cI regret #Brexit, but if it is to happen, this is a balanced agreement. Let\u2019s see if Mr. Johnson can find a majority in the House of Commons. If so, we will scrutinize the deal in the @Europarl_EN. The ball is in the camp of the members of parliament on both sides of the channel.\u201d\n\nSimon Coveney, Irish deputy premier: \u201cIt is a new deal. It is a deal that recognizes all of the issues that we have been raising for the last three years. It is a deal that will protect people on this island, it will protect peace on this island, it will protect trade on this island, and it will ensure there are no checks.\u201d\n\nXaver Bettel, Prime Minister of Luxembourg, said he was the one who always wanted to have a deal. \u201cNo deal is bad for all of us. So a deal is good.\u201d\n\nMark Rutte, Dutch Prime Minister, said the news was \u201cvery encouraging,\u201d but stopped short of saying whether he would back the proposed deal at this stage. \u201cWe have to study the details,\u201d he added.\n\nHeiko Maas, German foreign minister: \u201cThe deal is proof that we all worked very responsibly together.\u201d He said it was a \u201cdiplomatic feat\u201d but said it still needed to be discussed by both EU leaders at their summit and the European Parliament.\n\nV\u00edtor Const\u00e2ncio, Portuguese economist and former vice president of the European Central Bank: \u201cOn substance, I have to trust Michel Barnier when he says the deal fully protects the single market. However, not knowing details, I don\u2019t understand some points: 1) How exactly the system of choosing between two different tariffs at the sea border will work, according to the final destination of the goods being only Northern Ireland or being re-exported somewhere else\u201d.\n\nMiche\u00e1l Martin of Northern Irish political party Fianna F\u00e1il: \u201cWhat I would say to the DUP is that in no way does this arrangement undermine the constitutional status of Northern Ireland.\u201d\n\nNicola Sturgeon, Scottish First Minister, said in a series of tweets: \u201cFor Scotland, this deal would take us out of EU, single market and customs union \u2014 all against our will. It would leave us as only part of U.K. being taken out without consent and with no say on future relationship. The SNP won\u2019t vote for that.\u201d", "description": "European leaders cautiously welcomed a new Brexit deal between the U.K. and the EU.", "authors": ["Lina Saigol"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GZ663_Brexit_ZG_20181204134810.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
