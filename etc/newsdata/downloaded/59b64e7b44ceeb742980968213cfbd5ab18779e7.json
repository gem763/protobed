The news is a big boost for fans ahead of the crucial pool clash where they will be provided with limited catering.\n\nScotland has threatened legal action which could cost millions of pounds if the game were cancelled, but they will now get the chance for a straight shootout for a place in the quarter finals.\n\nScotland's clash against Japan will go ahead with fans present despite Typhoon Hagibis\n\nBack in Japan\u2019s team hotel, the team went about their day fully expecting the match to go ahead.\n\nWeather conditions improved drastically on Sunday morning local time, with storm clouds and torrential rain making way for blue skies and sunshine.\n\nWorkers were at the Yokohama Stadium early on Sunday morning local time to prepare the ground and its surrounding area.\n\nWhile World Rugby were yet to make an official public announcement on the Test\u2019s status, stadium staff were already fixing any damage caused overnight in the knowledge the game will go ahead.\n\nScotland need a win from their final pool match to make it through to the quarter-finals\n\nConcerns about flooding eased as footbridges approaching the stadium had not been submerged by water.\n\nOfficial signage was being repaired and marquees were being erected in anticipation of the arrival of more than 70,000 fans - although though there remained a possibility that the game could be played behind closed doors.\n\nRoad transport returned to normal service. Delays on the tube and rail networks were due to continue until midday local time, with infrastructure undergoing mandatory safety tests after the heavy weather.\n\nOne concern, however, has been whether there would be enough police and first response teams available to staff the match, with their presence potentially required elsewhere to help with the recovery efforts.", "description": "NIK SIMON IN YOKOHAMA: World Rugby have given the green light for Japan's game with Scotland to go ahead - with supporters also being allowed to attend the crunch clash.", "authors": ["Nik Simon For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/23/19638564-0-image-a-21_1570920319062.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
