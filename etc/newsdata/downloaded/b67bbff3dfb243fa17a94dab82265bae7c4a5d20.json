Losing the thread of the impeachment hearing process? We\u2019ll be recapping the latest development in installments on Intelligencer, from here until we get subpoenaed to appear before congress. This week: Bill Taylor\u2019s testimony and Rudy Giuliani\u2019s lawyer pals.\n\nWe really need to talk about Ukraine ambassador Bill Taylor\u2019s testimony. (Critics are saying: \u201ca lot of sighs and gasps!\u201d) But first, let\u2019s talk about Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman. All great works of drama feature a memorable, show-stealing pair of clowns \u2014 your Rosencrantzes and Gildensterns, your Vladimirs and Estragons. In the drama of Ukraine-gate (a.k.a Ukraine-ghazi, a.k.a. Uncle Rudy\u2019s Wild Ride), the questing couple whose artful failures reveal the icy abyss deep in the heart of human existence is the Ukrainian-Floridian lawyer duo Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman.\n\nParnas and Fruman are the kind of guys you call \u201centrepreneurs\u201d with very raised eyebrows; the kind of guys who scheme to sell liquified natural gas to a Ukranian state-owned energy company; the kind of guys, in other words, who are perfect informal associates of President Trump\u2019s informal diplomatic channel in Ukraine. Through big-dollar donations to the GOP \u2014 and payments to Rudy \u2014 the allegedly Russian mob-affiliated Parnas and Fruman secured clout with congressional Republicans, and meetings with Donald Trump and Donald Trump Jr. at Mar-a-Lago. They used that influence to push for the firing of Ukraine ambassador Marie Yovanovitch (whom they deemed insufficiently cooperative in advancing their business goals), and advertised their ties to Trump when trying to sell Ukranian energy executives on the merits of their gas deal. Meanwhile, they did the president a solid by imploring Ukranian prosecutors to investigate Joe Biden.\n\nThroughout this time, by the way, Parnas is posting photos of himself hanging out with Rudy and Trump to Instagram, making it, uh, not particularly credible when Trump says, \u201cI don\u2019t know them. I don\u2019t know about them. I don\u2019t know what they do.\u201d For future reference, if you\u2019re an Eastern European natural-gas entrepreneur who has a personal note of thanks from the president, post it to Stories, not the grid.\n\nAlas, Parnas and Fruman couldn\u2019t move their gas. And in pursuit of that ill-fated deal, they allegedly illegally funneled millions of dollars to former Texas Republican congressman Pete Sessions\u2019s reelection campaign, which recently got them arrested on campaign-finance violation charges. Whoops! In court this week, Parnas\u2019s attorney argued that some of the prosecutors\u2019 evidence may be subject to executive privilege \u2014 the presidential power to withhold information in the name of the public interest. His reasoning: Parnas had hired Giuliani as a lawyer, at the same time that Giuliani was serving as the president\u2019s lawyer \u2014 ergo, by the transitive property of executive attorney-client privilege \u2026 maybe Trump can make some of the evidence against Parnas go away? \u201cI don\u2019t know any more about how to invoke executive privilege than anyone else,\u201d Parnas\u2019s attorney assured reporters after the hearing. Well, fair enough.\n\nAnyway: Bill Taylor. In a closed-door hearing on Capitol Hill Tuesday, Donald Trump\u2019s acting ambassador to Ukraine gave an exacting account of the president\u2019s illicit diplomacy in Eastern Europe. Odd though it may seem, Taylor\u2019s testimony proved more damaging to the president than his own administration\u2019s lackadaisical confessions.\n\nTo understand how this could be the case, you need to acquaint yourself with William B. Taylor Jr. Like the Trump era\u2019s previous paragons of bygone bureaucratic virtue (James Comey and Robert Mueller), Bill Taylor is \u201cstraight from central casting.\u201d You could imagine him playing touch football on the lawn, or drinking scotch with a college professor who\u2019s actually a CIA recruiter, or whatever it is that Waspy diplomatic elites are supposed to do. Neither a conservative movement apparatchik nor a deep state liberal, Taylor is the humble servant of American imperium par excellence. A child of the Cold War, Taylor still believes that partisanship stops at the water\u2019s edge \u2014 or, at least, NATO\u2019s eastern borders. He\u2019s a West Point alumnus and Vietnam veteran, who has lent a hand to every White House since Reagan\u2019s, typically in a role dedicated to preempting the penetration of Russian czardom (communist or otherwise) into Eastern Europe.\n\nTaylor is no doubt a consummate professional, but you can imagine how a Washington Post kind of guy might react to a New York Post kind of president. The U.S. State Department has generally operated in the 20th century with a strict policy of saying the loud part (democracy, freedom) loud and the quiet part (American business interests, guns) quiet. Trump has operated with a loose policy of saying the loud part loud, the quiet part louder \u2014 and a new \u201cdefinitely should be silent part\u201d (the president\u2019s personal political and/or business interests) at an audible volume. His brand of diplomacy in Ukraine directly betrays the conception of national purpose that has imbued Taylor\u2019s world and vocation with meaning. Taylor did not abet the bombing of Vietnamese peasants to preserve the U.S. president\u2019s power to employ foreign governments as opposition researchers; he did so to preserve America\u2019s power to defend the liberal world order against the Kremlin.\n\nWhich is a long way of saying that the distinctive feature of Taylor\u2019s testimony is its emphasis on the geopolitical stakes of Trump\u2019s corruption. Poor Joe Biden is not the victim in Taylor\u2019s narrative \u2014 Ukraine\u2019s freedom fighters are. The other distinctive feature of the diplomat\u2019s account is that it is comprehensive, thoroughly substantiated with primary source documents, and ostensibly untainted by any ham-fisted ass-covering (unlike that of one Sondland, Gordan).\n\nTaylor\u2019s story begins a little like Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2019s in Commando: An aging erstwhile diplomat is enjoying a quiet life in the private sector (as aging erstwhile diplomats do), when the secretary of State asks him to come out of retirement for one last mission. At first, Taylor hesitates. He knows the ambassador he\u2019s being asked to replace, Marie Yovanovitch, is a first-class public servant. And he knows that she\u2019s been ousted for unseemly reasons, and worries he could get caught in the same \u201cweb of political machinations.\u201d But he\u2019s also spent the better part of a decade following Russia\u2019s incursions into Ukraine with alarm and exasperation. He had implored the Obama administration to send lethal aid to Ukranian forces, only to see his warnings ignored. He relishes the opportunity to beat back the Russian menace. So, when Yovanovitch tells him to accept the offer, Taylor takes her advice.\n\n(Who spun the \u201cweb of political machinations\u201d that ensnared former ambassador Marie Yovanovitch? That would be Rudy Giuliani\u2019s Russian-American \u2014 or, more precisely, Soviet-Floridan \u2014 clients.)\n\nBut when our hero gets to Kiev, he quickly discovers something is rotten in the state of Ukraine. The United States appears to have two separate diplomatic channels in the country \u2014 an official one led by himself, and an informal one led by the president\u2019s personal attorney, who is, uh, not really a traditional diplomat. And it becomes increasingly clear that these two teams don\u2019t just have separate missions, but conflicting ones. Taylor and his allies are eager for Trump to host Ukraine\u2019s new president at the White House. But Gordan Sondland \u2014 wealthy hotelier turned ambassador to the European Union turned Rudy Giuliani envoy \u2014 informs Taylor that if President Zelensky wants to see the Oval Office, he\u2019ll first need to show that he isn\u2019t \u201cstanding in the way of \u2018investigations.\u2019\u201d Taylor is baffled. Another Giuliani associate, U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine Kurt Volker, explains that Trump wants Zelensky to earn a White House visit by demonstrating a commitment to \u201crule of law, transparency, but also, specifically, cooperation on investigations to \u2018get to the bottom of things.\u2019\u201d You know: things. Like, uh, Hunter Biden, and a tremendously stupid right-wing conspiracy theory about illicit Ukrainian aid to the Clinton campign in 2016.\n\nFor Taylor, the president\u2019s bid to trade a White House visit for investigations into his domestic opposition is discomfiting. But he\u2019s far more alarmed by his subsequent discovery that military aid to Ukraine has ceased flowing \u2014 and this alarm is compounded by the fact that, at first, no one in the White House\u2019s official policy channel seems to know why.\n\nOutraged and confused, Taylor makes a visit to the front line in northern Donbass. He meets with a Ukrainian military commander who thanks the diplomat for his nation\u2019s much-needed aid. The ambassador bites his tongue and swallows his shame. He then gazes out at \u201cthe armed and hostile Russian-led forces on the other side of the damaged bridge across the line of contact,\u201d and thinks, \u201cOver 13,000 Ukrainians had been killed in the war, one or two a week. More Ukrainians would undoubtedly die without the U.S. assistance.\u201d This is the emotional center of Taylor\u2019s tale. Clive Cussler, eat your heart out!\n\nAnd then Taylor\u2019s story reaches its climax:\n\nOn September 8, Ambassador Sondland and I spoke on the phone. He said he had talked to President Trump as I had suggested a week earlier, but that President Trump was adamant that President Zelenskyy, himself, had to \u201cclear things up and do it in public.\u201d President Trump said it was not a \u201cquid pro quo.\u201d Ambassador Sondland said that he had talked to President Zelenskyy and Mr. Yermak and told them that, although this was not a quid pro quo, if President Zelenskyy did not \u201cclear things up\u201d in public, we would be at a \u201cstalemate.\u201d I understood a \u201cstalemate\u201d to mean that Ukraine would not receive the much-needed military assistance. Ambassador Sondland said that this conversation concluded with President Zelenskyy agreeing to make a public statement in an interview with CNN.\n\nWhy is this so damaging? Well, remember \u201cno quid pro quo\u201d? \u201cNo quid pro quo\u201d has been the \u201cno collusion\u201d of Ukraine-o-rama. Ever since the CIA\u2019s whistle-blower blew, you know, the whistle, and Donald Trump\u2019s shadow diplomacy in Kiev came to light, the White House has recited \u201cno quid pro quo\u201d like a mantra, cited to reporters, to supporters, while doing yoga, etc. As with \u201cno collusion,\u201d the point of the president\u2019s new refrain is to make his defense as simple \u2014 and his opponents\u2019 burden of proof as formidable \u2014 as possible. It has been the ONE WEIRD TRICK (Democrats HATE it!) of the impeachment process: To defend their man against the slings and arrows of outrageous facts, Trump\u2019s apologists needed only to memorize four words. To prove that Trump had committed impeachable offenses, however, his adversaries needed something akin to a video recording of the president telling his counterpart in Kiev, \u201cIf you do not investigate Joseph Robinette Biden Jr., I, Donald John Trump, will let Vladimir Putin paint the Donbass red with Ukrainian blood, and, by the way, I am absolutely not joking.\u201d\n\nAs with \u201cno collusion,\u201d \u201cno quid pro quo\u201d set a threshold for gross misconduct so absurdly high it would seem impossible for the president to clear, even accidentally. And yet, as always, our superlative president outdid himself. In late September, Trump strongly implied to reporters that he had held back congressionally ordered aid to Ukraine to coerce Zelensky into investigating \u201ccorruption\u201d \u2014 a phrase that he had literally just established as a synonym for Biden. Last week, the acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney announced at a press conference that Trump had withheld military aid from Ukraine so as to force its government to investigate a right-wing conspiracy theory about the 2016 election. Mulvaney instructed those who found such an arrangement offensive to \u201cget over it.\u201d But the Constitution, apparently, gives the Executive branch the inalienable right to \u201cbacksies.\u201d Hours later \u2014 after remembering the White House\u2019s four-word defense \u2014 Mulvaney released a statement clarifying that he actually did not say all those words that he had just said. Thus, with the executive authority to a \u201cdo-over\u201d duly invoked, Lindsey Graham could tell Axios on HBO that he would gladly support impeachment, \u201cIf you could show me that, you know, Trump actually was engaging in a quid pro quo.\u201d One prominent GOP defense of Trump has been that the Ukrainians were never told why their aid had been held up \u2014 ergo, whatever the president\u2019s intentions, there was effectively \u201cno quid pro quo.\u201d\n\nTaylor\u2019s testimony nullifies that argument.\n\nBut Taylor\u2019s account also reveals that the president never really saw \u201cno quid pro quo\u201d as a line of defense, anyway. Trump, a creature of television and public relations, thinks of language not as a tool for describing reality, but for dictating it \u2014 like a sovereign citizen at a traffic stop, or a 3-year-old. If the president says there was no \u201cquid pro quo\u201d \u2014 and a critical mass of GOP senators and right-wing media pretend to believe him \u2014 then for 40 percent of registered voters, the facts are clear. The phrase has always been less of an argument than a spell: Close your eyes, tap your heels together three times, and say \u201cthere\u2019s no quid pro quo, there\u2019s no quid pro quo, there\u2019s no quid pro quo\u201d \u2014 and poof, any illicit tit-for-tat exchange becomes magically legitimate.\n\nSo how are Trump\u2019s fellow mantra-chanters responding? Congressional Republicans are no strangers to mythmaking. But some retain Taylor\u2019s instinct to put empire before party using the brave and time-honored strategy of keeping mum and playing dumb in public, while whispering grave concerns behind closed doors. Another younger-leaning faction \u2014 whose worldview owes less to William F. Buckley\u2019s anti-communism than Rush Limbaugh\u2019s anti-liberalism \u2014 has enthusiastically enlisted in Trump\u2019s latest war on reality. Two dozen GOP lawmakers \u2014 some of our nation\u2019s finest car-dealership owners and fraternity brothers \u2014 muscled their way past Capitol Hill police and into the private chambers of the House Intelligence Committee, shouting that they\u2019ve only resorted to such anarchic measures because Democrats have taken the unprecedented, \u201cSoviet style\u201d step of holding closed-door committee hearings. (Congressional inquiries, of course, often begin with closed-door committee hearings. The GOP opened its 2012 probe of the Benghazi attack with such private testimony.)\n\nWATCH: here's the video of when 2 dozen GOP members, led by @mattgaetz entered the secure hearing room (SCIF) to interrupt witness testimony in the #ImpeachmentInquiry as they demand access, despite not being committee members. They're complaining it's a \"Soviet-style process\". pic.twitter.com/8KddYz3r9D \u2014 Scott Thuman (@ScottThuman) October 23, 2019\n\nWhich strain of Republicanism will prevail? The one that sees anti-Democrat propaganda as a tool for advancing American global dominance, or American global dominance as a tool for generating anti-Democrat propaganda? How quickly will Lindsey Graham reverse whatever position he\u2019s taken, again?
