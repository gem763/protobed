Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) said Tuesday.\n\nRepublicans have been hammering the younger Biden over his business dealings in Ukraine and China, where he served on several corporate boards, earning tens of thousands of dollars a month. President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to compel Ukraine to help investigate the Bidens were uncovered by a whistleblower complaint about Trump\u2019s July 25 call to the Ukrainian president.\n\nHunter Biden insisted he never did anything illegal or improper, even though he acknowledged in an interview with ABC that it was \u201cpoor judgment\u201d on his part to join the businesses and that it was likely that his last name helped him professionally. He also announced that he will resign from the board of a Chinese company by the end of the month amid the controversy that appears designed to target his father\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign.\n\nThat didn\u2019t stop people like Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee and the niece of Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), from calling out Hunter Biden for nepotism on Tuesday. But she wasn\u2019t the only GOP official with famous relations who took umbrage about nepotism in Washington. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), son of former Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas), and Donald Trump Jr. also weighed in.\n\nBut Senate Democrats, including Biden\u2019s top allies in the upper chamber, said they were unbothered by the GOP\u2019s concerns regarding Hunter Biden.\n\n\u201cIf you look at boards of directors all over the world, you\u2019ll find all kinds of people connected to them,\u201d said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who has backed Biden\u2019s candidacy for president. \u201cI served on them, my husband has served on them.\u201d\n\nThe California Democrat added: \u201cDid the last name Biden help? Sure, it helps everywhere, I think.\u201d\n\nSen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.) said Hunter Biden did \u201cpretty well\u201d in responding to the questions surrounding his work overseas in his interview with ABC.\n\n\u201cIn hindsight, it was probably poor judgment but certainly nothing illegal,\u201d Jones said.\n\nSen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), meanwhile, called it a \u201cnon-story.\u201d\n\n\u201cMuch of what the Trump administration has said about Hunter Biden, according to the fact-checkers, is just completely false,\u201d he added.\n\nLove HuffPost?
