But the more we spoke, the more reasons he found not to run a trial. \u201cMy boss has her heart set on using a certain software solution from the US. We\u2019re still negotiating terms with the supplier. There is so much politics involved.\u201d\n\nBlueChilli's Colette Grgic looks to bridge the gap between start-ups and corporates. Dominic Lorrimer\n\nI countered each argument with dwindling determination until a light in my mind flicked on, illuminating the real obstacle: the executive didn\u2019t want to run a trial because he might have discovered that the concept wouldn\u2019t work or needed to be substantially changed.\n\nThe company was funding his team to research and prototype. He had every incentive to prolong the development and defer launching something that might not fly. This is why big companies can\u2019t innovate, I thought.\n\nColette Grgic is chief innovation officer at BlueChilli, a firm looking to bridge the gap between start-ups and corporates. \u201cBig companies are so different from start-ups,\u201d Grgic says. \u201cThey\u2019re designed to move slowly, to optimise the core business, not to innovate and launch new products.\u201d\n\nBlueChilli runs innovation training and a \u201clean start-up accelerator\u201d at large corporates, including Coca-Cola Amatil and Stockland. Its programs identify entrepreneurs looking to build new products related to the industry in which the company operates. The start-up founders team up with employees to develop the ideas and get to market quickly, transferring new skills and mindsets in the process.\n\nGrgic says there are three key challenges big companies need to overcome.\n\nPerformance targets\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen we meet with a large corporate, we usually unearth a culture geared to improving things by 5 per cent each year,\u201d Grgic says. \u201cThe teams will be incentivised to deliver slightly better results than the quarter before. It\u2019s a huge risk to try something new.\n\n\u201cIf a company wants to encourage innovation, then one of the first steps towards changing the culture is to change the KPI structure. It must adopt a pragmatic approach and put experimentation and risk-taking on the agenda. Executives should be rewarded for sticking their head out and trying something new \u2013 whether it works or not.\u201d\n\nMindset\n\nMy experience, mentioned earlier, shows how differently start-up founders and executives approach innovation. As a start-up founder, I have limited time before my money and energy runs out. It\u2019s essential I release something quickly, test it with real customers and iterate. I\u2019ll lie in bed sweating while a well-paid executive with seemingly unlimited resources sleeps in comfort.\n\n\u201cStart-up founders live or die based on the success of their product,\u201d Grgic says. \u201cThey\u2019ll get obsessively close to the customer, work out how to solve their problem and how to make money from it. That\u2019s very different from the mindset of someone at a big company.\u201d\n\nSkillset\n\nFinally, start-up founders develop quite different skills. \u201cWe often find company executives have developed deep expertise in one area. But to innovate, you\u2019ve got to launch, measure and learn faster than the competition,\u201d Grgic says. \u201cWhen we run programs in these big companies, executives are often shocked to find themselves doing the jobs of 10 people.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve found that teaming up corporate employees and start-up founders helps to shift the mindset and build new skills inside big companies; it exposes them to a new way of thinking and operating.\u201d\n\nIt seems obvious that big companies need to innovate. The market is moving too fast to focus only on maximising an existing product \u2013 surely the risk of not innovating outweighs the risk of project failure.\n\nBut it\u2019s easy to forget that companies are not entities that can be reasoned with. They\u2019re full of individuals like the executive I met last week \u2013 executives whose primary motivation is to preserve the status quo, not launch and test a product quickly if it might mean failure.\n\nTech entrepreneur Rebekah Campbell is a co-founder of Hey You and co-founder of Zambesi.com.", "description": "Fear of failure is often at the heart of the reluctance of large businesses to think differently and move quickly.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4355%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_720%2C$y_389/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/61596d1e87968f90b04b80e34435231392275a3f", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
