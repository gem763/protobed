Rather, Joseph Maguire, a retired Navy SEAL vice admiral and now the acting intelligence chief, is described by friends and colleagues as a politically astute extrovert with a renowned sense of humor.\n\n\u201cHe many times referred to himself as the \u2018baby kisser\u2019 or as the political head of the organization,\u201d said a longtime acquaintance of Maguire, who hails from Brooklyn, N.Y. \u201cHe wants to be the New York mayor. A lot of people know that\u2019s his ambition. ... He has said that openly.\u201d\n\nFor now, however, Maguire is the acting director of national intelligence, and his political skills are being put to the test. When he showed up for work on Aug. 16, his first day in his new position, he was almost immediately presented with a political hand grenade in the form of a whistleblower complaint passed on from the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general, Michael Atkinson.\n\nAP\n\nThat complaint is now at the center of Democrats\u2019 call for an impeachment inquiry.\n\nAccording to the Department of Justice, the complaint relates to \u201ca confidential diplomatic communication between the President and a foreign leader,\u201d reportedly President Trump and recently elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, although multiple news outlets have reported the subject of the complaint is wider than a single phone call.\n\nThe law requires the director of national intelligence to immediately share with Congress whistleblower complaints deemed an \u201curgent\u201d concern. But acting on the advice of lawyers from his own office and from the Department of Justice, Maguire for days refused to do so on the grounds that the complaint was not directly related to intelligence matters. On Wednesday afternoon, the complaint was finally delivered to Congress, where House and Senate Intelligence Committee members are reviewing it.\n\nThat refusal unleashed an onslaught of criticism from senior Democratic politicians and transparency advocates. The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., has subpoenaed Maguire to testify before the panel, telling reporters that Maguire had made the \u201cunprecedented decision not to share the complaint with Congress.\u201d In the days since Schiff made the dispute public Sept. 13 by revealing that Maguire was withholding the complaint, the controversy has blossomed into an impeachment inquiry that threatens to bring down Trump.\n\nREUTERS\n\nCaught in the middle is Maguire, who friends and associates describe as an honorable man trying to do the right thing in an extraordinarily difficult situation not of his making. Those circumstances have earned him the sympathy of Dan Coats, the man he replaced in an acting capacity as director of national intelligence.\n\n\u201cI feel so bad for Joe,\u201d Coats told the Economic Club of Indiana on Tuesday, according to the Indianapolis Star. \u201cHe is caught in a squeeze here and the lawyers are divided.\u201d\n\nMaguire will have an opportunity to explain his position Thursday, when he is scheduled to appear before the House Intelligence Committee. The Washington Post reported Wednesday that Maguire threatened to resign if the White House tried to prevent him from speaking freely to Congress. He quickly issued a denial. \u201cAt no time have I considered resigning my position,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cI have never quit anything in my life, and I am not going to start now.\u201d\n\nMaguire had previously defended his conduct in another strongly worded statement issued on Aug. 24.\n\n\u201cIn light of recent reporting on the whistleblower complaint, I want to make clear that I have upheld my responsibility to follow the law every step of the way,\u201d he said. \u201cI am committed to protecting whistleblowers and ensuring every complaint is handled appropriately.\u201d\n\nMaguire\u2019s statement tracks with what his staff is saying, according to a former senior national security official. \u201cI know from his workforce that he feels \u2014 and they feel \u2014 he is leading them with integrity right now,\u201d the former senior official said. \u201cHe in no way wanted to be in the position he\u2019s in.\u201d\n\nMaguire, who retired as a vice admiral in 2010 after a 36-year Navy career, was serving as the director of the National Counterterrorism Center when Coats\u2019s resignation prompted Trump to make him the acting director of national intelligence. Multiple former officials suggested that Maguire\u2019s career trajectory had perfectly prepared him to lead NCTC, where he had previously served while in uniform. However, they said, he had never expected to be made the nation\u2019s most senior intelligence official, let alone to be thrust so quickly into the middle of a high-profile political drama.\n\nYahoo News\n\nNonetheless, those who know Maguire from the military say they trust him to adhere to principle and the law.\n\n\u201cOne of Joe Maguire\u2019s greatest attributes is this determination he had to do the right thing no matter how difficult or risky it might be,\u201d said retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Nagata, a Special Forces officer who said he \u201cfrequently interacted\u201d with Maguire during their time in uniform. \u201cHis reputation is one of being a very effective leader, a deeply compassionate officer and a morally courageous individual.\u201d\n\nMaguire is \u201csomeone on whose integrity I would stake my life,\u201d said the former senior national security official.\n\nOfficers for whom Maguire worked early in his career said there was little doubt that he was destined for a long career and high rank. \u201cI remember writing his fitness report,\u201d said retired Navy Capt. Rick Woolard, who commanded Maguire twice when Maguire was a junior officer. \u201cI said, \u2018This man is destined to be a flag officer. ... He\u2019s just good at everything.\u2019\u201d\n\nDescribing Maguire as \u201ctough, smart [and] hard,\u201d Woolard said he stuck out, even among the SEALs. \u201cI never had a better officer,\u201d he said. \u201cHe figured out what I wanted to be done and did it better than I could have asked him to do.\u201d\n\nMaguire \u201cwas one of the four guys who made the toughest combat swim in training or in real life that any SEAL had ever made up to that point,\u201d Woolard said. \u201cHe and three guys on an exercise penetrated a German base that was on full wartime alert and they got back out again.\u201d\n\nHowever, while Maguire \u201cwas very social with the guys\u201d on his teams, he tended to leave disciplinary issues to his senior enlisted personnel, said the longtime acquaintance who recalled Maguire\u2019s mayoral ambitions, adding that he did not approve of this approach.\n\nBut others who have known Maguire for many years expressed no doubt about his integrity. \u201cNo question about it,\u201d said retired Navy Capt. Ron Yeaw, who commanded Naval Special Warfare Development Group \u2014 better known as SEAL Team 6 \u2014 in the early 1990s, during which Maguire served as his No. 2 for a year. \u201cHe\u2019s just a quality, quality guy.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "Joseph Maguire is the acting director of national intelligence, and his political skills are being put to the test.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8ca66f220000e6015234c4.jpeg?cache=htuupkhgee&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
