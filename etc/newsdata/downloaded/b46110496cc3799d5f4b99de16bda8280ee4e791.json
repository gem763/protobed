REUTERS/Afolabi Sotunde\n\nLAGOS (Reuters) - Nigerian police plan to acquire stun guns and revise their rules of engagement in an effort to curb the use of deadly force, the inspector general of the force said on Thursday.\n\nThe West African country, which plays a pivotal role in regional stability, is riven by security problems ranging from armed bandits who have forced 40,000 people to leave the northwest in recent months to communal violence between nomadic herdsmen and farming communities in central states.\n\nLast month, a United Nations special rapporteur described Nigeria as a \u201cpressure cooker of internal conflict\u201d due to security problems and what it said was an excessive use of lethal force by police and military.\n\nMohammed Adamu told a gathering of senior officers in the capital, Abuja, that he had \u201cinitiated actions\u201d toward deploying less lethal weapons - commonly known as stun guns - for low-risk police operations.\n\n\u201cThis is with the intention of addressing public concerns on misuse of firearms by the police with its attendant consequences on lives and effect on the attainment of our community policing vision,\u201d Adamu said, according to a copy of the speech distributed to media.\n\nHe did not say how much the stun guns would cost.\n\nAdamu said the force had also revised and simplified \u201cForce Order 237\u201d, which outlines its rules of engagement.\n\nHe did not specify what changes were made, but said the redesign would ensure the \u201cprotection of fundamental human rights\u201d in policing.\n\nThe force is also arranging special training for certain units, including the counter-terrorism unit, anti-robbery and kidnapping squads, and criminal investigation specialists.", "description": "Nigerian police plan to acquire stun guns and revise their rules of engagement in an effort to curb the use of deadly force, the inspector general of the force said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1436945827&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF930JW-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
