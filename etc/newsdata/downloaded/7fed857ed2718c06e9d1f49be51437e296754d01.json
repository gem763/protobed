(Picture: WMBF)\n\nA two-year-old boy nearly died after he was bitten by a highly venomous snake.\n\nAtlas Johnson\u2019s parents are now just thankful their son is alive after he was attacked by a copperhead snake last week in Horry County, South Carolina.\n\nThe toddler\u2019s father, Gregory Johnson, told WMBF: \u2018Wednesday night, we were walking down the driveway and we were walking to the car and I stepped off the concrete first and as soon as Atlas stepped off behind me he got bit by a snake right here.\u2019\n\n\u2018Struck him in the back of the leg and I handed him off to his mother and we saw in the light two fang marks.\u2019\n\nGregory said he caught a glimpse of the snake and realized it was a copperhead, so he and Atlas\u2019s mother, Taylor Gibson, rushed the boy to the Conway Medical Center.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nAtlas was monitored for four hours by doctors who sent him home with Benadryl \u2013 but the next morning, Atlas\u2019s leg had swollen and begun turning black so his parent\u2019s took him back to the hospital.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGibson said: \u2018The staff at the hospital and MUSC, they came up with a plan that they were going to start giving the Crofab and they asked if we were okay with that and we said \u201cYeah, I want my little boy here.\u201d\u2018\n\nRacist calls teen 'N*****' and orders him 'down on his knees' for dropping gum wrapper\n\nCrofab is an anti-venom used to treat snake bites. Atlas was given the medication twice over the following day.\n\nHis mother said: \u2018The next morning his foot looked amazing compared to it being black when we were at the hospital.\u2019\n\nPictures taken Thursday show how quickly the snake venom caused the tissue on Atlas\u2019s leg to deteriorate. While copperhead bites are not usually fatal for adults, they are especially dangerous for children.\n\nCopperhead snakes are named after their reddish or golden tan color. They are not usually aggressive, but are more likely to bite when people unknowingly step on or near them.
