It strikes at American honor. What we have done to the Kurds will stand as a blood stain in the annals of American history,' said Romney.\n\nRomney blasted the Trump administration's sudden policy shift in a Senate floor speech\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks to Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan during the opening ceremony of the NATO summit in July 2018\n\nHe continued: 'There are broad strategic implications of our decision as well. Iranian and Russian interests in the Middle East have been advanced by our decision. At a time when we're applying maximum pressure on Iran by giving them a stronger hand in Syria, we've actually weakened that pressure. Russia's objective to play a greater role in the Middle East has also been greatly enhanced. The Kurds, out of desperation, have now aligned with Assad,' a reference to dictator Bashar al-Assad.\n\nRomney also questioned how the chaotic events \u2013 a rapid advance by Turkey, shelling of the Kurds, and a cease fire that might cement gains by Turkey \u2013 made the U.S. appear diplomatically.\n\n'Are we so weak and inept diplomatically that Turkey forced the hand of the United States of America? Turkey?\u201d Romney asked. \u201cI believe that it\u2019s imperative that public hearings are held to answer these questions, and I hope the Senate is able to conduct those hearings next week.\u201d\n\nHe said Turkey may have 'called America's bluff. 'If that\u2019s so, we should know it. For it would tell us a great deal about how we should deal with Turkey, now and in the future,' he said.\n\nWithout mentioning President Trump by name, he spoke glowingly of the Kurds, who Trump disparaged Wednesday as 'no angels.'\n\n'The administration speaks cavalierly, even flippantly, even as our ally has suffered death and casualty. Their homes have been burned and their families have been torn apart,' Romney said.", "description": "Utah Senator Mitt Romney said Thursday the retreat from supporting Kurdish allies on the border with Turkey 'strikes at American honor,' and called a ceasefire announcement 'far from victory.'", "authors": ["Geoff Earle", "Deputy U.S. Political Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/23/19861270-0-image-a-7_1571352590417.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
