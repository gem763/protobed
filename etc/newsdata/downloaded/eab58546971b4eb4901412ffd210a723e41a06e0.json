Countries including Australia and New Zealand have already banned the company from their domestic networks.\n\nUnder Chinese law, organizations can be forced to hand over data to the state if requested to do so, but Huawei has repeatedly denied claims that its presence in 5G networks would act as a back door for China.\n\nIn an emailed statement on Wednesday, a Huawei spokesperson told CNBC a \"fact and standards-based approach\" was the best way to address global cybersecurity challenges.\n\n\"We welcome the move the German government has taken to create a level playing field for 5G network vendors,\" they said. \"Politicizing cyber security will only hinder technology development and social progress while doing nothing to address the security challenges all countries face. Huawei will continue to work openly with regulators, customers, and industry organizations to ensure that mobile networks are secure.\"", "description": "The German government confirmed it will not ban the Chinese telecoms giant from its national 5G networks.", "authors": ["Chloe Taylor"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105748579-1550615043917rtx6n9js.jpg?v=1571224241", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
