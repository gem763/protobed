(Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)\n\nA growing number of Americans describe climate change as a crisis, and two-thirds say President Trump is doing too little to tackle the problem.\n\nThe results, from a poll conducted by The Washington Post and the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), point to a growing disconnect between Americans worried about the warming planet and Trump administration officials, who have aggressively scaled back Obama-era environmental regulations and relinquished the nation\u2019s role as a global leader in pushing for climate action.\n\nThe poll finds that a strong majority of Americans \u2014 about 8 in 10 \u2014 say that human activity is fueling climate change, and roughly half believe action is urgently needed within the next decade if humanity is to avert its worst effects. Nearly 4 in 10 now say climate change is a \u201ccrisis,\u201d up from less than a quarter five years ago.\n\n\u201cI am deathly afraid, not for my kids, but for my kids\u2019 kids and what they will have to deal with,\u201d said Mechaella DeRicci, 50, a respiratory care practitioner in Bristol, Conn. \u201cWhat are we leaving as a legacy besides a hot mess?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n[Read full Post-Kaiser poll results and how the survey was conducted]\n\nThough Americans are increasingly worried about climate change, fewer than 4 in 10 say they believe that tackling the problem will require them to make \u201cmajor sacrifices.\u201d And most are unwilling to pay for it out of their own pockets.\n\nFor example, while nearly half of adults say they would be willing to pay a $2 monthly tax on their electricity bills to help combat climate change, just over a quarter say they are willing to pay $10 extra each month. And while two-thirds support stricter fuel-efficiency standards for the nation\u2019s cars and trucks, increases in the gas tax remain deeply unpopular.\n\nInstead, clear majorities say they would prefer that climate initiatives be funded by increasing the taxes on wealthy households and on companies that burn fossil fuels.\n\nThe Post-KFF poll comes at a moment when the globe already has warmed more than 1 degree Celsius since the Industrial Revolution, and scientists say the world is heading toward catastrophic effects unless humans act quickly to slash their emissions of carbon dioxide. Major nations around the globe, with the exception of the United States, have pledged to work together to combat climate change as part of the Paris accord signed in 2015, but the world remains far off track to meet those goals.\n\n\n\nThe congested evening commute in the westbound lanes of Interstate 66 in Fairfax, Va., in November 2017. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\n\n[Dangerous new hot zones are spreading around the world]\n\nThe Post-Kaiser poll also comes in the midst of a quickening Democratic presidential campaign that has featured climate change as a central issue. Former candidate and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D), who made climate action the centerpiece of his campaign, drew little support and recently dropped out of the race. But his focus on climate action lives on in the proposals of some of the remaining candidates.\n\nFor Trump, climate change also could prove to be an issue, even among his GOP base. Though Democrats and independents are more likely to think climate change is caused by human activity, a majority of Republicans \u2014 60 percent \u2014 say they, too, believe that, The Post-KFF survey finds. And 23 percent of Republicans say they disapprove of how Trump is handling the issue, compared with just 9 percent of Republicans who disapprove of his job performance overall.\n\n\n\n\n\nTiffany Hickman, 42, vice president and general sales manager for Holston Valley Broadcasting Corp. in Tennessee, is a registered Republican who thinks climate change is real and linked to human activity. Asked whether she was a Trump supporter, Hickman said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say yes, but wouldn\u2019t say no.\u201d\n\nHickman said she would be willing to pay 15 percent more for electricity to combat climate change, comparing the decision to \u201cbuying a salad for $10 and cheeseburger for $3.\n\n\u201cI know which one is cheaper,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I know which one is healthier.\u201d\n\nThose surveyed gave Trump\u2019s handling of climate change the highest level of disapproval among six issues measured in The Post-KFF poll, with 67 percent saying they are unhappy with the president\u2019s performance.\n\nIn recent years, several other national surveys have found increasing public concern about climate change. The Post-KFF poll\u2019s finding that 79 percent think humans are driving global warming is significantly higher than some recent surveys have shown.\n\n\n\nA view of the heat exchange pipes at Global Thermostat, one of three companies seeking ways to skim carbon dioxide from the air. (Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Post-KFF poll asked for a yes-no response to the statement: \u201cHuman activity is or is not causing changes to the world\u2019s climate, including an increase in the average temperature.\u201d By contrast, an April survey by Yale University and George Mason University found 69 percent saying \u201cglobal warming is happening,\u201d with 55 percent saying in a second question that it is caused mostly by \u201chuman activities\u201d rather than \u201cnatural changes in the environment.\u201d\n\nThe Post-KFF poll also reveals a mixture of optimism about innovation and high levels of anxiety about climate change. Popular literature and films often portray a dystopian future, and many young people wonder whether they should bring children into the warming world. Yet 7 in 10 say it is very likely or somewhat likely that technological advances will stave off most of the negative effects of climate change \u2014 even though no large-scale breakthrough is on the horizon.\n\nThat belief in innovation is not firmly held; barely 2 in 10 think it very likely that technology will save the day. At the same time, 6 in 10 think they will have to make only minor individual sacrifices \u2014 if any \u2014 to help combat climate change.\n\nChrista Moseng, 41, a Democrat in Minneapolis, has already made changes in her daily life. She no longer has a car, choosing instead to get around by bus, train or bike. Through her utility company, she pays several dollars extra each month to ensure that her power comes from renewable sources.\n\n\u201cThe longer we wait, the more it becomes an insurmountable obstacle,\u201d Moseng said. \u201cWe need to deal with it as a crisis.\u201d\n\n\n\nA bicyclist on 14th Street NW in Washington in July 2017. The Washington-area commute is routinely ranked as one of the longest and most challenging in the nation. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Post-KFF poll underscores a sense of urgency among many Americans. Forty percent of people say action to combat climate change must come in the next decade to head off the worst consequences, but 12 percent say it\u2019s already too late.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s real, reasonable scientific evidence that if we don\u2019t make changes within a year or two, there\u2019s going to be irreversible damage,\u201d said Kristen Bailey, 30, a librarian in Macon, Ga., who describes herself as an independent.\n\nBailey said she is frustrated by the lack of action in Washington, and that climate will be \u201cone of my top priorities\u201d in the 2020 election. \u201cWe aren\u2019t doing nearly enough,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, many Americans want corporations and the rich to shoulder the financial burden of combating climate change. The Post-KFF poll finds:\n\n\u25cf Nearly 7 in 10 say money for climate action should come from increasing taxes on wealthy households. That proposal is backed by 83 percent of Democrats, 69 percent of independents and 44 percent of Republicans.\n\n\u25cf Six in 10 favor raising taxes on companies that burn fossil fuels, including 74 percent of Democrats, 64 percent of independents and 39 percent of Republicans. (Respondents were told that companies might pass along those taxes in the form of higher prices.)\n\n\u25cf About 4 in 10 support increasing the national debt to pay for programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. That support slips to 32 percent, however, when supporters are told that the U.S. government debt stands at $22 trillion.\n\nThe Post-KFF survey was conducted online and by telephone from July 9 to Aug. 5, among a national sample of 2,293 adults through Amerispeak, a survey panel recruited through random selection of U.S. households by NORC at the University of Chicago.Overall results have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.\n\n\n\nA glacier in the Kenai Mountains near Primrose, Alaska, on Sept. 6.

Impressed by photos and video of the melting polar caps, Wroten said that climate issues have risen \u201ctoward the top\u201d for him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty important stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is not a lot I can do about it right now. But I can vote.\u201d\n\nTrump does have pockets of support for his position on climate change: About 1 in 4 adults say the seriousness of global warming and climate change is \u201cgenerally exaggerated.\u201d That view is held by 56 percent of Republicans, 24 percent of independents and 5 percent of Democrats.\n\nRichard Merritt, 53, who is in the commercial shell fishing business in Maine, is among the climate skeptics. While \u201csome things have changed,\u201d he said, he thinks the waxing and waning runs of crabs, clams and quahogs could be just natural cycles.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s just Mother Nature,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI could be way off.\u201d\n\nMerritt remains a die-hard Trump supporter, saying, \u201cI support everything he\u2019s doing.\u201d He said he even has a bumper sticker on his pickup truck showing Trump making a rude gesture toward House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). \u201cI won\u2019t get into\u201d it, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Post-KFF poll finds that about twice as many Americans trust the Democratic Party as trust Republicans to handle climate change, 38 percent to 17 percent. But 35 percent overall say they trust neither party on the issue \u2014 a sentiment shared by 56 percent of political independents. And though 66 percent of Americans say Trump is doing too little to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, 56 percent say the same about the Democratic Party.\n\nStill, in follow-up interviews, several respondents were particularly dismayed by Trump\u2019s disdain for climate scientists and their dire warnings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s dumbfounding. Scientific data is scientific data,\u201d said DeRicci, the respiratory care practitioner in Connecticut.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m appalled that we left the Paris climate accord,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is beyond urgent. This is the 12-alarm fire that should have been acted upon years ago.\u201d\n\n\n\nPresident Trump speaks about the U.S. role in the Paris climate accord from the Rose Garden at the White House on June 1, 2017.
