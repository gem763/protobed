But even back on Friends, it wasn\u2019t so much about women being paid the same as men \u2013 some of the women were being paid more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It was more about, \u201cWe\u2019re doing equal work and we all deserve to be compensated in the same way.\u201d\n\n\u2018I wouldn\u2019t feel good going to work knowing someone was getting x amount and I was getting something greater.\u2019\n\nThemes of equality in the workplace takes centre stage in Jennifer\u2019s new series, The Morning Show, which will premiere on Apple TV when it launches on 1 November.\n\nLeading the releases for the brand new streaming service, the actress stars alongside Reese Witherspoon as news anchor Alex, who is dubbed \u2018past her prime\u2019 by male colleagues.\n\n\u2018One of the challenges for [my] character is the trauma and turmoil going on in her private life, and the toll that that takes on her emotionally, physically, mentally, versus the character that she is when she has to get up, put on a face and smile to America.\u2019\n\nComparing her life to Alex\u2019s, she added to the Daily Telegraph: \u2018I can relate to that. Of course there are times when you don\u2019t want anyone to see you, or you don\u2019t want to be photographed or even go out of the house.\n\n\u2018Nothing is as it seems in a glossy magazine.\u2019\n\nRead the fill interview in RadioTimes out today (Picture: Radiotimes)\n\nBut at least her character turns up and does her job well \u2013 which is more than we can say for the quite frankly horrid employee that is Rachel Green in Friends.\n\nThe full interview with Jennifer is available in RadioTimes from today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFriends is available to stream on Netflix and airs on Comedy Central and E4 in the UK.\n\nMore: Jennifer Aniston Rachel Green is the worst employee of the Friends gang with six sackable offences Just because Breaking Bad got El Camino doesn\u2019t mean Friends needs film reboot Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon recreate iconic Friends scene and it's everything\n\nGot a showbiz story?
