It comprises five bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms and three additional bathrooms, as well as a chef\u2019s kitchen, a fitness center, a two-level heated garage, a heated porch and a tool workshop.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very jealous that it\u2019s not my house,\u201d Mr. Lesnock said. \u201cI would get up every morning and throw on my trail gear, grab my dog and head out to the lakefront.\u201d\n\n\n\nSituated in the peaceful and private 210-acre housing community of Windom Ranch, the estate, known as Cascade Pointe, offers 32 private acres of hiking and biking trails, two decorative ponds with cascading water features, and an opportunity for further development on the property. The 210-acre Windom Ranch community is located 25 miles north of downtown Durango and comprises about 24 properties all set on 20 to 30 acres each, Mr. Lesnock said.\n\n\n\nThe house is outfitted in wood with stone accents. Listing photos show an expansive deck with lots of outdoor living space.\n\n\n\nMore:London\u2019s Kensington Palace Gardens Ranks as Most Expensive Street in Britain\n\nMr. Lesnock said the sellers, an older couple now retired from careers in finance, used the estate as a secondary property and are selling because they are not using it anymore. Mr. Lesnock declined to name owners; they also could not be identified through property records.\n\n\n\nThe records show that it was previously listed twice. The first in 2015 for $11.75 million and again earlier this year for $10.75 million with Zach Morse of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty. Mr. Morse was not immediately available for comment.\n\n\n\nThe auction will take place live onsite only.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: 20 Minutes With: Marrakech-Based Carpet and Homeware Dealer Ismail Zarib", "description": "", "authors": ["Miabelle Salzano"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-110023?width=1280", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
