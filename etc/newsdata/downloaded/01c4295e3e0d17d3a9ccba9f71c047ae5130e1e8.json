Continuity is key. - Add as much natural light as possible. - Centre main living areas around views of the outdoors. - Over-scale everything to create a more generous feel to the space. - Window seats and daybeds make great use of cramped spaces. - Add layers to tight corners with cushions, rugs and other styling objects.\n\nThe outdoor plunge pool is surrounded with white concrete, which was also used to make the benches in the kitchen\n\nMs Palmer said daybeds and built in seats like those used on her rooftop are an effective way to maximise space in small homes\n\nA rustic white stone staircase leads to the rooftop lounge\n\nMs Palmer's favourite part of the house is the downstairs space, which flows seamlessly from one room to the next.\n\n'The living room between the pool and kitchen is where we spend most of our days,' she said.\n\n'Once the rooftop is complete I'm sure that will become our favourite spot, especially at sunset.'", "description": "Interior designer Mon Palmer, from Perth, transformed a tiny 224 square metre house into a Mexican oasis complete with a plunge pool, rooftop lounge area and stylish stone staircases.", "authors": ["Alice Murphy For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/03/19866432-0-image-a-25_1571364170380.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
