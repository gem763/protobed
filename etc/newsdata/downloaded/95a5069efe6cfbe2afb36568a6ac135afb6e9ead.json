Gerry Connolly (D-Va.) this week.\n\nEarlier this month, Reps. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the late Elijah Cummings (D-MD), and Eliot Engel (D-NY) sent a letter to Perry seeking information about his involvement in the Trump-Zelensky call, citing a report that the Trump cabinet member undertook a role \u201cconveying or reinforcing\u201d the president\u2019s suggestion that he may provide U.S. military aid to the eastern European country if it investigated allegations of corruption against former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.\n\nPerry has flatly rejected the charge, while President Trump and Zelensky have denied any pressure was applied to look into the Biden family\u2019s business dealings.\n\nThe subpoena requested that Perry provide the documents by October 18th. Perry denied any wrongdoing in an interview with Fox News Friday morning to discuss his departure from DOE.\n\nPerry told Fox News Channel anchor Bill Hemmer on Friday:\n\nThere was no quid pro quo in the sense of what those folks out there would like for it to be. That we\u2019re [not] going to give you this money unless you investigate Joe Biden and his son. I never heard that said, anywhere, anytime, in any conversation. They have to do some things. They have to show us they\u2019re going to respect the rule of law, you\u2019re going to be transparent, they\u2019re going to unbundle their midstream gas company. All of those things were part of him coming in. And I think that\u2019s completely and absolutely legitimate. That\u2019s what we\u2019re supposed to be doing.\n\nThe development comes after Perry confirmed to President Trump on Thursday that he would step down from his post soon, though he did not offer a concrete date. Earlier Friday, President Trump announced he plans to nominate Deputy Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette to replace Perry.", "description": "Rick Perry has opted against complying with a subpoena from\u00a0House Democrats to hand over documents relating to his activities with Ukraine.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Rick-Perry-1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
