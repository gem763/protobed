And while the new parameters aren\u2019t foolproof, an important change is that every franchise will have to annually certify that its executives did not to free agents or their representatives before league rules allow.\n\nBut for years, the notion of waiting for the start of free agency to talk to available players has been largely ignored. This year, free agency was to officially begin at 6 p.m. Eastern on June 30, and many deals were known to be done within minutes.\n\n\u201cThere need to be consequences when rules are violated,\u201d Silver said.\n\nThe league told teams last week that fines would be raised in part to reflect the 600% increase in league revenue and the 1,100% increase in franchise value since the maximum-fine ceilings were last touched in 1996.\n\nThere are some elements of the new measures that still need to be worked out - specifically, the specifics behind the league\u2019s new mandate that five teams will be randomly selected for investigatory audits to see if there were any rule-compliance issues. The NBA wants teams to keep records of talks with players and agents for a year, and the league has the power to review a team\u2019s electronic communications devices.\n\nThe privacy concerns, however, remain a sticking point, Silver said.\n\n\u201cNone of us want people looking into their personal communications,\u201d Silver said. \u201cBut I think people who operate in a public company environment or operate in a financial world who are used to compliance procedures understand that you have to find a balance between disclosure and privacy so you can ensure that people will understand that there will be consequences for inappropriate behavior.\u201d\n\nIn other matters before the Board of Governors:\n\nTRAVELING\n\nThe issue of James Harden\u2019s stepback jumper - travel or not a travel? - may soon have some clarity.\n\nThe NBA is revising rule-book language regarding traveling, and specifically defining a \u201cgather\u201d - plus clarifying how many steps a player may take.\n\nFor players receiving a pass or picking up a loose ball, the gather is defined as when control of the ball is gained. Off the dribble, the definition is when a player has two hands on the ball, or brings it to a pause, or otherwise gains control.\n\nThe league is expected to release a training video next week, and said correctly calling travels gather will be a point of emphasis this season.\n\nSTARTERS\n\nDaily fantasy players and bettors will now know who is expected to play in a certain game a bit earlier than usual.\n\nTeams now must submit starting lineups 30 minutes before the scheduled start time, instead of the previous rule of 10 minutes.\n\nLineups can still change after the 30-minute mark, which gives teams flexibility if an injury occurs or is aggravated during warm-ups.\n\nFREE AGENCY\n\nSilver said there have been discussions about changing the dates of free agency, though noted that any change would have to be collectively bargained with the players. The Houston Rockets suggested last season that it would be a good idea to move free agency ahead of the NBA draft. \u201cMy sense is those conversations will continue,\u201d Silver said of the notion of changing the free-agency calendar. \u201cI don\u2019t have any expectation that anything is going to happen in the near term.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The NBA's board of governors was unanimous Friday in its approval of a plan to stiffen potential penalties for tampering with players and employees under contract with other clubs, hoping for increased compliance in existing league rules.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tim Reynolds"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/20/nba_tampering_basketball_96474_c0-194-5631-3477_s1770x1032.jpg?4f8364d59b9a7ea854bd9a38d5112acc7b9751ff", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
