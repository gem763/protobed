Lars Eller added an empty-netter from his own zone with 49.3 seconds remaining.\n\nT.J. Oshie, Nic Dowd and Alex Ovechkin also scored for the Capitals, who got 41 saves from Braden Holtby. Hagelin had two assists.\n\nDrake Caggiula, Dominik Kubalik and Patrick Kane connected for the Blackhawks, who rallied to tie it at 3 midway through the third. Alexander Nylander had two assists and Corey Crawford blocked 25 shots as Chicago\u2019s two-game winning streak ended.\n\nWashington defenseman John Carlson assisted on Ovechkin\u2019s goal. He entered with 17 points, tied with Edmonton\u2019s Connor McDavid for the NHL lead.\n\nKirby Dach, the third-overall draft pick in the 2019 draft, made his NHL debut for Chicago. The 18-year-old started centering a line with Kane and Dylan Strome.\n\nOshie opened the scoring with his team-leading seventh goal, on a power play at 9:25 of the first and just eight seconds after Andrew Shaw was penalized for holding.\n\nFollowing a faceoff in the Chicago zone, Evgeny Kuznetsov stole the puck from Duncan Keith along the back boards and fed it to Oshie, who was storming to the net. Oshie ripped in a 15-foot shot past Crawford before the goalie could react.\n\nChicago dominated later in the first, but Holtby was able to turn aside several prime chances. The Blackhawks kept up the pressure until Caggiula tied it 1-all at 8:15 of the second on their 26th shot.\n\nHoltby stopped Ryan Carpenter from the slot, but the rebound popped to the left of the net. Alexander Nylander corralled the loose puck and made a nifty behind-the-back pass to Caggiula, who was open the right edge of the crease.\n\nWashington\u2019s Chandler Stephenson was slapped with a double-minor for high-sticking and cutting Dach near the mouth at 9:25 of the second. Dowd scored a short-handed goal 28 seconds into the first penalty to give the Capitals a 2-1 lead and short circuit Chicago\u2019s momentum.\n\nAfter Kane lost the puck, Carl Hagelin carried it down the left wing on a 2-on-1 break with Dowd. He dished it to Dowd who fired a high one-timer past Crawford.\n\nChicago managed only two shots during the four-minute power play.\n\nOvechkin made it 3-1 at 3:52 of the third when he beat Crawford from the left circle with a one-timer after taking Carlson\u2019s cross-ice pass.\n\nKubalik cut it to 3-2 just 2:13 later. After Holtby stopped Brandon Saad\u2019s point-blank backhander, Kubalik buried the rebound from the edge of the crease.\n\nKane tied it 3 at 9:58, fooling Holtby from the right circle. After carrying the puck down the wing, Kane hesitated for a second, then fired a shot between Holtby\u2019s pads.\n\nNOTES: Dach was the youngest player (18 years, 272 days) to make his debut with the Blackhawks since Kane (18 years, 319 days) in 2007. Dach suffered a concussion in the Traverse City (Michigan) prospects tournament in September and eventually was sent to Rockford of the AHL for a three-game conditioning stint before being recalled on Friday. \u2026 Washington F Richard Panik (left shoulder) missed his second game after being injured in a collision with teammate and D Jonas Siegenthaler. Panik is on long-term injured reserve.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCapitals: At Calgary on Tuesday for the second game of a five-game road trip.\n\nBlackhawks: Host Vegas on Tuesday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Tom Wilson broke a tie with 8:13 left and the Washington Capitals rebounded after blowing a two-goal lead to beat the Chicago Blackhawks 5-3 on Sunday for their third straight win.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Matt Carlson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/20/capitals_blackhawks_hockey_25097_c0-153-3665-2290_s1200x700.jpg?9bd224f1f0b3bf50fdae6a97924e61512e9c770f", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
