Especially as this is also the point it\u2019s likely to drop the Early Access label.\n\nWe\u2019ll only know for sure when Epic Games make some kind of official announcement, which may happen during, or just after, The End live event that starts at 7pm BST on Sunday.\n\nEach season always has a live event to see it off but this time things will be different, as it\u2019s happening later than usual and Epic have warned the servers will be off for a long time while they reset everything afterwards.\n\nIt may be that we don\u2019t find out exactly what\u2019s going on till the servers are switched back on, so it\u2019s going to be an exciting and tense time for Fortnite fans this weekend.\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nMORE: Fortnite end of season event is this Sunday, servers switch off straight after\n\nMORE: Parents sue Fortnite for being too addictive\n\nMORE: Fortnite season 11 start date delayed, as Fortnite sales drop 52% in a year", "description": "The rumours of Fortnite getting a new map and major makeover are true, but while there's no Season 11 it's also not quite Fortnite 2.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Fortnite-Chapter-Two-399b_1570809515.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
