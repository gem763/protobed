Why not give us the choice and charge a bit extra? I'd pay.'\n\nAG Barr has been approached for comment.", "description": "The online campaign has been launched by lovers of the Scottish soft drink who are fed up with the new brew - which has less sugar.", "authors": ["Rory Tingle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/15/19496910-0-image-a-8_1570632963097.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
