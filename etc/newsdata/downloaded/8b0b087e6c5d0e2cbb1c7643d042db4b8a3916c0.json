At his house in Springs on the East Rand, police discovered that the man and his wife had been severely abusing their children.\n\nThe couple may not be named to protect the identities of the children.\n\nOn Monday, ahead of sentencing, the man was described as psychopathic and a sadist by a forensic psychologist who had evaluated him.\n\nIn his affidavit, the boy, now 15, says he hates everything about his father.\n\n\"He never loved me. I wish I could get another surname because I want nothing to do with him. I don\u2019t want to be his son,\" the boy says.\n\nThe boy blames his parents for not sending him to school and says he is now battling to learn to read and write.\n\n'I hate him so much'\n\nHe worries that he won\u2019t be able to drive a car when he\u2019s older because of his inability to read.\n\n\"I hate him so much, I would kill him if I could,\" the boy says.\n\n\"I wish there are people in jail who can hurt him like he hurt me. I wish they could also burn him with a blowtorch and hit him and shock him so that he will know how he hurt me. I sometimes see the scars he gave me, and I hate him.\"\n\nThe boy says he can\u2019t lead a normal life because of the abuse he endured.\n\n\"I know now that I did the right thing that night [by alerting the neighbour] because I helped my sisters and brother. Sometimes, I think if I hadn\u2019t done it, he would have killed me.\n\n\"I hope they hit him every day in jail. I hate him.\"\n\n\"I now have a dad who does stuff with me, I am very happy now. He was never a good dad. He must stay in jail forever and die there.\"\n\nThe boy also blames his mother for being complicit, saying he is angry with her for not intervening.\n\n\"She never even cried when he hurt me, she never tried to stop him.\n\nMy mother 'did nothing to help'\n\n\"I don\u2019t love her. She did nothing to help me.\"\n\nThe man's eldest daughter, now 20 and in Grade 12, says in her affidavit that she remembers little of her childhood because she has \"blocked out\" much of it.\n\n\"We were very afraid of our dad and when he came home, I always tried to keep the smaller children away from him. I thought if he didn\u2019t see them, he wouldn\u2019t think of them and then he wouldn\u2019t hurt them,\" she says.\n\n\"He would hit [the boy] in particular and hung him by his arms or legs from the rafters.\n\n\"My mother was always there and did nothing to help.\n\n\"He hit us with PVC pipes and a cane. I remember how he dragged my sister down a flight of stairs and how her head hit every step.\n\n\"There was so much that happened \u2013 I can\u2019t remember all of it.\"\n\nAbout being raped by her father, the young woman says: \"That is something I can\u2019t talk about. It\u2019s just another part of my life that he stole from me.\"\n\nThe man is expected to be sentenced on Wednesday morning.", "description": "Affidavits filed by two children of the 'Springs monster' make for grim reading - his son, now 15, says he hates everything about his father.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7807/b0819fb0d7d44afba8617f12df402baa.jpg", "published_at": "2018-10-02"}
