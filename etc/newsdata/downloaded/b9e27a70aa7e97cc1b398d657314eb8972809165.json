Due process has not been followed and the timing is overtly political.\u201d\n\nThe legislation that created the role decrees that the mayor of London, a job Johnson held from 2008 to 2016, is subject to a special standards framework, and that claims of alleged wrongdoing are thus passed to the IOPC.\n\nThe referral follows allegations first reported by the Sunday Times that when he was mayor he failed to declare close personal links to Arcuri when she received thousands of pounds in public business funding and places on official trade trips.\n\nJohnson has declined to comment in detail on the claims, including that a company run by Arcuri received access to money to assist her business, as well as places on trade trips, at times following the intervention of mayoral officials. The prime minister has said only that he rejects any wrongdoing.\n\nThe Sunday Times also reported that Johnson was, at the time, a regular visitor to Arcuri\u2019s east London apartment, and that she described him at the time as \u201cone of my best friends\u201d.\n\nSeparately, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport is investigating how Arcuri\u2019s most recent company won a \u00a3100,000 government cyber skills grant intended to assist UK firms, even though she has now returned to live in the US.\n\nThe letter informed Johnson that Michael Lockwood, director-general of the IOPC, would assess \u201cwhether or not it is necessary for the matter to be investigated in accordance with the relevant regulations\u201d.\n\nIt went on: \u201cThe conduct matter relates to your time as mayor of London between 2008 and 2016. During this time it has been brought to my attention that you maintained a friendship with Ms Jennifer Arcuri and as a result of that friendship allowed Ms Arcuri to participate in trade missions and receive sponsorship monies in circumstances when she and her companies could not have expected otherwise to receive those benefits.\u201d\n\nThe letter details the allegations, saying there was an obligation to examine any indications \u201cthat a relevant office holder may have committed a criminal offence\u201d.\n\nThe referral does not mean a full investigation, or a prosecution, will take place, and misconduct in public office is known as a complex area to prosecute. A criminal offence under common law, it penalises official wrongdoing that can be deliberate, deceitful or simply amount to excessive neglect of duty.\n\nThe government source said no evidence had been provided by the monitoring officer, \u201cnor was the PM given any opportunity to respond to the monitoring officer prior to the publishing of a press release late on a Friday night\u201d.\n\nThey added: \u201cThe public and media will rightly see through such a nakedly political put-up job.\u201d\n\nA Downing Street spokesman said: \u201cThe prime minister as mayor of London did a huge amount of work when selling our capital city around the world, beating the drum for London and the UK. Everything was done with propriety and in the normal way.\u201d", "description": "Case involves possible conflict of interest when Boris Johnson was mayor of London", "authors": ["Peter Walker"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f87068e9e2a01de14b6ac44f5d67005b3989b61e/1_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b6c8c72ede0f174dbe276c49fd670823", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
