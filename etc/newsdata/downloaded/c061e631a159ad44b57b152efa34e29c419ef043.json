(WAG is the nickname given to players\u2019 Wives and Girlfriends)\n\nColeen Rooney, who is married to Wayne Rooney, England\u2019s record goal-scorer now playing for MLS club D.C. United, grew suspicious that one of her friends was leaking information from her personal Instagram account to UK tabloid newspaper The Sun.\n\nSo she turned detective, blocking every one of the people she followed apart from her suspect, and spending months posting fake stories about herself and her family that only that suspect would now see.\n\nThese included her and Wayne seeking gender-selection help in Mexico for another baby after they had four consecutive boys, Coleen planning a return to TV, and most recently, the basement of their mansion flooding during a storm.\n\nAll these untrue stories duly appeared in The Sun, leading Coleen to conclude that her suspicions were correct.\n\nBut rather than confront the target of those suspicions privately, she did it in a new Instagram post, explaining what she had done, why she had done it, and sensationally naming her suspect as Rebekah Vardy \u2013 wife of another England player, Jamie Vardy.\n\nOr rather, she named Rebekah Vardy\u2019s Instagram account.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where the scandal took an explosive new twist, as furious Vardy hit back by emphatically denying ever leaking any stories about the Rooneys, suggesting it may have been somebody else who had access to her account (apparently at least seven or eight people did over the past few years) and announcing she has launched an immediate \u2018forensic\u2019 investigation into the bombshell allegations.\n\nDramatic revelations: Coleen's husband Wayne Rooney (left) and Rebekah's husband Jamie Vardy are both Premier League winners for Manchester United and Leicester City respectively\n\nNow, full disclosure: I know both women well.\n\nI enjoyed a riotously entertaining dinner in Los Angeles with Coleen and Wayne several years ago, have exchanged occasional emails with her, and she\u2019s a smart, funny, feisty, no-nonsense lady.\n\nI\u2019ve also interviewed Rebekah many times, had regular amusing text message conversations with her, and indeed only last week she invited me to be her guest at a forthcoming Premier League match between the team I support, Arsenal, and her husband\u2019s team, Leicester.\n\nBombshell: Coleen Rooney slammed Rebekah Vardy with this incredible and accusatory Twitter post claiming she had deduced that Vardy was leaking stories to The Sun\n\nShe\u2019s also a smart, funny, feisty, non-nonsense lady.\n\nSo I\u2019m not going to take sides here, particularly as nobody yet knows what really happened.\n\nBut as the world reels from this shocking tale of alleged betrayal between the high profile spouses of two of fabulous footballers, I am more intrigued by what it tells us about the notion of modern-day privacy.\n\nColeen Rooney has two Instagram accounts, one \u2018public\u2019 and one \u2018private\u2019.\n\nOn her public one, she has 815,000 followers and she herself follows 121 people or entities.\n\nOn her \u2018private\u2019 one, she has 367 followers and follows 617.\n\nIt\u2019s the second account that is at the centre of this furore, because Coleen believes everything she posts there is \u2018private\u2019 and only shared with people who she has allowed to follow her, and who she supposedly trusts enough not to repeat anything they see posted.\n\nAnd it\u2019s at this point that I raise a slightly quizzical eyebrow.\n\nI only completely trust about 20 people in the entire world, including close family members and long-time friends.\n\nThey are the people I know for sure would never let me down, and who would get out of bed at 4am to help me if I was in trouble.\n\nYet I have 412 \u2018friends\u2019 on my personal Facebook account, the only private social media account I run.\n\nHitting back: Rebekah Vardy replied very soon after the jaw-dropping allegations and completely denied that she was at fault or to blame for anything being leaked about Coleen Rooney and her family\n\nThese include former work colleagues, newer friends, distant family and various celebrities, none of whom I would completely trust. That\u2019s not to denigrate them, or impune their honour, it\u2019s just a reality check that if I suddenly posted something surprising like \u2018Hi everyone, I\u2019m gay and planning to announce my forthcoming civil partnership with David Hasselhoff on live TV tomorrow\u2019, I would expect that revelation to become public in about three nano-seconds, possibly sooner.\n\nSo why would Coleen Rooney, who is massively famous herself and married to one of the most famous people in British sporting history, ever think her posts to 367 people would remain \u2018private\u2019?\n\nShe may as well run into the street, scream out her secrets, and hope for the best that nobody runs to the papers.\n\nThat\u2019s not to defend Rebekah Vardy if she did leak those stories, or whoever else may have done it from her account.\n\nIf it WAS her, it would clearly constitute a terrible betrayal of her friendship with Coleen.\n\nBut I\u2019ve spoken to Rebekah today and she is absolutely adamant it wasn\u2019t her.\n\nI\u2019d certainly find it hard to understand if it was; she\u2019s married to a multi-millionaire, so doesn\u2019t need the money, and the stories aren\u2019t damaging to the Rooneys so can\u2019t be attributed to any seething jealousy on Ms Vardy\u2019s part as some are suggesting. Why else would she do it?\n\nRebekah\u2019s also seven months pregnant with her fifth child, and is now being bombarded with horrendous abuse from trolls gleefully assuming she is guilty.\n\nRegardless of whether she is not, this seems a very odd and insensitive time for another mother to publicly shame a long-time friend in this way.\n\nCouldn\u2019t Coleen have just picked up the phone and had it out with Rebekah in private?\n\nInstead, she\u2019s ignited a global fireball of gossip, intrigue and savage attacks on her now banished heavily pregnant friend that may lead down all kinds of tricky sidewalks.\n\nPut it this way: I suspect Rebekah Vardy has gleaned far juicier information from Coleen about the Rooneys than whether their basement got flooded.\n\nOn the wider point though, I still don\u2019t understand how the hell Coleen ever thought posting stuff on Instagram to 367 people was \u2018private\u2019?\n\nIt\u2019s not.\n\nIt\u2019s public.\n\nIf you truly want something to remain 100% private then I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ve got to take a leaf out of Osama bin Laden\u2019s book and view all electronic communication, and social media in particular, as a clear and present danger to your privacy.", "description": "PIERS MORGAN: Amid the spat between WAGs Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy one thing is clear - how can anyone think posting online to one person or 367 is going to ensure their privacy?", "authors": ["Piers Morgan For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/12/19536678-0-image-a-15_1570708310688.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
