Jonathan L. Weaks said. \u201cOur pilots should not be expected to take a significant and ever-expanding financial loss as a result of Boeing\u2019s negligence.\u201d\n\nSWAPA, which represents some 9,700 pilots, said in its filing that the pilots lost millions in wages due to Boeing\u2019s false representation of its 737 Max as being safe, airworthy and the same as previous models of the company\u2019s best-selling aircraft.\n\n\u201cBoeing made a calculated decision to rush a re-engined aircraft to market to secure its single-aisle market share and prioritize its bottom line,\u201d SWAPA said in its complaint. \u201cIn doing so, Boeing abandoned sound design and engineering practices, withheld safety critical information from regulators and deliberately mislead its customers, pilots and the public about the true scope of design changes to the 737 Max.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit is the latest setback for the troubled company that last month began to compensate the families of those who died in the fatal crashes of Lion Air Flight 610 last October and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 in March.\n\nThe company also reported a $3.7 billion adjusted loss in July, its largest quarterly loss ever.\n\nThe cause of the accidents has been blamed on a faulty stall-preventing system, which Boeing is working on a software fix for that the Federal Aviation Administration must sign off on before the Max 8 and Max 9 planes can return to the skies.\n\nBoeing called the lawsuit \u201cmeritless\u201d and it will \u201cvigorously defend against it.\u201d", "description": "Oct. 7 (UPI) \u2014 Pilots with Southwest Airlines sued Boeing Monday for more than $100 million in losses due to the grounding of the 737 Max aircraft", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
