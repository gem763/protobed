I never meant for this to happen and I hope that she's doing well.\"\n\nShe was the girl that Payton was closest too, while she admits that she \"didn't like Weier at all\".\n\nIn the interview she says: \"I just hung out with her because I knew that Morgan really loved her as a friend but she was always cruel to me.\n\n\"I feel like she was jealous that Morgan was friends with me and her.\"\n\nWeier and Geyser had been planning the grim crime for months, something that still shocks Payton.\n\nOriginally, they had planned to stab her to death at a sleepover they had invited her to but were unable to go through with it.\n\n(Image: ABC)\n\n(Image: ABC America)\n\nBut they were determined to carry out their twisted plan and the following day took a kitchen knife with them into the woods.\n\nPayton said: \"I didn't think much of it, it's just a walk.\"\n\nBut then Weier told Payton to lie on the ground and cover herself with sticks and leaves to hide herself.\n\nIt was while she was lying on the floor, defenceless, that the pair stabbed her 19 times and fled.\n\nBut they committed one more horrific act by telling their so-called friend that they were going to get help, which they never did.\n\n(Image: mirror.co.uk)\n\n(Image: mirror.co.uk)\n\nIn her police interview Weier said: \"So, we told her we we\u2019re gonna get help, but we really weren\u2019t. We were going to run and let her - pass away.\"\n\nAfter horrified detectives pieced together what had happened they launched a manhunt for the missing girls, who were trying to make their way to the Nicolet National Forest, where they believed Slender Man's castle was.\n\nThe forest was hundreds of miles from their home town and they were soon picked up by officers.\n\nThe two girls were charged as adults for the crime, something Payton believes was the right decision.\n\nShe said: \"If they had stolen a candy bar, sure that's a child, but you tried to kill somebody - that's an adult crime.\"\n\n(Image: mirror.co.uk)\n\n(Image: mirror.co.uk)\n\nThe high school senior admits she still has trust issues, especially when it comes to her friends.\n\nShe says trust is a \"big, big thing for her\" but that she knows in time it will get easier.\n\nPayton added: \"I don't think much of them. They will probably go away and fade eventually.\n\n'I'm happy, I have good friends that I trust pretty much.\"\n\nEven though Payton never wants to see or speak to the friends who tried to kill her, she has a surprising amount of acceptance for what happened.\n\nStill at high school she has big plans to work in medicine because of her experiences.\n\nAsked what she would say to Geyser if she ever did say her again, Payton said: \"I would probably, initially, thank her.\n\n\"I would say 'just because of what she did, I have the life I have now.\n\n\"I really, really like it and I have a plan. I didn't have a plan when I was 12 but I do now because of everything I went through.\"", "description": "Morgan Geyser and Anissa Weier were just 12 when they stabbed their friend, Payton Leutner, 19 times because they thought Slender Man would kill their families", "authors": ["Jane Lavender", "Image", "Abc America", "Abc", "Mirror.Co.Uk"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20723800.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FOP_213JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
