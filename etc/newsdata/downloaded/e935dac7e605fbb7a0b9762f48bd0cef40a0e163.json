Bernie Sanders addresses attendees at the \u201cBernie\u2019s Back\u201d rally at Queensbridge Park in Queens, N.Y., October 19, 2019. (Andrew Kelly/Reuters)\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders (D., Vt.) promised to \u201cpay for every nickel of Medicare for All,\u201d during a Tuesday interview but said that he doesn\u2019t feel compelled to explain how he would fund the program at this point in his presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cWe have laid out a variety of options that are progressive. We\u2019ll have that debate. At the end of the day, we will pay for every nickel of Medicare for All, and it will save the overwhelming majority of the American people, who will no longer pay premiums,\u201d Sanders told CNBC\u2019s John Harwood.\n\nMuch of recent news on Medicare for All has centered around Sanders\u2019s fellow progressive Elizabeth Warren, who was targeted by moderates in the October Democratic debate for refusing to admit that middle-class taxes must be increased to pay for the bill. In the days following the debate, Warren said that she would release a plan after \u201cworking for a long time on this question,\u201d but a leaked video from an August meeting showed distancing herself from the specifics of Sanders\u2019s plan.\n\nDuring the debate attack on Warren, Sanders chimed in \u201cas someone who wrote the damn bill\u201d that \u201cit is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up.\u201d\n\nSanders introduced the legislation on the Senate floor in 2017, which does not address how the single-payer system will be funded. \u201cThe tax increase they pay will be substantially less than what they were paying for premiums and out-of-pocket expansions,\u201d Sanders said during the Ohio debate.\n\nOther Democratic candidates, including former Vice President Joe Biden and South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg, have criticized the lack of detail on Medicare for All.\n\n\u201cHow will we pay for it? I want to hear. [Warren] has not said how she\u2019ll pay for it, and [Sanders] only gets about half way there. I lay out how I can pay for it and how I can get it done and why it\u2019s better,\u201d Biden said during the September debate.\n\nHours before the most recent debate, the Buttigieg campaign also released an ad targeting Warren and Sanders for \u201cinfringing on freedom\u201d in pushing for Medicare for All.\n\nSanders defended himself on Tuesday, arguing that debates around Medicare for All ignore the already-high cost of health care. \u201cThe fight right now is to get the American people to understand that we\u2019re spending twice as much per capita, that of course, we can pay for it. We\u2019re paying it now in a very reactionary, regressive way. I want to pay for it in a progressive way,\u201d he said.", "description": "Senator Bernie Sanders doesn't feel compelled to explain how he would fund Medicare for All at this point in his presidential campaign.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Zachary Evans", "Kevin D.
