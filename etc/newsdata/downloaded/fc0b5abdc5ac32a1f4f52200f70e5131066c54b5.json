Kaelin Jr and Gregg L Semenza and Britain's Peter J Ratcliffe won the Nobel Prize for advances in physiology or medicine on Monday. They were cited for their discoveries of \"how cells sense and adapt to oxygen availability.\"\n\nTwo literature laureates are to be announced Thursday, because last year's award was suspended after a scandal rocked the Swedish Academy. The coveted Nobel Peace Prize is Friday and the economics award on Monday.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
