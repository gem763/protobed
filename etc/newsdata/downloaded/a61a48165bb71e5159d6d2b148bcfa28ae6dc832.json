He sends his best wishes to Tennessee and Michigan, both teams that are likely to take big Ls. USA TODAY\n\nWe witnessed the first top-five upset of the season last week. Another this weekend is unlikely given the slate, but the possibility always exists in the world of college football.\n\nThat said, we\u2019ll turn our attention to a few key matchups among teams farther down the rankings who are trying to keep their hopes alive.\n\nHere are the five games in Week 8 with the most impact on the College Football Playoff race.\n\nNo. 16 Michigan at No. 7 Penn State\n\nSaturday, 7:30 p.m. ET, ABC\n\nBoth of these Big Ten East challengers face future dates with Ohio State, so it goes without saying that this is a virtual must-win for each. In theory, the Nittany Lions have some margin for error since they enter without a loss, but they can\u2019t afford to let this prime-time opportunity in front of their raucous fans slip away. If the Wolverines can somehow get out of State College with a \u2018W,\u2019 the narrative of another season of underachievement would suddenly get turned on its head.\n\nPenn State running back Journey Brown carries the ball against Michigan during their game in 2018.

That\u2019s a bit more understandable in Penn State\u2019s case with first-year starter Sean Clifford at QB. His attack has gotten a boost from freshman RB Noah Cain, who made some pivotal plays in the win at Iowa a week ago. Finding real estate against Michigan LBs Khaleke Hudson and Jordan Glasgow won\u2019t be easy, so the Nittany Lions will need WR KJ Hamler to stretch the field a bit. Wolverines QB Shea Patterson got a needed tune-up against Illinois to regain confidence from his own encounter with Iowa. The hostile environs as well as PSU DEs Yetur Gross-Matos and Shaka Toney will make his job extremely difficult.\n\nCRYSTAL BALL: Predictions for the second half in college football\n\nREPORT CARD: First-half grades for first-year college football coaches\n\nMIDSEASON AWARDS: Honoring the highs and lows from the first half\n\nNo. 9 Florida at South Carolina\n\nSaturday, noon ET, ESPN\n\nSouth Carolina coach Will Muschamp takes on his former team in a contest that just got a bit more interesting. The Gamecocks threw a monkey wrench into the plans of one playoff contender already last week. They have chances to derail a couple more, starting this week with the Gators. After coming up short at LSU, Florida must regroup quickly as dates with Georgia and potential spoiler Missouri lie ahead.\n\nThe good news for the Gamecocks is QB Ryan Hilinski, who left the Georgia game with a knee sprain, is expected to be ready. He could use ground support from RBs Rico Dowdle and Tavien Feaster, though Florida LB David Reese II could make that difficult. Gators QB Kyle Trask has been playing with a knee brace himself but is throwing very well. He\u2019d like to get big-play WR Van Jefferson more involved this week, but he\u2019d also do well to avoid Gamecocks CB Israel Mukuamu, who picked off three of Jake Fromm passes last week and returned one for a score.\n\nNo. 18 Baylor at Oklahoma State\n\nSaturday, 4 p.m. ET, Fox\n\nTwo Big 12 squads remain unscathed at the midpoint of the campaign. For Oklahoma, that was expected. The surprise is Baylor, seemingly well ahead of schedule in coach Matt Rhule\u2019s rebuilding project. The Bears have been somewhat fortunate in a couple of close calls, but they\u2019ll try to keep finding ways to win as they venture to Stillwater. The Cowboys, who\u2019ve had a couple of weeks to stew over a loss to Texas Tech, don\u2019t figure to be accommodating hosts.\n\nBaylor has certainly exhibited a flair for the dramatic, topping Iowa State with a last-second field goal and outlasting Texas Tech in an overtime track meet. QB Charlie Brewer leads the attack, but future star Gerry Bohanon might provide the occasional change of pace. The Cowboys\u2019 defense can be leaky, but S Malcolm Rodriguez usually minimizes the damage. Oklahoma State would be equally comfortable in a high-scoring affair, with outstanding playmakers like WR Tylan Wallace and RB Chuba Hubbard to help out freshman QB Spencer Sanders. The Bears\u2019 defense has been sound, but unfortunately mainstay LB Clay Johnston sustained a season-ending knee injury in the Texas Tech win.\n\nNo. 12 Oregon at No. 23 Washington\n\nSaturday, 3:30 pm. ET, ABC\n\nThe Pac-12 would need more than a few breaks, but its champion might still have a shot at reaching the top four. Though over a month remains of the season, this weekend could end up settling both divisions. Oregon, the league member with the most realistic path to the playoff, will look to stay two games clear of the field in the loss column and all but sew up the North. The Huskies will need help to chase down the Ducks even with a win, but last week\u2019s performance was encouraging.\n\nAfter a puzzling power outage at Stanford two weeks ago, Washington bounced back with an offensive explosion against Arizona. Both QB Jacob Eason and RB Salvon Ahmed got involved in the 51-27 romp. But the Oregon defense, anchored by LB Troy Dye and S Jevon Holland, is the best in the conference. The Ducks offensive stars are also finding their wings, hanging 45 points on Colorado after struggling a bit against the stout defenses of Stanford and California. Oregon QB Justin Herbert is up to 17 scoring throws with just one pick. Huskies DE Benning Potoa\u2019e must be disruptive.\n\nNo. 17 Arizona State at No. 14 Utah\n\nSaturday, 6 p.m. ET, Pac-12 Networks\n\nThis clash for first place in the Pac-12 South probably deserves a wider audience. Both the Utes and Sun Devils will still have work to do down the stretch, but the winner here will have a big leg up.\n\nThe Sun Devils have shown remarkable adaptability, able to prevail in a defensive slugfest like the game at Michigan State or a shootout like last week\u2019s back-and-forth duel with Washington State. The clash with the Utes\u2019 stiff defense, featuring LBs Francis Bernard and Devin Lloyd, figures to resemble the former. But the development of ASU freshman QB Jayden Daniels has been evident as the season has progressed. Utah was happy to regain the services of senior RB Zack Moss, who\u2019d been out with a shoulder injury, in last week\u2019s romp past Oregon State. He\u2019ll be needed against LB Darien Butler and the ASU defense. QB Tyler Huntley will have to provide some air cover as well.", "description": "Week 8 has several intriguing games that will impact the College Football Playoff, led by Michigan-Penn State, Oregon-Washington and Utah-ASU.", "authors": ["Eddie Timanus", "Published A.M.
