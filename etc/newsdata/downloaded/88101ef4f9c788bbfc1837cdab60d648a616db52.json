Security pros love doing smart home hack demos \u2014 often flicking lights on and off from miles away \u2014 and the patchwork nature of the devices means a setup is only as strong as its weakest link. The data collected by those devices is often some of the most sensitive data you have, leaving the entire sector under the looming threat of a data breach. But with so many different companies moving in so many different directions, solving the security and privacy problems can seem like an impossible task.\n\nNow, Nest and Google are trying to rein in that system. Nest\u2019s first stab at interoperability \u2014 a bundle of connections and services dubbed \u201cWorks With Nest\u201d \u2014 was unofficially canceled in May, and together with the Pixel hardware event, we got a peek at what\u2019s lined up to replace it. Nest is moving to a more tightly controlled system, restricting access to audited partners and tightly limited \u201croutines.\u201d It\u2019s part of a broader push to rein in the risks of home automation and prevent the kind of third-party-driven data breach that has hit so many competitors. But along the way, it means tightening Google\u2019s control over the world of home automation in a way that competitors may not like.\n\n\u201cif you\u2019re not willing to guarantee how you\u2019re treating consumer data, then maybe you shouldn\u2019t be doing this.\u201d\n\nIn a blog post on Tuesday, Google laid out three new ways to get non-Nest code into Nest devices. First, there\u2019s a limited set of \u201chome routines\u201d that can perform basic tasks like turning off lights or setting temperatures, which are designed as simple triggers that can be activated without sharing data. There will also be a new developer program that lets individuals reprogram their own Nest devices, although executives don\u2019t expect that kind of personalized programming to be widespread.\n\nMost of the information flowing to other devices will come through the third option, which Nest calls the \u201cDevice Access\u201d program. If you want your security system or your smart home hub to control the Nest, this is how you\u2019ll do it \u2014 and it will mean sharing Nest\u2019s data with the other company.\n\nEverything happens with explicit user permission, but it\u2019s still a fraught moment \u2014 a chance for a single bad actor to collect and exploit some of the most sensitive data you have. After Cambridge Analytica, it\u2019s not enough to leave users to make the decision, so Nest is putting tight restrictions on the companies that are allowed to participate in the program. In the post, Google describes those companies as \u201cqualified partners,\u201d but that qualification process is rigorous. Nest executives told The Verge that it would require annual privacy audits from a third-party auditing firm, an expensive and involved process for something that could be as simple as an API call.\n\n\u201cThis is the new reality right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome people will complain, but our view is, if you\u2019re not willing to guarantee how you\u2019re treating consumer data, then maybe you shouldn\u2019t be doing this,\u201d Nest GM Rishi Chandra told The Verge.\n\nIn part, it\u2019s an acknowledgment of how sensitive home data really is. These devices can tell when you leave your house, when you fall asleep, and what you cook for dinner. In a fully connected home, it\u2019s hard to do anything without leaving some kind of digital trace. And in most cases, that data is spread across multiple companies, leaving lots of opportunities for it to leak out. If that happened in a Nest-connected home, Nest would be on the hook for the privacy fallout \u2014 even if users had given permission to share the data.\n\n\u201cThis is the new reality right now,\u201d says Chandra. \u201cWe can\u2019t put the onus on the user to deal with their own privacy and all their information.\u201d\n\nThere are reasons to be nervous about this tightening of permissions. The companies making these devices aren\u2019t scrappy startups anymore. They\u2019re some of the largest companies in the world, and the competition over who controls what data will be a major struggle in the years to come. Ideally, Google wouldn\u2019t be setting the terms for how you can link your own devices. Even Chandra concedes that some kind of independent standard akin to ISO certifications would be preferable. But we don\u2019t have that standard yet, and without it, cleaning up the mess of home automation means making it harder to play the game.\n\nDieter Bohn contributed reporting.", "description": "In a blog post on October 15, Google laid out a new system for interoperating with Nest devices, which is designed to safeguard against data breaches in smart home tech.", "authors": ["Russell Brandom", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fAIeofYqYWPW0XIEn9Stx69gLuQ=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19281897/vpavic_191010_3722_0013.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
