This isn\u2019t real stuff. It isn\u2019t. It truly isn\u2019t. That part of it, that Barnum and Bailey, you know, say anything, do anything you want, you know, I mean like, you know, Donald 'Prince Humperdinck' Trump Jr. is not somebody that I really care about.\"\n\nShortly before taking his shot at Don Jr., Hunter Biden lauded his father for taking the high road in his political fights and said the Bidens aren't the type of family to go after a political rivals' children.\n\n\"Everybody kind of thinks that somehow -- whether it\u2019s a compliment that we\u2019re like the Kennedys or whether it\u2019s a backhanded compliment like you\u2019re the Trumps -- my dad has a job. But that does not mean that I had any plans to go do rallies and talk about Donald Trump\u2019s kids and I never will. That\u2019s not what Bidens do. My dad doesn\u2019t go after other people\u2019s kids. He just doesn\u2019t -- never has.\"\n\nNEWT GINGRICH: JOE BIDEN IS IN A 'MESS' THAT WON'T BE EASY TO GET OUT OF\n\nHunter Biden also said he doesn't feel like he is a distraction to his father's White House aspirations, and took a veiled shot at the Trump family, saying their personal dynamic is not that of a family business.\n\n\"No, personally myself I\u2019m not necessarily a distraction to his campaign,\" he said. \"I\u2019m never a distraction to my dad. But as it relates to actually going and being on stage with him, this is not a family business.\n\n\"Unlike [the Trumps] I don\u2019t spend a lot of time thinking about them. I really don\u2019t,\" Biden added. \"It\u2019s all noise and what they do is they create just an enormous amount of noise. I have to then answer questions about accusations made by probably the most unethical group of people that we\u2019ve ever seen in this republic.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Tuesday televised interview was Hunter Biden's first --and a departure from his silence --since his overseas business dealings came under scrutiny. He maintained that he did nothing improper while he served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.\n\nHowever, he told ABC's \"Good Morning America\" that accepting the lucrative position was, in retrospect, \"poor judgment.\"", "description": "Shortly after praising his father's civility and tendency to steer clear of other people's kids, Hunter Biden\u00a0insulted President Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., by comparing him to\u00a0Prince Humperdinck from the movie \"The Princess Bride\" in\u00a0a Tuesday\u00a0interview.", "authors": ["Nick Givas", "Nick Givas Is A Reporter With Fox News.
