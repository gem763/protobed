A friend of mine is new to the show, so we were catching her up. As one of the contestants was plating their snow egg (a dessert that is inexplicably real), I reached a sort of boiling point.\n\n\u201cCr\u00e8me anglaise is the thinnest custard! You might as well use melted ice cream!\u201d I scoffed in a tone usually used by elderly males when shouting at formations of water droplets in the sky. The next morning, my video producer Joel sent me the following message:\n\nImmediately, I felt a surge of warm, golden pride flow through my veins. My instincts were correct, and anyone who disagreed with my custard take would be disagreeing with the Countessa herself. This was just like the time Alton Brown sanctioned my bologna take, but better, because I value the approval of women more highly than the approval of men.\n\nAnyway. If you are not familiar, cr\u00e8me anglaise is a sweet custard sauce made with egg yolk, some sort of dairy, sugar and vanilla, which are all things you find in vanilla ice cream. As Ina explains in her new book Cook Like a Pro, \u201cVanilla ice cream is essentially cr\u00e8me anglaise that\u2019s been frozen. I reverse the process and end up with cr\u00e8me anglaise!\u201d It\u2019s very smart. And, as someone who \u2014 while in a slightly altered state \u2014 recently put some very expensive ice cream in the fridge instead of the freezer, it is also a hack that is very applicable to my life.\n\nIt should be noted, however, that you have to use good ice cream. Anything with a lot of fillers and stabilisers will melt in an unpleasant fashion, so grab H\u00e4agen-Dazs or better. Set the container in the fridge \u2014 or on the counter if you\u2019re in a hurry \u2014 let the ice cream melt, then spoon over any dessert that calls for cr\u00e8me anglaise. You could use it in on a snow egg \u2014 which, again, is a thing that British people like to eat, I guess \u2014 but a warm bread pudding sounds a bit more inviting.", "description": "Last Sunday, I was watching old episodes of the Great British Baking Show with a face mask on, yelling at the TV.
