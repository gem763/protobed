The New York Jets, Los Angeles Chargers, Philadelphia Eagles, Atlanta Falcons, Denver Broncos, Washington Redskins and Baltimore Ravens each have a 1-3 record against the spread, with the Ravens likely to add another loss to their sports betting ledger.\n\nHere is how we expect the Week 5 games to shake out, starting with three prime picks against the consensus point spreads (as of Thursday morning) from multiple sports books in Las Vegas.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFantasy football start/sit Week 5: Trust Julian Edelman against the Redskins\n\nBaltimore Ravens (-3\u00bd) at Pittsburgh Steelers\n\nPick: Pittsburgh Steelers +3\u00bd\n\nBaltimore\u2019s defense is suspect. The Ravens have forced opponents to go three-and-out just 21 percent of the time (ninth worst in the league) and feature a below-average red-zone defense (64 percent conversion rate allowed, also ninth worst). That has led to 2.4 points allowed per drive, the seventh-worst rate in the league.\n\nAfter adjusting these raw efficiencies for opponents faced, Baltimore has the fourth-worst defense of 2019. Only the Cincinnati Bengals, Indianapolis Colts and Miami Dolphins have been worse, per Football Outsiders. Those teams are a combined 2-10.\n\nGreen Bay Packers at Dallas Cowboys (-3\u00bd)\n\nAD\n\nPick: Dallas Cowboys -3\u00bd\n\nWideout Davante Adams (toe) and right tackle Bryan Bulaga (shoulder) could both miss Sunday\u2019s game, two major losses for Green Bay. Adams is currently fourth in the NFL with 378 receiving yards, with 180 of those coming last Thursday against the Philadelphia Eagles. Bulaga has yet to allow a sack this season and has been the 11th-best right tackle in 2019, per the game charters at Pro Football Focus.\n\nAD\n\nChicago Bears (-5\u00bd) at Oakland Raiders\n\nPick: Oakland Raiders +5\u00bd\n\nChicago\u2019s quarterback, Mitchell Trubisky, has a dislocated left shoulder with a slight labrum tear and is unlikely to play Sunday against the Raiders. In his stead will be Chase Daniel, a 10-year journeyman who has only once thrown for more than one touchdown in a game. He has just five touchdown passes over 184 career passing attempts.\n\n***\n\nAD\n\nThe three games above represent our best plays of the week because our analysis shows the point spreads are the most divergent from what we expect to happen once the teams take the field. Below are picks for the other games on this week\u2019s schedule. However, trying to pick every single NFL game is something of a fool\u2019s errand. The house wins so often partly because bettors try to make too many plays when the odds aren\u2019t in their favor. Keep that in mind when evaluating the remaining games from the Week 5 slate.\n\nAD\n\nLos Angeles Rams at Seattle Seahawks (-1\u00bd)\n\nPick: Seattle Seahawks -1\u00bd\n\nJacksonville Jaguars at Carolina Panthers (-3\u00bd)\n\nPick: Carolina Panthers -3\u00bd\n\nAD\n\nArizona Cardinals at Cincinnati Bengals (-3)\n\nPick: Cincinnati Bengals -3\n\nAtlanta Falcons at Houston Texans (-5)\n\nPick: Houston Texans -5\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers at New Orleans Saints (-3\u00bd)\n\nPick: Tampa Bay Buccaneers +3\u00bd\n\nMinnesota Vikings (-5\u00bd) at New York Giants\n\nPick: Minnesota Vikings -5\u00bd\n\nBuffalo Bills at Tennessee Titans (-3)\n\nPick: Tennessee Titans -3\n\nNew York Jets at Philadelphia Eagles (-13\u00bd)\n\nPick: Philadelphia Eagles -13\u00bd\n\nNew England Patriots (-15\u00bd) at Washington Redskins\n\nPick: New England Patriots -15\u00bd\n\nFive Redskins bright spots on a humiliatingly bad team\n\nDenver Broncos at Los Angeles Chargers (-6\u00bd)\n\nPick: Los Angeles Chargers -6\u00bd\n\nIndianapolis Colts at Kansas City Chiefs (-11)\n\nPick: Kansas City Chiefs -11\n\nCleveland Browns at San Francisco 49ers (-4)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPick: San Francisco 49ers -4\n\nRead more:\n\nFantasy football cheat sheet: Week 5 injury updates on Davante Adams and Sam Darnold\n\nThe Redskins would be a lot of fun if they were as good as Bill Belichick says they are\n\nWith Kirk Cousins struggling, the QB carousel of 2018 continues to sputter\n\nVernon Davis is in the concussion protocol, adding to Redskins\u2019 injury woes\n\nDerek Carr defends Vontaze Burfict, \u2018one of the most misunderstood people in the NFL\u2019\n\nRams\u2019 Todd Gurley hates Thursday night games, calls them \u2018the dumbest thing ever\u2019\n\nRanking the NFL\u2019s biggest surprises through the first quarter of the season\n\nAD", "description": "The Ravens have a 1-3 record against the spread in 2019.", "authors": ["Neil Greenberg", "Reporter Analyzing Advanced Sports Statistics For The Washington Post"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Nn5ADk4HXzPDek1K7Y5lIzP9xgs=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WEW5LXHC74I6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg"}
