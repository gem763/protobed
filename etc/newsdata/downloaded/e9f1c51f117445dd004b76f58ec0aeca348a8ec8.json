The supposedly pro-government forces in the south, where power is centred, include pro-independence factions from the north.\n\nThe south was an independent state before being forcibly unified in 1990, and the STC has said it wants to regain its lost status.\n\nThe separatists have received support and training from the UAE, even though it is a key pillar in the Saudi-led coalition.\n\nAbu Dhabi accuses Yemeni authorities of allowing Islamist elements to gain influence within their ranks.\n\n- 'Great efforts' -\n\nThe mistrust between the allies has posed a headache for regional powerhouse Saudi Arabia, which remains focused on fighting the Huthis, who are aligned with Riyadh's archfoe Iran.\n\nUN special envoy Martin Griffiths said he \"appreciated the kingdom's great efforts\" in mediating the south Yemen issue after a meeting Thursday with Saudi deputy defence minister, Prince Khalid bin Salman, according to a UN statement.\n\nThe UAE earlier this month handed over to Saudi forces key positions in Aden in a bid to defuse the tensions, and to support the negotiations towards a power-sharing deal.\n\nRiyadh in recent days appointed a new foreign minister, whose challenging portfolio also includes efforts to strike a broader Yemen peace deal.\n\nThe Huthis have offered to halt all attacks on Saudi Arabia as part of a peace initiative to end the devastating conflict, later repeating their proposal despite continued air strikes from the Saudi-led coalition.\n\nThe offer came after the Huthis claimed responsibility for attacks on September 14 against two key Saudi oil installations that temporarily knocked out half of the OPEC giant's production.\n\nRiyadh and Washington, however, blamed Iran for the attacks -- a charge denied by Tehran.", "description": "Yemen's southern separatists have struck a power-sharing deal with the internationally-recognised government aimed at ending a conflict simmering within the country's long-running civil war, sources on both sides said Friday.
