He faces charges related to the case in three different states.\n\nThe board's decision comes after weeks of closed-door deliberations about whether the board has the legal authority to discipline Petersen, an adoption lawyer. The Maricopa County Board of Supervisors doesn't have the power to permanently remove him from his office.\n\nHowever, state law does give the board authority to suspend the assessor for up to 120 days for \"neglect of duty.\" The supervisors said they believe Petersen's absence from office qualifies as neglect of duty.\n\nHe's been in custody since Oct 8.\n\n'Purest form of human trafficking': Arizona official indicted in adoption fraud scheme\n\nIt's unclear what, if anything, the supervisors will do after the 120-day unpaid suspension. They could use a state law that deems an elected office vacant if \"the person holding the office ceases to discharge the duties of office for the period of three consecutive months.\u201d\n\nPetersen's attorney Kurt Altman said in a statement that there was no basis for suspension.\n\n\"The allegations against him have nothing to do with the operation of the County Assessor\u2019s Office, which has not missed a beat during this trying time for Paul and his family,\" he said.\n\nHe said the board's actions were likely a violation of the Arizona Constitution and reiterated that Petersen is innocent until proven guilty.\n\n\"Actual evidence is presented in court. To date, there has been no evidence presented against him,\" Altman said.\n\nCharges against Petersen\n\nPetersen was arrested in Arizona after a state grand jury indicted him on 32 counts of fraudulent schemes, conspiracy, theft and forgery.\n\nThe Arizona Attorney General's Office alleges Petersen illegally arranged for 28 pregnant women from the Republic of the Marshall Islands to fly to Arizona, live crammed in a house he owns and deliver their babies paid for by the state's Medicaid system before placing them for adoption.\n\nPetersen charged families $25,000 to $40,000 per adoption, prosecutors said.\n\nThe criminal case spans three years and involves some 75 adoptions, authorities said, with about 30 adoptions pending in three states.\n\nHe also faces multiple felony charges in Utah and in federal court in Arkansas related to the alleged international adoption scheme.\n\nHow big was the 'baby mill'?: An Arizona elected official ran an illegal adoption scheme\n\nCounty audit released\n\nChairman Bill Gates ordered an audit into whether Petersen used public resources for his private-sector job following his arrest.\n\nIt showed that Petersen likely used his county computer and phone for work related to his private law firm. The auditor found no evidence that Petersen misused county funds.\n\nHere's what the audit found:\n\nComputer files\n\nPetersen became county assessor in 2013, but has worked in the assessor's office since 2006. The auditor reviewed files and documents dating back to 2006. About 1,500 computer documents were stored on Petersen's desktop and network folder from Jan. 25, 2006, through Oct. 1, 2019. Only 14% were related to county business. The remainder related primarily to adoption and bankruptcy cases from his private law business.\n\nOffice files\n\nThe audit team accessed Petersen's office. When the auditors found documents related to adoption activities, they stopped their search and worked with county management to seal the office, based on advice of legal counsel.\n\nInternet\n\nPetersen's web history from Feb. 20, 2019, through Oct. 28, 2019, showed 383 unique daily visits to websites. Of those visits, 17 were adoption related, 80 related to banking and investments, 36 were social media sites and the remainder were related to county business.\n\nEmails\n\nOf about 34,000 preserved emails reviewed, the auditor found 181 emails not related to county business. Thirty were related to adoptions, 120 related to other legal services and the remainder were personal.\n\nPhone calls\n\nThe auditor reviewed about 1,000 calls from Petersen's desk phone and 69 calls from his cell phone. The auditor found \"questionable international and out-of-state calls,\" including five calls to Jamaica, seven calls to the Philippines and five calls to Arkansas.\n\nThe auditor said his team did not have the \"tools and resources to clearly determine the nature and purpose of the calls to assess whether they related to county business.\n\nThe county incurred long-distance costs from calls made from the desk phone. Long-distance calls from the cell phone were covered by the county's wireless plan.\n\nChild abandonment or murderous scam?: Bizarre case of Ukrainian adoption gone wrong\n\nPetersen's absence from office\n\nBefore his arrest, Petersen spent little time at the assessor's office, according to an investigation by The Arizona Republic.\n\nPetersen badged into the parking garage for county government workers 53 times from Jan. 1 through Oct. 2, 2019, county records show. That's fewer than 30% of the available workdays.\n\nMost days that he was in the office, he spent about four hours there, records show. Petersen's taxpayer-funded salary is about $77,000 per year.\n\nContributing: Associated Press.
