A judge must decide to accept the plea in order for it to become final.\n\nRamos initially pleaded both not guilty and \u201cnot criminally responsible\u201d \u2015 the state\u2019s version of an insanity defense. In the new plea, he still maintains that he is not criminally responsible.\n\nThat means the next step is a hearing to evaluate whether Ramos belongs in state prison or a maximum-security psychiatric facility, the Gazette reported. To prove he is not criminally responsible, Ramos\u2019 attorneys must demonstrate either that he did not comprehend he was committing a crime when he shot those people or that his mental state made him incapable of following the law.\n\nProsecutors and other law enforcement authorities have said that Ramos had a long-standing grudge against the paper, having filed a defamation suit in 2012 for its coverage of a criminal harassment charge against him the previous year. A Twitter account bearing his name regularly disparaged the outlet and its staff.\n\nAt the time of Ramos\u2019 shooting, officials described it as a \u201ctargeted attack\u201d on the paper. According to Bill Krampf, deputy police chief of Anne Arundel County, Ramos \u201clooked for his victims as he walked through\u201d the building with a shotgun.\n\nGerald Fischman, an editorial page editor; Rob Hiaasen, an editor and Sunday feature columnist; Rebecca Smith, a sales assistant; Wendi Winters, a local news reporter and columnist; and John McNamara, a sports reporter and editor for the company\u2019s weekly publications, were all killed.", "description": "Jarrod Ramos, accused of killing five newspaper employees in June 2018, is asserting Maryland's version of an insanity defense.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db7415d2100002338ad4278.jpeg?cache=a006uxlmnp&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
