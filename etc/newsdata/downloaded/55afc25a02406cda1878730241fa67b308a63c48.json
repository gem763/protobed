This circle of businessmen and Republican donors touted connections to Giuliani and Trump while trying to install new management at the top of Ukraine\u2019s massive state gas company. Their plan was to then steer lucrative contracts to companies controlled by Trump allies, according to two people with knowledge of their plans.\n\nTheir plan hit a snag after Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko lost his reelection bid to Volodymyr Zelenskiy, whose conversation with Trump about former Vice President Joe Biden is now at the center of the House impeachment inquiry of Trump.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
