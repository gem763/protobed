I doubt if they exist,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMore importantly, to declare something to be impossible to climb to a bona fide rock climber is to issue a challenge.\n\n\u201cSo, I decided to build an exact replica and hold a competition.\u201d\n\nAhead of the official competition, several people had already managed to climb the wall.\n\nAmong these was eight-year-old Lucy Hancock, who climbed the replica using a belay \u2013 a rope that acts as a safety measure, rather than an aid. Footage showed her scaling the majority of the wall in little more than a minute.\n\nErik Kloeker, a 29-year-old climbing guide and property manager at Muir Valley who told The Courier Journal he had been climbing for nine years, climbed the structure in about 30 seconds in a demonstration.\n\n\u201cThe border wall that they\u2019re building could be climbed pretty easily,\u201d said Mr Kloeker, who juggled several items in one hand during repeat attempts.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

I\u2019m not doing that at all,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to do is to make sure that we\u2019re not blowing a lot of money on some silly nonsense of putting up something that he thinks can\u2019t be climbed. Because it can. And will be.\u201d\n\nDuring his September visit to the San Diego border, Mr Trump claimed hopeful climbers would \u201chave to bring hoses and waters [sic]\u201d to combat the large top panel of the design, which he said was designed to absorb enough heat to \u201cfry an egg\u201d.\n\nMr Trump recently denied making enquiries about creating a moat filled with alligators and snakes along the border.\n\nDespite campaigning on the promise that Mexico would pay for the structure, the Defence Department has been forced to divert some $3.6bn in military funding.", "description": "An 18-foot replica of Donald Trump\u2019s border wall has been scaled in a matter of seconds by novice climbers, an eight-year-old girl and a man who returned for another attempt while juggling with one hand.", "authors": ["Andy Gregory"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/12/16/border-wall.png", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
