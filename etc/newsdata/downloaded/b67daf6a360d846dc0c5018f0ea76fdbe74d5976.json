This was the year that Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters was crown.\n\nTHE LIVE SHOW\n\nThe live show is where the winner of the Miss Universe pageant will be crown. This year, it will once again be hosted by award-winning TV personality Steve Harvey.\n\nThe live show starts by introducing the audience to the contestants who have made it to the semi-finals of the competition.\n\nThe semi-finalists will take to the stage in their swimwear or athletic wear.\n\nFrom there, the evening gown portion of the show follows. \"The judges and fans will see the contestants' personal style as they walk the stage in their evening gown of choice,\" the site explains, adding that the design of the contestants' gowns does not affect the total score.\n\nFINAL QUESTION ROUND\n\nOnce the evening gown segment ends, the top six contestants are chosen based on their scores. This brings us to the most nerve-wracking part of the show \u2013 the final question round.\n\nThis round is designed to show off the ladies' ability to articulate themselves under pressure, while at the same time allowing them to give people a more in-depth look into their personalities, what they stand for, and what they could bring to their reign.\n\nOnce the scores from the final question round are tallied, we are left with our top 3 contestants.\n\nWatch the 2018 final question round here:\n\nFINAL LOOK\n\nWithout-a-doubt the best part of the night. The top ladies gather to show off their final looks as the host announces who will be crowned the new Miss Universe.\n\nRelive the crowning of Catriona Gray:\n\nCompiled by Nikita Coetzee (Soucres: Miss Universe organisation, Channel24, Rappler)", "description": "Pageant night will see the crowning of one lucky lady, but don't be fooled, choosing a winner starts long before the contestants hit that stage.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5470/177de91836da4e19b597512a3b7cbb6f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
