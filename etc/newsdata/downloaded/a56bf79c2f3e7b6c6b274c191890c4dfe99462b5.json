(Image: ILMxLab)\n\nI have thoughts about Marvel and ILM\u2019s newest Virtual Reality experiment, and none of them actually really pertain to what you\u2019ll be doing if you head out and book a ticket to try it.\n\nThursday, Marvel Studios and ILMxLAB announced Avengers: Damage Control, a location-based VR experience launching this October at select VOID VR locations in America. Unlike, say Vader Immortal \u2014 which was ILMxLAB making experiences for headsets users have at home \u2014 Damage Control is much in line with the experimental studio\u2019s previous Star Wars VR endeavour, Secrets of the Empire.\n\nPut on a headset and backpack with a bunch of other people, wander around a specifically designed space, and get to be fully immersed in a short experience. Instead of it being the galaxy far, far away, now it\u2019s alongside some of Earth\u2019s Mightiest Heroes.\n\nThe premise sees players visiting one of the outreach outposts T\u2019Challa began establishing across the world at the end of Black Panther tasked with trying out Shuri\u2019s latest invention: Emergency Response Suits, an amalgam of Wakandan Design Group and Stark Industries technologies.\n\nNaturally, things go wrong, and suddenly you find yourself suiting up to combat a mysterious threat \u201cfrom the past\u201d alongside the likes of Doctor Strange, the Wasp and Ant-Man and more. Letitia Wright, Benedict Cumberbatch, Evangeline Lilly and Paul Rudd will all reprise their respective MCU roles for the experience.\n\nGiven the at-home Avengers VR experiences we have right now, there\u2019s not much Damage Control has to do to provide a superior superheroic experiment \u2014 and based on its prior work with Star Wars, ILMxLAB seems very much equipped to deliver a cool, superpower experience in VR like this. But as cool as it all is, my initial beef with Damage Control lies more in the fact that... why the hell is Shuri, the smartest person in the MCU, emulating Tony Stark designs?\n\nShe can do, and has done, better! Avengers: Infinity War established her disdain for the cowboy work Tony and Bruce Banner were capable of with Vision, after all. And when she has the Black Panther suit right there, why should she even begin considering to use Iron Man designs as a basis for the ERS?\n\nYes, you could argue the hybrid approach \u2014 in the trailer above you can see a lot of Wakandan design influence in the otherwise very Iron Man/Rescue aesthetic of the suits you\u2019ll ostensibly be wearing in VR \u2014 is meant to be a part of Wakanda\u2019s outreach to the wider world. Play nice, use at least some of their tech while bettering it with Wakandan intellect and design. But man, it\u2019d be way cooler to be suiting up in a Black Panther-style Vibranium suit than Iron Man MK 50 gabillion.\n\nEven when dead, the long spectre of Tony Stark\u2019s shadow is cast far, it seems. Even in movie-adjacent VR experiences! Maybe I\u2019m just overthinking it and should just be excited for a Marvel VR experience that doesn\u2019t suck.\n\nWe\u2019ll find out if Damage Control fits that bill when it hits select VOID VR locations across the U.S. for a limited time, starting October 18. You can book your tickets to try it out for yourself here, if you really want to make the trip.", "description": "I have thoughts about Marvel and ILM\u2019s newest Virtual Reality experiment, and none of them actually really pertain to what you\u2019ll be doing if you head out and book a ticket to try it....", "authors": ["Alex Walker"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/lhyqc3pwjodppfh03njg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
