You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nHe had been facing questions for a long, long time by this point. I have watched on countless occasions when ministers stand at the despatch box and must find some words to respond to questions that are not questions at all, but statements, comments. Or to have to find new ways to respond to dozens upon dozens of variations of the same question.\n\nMore often than not, they find themselves making some sort of vague, half-baked linguistic link between the words they have been asked, and the wider point they seek to make.\n\nAnd for a moment, it looked like this is what had happened here. That though the words Johnson said were so outrageous, all he had really meant was: \u201cInsert question here, Jo Cox, I am exhausted, murble burble, Get Brexit Done.\u201d\n\nThe outrage that followed was instant, and it was real, both in the chamber and online. Calmer, more regular Westminster watchers, turned to one another and said, \u201cHe will regret that\u201d or \u201cHe will have to apologise\".\n\nThat is the fair and measured response. That is the way through which the prime minister can be given the benefit of the doubt.\n\nTo have said, at that stage, that these cheap words by a very tired person, who\u2019d been going at it for too long, were sufficient to talk of a deliberate strategy of sewing hatred and division would have been to go too far.\n\nSo, really, it is Thursday morning\u2019s behaviour that is the actual disgrace. Because the prime minister does not regret his words. After a good night\u2019s sleep, his official spokesperson had been instructed to tell journalists that, \u201cThe prime minister does not regret what he said.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Not only did he send a very junior minister to have to face down these impossible questions on his behalf, but instead, he told his own MPs at a morning meeting: \u201cLabour are trying to drive us off the word surrender because they know it is cutting through.\u201d\n\nIn an hour of questions, MPs from all parties \u2013 Labour, Lib Dem, SNP, Conservative and ex-Conservative \u2013 wanted to know whether the language used by the prime minister amounted to a deliberate strategy of division and hatred.\n\nKevin Foster, a decent enough sort who has been a junior minister in the Cabinet Office for all of two months, had been despatched to answer them. (Yesterday, Matt Warman, a similarly recently appointed and low-ranking minister, had had to stand in the same spot, and deal with questions about the prime minister\u2019s \u201ctechnology lessons\u201d.)\n\nHe did his best, but the prime minister had, through his actions, already made his position clear. In the morning, \u201cgovernment sources\u201d had been texting various Westminster journalists with quotes given under the condition of anonymity, full of phrases like \u201cactions have consequences\u201d that are routinely used by Dominic Cummings.\n\nOne especially hilarious source told Buzzfeed that he had named his imaginary dog \u201cLabour backs the Surrender Bill\u201d and that he had been \u201crunning around east London shouting it. I hope no one is too offended\u201d Who are we to question such epic hilarity? And who are we to doubt that such strategic brilliance will surely convert enough passers-by to win the Conservatives their first seat in east London in more than fifty years?\n\nThe answer to Philips\u2019s question had already been made known, and she knew it too.\n\n\u201cThe use of language yesterday and over the past few weeks such as the surrender bill, such as invoking the war, such as betrayal and treachery, it has clearly been tested, and workshopped and worked up and entirely designed to inflame hatred and division.\n\n\u201cI get it, it works, it is working.\n\n\u201cIt is not sincere, it is totally planned, it is completely and utterly a strategy designed by somebody to harm and cause hatred in our country.\u201d\n\nShe asked for an apology. No apology came, or will come.\n\nJohnson is already ready for a fully populist election, fought with all the same vicious fear and loathing as the 2016 referendum. He will seek to turn the people against parliament, and from a starting point whole orders of magnitude more febrile than it has ever been before.\n\nThe anger that will greet it will not be, to use Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s current bon mot, \"confected\". Many MPs make no secret that they fear for their lives. There is still time to draw back from the brink. But do not imagine for a second that Johnson will do it.", "description": "On Wednesday night, by the time Boris Johnson said his instantly infamous words, that \u201cthe best way to honour of the memory of Jo Cox was to get Brexit done,\u201d he had been facing questions over the despatch box for more than two hours.
