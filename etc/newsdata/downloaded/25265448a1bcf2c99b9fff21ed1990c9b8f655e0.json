President Donald Trump has long dismissed Robert Mueller's investigation as a \"witch hunt\".\n\nReports of the justice department's new criminal inquiry first appeared in the New York Times. It is unclear what potential crime is under investigation, the newspaper said.\n\nWhy is the Mueller report being investigated?\n\nThe administrative review of the Mueller investigation began in May. It is being overseen by US Attorney-General William Barr and is run by US federal prosecutor John Durham.\n\nMr Durham will have the power to summon witnesses and documents and to enrol a grand jury that could bring criminal charges.\n\nHe was tasked with determining whether the collection of intelligence on the Trump campaign in 2016 was lawful.\n\nMr Durham is widely respected and known for investigating links between FBI agents and organised crime, and investigating the destruction of CIA interrogation videos.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Mueller report - in 60 seconds\n\nLast April, Mr Barr told members of Congress that he believed \"spying did occur\" on the Trump campaign in 2016, adding: \"The question is whether it was adequately predicated. And I'm not suggesting that it wasn't adequately predicated. But I need to explore that.\"\n\nCritics accused Mr Barr of launching an administrative review more in the interests of the president than the interests of justice.\n\nIn a joint statement, the chairs of the House judiciary and intelligence committees said reports of a criminal investigation \"raise profound new concerns that the Department of Justice under AG Barr has lost its independence and become a vehicle for President Trump's political revenge\".\n\nThe two Democrats, Jerry Nadler and Adam Schiff, said the move could bring \"new and irreparable damage\" to the rule of law.\n\nPresident Trump said at the time he did not order Mr Barr to launch the administrative review, but added that he was \"so proud of our attorney general\" and it was \"a great thing that he did\".\n\nMr Trump has previously accused the FBI investigators who first launched the probe into his election campaign of treason.\n\nWhat don't we know?\n\nSo far, the justice department has not made clear what potential crime is under investigation.\n\nIt is also unclear why this investigation has started now, or what prompted it.\n\nAnd given the department itself appointed Robert Mueller to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 election, this criminal probe means the department may be in essence investigating itself.\n\nWhat's the Mueller report?\n\nThe 448-page Mueller report did not conclude that there was a criminal conspiracy between Moscow and the Trump campaign to influence the 2016 US presidential election.\n\nHowever, it did detail 10 instances where Mr Trump possibly attempted to impede the investigation.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Did the president refuse to be interviewed? Yes, says Mueller.\n\nThe report concluded that Russia had interfered in the election \"in sweeping and systematic fashion\".\n\nThat interference took the form of an extensive social media campaign and the hacking of Democratic Party servers by Russian military intelligence, the report said.\n\nTimeline of key events in Mueller inquiry", "description": "President Trump has long alleged that the special counsel's investigation was a \"witch hunt\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1032A/production/_109364366_057346629-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
