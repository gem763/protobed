"text": "Image caption Charlotte Davies said going into work was very stressful due to a fear of social interaction\n\n\"I have had people say 'you can't be autistic, you have a TV career', but they can't see behind closed doors.\"\n\nCharlotte Davies spends hours tattooing in her studio in Blaenavon, Torfaen, and is even a star on an MTV show.\n\nBut when she was a cleaner, the 27-year-old sometimes found it so overwhelming she hid in a cupboard.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Charlotte Davies says not enough was being done to help autistic people get into work and keep their jobs\n\nShe spoke out as trade unions said not enough was being done to help autistic people get into work and keep their jobs.\n\nThe Welsh Government said it was working to remove barriers to employment and change people's attitudes to disability.\n\nAn estimated 31,000 people in Wales have autism, a developmental disability that affects how people perceive the world and interact with others.\n\nA Wales TUC survey showed only 16% of autistic adults were in full-time paid work, while 77% of those out of work said they wanted a job.\n\nThe union said it was dealing with cases where staff were not getting reasonable adaptations in the workplace, required under the Equality Act.\n\nPeople who contacted BBC Wales spoke of feeling \"overwhelmed\" and said there was a lack of understanding from bosses and co-workers, and an unwillingness to make adaptations.\n\nOthers said they dealt with stereotyping while others had never worked due to issues with interview processes.\n\nImage copyright Charl Davies Image caption Charlotte Davies said little things such as mobile phone ring tones could be really \"painful\"\n\n'I felt trapped'\n\nCharlotte Davies, known as Charl, has almost 50,000 followers on Instagram, her own YouTube channel and stars on an MTV show about tattoo artists.\n\n\"I absolutely love being on camera, but it is the breaks between, it is hell sometimes, I am out of my comfort zone,\" she said.\n\nShe said she has felt \"different\" since she was 10: \"I started to feel like I had a piece of me missing, I felt a bit alien.\"\n\nAfter trying to get help from her GP in her early 20s, she was diagnosed with autism two years ago after a \"meltdown\" while out for a meal with fellow cast members.\n\n\"I felt trapped and I couldn't speak, they call it selective masking, I couldn't answer anyone,\" she said.\n\nCharlotte Davies Some people do not believe me, they say \u201cyou don\u2019t look autistic\u201d, but what does autistic look like?\n\nBefore opening her tattoo studio, Charl worked as a cleaner, but found it overwhelming.\n\nNow her own boss, she has adapted her workplace, changing the lighting and sometimes she wears noise-cancelling headphones, but still has days when she struggles to get into work.\n\nOne of her biggest challenges is going to the bank due to a fear of social interaction.\n\n\"But if I don't work I don't get paid, because I can be so confident and independent people don't understand.\n\n\"Being my own boss is the only way I feel I could survive in the working world, I don't believe employers would have the patience or the understanding to deal with someone like me.\"\n\nCharl Davies I get really overwhelmed with people and I physically can't talk, how would you explain that to an employer in the working world?\n\nA report into services in Wales earlier this year said there had been limited progress in employability improvements and it was too early to judge if new schemes had made an impact.\n\nSince its 2015 launch, just 1,010 people have completed the working with autism programme.\n\nFewer than 100 companies have signed up to the positive about working with autism charter, with some health boards, police forces and other public bodies not named in the list.\n\nGareth Hathway, from Wales TUC, said many workers faced daily discrimination, mainly due to ignorance.\n\n\"Our research has shown many employers are unwilling to make even the smallest of adjustments to make their workplace a little bit more autism friendly,\" he said.\n\n\"So those changes could be introducing autism awareness training, considering how they communicate with staff and reducing any unnecessary noise or smells in the workplace.\"\n\nThe TUC wants companies to have compulsory autism training and improve recruitment processes.\n\nMeleri Thomas, of the National Autistic Society Cymru, said: \"With a little understanding and small changes to the recruitment process and workplace, autistic adults can be a real asset to all sorts of businesses.\"\n\nThe Welsh Government said it was due to publish a new framework to deal with addressing the barriers disabled people face and was \"committed to helping disabled people fulfil their potential and achieve their ambitions\".", "description": "Tattoo artist Charl Davies says she would not survive in work if she was not
