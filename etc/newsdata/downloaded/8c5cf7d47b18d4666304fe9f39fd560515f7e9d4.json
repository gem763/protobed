Tommy is the child of the late Mike Doyle\u2019s son Scott and Pardoe\u2019s daughter Charlotte, who met as toddlers when their fathers were City teammates.\n\nDoyle senior, who died in 2011 aged 64, played 570 times in the Maine Road defence, leading City to 1976 League Cup glory and winning five England caps. Pardoe, meanwhile, is now 71 and made 380 City appearances as first a centre forward, then at full back, infamously breaking a leg tackling George Best in 1970.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mike Doyle, on the floor, fails to clear a George Best goal in a youth match against Manchester United.

Two-footed and blessed with near perfect balance and an exemplary attitude, Doyle reads the game well, sees a pass before many teammates and has captained junior sides for both City and England.\n\nBefore the Southampton game he sought counsel from Pardoe. \u201cI spoke to my grandad Glyn,\u201d said Doyle. \u201cHe said, \u2019just go out and do what you do\u2019. I went out and did the best I can. Hopefully Mike is watching down and is proud of me, I\u2019ve done it for him as well.\u201d\n\nDuring the game a banner in the stands in tribute to Mike caught his eye. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it before and it just makes me feel proud,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me to continue the Doyle legacy in a different era is a massive thing. Since he died I\u2019ve always wanted to make him proud so I\u2019ll keep my head down, listen to all the information I can get and see how far I can go.\n\n\u201cThe [senior] players were all telling me to go and enjoy it and, on the pitch, everyone talks to you and that makes life a lot simpler. As I walked out of the tunnel I looked at my family in the stands and I was ready.\u201d\n\nEven so he still has to pinch himself when he creates chances for Sergio Ag\u00fcero, a striker he was recently cheering on from the popular seats. \u201cI\u2019m giving passes to Sergio and it doesn\u2019t seem real,\u201d he said. \u201cHe gives you a lot of information but keeps it fun, keeps it happy. He\u2019s always laughing and joking which helps calm you dowm, make you feel better. To be playing with him is amazing.\u201d\n\nFoden, too, has offered invaluable help. \u201cI had a chat with Phil a couple of days ago in training and he just told me to play my normal game,\u201d said Doyle. \u201cI need to keep listening to him.\u201d\n\nPardoe could not resist reminding his grandson that he had made his debut at an even earlier age. \u201cI FaceTimed him before the game, and told him I couldn\u2019t wait,\u201d said Doyle. \u201cHe reminded me he was only 15, just getting a little dig in! But he\u2019s a legend at this club so I\u2019m fortunate to get advice others might not have.\u201d\n\nNot to mention inspiration. \u201cMy dad has videos and stuff, so I\u2019ve seen my granddad Mike do a few crazy things, and Glyn be pretty normal!,\u201d he said. \u201cI have their shirts at home, some of them in my room, and sometimes I just look at them, to remember\u2026\u201d", "description": "Every first-team debut is an emotional moment for the player involved but the teenager\u2019s bow at the Etihad proved an unusually evocative milestone", "authors": ["Louise Taylor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/026c6de2d422de927386664696f883025beb9f91/3_490_4557_2735/master/4557.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6f686e1651355b5d4b87e7a8748dcde2", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
