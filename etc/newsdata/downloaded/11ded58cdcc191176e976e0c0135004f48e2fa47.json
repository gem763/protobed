The NBA later apologized.\n\nWatch the full episode - <a href=\"https://t.co/oktKSJdI9i\">https://t.co/oktKSJdI9i</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/THR?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@THR</a> article - <a href=\"https://t.co/nXrtmnwCJB\">https://t.co/nXrtmnwCJB</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/Xj5a1yE2eL\">pic.twitter.com/Xj5a1yE2eL</a> \u2014@SouthPark\n\n\"We too love money more than freedom and democracy. Xi doesn't look like Winnie the Pooh at all,\" reads the tweet. \"Long live the Great Communist Party of China! May this autumn's sore gum harvest be bountiful! We good now China?\"\n\nSouth Park debuted in 1997, and most episodes are written and produced shortly before going to air, allowing the creators to respond to very recent events. The show's 300th episode airs Wednesday.", "description": "'Like the NBA, we welcome the Chinese censors into our homes and into our hearts,' wrote South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker.", "authors": ["Jennifer Van Evra Is A Vancouver-Based Journalist", "Digital Producer For Q.
