It\u2019s only still alive officially because neither the UK or EU wants to pronounce it dead, to avoid accusations that they killed it.\n\nThe inevitable blame game has begun. In attacking Downing Street for its aggressive briefings which tore up the diplomatic rule book, some EU leaders walked into a trap set by Dominic Cummings, Johnson\u2019s most influential adviser. Donald Tusk accused London of playing the blame game \u2013 but Jean Claude-Juncker and the Irish government then took part in it by saying a no-deal exit would be Johnson\u2019s fault. Other member states were unimpressed, warning that Brussels and Dublin were feeding the UK narrative painting the EU27 as the bad guys.\n\nTellingly, Germany did not retaliate against a one-sided version of Angela Merkel\u2019s frosty phone call with Johnson on Tuesday. A No 10 source, who everyone assumes was Cummings, claimed the German chancellor\u2019s approach meant a deal was \u201cessentially impossible, not just now, but ever.\u201d That Berlin did not return such fire suggests Merkel is keener on a deal than Johnson.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cThe fundamental problem is that Boris is not trusted, and this will only make it worse,\u201d one Brussels insider who genuinely wants a deal told me ruefully. \u201cWe do not want to be pawns in his election campaign. Everything he does is about that. He is talking to the domestic audience, while pretending to talk to us.\u201d\n\nThis belief matters. With the two sides poles apart on customs arrangements on the island of Ireland, the dominant EU view is that the UK is heading for an extension of its EU membership and an election. The Benn Act, forcing the prime minister to seek an extension if there is no agreement by 19 October, is being studied intently in Brussels. Another EU source admitted: \u201cWe would be having a different discussion [inside the EU] without it.\u201d\n\nSo with an election coming, Dublin and the EU are reluctant to play their last card \u2013 probably on customs \u2013 in case they don\u2019t need to, as there might soon be a different government in London. Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, could do it when he meets Johnson tomorrow. It could involve conceding a time-limit to the Irish backstop preventing a hard border. But this might prove too little, too late for Johnson: a five-year limit mooted by some EU figures would be too long.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Team Boris\u2019s response is: \u201call bets are off\u201d unless an agreement is reached now. As one No 10 briefing put it: \u201cIf this deal dies in the next few days, then it won\u2019t be revived.\u201d\n\nThe same intemperate briefing suggested the Tories would fight the election on a no-deal ticket. This was news to the cabinet, and some members challenged Johnson over it at its meeting yesterday. Some ministers suspect Cummings of trying to wreck any remaining chance of a deal because he actively wants a no-deal departure. Some 50-60 Tory MPs could refuse to run on such a manifesto. Some ministers claim they would resign over such a move. So Johnson could further split his fractious party if he opts for a no-deal platform in an attempt to prevent Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit Party exploiting what it would call Johnson\u2019s \u201csurrender\u201d to the so-called \u201cSurrender Act\u201d forcing an extension.\n\nMore likely, I suspect, is a Tory manifesto pledge of \u201cno delay\u201d to Brexit, which would leave open the possibility of one short, final attempt to reach a deal. A no deal promise, while the kind of crisp, hard message Cummings would love, could alienate many natural Tory voters. It would help Labour and the Liberal Democrats campaign on the many dire warnings about the economic impact of no deal.\n\nA no-deal ticket would also be a classic case of mis-selling. If Johnson won a majority and the UK left without an agreement, it would soon come knocking at the EU\u2019s door for a free trade agreement with its closest trading partner and destination of almost half its exports. If the UK had tried to wriggle out of its \u00a339bn divorce payment, that would immediately be put back on the table by the EU. So would EU proposals to avoid customs checks on the island of Ireland.\n\nSo no-deal is a chimera. At some point, the UK will need a deal, if only to prevent an economic catastrophe. The prospects of reaching one would hardly be helped by the acrimonious exit which now looks on the cards if Johnson remains in power.", "description": "Boris Johnson\u2019s proposed Brexit deal is on life support.
