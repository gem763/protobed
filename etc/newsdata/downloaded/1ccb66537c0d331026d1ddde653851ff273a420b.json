But scratch the surface \u2014 and it\u2019s why we talk about eco-fascism \u2014 and what you find is something really rather oppressive, authoritarian and sinister.\n\nLet\u2019s just pause, for a moment, and consider what on earth Attenborough can possibly mean by this phrase \u2018fly just for the hell of it.\u2019\n\nBusiness trips? But no one goes on business trips any more unless they absolutely have to because companies are so increasingly stingy with their travel budgets.\n\nDelingpole: Walrusgate \u2013 Attenborough Nature Doc Accused of Fake News \u2018Tragedy Porn\u2019 https://t.co/nDLuiZgnUv \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 10, 2019\n\nVisits to see family overseas? Well, sure, there\u2019s Skype but it seems pretty legit when, like me, you\u2019ve got kids living thousands of miles away to want to see them for real now and again.\n\nHolidays abroad? Some of us are old enough to remember the once widespread notion that \u2018travel broadens the mind\u2019. Is there some new rule, now, that in fact the only acceptable way of being a decent global citizen is to stay resolutely within the borders of whatever continent you inhabit?\n\nThe truth about modern air travel, surely, is that it\u2019s so totally unglamorous \u2014 the security rigmarole, the increasingly disgusting airline food, the fight for space in the overhead lockers, the protests and delays \u2014 that no one in their right mind books a flight \u2018just for the hell of it.\u2019\n\nYou only buy an air ticket once you\u2019ve exhausted all the options: when you realise, for example, that, \u2018If I don\u2019t book us a decent foreign holiday this summer my wife will divorce me.\u2019 And there\u2019s really nothing weird or extreme about this. This is how normal people think and behave because what, after all, is the point of living at this advanced stage of Western Civilisation if we can\u2019t all enjoy the fruits of increased leisure time, disposable income and aviation technology?\n\nSir David Attenborough: \u2018Shoot\u2019 Donald Trump and Leave Politics to the Experts https://t.co/hR5ytjTBLV pic.twitter.com/7RfjEEkmrW \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 1, 2016\n\nYet somewhere within those categories \u2014 Attenborough believes, in the manner of a Witchfinder General who just knows, against all evidence, that \u2018here be witches\u2019 \u2014 lurk a plethora of selfish, thoughtless, planet-destroying malefactors who are racking up their air miles for the sheer damned hell of it.\n\nThis \u2018Do I say, not do as I do\u2019 attitude is all too prevalent among our global elite. See also: Al Gore; Leo DiCaprio; the Prince of Wales, and his two chips-off-the-old-block sons William and Harry \u2014 all of whom see no problem whatsoever with flying wherever and whenever they want, even as they lecture their presumed inferiors that air travel is simply no longer acceptable an activity for the \u2018little people.\u2019\n\nThere\u2019s only one thing I find more disgusting than the arrogance and pomposity and presumption of these nauseating, Eco-Wankerati types\u2026\n\nAnd that\u2019s the fawning, largely uncritical adulation they get from the mainstream media.\n\nThat Attenborough interview, for example, appeared in the Daily Telegraph \u2013 and really should have come with a health advisory: Do not attempt to read unless you have a sick bag handy.\n\nBBC and Attenborough Accused of Fake News Misinformation on \u2018Climate Change: The Facts\u2019 https://t.co/JrtpZaSHiE \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 27, 2019\n\nWe learned, for example, that \u2018in recent years, Sir David has gained messiah status among the young.\u2019\n\nDemand for tickets to an early screening of Seven Worlds, One Planet last week officially outstripped that of Glastonbury. Earlier this year, at the aforementioned festival, Sir David made a surprise appearance on stage to promote the new series and was cheered like a rock god.\n\n(\u2018Wow! Just wow!\u2019, as the kids say. Sarcastically)\n\nWe learned that Sir David thinks his programmes are just amazing:\n\n\u201cThese programmes get huge audiences and they are not just entertainment. It\u2019s stuff that is beautiful, lovely and enriching.\u201d\n\nWe learned that one of the ways Sir David\u2019s BBC wildlife crews save the planet \u2014 resulting in a \u2018huge amount of carbon saved\u2019 \u2014 is by filming aerial shots with drones instead of helicopters.\n\nGosh, silly me. And there was I, naively thinking that the reason TV documentary crews use drones not helicopters is because it shaves two or three 0s off the aerial photography budget\u2026\n\nStrangely absent from this interview was anything that might have challenged Attenborough\u2019s status as just about the closest thing white male privilege has ever produced to rank with Nelson Mandela.\n\nNo mention, for example, of the numerous factual inaccuracies in his scaremongering claims about the environment.\n\nNo mention of the embarrassing possibility that it was his wildlife film crew \u2014 and not \u2018climate change\u2019 \u2014 which drove those walruses over a cliff to their deaths. Walrusgate, as it\u2019s known.\n\nNo questioning of the way that by jumping so wholeheartedly onto the left-leaning environmentalist bandwagon he has rendered his lavishly photographed nature documentaries all but unwatchable for that half of the world which doesn\u2019t buy into the greenie scare narrative.\n\nThis has the unfortunate \u2014 and deeply unfair \u2014 effect of making those few of us who do point this stuff out look like nasty, griping curmudgeons:\n\nWho flies \u201cjust for the hell of it\u201d? I suppose he would say going on holiday is done \u201cjust for the hell of it.\n\nBut Attenborough lies about walruses, albatross, and polar bears on the BBC, so why would we take anything he says seriously? https://t.co/vhaWb4acta \u2014 Patrick Moore (@EcoSenseNow) October 22, 2019\n\nBut we\u2019re being badly let down here.\n\nHow can it be healthy that someone like Attenborough is elevated to a position where he can spout dubious green propaganda on television across the world without ever being challenged or held to account except by a few mavericks in the blogosphere and at rebel outlets like Breitbart?\n\nHow can it be right that our mainstream media now indulges such hypocrisy? Last time I looked, the Daily Telegraph had a brilliant travel section, probably one of the most lavish and varied and, in terms of advertising, lucrative anywhere in the world.\n\nAre we to understand that now that its readers \u2014 in line with their Green God Sir David\u2019s views \u2014 are so properly appalled by all forms of \u2018unnecessary\u2019 air travel that they won\u2019t even think about going abroad any more and that thus the Telegraph\u2018s travel section will be scrapped?\n\nOr is it possible, perhaps, that our mainstream media is helping to foster perhaps the biggest lie in the entirety of our civilisation: that on the one hand consumption and travel and economic growth are things we must learn to forego because as St Greta and St David tell us man-made climate change is killing the planet; while, on the other, that consumption and travel and economic growth are really great and the things that make life worth living and help give us a better future for our children.\n\nThey can\u2019t both be simultaneously true, can they?\n\nHow depressing it is that so few of us are either honest enough to admit it or informed enough to understand it!", "description": "\"I don't think people should fly just for the hell of it,\" says veteran wildlife documentary maker Sir David Attenborough.", "authors": ["James Delingpole"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1085868490-e1571767159631-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
