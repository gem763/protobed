We\u2019re in an era, she believes, where only the strongest prevails.\n\n\u201cSo how do we get the strong to stay principled? How do we do that?\u201d Streep says. \u201cBecause the unprincipled want to march up front and take the lead. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a concern that has come to almost consume Streep, one of the most vocal critics of President Donald Trump. And it\u2019s shaping the films she\u2019s making. \u201cThe Laundromat,\u201d like her last \u201cPapers\u201d-based movie - the 2017 freedom-of-the-press thriller \u201cThe Post,\u201d about the publishing of the Pentagon Papers - is a rallying cry.\n\n\u201cMy own brain is so scrambled with exigencies and what really needs to be said, needs to be done,\u201d Streep says. \u201cAll I have are my talents to entertain and to broadcast something in some different variety of ways. It\u2019s like raising children: Anything to get the message in. What\u2019s it take?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Laundromat,\u201d which opens in theaters Friday and debuts on Netflix Oct.18, is one of the more audacious attempts to answer that question. It takes some of the densest, most complicated information and filters it into a fourth-wall-breaking farce that culminates with a rousing challenge, a call to arms.\n\nLoosely based on Jake Bernstein\u2019s \u201cSecrecy World,\u201d the splintered stories of \u201cThe Laundromat,\u201d penned by Scott Z. Burns, are derived from the 2015 data breach known as the Panama Papers. That trove of some 11.5 million documents, leaked by a whistleblower and analyzed by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, pulled the curtain back on the cloaked international network of offshore shell companies shielding billions of untaxed dollars.\n\nInspired partly by the Argentinian anthology romp \u201cWild Tales,\u201d \u201dThe Laundromat\u201d is a comical stroll through the evolution of our monetary system (thus the cavemen) that weaves together a handful of the 200,000-plus tales of the Panama Papers. Gary Goldman and Antonio Banderas play the lawyers whose firm, Mossack Fonseca, was at the center of the scandal, as well as our martini-swilling, tuxedoed narrators. Streep plays Ellen Martin, a woman trying to navigate the byzantine layers of shell companies in search of an insurer that will take responsibility for her husband\u2019s death in a tour-boat accident.\n\nSoderbergh wanted \u201cThe Laundromat\u201d to be a brisk and buoyant comedy about a dark and dirty business.\n\n\u201cEvery serious problem that we\u2019re facing right now as a species can be traced back to some form of corruption. And the trajectory of it is pretty alarming. In 2000, the top 50 financial elites owned a third of the world\u2019s wealth. Now they own a half. That\u2019s not sustainable,\u201d says Soderbergh. \u201cIt\u2019s either going to get rebuilt by agreement or it\u2019s going to get rebuilt some other way that\u2019s not as pleasant.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe historical way,\u201d chimes Streep. \u201cAll that money could be solving all the problems. Instead, it\u2019s going into yachts.\u201d\n\nSoderbergh and Streep, who recently sat for an interview the morning after the film\u2019s premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival, haven\u2019t worked together before. But it was perhaps inevitable that they would given Streep\u2019s eagerness to make movies that can catch up to the news. Soderbergh is known as one of the fastest-moving filmmakers around. Last month they shot another film together, \u201cLet Them All Talk,\u201d in just 13 days.\n\n\u201cWe have an intermediary love affair with Mike Nichols,\u201d says Streep. \u201cHe loved Steven\u2019s work and always said, \u2018You have to work with him. But not until you look at this script that I have for you.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why it took so long. It seems stupid,\u201d says Soderbergh. \u201cBut we\u2019re trying to make up for that.\u201d\n\nTo write \u201cThe Laundromat,\u201d Burns worked closely with Bernstein, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who was heavily involved in the ICIJ\u2019s reporting. A regular collaborator with Soderbergh, Burns (\u201cThe Informant!\u201d \u201dContagion\u201d) knew the director\u2019s interest would only be piqued by something formally daring. But he wondered what Bernstein would make of such a high-concept approach.\n\n\u201cI was really worried as I was writing this that he would rush in waving his hands going, \u2018What are you doing to our journalism?\u2019 He never said that. He very quickly understood what we were trying to do,\u201d said Burns alongside a nodding Bernstein. \u201cWe wanted this to mean something to every person. The fact that the world\u2019s financial system is structured this way is having an adverse effect on everybody.\u201d\n\nBurns\u2019 screenplay immediately appealed to Soderbergh. He calls \u201cThe Laundromat\u201d \u201da culmination\u201d for him that drew on all of his filmmaking experience. His fascination with money goes back, too; during the director\u2019s hiatus from Hollywood, one of the paintings he produced depicted a fantastical kind of currency.\n\nStreep responded to the film\u2019s directness.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like we\u2019re exhausted by metaphor now,\u201d Streep says. \u201cYou can start there. You can dance around it. But then you gotta go: \u2018You know what? You know what?! Pay attention! Wake up!\u2019\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to talk about \u201cThe Laundromat\u201d without discussing its ending. But suffice to say, the film ends in a stripped-down flourish that playfully deconstructs the high-concept hijinks that precede it. Part of that set up (and skip the following paragraphs if you want nothing ruined) involves a secondary performance involving Streep in the guise of a mysterious Latin woman working inside the firm.\n\nSome critics have taken issue with that element of \u201cThe Laundromat.\u201d (Vanity Fair called it a \u201cgalling unforced error\u201d given concerns about representation on screen.) When asked about it, a previously unseen publicist suggested the interview \u201cmove along.\u201d But Soderbergh and Streep said they were happy to defend those scenes. \u201cIt\u2019s going to come up,\u201d said Soderbergh. \u201cWe can talk about it.\u201d\n\nHe stressed that for the film\u2019s payoff finale, it has to be Streep\u2019s character, Ellen, in an intentionally bad disguise.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very specific trick that is necessary to set up a very important piece of narrative architecture that\u2019s going to be paid off in the final shot. She has to play that part. She has to be disguised. But there has to be something about her that you look at and go, \u2018Something\u2019s up,\u2019\u201d says Soderbergh. \u201cI knew we\u2019re probably going to get some heat for that. But in this specific comedic context in the narrative structure, this has to happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s like spy craft. Spies do all sorts of things to get information,\u201d says Streep. \u201cI think Ellen went underground. But she doesn\u2019t really fit in. It\u2019s not that good.\u201d\n\nThey each imagine \u201cThe Laundromat,\u201d in the spirit of \u201cDr. Strangelove,\u201d as an over-the-top, shape-shifting satire built for worrisome times. Streep, who famously criticized Trump in a 2017 Golden Globes speech, drawing his ire on Twitter, shudders thinking about the country\u2019s predicament.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually impossible to be an artist and not react to it,\u201d she says. \u201cEverything you do is, by default, helping or hurting.\u201d\n\nBut for her, not everything is doom and gloom. \u201cThe Laundromat\u201d may harken back to an earlier kind of social satire, but those days - the \u201860s and \u201870s - weren\u2019t all they\u2019re cracked up to be, she says.\n\n\u201cThe so-called halcyon days of \u2018The Godfather\u2019 and \u2018Taxi Driver\u2019 and everything, there was a group of people excluded from that: filmmakers of color and women. The stories were not interested in women, famously. I think \u2018Alice Doesn\u2019t Live Here Anymore\u2019 was Scorsese\u2019s only. It was not where the imagination of the people writing about movies lived and it wasn\u2019t where the filmmakers lived. You live out of your own story.\u201d\n\nThat, she says, has changed. Greta Gerwig\u2019s upcoming \u201cLittle Women,\u201d in which Streep co-stars, would never have been made in the \u201870s, she says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s better now,\u201d Streep says. \u201cEven though everything\u2019s worse now, it\u2019s better now.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Meryl Streep is describing \"the Darwinism of the moment\" and not just because her latest film, the Steven Soderbergh-directed Panama Papers satire \"The Laundromat,\" opens with cavemen.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jake Coyle"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/25/film_review_-_the_laundromat_98188_c0-108-2592-1619_s1770x1032.jpg?60322eb29ebbc144e72b561898248eff0584e308", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
