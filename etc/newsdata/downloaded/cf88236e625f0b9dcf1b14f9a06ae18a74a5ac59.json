We both love the variety of creativity and technicality involved in our work.\u201d\n\nWith nearly 200 client orders undertaken annually, anyone would think the designers now employ an army of staff to keep up. Not so. No matter if it\u2019s a $125,000 commission for a wedding dress in the Middle East or fielding calls from the world\u2019s most powerful female musicians to submit designs for their upcoming tour costumes, it is still just the two of them at the helm of all hands-on operations \u2013 with high stress and little sleep, naturally.\n\n\u201cWe started J\u2019Aton with so many clients before we had actually opened the doors,\u201d Luppino explains. \u201cWe worked day and night without taking a breath and the business became bigger than us.\u201d The brand\u2019s rapid growth has only continued to escalate since then, largely due to the designers dressing some of the world\u2019s most influential women: Kim Kardashian West, Jennifer Lopez, Beyonc\u00e9, Nicole Kidman, Kylie Minogue and Jessica Alba, to name just a few.\n\n\u201cCelebrities have a power that is second to none; J\u2019Aton Couture exists today because of celebrity support,\u201d Pittorino says. \u201cBut these celebrities and their stylists often think we\u2019re much bigger than what we are in terms of our business operations. They think that coming to us is like going to one of the big European fashion houses that employ thousands of staff and have financial backers.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re looking for the right investor, who appreciates quality and upholds our commitment to integrity in every aspect of the business. \u2014 Anthony Pittorino, J'Aton Couture\n\nOver the past two decades, J\u2019Aton Couture has struggled to find the right investor to expand the brand from its humble Melbourne origins into a revered force on the global stage. The designers say this is because Australians don\u2019t truly understand the value of couture as an art form that must be nurtured. In an ideal world, an investor would support the designers in establishing an atelier in Paris or Milan, and a showroom in New York, the epicentre of operations for fashion and celebrity culture. Which raises the question: is Australia the right market for their work?\n\nWhile there is seemingly no shortage of local and international investors intrigued by the J\u2019Aton universe, the proposed business model of having the garments manufactured at a cheaper cost in India or China would breach the brand\u2019s integrity.\n\n\u201cWe could be rich tomorrow \u2013 a huge global brand \u2013 if we just said yes to unethical practices. We have millionaire and billionaire investors lined up, but we\u2019re not interested,\u201d Pittorino asserts. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for the right investor, who appreciates quality and upholds our commitment to integrity in every aspect of the business, especially the ethical treatment of workers, which the industry is renowned for mistreating.\u201d\n\nEven to the undiscerning eye, a mere glance at a J\u2019Aton creation would suggest it ought to be displayed behind glass in a Florentine museum. The crafting of a single gown takes more than 200 hours, with the designers doing all the fitting, cutting, sewing and hand-embellishing themselves. Each client becomes the muse-like subject of her own portrait, a vision of femininity brought to life by two masters of their craft.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKylie Minogue in J'Aton Couture at the 2015 Qantas Australia Day Gala Dinner in London.

Luppino and Pittorino were handcrafting works of \u201cwearable art\u201d in Australia long before the notion exploded into public consciousness through global exposure at events such as the Met Gala. To this day, a J\u2019Aton creation ignites the imagination with a feast of sensory cues seamlessly mingled to evoke everything from a still-life nude portrait to a plate of blushing prosciutto slices. It takes a deep understanding of fashion\u2019s relationship to the related discourses of fine art, food, music and film to truly appreciate a J\u2019Aton creation.\n\nAmid an archive of A-list commissions that leaves no bead or bodice unturned, the designers recall a gown created in 2007 for burlesque star Dita Von Teese as one of their most memorable. It was inspired by baroque artist Elisabetta Sirani and her painting Portia Wounding Her Thigh (1664), a work they perceived to have embodied the power of Von Teese\u2019s femininity, along with her pain after splitting with then husband Marilyn Manson.\n\n\"We play it safe most of the time\u201d: Jacob Luppino (left) and Anthony Pittorino share a sofa with a model in another of their dresses. Simon Schluter\n\n\u201cIt was a living canvas dedicated to Dita\u2019s evolving love story, tattooed with love quotes and hidden poems under layers of gathered tulle,\u201d says Pittorino. \u201cWe wanted to empower and inspire her through the garment.\u201d\n\nWith few women finding themselves in the fortunate position of personally experiencing the J\u2019Aton dream, social media has been key in disseminating the designers\u2019 work to a besotted fan base across the world. If you can\u2019t wear a J\u2019Aton gown, the next best thing is to fantasise about wearing one, via images on Instagram. When a bride or celebrity wears one of Luppino and Pittorino\u2019s creations, it takes mere moments for pictures to end up on thousands of \u201cinspo\u201d accounts. While this hype has obviously been integral in achieving global exposure for the brand, it has come with significant challenges.\n\n\u201cSocial media exposed us to a raft of designers out there reproducing our work in Third World countries and becoming filthy rich on our brand DNA. Today, designers are a click away from inspiration. Or is it interpretation?\u201d he asks, wryly. \u201cAny dress we do, someone on the other side of the world is now willing to copy it and charge half the price. We are losing at least $5000 to $10,000 a dress. That\u2019s a lot of money.\u201d\n\nWith bridal orders and private commissions making up most of the J\u2019Aton clientele, the duo reflect upon an element of constraint on their creativity in always ensuring a brief is satisfied. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe we have truly created pieces of wearable art in our garments,\u201d Luppino says. \u201cWe fear we will be perceived as too ethnic, or that our clients will be ridiculed, so we play it safe most of the time.\u201d\n\nFor two designers who have rarely given interviews in nearly three decades of working in the industry, this is a remarkable admission. A sense of mystery surrounds J\u2019Aton; it\u2019s an aura few Australian designers have been able to cultivate, and might even be perceived as a modern manifestation of the \u201cmyth of the artist\u201d fantasy. There is a sense that, given the right timing, the right projects and perhaps the right investor, the full grandeur of J\u2019Aton Couture would be revealed to the world.\n\nThe heritage issue of LUXURY is out on Friday, September 6 inside The Australian Financial Review.
