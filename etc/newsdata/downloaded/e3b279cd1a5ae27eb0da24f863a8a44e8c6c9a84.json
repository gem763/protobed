Unfortunately, quantities were extremely limited, leading to instances of theft, violence and huge unruly crowds. Police were dispatched to multiple outlets.\n\nFights broke out at @McDonalds over the limited supply of #szechuansauce Police had to intervene at several locations! #RickandMorty pic.twitter.com/KEpqhtl5d8 \u2014 Patriot Prayer'ish ????

Here's the full recipe, courtesy of Xeropoint:\n\nMince 6 cloves of Garlic and sweat (heat them up in a skillet)\n\nadd 4 tablespoons Balsamic Vinegar\n\nadd soy sauce to taste (DO NOT USE LOW SODIUM SAUCE)\n\nadd 2 tablespoon Plum Sake (Drink additional 3oz Plum Sake)\n\nReduce sauce slightly (Drink additional 1.5oz Plum Sake)\n\n3 1/2 tablespoons cock sauce (Sriracha)\n\nadd 2 tablespoon brown sugar\n\nRed pepper flakes to taste\n\nMinced Ginger to taste\n\nConsume remaining Plum Sake Simmer that shit for a solid 5 minutes, stirring pretty much constantly. The brown sugar helps it keep the proper consistency, so it's important to use. Play around with the recipe to your taste. Might want more or less balsamic vinegar. Might want more or more Plum Sake. I'd definitely recommend you make it several times to figure out your own flavour.\n\nOur fast food correspondent in the US, Claire Lower, made a batch and conducted a taste test with 10 Chicken McNuggets. Here are the results:\n\nThe verdict?\n\n\"It was very good,\" she said. \"It was sweet, salty and tangy, with a good bit of heat. It did not, however, seem like a sauce McDonald's would have put out, as it tasted too much like food.\"\n\nTo give the sauce a more familiar \"factory\" flavour, Claire took a cue from this video from Binging with Babish, and added a tub each of McDonald's Sweet & Sour and BBQ, plus a little extra soy and sriracha.\n\n\"Now I had a sauce that tasted like it belonged under the golden arches,\" Claire explains. \"It was still sweet, sour, salty and spicy, but everything had been muted a bit by all the corn syrup, which made it a much better mate for the bland meat product that is the McNugget.\"\n\nToo easy! Just be sure to close any kitchen windows prior to making - otherwise some rabid Rick and Morty fans might break down your door and rob you.\n\nAdditional reporting by Claire Lower.", "description": "It's no secret that Rick and Morty fans are obsessed with McDonald's \"Szechuan Sauce\", a limited edition Mcnugget dipping sauce that came out in 1998 to promote the Disney film Mulan.
