Devin Nunes (R-CA) noted the procedure employed by House Democrats in its so-called impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump is proceeding unlike impeachment efforts in the past and with rules.\n\nThat according to the California Republican does not allow for a fair process for both sides.\n\nPartial transcript as follows:\n\nCARLSON: Congressman, thanks so much for coming on. So if I\u2019m understanding this correctly, the White House is saying once you make it official, we will cooperate, but not until then.\n\nNUNES: Well, the House Intelligence Committee has become like this secretive impeachment committee but with no rules. And so I don\u2019t blame the White House for saying, look, we\u2019ll just see you in court. We\u2019re not going to \u2014 we\u2019re not going to provide you any witnesses. We\u2019re not going to provide you any documents and unless the House of Representatives votes, like has been the tradition, if not, you can hold us in contempt and we\u2019ll see you in court in a matter of months, maybe important months.\n\nCARLSON: But now as a procedural matter, is it true or is it not? I mean, you\u2019re the sitting member, that the House in order to have an impeachment you have to have a vote, right? Leadership can\u2019t just say there\u2019s an impeachment, there has to be a vote.\n\nNUNES: Right? You can\u2019t \u2014 I mean, traditionally, we don\u2019t \u2014 the House makes its own rules. OK. So one could argue that they\u2019re just making up the rules as they go along. But we do have tradition. Right? And you have precedents. And it\u2019s relatively recent, right? You had the impeachment of Bill Clinton, and the impeachment of Richard Nixon.\n\nSo if you\u2019re really going to truly get this through the House, open up an investigation, pass it, vote to impeach a President, send it to the Senate for trial, you have to have a system of government where you have something that is fair, where both sides can actually go out and gather evidence.\n\nCARLSON: Right.\n\nNUNES: And that\u2019s what doesn\u2019t exist today and I think the White House has a very good point, because as someone who\u2019s been in all these meetings, I can tell you, I think it was described today as a kangaroo court and that\u2019s probably being nice.\n\nCARLSON: Yes, if you\u2019re going to have an impeachment, let\u2019s have a vote. You know, it\u2019s a democracy. We vote on things here, like we always used to.", "description": "Tuesday on Fox News Channel's \"Tucker Carlson Tonight,\" House Intelligence Committee ranking Republican Rep.
