He\u2019s also worried about the economic and political ramifications of embroiling the United States in a war with Iran, which stands accused of the recent attack on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe president has hinted publicly at those concerns in recent days, saying on Monday afternoon, \u201cDo I want war? I don\u2019t want war with anybody. I\u2019m somebody that would like not to have war,\u201d while also warning, \u201cWe\u2019re prepared more than anybody.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Trump has flashes of private regret about his only new military intervention in the region: airstrikes against Bashar Assad\u2019s government in Syria. Trump has told confidants that he wishes those 2017 and 2018 attacks, which targeted Syrian facilities after the Assad regime\u2019s use of chemical weapons, had inflicted more damage.\n\n\u201cHe heard a lot of criticism about it from multiple sources,\u201d said a person close to the White House. One former U.S. official familiar with Middle Eastern policy said Trump \u201cwishes he\u2019d put a missile in Assad\u2019s palace.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt best, they were an inconvenience for the regime, but they had no impact on the trajectory of the conflict,\u201d Wa\u2019el Alzayat, a former State Department official who dealt with Syria, said of the U.S. airstrikes.\n\nThe White House declined to comment on the president\u2019s internal deliberations. But when it comes to Iran, Trump is consulting a wide range of inputs.\n\nOver the past 10 days, about a dozen outside advisers have weighed in with him on Iran, including Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who has tried to mediate between the U.S. and Tehran; Ric Grenell, the U.S. ambassador to Germany; anti-interventionist Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.); and Freedom Caucus stalwart Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), according to a Washington Republican familiar with the president\u2019s conversations.\n\nMany \u2014 but not all \u2014 of those voices are urging Trump to show restraint, this person said.\n\nOthers are recommending that the U.S. be part of some kind of a multilateral response in the Middle East to the alleged Iranian attack, possibly in concert with Saudi Arabia.\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s natural inclination is not to attack Iran, pressure is building for the U.S. and Trump to respond, said another person close to the White House.\n\nTrump was publicly and privately critical of former national security adviser John Bolton, who often urged more aggressive action than the president was willing to take. Bolton, who was fired last week, \u201cwas pushing us into a war with Iran, so I think he felt like he was stopping that\u201d and Trump has wanted more of \u201ca pathway towards peace,\u201d according to one of the people close to the White House.\n\nBut Trump still has an NSC team that \u201cis incredibly hawkish, hawkish beyond any logical reason\u201d on Iran, said the former U.S. official. \u201cThey used to refer to Mattis as being far too restrained on Iran,\u201d this person said, referring to former Secretary of Defense James Mattis, \u201ceven though Mattis is a guy who is as hawkish as a guy than anybody.\u201d\n\nFor now, Trump himself is talking tough but not promising action. \u201cRemember when Iran shot down a drone, saying knowingly that it was in their \u2018airspace\u2019 when, in fact, it was nowhere close. They stuck strongly to that story knowing that it was a very big lie. Now they say that they had nothing to do with the attack on Saudi Arabia. We\u2019ll see?\u201d he tweeted Monday.\n\n\u201cHe likes to talk a big game and he likes the kind of policies that look tough, but when those policies meet the real world, he\u2019s very reluctant to follow through,\u201d the former U.S. official said.\n\nOn Monday, the White House had a so-called principals meeting of top national security officials to discuss options the administration\u2019s options.\n\nTrump emerged from the meeting with no discernible shift in posture, telling reporters, \u201cWe have military power the likes of which the world has never seen. I\u2019m not concerned at all. I\u2019d like to avoid it.\u201d\n\nAnd, in a further suggestion that military action was not imminent, he announced that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo would be headed to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates this week, where he is expected to discuss ways to counter Iran.\n\nOne option could be to gather up evidence of Iranian involvement in the attack and for the U.S. and/or Saudi Arabia to request an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council to present the evidence and point the finger at the Iranians, said a person close to the White House.\n\nOther options could include cyberstrikes, like the ones the president authorized after Iran\u2019s alleged attacks on oil tankers earlier this year, or further economic sanctions.\n\nBut the attacks in Saudi Arabia, at least for now, have halted the president\u2019s efforts to bring Iran to the negotiating table.\n\nWhile there had been some speculation that Trump would meet with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in New York next week on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, that\u2019s now unlikely. Trump this week denied he had ever sought to enter talks with Iran without preconditions \u2014 even though he and Pompeo had previously said exactly that.\n\n\u201cHe thinks that somehow if there\u2019s a meeting that magically they\u2019re going to change,\u201d said another person close to the White House.\n\nIn June, Trump was poised to strike Iran in retaliation for taking out a U.S. drone but called off the strike at the last minute after talking to Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who urged caution.\n\nThe president \u201cwas very happy at the time\u201d that he didn\u2019t carry out the attack and bragged about his restraint, according to another person close to the president.\n\nAt the time, the administration\u2019s internal position was that only an American casualty could prompt military retaliation. But Iran has arguably become more emboldened since then, taking more steps to restart its nuclear program.\n\n\u201cThe president stands by his decision to not retaliate against the Iran attack on a U.S. drone because of the potential loss of life,\u201d said one of the people close to the White House. \u201cHis concern was that Iran would escalate attacks on other interests in the region. The president has shown great restraint, but advisers have encouraged some action.\u201d\n\nForeign diplomats who spoke with Politico on Tuesday said they perceived caution in Trump\u2019s handling of Iran, not least because of 2020 campaign considerations.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s somebody who wants to show U.S. strength,\u201d a European diplomat said. \u201cAt the same time, the elections are approaching and the last thing he can wish is to draw the U.S. into a protracted conflict.\u201d\n\nYet Trump\u2019s constant shifting \u2014 which he\u2019s described as a negotiating tactic in the past \u2013 can undermine not only his credibility but also that of his aides, noted Heather Hurlburt, an analyst with New America. Pompeo, for example, quickly and explicitly blamed Tehran for the Saudi attack, while Trump has yet to explicitly finger Iran.\n\nBut if investigators determine Tehran is the culprit, others said, Trump may need to act \u2014 or at least help the Saudis do so.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a little concerned that he\u2019ll go full Trumpian and greenlight a Saudi retaliation,\u201d said Mark Dubowitz, head of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a think tank that advocates a hard line against Iran. Dubowitz said such a \u201cworst case scenario\u201d could lead Riyadh to act with impunity if Trump kept the U.S. out of the fray, and that could prompt a serious Iranian retaliation that leads to an escalating cycle of violence.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m of the view, based on decades of [Iranian] revolutionary response to American power, that if the United States uses military power, the regime is likely to back down, not escalate. If the Saudis use military power, the regime is likely to escalate,\u201d Dubowitz said.\n\nAs for Iran, said Trita Parsi, executive vice president of the newly formed Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei\u2019s latest comments suggest there is still room for dialogue, if not negotiations.\n\nThe distinction matters, he said, because Iran may be looking for political room to maneuver.\n\n\u201cIf they show themselves too weak, too afraid of an American response, their calculation is it will be more likely that Trump will take military action,\u201d Parsi said. \u201cIt\u2019s immensely risky, but it has to be weighed against the risk of Iran sitting there watching Trump cost-free crushing Iran\u2019s economy.\u201d", "description": "Confidants say the U.S. president may talk tough, but he\u2019s deeply reluctant to drag the United States into a fresh war in the Middle East.", "authors": ["Daniel Lippman", "Nahal Toosi", "Rosa Prince", "Quint Forgey"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1168695293-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
