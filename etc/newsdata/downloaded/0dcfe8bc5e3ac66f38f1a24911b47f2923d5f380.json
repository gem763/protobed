Sadly, so too do this Manchester United team.\n\nAnother day, another depressing demonstration of where United stand these days.\n\nThursday night football \u2013 and the early kick-off at that \u2013 in a small, cramped stadium in the one of the backwaters of European football.\n\nThe travelling Red Devils watched on, patiently waiting for their team to make the breakthrough in Holland\n\nFormer manager Louis van Gaal was watching on from the directors' box at the ADO Stadium on Thursday evening\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer was quickly out onto the touchline as the game begun, urging his players to press high from the off\n\nMATCH FACTS AZ ALKMAAR (4-3-3): Bizot 6.5; Sugawara 6, Vlaar 6.5, Wuytens 6, Wijndal 6; Midtsjo 6.5, De Wit 6.5 (Hatzidiakos 87), Koopmeiners 7.5; Stengs 7, Boadu 6.5, Idrissi 8.

Subs not used: Romero, Maguire, Tuanzebe, Chong. Booked: Dalot Ref: Gediminas Mazeika 5\n\nOne that had United playing on a crude artificial surface that Solskjaer described as one of the worst he has seen.\n\nHe was right about that. The ball bounced ridiculously high and ran away from any player unfortunate enough not to receive an accurate pass. Alkmaar coped with it very well. United did not.\n\nIf that took us back nearly 40 years to the days when they did away with grass at the likes of QPR, Preston and Luton, then so do United at the moment; back to a time when this great club were also-rans in the title race and relative non-entities in Europe.\n\n'A bog standard team,' Michael Owen described them on BT Sport on Thursday night and that's being polite.\n\nUnited's start in the league has been there worst for 30 years following Monday's insipid draw with Arsenal.\n\nIn the Europa League, they have kicked off Group L with a laboured win over Astana, the champions of Kazakhstan, and now this \u2013 a wretched stalemate against AZ Alkmaar in The Hague.\n\nThere were no goals, no shots on goal from United, and very little of note aside from three penalty appeals in the second half.\n\nYes, Solskjaer made eight changes from the Arsenal game and gave youth a chance again, handing a full debut to Brandon Williams at left-back in a line-up that also included teenagers Mason Greenwood and Angel Gomes.\n\nThe teams lined up inside the 15,000 capacity stadium, which lies in the eastern area of The Hague\n\nA huge tifo was unfurled by the home supporters, urging their side to make a mark in this season's Europa League competition\n\nThere were no shots on goal from Solskjaer's United, and nothing of any note aside from penalty appeals at either end.\n\nBut right now the green shoots of recovery he talks about appear as genuine as the plastic pitch here at the ADO Stadium.\n\nIt leaves the Norwegian without an away win 10 games since the stunning comeback against Paris Saint-Germain in March, a mere memory that could not feel more different to what we witnessed here.\n\n'Ooh, aah, Cantona' chanted the small bank of away fans for a prolonged period in the first half, but even he would struggle to inject some life into this United team.\n\nSolskjaer's side failed to lay a glove on average opponents who would have been the more worthy winners based on the balance of play and chances created.\n\nIndeed, after two instantly forgettable games in this competition, United are rather fortunate to have four points.\n\nSo, what of those penalty appeals?\n\nUnited had the stronger of the three when substitute Marcus Rashford turned back inside Stijn Wuytens and was clipped by the Alkmaar defender 10 minutes from time.\n\nLithuanian referee Gediminas Mazeika saw it differently and waved play on after exchanging quizzical looks with his assistant. There was no VAR to help United's cause on this occasion.\n\nYukinari Sugawara of AZ Alkmaar goes close to scoring in the second half, with a powerful volleyed effort on goal\n\nBrandon Williams of Manchester United (left) and Dani de Wit of AZ Alkmaar battle for possession of the ball\n\nThe pair then clashed on the field following a tussle in trying to win the ball for their side\n\n'I'm fed up of talking about penalties we should had, but that's a penalty 101 times out of 100,' said Solskjaer.\n\n'The linesman can look straight at the tackle. He wipes his foot but unfortunately for us we didn't get it.\n\n'There's no point me complaining but these decisions will turn out way.'\n\nAlkmaar had two appeals of their own, however. Fred, lamentably bad again, could easily have been penalised for bringing down Dani De Wit after placing both hands on him, and Williams then appeared to handle a cross from Oussama Idrissa.\n\nSolskjaer compared it to the penalty United were denied against Arsenal on Monday night when Sokratis handled in the box.\n\n'Handball is always a discussion, but if you look at Arsenal one we should have had on Monday,' argued the United boss. 'You have so much time to move your hand out of the way.'\n\nIt would certainly have been harsh for United to snatch victory so late in the game after playing as poorly as this.\n\n'It's Time to Shine' proclaimed a banner before kick-off draped across the section allocated to the Dutch fans in the Den Haag stadium that has been Alkmaar's home since the roof of a strand collapsed at their ground in August, and their players took that message on board more than United.\n\nThe nearest they came to a shot on target was in the first half when Greenwood had a chance to shoot in front of goal.\n\nNo VAR, but Alkmaar still had Ron Vlaar, the former Aston Villa man who is still going strong at the age of 34. He got a block on Greenwood's effort and United hardly threatened Marco Bizot's goal again.\n\nJesse Lingard added to United's injury concerns after coming on as a substitute before swiftly leaving, holding his hamstring\n\nManchester United duo Angel Gomes (left) and Marcos Rojo look dejected at the end of the match on Thursday night\n\nWilliams of Manchester United in action with Fredrik Midtsjo of AZ Alkmaar during the tight contest in Holland\n\nDavid de Gea was significantly busier at the other end of the pitch after he was a surprising inclusion in this competition ahead of Sergio Romero.\n\nThe Spaniard was beaten in the 10th minute when Myron Boadu flicked in Fredrik Midtsjo's cross but, fortunately for United, the officials got that one right and ruled it out for offside.\n\nAfter that, De Gea made some good saves, notably getting down smartly at his near post to turn away a fierce drive from the impressive Idrissa in the first half and stopping another goalbound effort from Owen Wijndal in the second.\n\nThe Dutch side were clearly more comfortable on the plastic surface and grew in confidence after realising \u2013 like most opponents these days \u2013 that there is little to fear from this United.\n\nTo compound Solskjaer's problems, substitute Jesse Lingard limped off towards the end clutching his right hamstring, leaving United to finish the game with 10 men.\n\nCredit to Solskjaer, he continues to stay positive despite the statistics mounting up against his team. United have now scored just seven goals in nine games since beating Chelsea on the opening day of the season.\n\n'Of course, you create chances and score goals,' he acknowledged. 'There's no point me saying, they know themselves. But it's a good point away from home on a difficult surface.'", "description": "CHRIS WHEELER IN HOLLAND: Just\u00a0as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer feared, the plastic pitch here in Holland felt like a throwback to the 1980s.
