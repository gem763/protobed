The cash-rich, equities-focused HKEX would gain an edge in fixed-income trading, but in a world where algos and bots handle much of the action, the bidder would do better to take a page from LSE\u2019s playbook and look for bigger data sources.\n\nHong Kong Exchanges calls its plan to create an Asian-European giant that\u2019s open 18 hours a day a \"vote of confidence in London and the United Kingdom\u2019s future role as a global financial center\u201d at a time that Brexit paralysis is clouding the outlook. The move also shows belief that, despite the recent protests, Hong Kong can still produce world-stage firms.\n\nThe more than 300-year-old London exchange has a lot going for it, including fixed-income heft and the FTSE Russell portfolio of index benchmarks used by institutional investors. The offer values LSE shares at 8,361 pence (about $103), around 42 times 2019 earnings, according to Citigroup Inc. analysts, much higher than the London bourse\u2019s historical average price-earnings multiple of 22 times.\n\nBut Hong Kong Exchanges\u2019 offer would scupper LSE\u2019s own bid for data provider Refinitiv, a deal that LSE shareholders like as shown by its soaring share price. They, and politics, may stand in HKEX\u2019s way. U.K. regulators will have a tough time accepting the takeover of a British institution by a Hong Kong company. Given the impact to global financial markets and the popularity among exchange-traded funds of the FTSE Russell indexes, U.S. regulators may also weigh in.\n\nHKEX Chief Executive Charles Li can argue that his firm is already a global company, having acquired the London Metal Exchange in 2012, but it remains a foundation stone of Hong Kong. The city\u2019s government owns just 5.9% but appoints the majority of the directors.\n\nExchange mergers are sensitive propositions anywhere. The LSE has been a frequent target and was in the sights of Germany\u2019s Deutsche Boerse AG three years ago until Brussels blocked the deal. In the Asia-Pacific region, Singapore Exchange Ltd.\u2019s 2011 bid for ASX Ltd. was rejected by Australian regulators on national-interest concerns.\n\nThere are also questions over HKEX\u2019s deal-making prowess. HKEX acquired the LME, the world\u2019s biggest venue for trading base metals like aluminum, at the top of the commodities cycle. It promised LME members that it would have a warehouse in China from which to access the country\u2019s massive metals market. Seven years later and it doesn\u2019t, as Chinese authorities seek to protect homegrown commodities entities, including the Shanghai Futures Exchange and the Dalian Commodities Exchange.\n\nThere is no doubt that HKEX needs to diversify. Volumes on the exchange have slumped and it has fallen off its perch as the world\u2019s top IPO venue last year.\n\nStock exchange businesses reliant on volatile volumes are increasingly passe in a world of computerized trading. With little overlap with LSE, Hong Kong Exchanges can\u2019t count on simply cutting costs. The key to growth for exchanges is in the data that fixed-income, currency, and equities traders need and the analytical tools that deliver it to them. That\u2019s why LSE has pursued Refinitiv.\n\nHKEX has depended on a strategy of being the gateway to China through its stock and bond trading links. The value of that role is diminishing as the country opens direct access to markets, removing quotas Tuesday on purchases by global funds.\n\nWanting to go beyond Hong Kong to create a global powerhouse is understandable. Doing so with another market grappling with its own political crisis and uncertain future post-Brexit is less so. Li likened the Hong Kong exchange\u2019s unsolicited takeover of LSE to a \u201ccorporate Romeo and Juliet.\u201dHe missed the point on how that story ended.", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The audacious\u00a0bid by Hong Kong\u2019s stock exchange for its London rival is likely to fail \u2013\u00a0and that\u2019s no bad thing.Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd.\u2019s\u00a0unexpected $36.6 billion offer\u00a0for\u00a0London Stock Exchange Group Plc would create one of the\u00a0world\u2019s largest trading hubs.\u00a0The cash-rich", "authors": ["Nisha Gopalan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MgcOYWXvO1ew1XC6emrK7Q--~B/aD04MjY7dz0xMjk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_opinion_268/3ffb0b7e94f98d596e2e0f76cc2020c4", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
