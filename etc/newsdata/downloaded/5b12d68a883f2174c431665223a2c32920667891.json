Those headed for a commission are more likely to enter the ranks through ROTC programs or Annapolis.\n\nBut one day in 2009, a rare prospect did walk in: Buttigieg, Peter, 27-year-old Harvard grad. Polyglot Rhodes scholar. McKinsey management consultant. Nordic poetry fan. Hometown boy.\n\nA decade later, Buttigieg, P., is better known as South Bend\u2019s Mayor Pete, a first-name-only pol thanks to his tongue-twister surname (BOOT-edge-edge). Mayor Pete is finishing his second term as he campaigns for the Democratic presidential nomination. He remains one of the few luminaries to start military service at this modest recruiting outpost.\n\n\u201cWe got Mayor Pete and we had an admiral once \u2014 that\u2019s pretty much it,\u201d said Zach Blakeman, the recruiter on duty on a recent summer day, sitting at a desk stacked with the high school diplomas of his more typical enlistees. Because of his pedigree, Buttigieg glided straight into the Navy Reserve\u2019s direct-commission officers program, bypassing the more time-consuming training route of other branches.\n\n\u201cWe can tell within two hours whether you\u2019re qualified or not,\u201d Blakeman said.\n\nIt took Buttigieg far longer to figure that out.\n\nThe moment he stepped up on that white Health O Meter scale was a pivot point for him personally and politically. As he was weighed and measured, a process began that would not only put him in potential danger but force him to confront a lifelong conflict at the center of his identity \u2014 his sexuality. It would allow him to yield to a revered family calling of military service. And, just months before he launched a career in electoral politics, it would let him add a valuable new credential to his r\u00e9sum\u00e9: veteran.\n\nToday, in a crowded field, Buttigieg is one of only four Democratic candidates with experience in uniform. He would be the first presidential candidate with overseas military service elected in three decades. And he has already foreshadowed how he could wield his dog tags in a race against President Trump, who used medical deferments to avoid service in Vietnam. \u201cI was packing my bags for Afghanistan while he was working on Season 7 of \u2018The Apprentice,\u2019 \u201d he said in May.\n\nI knew that war had touched my country and that I could wind up willingly or unwillingly a part of it. Pete Buttigieg\n\nSitting down with a recruiter came after years of uncertainty about his willingness to join a war on terrorism that began one September morning in 2001 as he overslept in his Harvard dorm. He was already a student of history and Arabic, and the 9/11 attacks instantly made the possibility of fighting feel more personal, Buttigieg said in an interview.\n\n\u201cI knew that war had touched my country and that I could wind up willingly or unwillingly a part of it,\u201d he said in his campaign office overlooking the low-rise cement-scape of downtown South Bend.\n\nStill, he took no part in the conflict as he climbed ever-higher ivory towers in Massachusetts and England, as the war in Afghanistan widened to include another in Iraq, as he became increasingly active in Democratic politics and increasingly opposed to the national security policies of President George W. Bush.\n\nIt was only after Barack Obama was elected, and just months before Buttigieg would launch his own political career, that he finally walked into the recruiting office.\n\nOnly then did he decide to join a conflict that six years earlier he had denounced from the stage of an antiwar rally.\n\n\n\nDemonstrators at an antiwar rally at Harvard University in March 2003. (William B. Plowman/Getty Images)\n\n\u2018Connected to the military\u2019\n\nIt was a gray March day in 2003, a week before the invasion of Iraq, and the \u201cEmergency Anti-War Rally\u201d had attracted about 350 people to the courtyard in front of Harvard\u2019s ziggurat-like Science Center.\n\nSophomore Jesse Stellato was the first speaker. Junior Pete Buttigieg followed him, speaking without notes on behalf of the campus Democrats and eliciting a roar from the gathering.\n\n\u201cHe was brilliant,\u201d said Stellato, now a lawyer in London. \u201cThe crowd was immediately attracted to him.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, compared to Stellato, a passionate opponent of the invasion who would go on to write a book about antiwar rhetoric, Buttigieg made a more nuanced case. On a campus that had largely banned ROTC units since the 1960s, Buttigieg pointed to the spire of Harvard\u2019s Memorial Church \u2014 where the names of fallen alumni are carved in marble \u2014 and celebrated the warriors as he decried the war.\n\n\u201cThey remind us of a time when we had to take up arms against another nation, and there may be a day we have to again,\u201d Buttigieg said, according to an account of the rally in the Harvard Crimson. \u201cBut that day isn\u2019t today.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe seemed more like a partisan than a pacifist,\u201d Stellato said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure he would have been there if the Democrats hadn\u2019t come out against the invasion.\u201d\n\n\n\nButtigieg's great uncle Russell Montgomery was an Army Air Corps captain. (Anne Montgomery)\n\nIn fact, war-fighting had long been part of Buttigieg\u2019s family story. His great uncle was an Army Air Corps captain killed in a 1941 crash. Pete idolized the oil portrait of Uncle Russell that still hangs in his mother\u2019s South Bend living room. He would pore over the flier\u2019s logbook and fantasize about becoming a pilot himself.\n\nHis grandfather had been a career Army officer, and he remembers shopping trips with his grandmother to the Fort Bliss PX. He loved the crisp salute that gate guards would snap at her Caprice Classic. He was the brainy son of two Notre Dame professors, but the armed forces held an allure.\n\n\u201cAs a kid, I had this sense of being connected to the military,\u201d Buttigieg said.\n\nBut the connection faded as his academic talents propelled him through Harvard and then Oxford.\n\nAfter graduation, he continued to work in party politics, campaigning in Arizona for John F. Kerry\u2019s 2004 presidential bid. When Kerry lost, Buttigieg\u2019s boss, future assistant defense secretary Doug Wilson, invited him to Washington.\n\n\u201cI think he was interested in coming back with me because he saw this as an opportunity to learn about foreign policy and international affairs,\u201d said Wilson, who was working for former defense secretary William Cohen at the time. Wilson is now an adviser to the Buttigieg campaign.\n\nButtigieg quickly fell in with Democrats who were supportive of military power even as they condemned the way it was wielded by the Bush White House. They called themselves the Truman National Security Project.\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t a lot of space in the country then to say, \u2018I believe in the military and I believe some wars are necessary and yet I believe the Iraq War was a huge blunder,\u2019 \u201d said Rachel Kleinfeld, a Truman Project founder. \u201cPete was surrounded by a lot of progressives who had served.\u201d\n\nOne was Andrew Person, a onetime staffer for then-Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.) who had entered northern Iraq with the 173rd Airborne in 2003 and was deployed to Afghanistan in 2005. He wasn\u2019t surprised when Buttigieg eventually signed up for \u201cBush\u2019s war.\u201d\n\n\u201cI objected to [the Iraq War] from the beginning,\u201d said Person, now a lawyer in Missoula. \u201cBut I still knew that my job was to parachute in and take that airfield.\u201d\n\nThere wasn\u2019t a lot of space in the country then to say, \u2018I believe in the military and I believe some wars are necessary and yet I believe the Iraq War was a huge blunder.\u2019 Rachel Kleinfeld, a Truman Project founder\n\nButtigieg finished his degree in economics at Oxford in 2007 and moved to the Chicago office of McKinsey & Co. For the next year, the consulting gig that would make him an expert in grocery pricing also gave him his first taste of a war zone. Buttigieg visited Iraq and Afghanistan as part of U.S. government-funded projects to stimulate private-sector development in countries still engulfed in violence.\n\nA private security guard leading his small team down the bomb-scarred highway from the airport tapped his pistol and told the group: \u201cIf I ever have to touch this thing, you\u2019re f---ed,\u201d Buttigieg recalled with a smile, his language slipping into troop-talk.\n\nHe knew it was a joke meant to frighten the greenhorns. But it made the danger real. It was few months later that he began to entertain his first thoughts of becoming a reserve officer.\n\nIn his memoir, he recalls door-knocking for the 2008 Obama campaign in Iowa, meeting veterans and recent recruits in the January cold, almost all younger and less advantaged than he was. One night at dinner, he and two friends could name only a few of their fellow Harvard graduates who had joined the military.\n\nButtigieg did remember one classmate who had entered the Navy Reserve his senior year, and his own interest increasingly turned that way.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d studied Arabic and thought intelligence seemed like a good fit,\u201d he said (although the recruiter actually listed his Harvard minor as \u201cAerobics\u201d).\n\nBut he still had reservations about joining under Bush.\n\n\u201cYour service has to be neutral to politics, but you are making a choice when you join the military under a certain president,\u201d he said.\n\nA year later, Obama became the commander in chief.\n\n\n\nThe Obamas in Chicago on election night in 2008. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cWe were grabbing a beer and he was like, \u2018By the way, I joined the Navy,\u2019 \u201d recalled Eric Lesser, a friend from Harvard and now a Massachusetts state senator. \u201cI was concerned about it. Things were not going well in Afghanistan.\u201d\n\nHis mother supported her only child\u2019s embrace of the family military tradition. She also worried about getting that knock on the door, as her grandmother had after her Uncle Russell\u2019s plane had gone down.\n\n\u201cShe was proud of that gold star,\u201d Anne Montgomery, 74, said in an interview. \u201cIt was a mark of honor but also a mark that she had lost a son.\u201d She thought of that gold star when her own son signed up. \u201cThere was a war on, you know.\u201d\n\nButtigieg was sworn in as an ensign in September 2009. A few months later, he announced he would challenge Indiana\u2019s Republican state treasurer, Richard Mourdock, in the 2010 election. Being a commissioned officer would play well with the state\u2019s conservative electorate. Buttigieg said he never brought it up.\n\n\u201cMy campaign manager kept putting it on the literature, and I kept taking it off,\u201d he said, because he had only recently started reserve training.\n\nAfter being contacted by The Post, Mourdock said he was surprised to learn he had been running against Ensign Buttigieg.\n\n\u201cI was going to argue all of the Naval service must have come after the 2010 campaigning because I never recall ever hearing of it in his race for the treasurer of state position,\u201d Mourdock said by email.\n\nButtigieg lost that election by a wide margin. But he won his next one for mayor of South Bend a year later. This time he did make his reservist credentials known, in part because he knew that being mayor would not keep him from being deployed.\n\nAnd two years into his term, he was called up, even as the worst scandal of his administration roiled race relations in the city. Soon after taking office, Buttigieg had removed South Bend\u2019s popular African American police chief for secretly recording white subordinates who had reportedly made racist comments. Buttigieg refused to release the tapes, citing legal constraints, infuriating activists and some members of the city council.\n\nIn 2014, as the controversy reverberated in South Bend, Buttigieg legally transferred his powers as mayor to Mark Neal, the city controller, and boarded a plane for Afghanistan.\n\nSome African American activists complain about the timing of his departure to this day. But many residents expressed support for their mayor\u2019s trip to a war zone.\n\n\u201cPeople were proud of him,\u201d said Lesser, who went to a Notre Dame football game with Buttigieg before he left. \u201cThe guy at the hot dog window was, like, \u2018Be safe over there Mayor.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nA U.S. soldier in a helicopter over Afghanistan's Logar province in May 2014.

Buttigieg\u2019s Afghan war unfolded in the \u201ctuna can\u201d \u2014 a converted shipping container parked inside U.S. and NATO headquarters in downtown Kabul.\n\nIt was an office job without much of an office. For part of his tour, only one other service member worked with Buttigieg. As he stood up after meals, he recounted in his book, he would joke to friends he needed to go check on his troops. \u201cYou mean, your troop,\u201d they would reply.\n\nButtigieg worked for the Afghan Threat Finance Cell, a Drug Enforcement Administration-led team of investigators with a storied history in the Afghan war. In the years before Buttigieg arrived, dozens of people from the Treasury Department, the FBI, DHS and all branches of the military uncovered rampant corruption within the Afghan government and a destabilizing Ponzi scheme within the nation\u2019s largest bank.\n\nBy 2014, that work was mostly over. The Obama administration was withdrawing troops and had chosen not to antagonize the government of President Hamid Karzai by pursuing sensitive corruption cases. The threat finance unit shifted to a less provocative mission, disrupting money flowing to the Taliban and other insurgent groups.\n\nButtigieg was dropped into a war in retreat. His unit was in the process of shutting down. The eager young lieutenant was eventually tasked with disposing of the office computers.\n\n\n\nButtigieg during his deployment in Afghanistan in 2014. (Courtesy of Buttigieg)\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re arriving, you want to do a mission. You want to build things. And you find that what you\u2019re really doing is orderly withdrawal,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cIt was definitely a sense that you\u2019re kind of arriving after the heyday of something.\"\n\nButtigieg started at Bagram air base, where his military colleagues worked, then moved to Kabul to serve as the unit\u2019s liaison to U.S. and NATO headquarters. His commander, Col. Guy Hollingsworth, chose Buttigieg because he was smart and could advocate for the team\u2019s priorities in its last months.\n\n\u201cI needed someone I could trust and be a good communicator,\u201d Hollingsworth said. \u201cHe was articulate and had a critical mind.\u201d\n\nButtigieg made little of the fact that he was a Midwestern mayor, not even telling the roommate who shared his trailer. His liberal politics were also a mystery to his commander, a Mormon and staunch conservative.\n\n\u201cHe did not come in on a horse and say, \u2018This is who I am,' \u201d Hollingsworth recalled. \u201cPete was very humble about it.\"\n\nHe was discreet about something else. No one in Afghanistan knew he was gay. When Buttigieg had signed up, he said he still didn\u2019t know himself, at least not with clarity. A lifelong struggle to understand his sexuality had only begun to resolve itself, and the military\u2019s \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy was still in effect. By the time he deployed, the policy had been repealed. Buttigieg still didn\u2019t tell.\n\nHe heard plenty of \u201ccasual homophobic humor,\u201d as he put it, in the military weight rooms and chow halls. He knew no openly gay service member and couldn\u2019t bring himself to become the first.\n\n\u201cI just wasn\u2019t ready,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nA boy runs with donkeys on the road to Bagram air base in 2014. (Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nButtigieg\u2019s daylight hours were packed with meetings, meals and sorting through classified intelligence on war-zone money flows. To break the monotony \u2014 \u201cYou felt like you\u2019re in a hamster cage,\u201d he recalled \u2014 Buttigieg leaped at the chance to leave base and drive his colleagues to meetings around Kabul. Wearing body armor and carrying an M4 rifle, Buttigieg navigated Kabul\u2019s clogged streets behind the wheel of an armored Suburban.\n\nHe carefully logged each trip outside the wire \u2014 119 by his count.\n\nKabul by that time was a more hostile place for foreigners, particularly the U.S. military. A week before Buttigieg arrived, Taliban militants had stormed the luxurious Serena Hotel and gunned down nine people inside. Arriving U.S. diplomats would often take helicopters to the embassy rather than risk the two-mile drive from the airport.\n\n\u201cThe last three months, I never left the embassy,\u201d said Frank Calestino, a former Treasury Department official who helped found the Threat Finance Cell in 2008 and left Kabul in mid-2013. \u201cThe Taliban had retaken territory they hadn\u2019t held in years. We could not drive to the airport. The fact that this guy was driving in a car, he was doing it in an environment far more dangerous than we were doing in 2008.\u201d\n\nOn one trip together to the western city of Herat, Buttigieg and his DEA chief, Joe Kipp, hustled under a concrete bunker as explosions and gunfire erupted outside a military base manned by Italian soldiers.\n\n\u201cThere were gunshots and booms,\u201d Buttigieg recalled. As he crouched in the bunker to wait out the assault, a B-1 bomber buzzed the base in a show of force. When Italian soldiers bounded into the bunker, the scene turned more surreal.\n\n\u201cThe Italians are allowed to drink, right? So they\u2019re having a party in there,\u201d he said.\n\nButtigieg chatted them up in Italian but stayed sober until the all-clear.\n\n\n\nButtigieg in Afghanistan in 2014. (Courtesy of Buttigieg)\n\n\u2018How this ends\u2019\n\nKabul did little to settle Buttigieg\u2019s ambivalence about the war on terrorism. He believed that the Afghan war was a necessary response to the 9/11 attacks but that it had gone on too long.\n\nOnce, as he stood in the gym, trying to decipher a poster of convoluted military \u201clines of effort\u201d that would somehow add up to a winning strategy, he remembered thinking, \u201cIf this is our mission, like, I don\u2019t know how this ends.\u201d\n\nAlthough he sometimes briefed generals on the progress of the Threat Finance Cell, as a lower-ranking officer he did not weigh in on more-strategic questions about U.S. objectives.\n\n\u201cOnce in a blue moon I\u2019d encounter somebody with a star on them, but even at HQ I was not that close to the flagpole, thankfully,\u201d he said, referring to the flags that marked the commander\u2019s office.\n\nAt least once a week, around midnight, Buttigieg would take his laptop and a cigar up to a rooftop and Skype into staff meetings in South Bend. He had no legal power, but with the occasional F-15 flying over, Buttigieg chimed in on street repairs and bond reports. The power went out on Notre Dame\u2019s graduation weekend. Neal had to be his proxy at the funeral of a 2-year-old boy slain by a stray bullet, a reminder of the city\u2019s gun violence.\n\nOn one Kabul night, the city staff in Indiana alerted Buttigieg to something he hadn\u2019t expected: South Bend was to hold its first gay wedding. Neal officiated in the mayor\u2019s conference room two days after a federal judge ruled Indiana\u2019s ban on same-sex marriage was unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cI remember seeing the pictures,\u201d Buttigieg said, \u201cand being moved by them.\u201d\n\nAfter seven months, his deployment ended. Buttigieg, who had been dropped off by his parents to go to Afghanistan, was met by them when he came home.\n\n\n\nButtigieg is welcomed home at South Bend International Airport in September 2014 after returning from a seven-month tour of duty in Afghanistan. (Greg Swiercz/South Bend Tribune/AP)\n\nBut now he was determined to welcome other loves into his life. He came out to more friends, then to his mom and dad, and then, in a 2015 op-ed published five months before he was elected to a second term, he publicly declared himself a gay man. Three years later, he was the groom in a same-sex wedding of his own, marrying middle school teacher Chasten Glezman.\n\nMilitary service helped make that joy available to him, he says now. The Navy let him fulfill a family legacy. His Afghanistan Campaign Medal also enabled him to round out a candidate profile that could have been assembled in a Democratic candidate laboratory: Rust Belt mayor, Ivy League whiz kid, married gay veteran.\n\nAnd it could make him the first Oval Office occupant with overseas active-duty experience since George H.W. Bush. He avoids specifics on how that would affect his leadership.\n\n\u201cIf we learned anything from the last decade and a half of endless war, it\u2019s that you do not casually threaten military involvement,\u201d Buttigieg said recently in an interview with Washington Post Live.\n\nIf he is elected, Buttigieg would assume command of a never-ending war he had first protested and then joined and still struggles to understand. And he would find himself not just near the flagpole but at the very top of it.\n\nDesign by Tyler Remmel. Photo editing by Natalia Jimenez.
