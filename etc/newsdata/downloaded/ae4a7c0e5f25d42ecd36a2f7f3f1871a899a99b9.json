Housing affordability is a top priority of Waters, who is from Los Angeles, where homelessness rose 12 percent last year.\n\nYet despite those shared concerns, Democrats and administration officials appeared to lack the trust necessary to break a decadelong stalemate on housing finance.\n\n\"[The administration] has consistently pushed harmful housing policies and proposed slashing and eliminating key housing funding for those most in need,\" Waters said.\n\nWashington has failed for more than a decade to overhaul the patchwork created to salvage the U.S. housing sector after the 2008 recession. Lawmakers have struggled to agree on a way to release the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, better known as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, from Washington\u2019s control.\n\nThe two government-sponsored enterprises purchase mortgages from banks, package them into bonds and sell those bonds to help fund home loans for buyers in areas underserved by private firms. Critics of the system say the vast amounts of debt held by Fannie and Freddie, along with lower credit standards for their loans, distort the housing market and load it with risk.\n\nTrump officials defended their plans to overhaul that system.\n\n\u201cIn their current condition Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will fail in a downturn,\u201d Calabria said. \u201cOf course it is my objective to get them out of this condition.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration has proposed steps it could take to tackle the issue on its own, including forcing Fannie and Freddie to boost capital reserves and reduce its footprint before releasing them to the private sector.\n\nSuch steps would not need congressional approval but wouldn\u2019t address the potential harm that could come from abruptly pulling crucial federal support for low-income housing.\n\nRepublicans urged support for the plans.\n\nRep.

Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez (D-N.Y.) suggested that the decision was related to Trump's frequent criticism of the commonwealth's government.\n\nWhen Velazquez connected the September arrests of two Federal Emergency Management Administration officials to broader \"corruption\" in the Trump administration, Republicans erupted in outrage.\n\nMcHenry asked Waters to reprimand Vel\u00e1zquez for \"unbecoming\" language, and Rep.
