It just means that it\u2019s not ready,\u201d the administration official said. \u201cOur goal is to sign it in Chile. But sometimes texts aren\u2019t ready. But good progress is being made and we expect to sign the agreement in Chile.\u201d\n\nTrump, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and other top U.S. officials have all said good progress is being made on the deal after a nearly 16-month trade war, while also noting that it would be fine if the deal was not finalized by the APEC summit.\n\nWhite House spokesman Judd Deere said both sides were still working to complete the interim deal.\n\n\u201cAs the president said several weeks ago, we have reached a phase-one agreement with the Chinese, and both sides are working to finalize the text for a signing in Chile,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Beijing, foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the two nations\u2019 lead trade negotiators would hold another telephone call shortly while working-level consultations continued at a fast pace.\n\n\u201cIt is China\u2019s hope that the two sides can find a way to resolve the economic and trade issues on the basis of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit,\u201d he told a daily briefing on Wednesday.\n\nU.S. stocks turned negative after Reuters reported the administration official\u2019s comments, as investors bet the closely watched trade talks were further away from resolution.\n\nThe interim trade agreement announced by Trump on Oct. 11 had buoyed markets, promising relief for companies rocked by nearly 16 months of tit-for-tat tariffs that have slowed global growth to its slowest since the 2008-2009 financial crisis.\n\nThe South China Morning Post, citing a person briefed on the arrangements, said on Tuesday the leaders of the world\u2019s two largest economies were tentatively set to sign the interim trade deal on Nov. 17 \u201cif everything goes smoothly.\u201d\n\nA U.S.-based source confirmed that was the target date for a meeting, but the administration official cautioned that the text might not be completed in time.\n\nWhite House adviser Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law, told an investment panel in Riyadh that U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Mnuchin \u201chave made a fabulous deal\u201d with Beijing.\n\n\u201cI think people understand the president, that he\u2019s firm. They know that he\u2019s going to make the decisions that he thinks are right, and I think ultimately that we\u2019ve come to an understanding with China now on where we want to head.\u201dLighthizer said on Friday Washington and Beijing are \u201cclose to finalizing\u201d some sections of a trade pact after a phone call between top negotiators.\n\nU.S. officials have said the deal is to cover Chinese purchases of U.S. agricultural goods, intellectual property protections, currency practices and increased access for U.S. companies to China\u2019s financial services market.\n\nU.S. and Chinese flags are seen in front of a U.S. dollar banknote featuring American founding father Benjamin Franklin and a China's yuan banknote featuring late Chinese chairman Mao Zedong in this illustration picture taken May 20, 2019.
