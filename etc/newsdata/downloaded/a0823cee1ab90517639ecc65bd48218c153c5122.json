(Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nThe importance of guns in Virginia\u2019s fall elections was on display Friday outside the headquarters of the National Rifle Association, as Democratic candidates \u2014 joined by former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords \u2014 vowed to mandate background checks, age limits and other gun restrictions if their party seizes control of the General Assembly.\n\n\u201cThese are scary times,\u201d said Giffords (D-Ariz.), who suffered a brain injury in a shooting in Tucson in 2011. She attended the rally along with former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) and about a half-dozen Democrats being endorsed by her pro-gun-control organization, the Giffords group.\n\n\u201cNow is the time to come together and be responsible, Democrats and Republicans,\u201d Giffords said. \u201cWe must never stop fighting.\u201d\n\nMcAuliffe was more pointed, saying the NRA\u2019s presence in Fairfax County is \u201ca disgrace to the Commonwealth of Virginia.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t like our bills, you can move your headquarters somewhere else,\u201d the former governor said, addressing NRA chief executive Wayne LaPierre.\n\nAn NRA spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\n\n\nDel.

Terry McAuliffe (D) and former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.). (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nDemocrats are seeking to overcome narrow Republican majorities in the House of Delegates and the Senate this fall. It is the only election in the country this year where control of the state legislature is at stake.\n\nThey see a path to victory in highlighting the NRA-friendly stances taken by GOP lawmakers in Richmond in the wake of several mass shootings around the country, including one in Virginia Beach in May that killed 12 people.\n\n[National groups on both sides of gun control issue donate big money in Va.]\n\nThe Giffords group is supporting 41 Democratic candidates across the state, with plans to pour money into key races and canvass those areas for votes.\n\nEverytown for Gun Safety \u2014 another national group, started by billionaire ex-New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg \u2014 is backing 25 Democrats in Virginia, targeting Republican incumbents in suburban swing districts with a $2.5 million advertising blitz in Northern Virginia, Richmond and the Hampton Roads area.\n\n\n\nFormer Gov. Terry McAuliffe and former Rep. Gabby Giffords announce a newly endorsed slate of gun safety candidates running for various Virginia offices, in front of the National Rifle Association headquarters on Friday. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nOn the opposite side, the NRA \u2014 which has been embroiled in internal controversy and leadership battles as of late \u2014 recently donated $200,000 to the political action committee of House Majority Leader Todd Gilbert (R-Shenandoah). It was by far the organization\u2019s largest one-time contribution in Virginia in at least the past 20 years, according to the nonpartisan Virginia Public Access Project.\n\n\u201cMy guess is that this is going to become an animating issue in the closing weeks of several of these races,\u201d said Quentin Kidd, director of the Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University.\n\nA recent Washington Post-ABC News poll found that a vast majority of the country \u2014 including political independents and women who could play vital roles in upcoming elections \u2014 strongly supports gun-control measures such as background checks. Republican elected officials have general opposed such legislation.\n\nIn July, Virginia Republicans abruptly ended a special legislative session focused on gun bills \u2014 convened by Gov. Ralph Northam (D) in the wake of the Virginia Beach shooting \u2014 without considering a single bill.\n\nThe GOP lawmakers referred more than 60 pieces of legislation to the State Crime Commission, which heard testimony from experts and presentations from the bill\u2019s sponsors. Garren Shipley, a spokesman for Gilbert, said Republicans are waiting for recommendations from the commission before taking action.\n\n[`We are a heartbroken city.\u2019 Virginia Beach mourns, searches for answers]\n\n\u201cToday, our children, because of the cowardice of the people in our legislature, have to practice drills to learn how hide from gun violence in their classroom,\u201d Del. Kathleen Murphy (D-Fairfax) said Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace.\u201d\n\nWith corporations also calling for a debate on gun control, some Republicans in Virginia have adopted a softer stance. Mary Margaret Kastelberg, who is running for a Richmond-area House seat, called this week for background checks, limits on magazine size and a \u201cred flag\u201d law that would allow authorities to temporarily take guns away from people deemed a danger to themselves or others.\n\nLast month, Del. Tim Hugo (R-Fairfax), who is locked in a high-profile race against Democrat Dan Helmer in the only GOP-held House district in increasingly blue Northern Virginia, expressed his support for a \u201cred flag\u201d bill.\n\n\u201cWhen you start getting Republican candidates, who are supported and endorsed by the Republican Party, advocating for gun control, that\u2019s a sure sign that the electorate is pretty solidly aligned on the issue,\u201d Kidd said. \u201cAnd, candidates, whether Democrat or Republican, are starting to pick up on that.\u201d\n\nSen. Amanda F. Chase (R-Chesterfield), a staunch advocate for increasing the rights of gun owners, tweeted a photo of herself at the shooting range Friday. The caption read: \u201cI\u2019m not afraid to shoot down gun groups,\u201d and was later amended to \u201canti-gun groups,\u201d according to Chase\u2019s campaign spokesman Philip Search.\n\nThe post was widely circulated by Democrats expressing outrage.\n\nAt the Giffords rally, about 50 supporters waved signs at the glass NRA office building across the street that read \u201cDayton, OH\u201d and \u201cEl Paso,\u201d references to two recent mass shootings.\n\n\u201cUniversal background checks? We should know who we\u2019re giving guns to,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Richard L. Saslaw (D-Fairfax). \u201cYou gotta be 21 to drink, you ought be 21 to buy a gun, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d\n\nDel. Hala S. Ayala (D-Prince William), who is in a competitive race with former Del. Rich Anderson (R-Prince William), told the group that gun violence took the life of her father, who was shot by his brother in the 1970s in Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cI was two years old,\u201d Ayala said. \u201cThis is how gun violence affects families.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nNational groups on both sides of gun issue pour money into Virginia races\n\nThe NRA is in turmoil, but in Virginia gun debate, the group flexed its muscles\n\n`They want our state.\u2019 GOP and NRA say gun control just start of upheaval in Va.\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Former Rep.
