She\u2019s been taken over by the radical left. She may be radical left herself, but she really has lost her way,\u201d said Trump during a meeting at the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nTrump said that he spoke to Pelosi to discuss gun reform on Tuesday, the same day as her impeachment announcement, but claimed that she \u201cdidn\u2019t even know what I was talking about.\u201d\n\n\u201cNancy Pelosi is not interested in guns and gun protection and gun safety. All she\u2019s thinking about is this,\u201d the president said.\n\nTrump lies and says Nancy Pelosi \"is not interested\" in gun control, despite the fact that House Democrats have passed gun control legislation that Mitch McConnell refuses to allow for a vote. pic.twitter.com/A8etYtH6KU \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) September 25, 2019\n\nTrump went on to say that Pelosi, as far as he\u2019s concerned, \u201cis no longer the speaker of the House.\u201d\n\nAs NPR has noted in 2015, \u201cousting a sitting speaker is nearly impossible.\u201d In practice, a majority of House members have to decide they don\u2019t want the current speaker and they can agree on a new speaker. The president has no say in the matter.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, the White House released its summary of a July 25 phone call between the American and Ukrainian presidents. In the call, Trump asked Zelensky to \u201cdo us a favor, though,\u201d immediately after Zelensky told Trump that he was grateful for U.S. military aid to his country.\n\nThe implication was that Trump was linking the provision of military aid to Zelensky\u2019s complying with that favor. The implied threat became the catalyst for Democrats to push for Trump\u2019s impeachment.\n\nAs for Pelosi, despite her focus on impeachment this week, she has made more strides towards gun reform just this month. Alongside Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Pelosi called on Trump to \u201cdefy the National Rifle Association and get behind legislation, already passed by the House but blocked in the Senate, to expand background checks to nearly all gun buyers,\u201d according to The New York Times.\n\nIn a September letter to the president, Schumer and Pelosi wrote that his \u201curgent, personal intervention is needed to stem the endless massacres of our fellow Americans by gunfire\u201d and that he had a \u201chistoric opportunity to save lives.\u201d", "description": "The president claimed that Pelosi has been \"taken over by the radical left\" and doesn't care about gun control anymore.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8bc7712100005f005d848a.png?cache=2sdhkgbjc7&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
