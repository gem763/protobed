In other words, they want food that is better for people and the environment using fewer resources, according to a recent survey commissioned by my company, Corteva Agriscience, to better understand European farmer and consumer attitudes toward sustainable food systems.\n\nThe study surveyed 600 farm owners and managers across France, Germany, Italy, Romania, the U.K. and Ukraine, as well as 2,500 consumers in France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, the U.K. and Ukraine.\n\nAgriculture is already transforming to meet consumer demands. Farmers acknowledge that consumer demand for more sustainable food has already changed their agricultural planning practices. Many are exploring new innovations to address these expectations.\n\nAgriculture is already transforming to meet consumer demands.\n\nFor example, more than two-thirds of the farmers interviewed plan to implement new plant-breeding techniques in the future. But agriculture cannot be sustainable unless it is also profitable for the farmer, so higher yields and productivity are essential. Farmers are the original stewards of the land and are eager to improve the sustainability of their operations as long as their profitability does not suffer.\n\nConsumers are thinking differently about how to achieve a more sustainable food system, too. More than half of those surveyed said they were ready to accept gene-editing technology and were willing to pay more for food grown through new techniques.\n\nCorteva has the technology in the pipeline\n\nTargeted breeding through CRISPR-cas gene editing technology creates an improved plant that does not include DNA from a different species. It has the potential to significantly improve crop performance while satisfying the demand for fresh, wholesome and nutritional food that is produced in an environmentally friendly way.\n\nImagine healthier cooking oils, avocados that last longer because they do not go brown as quickly, tomatoes that are good for your heart and taste great regardless of the season and seeds that are more resistant to pathogens and pests.\n\nCorteva is encouraging wide adoption of this technology in agriculture by enabling access to CRISPR intellectual property with the intent to help solve some of the world\u2019s biggest food challenges.\n\nCRISPR makes it possible to deliver nutritious plants that could occur in nature or be developed through conventional breeding, but faster and more efficiently.\n\nCorteva is encouraging wide adoption of this technology in agriculture by enabling access to CRISPR intellectual property for nonprofit organizations, academics and commercial enterprises, with the intent to help solve some of the world\u2019s biggest food challenges. Universities and public research institutes worldwide are conducting research with this technology across a wide array of plant applications.\n\nBut these types of innovations often face regulatory barriers and public skepticism, despite the demand for agricultural practices to change.\n\nThe challenge of global food security is real\n\nThe U.N.\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization reports that more than 820 million people around the world suffer from hunger. Global food security is a challenge that will become more complex as populations grow, with food demand expected to increase by 50-60 percent over the next century.\n\nTo feed a world that demands more and better-quality food, conditions on smallholder farms, which account for most of our farms and farmers worldwide, need to improve dramatically.\n\nIn fact, today in sub-Saharan Africa, India, China, South Asia and Latin America, smallholder farms generate more than 80 percent of all food production. Unfortunately, these countries are also home to the majority of people living in poverty and half of the world\u2019s undernourished people. Most of these farms are also more susceptible to the adverse effects of climate change, water stress, crop pests and diseases, and a basic lack of adequate transportation infrastructure.\n\nAgriculture is an incredibly complex and intertwined network of political, financial, social and cultural systems. No single company or organization has the power to create long-lasting change by working alone. It will take a proverbial village \u2014individuals, governments and civil society \u2014to support increased investment in agricultural research, as well as sustainability strategies and approaches with public policies, and prioritization based on sound science.\n\nFor more information, visit www.corteva.com/our-impact/our-sustainability.html\n\nAuthors:", "description": "Study shows rising demand for more sustainable food and a willingness to pay for it", "authors": ["Dana Bolden", "Senior Vice President Of External Affairs", "Chief Sustainability Officer", "Corteva Agriscience"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/download-1-1-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
