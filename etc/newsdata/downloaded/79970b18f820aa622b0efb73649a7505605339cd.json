The resolution passed 405-11, with three representatives voting 'present,' the most notable being Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN).\n\nFrom the Los Angeles Times:\n\nThe resolution, which is not legally binding, marked the first time in 35 years that either chamber of Congress labeled as genocide the mass killings of Armenians at the hands of the Ottoman Empire, which is now modern-day Turkey, between 1915 and 1923 . A similar House resolution passed in 1984. Support for the measure \u2014 particularly among some Democrats \u2014 grew after Turkey\u2019s recent offensive against the Kurds along the Turkish-Syrian border, which killed about 200 Kurds and displaced more than 200,000. \u201cGiven that the Turks are once again involved in ethnic cleansing the population \u2014 this time the Kurds who live along the Turkish-Syrian border \u2014 it seemed all the more appropriate to bring up a resolution about the Ottoman efforts to annihilate an entire people in the Armenian genocide,\u201d said resolution sponsor Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank). The vote on the bipartisan resolution came on the heels of House passage of economic sanctions against Turkey.\n\nAccording to the Daily Caller, a vote like this hasn't taken part since 1984 because of Turkey's lobbying in the United States:\n\nA similar vote has not been held since 1984, thanks in large part to Ankara\u2019s heavy lobbying campaign in the U.S. Turkey, a member of NATO, has long disputed the use of the term \u201cgenocide\u201d to describe the deaths of Armenians. The Turkish government has paid millions to U.S. lobbyists to prevent passage of a genocide resolution. Former Missouri Rep. Dick Gephardt, a Democrat, and former Georgia Rep. Bob Livingston, a Republican, are two of Ankara\u2019s most prominent lobbyists on the issue.\n\nOmar voted \"present\" during the final vote because of \"geopolitics.\"\n\n\"I believe accountability for human rights violations \u2013 especially ethnic cleansing and genocide \u2013 is paramount. But accountability and recognition of genocide should not be used as cudgel in a political fight. It should be done based on academic consensus outside the push and pull of geopolitics,\" Omar said in a statement. \"A true acknowledgement of historical crimes against humanity must include both the heinous genocides of the 20th Century, along with earlier mass slaughters like the transatlantic slave trade and Native American genocide, which took the lives of hundreds of millions of indigenous people in this country. For this reason, I voted 'present' on final passage of H.Res. 296, the resolution Affirming the United States record on the Armenian Genocide.\"\n\nNot surprisingly, people were upset with Omar's \"present\" vote.\n\nIlhan Omar votes \u201cpresent\u201d\n\non condemnation of Armenian genocide. Her explanation doesn\u2019t cut it. pic.twitter.com/u9mCWMlab4 \u2014 ian bremmer (@ianbremmer) October 29, 2019\n\nYou mean to tell me BDS Queen Ilhan Omar refuses to recognize the Armenian genocide? I, for one, am shocked. \u2014 Erielle Davidson (@politicalelle) October 29, 2019\n\nIlhan Omar\u2019s failure to vote for the Armenian Genocide recognition resolution has everything to do with her respect for Erdogan and his regime\u2019s close ties with her native Somalia. See my article from March to make sense of it: https://t.co/aWBOifNukZ \u2014 Jordan Schachtel (@JordanSchachtel) October 30, 2019\n\nRep. Omar should know that the US has denied the Armenian Genocide for over a century due to our military and financial relationship with Turkey. So is there EVER a situation in which condemning their ethnic cleansing of Armenians acceptable? So disappointed. https://t.co/waGuHIyORo \u2014 Ana Kasparian (@AnaKasparian) October 29, 2019\n\nJust how bad was Democrat Rep. Ilhan Omar's (MN) refusal to recognize and condemn the Armenian Genocide?\n\n\n\nA Young Turks employee \u2014 a company that was named after the people who committed the genocide \u2014 said Omar's explanation was a \u201cbad answer.\u201d\n\n\n\nOOF pic.twitter.com/nXvIZ4gfD8 \u2014 Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) October 30, 2019\n\nIlhan Omar has a documented history of colluding with Turkey, including on behalf of her native Somalia. Not surprising this paragon of social justice and human rights champion would cower completely in the face of the systematic slaughter of the Armenians https://t.co/0k2ghMXqg8 \u2014 Benjamin Weingarten (@bhweingarten) October 29, 2019\n\nOk this is really dodgy. Earlier I saw that @IlhanMN had voted \u201cyea,\u201d on the #ArmenianGenocide vote, and now that vote has been removed and she is put as \u201cpresent.\u201d Both Tlaib and AOC have voted \u2018yea\u2019. \u2018Omar\u2019 was right beside \u2018Ocasio-Cortez.\u2019\n\n\n\nDid Erdogan\u2019s office make a call? pic.twitter.com/wPOGD8ruUL \u2014 Imam of Peace (@Imamofpeace) October 29, 2019\n\nThis photo from 2017, before Omar was in Congress, gives an indication of why she\u2019d vote that way pic.twitter.com/6bHBGMv4jZ \u2014 Chuck Ross (@ChuckRossDC) October 29, 2019\n\nSo much for putting your money where your mouth is, huh?", "description": "Hmm..10/29/2019 22:21:30PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/106/e9608f14-d7a5-453a-89de-f64c43347f10.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
