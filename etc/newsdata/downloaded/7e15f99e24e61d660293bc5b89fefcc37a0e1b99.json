This morning, she ruled that Boris Johnson\u2019s prorogation, or suspension, of parliament was unlawful.\n\nMy Daily Beast colleagues in London, Jamie Ross and Nico Hines, referred to the moment as \u201cone of the most momentous legal verdicts in British history,\u201d that might lead to Johnson earning the dubious distinction of \u201cBritain\u2019s shortest-serving prime minister.\u201d\n\nLady Hale understood the situation required gravitas, and therefore the judge delivered her ruling wearing the only accessory appropriate: a knuckle-sized spider brooch.\n\nEd Brody, a publicity manager based in London, first noticed the accoutrement on Twitter, writing, \u201cCan we not lose sight of what\u2019s important here: what an absolute brooch icon Lady Hale is.\u201d He punctuated the observation with not one, two, or three, but eleven instances of the justice pinning fake, friendly critters over her right shoulder.\n\nSome might call Lady Hale an \u201cunlikely\u201d trendsetter, but as photographic evidence proves, Lady Hale\u2019s been out here flexing for a while now. She has worn pins shaped like frogs, caterpillars, and butterflies. She\u2019s even sported a resting fox on her shoulder, though under her watch the eyes of the law never sleeps.\n\nAfter the world noticed the spider she opted for when delivering her message to Johnson. Lady Hale quickly became a social media darling\u2014especially among those who oppose Brexit and support Britain staying in the European Union. She is also a longtime and vocal supporter of diversity within the judiciary. A stadium tour with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg would surely sell out.\n\n\u201cLady Hale looks like the kind of sweet old lady who'd make you tea and offer you a biscuit and then sits down to tell you about all her assassination missions she did for the resistance during the war in occupied France,\u201d read one popular tweet. (Though it's worth noting Lady Hale was born in 1945. She'd be fighting the Nazis at negative years old.)\n\nAs The Guardian reported, after making waves online, the brooch quickly popped up on a t-shirt made by the company Balcony Shirts. Thirty percent of the shirt\u2019s proceeds will be donated to Shelter, a UK charity which aims to end homelessness. As of Tuesday afternoon, the top had garnered \u00a34,000 to donate.\n\nLady Hale\u2019s rising reputation needs no added stoking\u2014the brooches are quite enough, thank you very much\u2014but there are more delightful, amphibious-themed facts to learn about the justice.\n\nLast year, Mike Amos of The Northern Echo described Lady Hale\u2019s return visit to Richmond, in Yorkshire, where she went to girls\u2019 school, as \u201ca bit like Madonna playing a neighborhood concert.\u201d\n\nA profile revealed that the 73 year old \u201cenjoys making jam,\u201d though her husband Julian Farrand is a better cook.\n\nLady Hale referred to Farrand as her \u201cfrog prince.\u201d It\u2019s an \u201cinside joke,\u201d she told the paper. Because of this, naturally, \u201cNow people give us frogs.\u201d\n\nThe Echo reported that Lady Hale is the proud owner of \u201ca large collection of ceramic frogs,\u201d and that there are \u201csome 6 foot wooden centipedes\u201d in her home garden.\n\nBritish fashion has long had a reputation for being delightfully eccentric and a bit quirky. Think of Marianne Faithfull\u2019s heart-shaped sunglasses, Isabella Blow\u2019s futuristic fascinators, or Vivienne Westwood\u2019s layer of tartan.\n\nLady Hale, with her spider brooch, deserves a place among these greats. More accurately, perhaps, they deserve a spot alongside her.", "description": "When ruling that Boris Johnson \"unlawfully\" suspended parliament, Lady Hale wore a fist-sized spider brooch.
