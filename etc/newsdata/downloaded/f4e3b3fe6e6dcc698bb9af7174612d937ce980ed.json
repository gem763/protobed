That mix, that \u201crub,\u201d which occurred principally in the South, set off a chain reaction that has reverberated in our music ever since.\n\nThe earliest country recordings were known as \u201chillbilly\u201d music, just as African-American recordings were categorized as \u201crace\u201d music. The names echoed a prevailing prejudice that each genre (and its artists and its fans) was somehow beneath consideration from society\u2019s upper rungs \u2014 and that each one was unrelated to the other.\n\nIn truth, as the two of us learned during the eight years we spent exploring the music and its history, they were always intertwined. The music constantly crossed the racial divide that a segregated nation tried to enforce.\n\nBefore his career took off, Rodgers worked as a water boy in Mississippi for the mostly black crews laying railroad track. The men he met, and their music, shaped his own emerging style \u2014 the songs he made popular as an adult were essentially the blues, to which he added a distinctive yodel. In 1930, at the height of his popularity, he recorded with Louis Armstrong, the protean jazz artist.", "description": "Common stereotypes overlook the roles that blacks and women have played in shaping a uniquely American genre.", "authors": ["Dayton Duncan", "Ken Burns"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/13/opinion/13burnsduncan-illo/13burnsduncan-illo-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
