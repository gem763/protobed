The better to eat you with, my dear.\n\nTyrannosaurus rex, the most fearsome predator to ever walk the Earth, had a bite so hard it was able to shatter the bones of its prey. But a new study notes that the terrifying dinosaur had a stiff skull that allowed it to not shatter its own bones with its bite force, while simultaneously devouring its kill.\n\nThe research notes that although birds evolved from dinosaurs and subsequently, the T. rex, the 6-foot-long, 5-foot-wide-skull of the apex predator was more like that of hyenas and crocodiles, stiff and rigid. Previously, paleontologists had believed the skull was flexible, like modern-day birds and snakes.\n\nVICTORIA, SECOND-MOST COMPLETE TYRANNOSAURUS REX SKELETON, SET TO GO ON DISPLAY\n\n\"Dinosaurs are like modern-day birds, crocodiles and lizards in that they inherited particular joints in their skulls from fish \u2014 ball and socket joints, much like people\u2019s hip joints \u2014 that seem to lend themselves, but not always, to movement like in snakes,\" said Casey Holliday, an anatomy expert who participated in the study, in a statement. \"When you put a lot of force on things, there's a tradeoff between movement and stability. Birds and lizards have more movement but less stability.\"\n\n\"When we applied their individual movements to the T. rex skull, we saw it did not like being wiggled in ways that the lizard and bird skulls do, which suggests more stiffness,\" Holliday added.\n\nOne of the study's co-authors, Kaleb Sellers, said that T. rex had a bite force of \"about 6 tons,\" adding that previous research did not take into account the relationship between the bones, ligaments and cartilage in the skull.\n\n\"Previous researchers looked at this from a bone-only perspective without taking into account all of the connections \u2014 ligaments and cartilage \u2014 that really mediate the interactions between the bones,\u201d Sellers said.\n\nThe researchers used a combination of anatomy and engineering analysis to look at the skull and come up with their hypothesis. They also utilized two of T. rex's present-day relatives, a gecko and a parrot, to make their observations.\n\nT. REX HAD AN 'AIR CONDITIONER' IN ITS HEAD, STUDY SAYS\n\nThey also believe that the findings of their study could \"advance human and animal medicine by providing better models of how joints and ligaments interact.\" The study has been published in The Anatomical Record.\n\nIn addition to having a stiff skull, T. rex likely had something similar to an \"air conditioner\" in its head, allowing it to stay cool while hunting, according to a separate study.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "Tyrannosaurus rex, the most fearsome predator to ever walk the Earth, had a bite so hard it was able to shatter the bones of its prey.
