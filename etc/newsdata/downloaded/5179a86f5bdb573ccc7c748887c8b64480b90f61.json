The Indians\u2018 loss clinched the AL Central title for Minnesota.\n\nCleveland lost for the second time in its last nine tries and dropped 1 1/2 games behind Tampa Bay for the second AL wild-card spot.\n\nA throwing error by first baseman Carlos Santana put the Indians behind at the start. Bieber (15-8) had won three in a row, but allowed five runs - three earned - on 10 hits in 5 2/3 innings.\n\nJose Ram\u00edrez hit a solo home run for Cleveland. On Tuesday night, in his first two plate appearances after missing a month with a broken hand, he hit a grand slam and a three-run homer.\n\nTim Anderson matched a career high with four hits and also scored two runs for Chicago. He improved his batting average five points to an AL-best .339 with his sixth fourth-hit game of the season, most in the major leagues. Jos\u00e9 Abreu drove in his league-high 122nd run with the last of his three singles.\n\nThe Indians trailed 5-3 in the seventh when Welington Castillo greeted reliever Tyler Clippard with three-run homer to break it open. Yo\u00e1n Moncada doubled and Yolmer S\u00e1nchez singled off reliever Oliver Perez to start the inning.\n\nWhite Sox starter Ross Detwiler (3-5) allowed three runs on five hits in five innings to earn the victory, his first since Aug. 25 against Texas. The left-hander walked none and struck out one. He entered the game with a 1-2 record and 9.00 ERA in his last five starts.\n\nLeury Garcia hit the fourth leadoff homer of his career and third this season for the White Sox, and Anderson and Abreu followed with singles. With one out, Zack Collins hit a slow roller that Santana fielded close to the line and lobbed over the head of catcher Roberto P\u00e9rez.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nIndians: RHP Corey Kluber (strained left oblique) accompanied the team on its final road trip, but the two-time Cy Young Award winner wasn\u2019t expected to pitch again this season barring an extended playoff run.\n\nWhite Sox: Garcia (sore right shoulder) and Matt Skole (tight right abdomen) left the game in the fifth inning. Both were said to be day-to-day. . Rookie OF Eloy Jim\u00e9nez (ear-throat infection) was not with the club. Manager Rick Renteria indicated he could be available Thursday night . Renteria confirmed RHP Dylan Covey (sore right shoulder) would not pitch again this season. The veteran finished with a 1-8 record and 7.98 ERA in 18 appearances.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCleveland RHP Aaron Civale (3-3, 1.82) and Chicago RHP Dylan Cease (4-7, 5.79) are the scheduled starters in the series finale Thursday night. Civale is the first major leaguer since 1910 to allow no more than two earned runs in at least five innings in his first nine career starts.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Shane Bieber got tagged early and the Cleveland Indians lost ground in the AL wild-card race, falling to the Chicago White Sox 8-3 on Wednesday night.
