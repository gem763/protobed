(Shannon Stapleton/Reuters)\n\nSouth Bend, Ind. mayor Pete Buttigieg has surged to third place in an Iowa poll of Democratic presidential candidates released Monday.\n\nThe Suffolk University/USA Today poll showed Buttigieg receiving 13 percent of the prospective vote in the Iowa caucus, a seven percent increase since the poll was last conducted in June. Frontrunner Joe Biden received 18 percent of the prospective vote, while Senator Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) received 17 percent.\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders (D., Vt.), who lost to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Iowa caucus by one percentage point, garnered nine percent in the new poll.\n\nButtigieg has raised $19.1 million over July, August and September, finishing third in fundraising totals during that period. Sanders has raised $25 million while Warren has raised $24.6 million.\n\nButtigieg\u2019s performance, which closely followed the latest debate, represents a significant improvement from a similar Suffolk University/USA Today poll in June, in which he received just six percent of the prospective vote. In that poll, taken after the first Democratic primary debate, Joe Biden led the field with 24 percent while California Senator Kamala Harris garnered 16 percent of likely voters.\n\nHarris has dropped to just three percent in the latest poll.\n\nButtigieg has presented himself as a more moderate alternative to the progressive Warren, while remaining to the left of Biden. The Indiana mayor released a campaign ad on October 14 taking on Warren\u2019s and Sanders\u2019s support for universal Medicare coverage and proposing his own plan that preserves the private market while increasing access to Medicare coverage.\n\n\u201cIf you prefer a public plan like Medicare, like I think most Americans will, you can choose it,\u201d Buttigieg says in the ad, \u201cBut if you prefer to keep your private insurance, you can.\u201d\n\nButtigieg has also resisted Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s call to strip religious institutions of their tax-exempt status if they refuse to support same-sex marriage.\n\n\u201cGoing after the tax exemption of churches, Islamic centers or other religious facilities in this country\u201d will \u201cdeepen the divisions that we\u2019re already experiencing,\u201d Buttigieg said in an interview.", "description": "South Bend, Ind. mayor Pete Buttigieg has surged to third place in an Iowa poll of Democratic presidential candidates released Monday.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Robert Verbruggen", "Andrew C.
