Thanks for the reminder!\u2019\n\nCaption: METROGRAB \u2013 Dave Benson Phillips tells us to put our \\\u2019cocks back\\\u2019 in the best Twitter blunder ever\n\nFrom @DaveBensonPhill/Twitter\n\nProvider: @DaveBensonPhill/Twitter\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother of Dave\u2019s fans sympathised with his awkward blunder and chimed in: \u2018That is hilarious bet you were mortified!!!\u2019\n\nOne other follower and quipped: \u2018This is excellent advice, thanks Dave.\u2019\n\nIn a cheeky reference to his former job, one suggested: \u2018He\u2019s in for a gunging,\u2019 while another fan joked: I always take care of my roosters.\u2019\n\nAt least they saw the funny side.\n\nBut rather than just delete or replace the original tweet, Dave was a good sport and left it up, simply explaining the mistake in another tweet.\n\nHe told his followers: \u2018Re; my recent tweet\u2026 the word I meant to type was \u2018clocks\u2019, and not the word that actually appeared in my tweet.\n\n\u2018My sincerest apologies to those who were shocked or offended by my previous message, which was meant to be helpful. I was in a queue waiting for my takeaway meal.\u2019\n\nYep, hunger will do that to you.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
