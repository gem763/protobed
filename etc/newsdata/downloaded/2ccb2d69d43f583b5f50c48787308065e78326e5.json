The federal party doesn't have any candidates nominated in New Brunswick at the moment, according to the party's website.\n\nThe former provincial candidates who are leaving are:\n\nJoyce Richardson, NDP candidate for Dieppe in 2018.\n\nLise Potvin, NDP candidate for Shediac-Beaubassin-Cap-Pele in 2018.\n\nWilly Robichaud, NDP candidate for Miramichi Bay-Neguac in 2018.\n\nAlbert Rouselle, NDP candidate for Shippagan-Lameque-Miscou in 2018.\n\nAnne Richardson, NDP candidate for Petitcodiac-Gagetown in 2018.\n\nJustin Young, NDP candidate for Oromocto-Lincoln-Fredericton in 2018.\n\nJean-Maurice Landry, NDP candidate for Bathurst Est-Nepisiguit-Saint Isidore in 2018.\n\nJessica Caissie, NDP candidate for Moncton-Centre in 2018.\n\nLina Chiasson, NDP candidate for Victoria-La Vallee in 2018.\n\nCecile Richard-Hebert, NDP candidate for Madawaska-Les Lacs-Edmundston in 2018.\n\nFrancis Duguay, NDP candidate for Tracadie-Sheila in 2018.\n\nHailey Duffy, NDP candidate for Moncton Southwest in 2018.\n\nMadison Duffy, NDP candidate for Riverview in 2018.\n\nBetty Weir, NDP candidate for Albert in 2018.\n\nJonathan Richardson, a member of the NDP's national executive representing Atlantic Canada, is also leaving the team for the Greens.\n\n\"In New Brunswick, the NDP does not have a path to victory,\" Richardson said. \"There are no candidates for the NDP in New Brunswick or P.E.I. for the federal election.\n\n\"I actually just received a call from the organizer, you know, pleading for my help to keep finding these candidates and I said, you know, at the end of the day this is the decision I've made.\n\n\"Obviously they're not pleased. I'm not thrilled to be saying to my friends that I'm going to be moving on.\"\n\nJonathan Richardson, a member of the federal NDP's election planning committee in New Brunswick, announces the defection of himself, and fourteen former NDP candidates, to the Greens. 0:47\n\nThe NDP's director of communications, M\u00e9lanie Richer, told CBC News those disaffected ex-New Democrats who joined the Greens will have some explaining to do if the election delivers an outcome their supporters don't want.\n\n\"If these people are not interested in helping people make ends meet by bringing in a national pharmacare program right away \u2026 that's up to them to explain,\" she said. \"If these people are comfortable in supporting a Conservative government led by Andrew Scheer uplifted by Elizabeth May's Greens, that's also up to them to explain.\n\nRicher insisted the party is on track to \"nominate a full slate of candidates\" in New Brunswick.\n\n\"We're currently scheduling nomination meetings for six of those 10 ridings by the end of next week. Everyone in New Brunswick will be able to vote for an NDP MP who will work to immediately bring in a national pharmacare program and will always put people's interests first,\" she said.\n\nIt's not clear if any of the defectors will run for the Greens federally. The Green Party has nominated candidates already in more than half of the ridings in New Brunswick.\n\nAccording to the CBC's Canada Poll Tracker, an aggregation of all publicly available polling data, New Democrats are polling at roughly 13 per cent nationwide and around 10 per cent in Atlantic Canada.\n\nThe NDP has been voiceless in the New Brunswick legislature since 2005, while the Green Party is enjoying a boom in support. Coon's Greens secured three seats in the 2018 provincial election, tying with the People's Alliance.\n\n\"I am joining the Green Party of Canada and New Brunswick and I invite my NDP colleagues to do the same,\" Richardson said. \"The Green Party of Canada has been steadfast in their beliefs, never flip-flopping on achieving their goal.\"", "description": "Fourteen disgruntled former New Brunswick NDP candidates are defecting and throwing their support behind the provincial and federal Greens\u00a0\u2014 a\u00a0move unlikely to spark confidence in the federal New Democrats on the cusp of an election call.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.2746905.1474655509!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/green-party-leader-david-coon.jpg"}
