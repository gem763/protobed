A freshman told of men in a passing vehicle who had hurled slurs at her and fired paintballs. A senior argued that the Senate, composed mostly of white students, did not grasp the extent of its privilege \u2014 \u201cyou can\u2019t even fathom how much you gain and how much we lose,\u201d the woman said.\n\n\u201cAre you here for us?\u201d Udonna Simpson, a senior political science major , asked in a passionate address before the resolution was passed without any dissent. \u201cI ask you to show us you\u2019re here for us, to show us you care about us, to show us you are not racist.\u201d\n\nOutside of a terse statement confirming Mr. Riley\u2019s resignation, neither the university nor Mr. Riley has commented further. University officials, through a spokeswoman, declined to say anything more, and Mr. Riley did not respond to multiple requests for an interview.\n\nThe silence reflects the frustration faculty members said they feel over the pace of improving diversity, an issue with which they wrestled long before Mr. Riley\u2019s resignation, said Pamela Payne Foster, a professor of community medicine and population health.\n\n\u201cI do believe we\u2019re at a critical point,\u201d she said, \u201cwhere the question is being asked: At what point are we going to tip this over, or is it going to stay where it is? The fight is a pretty formidable fight.\u201d", "description": "A black dean at the University of Alabama resigned after old tweets were recirculated, a move that prompted a sit-in at the president\u2019s office, a letter of admonishment and a reckoning.", "authors": ["Rick Rojas"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/24/us/00TUSCALOOSA01/00TUSCALOOSA01-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
