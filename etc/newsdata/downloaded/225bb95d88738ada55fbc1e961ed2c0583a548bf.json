That almost grotesque symmetry set millions of American women ablaze as we watched the Republican senators on the Judiciary Committee apologize and genuflect to Kavanaugh\u2014a snarling, spitting mess of snot and resentment (\u201cthis is a joke!\u201d)\u2014while insisting on his right to a lifetime appointment. It didn\u2019t seem to matter that Dr. Christine Blasey Ford had just detailed how he\u2019d sexually assaulted her. Weeks later, the Women\u2019s Wave flooded Congress with Democrats, putting Nancy Pelosi back in the line of succession.\n\nJoe Biden Wrote the GOP's Playbook for Brett Kavanaugh\n\nI\u2019m still not over it, and neither is the electorate. In a September PerryUndem poll, 49 percent of voters said that the Kavanaugh hearings made them want more women in office. Among Democrats, 79 percent of women and 71 percent of men strongly or somewhat agreed that Kavanaugh was confirmed because white men wanted to hold onto power. Fifty percent of independent voters\u2014split almost evenly along gender lines\u2014said the same.\n\nYet even as men increasingly seem to understand the stranglehold of patriarchy, and some have done good work exposing and dismantling it (shout-out to Ronan Farrow), it\u2019s remained mostly women on the front lines.\n\nIn She Said: Breaking the Sexual Harassment Story That Helped Ignite a Movement, Times reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey\u2019s riveting book about reporting on Harvey Weinstein, nearly 100 percent of the people who attempt to do something about the movie mogul\u2019s flagrant misconduct are female. The exception that proves the rule is Ivan Reiter\u2014an accountant for The Weinstein Company who was ultimately shamed after a public screaming match with his twentysomething daughter Sherri into helping expose his boss. Reiter is a key source for Kantor and Twohey, but unlike many of the women who helped them break the story, he\u2019d been able to go for years until then in a lucrative career while taking limited action. So, too, the CYA men on the company board, who cared about the many complaints against their CEO exactly as far as they threatened the bottom line.\n\nThat indifference seemed to extend to the male reporters who\u2019d been waved off the story by Weinstein\u2019s fixers. Kantor and Twohey recount how The New Yorker\u2019s Ken Auletta started sniffing around when Ambra Battaligia Gutierrez publicly accused Weinstein of sexually assaulting her in 2015, but ultimately declined to pursue the story \u201cafter lawyers convinced him Gutierrez was not trustworthy.\u201d Bob Woodward easily could\u2019ve been one of them too. The investigative journalist got booed Thursday night in D.C when he interviewed the She Said authors, constantly interrupting them with misplaced questions. It\u2019s clear that no woman would\u2019ve ever trusted him with their story, if he\u2019d even cared to listen. The Times itself hardly covered Guttierez' claims in 2015, and ran a big puff piece on Weinstein as his movie, Finding Neverland, was coming out.\n\nYears Before Harvey Weinstein Surrendered, Prosecutors Did \u2018Opposition Research\u2019 on His First Accuser\n\nBut the women reporters weren\u2019t so easily pushed off of the story. They crouched in doorways to stake out sources and hunted down retired civil servants in California for court records because they knew these women were worth it. No one had to sell them. In the acknowledgement section of their book, they thank the women whose paid work caring for their kids makes their own work possible. I can\u2019t recall ever seeing a male author do that.\n\nNow the consequences of male conspiracy could be significant for the country. On Friday, the court announced that it will take up the first abortion rights case since Kavanaugh took his seat. But not before Tuesday, when it will hear a glut of cases about whether Title VII protections extend to trans and gender non-conforming people covered under the famed caveat to the 1964 Civil Rights Act, \u201cbecause of sex.\u201d The ruling could send American workers back to a world in which a young Ruth Bader Ginsberg couldn\u2019t get a job.", "description": "SAUL LOEBA year ago Sunday, the MeToo movement reached a flaming crescendo with the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.\u00a0It was an insane pile-up of events that coincided with the anniversary of the New York Times first cracking the Weinstein case, and reached back in time to the woman", "authors": ["Alexis Grenell"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_FKjgADZ3sVgsLOoKGxJgQ--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/e7c5891854251333e5793db6ac50a242", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
