Col. Alexander Vindman, Trump's top National Security Council adviser on Ukraine, that had Democrats questioning Sondland's testimony most pointedly.\n\nSondland testified that \u201cneither Ambassador Bolton, Dr. Hill, nor anyone else in the NSC staff ever expressed any concerns to me about our efforts \u2026 or any concerns that we were acting improperly,\u201d referring to former national security adviser John Bolton and former NSC senior Russia director Fiona Hill, who gave her own testimony last week.\n\nSondland added that if Bolton, Hill, \u201cor any others harbored misgivings about the propriety of what we were doing, they never shared those misgivings with me, then or later.\u201d\n\nAccording to Vindman, that is not true. In his opening statement, Vindman wrote that he and Hill confronted Sondland on July 10 after a meeting with Ukraine's top national security official. And, according to Hill and Vindman, Bolton abruptly ended a meeting with Ukraine\u2019s top national security official, Oleksandr Danylyuk, because he was disturbed about Sondland\u2019s comments.\n\nVindman said he and Hill subsequently accused Sondland of \"inappropriate\" remarks to the Ukrainians that seemed to condition a potential White House visit for Zelensky on a promise to open Trump's desired investigations.\n\n\u201cI stated to Amb. Sondland that his statements were inappropriate, that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security, and that such investigations were not something the NSC was going to get involved in or push,\" Vindman told lawmakers, according to his statement. He noted that he took his concerns to the NSC's top lawyer after the meeting.\n\nHill testified earlier this month that she met with NSC lawyer John Eisenberg twice, at Bolton\u2019s urging, to relay concerns about the conversations. Both Vindman and Hill met with NSC lawyers on the same day, July 10, after Bolton cut the Danylyuk meeting short.\n\nSondland was careful to say in other areas of his opening statement that he did not \u201crecall\u201d certain incidents, rather than stating categorically that they never happened. He told lawmakers, for example, that he didn\u2019t remember discussing the vice president or his son, or efforts to investigate them, with any State Department or White House official.\n\nBut the damage has been done. On Monday night, Rep. Joaquin Castro, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, wrote on Twitter that \u201cbased on all the testimony so far, I believe that Ambassador Gordon Sondland committed perjury.\u201d\n\nSondland's attorney declined to comment on Vindman's remarks and Castro's perjury accusation.\n\nThough Castro is the first impeachment investigator to directly accuse Sondland of perjury, other Democrats have questioned his retelling of the events surrounding his interactions with Ukrainians, which have been described by multiple witnesses as inappropriate.\n\nSondland, who had a direct line to Trump, assured fellow ambassadors in September text messages obtained by lawmakers that Trump was not attempting to coerce Ukraine to do his bidding by withholding a White House visit or military aid.", "description": "Some Democrats have begun to raise the specter that Sondland, a Republican donor who is Trump's representative to the European Union, perjured himself during his closed-door testimony to impeachment investigators earlier this month.
