What is the budget and how much have you spent?\u201d Jo Stevens, MP for Cardiff South, asked. Harrison was unable to answer with a figure but said that it was in line with the ECB\u2019s prior expectations of costs for the Hundred.\n\nIn evidence given later to the DCMS select committee, Andy Nash, formerly the chairman of Somerset and an independent director of the ECB, said that the Hundred would cost \u00a360 million a year, once payments to the counties during the competition were taken into account. The ECB expects annual income from the tournament to be around \u00a351m a year, which would equate to a loss of around \u00a37m from the total \u00a358m costs, including county payments.\n\nNash attacked the Hundred as an \u201calmighty punt\u201d and \u201creckless gamble\u201d, and said that the tournament posed an \u201cexistential risk to the game\u201d. A better alternative, Nash said, would be to make the T20 Blast a two-divisional competition, with promotion and relegation, which would be \u201cmuch lower risk\u201d.", "description": "Tom Harrison, the chief executive of the England & Wales Cricket Board, repeatedly failed to answer how much had been spent on the Hundred so far as the ECB were grilled at a Department of Culture, Media and Sport select committee in Parliament.", "authors": ["Tim Wigmore", "Simon Briggs"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/cricket/2019/10/23/TELEMMGLPICT000211810041-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqOfbQuL7vt0ioTIEx8Tqi0ENe32rTNAQsERfsrlbfRW4.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
