From HOKA ONE ONE to Madewell, the brand knows how to make a killer collab. And now, they\u2019ve done another that has us excited. Outdoor Voices brought Merrell, maker of some of the best-rated hiking boots around, into the mix.\n\nThe Outdoor Voices + Merrell Moab 2 is OV\u2019s first hiking boot but it takes after Merrell\u2019s best-selling silhouette. Released as part of OV\u2019s Use Your Outdoor Voice campaign, which saw the return of the sold-out MegaFleece made from recycled Merino wool, the hiking boot is all function and form. The Moab itself is a hefty boot with ample ankle support. It\u2019s fully waterproof and its durable treads will keep you climbing and hiking, even in the rain. The boot comes in two variants, the women\u2019s version in Taro and the men\u2019s version in Galapagos Green. Keep your feet looking great and feeling dry on your next hike. | Shop at Outdoor Voices >\n\nScouted is internet shopping with a pulse.
