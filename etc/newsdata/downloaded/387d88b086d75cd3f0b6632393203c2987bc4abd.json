Poland must change more and it must change for the better,\u201d Jaroslaw Kaczynski, PiS leader, told supporters at its Warsaw headquarters.\n\nExperts have warned that a strong PiS win means it could proceed with court reforms that risk undermining judicial independence and the rule of law, something likely to further stoke conflict with the European Union.\n\nShould final results confirm its expanded majority, \u201cwe can expect the PiS to further limit liberal democracy\u201d Warsaw University political scientist Anna Sosnowska-Materska told AFP.\n\nAn economic slowdown underway in Germany will have a knock-on effect in Poland, limiting state revenues and so cramping the PiS\u2019s welfare measures, according to Warsaw-based analyst Ewa Marciniak.\n\nCondemning the PiS\u2019s anti-LGBT drive and close church ties, but sharing the PiS\u2019s welfare goals, the left returned to parliament after a four-year hiatus.\n\nConfederation, a new far-right libertarian party, captured 6.4 percent support for 13 seats, according to Ipsos. The PSL farmers/Kukiz 15 alliance took 9.6 percent of the vote for 34 seats.\n\n\u2013 Welfare state \u2013\n\nIn office since 2015, Kaczynski\u2019s PiS has focussed on poorer rural voters, coupling family values with the introduction of welfare state spending like a popular child allowance, tax breaks for low-income earners and hikes to pensions and the minimum wage.\n\n\u201cThe PiS is finally taking care of the weakest, most vulnerable members of society,\u201d Kasia, a 40-year-old psychologist working at a women\u2019s shelter, told AFP after voting in Warsaw. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it first hand at work.\u201d\n\nKaczynski, who is widely regarded as Poland\u2019s de facto leader, has also stoked deep social division by attacking sexual minorities and rejecting Western liberal values, all with the tacit blessing of Poland\u2019s influential Catholic Church which holds sway over rural voters.\n\nHe is among several populist leaders in the European Union favouring greater national sovereignty over the federalism championed by powerhouses France and Germany.\n\nThe PiS has sought favour with the Trump administration. Poland has long regarded the United States as the primary guarantor of its security within the NATO alliance and as a bulwark against Russia, its Soviet-era master with whom tensions still run high.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Safeguard future\u2019 \u2013\n\nBacked by outgoing EU Council President Donald Tusk \u2014 from Poland and Kaczynski\u2019s arch-rival on the domestic scene \u2014 the opposition Civic Coalition (KO) has drawn mainly on urban voters upset by the PiS\u2019s divisive politics, judicial reforms threatening the rule of law, graft scandals and monopolisation of public media.\n\n\u201cI voted for democracy, to safeguard the future of my grandchildren,\u201d Jadwiga Sperska, a 64-year-old working pensioner and KO supporter, said outside a Warsaw polling station.\n\n\u201cThe current government\u2019s direction could lead us out of the EU,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cI support an open, tolerant society, without aggression and with same-sex unions,\u201d said Monika Pronkiewicz, a 31-year-old public sector worker and left-wing voter in Warsaw.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Teflon party\u2019 \u2013\n\nKaczynski has tapped into a populist backlash against liberal elites, similar to trends in Western Europe and the US.\n\nHis party\u2019s bid to build a welfare state appeals to Poles who felt left behind amid the explosive growth and unfettered free-market drive after communism fell in 1989.\n\nAnalysts suggest the social outlays have made the PiS a \u201cteflon party\u201d, cushioning its reputation amid a string of graft scandals involving senior members.\n\nThe KO had vowed to reverse PiS court reforms, which the EU says threaten judicial independence, but otherwise offered voters little.\n\nCritics attribute strong economic growth under the PiS to favourable external factors.\n\nA tight labour market in the EU country of 38 million people saw it become the world\u2019s top temporary migrant labour destination in 2017, according to the OECD.\n\nPreliminary official election results are due on Monday.", "description": "Warsaw (AFP) \u2013 Poland\u2019s governing right-wing party topped Sunday\u2019s general election, an exit poll showed, expanding its majority thanks", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/13/78c127_poland-governing-wing-party-topped-sunday-election-populists-top-poland-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
