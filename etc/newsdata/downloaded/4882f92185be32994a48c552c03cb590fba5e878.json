Yoan Valat/Pool via REUTERS\n\nThe 39-year-old New Zealand prime minister is often contrasted with Trump for her views on issues including women\u2019s rights, climate change and diversity.\n\nArdern joined a march championing women\u2019s rights after Trump\u2019s inauguration in 2017, before she was elected prime minister. She has publicly rejected Trump\u2019s view on the threat of white nationalism and recently said she \u201ccompletely and utterly disagreed\u201d with his comments telling four minority women lawmakers to go back to where they came from.\n\nAsked by reporters in Wellington about her personal relationship with Trump, Ardern said it was \u201cabsolutely fine\u201d.\n\n\u201cMy job is to represent New Zealand and our interest. Having good relationships is important,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt will mean from time to time we take different perspectives but it should never get in the way of us having a good dialogue on the things that matter, including issues of trade,\u201d she added.\n\nNew Zealand was a strong advocate for the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which Trump withdrew the United States from in 2017. A modified trade pact without the U.S. was formed last year.\n\nTrump and Ardern have met informally before and have spoken over the phone but the meeting scheduled for sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York would be the first formal sit-down bilateral.\n\nArdern shot to prominence after an unexpected victory in New Zealand\u2019s 2017 election and has been feted globally as part of a new wave of progressive, young leaders that included France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron and Canada\u2019s Justin Trudeau.\n\nArdern\u2019s pregnancy, maternity leave and the birth of her daughter while in office also set her apart, with many people seeing it as symbolizing progress for women in leadership roles.\n\nArdern said she never characterized the 2017 rally she attended in Auckland as an anti-Trump rally, and joined it to continue focusing on the gains women have made.\n\nOften speaking out on climate change, multi-lateralism and inclusiveness, Ardern will be giving a keynote speech at the UN Secretary General\u2019s Climate Action Summit.\n\nArdern has said she disagrees with Trump\u2019s view that white nationalism was not a growing problem, after a suspected white supremacist killed 51 Muslim worshippers in Christchurch in March.\n\nWhen asked by Trump what support he could offer following the attack, Ardern said: \u201cSympathy and love for all Muslim communities.\u201d", "description": "New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Tuesday she plans to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in New York next week, in what would be the first formal bilateral discussions between the two leaders.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430733072&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G0EX", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
