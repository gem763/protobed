If an athlete has a combination of three missed tests over the span of 12 months - either because he isn\u2019t where he said he would be, because he gave the wrong information or because he didn\u2019t update the information - it can be considered an anti-doping violation.\n\nAthletes are responsible for submitting their whereabouts information quarterly, then updating it as necessary. In an interpretation of the rule that WADA applied to Coleman, his first missed test, on June 6, 2018, was backdated to the start of the quarter in which he missed the test - April 1 - which put it outside of the 12-month window between that failure and his latest one, on April 26, 2019.\n\nIt was an interpretation of the rule that USADA did not initially anticipate, and one that will be eliminated when the WADA code is revised for 2021.\n\nAnd though USADA does not discuss ongoing cases in public, because this one got leaked to the media, and because Coleman subsequently commented on it, it freed up USADA to explain its side of the case.\n\n\u201cIn this case, we applied the rules to Mr. Coleman in the manner that USADA understands should be applied to any other international-level athlete,\u201d USADA CEO Travis Tygart explained.\n\nMost fans probably won\u2019t delve into the minutiae of this issue, but will see the words \u201cDoping\u201d and \u201cTrack\u201d in the headlines and think \u201cnothing new there.\u201d\n\nFor the better part of 10 years, Bolt shifted that focus - even deflecting away inevitable questions about his own clean doping record with a smile, or by earnestly taking umbrage at the mere suggestion - and placed it squarely on the track, where his light all but blinded everyone from this sport\u2019s ever-growing laundry list of warts and imperfections (Remember, the Russian doping scandal began as a track and field issue, and barring an unexpected move by track\u2019s governing body this week, Russians will compete as neutral athletes with their track federation still under suspension).\n\nNow that Bolt is gone, the top two contenders in Saturday\u2019s 100-meter final are expected to be Coleman and defending champion Justin Gatlin, a 37-year-old who has been suspended twice for doping violations and whose victory at worlds in London in 2017 was greeted with skepticism from the media and boos from the stands.\n\n\u201cI know you have to have the black hat and the white hat, but guys, c\u2019mon,\u201d Gatlin said after his victory, in responding to the booing and the harsh questioning that accompanied the win.\n\nCan any sprinter - whether declared innocent, or insistent that he\u2019s changed his ways - get a clean start in a sport that demands exactly that?\n\nMaybe Coleman\u2019s trip to Doha, with less than a year to go before the 2020 Olympics, will offer some sort of answer.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Usain Bolt is in the rearview mirror, replaced by - what else? - an unfolding doping saga in track and field.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Eddie Pells"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/22/doping_drama_athletics_73943_c0-113-2702-1688_s1770x1032.jpg?45b6d8c701bc472e050069bc1a8c6fa04be94aef", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
