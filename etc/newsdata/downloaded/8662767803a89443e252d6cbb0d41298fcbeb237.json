It'll be a good challenge, but we're definitely up for it.\"\n\nThe match-day 23 contains 21 players who were involved in the 41-7 World Cup warmup win over Japan at Kumagaya six weeks ago, with the only absentees being injured prop Trevor Nyakane and center Jesse Kriel.\n\n\"You need that experience when it comes to handling the pressure situations we will face on Sunday, and I think we've achieved that now,\" Erasmus said.\n\nThe winner at Tokyo Stadium will advance to a semifinal against either Six Nations champion Wales or France.\n\nSpringboks assistant coach Matthew Proudfoot has experience coaching in Japan's domestic competition, and knows the national team will be getting most of the support at the ground and from neutral fans.\n\n\"But the way we handle this wouldn't be any different to how we handle the New Zealand mindset, or facing England at Twickenham,\" Proudfoot said. \"We focus on our battles, and where our pressure points are going to be, and we relish that opportunity to play in this amazing occasion, in an amazing stadium with a passionate crowd.\"\n\n\"To play in that environment . it gives me goosebumps just thinking about it,\" he said. \"So, I don't think we are sitting and thinking 'Ah, the rest of the world wants us to get beaten.'\"\n\n__\n\nSouth Africa: Willie le Roux, Cheslin Kolbe, Lukhanyo Am, Damian de Allende, Makazole Mapimpi, Handr\u00e9 Pollard, Faf de Klerk; Duane Vermeulen, Pieter-Steph du Toit, Siya Kolisi (captain), Lood de Jager, Eben Etzebeth, Frans Malherbe, Bongi Mbonambi, Tendai Mtawarira.
