REUTERS/Lai Seng Sin\n\nKUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia is considering listing the exploration and production arm of state energy company Petronas, the world\u2019s third-biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas, state news agency Bernama reported on Friday citing Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.\n\nMahathir has previously said that the government was looking to sell or list some state assets to reduce debt. There has been speculation this could include selling a portion of Petronas.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, we feel that selling Petronas shares is not going to be good for the government,\u201d Mahathir said in a dialogue session in New York, according to Bernama.\n\nThe government may consider listing Petronas at a later stage, he said.\n\n\u201cWe may sell off the shares of the subsidiaries because that will not affect Petronas that much. One of them is Carigali but there are also a few others,\u201d said Mahathir, who is in New York for the United Nations General Assembly.\n\nPetronas Carigali, the exploration arm, has both local and international operations.\n\nA handful of Petronas\u2019 units are already listed on the national stock exchange, including the petrochemical arm Petronas Chemicals (PCGB.KL)\n\nPetronas and the prime minister\u2019s office were not immediately available for comments.", "description": "Malaysia is considering listing the exploration and production arm of state energy company Petronas, the world's third-biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas, state news agency Bernama reported on Friday citing Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434428101&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q0DE", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
