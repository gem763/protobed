This fun exchange between two Obama administration officials took place over the weekend but is clearly worth a backward glance or two. In a segment with Axelrod on CNN\u2019s Axe Files, the former attorney general scoffed at the near-universal position adopted by Democratic presidential candidates for decriminalizing illegal border crossings.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s right,\u201d Holder responded when asked about making illegal crossings a civil rather than criminal offense:\n\n\u201cThe emphasis there was on people who had criminal records, people who posed a danger, a public safety risk,\u201d Holder, who served under former President Obama, said of the previous administration\u2019s policy in a CNN interview released Saturday. \u201cDemocrats have to understand that \u2026 borders mean something,\u201d he added. Holder expressed disagreement with a proposal embraced by some Democratic presidential candidates to make illegally entering the U.S. a civil offense rather than a criminal offense. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right,\u201d he said. \u201cThe law that is on the books has been there for about 100 years or so.\u201d \u201cIt might send the wrong signal. But it would certainly take a tool away from the Justice Department that it might to use,\u201d Holder added.\n\nAll this prompts an urgent question: Who will be the first Democratic presidential contender to call Holder a racist? My money\u2019s on Juli\u00e1n Castro, but Robert Francis \u201cBeto\u201d O\u2019Rourke might be a close second. All kidding aside, when people speculated that Holder might run for office himself, they assumed he would run as the progressive\u2019s progressive. Suddenly, even Eric Holder thinks Democrats have lost their minds on open borders. And so does David Axelrod, apparently, although Axe has always been more pragmatic than ideological.\n\nHolder\u2019s not doing this to launch a late-hour run for the nomination, so it\u2019s clear that he and Axelrod want to warn their fellow Democrats to pull it back. Might this be aimed most particularly at former fellow White House alum Joe Biden? The veep has been sounding pretty radical on borders lately \u2014 and pretty confused, too, claiming that his administration didn\u2019t lock people in cages when they very much did so. If anyone should be defending border enforcement, it should be the supposedly moderate candidate, who instead seems intent on proving himself more extreme than Bernie Sanders and more hip than Pete Buttigieg.\n\nWhatever the aim, the message is clear. When Eric Holder tells Democrats that their border policy positions are insane, maybe they should listen up.", "description": "\"Borders mean something.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/holder-borders.png", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
