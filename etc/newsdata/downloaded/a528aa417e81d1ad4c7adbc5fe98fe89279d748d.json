Maxar expects 48 employees to initially staff the facility, most of whom are new hires that will support the NGA\u2019s Global EGD, Janus Geography and SBIR Phase III contracts. St. Louis is the Midwest geospatial hub of the United States in part due to its proximity to the National Geospatial and Intelligence Center West facility, the T-REX Geospatial Resource and Innovation Center and several other commercial GEOINT companies.\n\n\u201cThe establishment of our cutting-edge facility in St. Louis is a strong reflection of Maxar\u2019s commitment to unlocking the power of geospatial data for our customers,\u201d said Tony Frazier, Maxar\u2019s Executive Vice President of Global Field Operations. \u201cThis new facility will provide our customers with easier access to better geospatial products and insights for success across the breadth of defense and intelligence missions.\u201d\n\nThe operations of DigitalGlobe, SSL (Space Systems Loral) and Radiant Solutions were unified under the Maxar brand in February; MDA continues to operate as an independent business unit within the Maxar organization.\n\nAbout Maxar\n\nMaxar is a trusted partner and innovator in Earth Intelligence and Space Infrastructure.
