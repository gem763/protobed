It is outrageous.\"\n\nJonathan Ernst/Reuters\n\nIn the last Senate vote, on March 14, 2019, 12 Republicans broke with the president, who used the National Emergencies Act to essentially do an end-run around Congress, which normally has the power of the purse. Under the NEA, Congress may vote every six months to end the presidential declaration.\n\nSchumer said Trump \u201cadds insult to injury\u201d by \u201cstealing\u201d from funds meant for military construction funds.\n\nThe $3.6 billion taken from 127 military projects is expected to fund 11 ventures yielding 175 miles of new or reconstructed wall along the southern border with Mexico.\n\nJonathan Ernst/Reuters\n\nSpecifically, Schumer cited funds taken from three states with key 2020 Senate races, including McConnell\u2019s own state of Kentucky, which lost funding for a new, long-awaited middle school on Fort Campbell.\n\nSchumer also highlighted McSally's state where a $30 million project was shelved, at least for now, although the Arizona Republican downplayed the loss, saying the money would eventually be appropriated. The Democratic leader noted that North Carolina GOP Sen. Thom Tillis' state lost some $80 million in projects, as well. But a spokesman for Tillis pointed out that $33 million of that funding is for a school at Ft. Bragg that had already been canceled years ago.\n\nHouse Democrats are considering a similar move.\n\nPresident Trump, who said last week that the Defense Secretary Mark Esper agreed with him that the border wall was an emergency that needed critical funding, vetoed the resolution of disapproval that passed both houses of Congress back in March. Neither chamber was able to override that veto.", "description": "Senate Democrats will force GOP senators to vote on border funding that takes money from military projects and to terminate President Trump's", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/schumer-rt-jt-190910_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
