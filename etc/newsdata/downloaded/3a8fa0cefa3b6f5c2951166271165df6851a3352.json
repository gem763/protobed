(Darren Carroll/Getty Images)\n\nLee Ann Walker thought she was posting scores of 85 and 74 during the first two rounds of the Senior LPGA Championship.\n\nThen a competitor\u2019s caddie informed her halfway through her second round that her caddie had been standing in the wrong place as she putted. It was a violation of a rule new to the tour this season prohibiting caddies from standing behind players as they putt.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nWalker found a rules official and self-reported the violation, according to Golf Channel.\n\n\u201cWe had her recreate the times that that happened,\u201d LPGA rules official Marty Robinson told Golfweek.\n\n58 penalty strokes\n\nEach violation comes with a two-stroke penalty. That added up 42 penalty strokes in Monday\u2019s first round and 16 strokes added Tuesday for whopping new scores of 127 and 90. Walker \u2014 obviously \u2014 did not make the cut. She finished 73 strokes over par, 39 strokes behind her next closest competitor.\n\nIf there\u2019s any solace for Walker, her total of 159 over two rounds would have put her just over the cut line. She wasn\u2019t going to play in the three-day tournament\u2019s final round with or without the penalties.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Lee Ann Walker learned the hard way about a new rule regarding caddies.", "authors": ["Jason Owens"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/lBc_pLXXxxAu7xPibfZ3yQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ZARHM8SrXhAb357QiihWMw--~B/aD0yMDAwO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/a545beb0-f042-11e9-befb-2f53ff286f85", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
