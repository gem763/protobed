That\u2019s surprising, since impeachment news and increased recession odds ought to have sent all but the most die-hard bulls into the bears\u2019 camp.\n\nLast week, the Institute of Supply Management\u2019s gauge of factory activity fell to its lowest level in a decade. Service-oriented companies (the sector that employs a large majority of Americans) experienced their slowest growth in three years.\n\nThese developments (and more) saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.88% shed more than 800 points over the first two trading days of October. That\u2019s the worst start to a calendar quarter since 2008.\n\nYet only a few of the short-term market timers I monitor have thrown in the towel. That\u2019s not encouraging for U.S. stocks from a contrarian point of view.\n\nConsider the average recommended equity exposure level among these short-term timers (as measured by the Hulbert Stock Newsletter Sentiment Index, or HSNSI). This average currently stands at 23.2%, which is five percentage points above where the index stood at the beginning of September \u2014 when the Dow was higher than where it stands now. (See chart, below.)\n\nSince the normal pattern is for bullishness to rise and fall more or less in lockstep with the market, the market timers\u2019 relative bullishness is an ominous contrarian sign.\n\nHow far must the HSNSI fall before contrarians will conclude that the market is at a low-risk entry point for a short-term trade? Preferably into negative territory, which exists whenever the average short-term timer is highly bearish and recommending that clients short the market. At its low at the end of 2018, for example, the HSNSI fell to minus 21.7%. From that low, the Dow turned in a four-month rally of some 22%.\n\nTo be sure, the market has staged rallies that started from less-negative HSNSI readings. But those rallies have tended to be less explosive.\n\nOne way to put the market-timing community\u2019s current sanguine attitude in perspective is to compare it to the mood at the analogous stage of the impeachment inquiry into then-President Richard Nixon. It was on Feb. 6, 1974, that the House of Representatives voted to give the Judiciary Committee the authority to open its impeachment inquiry, and though the timers\u2019 mood wasn\u2019t then as dark as it would be in subsequent months, it was already quite gloomy.\n\nWe know because of the \u201cAdvisors Sentiment Index\u201d maintained by Investors Intelligence. That index reflects the percentage of monitored market timers who are outright bullish, outright bearish, or bullish but expecting a near-term correction. On Feb. 6, 1974, just 31.6% of timers were outright bullish, while 50.9% were bearish.\n\nIn contrast, Investors Intelligence today shows just the opposite: 55.3% are outright bullish, versus 17.1% who are outright bearish. (This survey is updated weekly, with these latest readings reflecting timers\u2019 opinions as of the beginning of this week. The HSNSI is updated daily; it is telling a largely similar story.)\n\nThe bottom line: Believing the stock market rout that started October has no further to go is a triumph of hope over experience. And hope is not a strategy.\n\nMark Hulbert is a regular contributor to MarketWatch. His Hulbert Ratings tracks investment newsletters that pay a flat fee to be audited.
