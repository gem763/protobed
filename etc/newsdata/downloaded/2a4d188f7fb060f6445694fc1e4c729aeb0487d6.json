Here are the top warning signs, according to experts)\n\nOne glacier on particular is posing a particular threat, Troilo told ABC News. A portion of Planpincieux Glacier, on the Italian side of the mountain, is moving up to a meter per day, compared to a more normal movement of 10 centimeters per day.\n\nPHOTO: A view of the Bossons Glacier of the Mont-Blanc massif in Chamonix in France on Sept. 1, 2018. (Jean-pierre Clatot/AFP/Getty Images) More\n\nThe melting ice is a signifier of climate change, causing scientists to be on full alert, Troilo said.\n\nThe Safe Mountain Foundation and the Valle d'Aosta regional government stated in an analysis released last month that the glacier could collapse at any moment, releasing 66 million gallons worth of ice.\n\n(MORE: What you can do to help prevent climate change, according to experts)\n\n\"What we are seeing today is the rate of change, which is very very high, and this doesn't give us time to adapt,\" Troilo said. \"Every season we see new spots where there could be new risk.\"\n\nIf the warming trend continues, future scenarios predict that the majority of glaciers will be gone by the year 2100, Troilo said.\n\nPHOTO: Glaciers on Mont Blanc, the tallest mountain in Europe, are rapidly melting due to climate change.
