He was wearing a green tie as a mark of respect for the victims of the Grenfell disaster.\n\n'I think those Tory MPs mocking his tie would be better supporting justice for the families and the victims of the Grenfell Tower and those who died in similar conflagrations and to deliver safety and protection for people living in tower blocks all over the country.'\n\nJeremy Corbyn wore a bright green tie and pin for Grenfell today but not all Tory MPs seemed to know why\n\nTheresa May (pictured today) was seen telling off colleagues who were unaware of the significance of his tie\n\nMrs May's intervention came before Tory MP Huw Merriman, who worked for Philip Hammond when he was Chancellor, praised outgoing Speaker John Bercow for wearing an Arsenal tie during his last PMQs.\n\nBoris Johnson wore a green Grenfell pin and said he hoped today's report would bring some comfort to those caught up in the Grenfell Tower tragedy\n\nHe then asked Jeremy Corbyn, also a fan of the Gunners, why he wasn't wearing his ahead of the team's Carabao Cup quarter final with Liverpool tonight.\n\nHe said: 'It's a pleasure to see you in your Arsenal tie - I'm sorry the Leader of the Opposition has not worn his own.'\n\nMPs then shouted at him: 'It's for Grenfell' and afterwards Labour's Shadow Education Secretary Angela Rayner tweeted: 'Tory backbenchers jeering Jeremy Corbyn for the colour of his Green tie! It's about respect for Grenfell. Shocking lack of awareness from some Tory MPs!'.\n\nAddressing MPs later, Mrs May said the Grenfell disaster was 'a tragedy that should never have happened'.\n\nSpeaking during the debate on Sir Martin Moore-Bick's report, Mrs May said: 'This was a horrific loss of life, and of course it was a tragedy that should never have happened.\n\n'And I would like to pay tribute to the survivors and to the families and friends of those who died for the dignity and fortitude that they have shown in circumstances which none of us would want to have to face.'\n\nOn the issue of cladding, she said: 'I think it is significant that Sir Martin Moore-Bick was able himself clearly to say that the cladding was non-compliant.\n\n'I think that was an important aspect and finding of part-one of the inquiry, although greater details in relation to those matters will be gone into part two of the inquiry.'\n\nMPs bowed their heads and held a minute's silence as relatives of those who died in Grenfell Tower watched from the public gallery\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson led tributes in the Commons to those who died and survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire at the start of the debate on the findings of an inquiry into the disaster.\n\nMr Johnson told MPs: 'The bereaved, the survivors and the members of the North Kensington community joining us in the galleries today, each has their own story to tell, their perspective on what happened at Grenfell.\n\n'But over the past two-and-a-half years they have been united in their fight to uncover the truth. It is not a fight they would ever have chosen. But it is one that they have taken up with determination, with dedication and with great dignity.\n\n'Yet their exceptional tenacity in seeking justice has not always been matched by their faith in the system's ability to deliver. This is no surprise. After all, they have been let down many times before.\n\n'Too often overlooked and ignored in the months and years before the tragedy and shamefully failed by the institutions that were supposed to serve them in the days and weeks after it.'\n\nThe Grenfell Tower fire in North Kensington, West London, in June 2017 left 72 people dead and the report marking the end first phase of the public inquiry is out today\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Grenfell was an 'avoidable tragedy' before insisting there is 'genuine love and affection' between the community and the firefighters who risked their lives to help.\n\nHe told the Commons: 'I know nobody is trying to do this today, let's not blame firefighters for their work - they did everything they could and more and well beyond that.'\n\nMr Corbyn also said: 'I think the Grenfell survivors are the heroes of all this.\n\n'Because when you go through a tragedy there is a natural human instinct to try and put it behind you, move away, go off and do something else if you've got that opportunity and choice.\n\n'They haven't done that - they've stayed there, stayed in that community, kept that community together in order that the rest of us might learn the lessons of the pain they went through.'\n\nMr Corbyn also stressed the 'whole truth is not yet with us', with phase two of the report still to come.\n\nStop hiding behind the bravery of frontline firefighters\u2019: Grenfell families slam brigade chief Dany Cotton and call for senior officers to be prosecuted over \u2018gravely inadequate\u2019 response to tower tragedy\n\nby Martin Robinson, Mark Duell, Richard Spillett and Joe Middleton for MailOnline\n\nThe bereaved families of the Grenfell Tower disaster have slammed senior fire chiefs for failing to learn the lessons from the tragic blaze and have called for them to be prosecuted.\n\nThe scathing inquiry into the Grenfell Tower disaster today condemned fire chiefs' slavish refusal to evacuate the burning building as it was revealed 55 of the 72 people who died in the fire were told to remain in their flats.\n\nLondon Fire Chief Dany Cotton was heavily criticised by the official report into the tragedy including her 'remarkable insensitivity' in her evidence to the public inquiry in September last year where she insisted she 'would not change anything we did on the night'.\n\nCampaign group Grenfell United said Cotton and other bosses had failed to learn the lessons from the blaze and called on them to 'stop hiding behind the bravery of their frontline firefighters'.\n\nThe Grenfell Tower fire in North Kensington, West London, in June 2017 left 72 people dead and the report marking the end first phase of the public inquiry is out today\n\nLondon Fire Brigade Commissioner Dany Cotton (left today) is retiring at the age of 50 with a \u00a32m pension pot - she has been heavily criticised by the inquiry chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick (right) who called her 'insensitive' and questioned her lack of curiosity on arriving at the inferno\n\nFamilies affected by the Grenfell Tower fire speak during a news conference in London today and said they believed that London Fire Brigade could have saved all 72 people who perished in the blaze. Pictured left to right. Hamdan El Alami, who lost his daughter, son in law and their children, Flora Neda, whose husband Saber died in the fire. Paulos Tekle, whose son Isaac Paulos died, Hamid Al Jafari, Nazanin Aghlani and Shah Aghlani, who lost their mother and finally Nabil Choucaire lost six relatives including his mother, sister and brother in law.\n\nThe campaign group's chairman Natasha Elcock praised the 'strong and fair' report and said: 'You can't say there's nothing you would change when all of these lives were lost'.\n\nShah Aghlani, whose mother Sakina Afrasehabi and aunt Fatima Afrasehabi died in the horror, hit back today: 'For a fire chief to say they wouldn't change anything, they shouldn't be anywhere near commanding a fire service.'\n\nThe group also described the report as 'heartbreaking' and said some relatives of the deceased want senior staff prosecuted.\n\nToday's report into what caused the fire in Grenfell Tower was published this morning and describes the 'lost' 47 minutes where the London Fire Brigade refused to drop its policy preventing people from being evacuated.\n\nInquiry chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick also listed 46 recommendations and a further 42 mistakes made by the London Fire Brigade to help avoid a similar tragedy because of the extraordinary failings that contributed to the fire on June 14 2017.\n\nA team of exhausted firefighters rest at the scene of the blaze in North Kensington in June 2017 - bosses have been accused of throwing them under the bus\n\nSir Martin has also concluded Grenfell's recently installed cladding and insulation was illegal - paving the way for corporate manslaughter prosecutions - saying it was the 'principal' reason for the fire's rapid and 'profoundly shocking' spread up to the top floor in just 30 minutes.\n\nSir Martin Moore-Bick's scathing conclusions over 1,000 pages Sir Martin Moore-Bick, chairman of the Grenfell public inquiry, Cause of blaze It started due to an electrical fault in a fridge-freezer in flat 16 on the fourth floor. Flat owner Behailu Kebede will be absolved of any blame. More than 200 survivors and bereaved families are suing Whirlpool, which supplied the Hotpoint model in the flat. Brigade training The London Fire Brigade's preparation and planning for such a fire was 'gravely inadequate'. Experienced incident commanders had 'no training' on the dangers of combustible cladding or on how to evacuate a high-rise block. At the scene Firefighters displayed 'extraordinary bravery' but incident commanders failed to recognise that a full evacuation may have been necessary. If the decision to evacuate had been made it would have 'resulted in fewer fatalities'. Crucial information was not shared by senior officers. Control room There were 'shortcomings in practice, policy and training'. Call handlers did not always obtain the necessary information and were unaware of when to tell residents to evacuate. Commissioner The report criticises the London Fire Brigade's commissioner for her 'remarkable insensitivity' after she told a hearing in September 2018 she would change nothing about its response to the fire. Inferno's spread The 'principle reason' that the flames spread so quickly up the tower block was due to the rain screen panels which 'acted as a source of fuel'. The insulation boards behind the cladding panels also accelerated the fire's spread. These features were added during a refurbishment several months before the fire. Building design The failures of the building's safety design were 'rapid'. Many lobbies filled with fire 26 minutes after it started. But Sir Martin Moore-Bick said stairs were 'not absolutely impassable' over an hour into it. Regulations The tower's external walls failed to comply with building regulations. There is 'compelling evidence' the walls did not 'accurately resist the spread of fire' but 'actively promoted it'.\n\n55 of the 72 people who died in the West Kensington fire had been told to 'stay put' in their flats inside the 14-storey block before the evacuation was finally ordered at 2.47am - almost two hours after the first 999 call came at 12.54am.\n\nSir Martin said: 'That decision could and should have been made between 1.30am and 1.50am and would be likely to have resulted in fewer fatalities. I have little doubt that fewer people would have died if the order to evacuate had been given by 2.00am. The time between 2.00am and 2.47am was effectively lost'.\n\nSid-Ali Atmani, who escaped from the 15th floor, said today: 'Those in command had opportunity to save everyone in that tower \u2013 we're talking about two hours'.\n\nFlora Neda and her son were the only survivors from top floor after ignoring the stay-put order and fleeing down the stairs to safety. Describing their descent through the smoke and flame she said at a press conference in Westminster today: 'We didn't see anyone, until the 4th floor. That's the first time we saw a firefighter. We told them there's more people upstairs, they said they would go up. But they didn't'.\n\nNazanin Aghlani, who lost two family members in the blaze, called for its top brass to be prosecuted and said: 'I think it's quite evident that the whole LFB is in the hands of people that are incapable of their jobs. They should be discharged of it. They should be prosecuted. I'm not saying individual firemen, they do a hard job - the senior leaders at the top'.\n\nAs the damning report on one of the worst fires in British history was released, it emerged :\n\nChairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick demands root-and-branch changes in 46 recommendations he says are needed to prevent another Grenfell-type disaster;\n\nCombustible cladding turned the 14-storey-block into a 'death trap', but thousands of people are still living in buildings fitted with the panels;\n\nLondon Fire Chief Dany Cotton was heavily criticised by the official report into the tragedy including her 'remarkable insensitivity' in her evidence to the public inquiry in September last year where she insisted she 'would not change anything we did on the night'.

But I hope that findings being published today and the debate we are holding this afternoon will bring some measure of comfort to those who suffered so much.\n\nHe added: 'They asked for the truth, we promised them the truth, we owe them the truth. And today the whole country, the whole world, is finally hearing the truth about what happened at Grenfell Tower on June 14 2017'.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Grenfell was an 'avoidable tragedy' before insisting there is 'genuine love and affection' between the community and the firefighters who risked their lives to help.\n\nHe told the Commons: 'I know nobody is trying to do this today, let's not blame firefighters for their work - they did everything they could and more and well beyond that.'\n\nMr Corbyn also said: 'I think the Grenfell survivors are the heroes of all this.\n\n'Because when you go through a tragedy there is a natural human instinct to try and put it behind you, move away, go off and do something else if you've got that opportunity and choice.\n\n'They haven't done that - they've stayed there, stayed in that community, kept that community together in order that the rest of us might learn the lessons of the pain they went through.'\n\nMr Corbyn also stressed the 'whole truth is not yet with us', with phase two of the report still to come.\n\nSurvivors who fled the burning tower and those who lost loved-ones in the worst fire in Britain for a generation praised the report and its criticism of the London Fire Brigade, whose boss Dany Cotton was singled out for criticism after she insisted she 'would not change anything we did on the night'.\n\nToday the LFB Commissioner, who is retiring next April aged 50 on a \u00a3140,000-a-year pension, said she was 'disappointed' with elements of the report including the naming of senior colleagues on duty that night.\n\nAsked if she would quit, she told the BBC: 'No, I won't. I will retire in six months' time because my commitment is to making those changes, and if I resign I can't do that.'\n\nShe was then asked three times if she would do things differently before admitting she would.\n\nCampaign group Grenfell United said Cotton and other bosses had failed to learn the lessons from the blaze and called on them to 'stop hiding behind the bravery of their frontline firefighters'.\n\nIts chairman Natasha Elcock praised the 'strong and fair' report and said: 'You can't say there's nothing you would change when all of these lives were lost'.\n\nShah Aghlani, whose mother Sakina Afrasehabi and aunt Fatima Afrasehabi died in the horror, hit back today: 'For a fire chief to say they wouldn't change anything, they shouldn't be anywhere near commanding a fire service.'\n\nNabil Choucair, who lost six family members in the fire, said: 'We saw how you (firefighters) failed and should have put the fire out, but knowing that you couldn't tackle a fire that was bigger than you could imagine... you should've implemented a rescue plan a lot earlier. If we could see this and experienced fire commanders could not see this... why could they not see it? Why did they not react? Where was the common sense?'.\n\nGrenfell families react to the bombshell report Grieving relatives of the Grenfell inferno today branded the public inquiry a 'cover up' and called for the prosecution of senior London Fire Brigade officials. Around a dozen held a press conference today to react to the end of phase one of the inquiry into the worst fire in Britain for a generation. This is what they said: Hamdan El Alami, the father of Farah Hamdan, 31, who died in Grenfell Tower with her daughters, Malak, 8, and Leena, aged six months, and her husband Omar Belkadi, 32, sobbed Hamdan El Alami survived the inferno along with his five-year-old grandchild. The 70-year-old lost his daughter, her husband and two grandchildren including an eight-year-old and a six-month old baby who was found in his daughter's arms. He broke down in tears as he pointed to a photo of his daughter and asked 'why?'. He said: 'This is my family. I came here to fight for our families. Please, please support us.' Paulos Tekle, whose son Isaac Paulos died in the Grenfell Tower fire, is seen next to a photograph of his child Paulos Tekle, who lost his son Isaac Paulos, five, in the fire: 'I have been let down by the firefighters on many occasions. A firefighter came to our door, advised us to stay put. He told us 'you are safe' and we trusted the authorities. 'My friend on the other side was advising us to leave but we believed the firefighters who came to our door and told us to stay. 'Every single minute now, I think of that. I was desperate at that time. 'If we were helped properly, my son would be here today and I would not be telling this story. I am living with a picture. Because of our firefighters, we lost our son. 'There were over 200 firefighters on the night. Why didn't they rescue him?' Flora Neda, whose husband Saber died in the fire Disabled Flora Neda was carried down 23 flights of stairs by her 24-year-old son. Her husband Saber Neda died staying behind to help his neighbours who took refuge in their flat. She said: 'We wanted to leave the flat and we locked the flat. When we got to the staircase, suddenly we saw more than 30 people came up the stairs. They said there was a major fire was downstairs and that one of the firefighters had told them to go upstairs because a helicopter was there. 'I have lived in the tower for 20 years and I know every side of the building. I told them there is no way out from the roof to get to the helicopter. 'We used the staircase from the top floor until we reached the ground floor.. None of the firefighters were on the floor to help us' Nabil Choucaire lost six relatives including his mother, sister and brother in law Nabil Choucaire who lost six members of his family - his mother, his sister and her husband, plus three nieces. Mr Choucaire, who was not a Grenfell resident, said: 'This inquiry is one of the biggest and worst cover ups. They have controlled us from what was being said in the pen portraits. 'After losing a family or a loved one, our lives are never going to be the same. We hear Dany Cotton say she would not have done anything differently: do you not learn from what has happened? Do you still accept what has happened? Don't you understand what has happened? 'If you do not change it, we will have another Grenfell. You [LFB] should have implemented a rescue mission a lot earlier, we could see this. 'If we could see this, why could experienced firefighters and their commanders not see it? Why did they not see it? Why did they not react? Where was common sense? 'We asked for the report to be put behind because we did not want it to get put behind an election and Brexit. 'They are trying to hide and cover up what is going on and this is not acceptable.' Nazanin Aghlani, who lost her mother in the Grenfell Tower fire, is seen during a press conference Nazanin Aghlani attended the conference to support her brother whose mother and aunt died in the fire. The 32-year-old said: 'People's lives are in the hands of people who are not capable of the job. 'They should be discharged of it. If a fire went off in my home, I would not even call them because they are not capable. 'They should be scrutinised all the time because they are responsible for a lot of lives and they do not care much. If I went to work and I did not do my job properly and somebody died, I would be prosecuted. They should be prosecuted. That is when we will get justice.' Shah Aghlani lost his mother and aunt in the blaze after firefighters sent them up the tower instead of down Shah Aghlani lost his mother and aunt who died on the 23rd floor of the tower block after they were told by firefighters to go upstairs into the 1,000 degree inferno. He said: 'The LFB has to accept criticism and change. They should accept responsibility for failure and address the shortcomings of their response. 'Firefighters' failure to withdraw the stay put policy caused loss of lives. 'The report found escape was always possible. Evacuation was possible - they just gave up too early.\n\nIn his eviscerating report, Sir Martin Moore-Bick said the fire service's planning for a high-rise fire was 'gravely inadequate' and ignored lessons from the Lakanal House blaze of 2009 where five died in similar circumstances.\n\nHe said: 'It had failed to learn the lessons of the Lakanal House fire. But at the same time I find that, following the refurbishment, the external walls of the building did not comply with the Building Regulations because they did not adequately resist the spread of fire over them. On the contrary, they promoted it.'\n\nSurvivors of the Grenfell Tower fire have welcomed a damning report that said London Fire Brigade (LFB) breached national guidelines through 'gravely inadequate' preparation.\n\nSir Martin Moore-Bick said the absence of a plan to evacuate the tower was a 'major omission' by the LFB and more lives could have been saved had the 'stay-put' policy been abandoned sooner.\n\nNobody has been prosecuted in the wake of the fire and with phase 2 of the inquiry on the technical aspects of the building expected to be completed in 2022, police are expected to wait until then to swoop, disappointing survivors and grieving relatives of the dead demanding justice.\n\nJustice 4 Grenfell said some of the recommendations could have been made earlier, and that they feared those most accountable may be let 'off the hook'.\n\nThe evidence from the first phase of the inquiry 'strongly suggests' that 'stay-put' was an 'article of faith within the LFB so powerful that to depart from it was to all intents and purposes unthinkable', he said.\n\nThe Grenfell Tower cladding did not comply with building regulations and was the 'principal' reason for the fire's rapid and 'profoundly shocking' spread, the inquiry report said.\n\nOnce the fire had taken hold of the building's exterior, it was 'inevitable' that it would find its way inside, Sir Martin said.\n\nHowever, because there was no attempt to carry out a managed evacuation of the tower, this is less significant than the lack of training to help incident commanders recognise when this might be necessary, he said.\n\nHisam Choucair, who lost six relatives, said: 'I welcome the report, it's long awaited. It's the truth, for the findings in phase one, it's a step in the right direction.\n\n'It's opened up a serious amount of questions for organisations, government to answer - and to tell the truth with regards to what happened, and for things to change.'\n\nShah Aghlani, whose mother Sakina Afrasehabi and aunt Fatima Afrasehabi died in the fire, said 'cultural change' was needed within the London Fire Brigade (LFB).\n\nHe said 'I think today everyone who has been in charge of the LFB should examine their role' and act to bring about the 'change that's so badly needed'.\n\nRukayet Mamudu, 71, escaped from the building in her dressing gown carrying her adopted 12-year-old son Tyrshondre.\n\nShe told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme: 'I think the report was very thorough and we appreciate what Moore-Bick has done, and he has given us a room for hope to move forward, to be able to face phase two.\n\n'Because he has done, I must say, a thorough job, and we appreciate it. Thank you very much.'\n\nMahad Egal, who escaped from the fourth floor, said: 'This is the beginning of the truth. It took the necessary time that it needed to, but the results, the right results we've been hoping for.\n\n'Most important, it's very important to all of us - grieving survivors and residents and the community - that our neighbour from Flat 16 has been exonerated from any sort of blame. That itself is an absolute relief.\n\n'We are very pleased with the judge in terms of the thorough inspection which he has carried out with the inquiry team. This is a Pandora's Box now, so we look forward to phase two.'\n\nLondon Fire Brigade Commissioner Dany Cotton has been criticised in the report.\n\nShe said: 'We will now carefully and fully consider all of Sir Martin Moore-Bick's Phase 1 report and take every action we can to improve public safety.\n\n'Many of the recommendations are welcome and will need to be fully understood not only by London Fire Brigade, but by Government, every fire and rescue service and every residential building owner and manager across the country.\n\n'The report is focused on our response and it is right for our actions to be fully examined by the inquiry.\n\n'We welcome the chairman's recognition of the courage, commitment and bravery of firefighters on the night.\n\n'But we are disappointed at some of the criticism of individual staff members who were placed in completely unprecedented circumstances and faced the most unimaginable conditions while trying to save the lives of others.\n\n'On the evacuation of Grenfell Tower we note the chairman states he has received no expert evidence to guide him on reaching his conclusion and that a qualitative judgment on the brigade's approach might be better reserved for Phase 2.'\n\nMs Cotton said many recommendations were welcome and would be 'carefully and fully' considered by senior officers.\n\nShe has resisted multiple calls for her to resign, and said the brigade was 'fully cooperating' with the police.\n\nAsked about accusations she was 'criminally negligent', Ms Cotton told Sky News: 'I think it is right that the police are the ones who will look into that.'\n\nShe added that she regrets causing offence to those directly affected by the fire over her comments during the inquiry that she would change nothing about her team's response on the night.\n\nMatt Wrack, general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union, said there was 'no way of knowing if evacuation could have saved more lives' and it could have led to further fatalities.\n\nHe said: 'We strongly refute the report's assertion that it would have been possible or safe to evacuate more than 150 people via a narrow, smoke-logged stairwell with just 30 firefighters. There is no evidence to suggest that this was possible.'\n\nHe added that the order in which the inquiry has investigated issues has been 'entirely wrong' and it was prioritising scrutiny of firefighters over 'the critical issues of public safety'.\n\nNobody has been charged with any offences since the inferno in June 2017 - despite Grenfell being encased in flammable cladding that acted like a giant firelighter when the blaze started because of a faulty fridge in a fourth floor flat.\n\nBut today's report only marks the end of phase one of the probe - with phase two set to take another two years from January 2020 and detectives unlikely to charge those responsible until it finishes.\n\nDamningly, the report says lessons had not been learnt from the Lakanal House fire of 2009. Three women and three children died in that high-rise blaze in Camberwell, South London which bore many similar traits and where victims were also told to stay put.\n\nHamdan El Alami survived the inferno along with his five-year-old grandchild. The 70-year-old lost his daughter, her husband and two grandchildren including an eight-year-old and a six-month old baby who was found in his daughter's arms\n\nFlora Neda and her son were the only survivors from top floor but said firefighters refused to go above the fourth floor - her husband Saber died\n\nNazanin Aghlani, who lost her mother in fire, called for an overhaul of the senior leadership of the LFB, and called for its top brass to be prosecuted\n\nRelatives of victims of the Grenfell Tower fire pose with pictures during a news conference in London this afternoon\n\nPictures of Grenfell's dead, including many children, surrounded the landmark report that demands changes to how high-rise fires are fought\n\nKarim Mussilhy, vice-chairman Grenfell United, who lost his uncle in the blaze, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme: 'We welcome it. It's strong, it's long awaited.\n\nGrenfell's cladding was illegal and was 'principal reason' tower was engulfed in 30 minutes Grenfell Tower in West London burns hours after the blaze swept through it in June 2017 - its cladding sped up the fire and helped it spread upwards The use of combustible materials in the refurbishment of London's Grenfell Tower was central to the catastrophic chain of events in June 2017, the official inquiry said. The blaze at Grenfell Tower, a 23-storey social housing block owned by one of London's richest local authorities, shocked Britain and threw up a range of disturbing questions about how the building had been allowed to become a tinderbox. 'In its origin, the fire at Grenfell Tower was no more than a typical kitchen fire,' wrote Martin Moore-Bick, chairman of a public inquiry into the disaster, in a report on the first phase of investigations which focused on events on the night of the blaze. Having broken out late at night in a fourth-floor flat because of an electrical fault in a refrigerator, the fire spread to the outside of the building and raced up its facade, which had been fitted with a type of combustible aluminium composite material cladding during a refurbishment completed in 2016. Within 17 minutes of the first call to emergency services by the tenant of the fourth-floor flat, the fire had reached the 22nd floor, and six minutes after that it had reached the roof. From there, it engulfed the whole tower, reducing it to a charred ruin by morning. Moore-Bick said there was compelling evidence that the external walls did not comply with building regulations because of the cladding and insulation material fitted between it and the original concrete wall. 'They did not adequately resist the spread of fire having regard to the height, use and position of the building. On the contrary, they actively promoted it,' he wrote.\n\n'Sir Martin Moore-Bick has been very quiet throughout the inquiry, listening and hearing to everything, and this was his opportunity to come out strong and really set the tone for phase two and to restore some confidence back - not only in us, survivors and bereaved, but also the community and the rest of the country to a certain extent.\n\n'So we welcome this report and we think its findings are very strong. For me, what stands out the most is the building was illegal.\n\n'As of 2016, after the refurbishment was done, that building should not have been lived in. It was a death trap.\n\n'All of the people that were involved in the refurbishment and the management of that building will have to answer some serious questions.\n\n'Someone somewhere broke the law, and phase two will be about who broke the law. And hopefully this will bring some accountability.'\n\nThe report, which was leaked yesterday, found that systemic failures by the LFB increased the number of deaths because it told residents to 'stay put' in flats for almost two hours after the first 999 call.\n\nMiss Cotton was lambasted in the report for 'remarkable insensitivity' in her evidence to the public inquiry in September last year.\n\nSir Martin Moore-Bick, a retired judge who chaired the inquiry, said her attitude meant the brigade was at risk of failing to learn the lessons from Grenfell. He also highlighted her apparent lack of curiosity on arriving at the inferno at around 3am on June 14, 2017.\n\nShe was told the notorious 'stay-put' advice had just been abandoned, but asked no follow-up questions. Miss Cotton, whose annual pay package is worth \u00a3234,000, provoked anger when she told the inquiry she 'would not change anything we did on the night'.\n\nThe 50-year-old fire chief is retiring in April on a full pension estimated to be worth up to \u00a32million after 32 years of service. She will have served as commissioner for three years and three months \u2013 six years fewer than her predecessor, Ron Dobson, who continued until he was 57.\n\nMiss Cotton, who became the fire brigade's first female commissioner in 2017, has previously compared the sight of flames ripping through the tower block to a 'disaster movie'. She said the fire was 'the most difficult thing' she had dealt with in her career, saying that she has suffered memory loss and received counselling.\n\nIn her testimony, she also claimed no training could have prepared the fire crews, saying: 'I wouldn't develop a training package for a space shuttle to land in front of the Shard.'\n\nSir Martin's report describes the lack of training at the fire services as an 'institutional' failure. He concludes: 'Quite apart from its remarkable insensitivity to the families of the deceased and to those who escaped, the commissioner's evidence that she would not change anything about the response of the LFB, even with hindsight, serves to demonstrate that the LFB is an institution at risk of not learning the lessons of the fire.'\n\nA graphic showing the people who died on the various floors of Grenfell Tower, most of whom were told not to leave their flats\n\nHe also says Miss Cotton's evidence 'betrayed an unwillingness to confront the fact that by 2017 the LFB knew (even if she personally did not) that there was a more than negligible risk of a serious fire in a high-rise building with a cladding system'.\n\nGrenfell judge dismisses 'fanciful' claim by Hotpoint owner that a cigarette could have started the fatal blaze The judge leading the Grenfell Tower inquiry has dismissed a 'fanciful' claim by a corporation that the fire could have been sparked by a discarded lit cigarette. The owner of Hotpoint, which produces the fridge-freezer where the Grenfell Tower fire originated, previously suggested it could have been started by an 'alternative source of ignition' falling into the kitchen through an open window. But the report today confirmed that the blaze was started by a fridge freezer as it dismissed the claims by Whirlpool. Hotpoint produces the fridge-freezer where the Grenfell fire began Rajiv Menon, who represents the occupant of the fourth-floor flat where the fire began, said at the time that Whirlpool Corporation's claim was 'desperate' and 'pure speculation'. In his report, inquiry chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick said the explanation was not convincing or consistent with the evidence heard in the first phase. He wrote: 'Whirlpool's suggestion that the fire could have originated from a burning cigarette end thrown from a window higher up the building falling into the kitchen of Flat 16 and igniting unknown materials on the floor next to the large fridge-freezer is fanciful.' Sir Martin said he had 'no doubt' that the fire was started by an electrical fault in the fridge-freezer, but that he had been unable to establish its precise nature. But he said fires originating in electrical domestic appliances were not uncommon and the important question was 'how an ordinary domestic fire could have had such catastrophic consequences for the whole building and its occupants'. He continued: 'What really matters is that the design of the refurbishment, the choice of materials and the manner of construction allowed an ordinary kitchen fire to escape into the cladding with disastrous consequences. 'How this state of affairs came about is for investigation in Phase 2, but at this stage I accept the evidence of all three experts that, if a fire started near a window, there was a disproportionately high chance of its spreading into the cladding, given the configuration and materials of the windows and of exterior cladding.'\n\nMiss Cotton joined the brigade aged 18 as one of 30 female London firefighters.\n\nFire officers in London were briefed on the dangers of blazes within cladding less than a year before the Grenfell Tower inferno, the inquiry report revealed today.\n\nSome 59 senior officers are thought to have attended the presentation in July 2016, 11 months before the blaze which killed 72 people in West London in June 2017.\n\nA copy of the London Fire Brigade's Tall Building Facades presentation revealed as part of the inquiry shows how fire can rapidly spread through a high-rise block.\n\nThe Powerpoint presentation says flames 'spread up over or through the cladding' and can 'extend over 2m (6ft) above window opening regardless of cladding'.\n\nOther diagrams show the flames can spread through cavities in tower blocks and technical guidance over the use of combustible cladding materials on buildings.\n\nThe presentation also points to previous major fires in cities such as Baku, Shanghai and Dubai - as well as some in the UK including Garnock Court in Glasgow in 1999.\n\nThe presentation also includes references to estimating how flames spread across cladding or insulation and various diagrams and photographs showing tests.\n\nToday's damning report by Sir Martin Moore-Bick found there 'appears to have been a failure properly to understand the risk of cladding fires in high-rise buildings'.\n\nIt said this was 'despite the fact that by 2017 many buildings of a similar kind in other countries had suffered fires in cladding, some of which had been well publicised'.\n\nThe report adds that some senior officers in the LFB 'had become aware of the risk, as appears from the Tall Building Facades presentation'.\n\nThe 935-page report into events on the night wass published today.\n\nSir Martin makes 46 recommendations following a two-year investigation. He says the 'principal reason' why the flames shot up the 24-storey high rise was the combustible aluminium cladding used in the refurbishment.\n\nThe report also concludes the fire started as the result of an 'electrical fault in a large fridge-freezer' in a fourth floor flat.\n\nPart two of the inquiry examining the circumstances and causes of the disaster begins in January. An LFB spokesman said it would be 'inappropriate' to comment on the findings ahead of its official release.\n\nFirefighters claimed yesterday that they are being made scapegoats after an official report into the Grenfell disaster condemned the actions of the London Fire Brigade.\n\nThey said that those who raced up the burning tower 'merely did their best to save lives' and that the 'real culprits are yet to be held to account'.\n\nAnd a fire union chief said the inquiry was 'back to front' because firefighters were being criticised ahead of those responsible for wrapping the building in flammable cladding.\n\nThe first part of the report into the tragedy concluded that systemic failures by the LFB caused a greater number of deaths.\n\nIt found that the slavish adherence to the controversial 'stay put' policy by fire chiefs prevented residents from escaping.\n\nBut firefighters said that the policy was introduced by the Government and accused ministers of evading criticism.\n\nThe 72 confirmed victims who died in the Grenfell Tower fire.

The Lakanal House blaze in July 2009 killed six people and injured at least 20 more when flames ripped through the 14-storey block in South London. But the report by chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick found the LFB 'failed to learn the lessons of the Lakanal House fire', such as the danger of assuming crews would always reach callers. The report also claimed senior fire officers did not understand the risks of cladding despite being trained about the topic. Flames ripped through the 14-storey block in South London in 2009 London Fire Commissioner Dany Cotton infamously told the inquiry that preparing for Grenfell would have been akin to preparing for landing a spaceship on the Shard. But Sir Martin said this evidence 'only serves to demonstrate that the LFB is an institution at risk of not learning the lessons of the Grenfell Tower fire'. In a pre-recorded video message, Sir Martin said: 'I consider that these represent significant systemic failings in the organisation or the LFB and show that it had failed to learn the lessons of the Lakanal House fire. 'But at the same time I find that, following the refurbishment, the external walls of the building did not comply with the Building Regulations because they did not adequately resist the spread of fire over them. On the contrary, they promoted it.' Grenfell United said senior firefighters had failed to learn the lessons from the Lakanal House blaze and called on them to 'stop hiding behind the bravery of their frontline firefighters'. The group said: 'While nothing can ever bring back our loved ones that passed away in the fire, this is a strong report with a forensic examination of the events of the night and clear recommendations that if implemented will save lives. 'The Government cannot afford to repeat the mistakes of Lakanal and ignore them. Justice means different things for all of us but the truth needs to be at the heart of our collective healing. We have been waiting a long time for this report.' Deborah Coles, of charity Inquest which advises people on state-related deaths, said: 'The residents of Grenfell Tower were catastrophically failed before, during and after the fire. 'Key findings of this report are strikingly similar to those which followed the Lakanal House fire in 2009. Had previous recommendations been implemented, those in Grenfell Tower may have been safe.'\n\nLocal Labour MP Emma Dent Coad has said residents would be relieved that the report had found the building was non-compliant.\n\nHowever she said there was nothing in it that would prevent such a tragedy happening again.\n\n'We seem to have the worst fire safety regulations in western Europe as far as I can see,' she told a Westminster news conference.\n\n'All we are doing is telling our firefighters to be better trained. We can't allow people to continue living in unsafe buildings until in about a year-and-a-half we get further recommendations.\n\n'It is very frustrating. The management and maintenance of that building is pretty shocking.'\n\nShadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the 'finger of blame' for the Grenfell Tower fire should be pointed at Kensington and Chelsea Council and at the Government for its policy of 'light touch' regulation.\n\nShe said the priority now should be to remove cladding from similar buildings, with the Government taking responsibility to make sure it happened if landlords refused.\n\n'I believe the finger of blame points to Kensington and Chelsea Council and the Government,' she told a Westminster news conference.\n\n'The cladding was the real problem. The people who need to be held responsible are the people who commissioned that cladding, the people who signed off on that cladding and the people who failed to regulate the construction of that building properly.'\n\nShe added: 'The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea should be ashamed of their long-standing neglect of this part of the borough.'\n\nDeborah Coles, of charity Inquest which advises people on state-related deaths, said: 'The residents of Grenfell Tower were catastrophically failed before, during and after the fire.\n\n'Key findings of this report are strikingly similar to those which followed the Lakanal House fire in 2009. Had previous recommendations been implemented, those in Grenfell Tower may have been safe.\n\n'This fire was predictable and preventable. A national oversight mechanism is urgently needed, to ensure official recommendations from inquiries and inquests are systematically followed up.\n\n'The lasting legacy of Grenfell must be structural change. This requires meaningful action from the inquiry and government, to ensure those affected are not failed once again.'\n\nAppliance firm Whirlpool faces a multi-million pound legal fight after the Grenfell report found a faulty fridge-freezer sparked the inferno.\n\nInvestigators were unable to establish the exact nature of the electrical failure in the Hotpoint machine, supplied by the US manufacturer, but the report said Behailu Kebede, who lived in the fourth-floor flat where the blaze started, was not to blame.\n\nThe 'relatively modest' fire engulfed the building after burning through into the tower's combustible cladding.\n\nMore than 200 survivors and bereaved families are suing Whirlpool in what lawyers have called 'one of the largest product liability cases in history'. The action is also against cladding and insulation suppliers Arconic and Celotex. During the public inquiry, Whirlpool was accused of a 'desperate' attempt to dodge blame by suggesting the fire could have been caused by a cigarette.\n\nRajiv Menon QC, lawyer for Mr Kebede, called it a 'transparent attempt by a multinational corporation to try to avoid liability and minimise reputational damage and financial loss'.\n\nThe report's findings come after Whirlpool finally agreed to recall up to 800,000 potentially lethal tumble dryers in July. It had offered to modify at-risk machines \u2013 but the Daily Mail highlighted cases where fires started in dryers after they were fixed.", "description": "The former prime minister was seen berating several Conservative MPs on the benches around her during PMQs this afternoon as they ribbed Mr Corbyn about his green tie.", "authors": ["Martin Robinson", "Chief Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/15/20384050-0-image-a-118_1572450856789.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
