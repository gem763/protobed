Toss with 2tbsp of olive oil and sea salt \u2013 about \u00bdtsp. Place in the preheated oven. Roast for about 20-25 minutes \u2013 until the squash is nicely browned.\n\nWhile the squash is roasting, heat the other 2tbsp of the olive oil in a deep, lidded-casserole or soup pot. Add the chopped red onion, cover and allow to sweat over medium heat until soft but not brown, about 10 minutes. Crush the cumin and coriander seeds with a mortar and pestle or in a spice mill. Add to the softened onions along with the turmeric and minced garlic. Stir and cook for another few minutes.\n\nAdd the squash to the onion mixture, stir and pour over about 400ml of the vegetable stock. Cover and cook until the squash is tender \u2013 about 10-15 minutes. Blitz with a handheld stick blender or in a regular blender until smooth. Add the remaining stock as needed. The soup should be thick but pourable.\n\nTo make the crispy cavolo nero, remove and discard the ribs. Cut the leaves into thin strips. Wash and spin dry. Heat the olive oil in a non-stick frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the cavolo nero \u2013 it will spit so be careful or use a splash guard. Fry for a minute until crispy. Remove and place the cavolo nero on a piece of kitchen towel to drain.\n\nIf serving with the coconut yoghurt, mix the yoghurt with the lime juice. If not, simply add the lime juice to the soup right before serving. Spoon out the soup, top with some of the cavolo nero and drizzle with the lime-coconut yoghurt and chilli pepper, if using. Serve hot.\n\nAll photos Julia Platt Leonard\n\n@juliapleonard", "description": "Roasting vegetables brings out a sweetness and complexity that boiling can\u2019t.
