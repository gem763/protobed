Since it is a herbivore, it won\u2019t hurt me! I also think they are adorable and imagine they\u2019d be well-behaved. It would be nice to have a companion that could protect me if I\u2019m ever in danger.\n\nSylvia Wong Yuen-kei, 13, S.K.H. Tsang Shiu Tim Secondary School\n\nOf course I\u2019d choose a T-Rex. They are one of the strongest dinosaurs and would be able to dominate any animal on earth. My pet T-Rex would protect me and my friends from danger if they were in trouble. I would also be able to ride him wherever I want and would never need to spend money on public transport again.\n\nLeung Tsun-man, 13, Fung Kai Liu Man Shek Tong Secondary school\n\nThe 7 weirdest animals you need to know about\n\nI would choose the robot dinosaur from the movie Transformers and I\u2019d call it Metal Boi. It would be great to have it as a pet because it can run, fly and swim, so getting around the city would be super convenient. I think everyone would be jealous of my dinosaur.\n\nTsang Tsun-yin, 14, Kwok Tak Seng Catholic\n\nI\u2019d pick an Allosaurus. They are around 23-25 feet long, which is the perfect size for me to ride on to go to school. They also have powerful arms and big claws that would be perfect for farming. My family could use the dinosaur to help us grow fruit and vegetables. They aren\u2019t fast runners so it would stay around and protect my family as well.\n\nChristy Liu Tsz-yau, 12, Immaculate Heart of Mary College\n\nTriceratops are herbivores but that doesn't mean they are helpless. Photo: AP\n\nI\u2019d pick an Apatosaurus. They are the kind, herbivorous type of dinosaur, so I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about it eating me. I also love that it has a big body that I could sleep on and would no longer need a bed.\n\nAngela Wong, 13, S.K.H. Tang Shiu Tim Secondary School\n\nI\u2019d pick a Spinosaurus. It has large sail-like spine on its back, and a special pattern on its body. Its arms are also a lot smaller than its legs, which I think is cute. I also like its crocodile-like snout. I would take so many pictures with it if it were my pet!\n\nCarrie Li Tsz-yan, 14, Kwok Tak Seng Catholic Secondary School\n\nIf Jurassic Park were real, would you visit it?\n\nI\u2019d choose a Stegosaurus because it is my favourite animal. It is the dinosaur that inspired the Godzilla monster, but it\u2019s actually a harmless creature that only eats plants. The spikes on its back looks like dinner plates standing on their sides to me, which I think looks quite funny.\n\nLee Tsz-long, 12, Scientia Secondary School\n\nI\u2019d choose an Ankylosaurus. They are a type of armoured dinosaur and have multiple rows of spikes on their backs. I think they are the coolest looking dinosaurs that ever existed, and I would love to take one to school with me. No bully would dare to come close to me, but my secret would be that they only eat plants and are quite gentle creatures.\n\nZoe So Tsz-yau, 12, Immaculate Heart of Mary College\n\nPalaeontology requires knowledge in Stem, and other things Jurassic Park never told you about being a palaeontologist\n\nA Psittacosaurus because it is roughly the size of a Labrador Retriever dog, so I could play with it and take it for walks outside. Its head is similar to a parrot\u2019s and I think it looks quite cute. Another cool thing about this dinosaur is that it can change the colour of its skin to match its surroundings\n\nLily Fong, 14, Scientia Secondary School\n\nI\u2019d want a Brontosaurus because they are tall like me. Of course, in comparison, it is much taller than I am. If I had one as a pet, I could ride on its head and get a great view wherever I go. I also wouldn\u2019t need to take the elevator up and down my apartment.\n\nWarwick Lai , 16 , Fung Kai Liu Man Shek Tong Secondary School", "description": "From the ferocious T-Rex to the peaceful triceratops, here are the dinos that teens want to befriend.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/ec25a686-e667-11e9-8a10-b9721f28293eimagehires133121.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
