Her main reason for calling a vote stems from Republicans saying the Democrats' impeachment inquiry isn't an actual inquiry because the full House has yet to vote and authorize various Committees to investigate.\n\nFor weeks, Republicans have called on Pelosi to bring about a vote on the Impeachment inquiry. Pelosi has avoided the move as a means of protecting Democrats in districts that voted for President Trump in 2016 because then there's no solid record of the representative supporting the impeachment inquiry.\n\nRepublicans blasted Pelosi for her sudden decision, saying she's finally admitting that the process was never right from the get-go.\n\nIt\u2019s been 34 days since Nancy Pelosi unilaterally declared her impeachment inquiry.\n\n\n\nToday\u2019s backtracking is an admission that this process has been botched from the start.\n\n\n\nWe will not legitimize the Schiff/Pelosi sham impeachment. \u2014 Kevin McCarthy (@GOPLeader) October 28, 2019\n\nPelosi let Schiff hold secret hearings and leak misleading info to attack @realDonaldTrump for weeks.\n\n\n\nNow she wants a vote to \"formalize\u201d a process that\u2019s already tainted.\n\n\n\nDems aren't trying to change their Soviet-style impeachment process, they're formally endorsing it. \u2014 Steve Scalise (@SteveScalise) October 28, 2019\n\nPelosi announces they\u2019ll finally vote to open the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\n\nCodifying a sham process halfway through doesn\u2019t make it any less of a sham process. \u2014 Rep. Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) October 28, 2019\n\nPelosi now says there will be a vote Thu to authorize their impeachment inquiry. This should include minority subpoena rights, equal allocat. of staff, immediate release of all transcripts & more. POTUS' counsel should be able to attend depos, present evidence & quest. witnesses. \u2014 Lee Zeldin (@RepLeeZeldin) October 28, 2019\n\nRepublicans have taken issue with House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) leading the impeachment inquiry efforts because of his clear disdain for President Trump. For more than two years he continually told Americans he had the \"smoking gun\" that would prove the Trump campaign colluded with Russia. Special Counsel Robert Mueller, the very guy Democrats handpicked to lead the Russia probe, found there was no collusion.\n\nOnce Pelosi gave Schiff the green light to begin an impeachment inquiry, Schiff flat out lied about what Trump said during his call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Republicans have argued he cannot be impartial in this situation.\n\nHouse Democrats now suddenly saying they'll vote on an impeachment resolution to \u201censure transparency\u201d is rich\u2014considering they've spent weeks conducting interviews in secret, leaking their own talking points while locking down any and all information that benefits the President \u2014 Mark Meadows (@RepMarkMeadows) October 28, 2019\n\nWe\u2019ve just learned House Democrats are moving the public impeachment hearings to the Intelligence Committee \u2014 taking it out of the normal jurisdiction (Judiciary Committee), cutting out GOP members who have spent the majority of time questioning witnesses till now\n\n\n\nThis is a sham \u2014 Mark Meadows (@RepMarkMeadows) October 28, 2019\n\nA live look at House Democrats trying to impeach President @realDonaldTrump. First Russia, then obstruction, now Ukraine. Dems are throwing spaghetti at the wall and hoping something sticks. pic.twitter.com/68Ec0KXslz \u2014 Congresswoman Debbie Lesko (@RepDLesko) October 28, 2019\n\nSpeaker Pelosi's announcement today acknowledges Adam Schiff\u2019s free-wheeling impeachment inquiry is devoid of rules and lacks legitimacy. Schiff\u2019s anarchic impeachment sham has devolved into mayhem and is entirely antithetical to constitutional principles. \u2014 Rep. Matt Gaetz (@RepMattGaetz) October 28, 2019\n\nSen. Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-SC) believes Pelosi made the announcement because of a resolution he introduced that required Congress to provide Trump with due process.\n\nA vote now is a bit like un-Ringing a bell as House Democrats have selectively leaked information in order to damage President @realDonaldTrump for weeks.https://t.co/tSmlvI6Ivt \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 28, 2019\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that the overwhelming response House Democrats heard from the American people and Senate Republicans in support of my resolution forced their hand.\n\n\n\nToday\u2019s announcement is an acknowledgement of the success of our efforts last week. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 28, 2019\n\nThe American people have been outraged by the unfair nature and lack of due process House Dems have given to Pres Trump.\n\n\n\nI take pride in the fact our vigorous response to their underhanded tactics ended up making their position untenable. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 28, 2019\n\nToday, they were forced to change course. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 28, 2019\n\nFinally, I look forward to reviewing their proposal and ensuring it provides President Trump with the rights and privileges Republicans afforded former President Clinton during the 1998 impeachment process. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 28, 2019\n\nDemocrats launched their bogus impeachment inquiry the night before President Trump released the transcript of his call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. They claimed Trump threatened to withhold military aid if Ukraine failed to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, for corruption. While Biden was vice president and handling internal relations in Ukraine on behalf of the Obama administration, Hunter was being paid $50,000 by a Ukrainian gas company, despite having no natural energy experience. The transcript showed no quid pro quo.", "description": ".10/28/2019 20:16:08PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Cortney O'Brien", "Julio Rosas", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/60/1dc830bb-7654-46e6-aad1-79b4a1bad22f.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
