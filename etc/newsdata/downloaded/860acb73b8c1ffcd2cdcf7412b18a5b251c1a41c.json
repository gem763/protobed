The private school enrolls kids ages 2 through 11, charging from $26,000 up to $48,000\u2014a pricetag on par with the annual tuition at an elite university.\n\nOne of the three WeWork co-founders, Neumann is a woman who wears many hats. Beyond being the wife of WeWork\u2019s much-maligned ex-CEO Adam Neumann, she is\u2014or was\u2014co-founder and \u201cchief brand and impact officer\u201d at WeWork\u2019s parent company. Neumann left the company this week amidst her husband\u2019s investor-mounted corporate ouster, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nAdam Neumann faced scrutiny over a number of eyebrow-raising moves, including leasing properties he owned to the company for millions and cashing out a conspicuous $700 million in advance of the company\u2019s now ill-fated IPO.\n\nWeWork, valued at $47 billion earlier this year, could now be worth as little as $10 billion\u2014a remarkably swift fall from grace for a company that was on top of the world.\n\nNeumann is also the first-cousin of Goop empress Gwyneth Paltrow, who personally interviewed Neumann in a video Q&A for Goop, promoting WeGrow as an educational refuge for \u201cfamilies that are in an open state of being.\u201d\n\nDepending on how the cards fall, that open state of being could have a limited tenure.\n\nWeGrow\u2019s parent company is reportedly mulling laying off a third of the company\u2019s workforce or shuttering WeWork\u2019s side businesses to cut costs. WeWork, which picked up around 20 companies since 2016, is already reportedly putting three recent acquisitions up for sale.\n\nWith its yogic founder and CEO out, either option could leave WeGrow in the crosshairs as the company tightens its belt ahead of a now-delayed public offering. A spokesperson for the Neumanns declined to comment.\n\nWeGrow\u2019s chaos hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed in New York\u2019s hypercompetitive schooling environment, which grooms kids for success from a tender age.\n\n\u201c Be wary of sending your kid to a school run by a company that\u2019s in financial trouble. Did Lehmann Brothers ever have a school? Enron? \u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t recommend a school like this because I\u2019m not sure it\u2019ll be open next year,\u201d said Amanda Uhry, founder and CEO of Manhattan Private School Advisors, which consults with New York parents on where to send their children to school. \u201cNone of our clients are applying now. They don\u2019t know if the school will be open tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cBe wary of sending your kid to a school run by a company that\u2019s in financial trouble. Did Lehman Brothers ever have a school? Enron?\u201d Uhry asked.\n\nNew schools rarely stay open long in New York City, according to Uhry. It\u2019s hard to compete with the likes of Fieldston, Dalton, Collegiate, and other private schools that have operated for a century or more. According to Uhry, kids are the \u201ccollateral\u201d when a for-profit school fails to create a sustainable business.\n\nShe\u2019s not alone in expressing concerns over WeGrow.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t recommend a family go to unproven schools unless they are committed to the educational vision, a few of the founding teachers, and at least eight families willing to stay as a cohort so they\u2019re sure it\u2019s sustainable. The bar is high,\u201d said Sharon Thompson, CEO of the school consultancy Dream Workshop, which helps parents steer their children through New York\u2019s \u201ceducation maze.\u201d\n\nMax Mets, a partner at New York Private School Consultants, added that his company would not recommend families send their children to WeGrow, noting that the school\u2019s track record is far from proven.\n\n\u201cWe recommend they apply to places with a demonstrated history of placement at top New York schools,\u201d Mets said. \u201cWeGrow doesn\u2019t have that.\u201d\n\nA COSMIC EDUCATION\n\nWeWork\u2019s high-minded experiment in private schooling is nestled next to the company\u2019s Manhattan headquarters in Chelsea. On its website, the company shows off its designer space, a mix of smooth \u201csuper-elliptic\u201d wooden play pods, \u201cacoustic clouds\u201d (large, mitochondrial lighting fixtures), and other zen-like modern touches, but the school appears to be in disarray.\n\nThe school welcomed its first class in 2018, though it\u2019s unclear how many students are currently enrolled. The part of the website dedicated to conveying information to parents was full of placeholder text and blank images Wednesday afternoon. No one answered WeGrow\u2019s front-desk line Wednesday, and the company\u2019s voicemail was full.\n\nWeGrow\u2019s curriculum is Montessori mixed with New Age: a yoga routine called WePractice; \u201cmentorship\u201d by WeWork employees and members; music circles; vegetarian meals; farming (at an estate the Neumanns own), and \u201csix pillars of growth\u201d\u2014mind, body, soul, conscious creators, arts, nature. One description of classes declares, \u201cThis is a cosmic education!\u201d\n\nPrior to opening its doors last year, WeWork picked up a startup called MissionU that billed itself as a one-year alternative to a traditional college education. Under the terms of the deal, MissionU founder Adam Braun joined WeGrow as the company\u2019s chief operating officer. Braun is still listed as WeGrow COO on the company\u2019s website, though WeGrow\u2019s plan for leadership post-Neumann remains unclear.\n\nBeyond WeGrow, the We Company owns other We-branded side businesses: a gym named Rise by We, and a dormitory-style housing unit dubbed WeLive. The company has previously made similar multimillion-dollar investments on the whims of its CEO, including a wave-pool maker and a food company owned by a surfer Adam Neumann met on vacation.\n\nTrainers for Rise by We did not respond to requests for comment, and a WeWork spokesperson declined to comment on the fate of any of the company\u2019s ventures.\n\nFor Uhry, WeGrow\u2019s fate is far from certain.\n\n\u201cDo I think WeGrow\u2019s going to last? No. Do I think any of them are, the new 21st-century schools like AltSchool and Avenues will last? No,\u201d Uhry said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard parents love [WeGrow], though. The kids are learning Hebrew! They\u2019re learning to garden! Isn\u2019t that great? It\u2019s only great if the school stays open.\u201d", "description": "With its parent company in chaos, education consultants say stay away: \u201cNone of our clients are applying now.
