To the contrary, we have been as loud as possible, for as long as possible, and we intend to keep it that way,\u201d said John Donnelly, a senior writer for CQ Roll Call who is also the chairman of the National Press Club\u2019s Press Freedom Committee.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe also directed words at Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, holding him responsible for Khashoggi\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cYou may think you have impunity for your crime and the world will forget and move on,\u201d Donnelly said. \u201cBut as long as Jamal\u2019s fellow reporters have anything to say about it, his inspirational life and his awful death at your bloody hands will never be forgotten.\u201d\n\nAt Istanbul memorial for Jamal Khashoggi, silence and shouts for justice\n\nKhashoggi, a veteran journalist and contributing columnist for The Washington Post, was killed in Istanbul after walking into the Saudi Consulate on Oct. 2, 2018, as he sought documents in preparation for his marriage. Khashoggi was never seen alive again, and his remains have never been recovered.\n\nAD\n\nThe vigil in Washington was organized by the Committee to Protect Journalists, which is suing the U.S. government for the release of documents that could show whether the intelligence community had information on threats to Khashoggi, said Courtney Radsch, advocacy director for the group.\n\nAD\n\nNine other journalism and human rights groups also sponsored the event in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood.\n\nPhilippe Nassif, advocacy director for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International, said Khashoggi\u2019s killing represented a pattern and practice by a regime that currently imprisons about 30 journalists and dissenters, who have reported being tortured and raped.\n\nAD\n\nIn an interview that aired Sunday on the CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d Mohammed denied ordering Khashoggi\u2019s murder but said he accepted responsibility for the killing because Saudi government employees committed the crime.\n\n7 unanswered questions a year after Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s killing\n\nDokhi Fassihian, executive director of Reporters Without Borders in North America, told dozens of vigilgoers in Washington that Khashoggi was a \u201cdeeply thoughtful, introspective and courageous man\u201d who showed great care and love for his country and fellow Arabian citizens.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe raised his voice to criticize the Saudi government\u2019s persecution of the media, of women and for those who fought for human rights and democracy in Saudi Arabia,\u201d Fassihian said. \u201cThe murder of Jamal Khashoggi is an atrocity and deeply painful loss \u2026 to the larger Arab world who looked to him as a source of hope in dark times.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nRep. Jamie B. Raskin (D-Md.) quoted Maryland native Frederick Douglass, the 19th-century abolitionist and orator, telling the crowd that \u201cthere must be struggle\u201d and that power \u201ccedes nothing without a demand.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is going to be a long fight to get justice for the Khashoggi family and to end the tyranny in Saudi Arabia,\u201d Raskin said.\n\nAlso in attendance were journalists who have faced repression or were forced to flee their native countries.\n\nNi\u00adger\u00adian television presenter Ohimai Amaize hosted a program that debuted in August 2018 that brought social media conversations to a broadcast audience. But he said the Ni\u00adger\u00adian government deemed the show too critical and shut down his station.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA court order allowed the station to reopen, but by June, he fled his country to avoid facing charges of treason and incitement, Amaize said.\n\nHe said Khashoggi\u2019s killing represents an increasing threat to journalists worldwide from an increasing number of regimes.\n\n\u201cThe people who killed him have not been brought to book,\u201d Amaize said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tragic reminder that journalists anywhere in the world really are not safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to keep talking,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to step up advocacy for the protection of journalists.\u201d\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news\n\nAD", "description": "Journalists and human rights activists held a vigil outside the Saudi embassy.", "authors": ["Clarence Williams", "Local Reporter Covering Crime", "Breaking News", "Public Safety Issues"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/knbB6Lvd5g4aKbWHDYFp3XLf_OA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PRXSDNXFNMI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg"}
