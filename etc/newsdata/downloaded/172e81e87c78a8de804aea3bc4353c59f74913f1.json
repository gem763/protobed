Ruth and Rice enjoyed golfing, bowling and dining together, and Ruth was a regular visitor to the Rice household, where he came to know Jim\u2019s wife, Ethyl, and their children. Rice once beat Ruth in five straight games of bowling.\n\nTerry Rice, an attorney in Suffern and Jim\u2019s only son, is selling the bat. Born two years after Ruth died in 1948, Rice more closely associates Mickey Mantle and Yogi Berra with the Yankees of his youth, but he remembers Ruth\u2019s bat sat in the corner behind the television in the family\u2019s den.\n\n\u201cIt was always there. It was part of life,\u201d Rice told The Associated Press by phone on Wednesday. \u201cNo one said I couldn\u2019t touch it. I never took it out and played baseball with it.\u201d\n\nGood thing, too, since the bat was recently authenticated and received the highest grade given.\n\n\u201cFor an inanimate object, it\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Rice said. \u201cIt\u2019s in perfect condition.\u201d\n\nThe Louisville Slugger shows marks on the upper barrel where Ruth knocked mud off his cleats. The left barrel has impressions where the bat made contact with the ball. There\u2019s also a bit of green paint from where the bat rested in the dugout between uses.\n\n\u201cBabe Ruth is the king of the sports collectibles marketplace,\u201d SCP Auctions President David Kohler said. \u201cWhen a fresh Ruth item of such quality and historical importance as this one surfaces, it generates tremendous excitement throughout our industry.\u201d\n\nRuth\u2019s 500th homer cleared the right field wall in Cleveland, sailed out of the park and rolled down Lexington Avenue where it was plucked by an Indians fan. After the game, the ball was returned to Ruth in exchange for $20 and his autograph.\n\nIt would be another 16 years before Mel Ott became the second player to reach 500 homers in 1945.\n\nAfter Jim Rice died in 1983, his wife kept possession of the bat until her death in 1997. Then it passed to Terry Rice and was stashed in a closet.\n\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t leave it out,\u201d Rice said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t enjoying it. I got to the point where we were worried about it.\u201d\n\nRice, 69, talked to his two older sisters before deciding to sell. They plan to split the proceeds.\n\nOfficials from SCP Auctions in Laguna Niguel, California, estimate the bat could sell for over $1 million.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d be absolutely flabbergasted,\u201d Terry Rice said of his father\u2019s reaction.\n\nSCP sold Ruth\u2019s bat used to homer on opening day of the 1923 season at Yankee Stadium for $1.26 million in 2004.\n\nRice pulled the 500th-homer bat out of the closet so it could see daylight before the authenticator arrived, and that\u2019s when it hit him.\n\n\u201cThis is a piece of history,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Rice siblings are holding on to other mementos associated with Ruth. His oldest sister has a personally autographed photo, his middle sister has a paper Ruth signed, and Terry Rice has a signed baseball that Ruth inscribed to his father: To my pal Jim.\n\nOldest sister Pat has the strongest recollection of Ruth visiting the family home.\n\n\u201cHe came in one time and picked her up into the air and hit her head on the chandelier,\u201d Terry Rice recalled. \u201cShe said, \u2018I don\u2019t like you anymore.\u2019\u201d\n\nRice said he hopes the Yankees or the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, would be interested in the bat.\n\nOnline bidding begins Nov. 27 and ends Dec. 14 at scpauctions.com.\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The bat used by Babe Ruth to slug his 500th career home run in 1929 is going up for auction, nearly 75 years after he gave it to a friend whose family has kept it ever since.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Beth Harris"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/16/babe_ruths_bat_auction_baseball_79819_c0-131-3150-1968_s1200x700.jpg?e846a0ee6811e858d70a0091d9c21e396541ab6f", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
