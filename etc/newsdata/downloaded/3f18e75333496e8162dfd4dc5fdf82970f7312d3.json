Although most attacks occur in North Sinai, there is a risk of terrorist attacks across the country.\n\n\"Attacks could be indiscriminate, affecting Egyptian security forces, religious sites, large public gatherings and places visited by foreigners.\n\n(Image: Geoff Moore/REX/Shutterstock)\n\n\"There is a heightened threat of terrorist attacks in or around religious sites and during religious festivals, such as the month of Ramadan and the Christmas period (including Coptic Christmas), when terrorist groups have sometimes called for attacks.\n\n\"Terrorist attacks have occurred over local holiday weekends. Terrorists have attacked tourists in Egypt in the past. There is a heightened threat of terrorist attacks targeting Coptic Christians from extremists linked to Daesh-Sinai in Egypt.\"\n\nIt says that an estimated 415,000 British nationals visited in 2018 and that most visits were trouble free.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nTravel Editor Nigel Thompson says: \"Great news for British holidaymakers and the struggling local tourist businesses.\n\n\"Sharm el-Sheikh is the jewel in the crown of the Egyptian holiday trade - deservedly hugely popular and famed for its wonderful winter weather, luxurious big name five-star resorts and world class scuba diving.\n\n\"Losing the key UK market in Sharm was a terrible blow to the Egyptians and although the Red Sea resorts around Hurghada rallied, they're not in the same league.\n\n\"So this is an absolute win-win \u2013 Brits will flock back in their hundreds of thousands and the local economy will get a major boost.\n\n\"It's just a pity the return to Sharm has not come in time to help Thomas Cook, which was a big player in the resort.\n\n\"The FCO says estimated 415,000 British nationals visited Egypt last year, way down on the 2010 peak of around 1.5 million. Of those, nearly 900,000 headed to Sharm.\"", "description": "The UK will be re-opening flights to Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt nearly four years after the bombing of a Russian airliner saw restrictions imposed", "authors": ["Neil Lancefield", "Julie Delahaye", "Image", "Mohamed El-Dakhakhny Sipa Rex Shutterstock", "Getty", "Geoff Moore Rex Shutterstock", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article5373446.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Sharm-el-Sheikh.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
