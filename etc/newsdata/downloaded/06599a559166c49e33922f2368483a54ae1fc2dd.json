Some people booed and one person told me to \"shut up.\"'\n\nShe then adds: 'I let the room know that I have been raped, and cursed at the monster I wasn\u2019t making eye contact with.'\n\nScroll down for video\n\nNailed it: Kelly Bachman (above) compared Harvey Weinsetin to Freddy Krueger and said she did not know there was a need to bring her mace during her set last week\n\nGal pal: The disgraced mogul was attending an actors and comedians showcase at a New York City bar\n\nNow, at the age of 27, she says that she is finally starting to move forward.\n\n'I\u2019m tired. I\u2019m tired of missing work because of a trauma episode. I\u2019m tired of spending an entire week thinking about rapists instead of thinking about jokes,' writes Bachman.\n\n'I\u2019m tired of losing friends and family because of rapists. I\u2019m tired of losing sleep because of rapists.'\n\nShe later explains: 'I know that the amount of time I\u2019ve spent thinking about three horrible nights of my life is probably the amount of time I could\u2019ve been laughing with an audience.'\n\nThe night after the show ended up being difficult, as Bachman writes: 'I spent the entire night after that show thinking I had let down other survivors by not punching up harder. I kept feeling that I should\u2019ve said more, that I should\u2019ve been stronger.\n\n'And I share these feelings with you not because I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m strong, but because I know that so many survivors feel this way all the time.'\n\nBachman was being filmed last week when she called out Harvey right at the start of her set in NYC bar Downtime where the disgraced mogul was attending an actors and comedians showcase.\n\n'I'm feeling a little tense. Anyone else? I'm a comic and it's our job to name the elephant in the room. Do we know what that is?' asked Bachman.\n\n'It's a Freddy Krueger in the room, if you will.'\n\nShe then added: 'I didn't know we had to bring our own Mace and rape whistles!'\n\nThat lead to a chorus of boos and one person even telling her to 'shut up,' to which Bachman responded: 'Oh, shut up? This kills at group therapy for rape survivors!'\n\nBachman closed her op-ed by talking about what she hopes to do moving forward, and what she would like others to do for her and her fellow victims.\n\n'A lot of the work in calling out rape, rapists and rape culture unfortunately still falls on survivors. We are the ones screaming out while others fall silent, boo or demand we \"shut up,\"'' writes Bachman.\n\n'I want other people to speak up for us so that we don\u2019t have to. I want it to become normal to name the elephant in the room. And I don\u2019t ever want to become comfortable sharing space with a monster.'\n\nShe then brings it back to her confrontation to Weinstein.\n\n'When I stood onstage last Wednesday, I remember thinking that I really just wanted to get back to my set. I didn\u2019t want to lose even 10 more minutes of my life to a rapist,' she explains.\n\n'I just wanted to let all of the rapists know what I think of them, and then get back to telling jokes. So that\u2019s exactly what I did.'", "description": "The young woman who confronted Harvey Weinstein last week is speaking out.
