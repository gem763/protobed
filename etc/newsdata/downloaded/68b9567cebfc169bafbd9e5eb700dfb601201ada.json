I am in the Academy now. Although after that last tweet they may kick me out. Haha.'\n\nHer first Tweet posed the question: 'Is anybody else excited to watch the same 12 people get nominated for oscars this year?'\n\nSecond thoughts: Evan's sentiment hit a chord in the Twitter-verse, but she soon began hedging\n\nIt was at that point that the Across The Universe star walked back some of her comments a bit, apparently hoping to soften her tone:\n\n'This is not to throw shade at the Academy or the films,' she began.\n\n'BUT if we got BIG MONEY out of campaigning, (just like elections) then maybe it would be fair? Just a thought.'\n\nChanging her tone: It was at that point that the Across The Universe star walked back some of her comments a bit, apparently hoping to soften her tone\n\nThe came her mea culpa, when she jokingly tweeted, 'Also lets just go ahead and assume I am never getting nominated now.'\n\nIronically, Evan stands to eventually get a nod, as she is an undeniably talented actress who has already been repeatedly nominated for both Primetime Emmys and Golden Globes.\n\nShe then widened her criticism to target the industry as a whole: 'Also, not blaming it all on the Academy. The industry will only cast Actors that get the movies \u2018Financed\u2019 and it becomes a very small pool very quickly.'\n\nMea culpa: Evan jokingly tweeted about never getting nominated, which hopefully won't be the case\n\nWood ended the minor 'rant' on a note concerning female directors, tweeting that 'They arent getting nominated because no one is financing their films.'\n\nTo date, only one female director has won a Best Director Oscar: Kathryn Bigelow, for 2009's The Hurt Locker.\n\nApart from her ongoing work on HBO's robot western series Westworld, Evan has several projects in the pike, including a voice in Disney's new Frozen II and a lead role opposite Debra Winger in the heist movie Kajillionaire.\n\nDon't mess with this robot: Wood is still involved in ongoing work on HBO's western sci fi series Westworld", "description": "She's always been one to speak her mind on social media and beyond, and Wednesday was no exception.
