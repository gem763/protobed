In fact, Congressman Jim Banks from Indiana wants you to know the dimwitted Dems are pretty much making it up as they go.\n\n\"The Democrats are making up the rules of this impeachment process as they go,\" Rep. Banks told Fox & Friends First on Tuesday morning.\n\n\"I have a few friends back home in Indiana who don\u2019t like this president, they won\u2019t vote for him again, but even they know that this president so far has not been indicted of high crimes and misdemeanors,\" he added. \"And that\u2019s the justification for impeachment. Not this make it up as you go process that\u2019s in search of reasons to impeach the president.\"\n\nIndeed, it is bit a confusing isn't it? Democrats like Rep. Rashida Tlaib from Michigan, Rep. Al Green from Texas, and good ol' Moonbat Maxine from California have been bragging and clamoring for the mantle of who was the first to call for impeaching the president. Maxine actually wants Trump imprisoned and placed in solitary confinement. And for what, exactly? We don't know!\n\nBut plenty of Democrats were saying President Trump should be impeached before he even got elected. But, if President Trump's phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky occurred in July 2019, then how could Democrats have any legal ground to say he should be impeached prior to that? Of course, the larger point is that the Ukrainian phone call isn't an impeachable offense, it's only the latest horse Democrats are trying tot hitch their wagon to in order to remove dutifully elected sitting president. For shame. Good on Rep. Jim Banks for calling them out.", "description": ".10/15/2019 11:02:05AM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Guy Benson", "Leah Barkoukis", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/276/d9ff1427-6190-433d-aa3b-c244d0f0154e.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
