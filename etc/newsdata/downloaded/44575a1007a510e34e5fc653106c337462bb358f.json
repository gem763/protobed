It was also at 1.1364 against the , having earlier hit a four-month high of 1.1380.\n\nThe pound had started to rally late on Thursday after Sky News quote outgoing European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker as saying that the U.K. and EU could still strike a deal to prevent a disorderly Brexit on Oct. 31.\n\nHowever, Juncker\u2019s comments amounted to little more than a restatement of what has long been EU policy regarding the Brexit negotiations, and Juncker said elsewhere in the interview that he hadn\u2019t read the U.K.\u2019s latest proposals on how to break the deadlock over the so-called \u201cIrish backstop\u201d, under which the U.K. province of Northern Ireland would be likely to stay more aligned with EU regulation in future.\n\nBy contrast, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney told local media on Friday that there was still a \u201clarge gap\u201d between the two sides and that much of what was being touted as progress by the U.K. was \u201cspin\u201d.\n\nThe U.K.\u2019s latest proposals, which were sent in writing to the EU this week, are not legally binding and therefore still don\u2019t meet the key EU desire of proper legal guarantees.\n\nElsewhere, the dollar was broadly lower amid a revival in risk appetite caused by the resumption of trade talks between junior Chinese and U.S. officials. Higher-level talks are due to resume in early October.\n\nThat helped the to strengthen slightly, as did the fact that another cut in the People\u2019s Bank of China\u2019s one-year loan rate didn\u2019t ease financial conditions as much as some had hoped for.\n\nAnother beneficiary was the , which hit its highest level against the dollar since the end of July. By 4:15 AM ET, it was at 63.85 to the dollar.\n\nThe safe-haven was broadly unchanged after the Bank of Japan took action to steepen the domestic yield curve, while consumer price inflation data came in weaker than expected, raising the pressure on the BoJ to take more action at next month's policy meeting after it chose to leave its policy unchanged on Thursday.", "description": "Forex - Sterling Surges as Juncker Comments Fuel Brexit Hopes", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEB8L0VP_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
