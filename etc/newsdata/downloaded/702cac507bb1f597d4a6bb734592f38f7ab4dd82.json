It will include original shows like \u201cGreen Lantern,\u201d a reboot of \u201cGossip Girl\u201d and a series inspired by the Dune science-fiction novels. However, the deal excludes films by Studio Ghibli, which will feature in the U.S. launch of the new channel. (The Logic, Globe and Mail)\n\nTalking point: This deal means HBO Max won\u2019t launch as a standalone service in Canada, and sharpens Crave\u2019s competitive edge in the increasingly crowded streaming market. Its basic monthly pricing starts at $9.99, but to access the platform\u2019s full library of HBO shows and movies\u2014including the incoming content from HBO Max\u2014subscribers will have to pay $19.98. Though Crave said it won\u2019t increase its prices because of the new deal, at its top tier\u2014priced at $25.99\u2014it remains one of the most expensive major streaming options in the country, costing more than Netflix, which tops out at $16.99; Amazon Prime at $7.99; Disney Plus at $8.99; and Apple TV Plus at $5.99. The last two services are set to launch in November.", "description": "", "authors": ["Liza Agrba"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
