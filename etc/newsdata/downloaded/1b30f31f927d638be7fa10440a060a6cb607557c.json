They have the right to request flexible working with a view to meeting their children. The problem is, employers have the right to turn them down.\n\nFar too many of them do that. Flexi-time is unavailable to over half (58 per cent) of the UK workforce, according to research released today by pollster GQR for the Trades Union Congress. The number rose to nearly two-thirds (64 per cent) of those in working-class occupations.\n\nThree in every 10 people exercising their right to request it said they were turned down, making term-time childcare challenges far more difficult than they ought to be.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThis is obviously harmful to employees, in terms of their mental and physical health, but also to employers.\n\nIn July, the Harvard Business School revealed the results of a study that showed the more flexible an employer is, the more benefits accrue to them. It compared the outcomes of various flexible work arrangements at the US Patent and Trademark Office.\n\nThe results were striking.\n\nThe team found that employees with the most liberal \u201cwork from anywhere\u201d arrangements, similar to those offered at Nasa and tech companies Akamai and Github, were 4.4 per cent more productive than those following a more traditional \u201cwork-from-home\u201d policy giving schedule flexibility but requiring workers to live near the office.\n\nLetting patent examiners work from anywhere brought in $132m (\u00a3108m) in extra fee revenue, and reduced hiring costs by 4.4 per cent, and office costs by $38.2m.\n\nThe hiring costs declined because workers allowed to work flexibly were more loyal. That shouldn\u2019t be underestimated in a tight labour market, like the one in the US. And in the UK, at least for now.\n\nI\u2019ve discussed the issue with the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, which has expressed disappointment at the way progress on flexible working in Britain has stalled. Head of public policy Ben Willmott said firms are \u201cmissing out\u201d.\n\nWhy is this happening? Willmott spoke of a \u201ctrust deficit\u201d among some employers, which holds that if staff aren\u2019t under supervision from nine until five, they won\u2019t do the work they\u2019re supposed to do.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

This shouldn\u2019t come as surprise. A number of studies have shown that workers are perfectly capable of goofing in the office should they be so inclined.\n\nIt\u2019s possible, too, that the pettiness of power plays a role.\n\nIn response to its research, the TUC is joining the Flex for All alliance \u2013 along with Pregnant then Screwed, the Fawcett Society, Mother Pukka, the Young Women\u2019s Trust and the Fatherhood Institute.\n\nThe campaign has launched a petition calling for a change in the law so that flexible working is open to all workers from day one in the job, with employers required to advertise all jobs on that basis.\n\nThat\u2019s something they would likely baulk at. There would inevitably be loud calls for carve outs even if a progressive government (so not the current one) were to bring that forward.\n\nSome might be necessary. But perhaps fewer than you might think with sufficiently skilled people management.\n\nToo many employers don\u2019t appear to know what\u2019s good for them or their employees. The case for forcing them to embrace the benefits they would derive from offering flexible working arrangements only gets stronger with every request unreasonably denied.", "description": "The start of the new school term this week brings with it a fresh set of challenges for working parents.
