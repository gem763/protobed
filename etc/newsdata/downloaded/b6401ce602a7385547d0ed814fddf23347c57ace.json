What if it means having 360 degrees of angles to chose from instead?\n\nSigh.\n\nThat briefly changed my mind about 360 cameras, too.\n\nInsta360\u2019s One X is a 360-degree action camera that uses dual 200-degree f/2 lenses to create really unique 18-megapixel photos or 5.7k spherical video that can then be exported in 1080, non-360, frames. Unlike prior 360 cameras, which were designed to capture video you watched through a VR headset or that you panned your phone around to see, the One X is designed to let you turn it on and know that you\u2019re going to capture whatever is happening around you. You\u2019ll just decide what that shot is after the fact.\n\nOur review of Insta360 One X Verge Score 7 out of 10 Good Stuff Unique footage\n\nGreat for filming yourself\n\nSuper stable footage Bad Stuff You have to edit the footage to share it\n\nLearning curve to the app and camera menu system\n\nPoor performance in low light Buy for $399.95 from Insta360 Buy for $399.95 from Amazon\n\nThe matte black housing has a microSD card slot, Micro USB port, and battery compartment. Two round buttons meant for controlling the camera are located beneath a small screen that displays your shooting mode and a highly confusing camera menu, but not what you\u2019re actually capturing. The controls act much the same as GoPro controls do: with a learning curve. It all feels very foreign until you get use to it, but even then it\u2019s not the easiest thing to use. There is also built-in image stabilization that Insta360 calls \u201cFlowState,\u201d which keeps video footage super smooth with no need for an external gimbal.\n\nThe One X\u2019s mobile app makes up for a lot of the camera\u2019s hardware annoyances, though, and is the easiest way to export content from the camera. You can use it to set keyframes, aspect ratios, and export recorded video in decent quality. There\u2019s also the usual remote and live view of the camera.\n\nThe One X\u2019s video looks crisp and impressive on a phone, but once exported and viewed on a larger screen the footage begins to fall apart. It struggles with bright highlights, such as the sky, and is almost unusable at night when high contrast light is present. The 18-megapixel photos are crisp and once uploaded to a desktop computer, they natively stretch to show the whole 360-degree shot without needing to be stitched.\n\nIn both photos and videos, the camera\u2019s blind spot hides a selfie stick which can make filming yourself really easy. The magic of the One X is its ability to become a personal videographer instead of flying a drone or holding out a camera in front of you. The downside to this is you will have quite a few shots of you holding up what appears to be nothing.\n\nGrid View\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first time I used the One X I was totally sold on this promise of unique shots with little setup, but after only using it twice, I found myself not super interested in continuing to use it. Insta360 has made 360 photo and video more accessible by not putting the focus on 360 degree output, but for me, there are still too many steps for a finished video I don\u2019t necessarily know what to do with.\n\nAs a tech optimist, I was ready to be a believer in 360 again, but sometimes more cameras just means more work, and as a consumer you really have to know exactly what you want to do with this camera before you buy it. Tune into the video for more samples from the One X, including a sick shot from the bumpiest boat ride I have ever taken.", "description": "The One X is the latest 360 camera on the market and this time, Insta360 wants you to see it as a way to have unlimited angles to choose from when editing. But it still isn\u2019t compelling enough to use with any regularity.", "authors": ["Becca Farsace", "Jul", "Photography Phil Esposito", "The Verge"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pwOarhmSlAI9iX_KyLzDMw1Goyc=/0x292:2040x1360/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18342954/pesposito_150623_3544_6616.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-30"}
