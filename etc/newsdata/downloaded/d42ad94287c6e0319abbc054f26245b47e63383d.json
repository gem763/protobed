This is bats\u2014t crazy,\u201d Ms. Rice said on the program.\n\nThe White House announced late Sunday that the U.S. would remove its troops from northern Syria, where American forces have fought for years alongside Kurdish fighters against the Islamic State terrorist group also known as ISIS, catching Mr. Trump\u2019s allies off guard and prompting rebuke from across Washington.\n\n\u201cThese are the people who for the last four years have been fighting on our behalf with our equipment to defeat ISIS,\u201d Ms. Rice said about the Kurds. \u201cAnd they have done it with enormous efficacy, and they\u2019ve sacrificed immensely, and we basically just said to them, \u2018See ya.\u2019 \u201c\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s just appalling because we promised them our partnership. And we promised them that if they worked with us to defeat our common enemy, but particularly our \u2014 the United States and the western enemy \u2014 that we would stand with them,\u201d Ms. Rice said. \u201cAnd Trump woke up on the wrong side of the bed, it appears, and decided never mind.\u201d\n\nIn a series of tweets on Tuesday, Mr. Trump maintained that the U.S. isn\u2019t turning its back on the Kurds.\n\n\u201cWe may be in the process of leaving Syria, but in no way have we Abandoned the Kurds, who are special people and wonderful fighters. Likewise our relationship with Turkey, a NATO and Trading partner, has been very good,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cTurkey already has a large Kurdish population and fully understands that while we only had 50 soldiers remaining in that section of Syria, and they have been removed, any unforced or unnecessary fighting by Turkey will be devastating to their economy and to their very fragile currency. We are helping the Kurds financially/weapons!\u201d\n\nDemocrats and Republicans alike denounced the withdrawal after it was announced late Monday, with some of Mr. Trump\u2019s staunchest defenders calling his decision into question.\n\n\u201cThe President\u2019s decision to withdraw U.S. forces from Northern Syria is a deeply disturbing development that betrays our Kurdish allies who have been instrumental partners in our mission to eradicate ISIS,\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat, said in a statement.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican, called it \u201ca disaster in the maker,\u201d and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, said that \u201cit would increase the risk that ISIS and other terrorist groups regroup.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
