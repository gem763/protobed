Wilma Deering", "language": "en", "text": "Erin Gray was juggling two careers when the offer of a lifetime came her way.\n\nAt age 28, the model received an acting contract with Universal Studios but was only being paid $600 a week, prompting her to continue modeling despite a grueling schedule.\n\nFORMER \u2018BATTLESTAR GALACTICA\u2019 STAR KATEE SACKOFF EXPLAINS WHY SHE WAITED A DECADE TO TAKE ON SCI-FI AGAIN\n\n\u201cWhen I was shooting \u2018Evening in Byzantium,\u2019 on my last night, which went from 6 p.m. until 6 a.m., the studio called me and said, \u2018We\u2019d like you to come in at 10 a.m. for screen tests for \u2018Buck Rogers,\u2019\u201d the actress recently recalled in a chat with Closer Weekly.\n\n\u201c\u2019I\u2019m sorry, I just finished a four-to-six -eek shoot and this is my last night and you want me to screen test for \u2018Buck Rogers\u2019?\u2019\u201d Gray continued. \u201c'I haven\u2019t read a script. I know nothing about this project. Please let me go home and we can do this another day.' Nope. I came in with such an attitude. And I got the part.\u201d\n\nBRUCE CAMPBELL SAYS IT FEELS GOOD TO RETIRE AS ASH FROM \u2018EVIL DEAD\u2019: \u2018GET OUT BEFORE IT\u2019S TIME FOR THE WALKER\u2019\n\n\u201cBuck Rogers in the 25th Century,\u201d which premiered in 1979, was the story of a 20th-century astronaut emerging from a 500-year stretch in suspended animation to find a strange and unfamiliar future -- and plenty of alien baddies. The light adventure series starred Gil Gerard as Capt. William \u201cBuck\" Rogers, while Gray played Col. Wilma Deering.\n\nGray said tackling sci-fi was daunting.\n\n\u201cI was scared to death on the one hand,\u201d the 69-year-old admitted to the outlet. \u201cYou know, \u2018Oh, this is science fiction, which means that everything I\u2019m dealing with isn\u2019t real.\u2019 There\u2019s no normal telephone, I\u2019m saying words that are a little Greek and a little Latin put together to make something new. The only way I could get through it was just trying to make it as real as I possibly could.\n\n\"I think it was Barbara Stanwyck who said, \u2018Speak the truth and the character will play itself.\u2019\n\nFRANK SINATRA\u2019S ATTORNEY WARNED STAR NOT TO MARRY MARILYN MONROE OVER HER SUICIDAL THOUGHTS, PODCAST CLAIMS\n\n\u201cThat was kind of my guiding force,\u201d Gray continued. \u201cSo it\u2019s like: \u2018OK, just make it real. Just commit to the realness of this.\u2019 You know, use my memory training to create the reality and sort of commit to it. Again, I throw myself into things that are scary and hope for the best. The other thing is that there\u2019s a part of my personality that is fearless, but there\u2019s also a part of my personality that has dealt with a certain amount of abuse in my life. So there\u2019s a very fragile part, right?\u201d\n\nGray said her upbringing inspired her to take on a new challenge in Hollywood.\n\nELVIS PRESLEY\u2019S PAL RECALLS LAST TIME HE SAW THE KING HE \u2018LOOKED SO BAD\u2019: \u2018EVERYBODY HAD TEARS IN THEIR EYES\u2019\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a part that is not used to speaking up for herself,\u201d she explained. \u201cI was raised as an only child in that old situation where children are to be seen and not heard. I never felt the freedom to speak up or argue or discuss certain things. My mom was a single mom and working long hours and had to fend for herself. Going into Col. Wilma Deering, I had to think, \u2018How does a colonel act? ... It was like putting on a cloak of strength. I got to pretend to be strong, and it was a really wonderful exploration to bring that within myself. It was an opportunity for me to work that muscle and see how it felt. That absolutely had an impact on my life.\u201d\n\nGray said Gerard was the jokester of the cast, and he put everyone at ease. Initially, she wanted to remain serious, learning as much as possible on set. However, it didn\u2019t take long for her comedic side to shine while filming.\n\n\u2018LEAVE IT TO BEAVER\u2019 STAR TONY DOW EXPLAINS WHY HE WASN\u2019T ALLOWED TO WATCH HIT SERIES GROWING UP\n\n\u201cFirst there was dead silence and then you saw the ladder with the guys holding the lights starting to shake, just dying of laughter,\u201d said Gray. \u201cNobody expected that out of me. From that point on it became, like, who\u2019s going to get the joke on camera this week? Gil, of course, had to top me, so it was a constant back and forth. Gil is very funny and there would be times when I would say to him: \u2018Just shut the f---k up. Just stop. I\u2019ve got a stitch in my side and I can\u2019t remember my lines anymore.\u2019 But that\u2019s just his natural way.\u201d\n\nThe series was relatively short-lived. It ultimately came to an end in 1981.\n\n\u201cI wanted to be [Wilma],\u201d said Gray. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to take crap from anybody, you know. That helped that part of me to grow and, as it\u2019s turned out, I inspired other women to be strong. I don\u2019t feel responsible in one way because I didn\u2019t go out there and lead the way or something \u2014 it just happened. But I\u2019m very grateful for it. It\u2019s a certain legacy that I have that I\u2019m honored to have been part of.\u201d\n\n\u2018BRADY BUNCH\u2019 STAR MAUREEN MCCORMICK SAYS SHE AND COSTAR ANN B. DAVIS WERE \u2018SO CLOSE\u2019 AFTER SITCOM ENDED\n\nStill Gray recalls her time on the series as a mixed blessing.\n\n\u201cWhen I got \u2018Buck Rogers,\u2019 it was like getting the golden ring,\u201d she explained. \u201cI worked hard, I studied all those years in acting class, I traveled to Los Angeles and stuck it out. At the same time, I had a baby, so the timing was not really optimal. Also, I was on the set for so long, for so many hours, and sometimes sleeping in my dressing room overnight, because there was no point in driving an hour to your home and then driving an hour back to the studio.\n\n\u201cI might as well just stay in my dressing room kind of thing. But that pulled me away from my responsibilities as a mother and it just killed me. I ended up moving so I could be close to the studio so I could just drive home at lunchtime and just hug and feed my baby. Then head back to the studio.\u201d\n\nGray continued to work on television after \u201cBuck Rogers\u201d and famously starred as Kate Summers-Stratton in Ricky Schroder\u2019s sitcom, \u201cSilver Spoons,\u201d from 1982 until 1987. She has kept busy ever since.\n\n'LAND OF THE LOST' STAR KATHY COLEMAN RECALLS GETTING INTO TROUBLE ON SET, REVEALS WHY HIT SHOW CAME TO AN END\n\n\u201cI feel very blessed,\u201d said Gray. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt I\u2019ve had people come into my life without whom I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be the person I am today. I feel very blessed for the genes my parents gave me and their acumen. I\u2019m glad I did it my way, even though I made some mistakes. I\u2019ve been very blessed with beautiful children and an incredible husband \u2014 my second husband. ... I pinch myself every day. I\u2019m glad I took chances. I\u2019m glad I took risks.\"", "description": "Erin Gray was juggling two careers when the offer of a lifetime came her way.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nolasco"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/erin-gray-getty.jpg"}
