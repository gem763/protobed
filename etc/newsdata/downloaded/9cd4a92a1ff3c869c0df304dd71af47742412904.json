Amy Klobuchar Amy Jean KlobucharKlobuchar blasts Trump ethanol proposal as 'too little too late' Poll: Biden, Sanders lead 2020 Democratic field in Ohio 2020 Democrats push for gun control action at forum MORE (D-Minn.) criticized the latest ethanol proposal from the Trump administration Friday, saying the president hasn't done enough to remedy the past \u201cgut punches\u201d he\u2019s delivered the ethanol industry.\n\nThe 2020 contender stopped by a biodiesel plant while on the campaign trail in Iowa, just hours after the Trump administration proposed changes to the renewable fuel standard designed to boost the use of alternative fuels.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThey've done some really irreversible damage,\u201d Klobuchar said, referring to an August decision to grant 31 waivers to refineries to exempt them from blending in ethanol.\n\n\u201cAny effort is helpful. But this is I fear, too little too late,\u201d she added, saying the proposal still lacked important details.\n\nThose 31 waivers Trump issued in August become a rallying cry for corn farmers because Trump had promised just a few weeks before to reevaluate the exemptions granted to small refineries.\n\nThe waivers also come as Trump\u2019s trade war is closing markets for Iowa corn.\n\n\u201cThe one thing they ask the government is do no harm,\u201d Klobuchar said of farmers. \u201cAnd at least be consistent in your policy so they can make decisions about investment. He's been the opposite. It's been total chaos.\u201d\n\nThough subsidies have been given to many farmers, \u201cthat's not a substitute for the business that they want to build,\u201d she said.\n\nOil companies were also critical of Trump\u2019s ethanol proposal, calling it a political gambit to win votes in a key 2020 state.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not sugar coat it, ethanol mandates are being raised because a handful of corn-state senators have extorted it from the president using election year politics,\u201d LeAnn Johnson with the Small Refiners Coalition said in a statement.", "description": "NEWTON, Iowa \u2014 Sen.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/klobucharamy_07302019getty_1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
