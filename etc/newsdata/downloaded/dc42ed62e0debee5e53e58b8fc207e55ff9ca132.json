Over 'Right to Be Forgotten' Rules", "language": "en", "text": "(BRUSSELS) \u2014 Google won a major case in the European Union on Tuesday, when the bloc\u2019s top court ruled that the U.S. internet giant doesn\u2019t have to extend the EU\u2019s \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d rules to its search engines outside the region.\n\nThe case stems from a 2014 ruling that said people have the right to control what appears when their name is searched online. They can ask Google, for example, to remove a link. The French privacy regulator then wanted that rule applied to all of Google\u2019s domains, even outside the EU, and asked the EU\u2019s top court for advice.\n\nThe European Court of Justice said Tuesday that there \u201cis no obligation under EU law for a search engine operator\u201d to extend the rule beyond the EU states.\n\nIt said, however, that a search engine operator must put measures in place to discourage internet users from going outside the EU to find that information.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

It also raises questions about how to enforce differing jurisdictions when it comes to the borderless internet.\n\nIn a reaction to the ruling, Google\u2019s Senior Privacy Counsel Peter Fleischer said \u201cit\u2019s good to see that the Court agreed with our arguments\u201d and added that Google had worked hard \u201cto strike a sensible balance between people\u2019s rights of access to information and privacy.\u201d\n\nThe European Commission noted that the court again confirmed that the \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d exists in the EU.\n\nThe 2014 ruling that people in the EU have the right to control what appears when their name is searched online forced Google to delete links to outdated or embarrassing personal information that popped up in searches within the 28-nation bloc.\n\nOne year later, the French privacy watchdog wanted Google to remove results on all its search engines on request, and not just European country sites like www.google.fr . Google refused and in the resulting court case, French legal authorities asked the EU\u2019s highest court for advice.\n\nOn Tuesday, the EU court said it was illegal to apply an EU rule to business operations in countries outside the EU.\n\nThe ruling is final and becomes the benchmark on which courts in the 28-nation bloc must base their decisions relating to such cases.\n\nThose who wanted to see such an extension argue that on the internet it is easy to switch from the national versions of the web site to ones outside the EU \u2013 by switching from google.fr to google.com for example \u2013 to find the information that must be removed within the EU.\n\nSince Google started handling \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d requests in May 2014, the U.S. tech giant has removed about 1.3 million web links from its search results, or 45% of total requests processed, according to the company\u2019s transparency report .\n\nOnline takedown requests filed by European residents are reviewed by Google staff based mainly in Ireland, who assess them on criteria including whether the webpage\u2019s information is \u201cinadequate, irrelevant, no longer relevant, or excessive.\u201d\n\nGoogle says it may reject a delisting request if the page contains information that\u2019s \u201cstrongly in the public interest\u201d with material that relates to the requester\u2019s professional life, past crime, political office, position in public life, or whether the content consists of government documents or \u201cjournalistic in nature.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "The U.S. internet giant doesn't have to extend the EU's \"right to be forgotten\" rules to its search engines outside the region.", "authors": ["Raf Casert"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/google-logo.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
