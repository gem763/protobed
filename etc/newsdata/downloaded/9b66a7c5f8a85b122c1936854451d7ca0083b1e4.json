By Wednesday morning, Dorian made landfall in the U.S. Virgin Islands (for which a state of emergency has been approved) with winds at around 70 mph. (74 mph qualifies as hurricane wind speeds.) Dorian was then forecasted to travel to Puerto Rico, and eventually to Florida, gaining strength.\n\nTropical Storm Dorian hit the island of Martinique, causing a road collapse, street closures, severe flooding, and trapping a bus. It's possible that the storm may strengthen to a hurricane as it approaches the Florida coast this weekend. https://t.co/VG30LJ09vR pic.twitter.com/1nEEDDyGpt \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) August 28, 2019\n\nHow badly did Hurricane Dorian hit Puerto Rico?\n\nReports initially said that Puerto Rico could see up to ten inches of rain. Governor Wanda Vazquez urged residents \u2014 some are still living under \u201cblue roofs,\u201d a.k.a. \u201ctarps,\u201d after Hurricane Maria devastated the island in 2018 \u2014 to take precaution.\n\nThe storm sky just opened up with fierce winds and rain. pic.twitter.com/VcJIWd2GJb \u2014 Alexander Kaufman (@AlexCKaufman) August 28, 2019\n\nDonald Trump, of course, took the opportunity to insult San Juan mayor Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz (again) as he attempted to seem on top of the storm.\n\nWe are tracking closely tropical storm Dorian as it heads, as usual, to Puerto Rico. FEMA and all others are ready, and will do a great job. When they do, let them know it, and give them a big Thank You - Not like last time. That includes from the incompetent Mayor of San Juan! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 28, 2019\n\nAs Dorian passed Puerto Rico, the eye of the storm moved quickly north and it remained a Category 1 hurricane.\n\nHow strong is Hurricane Dorian now?\n\nHurricane Dorian is now a Category 2 storm. As of 11 a.m. Friday, Dorian had maximum sustained winds of 110 mph and was located about 480 miles east of the northwestern Bahamas and 660 miles east of West Palm Beach, per the Orlando Sentinel.\n\nWhen is Hurricane Dorian going to hit Florida?\n\nGovernor Ron DeSantis has declared a state of emergency for the residents of the counties in Dorian\u2019s projected path, from Jacksonville to Miami. Currently, meteorologists are predicting Dorian will make landfall north of West Palm Beach on Tuesday morning. Then it will move inland, projected to move over downtown Orlando by Wednesday morning.\n\nHow strong will Hurricane Dorian be when it hits Florida?\n\nOriginally expected to make landfall on the east coast of Florida or Georgia as a possible Category 3 hurricane, weather reports are now saying it will likely be as strong as a Category 4. That means winds of 140 miles per hour, and possibly deadly storm surges; according to the National Hurricane Center, hurricanes classified as such can result in \u201ccatastrophic damage,\u201d leaving areas uninhabitable for months. \u201cStrengthening is forecast during the next few days, and Dorian is expected to become a major hurricane on Friday, and remain an extremely dangerous hurricane through the weekend,\u201d the National Hurricane Center said Thursday morning.\n\nOn Friday, Dorian had slowed down even further in speed \u2014 which means dangerous amounts of damage are even more possible, though residents have more time to prepare. \u201cFloridians need to be prepared,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cThe bad news of the storm going slower is that that could potentially have some negative impacts once it reaches landfall, but you do have time before it reaches to prepare if you have not done so.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt 140 mph,\u201d the Orlando Sentinel reports, Dorian \u201cwould be the strongest storm to hit Florida\u2019s east coast since Hurricane Andrew tore through South Florida in August 1992, which caused more than $25 billion in damages and was blamed for 44 deaths.\u201d Officials will decide on Friday whether to issue mandatory evacuations.\n\nTropical-storm-force winds from #Dorian could begin in parts of Florida *as early as* Sunday morning. Now is the time to think about what kinds of preparations you might need to make and listen to advice from your local emergency officials https://t.co/yChCF6oWL9 pic.twitter.com/KAFnJSd0Gy \u2014 National Hurricane Center (@NHC_Atlantic) August 30, 2019\n\nThis post will be updated with more information as it becomes available.", "description": "Everything we know about Hurricane Dorian, the latest tropical weather system that spared Puerto Rico and is expected to hit the mainland U.S. in Florida sometime over Labor Day weekend.", "authors": ["Bridget Read"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/08/28/28-hurricane-dorian.w1200.h630.jpg"}
