There is no rest for the Gypsy King. Is there known else?\"\n\nIt certainly is some effort from a boxer who could also soon be preparing for an potential rematch with foe Deontay Wilder early next year.\n\nFury's promoter Frank Warren has also voiced his concern at the lineal world champion's crossover into wrestling, believing it could harm his career in the other ring.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThe legendary promoter previously told talkSPORT: I\u2019d prefer he didn\u2019t do it (WWE) because it could jeopardise his boxing career.\n\n\u201cBut he\u2019s doing it and he\u2019s his own man. In some ways I suppose it\u2019s keeping him focussed and keeping fit and well.\"\n\nFury will find out if his hard work has been worth it when he takes on Strowman in the Saudi capital Riyadh on Thursday.", "description": "The lineal heavyweight world boxing champion will take on Braun Strowman at the event in Saudi Arabia on Thursday evening", "authors": ["Ned Keating", "Image", "Instagram", "Wwe", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article20703317.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Fury-training.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
