The progressive New Democratic Party, led by Jagmeet Singh, was previously expected to be the third most popular party, but Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois is now likely to take third place with 32 seats.\n\nElizabeth May\u2019s Green Party is currently projected to win three seats, according to CBC, meanwhile Maxime Bernier, leader of People\u2019s Party of Canada, has lost his seat.\n\nThese exit polls come after one of the most contentious elections in modern Canadian history, spurred in part by repeated scandals that have plagued Mr Trudeau and his administration.\n\nWhile polls suggest healthcare was the top issue for Canadian voters, with climate change not far behind, the election season was focused on Mr Trudeau\u2019s admission that he had used blackface on numerous occasions, and on accusations that he had improperly intervened in an ongoing criminal case against Quebec construction company SNC-Lavalin.\n\nThose scandals saw a sharp decline in Mr Trudeau\u2019s polling, and left his notable accomplishments on issues like climate change and other notable liberal focuses like welcoming refugees, expanding gender representation in the government, and Census question changes.\n\nTo underscore Mr Trudeau\u2019s precarious position, former US president Barack Obama even broke from tradition to weigh in supporting the Canadian prime minister, risking accusations of foreign influence on the Canadian elections.\n\n\u201cI was proud to work with Justin Trudeau as president,\u201d Mr Obama wrote. \u201cHe\u2019s a hard working, effective leader who takes on big issues like climate change. The world needs his progressive leadership now, and I hope our neighbours to the north support him for another term.\u201d\n\nThe decline in fortunes is a stark change from the 2015 election, when he awakened so-called \u201cTrudeaumania\u201d that had also brought his late father, Pierre Trudeau, into power in the 1960s.\n\nDuring that poll, Mr Trudeau\u2019s Liberal Party won 184 seats in Parliament, removing the Conservative Party from power after nine years on the bench. Those results meant that the Liberal Party was able to easily overcome the 170 seat threshold necessary for a majority.", "description": "Justin Trudeau has held on to power in the Canadian election, but failed to win a majority, according to projections by Canada\u2018s national broadcaster, CBC.
