If Trump fails to construct affordable homes on the site, his company faces a \u00a35m surcharge to pay for them elsewhere.\n\nIn a report to Formartine area committee, which meets on Tuesday to discuss the plans, Archer admitted the scheme broke the agreement Donald Trump signed in 2008 to win permission for his \u00a3750m golf resort.\n\nBut Archer said the new proposals came close enough to the original plans to justify council approval given the difficult economic climate. He claimed the housing scheme, which will be expanded significantly in later phases, would support more than 500 jobs and put \u00a326m into the economy.\n\nGiven the Trump Organization was pressing ahead with plans for a second 18-hole golf course and had made other concessions, Archer said: \u201cThe planning service considers the potential economic benefits of the proposed development to have considerable merit.\u201d\n\nHis backing for the project substantially increases the chances it will be approved at a full meeting of Aberdeenshire council later in September, despite the proposals having received a record 2,900 letters of objection and 18,722 people signing a protest petition.\n\nDebra Storr, a planning consultant who vigorously opposed Trump\u2019s resort proposals when she was a Scottish Green party councillor in Aberdeenshire, described Archer\u2019s position as \u201cquite frankly, hogwash. I\u2019m not surprised the council has shown no backbone.\u201d\n\nShe said Trump had only won approval to build luxury villas and timeshare flats in 2008 because they were needed to pay for the major golf resort he planned, which included a five-star hotel with 450 beds, shops, a clubhouse, conference centre and golf academy. None of these are being built.\n\nShe said the original deal included money towards a local school and health centre, as well as affordable homes, but based on guarantees from Trump that the private homes would only be built once the whole resort was being developed.\n\n\u201cIf they develop the houses, there is no incentive to deliver the resort. It is the resort which was supposed to deliver the massive economic benefit which justified trashing the dunes protected by a site of special scientific interest,\u201d she said.\n\nMartin Ford, a Scottish Greens councillor who first blocked Trump\u2019s proposals in 2007, said Aberdeenshire would never have approved housing so far from public facilities or another settlement in any other circumstances.\n\n\u201cIt only ever got on to the radar as a justification for Trump\u2019s golf resort. So in the end, Trump gets to buy land for housing at agricultural land prices. If the council lets him away with that, they\u2019ve been a bunch of suckers,\u201d Ford said.\n\nThe transport department is the only section of Aberdeenshire council to oppose the development. It said there were no safe walking routes to Balmedie or its school, and there was no easy way to improve safety for cyclists.\n\nThe department said there was \u201ca high risk of non-delivery\u201d of the Trump Organization\u2019s \u201cvague\u201d promises to improve safety for walkers in the new estate and car usage would be much higher than the plans claimed.\n\nArcher\u2019s report argues the expansion of Trump\u2019s boutique hotel to include new bedrooms and the pledge to add 200 beds and 50 \u201cleisure units\u201d goes some way to meeting the promise in 2008 to provide a 450-bed luxury hotel.", "description": "Council\u2019s infrastructure chief backs plans for development at Aberdeenshire golf resort", "authors": ["Severin Carrell"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc83d75a3bc0f60b8886559f8a5ac2ffab548301/0_278_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ae96b44e4beec0c3c847a13e5795e077"}
