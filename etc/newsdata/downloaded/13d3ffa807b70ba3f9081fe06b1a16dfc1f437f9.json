REUTERS/Ginnette Riquelme/File Photo\n\nAtlanta-based Delta had long struggled to get a better foothold in the Latin American market, lagging United Airlines (UAL.O) and American Airlines (AAL.O), whose longtime partnership with LATAM gave it a comfortable lead.\n\nWith the Delta deal, that reigning power couple has split.\n\nDominance in Latin America \u2014 an air travel market expected to double in the next decade \u2014 has been fiercely disputed by the top three U.S. carriers for good reason. Eight of every 10 passengers in Latin America traveling outside the region are bound for North America, according to industry group ALTA.\n\nFollowing its breakup with Chile-based LATAM last month, American Airlines quickly announced new flights next year from Miami to Chile and Peru \u2014 destinations where the two had been coordinating their routes with regulatory approval.\n\n\u201cThis shows you that the (American-LATAM) partnership ultimately ended up undermining supply,\u201d said Carlos Ozores, a principal at consulting company ICF. \u201cThere was no competition because these were two carriers that coordinated their fares and worked as one.\u201d\n\nAmerican said it had \u201cexpanded routes and lowered prices\u201d as a result of its coordination with LATAM in Chile and Peru.\n\nThe combined strength of LATAM and American ultimately doomed their partnership, as Chile\u2019s top court ruled in May that they could not expand their cooperation on travel to the United States.\n\nBy contrast, Delta\u2019s historic weakness in the region has become a distinct advantage, allowing it to leapfrog competitors without facing as much regulatory scrutiny.\n\n\u201cAmerican and LATAM had a number of overlaps that created issues,\u201d Delta Chief Legal Officer Peter Carter told investors last month. \u201cAnd we just don\u2019t have that here.\u201d\n\nLATAM declined to comment.\n\nAmerican said in a statement it \u201cremains the largest U.S. carrier to both Latin and South America and we look forward to competing and growing in this region of the world.\u201d\n\nAmerican also announced an additional daily flight from Miami to Sao Paulo starting in 2020, a market where it did not have the level of coordination as in Chile or Peru. This will create stiffer competition, especially in Miami, a hub for both LATAM and American and a top destination for Latin Americans.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very risky move because Delta is not very strong in Miami and American is very strong there,\u201d said Luis Felipe Oliveira, ALTA\u2019s executive director.\n\nBEYOND BRAZIL\n\nDelta has worked for much of the past decade to improve its standing in Latin America, investing in Brazil\u2019s Gol Linhas Aereas (GOLL4.SA) in 2011 and Grupo Aeromexico (AEROMEX.MX) the next year. In 2016, it made an offer for Colombia\u2019s Avianca Holdings AVT_p.CN, but was rebuffed in favor of United.\n\nIn recent years, Delta has grown frustrated with the Gol partnership, which did little for its South American push beyond Brazil. LATAM and Avianca have broader regional ambitions, investing in domestic airlines outside their home markets.\n\n\u201cSo the natural thought is ... that produces a return that\u2019s below your average return,\u201d Glen Hauenstein, Delta\u2019s president, told investors last month regarding the prior regional strategy.\n\nDelta is in the process of selling its stake in Gol, and redoubling efforts in Colombia, Chile and Peru, which account for a combined 45% of South American travel to the United States, compared with just 29% percent from Brazil.\n\nAir traffic in each of the three countries is expected to more than triple between 2020 and 2040, according to a forecast prepared by CAF, a Latin American development bank owned by countries in the region.\n\nColombia even rivals Brazil for U.S. travel. Last year, 3 million travelers flew between Brazil and North America, compared with 2.7 million who flew between Colombia and North America, according to worldwide industry group IATA. Colombia, which has a quarter of the population of Brazil, is also expected to grow its economy more quickly than its larger neighbor.\n\n\u201cThe major market that we want to be in is Colombia,\u201d Delta\u2019s Hauenstein said.\n\nLATAM is already making ambitious moves there. In May, it announced a $300 million investment in Colombia aimed at challenging market leader Avianca, which has allied with United and Copa Holdings (CPA.N) in their own regional play.\n\nDelta is hoping it is arriving in time to reap the benefits of LATAM\u2019s groundwork.", "description": "A surprise $1.9 billion investment by Delta Air Lines in LATAM Airlines Group is likely to fire up competition in South America as the weakest U.S. carrier in the region joins up with the strongest homegrown player.", "authors": ["Marcelo Rochabrun", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1438145901&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF961C3-OCABS", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
