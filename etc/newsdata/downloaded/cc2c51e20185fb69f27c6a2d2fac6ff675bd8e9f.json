Republicans and Democrats will debate the resolution there, but any changes would require majority consent. Democrats hold a 9-4 edge over Republicans in the committee, virtually assuring the Rules Democrats will prevail in any contested dispute over the resolution.\n\nJ. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nHouse Republican aides criticized Democrats for bifurcating the impeachment process between the House Judiciary and Intelligence committees, arguing that Democrats have \u201cno justification\u201d for denying Trump and his counsel the same due process rights and ability to take part in hearings across panels.\n\nThey also argued that Democrats aren\u2019t making the process transparent by denying Trump and his counsel access to investigative materials that the House Intelligence Committee gathers but does not report to the Judiciary Committee.\n\nWhile the terms set forward for the Judiciary Committee are \u201ccertainly closer\u201d to past precedent, one aide said, it\u2019s a \u201cmatter of how Democrats will want to carry it out.\u201d\n\nPelosi and Democrats took similar heat from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who will oversee a Senate trial, if it comes to that.\n\nCalling it a \"bizarre process,\" McConnell said, \"The resolution merely seems to contemplate that maybe, maybe someday in the future at some other phase of this due process might -- might finally kick in. But only if the House Judiciary Committee feels like holding hearings and calling its own witnesses. in other words, no due process now, maybe some later, but only if we feel like it.\"\n\nA full House vote on the resolution is expected to conclude Thursday before lawmakers split town for a 10-day recess.\n\nThe vote is not expected to win unanimity in the 234-member Democratic Caucus, though Democrats appear confident they\u2019ll get a simple majority \u2013 217 votes \u2013 to clear the resolution.\n\nAlex Wong/Getty Images, FILE\n\nFreshman Democratic Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, who represents a congressional district carried by President Trump in 2016, said he plans to vote against the measure.\n\n\"I just believe it's the right thing to do. I think we've spent all this time and all this money, all this energy, all this effort, and all this toxicity exists here, because of what's going on. I want to get bills done,\" Van Drew, D-N.J., said. \"I've seen things that are distasteful and make you feel uncomfortable, and I don't like they way they termed, I don't see them as impeachable.\"\n\nThe National Republican Campaign Committee has sent more than a dozen emails targeting vulnerable Democrats, including Van Drew, whose votes on impeachment could imperil their reelection prospects next year.\n\n\u201cThe obsession the socialist Democrats have with impeaching President Trump instead of accomplishing the things they promised on the campaign trail will cost them their majority next November,\" NRCC Chairman Tom Emmer, R-Minn., noted.\n\nThe House of Representatives is not in session next week, so any public hearings at the House Intelligence Committee are not expected to commence until the week of Nov. 11 at the earliest.\n\nABC News' Trish Turner contributed to this report.", "description": "House Democrats will vote Thursday to pass a resolution laying out the process and procedures for open hearings for the impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/pelosi-nc-jt-191030_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
