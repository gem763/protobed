It forces great people, and real leaders, to leave after serving,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cThe Dems have unlimited terms. While that has its own problems, it is a better way to go. Fewer people, in the end, will leave!\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nTrump has advocated for term limits for members of Congress, but had not previously weighed in on caucus rules governing the amount of time Republican members can maintain plum assignments managing powerful committees.\n\nGOP lawmakers are allowed to serve as the top lawmakers on congressional panels for only three terms \u2014 regardless of whether they are committee leaders or ranking members.\n\nIt is possible Trump\u2019s latest suggestion is in reaction to some House Republicans' fears that term limits are contributing to a wave of announced resignations by some senior GOP members.\n\nBut while the caps have prompted complaints from some within the Republican Party, others have argued the turnover in chairmanships has brought fresh blood into the top ranks of the GOP \u2014 unlike the Democratic Party, which imposes no limits on its committee chairmanships.\n\nFormer House Agriculture Committee Chairman Mike Conaway (R-Texas) and former House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Rob Bishop (R-Utah) \u2014 currently the ranking members on their respective committees \u2014 said in July they would not seek reelection in 2020.", "description": "GOP lawmakers are only allowed to serve as the top lawmakers on congressional panels for three terms.", "authors": ["Quint Forgey"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/36/0a/aff08ea841e5aa76edddb4bc50d7/190909-donald-trump-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
