The level of your offending is increasing and not diminishing.\"\n\nWest Midlands Police have today released dramatic footage of the seconds immediately prior to the incident when several officers try to arrest Hussain and his criminal associates.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nPC Phillips, 42, was responding to reports of a car theft at 4pm after a Range Rover Sport was taken from a car park in Tyseley.\n\nIt was tracked to Moseley where Hussain was found behind the wheel of the stolen Range Rover - alongside another Range Rover stolen the previous day in Sparkbrook - with fellow car thief Ahsan Ghafoor in the front passenger seat.\n\nGhafoor was swiftly arrested but Hussain - who was banned from driving for four years in May last year - fought back and despite being Tasered managed to force his way past officers and jump into a police traffic car.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\nThe officer clung onto the driver\u2019s door but was flung to the floor when Hussain slammed the car into reverse - and was left defenceless, prone on the ground, when the 29-year-old accelerated away and drove over him with both sets of wheels.\n\nHussain drove around the Moseley area at speeds of up to 97mph before abandoning the vehicle 10 minutes later in Balsall Heath, where he was confronted by armed police and detained.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nIn interview Hussain apologised and claimed to \u201cfeel bad\" for what he\u2019d done, suggesting it was \u201cmadness\" and that he\u2019d \u201cpanicked\" having been confronted by police.\n\nToday it can be revealed that Hussain has four previous convictions for dangerous driving and has also been jailed for car theft and conspiring to steal motor vehicles.\n\nA victim impact statement on behalf of PC Phillips told how he blacked out at the time but came round in the road to \u201cpain I can\u2019t describe\u2026 but pain I had never felt before\".\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\nHe added: \u201cI spent two weeks in intensive care and I\u2019m told the first operation was \u2018life-saving\u2019.\n\n\"It\u2019s too early to say what my long-term prognosis will be and I\u2019m certainly facing more surgery in the weeks and months to come.\n\n\u201cIt is unclear if I will ever be able to return to work - but being a Police Officer is a job that I love.\n\n\"It is something I have done for almost the two decades, and will do everything I can to get back into policing.\"\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\nWest Midlands Police Head of Traffic, Superintendent Dave Twyford, praised the bravery of PC Phillips and his colleagues.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhat Gaz did that day was no different to any other in his 14 years as a traffic cop: he was on the hunt for car thieves and trying to protect the public.\n\n\"It\u2019s a job he\u2019s brilliant at -there are countless criminals who can testify to that - and I\u2019ve heard people say many times how he lives for the job and is a copper through and through.\n\n\u201cWhat happened on the afternoon of 10 August was nothing short of horrific. Gaz suffered awful injuries. He could have died.\n\n\u201cHowever, the doctors and staff at Queen Elizabeth Hospital did a fantastic job, he\u2019s come through several surgeries and thankfully responded well to treatment.\n\n\"In fact, he\u2019s defied medical predictions with his recovery to date.\n\n\"But it will be long road to recovery, there is no doubt about that, and everyone in West Midlands Police wishes him well in that recovery.\"\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\nHussain's co-defendant, Ahsan Ghafoor, who threw a brick towards a police car, was jailed for 28 months after admitting two counts of car theft and three other offences including dangerous driving.\n\nJudge Wall told Hussain he will serve at least two-thirds of the 12-year sentence - and be required to spend an extended five-year period on licence following his eventual release.", "description": "Mubashar Hussain has been jailed for 12 years for causing grievous bodily harm of 42-year-old PC Gaz Phillips in Moseley, Birmingham", "authors": ["Tom Davidson", "Image", "Pa", "Swns"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20586005.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Mubashar-Hussain-court-case.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
