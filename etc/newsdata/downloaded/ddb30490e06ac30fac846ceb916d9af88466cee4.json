So I am a devoted Harry fan.\n\nHowever, when I watched the clip of him struggling to hold back tears at the WellChild Awards in London on Tuesday night, I felt uneasy. I think he got it wrong on this occasion.\n\nDr Max Pemberton argues Prince Harry's (pictured being comforted by host Gaby Roslin) tears at the WellChild Awards in London on Tuesday night were out of place\n\nThese awards are about celebrating seriously ill children, their families and their carers, but his words were all about him.\n\nLast year at the same awards, he revealed on Tuesday, he and his wife Meghan \u2018knew we were expecting our first child . . . and I remember squeezing Meghan\u2019s hand so tight during the awards, both of us thinking what it would be like to be parents one day, and more so, what it would be like to do everything we could to protect and help our child should they be born with immediate challenges or become unwell over time\u2019.\n\nHe continued: \u2018Now as parents, being here speaking to all of you, pulls at my heart strings in a way I could never have understood until I had a child of my own.\u2019\n\nBy breaking down while talking about his own experiences as a new father, he \u2018colonised\u2019 the event \u2014 he made it about him, rather than the people in the audience.\n\nSuddenly, the spotlight swung away from them and their day-to-day struggles to a man \u2014 a member of the Royal Family, no less \u2014 who was essentially shedding tears about his own worries.\n\nSurely he could see that his anxieties pale into insignificance when compared with those of the families he was there to meet?\n\nThe NHS psychiatrist (pictured) who is a devoted Harry fan, recounts the Prince encouraging a young woman at an awards ceremony a few years ago\n\nIt was an uncharacteristic faux pas from someone who typically gets the mood music just right.\n\nPrince Harry is a remarkable man who knows he is subject to intense scrutiny. And yet, on the whole, he manages this with grace and dignity. At least, that is my experience of him.\n\nA few years ago, I was presenting at an awards ceremony for a mental health charity where he gave the keynote speech.\n\nLater, he shared the stage with a young woman who had suffered with mental health problems and who had won an award. She was clearly nervous, and I saw him gently guide her towards the microphone. The Prince stood close and nodded encouragement as she made a spontaneous speech to the 1,000-strong audience.\n\nShe relaxed and seemed to grow in confidence, and it was entirely thanks to him and his empathy.\n\nDuring a lull in the schedule, Harry remained at her side, laughing and joking with her as though they were old friends. It occurred to me then how remarkable it is to have been born into such privilege, but to be able to connect with people so intensely and instantly.\n\nDr Max Pemberton says if Prince Harry had used his words instead of tears, the focus would've remained on the people who really mattered\n\nPrince Harry has an incredible skill in being able to put others at ease. He is a real credit to the Royal Family \u2014 able to muster just the right balance of grandeur and occasion. But the WellChild Awards were different. This was a celebration of sick children and their families, and a recognition of their achievements and fortitude.\n\nAs a former Army officer, Harry should have been able to master his feelings.\n\nIn my work as a psychiatrist, I spend my days encouraging people to talk openly, but public displays of emotion like this smack of attention-seeking. Crying is a form of communication, but it has its limits; far better to use words.\n\nAnd then the people who really mattered that night would have remained the focus \u2014 which I am sure, deep down, is what Harry would have wanted anyway.\n\nNonsense . . . they showed he really cares\n\nAuthor and campaigner Henrietta Spink is a carer for her two severely disabled sons.\n\nWhen I saw footage of Prince Harry failing to contain his emotion at the WellChild Awards, my heart went out to him.\n\nMy sons Henry, 31, and Freddie, 27, both need round-the-clock care, and I was deeply moved by the empathy and compassion the Prince showed.\n\nHe clearly didn\u2019t mean to break down, and the audience knew that. When he bowed his head, hands gripping the lectern as he tried to collect himself, they rightly broke into applause.\n\nAs parents and carers of sick children, they could see, as I could, that here was a man who, for all his privilege, seems to understand and care deeply about how difficult life can be for them. I didn\u2019t think it was \u2018inappropriate\u2019 or that he should \u2018get a grip\u2019, as some critics have said. Quite the opposite. To me, the tears he was choking back showed he \u2018got it\u2019.\n\nHenrietta Spink (pictured) who has looked after her two severely disabled sons for more than 30 years, says she was moved by Prince Harry's compassion and empathy\n\nMost parents of healthy children never give a moment\u2019s thought to what life would be like if their son or daughter had been born with severe health problems, or became seriously ill in childhood.\n\nThey can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like to be more or less permanently exhausted and always desperate with worry.\n\nMy husband and I have looked after the boys for more than 30 years and I haven\u2019t had a proper night\u2019s sleep in all that time.\n\nOur eldest, Henry, is nearly 6ft tall, has terrible epilepsy and doesn\u2019t talk, walk or feed himself. Freddie is mobile and full of life, but falls easily and is autistic and very hyperactive.\n\nI love them both dearly but life is hard, not only from looking after the boys but from fighting the system to get them the care they deserve. Often we feel abandoned, isolated from a world that doesn\u2019t understand what we\u2019re going through.\n\nPrince Harry does understand, as he showed on Tuesday night. He was blessed with a healthy child, but his tears show he doesn\u2019t take his good fortune for granted.\n\nTalking to sick children and their parents and siblings, hearing of their pain, their struggles and the tremendous courage they show, is harrowing for anyone. But for Harry, who lost his mother when he was just 12 and is a new father himself . . . well, it\u2019s no wonder he was briefly overcome.\n\nI have encountered every type of human emotion towards my situation, from warm sympathy to unbelievably cold-hearted comments about my sons, such as \u2018you should just get rid of them\u2019.\n\nFor me, Harry was demonstrating nothing but his innate kindness. I only hope that some further good may come of it.", "description": "Dr Max Pemberton says Prince Harry made a faux pas when he shed tears at the WellChild Awards.
