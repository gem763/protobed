Meanwhile, New Zealand's Beauden Barrett, the best player in the world, was completely out of the action on the day.\n\nHere, Sportsmail rates each England and New Zealand player out of 10 for their performance in the semi-final match.\n\nMaro Itoje put in a stupendous performance in the skies, on the floor, and on the beaches\n\nSam Underhill (right) had one of the most destructive tackling performances by a forward\n\nEngland\n\nElliot Daly 8\n\nEarly break down the right set the tone for a special English night. Had to move to wing when May went off.\n\nAnthony Watson 8\n\nJinky feet out wide kept the Kiwis guessing. Ran 81 metres and beat five defenders.\n\nManu Tuilagi (Joseph, 74 7) 8\n\nRushed up on the New Zealanders to give them no time, and with the ball caused yet more havoc.\n\nAnthony Watson was up for the occasion, getting past New Zealand when he got the ball\n\nOwen Farrell 8\n\nBashed up several times by the Kiwis but battled on - of course he did.\n\nJonny May (Slade, 45 7.5) 7\n\nPoor bloke surely was not fully fit - highlighted by the fact that he could not outpace Scott Barrett when away. Limped off.\n\nGeorge Ford 8.5\n\nHad to kick when Farrell took knocks - and did it brilliantly, to goal and to the corners.\n\nGeorge Ford Had to kick when Farrell took knocks - and did it brilliantly, to goal and corners\n\nBen Youngs (Heinz, 64 7) 8\n\nEngland's lightning-quick tempo all from his ruck-and-run style.\n\nMako Vunipola (Marler, 70 7.5) 8\n\nBody of a rhino, hands like a pianist. Could well be seen as England's best ever prop soon.\n\nJamie George (Cowan-Dickie, 70 7) 7.5\n\nLineout suffered one glaring blip when an overthrow set Savea in - otherwise excellent.\n\nKyle Sinckler (Cole, 47 7.5) 8\n\nHis hands are so silky. One of the big areas of improvement in English rugby is the handling of the forwards.\n\nMaro Itoje 9.5\n\nStupendous performance in the skies, on the floor, on the beaches and in the streets. Better than finest hour in Wellington for the Lions.\n\nManu Tuilagi scores England's opening try within the first two minutes of the semi-final match\n\nCourtney Lawes 9 (Kruis, 55 7)\n\nOutstanding in the lineout, and a whacking presence everywhere else.\n\nTom Curry 9.5\n\nSensational at the breakdown. This lad was nine years old when New Zealand last lost at the World Cup.\n\nSam Underhill 9.5 (Wilson, 70 7)\n\nHas there been a more destructive tackling performance by an England forward? He is just 23.\n\nBilly Vunipola 8.5\n\nA week away from sitting alongside Lawrence Dallaglio as England's greatest No 8.\n\nCoach: Eddie Jones 9.5\n\nThe game he was employed to win. He did. Tactics absolutely spot on from the first second.\n\nEngland coach Eddie Jones' tactics were absolutely spot on from the first second of the game\n\nNew Zealand\n\nBeauden Barrett 5\n\nBest player in the world but did not show it here. Out of the action.\n\nSevu Reece 5\n\nWent close in second half but did not get many chances to shine.\n\nJack Goodhue 6\n\nGood defence and snuffed out early England chance in a solid night.\n\nBeauden Barret may be the best player in the world but did not show it here. Out of the action\n\nAnton Lienert-Brown 5\n\nHad a great tournament but had his hands full with England midfield.\n\nGeorge Bridge 4\n\nHauled off after 50 minutes after failing to land a telling blow.\n\nRichie Mo\u2019unga 5\n\nIntroduction at 10 has been a success but hit buffers here.\n\nAaron Smith 5\n\nAnother All Black not himself and failed to impose self on game.\n\nJoe Moody 5\n\nDidn\u2019t get much change out of Kyle Sinckler at scrum time.\n\nSam Whitelock had a reckless challenge on Owen Farrell before being pulled out of the fray\n\nCodie Taylor 5\n\n50th cap for the hooker did not go to plan and off after 50 minutes.\n\nNepe Laulala 5\n\nHad ball ripped off him by Owen Farrell early on and up against it at scrum.\n\nBrodie Retallick 4\n\nOne big break in first half but overshadowed by Maro Itoje.\n\nSam Whitelock 4\n\nReckless challenge on Owen Farrell before being pulled out of the fray.\n\nArdie Savea's second half try got New Zealand back into game but that was his first impact\n\nScott Barrett 4\n\nOnly lasted a half and didn\u2019t manage to disrupt the England line out.\n\nArdie Savea 5\n\nSecond half try got New Zealand back into game but that was his first impact.\n\nKieran Read (capt) 5\n\nGot demolished by one Sam Underhill tackle and quiet night for the skipper. 5\n\nReplacements used: Dane Coles 5, Ofa Tuungafasi 5, Angus Ta'avao 5, Patrick Tuipulotu 5, Sam Cane 6, T J Perenara 5, Sonny Bill Williams 5, Jordie Barrett 5\n\nCoach: Steve Hansen 5\n\nGamble of playing Scott Barrett at No.6 did not work but he admitted mistake.\n\nReferee: Nigel Owens 7\n\nA couple of dodgy calls - largely from the influence of TMO Marius Jonker, though.", "description": "England put in a tremendous performance to beat New Zealand 19-7 and reach the Rugby World Cup final.\u00a0Sportsmail rates each of the players out of 10.", "authors": ["Will Kelleher", "Adam Hathaway For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/11/20213082-0-image-a-60_1572085431268.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
