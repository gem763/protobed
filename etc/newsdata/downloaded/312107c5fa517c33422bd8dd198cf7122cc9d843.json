There\u2019s plenty of time for him to continue to improve and be ready for October, but any setbacks could alter his availability.\n\nScherzer\u2019s status is one that could have wide-ranging implications.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to take it day by day, and we\u2019re still trying to get that playoff spot so nothing is assumed,\u201d Nationals pitching coach Paul Menhart told Yahoo Sports before Scherzer allowed four runs in six innings in the Nationals\u2019 miraculous 11-10 win over the Mets. \u201cWe need him at his best as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nTrying to be Mad Max\n\nFor so long, Scherzer has been one of the constants in the sport. He takes the ball every fifth day and dominates, often in spectacular fashion. Scherzer can own a game like few others. There\u2019s a reason he\u2019s won three Cy Young Awards.\n\nYet, for seemingly the first time in his Nationals tenure, there is some uncertainty surrounding Scherzer. A back strain is no minor issue, and the Nationals are proceeding cautiously to ensure they keep their ace as healthy as possible.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Nationals have a six-game lead in the wild-card race, and since Atlanta won\u2019t slow down, it seems the Nationals will be playing in the wild-card game on Oct. 1.\n\nFacing Scherzer in an elimination game normally would seem like a nightmare, but there\u2019s no guarantee at the moment that he will be back to full strength. And if he\u2019s not back to form, the Nationals would have a tough call to make for that game.\n\nThe onus is thus on the Nationals coaches and Scherzer to do all they can to have him as close to 100 percent for Oct. 1. If they have to go to the bullpen earlier than normal this month, so be it. Scherzer is that important.\n\nMenhart said he\u2019s been keeping a closer eye on Scherzer between starts just to make sure everything is going smoothly. He added that Scherzer has not altered his mechanics, which is key since altering any steps in his delivery could lead to more injuries since more stress would be placed on other body parts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a progression, and more of how he\u2019s feeling and how we\u2019re going to use him and how amped up he wants to get with each outing,\u201d Menhart said. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely monitoring him throughout the week and making sure he feels as normal as possible. We watch him during the games, and more importantly, see how he recovers the next day.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe\u2019re just being extra aware. This is something he hasn\u2019t had to endure before.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Nationals are working to get starting pitcher Max Scherzer ready for a potential wild-card game after two back injuries. (Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sports)\n\nUpping the intensity\n\nWednesday is one of those days when the Nationals will be checking in on Scherzer since it comes after his longest outing since being activated from the injured list. Scherzer threw 90 pitches over six innings after topping out at 89 pitches spanning 4.1 innings in his first two starts after returning.\n\nThe Nationals wanted to let Scherzer increased his intensity against the Mets.\n\n\u201cHe turns the corner today, and he\u2019s full go,\u201d Nationals manager Davey Martinez said before the game.\n\nScherzer showcased enough Tuesday to warrant optimism, although it\u2019s clear he\u2019s still not quite right yet, which is to be expected at this point.\n\nWhile Scherzer allowed just one total base runner in five of his innings, he ran into problems in the fourth inning, and that four-run frame defined his night.\n\nScherzer acknowledged that he exerted himself more Tuesday, throwing his pitches at 100 percent after being more passive in his previous starts.\n\nIn that fourth inning, his command evaded him at times while he dialed up the effort, and the Mets capitalized by ambushing his first pitches.\n\nFour hitters registered hits on first pitches, including light-hitting infielder Joe Panik, who hit a two-run homer to right-center to give the Mets a 4-1 lead.\n\nScherzer\u2019s fastball sat 94-97 mph, in line with his season numbers, and he still managed to induce 15 swings and misses.\n\n\u201cPicking up the intensity on a per pitch basis was higher tonight than it has been the past two starts. That\u2019s why I feel like today was a good step forward,\u201d said Scherzer, who is lined up to make four more starts this season. \u201cThese are big league hitters, they can hit any mistake you make so when I\u2019m cranking up the intensity I have to keep the location where I want to throw a ball and there were a couple that leaked over the middle of the plate where I didn\u2019t execute it quite the right way. Take your lumps, move forward, and try to sharpen everything up.\u201d\n\nScherzer hoped to stay in for the seventh inning, but Martinez didn\u2019t let the righty win that battle.\n\n\u201cI told him, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s think about the big picture,\u2019\u201d Martinez said. \u201c\u2018You feel great, that\u2019s six innings from you. Let\u2019s just build from there.\u201d\n\nLess than four weeks to go\n\nThe one advantage the Nationals have over most teams is that should Scherzer not return to form, they have two capable replacements for that wild-card game in righty Stephen Strasburg and southpaw Patrick Corbin.\n\nYet, for as talented as those two are, these Nationals will not be nearly as feared come October if Scherzer isn\u2019t the growling strikeout machine that he normally is.\n\nThe Nationals need Scherzer back if this franchise is finally going to win its first playoff series and end all its October frustration.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s giving us a chance to win every single time, striking guys out and being Max. I think as the time goes and he gets more comfortable, everything starts clicking for him, you\u2019ll see that mad Max out there,\u201d said Tuesday\u2019s walk-off hero, catcher Kurt Suzuki. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re waiting for. He\u2019s obviously in my eyes the best pitcher in the game right now. You\u2019ll take him every fifth day.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The Nationals are working Max Scherzer through a progression to have him ready to go for the postseason.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/kU_rs3bpkCPC2wEbe13q7g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gqN1wYpT7Gb.w2HrNaETGA--~B/aD0yMDAwO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/cc488b50-cef0-11e9-9777-5faea91bcdb3"}
