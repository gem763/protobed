Trump promptly filed an appeal.\n\nIn a brief filed on Friday, Trump\u2019s lawyers took issue with Marrero\u2019s ruling, maintaining that the federal courts can exercise jurisdiction over the case and that the subpoena is unconstitutional because presidents can\u2019t be subject to the criminal process.\n\nBut the district attorney's office argued that the appeals court should agree with the lower court's conclusions: that Trump hasn\u2019t shown that he\u2019d suffer irreparable harm if Mazars complied with the subpoena, and that Trump is unlikely to win on the merits of his case.\n\n\u201cControlling precedent confirms that a sitting president must comply with this subpoena,\u201d the district attorney\u2019s office said.\n\nProsecutors also argued the federal appeals court should abstain from exercising jurisdiction over the case because there\u2019s an ongoing state criminal proceeding.\n\nIn addition to Trump\u2019s lawyers, the Department of Justice (DOJ) also filed a brief in the case, arguing that the subpoena should be blocked until, at a minimum, the district attorney\u2019s office shows a specific need for the documents.\n\nThe Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office on Tuesday argued that DOJ\u2019s proposed standard \u201cis contrary to the law.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is well settled that the burden rests on the party challenging a subpoena to show that quashing is appropriate under established standards,\u201d prosecutors wrote.\n\nThe appeals court has scheduled oral arguments for Oct. 23 and has stayed enforcement of the subpoena until that time.\n\nTrump argued that if the appeals court affirms the lower court\u2019s ruling, it should stay enforcement of the subpoena until the president files a petition to the Supreme court.\n\nBut the district attorney\u2019s office argued that Trump shouldn\u2019t be granted his requested stay, calling it \u201cunjustified.\u201d", "description": "The Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office on Tuesday urged a federal appeals court to deny President Trump\u2019s effort to block prosecutors\u2019 subpoena for his tax returns.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_082619getty_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
