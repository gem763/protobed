But with Cynthia Erivo making the press rounds in support of her Harriet Tubman biopic Harriet, we thought it fitting to ask her about her last trip through the fall prestige season, on Steve McQueen\u2019s Widows. After a successful stage career first in her native Britain, then on Broadway, Erivo made her film debut in the crime caper, playing a hairstylist named Belle who joins the three titular widows as a last-minute sub in their scheme to steal millions of dollars from a Chicago mansion. It\u2019s a muscular performance, both in terms of physical strain and emotional power: In her handful of scenes, Erivo makes it clear that this Belle won\u2019t bend for anyone.\n\nThanks to McQueen\u2019s Oscar pedigree, Widows originally seemed like it could become a player in the end-of-year awards race, but after the film\u2019s rousing debut at TIFF 2018, nothing else went to plan. Though critics were generally kind, the film opened to a disappointing $12 million, fizzling any festival buzz. It quickly vanished from the awards landscape, with a BAFTA nomination for star Viola Davis as its only recognition from the major ceremonies. In a short phone conversation with Vulture recently, Erivo reflected on the entire Widows experience.\n\nWidows was the first movie role you ever shot. What do you know about screen acting now that you didn\u2019t know when you stepped onto the set for the first time?\n\nI think the impression that I had was that you needed to be much quieter on a set than you would have to be onstage. But actually, sometimes that\u2019s not helpful. Your vocal presence has to be a little bit bigger than I thought in my head. And it took me some time to get used to seeing myself onscreen. I\u2019ll watch it once and then it\u2019ll freak me out for a little bit, and I\u2019ll need to take some time away from something and then watch it again. You need a break to see it with different eyes.\n\nIs there a scene that struck you this way when you watched it for the first time?\n\nThere\u2019s a scene I didn\u2019t think was as powerful when I was doing it, until I watched it. It\u2019s the scene where Belle comes in to meet the three ladies. She meets Viola\u2019s character, and she says, \u201cYou have to watch how you talk to me.\u201d There\u2019s something about that moment, that I didn\u2019t realize was possible. In the room when you\u2019re filming it, it feels good, but you don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to play. It played so much more fiery than I thought it would.\n\nWhat kind of conversations did you have with Steve around that moment?\n\nSteve wanted me to be as confident as possible. Nothing held back, because that\u2019s not who Belle is. She\u2019s been through enough to get to the point where she doesn\u2019t have to pretend. He kept saying that she\u2019s probably more versed in the thing that they\u2019re afraid to do. She\u2019s had to fend for herself for a while, and these ladies are just coming into it.\n\nWe interviewed Elizabeth Debicki back when the movie came out, and she mentioned how there were a ton of night shoots that put her in this weird zombie headspace. Did you feel the same way?\n\nI don\u2019t think I felt that way as much, just because I was moving around a lot on set. It felt cool, \u2018cause whenever we would have the nighttime shoots, it was the four of us together, sort of this army team. But even when we were in those shoots, I was moving, whether it was when I was boxing or when I\u2019m packing the boxes. I was seeing different things all the time and having to use my energy in different ways.\n\nFor those scenes where you have so much movement, how does that affect your performance on the day?\n\nAs human beings, when our body\u2019s connected, I feel like the words become more grounded. Because when we\u2019re moving, we can\u2019t help but to breathe in the right way. Just because we\u2019re human beings and we move \u2014 even when we\u2019re still, there\u2019s still movement going on, and I think that the more we can do that, the better it is on film. Then, when stillness does occur, it\u2019s super effective.\n\nAre you comfortable talking about what your fitness regiment was?\n\nOh, yeah. These films tend to ask of me some physical fitness, so I was training training. I was going crazy. I was doing a lot of body-weight work. I lifted a little bit, not very much because I had to stay lean. I was running a lot, so I could make sure that my speed stayed up. I was doing everything from CrossFit to jump rope. And when I couldn\u2019t get to the gym, I had Skype sessions with my trainer. When I saw it I was like, Oh, it does show up. Because sometimes you can\u2019t see it unless it\u2019s shown to you.\n\nViola got really jacked, too! Did you all work out together, or did everyone just do their own thing?\n\nShe was also training at the same time, I know that much. And she was eating in a specific way. Viola, I just love her, I think she\u2019s super cool, but I don\u2019t think she gives herself enough credit. I don\u2019t think she realizes how fit she looks.\n\nIn your final scene with her, neither of you says anything.\n\nIt\u2019s just a look. I was like, This is gonna be quite nice, but I\u2019m not sure whether it\u2019ll read. You\u2019re thinking the things you want to say, and hoping it comes through your eyes and your senses, but you don\u2019t know until you see it. And when I saw it, I was like, Oh, that. I\u2019m pleased about that.\n\nHow do you interpret that look?\n\nObviously it\u2019s a good-bye, but I also think it\u2019s like, Take care. One of us is deathly injured, and we\u2019ve just about escaped from near death, and we\u2019ve managed to get everything, but it\u2019s sort of like, \ufeffThis is a mess, but okay. What else do we do? Nothing else. And the look I get back from her, I always feel like it\u2019s like, We can\u2019t have this conversation. But take care of yourself. There\u2019s a deep understanding between the two of them that something has gone on, but we can never really speak of it again.\n\nWhat did you learn from Viola?\n\nTo be a little more confident on set. For my first film, you can\u2019t help yourself being nervous. To be able to watch her work, she works with a real sureness. If she doesn\u2019t know something, she\u2019s not afraid to say, \u201cI don\u2019t know something.\u201d If she needs help with something, she\u2019s not afraid to ask for help. If she doesn\u2019t like something, she\u2019s not afraid to say, \u201cI\u2019m not sure about this.\u201d I loved seeing that. I think it\u2019s really helped me in the past couple of films. Being sure in the \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d being sure in the \u201cI really do know,\u201d being sure in the \u201cThis feels uncomfortable,\u201d being sure in the \u201cIt\u2019s great,\u201d being sure in the \u201cI\u2019m gonna break my ankle if I do this.\u201d You know what I\u2019m saying? It might take a while to learn that, but I was lucky because I had her.\n\nYou don\u2019t sing in Widows, but you do in Harriet and Bad Times at the El Royale. Does getting a musical scene make you more comfortable taking a job? Or does it make you more nervous because it\u2019s an additional thing that you have to do?\n\nIt doesn\u2019t make me more nervous. Does it make me comfortable? I\u2019ve never really thought of it making me comfortable. I feel lucky that I\u2019m able to have something else to give. It always excites me when more is requested of me. Singing is part of the language I speak, so I am always excited when I get to use it. I feel it helps infuse the character with more of me, but I also get to explore: Am I sounding like me, or should I change it so I can sound a little different? So I guess it does make me more comfortable. It gives me more of a task to do, but I like that. I like when there\u2019s work to do.\n\nI heard there was originally a scene in Widows where you did sing, but it got cut.\n\nWell, yes, but I think it was there and then done quite quickly, to be honest. I don\u2019t think we needed it. Steve, very cleverly, was like, \u201cPeople need to see you as pure as possible, no singing, no anything.\u201d And I really appreciated that. What\u2019s really fun now is that some people are just discovering that I sing because they came to me through Widows.\n\nI also read that part of the backstory you and Steve came up with was that Belle was bi. How did that come about?\n\nYou just don\u2019t see that onscreen very often. And I think that it meant that all her life wasn\u2019t based on a man. Yes, she had to have had her child with someone, but it meant that that wasn\u2019t the entire story, you know? I feel like it makes her complex. The way she loves is different. I don\u2019t know, I just like that about her. It gives her something different, like an edge that no one would see coming.\n\nIt\u2019s another little thing that makes her different from the other three, who are defined even in the film\u2019s title through their relationships to the men.\n\nI think so, yeah. I also think it leaves the possibility that, instead of being left, maybe she decided that that wasn\u2019t the right relationship for her. It gives her that choice, almost.\n\nI was there when Widows premiered at TIFF, and I remember there was so much electricity in the room that night. And then the movie came out, and while it did okay, it didn\u2019t have the same kind of journey that people maybe expected. How do you look back on that experience now with a year of hindsight?\n\nI was sad for Steve, and I wanted more for Viola \u2018cause I thought she was exceptional in it. I hadn\u2019t seen her in anything like that, where she got to show this fierce, tough, ready, take-no-rubbish-from-anyone type side of her, and I absolutely adored it. And I think that I had a great time doing it, and I wish everyone got to really see it shine because I think it\u2019s brilliant. But I think maybe it\u2019s coming into its own. I always think that it will be one of those things that people will go back and think, Oh my gosh, this was really, really good! There\u2019s something that\u2019s super messy about Widows, which I loved. There\u2019s an expectation of a heist movie to be slick and tidy, and it just wasn\u2019t that. I think that was its charm, but I\u2019m not sure that everyone quite understood that. But maybe we\u2019re getting to a place where people will.", "description": "As Cynthia Erivo makes the promotional rounds to support her Harriet Tubman biopic \u201cHarriet,\u201d we asked her to revisit her first film role: Steve McQueen\u2019s \u201cWidows.\u201d", "authors": ["Nate Jones"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/23/23-cynthia-erivo-widows-role-call-lede.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
