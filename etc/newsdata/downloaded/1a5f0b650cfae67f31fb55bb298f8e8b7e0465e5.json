It was an easy way to make your room feel more personal and homely,\" she said.", "description": "Artworks have been loaned to students for six decades, with none damaged so far.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1457E/production/_109062338_studentpictureloan3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
