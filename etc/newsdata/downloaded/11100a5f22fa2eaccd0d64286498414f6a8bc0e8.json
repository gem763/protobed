For me, the most important thing is the mentality, to do what you want to do. I want to act,\" she said.\n\nIn early September, Mimi confirmed that she and husband Li Wen have actually been divorced for the past two years due to irreconcilable differences.\n\nSaid Mimi's manager, \"They both live in two different places for a long time. Different locations and lifestyles made both sides feel that they need their own space. The children also understood and respected their decisions.\"\n\n(Photo Source: Mingpao)", "description": "The Hong Kong actress just wants to do what she wants now that her divorce is known", "authors": ["Heidi Hsia"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/CYzzkXi2FFRo5hAVGNgrUQ--~B/aD03Njg7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ybrand.cinema.com.my/2616da292f8f7f9ec32d67ca53fb8a35", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
