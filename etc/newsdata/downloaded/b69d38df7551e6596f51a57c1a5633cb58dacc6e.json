It's about being against pollution,' Cannes Mayor David Lisnard told Reuters Television in an interview.\n\nUnder the European Union's clean air policy, the cap is already enforced in Baltic, North Sea and Channel ports and it may be extended to the Mediterranean.\n\nCruise ships run on fuel oil which contains about 2,000 times more sulphur oxide than ordinary diesel, according to German pollution analyst Axel Friedrich.\n\n'We will no longer accept cruise ship passengers coming from polluting cruise ships,' Lisnard added.\n\nThe ban could stop some passengers from disembarking in the city, famous for its film festival\n\nThe exponential growth of the cruise ship industry is often criticised by residents of tourist towns but it is also increasingly considered a threat to the environment.\n\nThree months ago, Italy's main conservation group said Venice should be put on the United Nations' list of endangered cities and cruise ships should be banned from its fragile lagoon to prevent an ecological disaster.\n\nAccording to figures from the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), the industry's main trade association, 30 million passengers are expected to cruise on almost 300 ships this year, up from 17.8 million 10 years ago.\n\nIn July, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, which represents 40 per cent of Cannes' maritime traffic, signed a Cruise Charter agreement with the city of Cannes, promising to make its ships more environmentally friendly.", "description": "The ban will stop ships that do not respect a 0.1 per cent cap on sulphur in their fuel from entering France's fourth-biggest cruise port from next year.", "authors": ["Jennifer Newton For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/24/13/18866494-0-image-a-70_1569327401857.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
