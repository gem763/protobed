Mitt Romney of Utah listed several reasons for impeaching Trump, including racist rhetoric, extramarital affairs, and abandonment of the US' Kurdish allies in Syria.\n\nThe president's tweet on Tuesday came as Bill Taylor, the US's top diplomat in Ukraine, prepares to testify before the three congressional committees conducting the impeachment inquiry.\n\nTaylor has firsthand knowledge about efforts by two other diplomats \u2014 Gordon Sondland and Kurt Volker \u2014 to help Trump and his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, push the Ukrainian government to launch politically motivated investigations that would benefit Trump in exchange for US military aid.\n\nA career foreign-service officer, Taylor raised concerns multiple times in text messages with Volker and Sondland, at one point writing that it was \"crazy\" for the US to withhold security assistance to Ukraine in exchange for information that would personally benefit Trump's 2020 campaign.\n\nRead more: 3 big reasons why Rudy Giuliani is the weakest link in Trump's inner circle as the Ukraine scandal widens\n\nThe impeachment inquiry is now a month old\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi of Calif., reads a statement announcing a formal impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, Sept. 24, 2019.
