REUTERS/Tyrone Siu\n\nThe court\u2019s walls were scrawled with graffiti reading: \u201cHistory will absolve us\u201d, \u201cIf we burn you burn with us\u201d and \u201cNo turn back 4HK\u201d.\n\nThe Chinese-ruled financial hub is struggling to recover from a weekend of violent clashes between police and tens of thousands of protesters, with parts virtually cut off due to a paralysed metro that was a target of vandalism amid four months of often violent unrest.\n\nScores of shops were boarded up after also being trashed or torched, and more protests are expected in coming days. Some streets were littered with broken glass and twisted metal debris.\n\nOn Wednesday night, some 200 protesters staged a shopping mall demonstration in the New Territories district of Ma On Shan. The peaceful rally saw protesters sitting or standing and chanting \u201cStand with Hong Kong, fight for freedom\u201d.\n\nThe protests began in opposition to a now withdrawn extradition bill that would have allowed suspects to be sent to China, but have broadened into a pro-democracy movement amid fear that Beijing is undermining Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms.\n\nBritain returned Hong Kong to China in 1997 under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula, which gives it wide-ranging autonomy and freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland.\n\nThe unrest is the worst political crisis 1997 and the biggest challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came into power in 2012.\n\nEdward Leung, 27, one of the leaders of a movement advocating independence from China, and two other activists in 2016 received the harshest sentences handed down to pro-democracy leaders since 1997.\n\nIn his appeal, Leung\u2019s lawyer argued his sentence was disproportionate to his offence, citing other more violent protesters receiving lighter sentences. His case was adjourned on Wednesday ahead of judgment.\n\nOutside the court, hundreds of protesters wore black masks in defiance of colonial-era emergency laws banning face coverings, which were brought in on Friday to quell the unrest but which have incited more violence.\n\nHong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Tuesday did not rule out asking China, which has troops in barracks in Hong Kong, for help to end the unrest, with Hong Kong\u2019s economy hit hard and facing its first recession in a decade.\n\nSHOPPING MALL PROTEST\n\nMany malls closed early to prevent protesters gaining entry.\n\nInside the mall in Ma On Shan seven protesters, one in a wheelchair, held up signs reading: \u201cSupport security guards who are dedicated to their job, strongly condemn police abusing power and arresting people randomly.\u201d\n\nA night earlier, security guards in the same mall tried to stop police entering to chase a protester. Media said the guards were arrested.\n\nA slew of international events and conferences due to be held in the city have been cancelled, with the organisers of the Hong Kong Squash Open the latest, stating they were postponing the event \u201cin view of the current situation\u201d.\n\nMore than 200 shops and public utilities had been damaged in the weekend\u2019s violent clashes. More than 100 restaurants have closed in the past month, putting around 2,000 people out of work, a representative from an association of catering professionals told public broadcaster RTHK.\n\nAuthorities have described protesters as \u201cmilitant activists\u201d, but many Hong Kong residents are also angry at the emergency powers, fearing their civil rights could be eroded.\n\nMore than 2,300 people have been arrested since June, while two teenagers have been shot and wounded in skirmishes with police. Scores of people, including police, have been injured.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s unrest has started to affect global companies and sport, with luxury jeweller Tiffany & Co and U.S. sports brand Vans withdrawing an advertisement and shoe design seen as favouring protesters.\n\nChina has cancelled broadcasting NBA basketball games after an executive of the U.S. National Basketball Association team the Houston Rockets backed protesters in a tweet. Chinese sponsors and partners have cut ties with the NBA.\n\nThe NBA\u2019s business in China is worth more than $4 billion, according to Forbes.\n\n\u201cEvery American has the right to voice their support for democracy and human rights for Hong Kong. Full stop,\u201d said one-time U.S. presidential candidate and former First Lady Hillary Clinton on her official Twitter account on Wednesday.\n\nIn a separate case, a top online gamer from Hong Kong who showed support for the protests was removed from an international tournament he won, forcing him to forgo prize money that media reports put at $10,000.\n\nBlizzard Entertainment, via their brand Hearthstone, said the gamer, identified as \u201cBlitzchung\u201d, had violated rules and would not be allowed to play in any Hearthstone e-sports games for the next 12 months.\n\nSlideshow (11 Images)\n\nChina has warned foreign governments to stay out of the protests which they deem as an \u201cinternal affair\u201d and have accused some, including Britain and the United States, of fanning anti-China sentiment.\n\nPakistan on Wednesday reaffirmed its commitment to Hong\u2019s Kong\u2019s \u201cone country, two systems\u201d, said China\u2019s foreign ministry, after Pakistan Prime Minster Imran Khan met Premier Li Keqiang in Beijing.\n\n\u201cThe Pakistan side reiterated that affairs of Hong Kong were China\u2019s internal matter and all countries should uphold international law and basic norms of non-interference in internal affairs of other countries,\u201d the ministry said in a statement.", "description": "Hundreds of black clad pro-democracy demonstrators chanted \"Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times\" outside the High Court on Wednesday as a leading activist appeared to appeal a six-year jail sentence for rioting in 2016.", "authors": ["Jessie Pang", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438863397&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF980P1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
