I want them to make live music and sequence music and bring it all together.'\n\nHe says he hopes kids in the lab are 'able to make their music as well' such as 'Aretha Franklin and Otis Redding, but I also want them to be able to sample them and turn it into something else.'\n\nPowerhouse: Lizzo belts out a powerful tune while in Seattle back in July as she performs at the Capitol Hill Block Party\n\nAs for the Truth Hurts singer, she released her hit song back in 2017 left her thinking that her career was over.\n\n'The day I released Truth Hurts was probably one of the darkest days I've had ever in my career. I remember thinking, 'If I quit music now, nobody would notice. This is my best song ever, and nobody cares.' I was like, 'F**k it, I'm done.' And a lot of people rallied; my producer, my publicist and my family, they were like, 'Just keep going because this is the darkest before the dawn,' she said during an interview with People.\n\nAnd now two years later, that song has skyrocketed her career she says turning her 'darkest days' into her 'brightest triumph.'", "description": "Two of Hollywood's biggest names have joined forces to bring new music to fan's ears.
