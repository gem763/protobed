He had a pacemaker by 40.\n\nEven though my diet is decent and my blood pressure is low, genetics are not on my side on this one. Recently I was diagnosed with high cholesterol. It actually wasn\u2019t very high but, as the doctor put it, raising his eyebrows, \u201cwith your family history\u2026.\u201d\n\nRead another story about life, death and parenting by Joseph Wilson: We\u2019re All Going To Die \u2014 Conversations With A 5-Year-Old, 7-Year-Old And A Squirrel Named Eli\n\nThe ellipses at the end of that sentence kept me up at night. So I changed my diet, categorically: No more red meat or cold-cuts. Rarely: fries, chicken. Often: fish, beans, avocado, nuts. And it worked; my \"good\" cholesterol climbed and my \"bad\" cholesterol fell. Still, my family doctor suggested I consider preventative medication.\n\nI demurred, so he referred me to a cardiologist at Toronto Western Hospital.\n\nThe fifth floor of the Toronto Western Hospital was the place where my father recovered from his first heart attack. Also from his second heart attack, his third heart attack, his triple bypass operation and his pacemaker installation. It was not a place of good vibes, and I was there for an aptly-named \"stress test.\"\n\nSo I changed my diet, categorically: No more red meat or cold-cuts.\n\nAs a child I can remember gauging my father\u2019s level of anxiety by how far he was from his next test at the hospital. The goal is to run on a treadmill for as long as you possibly can as the treadmill keeps getting steeper and faster. It\u2019s like an anxiety dream come to life.\n\nThey placed electrodes all over my chest and wired me up, tape and saran wrap holding it all together. I could see a thin line tracing out the form of my heartbeat on the monitor. Then the treadmill began. It was like trying to run in a cyborg costume.\n\nWhen I got home, I told my kids where I had been.\n\n\u201cI was at the hospital today,\u201d I said, as casually as I could.\n\n\u201cAre you sick?\u201d asked Sonia (she\u2019s eight).\n\n\u201cNo. It\u2019s more to check to see if my heart is strong.\u201d\n\n\u201cBa-boom, ba-boom,\u201d said Maria (3).\n\n\u201cIs it?\u201d asked Sonia.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have the results yet. But probably. I\u2019m in good shape. But grandad wasn\u2019t. His heart was weak because he smoked and ate bad food.\u201d\n\n\u201cYuck,\u201d said Elizabeth (6).\n\n\u201cYeah, yuck. But we eat well. I\u2019m trying to change my diet. That\u2019s why we eat a lot of fish.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate fish,\u201d said Sonia.\n\nNone of my girls ever met their grandad. He died when our first born was four days old.\n\n\u201cOK, but it might keep me alive longer. What else should I do?\u201d\n\n\u201cExercise!\u201d said Sonia.\n\n\u201cSure. That\u2019s one of the reasons we don\u2019t have a car, so we have to walk and bike more.\u201d\n\nElizabeth sighed. \u201cI love the car,\u201d she said.\n\nNone of my girls ever met their grandad. He died when our first born was four days old. The fact that mortality is so far removed from their minds at this age is such a gift. I want them to retain that innocence for as long as possible. I changed the subject.\n\n\u201cWant to see the parts of my chest they shaved for the test?\u201d I said lifting my shirt.\n\nThe response was unanimous: \u201cEwww!\u201d\n\nWant to start the conversation of death with books? Here's some reading material: 9 Books To Help Kids Understand Death\n\nDinner-time conversations are one of the things I remember most fondly from my own childhood, and now I\u2019m doing the same with my family.\n\nWe make each other laugh, or gross each other out, and it\u2019s something I hope to keep doing with my own grandkids one day.\n\nWhich is why, whether my kids like it or not, we have these conversations, more often than not, over a plate of fish.", "description": "When there is a history of heart attacks in your family, eventually you can't ignore that it could happen to you.
