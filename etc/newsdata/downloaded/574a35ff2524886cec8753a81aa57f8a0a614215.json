Former chancellor Philip Hammond later demanded an apology from Johnson, when it emerged the date on the document was August, after the PM took power.\n\nThe document, which says it outlines \u201creasonable worst case planning assumptions\u201d for no deal Brexit, highlights the risk of border delays, given an estimate that up to 85% of lorries crossing the Channel might not be ready for a new French customs regime.\n\n\u201cThe lack of trader readiness combined with limited space in French ports to hold \u2018unready\u2019 HGVs could reduce the flow rate to 40%-60% of current levels within one day as unready HGVs will fill the ports and block flow,\u201d it warns.\n\nThis situation could last for up to three months, and disruption might last \u201csignificantly longer\u201d, it adds, with lorries facing waits of between 1.5 days and 2.5 days to cross the border.\n\nThe reliance of medical supplies on cross-Channel routes \u201cmake them particularly vulnerable to severe extended delays\u201d, the report says, with some medicines having such short shelf lives they cannot be stockpiled. A lack of veterinary medicines could increase the risk of disease outbreaks, it adds.\n\nOn food supplies, supplies of \u201ccertain types of fresh food\u201d would be reduced, the document warns, as well as other items such as packaging.\n\nIt says: \u201cIn combination, these two factors will not cause an overall shortage of food in the UK but will reduce availability and choice of products and will increase price, which could impact vulnerable groups.\u201d\n\nLater, it adds: \u201cLow income groups will be disproportionately affected by any price rises in food and fuel.\u201d\n\nOn law and order it warns: \u201cProtests and counter-protests will take place across the UK and may absorb significant amounts of police resource. There may also be a rise in public disorder and community tensions.\u201d\n\nThe documents also outline a potential impact on cross-border financial services and law enforcement information sharing.\n\nIt says Gibraltar could face significant delays on its border with Spain, with four-hour waits likely \u201cfor at least a few months\u201d.\n\nThe document also concedes that there will be a return to some sort of hard Irish border despite a UK insistence it will not impose checks: \u201cThis model is likely to prove unsustainable due to significant economic, legal and biosecurity risks and no effective unilateral mitigations to address this will be available.\u201d\n\nThe expectation, it adds, is that some businesses will move to avoid tariffs, and others will face higher costs.\n\nThe government claimed on Wednesday night that the leaked document was \u201cnever a base or central case\u201d.\n\n\u201cSome iterations of the Yellowhammer assumptions have used the phrase \u2018base scenario\u2019 to describe some baseline parameters \u2013 such as the UK will leave on a particular date and trade on WTO terms \u2013 upon which the worst case assumptions are then built. This has never meant that Yellowhammer is a base or central scenario and to suggest otherwise is a gross misrepresentation,\u201d said a government source.\n\nThe government refused to comply with the second part of MPs\u2019 request, which demanded the release of messages relating to the suspension of parliament sent by Johnson\u2019s senior adviser, Dominic Cummings and various other aides on WhatsApp, Facebook, other social media and both their personal and professional phones.\n\nIn a letter to Grieve, Michael Gove, the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, said the request was \u201cinappropriate in principle and in practice, would on its own terms purport to require the government to contravene the law, and is singularly unfair to the named individuals\u201d.\n\nGrieve told MPs on Monday he had information from public officials that the correspondence contained a \u201cscandal\u201d.\n\nThe House of Commons voted, by 311 to 302, for the government to publish the information, giving the prime minister a deadline of 11pm on Wednesday to comply.\n\nFollowing publication of the document, Grieve said: \u201cAs a One Nation Conservative I am deeply fearful of the long-term damage a reckless approach \u2013 which knowingly risks prosperity, increases poverty and even threatens medical supplies \u2013 will do to both the people and our party. This must be stopped.\u201d\n\nGove has been given the task of ramping up no-deal preparations across government. The chancellor, Sajid Javid, set aside an extra \u00a32bn at last week\u2019s spending review for the task, taking the total now allocated to no-deal planning to \u00a38bn.\n\nJohnson has lost every vote in parliament since he became prime minister in July, including on his two attempts to trigger a snap general election for next month.\n\nThe prime minister sparked a fierce backlash inside the Tory party last week by removing the whip from 21 rebels who supported backbench-led legislation to force him to request a Brexit delay if he fails to pass a new deal through parliament by mid-October.\n\nMerkel warns of danger to EU of Singapore-style UK on its border Read more\n\nThose expelled include former justice secretary David Gauke, Hammond, and Winston Churchill\u2019s grandson, Nicholas Soames.\n\nChief whip Mark Spencer has now written to some of them, confirming that they are entitled to appeal the decision \u2013 and hinting that future loyalty to the government could boost their cause.\n\nOne of the 21 MPs said: \u201cIt was one of the most self-unaware letters I\u2019ve received in some time. From people who are serially disloyal and decimated their own minority government. I don\u2019t want it back ...\n\n\u201cAll it did in my local community was confirm that the Conservative party is now led by a narrow sect who wouldn\u2019t be out of place in the Muppet version of the Handmaiden\u2019s tale. It\u2019s like being asked by its captain if you want to get back on the Titanic.\u201d\n\nSenior Conservatives expect the whips to be less accommodating to those MPs who have been fiercely critical of the government\u2019s stance.\n\nSam Gyimah has received a letter but is not intending to seek to have the whip restored, the Guardian understands; while Hammond is hoping to challenge the original suspension in a bid to have it overturned.", "description": "Operation Yellowhammer documents predict public disorder, rising prices and disruptions to food and medicines", "authors": ["Heather Stewart", "Peter Walker"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a795829972b050a02d302b118aaa1b2e18257630/0_76_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=518ec25183d210c8a34e16f930afa202", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
