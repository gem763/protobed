This created a perfect storm for hot material to ignite the dry brush below and cause massive wildfires throughout the region.\n\nMore than 40 people died, and thousands lost their homes. PG&E announced in January that it would be filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy due to financial liabilities in the dozens of billions.\n\nThe following counties could be affected by the planned power outages:\n\nAlameda, Alpine, Amador, Butte, Calaveras, Colusa, Contra Costa, El Dorado, Glenn, Lake, Mariposa, Mendocino, Napa, Nevada, Placer, Plumas, San Joaquin, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, Shasta, Sierra, Solano, Sonoma, Stanislaus, Tehama, Tuolumne, Yolo and Yuba.\n\nThe state has also dedicated much of its funding to combat wildfires in the region.
