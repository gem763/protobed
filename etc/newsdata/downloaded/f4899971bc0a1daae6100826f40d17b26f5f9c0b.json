It processes seven million barrels of Saudi oil a day, drawing crude from the kingdom\u2019s massive oil fields and separating it from gas into specific grades. Those, such as Arabian Extra Light, are then exported around the globe.\n\nU.S. officials have accused Iran of orchestrating an attack on the Abqaiq facility and another at the Khurais oil field, one of the kingdom\u2019s largest. The assaults have suspended production of 5.7 million barrels of Saudi oil a day, more than half of the country\u2019s output, and raised tensions in the Middle East.\n\nIran\u2019s Foreign Ministry on Sunday denied any involvement. Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels, who the U.S. says are supported by Iran, have taken responsibility.\n\nAttacks have plagued the Abqaiq facility before. In 2006, al Qaeda mounted a failed assault on the site using suicide bombers and sent oil prices at the time more than $2 a barrel higher.\n\nBut Saturday\u2019s attack was more damaging, causing at least six separate blazes at the facility, some which grew to more than 30 feet tall, according to witnesses.\n\nGalahad, a Filipino worker at a pizza store, said he and his six housemates got in a car at about 5 a.m. and raced to safety in the desert, concerned about how many buildings would catch fire in the town. \u201cWe were very scared,\u201d he said.\n\nMore than 70% of Saudi Arabia\u2019s daily oil production runs through Abqaiq before it gets sent into a network of pipelines heading for Saudi ports.\n\nThen it is shipped off to China, India, the U.S. and other markets.\n\n\u201cIf you want to attack one location that has the highest percentage of oil going into the global market, that would be it,\u201d said Ellen Wald, the president of Transversal Consulting and author of \u201cSaudi Inc.,\u201d a corporate history of the kingdom.\n\nAbqaiq itself is a sparsely populated desert community with little to offer beyond a giant oil facility, visibly divided between the facilities of Aramco, the Saudi oil company, and the rest of town.\n\nIt lies north of the Empty Quarter, a 250,000-square-mile expanse that is one of the longest continuous deserts in the world.\n\nA few thousand Aramco employees are housed in a residential compound, which has tennis courts, a swimming pool and golf course.\n\nOutside the compound, Saudis and foreign workers from South Asia and the Philippines live in dilapidated houses surrounded by gates and high walls, a common Saudi style.\n\nResidents who spoke to The Wall Street Journal in Abqaiq conceded that it was difficult to ascertain what happened early Sunday, but two people said they had viewed a drone in the sky above the burning plant and one said he had heard gunfire targeted at the unmanned vehicle.\n\nIn one video that an Abqaiq resident showed The Wall Street Journal, flames dozens of feet high can be seen blazing at the facility as the sounds of the fajr, the predawn Islamic call to prayer, are heard in the background.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know whether it was an attack or an accident,\u201d said one Egyptian worker who was woken by booming sound and went outside to film the scene. He saw six to eight separate fires raging at the Abqaiq site, less than a mile from his residence.\n\nThe manager of a burger chain near the Aramco compound said he was cleaning and closing up for the night when an explosion rang out so loud, and seemingly close, that he thought a burglar was attempting to break into the store.\n\nHe said his wife then called and screamed: \u201cCome back, come back!\u201d He dashed home to drive his family out of the city.\n\nWrite to Rory Jones at rory.jones@wsj.com", "description": "The sprawling crude hub of Abqaiq turned into an inferno that illuminated the desert sky and sent residents of the small town fleeing for the safety of the sands.", "authors": ["Rory Jones", "Rory.Jones Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107288/social", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
