REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon\n\nAt a cost so far of $220 million (\u00a3171.07 million), Japan\u2019s \u201cSymbolic Space for Ethnic Harmony\u201d is on track to open in time for the 2020 Olympics, part of a drive by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to draw millions of foreign visitors to Japan and to the northern city of Sapporo, where the Olympic marathon will be run.\n\n(Click reut.rs/2NejDTG to see a picture package.)\n\nAlso known as \u201cUpopoy\u201d or \u201csinging together\u201d in the Ainu language, the complex will include a museum, a replica of an Ainu village, many of which Japan destroyed in its 19th Century colonization of Hokkaido, and a memorial housing the bones of hundreds of Ainu whose remains were sent to universities in the 20th Century.\n\nFor some surviving Ainu, whose exact numbers are unknown, the project underscores how Japan has failed to come to terms with its history - despite more than a decade of deliberation on how Tokyo could meet its commitments to an indigenous group it officially recognised in 2008.\n\nSome Ainu worry the new museum complex is mostly meant to burnish Japan\u2019s international standing ahead of the Olympics.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s possible it could end up becoming a theme park,\u201d said Ainu tattoo artist Mai Hachiya. \u201cPeople would come to see the dancing and other performances. It would be like a zoo.\u201d\n\n\u2018SILENT AINU\u2019\n\nScholars say the Ainu settled in Japan\u2019s northernmost island and across Sakhalin, Russia, by the 1300s. They hunted, fished, practiced an animist religion and spoke a language unrelated to any other.\n\nJapan took control of Hokkaido by force in the 19th Century and made it a colony. After opening it to Japanese settlers, it forced the Ainu, which it labelled \u201cformer aborigines,\u201d to assimilate.\n\nA 2017 survey counted just over 13,000 Ainu in Hokkaido. The actual number is estimated to be much higher, because many Ainu fear identifying as other than Japanese and have moved to different parts of the country.\n\nAinu children are half as likely to go to college as other Japanese and average household earnings are significantly lower, official data show.\n\n\u201cSociety was not accepting of the Ainu, and it still isn\u2019t,\u201d said Mai Ishihara, an anthropologist at Hokkaido University. \u201cThere are still many people who keep their Ainu identity secret from their children.\u201d\n\nIshihara discovered at age 12 that her maternal grandmother was Ainu. She describes people detached from their roots as \u201csilent Ainu.\u201d\n\nIn 2009, after signing the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, Japan\u2019s government began considering how to establish a new policy for the Ainu. Early proposals zeroed in quickly on the creation of the government-funded \u201cSymbolic Space\u201d now taking shape on the shore of Lake Poroto near the town of Shiraoi in Hokkaido.\n\nIn consultations that concluded in early 2018, Ainu representatives asked for legal rights to state-owned land, more funding for teaching Ainu culture and language and an apology from Japan\u2019s government.\n\nNone of those proposals was considered.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t do something if it is not achievable,\u201d said Hiroshi Koyama, the official in charge of Japan\u2019s Comprehensive Ainu Policy Office.\n\nGiving back forest where Ainu once hunted and foraged, he said, would \u201cbe hard for the Japanese people to accept.\u201d And he added that an apology would be uncomfortable for many Japanese, as well as an insult to the Japanese settlers who built modern Hokkaido.\n\n\u201cIt would focus people\u2019s attention on the bad things that happened and not the future,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018THE VERGE OF EXTINCTION\u2019\n\nAinu hunter Atsushi Monbetsu, 36, sees Tokyo\u2019s actions, including the ethnic-harmony park, as \u201cuseless.\u201d Discrimination as a child made him decide to embrace his heritage and live as a hunter, he said.\n\n\u201cIt would have been nice if the government had given us a place where we could carry out our traditional rites,\u201d said Monbetsu, who burns birch shavings in a prayer to the Ainu gods before stalking deer with a shotgun.\n\nA group representing about 2,000 Ainu supports Abe\u2019s project, arguing it will provide economic benefits from tourism and a forum focusing on Ainu culture and arts. Five of the 20 curators hired for the new museum are Ainu.\n\nAt a former school a short drive from the museum construction site, curators are preparing exhibits. Traditional Ainu coats hang in abandoned classrooms with knives, ceremonial sticks and heavy beaded necklaces laid out on tables. In the gymnasium, dancers practice next to stuffed bears and Ainu handicrafts.\n\nSlideshow (29 Images)\n\nWith pictures of smiling performers, a draft brochure describes Ainu hunter-gatherer culture as \u201con the verge of extinction.\u201d It makes no reference to Japanese policies that forced Ainu to adopt Japanese names, speak Japanese and outlawed practices such as a traditional form of tattooing Hachiya is trying to revive.\n\nHachiya, 36, who is also a singer, has been asked to practice a routine with other Ainu performers that may be included in the Olympics opening ceremony in Tokyo.\n\n\u201cI think Hokkaido is a Japanese colony,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s a hard thing to say, but if you look back on what was done, that\u2019s what you have to conclude.\u201d", "description": "On a wooded lake shore in northern Japan, the government is building a modernist shrine that has divided the indigenous Ainu community whose vanishing culture it was designed to celebrate.", "authors": ["Tim Kelly", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446023597&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R1OS", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
