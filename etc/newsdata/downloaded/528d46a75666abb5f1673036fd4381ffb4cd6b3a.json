Meanwhile, futures for the S&P 500 index were up 3.75 points, or 0.1%, at 3,005.75, while the Nasdaq-100 were gaining 23.75 points, or 0.3%, at 7,913.50.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Dow rose 227.61 points, or 0.9%, to 27,137.04, closing above 27,000 for the first time since July. The S&P 500 index advanced 21.54 points, or 0.7%, to 3,000.93. The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 85.52 points, or 1.1%, to 8,169.67.\n\nWednesday's action left the Dow and S&P just 0.8% from their record closes, while the Nasdaq remains 1.9% from its all-time closing high.\n\nWhat's driving the market?\n\nTrump said tariff hikes--from 25% to 30%--that were scheduled to take effect Oct. 1 will now go into effect Oct. 15. The president attributed the \"gesture of goodwill\", as he described it via Twitter (link), to the People's Republic's 70th anniversary commencing on Oct. 1. and came at the request of China's chief trade negotiator Vice Premier Liu He.\n\nThe moves comes as American and Chinese representatives are slated to meet in early October to restart stalled trade negotiations and avert any further escalation of animosities between the economic superpowers.\n\nHowever, no date has been set to begin the high-level discussions, but the latest olive branch does help to reflect a momentary softening of tensions between Beijing and Washington, which had rattled global economies, because an outright trade war could further weaken an already slowing global economy.\n\nBeyond trade, markets are focused on ECB President Mario Draghi, who will preside over his penultimate policy meeting as head of Europe's rate-setting organization. Most economists and market participants anticipate that the ECB could further reduce rates, deepening the eurozone's slide into rates that offer yields of less than 0%. The ECB may also deliver a new asset-buying program, and could also attempt to mitigate its easy-money moves to the broader financial community. In particular, the ECB could introduce a so-called tiered system of deposits, which would see only a portion of deposits subject to negative rates.\n\nThe ECB will announce its decision at 7:45 a.m. Eastern Time, followed by a news conference with Draghi at 8:30 a.m. Economists at Goldman Sachs said most of the measures will be revealed in the announcement, rather than the Draghi press conference.\n\nRead: The ECB's challenge: Pushing rates further into negative territory without wrecking eurozone banks (link)\n\nCheck out:The ECB decision is coming--here's what to expect (link)\n\nWhich stocks are in focus?\n\nShares of Oracle Corp. (ORCL) are in focus after the technology company late Wednesday (link) said co-CEO Mark Hurd was taking a leave of absence for health reasons. Co-CEO Safra Catz and Chairman Larry Ellison will cover Hurd's duties, the company said. Oracle shares were down 1.9% in premarket trade Thursday.\n\nHow are other markets trading?\n\nThe yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell 1 basis point to 1.72% Thursday. Bond prices move inversely to yields.\n\nIn commodity markets, the price of crude oil was off 1% at $55.19 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after falling more than 2% on Wednesday amid reports that Trump discussed easing of sanctions on Iran (link) in a move to secure a meeting with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani later this month.\n\nGold prices headed 0.5% higher to $1,510 an ounce. The U.S. dollar , meanwhile, edged 0.1% lower to 98.55, as measured by the ICE U.S. Dollar Index, a gauge of the buck against a basket of six currencies.\n\nIn Asia overnight Thursday, the China CSI 300 l gained 1.1%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index shed 0.3% and Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 0.8%. European shares edged lower Thursday ahead of the ECB move, with the Stoxx Europe 600 off 0.1%.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 12, 2019 07:11 ET (11:11 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
