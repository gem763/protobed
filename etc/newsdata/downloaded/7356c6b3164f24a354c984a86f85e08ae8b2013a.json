She's only thinking of herself,\" Bruce told \"Hannity\" guest host Jason Chaffetz. \"This is, I think, a very good example -- when we talk about whether it was the memorial or her own comments about Tulsi Gabbard or the nature of others' remarks -- that she's making this remaining obsession.

And it is really this pathological refusal to accept that now the American people have accepted it,\" Bruce said. \"We are going to have another election, which is where we're going to be able to make our choices. But whether it's the impeachment or Hillary's behavior, you're seeing a level of confusion and collapse throughout the system.\"\n\nFox News' Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.", "description": "Fox News contributor Tammy Bruce slammed former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton after her comments made during Friday's funeral for House Oversight Committee Chairman\u00a0Elijah Cummings, a Maryland Democrat who died Oct. 17 at age 68.", "authors": ["Victor Garcia"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/hilary-clinton.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
