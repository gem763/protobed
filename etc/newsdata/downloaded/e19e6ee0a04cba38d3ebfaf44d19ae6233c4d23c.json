Difo delivered a single. A crowd rose and cheered. The single stood as the game-winning hit in a 5-2 win over the Philadelphia Phillies and, because of it, Washington still has the edge for home-field advantage in the National League wild-card game.\n\nThat really happened at Nationals Park on Wednesday. There is a box score and video to prove it. The Nationals still have something to play for in the twilight of this regular season, one that culminated in a postseason clinch Tuesday. They are locked into a spot in that wild-card game, so there\u2019s no more uncertainty there, but there\u2019s a chance they would have to travel for that game instead of host it. The Milwaukee Brewers remain just a game behind them. The St. Louis Cardinals, just 1 \u00bd games ahead of the Brewers in the NL Central, are also in the mix.\n\nBut Washington kept its slim advantage with a fourth straight victory over the Phillies. Difo\u2019s RBI single nudged it across the finish line. The shortstop, filling in for a resting Trea Turner, spent most of his season in the minors and hadn\u2019t started in the majors since May 16. The go-ahead rally in the seventh was set up by seven strong innings from An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez. He gave up two runs and struck out seven. The Nationals tacked on two insurance runs in the eighth. Sean Doolittle finished it with his first save since Aug. 16.\n\nIt all helped them take a game they could have easily slept through.\n\n\u201cWe talk about that all year long, about utilizing every guy you have on the roster,\u201d Manager Dave Martinez said of Difo. \u201cThat\u2019s a perfect example of him just being ready to play when he\u2019s called upon.\u201d\n\n[Svrluga: Playoff-clinching win was the perfect bookend to the Bryce Harper chapter in Washington]\n\nThe Nationals\u2019 clubhouse still smelled like alcohol while players trickled in for another day of work. The party lasted there until near midnight Tuesday, leaving no one dry, before it moved to a bar on the Southeast Waterfront. Martinez was already handing out days off before his players left \u2014 \u201cThere was no fight, I can tell you that,\u201d he joked \u2014 and that was reflected in a makeshift lineup.\n\nAnthony Rendon sat after starting 123 straight games since coming off the injured list May 7. Turner sat after starting 114 straight games since coming off the IL on May 17. Brian Dozier went viral during the clinching celebration, dancing shirtless to \u201cCalma,\u201d singing every word while he was drenched in beer. Now he was playing second and batting leadoff. Difo was holding two champagne bottles at once, his eyes covered by goggles, his hair dripping with some mix of something or other. Now he was at shortstop and hitting eighth.\n\nAnd S\u00e1nchez, 35 years young, led a conga line while blowing a whistle while making it fair to wonder what other props were on the horizon. Now Washington needed him to start and ease some strain from a tired bullpen. The balance for Martinez is to rest regulars while aiming for home-field advantage. If the Nationals and Brewers finish with the same record, a very real possibility, the game would be played in Milwaukee because the Brewers won the season series. Same goes if the Cardinals and Nationals wind up in a tie.\n\n\u201cThat game\u2019s such a coin flip,\u201d Doolittle said Tuesday afternoon. \u201cObviously we would want it at home because I think logistically it would be a heck of a lot easier. We finish the season at home, we have a day off, and then we play that game rather than trying to fly somewhere.\u201d\n\nBut the importance of home field depends on whom you ask.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really care because I think we\u2019ve lost three Game 5s here,\u201d said Turner, referring to postseason exits in 2012, 2016 and 2017. \u201cNot to say it\u2019s anybody\u2019s fault or . . . whatever you want to say. But I think, in my opinion, you have to beat somebody on the road in the postseason to accomplish your goal.\u201d\n\nS\u00e1nchez did his part early, retiring nine of the first 10 batters he faced, reaching for six different pitches to do so. But the Nationals\u2019 offense looked like it didn\u2019t get much sleep. Phillies starter Drew Smyly carried a 6.44 ERA into the game. He didn\u2019t allow a run or hit until the fourth, but then both came at once on Howie Kendrick\u2019s solo homer with two outs.\n\nSmyly finished with 10 strikeouts, his most since August 2016, and S\u00e1nchez was matching him until the seventh. Brad Miller got all of a S\u00e1nchez curveball for his third homer in the past two days, and that left the Nationals down a run.\n\nBut Washington went ahead once Smyly was lifted. He was chased out by Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera\u2019s one-out single in the seventh. Yan Gomes followed with a double off reliever Mike Morin, continuing a hot streak, and a run soon came in on Victor Robles\u2019s sacrifice fly. Then Difo punched that single to put the Nationals ahead for good \u2014 just like they drew it up.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been telling these guys, NLCS last year, I was with the Dodgers facing the Brewers and that\u2019s the most electric stadium I\u2019ve ever been a part of in my whole career,\u201d said Dozier, who homered in the eighth, then ended the night by lending a little more weight to Washington\u2019s win.", "description": "Fourth straight win over Phillies keeps Washington one game ahead of surging Milwaukee in bid to host wild-card game.", "authors": ["Jesse Dougherty", "Reporter Covering The Washington Nationals.", "September At Pm", "Jesse Dougherty Covers The Washington Nationals."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ceNs67VnrcXMA_gBdd1Ds8h_5ok=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IHXYKJXAAII6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
