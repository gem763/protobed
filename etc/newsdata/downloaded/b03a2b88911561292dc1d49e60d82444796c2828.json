Her witty, ethereal projects often involve her own experiences with family and lovers, and tease relatable truths from the most subtle interactions: a girl learning about sex while playing with dolls; a young woman\u2019s online relationship explored through the folders on her PC desktop. As a \u201cplayer\u201d, your role is often negligible, flitting between embodiment, friendship and voyeurism.\n\nWe Met in May is a set of four vignette games about the early moments in a romantic relationship, ostensibly between Nina herself and the game\u2019s programmer, Jake Jefferies. In Nothing to Hide, Nina has invited Jake back to her flat for the first time and, bashful about its untidiness and her collection of anime plushies and posters, considers hiding things from him \u2013 it\u2019s up to the player to decide what she conceals. In Beach Date, Nina and Jake lounge at the seaside and, controlling her arm with the cursor, you can pile sand or suncream on to him, or try to pour wine into his mouth. The inexactness of the control mechanic makes her arm flail awkwardly, like a sort of dating version of Surgeon Simulator.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Back to mine \u2026 Nina takes Jake to her flat.\n\nThe final two feel like they\u2019re set slightly later in the relationship. Strike a Pose sees the couple going to the mall, where Nina tries on a range of outfits. In a funny reference to the magical attacks in role-playing games, each item of clothing empowers her with different abilities with which she quite literally stuns her waiting boyfriend when she emerges from the cubicle. Finally, Dinner\u2019s Ready has Jake fixing Nina dinner, while she idly fantasises about tweaking his nipples, an action the player takes over via a first-person-shooter-style aiming cursor.\n\nAlong the way, there are snippets of cute interactive dialogue and we often see Nina\u2019s thought bubbles as she combats her insecurities and uncertainties. There is a lovely, pastel-shaded comic book wash to the visuals, an aesthetic that reminded me of 1970s girls\u2019 comics such as Jinty and Bunty. The soundtrack by Ryan Yoshikami has a relaxing, muzak vibe to it that underlines the playfulness and ephemeral nature of early romance, when everything feels silly and lightweight but also loaded with significance.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Power dressing \u2026 We Met in May.\n\nWe Met in May is done in an hour, but like Freeman\u2019s other explorations of self-conscious longing and ardour, it lingers in the mind. The brief vignettes tap into memories we all share \u2013 of first dates and fumbled physical contact, of building shared jokes and memories, of just really fancying someone but not quite having the lexical or physical vocabulary to express it.\n\nThat is the beauty of We Met in May. While playing Beach Date, I was trying to pour wine on Jake\u2019s shorts but ended up accidentally dropping the bottle, and the action became an affectionate stroke of his chest. It was a moment of unintended but electric intimacy that made the small asking price of this experimental project more than worth it.", "description": "Experimental game designer Nina Freeman returns with a set of funny, thoughtful vignettes about the awkwardness of new relationships", "authors": ["Keith Stuart"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f8deb1b53416557b02ab9dde9716add0bf910f3/62_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=ebef06d4aeafb0f23d6fe0107a659042"}
