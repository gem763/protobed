I would say that I\u2019m an enabler of all colleagues across the House who want to express their different points of view.\n\n\u2018I thought the Brexiteers were in favour of taking back control of Parliament being in the driving seat?\n\n\u2018Well, they can\u2019t have it both ways.\u2019\n\nMr Bercow, who has said he will stand down as Speaker on 31 October, called the European Union (Withdrawal) (No.2) Act \u2013 known as the Benn Act \u2013 \u2018the most logical consequence if a deal isn\u2019t agreed\u2019.\n\nBoris Johnson previously labelled it the \u2018surrender bill\u2019.\n\nLater in the interview, he came close to tears as he reflected on murdered MP Jo Cox.\n\nThe Buckingham MP was shown a video clip of him paying tribute to Ms Cox in the Commons following her death in 2016.\n\nHe said: \u2018Any death in such awful circumstances is an outrage and a tragedy.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018Yet this death, in this manner, of this person, our democratically elected colleague Jo Cox is particularly shocking and repugnant.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFighting back tears, Mr Bercow told CNN that he remembered the moment \u2018very keenly\u2019 and \u2018the sentiment is very raw\u2019.\n\nHe said: \u2018Really, Jo was a great exponent of that principle of political difference, personal amiability.\n\n\u2018It should be possible for us as democrats to disagree agreeably.\u2019\n\nMs Cox died on 16 June, 2016, after she was shot and stabbed multiple times by far-right sympathiser Thomas Mair in her constituency of Batley and Spen, West Yorkshire.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
