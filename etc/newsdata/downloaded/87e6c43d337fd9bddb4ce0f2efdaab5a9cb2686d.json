This is a big assumption as talks could easily fail again if both parties don\u2019t find a compromise.\"\n\nAs for the outlook for US rates, expectations are rising ahead of this week Fed policy meeting.\n\n\"We now agree with investors that the FOMC will cut rates by 25bp this week,\" Capital Economics' Jonas Goltermann said in a note. \"However, we also think that it will do so again in December, which is not fully discounted in the markets.\n\n\"In our view, the cut in December will mark the end of the central bank\u2019s easing cycle, whereas investors anticipate 1-2 more 25bp cuts in 2020. The upshot is that while there is no longer a big difference between the levels at which we and investors expect the federal funds rate to end next year, we think that the rate will bottom out sooner than they do.\"\n\nToday's agenda\n\nLocal: Speech by Philip Lowe, Governor \u2013 Some Echoes of Melville \u2013 the Sir Leslie Melville Lecture, Canberra at 5.45pm AEDT\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOverseas data: US S &P CoreLogic CS House Prices August, Pending Home Sales September, CB Consumer Confidence October\n\nMarket highlights\n\nASX futures up 23 points or 0.3% to 6741 near 7.45am AEDT\n\nAUD +0.2% to 68.39 US cents\n\nSterling +0.3% to $US1.2859\n\nOn Wall St: Dow +0.5% S &P 500 +0.6% Nasdaq +1%\n\nIn New York: BHP +1.4% Rio +1.5% Atlassian +4% Microsoft +2.5%\n\nIn Europe: Stoxx 50 flat FTSE +0.1% CAC +0.2% DAX +0.4%\n\nNikkei 225 futures +0.4% Hang Seng futures +0.6%\n\nSpot gold -0.8% to $US1493.19 an ounce at 1.30pm New York time\n\nBrent crude -0.8% to $US61.53 a barrel\n\nUS oil -1.4% to $US55.87 a barrel\n\nIron ore n/a\n\nDalian iron ore -1.7% to 622 yuan\n\nLME aluminium +0.5% to $US1736 a tonne\n\nLME copper -0.3% to $US5908 a tonne\n\n2-year yield: US 1.64% Australia 0.74%\n\n5-year yield: US 1.66% Australia 0.78%\n\n10-year yield: US 1.84% Australia 1.09% Germany -0.33%\n\n10-year US/Australia yield gap near 7am AEDT: 75 basis points\n\nFrom today's Financial Review\n\nFear grows over ASIC\u2019s pay powers: The accountability regime that governs bankers' conduct and pay will soon be expanded and ASIC is muscling in on the new law behind the scenes.\n\nChanticleer: ASIC case puts general advice on life support: ASIC's Federal Court win over Westpac on financial advice has big ramifications for the sector.\n\nTech investors warn against rushing for the exits: Tech founders and venture capitalists have told investors to ignore panic about over-priced growth companies and take a mature approach to assessing high-flying tech stocks and start-ups.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnited States\n\nThe House of Representatives this week will debate legislation establishing procedures for the next phase of the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said.\n\nMicrosoft's shares climbed 2.5%, making the stock among the biggest boosts to each of three major indexes after the technology giant won the Pentagon\u2019s $US10 billion cloud computing contract, beating out Amazon.\n\nThe Nasdaq ended the session less than 5 points below its closing high.

Exports declined 1.6%, pulled down by plunges in shipments of soybeans, as well as automobiles. Goods imports tumbled 2.3% amid decreases in imports of industrial supplies, capital goods, motor vehicles and consumer goods.\n\nThe decline in imports, centred around consumer and capital goods, points to a step down in consumer spending and further contraction in business investment.\n\n\"Until trade issues are resolved in a more permanent and comprehensive way, the trade war will remain a drag on the global economy,\" said Emily Mandel, an economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe odds for a quarter percentage point cut in US borrowing costs have jumped to 94.1% from 49.2% last month, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.\n\n\"One of the reasons they are cutting interest rates is not because they are trying to get ahead of a slowdown but because they are worried about the impact of the trade and tariff issues,\" Pavlik said.\n\nThe third-quarter earnings season has managed to ease some concerns related to the impact of the trade tensions on Corporate America, with over 78% of the 204 S &P 500 companies that have reported so far surpassing profit expectations, according to Refinitiv data.\n\nEarnings for S &P 500 companies are expected to fall 2%, but excluding the energy sector, they are forecast to rise 0.5%.\n\nInvestors are now waiting for earnings from heavyweights this week, including Apple, Alphabet and Merck.\n\nEurope\n\nBoris' election request rejected: But the chances grow that the British PM will get his Christmas wish - a snap December election - after the smaller anti-Brexit parties play Santa.\n\nThe exporter-laden FTSE 100 recovered from early losses on Monday despite a rebound in sterling, boosted by gains in leading drug stocks and as prospects for a US-China trade agreement powered miners and industrials.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe blue chip index closed 0.1% higher, lagging peers on Wall Street and in Europe as a near 4% drop in HSBC after an underwhelming earnings update, and a slide in dollar earners, capped gains.\n\nThe more domestically-focused FTSE 250 outperformed with a 0.5% rise.\n\nAstraZeneca climbed as much 3.6% after saying a combination of its cancer drug, Imfinzi, along with chemotherapy helped curb progression of lung cancer in a late-stage study.

S &P 500 broke decisively to new all-time highs today (10/28) and this is setting stage for bitcoin to move back to risk-on. Our unpopular opinion remains that bitcoin is a risk-on asset at this early stage in its adoption. The reason being that bitcoin is largely retail held and only when institutional ownership broadens, do we expect it to become a consistently counter correlated asset. For now, the best years for bitcoin gains occurred in strong S &P 500 years.\"\n\nCommodities\n\nRio CEO's five lessons from boom time excess: Big mining's next frontier is the digital world, and growing risk aversion means that shareholders should continue to earn an overweight share of the sector's wealth creation, says Jean-Sebastien Jacques.\n\nChina's Dalian iron ore futures eased for the first time in five sessions on Monday after a mining joint venture between Vale and BHP in Brazil won permission to resume operations suspended after a 2015 dam collapse.\n\nDarren Toh, data scientist at Singapore-based steel and iron data analytics company Tivlon Technologies, said he remained bullish on iron ore.\n\nSteel inventory is easing and the pace of infrastructure projects is accelerating, said Toh, adding that increasing property investment was also being seen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nZinc prices climbed towards 4-month peaks on Monday as slumping stocks fuelled fears of shortages, while copper hovered near five-week highs on hopes of progress in trade talks between the United States and China.\n\nBenchmark zinc on the London Metal Exchange was untraded in the closing rings, but was bid up 1.3% to $US2542 a tonne.\n\nPrices of the metal used to galvanise steel earlier touched $US2549, moving back towards last week's peak of $US2567.35, which was the highest since June 14.\n\n\"Visible zinc stocks are minimal, I can't remember the last time they were so low,\" a metal trader said. \"Copper is looking at developments on the U.S-China trade front with optimism.\"\n\nCopper, used by investors as a gauge of economic health, was down 0.3% at $US5908 a tonne, having earlier touched a session high of $US5927.\n\nAustralian sharemarket\n\nGreensill Capital's $6b valuation shows growth hunger: SoftBank's Vision Fund has thrown fuel on the fire of debate around the valuations of technology companies, after the backer of troubled WeWork invested $961 million into Australia's Greensill Capital at a valuation of almost $6 billion.\n\nAustralian shares edged higher at the start of the week, with miners advancing after an easing of global trade tensions and updates from Viva Energy and Beach Energy helping the market to a marginal gain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe S &P/ASX 200 index added 1 point to end the day at 6740.70.
