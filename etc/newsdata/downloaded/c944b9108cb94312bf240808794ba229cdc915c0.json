It\u2019s now in the height of its home decor phase, but under a different moniker: ochre.\n\nWhat the heck IS ochre, anyway?\n\nBy definition, ochre is a natural clay earth pigment derived from ferric oxide, sand and clay that can range in color from yellow to deep orange or brown. The word is pronounced ow \u2022 kr (think about how Cardi B would say, \u201cOkurrr\u201d).\n\nAccording to Etsy\u2019s in-house trend expert Dayna Isom Johnson, there\u2019s been a 36% increase in searches on the site for ochre-colored items in the last three months. During that same time frame, searches on Etsy for \u201cburnt orange\u201d items were up more than 750% \u2014 indicating that folks are trying to get in on the ochre trend without necessarily knowing what ochre is.\n\n\u201cIn January, I coined burnt orange Etsy\u2019s color of the year, and with natural, grounding tones continuing to trend, ochre is the latest hue to take center stage,\u201d Johnson told HuffPost. \u201cThis fall, I predict that shoppers will be combining ochre with other organic yellows and moody oranges to create the ultimate looks for cooler weather.\u201d\n\nThe design experts at Pinterest say searches for ochre are up on their site as well \u2014 by about 65%, and mostly around home decor inspiration.\n\nHow can you try the ochre trend in your own home?\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to scroll through home inspo on Instagram without seeing a blend of woven textures and bohemian styles soaked in classic \u201970s sunset hues and earth tones \u2014 ochre being the most popular.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to spice up your space with a splash of the sunny color, it\u2019s as easy as tossing a set of ochre sheets on your bed or adding an ochre cushion cover over the decorative pillows on your sofa. Brooklinen, for example, added ochre linen bedding to its summer selection (though the shade now appears to be, ahem, sunset), and Anthropologie has an ochre velvet quilt in its bedding selection.\n\nLooking for more ochre home decor inspiration?
