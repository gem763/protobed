Unless you find streets swathed in teargas and the repeated crack of beanbag rounds a means of celebration. These street battles are now widely referred to as \u201cteargas buffets\u201d, though there isn\u2019t much in the way of a selection, as they reduce tourists, residents, journalists and anyone else not wearing an anti-gas respirator to stinging tears.\n\nWalking was the only option; all public transport was closed or cancelled and the deserted roads were littered with charred barricades, black balloons, expended teargas cartridges and discarded umbrellas. Almost every flat surface, including the road beneath my feet, was covered in graffiti. \u201cI will die for freedom,\u201d read one slogan on the perimeter fence of Admiralty Gardens.

Though the school student is still in a critical state in hospital, police and pro-Beijing politicians have been quick to defend the shooting as fully legitimate, because the officer was in fear for his life. The boy was armed with nothing more than a stick.\n\nThe incident has raised the stakes and the tension and it puts any solution even further out of reach. It feels like there is no way back now. The antipathy and distrust for the police was acute before this incident so it\u2019s hard to see how it will ever be repaired. The fact that Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive Carrie Lam was enjoying lavish VIP hospitality in Beijing, while citizens were being shot, will not help matters either.\n\nEarlier, before the shooting, I asked one masked female protester what she thought it would take to stop, or at least pause, the street protests. \u201cAt least, the government must grant our five demands,\u201d said Kei-ko Pun, as she marched through the busy shopping district of Causeway Bay \u2013 but she no longer thought Lam standing down, or resigning, would make any difference.\n\nThe economic impact has been catastrophic for local businesses. On Saturday evening, the only occupied table of about 40 in the dining room of the city\u2019s popular Foreign Correspondents Club, was mine.\n\nThe conflict has also split families. One student told me several of her friends no longer went home to their parents for fear of conflict and recriminations. Expatriates endlessly talk of when to escape and where best to go: Singapore is safe; Malaysia is cheap; Portugal is nearer home.\n\nSchoolboys are being shot, the streets are a battlefield, and the local economy is being devastated. The forces of law and order have lost popular support, and the chief executive of the city has lost the plot.\n\nNot even the Feng Shui masters make predictions anymore, but this feels like the beginning of the end for Hong Kong.\n\nStuart Heaver is a full-time freelance journalist and writer who lives and works in Hong Kong and has a special interest in Chinese history, culture, politics and maritime affairs.
