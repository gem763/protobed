Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX) spouted off about AR-15s and why she believes the rifle should be outlawed.\n\n\"I held an AR-15 in my hand. I wish I hadn't. It is as heavy as 10 boxes that you might be moving. And the bullet that is utilized, a .50 caliber, these kind of bullets need to be licensed and do not need to be on the street,\" Jackson-Lee told reporters.\n\n\u201cI held an AR-15 in my hand, I wish I hadn\u2019t. It is as heavy as 10 boxes that you might be moving. And the bullet that is utilized, a .50 caliber, these kinds of bullets need to be licensed and do not need to be on the street.\u201d - Rep. @JacksonLeeTX18 pic.twitter.com/U71ir6BHZH \u2014 Jason Howerton (@jason_howerton) September 23, 2019\n\nThere are so many things wrong with what she said.\n\nFor one, an AR-15 \u2013 which stands for Armalite Rifle, not \"assault rifle,\" like anti-gunners tell you \u2013 is usually around 6 to 7lbs. Not sure how many boxes Ms. Jackson Lee is packing, but seriously, the gun is not as heavy as it's making it out to be.\n\nSecond, AR-15s come in a variety of calibers but the most common are .223/5.56. And the size difference is out of this world.\n\nDear @JacksonLeeTX18,\n\n\n\nPlease note the difference.\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nEvery gun owner in America. pic.twitter.com/bMxNw9DYoa \u2014 Beth Baumann (@eb454) September 23, 2019\n\nThese are the kind of statements that irk Second Amendment supporters. How are we supposed to take legislators seriously when they don't even known the most basic things about firearms? These people are creating laws that outright ban specific guns and accessories yet they don't do their homework.\n\nJason Howerton explained why these statements are dangerous...and stupid.\n\nTHESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO WANT LEGISLATE FIREARMS. They know nothing. To say the ignorance is astounding and terrifying is an understatement.\n\n\n\nIs it ignorance? Or is it malevolence? I have a hard time believing someone who WRITES LAWS could be this misinformed.\n\n\n\nUnreal. \u2014 Jason Howerton (@jason_howerton) September 23, 2019\n\nFor my non-gun peeps, claiming an AR-15 shoots .50 caliber bullets is as asinine as saying your car runs on orange juice.\n\n\n\nAlso, an AR-15 generally weighs somewhere between 7-9 pounds. So if 10 of your moving boxes weight 9 pounds, you're really doing it wrong. \u2014 Jason Howerton (@jason_howerton) September 23, 2019\n\nyou can see how she got it wrong though. Basically the same. pic.twitter.com/MxSKB0X5cT \u2014 Jason Howerton (@jason_howerton) September 23, 2019\n\nTime to do your homework, Sheila.", "description": "Wow..09/23/2019 20:51:20PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Guy Benson", "Katie Pavlich", "Matt Vespa", "Reagan Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2017/75/f411fc92-4580-422a-a86e-fba94913371e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
