Erik Scott.\n\nMount Saint Mary's University tweeted that students at its Chalon campus near the museum were evacuated to another campus and classes were canceled for Monday.

No injuries had been reported.\n\nTo prevent power lines from sparking in high winds and setting off more blazes up north, PG&E said Sunday that power is out to 965,000 customers and another 100,000 have lost electricity because of strong gusts, bringing the number of residents impacted by blackouts to nearly 2.7 million people.\n\nThe biggest evacuation was in Northern California's Sonoma County where 180,000 people were told to pack up and leave.\n\nSome evacuating early Sunday had done so two years ago, when devastating wildfires swept through Sonoma and Napa and neighboring counties, killing 44 people.\n\nAt an evacuation center at Napa Valley College, Francisco Alvarado, 15, said he, two younger brothers and his parents decided to vacate their Calistoga home in advance of evacuation orders. Two years ago, the family had to flee, but in the middle of the night.\n\n'I'm pretty mad that we have to keep evacuating,' he said. 'I just want to be home. I'm trying to leave here tomorrow; I want to sleep in my bed.'\n\nHe said he wasn't sure who, if anyone, to blame for the repeated fires, but said he didn't fault PG&E for turning off the electricity to try to prevent them.\n\nRosa Schuth of Sebastopol stayed up late packing bags but didn't think she would need to evacuate because the fires never reached her town in 2017.\n\nShe had been asleep for a half hour when she heard sirens telling residents to go. She got in her car and hopped on a country road that became jammed with evacuees.\n\n'The wind is really something. It just rages and suddenly it stops, and you see a bird drifting by,' she said.\n\nElectricity is expected to begin being restored by Monday, though the utility warned it might cut power again as soon as Tuesday because of another forecast of strong winds that are expected to last until Wednesday.\n\nThe fear that the winds could blow embers and spread fire across a major highway prompted authorities to expand evacuation orders that covered parts of Santa Rosa, a city of 175,000 that was devastated by wildfire two years ago.\n\nLos Angeles Fire Department ordered mandatory evacuation from area near the J. Paul Getty Museum (seen in the above stock image)\n\nLos Angeles Fire Department spokesman Capt. Erik Scott says at least two structures were burning by around 5am on Monday.

More than 300 people slept inside an auditorium filled with cots and wheeled beds. Scores of others stayed in a separate building with their pets.\n\nAmong them was Maribel Cruz, 19, who packed up her dog, four cats and fish as soon as she was told to flee her trailer in the town of Windsor, about 60 miles (100 kilometers) north of San Francisco. She also grabbed a neighbor's cat.\n\n'I'm just nervous since I grew up in Windsor,' she said.

Six people left with injuries that were not life-threatening were taken to a hospital, police said.\n\nDuring the 2017 fires, winds up to 90 mph (144 kph) lasted for about 12 hours. This time, the gusts were stronger and expected to last more than 36 hours, ending Monday night, said Matt Mehle, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Monterey office.\n\nParched vegetation from unseasonably hot weather and low humidity was already igniting elsewhere, and firefighters scrambled to keep up.\n\nTwo grass fires shut down a 6-mile (10-kilometer) stretch of Interstate 80, including a bridge between the cities of Crockett and Vallejo, and forced the evacuation of 200 people from California State University Maritime Academy. An ember from one fire possibly sparked the other.\n\nSmoke from another grass fire Sunday forced the closure of a stretch of Interstate 80 running through Sacramento's downtown. Meanwhile, fire officials spotted downed power lines in the area of a small fire that destroyed a building at a tennis club and three other structures in Lafayette, a leafy suburb in the east San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nThe city of Vallejo said the power blackout shut off its pumping station needed to access its well water, prompting an emergency.

'I'm hoping the wind cooperates.'\n\nSonoma County Sheriff Mark Essick urged residents in the evacuation zone that stretched from the wine country to Bodega Bay on the coast to get out immediately, citing the 24 lives lost when fire swept through the region in October 2017.\n\n'Although I've heard people express concerns that we are evacuating too many people, I think those concerns are not valid at this point,' Essick said at a news conference Sunday, noting that the winds pushed fire toward the towns of Healdsburg and Windsor overnight.\n\nA helicopter drops water on the grounds of the California State University Maritime Academy while battling a grass fire in Vallejo, California, Sunday afternoon.
