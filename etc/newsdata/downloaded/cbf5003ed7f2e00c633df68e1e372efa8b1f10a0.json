I\u2019m cool with that. Assuming you can find one.\u201d\n\nCandidates began releasing statements ahead of the event near downtown Los Angeles. Kamala Harris said she would appoint a chief advocate for LGBTQ affairs in the White House. Warren released a lengthy plan that she said would secure LGBTQ rights and equality. Bernie Sanders, who is recovering in Vermont after a heart attack and will not attend, said in a statement that the nation \u201cmust not let Donald Trump and the Supreme Court take us backward on LGBTQ rights.\u201d\n\nThe 2020 campaign is unfolding at a time when polling shows significant backing for LGBT rights. A Pew Research Center poll in March pegged Americans\u2019 support for same-sex marriage at 61%. A Gallup poll found that 71% support allowing transgender people to serve in the military, a stance at odds with Trump\u2019s efforts to sharply restrict their military presence.\n\nIn the 2016 presidential contest, Democrat Hillary Clinton dominated among voters who identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender in her loss to the Republican Trump.\n\nAmong issues that came up repeatedly: The Supreme Court is weighing whether a landmark civil rights law protects LGBTQ people from discrimination in employment, and the Trump administration has reversed course from the Obama administration and has sided with employers who argue that the civil rights law does not protect LGBT people.\n\nThe administration also has moved to restrict military service by transgender men and women, proposed allowing certain homeless shelters to take gender identity into account in offering someone a bed for the night and concluded in a 2017 Justice Department memo that federal civil rights law does not protect transgender people from discrimination at work.\n\nIn a statement, Trump\u2019s campaign said the president \u201cstands in solidarity with all LGBTQ allies and is dedicated to creating a safer and stronger America for all citizens regardless of their sexual orientation, gender, religion, race, or ethnicity.\u201d The statement said that the administration has launched a global effort to end the criminalization of homosexuality and that Trump is dedicated to ending the HIV epidemic in the United States.\n\nCory Booker recalled the long fight over civil and women\u2019s rights and promised to bring the same urgency to the campaign for LGBTQ equality.\n\nThe New Jersey senator didn\u2019t give a direct answer when asked if religious groups should lose their tax-exempt status if they engage in discrimination against the LGBTQ community. \u201cThere have to be consequences for discrimination,\u201d he said while declining to answer yes or no to the question.\n\nThe Human Rights Campaign Foundation said it was the first time in history that a major cable news network will air a presidential event devoted to LGBTQ issues.\n\nLBGTQ-rights activists said they are eager to hear how the Democratic candidates intend to distinguish themselves on issues important to the community.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very nice to say, \u2018I support LBGT equality,\u2019 but how do you overcome the challenges that we face in our community? That\u2019s what we want to hear,\u201d Human Rights Campaign President Alphonso David told reporters.\n\n\u201cWe are not interested in the soundbites,\u201d he added.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Democratic presidential candidates took a detour from the impeachment inquiry to make a play for support with LGBTQ voters", "authors": ["Michael R.
