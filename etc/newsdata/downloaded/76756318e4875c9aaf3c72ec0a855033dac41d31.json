His body was found in a river days later. An all-white jury in Mississippi acquitted two white men of murder charges.\n\nPatrick Weems, executive director of the Emmett Till Memorial Commission, said the new marker was dedicated Saturday.\n\nMembers of Till\u2019s family, including a cousin who was there the night Till was kidnapped, attended the ceremony at the site where the teen\u2019s body was pulled from the Tallahatchie River.\n\nThis is the fourth historical marker at the site. Previous ones became a target for vandals.\n\nThe first historical marker was placed in 2008. Someone tossed it in the river. The second and third signs were shot at and left riddled with bullet holes.\n\nThe new 500-pound (225-kilogram) steel sign has a glass bulletproof front, Weems said.\n\nWeems said the markers were placed as an attempt to acknowledge the truth of what happened there and hopefully spark \u201cnew conversations.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor 50 years nobody talked about Emmett Till,\u201d Weems said.\n\n\u201cI think we just have to be resilient and know there are folks out there that don\u2019t want to know this history or who want to erase the history. We are just going to be resilient in continuing to put them back up and be truthful in making make sure that Emmett didn\u2019t die in vain.\u201d\n\nTwo of Till\u2019s cousins, the Rev. Wheeler Parker and Ollie Gordon, attended Saturday\u2019s ceremony, Weems said.\n\nParker had traveled with Till in the summer of 1955 from Chicago to the Mississippi Delta to visit relatives.\n\nIn a speech in Mississippi last year, Parker recalled the immediate sense of danger he felt when they encountered the woman at the store. Parker awoke hours later - at 2:30 a.m. - to the sound of Till\u2019s assailants knocking on the door of their grandparents\u2019 cabin and his grandmother offering them money to leave the family alone.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A new bulletproof memorial to Emmett Till was dedicated Saturday in Mississippi after previous historical markers were repeatedly vandalized.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/19/Emmett_Till_Memorial_76657.jpg-a80b0_c0-590-1837-1661_s1200x700.jpg?bfe5a0281ce005a72c74c2216caf4c3bbf6edbe3", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
