(Matt Rourke/AP)\n\nThe spirals of steam rising from the concrete cooling towers of Three Mile Island nuclear power plant have defined the greater Harrisburg skyline for nearly a half century. On Sept. 20, they disappeared forever.\n\nThree Mile Island, whose quartet of concrete towers represented the promise and peril of nuclear energy, closed 40 years after a partial meltdown forced more than 100,000 people to flee their homes in the worst nuclear accident in U.S. history.\n\nThe meltdown and subsequent radiation leak that started on March 28, 1979 , led to sweeping changes in federal regulation of nuclear power, galvanized the national antinuclear power movement and drove a deep fissure through the riverfront communities that flanked the plant. For many whose livelihoods depended on the plant, it was an economic lifeline, arriving just as the steel industry was fading; others saw a toxic time bomb in their backyards and vowed to fight until it was closed for good.\n\nThat day came on Friday, months after state lawmakers declined to approve last-ditch legislation to provide financial relief to the ailing nuclear power industry in Pennsylvania, amid the expansion of lower-cost natural gas and historic availability of coal.\n\nNuclear energy has long provided the lion\u2019s share of electric power generated in Pennsylvania \u2014 about 40 percent. But over the past decade, with the discovery of the Marcellus Shale deposit that courses below most of Pennsylvania, natural gas has surged ahead of coal and now produces almost 30 percent of the state\u2019s power.\n\nCritics, including environmental groups and the powerful natural gas lobby \u2014 condemned the legislation to save Three Mile Island as a $500 million bailout of a failing industry, similar to what New York, New Jersey, Illinois and Ohio have approved in recent years.\n\nPronuclear lawmakers, including those with the four remaining plants in their districts, and the union representing many nuclear energy workers, argued the legislation, by adding nuclear power to the state\u2019s Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards, would have helped address climate change, retained 600 jobs at TMI and preserved millions in local tax revenue.\n\nNuclear power is \u201cuniquely disadvantaged\u201d in the energy arena, said John Hanger, former secretary of the state Department of Environmental Protection and now an Exelon consultant. \u201cGas and coal are subsidized by paying nothing for their huge carbon cost,\u201d he said. \u201cRenewables get state Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards credit, plus federal production tax credits. Nuclear gets neither but must compete against subsidized gas.\u201d\n\nGov. Tom Wolf (D) supports nuclear power as an important part of Pennsylvania\u2019s energy mix, said Wolf spokesperson J.J. Abbott, but said the legislation as drafted would have been too costly for consumers, especially those with lower incomes.\n\nNow with aging reactors, lower cost alternatives and the specter of another accident, the decommissioning of TMI gets underway as the fate of Pennsylvania\u2019s nuclear power production remains in limbo.\n\nWhen it was commissioned in 1974, Three Mile Island was a source of pride in the Susquehanna River communities south of the state capital, like Steelton, which bears the name of the industry that built it, and had been crippled by the loss of manufacturing jobs.\n\n\u201cWe all embraced it,\u201d said Eric Epstein, 59, chairman of TMI Alert , a community education and watchdog group, who grew up in Harrisburg. \u201cIt was wonderful technology that touched down in community where steel and coal took a hit in the \u201970s. It meant jobs and money to the community.\u201d\n\nEverything changed on that Wednesday in late March in 1979.\n\nElizabethtown resident Pattie Longnecker and her husband, John, were on their way to a Lancaster County vineyard to gather vines for her wreath-making business when they stopped at a diner and heard on a trucker\u2019s CB radio that there had been an accident at the power plant, three miles from their home. They turned around and sped home after calling her sister to pick up her two children at elementary school.\n\nAs hours turned to days of uncertainty about what exactly had happened, their concern turned to alarm and disbelief, Pattie Longnecker said. After all, government officials had, since the opening of the Unit 1 in 1974, promised the plant was safe. When it became clear that there might be a radiation leak, the Longneckers fled to Virginia for a week.\n\nThe incident turned the former teacher into a community activist. She rallied her neighbors to fight to keep entire plant closed. Later, as part of a TMI Alert, she would educate residents and monitor actions of state and federal authorities charged with regulating the plant.\n\nUnit 2, where the partial meltdown occurred, would close permanently, and Unit 1 remained closed for a year following the accident. When it reopened, citizens\u2019 fear and distrust in government lingered and divided the community, many of whom were employed at the plant.\n\n\u201cI felt lied to by every level of government,\u201d Longnecker said.\n\nFor communities near the plant, the question of latent health effects from the accident and the potential for future leaks remained a concern. Federal and state government studies over the years concluded residents experienced minimal radiation exposure, equivalent to getting a chest X-ray.\n\nIn 1996, a federal judge found there was insufficient evidence to link radiation from the accident to health issues cited among 2,000 plaintiffs.\n\nMore recently, a 2017 Penn State study found a link between the accident and increased levels of thyroid cancer in the region around the plant, but the study did not conclude the radiation exposure caused the cancers.\n\nEvery August, in an eerie summer ritual, hundreds of residents within a 10-mile radius of TMI and the state\u2019s four other nuclear power plants line up to receive free potassium iodide pills provided by the state Department of Health that protect the thyroid gland in the event of radioactive iodine exposure.\n\nAs the pills were being distributed this summer, the decades-long process of decommissioning was already underway.\n\nIn June, FirstEnergy Corp., which owns Unit 2, began the process of transferring the long-shuttered reactor to EnergySolutions, Inc., which specializes in closing and decontaminating nuclear sites.\n\nExelon said the dismantling of the Unit 1 reactor and large components is scheduled for 2074 at a cost of $1.2 billion, which will be paid for by the decommissioning trust fund, provided by the utility.\n\nAny additional costs will be covered by Exelon, the company said. Any radioactive low-level equipment will be decontaminated and taken to out-of-state disposal facilities, while spent fuel will be put into metal canisters and placed in massive concrete housing, known as dry casks, by the end of 2022.\n\n\u201cThe storage facility is highly secured, and the casks are impervious to weather and risk of attack,\u201d Exelon said in a statement. \u201cThe canisters emit very low of radiation and they present no danger to the public.\u201d\n\nCritics, though, feel pushing the cleanup to the last quarter of the century could heighten the threat from radioactive waste and turn TMI into a nuclear waste ghost town.\n\n\u201cThere are no guarantees to ensure adequate funding is in place after Exelon deactivates the plant,\u201d Epstein said. \u201cTMI [Unit]-1 must be immediately cleaned up or it will be placed in a nuclear nether world like TMI-2.\u201d\n\nExelon Senior Vice President Kathleen L. Barron said while there are no plans to close its other facilities in Pennsylvania, the clock is ticking on nuclear power in the commonwealth and the United States.\n\nNo nuclear plants have been built in the United States since the Three Mile Island accident and a number of those operating then have been or are being decommissioned, among them FirstEnergy\u2019s Beaver Valley Nuclear Power Station near Pittsburgh, which is scheduled to close in 2021.\n\nSince its reopening a year after the accident, TMI has operated without incident, providing power to 800,000 homes.\n\n\u201cFor 40 years it\u2019s been abating hundreds of millions of tons of carbon and provided 40 percent of power,\u201d Barron said. \u201cPennsylvania needs to find a way to include nuclear in clean energy.\u201d\n\nAcross from the main entrance to the plant, an abandoned visitors center that once housed exhibits touting the future of nuclear power stands empty, covered in vines. Behind the center, rows of kale and sweet corn grow in a small vegetable garden, which is monitored for contamination. In a nearby grove of cherry trees, a plaque, obscured by overgrowth, describes the trees as a gift from Japanese utility company researchers as a symbol of friendship. The engineers had traveled to TMI in 1988 to learn about the accident in order to prevent a similar disaster in Japan. That was 23 years before the catastrophic accident at Japan\u2019s Fukushima nuclear power plant.\n\nFor those still living who sought to keep TMI closed after the accident, the battle isn\u2019t over.\n\nFears of flooding at the plant, leaks and the potential for terrorism are still real, Longnecker said. \u201cIt took over everyone\u2019s psyche and has continued for 40 years. \u201cIt\u2019s still the cause of so much uncertainty, and it has cast a shadow over the whole area.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will be gone,\u201d said Longnecker, 75, as she collects carrots to take to her three donkeys with whom she and John, 81, share the wooded property. \u201cThe bigger fight is the cleanup. It won\u2019t be over until we are free of the contamination.\u201d", "description": "A partial meltdown of the plant in 1979 led to sweeping changes in federal regulations and galvanized the national antinuclear power movement.", "authors": ["Amy Worden", "September At Am", "Amy Worden Is A Freelance Journalist Living In York Springs"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/PBEXYLsRNbF4mulbFiRMJ5u67XA=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GY7CGOW72YI6TPUWNLNYDAQ6SA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
