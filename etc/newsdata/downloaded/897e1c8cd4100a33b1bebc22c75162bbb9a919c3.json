Mark A. Milley , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters at a Pentagon news conference that he does not have similar information, but said Mr. Trump may have gotten his details from a conversation with military personnel on the ground who were involved in the raid.\n\n\u201cI know the president had planned to talk down to the unit and unit members,\u201d General Milley said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know what the source of that was.
