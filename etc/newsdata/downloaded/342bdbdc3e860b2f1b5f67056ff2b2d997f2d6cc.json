Assuming the newest iPhone worked well, my advice was generally the same \u2014 I recommended upgrading if you had owned your existing smartphone for two years.\n\nBut with this review of the iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max \u2014 the newest models that Apple unveiled last week and which will become available this Friday \u2014 I\u2019m encouraging a different approach. The bottom line? It\u2019s time to reset our upgrade criteria.\n\nThat\u2019s because we are now living in the golden age of smartphones, where the gadgets\u2019 improvements each year are far from seismic. Devices that debuted three years ago remain zippy and more than capable. Those with the iPhone 7 from 2016, for example, still have a very good phone with a stellar camera and fast speeds.", "description": "This is not your typical gadget review.
