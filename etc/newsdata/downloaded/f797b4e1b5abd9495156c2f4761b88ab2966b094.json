I kept trying to hit fairways and greens and give myself a lot of birdie chances, and he just kept getting up and down from everywhere,\u201d said world number five Thomas, who pocketed $1.755 million for the win.\n\nSeoul-born New Zealander Lee, who started the day tied for the lead at 15-under par with Thomas, carded a three-under par 69, cheered on by huge galleries hoping for a first Korean-born winner of the US PGA Tour event.\n\nThere was a three-way tie for third on 15-under par between Japan\u2019s Hideki Matsuyama (65), US Open champion Gary Woodland (66) and Australia\u2019s Cameron Smith who finished with an eagle for a 69.\n\nBut none of them remotely threatened the leading pair who fought out a compelling head-to-head shootout in perfect conditions under clear blue skies.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Birthday present\u2019 \u2013\n\nAmerican Thomas, from Louisville, Kentucky, has been watched all week by his parents, who flew over to support him.\n\n\u201cMy dad turned 60 last week, so maybe it\u2019s a little 60th birthday gift to him. I\u2019m glad he didn\u2019t come over here to watch me not play very well,\u201d said Thomas, who won the inaugural 2017 CJ Cup at the spectacular Nine Bridges club, set on the slopes of South Korea\u2019s tallest mountain, Hallasan.\n\nThomas has now equalled Jordan Spieth and Rory McIlroy by winning 11 US PGA Tour titles before his 27th birthday.\n\nOnly Tiger Woods and Jack Nicklaus had won more by that age, and four of Thomas\u2019s wins have come from just nine PGA Tour starts Asia \u2014 he won the CIMB Classic in Malaysia in 2015 and 2016.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always nice playing, trying to win in a place you\u2019ve already won at,\u201d said world number five Thomas.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve only had that opportunity one other time in Malaysia, but it\u2019s pretty awesome. I don\u2019t know, something about Asia I like.\u201d\n\nWorld number 162 Lee eventually blinked first under relentless pressure with bogeys at 15 and 16.\n\nBut there was still time for one last twist as Thomas\u2019s par putt on the short 17th lipped out and he went to the 18th two shots up.\n\nThere had been a three-stroke swing on the 18th on Saturday when Lee holed a snaky 60-foot eagle putt while Thomas dropped a shot after finding water.\n\nThis time Thomas stayed dry, though Lee came within a whisker of repeating his eagle of the previous day \u2014 but this time the long putt horseshoed out and a relieved Thomas was left with two putts for the title. He needed only one.\n\n\u201cBefore I teed off my very first tee shot on Thursday, if someone\u2019s going to give me solo second, I would take it in a heartbeat,\u201d said Lee.", "description": "Jeju (South Korea) (AFP) \u2013 Justin Thomas won the CJ Cup on Sunday for the second time in three years, but it took until the closing stretch to see", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/b4cb22_justin-thomas-acknowledges-his-birdie-putt-on-green-final-cj-cup-thomas-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
