If Joe Biden Can't See That, He Should Get Out of the Way.", "language": "en", "text": "From Esquire\n\nI am excessively neutral on the subject of Joe Biden as a candidate for president. History would indicate that giving him another shot at it would be rather like handing Joe Hazelwood another supertanker. Nonetheless, considering the alternative, I'd walk through fire to vote for him. However, this piece in The New York Times is a vivid reminder that a) Biden's skills as a campaigner remain dodgy, and b) that he also seems to have lost a step as well.\n\n\n\nFor more than a week, President Trump had been hurling unfounded accusations about Mr. Biden, his son Hunter and their dealings in Ukraine. Mr. Biden and his advisers debated whether to mount a fierce counterattack or to stick to a set of policy arguments he had been planning to roll out. Bad news loomed in the background: Mr. Biden\u2019s poll numbers had already grown wobbly, his fund-raising was uneven, and cable news was flashing chyrons by the hour showing Mr. Trump\u2019s wild claims.\n\nMr. Biden himself was equivocating: He wanted to defend and protect his son, but he also believed the president was baiting him into a dirty fight. And as a lifelong adherent to congressional tradition, Mr. Biden was wary of acting hastily as an impeachment inquiry was getting underway.\n\n\n\nChristamighty, what is wrong with the man? He and his son are being smeared by foreign ratfckers and a criminal president* and he can't get the old backslapping, pork-barreling Senate club out of his head? Joe, bubba, at the moment, those \"congressional traditions\" are as dead as Henry Clay. Adhering to them makes you look like a doddering relic of ancient times, and it also makes it look like you won't fight for yourself and your family. There's certainly no Scranton in that line of thinking.\n\n\n\nThe strain grew so acute that some of Mr. Biden\u2019s advisers lashed out at their own party, taking the unusual step of urging campaign surrogates to criticize the Democratic National Committee \u2014 a neutral body in the primary \u2014 for not doing more to defend Mr. Biden, while the Republican National Committee was running TV ads attacking him. Frustrated, D.N.C. officials informed the Biden camp that it would continue denouncing Mr. Trump but would not run ads for Mr. Biden or any other candidate.\n\n\n\nDo it yourself, Joe. Don't fob it off on the DNC. That's an institutionalist's response to guerrilla attacks. Peace in our time? You have to be kidding. Look at how you're panicking the traditionally timorous\u2014and perennially anonymous\u2014Democratic consultant class.\n\n\n\nBut Mr. Biden is confronting an almost unimaginable situation: the president he hopes to challenge is facing impeachment for urging another country to help smear him. What\u2019s more, the House inquiry centers on what Mr. Biden values most in his private and public life: protecting his family and honoring institutional norms.\n\nSeveral Democrats close to Mr. Biden say he did not take on Mr. Trump sooner in large part because of his reverence for congressional prerogatives \u2014 he did not want to immediately insert himself into the House\u2019s jurisdiction. But Mr. Biden also sought to address the attacks on his son on his own terms rather than sit for hastily arranged television interviews that would have forced him to answer questions about Hunter Biden\u2019s work that few of his own aides dared pose.\n\n\n\nI understand the family stuff. Really, I do, even though if he can't find a way to turn the corruption attacks on his son around on Sluggo Jr., the Princess, the Dauphin Son-in-Law, and The Dumb One, somebody in the Biden campaign deserves to be fired. But screw institutional norms. It's like running into a burning house in order to save the smoke alarms. This election always was going to be a mudfight. Accept that and move forward, or get out of the way for someone who understands the stakes. When they go low, kick them in the head.\n\nRespond to this post on the Esquire Politics Facebook Page here.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "The former vice president must come to grips with what he's up against in Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Charles P.
