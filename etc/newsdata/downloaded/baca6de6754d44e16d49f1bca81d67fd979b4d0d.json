Wednesday to see how he plans to fill the financial black hole that Eskom\u2019s debt has created on the state\u2019s balance book.\n\nEconomists and tax experts have been warning for some time that poor economic growth and the government\u2019s spiralling debt \u2013 much of it created by bailing out beleaguered state-owned enterprises \u2013 is negative for South Africa\u2019s credit rating.\n\nMoody\u2019s is the only major rating agency that still rates South Africa\u2019s sovereign debt at investment grade.\n\nKamilla Kaplan, an economist from Investec, warns that if Moody\u2019s is not satisfied with plans for fiscal consolidation in the budget, it could change the credit outlook from stable to negative by as early as Friday.\n\nThat could lead to a downgrade in a year\u2019s time which will cause huge capital outflows because most institutional investors are prohibited from investing in government bonds from countries that have sub-investment credit ratings.\n\nLara Hodes, also from Investec, said that a narrower budget deficit was set out as a key priority in the February budget.\n\nIt was expected the budget deficit as a percentage of GDP would be 4.5% in the 2019/20 financial year.\n\nBut it\u2019s expected that the deficit has expanded to 6% of GDP \u2013 largely as a result of weaker tax revenue collection and higher government expenditure.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund recently revised its growth expectation for South Africa downward, from 1.2% to 0.7%.\n\nThe SA Reserve Bank expects growth of 0.6%.\n\nMike Teuchert, head of tax at Mazars, said that Treasury previously expected government debt would be just more than 60% of GDP by 2023/24, but it now appears that it will be higher at 62.2%.\n\nDebt in 2015/16 was only at about 50%.\n\nHe said that for the government to decrease its indebtedness, it had to either spend less or collect more revenue.\n\nHodes said that since 2008/09, government expenditure had repeatedly exceeded its income.\n\nFor the financial year to date (April to August) income grew by 4.2% year on year, while expenditure rose 12.6% year on year to R699.1 billion.\n\nThis is the biggest growth in expenditure since the world recession in 2008.\n\nSanisha Packirisamy, an economist with Momentum Investments, said that if revenue collection continues at such a slow pace, the SA Revenue Service could miss its collection target by R97 billion (including, VAT of R27.3 billion and personal income tax of R43.3 billion).\n\nIf the seasonality of certain collections and VAT collections are taken into account, the shortfall could be less \u2013 about R50 billion.\n\nTeuchert said that if less tax revenue is collected than the target of R1.422 trillion, the minister would have to give an indication of whether spending would be curbed or whether South Africa would borrow more.\n\nIf government departments manage to curtail their expenditure in the next three financial years \u2013 as Treasury has requested \u2013 it could restrict expenditure with R300 billion over three years, said Momentum Investments.\n\nMeanwhile, the government\u2019s plans to limit its public sector wage bill received a frosty reception from the Public Servants\u2019 Association (PSA), which represents more than 240 000 public servants.\n\nThe bill makes up about 35% of government expenditure.\n\nIvan Fredericks, of the PSA, responded to a recent suggestion that public sector salaries be frozen by questioning why public servants should \u201cpay the price for the weak economy, which can be ascribed to widespread maladministration and corruption\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhile government is quick to blame the state\u2019s high wage bill, there has been little action taken against offenders whose corrupt conduct has forced the economy to its knees.\u201d\n\nHodes said, hopefully, the minister would give details of the final version of the country\u2019s economic strategy.\n\nMboweni\u2019s proposed economic policy document, which came to light in August and has been partially supported by the ANC\u2019s national executive committee, proposes reforms which could see the economy grow by 2% or more a year in the next 10 years, said Hodes.\n\nIt also aims to create 1 million jobs.", "description": "All eyes will be on Finance Minister Tito Mboweni\u2019s
