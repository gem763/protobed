While social media is a key promotional tool of the pop industry, and fame has a price, this doesn\u2019t excuse the way that Nelson was tortured about her looks and weight. Still, her experience usefully demonstrates how young people \u2013 even famous, successful ones \u2013 can be tricked into tending their own online misery.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing original about casual cruelty but these days, it\u2019s turbo-boosted by social media platforms that allow people to unleash darkness, then pop out for a pizza as though nothing has happened. It\u2019s not the spite that\u2019s new \u2013 it\u2019s the ease of it, the grotesque lack of accountability.\n\nNobody is made to \u201cown\u201d what they say or do, so they can say and do anything. Even the fact that this isn\u2019t new any more has become part of the ugliness \u2013 it\u2019s a disgrace that what is effectively a form of psychological mass brutality remains largely unregulated.\n\nHowever, what\u2019s happening on the outside is only part of the story. It\u2019s not only about the trolls \u2013 it\u2019s about the damage caused by our inner trolls. This is one of the monstrous things about cyber-bullying \u2013 how trolling can end up feeding the target\u2019s inner troll and how easily this can happen to the famous and non-famous alike. Nelson, for one, felt compelled to keep reading the messages that slated her, to keep investing in the toxic narratives that made her feel devastated, paranoid and, ultimately, suicidal.\n\nThe wise thing would be to ignore it, but it\u2019s a rare young person who can turn down the volume on their own insecurities. It also taps into that vulnerable side of human nature \u2013 certainly one most young females experience \u2013 where you are achingly slow to believe the good news about yourself, but horribly fast to buy into the bad news.\n\nIn this way, the target unwittingly works alongside the troll to engineer their own downfall, a process that is as addictive as it is corrosive and, in some cases, fatal. It\u2019s a confidence trick really, a collaborative effort. You could see how someone like Nelson could end up waving away compliments for her achievements, while allowing derision to become her only reality. In fact, you could see it happening to anyone, especially when they\u2019re young. If self-doubt is a poison, it really doesn\u2019t take much to trick a young female into swigging it straight down.\n\nThis is what I mean by tending your own online misery. Without the target ready and willing to receive it (and believe it), the vitriol would just be arrows shooting pointlessly into a vast, pixelated void. Of course, far higher consequences for online venom are sorely needed. In the meantime, the only solution, for Nelson and other targets, is to ignore it and to realise that this truly is an option.\n\nMemo to Donald Trump: your wife is called Melania\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Donald Trump and Melania: he \u2018clearly needs crib cards or idiot boards\u2019. Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n\nEveryone has moments when they forget they\u2019ve produced certain children. The experience is about as universal as it gets. This time, it was Donald Trump\u2019s turn to \u201cdisremember\u201d a human being he\u2019d sired. At a press conference about the health risks of vaping for young people, he referred to his wife Melania\u2019s concerns for their child, 13-year-old Barron, saying: \u201cShe\u2019s got a son.\u201d There followed a brief and terrible pause. \u201cTogether.\u201d\n\nOne tiny moment, so many questions. Had the president forgotten that Barron was his son too? Was that barked \u201ctogether\u201d his attempt to correct the error, the same way a malfunctioning robot might signal with sad flashing eyes that it needed to be recharged? Why did Trump keep saying \u201cshe\u201d? Oh Christ, had he forgotten Melania\u2019s name too? Trump clearly needs crib cards or idiot boards to keep these pesky, low-priority, biog-facts straight. Let\u2019s run through the basics. He has a wife called Melania and they have a son called Barron Trump, who sounds a bit like a character from Wacky Races. Ivanka is the daughter that Trump called \u201chot\u201d and said he\u2019d probably be dating her if they weren\u2019t related. Another daughter, Tiffany, is rarely seen. Don Jnr and Eric are the creepy sons who resemble the staff of a haunted house in a low-budget horror film and could be easily imagined bringing gifts of small dead animals and birds for their father to admire.\n\nThis needs nailing down \u2013 it just plays bad in Ohio if the president can\u2019t remember some of his kids. To the rest of us, the Trumps may come across as Succession meets The Addams Family, but Trump is going to have to remember all his children if he\u2019s serious about getting that much-vaunted Trump political dynasty thing going.\n\nAdulterous sex? Just part of a hard day\u2019s work \u2013 in France\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Adultery, French style: Greg Wise and Frances O\u2019Connor in Madame Bovary.\n\nPhotograph: Joss Barratt/BBC TWO\n\nPlease be alerted to what we might call the \u201cmost French-sounding story ever\u201d. A French court ruled that a man who died from a heart attack after having adulterous sex during a work trip had suffered a \u201cworkplace accident\u201d. While his employers argued that the man (\u201cXavier X\u201d) interrupted work for the rendezvous, it was decided that sex was part of everyday life, \u201clike having a shower or a meal\u201d. Therefore, crucially, the worker\u2019s family would receive a better pension and other help.\n\nFrance isn\u2019t the only country to define workplace accidents as anything that happens during a work trip, though all I can find for the UK are photos of people falling off ladders or lying under boxes. With due respect, Xavier appears to have raised the stakes on the definition of \u201cwork-related\u201d. Meanwhile, British people on business trips worry about putting a Toblerone from the minibar on expenses.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to imagine a journalist having such a work-related accident or indulging in anything but exemplary behaviour, but this makes a funny kind of sense. Certainly, it fits the standard British cultural characterisation of the French \u2013 the sophistication, the sang-froid regarding les affaires d\u2019amour\u2026 and now the adulterous bunk-ups as part of the normal working day.
