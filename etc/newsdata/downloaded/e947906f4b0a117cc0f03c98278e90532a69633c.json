A number of companies have said they are pulling back because of economic uncertainty, particularly related to whether trade rules will be shifting with China and other countries. Spending on both structures and equipment was deeply negative.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSlow growth abroad and problems at big employers such as Boeing and General Motors also were a drag on growth. Tens of thousands of workers went on strike at GM in September, halting most production at the company. And Boeing, the U.S.'s largest exporter, remains under pressure after two fatal crashes of its 737 Max jets in the past year.\n\nAfter revving to 2.9 percent growth in 2018, the U.S. economy appears to be settling into the slower pace that it notched during the final year of the Obama administration. Trump vowed during his presidential campaign that he could boost the economy to around 4 percent growth, a level not seen in years. He has also promised at least 3 percent growth a year, an annual pace he has yet to achieve.\n\nBut the consensus view is that the economy is shifting to a lower gear. Still, the sustained pace suggests it is unlikely to dive into a recession anytime soon, unless there is a major shock or the trade war worsens significantly. Low unemployment, rising wages, and high stock prices have helped fuel consumer spending. Higher federal government spending also provided some lift to growth, helping offset the business investment decline.\n\nAfter a weak second quarter, White House officials predicted a big rebound in the second half of 2019. White House officials believe they are close to big breakthroughs in two separate trade efforts, one with China and another with Canada and Mexico. But most economists predict more subdued growth is here to stay.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAs the benefits of fiscal stimulus fade and trade policy uncertainty and slowing global demand remain headwinds to business investment, U.S. GDP growth should continue to moderate in coming quarters,\" wrote Sam Bullard, chief economist at Wells Fargo, in a note to clients. \"That said, we view recession in the near-term as still unlikely.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s economic agenda has resulted in tax cuts, deregulation, trade fights, and spending increases. He and top aides have said this approach would lead to a major acceleration in economic growth, which had slowed markedly during President Obama\u2019s last year in office. The unemployment rate has fallen since Trump\u2019s election from 4.7 percent to 3.5 percent, and the stock market reached a new all-time high this week.\n\nBut other measurements of the economy have shown weakness.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMany business leaders and economists believe Trump\u2019s strategy helped fuel new business investment through most of last year, but concerns about trade fights with China and Europe have led many companies to pull back, especially in the past six months. The July through September period marks marks the second time since Trump took office that quarterly growth has fallen below 2 percent.\n\n\u201cThe capital spending numbers were awful, and a bit worst than we expected, with structures investment -- oil rigs, offices, factories, commercial premises -- plunging 15.3 percent,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.\n\nTrump has continued to celebrate any good economic news, including the stock market record this week, and blame any weak numbers on Democrats and the Federal Reserve, the institution he says choked growth by keeping the cost of borrowing too high. The Fed is widely expected to make a modest cut to interest rates at 2pm on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe Greatest Economy in American History!\u201d Trump tweeted Wednesday morning, less than an hour before the Commerce Department\u2019s report on economic growth. On Tuesday he tweeted that \u201cThe Fed doesn\u2019t have a clue! We have unlimited potential, only held back by the Federal Reserve. But we are winning anyway!\u201d\n\nThe U.S. economy is in the midst of its 11th straight year of growth, making this the longest expansion in the nation\u2019s history.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDuring Trump\u2019s term in office, the economy has grown at an annual pace of around 2.35 percent, after accounting for the effects of inflation and other factors. If that pace were to continue, it would edge past George W. Bush\u2019s first term and Obama\u2019s second to become the fastest term of growth since Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s claim that the growth is the best in U.S. history is not accurate. In the recent past, Clinton and Ronald Reagan each oversaw two terms of growth above 3 percent a year. Growth of at least 2 percent has been the norm for decades -- the U.S. typically hits that mark in two out of every three quarters.\n\nRelated:\n\nAD", "description": "Trump promised at least 3 percent growth a year, an annual pace he has yet to achieve.
