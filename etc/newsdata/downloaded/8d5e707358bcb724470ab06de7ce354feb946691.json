Q3 is also a manifesto of us keeping our second promise: continued strong top line momentum. Despite continued macro uncertainties we couldn't be more confident to make 2019 another stellar year for SAP.\"\n\nLuka Mucic, CFO\n\n\"Our third quarter results reflect the momentum we've built entering the final quarter of the year and more broadly where we are on our journey of growth and opera-tional excellence. We are excited and energized to write the next chapter in SAP's story alongside the best workforce anywhere in the technology industry.\"\n\nJennifer Morgan and Christian Klein, Co-CEOs\n\nSAP SE (SAP) today announced its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2019.\n\nBusiness Performance\n\nFinancial Highlights Third Quarter 20191\n\nIn the third quarter, new cloud bookings were up 39% to \u20ac572 million (34% at constant currencies) and up 51% excluding Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS). A new partnership with Microsoft contributed 18 percentage points to the 39% Q3 new cloud bookings growth. The deal has a term of 3 years, with revenue recognition starting in the fourth quarter 2019. Cloud revenue grew 37% year over year to \u20ac1.79 billion (IFRS), up 37% (non-IFRS) and 33% (non-IFRS at constant currencies). Software licenses revenue was down 1% year over year to \u20ac932 million (IFRS), down 1% (non-IFRS) and down 4% (non-IFRS at constant currencies). New cloud and software order entry was up 20% (15% at constant currencies) year over year in the third quarter. Cloud and software revenue grew 12% year over year to \u20ac5.63 billion (IFRS), up 13% (non-IFRS) and 10% (non-IFRS at constant currencies). Total revenue grew 13% year over year to \u20ac6.79 billion (IFRS), up 13% (non-IFRS) and 10% (non-IFRS at constant currencies).\n\nThe share of more predictable revenue grew by two percentage points year-over-year to 69% in the third quarter.\n\nCloud gross margin increased 5.9 percentage points year over year to 64.5% (IFRS) and increased by 5.4 percentage points year over year to 69.0% (non-IFRS).\n\nOperating profit increased 36% year over year to \u20ac1.68 billion (IFRS), up 20% (non-IFRS) and up 15% (non-IFRS at constant currencies). Operating margin increased 4.2 percentage points year over year to 24.7% (IFRS) and expanded by 1.7 percentage points year over year to 30.6% (non-IFRS) and 1.5 percentage points to 30.4% (non-IFRS at constant currencies). Operating profit in the third quarter benefitted from disciplined hiring and accelerated operating efficiency gains. IFRS operating profit additionally benefitted from lower share-based compensation expenses.\n\nEarnings per share was up 28% to \u20ac1.04 (IFRS) and up 14% to \u20ac1.30 (non-IFRS).\n\nOperating cash flow in the third quarter developed significantly better than in the first half of 2019 and contributed \u20ac638 million (up 28% year-over-year) to the nine-month operating cash flow. Operating cash flow for the first nine months was \u20ac3.32 billion, down 5% year-over-year. The decrease in operating cash flow was primarily due to higher payouts related to share-based compensation (\u20ac205 million), restructuring payouts (\u20ac239 million) and higher tax cash outflows (\u20ac490 million) compared to the first nine months of 2018. In addition, operating cash flow experienced a year over year benefit of roughly \u20ac288 million from the application of IFRS 16. Free cash flow2 was flat year-over-year at \u20ac2.33 billion. At the end of the third quarter, net liquidity was -\u20ac8.28 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nSegment Performance Third Quarter 2019\n\nSAP's three reportable segments \"Applications, Technology & Services\", \"Intelligent Spend Group\" and \"Customer and Experience Management\" showed the following performance:\n\nApplications, Technology & Services (AT&S)\n\nIn the third quarter, segment revenue in AT&S was up 9% to \u20ac5.52 billion year-over-year (up 6% at constant currencies). Solutions which contributed to this growth are listed below.\n\nIn the third quarter, SAP and Microsoft established a preferred partnership to move on-premise SAP ERP and S/4HANA customers to the cloud through industry specific best practices, reference architectures, and cloud-delivered services on Microsoft Azure. This partnership will both accelerate and simplify customer migration to S/4HANA on Microsoft Azure, and Microsoft will embed SAP Cloud platform solutions and related services within Azure Cloud Services.\n\nSAP S/4HANA\n\nSAP S/4HANA is at the core of the Intelligent Enterprise. It embeds analytics, simulation, prediction, and decision support to run LIVE business. SAP offers customers a choice of deployment options including cloud, on-premise and hybrid so they can choose any scenario or combination that is right for them.

McDonald's UAE and Xinjiang Daming Mining Group Co. have gone live on S/4HANA Cloud.\n\nHuman Capital Management Solutions (HCM)\n\nSuccessFactors' evolution towards Human Experience Management (EmployeeXM\u2122) represents the next generation of human capital management (HCM).\n\nThe unique combination of SAP SuccessFactors and Qualtrics Employee Experience Management elevates HCM solutions beyond facilitating transactions to truly reinvent human experiences in ways that accelerate business growth. Employees are the frontline face to the customer. Delivering great customer experiences requires focusing on employees and delivering great employee experiences. Organizations that deliver exceptional employee experiences achieve better business results and outperform the competition.\n\nProximus Group, a top Belgian provider of information and communications technology, selected Qualtrics Employee Experience to support an ambitious new employee listening program. The combination of SAP and Qualtrics solutions will ultimately empower Proximus Group to blend customer experience data with employee experience data to enable holistic, personalized experience management.\n\nSAP SuccessFactors Employee Central, which is the flagship of SAP's HCM offering, added more than 150 customers in the quarter and has now more than 3,500 customers globally. Vonovia SE was one of many competitive wins and the International Committee of the Red Cross went live on SAP SuccessFactors this quarter.\n\nBusiness Technology Platform\n\nSAP's business technology platform represents an evolution of the digital platform helping customers to turn their data into business value. It encompasses database and data management, application development and integration, analytics, and intelligent technologies. The business technology platform represents a combination of SAP's leading technologies such as SAP HANA, SAP Cloud Platform, SAP Data Warehouse Cloud, SAP Analytics Cloud, SAP Data Intelligence and SAP Intelligent Robotic Process Automation bundled into one single reference architecture.

The Intelligent Spend Group portfolio represents the largest commerce platform in the world with approximately $3.4 trillion in global commerce annually transacted in more than 180 countries.\n\nBritish Telecom, Prada, and Xiaomi Communications chose SAP's Intelligent Spend Group solutions in the third quarter.\n\nCustomer and Experience Management (CXM)\n\nIn the third quarter, segment revenue in Customer and Experience Management was up 75% to \u20ac371 million year-over-year (69% at constant currencies). Solutions which contributed to this growth in the third quarter are listed below3.\n\nSAP C/4HANA\n\nSAP's C/4HANA suite enables companies to manage and deliver personalized customer experiences across every touchpoint and across channels based on a complete view of the customer. C/4HANA combines leading solutions for marketing, sales, commerce, service and customer data. As part of the Intelligent Enterprise, C/4HANA integrates with S/4HANA to connect demand signals to fulfillment in one end-to-end process.\n\nSAP C/4HANA solutions also leverage Qualtrics CustomerXM\u2122. This enables organizations to combine customer feedback and operational data to listen, understand and take action in the moment to improve the customer experience.\n\nE.ON, Swift, and Cintac Mining all chose SAP C/4HANA in Q3.\n\nExperience Management Solutions (Qualtrics)\n\nWith Qualtrics, SAP combines market leadership in Experience Management (XM) with end-to-end operational power in over 25 industries to help organizations manage and improve the four core experiences of business: customer, employee, product, and brand.\n\nThe Qualtrics XM\u2122 Platform is trusted by approx. 11,000 customers to listen, understand, and take action on experience data (X-data\u2122) by combining X-data with the operational data (O-data\u2122) systems of the enterprise.\n\nIn Q3, Slack Technologies, U-Haul, Sharper Image Corp, Stanley Black & Decker, Garmin International, Dish Networks and many others selected Qualtrics to move beyond systems of record to new systems of action and achieve breakthrough results.\n\nSegment Results at a Glance4\n\nSegment Performance Third Quarter 2019\n\nApplications, Technology & Services Intelligent Spend Group Customer and Experience Management \u20ac million, unless otherwise stated (Non-IFRS) Actual Currency \u2206 in % \u2206 in % const. curr.

The comparative numbers for full year 2018 do not include Qualtrics revenues and profits and include Callidus revenue and profits only from the April 5th, 2018 acquisition date.\n\nWhile SAP's full-year 2019 business outlook is at constant currencies, actual currency reported figures are expected to be impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations as the Company progresses through the year.

Consequently, orders to renew existing contracts are not included in this metric. The order amount must be committed. Consequently, due to their pay-per-use nature, business network transaction fees which do not include a committed minimum consumption are not reflected in the bookings metric (e.g. SAP Ariba and SAP Fieldglass transaction-based fees). Amounts included in the measures are generally annualized (annualized contract value ACV).\n\nShare of more predictable revenue is the total of non-IFRS cloud revenue and non-IFRS software support revenue as a percentage of total revenue\n\nNew cloud and software license order entry is the total of new cloud order entry and software license order entry. The new cloud order entry metric is identical to the new cloud bookings metric defined above except that it considers the total contract value (TCV) of the orders where the new cloud bookings metric considers the orders' annualized contract value (ACV). Software license order entry is the total of all orders received in a given period the revenue from which is expected to be classified as software license revenue. The support services commonly sold with the software license are not included in the software license order entry metric.\n\nGlobal commerce is the total commerce volume transacted on the SAP Ariba, SAP Concur and SAP Fieldglass Networks in the trailing 12 months. SAP Ariba commerce includes procurement and sourcing spend.\n\nFor explanations on other key growth metrics please refer the performance management section of SAP's Integrated Report 2018, which can be found at www.sapintegratedreport.com.\n\nWebcast\n\nSAP senior management will host a financial analyst conference call today at 2:00 PM (CET) / 1:00 PM (GMT) / 8:00 AM (Eastern) / 5:00 AM (Pacific).
