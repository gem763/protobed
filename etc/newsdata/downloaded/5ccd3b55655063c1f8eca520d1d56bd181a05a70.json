That could let people lay their AirPods or Apple Watch on the back, and have them take power out of the phone's battery.\n\niFixit now says that Apple appears to have worked on that feature for the iPhone and then pulled it. The decision presumably came late in the phone's development, given the parts are still inside.\n\nThe site reported that the extra connector in the battery appears to connect straight to the wireless charging coil in the back, and that it appeared to behave in a way that suggested it was watching to ensure it did not get too hot while charging up.\n\nThe discovery has led some to speculate that Apple could turn on the feature at a later date, using a software update that would remotely activate it. But Apple may choose not to mention the feature at all, or only bring it to future devices.", "description": "Apple's new iPhone 11 Pro could have an unannounced\u00a0feature hidden inside of it, according to those who have already torn it apart.
