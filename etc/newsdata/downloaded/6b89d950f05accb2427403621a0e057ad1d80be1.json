It has demanded transitional institutions to replace Algeria's entire system of government, in place since independence from France in 1962.\n\nAuthorities have rejected these demands, but protests continue.\n\nPolls planned for July 4 were postponed due to a lack of viable candidates, plunging the country into a constitutional crisis, as interim president Abdelkader Bensalah's mandate expired that month.\n\nBensalah, also an RND member, was speaker of the Upper House for 17 years under Bouteflika.\n\nThe RND was founded in 1997 and for 20 years was the main ally of Bouteflika's National Liberation Front (FLN).\n\nThe RND supported Bouteflika's candidacy for a fifth term, despite him suffering a debilitating stroke in 2013, but his candidacy prompted massive protests that led to his departure.\n\nUntil recently, the RND was led by Ahmed Ouyahia, an unpopular three time former prime minister under Bouteflika who was arrested in June in a graft investigation.\n\nMihoubi's nomination prompted a flood of negative comments online.\n\nFive other candidates have made appointments to submit their candidacy to the elections authority, spokesman Ali Draa told AFP.\n\nLocal media reports indicate that they include two former Bouteflika era prime ministers, Ali Benflis and Abdelmadjid Tebboune.\n\nThe deadline for submitting applications is Saturday at midnight (2300 GMT).", "description": "The head of an Algerian political party that was part of the ruling coalition under former president Abdelaziz Bouteflika on Wednesday became the first candidate to register for presidential polls.
