But what seems to be getting lost in the understandable turmoil is that your wife is still here, which means she has agency over how she interacts with these people before the funeral happens.\n\nLet\u2019s back up for a minute. What\u2019s complicated about funerals is that not everyone agrees on whom they\u2019re for. Are funerals for the dying, comforted by the knowledge that they\u2019ll be surrounded by friends and family when laid to rest? Or are funerals for the living, a chance to grieve in the company of others and get one final goodbye? Whose comfort and peace of mind are funerals for?\n\nIt sounds like you and your wife believe that funerals are for the person who died, and therefore this person should determine before her death who will be there. And it sounds like your mother-in-law believes that funerals are for the living, and therefore that your wife\u2019s ex-stepfather and siblings will want to be there. You probably won\u2019t resolve this philosophical difference\u2014though understanding it may help you to be more compassionate toward your mother-in-law\u2019s view\u2014but you do agree on one thing: These family members mean to attend the funeral.\n\nThe question is, why? You don\u2019t say what these relationships are like now\u2014whether your wife is on speaking terms with these relatives; whether they know about her prognosis; whether they\u2019ve shown any concern for her; whether, perhaps, you\u2019ve kept your wife\u2019s condition from them so they haven\u2019t had an opportunity to share their concern. Nor do you say how your wife was mistreated growing up, or whether her mom has acknowledged the extent of the mistreatment. Maybe your wife spoke with her mom about her wishes because she\u2019s no longer in contact with these relatives, but by not communicating with them directly, she puts herself in a position of powerlessness, which may be how she felt growing up and again during the divorce.\n\nBanning people from a funeral is both a personal request and a strong public statement. At least in part, it\u2019s a declaration to all who attend that these people hurt your wife deeply, and in this way, her pain would finally be acknowledged. This is what her wish is fundamentally about: a way for her to deal with the pain of the past.\n\nQuite clearly, though, there\u2019s a catch. If banning them from the funeral represents a final, public acknowledgment of her pain, the one person who needs that acknowledgment most won\u2019t be alive to see it. So maybe it\u2019s worth considering what might bring your wife even more peace than their absence at her funeral: the opportunity to be heard by them now. In my therapy practice, I\u2019ve seen people with terminal illnesses spend the time they have left in different ways. Some people don\u2019t change much\u2014they hold on to their anger and resentments and die with them firmly in place. Others step far outside their comfort zone and grow tremendously in ways that feel immensely gratifying.", "description": "I want to respect my wife\u2019s wishes, but am not sure that her excluded family members will.", "authors": ["Lori Gottlieb"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/Funeral_final/facebook.jpg?1570414178", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
