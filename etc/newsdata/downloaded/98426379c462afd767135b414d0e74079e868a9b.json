In August, a picture in the same collection, Orpheus Enchanting the Animals, was upgraded from coming from a little-known Titian follower, Alessandro Varotari, to Titian\u2019s workshop.\n\nYesterday Hope, the former director of the Warburg Institute, a research centre associated with London University, challenged The Dana\u00eb\u2019s attribution, suggesting that it was by a north European follower of Titian rather than an Italian artist. He argued that the \u201cmuch more beautiful\u201d version in the Prado, Madrid, is the original Titian sent to Philip II of Spain, his greatest patron, for whom he painted an epic series of large-scale mythological paintings.\n\nHowever, another leading expert, Professor Paul Joannides, who believes the Apsley House picture is the version painted for the king, maintains that the radically free handling of the Prado Dana\u00eb resembles nothing else by Titian around 1550.\n\nBut comparisons with works of that date cannot be made as so little has survived, Hope said. \u201cThe one thing everybody agrees on is that the Prado picture is much more beautiful than any other [version]. So why didn\u2019t Titian send the most beautiful one to Philip? Why does he do a less good picture for the king?\u201d\n\nFour years ago Hope\u2019s doubts appeared in the scholarly Burlington Magazine, but he has spoken out now because the Apsley House painting \u2013 rather than the Prado version \u2013 will be included in next year\u2019s touring exhibition. Hope said: \u201cThe one that\u2019s now in the Prado, which everybody for the last four centuries believed is the real Titian, is the real Titian and the picture [he painted] for Philip II. The Apsley House one is a sub-Titian. It isn\u2019t the picture for Philip II.\u201d\n\nNoting the Apsley House picture\u2019s weaknesses, he said: \u201cThe most obvious one is the Disney caricature of an old woman. It doesn\u2019t look like Titian\u2019s old women at all.\u201d He also criticised the brushwork as \u201cinferior\u201d.\n\nHe pointed to a contemporary description of The Dana\u00eb at the Alc\u00e1zar in 1626, when only one picture of this subject attributed to Titian was in the Spanish royal collection. That account referred to \u201cgold coins gushing down \u2026 in the form of rain. The Prado picture includes golden rain in the form of coins, while the Apsley House picture consists only of golden raindrops\u201d.\n\nJoannides could not be reached yesterday but, in a subsequent Burlington article, he and Miguel Falomir, director of the Prado, argued that many of those raindrops are large enough to have been remembered by that contemporary as coins. They concluded that, although the Apsley House Dana\u00eb had been ignored or dismissed by scholars until recently, a 2013 restoration revealed that its \u201ctechnique and handling were wholly compatible with Titian\u2019s work c.1550 and not with that of a later pastiche\u201d.", "description": "Top art historians clash over authenticity of Apsley House treasure", "authors": ["Dalya Alberge"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b97a34783234222d5cd02daafb3971199675c79b/0_0_2637_1552/master/2637.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c8d2318460e863c25514c98fc0bc4592", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
