Since the government began recording such murders in 2003, 1,017 women have been killed by their current or former partners.\n\nThe demonstrations come three years after the notorious gang-rape of a woman at the running of the bulls festival in Pamplona and amid the trial of seven men accused of raping a 14-year-old girl in Catalonia.\n\n\u201cThis has been a summer dominated by barbarity, murders, rapes, assault, paedophilia and gang attacks,\u201d said the protests\u2019 organisers, Feminist Emergency.\n\n\u201cThe gender-based violence of the summer has led to the worst figures in more than a decade. We can\u2019t let another school or parliamentary term begin as if nothing has happened. To do so would be to tolerate the intolerable \u2026 This is an emergency.\u201d\n\nThe organisers are urging people to assemble with candles, lanterns, torches and mobile phones to let \u201cfeminism fill the night\u201d.\n\nThe Pamplona attack \u2013 known as the \u201cwolf pack\u201d case after the name the rapists gave themselves \u2013 shocked Spain and provoked a fierce debate over the country\u2019s sexual offences legislation.\n\nThere were furious protests around the country after the judges presiding over the original trial cleared the five of gang-rape and convicted them only of the lesser charge of sexual abuse.\n\nIn June, Spain\u2019s supreme court overturned the regional court\u2019s verdict, ruled that the men had committed rape, and raised their sentences from nine to 15 years each.\n\nParallels have been drawn between that case and the trial of the six men who are alleged to have raped the 14-year-old girl in the Catalan town of Manresa.\n\nWhile prosecutors had initially argued the defendants should face charges of sexual assault rather than rape because the girl was drunk, under the influence of drugs and did not fight back, they upgraded the charges to rape on Monday.\n\nDespite the outcry and anger provoked by such cases, Spain\u2019s far-right Vox party has called for the repeal of domestic violence laws and attacked \u201cpsychopathic feminazis\u201d.\n\nOn Thursday, the party boycotted the minute\u2019s silence that Madrid city council had called to mark the murder of the latest victim of domestic violence, Adaliz Villagra.\n\nVillagra, 31, was stabbed to death in front of her two children in the capital on Tuesday.\n\nVox\u2019s decision to boycott the event and instead turn up with a sign reading: \u201cViolence has no gender\u201d prompted a public row between Madrid\u2019s conservative mayor, Jos\u00e9 Luis Mart\u00ednez-Almeida, and Javier Ortega Smith, Vox\u2019s general secretary.", "description": "\u2018Feminist emergency\u2019 demonstrations follow series of high-profile rape cases", "authors": ["Sam Jones", "Victoria Rosell", "Cathy Camera"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1940fd68047df9011c4a3a58557291aafa1c5f6/0_1002_2024_1215/master/2024.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b0735d90c5bc69dfc8475616364e3ebb", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
