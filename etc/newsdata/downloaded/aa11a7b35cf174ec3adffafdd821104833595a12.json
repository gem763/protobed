That number has been roughly the same since 2013, according to a new study from the Brookings Institution.\n\nAs the chart below shows, the share of minorities has increased only slightly, to 25% in 2018 from 22% five years prior.\n\nBrookings Institution\n\nThat stands in stark contrast to other areas of the federal government. The report shows that the share of women and minorities employed by non-Fed entities has grown each year since 2010. The share of women grew to 33% in 2018 from 27% in 2010, and the share of minorities went to 24% from 18% over the same timeframe.\n\nBrookings Institution\n\nThe data illuminates an issue within economics that's gaining increasing attention.

One is making sure that more diverse candidates study economics at the undergraduate level.
