Trump said emphatically: \"I didn't do it.\" (Sept. 23) AP, AP\n\nJoe Biden's campaign team on Monday accused President Trump and his allies of peddling \u201croundly debunked conspiracy theory\u201d about the former vice president and his son's dealings in the Ukraine.\n\nThe campaign also called on the media to focus on whether Trump abused his authority by allegedly pressuring a foreign leader to dig up dirt on the former vice president and his son.\n\nAndrew Bates, a Biden campaign spokesman, said some in the media \u201chave allowed the most dishonest president in American history to function as their assignment editor\" in the aftermath of reports that Trump pressured Ukraine's president to investigate the former vice president's son Hunter Biden.\n\n\u201cQuality reporting on this issue has made it increasingly clear that Trump did indeed attempt to bully a U.S. ally into disingenuously investigating the potential Democratic nominee he fears most,\u201d Bates said in an email to reporters. \u201cThe second narrative that needs to be pointed out is that, unfortunately, not all coverage of this episode has responsibly highlighted the relevant facts that have been widely reported for months.\u201d\n\nThe Biden campaign raised its concerns as Trump insisted on Monday that he \u201cput no pressure on them whatsoever\u201d to investigate Hunter Biden. The Wall Street Journal has reported that Trump asked Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky eight times in that call to investigate the younger Biden. Trump has acknowledged that he brought up Biden in the July phone conversation with the newly-elected Zelensky that Trump says served as a mostly congratulatory call.\n\nTrump told reporters Monday while at the meeting of the United Nations General Assembly that \u201cwhat Biden did was wrong\u201d and suggested that he might eventually release a transcript of the call \u2014 something that the former vice president and Democratic lawmakers are demanding.\n\nTrump said a transcript would show that he did nothing wrong, but he also said he is concerned about the precedent of releasing details of a call with a foreign leader.\n\nTrump on alleged Ukraine pressure: 'I didn't do it.' Trump denies he threatened to hold back Ukraine's foreign aid over Biden\n\nUkraine scandal explained: What's going on with Trump and Ukraine? And how does it involve Biden and a whistleblower complaint?\n\nThe back-and-forth comes as scrutiny of Trump\u2019s actions during the call is mounting amid renewed calls among House Democrats to impeach Trump.\n\nThe issue came to a head after a multiple news reports about a whistleblower complaint brought by a member of the intelligence community raised concerns about Trump\u2019s comments to a foreign leader. The whistleblower complaint remains secret, and Democrats and the Trump administration are in a standoff over demands that the report be turned over to Congress.\n\nTrump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani for months have pushed uncorroborated claims that Biden as vice president sought the 2016 ouster of Ukraine\u2019s then-prosecutor general Viktor Shokin to stop an investigation into Burisma Group, a Ukrainian energy company where Hunter Biden served on the board of directors.\n\nGiuliani alleged in an interview on Fox News Sunday that Biden pressured Ukraine to fire Shokin, because \u201cBiden knew that they were zeroing in on Hunter and he went over there and got [Shokin] fired.\u201d\n\nThe push by the former vice president, however, came alongside calls for Ukraine to get rid of Shokin from both European diplomats and the U.S State Department, because international leaders felt Shokin was doing too little to fight corruption in the Eastern European country.\n\nThe New York Times reported in May that Biden, while still serving as vice president , threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees unless Ukraine reduced its corruption. Part of that demand called for removing the country's top prosecutor, Shokin, who was investigating the oligarch behind Burisma.\n\nShokin was accused by U.S. officials of ignoring corruption in his own office. The Ukrainian Parliament eventually voted him out.\n\nBut Yuriy Lutsenko, Ukraine's current prosecutor, told Bloomberg News Service in May that he had no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son.\n\nThe Biden campaign says that Trump his allies are trying to muddy the waters about the former vice president's actions in Ukraine because they see Biden as the most potent potential 2020 Democratic rival.\n\n\u201cThe president and his lackeys are so terrified of that prospect \u2014 and have abandoned any pretense of having an iota of truth on their side as they flail and try to distract from what may be the greatest presidential malfeasance since Watergate \u2014 that they fell all over themselves lying on the Sunday shows,\u201d Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager Kate Beddingfield said in a memo to interested parties that was titled \u201cCorrecting the Record on Rudy Giuliani's Lies.\u201d\n\nBiden told reporters while campaigning in Iowa on Saturday that he has never spoken to Hunter Biden about his overseas business dealings, but the younger Biden told the New Yorker magazine in an article published in July that two had one brief exchange about Burisma around December 2015.\n\nAround the time of the conversation, Biden was preparing for a trip to the Ukraine and the Obama administration special envoy had raised the issue of Hunter's work with Burisma with the Vice President, according to the article.\n\n\u201c\u2018Dad said, \u2018I hope you know what you\u2019re doing,\u201d and I said, \u2018I do,\u2019 \u201d the younger Biden is quoted as saying in the article.\n\nContributing: Bart Jansen\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/09/23/biden-campaign-media-should-focus-trump-ukraine-call-not-hunter-biden/2423606001/", "description": "A Biden campaign spokesman said some in the media \u201chave allowed the most dishonest president in American history to function as their assignment editor.\"", "authors": ["Aamer Madhani", "John Fritze", "Published P.M.
