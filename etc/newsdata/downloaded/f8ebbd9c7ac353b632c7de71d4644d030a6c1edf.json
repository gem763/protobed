'It started off as just a BBQ in the garden for a handful of staff to say thank you for all their hard work (pictured)\n\nMr Hays revealed his company's humble beginnings today, revealing that it started out as a one-off store at the back of his mother's childrenswear shop, Peggy's, in County Durham, in 1980\n\n'We've been holding staff garden parties for more than 30 years now,' he said. 'It started off as just a BBQ in the garden for a handful of staff to say thank you for all their hard work.\n\n'This year I still wanted to say thank you, but it was a slightly bigger affair, with nearly 600 people partying the afternoon away. I absolutely love seeing everyone enjoying themselves.'\n\nAdding: 'I felt particularly emotional when the band surprised me with a rendition of one of my favourite songs \u2013 Wonderwall by Oasis \u2013 to celebrate my 70th birthday that's coming up,' he said.\n\nJoanne Tully (left) and Joanne Leightley (right) are among the staff who have been saved by Hays. They are here pictured with the firm's founder and managing directer, John Hays, and Irene Hay (second from right) who chairs Hays Travel Group\n\n'It was wonderful looking out seeing all the amazing people who I work with singing and swaying along. I feel very lucky and very proud.'\n\nSunderland-based Hays Travel has already employed 421 members of Thomas Cook staff since the travel group went out of business last month.\n\nThe company, which is the UK's largest independent travel group, now intends to reopen the shops immediately, potentially saving up to 2,500 further jobs.\n\nAbout 21,000 Thomas Cook staff globally lost their jobs when the company went under, including 9,000 in the UK.\n\nTravel consultants Joanne Tully, 30, and Joanne Leightley, 52, were left heartbroken when the historic travel firm collapsed last month, leaving them without jobs.\n\nPictured: A woman walks past a closed Thomas Cook in Greater Manchester following the firm's collapse\n\nHowever they have now been told that the branches which they worked at in Northumberland will re-open to the public after being bought by Hays Travel.\n\nThe pair will continue to work in their beloved stores after being taken on by the company and have been undergoing training at their head office in Sunderland.\n\nJoanne Tully worked at the Thomas Cook branch in Berwick-upon-Tweed, Northumberland, for 12 years.\n\nThe mother of three-year-old twins, said: 'When Thomas Cook ceased trading it felt like there was a sense of loss. We were almost grieving\n\n'The news that Hays were reopening the Thomas Cook shops was unreal. It's a massive relief.\n\nA woman walks past the branch of Thomas Cook in London's Wimbledon on September 23\n\n'I was looking on Indeed for jobs when someone from Hays got in touch with our old store manager and said they want the whole team here.\n\n'That whole two week period changed from an absolute nightmare into a dream because of Hays.'\n\nJoanne Leightley worked in the Thomas Cook branch in Alnwick, Northumberland, for 35 years.\n\nThe mother of two said her store were left devastated when their employer ceased trading.\n\nMs Leightley said: 'It's gone from a nightmare to a dream come true. We had such lovely, loyal clients and you feel like you have let them down. All the support that we have had has been unbelievable. We are so grateful.'\n\nJohn Hays, managing director of Hays Travel, said many staff cried when offered new jobs, according to ITV News.\n\n'This represents an important step in the liquidation process, as we seek to realise the company's assets,' said David Chapman, the official receiver of Thomas Cook.\n\nThe deal will boost the high street presence of Hays, and comes after all Thomas Cook passengers who were stuck abroad have now been returned to the UK.\n\nThe Thomas Cook brand will disappear from the high street, after Hays Travel said it did not buy the rights to the name and would change them to its own branding.\n\nFormer Thomas Cook cabin crew protesting outside the Manchester Convention Centre at the Conservative Party Conference on September 30\n\nMr Hays said a 'good percentage' of the shops will be open and trading tomorrow, adding: 'We will need to talk to the landlords, which we've started already. We're expecting very positive outcomes.'\n\nMr Hays and Irene Hays, group chair of Hays Travel, said: 'Thomas Cook was a much-loved brand employing talented people. We look forward to working with many of them.\n\n'The agreement will see Hays Travel acquire a total of 555 stores around the UK, providing re-employment opportunities for a significant number of former employees of Thomas Cook's retail operations who were made redundant.'\n\n'This is an extremely positive outcome, and we are delighted to have secured this agreement,' said Jim Tucker, a KPMG partner who was appointed joint special manager of Thomas Cook's retail division after the failure.\n\nPeople stand outside the Peterborough headquarters of Thomas Cook on September 23\n\n'It provides re-employment opportunities for a significant number of former Thomas Cook employees, and secures the future of retail sites up and down the UK high street.'\n\nMr Tucker said the administrators would work with Hays to 'ensure a smooth transition of the store estate'.\n\nHe added: 'We are pleased to have achieved this in a short timeframe and in the context of a complex liquidation process, which is testament to a lot of hard work from a number of parties.'\n\nThomas Cook collapsed last month, stranding hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers and sparking the largest peacetime repatriation effort in UK history.\n\nPeople who booked with with Thomas Cook arrive back at Gatwick Airport on September 23\n\nIn total, around 600,000 customers were left stranded following the collapse of the 178 year-old company less than three weeks ago.\n\nThis included around 140,000 who had been due to return to Germany. The company's demise sparked 22,000 job losses worldwide.\n\nBusiness Secretary Andrea Leadsom said the collapse of Thomas Cook had been 'hugely distressing' for staff and travellers.\n\n'I welcome the news that Hays Travel will be purchasing Thomas Cook's real estate, and hope this will provide significant re-employment opportunities for former Thomas Cook employees, alongside the advice and support we will continue to provide to help people find a new job as quickly as possible,' she said.\n\nHays was founded in County Durham 40 years ago and reached \u00a31 billion in sales last year. It has 190 shops and 1,900 employees.\n\nManuel Cortes, general secretary of the TSSA union which represents Thomas Cook's store workers, said he was seeking an urgent meeting with Hays to figure out how the union can help with the 'significant expansion'.\n\n'Throughout the industry, the talent, commitment and skills of our members working for Thomas Cook was well-known and I have no doubt they will bring the same dedication to Hays,' he said.\n\nJulie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said: 'The move by Hays Travel to buy these stores shows that the company is taking its opportunity to expand and fill the void that has been left by the downfall of Thomas Cook.\n\n'Hays Travel has made a sensible decision to wait and deal with the administrators to get a best price for these stores, while other companies in the past have seen an opportunity in soaking up the entire 178 year old Thomas Cook brand to revive it.\n\n'Hays Travel has built a strong brand itself and is in a good position for expansion \u2013 even if it is in extraordinarily quick fashion.\n\n'With the deal it has struck it has the advantage of still being able to re-negotiate rents with landlords and having a ready-made set of expert staff ready to go.'\n\nMeanwhile it has emerged that cyber-criminals have repeatedly attacked a Civil Aviation Authority website set up to refund Thomas Cook customers.\n\nCrooks are also trying to trick victims into giving personal details. The CAA must now refund 360,000 bookings for trips that were to be taken by 800,000 people.\n\nAround 100,000 applications have so far been made on the website.
