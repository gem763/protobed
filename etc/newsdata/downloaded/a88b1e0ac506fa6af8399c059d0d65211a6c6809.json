IBM Earnings Beat, Revenue Misses In Q3 Investing.com - IBM (NYSE: ) reported third-quarter that beat analysts' expectations on Wednesday, but revenue that fell short of forecasts. The company reported earnings per share of $2.68 on revenue of $18.03 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com forecast EPS of $2.67 on revenue of $18.23 billion. That compared to EPS of $3.42 on revenue of $18.76 billion in the same period a year earlier. Profit was helped by IBM's high-margin cloud computing business. IBM (NYSE: ) shares lost 2.53% to trade at $138.45 postmarket. The Armonk, New York-based technology services giant, which wrapped up the mega cloud merger with Linux maker Red Hat Inc (NYSE: ) earlier this year, has faced years of revenue declines in the process of shifting focus to the cloud from traditional business. Ginni Rometty, IBM (NYSE: ) chief executive for more than seven years, has been able to steer the company towards fast-growing cloud-computing business and lower its dependence on its traditional hardware products, but not without a bumpy journey. The newer areas of focus have sometimes underwhelmed investors. IBM's global technology services segment, the company's biggest, reported $6.70 billion in revenue, down 5.6% from a year earlier. -- Reuters contributed to this report.\n\nIBM Earnings Beat, Revenue Misses in Q3", "description": "IBM Earnings Beat, Revenue Misses in Q3", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEA6H08Q_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
