(Chris Wattie/Reuters)\n\nIn February, Wilson-Raybould testified before the Commons justice committee that the Prime Minister's Office tried to pressure her \u2014 while she was justice minister and attorney general \u2014 to spare Quebec engineering firm SNC-Lavalin a criminal prosecution on fraud and corruption charges, but she refused.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau denied the claim and eventually expelled Wilson-Raybould from caucus, saying her criticism of the government had cost her the confidence of fellow MPs.\n\nIn August, Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion found that Trudeau had violated the Conflict of Interest Act by trying to influence Wilson-Raybould, directly or through others under his direction. Trudeau accepted responsibility for the report's findings, but did not apologize.\n\nWatch as Wilson-Raybould testifies before the Commons justice committee about how she was under pressure to help SNC-Lavalin\n\n\"I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the gov't to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion...\" 1:08\n\n\"I still wish that the prime minister would have acknowledged that something went seriously wrong and took action to ensure that it never happens again,\" Wilson-Raybould told Lynch.\n\nShe was one of several star candidates recruited by Trudeau for the 2015 election, and given high-profile cabinet posts when the Liberals took power.\n\nCanada Votes | Vote Compass: Compare your views to the party platform\n\n\"I ultimately agreed to run as a member of Parliament because I saw that we had shared the same vision for the country, and valued the same principles of equality and inclusion, and advancing social justice issues,\" she said.\n\nBut, she continued, \"I'm not one to talk about my personal relationship with the leader of the Liberal Party. I think that is a story that I will tell on another day.\"\n\nLiberal Leader Justin Trudeau with Wilson-Raybould during a swearing-in ceremony at Rideau Hall in Ottawa on Nov. 4, 2015. (Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press)\n\nWilson-Raybould said voters have not brought up the SNC-Lavalin affair directly during her canvassing, but she is having discussions \"about the nature of our democracy ... and having politicians that will stand up for what is right.\"\n\nShe says Canadian politics \"has gotten to the place where people's voices are being overpowered by the dictates and the confines of parties.\"\n\n\"Members of Parliament are answerable to their leader or to the prime minister, and in that case, to unelected people that exist within the Prime Minister's Office,\" she said.\n\nCanada Votes | The 60 ridings that tell the story of where the election will be won and lost\n\n\"I believe the prime minister and leaders should be answerable to members of Parliament, who are in turn answerable to constituents \u2014 that's the way that representative democracy should work.\"\n\nOttawa can learn from Indigenous politics\n\nOn Friday, Wilson-Raybould released a collection of speeches and other writings on reconciliation, From Where I Stand: Rebuilding Indigenous Nations for a Stronger Canada.\n\nShe argued that Canada needs to recognize the rights of Indigenous communities, and enable them to \"rebuild their institutions of government, to determine who their citizens are, how they elect their governing body, and put in place their constitutions, if they so choose.\"\n\nShe said these bodies need to develop in partnership with federal and provincial governments \u2014 and that Ottawa could learn a lot from them.\n\n\"I come from an Indigenous background where we value collaboration and consensus-based decision-making,\" she said, before acknowledging that the way federal politics works in Ottawa is not going to change overnight.\n\n\"But I think that there can be lessons learned from my culture and its governing systems that have survived for millennia.\"\n\nWritten by Padraig Moran, with files from CBC News.
