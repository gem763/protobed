Compared with a year ago, contract signings were up 2.5%.\n\nThe index captures transactions where a contract has been signed, but the home sale has not yet closed.\n\nWhat happened: This is only the third month this year in which contract signings have risen, and pending home sales increased across all regions nationwide.\n\nThe highest gain occurred in the West, where the pending home sales index rose 3.1% from July. Contract signings also increased 0.7% in the Northeast, 0.6% in the Midwest and 1.4% in the South.\n\n\u201cThe notable sales slump in the West region over recent years appears to be over,\u201d Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, said in the report. \u201cRising demand will reaccelerate home price appreciation in the absence of more supply.\u201d\n\nRead more: There are precious few places in America where the average worker can afford a median-priced home\n\nBig picture: The capping of state and local tax deductions significantly disrupted housing markets in high-tax parts of the country. As people have acclimated to the new normal where taxes are concerned, this headwind has diminished.\n\nMore recently, the decline in mortgage rates has begun to lift sales activity nationally. At first the lower interest rates appeared to be merely driving more interest in mortgage refinancing. However, August saw upticks in existing and new home sales and in homebuilding activity.\n\nWhat they\u2019re saying? \u201cThe surge in mortgage applications in both August and September points to new cycle highs for sales around the turn of the year,\u201d Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a research note. \u201cSales could well dip a bit over the next month or two, having overshot relative to mortgage applications for the past three months, but the trend is rising.\u201d\n\nMarket reaction: The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.18% and the S&P 500 SPX, -0.27% moved lower in morning trades, as investors examined the whistleblower complaint released Thursday regarding President Trump\u2019s interactions with the president of Ukraine.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury note\u2019s yield TMUBMUSD10Y, -2.15% also dropped Thursday on the heels of the latest U.S. GDP figures, which indicated that slower economic growth could persist.", "description": "It\u2019s yet another sign that low mortgage rates have buoyed the housing market.", "authors": ["Jacob Passy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS108_contra_ZG_20190926093836.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
