Under that deal, StarHub picked up 65% of the company at the time, with the remaining 35% to be gained from D'Crypt founders Dr Antony Ng, Chew Hwee Boon, and Dr Pang Liang Teck in the first half of 2021.\n\nWhile Singapore is shifting from cable to fibre, Australia's National Broadband Network (NBN) is continuing to test increased speeds on the technology.\n\nIn July, NBN conducted a DOCSIS 3.1 test on a customer's hybrid fibre-coaxial (HFC) line at Templestowe, Victoria that clocked in at 994Mbps. The trial made use of more spectrum than most HFC lines do currently, thanks to a better bandpass filter.\n\n\"This is an important day for NBN. It shows how a specific technology -- HFC -- is evolving to meet customer demand for greater capacity from their broadband connection over time,\" NBN chief technology officer Ray Owen said at the time.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nTemasek picks up D'Crypt from StarHub\n\nTransaction expected to close in November, with an initial cash payment of SG$100 million.\n\nStarHub second quarter sees net profit drop over a third\n\nLower Pay TV and mobile revenue sees Singaporean telco head downwards.\n\nSingaporean iPhone 11, 11 Pro, and 11 Pro Max pricing\n\nPre-orders to open at the Apple website starting on September 13.\n\nEnterprise and cyber make up for StarHub first quarter declines in mobile and pay TV\n\nOverall revenue was up, but so were overall expenses for the Singaporean telco.\n\nSingapore turns on data channel linking Chongqing industrial parks\n\nAvailable to companies across seven industrial parks in the southwestern city of China, the dedicated data link has a total capacity of 260Gbps and is part of efforts to support connectivity between businesses in the region.", "description": "Hundreds of thousands of customers move to better technology in island state.", "authors": ["Chris Duckett"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/01/d5cc5c22-3d33-42de-87ca-64521ddbbd4d/thumbnail/770x578/5ba79981ccb212591a1536e73f3a090f/singapore-2019-gp.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
