There is little risk to sales or profits from offending U.S. leaders or the American people by kowtowing to Chinese pressure.\n\n\u201cThe price you pay for backing down to China is a week of Twitter opprobrium,\u201d Jude Blanchette, the CSIS Freeman Chair in China Studies said in an interview on CNBC Tuesday. \u201cWhereas the price you pay in China is the loss of market access.\u201d\n\nThe NBA furor began when Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted his support for Hong Kong\u2019s protesters.\n\nThat\u2019s hardly a controversial position in the U.S., where there is widespread sympathy for the protesters who often wave U.S. flags and say they are inspired by America\u2019s tradition of liberty, but it is beyond the pale for China\u2019s leaders. Although Twitter is blocked in China, Morey\u2019s message \u2014 and the Chinese regime\u2019s disapproval \u2014 was echoed through official and unofficial channels over the weekend. The tweet was swiftly deleted, and the NBA expressed sorrow for the offending words.\n\nThat is now a familiar pattern. Companies as diverse as Marriot, Delta, United, Apple, Coach, Tiffany, Vans, and Activision/Blizzard have all apologized or changed politics or products when confronted by China. Hollywood explicitly caters its films to the Chinese markets, careful not to offend the sensibilities of China\u2019s nationalists and ruling elite. Often outspoken leaders of big American banks, like J.P. Morgan Chase\u2019s Jamie Dimon or former Goldman Sachs chief Lloyd Blankfein, fall silent when it comes to China\u2019s human rights abuses, growing totalitarianism, and even trade abuses.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see why the NBA does not want to get shut out of China. Last year, 490 million people watched online NBA broadcasts in China, the Wall Street Journal reported. And with 1.4 billion people, China is perhaps the biggest potential growth market for the league.\n\nThat too is familiar. U.S. companies have long viewed China\u2019s enormous population, growing economy, and rising middle class as an irresistible opportunity. Even when they are forced to surrender half of their profits to free-riding Chinese \u201cpartners,\u201d few have been willing to forego the lure of access to China\u2019s consumers.\n\nThat has largely been a reflection of U.S. policy toward China. The U.S. has encouraged further entanglement with China. One administration after the other, Democrat and Republican, encouraged further economic engagement and discouraged conflict. Even as the costs to the U.S. in terms of lost jobs were far worse than expected and the benefits of what was once viewed as the inevitable Chinese liberalization proved illusory, the policy was largely unwavering. This both served the interests of corporate America, at least in the short-term, and conditioned corporate America to accept China\u2019s demands upon them.\n\nThe corner offices in America\u2019s corporate headquarters are now populated by executives who rose through this systemic bias in favor of China engagement. Companies and executives who might have resisted China\u2019s increasingly stringent policing of criticism from around the globe were shunted aside. Betting on China was just how you won in corporate America for the last few decades.\n\nNow that might be changing. President Donald Trump has taken aim at China\u2019s trade practices and economic predation with his tariffs. Capitol Hill lawmakers such as Marco Rubio have challenged China\u2019s plans for dominance in technology. Democratic hopeful Elizabeth Warren has been severely critical of China on human rights and workers\u2019 rights.\n\nThe backlash against the NBA\u2019s kowtow illustrates this. It has come from all over the political spectrum.\n\nThis is bigger than just the @NBA. It\u2019s about #China\u2019s growing ability to restrict freedom of expression here in the U.S. TV networks,airlines,hotel chains,retailers & Hollywood already self censor. Now private citizens risk losing their jobs if they offend China. https://t.co/DQOFdBkb1e \u2014 Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) October 7, 2019\n\nChina is trying to use its market power to silence free speech and criticism of its conduct. In response, the NBA chose its pocketbook over its principles\u2014and our values. We should all be speaking out in support of those protesting for their rights. https://t.co/IRiIY1cgDg \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 7, 2019\n\nWall Street Journal columnist Michael Bird is hopeful this could prompt a change in corporate America:\n\nBut firms will need to be more careful in the future. The NBA is discovering that groveling to Beijing is no longer a one-way street, as American politicians weighed in supporting Mr. Morey. The company\u2019s strong brand in the U.S. could be tarnished if its executives are seen to be in the pocket of an autocratic government. Broad bipartisan support for Hong Kong protesters places businesses in political crosshairs they\u2019d rather avoid.\n\nAnd yet it might not amount to much \u2014 at least not without a policy follow-up.\n\nAs Blanchette points out, China still has the ability to punish U.S. companies that do no suppress speech critical of China. While the cost of kowtowing is simply a public relations embarrassment that is likely to pass. No one thinks Americans will quit watching professional basketball because the league was too cozy with China\u2019s leadership.\n\nIn fact, even as the backlash mounted in the U.S., China kept up the pressure. State broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV) on Tuesday issued a statement on the social media platform Weibo noting its \u201cstrong dissatisfaction and opposition\u201d to comments made by the NBA commissioner Adam Silver, who had held a press conference in which he walked back the league\u2019s kowtow and defended Morey\u2019s freedom to express his opinion.\n\n\u201cWe believe that any speech challenging a country\u2019s national sovereignty and social stability is not within the scope of freedom of speech,\u201d CCTV said.\n\nChina has a policy of defending its reputation against criticism that can hurt the profits of U.S. businesses that defy it. The U.S. has politicians saying critical things \u2014 a kind of virtue signaling \u2014 on Twitter.\n\nCare to guess which is more effective?", "description": "The firestorm that followed the NBA kowtowing to China may not change the way U.S. businesses respond to pressure from the Chinese regime.", "authors": ["John Carney"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-73390056-e1570563850895-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
