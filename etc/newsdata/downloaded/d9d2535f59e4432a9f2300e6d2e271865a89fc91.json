The multi-year contract includes all front-wheel drive dual-clutch transmissions, including hybrid transmission variants.\n\n\u201cThis new award is another result of Magna\u2019s commitment to delivering high-quality, flexible and innovative transmissions,\u201d said Tom Rucker, President of Magna Powertrain. \u201cOur scalable dual-clutch transmissions enhance drivability while simultaneously providing optimal levels of efficiency, which makes our product a perfect match for BMW.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe transmission technologies will be used in more than 170 different vehicle applications. The new hybrid solution by Magna has no impact on the overall package size of the transmission, which provides manufacturing flexibility to BMW. The hybrid variants also use a compact, 48V high-RPM electric motor within the transmission housing, providing innovative driving features while further improving fuel efficiency.\n\nThe transmissions will be built at Magna facilities in Neuenstein, Germany, and Kechnec, Slovakia.\n\nINVESTOR CONTACT\n\nLouis Tonelli, Vice-President, Investor Relations\n\nlouis.tonelli@magna.com , (+1) 905.726.7035\n\nMEDIA CONTACTS\n\nTracy Fuerst, Global Director of Corporate Communications & PR\n\ntracy.fuerst@magna.com , (+1) 248.631.5396\n\nRej Husetovic, Director Corporate Communications & Media Relations Europe\n\nrej.husetovic@magna.com , (+49) 6093 9942-5056\n\nABOUT MAGNA\n\nWe are a mobility technology company.
