That absence looked set to increase with Jones prepared to leave them out of the matchday squad for Saturday\u2019s clash with the Pumas, but their performances in training proved enough to force Jones into a U-turn.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

We had 31 players competing hard for places. We had an outstanding training run yesterday and we've got eight disappointed players but they understand they have a massive role to play in supporting the team.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Rugby World Cup team of round two 1/15 1, Ellis Genge (England) The loosehead prop may have only come on for England at half-time, but there had not been a run at the World Cup from a prop quite like what Genge produced against the USA. A barn-storming run saw him outpace one defender and trample over another, breaking the best part of 50 metres before it took two men to stop him. He was also excellent in the scrum to win countless penalties as the USA wilted. AP 2/15 2. Julian Montoya (Argentina) It takes something special to shine in Agustin Creevy\u2019s absence, but Montoya delivered with an excellent hat-trick to help lead Argentina to victory over Tonga. Montoya was smart to stay wide following a lineout for his first try, was the beneficiary of the rolling maul for the second and powered his way over from close range for a classy 26-minute hat-trick. AP 3/15 3. Levan Chilachava (Georgia) It\u2019s not often a Georgian makes the team of the round, but Chilachava lead an inspired Georgian pack to dominate Uruguay in their Sunday clash, scoring a try in the bonus-point victory and monstering the opposition front row in the scrum. REUTERS 4/15 4. Luke Thomspon (Japan) A herculean effort from the lock as Japan upset the odds to beat Ireland. Thompson did not miss a single tackle in a standout display with fellow lock James Moore. Getty Images 5/15 5. Lood de Jager (South Africa) The Springbok needed a big performance to strengthen his case for selection in what is a very competitive area for South Africa, and the giant second row delivered emphatically with a man-of-the-match performance. He may not have got on the scoresheet, but his impact in destroying Namibia\u2019s gameplan was standout nonetheless. AP 6/15 6. Aaron Wainwright (Wales) A young player whose development at the World Cup is really turning heads. Wainwright did not look out of place up against one of the greats of the game against David Pocock, and it was his ball-carrying ability that really stood out in an eye-catching performance. Getty Images 7/15 7. Lewis Ludlam (England) A remarkable rise to prominence saw Ludlam score his first World Cup try for England in the demolition of the USA, but it was his all-round performance last week that earns him his place in the side. From nowhere, Ludlam is emerging as a very important member of the England team. AFP/Getty Images 8/15 8. Michael Leitch (Japan) Another substitute who made such a strong contribution to a winning cause. Leitch came on after the half-hour mark to replace Amanaki Mafi and lead by example, setting the tone for Japan\u2019s latest great upset. EPA 9/15 9. Gareth Davies (Wales) Australia could not keep Davies out of the game in Tokyo, with the scrum-half twice intercepting Will Genia and Bernard Foley and nearly bagging himself a third in the second half. He was also excellent at injecting pace into the game and tried to catch the defence napping throughout. Getty Images 10/15 10. Felipe Berchesi (Uruguay) The Uruguayan was excellent in Uruguay\u2019s victory over Fiji, with the South American\u2019s forced to double-up across the round by playing Georgia a handful of days later. Berchesi had to make do with a team on the back foot more often than not, yet managed to release his outside backs to run Fiji ragged. AFP/Getty Images 11/15 11. Makazole Mapimpi (South Africa) Mapimpi emerged from the shadow of Cheslin Kolbe to star in South Africa\u2019s rout of Namibia, scoring two tries to trigger the landslide victory. Mapimpi may not get the shower of praise that his elusive teammate receives, but he showed how dangerous he can be with the ball in hand, showing a devastating turn of pace backed up by some serious power. REUTERS 12/15 12. Ryoto Nakamura (Japan) Going up against the talented duo of Chris Farrell and Garry Ringrose, Nakamura did himself proud with a number of eye-catching tackles and defensive work that any centre would be proud of. He also proved the glue between fly-half Yu Tamura and the dangerous wings outside him. AFP/Getty Images 13/15 13. Lukhanyo Am (South Africa) The third Springbok to feature in the side, Am enjoyed possible his best outing at international level, bagging a try himself on the 57-3 victory immediately after half-time as they picked up where they left off. AP 14/15 14. Kotaro Matsushima (Japan) The only man to retain his spot in the side after yet another strong showing in Shizuoka, Matsushima is establishing himself as one of the must-watch players at the World Cup. One brilliant mazy run in the second half stood out among a lengthy highlight reel. AFP/Getty Images 15/15 15. Telusa Veainu (Tonga) The full-back returned to the Tonga side for the first time in two years and marked his comeback with a brilliant showing, scoring twice in their losing effort against Argentina and producing a sublime finish for his second try after combining with Cooper Vuna.

AP\n\n\u201cConversely, the guys who have been selected need to support those guys. It's a credit to our strength and conditioning staff and medical staff what a great condition we're in. We're six games into our World Cup preparations \u2013 four warm-up games and two World Cup games and we have 31 players to select from.\u201d\n\nJones has decided to restore the bulk of the team that beat Tonga 35-3 in their World Cup opener, with the only change to that line-up being George Kruis\u2019s selection at lock in place of Courtney Lawes, meaning there are nine changes to the side that defeated the USA last time out.\n\nOpposite number Mario Ledesma sprung a surprise with his selection, choosing to leave out 79-cap fly-half Nicolas Sanchez from his squad and leaving 87-cap hooker Agustin Creevy on the bench, with just one change to the side that beat Tonga last weekend with Javier Ortega Desio returning at No 8 meaning that Benjamin Urdapilleta continues at stand-off.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting team, a strong team,\u201d noted Jones. \u201cWe know that Argentina are at their best at World Cups. Creevy spoke of a number things this week, one of which is about how tight they are as a team. They're a pretty good team if they can get Creevy to come off the bench.\n\n\u201cThe stand-off we know pretty well, unfortunately I can't pronounce his name so I'm not going to try! He has been a good performer for Castres for a number of years. He's very solid in terms of his goalkicking and we know that he'll bring something different to the game. We respect them very greatly.\u201d\n\nTeams\n\nEngland: Elliot Daly; Anthony Watson, Manu Tuilagi, Owen Farrell, Jonny May; George Ford, Ben Youngs; Joe Marler, Jamie George, Kyle Sinckler; Maro Itoje, George Kruis; Tom Curry, Sam Underhill, Billy Vunipola.\n\nReplacements: Luke Cowan-Dickie, Mako Vunipola, Dan Cole, Courtney Lawes, Lewis Ludlam, Willi Heinz, Henry Slade, Jack Nowell.\n\nArgentina: Emiliano Boffelli; Matias Moroni, Matias Orlando, Jeronimo de la Fuente, Santigo Carreras; Benjamin Urdapilleta, Tomas Cubelli; Nahuel Tetaz Chaparro, Julian Montoya, Juan Figallo; Guido Petti, Tomas Lavanini; Pablo Matera, Marcos Kremer, Javier Ortega Desio.\n\nReplacements: Agustin Creevy, Mayco Vivas, Santiago Medrano, Matias Alemanno, Tomas Lezana, Felipe Ezcurra, Lucas Mensa, Bautista Delguy.", "description": "Wednesday\u2019s training session proved enough to convince Eddie Jones that Mako Vunipola and Jack Nowell are ready to make their 2019 Rugby World Cup bows against Argentina Rugby, having initially planned to leave them out of the England\u00a0squad for a third match in a row.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/03/07/eddie-jones.jpg"}
