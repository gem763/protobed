Many of those efforts, however, fail to produce results.\n\nTo tackle the challenge, organizations are turning to intrapreneurs, a relatively new role within companies that is responsible for helping to lead and build excitement around innovation projects.\n\nOrganizations should start on their innovation journey by analyzing where they are and the ideal \"future state,\" according to Simone Ahuja, the founder of the advisory firm Blood Orange, which has advised companies like UnitedHealth Group on its own intrapreneurial efforts.\n\nClick here for more BI Prime content.\n\nWhen Procter & Gamble wanted to disrupt the household-insecticide market, it relied on a smaller, more nimble team to develop Zevo, a kid- and pet-friendly product that was initially purchased as a startup by the company in 2017.\n\nIt's a testament to the ability of the Cincinnati-based consumer-goods maker to find new ways to prompt research and development across its 92,000 employees. Zevo, for example, began selling in Target earlier this year. It's also an increasingly common strategy. Legacy companies challenged by a surge of nimble startups are rushing to try to create cultures of innovation internally in hopes it will spur new competitive offerings.\n\nBut among companies that have invested in \"innovation units,\" only 23% say they have yielded a successful product, according to a recent study. That's a whopping 77% fail rate.\n\nHence the need for the \"intrapreneur\" \u2014 a word coined in 1978 but freshly relevant in large companies as they recast themselves as tech firms. The intrapreneur is the visionary, cheerleader, and cross-functional coach who advocates for, and pushes along, innovation efforts. But, as chief technology officers have told us, the very environment of an organization can stymie the innovation that's being sought.\n\nFor many companies, the biggest challenge is figuring out how to begin, according to Simone Ahuja, the founder of the advisory firm Blood Orange and author of the intrapreneurship guidebook \"Disrupt-It-Yourself.\"\n\n\"When I talk to leaders about innovation generally, they are kind of overwhelmed,\" she told Business Insider. \"They don't know what to do; they don't know where to start.\"\n\nAhuja, who advised companies like UnitedHealth Group and Stanley Black & Decker on internal innovation efforts, outlined the four-step checklist organizations should consider when formalizing their own programs.\n\nBe clear on the innovation strategy\n\nA company's innovation strategy should be an overarching set of principles that are used to guide efforts across the organization.\n\nThe first step for executives, according to Ahuja, is figuring out where the company is and the ideal \"future state.\" That can include a move from an environment where leaders don't micromanage to one where they say \"yes\" more often to riskier projects.\n\nFormalizing that process, however, requires buy-in from the top, according to Ahuja. That's why the conversation will typically start with a group of high-level executives. But that doesn't mean completely ignoring the rest of the company.\n\n\"The mandate starts with senior leadership, but immediately we go across the organization to find out how to define this vision for the future,\" Ahuja said.\n\nRead more: The head of IBM's Watson walks us through the exact model tech leaders can use to build excitement around any AI project\n\nAll overarching goals should also include smaller, more specific action items to make execution easier so people don't feel overwhelmed.\n\n\"This is where everybody seems to get stuck. Give them some very, very tangible things that they can dive into. Or better yet, ask them to create it,\" she added.\n\nSay a company wants to make it less risky for employees to pursue projects outside the scope of their daily jobs. One immediate action item could be finding several examples of other organizations that have such a culture and figuring out what makes it succeed.\n\nLaunch an 'intrapreneur-protection program'\n\nOne of the most difficult tasks for companies is figuring out how to incorporate intrapreneurs into the organizational structure.\n\nLegacy firms are typically built on rigid structures to give employees a clear path toward advancement. But if organizations are trying to create a more innovation-driven culture, workers could be spending more time outside their regular job tasks on initiatives that may or may not succeed. Organizations must assure employees that if a project does fail, they won't lose their job.\n\n\"Senior leaders can ask for it, but then the question becomes, 'Why should I take this risk? I'm not being measured for this,'\" Ahuja said. \"It's almost like you need an intrapreneur-protection program.\"\n\nOne way to do that is to tout examples of projects that didn't go to market \u2014 or went to market and failed \u2014 but provided valuable information for future efforts. Another is ensuring that those employees who drift from their daily job tasks are able to reenter the more formal organizational structure when their projects wrap up. That becomes easier as companies promote more of those people to senior management roles.\n\nThe most successful intrapreneurs \"are the ones that had the air cover from leaders who are also kind of intrapreneurial,\" Ahuja said.\n\nCreate the right intrapreneurial team\n\nAnother key question that executives must answer is whether to hire externally to help lead innovation-heavy projects or to appoint someone internally.\n\nFor \"core-innovation\" efforts, or those that don't carry a large amount of risk, Ahuja says internal teams are fine. For initiatives that go beyond the scope of incremental improvements, like the creation of an internal startup accelerator, it's more necessary to bring in outside experts.\n\n\"This is one of the most challenging and artful pieces of innovation because a lot of it is just testing and trying it out,\" Ahuja said.\n\nBut external hires \u2014 even those with a strong track record of success or people who were past leaders at companies viewed as leading the innovation charge, like Google \u2014 still need to be paired with those who intrinsically know the ins and outs of the organization.\n\nCraft clear metrics for success\n\nCompanies should partner clear financial goals with \"softer targets,\" like how many new ideas were generated or whether you figured out if customers were willing to pay for products outside the traditional offerings, Ahuja said.\n\n\"You've got to have some metrics that start to build a culture and the capabilities of intrapreneurship, but eventually you also have to draw a line in the sand and get clear about how long you are willing to experiment on this,\" she said.\n\nAnd evaluations should be done on a continual basis \u2014 as often as once a week \u2014 to figure out whether the project needs to be pivoted or shelved. Along those lines, Ahuja says intrapreneurs should be empowered and rewarded to end initiatives that are failing to produce results.\n\nWhile individual innovation efforts will vary wildly by company, these four steps can serve as the foundation as organizations craft their own modernization journey.", "description": "Companies should first outline their innovation goals and determine how intrapreneurs fit into organizational structures, according to Simone Ahuja.", "authors": ["Joe Williams"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da60c0e4af9097dba76eb66?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
