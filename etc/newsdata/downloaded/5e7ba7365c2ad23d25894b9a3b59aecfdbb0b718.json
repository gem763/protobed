She\u2019s such a good player, two semis in a row. This is the biggest stadium for tennis on the whole planet, and I think of it that way. It\u2019s such an honour for me and my opponent to play here.\u201d\n\nHer 101st win in New York equalled Chris Evert\u2019s US Open record; she also has broken the record held by her sister, Venus, for the biggest gap between first and and most recent appearances in a slam final: 19 years and 362 days.\n\nCuriously, Williams, who has won six titles here, would also become the eighth different slam champion in as many majors \u2013 given she has not won a tournament since becoming a mother in September 2017. That churn at the top is only the fifth time in the Open era there have been four different champions in the same season.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think about the numbers,\u201d she said. \u201cI just come out here and do as well as I can. Been here for 20 years \u2013 and still here.\u201d\n\nBianca Andreescu bears down on big points to reach first US Open final Read more\n\nMartina Navritolova observed of 37-year-old Williams, the oldest slam winner in the Open era, \u201cHer movement here has been fantastic, right on the money. If you let her get set, you\u2019ve got problems. Her distance per point is better than anyone else\u2019s here. But she is more vulnerable at the start of a match.\u201d\n\nNerves and controversy, certainly, have dogged Williams at her home tournament down the years, but, with glaring exceptions, she has mostly prevailed in spite them. It did not happen in 2018 \u2013 but even in that debacle, there was a ticking omen. The only other times she has lost in finals here \u2013 2001, 2011 \u2013 she bounced back to win the following year. And here she is again, teasing history.\n\nSvitolina is no pushover for anyone, as Johanna Konta discovered in a tough loss in the quarters. She lost to the eventual champions in two slams this year: to Osaka in the quarters in Melbourne and to Simona Halep at Wimbledon. Losing to Williams is never a disgrace, however spirit-crushing.\n\nOn Wednesday, there was no sign of her emotions drowning her, as her power and placement overcame the game but outgunned Ukrainian. The power differential was most evident on the serve: Williams averaging 108.9mph, with a fastest of 119mph, Svitolina 100.9mph and 109.9mph\n\nWilliams did not have it all her own way, as she has done in nearly all of her previous five matches where she gave up only one set, to her promising young compatriot, Caty McNally in the second round.\n\nIf Elina Svitolina\u2019s middle name was Serena, she would be the start to a good limerick. But there was no rhyme nor reason to her feeding Williams\u2019 forehand crosscourt return so often \u2013 not that the American\u2019s backhand is a weakness, so maybe the choice of where to test her was academic. If her British coach, Andrew Bettles, were allowed to, he might have had a quite word. Instead, he had to watch from the team box, mute, alongside Svitolina\u2019s partner, Gael Monfils, who looked just about recovered from his epic five-setter the night before.\n\nSvitolina applied enough early pressure to force Williams to fight hard for an opening hold from 15-40, and there was flickering trench warfare to come.\n\nWorking behind a decent first serve but vulnerable on her second hit from the hand, Svitolina had to red-line nearly every time she went to the service line, and she was plunged into a string of deuce points before Williams\u2019 drilled a backhand down the line to lead 2-0 after a quarter of an hour.\n\nA rare serve and volley, her first of the tournament, dug Williams out of a hole in the fifth game and, not without continued serious effort, she steadily dismantled her opponent\u2019s game to take the first set in 41 minutes. - three minutes quicker than her quarter-final win over Qiang Wang who, crazily, failed to hit a single winner two nights previously.\n\nAs Williams grew in confidence, she worked her way steadily inside the court, Svitolina\u2019s serve weakening noticeably in the second set. She dropped serve in the third game and found it impossible to get back into the contest.\n\nWilliams broke again with a couple of outrageous ground strokes for 4-1 after an hour, held to 15, blew her first match point on Svitolina\u2019s serve but wrapped it up after an hour and 10 minutes with a killer backhand down the line three, as a packed Arthur Ashe Stadium rose to acclaim her.\n\nWilliams has had so many wins here \u2013 101, against 12 losses \u2013 she could not recall beforehand that her first was against the Australian Nicole Pratt, in three sets in the first round in 1998. \u201cWow, I do not remember that at all,\u201d she said when reminded of it before the match.\n\nPratt retired 11 years ago at 35 \u2013 which underlines Williams\u2019s longevity. No wonder we take Williams for granted \u2013 which is something Svitolina was never going to do, even though she had little say, ultimately, in the course of the match.\n\nThe Ukrainian said before the match, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who is going to be in the semi-final, but obviously Serena is an amazing champion.\n\nShe surely is.", "description": "The 23-time major champion is back in the US Open final after a one-sided win over Elina Svitolina on Thursday night in New York", "authors": ["Kevin Mitchell"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f3acfc3c76a5b1ab30554572ceac7121b5b7d60/0_289_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e8e8e4ec146397e5ad50fee47f2d2eb5", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
