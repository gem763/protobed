Analysts and investors are encouraging the company to plow ahead on new advertising opportunities in units like video platform YouTube and the ubiquitous Google Maps app. Yet efforts to create new sources of profit across its empire could raise competition concerns with regulators.\n\nGoogle's parent, Alphabet Inc. reported revenue of $40.5 billion, a rise of 20% over the same period last year. While that would be enviable growth for many other companies, the growth is modestly below Google's track record of late.\n\nAlphabet's profit for the third quarter -- $7.1 billion -- was lower than Wall Street's expectations and down 23% from a year earlier, when it was boosted by changes to the U.S. tax code. The company's margin was also crimped as costs rose.\n\nAlphabet stock fell 2% after hours Monday. Shares have gained roughly 25% this year, in line with the broader technology market.\n\nWrite to Rob Copeland at rob.copeland@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 28, 2019 17:09 ET (21:09 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
