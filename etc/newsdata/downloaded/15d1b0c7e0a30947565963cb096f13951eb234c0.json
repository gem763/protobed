The protests could also alienate a public whose votes sway\n\npoliticians making the big calls.\n\nSaving the planet is arguably the most important issue ever, so protesters must be careful to win, not lose, public support.\n\nSave this jewel\n\nWe salute the NHS staff who rebuilt the face of a teenager whose jaw hung by a thread of skin after a riding accident.\n\nMiraculous operations are carried out every day and either we fight to save our most precious public service or one day we\u2019ll find only the rich can afford the finest medical care.", "description": "PM Johnson losing all legitimacy with proposal he cynically designed it to fail from outset", "authors": ["Voice Of The Mirror", "Image", "Wpa Pool", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20539966.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PM-Johnson-Receives-President-Of-The-European-Parliament-David-Sassoli-To-Downing-Street.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
