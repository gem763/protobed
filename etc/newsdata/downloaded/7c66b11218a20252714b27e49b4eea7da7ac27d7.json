I hope... I am going to spend five years more here at least.\n\n\u201cFootball is a game to enjoy and when you don\u2019t win it is difficult to enjoy but you can\u2019t create a drama,\u201d Pochettino added. \u201cAnd we are not going to create a drama.\u201d\n\nThe Argentine acknowledged Tuesday\u2019s defeat was hard to take but he was not unduly worried about his team\u2019s form, even though they have won only two of their last nine games in all competitions and sit sixth in the league, 10 points behind leaders Liverpool.\n\n\u201cWe need to move on and we need to be ready,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cWe need to try to show the best quality and the best performance, the competition doesn\u2019t wait for you.\n\n\u201cYou cannot go home and cry and spend three days closed in your room, you need to move on quick, that is the key. You stay all together. You stick with your ideas and be more stronger than before.\u201d\n\nSpurs have one major doubt at right back with Serge Aurier suspended for the game against Brighton & Hove Albion.\n\nMoussa Sissoko looks likely to replace him for the 1130 GMT kickoff.", "description": "Tottenham Hotspur coach Mauricio Pochettino dismissed any talk about his future at the club on Friday and said he hoped to spend many more years in North London.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1437030760&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF930ZC", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
