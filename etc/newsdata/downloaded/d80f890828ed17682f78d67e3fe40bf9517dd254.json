The Steelers and the Raiders couldn't make it work where his talent outweighed his off-field antics, but if there's one team in the NFL that can, it's New England. The question is, should Brown even get the chance to play this season for the way he's acted?\n\n\"I know coaches want to win but I'm disappointed in Robert Kraft,\" Dungy said. \"I think at some point you say, \u2018Just as an organization, we're not going to do this.'\"\n\nDungy seems convinced the Patriots are setting a bad example choosing talent over everything in this case. Whether he's right or not, winning tends to heal all wounds, and the Patriots sure do know how to do that no matter who's on their roster.\n\nWatch Dungy's full response to the Brown signing below:\n\nStory continues\n\nClick here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!
