It typically releases more than a dozen motion pictures a year. Among the company\u2019s biggest hits are films like \u201cThe Sixth Sense,\u201d \u201cForbidden Kingdom,\u201d \u201cThe Bank Job,\u201d \u201cFarenheit 9/11\u201d and \u201cRambo.\u201d\n\nA few years ago, it bought the TV Guide Network, one of the 25 most widely distributed cable networks. And it produces leading television series including \u201cMad Men,\u201d \u201cWeeds\u201d and \u201cCrash.\u201d\n\nIt also has a high box-office-to-DVD conversion rate and a prolific library of more than 12,000 motion picture and television titles. Yet the company has had a couple of big earnings misses over the last year and its stock is trading at the low end of its range.\n\nThat has attracted some major insider buying recently, including a 2.4 million-share purchase by Chairman Mark Rachesky. (Rachesky is also head of MHR Fund Management, a $6 billion investment firm.) On Oct. 2, Rachesky invested more than $22 million at $9.19 a share. Today, you can buy the stock cheaper than Rachesky did. And you should.\n\nSee also: New Ruling Could Boost Oil Refiners\n\nLionsgate sells for 70% of book value and only 52% of annual sales. And the Wall Street consensus is that earnings are likely to quadruple from $.07 a share this fiscal year to $.28 a share next year.\n\nAnd that consensus may be too conservative. We\u2019ll get a better idea when Lionsgate reports earnings again in four weeks. In the meantime, you\u2019ll collect a dividend yield of 3.8%. And there is plenty of short-term trading potential here.\n\nMore From MoneyShow.com:", "description": "The gyrations on Wall Street have driven short-term traders crazy, but we've done quite well taking a long-term perspective with our high-quality, high-dividend-paying stocks, explains Mark Skousen, dividend expert and editor of High-Income Alert.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
