Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey (at right) hold a news conference for their proposed \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d on Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C., February 7, 2019. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)\n\nIn last week\u2019s sub-par G-File I ended with a riff on socialism and gangsterism. I wrote:\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting to me is how thin the line between this form of politics [gangsterism] and socialism (or fascism) is. The most important thing about the rule of law \u2014 including property rights \u2014 is that it insulates society from this form of politics.\n\nI should have mentioned that the idea that the state is a criminal enterprise is a very old one. Here\u2019s Albert J. Nock:\n\nThe State\u2019s criminality is nothing new and nothing to be wondered at. It began when the first predatory group of men clustered together and formed the State, and it will continue as long as the State exists in the world, because the State is fundamentally an anti-social institution, fundamentally criminal. The idea that the State originated to serve any kind of social purpose is completely unhistorical. It originated in conquest and confiscation\u2014that is to say, in crime. It originated for the purpose of maintaining the division of society into an owning-and-exploiting class and a propertyless dependent class\u2014 that is, for a criminal purpose. No State known to history originated in any other manner, or for any other purpose. Like all predatory or parasitic institutions, its first instinct is that of self-preservation. All its enterprises are directed first towards preserving its own life, and, second, towards increasing its own power and enlarging the scope of its own activity. For the sake of this it will, and regularly does, commit any crime which circumstances make expedient.\n\nAs I write in my book, I think Nock was right about the origins of the state, but he was wrong about the liberal-democratic form of government championed to one extent or another by Burke, Locke, Hayek, and the Founders, among others. A society based on the idea of neutral rules, applicable to all equally, is an explicit rejection of the Big Man or Stationary Bandit model that all \u2014 or most \u2014 states originated from.\n\nWhat I left out of the G-File was the necessary condition for slipping out of the rule of law and into the rule of faction: Urgency.\n\nAs I argued in my essay on the moral equivalent of war in the new issues, urgency \u2014 i.e. crisis, war, etc. \u2014 is what causes people to say \u201cthere\u2019s no time to argue!\u201d and this empowers the state. The idea that \u201cthere is no time to argue\u201d is fundamentally anti-democratic because democracy is about disagreement not agreement.\n\nMy late brother once pointed out to me that the Mafia, or organized crime generally, thrives wherever time is hugely important. He drove a fish truck out of the old Fulton Fish Market and he saw some of this first hand. Fish have a short shelf-life and that\u2019s why the mob had suppliers and buyers over a barrel. Similarly, the mob was notoriously embedded in the newspaper-delivery truck racket. If you can\u2019t deliver newspapers on time, the newspapers become, literally, old news and therefore worthless.\n\nTim Carney recently noted that the key reason why the Green New Deal will become a cronyist-fecal festival is the need to rush.\n\n\u201cA Green New Deal,\u201d their resolution reads, \u201cmust be developed through transparent and inclusive consultation, collaboration, and partnership with frontline and vulnerable communities, labor unions, worker cooperatives, civil society groups, academia, and businesses.\u201d\n\nBut you can\u2019t have this intricate, collaborative, and inclusive process unless you take a very long time. The entire premise of this moon-shot, new deal, grand mobilization is that we don\u2019t have a lot of time before the planet melts.\n\nIf these \u201cGreen Dealers\u201d get their way, things will be rushed and thus centrally planned. Our world wars show what happens when Washington starts \u201creorganizing\u201d our economy toward some pressing immediate need. Namely, we get lots of corporatism and profiteering.\n\nThe very premise of the Green New Deal is that there\u2019s no time to argue, and that gives the state mob-like power.\n\nThe exact same logic applies to President Trump\u2019s emergency declaration, as Christian Vanderbrouk discusses here. The system thwarted Trump, so Trump wants to thwart the system. Trump himself said he didn\u2019t need to do this, he just wanted to do it faster. The urgency for Trump is personal and political but the logic is the same. Time is of the essence and so there\u2019s no time for arguing.\n\nSomething to Consider If you enjoyed this article, we have a proposition for you: Join NRPLUS.
