Other polls show similar findings. The percentages are even higher for women, minorities and young people.\n\nIf we hope to recognize this country 10 years from now, if we want to pass on to our children and grandchildren a nation that\u2019s as least as free and prosperous as the one we inherited, we need to focus our efforts on turning everyday Americans away from the false promises of bigger government. And we need greater education and outreach to do it.\n\nCertainly, one reason for this worrying trend is because average people see problems in this country they want solved, and a flurry of politicians, lobbying groups and others excitedly offer them more big government in response, with many of their solutions verging on outright socialism. Just look at Medicare for All, free college tuition and the Green New Deal as examples.\n\nWhat many average Americans fail to see is that conservatives see the same problems they do and want to solve them, too, but just by different means. But how do we convince them that we have better answers?\n\nFortunately, we have several factors on our side.\n\nFirst, we have the truth. Socialism has failed in every country, every time it\u2019s been tried. Additionally, here in the United States and in countries that have softer \u201cdemocratic socialism,\u201d decades of data show that big-government policies continue to fail over and over again. More often than not, they end up hurting the very people they were supposed to help. Welfare in the United States is just one example.\n\nSecond, some of the polls showing Americans warming up to socialism also show that, when pressed, respondents didn\u2019t understand what socialism actually involved. While initially they loved the idea of free college tuition, free health care and the Green New Deal, when they were told even a few details \u2014 like what it would cost them in new taxes, how their choices would go away, how bureaucrats in far-off places would be making decisions for them \u2014 they quickly turned against the proposals.\n\nThird, new polling by The Heritage Foundation shows that the groups that seem the warmest to bigger government \u2014 women, minorities and young people \u2014 actually agree with conservatives on many of our principles as long as we don\u2019t call them \u201cconservative.\u201d Reaching out to these groups and others is where we can turn the tide and find the numbers needed to stand against the statist agenda.\n\nWhen we asked a mix of conservative, moderate and liberal young people if they could find something to like about the conservative philosophy, only 39 percent respond positively. But when we left off the conservative label and just asked about principles like smaller government and giving more power to individuals and communities versus creating more government programs, we saw agreement with those principles increase to 63 percent.\n\nWhen we tested the same thing with the Hispanic community, agreement shot up from 38 percent to 61 percent. For African-Americans, it rose from 24 percent to 57 percent.\n\nThis tells us that conservatives have the right principles and the right solutions \u2014 but we need to do a better job of communicating them.\n\nThese Americans want the same things we do: Solutions to fight poverty and to ensure clean air and clean water. They want to know how we create higher-paying jobs, how we can deliver more affordable health care, and how we can preserve the freedoms we have without turning over our lives and our paychecks to government.\n\nOver the last two days, The Heritage Foundation has convened nearly a thousand of its members to discuss how we message our solutions to new audiences and turn this warming to socialism trend around before it\u2019s too late.\n\nWe are taking seriously the words of George Washington, who said, \u201cThe preservation of the sacred fire of liberty, and the destiny of the republican model of government, are \u2026 staked on the experiment entrusted to the hands of the American people.\u201d\n\nIndeed, our liberty \u2014 our destiny as a free nation \u2014 has been entrusted to our hands. The conservative movement must do everything we can to save it. And that means asking new people in new ways to join us.\n\n\u2022 Kay Coles James is president of The Heritage Foundation (heritage.org).\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
