Also beating Afghanistan for the first time was special.\n\n\u201cI started tearing a little bit in the morning, trying to get through the team talk with the boys. I am not someone who wears his heart on his sleeve, but I think this is the one thing that brought a few emotions out of me.\n\n\u201cEven when I tried to tell the guys and the team before I made the official announcement, I barely got through three sentences, so it\u2019s been a really emotional time for me.\u201d", "description": "Hamilton Masakadza signed off from international cricket in style, leading Zimbabwe to their first Twenty20 International win over Afghanistan with a blistering knock of 71 off 42 balls on Friday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
