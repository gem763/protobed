Matt Gaetz (Fla.), a leading Trump defender, announced to reporters.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna go!\u201d somebody else announced.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s do it!\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah!\u201d\n\nWith that, they rushed past Capitol Police officers and burst into the secure meeting room of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence \u2014 where the day\u2019s witness, Pentagon official Laura Cooper, was about to begin her closed-door testimony. The intruders shouted grievances about the process and defenses of the president \u2014 one reportedly got in Chairman Adam Schiff\u2019s face \u2014 until Schiff (D-Calif.) and Cooper abandoned the room. For the next five hours, the Occupy Intelligence Committee protest continued, temporarily halting the impeachment inquiry.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThey knew they were breaking House rules in insisting that they be allowed to participate in the session even though they were not among the 100 lawmakers \u2014 Democrats and Republicans \u2014 who sit on the three committees holding the inquiry. \u201cThis may very well be within Chairman Schiff and Nancy Pelosi\u2019s authority to do this,\u201d allowed one of the rebels, Rep. Chris Stewart (Utah).\n\nBut they also compromised security and possibly broke the law by barging into the room \u2014 a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, or SCIF \u2014 with their phones, an easy target for foreign surveillance. \u201cIt was a mistake,\u201d Rep. Jim Jordan (Ohio) said of the phones. \u201cIt won\u2019t happen again.\u201d\n\nBut the rules didn\u2019t much matter, for they were acting less as lawmakers than hooligans. The evidence compiled by the inquiry looks increasingly damning as witnesses detail a clear dollars-for-dirt quid pro quo between Trump and Ukraine. Trump\u2019s best defense may be to make the inquiry itself look like a circus. Luckily for him, Republicans have a bountiful supply of clowns.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe rebels ordered in 17 boxes of pizza for their sit-in, and an additional 15 pies for the assembled press corps \u2014 \u201cno quid pro quo,\u201d Rep. Mark Meadows (N.C.) joked. The rebels apparently worked up an appetite in their invasion of the SCIF, for Rep. Doug Lamborn (Colo.) soon arrived with a sack full of Chick-fil-A to follow the pizza.\n\nSuch a stunt isn\u2019t without precedent; Democrats held a sit-in on the House floor three years ago to protest inaction on gun control. But this was an odd act of civil disobedience. Because the protesters are leaders of the civil authority they were protesting, it was more self-disobedience. These same lawmakers used the very procedure they now object to \u2014 closed-door depositions \u2014 in their Benghazi probe. Democrats have pledged that after the deposition phase \u2014 equivalent to a grand jury \u2014 they will air the allegations and defenses in public impeachment proceedings.\n\nBut that might be too late for Republicans. A Quinnipiac poll Wednesday found growing support for the inquiry \u2014 55 percent overall, including a 50-45 advantage among independents \u2014 and the White House has been reduced to claiming that star witness Bill Taylor \u2014 West Point graduate, Vietnam infantry officer and Trump\u2019s hand-picked acting ambassador to Ukraine \u2014 is a \u201cradical unelected bureaucrat.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn a moment of candor during Wednesday\u2019s protest, Rep. Michael Waltz (Fla.) explained his objection to the closed proceedings. It will only be public, he said, \u201cafter they get this to the point they want it politically.\u201d Hence, the need to discredit the inquiry before more evidence comes in.\n\nRepublicans took turns venturing from the SCIF to the microphones.\n\n\u201cThis whole thing is a sham,\u201d complained Rep. Debbie Lesko (Ariz.).\n\n\u201cMembers have had it,\u201d said Jordan.\n\n\u201cWe plan to stay there until we have a more open and transparent and fair process,\u201d said Meadows.\n\nBut isn\u2019t this the same process as the Republicans\u2019 Benghazi probe? \u201cFrom a deposition standpoint,\u201d Meadows admitted, \u201cthat\u2019s probably correct.\u201d He argued that \u201cspecial times would require special accommodations.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nDemocrats were in no mood to grant special accommodations. They accused the intruders of compromising security, intimidating witnesses and violating ethics rules. By rights, Democrats could have had the House sergeant at arms evict the invaders, but they declined to reward the stunt with that visual. Instead, they left the occupiers alone in the SCIF until boredom ended the rebellion. And, sure enough, soon after the pizza and Chick-fil-A had been eaten, the hooligans filed out. With a final protest for the cameras, the rebels hurried away to vote on the floor.\n\nThe deposition finally began. And the Republicans could boast to Trump that, for a glorious five hours, they had delayed the inevitable.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The Occupy Intelligence Committee protest lasted several hours, but then the pizza and Chick-fil-A ran out.", "authors": ["Dana Milbank", "Op-Ed Columnist Covering National Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/s_8K1hTmf5WX7Wcy94F7hCvvQzI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TTKZAXN6KBGZ7MKSXNIZ2ENDFM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
