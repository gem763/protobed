It was tied 1-1, with Sean Monahan beating Bishop before Gaudreau won the game on the last attempt in the first round.\n\nRittich had 34 saves, including the stop of a penalty shot awarded to Alexander Radulov with 21 seconds remaining in overtime.\n\nBishop made 27 saves.\n\nThe Flames erased a 2-0 deficit in the third on goals by Elias Lindholm and Noah Hanifin.\n\nDallas newcomers Joel L'Esperance and Joel Hanley teamed up for a second-period goal. Captain Jamie Benn, the longest-tenured Star, scored Dallas' first power-play goal of the season nine seconds into the third period.\n\nCalgary Flames left wing Johnny Gaudreau (13) gets the puck past Dallas Stars goaltender Ben Bishop (30) to score during the shootout in an NHL hockey game in Dallas, Thursday, Oct. 10, 2019.

He sent the puck to the slot, where L'Esperance redirected it past Rittich at 16:39.\n\nL'Esperance and Hanley began the season with Texas of the AHL. L'Esperance's goal was his third in the NHL and first of the season. Hanley's seventh career assist was his first NHL point since April 2, 2016, with Montreal.\n\nHanley was playing in his first game for Dallas this season; L'Esperance scored in his second game back with the Stars.\n\nCalgary had lost its previous six games to Dallas since December 2016.\n\nThe Flames improved to 2-1-1; Dallas is 1-3-1, with each game decided by a one-goal margin.\n\nThe Stars had the only power play in the scoreless first period but didn't put a shot on goal with the advantage.\n\nDallas outshot the Flames 16-9 in the second period, including seven shots on goal during three more power plays.\n\nThe Stars won the third-period faceoff. Benn skated down the slot and took a pass in front to beat Rittich for his first goal of the season. Dallas had started the season 0 for 13 on the power play.\n\nCalgary scored 1:29 later on its first power play on Lindholm's shot from just inside the blue line. Hanifin tied the game at 2 at 5:32, trailing a 2-on-1 rush and taking a pass back in the slot from Mikael Backlund.\n\nNOTES: Flames D Michael Stone played for the first time this season after being a healthy scratch for the first three games. Stone replaced D Oliver Kylington in the lineup. . Dallas D Taylor Fedun was scratched, allowing Hanley to make his season debut.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nFlames: Play on Saturday at Vegas in the second game of a three-game trip.\n\nStars: Host Washington on Saturday to complete a two-game homestand.
