Elizabeth Warren\u2019s presidential campaign: Medicare-for-all.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nRobert Wolf, who was a fundraiser, donor and adviser to Obama, told FOX Business' Gerry Baker on WSJ at Large that Sen. Warren\u2019s position is just not practical if she is to be the Democratic Party nominee and try to beat President Trump in 2020.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing\u2019s electability.\" - Robert Wolf, former President Obama economic team member\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a bit tough to win industrial America if your idea is Medicare-for-all and taking private insurance away,\" Wolf told FOX Business.\n\nBut Wolf said he is encouraged that Sen. Warren may be seeing things more his way.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\n\u201cI would say that Elizabeth Warren\u2019s team tried to pivot a little, because, last week, she called it a platform instead of a policy.\" - Robert Wolf, former President Obama economic team member\n\nWhile he is cautious about polls, Wolf notes Sen. Warren\u2019s popularity has grown to where she\u2019s the frontrunner in some surveys, and she may have gotten some help when her chief progressive rival -- Sen. Bernie Sanders -- suffered a heart attack in early October.\n\n\u201cElizabeth Warren had a lot of momentum,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cI think, partly, she has run a really strong campaign, but also Bernie\u2019s health had an issue.\"\n\nVARNEY: WARREN'S PLANS ARE A 'DANGEROUS GAME' FOR THE US ECONOMY\n\nWolf, who is also a Fox News contributor, says right now, the Democratic Party seems to be split.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say about 40 percent is in this populist lane and that\u2019s really between Warren and Sanders,\u201d he said. \u201cForty percent is in the moderate lane, and that seems to be led by Joe Biden, and certainly Mayor Pete\u2019s had some good momentum. So, they have 80 percent of the field, and then 20 percent\u2019s not sure which way to go.\u201d\n\nAnd that has him worried about the Democrats' chances in 2020.\n\nJUST HOW MUCH DOES MEDICARE-FOR-ALL REALLY COST?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s probably half-a-dozen candidates if we include Kamala Harris and we include others, that actually can last easily through the first four primaries into Super Tuesday,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd my biggest concern is not whether there\u2019s a third-party candidate or a new candidate entering ... [it's] is there a chance of a brokered convention where no one gets to 50 percent?\u201d\n\nBut right now at least, he has a favorite.\n\n\u201cThis year, Gerry, versus years past, the most important thing\u2019s electability,\u201d he said. \u201cToday, Joe Biden looks like he is the most electable by the polls.\u201d\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "A top economic adviser to President Obama says Sen.
