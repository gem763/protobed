The American president told reporters of the Turks\u2019 efforts to rid northern Syria of the Kurds, \u201c[T]hey had to have it cleaned out.\u201d\n\nYesterday, however, one of Trump\u2019s congressional allies was more explicit on this point. The Dallas Morning News reported:\n\nTexas Sen. John Cornyn defended the president\u2019s abrupt decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, arguing Wednesday that with Turkey intent on ethnic cleansing of the Kurds \u2013 longtime U.S. allies in the fight against the radical Islamic State \u2013 the move had merit. \u201cIf Turkey was planning on coming into northern Syria and trying to ethnically cleanse the Kurds, and U.S. troops were caught in the middle, I am not completely convinced that it was a bad idea to get them out of harm\u2019s way,\u201d Cornyn said.\n\nIf the quote is accurate, I\u2019m a little surprised the Senate Republican would make a comment like this on the record. The Texan\u2019s position, in effect, is that our allies were facing a campaign of ethnic cleansing, so the smart move was to get out of the way so as to avoid being caught up in the slaughter.\n\nIn fairness, Cornyn didn\u2019t endorse this position with great enthusiasm, but he did tell reporters that he\u2019s \u201cnot completely convinced\u201d that standing aside in the face of an ethnic cleansing campaign was \u201ca bad idea.\u201d\n\nCornyn\u2019s position does not appear to enjoy broad support in the Republican Party. The senator\u2019s fellow Texan, Sen. Ted Cruz (R), denounced Trump\u2019s policy in northern Syria, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) wrote an op-ed last week, characterizing the president decision to withdraw U.S. troops as a grave mistake.\n\nIn the House, a bipartisan resolution opposing the president\u2019s policy easily passed last week, 354 to 60, with even House Republicans voting for it by a two-to-one margin. Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) tried to force a vote on it earlier this week, but Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) blocked it.", "description": "The Texan's position, in effect, is that our allies were facing a campaign of ethnic cleansing, so the smart move was to get out of the way.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/article-teasers/183648876_0.jpg?itok=7IV0acjo", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
