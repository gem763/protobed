Rick Scott, R-Fla., weighed in on findings suggesting climate change has increased the strength of storms, during an interview on \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\nHost Chris Wallace asked Scott if there was a connection between climate change and the increased potency of hurricanes, and he said the specific causes remained unknown.\n\n\"We know the climate's changing and we know our storms seem to be getting bigger,\" he said. \"The last four years as governor, I had four of them. And now, we have them my first year out... we don't know what the cause is -- but we've got to react to it... We've put money into dealing with things like sea-level rise... we've got to continue to figure this out.\"\n\nAOC SAYS SHE'S WOKEN UP AT 3:30 AM BECAUSE OF HER ANXIETY ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE\n\nScott told Floridians what they should do to prepare for the incoming storm, saying it's always best to overprepare and be ready for the worst.\n\n\"[Dorian] can still move right into Florida,\" he said earlier in the interview. \"That's my biggest concern is, people are going to think, 'oh we're off the hook.' We are not off the hook,\" he said.\n\nCONTINUING COVERAGE OF HURRICANE DORIAN ON FOX NEWS CHANNEL\n\n\"Take it seriously. Overprepare.
