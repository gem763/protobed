On a day when the economic calendar is light, the pair remained stuck near 1.1050. Headlines rule the day, and when the news was released that Germany is mulling the creation of a shadow budget to increase public investment beyond restrictions of national debt rules if the outlook warrants, EUR/USD pushed from 1.1030 to 1.1057. It now looks like there is plenty of room to move up towards 1.1100.\n\nEUR/USD remains in a long-term descending triangle, and however, on September 3rd, the pair created a hammer at trendline support on a daily timeframe. Although not textbook, with the bullish candle on the 4th one, can argue this is a morning star candlestick formation, which is a powerful three candle reversal signal. Although there is a lot of time left in the day, if the pair closed above 1.1057, a bullish engulfing candle will be formed, which suggests the pair could move up to 1.1100, which is trendline resistance and the 38.2% retracement level from the July 25th high to the Sept 3rd lows. Above that, there is horizontal resistance and the 50% retracement level from the same time period near 1.1170. Support remains at September 3rd lows, at 1.0925.\n\nEURUSD Daily Chart\n\nOn a light data day such as today, always be on the lookout for headlines regarding Brexit and ECB. Although there have been several Brexit headlines today, none have noticeably affected EUR/USD. Also, Mario Draghi\u2019s last meeting as ECB President is Thursday. It\u2019s worth watching for headlines regarding the upcoming meeting.\n\n\"Disclaimer: The information and opinions in this report are for general information use only and are not intended as an offer or solicitation with respect to the purchase or sale of any currency or CFD contract.
