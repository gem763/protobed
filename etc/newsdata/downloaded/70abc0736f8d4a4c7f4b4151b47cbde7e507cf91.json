Community workers and counsellors have also joined them [to] protest against low remuneration,\" she said.\n\n\"The committee urges the departments of health at national and [provincial] level, as well as the South African Police Service, to put in measures in place to deal with the matter.\"\n\nEarlier, provincial health spokesperson Tebogo Lekgethwane described the situation at Tshepong Hospital as tense and said it was operating with skeleton staff.\n\nHe added that only critically-ill patients and emergencies were being attended to.\n\n\"We are appealing to people [and say] that they can protest, but they must allow those who are sick to receive medical attention,\" he said.", "description": "\"While we are all concerned about these serious allegations, robbing patients of life-saving care can never be justified,\" chairperson of Parliament's Select Committee on Social Services, Cathy Dlamini has said.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4239/42582d4460f54eb6a4032c7a1cc22fbd.jpg", "published_at": "2018-05-09"}
