It closed in 1998 for restoration and in 2011 because of earthquake damage.\n\n\"We're frankly excited to get the monument back open to the public,\" Hill said. \"We have missed having our public visiting us.\"\n\nWashington's tallest structure stands 555 feet, 5 1/8 inches above the mall and was originally completed in 1884. It took 40 years to construct, with a delay for the Civil War.\n\nWhen the obelisk was first completed, it was the tallest building in the world.", "description": "The Washington Monument closed in 2016 after an elevator cable snapped, but the years of repairs covered far more than that single broken wire.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/washington-monument-01-ap-jc-190918_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
