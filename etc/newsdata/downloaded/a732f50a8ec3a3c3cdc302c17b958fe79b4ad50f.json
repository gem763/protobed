Until Rebekah Vardy is proven guilty come off it, this is not OK.\"\n\nNicola clashed with presenter Vanessa Feltz during the debate on whether there should be preferential treatment for expectant mothers.\n\nShe said: \"Forget who it is. Whether it\u2019s a celebrity, a WAG or a normal person. Pregnancy, we all know stress can cause so much upset. We\u2019ve just had a report from psychiatrists not that long ago that it it can affect the baby's brain.\"\n\nOn the trolling, she added: \"I know I've been reading it personally. It\u2019s horrific. 'Hope the unborn baby dies. Hope they both die'. This level of abuse is horrific, especially if your pregnant.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nNicola even hit out at This Morning for giving airtime to the WAGatha Christie debate.\n\nOn Coleen's claims, she said: \"I don\u2019t think she knows it's Rebekah. She\u2019s seven months pregnant. I think it\u2019s hypocritical any show talks about mental health and wellbeing but it's OK to slam her because she\u2019s not a likeable a person.\n\n\"Coleen said it has been going on for years. Let it wait.\"\n\nThis Morning host Ruth Langsford defended the show by insisting they were \"not slamming\" Becky.\n\nNicola went on to insist Dr Ranj would back her up and that mothers have to protect themselves during pregnancy.\n\nShe said: \"[Coleen] could have stopped this. She didn\u2019t need to do this. I\u2019m not saying Coleen is a bad person. I don't know her.\n\n\"As a mother, we are aware of what happens when you post something. She knew that and chose to put a pregnant woman under this much stress.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nAt the end of the interview, furious Nicola added: \"If Coleen wants to be this outspoken why isn\u2019t she outing other people in her life as well?\"\n\nThis Morning viewers took to Twitter to blast Nicola for her attack on Coleen.\n\nOne viewer said: \"How embarrassing was Nicola?! So angry, you would\u2019ve thought she was the one being called out and not Rebekah. Glad @RuthieeL told her!\"\n\n\"Was Nicola actually talking for Rebekah or just making the whole thing about her? Also unnecessary to bring Colleens relationship into it,\" added another.\n\nA third said: \"Of course Nicola would defend Rebekah would she be as forgiving if someone leaked a story on her\"\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nIt took just minutes for Becky to respond to Coleen's claims - hitting back with a strong denial of the allegations.\n\nTweeting her response to Coleen's statement, Rebekah said: \"As I have just said to you on the phone, I wish you had called me if you thought this.\n\n\"I never speak to anyone about you as various journalists who have asked me to over the years can vouch for.\n\n\"If you thought this was happening you could have told me & I could have changed my passwords to see if it stopped.\n\n(Image: Twitter)\n\n\"Over the years various people have had access to my insta & just this week I found I was following people I didn't know and have never followed myself\n\n\"I'm not being funny but I don't need the money, what would I gain from selling stories on you?\n\nI liked you a lot Coleen & I'm so upset that you have chosen to do this, especially when I'm heavily pregnant.\n\n\"I'm disgusted that I'm even having to deny this. You should have called me the first time this happened.\"\n\n*This Morning airs weekdays on ITV at 10.30am", "description": "Rebekah Vardy's close friend claimed abuse of the pregnant WAG was causing stress to her baby before launching a scathing attack on Coleen Rooney", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Itv", "Dave J Hogan Getty Images", "Getty Images", "Ken Mckay Itv Rex Shutterstock", "Twitter"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20559215.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Nicola-McLeans-brutal-takedown-of-Coleen-Rooney-with-wild-claims-over-harming-Becky-Vardys-baby.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
