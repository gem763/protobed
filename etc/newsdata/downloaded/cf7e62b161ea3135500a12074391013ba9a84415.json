Now she\u2019s running its Baltimore field office.", "language": "en", "text": "Her return to Maryland at age 48 is a bit grittier. In June, she was appointed special agent in charge of the FBI\u2019s Baltimore Field Office, investigating a wide range of crimes across Maryland and Delaware. The office has been probing former mayor Catherine Pugh\u2019s business dealings, a ransomware hack of city computer systems and pervasive drug violence.\n\nIn between her departure and return, she pursued Latin American studies at Georgetown University, traveled to five continents and developed expertise in counterterrorism, counterintelligence, cybercrime and \u201cbig city\u201d crime.\n\nOver the course of her FBI career, \u201cIt took 22 years, but I came home,\u201d Boone said in a recent interview at her new office in Woodlawn.\n\nCurrent and former colleagues laud her professionalism, grasp of detail, foresight and leadership \u2014 all of which may come into play as her office works with other agencies on cases of public corruption and complex criminal enterprises.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been very impressed with how quickly she comes up to speed on detailed matters,\u201d said Maryland U.S. Attorney Robert K. Hur. He said Boone will serve as an important law enforcement partner, especially with Baltimore facing high levels of violent crime. He said he and Boone are in constant contact about cases.\n\nHe noted her expertise and previous leadership roles in the FBI\u2019s Los Angeles and Philadelphia offices. Those locales also have \u201cbig city crime problems\u201d and give Boone \u201ca great balance of prior experience,\u201d he said.\n\nBoone won\u2019t talk about ongoing cases. But shortly before Boone\u2019s arrival, the FBI searched City Hall and Pugh\u2019s house, with agents in dark-blue jackets carrying out boxes related to Pugh\u2019s \u201cHealthy Holly\u201d children\u2019s book scandal. No one\u2019s been charged, and the investigation continues.\n\nThe FBI is also investigating a ransomware attack on Baltimore\u2019s computer network that shut down the city\u2019s email system and its ability to perform basic services such as accepting online payments and conducting real estate operations.\n\nBoone\u2019s new role also puts her at the forefront of the city\u2019s efforts to curb drug violence. The FBI, local law enforcement agencies and the Maryland U.S. attorney\u2019s office recently announced a new \u201cstrike force\u201d to investigate foreign drug suppliers that have flooded Baltimore with heroin, fentanyl and other illicit drugs for years. This summer, federal prosecutors announced sweeping indictments against 90 defendants, allegedly members of violent drug crews that authorities say were responsible for running guns and drugs across the city.\n\nBoone says the agency is also responsible for protecting 1,800 defense contractors and premiere research facilities in the area, of which \u201cforeign adversaries would like to get a hold of some of the work, research and expertise.\u201d\n\nBoone\u2019s drive manifested itself early on. After graduating from high school, she earned bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in Latin American studies from Georgetown University. At the time, a family friend who worked for the FBI persuaded her to apply. She started training at Quantico in 1997.\n\nGeorgetown professor Anthony Clark Arend, who taught Boone, said he recognized her leadership abilities early.\n\n\u201cShe always had this maturity and professionalism,\u201d he said. \u201cShe seemed perfectly situated to move into law enforcement. She is one of these people who comports herself in such a way that you have immediate respect for her.\u201d\n\nAs an agent at the FBI\u2019s Southern California West Covina satellite office, Boone investigated public corruption and complex financial crimes. She later transferred to investigating bank robberies, fugitives and crimes against children.\n\nSome cases, particularly child kidnappings, made a deep impression on her.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something about seeing a child reunited with their parents that will stay forever with you,\u201d she said.\n\nAlong the way, she\u2019s had a global education. Already fluent in Spanish, she started studying Arabic (Boone smiled while recalling an Arabic instruction session when she slipped into Spanish, eliciting chuckles from her instructor.). She has traveled to Asia, Australia, Europe and South America for cases or training.\n\nThe Sept. 11, 2001, attacks forever changed the bureau, she said, and many agents were diverted to investigating terrorist organizations. Boone went to work on counterterrorism efforts in Washington and investigated how terrorist groups funded themselves.\n\nBoone said her work has taught her that counterterrorism, counterintelligence and cybercrimes must often be investigated together.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a globalized environment now,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we are going to understand the totality of the threats faced by our communities and by our country, we can\u2019t look at it through blinders.\u201d\n\nHer work at the FBI has led to interesting positions, including serving in an advisory role to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and later as the director in intelligence programs for the National Security Council at the White House. A picture of her and President Barack Obama in what appeared to be the Oval Office hangs in her office.\n\nBoone headed counterintelligence and cyber programs at the Philadelphia office for about two years under Ed Hanko, former special agent in charge there.\n\nNow that she\u2019s in charge of overseeing such broad efforts in Baltimore, Boone knows cooperation with all federal, state and local agencies is key.\n\n\u201cYou set the path, missions and goals for everyone else to follow. She\u2019s great at that,\u201d said Hanko, now vice president of global security for Aramark Corp. \u201cShe has good intuition and foresight.\u201d\n\nIn early 2016, Boone was named the deputy assistant director in the Counterintelligence Division at FBI headquarters, leading the agency\u2019s investigations of \u201cforeign adversaries\u201d seeking to acquire technology, intellectual property and manufacturing processes.\n\n\u201cSome of those countries are trying to sow discontent within the U.S.,\u201d she said. Agents rely on collaboration with companies, such as social media corporations that now screen for and flag illegitimate accounts possibly by \u201ca foreign country that is seeking to do something that would hurt the United States.\u201d\n\nBoone took part in the investigation of Harold Martin of Glen Burnie, a National Security Agency contractor who pleaded guilty this year to stealing about half a billion pages of secret government documents over nearly two decades. It was one of the largest cases of its kind, and Martin was sentenced to 9 years in prison.\n\nBoone largely declined to identify specific cases. At that time, the bureau was investigating the Russian interference into the 2016 presidential election.\n\nBoone\u2019s work did overlap with Bill Priestap, the assistant director of the FBI\u2019s counterintelligence division that investigated Hillary Clinton and the Trump campaign.\n\nPriestap, who has since retired from the bureau, said Boone is thoughtful, \u201cknows the issues well,\u201d and brings a wealth of management experiences to the Baltimore office. But he said she also makes an effort to know her employees.\n\n\u201cShe always went the extra mile,\u201d he said.\n\nIn 2018, Boone returned to Los Angeles to oversee counterintelligence operations, including the case of a computer programmer allegedly working for the North Korean government. Park Jin Hyok was charged in the 2014 Sony Pictures Entertainment attack and the WannaCry ransomware crisis that affected nearly 150 countries.\n\nWhen Baltimore former special agent in charge Gordon B. Johnson retired this year, Boone said, she jumped at the opportunity to return to Maryland where she still has family, and she can root for the Orioles. She said she hopes to retire from the office.\n\nShe jokes she\u2019s from a \u201csplit household,\u201d as her father hailed from the Baltimore area while her mother was an Eastern Shore native. Though she grew up in Centreville, she said she spent time in Annapolis and Baltimore.\n\nShe said she\u2019s glad she made it back for crab season.\n\n\u2014 Baltimore Sun\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Jennifer Boone, who grew up in Maryland, will run an office charged with investigating a range of crimes.", "authors": ["Jessica Anderson"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6D4LKITHQ4I6TINWWKNZB35IPE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
