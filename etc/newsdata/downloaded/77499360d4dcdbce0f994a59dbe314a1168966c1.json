It was shown at a meeting of American Priority, a pro-Trump organization, celebrating \u201cfree speech, free association and American culture\u201d at Trump National Doral Miami, a golf resort that he owns.\n\nMany of the hundreds who attended \u2014 including Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, the former White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s son \u2014 said they did not condone the violence portrayed and were not aware that the video had played on a loop in a conference room next to the resort\u2019s Donald J. Trump Ballroom. Two small television screens were set up in the conference room, where people filtered in and out. The video was projected against a wall, according to one person who attended and shared a photo.\n\nThe online community that makes and shares grisly videos like this one uses what it calls \u201cspicy memes\u201d to fire up the president\u2019s base, stir outrage among his opponents and provoke coverage by the mainstream media, which often helps amplify the messages.\n\nSome of these meme-makers profit by soliciting donations or running ads on YouTube. (Data from SocialBlade, a website that tracks social media statistics, estimates that TheGeekzTeam has earned less than $2,000 from the channel over the past year.) Others do it purely for the notoriety \u2014 or, best of all, an approving retweet from the president.", "description": "The White House said President Trump condemned a fake video depicting him killing rivals and members of the news media.
