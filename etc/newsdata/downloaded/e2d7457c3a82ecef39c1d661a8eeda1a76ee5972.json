My children are not going to sit in a cabinet meeting,\" he explained. \"The idea that you\u2019re going to have \u2014 go to the extent that he [Trump] has gone to have, you know, his children and son-in-law [Jared Kushner] engaged in the day-to-day operation of things they know nothing about.\u201d\n\n\"You don\u2019t think Jared Kushner should be negotiating in the Middle East peace solution?\u201d host Norah O'Donnell asked.\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t,\" Biden said with a snicker and a laugh. \"What credential does he bring to that?\u201d\n\nCould Biden be anymore hypocritical? He's great at deflecting, especially when it comes to the Ukraine scandal. He continually beats the drum that his son, Hunter, did nothing wrong by sitting on the board of a Ukrainian gas company, despite having no natural energy experience. Hunter was being paid $50,000 a month, for what? The only logical conclusion is that he provided the gas company, Burisma, with access to his dad. It's rather \"coincidental\" that Hunter was getting all this money while Joe was vice president and handling foreign relations with Ukraine on behalf of the Obama administration.\n\nSome people might not like that the Trump kids serve as advisors to their father, but guess what? They at least have international business experience. The Trump kids have made business dealings around the world. They didn't simply become rich because daddy is President of the United States. They didn't suddenly launch business ventures in foreign nations because their dad is a political leader. They did all of those things before Donald Trump even considered running for office. The same can not be said about Hunter Biden. But keep on doubling down, Joe.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Facepalm..10/26/2019 19:58:36PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Bronson Stocking"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/288/bcd2bbdc-6c44-437e-a5c0-4b9e052ad07c.png", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
