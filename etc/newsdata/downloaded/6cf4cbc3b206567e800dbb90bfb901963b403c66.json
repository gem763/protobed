This far exceeded the BBC series Planet Earth II and Dynasties.\n\nHowever, they said it still failed to visually show how threatened the natural world is.\n\n\u201cOne could argue that by using camera angles to avoid showing any sign of people, nature filmmakers are being disingenuous, and even actively misleading audiences,\u201d said lead researcher Professor Julia Jones from Bangor University.\n\n\u201cThe viewer may be led to believe that things cannot be that bad for biodiversity as what they are seeing on the screen shows nature, for the most part, doing fine.\n\n\u201cThe inextricable link between threats to the natural world and the high consumption of western lifestyles would be more difficult to ignore if the presence, or even dominance, of commercial agriculture, mining and transport infrastructure were more visible in the landscapes, reducing the space for the awe-inspiring wild spectacles shown.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

By taking up the position closest to a female, the male stands the best chance of fertilising her eggs.\" BBC 4/10 Saddleback clownfish (Amphiprion polymnus) \"A male saddleback clownfish uses all the strength it can muster to push a coconut shell to its anemone in Borneo. Unlike their reef relatives, saddleback clownfish live around anemones that are found in the sand, far away from the solid structure of the coral reef. Male saddleback clownfish must use their ingenuity to find a hard substrate upon which the females can lay their eggs.\" BBC 5/10 Peters' monocle breams (Scolopsis affinis) \"A group of Peters' monocle breams blow water-jets onto a hiding bobbit worm (Eunice aphroditois) to expose its ferocious jaws. In so doing, they alert other fish to the worm's location, ruining the predator\u2019s chance of a surprise attack.

BBC 7/10 Bumphead parrotfish (Bolbometopon muricatum) \"Bumphead parrotfish feeding on coral and algae in Borneo. These parrotfish use their large forehead to ram corals, thereby breaking them into pieces that are more easily ingested. Each fish ingests over 5 tons of structural reef carbonates per year and after they digest the edible portions from the rock, they excrete it as sand, helping to create small islands and the sandy beaches.\" BBC 8/10 Coral garden \"A fish's-eye view of a coral garden on the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. New underwater probe lenses, developed for Blue Planet II, allow the viewer to immerse themselves into the coral reef city like never before.\" BBC 9/10 A coral grouper (Plectropomus leopardus) \"A coral grouper on the Great Barrier Reef in Northern Australia. Groupers use a gesture dubbed the \u2018headstand signal\u2019 to reach across the vertebrate-invertebrate divide and encourage another species to help it hunt. Gestures such as this are thought to only occur in the largest-brained species.

Previous research has suggested that people are willing to make personal lifestyle changes and increase support for conservation. This generally means that policy change is more likely.\n\n\u201cHowever, we still don\u2019t understand the mechanisms by which these changes take place,\u201d said Laura Thomas-Walters, co-author of the study and PhD student at the University of Kent.\n\n\u201cConsiderable research is needed to investigate how viewing nature, portrayed as threatened or pristine, in a documentary affects people in ways which might, ultimately, contribute to saving it.\u201d\n\nScientists said collaboration between filmmakers and researchers could help the audience better understand the issues associated with the destruction of the natural world.\n\n\u201cBy bringing the threats of facing nature into the mainstream (however tentatively) documentaries such as Our Planet help biodiversity and the pressure it faces gain a little more space in the minds of citizens worldwide,\u201d researchers wrote in the paper.\n\n\u201cConservation documentaries have repeatedly been shown the positively affect our attitudes to wildlife, but we lack a more nuanced understanding of how artistic and narrative decisions influence behaviour change.\n\n\u201cThe time is therefore right to tackle the questions around the extent to which representations of nature on screen affects people in ways which might, ultimately, contribute to conserving that nature.\u201d\n\nJulian Hector, Head of BBC Studios Natural History Unit told The Independent: \u201cWe all recognise the world is in an environmental climate crisis. BBC Studio\u2019s Natural History Unit has and always will strive to do more to champion the natural world.\n\n\u201cOver one billion people have watched Planet Earth II and Blue Planet II globally. If you were to ask anyone which recent Sir David Attenborough programme has done most to raise awareness for environmental issues and conservation, the answer on most people\u2019s lips would be Blue Planet II.\u201d", "description": "Nature documentaries could be \u201cactively misleading audiences\u201d by showing nature as something pristine that is not being damaged by humans, researchers warn.
