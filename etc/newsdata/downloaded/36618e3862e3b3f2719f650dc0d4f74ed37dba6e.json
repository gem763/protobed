The ongoing sharp political divisions in the United Kingdom about the UK\u2019s efforts to withdraw from the European Union (Brexit) have added to the uncertainties facing businesses and investors. Also, the continuing demonstrations in Hong Kong are likely harming its reputation as a stable and secure financial center and an attractive environment for foreign investment. And as the quarter comes to an end, the attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities has shocked oil markets and raised very troubling geopolitical and economic concerns.\n\nThe economic backdrop to all these headwinds for risk-taking is a global economy that is losing momentum, with a slowdown in the manufacturing sector in most countries. The J.P. Morgan Composite Output Index for August indicated that global growth was at the slowest pace in three years.\n\nDespite the above factors, investors continued to support the international equity markets during the quarter thus far. Over the past 90 days through September 16, the , gained 2.8% on a total return basis. The advanced-economy markets of Europe and Asia-Pacific that are covered by the iShares MSCI EAFE ETF, EFA, also registered a 2.6% gain. The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF, , advanced slightly less, 2.4%. Stocks in emerging markets usually suffer in times of \u201crisk off\u201d investor sentiment.\n\nThe performance of individual national markets varied considerably. Selectivity among national markets and diversification across national markets are important for investors.\n\nIn Asia the iShares MSCI Japan ETF, (NYSE: ), outperformed, gaining 6%, while Hong Kong, suffering from the political unrest and the slowdown in China, lost 1.5% according to the iShares MSCI Hong Kong ETF, (NYSE: ). Similarly, in Europe, the iShares MSCI France ETF, (NYSE: ), advanced 3.3%, whereas German equities, impacted more by the global slowdown in trade, gained only 0.9% according to the iShares MSCI Germany ETF, (NYSE: ). Across the Channel, the iShares MSCI United Kingdom ETF (NYSE: ), lost 1% over the past 90 days as the country continues to be rocked by political turmoil over Brexit.\n\nAmong the emerging markets, the iShares MSCI China ETF (NASDAQ: ), gained 6.3%, as the government further strengthened its efforts to counter a slowing economy. In contrast, the iShares MSCI South Korea ETF (NYSE: ), is up only 1.7% and still down 1.4% year-to-date. That country remains locked in a political dispute with Japan over World War II reparations.\n\nAs the third quarter comes to an end, high uncertainty about trade disputes, Brexit, Iran, and the oil market continues. The very low interest rates around the globe and the prospect of increased fiscal stimulus should be favorable to equity markets, but the downside political risks remain significant.", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by Cumberland Advisors (Bill Witherell) covering: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF, iShares MSCI South Korea Capped, iShares MSCI Japan, iShares MSCI China.
