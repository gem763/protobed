Virtually every analysis of the slowdown in global growth and the heightened probability of recession cite the negative impact of the tariffs the Trump administration has levied on trading partners, mostly China, and their retaliatory tariffs on the United States. U.S. manufacturing has been contracting most of this year, meaning that sector is already in recession. A recent analysis by Federal Reserve economists estimates that the impact of the trade war could reduce U.S. real GDP growth by 1 percent by early next year.\n\nBased on these and other related facts \u2014 tariffs could end up costing consumers $1,000 per year \u2014 I\u2019ve long argued that the trade war is all pain, no gain. But I\u2019ve gotten pushback, mostly from business leaders, and especially from those who have tried to do business in China. Their argument is that somebody needed to get tough on China, and that Trump is doing the country a service that former leaders failed to pursue. Moreover, he\u2019s doing so at his own political expense. Sure, there\u2019s short-term pain, but in the long run, he\u2019s going to force China to play fair with U.S. multinationals that want to locate there, but not under current terms that include technology transfers, investment restrictions and endless non-tariff barriers like taking years to provide operating licenses to U.S. businesses.\n\nJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, for example, argued in April that Trump was \u201cabsolutely\u201d right to face off against China, even if he wasn\u2019t \u201cin favor of the tariffs.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re better off dealing with it now, whatever that means for the economy,\u201d Dimon said. Former Goldman Sachs chief executive Lloyd Blankfein tweeted that \u201cTariffs might be an effective negotiating tool. Saying it hurts us misses the point,\u201d that point being that since China has more to lose than we do in a trade war (we import far more from them than they do from us), the ultimate benefits of forcing them to play more fairly with U.S. companies will outweigh the near-term costs. As Amber Phillips reports in The Washington Post, Republicans supporting the president\u2019s trade war say it\u2019s \u201c\u2026 just the price to pay in this long game so that we can achieve a better trading partnership with China.\u201d\n\n\u201cStanding up to\u201d and \u201cgetting tough on\u201d China also consistently poll well, even among people who agree that the trade war is a burden for consumers. As reported in the Hill, pollster Mark Penn said that \u201cPresident Trump has the strong support of the American public when it comes to standing up to China. They realize that the tariffs may have negative impacts on jobs and prices, but they believe the fight here is the right one.\u201d This dynamic creates a real challenge for Democratic candidates for president who want to distance themselves from Trump\u2019s trade policy but not appear soft on China.\n\nThat whole way of looking at the issue is misguided.\n\nWhat is the administration\u2019s goal with the trade war? What would victory look like? In fact, there are two goals: one maintained by Trump, and the other by his negotiators.\n\nTrump\u2019s goal is import substitution \u2014 making things here that we currently make elsewhere \u2014 with the goal of achieving balanced trade. In July, he tweeted that tariffs are \u201ca powerful way to get companies to come to the USA and to get companies that have left us for other lands to COME BACK HOME.\u201d\n\nI believe he\u2019s wrong about this, at least not without far more drastic measures lasting far longer than is realistic, even in Trumpland. Our economy is simply too interconnected to that of our trading partners to realistically achieve more than a tiny margin of import substitution. Observe how U.S. firms leaving China aren\u2019t coming home; they\u2019re looking for new overseas platforms to relocate their supply chains, mostly other places in Southeast Asia.\n\nThe other goal, the main one sought by our trade negotiators, is to get China to stop the practices that make life hard for U.S. multinationals \u2014 the tech transfers, cybertheft, investment and licensing restrictions. I\u2019m skeptical, but they\u2019ve got a better chance of meeting this goal than the import substitution one.\n\nBut suppose the negotiators succeed. Whom, precisely, does this help? Getting China to be more welcoming to U.S. multinational corporations would increase, not decrease, the incentives for U.S. companies to offshore more production and jobs (note also how goal 2 contradicts goal 1). Protecting intellectual property, allowing more foreign investment and breaking down restrictions that hassle U.S. companies that have relocated or want to do so, will surely boost their bottom lines. It will lower the costs of doing business abroad. But none of that helps American workers in \u201ctradable\u201d sectors, i.e., those who face pressure from offshoring and import competition. To the contrary; it hurts them.\n\nWe should have long since disabused ourselves of the assumption that what\u2019s good for multinational offshorers is good for domestic U.S. workers. Yet that sentiment is implicit in the view that the short-term pain will deliver long-term gains. It might do so, but for whom? From where I sit, it looks a lot friendlier to profits than wages.\n\nThat\u2019s not necessarily a terrible outcome. Contrary to the tone of some Democratic candidates, I don\u2019t believe corporate profits are evil or definitionally problematic. And the more robust global supply chains that exist out there, the better.\n\nCorporate profits have long outpaced wages, though. And the fact that we\u2019ve run economically significant trade deficits in manufactured goods for over 40 years has done lasting damage to many people and places across the land. For working Americans, I see no advantages to a trade war that, if it succeeds, threatens to exacerbate that damage.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong regarding China: While I worry less than the average economist about their trade practices, I would put much more energy into exposing and condemning their human rights abuses. I wouldn\u2019t bother complaining about legitimate aspects of their economic model to which we object, like state-owned firms. In fact, the best solution to the China problem is to beat them at their own game \u2014 to look around the next corner and try to capture global market share in areas where demand will be strong, such as green technology, clean energy storage and battery technology.\n\nBut if you\u2019re someone who depends on your paycheck vs. your stock portfolio, be careful what you wish for when it comes to victory in the trade war. Just keep asking yourself the key question: Whose victory are we talking about?", "description": "If you depend on your paycheck versus your stock portfolio, the trade war is not being fought on your behalf.", "authors": ["Jared Bernstein", "Chief Economist To Former Vice President Joe Biden", "Is A Senior Fellow At The Center On Budget", "Policy Priorities.", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/NQvjjye3VyvKHCLJcnDHjS45794=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ETZ2QVGTCMI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
