It's not clear if this is the same death reported by Monroe County.\n\nThe CDC is expected to report new flu data on Thursday.\n\nEach year, countless flu strains circle the globe. Some are more active and prevalent than others in different times and places.\n\nDuring the record-shattering 2017-2018 flu season, for example, a strain known as influenza A (H3N2) was dominant and particularly aggressive for the first half of the flu season.\n\nBut the tables turned in March, and influenza B viruses surged from then through May.\n\nAnd often, the strains that are most commonly reported in adults are not the same ones reported in children.\n\nThis year, one of the confirmed child's deaths was caused by influenza A, and the other was due to influenza B, the CDC said.\n\nOfficials urge that the vaccine is safe, does not cause flu and is the best way to prevent potentially life-threatening infection.\n\nEach year, the flu shot is developed differently, based on the strains that health officials think are most likely to circulate.\n\nFor the 2019-2020 season, the four flu shots are quadrivalent, or designed to protect against four strains of the flu.\n\nThe shot can be given to any children over six months of age.", "description": "Officials in Monroe County, New York, have confirmed that one toddler under four has died of flu there.
