Is this really someone fit to be a Supreme Court justice?\n\nWASHINGTON \u2015 Senate Republicans are confirming so many of President Donald Trump\u2019s nominees to lifetime federal court seats, it\u2019s hard to keep up. Who are these people? What difference will they make in my life, anyway?\n\nYou\u2019re in luck: We\u2019re going to break it down here!\n\nTwo and a half years in, what stands out about Trump\u2019s confirmed judges isn\u2019t just the quantity, which is remarkable \u2015 two Supreme Court justices, a record-breaking 43 appeals court judges and 99 district court judges.\n\nIt\u2019s that a chunk of his judges shouldn\u2019t be on the bench at all because they aren\u2019t qualified or they\u2019re so ideologically extreme that it\u2019s next to impossible to imagine them as fair arbiters of justice. These judges are now on federal courts at every level, from the Supreme Court to appeals courts, which have the final say in nearly all federal cases, down to district courts, where these cases are first filed. For the appeals court judges in particular, the decisions these people make will affect you and millions of other people for generations.\n\n\u201cIt is important for the public to appreciate that appeals court appointees serve on courts that are the courts of last resort for 99.9% of cases in their regions of the U.S. on issues like capital punishment, abortion, same-sex marriage, immigration, etc.,\u201d said Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond law professor and an expert on federal judicial nominations. \u201cThe key is they resolve 50,000 cases per year and the Supreme Court resolves 100.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a snapshot of Trump\u2019s most alarming judges to date. Incredibly, all but one (Wendy Vitter) is or was a member of the Federalist Society, a conservative lawyers\u2019 group that has effectively been picking Trump\u2019s judicial nominees for him. There is a clear theme to these judges, too: They have records of being anti-LGBTQ, anti-abortion and anti-voting rights.\n\nPOOL New / Reuters Judges are supposed to \"act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the independence, integrity and impartiality of the judiciary,\" per the Judicial Code of Conduct. Does lying and lashing out at senators inspire public confidence?\n\nSupreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh\n\nCredibly accused of sexual assault\n\nKavanaugh repeatedly lied under oath in his Senate confirmation hearing and, alternating between crying, yelling and interrupting Senate committee members as they pressed him on credible sexual assault allegations against him, he blamed his rocky confirmation process on politics. Kavanaugh\u2019s unhinged behavior raised fresh questions about his temperament to be a justice on the nation\u2019s highest court. As Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) concluded in opposing him, he failed to meet the standard spelled out in the Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 1.2, which states that a judge must \u201cact at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the independence, integrity, and impartiality of the judiciary, and shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety.\u201d\n\nThe American Bar Association was prepared to revisit its previous \u201cwell qualified\u201d rating of Kavanaugh after his disastrous hearing, but Senate Republicans went ahead and confirmed him, so the group let it go. Every Republican but one, Murkowski, voted to confirm him.\n\nTom Williams via Getty Images The guy got a unanimous \"not qualified\" rating by the American Bar Association but was still confirmed to be a lifetime federal judge. OK!\n\nJudge Leonard Steven Grasz on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit\n\nUnanimously rated \u2018not qualified\u2019 by the ABA\n\nGrasz earned an embarrassing and unanimous \u201cnot qualified\u201d rating from the ABA, which has been evaluating federal judicial nominees since 1989 and rarely gives such an abysmal rating. Former colleagues described Grasz as \u201cgratuitously rude,\u201d per the ABA review, and expressed an \u201cunusual fear\u201d of consequences if they said anything bad about him because of his \u201cdeep connection\u201d to powerful politicians. ABA members also raised concerns that Grasz is \u201cunable to separate his role as an advocate from that of a judge,\u201d given his record of opposing LGBTQ and abortion rights. Every Senate Republican present voted to confirm him.\n\nBill Clark via Getty Images The ABA concluded that Jonathan Kobes was \"not qualified\" to be a federal judge because he can't WRITE. Senate Republicans confirmed him anyway.\n\nJudge Jonathan Kobes on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit\n\nRated \u201cnot qualified\u201d by the ABA\n\nKobes earned a \u201cnot qualified\u201d rating by the ABA because he \u201cwas unable to provide sufficient writing samples of the caliber required\u201d of a circuit judge. He also failed to demonstrate \u201can especially high degree of legal scholarship and excellent analytical and writing experience,\u201d per the ABA review. Kobes certainly benefited from being a former aide to Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.). Every Senate Republican but one voted to confirm him.\n\nZach Gibson via Getty Images On the one hand, Neomi Rao blamed women for being victims of date rape. On the other hand, Senate Republicans confirmed her to be a lifetime federal judge.\n\nJudge Neomi Rao on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit\n\nBlamed women for date rape\n\nRao published a series of inflammatory articles on sexual assault, race and LGBTQ rights as a Yale University student. \u201cA good way to avoid a potential date rape is to stay reasonably sober,\u201d she wrote, adding that if a woman drinks to the point where she cannot choose if she wants to have sex, \u201cgetting to that point was part of her choice.\u201d Rao also denounced \u201cspecial treatment for minority students\u201d and called the fight for LGBTQ rights a \u201ctrendy political movement.\u201d Every Senate Republican voted to confirm her.\n\nC-SPAN Where to even begin with this guy.\n\nJudge John Bush on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit\n\nCompared abortion to slavery\n\nC-Span Amy Coney Barrett thinks Roe v. Wade was \"an erroneous decision\" and also is on Trump's short list for Supreme Court nominees. Cool, cool.\n\nJudge Amy Coney Barrett on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit\n\nCalled the ACA\u2019s birth control benefit \u201can assault on religious liberty\u201d\n\nBarrett has suggested Roe v. Wade was an \u201cerroneous decision\u201d and called the Affordable Care Act\u2019s birth control benefit \u201can assault on religious liberty.\u201d She is on Trump\u2019s list of potential Supreme Court picks, which Trump said only includes people willing to overturn Roe v. Wade. The former Notre Dame law professor also sparked questions about her membership in a tightly knit Christian group called People of Praise, in which members swear a lifelong oath of loyalty and are accountable to a personal adviser \u2015 called a \u201chead\u201d for men and a \u201chandmaid\u201d for women \u2015 and are taught that husbands are the heads of their wives and should take authority over the family. Every Senate Republican voted to confirm her.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Kyle Duncan questioned the legitimacy of the Supreme Court itself when it legalized federal marriage equality. He's a lifetime federal judge now.\n\nJudge Kyle Duncan on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit\n\nDefended voter suppression law that targeted African Americans \u201cwith almost surgical precision\u201d\n\nAs an attorney, Duncan defended North Carolina\u2019s egregious voter suppression law that a federal appeals court struck down in 2016, ruling that it discriminated against black voters and \u201ctargeted African Americans with almost surgical precision.\u201d Duncan appealed the case to the Supreme Court, calling it \u201cludicrous\u201d to suggest the law echoed Jim Crow laws. The Supreme Court rejected his appeal. He also led Hobby Lobby\u2019s Supreme Court fight against covering birth control under its employee health plans, and he claimed the court\u2019s decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, which legalized marriage equality, \u201craises a question about the legitimacy of the Court.\u201d Every Senate Republican present voted to confirm him.\n\nSIPA USA/PA Images This guy published an article calling claims of sexism \"irrelevant pouting.\" Who wants to go before him as a judge the next time you sue someone for sexist treatment?\n\nJudge Kenneth Lee on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit\n\nCalled claims of sexism \u201cirrelevant pouting\u201d\n\nTom Williams via Getty Images Eric Murphy spent years trying to make it harder for minorities and low-income people to vote. Here's to Voting Rights Act lawsuits never coming before him in court!\n\nJudge Eric Murphy on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit\n\nLed efforts to make it harder for minorities to vote Murphy led repeated efforts to make it harder for minorities to vote. The former Ohio solicitor general defended getting rid of the state\u2019s \u201cGolden Week,\u201d a five-day period in which voters could register and vote at the same time, and defended Ohio\u2019s notorious voter purge law before the Supreme Court. The court upheld that law in a contentious 5-4 decision, with Justice Sonia Sotomayor writing in her dissent that the law will disproportionately make it harder for \u201cminority, low-income, disabled, homeless, and veteran voters to cast a ballot.\u201d Every Senate Republican present voted to confirm him.\n\nTom Williams via Getty Images Allison Jones Rushing, who said there were \"moral and practical reasons\" for banning same-sex marriage, is only 37. She's going to be on the federal bench for a long, long time.\n\nJudge Allison Rushing Jones on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit\n\nClaimed \u201cmoral and practical reasons\u201d for banning marriage equality Jones worked for Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian organization that has been classified as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. She has argued that there were \u201cmoral and practical\u201d reasons for banning same-sex marriage. At 37, Jones is also the youngest federal judge in the country, and some Democrats opposed her on the grounds that she lacks the experience or legal ability to be a U.S. circuit judge. Every Senate Republican voted to confirm her.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Don Willett has a track record of consistently ruling against same-sex marriage rights. For good measure, he went ahead and mocked a transgender student's participation in school sports too.\n\nJudge Don Willett on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit\n\nRegularly ruled against same-sex marriage rights\n\nTom Williams via Getty Images Eric Miller made a career out of fighting Native American tribes' rights. Now he's a federal judge on a court with jurisdiction over hundreds of tribes.\n\nJudge Eric Miller on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit\n\nMade a career out of fighting Native Americans\u2019 tribal sovereignty\n\nMiller built a legal career out of fighting tribal interests and sovereignty, so much so that one Native American leader described Miller\u2019s law firm, Perkins Coie, as the go-to destination for jurisdictions that want \u201cto fight an Indian tribe.\u201d Two prominent Native organizations \u2015 the National Congress of American Indians and the Native American Rights Fund \u2015 wrote to Judiciary Committee leaders raising concerns about Miller\u2019s advocacy for \u201cundermining the rights of Indian tribes, often taking extreme positions and using pejorative language to denigrate tribal rights.\u201d But every Senate Republican voted to confirm him. He now sits on a court with jurisdiction over 427 federally recognized tribes.\n\nCSPAN This guy, hoo boy.\n\nJudge Matthew Kacsmaryk on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas\n\nCalled being transgender \u201ca delusion\u201d Kacsmaryk called it \u201ca grave mistake\u201d to include protections for LGBTQ people in the Violence Against Women Act, and he signed a 2016 letter that called being transgender \u201ca delusion.\u201d He also criticized the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Roe v. Wade, saying \u201cseven justices of the Supreme Court found an unwritten \u2018fundamental right\u2019 to abortion hiding in the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the shadowy \u2018penumbras\u2019 of the Bill of Rights, a celestial phenomenon invisible to the non-lawyer eye.\u201d (What?) Every Senate Republican but one, Sen. Susan Collins (Maine), voted to confirm him.\n\nBill Clark via Getty Images Wendy Vitter once falsely linked abortion to cancer, and endorsed spreading the word that birth control leads to violent death. What?\n\nC-SPAN Howard Nielson once argued that a gay judge should have recused himself from a case relating to same-sex marriage because he wouldn't be a fair judge. I guess Nielson can't oversee any cases that involve straight people!\n\nJudge Howard Nielson Jr. on the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah Argued that a gay judge couldn\u2019t be fair on a same-sex marriage case As an attorney, Nielson argued that sexual orientation is a choice in his 2010 legal defense of Proposition 8, California\u2019s former ban on same-sex marriage. He also disputed evidence that discrimination against LGBTQ people leads to higher rates of depression and suicide. When a U.S. district court ruled that Prop 8 violated the Constitution, Nielson argued the judge should have recused himself because he was gay and therefore unable to be fair. Every Senate Republican but one, Susan Collins, voted to confirm him.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS This federal judge has a record of being Islamophobic, homophobic and extremely anti-abortion. A hat trick of crap!\n\nJudge Mark Norris on the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee\n\nOpposes abortion \u201cunder any circumstances\u201d\n\nC-Span When has same-sex marriage ever led to polygamy? Maybe someone will bring that lawsuit before this guy's court.\n\nJudge Stephen Clark on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri\n\nClaimed same-sex marriage leads to polygamy\n\nClark claimed that same-sex marriage leads to polygamy in a 2016 speech at Duke University, and in another 2016 speech, he criticized the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, stating that marriage equality \u201cis not an issue for nine unelected, unaccountable people with lifetime tenure \u2026 [to] be deciding because there is not a constitutional right to same-sex marriage.\u201d Clark was also on the board of directors of Lawyers for Life, which issued a 2016 flyer with Clark\u2019s name on it, declaring: \u201cRoe vs. Wade gave doctors a license to kill unborn children. Like the Dred Scott decision, Roe is BAD LAW.\u201d Every Senate Republican present voted to confirm him.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Patrick Wyrick really didn't want minors to have access to emergency contraception. He also tried to make adult women prove they were old enough to get it. What?\n\nJudge Patrick Wyrick on the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma\n\nTried to make emergency contraception access harder for minors and adults\n\nThe former Oklahoma solicitor general defended a law that would have required minors to get a prescription before buying emergency contraception and forced adult women to prove their age before they could have such contraception. The legislation was permanently blocked by a state judge in 2014. Wyrick also filed an amicus brief in the 2014 Hobby Lobby case before the Supreme Court, arguing that the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraceptive coverage mandate was unconstitutional because \u201creligious faith is more than mere belief.
