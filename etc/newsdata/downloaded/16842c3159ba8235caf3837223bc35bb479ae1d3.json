Both them and my mum told me to leave her.\n\nNatalia suffers form Spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia, a bone disorder that would prevent her from growing taller than three feet.\n\nAnna says she learned six months into her pregnancy that Natalia would be born with a \"complex pathology\".\n\n(Image: Kristine Barnett)\n\nAfter giving birth, Anna placed the newborn into an orphanage where she stayed for five years until a home was eventually found for her in the United States.\n\nShe recalled how her daughter had \"short arms and legs, with no neck\" when she was delivered.\n\n\"They said the baby would never be good, that she would never be able to move, that she would be chained to a chair or to a bed, Anna said.\n\n\"She now lives in America with adoptive parents who want to ditch her. I thought everything was okay with her and it turned out that it's not all okay.\"\n\nAnna says she now regrets putting her daughter up for adoption and begged for her to return to Ukraine when she is 18-years-old.\n\n\"Daughter, forgive me for what happened 16 years ago.
