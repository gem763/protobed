Finding a solution to a puzzle with that degree of complexity, and among billions of potentialities, involves a degree of abstract thinking that, researchers say, begins to approximate human reasoning and decision-making.\n\nAD\n\nFor years now, researchers have been programming robots to solve Rubik\u2019s Cubes as quickly as possible. But more recently, they\u2019ve begun prioritizing self-learning over speed. In July, the University of California at Irvine announced that an artificial intelligence system solved a Rubik\u2019s cube in just over a second, besting the current human world record by more than two seconds.\n\nAD\n\nThe system, known as DeepCubeA \u2014 a reinforcement-learning algorithm programmed by UCI computer scientists and mathematicians \u2014 solved the puzzle without prior knowledge of the game or coaching from its human handlers, according to the university.\n\nHighly skilled humans are able to tackle a Rubik\u2019s Cube in about 50 moves, but the AI system is able to solve the cube in about 20 moves, usually in the minimum number of steps possible, researchers said.\n\nAD\n\nThe UCI algorithm relies on a neural network \u2014 a set of algorithms designed to find underlying relationships by mimicking how the human brain processes information. The algorithm also relied on machine learning techniques, a system that allows AI to learn by identifying patterns and using inference with minimal human intervention.\n\nAD\n\nTo prepare Dactyl for Rubik\u2019s Cube success, OpenAI\u2019s researchers say they didn\u2019t \u201cexplicitly program\u201d the machine to solve the puzzle. Instead, the robot was trained using virtual simulations before it was presented with challenges in the physical world that tested it\u2019s ability to learn.\n\nThe goal, researchers say, was to create a robot that learns the way humans do \u2014 through trial and error. Eventually, those robots could be used to complete tasks \u2014 in a warehouse or perhaps on the surface of a new planet \u2014 with more autonomy. Before it could solve the puzzle, Dactyl was forced to learn how to hold and move the cube on its own. As Dactyl improved at each stage of learning, it\u2019s algorithm growing more adept, the challenges intensified.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFor example,\u201d researchers said, \u201cwe put a rubber glove on the hand, we tied some of its fingers together, we used a blanket to occlude and perturb the hand, and we poked the Rubik\u2019s cube with different objects all while it continued to try to solve the Rubik\u2019s Cube.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe system had never seen anything similar to these situations during training, researchers added.\n\nOpenAI posted a video on YouTube showing Dactyl at various points in the robot\u2019s training arc. The video captures the machine learning from scratch as it awkwardly fumbles with a Rubik\u2019s Cube and later handling the puzzle with much more control and precision.\n\nThe video\u2019s narrator says Dactyl\u2019s accomplishment could also change how researchers view training general purpose robots. Instead of thinking about creating complex algorithms for different environments, the narrator says, roboticists can instead focus on designing complex scenarios in which the machines can learn.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAt some point,\u201d the narrator adds, \u201cthen it would be more down to the imagination what robots could actually accomplish.\u201d\n\n\"The hope is to build robots that can do many different tasks to increase the standard of living and give everybody a better life,\u201d the narrator adds.\n\nMORE READING:\n\nAD", "description": "The goal, researchers say, was to create a robot that learns the way humans do \u2014 through trial and error.
