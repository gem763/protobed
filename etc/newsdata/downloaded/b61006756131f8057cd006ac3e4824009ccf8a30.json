She had died from heart failure. It was later revealed that Sado had logged 159 hours and 37 minutes of overtime at work in the month before her death. Sado\u2019s death was officially designated as a \u201cdeath from overwork\u201d.\n\nSo common are cases of people dying from overwork in Japan that the country has a special term for it, karoshi. The first case of karoshi was recorded in 1969; according to government data, Japan had 190 deaths from overwork in 2017.\n\nEarlier this year the Japanese government introduced a law limiting legal overtime work to 45 hours a month, with an extension of up to 100 hours a month in busy periods for a maximum of six months a year. But many remain doubtful it will rein in Japan\u2019s toxic overwork culture.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Workers get off a train at Churchgate station in Mumbai, India, the world\u2019s hardest-working city according to UBS.

Its index comparing work-life balance in different cities found Tokyo residents worked an average of 42 hours a week and had the earliest start time of all cities at 8:57am. But despite being notorious for long working hours, cities in Japan have relatively low productivity levels. According to the latest OECD data on productivity, which is calculated by dividing GDP per capita by the number of hours worked, Japan is the least productive country in the G7; the US is roughly 59% more productive.\n\nMeanwhile, an annual report by the Swiss bank UBS looking at the number of hours worked in different cities found Mumbai, India\u2019s largest city, to be the world\u2019s hardest-working city, clocking up the longest average working hours of 3,315 per year per worker. At the other end of the scale was Lagos, where the average worker clocked up 609 hours per year. Out of the 77 cities ranked, Tokyo came in 32nd place with an annual average of 1,997 hours, less than London (2,022) and New York (2,046).\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A crowd of commuters moves toward a staircase after exiting the subway at a metro station in Mexico City.

According to the UBS study, Mexico City is the world\u2019s third-hardest working city, with the average worker clocking up 2,622 hours per year. However, Mexico is the least productive of 38 countries listed in data from OECD \u2014 managing $18.8 (\u00a315) in GDP for every hour worked. Ireland, the most productive, creates $84 in GDP for every hour. And with an annual average of 1,856 hours, workers in Ireland\u2019s capital, Dublin, work considerably fewer hours than their counterparts in Mexico City.\n\nBut despite evidence to suggest working less hours can have a positive impact on productivity levels, overwork continues to plague many cities. The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development surveyed 5,136 people as part of its 2019 UK Working Lives Study, and found that one in four workers overwork by at least 10 hours per week. The study also revealed that one in three workers say they have too much work to complete in their job and one in five do not have the time to do their job in their allocated hours.\n\n\u201cEmployers are often resistant to the overwhelming evidence that long working hours do not equate to good performance,\u201d says Prof Gail Kinman, an occupational health psychologist from the University of Bedfordshire. \u201cIn fact, the opposite is true. The longer people work, the poorer their performance will be, resulting in poor concentration and memory, compromised problem-solving and creativity.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Studies have shown that longer working hours do not necessarily equal good performance.

How can a better work-life balance be established?\n\nAccording to the Kisi study, Singapore has the highest percentage of people working more than 48 hours a week. \u201cSingapore is overall thought to be a very liveable city, but the analysis showed that citizens have one of the highest stress scores,\u201d says Bernhard Mehl, the company\u2019s CEO.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Office workers in Singapore\u2019s financial district during evening rush hour. Photograph: Edgar Su/Reuters\n\n\u201cAfter publishing this study we\u2019ve had cities calling us to understand what they can do better, and it\u2019s really about comparing yourself to the average to see where your deficits are that could drive a change-focused agenda.\u201d In the case of Singapore, Mehl suggests that \u201coffering more programmes around mental health and shaping the conversation around stress relief might be a good idea\u201d.\n\nIn more broad terms, Kinman says it is critical to set boundaries. \u201cSwitching off from work (physically and mentally) is essential to ensure mental and physical health and a happy and fulfilling personal life,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cPlan holidays and short breaks through the year in advance; use mindfulness to help you switch off; practice self-compassion and prioritise self-care.\u201d\n\nFollow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter", "description": "Tokyo may be the most \u2018overworked\u2019 city \u2013 but there are ways to measure how hard a city works other than simply totting up the overtime", "authors": ["Matthew Keegan"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5d868ef1d7c8c770371f6d02dc7bd972eb6c768/0_171_5256_3154/master/5256.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e5993bdd69ebdef6e2c00105d7146eda", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
