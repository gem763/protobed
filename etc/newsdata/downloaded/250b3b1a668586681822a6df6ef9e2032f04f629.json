Kennedy Medical Center, the largest hospital in the capital Monrovia.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here for treatment, but the government do not want to pay the workers.\u201d\n\nThe white halls of the hospital were empty and a heavy padlock on its gate kept patients waiting outside, sitting in the street in hope of treatment.\n\nUnion officials said they had been negotiating with the government for three months before launching the strike. They plan to strike until the government adheres to their demands, they said.\n\n\u201cIf we are going to go back, we will at least need to have supplies,\u201d said George Poe Williams, secretary general of Liberia\u2019s health workers\u2019 union who estimates that 6,000 health workers are on strike.\n\n\u201cAre we supposed to return to hospitals where there are no lights and we will have to use our cell phone lights to work?\u201d\n\nRepresentatives of Liberia\u2019s health ministry declined to comment.\n\nDuring a press conference on Monday, Liberia\u2019s finance minister Samuel Tweah said that the government was doing \u201ceverything possible\u201d to clear salary payments that have been backlogged since August, and that health workers should return to their posts while the government negotiates with union leadership.\n\nPatients in critical condition who occupied beds before the strike began have been allowed to remain in the public hospitals, but all others have been either discharged prematurely or turned away upon arrival.\n\n\u201cIf anything happens to us right now, the government will be responsible,\u201d said Ruth Flomo, a pregnant 19-year-old who was turned away from the Du Port Road Health Center, another padlocked hospital.\n\n\u201cThe nurses are not helping because they are not getting paid. Their children are not going to school. They have to pay them.\u201d", "description": "A medical workers' strike in Liberia has paralysed the country's already faltering health care system, leaving its biggest hospitals in disarray and thousands of patients without care.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
