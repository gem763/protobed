But few Silicon Valley names have been tied to the disgraced financier thus far, despite his apparent effort before his arrest in July to refashion himself as a tech investor. Last month, 27 venture-capital firms told Business Insider that Epstein didn't directly invest with them.\n\nDocuments reviewed by Business Insider connect one prominent venture capitalist with Epstein, albeit two decades ago. William Elkus, who founded Santa Monica, California-based Clearstone Venture Partners, served as a trustee of one of Epstein's foundations, along with Epstein's brother Mark.\n\nJeffrey Epstein founded the J. Epstein Foundation in December 1991. Registration documents filed with the state of New York and obtained by Business Insider via a Freedom of Information Law request list Elkus as a trustee at its founding. It's unclear how long Elkus remained a trustee because the New York attorney general's office, which regulates charities, said it doesn't maintain annual tax filings from the 1990s.\n\nElkus is not listed on the foundation's earliest online tax filing, which covers 1998 to 1999, or on subsequent filings. On the earliest tax document, the trustees are the Epstein brothers and the former Bear Stearns senior managing director Ira Zicherman. Reached at home, Zicherman and his wife declined to comment. Epstein started his financial career at Bear Stearns.\n\nEpstein renamed the J. Epstein Foundation in 2000, calling it Epstein Interests, according to registration documents. Zicherman was also a trustee for Epstein Interests in its 2000-01 fiscal year, but he does not appear after that time.\n\nRead more: Jeffrey Epstein died by apparent suicide in jail. Here's everything we know about the convicted sex offender's past, famous connections, and his court case.\n\nElkus, whose notarized signature is on the J. Epstein Foundation's registration documents, declined to comment for the record in a telephone call.\n\nA source with direct knowledge of Elkus' relationship with Epstein told Business Insider that the two men knew each other socially in the late 1980s and early '90s when they were managing money for wealthy families. The source said they did not do business together.\n\nElkus went on to found Clearstone in 1998, with investments including PayPal, eToys, United Online, and Cooking.com. He is a partner and adviser to another venture-capital fund, Structural Capital, and sits on the board of councilors of the University of Southern California's Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.\n\nDana Moraly, Clearstone's chief financial officer, told Business Insider that Epstein has never been involved at Clearstone in any capacity, including as an investor or adviser. Moraly said she had not heard of him until she read media reports this year.\n\nSome people linked to Epstein in public records have denied ties to the disgraced financier. Boris Nikolic, the biotech venture capitalist, was named last month in Epstein's will as the alternate executor to his $578 million estate. Nikolic told Bloomberg he was \"shocked\" to be included.\n\n\"I was not consulted in these matters and I have no intent to fulfill these duties, whatsoever,\" he said in a statement.\n\nFoundation's beneficiaries: Miss Virgin Islands and a Harvard research center\n\nBecause records for the J. Epstein Foundation are incomplete, Business Insider was unable to assemble a comprehensive account of how much money the foundation donated and where it went.\n\nBut the following groups have either publicly identified the J. Epstein Foundation as a donor or are listed as recipients in public records:\n\nHarvard's Project Zero : Epstein had long been linked to the university, socially and philanthropically. The research center lists the J. Epstein Foundation as a donor, and some of the group's scientists have cited support from the foundation for their work too. A Harvard spokesman said that Project Zero received more than one gift from J. Epstein and affiliated foundations, but no gifts were received after 2006. All the funds have been spent.\n\n: Epstein had long been linked to the university, socially and philanthropically. The research center lists the J.

Miss Virgin Islands : According to a local report, the foundation sponsored a scholarship for the winner of the beauty pageant in 2007. The winner would \"receive the J. Epstein Foundation Scholarship; one-year full tuition, room and board at the [University of the Virgin Islands]; a scholarship and more.\" Epstein also ran a nonprofit called the J Epstein Virgin Islands Foundation and owned a private island.

Epstein Foundation and Epstein Interests gave the policy forum more than $30,000 from 1998 to 2001. Through other foundations, Epstein said he donated $180,000 to the group from 2002 to 2007, according to public records. The group did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nBoth the J.

Juilliard School : $10,000 to the prestigious New York music school. Last month, The Daily Beast reported that Epstein contacted the school seeking a student to teach him dance for exercise. One student said he flew her to Palm Beach, Florida, where she taught exercise to guests, including two Swedish models, one of whom was ex-girlfriend Eva Andersson Dubin. The dancer stayed on as his trainer for a few months, and she said he offered to pay for her tuition and equipment for the school. A spokeswoman for the school said the J. Epstein Foundation purchased a table at a 1999 gala for $10,000, but Epstein did not attend the event. Other Epstein foundations gave the school about $50,000 from 2000 to 2005.\n\n: $10,000 to the prestigious New York music school.

The main trustee for the foundation did not respond to a request for comment. Cleveland Clinic Foundation: $1,000 to the Midwestern medical center. A spokeswoman said the organization was reviewing its records.\n\nEpstein ran at least five foundations and gave millions to a variety of organizations over at least 20 years, including arts groups, colleges, medical researchers, and think tanks. Some of those groups have returned the money or are considering doing so in the wake of Epstein's July charges of conspiracy and sex trafficking. On August 10, Epstein died by suicide while being held at Manhattan's Metropolitan Correctional Center.\n\nRecently, the MIT Media Lab has been in turmoil after revelations that its director, Joichi Ito, had received money from Epstein for the research center and for his venture-capital funds since 2013 \u2014 well after Epstein went to jail on charges including procuring a minor for prostitution. Ito resigned on Saturday, less than a day after an article in the New Yorker described Epstein's relationship with him and MIT. At least two MIT scholars have publicly quit, citing Epstein's ties to Ito.\n\nDo you have a story to share about Epstein?
