His proposed remedy has been a universal basic income (UBI) of $1,000 for each person living in the United States over the age of 18. He\u2019s argued that this monetary guarantee would allow people to spend more time engaging in hobbies or providing a basic level of financial security when the jobs of auto manufacturers or semi truck drivers may be insecure.\n\nUBI \u201chelps all Americans\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month. It recognizes the work in our families and communities,\u201d Yang said. \u201cIt helps all Americans.\u201d\n\nDuring the debate, candidates Jul\u00edan Castro and Tulsi Gabbard said that Yang\u2019s UBI proposal was a good idea, and something they would consider if elected president, stopping short of fully endorsing it.\n\nOther more prominent candidates like Elizabeth Warren argued that beefing up social security would be a more effective plan, making it easier for aging workers to plan for retirement. She also pointed to her bigger policy proposals like one that sets the stage for \u201caccountable capitalism,\u201d and ensures that workers elect at least 40% of corporate board members. Warren said that in doing so, those members would be more obligated to vote in favor of not automating jobs or moving them to other countries like China or Mexico.\n\nBernie Sanders argued in favor of a federal jobs guarantee, something he\u2019s supported for most of his campaign. Sanders was the only candidate endorsing such a plan on stage Tuesday night. Cory Booker challenged Yang, suggesting that increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 would be a more effective remedy rather than universal basic income.", "description": "Automation is entrepreneur Yang\u2019s pet issue and one that he\u2019s pushed into the mainstream presidential policy discussion over the past few months.
