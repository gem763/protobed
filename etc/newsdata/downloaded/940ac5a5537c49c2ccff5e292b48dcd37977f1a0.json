I was with my boyfriend at the time and was like, 'I really haven't been making dates with someone else'.\"\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX)\n\nShe continued: \"We rang the florist and they couldn't tell us because of client confidentiality. I had to get the police involved to find out who it was. Even then they couldn't do anything about it.\"\n\nThe soap babe is now in a relationship with boyfriend Scott, who is in the armed forces.\n\nSpeaking of her romance with Scott, the star admitted \"it's hard\" and she takes her hat off to the women of servicemen.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nHe's away on tour at the moment for six months, and she confessed he'll be back for two weeks.\n\n\"We've only been together for 18 months and he's been away twice. I take my hat off to the women of servicesmen. They do really support them while they're out there.\n\n\"I try to support him, I send him parcels. The contact while he is there is really good but you can't speak for a month if he goes to Kenya. It's hard.\"\n\nShe is set to say goodbye to Coronation Street, and will film her final scenes in the coming weeks after 13 years on the cobbles.", "description": "Kym Marsh has said a catfish was pretending to be her for almost 10 years - and it almost ruined her then relationship", "authors": ["Brogan-Leigh Hurst", "Image", "Ken Mckay Itv Rex", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20752050.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_This-Morning-TV-show-London-UK-29-Oct-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
