Add Boeing as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Boeing news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nIn a document obtained by ABC News, Boeing's chief technical pilot, Mark Forkner, told a colleague that the plane's MCAS system was \"running rampant in the sim on me.\" Forkner said in the messages that in the simulation the MCAS was \"trimming itself craxy,\" likely meaning \"crazy,\" and that it was \"egregious.\" News of the internal messages was reported earlier by The New York Times.\n\nThe maneuvering characteristics augmentation system, or MCAS, is an automated flight control system designed to change the angle of an airplane to prevent a stall. Faulty MCAS systems are believed to have caused the Lion Air crash in Indonesia, which killed 189 last October, and the Ethiopian Air disaster in March that killed 157.\n\nJason Redmond/AFP via Getty Images, FILE\n\nAfter those incidents, the aircraft was grounded pending additional safety certifications.\n\nThe FAA obtained the messages last night in a document from Boeing, and FAA Administrator Steve Dickson sent a letter to Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg requesting an immediate explanation. Dickson also requested an explanation about the delay in disclosing the document to the FAA because it was his understanding that \"Boeing discovered the document in its files months ago.\"\n\nIn a statement, the FAA said that the agency finds the document's contents disturbing and that regulators are \"disappointed that Boeing did not bring this document to our attention immediately upon its discovery.\"\n\nLindsey Wasson/Reuters, FILE\n\nPeter DeFazio, D-Ore., chair of the House Transportation committee, said in a statement that the conversation between Boeing employees is \"shocking, but disturbingly consistent with what we've seen so far in our ongoing investigation of the 737 Max, especially with regard to production pressures and a lack of candor with regulators and customers.\"\n\nMuilenburg is scheduled to appear before Congress later this month.\n\n\"Over the past several months, Boeing has been voluntarily cooperating with the House Transportation & Infrastructure Committee\u2019s investigation into the 737 Max,\" the company said in a statement on Friday. \"As part of that cooperation, today we brought to the Committee\u2019s attention a document containing statements by a former Boeing employee. We will continue to cooperate with the Committee as it continues its investigation. And we will continue to follow the direction of the FAA and other global regulators, as we work to safely return the 737 Max to service.\"", "description": "In one text, a Boeing pilot said performance of a critical system was", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/boeing-737-planes-rt-ps-191018_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
