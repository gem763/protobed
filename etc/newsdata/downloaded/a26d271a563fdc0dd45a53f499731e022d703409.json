They're also acquiring other companies and co-mingling [personal data those companies have] into their [own database].\"\n\n\"I think at that point, because they're now doing that, that they probably should be broken up ... because they're having an undue influence as the largest social media platform on the planet.\"\n\nBenioff took particular umbrage at Facebook's recent decision to run political advertisements from the Trump campaign containing false claims about Ukraine and the Biden family. He urged Congress to pass legislation that would require truthful advertising on social media platforms, and said there is \"no question\" he would not run such advertisements himself.\n\n\"I think this is extremely important in the age of social media. That's the insight from the 2016 election. It's a very vulnerable moment right now,\" he added, referencing Russia's use of Facebook to interfere with the 2016 election.\n\nRead more: Ousted WeWork CEO Adam Neumann 'is a great entrepreneur,' says Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff\n\nThe 55-year-old has previously criticized Facebook on the grounds of its perceived addictiveness, describing the platform as \"the new cigarettes\" during at talk at the 2018 World Economic Forum.\n\nFacebook's David Marcus has defended the Libra cryptocurrency project this week after several firms associated with the project cut ties. Getty/Brian Ach/Stringer\n\nBenioff is far from the only big name to have called for Facebook's dissolution, with Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren and Facebook cofounder Chris Hughes both taking shots at the firm in 2019. Last week, Facebook moved to publicly call out Warren, tagging her in a tweet after she criticized Facebook on similar grounds to Benioff by running a deliberately fake ad.\n\nHis remarks could hardly come at a less convenient time for Facebook, either, after a chastening week for its Libra cryptocurrency project.\n\nDespite only being announced in June, the project has lost a slew of backers in the past week. Seven of twenty-eight founding members have now revoked their membership of the Libra Association \u2013 the group of firms formally interested in building and developing Libra, its proposed cryptocurrency.\n\nAfter Mastercard, Visa and Stripe all dropped out in the past week, Facebook's Libra chief, David Marcus, spoke out in defence of the project this week. On Tuesday he told Yahoo Finance that Libra was \"absolutely not\" in jeopardy, adding that the project is \"going to get harder before it gets easier.\"\n\nBusiness Insider has contacted Facebook for comment.", "description": "In an interview with CNN on Wednesday, Marc Benioff launched a stinging critique of Facebook and called for it to be \"broken up.\"", "authors": ["Charlie Wood"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da5cf6fcc4a0a34fa767794?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
