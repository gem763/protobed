Bonus points! Going to said farmers\u2019 market by bicycle? Well, what can I say!\n\nIf this all sounds a bit sarcastic, I\u2019m sorry.\n\nI am not trying to say that these things don\u2019t count and that you might as well give up and go live barefoot in Bali until the world comes tumbling down around you.\n\nI am not trying to make you feel that these steps you are taking to live a kinder life are meaningless.\n\nFar from it!\n\nWe need more people like you, who care about the Earth and who are willing to do what it takes to live a greener life.\n\nWhat I\u2019m saying is: don\u2019t get complacent. There\u2019s probably always something else you can be doing.\n\nAs you learn more, you can do more. Everything we do, all the choices we make, shape the kind of world we live in.\n\nAsk yourself: how is that little Summer dress so cheap? Fast fashion is a nasty thing.\n\nThese cheap clothes that we buy just means that someone else has paid for it, with terrible working conditions, slave wages, serious exploitation.\n\nWe need to educate ourselves about everything. I know it\u2019s a pain, and it\u2019s much nicer not to know.\n\nSometimes you just want to buy a packet of chips! You don't want to have to think about the orang-utans losing their homes and their lives to palm oil plantations.\n\nBut once you know something, you can\u2019t un-know it.\n\nEspecially not if you have a daughter reminding you about slave children and slave monkeys. Slave monkeys! I kid you not.\n\nThat thrifted polyester top you found at the vintage shop is still shedding plastic microfibers every time you wash it, which end up in our waterways.\n\nYour coffee might be organic, but is it also fair Trade? Are the people picking those coffee beans being treated fairly?\n\nWhat about your chocolate? The R30 you paid for that almond latte you\u2019re sipping from your reusable cup cost more than many people\u2019s food budget for the day.\n\nBe aware of your privilege, and see how you can use it to help others.\n\nIt never ends and it\u2019s hard! I admit that it\u2019s not easy to do the \u201cright\u201d thing.\n\nI can\u2019t remember how often I used to forget my shopping bags at first. I\u2019d mentally kick myself, and then just take the plastic bags on offer.\n\nIt takes time to form new habits, and to learn to consider all the possible impacts your choices have.\n\nI\u2019m fortunate to have a daughter on hand who is not shy to educate me on all aspects of what we should and shouldn't be doing.\n\nSomeone who reads the labels on EVERYTHING, who can tell what fabric something is made from by just having a quick feel; who can read \u201cpalm oil\u201d in all languages ever, including Arabic!\n\nNeedless to say, we haven't had a biscuit from the shops in a loooong time. I\u2019ve even started buying some of my clothes secondhand.\n\nOld dogs, new tricks, what can I say?\n\nAlso read: These teens and young adults want their day in court on climate change\n\nSo, go ahead, make these changes.\n\nEducate yourself.\n\nQuestion everything.\n\nThere is a lot of information available out there for people wanting to make better personal choices. But I am saying that it is never going to be enough.\n\nNo matter how many things you change in your personal life, it is not going to add up to a whole heap of beans if we don\u2019t also have Political Change.\n\nWhat we need to be doing, apart from all these admirable, and necessary, personal changes, is to demand the end of the system that has brought us to this point \u2014 the system that is built on the destruction of our world, on extracting every last bit from our\n\nEarth, leaving us with a degraded (dare I say, desecrated?) world.\n\nTo desecrate means to treat something with violent disrespect; to spoil something which is valued or respected. Is that not how we\u2019ve treated Mother Earth?\n\nWe need a society of caring, informed individuals, doing what we can to live as good a life as we can, coming together with fierce determination, fighting to change this toxic system that we live in.\n\nWhat we cannot do, is to fool ourselves into believing that it is ONLY down to our personal choices, that we can save the world if only we can get everyone to stop using plastic, to bring their shopping bags, to reduce, reuse, recycle.\n\nDon't fall for that! We need you NOW, not only once you've attained Green Sainthood.\n\nPersonal change is a necessary starting point, but we need to go beyond that.\n\nWe need to demand Political Change as well.\n\nWe need those in power to take the Climate Crisis seriously and to start treating it like the crisis it is.\n\nWe need to stand together to demand, and to imagine, a better world, to form the communities which will build this better world.\n\nWe are not going to survive this Climate Crisis alone.\n\nWe are going to need our neighbours and our communities.\n\nLet\u2019s start talking to our friends and our families about climate breakdown.\n\nWe have to look this scary thing right in the face. Don\u2019t turn away. Time is running out fast.\n\nWe have to stand up and fight for our lives. We are the ones we\u2019ve been waiting for!\n\nSee you on the streets?\n\nChat back:\n\nShare your story with us, and we could publish your mail.
