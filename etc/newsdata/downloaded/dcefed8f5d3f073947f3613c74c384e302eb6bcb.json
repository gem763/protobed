The deal increased Citadel\u2019s debt while directing hundreds of millions of dollars to Mr. Griffin. While he owns the vast majority of the equity in the management company, a person familiar with Citadel said dividends also will be distributed to other equity holders for their personal use.\n\nMr. Griffin, who started investing as a 19-year-old in his Harvard dorm room, earlier this year drew attention after buying a Manhattan penthouse for $238 million. The deal for the roughly 24,000-square-foot apartment bordering Central Park, a pied-\u00e0-terre for the 50-year-old Mr. Griffin, set a record price for a home sold in the U.S.\n\nThe deal followed other record-breaking real-estate purchases the multibillionaire has made in recent years in London, Chicago and Miami Beach. A spokesman for Citadel said in a statement Mr. Griffin \u201cspends a considerable amount of time in New York and London\u201d given the firm\u2019s presence in each city. In the art world, Mr. Griffin made waves in 2016 with his $500 million deal for a pair of paintings by Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning.\n\nMr. Griffin also has made big-ticket donations to Harvard University and the University of Chicago and has said he plans to give at least a billion dollars to higher education over the rest of his lifetime to keep the U.S. competitive.\n\nInvestors showed appetite for Citadel\u2019s new bonds. The debt was sold at a yield that was 3.25 percentage points above the comparable U.S. Treasury note\u2014less than the 3.33 spread on the company\u2019s first bonds issued in 2017, according to LCD, a unit of S&P Global Market Intelligence. A lower spread signals greater confidence among investors that a bond will be fully repaid at maturity.\n\nThe 2017 bonds also raised $500 million for the purpose of paying dividends.\n\nA Citadel spokesman said in a statement, \u201cThe capital markets have recognized the strength of our hedge-fund management business by participating in our most recent debt issuance.\u201d\n\nAfter standing on the brink of collapse in 2008 during the financial crisis, Citadel reached its high-water mark, or the point at which its investors were made whole, in 2012. It now manages about $32 billion and amplifies bets its teams of traders make with the heavy use of borrowed money. The firm has a reputation for rapid change at its business units and within its executive levels.\n\nCitadel\u2019s flagship multistrategy hedge fund, Wellington, was up 14.3% this year through August, said a person familiar with the firm. Hedge funds, on average, gained 7.8% over the same period, according to research firm HFR.\n\nWrite to Juliet Chung at juliet.chung@wsj.com and Sam Goldfarb at sam.goldfarb@wsj.com", "description": "The management company of the hedge-fund giant founded by Kenneth Griffin sold $500 million in investment-grade bonds earlier this month to fund a dividend to its owners.", "authors": ["Juliet Chung", "Sam Goldfarb", "Juliet.Chung Wsj.Com", "Sam.Goldfarb Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109953/social", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
