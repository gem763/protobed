Most people haven\u2019t. Despite its name, it\u2019s not a dating app. It\u2019s something that\u2019s considerably less fun \u2014 but much more important. And its work could loom large over the presidential election.\n\nThe committee, you see, is part of the National Bureau of Economic Research, a nongovernment, nonpartisan organization of academic economists. The committee\u2019s nine members, all of whom are academics, issue the definitive rulings on whether a recession has begun or ended. And when that happened.\n\nGiven the huge hit that his reelection prospects would take if we\u2019re in a recession before Election Day next year, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me for Trump to begin lobbying the committee. Publicly, of course.\n\nTrump could well tweet out a command that the committee declare that the U.S. economy is wonderful and great, that trade wars are helping growth and that there\u2019s nothing resembling a recession in sight.\n\nSure, the idea of the president of the United States trying to force a group of academic economists to say what he wants to hear sounds ridiculous. But then again, who would have ever thought that we\u2019d see a president repeatedly ridiculing the Federal Reserve and demanding that it sharply cut short-term interest rates?\n\n[Trump\u2019s company could save millions if interest rates fall as he demands]\n\nTrump\u2019s opponents, who are hoping that the interest rate inversion means that a recession is at hand, may well lobby the committee, too. But I think they\u2019d be more discreet than Trump. Well, who wouldn\u2019t be?\n\nSo before the committee becomes a topic of public debate driven by people with short attention spans, let\u2019s talk about what a recession actually is.\n\nAnd let\u2019s also talk about why I don\u2019t expect to see a committee recession ruling before Election Day next year. Not because of political considerations but because of how the committee works.\n\nMany people think that a recession consists of two straight quarters of decline in what economists call \u201creal\u201d gross domestic product. \u201cReal\u201d means adjusted for inflation. So if the economy were to grow 2 percent at a time of 3 percent inflation, we\u2019d have a decline in real GDP.\n\nThe bureau\u2019s definition of a recession is far more insightful and worth reading in full.\n\nIt goes like this: \u201cThe NBER does not define a recession in terms of two consecutive quarters of decline in real GDP. Rather, a recession is a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales.\u201d\n\nBob Hall, a Stanford economics professor who has chaired the committee since it was established in 1978, told me that one reason for the complex definition is that it\u2019s possible to have very small declines in real GDP for two quarters without the economy as a whole going into decline.\n\nThis multi-factor definition means that it takes the committee a good while after the economy has peaked or bottomed to issue its rulings. For example, it took the committee until Sept. 20, 2010, to declare that the Great Recession, which began in December 2007, ended in June 2009.\n\nAt the time, the ruling was controversial in certain quarters. Barack Obama talked about how even though the committee had ruled that the U.S. economy had recovered, millions of people were still a lot worse off than they had been.\n\nHall agreed that many people were in fact worse off and that the recovery was weak but, nevertheless, an economic recovery had been underway for more than a year.\n\nOn average, it has taken the committee slightly more than a year after a turn in the economy to issue a ruling.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re patient,\u201d Hall says. \u201cWe\u2019re not out to make headlines. We\u2019re content to have people say \u2018finally\u2019 \u201d when a ruling emerges.\n\nIt\u2019s going to be interesting to watch the current situation play out.\n\nEven if the economy is close to entering a recession or already in one \u2014 both of which are far from clear \u2014 it would take months of economic slowdown to meet the committee\u2019s recession criteria. And then it would probably take about a year \u2014 or more \u2014 for the committee to feel comfortable saying that the economy\u2019s in recession.\n\nSo even though I think that the committee will be in the news one of these days, I don\u2019t expect to see it make news by issuing a \u201cwe\u2019re in a recession\u201d ruling before Election Day 2020.\n\nI don\u2019t know whether we\u2019ll be in a recession when that day rolls around next year. But what I do know is that now, before the shrieking starts, is the best time for us to hook up with how the recession arbiters at the Business Cycle Dating Committee look at the world.\n\nAlice Crites contributed to this report.\n\n[]", "description": "We should all know what the Business Cycle Dating Committee is and how it works.
