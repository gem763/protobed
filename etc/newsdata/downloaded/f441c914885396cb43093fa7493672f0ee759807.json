Futures were again on the back foot Monday.\n\n\u201cA recession is avoidable but recurring drawdowns are not,\u201d Normand wrote. That\u2019s thanks to President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cimpulsiveness and the scope for miscalculation when wielding untested policy tools like tariffs, export bans and capital flow restrictions,\u201d he said.\n\nThough the S&P 500 has -- just barely -- escaped entering down-20%, bear territory since the market ructions that began in early 2018, there\u2019s been a cumulative toll from the episodes of pain since then, JPMorgan highlighted. The total return for the index in that period is less than 2 percentage points more than for cash.\n\nAhead of the current drawdown, JPMorgan analysis shows that positioning was \u201creasonably neutral-to-defensive.\u201d As for valuations, a multi-asset portfolio showed that the \u201covershoot\u201d relative to what global growth normally implies was only modest, Normand wrote. Meantime, market depth -- or the degree of reliance on just a small group to drive gains -- is \u201cbelow average\u201d for U.S. stocks, but with positioning not extreme poses less of a worry, he concluded.\n\n\u201cThe message across all indicators is that this correction is about half complete, and should prove much shallower than last year\u2019s,\u201d Normand wrote.\n\nHe cautioned that \u201cthe great rotations many hope for,\u201d such as out of bonds and into equities, or from developed markets to emerging ones and defensive shares to cyclicals, would probably take a major impetus. Think much more Federal Reserve easing, a rollback in tariffs or sizeable fiscal stimulus from the likes of Germany and China.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Christopher Anstey in Tokyo at canstey@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Christopher Anstey at canstey@bloomberg.net, Joanna Ossinger\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- A range of indicators including investor positioning before the most recent slump in markets suggests that the drawdown is about half finished, and will prove to be less painful than the rout last December, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysis.\u201cSince corrections tend to be largest", "authors": ["Christopher Anstey"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qeVq6wZGiswqqoJafZPnLA--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/b54f7ca746a6a481af26c7582bb565b0", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
