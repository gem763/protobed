Say, a blindfold for cats or a portable urinal for children.\n\nOne of the major culprits for these seemingly inexplicable product ads on social media has been Wish.com.\n\nThe online retailer has grown leaps and bounds since its parent company, ContextLogic, was founded in 2010. It was recently valued at nearly $11.2 billion USD, or $15 billion CAD. The company's mobile app is regularly ranked as one of the top shopping apps from both the Apple and Google app stores.\n\nWhat's going on at Wish?\n\nThe company positions itself as going after \"value conscious\" customers, with messaging boasting of thousands of normally pricey items available at price points in the single digits.\n\nBut it's become far more notorious for the odd advertisements it places on Facebook, with entire social media accounts dedicated to explaining and identifying Wish products.\n\nHave you ever ripped off some toilet paper and then wished you had way less? <br>Well then I think this is the product for you.<br><br>Just make sure you wash your hands after you use it. <a href=\"https://t.co/VmQgyRoiz3\">pic.twitter.com/VmQgyRoiz3</a> \u2014@WishAdGuesses\n\nWith more than a billion dollars in revenue in recent years, the advertising strategy is working, despite some of those tactics coming straight out of a medium thought to be on the decline.\n\nSocial media as the new infomercial\n\nWish advertisements \u2014 along with many of their fellow social media commercial messages \u2014 use a lot of the same methods as late night TV infomercials once did.\n\nThey serve to manufacture and create a need in the consumer for their product \u2014 because that requirement may not have been obvious before.\n\nSome Wish products are admittedly less strange than others. (Wish.com screengrab)\n\nCase in point: very few consumers may realize they need or want the unusual products on Wish.\n\nIn the case of a Wish ad for compression undergarments, you could see an overweight man struggling to put on pants in an awkward looking image, then miraculously the Wish product shows him looking fit and trim.\n\nThe model was perfected by the infomercial, according to television director Rentia van der Bijl.\n\n\"It's the same principle. It's just the medium that differs,\" said van der Bijl.\n\n\"You create a need by showing someone what a potential problem would be.\"\n\nThis gentleman, as depicted in an infomercial, can't seem to keep his food on his tray. (GIPHY)\n\nA notorious example of this in infomercials are the monochrome montages that often show a problem you may not have previously considered.\n\nThe Wish counterpart would be showing outlandish images in a slideshow or short video, followed by an image of the product solving whatever was depicted in said outlandish image.\n\nWish product advertisements try to \"create a need\" by demonstrating their value and their use \u2014 otherwise you might not know that you needed a vacuum for your face. (Wish.com screengrab)\n\n\"It's as if people would think oh I don't want that problem. So here's a solution, and I want the solution,\" said van der Bijl.\n\nIt's all moving online\n\nThe shift from television to online for infomercial-style products is confirmed by one of the big players in the market for products that used to be exclusively seen on television.\n\n\"I believe infomercials are going online, and they're going online in different forms,\" said Samir Kulkarni, CEO of retail chain Showcase.\n\n\"So the format is quite different. A Facebook ad is typically much shorter\u2026 because people can easily scroll past it,\" explained Kulkarni.\n\nShowcase runs more than 100 outlets across Canada and the United States, might be better known as the \"As Seen on TV\" stores in your local mall.\n\nAccording to Kulkarni, a lot of the advertising dollars that once went to infomercials now go toward online platforms.\n\n\"If we say 15 years ago that television was 100 percent of the [advertising] spend from us and from our advertisers, I would say that today it's closer to 50 percent and on its way to 25 percent,\" said Kulkarni.", "description": "Online advertisements \u2014 such as those from Wish\u00a0\u2014 use a lot of the\u00a0same methods as late night TV infomercials.", "authors": ["Cbc Radio"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5292450.1569022342!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/wish-ads.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
