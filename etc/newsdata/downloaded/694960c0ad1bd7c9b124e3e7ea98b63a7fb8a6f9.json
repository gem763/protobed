Four of the strains can cause severe illness in humans and animals. The fifth, Reston virus, has caused illness in some animals, but not in humans.\n\nEbola is extremely infectious but not extremely contagious. It is infectious, because an infinitesimally small amount can cause illness. Laboratory experiments on nonhuman primates suggest that even a single virus may be enough to trigger a fatal infection.\n\nEbola could be considered moderately contagious because the virus is not transmitted through the air.\n\nHumans can be infected by other humans if they come in contact with body fluids from an infected person or contaminated objects from infected persons . Humans can also be exposed to the virus, for example, by butchering infected animals.\n\nWhile the exact reservoir of Ebola viruses is still unknown, researchers believe the most likely natural hosts are fruit bats\n\nSymptoms of Ebola typically include : weakness, fever, aches, diarrhea, vomiting and stomach pain. Additional experiences include rash, red eyes, chest pain, throat soreness, difficulty breathing or swallowing and bleeding (including internal).\n\nTypically, symptoms appear eight to 10 days after exposure to the virus, but the incubation period can span two to 21 days.\n\nUnprotected health care workers are susceptible to infection because of their close contact with patients during treatment.\n\nEbola is not transmissible if someone is asymptomatic and usually not after someone has recovered from it. However, the virus has been found in semen for up to three months, and \"possibly\" is transmitted from contact with that semen, according to the CDC.\n\nDeadly human Ebola outbreaks have been confirmed in the following countries: Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Gabon, South Sudan, Ivory Coast, Uganda, Republic of the Congo (ROC), Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.\n\nThere are five subspecies of the Ebola virus: Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV), Bundibugyo ebolavirus (BDBV), Sudan ebolavirus (SUDV), Ta\u00ef Forest ebolavirus (TAFV) and Reston ebolavirus (RESTV).\n\nClick here for the CDC's list of known cases and outbreaks.\n\n2014-2016 West Africa Outbreak :\n\n(Full historical timeline at bottom) (Full historical timeline at bottom)\n\nMarch 25, 2014 - The The CDC issues its initial announcement on an outbreak in Guinea, and reports of cases in Liberia and Sierra Leone. \"In Guinea, a total of 86 suspected cases, including 59 deaths (case fatality ratio: 68.5%), had been reported as of March 24, 2014.
