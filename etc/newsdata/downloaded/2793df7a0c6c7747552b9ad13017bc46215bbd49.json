Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nWhat can working on titles like Terrace House, Rilakkuma and Godzilla: Monster Planet teach you about selling anime?\n\nEverything, according to Julian Lai-Hung, the CEO of Singapore-based startup BlockPunk, a blockchain platform for anime artists.\n\nThe platform, which lets anime creators sell limited-edition art directly to fans while protecting and tracking their copyrights, is also home to the world\u2019s first tokenised anime film, Vevara In Your Dream, which launched earlier in July at the Los Angeles Anime Expo.\n\nThe platform, which raised US$13 million in its latest funding round, currently boasts about 200 anime creators, including Nao Hirasawa (Monster Strike, Promare) and anime studio ARCH (Inuyashiki, Yuri On Ice).\n\nUsers are mostly male and hail primarily from Japan, the US, China and India, said Lai-Hung, who was formerly global anime head at Netflix.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke to the founder on the sidelines of Innovfest Unbound in June.\n\nHere\u2019re the the top three lessons working at the video-streaming giant taught him:\n\n#1: Films are so hard to make, it is a miracle they even get made at all\n\ncaption Anime fans can only view the film Vevara In Your Dream by paying for it in cryptocurrency. source BlockPunk\n\nLai-Hung said working at Netflix gave him a healthy respect for creators and the immense amount of work that goes into making a series.\n\n\u201cTheir job is the hardest in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cFilms require so much money and a mini-army of people to make them happen. They\u2019re so hard to make, it is a miracle they even get made at all.\u201d\n\nLai-Hung said the existing payments process in the industry (\u201cnotoriously opaque and slow\u201d) made him want to ensure creators get properly credited and compensated for their work.\n\n#2: Pirated merchandise is huge because creators hate running businesses\n\ncaption Limited-edition art sold on the platform is recorded on a blockchain. source BlockPunk\n\nAnime fans around the world usually stream new series as soon as they become available, Lai-Hung said. Then they fall in love with the characters and want merchandise right away.\n\nUnfortunately, there is often a lag between when a series is released and when its merch becomes available.\n\n\u201cCreators are not good at operating a storefront and dealing with customers. They just want to make art and interact with fans, not build and manage websites,\u201d Lai-hung said.\n\nBut with merch accounting for almost half of the US$20-billion anime industry, this has resulted in a huge market in pirated goods.\n\nLai-Hung said the some studios are now trying to plug the gap by selling their merch on platforms like his, which carries little business risk.\n\nBut cryptocurrencies can seem way harder to navigate than a Netflix subscription \u2013 so is blockchain getting in the way of attracting users?\n\nNo, Lai-Hung says. \u201cAnime fans are tech savvy. We got a massive positive response when the platform first launched, and even the studios said they were very excited.\u201d\n\n#3: Thanks to Netflix, people get a say in what they want to watch\n\ncaption By tracking what people are watching, creators can find out what kind of content is popular \u2013 and what\u2019s not. source Pexels\n\nPreviously, distribution channels were controlled by a few big names \u2013 but Netflix disrupted the industry because for the first time, films were being streamed directly to viewers, Lai-Hung said.\n\nThis means viewing data is now king \u2013 with their popularity determining which series to continue and which get dropped.\n\nHowever, he let on that even the streaming giant frustrated filmmakers by keeping viewing data \u2013 and therefore films\u2019 performance \u2013 a secret.\n\nAs for BlockPunk, it will let creators interact with fans directly, and track their own sales \u2013 so they can know right away what\u2019s selling and what\u2019s not.\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - \"Films are so hard to make, it is a miracle they even get made at all.\".
