REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/File Photo/File Photo\n\nPayPal said it would forgo any further participation in the group and would instead focus on its own core businesses.\n\n\u201cWe remain supportive of Libra\u2019s aspirations and look forward to continued dialogue on ways to work together in the future,\u201d PayPal said in a statement.\n\nIn response, Geneva-based Libra Association said it was aware of the challenges lying ahead in its attempts to \u201creconfigure\u201d the financial system.\n\n\u201cThe type of change that will reconfigure the financial system to be tilted towards people, not the institutions serving them, will be hard. Commitment to that mission is more important to us than anything else. We\u2019re better off knowing about this lack of commitment now, rather than later\u201d, Libra Association said in a statement. Facebook Inc (FB.O) declined to comment.\n\nFacebook announced plans to launch the digital currency in June 2020 in partnership with other members of Libra Association but the project quickly ran into trouble with skeptical regulators around the world.\n\nReuters reported last week that Facebook could push back the launch of Libra to tackle regulatory concerns.\n\nVisa (V.N) and Mastercard Inc (MA.N) are also reconsidering their involvement in Libra as they do not want to attract regulatory scrutiny, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month.\n\nFrance and Germany last month pledged to block Libra from operating in Europe and backed the development of a public cryptocurrency instead.\n\nWith the exit of PayPal, Libra Association now has 28 members, including Uber Technologies Inc (UBER.N), Lyft Inc (LYFT.O) and Spotify Technologies (SPOT.N).\n\n\u201cWe look forward to the first Libra Council meeting in 10 days and will be sharing updates following that, including details of the 1,500 entities that have indicated enthusiastic interest to participate,\u201d Libra Association said in a tweet.", "description": "U.S. payments processor PayPal Holdings Inc said on Friday it was leaving Libra Association, the entity managing the Facebook-led effort to build global digital currency Libra, making it the first member to exit the group.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1437176393&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF931JR", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
