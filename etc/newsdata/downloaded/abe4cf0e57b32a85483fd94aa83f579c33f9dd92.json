Will Trump and McConnell give it to them? Photo: Luke Sharrett/Getty Images\n\nDays after the Senate began its August recess, a pair of mass shootings in Ohio and New Mexico led, once again, to calls for Congress to \u201cdo something\u201d about mass shootings in America. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell resisted demands at the time that he bring the Senate back to Washington, insisting that lawmakers would work on the issue over the break so they could return in September \u201cand go forward and make a law.\u201d\n\nSeptember\u2019s now here and there\u2019s no evidence Congress will do anything. That\u2019s not for a lack of effort from Democrats, who have made gun-control legislation their top priority this fall. They\u2019re pushing in particular for expanded background checks, which passed the House in February. But McConnell has held up that legislation in the Senate, refusing to do anything on gun issues without first knowing if President Trump backs it.\n\nBut what Trump supports is not easy to nail down. Trump appeared open to expanding background checks in the aftermath of the Ohio and New Mexico shootings, but quickly backtracked. He\u2019s shown himself unable to resist the demands of the NRA, despite public polling showing 89 percent of Americans approve of stronger background-check laws.\n\nThis week, the White House is expected to put forward a package of gun-related measures that seem more like feigning action than attempting to stop mass killings. Among Trump\u2019s plans are expediting the death penalty for mass shooters and requiring the FBI to tell local police when someone fails a background check.\n\nRepublican frustration with Trump\u2019s lack of clarity on the issue has started to spill into public. Senators are anonymously complaining about Trump\u2019s inability to define what he\u2019s for and going on Sunday talk shows to implore him to make his preferences clear. \u201cThe president needs to step up here and set some guidelines for what he would do,\u201d Missouri senator Roy Blunt said on Meet the Press over the weekend.\n\nBut the White House doesn\u2019t deserve all the blame. Senate Republicans are also abdicating their responsibly. They\u2019re terrified of acting without Trump\u2019s approval and live in fear of angering his ravenous base. They acknowledge the popularity of gun-control measures, especially with the suburban voters who are abandoning the GOP en masse, but they\u2019re too afraid of Trump\u2019s base to split with him, The Hill reports:\n\nMcConnell doesn\u2019t want to allow any daylight to emerge between Senate Republicans and Trump, who maintains an approval rating among Republican voters north of 80 percent.\n\nHe and other Republicans want Trump to provide political cover so they can pass a package with reduced risk of an angry backlash from their right flank.\n\nSo they\u2019re left waiting for Trump to tell them what to do. Meanwhile, Trump is so irrationally afraid of his base that he\u2019s unlikely to do anything at all. And so, as ever when it comes to the issue of guns and mass shootings, it looks like nothing will be done.", "description": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is ceding the Senate\u2019s power to act on gun control legislation the White House, saying Senate Republicans won\u2019t pass new gun measures unless they have Trump\u2019s approval.", "authors": ["Adam K.
