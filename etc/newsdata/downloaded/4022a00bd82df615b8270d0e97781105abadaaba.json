REUTERS/Shailesh Andrade/Files\n\nThe broader NSE Nifty .NSEI was down 0.50% at 11,257.60 by 1317 local time (0747 GMT), while the benchmark BSE Sensex .BSESN was lower by 0.41% at 37,951.82.\n\nBoth indexes had risen roughly 0.4% each earlier in the day before the rate cuts were announced.\n\nThe benchmark 10-year bond yield IN072629G=CC rose 5 basis points to 6.64% after the central bank\u2019s announcement.\n\nThe rupee INR=D4 was stronger against the dollar for most parts of the session and remained largely unchanged immediately after the news, but was last weaker by 0.06% at 70.9600.\n\nThe RBI maintained its \u201caccommodative\u201d stance and said it would keep that position \u201cas long as it is necessary\u201d to revive economic growth, while ensuring inflation remains within target.\n\nThe six-member monetary policy committee (MPC) cut the repo rate INREPO=ECI by 25 basis points to 5.15%, in line with expectations. The reverse repo rate INRREP=ECI was reduced to 4.9%. [nL3N26P1JS]\n\n\u201cThe 25-basis-point cut was the lowest that was expected by equity market participants,\u201d said Kunj Bansal, chief investment officer at Acepro Advisors in Mumbai, adding that he had hoped for at least a 40-bp reduction to bring down real interest rates.\n\nThe RBI also cut its forecast for gross domestic product growth in 2019/20 to 6.1% from 6.9%.\n\nIndia\u2019s economy grew by just 5% in the June quarter, its slowest pace in more than five years, prompting the government to take measures aimed at boosting growth.\n\nA sharp cut in the corporate tax rate - to 22% from 30% - last month brought cheer to markets, but economists say the move will do little to address a lack of spending power.\n\nLeading stock indexes lower after the interest rate cut on Friday were banks, which have already suffered bruising declines in recent sessions.\n\nThe Nifty banks index was last down 0.92%, with Federal Bank Ltd (FED.NS) leading losses on the index with a 4.56% drop. Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd (KTKM.NS) fell 3.1%, while HDFC Bank Ltd (HDBK.NS) lost 2.1%.", "description": "Indian stocks reversed course to trade lower and bond yields rose on Friday, after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) cut interest rates for the fifth time this year as expected, in a bid to boost growth in Asia's third-largest economy.", "authors": ["Sachin Ravikumar", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1436938508&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF930H8", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
