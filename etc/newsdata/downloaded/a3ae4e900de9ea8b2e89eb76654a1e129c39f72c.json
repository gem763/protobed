And that's really the way it would be under my administration,\u201d he added.\n\nBut Yang said Friday in an interview with Fox News that his comments the previous night were not an implicit criticism of Biden.\n\n\u201cIf you look at when he was vice president, were there any rules against your family members being on the boards of foreign companies? I believe there were not. So nothing was amiss,\u201d he said.\n\nColorado Sen. Michael Bennet \u2013 in a interview published Thursday by Politico \u2013 said, \"I think it\u2019d be better not to have that kind of arrangement.\u201d\n\nBut Bennet said the issue of Biden and his son Hunter paled in comparison to what Trump did in a July phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president.\n\n\u201cI think it is distracting us from where we should be focused, which is on Donald Trump's calling up a foreign leader and tell him to investigate one of his political opponents. No matter what Hunter Biden did, it is hard for me to imagine that it's not 1 million times more benign than that,\u201d Bennet emphasized.\n\nWARREN SAYS SHE WOULDN'T LET THE CHILD OF HER VP SIT ON A FOREIGN COMPANY'S BOARD\n\nOn Wednesday, one of Biden's top rivals, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, quickly answered \u201cno\u201d when asked if she would allow her vice president\u2019s child to serve on a foreign firm's board.\n\nStill, to date, none of the Democratic presidential candidates have played into the president\u2019s playbook of trying to turn the tables on Biden over his son's work.\n\nHunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president. Questions have been raised by Republicans over how Biden pushed as vice president in 2016 for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was looking into corruption at the company. The prosecutor \u2013 as a matter of record, he had been widely accused of overlooking corruption in his own office by other nations \u2013 was later dismissed.\n\nTrump\u2019s reelection campaign on Friday launched a new TV and digital ad targeting Biden over his actions.\n\nGABBARD REVERSES COURSE, BACKS TRUMP IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY\n\nMeanwhile, the entire field of Democratic presidential candidates is now fully supporting the House Democrats' move this week launch an impeachment inquiry into Trump over the Ukrainian scandal.\n\nThe final holdout in the record-setting roster of White House hopefuls \u2013 Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii \u2013 came on board on Friday.", "description": "Several Democrats running for president in 2020 say they wouldn\u2019t allow the children of their vice president to sit on the board of a foreign company if they were elected president\u00a0-- amid renewed scrutiny over the business dealings of\u00a0Vice President Joe Biden's son.", "authors": ["Paul Steinhauser", "Paul Steinhauser Is A Politics Reporter Based In New Hampshire."], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/26/694940094001_6089851982001_6089833767001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
