The change in policy, announced Sunday night, will see U.S. troops vacate northern Syria, allowing Turkey to sweep in and, many fear, decimate the Kurdish forces that have long allied themselves with the U.S.\n\nThe Kurdish fighters are part of the Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, which have fought ISIS alongside U.S. forces in the area for years. But Turkey considers them a terrorist group, and SDF forces are not feeling good about their future. \u201cThe Americans are traitors. They have abandoned us to a Turkish massacre,\u201d a Kurdish official in Syria told NBC News overnight.\n\nCriticism of Trump\u2019s decision, which reportedly blindsided the Pentagon, came from even reliable allies, including GOP senators Lindsey Graham and Marco Rubio. Graham, who is threatening to bring a Senate resolution condemning the pullout of U.S. troops, called the decision a \u201cdisaster in the making.\u201d Rubio said the abandonment of the Kurds is \u201ca grave mistake that will have implications far beyond Syria.\u201d Former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley tweeted that the U.S is \u201cleaving [the Kurds] to die.\u201d\n\nThese tweets, unsurprisingly, did not cause Trump to reconsider. Instead, he tweeted that he is keeping campaign promises to get the U.S. \u201cout of these ridiculous endless wars.\u201d He also seemed to acknowledge one of the greatest risks of cutting off support for the SDF \u2014 that ISIS will be able to regain strength. How would the U.S. respond to that? \u201c[W]e can always go back & BLAST!\u201d he tweeted, seemingly suggesting that a resurgent ISIS could be squashed with a campaign of air strikes.\n\n....the captured ISIS fighters and families. The U.S. has done far more than anyone could have ever expected, including the capture of 100% of the ISIS Caliphate. It is time now for others in the region, some of great wealth, to protect their own territory. THE USA IS GREAT! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 7, 2019\n\nIf that\u2019s not wild enough for you, Trump followed those two tweets with another blockbuster. He boasted of his \u201cgreat and unmatched wisdom\u201d and threatened to \u201ctotally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey\u201d in a tweet that is among Trump\u2019s most bizarrely authoritarian.\n\nAs I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I\u2019ve done before!). They must, with Europe and others, watch over... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 7, 2019\n\n....the captured ISIS fighters and families.
