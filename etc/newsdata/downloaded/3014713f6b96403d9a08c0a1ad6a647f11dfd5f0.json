Tomorrow, she turns 3.'\n\nGage Edward celebrates 'the love of my life' as daughter Monroe turns three amid ugly custody battle with Flipping Out ex Jeff Lewis\n\nInstant love: Gage shared a picture of himself with Monroe shortly after her birth\n\nGage, 34, shares his daughter with his ex Jeff, 49, from whom he separated from this past January.\n\nMonroe was welcomed by the former couple in 2016, via surrogate. Jeff is Monroe's biological father.\n\nSince the pair's split earlier this year, they have attempted to arrive at a lasting custody arrangement amicably, to no avail.\n\nLast week, house flipper turned reality star Lewis said he's completely cutting off communication with Gage, in addition to banning him from using both the nanny and vehicle he previously provided for his ex's time with Monroe.\n\nOn his SiriusXM show Jeff Lewis Live last Thursday, the reality star said that he and Gage were headed toward splitting custody of the toddler 50-50 \u2014 but with the proviso they cease any and all communication not pivotal to the child.\n\nLewis said he came to the conclusion after a chilly chat with Gage earlier in the week in regards to Monroe's day-to-day life.\n\nAs they were: Gage, right, shares his daughter with ex Jeff Lewis, left; the two split in January\n\n'There were no pleasantries ... I said, \"I no longer want to communicate with you,\"' Jeff said. 'I want to raise my child as I see fit when she's with me, and you can raise her how you see fit when she's with you.\n\n'I don't need to know anything. You don't need to know anything.'\n\nNonetheless, Jeff has decided to withhold certain amenities he provided his ex.\n\n'I was giving him full access to my employees - my nannies, my extra car,' he said. 'I said that is now off the table. You can now hire your own employees. You can buy your own second car with the nanny.'\n\nIn spite of these bitter proceedings, which have reportedly amassed over $80k to date in legal fees, both fathers have continued to separately share smiling images on social media of their time with their daughter.\n\nJeff and Gage were together for more than a decade, but after splitting Gage subsequently left Jeff's firm, Jeff Lewis Design, in May.", "description": "He going through an ugly custody battle with his ex, Flipping Out star Jeff Lewis.", "authors": ["Dailymail.Com Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/17/20141964-0-image-a-23_1571933367219.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
