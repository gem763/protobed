The scandal led to the resignation of the bank's operating chief, a close deputy of Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam, who was cleared by a probe ordered by Credit Suisse.\n\nNet profit for the period rose to 881 million Swiss francs ($885.7 million) from CHF424 million a year earlier, the bank.\n\nRevenue grew 9% to CHF5.33 billion.\n\nAnalysts had expected the bank to report net profit of CHF770 million on revenue of EUR5.21 billion, according to a consensus forecast provided by the bank.\n\nThe bank's key international wealth management division posted a 43% increase in pretax profit, while earnings at its domestic bank grew 19%.\n\nThe bank's global markets division swung to a CHF269 million pretax profit, from a loss of CHF96 million.\n\n\"During the third quarter of 2019, we continued to implement our strategy of being a leading wealth manager with strong investment banking capabilities,\" Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam said.\n\nLooking ahead, the bank said it expects a seasonal slowdown in the final quarter of the year, due to the holiday season. Lingering headwinds related to Brexit and trade tensions between China and the U.S. may lead investors to be more cautious, it said.\n\nWrite to Pietro Lombardi at pietro.lombardi@dowjones.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 30, 2019 02:54 ET (06:54 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
