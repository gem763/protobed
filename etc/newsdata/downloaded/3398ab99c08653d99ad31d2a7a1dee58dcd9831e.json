(Sylvain Roy Roussel/CBC)\n\nThe idea of raising the age limit has come under criticism from some Quebec health professionals, industry groups and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\nWhen it was first proposed last year, Trudeau warned the cannabis rules would be a boon to organized crime and make teens turn \"to the Hells Angels to buy it.\"\n\nThe legislation was approved Tuesday at the National Assembly. Members of the Coalition Avenir Qu\u00e9bec all voted in favour of the law, while all opposition parties voted against.\n\nGabriel Nadeau-Dubois, spokesperson for the opposition Qu\u00e9bec Solidaire, said the law was discriminatory against young people and not supported by science.\n\n\"The CAQ is creating two classes of adults,\" he said, pointing out that 18-year-olds can vote but won't be able to decide whether they want to purchase cannabis.\n\nThe law also immediately bans the sale of cannabis candies and desserts, including chocolate. They will become legal in the rest of the country in mid-December.\n\nThe legislation also includes greater restrictions around the public consumption of cannabis, though municipalities will have leeway to determine their own rules.\n\nIt originally included a ban on growing cannabis at home. That aspect of the law is being challenged in court.", "description": "People in Quebec will need to wait until they are 21 to legally purchase cannabis under a new law passed by the Coalition Avenir Qu\u00e9bec government.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5340068.1572380670!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/1052377360.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
