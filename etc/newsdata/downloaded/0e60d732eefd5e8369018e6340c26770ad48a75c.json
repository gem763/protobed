If the bill is defeated, the legal default position is to leave in a clean-break Brexit on October 31st.\n\nHowever, the Benn Act forced the prime minister to request an extension of Article 50 to January 31st, 2020, in anticipation of a deal not being passed by the scheduled exit date of October 31st, 2019.\n\nEuropean member states, the EU27, must vote unanimously to grant the extension. President of the European Council Donald Tusk, who chairs the EU27\u2019s council, said on Tuesday that leaders \u201cwill decide in coming days\u201d whether to grant another delay, depending on developments in London.\n\nOut of the hands of pro-Brexit UK lawmakers, the only way to thwart Remainer attempts to stop a no-deal Brexit would be if just one EU member state vetoed the extension.\n\nPolish-born Mr Kawczynski has been lobbying his colleagues in his home country. He tweeted on Sunday: \u201cAs an almost-fluent Polish speaker, I am doing all I can to convince the Polish government to veto an extension of Article 50. Others are working on the Czechs and Hungarians. One of these will veto, I predict.\u201d\n\nAs almost fluent Polish speaker I am doing all I can can to convince Polish govenemt to veto extension of Article 50.Others working on Czechs and Hungarians.

The countries are also on the more Eurosceptic end of the scale, as manifested in their reactions to Brussels\u2019 overreach in domestic affairs and in defiance of forced migrant quotas.\n\nSpeaking to Sky News on Monday, Mr Kawczynski condemned a \u201chardcore Remainer parliament\u201d that wants to \u201cthwart the will\u201d of the people who voted in the majority to leave the EU.\n\nThe MP for Shrewsbury and Atcham said: \u201cIt is our job to do anything that is legal and constitutional to ensure that we leave the European Union on 31 October.\n\n\u201cWe have a hardcore Remainer parliament and Remainer MPs that are trying to block and thwart the will of the British people.\n\n\u201cSo of course we have to take whatever actions we need to.\u201d\n\nBoth Poland and Hungary have been threatened with sanctions by a German-French dominated EU over their opposition to Brussels\u2019 migrant programme. Poland has been further censured for its judicial reforms.\n\nMr Kawczynski compared the culture of the EU to a \u201cmafia cartel\u201d, saying on Sky News: \u201cThe problem we have is that the EU acts as a mafia cartel and any country is frightened of putting their head above the parapet and being the one country that says there shouldn\u2019t be an extension.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019re hoping that Warsaw and Budapest combined might have the courage to actually do this.\u201d\n\nPresident of France Emmanuel Macron is the most resistant to granting another extension amongst European leaders. Mr Macron indicated that the EU would not agree to another if the British parliament votes down Boris Johnson\u2019s withdrawal treaty.\n\nHowever, the French president had said in March \u2014 before the expiration of the original Brexit deadline \u2014 that an extension would not be granted unless MPs voted for Theresa May\u2019s deal. Parliamentarians did not, and Mr Macron did not veto the extension to October 31st.", "description": "British-Polish Conservative MP Daniel Kawczynski has urged Poland to defy the \"mafia cartel\" EU and veto a delay to Brexit.", "authors": ["Victoria Friedman"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Polish-and-UK-flags-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
