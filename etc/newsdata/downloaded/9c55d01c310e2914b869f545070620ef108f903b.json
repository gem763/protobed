He's almost improving players, he's improving the team, he's got a feelgood factor and it's quite the opposite at Manchester United for the last five or six years.\n\n\"Players are going there and at best staying still but most of all regressing.\"\n\nAlexis Sanchez has joined Inter Milan on loan.\n\nOwen, who scored 17 goals in 52 games for United between 2009-2012, cites the failures of big-money signings Angel Di Maria and Alexis Sanchez, both of whom have since left, and the sale of Romelu Lukaku to Inter Milan as part of a trend in which the club fails to coax the best from its big name players.\n\n\"You look at the great Di Maria, Sanchez, they've both been brought in for huge investment and let go pretty much straight away,\" added Owen, who has just released his autobiography, \"Michael Owen Reboot -- My Life.\"\n\nPaul Pogba has received criticism for a number of his performances.\n\n\"You've got Pogba, arguably one of the best players in the world, that people still have the jury out on.\n\n\"You've got Lukaku who came, gone. Big money, he's gone. Virtually every player that they bring [in] either going straight back out the door or is regressing.\n\n\"Now I don't think that's just a coincidence. I think there has to be something whereby, put it this way, if Jurgen Klopp was the manager or Pep Guardiola was the manager at Manchester United over these last five or six years, I think they have players who are virtually equal but the best isn't being gotten out of them and that's the big key for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.\"\n\nAngel Di Maria struggled to make an impact during his time at Old Trafford.\n\nDi Maria arrived in Manchester for \u00a359.7 million ($73.7 million), a then British transfer record when he signed from Real Madrid in 2014. He lasted just a year before moving to Paris Saint-Germain for \u00a344.3 million ($54.7 million).\n\nSanchez, reportedly one of the club's highest earners, left on loan to join Inter Milan last month. He endured a difficult 19 months at Old Trafford after joining from Arsenal , scoring just five goals in 45 appearances.\n\nHe has teamed up with Lukaku, who signed for Inter in a deal worth \u00a374 million ($90 million), last month. The Belgian international, who joined United two years ago from Everton in a deal worth \u00a375 million ($91 million), scored 42 goals in 96 appearances for the club.\n\nLukaku's departure has left Solskjaer light in the striking department with added pressure on Marcus Rashford and Antony Martial.\n\nWhile United spent heavily at the back, coughing up a reported \u00a379 million ($97 million) for England international Harry Maguire, a world record fee for a defender, and \u00a350 million ($62 million) on full-back Aaron Wan-Bissaka from Crystal Palace, it did not replace Lukaku.\n\nRomelu Lukaku left United to join Italian side Inter Milan.\n\nContrast the attacking resources at Solskjaer's disposal compared to those enjoyed by Pep Guardiola at Manchester City and Klopp at Liverpool, and it's not difficult to see why United may struggle to keep up with their Premier League rivals.\n\n\"He's got to find a way of getting the best out of these players,\" Owen said of Solskjaer's squad.\n\n\"You can't just keep losing a game, right, let's go and sell him, sell him, and bring the next superstar in, spend another \u00a380 million.\n\n\"You know, that's been happening for half a dozen years now. Alexis Sanchez was the best player in the Premier League for three seasons. All of a sudden he turns up at Old Trafford and he's just a pale shadow of what he was.\n\n\"There's so many examples. I don't think you can keep looking at players and say, 'oh yeah, they're not good enough, let's bring new in' and keep doing that. It would cost a fortune for starters but you need to looking a bit more within as well.\"", "description": "Michael Owen believes Manchester United could learn a lesson from arch-rival Liverpool after claiming Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's players are \"at best staying still, but most of all regressing.\"", "authors": ["Christina Macfarlane", "James Masters"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190913102854-solskjaer-tease-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
