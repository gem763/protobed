He said that for a number of reasons\u201d that \u201cthey do not want to mention Burisma and 2016.\u201d\n\n\u201cI agreed,\u201d Mr. Volker added, \u201cand further said that I believe it is essential that Ukraine do nothing that could be seen as interfering in 2020 elections. It is bad enough that accusations have been made about 2016 \u2014 it is essential that Ukraine not be involved in anything relating to 2020. He agreed and the idea of putting out a statement was shelved.\u201d\n\nMr. Volker, a former ambassador to NATO under President George W. Bush who was serving as special envoy part time without pay, emphasized to the congressional investigators that he was kept out of the loop on the president\u2019s efforts to prompt an investigation of Mr. Biden and not on Mr. Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Mr. Zelensky that has sparked an impeachment inquiry.\n\nMr. Volker sought in his testimony to distance himself from the pressure campaign by the president and Mr. Giuliani. \u201cAt no time was I aware of or took part in an effort to urge Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Biden,\u201d he told investigators.\n\n\u201cMoreover,\u201d he added, \u201cas I was aware of public accusations about the vice president, several times I cautioned the Ukrainians to distinguish between highlighting their own efforts to fight corruption domestically, including investigating Ukrainian individuals \u2014 something we support as a matter of U.S. policy \u2014 and doing anything that could be seen as impacting U.S. elections, which is in neither the United States\u2019 nor Ukraine\u2019s own interests.\u201d", "description": "During private testimony, Kurt D.
