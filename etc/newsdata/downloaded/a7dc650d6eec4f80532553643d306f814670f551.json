This is particularly true in the Los Angeles and San Francisco areas, but it\u2019s gotten bad in other coastal cities as well. There\u2019s been plenty of discussion and media coverage of this debacle, but little action has been taken toward a permanent solution.\n\nWith that in mind, the White House sent some officials out to the west coast to investigate the matter and see if the federal government had any programs and resources available to help with the situation. So the California state and municipal government leaders warmly and gratefully greeted them with open arms to see if any significant progress could be made.\n\nNaw, I\u2019m just kidding. They told President Trump to mind his own business. (USA Today)\n\nTrump administration officials confirmed Tuesday they are on the ground in California looking at ways to intervene in the state\u2019s mounting homelessness issue, which President Donald Trump has criticized as \u201cdisgusting\u201d and a \u201cdisgrace to our country.\u201d But many elected officials and homelessness experts in the Golden State said any White House assistance would be disingenuous given federal housing cuts have helped exacerbate the problem. Some also accused Trump of using the homelessness issue to win over conservative supporters ahead of the 2020 election. \u201cWe need federal support and resources to build more housing for people living on the streets,\u201d San Francisco Mayor London Breed said in a statement. \u201cBut simply cracking down on homelessness without providing the housing people need is not a real solution.\u201d\n\nState Senator Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco) was quoted as saying, \u201cTrump needs to back off and focus on his own mess of an administration.\u201d\n\nWell, isn\u2019t that just lovely? What\u2019s more amazing is that these officials are criticizing a proposal that hasn\u2019t even been made yet. Thus far there have only been suggestions of possible courses of action, including federal funding to build or renovate more federal housing dedicated to providing temporary housing for the homeless. They\u2019ve also discussed additional funding for law enforcement to help get those people off the streets and support for mental health initiatives.\n\nWhat sort of horrible monster would propose things like that???\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to imagine what California\u2019s leaders are thinking here. They are making almost no progress on their own and their own citizens don\u2019t even want to cooperate. When San Francisco drafted a proposal to cordon off part of a large municipal parking lot so the homeless living in cars and RVs could park (and sleep) there safely, homeowners in the neighborhood came out to protest and quashed the plan.\n\nMeanwhile, the streets are still being covered in feces and urine. Crime levels in areas where the homeless are camping are surging. The homeless are dying in droves, averaging more than three per day in Los Angeles.In San Francisco people are afraid to ride the trains because there\u2019s so much crime taking place.\n\nAnd you don\u2019t want help from Washington just because it would have President Trump\u2019s name attached to it and it might look like he was getting things done? (That\u2019s the obvious reason, let\u2019s be honest.) Fine, ingrates. Sink or swim on your own. I\u2019m sure there are plenty of other cities that will be grateful for the help.", "description": "Ingrates", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/newsom-campaign.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
