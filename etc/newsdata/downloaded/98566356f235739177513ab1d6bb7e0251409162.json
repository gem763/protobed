(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nAs President Trump intensified his public campaign Monday against the whistleblower whose anonymous complaint about the commander in chief helped spark an impeachment inquiry, legal analysts warned the person might soon face a grim reality.\n\nFederal laws offer only limited protection for those in the intelligence community who report wrongdoing \u2014 even when they follow all the rules for doing so. Trump and his allies, analysts said, might face few, if any consequences, for outing the whistleblower or otherwise upending the person\u2019s career.\n\n\u201cIf he wants to destroy this person\u2019s life,\u201d said whistleblower attorney Bradley P. Moss, \u201cthere\u2019s not a lot to stop him right now.\u201d\n\nWhile the acting director of national intelligence told lawmakers last week the whistleblower had acted in good faith and should be protected, Trump has seemed to suggest the opposite.\n\n[Trump lashes out again at whistleblower, questions whether Schiff should be arrested for \u2018treason\u2019]\n\nOn Monday, Trump tweeted that the whistleblower\u2019s complaint \u2014 which revealed Trump had pressed his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden \u2014 was \u201cnot holding up.\u201d He also said he was \u201ctrying to find out\u201d about the whistleblower\u2019s identity.\n\n\u201cThe Whistleblower knew almost nothing, its 2ND HAND description of the call is a fraud!\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter.\n\nThe statements came two days after Andrew P. Bakaj, a lawyer representing the whistleblower, sent a letter to the acting director of national intelligence expressing fears for his client\u2019s safety.\n\nBakaj said Monday, \u201cThe Intel Community Whistleblower is entitled to anonymity. Law and policy support this, and the individual is not to be retaliated against. Doing so is a violation of federal law.\u201d\n\n[House panels subpoena Giuliani for documents in Ukraine probe]\n\nThe intelligence community inspector general deemed the whistleblower\u2019s complaint credible, despite the person conceding much of the information was secondhand. On Monday, the inspector general\u2019s office issued a lengthy statement explaining how it came to that decision.\n\nThe statement noted the whistleblower had \u201cofficial and authorized access to the information and sources referenced\u201d in the complaint, direct knowledge of some conduct and \u201csubject matter expertise.\u201d\n\nThe inspector general\u2019s office also seemed to dispute an allegation, which Trump had seized on, that the rules for whistleblower complaints were recently changed to allow secondhand information to be passed on. That assertion seemed to be based on reporting in the Federalist, which found a previous whistleblower complaint form with the heading, \u201cFIRST-HAND INFORMATION REQUIRED.\u201d\n\nThe law never had such a requirement. But in its statement, the inspector general\u2019s office conceded previous forms and accompanying informational materials \u201ccould be read \u2014 incorrectly \u2014 as suggesting\u201d that it did. The inspector general\u2019s office said it had since developed new forms that were more accurate.\n\nWhistleblowers in the federal government have long had limited remedies if they face retaliation for reporting wrongdoing, and those in the intelligence community have even fewer than their counterparts in other agencies. The 1998 Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act did not actually detail any protections for whistleblowers from retaliation \u2014 instead merely describing the process to make a complaint.\n\nThe law, though, was later bolstered with a presidential policy directive spelling out how intelligence community inspectors general could seek to determine if a whistleblower faced retaliation and recommend corrective action, if so. The directive was formally put into law in 2014.\n\nNotably, analysts said, the law puts the president in charge of enforcement \u2014 which is particularly ironic in this case, given Trump is the subject of the complaint.\n\n\u201cSo, what kind of protection is this whistleblower going to get through this system?\u201d said David K. Colapinto, the co-founder of the National Whistleblower Center. \u201cBut you got to understand that prior to 2014, there was nothing on the books. This is considered an advancement.\u201d\n\nIf whistleblowers are fired, demoted or otherwise punished, they can now at least pursue internal remedies, though they cannot go to court, Colapinto said. Such cases, he said, \u201cusually end poorly for the whistleblower.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom our point of view, protecting the whistleblower is of paramount importance, and this case is going to be a real test of these laws to see if they can make them work,\u201d Colapinto said.\n\nIf the whistleblower\u2019s identity was itself protected as a government secret, executive branch officials who disclosed it could be subject to criminal investigation for leaking national security information \u2014 not unlike when CIA officer Valerie Plame\u2019s identity was disclosed publicly in the George W. Bush administration, legal analysts said.\n\nIf it were not, government officials who revealed it could be accused of violating the privacy act, Colapinto said. That is a misdemeanor crime that comes with a $5,000 fine, though the officials could also be sued.\n\nColapinto said his firm pursued such a case when Defense Department officials were accused of disclosing information from the background investigation of Linda Tripp, who secretly recorded conversations with Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern, about her sexual relationship with President Clinton. The government, Colapinto said, ultimately settled for $595,000.\n\nBut Moss said the act is virtually never enforced criminally, and it also does not apply to members of Congress who might be motivated to disclose the whistleblower\u2019s name.\n\n\u201cThis is all very, very fragile, and a lot of the protections that we understand to exist are based more on courtesy and custom than anything written down in law,\u201d Moss said.\n\nMoss is the law partner of Mark Zaid, one of the whistleblower\u2019s attorneys, though he is walled off from that case.\n\nDevlin Barrett contributed to this report.", "description": "\u201cIf he wants to destroy this person\u2019s life, there\u2019s not a lot to stop him right now,\u201d one whistleblower attorney said.", "authors": ["Matt Zapotosky", "National Security Reporter Covering The Justice Department", "John Wagner", "National Reporter Leading The Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "September At Pm", "Matt Zapotosky Covers The Justice Department For The Washington Post'S National Security Team.
