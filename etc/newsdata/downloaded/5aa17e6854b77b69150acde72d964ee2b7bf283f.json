The struggle which then followed saw Moira knocked overboard and she didn\u2019t emerge from the depths.\n\nAs Cain stood rooted to the spot, Nate called out desperately for Moira but given his admission to Cain that he can\u2019t swim, he will be next to no good when it comes to saving the day. It\u2019s down to Cain \u2013 but as he hesitates and Moira runs out of time, is he really going to stand by and let his wife die?\n\nNo matter what she has done, it\u2019s evident that Cain will always have a deep love for her. But Moira\u2019s foot becomes trapped in the underwater weeds and it seems bleak for her. As she fights to escape, alone at the bottom of the lake, has Cain left her to her doom?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOr will he snap to his senses and dive in after her?\n\nSpeaking about the intense scenes, Natalie said: \u2018Before we started I was apprehensive, but we had buddies underwater. I had a buddy called Wayne. The buddies are divers who stay with you underwater to make sure you always have access to air. Jeff\u2019s buddy was called Matt and they are really reassuring as they gave us so much confidence.\n\n\u2018The tank is quite deep. It\u2019s like a swimming pool, but really deep. It\u2019s dark and murky and dressed with weeds and rocks. In this case, there was a platform that I had to hook into and put my foot under. I would be on the regulator breathing until we needed to do the action, then the diver would swim over and remove the regulator.\n\n\u2018I would then hold my breath whilst I did the filming action, then the buddy diver would come straight back in and give me more air. It was really exciting to do. Jeff and I both have slightly bloodshot eyes from filming but nothing eye drops aren\u2019t fixing. I have really enjoyed this whole shoot, it has been fantastic \u2013 a great experience and brilliant team work. That is the thing I love about working on Emmerdale, we get to do such great challenges that we would not normally get to do.\u2019\n\nThe underwater sequence was filmed in a special tank in Essex and they look fantastic on screen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the drama is followed by a further stunt as the boat explodes. But who will survive?\n\nEmmerdale airs the dramatic climax to the boat clash on Wednesday 23rd October at 7pm on ITV.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Spectacular scenes.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/EMMERDALE_MOIRA_WATER_03-6c56_1571824891.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
