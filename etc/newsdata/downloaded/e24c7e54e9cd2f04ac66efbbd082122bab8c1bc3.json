De Ligonnes\u2019 disappearance has long stumped investigators, leading some to speculate that he has died.\n\nScottish police had confirmed that a suspect was detained on Friday, although they did not give details of his identity.", "description": "A Frenchman arrested on Friday in Scotland is not the man suspected of killing his entire family in 2011, a French police source said on Saturday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
