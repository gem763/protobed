A coalition of Syrian Kurdish fighters, Americans and other foreign troops had fought the Islamic State there since 2014.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark T. Esper confirmed on Monday that the United States was considering keeping a small force in northeastern Syria, alongside the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, to prevent oil fields there from falling into the hands of the Islamic State. The Times reported that Mr. Trump was leaning in favor of leaving perhaps 200 troops there.", "description": "More than 100 American military vehicles entered Iraq on Monday, accelerating a pullout that greatly reduces American clout in Syria.", "authors": ["Ben Hubbard", "Patrick Kingsley"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/21/world/21syria/21syria-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
