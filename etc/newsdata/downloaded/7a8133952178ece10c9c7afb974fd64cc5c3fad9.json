Every wedding needs a theme and it only felt right to have Lotus Biscoff as mine!\u2019\n\n\u2018The Lotus Biscoff went down a storm with everyone, so the whopping 50kg of spread and 600 biscuits used was definitely worth it.\n\n\u2018Ben introduced me to Lotus Biscoff spread because he just knew how much I would love it, so it will always hold a special place in my heart!\u2019\n\nA couple that Biscoffs together stays together. We\u2019re just annoyed we weren\u2019t invited.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Can having sex cause thrush?\n\nMORE: I thought I knew what a heroin addict looked like, then I became one\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "If you thought you loved Lotus Biscoff more than anyone else, you could be wrong.", "authors": ["Jessica Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSC05450-1ddf_1571241873.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
