An attorney for Heartland declined to comment.\n\nAD\n\nD.C. Public Schools, as well as Prince George\u2019s, Montgomery, Fairfax and several other counties in Maryland and Virginia, use MySchoolBucks. The service is optional in many schools, but families who opt in use it to pay for meals and before- and after-school programs.\n\nThe lawsuit revolves around a $2.49 program fee that took effect in 2017 and accompanies every MySchoolBucks transaction. The fee is lower in Montgomery County Public Schools, where users pay $1.95, according to the district\u2019s website.\n\nAD\n\nHeartland, in its Terms of Service agreement, told parents their schools may charge them a fee to use the service, according to the lawsuit filed in May.\n\nNow, in its updated service agreement, the company says program fees are paid to Heartland and \u201cthe school or school district may remit the program fee\u201d to it.\n\nAD\n\nNationwide, about 2 million people with children in 30,000 schools use MySchoolBucks and may be affected by this lawsuit, Bennett said.\n\nWhile Heartland allegedly told users that school districts may require program fees, local school systems say they have never enforced such a rule.\n\nFairfax County Public Schools doesn\u2019t keep transaction fees for any of the district\u2019s approximately 56,000 active MySchoolBucks accounts, said Lucy Caldwell, a schools spokesperson.\n\nAD\n\nA notice on the Montgomery County schools\u2019 website says the district doesn\u2019t receive income from providing MySchoolBucks. Gboyinde Onijala, a spokesperson for the district, said the message wasn\u2019t posted in response to the lawsuit and has been on the page \u201cfor some time.\u201d\n\nIn a letter Prince George\u2019s County Public Schools sent to families when it introduced MySchoolBucks in 2014, officials didn\u2019t say the district would collect money from families to use the service.\n\nAD\n\nD.C. Public Schools does not collect transaction fees, either. Only 28 D.C. schools participate in the MySchoolBucks service.\n\nBennett said Heartland has made attempts to quash the lawsuit, including trying to deposit $40,000 into the bank account Story connected to his MySchoolBucks service. Story didn\u2019t give Heartland permission to put the money into his account and rejected the payment, Bennett said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey took that information without his authorization and tried to put a bunch of money in his account and say, \u2018Hey, this case has to go away now because we put all this money in your account,\u2019 \u201d Bennett said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this happen in a lot of cases, this effort by corporations to kill class actions.\u201d\n\nHeartland has also limited the number of people who can participate in the lawsuit by disqualifying current users, Bennett said.\n\nAD\n\nIn its updated Terms of Service, Heartland says users who accept the agreement and complete transactions through MySchoolBucks \u201cwill not be permitted to participate in the Story case as a class member.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s outrageous that a corporation would take money from parents that the parents thought was going to their children\u2019s school and then, when someone figured out what was going on, try to prevent those parents from going to court to try to get their money back and stop the company from doing this to other families,\u201d Bennett said.\n\nA hearing for the case \u2014 which has been assigned in the District Court for the Middle District of Florida \u2014 has been set for Oct. 25.\n\nGet updates on your area delivered via email\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news\n\nAD", "description": "A lawsuit filed in Florida against a school lunch payment service could involve local families", "authors": ["Lauren Lumpkin"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/pEzOzAuXuwwPBxo_aKTiik-kLrU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/P27HDTHH4EI6NAGCGDSX4V7ALU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
