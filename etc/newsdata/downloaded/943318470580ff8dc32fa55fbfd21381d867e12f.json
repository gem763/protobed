It is vital whatever happens that we prepare for no-deal, and we will be ready for no-deal on 31 October. We have got to do both things at once.\"\n\nBBC political correspondent Nick Eardley said No 10 had been \"heartened\" by the EU's agreement to accelerate talks and the willingness to explore ideas Britain has to replace the Irish backstop.\n\nBut he added that a breakthrough in the immediate term was unlikely and a positive tone in the Brexit process did not always lead to positive outcomes.\n\nPlease upgrade your browser Your guide to Brexit jargon Use the list below or select a button\n\nOn Thursday, the UK government said confidential documents that \"reflect the ideas the UK has put forward\" on Brexit had been shared with the EU.\n\nIt came after Finland's prime minister said Mr Johnson had 12 days to set out his Brexit plans to the EU - although a government source said the development was not in response to those remarks.\n\nMr Johnson will hold more talks with European leaders at a UN summit in New York next week.\n\nIrish prime minister Leo Varadkar, who will be among those at the summit, said he would try to get a deal with Mr Johnson.\n\nHowever, his deputy, Mr Coveney, said: \"There's still a big gap between what the British government has been suggesting that they're looking for and what Ireland and the EU need in terms of getting a deal, and in order to close that gap we need to get credible proposals from the British government, which we simply haven't received yet.\"\n\nThursday also saw the final day of the legal battle over Mr Johnson's decision to suspend Parliament at the UK's Supreme Court.\n\nThe prime minister prorogued Parliament earlier this month for five weeks, with MPs not scheduled to return until 14 October.\n\nThe President of the Supreme Court, Lady Hale, said the justices would announce a decision early next week.", "description": "It comes after European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said a deal can be reached by 31 October.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6F47/production/_108878482_hi056545166.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
