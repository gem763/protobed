But this time, it\u2019s against Australia in rugby league.\n\nFolau, who was recently sacked for a homophobic Instagram post, has registered alongside his brother to play for Tonga in an upcoming international tournament.\n\nBoth brothers are eligible to play for the nation in the Oceania Cup in October and November of this year.\n\nHe\u2019s been banned from representing Australia in rugby union, but if you thought that would stop him from finding another ball and jumping ship to our opposition, you are sorely mistaken.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to bring any of my personal matters into this and I am grateful that the IRLF have endorsed my availability,\u201d Israel Folau said in a statement from the Tonga National Rugby league. \u201cWhat I will do now is focus on playing great rugby league and do my talking on the field.\u201d\n\nGeorge Koloamatangi, the Tongan National Rugby League Chairman, announced on Monday that both brothers will represent the nation in the Oceania Cup later this year.\n\nThe brothers are set to play in games against Australia and Great Britain during the event, which will be held in New Zealand next month. But not if Australia can help it.\n\nAustralia\u2019s National Rugby League Association has stated that the Rugby League International Federation are going to try to protest this at an upcoming meeting.\n\nAccording to the SMH, Folau\u2019s return to the sporting field was not discussed with the federation at all before it was announced.\n\n\u201cThe RLIF board have made no decisions in relation to any registration request for Israel Folau,\u201d the chairman of the ARL Commission Peter Beattie said. \u201cAs a current member of the RLIF board, as the ARLC rep, I can assure you that this has never been discussed or mentioned around the board table.\u201d\n\nBeattie has previously said that Folau would not be permitted to play in the NRL again because he \u201cdoesn\u2019t pass [the league\u2019s] inclusiveness culture.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear whether or not Folau will actually make a comeback to sport, but it looks like we\u2019ll have to wait and see exactly how much power the Rugby League International Foundation has over Folau\u2019s future.\n\nREAD MORE Israel Folau Calls His Sacking \"Unenforceable\" In New Federal Court Claim", "description": "Controversial ex-rugby union player Israel Folau attempts to return to the sporting world by registering to play for Tonga in the Rugby League Oceania Cup", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/20190628001406389266-minihighres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
