Chief of staff Mick Mulvaney told press that the Trump administration had reviewed a number of locations but decided that Doral would be ideal.\n\nThe decision sparked an uproar from Trump critics and ethics experts, who argued that Trump was violating the Constitution's emoluments clause and essentially awarding a contract to himself and stood to profit massively from hosting the international political event at his own property.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks during an event where he congratulated astronauts Jessica Meir and Christina Koch as they conduct the first all-female spacewalk, from the Roosevelt Room of the White House, Friday, Oct. 18, 2019, in Washington.

I announced that I would be willing to do it at NO PROFIT or, if legally permissible, at ZERO COST to the USA.
