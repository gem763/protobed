It\u2019s just that the toll that the trauma kind of takes, I don\u2019t know how much I\u2019ve got left of that to cry out anymore.\u201d\n\nThe couple detailed the story earlier this week during an episode of the \"One Tree Hill\" alum's podcast, \u201cWhine Down with Jana Kramer.\" Caussin, a recovering sex addict, revealed that he received a topless photo on Oct. 5 from a woman he said he didn't know. The former NFL player deleted the text, but Kramer found it on his Apple Watch.\n\nDuring the podcast episode, Kramer initially seemed unclear as to whether or not she believed Caussin, given his history of cheating on her.\n\nJANA KRAMER, MIKE CAUSSIN REVEAL MARRIAGE TROUBLES AFTER SHE FOUND A WOMAN HAD SENT HIM A TOPLESS PHOTO\n\n\u201cI saw it, and \u2026 my heart just fell. I was like, it\u2019s here. It\u2019s happened again. I\u2019m such a f---ing idiot \u2026 Like, how is this happening again?\u201d she said at the time (via Us Weekly). \u201cI don\u2019t want to live this kind of life. We just moved into this beautiful house, and we had our second kid, and we fought so hard. Why is this happening again?\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Caussin told Bush: \u201cThis has probably been the most difficult thing to date. Everything that we\u2019ve shared, this has probably been the most difficult to swallow.\u201d\n\n\"Last night, I couldn\u2019t sleep because I\u2019m tired of feeling like the bad guy and it's because of my shame,\" he admitted.\n\nJANA KRAMER DESCRIBES FINDING OUT ABOUT HUSBAND'S CHEATING RIGHT BEFORE GOING ON STAGE\n\nHowever, Caussin went on to say that because he and Kramer are so open about their relationship, they are able to potentially help others who might be going through similar issues.\n\n\u201cWith the live podcast that Jana and I do, and we take on tour, that is probably the most impactful feedback,\u201d he stated. \u201cWhen we hear from men [who] say thank you to both of us for opening up to enable them to open up a little more than they would have in the past.\u201d\n\nThe couple married in May 2015 and welcomed daughter Jolie in January 2016, only to separate in August of that year after Kramer found out about Caussin's infidelity. The pair renewed their vows in 2017 and welcomed son Jace in November 2018.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn March, Kramer revealed that Caussin had a relapse in 2018. Although Caussin said at the time that he had not had sex outside his marriage since being caught cheating in 2016, the incident colored her opinion of their current situation.\n\n\u201cWhether he ends up meeting with someone or not \u2026 That last relapse, he almost did, and I was going to sign the [divorce] papers,\u201d she explained on her podcast on Monday. \u201cSo it\u2019s like, he gets even close to the fire, and I\u2019m gone. I\u2019m like, 'Does he not know that and realize that and love our family enough?'\"\n\nFox News' Tyler McCarthy contributed to this report", "description": "Jana Kramer\u00a0and\u00a0Mike Caussin\u00a0are speaking out after revealing\u00a0that their marriage is in a tough spot due to the country star finding out that an unknown woman sent Caussin a topless photo.", "authors": ["Mariah Haas"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/02/michael-caussin-jana-kramer-cheating-getty-display.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
