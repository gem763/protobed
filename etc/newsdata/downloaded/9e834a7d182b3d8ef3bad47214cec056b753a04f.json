For many, the single biggest waste category is single-use plastic products. Although some are safe to use, a number of plastic products are actually extremely harmful to the environment\u2014and ultimately, to our health when they break down into microplastic particles.\n\nAt first, I was anxious about the thought of going plastic-free\u2014as someone who keeps her schedule tight, I didn\u2019t have the confidence that I could always remember to bring a reusable cup or a glass straw with me at all times. But with some creativity and reliable products, making the switch was easier than I thought. Here\u2019s what I used.\n\n1. A set of reusable stretch lids to replace cling wraps\n\nThese stretch lids can seal everything airtight. (Photo: Amazon)\n\nI have to admit I\u2019ve long used a ton of cling wrap because of its convenience. But when I came to the realization that those cling wraps are terrible for the environment, I felt guilty. Thankfully, I found these reusable silicone stretch lids that can seal my cans and jars air-tight. To reuse, just rinse them under water. There are six sizes to choose from, which covers almost all typical household needs, from proofing bread dough overnight to keeping leftovers separated from other foods in the fridge.\n\nGet the Silicone Stretch Lids Pack of 12 on Amazon for $12.99\n\n2. Our favorite reusable straws that you\u2019ll never forget to bring along\n\nOur favorite reusable straws, the Hummingbird, ranked top in our tests. (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar)\n\nOur favorite reusable straws, the Hummingbird glass straws are great alternatives to the single-serve plastic straws that are typically offered at restaurants. Although eco-conscious coffee shops are replacing plastic straws with paper ones, they still have an impact on the environment and they easily break in half. The Hummingbird straw is lightweight and easy-to-wash, which means I can carry it anywhere.\n\nGet the Hummingbird Glass Straws, Set of 4, on Amazon for $19.99\n\n3. A reusable sandwich bag that also holds snacks on the go\n\nThe lunchskins sandwich bags are a great alternative to Ziplocs. (Photo: Lunchskins)\n\nA classic PB&J sandwich sitting in one of those single-use Ziploc bags just seems sadder than one wrapped in our favorite reusable sandwich bags. The Lunchskins have different patterns to choose from and they\u2019re all absolutely adorable. This bag is the perfect size for packing sandwiches without the need to squish anything\u2014no matter how thick your sandwich is. They\u2019re dishwasher safe but also extremely easy to clean if you prefer hand-washing them.\n\nGet the Lunchskins 2-piece Food Storage Bag Set on Amazon for $10.39\n\n4. This bento box with a cult following\n\nThe Monbento lunch box is the only thing i bring to work for lunch.

Top-rated glass food storage containers for grocery shopping\n\nThe Pyrex food storage containers are our favorite in the roundup. (Photo: Reviewed / Betsey Goldwasser)\n\nOne of the biggest challenges to living plastic-free is dodging all the \u201cplastic traps\u201d at grocery stores. Meat-packaging, single-use produce bags, and all sorts of pantry items made me feel like achieving my plastic-free week would be mission-impossible. However, I found an easy solution when I started to bring my own containers instead of picking up pre-packaged cuts. The butcher will subtract the container tare to get to the gross weight of the meat, which is done on an electronic scale.\n\nIn our testing of the best food storage containers, we fell in love with these glassware containers that are perfect for keeping food safe and fresh. They\u2019re not only a great alternative to the grocery store plastic packaging, but also perfect for meal-prepping.\n\nGet the Pyrex Meal Prep Container Set on Amazon for $33.59\n\n6. An organic cotton mesh bag that\u2019s better than store plastic bags\n\nThIS organic cotton mesh bag holds up to a few pounds of fruits and vegetables. (Photo: Amazon)\n\nAlthough an increasing number of stores have been switching to biodegradable plastic produce bags, I\u2019ve found they\u2019re way too flimsy to hold anything substantial. One time I put an ear of corn into a store-provided bag and the cob immediately fell through it. This organic cotton mesh bag can hold up to three pounds of fruits and vegetables, and its stretchy material makes sure that it can fit large items.\n\nGet the Leinuosen Reusable Grocery Mesh Bags on Amazon for $9.99\n\n7. A produce bag that catches small items\n\nFor produce that are smaller in size, these bags can help. (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nWhile it\u2019s easy to fit a butternut squash or three large tomatoes in a mesh bag, small vegetables, such as Brussels sprouts and green beans, can\u2019t be securely held in cotton mesh bags. These reusable produce bags are lightweight, featuring tiny breathable mesh that allows some necessary airflow to prolong the lifespan of fresh produce.\n\nGet the BB Brotrade Premium Produce Bags 12-Pack on Amazon for $6.99\n\n8.

(Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar / Hydro Flask)\n\nIf you\u2019re hoping to break the bottled water habit, the Hydro Flask can help. Our favorite water bottle, the Hydro Flask scored high marks in a range of tests: It\u2019s portable, versatile, durable, and well-designed. It\u2019s the top performer in our temperature tests, too, keeping ice largely unmelted well past the 24-hour mark. Its patented double-wall vacuum enables the bottle to keep water cold, keep hot beverages hot, and prevents condensation from forming on the outside, keeping it slip-free, and safe to store in bags alongside papers and laptops.\n\nGet the Hydro Flask Water Bottle on Amazon for $29.95\n\n9. A stainless steel travel mug to keep my drinks warm\n\nFor people who like their caffeinated drinks warm, the Zojirushi mug is perfect. (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar)\n\nBefore I pledged to go plastic-free, I had been a loyal fan of our favorite travel mug, the Zojirushi stainless steel mug, because of its impeccable insulation and lightweight design.

Bring these mason jars on grocery shopping trips, and you\u2019ll find the store employees happily helping you fill the jars with nuts and cereal.\n\nGet the Ball Mason Jar 16-oz, Set of 4, on Amazon for $10.55\n\n11. Solid bar shampoo and conditioners that are full of organic ingredients\n\nThese solid bar shampoo and conditioner can keep your hair clean and smooth. (Photo: Aspen Kay Naturals)\n\nI sometimes fail to notice how much plastic waste I produce outside of my kitchen. In fact, I never thought about the environmental impact I had caused by using bottled shampoo and conditioner. Using all organic, natural herbs, Aspen Kay Naturals is able to provide something more eco-friendly than the liquid version of haircare. Unlike the more common brands we\u2019ve seen in stores, this shampoo is 100% soap-free, which means its gentle on the hair and scalp as no harsh cleaners, detergent, or silicone is included in the formula.\n\n12. Beeswax wraps to keep produce fresh\n\nBee's wax wraps are amazing for keeping produce fresh. (Photo: Amazon)\n\nTo stop using plastic wraps for half-cut lemons, onions, and other produce, I started putting these hand-crafted beeswax wraps to the test. Even after multiple uses, the beeswax wraps excellently retained the freshness of the foods I wrapped in them. They\u2019re also odor-free, which is better than their plastic counterparts.\n\nGet the Bee\u2019s Wrap 3-pack Reusable Beeswax Food Wraps on Amazon for $10.78\n\n13. Use composting bin instead of plastic trash bags\n\nCompost bins can help you reduce waste. (Photo: Amazon)\n\nMuch of the produce we toss away each year ends up in landfills, which produce a large amount of the greenhouse gas methane. To reduce the use of trash bags, I started composting the daily food scraps, finger nails, hair, and tissue paper, which are otherwise destined to non-recyclable waste. With a little research, I was able to properly compost my waste without creating an unpleasant smell or attracting small animals. Plus, if done right, I can use the compost to enrich my soil for growing fruits and vegetables in a few months.\n\nGet the Epica Stainless Steel Compost Bin on Amazon for $22.99\n\nWhat should I do with the plastic I swapped out?\n\nI started researching what to do with the plastic packaging I\u2019ve just swapped out. TerraCycle, a free plastic recycling platform, offers instructions for every type of recycling work. The site lists a growing number of participating businesses that allows me to send the cleaned, recyclable packaging back, free of charge.\n\nFor example, if I accumulate a good amount of Barilla pasta packaging, I can sign up the Barilla program and get a free shipping label to return the emptied bags and boxes. Once they receive the packaging, I\u2019ll get reward points that can be used toward donating to non-profit organizations or schools of my choice. If you don\u2019t want to separate the packaging, TerraCycle offers Zero Waste Box (purchase required) to recycle almost any type of waste.\n\nMy final takeaway\n\nAdmittedly, there were still areas that I could use some improvements while attempting to achieve a plastic-free life: I brushed my teeth with plastic toothbrush heads and used makeup remover wipes wrapped in plastic packaging. These instances serve as a reminder of how ubiquitous plastic products are in our daily lives, and how challenging it can be to cut them out completely. To live completely plastic-free may still be a long shot for me, but it\u2019s no longer some far-fetched, unachievable idea.\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.
