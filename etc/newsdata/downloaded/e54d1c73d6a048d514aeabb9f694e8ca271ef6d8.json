It\u2019s a countersuit to Tenney\u2019s attempt to leave the organization back in May over concerns his contract was exploitative.\n\nFaze is now saying Tenney made more than $20 million from streaming, gaming endorsements, and sponsorships, and that he \u201cshared almost none of this income with Faze Clan.\u201d The company is seeking compensation from Tenney for its services and unspecified damages under the terms of the contract. Faze is also seeking injunctive relief to prevent him from revealing any supposedly confidential information, disparaging the company publicly, and potentially interfering with its current roster of talent or any future business deals.\n\nThe original lawsuit filed by Tenney\u2019s lawyers claimed Faze failed to pay Tenney his share of brand deal revenue that he was owed and that the organization grossly undercut his earnings. The lawsuit claimed Faze had the right to take up to 80 percent of his earnings in some situations, although the organization claimed it had never done so when the suit became public. Tenney\u2019s lawyers argue that Faze Clan took financial advantage of him by way of an exploitative contract and unlawful behavior.\n\n\u201cFaze Clan taught Tenney how to be more than just a skilled gamer.\u201d\n\nThe countersuit now claims Tenney\u2019s actions have caused \u201cserious damage and stands to do more\u201d that could affect members of Faze Clan\u2019s team. Faze Clan\u2019s countersuit also claims that Tenney\u2019s goal is to set up a rival e-sports company, alleging that \u201cTenney is taking the valuable information he learned from Faze Clan, which he is obligated to keep secret, and using it to create a rival to Faze Clan or otherwise support rival gamers and gaming organizations.\u201d\n\nConcerns about Faze Clan\u2019s roster sprung up in the weeks following Tenney\u2019s lawsuit. Tenney\u2019s gaming partner and roommate, Dennis \u201cCloakzy\u201d Lepore, is now in the process of leaving the organization, too. Even though Lepore told fans on Twitter that Tenney\u2019s lawsuit and departure was \u201cnot the case what so ever\u201d for his own leaving, it did lead to speculation within the community that Tenney\u2019s actions influenced Lepore\u2019s.\n\nTenney first signed a contract with Faze in April 2018. The contract specifically stated that Faze gets 80 percent of all revenue that Tenney makes through sponsored videos on Twitch and YouTube. Tenney has become one of Twitch\u2019s most popular and subscribed-to streamers, and he boasts more than 10 million subscribers. Faze\u2019s countersuit claims, however, that Tenney experienced a boost in popularity that helped him earn millions of dollars and that Faze is a large part of the reason why he became successful.\n\n\u201cFaze Clan taught Tenney how to be more than just a skilled gamer,\u201d the countersuit reads. \u201cFaze Clan taught him to be a professional. It schooled Tenney in the business, social media and gaming practices that have made Faze Clan successful. And he certainly has been successful. It is understood that Tenney has earned over $20 million since joining Faze Clan in April 2018, when he was earning virtually nothing.\u201d\n\nThe language is similar to Faze Clan\u2019s original statement regarding Tenney\u2019s lawsuit in May. The e-sports collective claimed it \u201ccollected a total of $60,000 from our partnership, while Tfue has earned millions as a member of Faze Clan.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile contracts are different with each player, all of them \u2014 including Tfue\u2019s \u2014 have a maximum of 20 percent to Faze Clan in both tournament winnings as well as content revenue, with 80% to the player,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cIn Turner\u2019s case, neither of those have been collected by Faze Clan.\u201d\n\nThere are other issues that are brought up in the lawsuit. Faze Clan\u2019s argues that Tenney breached his contract and disparaged Faze Clan over the course of the lawsuit. The organization also claims that Tenney directly leaked confidential information about his contract to media publications, violating their terms. The full lawsuit can be read below.\n\nUpdate (August 1st, 6:40pm ET): Tenney\u2019s lawyer issued a lengthy statement to The Hollywood Reporter about Faze Clan\u2019s lawsuit. It can be read in full below.", "description": "Faze Clan is suing professional Fortnite player Turner \"Tfue\" Tenney, claiming that he\u2019s been disparaging the company and trying to form a rival e-sports organization.
