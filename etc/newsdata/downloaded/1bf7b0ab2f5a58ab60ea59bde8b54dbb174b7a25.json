He also built devices used in a disrupted plot to bomb U.S.-bound cargo jets by hiding the devices in printer cartridges in 2010.\n\n\u201cHe also built an explosive device intended to be used against a passenger aircraft in 2012, and the device used in the attempted assassination of the former Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia,\u201d Trump said.\n\nYemeni officials said in August 2018 that al-Asiri had been killed in a U.S. air strike, but Trump\u2019s announcement marks the first U.S. confirmation. A United Nations report issued in August 2018 also said that al-Siri may have been killed during the latter half of 2017.\n\n\u201cThe United States will continue to hunt down terrorists like al-Asiri until they no longer pose a threat to our great Nation,\u201d Trump said.", "description": "President Trump on Thursday confirmed that senior al Qaeda bomb-maker Ibrahim al-Asiri was killed in a U.S.\u00a0strike in Yemen two years ago.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/yemen_war_110918getty_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
