Not in a driftery kind of way. Her career choices, from blockbuster films like Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Once Upon a Time in\u2026Hollywood to her latest role as the face of Chanel\u2019s new Gabrielle Chanel Essence fragrance, are the definition of solid. But when Robbie needs a moment to herself, she plunges into the nearest body of water and turns it into a personal sensory-deprivation chamber.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll jump in, float underwater, and I\u2019m so happy,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s where I\u2019m most comfortable and content, whenever I\u2019m in the water. Pool, ocean, river, hot tub, I don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nAnd can anyone blame her for dipping out for a minute or two? Promoting the Tarantino film required her to pinball around the world in a grand array of looks. \u201cIt can all feel overwhelming,\u201d she says of the sometimes rowdy red-carpet experience. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of yelling and screaming and things happening in the moment, and sometimes you can\u2019t really brace yourself for it. But if you adjust your mind-set to receive that attention as people being excited, then you can embrace the enthusiasm. What a luxury it is to have people paying attention to your film. If no one cared, that would be crushing.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Why Margot Robbie's Cannes Debut Was So Unexpected\n\nThis gracious attitude toward fame is likely one of the reasons makeup artist Pati Dubroff calls Robbie \u201ca walking ray of sunshine.\u201d Robbie collaborated with a holy trinity of image-makers \u2014 Dubroff, stylist Kate Young, and hairstylist Bryce Scarlett \u2014 to dream up her recent looks with tactical precision, taking into account the role, vibe, and specific color palettes. But, according to Dubroff, it\u2019s Robbie\u2019s willingness to play along that makes her look timeless rather than costumey. \u201cShe\u2019s like a supermodel in her ability to transform with beauty,\u201d Dubroff says. \u201cOne of my favorite looks is from the New York premi\u00e8re of Suicide Squad, when she wore the Alexander McQueen dress with the unicorn on it. She had on black lipstick and just looked so cool. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever worked with an actress who can take such a broad range of references and make them all work.\u201d\n\nNo doubt that metamorphic quality caught the eye of Chanel designer Karl Lagerfeld, who photographed Robbie for the brand\u2019s Coco Neige campaign in 2018. \u201cWe drank wine and had a three-course meal and I think did more hanging out and chatting than taking photos,\u201d Robbie recalls. \u201cThe idea that the companionship came before the photos is just not what I was expecting at all. It\u2019s one of my lasting memories of Karl: this chilled-out, lovely guy on set who just enjoyed the people he worked with.\u201d When the opportunity arose for Robbie to be the face of Gabrielle Chanel Essence, she happily joined the icons who posed before her: Catherine Deneuve, Vanessa Paradis, and Nicole Kidman, to name a few. \u201cGrowing up, I definitely never thought that could be me,\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cI always saw it as the ultimate level of elegance.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Margot Robbie Has a New Beauty Gig With Chanel\n\nSo while the Aussie continues to dive into one role after another \u2014 next up is Bombshell, about the fall of Fox News executive Roger Ailes, in December \u2014 Robbie can rely on a few of her pal Dubroff\u2019s beauty tricks to keep her face looking dewy-fresh.\n\n\u201cMy husband [Tom Ackerley] thinks I\u2019m a lunatic every time I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, Pati told me about this new gadget,\u2019 \u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll put a sheet mask on and look terrifying, like Michael Myers from those Halloween movies. Or I\u2019ll roll these little refrigerated glass orbs filled with liquid under my eyes, which feel so nice. My husband scoffs, but if he has a hangover, I\u2019ll be like, \u2018You want a sheet mask, don\u2019t you?\u2019 and he\u2019ll be like, \u2018Yes!\u2019 \u201d\n\nFor more stories like this, pick up the October issue of InStyle, available on newsstands, on Amazon, and for digital download Sept. 20.", "description": "Actress, producer, and Chanel ambassador Margot Robbie reveals how she keeps her cool under the spotlight and shares her favorite tips for staying calm and glowy at home.", "authors": ["Angelique Serrano"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/CP8UCq_quoaZh3XhFE9Y3g--~B/aD0zMDAwO3c9MjIxMztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/instyle_846/a49bccf76eb6e400806f30d8887f6a62", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
