Jewel Samad / AFP / Getty\n\nSabi was presenting evidence from the tribunal's final report, published in June, which found that a \"very substantial number\" of prisoners were \"killed to order\" by the Chinese government.\n\nThey were \"cut open while still alive for their kidneys, livers, hearts, lungs, cornea and skin to be removed and turned into commodities for sale,\" the report said.\n\nThe body parts were then used for medical purposes, it said, citing extremely short wait times for organ transplants in Chinese hospitals as evidence of the practice.\n\nThe report was led by Sir Geoffrey Nice, a British lawyer who was the lead prosecutor in the trial of Slobodan Milosevic, the former Yugoslavian president.\n\nRead more: Chilling undercover footage taken inside China's most oppressive region shows it's virtually impossible to escape the paranoid police state\n\nHamid Sabi, a lawyer for the China Tribunal. Screenshot/The Independent\n\nSabi told the UN council on Tuesday that China's efforts involved \"hundreds of thousands of victims,\" describing it as \"one of the worst mass atrocities of this century.\"\n\nHe did not specify how many organs the China Tribunal believes had been harvested, or the number taken from Uighurs and from Falun Gong members.\n\n\"Victim for victim and death for death, cutting out the hearts and other organs from living, blameless, harmless, peaceable people constitutes one of the worst mass atrocities of this century,\" he said.\n\n\"Organ transplantation to save life is a scientific and social triumph, but killing the donor is criminal.\"\n\nReuters said China has insisted that it \"stopped using organs from executed prisoners in 2015.\"\n\nThe Chinese government did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment on Sabi's testimony.\n\nSabi concluded by saying that it is the duty of international bodies like the UN to investigate the tribunal's findings \"not only in regard to the possible charge of genocide, but also in regard to crimes against humanity.\"", "description": "China has harvested organs from Uighurs and members of the Falun Gong religious group, said the China Tribunal, which is investigating the issue.", "authors": ["Will Martin"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5c1a477e2ab31e06422c61d6-1136-568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
