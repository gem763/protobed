She is an actress and journalist.\n\nIn January 2004, Schwalbach Smith appeared nude with a Superman look-alike for Playboy Magazine's 50th Anniversary Issue.\n\nThe photograph was taken by her husband.\n\nGetting dirty and loving it: Smith and Mewes smiled at each other as they got clay on their hands\n\nThey had a long history: The director and the actor made jokes when at the podium\n\nAt long last: The duo have made dozens of movies and are now a part of history\n\nHis girl: Quinn was seen in a strapless red-and-white dress with a fun black-and-white cap over her flaxen locks\n\nIn July Affleck and Smith put their longtime rift aside.\n\nSmith took to social media with an emotional post to explain how the two managed to heal their wounds and admitted he missed Affleck 'terribly' during the feud.\n\nAffleck was also back into the fold to reprise his character Holden McNeil in the Jay And Silent Bob reboot.\n\nOld friends: Smith took to social media in July with an emotional post to explain how he and Affleck managed to heal their wounds following a decade long feud\n\nAffleck's casting came as a shock to many considering his years long bad blood with Smith.\n\nAware that fans would inevitably have questions, Smith shared two new snaps with Affleck and costar Mewes along with a lengthy explanation in the caption.\n\nThe caption began with a joke: 'MY BOYFRIEND\u2019S BACK!'\n\n'When the trailer for @jayandsilentbob Reboot dropped (link in my bio), folks found out a few of our secrets - one of the biggest being that @benaffleck is back as Holden McNeil!\n\n'The co-creator of #bluntmanandchronic and friend of #jayandsilentbob plays a crucial role in the Reboot and his scene is one of the best bits of cinema I\u2019ve ever been involved with.\n\n'It\u2019s absolutely magical and life-affirming and all the things I really care about now, post-heart attack.'\n\nAt some point roughly 10 years ago the pair had a falling out and stopped speaking entirely.\n\n'When the trailer for @jayandsilentbob Reboot dropped (link in my bio), folks found out a few of our secrets - one of the biggest being that @benaffleck is back as Holden McNeil!' (pictured in the trailer\n\nWhen Mewes and Smith got together to reboot Jay And Silent Bob, the scene with Affleck was never part of the plan and was later added when the pair reunited.\n\n'This scene - and more importantly, my reunion with a guy who I\u2019ve missed terribly for nearly a decade - only happened because of @kevinmccarthytv.'\n\nThe Chasing Amy director went on to explain that while doing press for his Netflix movie Triple Frontier, a reporter asked Ben if he was involved in the reboot.\n\n'And Ben said no, but he was available,' Smith continued. 'So producer @jordanmonsanto said \"Call Ben.\" I told her, \"That\u2019s just some nice s**t to say at a junket. He wasn\u2019t serious.\"'\n\nFeud: Affleck and Smith were close friends for decades and worked together on six films, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, Jersey Girl and Clerks II, but hadn't spoken in nearly 10 years (pictured in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back)\n\nAfter some pressure from his co-stars and co-producers, Kevin said he reached out to the Batman star despite his fears of rejection.\n\nHe fired off a text to the Oscar winner: 'To paraphrase the sad old King Osric in CONAN THE BARBARIAN? \"There comes a time when the jewels cease to sparkle, when the gold loses its luster, when the throne room becomes a prison, and all that is left is a director\u2019s love for the people he used to make pretend with.\"\n\n'And after a long beat of wondering how he\u2019d receive this, my estranged friend wrote back as only he could: \"Of course you still liken yourself to a king,\" he joked. And then \"Would be a pleasure to see you again, Old Man.\"\n\n'The co-creator of #bluntmanandchronic and friend of #jayandsilentbob plays a crucial role in the Reboot and his scene is one of the best bits of cinema I\u2019ve ever been involved with: it\u2019s absolutely magical and life-affirming and all the things I really care about now, post-heart attack.' (pictured in 2006)\n\nKevin explained that he's 'naturally, weepy' and 'was a blubbery mess' when he received the response.\n\n'Not only did we score an amazing scene for the flick, but I also got my friend back - all because of entertainment journalism. Thank you, #kevinmccarthytv,' he finished.\n\nAdding that the reporters simple questions 'not only allowed me to make an 8 page sequel to #chasingamy in the middle of #JayAndSilentBobReboot, it also brought back a massive missing piece of my heart.'\n\nWhile the exact reason why the pair stopped speaking is unclear, back in 2018 Kevin responded to a fan on social media who was curious about their falling out.\n\nWhen answering the question of what happened Smith tweeted: 'If I had to guess? It\u2019s because one of us has a big mouth and told too many candid stories that sometimes weren\u2019t his to tell, and the other one is Ben.'\n\nThings were so bad between the two that when Smith suffered a near fatal heart attack, Ben never reached out.\n\n'I didn\u2019t hear from Ben. Which is fine. Maybe he didn\u2019t even hear about it,' he told the Daily Beast. 'I think he probably plays a more prominent role in my mythology than I play in his mythology anymore.'\n\nWhen answering the question of what happened Smith previously tweeted: 'If I had to guess? It\u2019s because one of us has a big mouth and told too many candid stories that sometimes weren\u2019t his to tell, and the other one is Ben.' (pictured in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back in 2001)\n\nThe trailer for the Jay and Silent Bob Reboot lays out the premise of the film.\n\nThe titular characters embark on a cross-country trip to ensure that a reboot is not made of their 2001 film Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.\n\n'The stoner icons who first hit the screen 25 years ago in CLERKS are back!' according to a studio synopsis of the movie.\n\n'When Jay and Silent Bob discover that Hollywood is rebooting an old movie based on them, the clueless duo embark on another cross-country mission to stop it all over again!'\n\nTouchstones: Kevin Smith and Jason Mewes returned for The Jay and Silent Bob Reboot in a trailer that debuted at Comic-Con in San Diego on Thursday\n\nSmith's real-life daughter Harley appears in the film as Jay's daughter named Millennium Falcon.
