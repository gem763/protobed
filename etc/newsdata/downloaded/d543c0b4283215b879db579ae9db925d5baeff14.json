Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) was asked yesterday whether she believes it\u2019s appropriate or not for a president to solicit campaign assistance from a foreign power. She wouldn\u2019t answer directly \u2013 despite repeated journalistic efforts.\n\nGiven how embarrassing it was to see the far-right Iowan struggle through a clumsy effort at dodging a simple question, it stood to reason other Republicans would see that and realize they should probably come up with some kind of coherent answer. And yet, a reporter asked Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) this morning:\n\n\u201cDo you believe it\u2019s appropriate for the president of the United States to ask a foreign leader to investigate a political rival? Yes or no?\u201d\n\nGardner \u2013 who happens to be up for re-election in an increasingly \u201cblue\u201d state next year \u2013 said a lot of words, none of which answered the question. Another reporter asked the same question, and the Colorado Republican again dodged.\n\nThe back and forth continued for a while, but Gardner simply wouldn\u2019t say whether he believes it\u2019s appropriate for a president to ask foreign officials to go after a domestic rival.\n\nThe GOP senator was, however, willing to blame House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for a \u201cpartisan partisanized effort.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not a trick question. One need not be a strategic genius or professional messaging consultant to figure this out.\n\nHere, I\u2019ll help: \u201cWhile it\u2019s obviously inappropriate for any American official to seek foreign assistance in a campaign, I don\u2019t believe Donald Trump\u2019s actions rise to the level of \u2018high crimes and misdemeanors.\u2019 If Americans disagree, they\u2019ll have a chance to decide his fate a year from now.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not how I personally would answer the question if I were a member of Congress, but it would at least be coherent. So why can\u2019t Republicans like Gardner and Ernst say this? Probably because they\u2019re terrified of what would happen \u2013 in the White House, on Fox News, etc. \u2013 if they used the words \u201cTrump\u201d and \u201cinappropriate\u201d in the same sentence.\n\nThe result is a series of cringe-worthy interviews featuring senators who know the truth, but can\u2019t quite muster the courage to say it out loud.\n\nOther congressional Republicans should take note and prepare accordingly. Either Donald Trump can pressure foreign officials to help his political campaign or he can\u2019t. Either GOP officials are comfortable with their president\u2019s actions or they\u2019re not.\n\nPostscript: In 2016, Gardner said he couldn\u2019t possibly support the Clinton/Kaine ticket because its victory would \u201cfinalize the destruction of the rule of law.\u201d That sounds to me like a partisan partisanized answer.", "description": "Is it appropriate for a president to ask foreign officials to go after a domestic rival?
