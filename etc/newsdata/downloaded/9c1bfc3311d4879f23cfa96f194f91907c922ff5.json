Chris Wylie and Brittany Kaiser are two youngish, idealistic, clever people who got involved in some very dark stuff orchestrated by unscrupulous operators. Eventually, both realised they had become accomplices to activities that were at best unethical and at worst illegal, realisations that prompted them to break loose and blow the whistle. And both their memoirs, though very different in style and tone, are attempts to atone for the societal damage their respective collaborations with the devil have done.\n\nBut there the similarities end. Wylie is an unorthodox, gay Canadian who is passionately interested in fashion; Kaiser is a straight, liberal American interested in human rights and other humanitarian causes. And yet both were ensnared in the same net: a sinister dirty-tricks, election-manipulating \u201cconsultancy\u201d outfit called SCL run by a sociopathic old Etonian, Alexander Nix, which eventually spawned another company called Cambridge Analytica (CA), which was the vehicle that did most of the democratic damage.\n\nCA succeeded by finding a way of leveraging people\u2019s personal data \u2013 as revealed by its activities on Facebook in conjunction with data purchased from credit agencies, data brokers and other sources \u2013 to offer psychological profiles in ways that would reveal the kinds of political messages to which they might be receptive. \u201cFacebook,\u201d as Wylie puts it early in his account, \u201cis no longer just a company. It\u2019s a doorway into the minds of the American people and Mark Zuckerberg left that door open for Cambridge Analytica, the Russians and who knows how many others.\u201d\n\nThe idea that Facebook \u201clikes\u201d could provide a window into people\u2019s souls did not originate with CA, but in research conducted at Cambridge University (much to that institution\u2019s subsequent chagrin). As a talented geek who is fascinated by human behaviour, however, Wylie immediately understood the significance of the research and had the programming skills to build scalable tools for deducing from the data psychological traits of voters that could then be exploited for political purposes.\n\nAs a result, his book is \u2013 inadvertently \u2013 an invaluable primer on psychological warfare and behaviour modification. It\u2019s clear that Wylie played a key role in developing the technology that enabled political operators to effectively target messages to individual voters. And although nobody knows what \u2013 ultimately \u2013 makes an individual cast a vote one way or another, what now seems incontrovertible is that social media can suppress voter turnout by finding people who are doubtful or reluctant about voting and persuading them to stay home.\n\nEver since Brexit and the election of Trump there has been consistent scepticism about whether social media played a significant role in the political upheavals of 2016. That scepticism began to be dented when Carole Cadwalladr and the Observer revealed what Cambridge Analytica had been up to with Facebook data. But paradoxically, it was also boosted by Channel 4\u2019s undercover filming that accompanied Cadwalladr\u2019s scoop. The film showed the SCL boss, Nix, in his pomp, where he came over as a nattily suited trust-funder constantly exaggerating the capacity of his firm to achieve its clients\u2019 objectives. How could such an obvious chancer bring about political earthquakes?\n\nThe answer is that he couldn\u2019t, but the tech-heads who worked for the firm could \u2013 and did. Given that Wylie was at the heart of this work, and that he displayed real sociological understanding of what the data was revealing, his account provides a useful, crystal-clear exposition of the power of psychographic profiling when it\u2019s done right. And it suggests that electoral campaigning has now moved on to a different level.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Brittany Kaiser.

Having spent a few weeks studying how the party went about electioneering, in late 2011, he explained to Nick Clegg and his team that \u201cthe data showed that Lib Dem voters were ideological, they were stubborn and they hated compromise. But the party has become the antithesis of these attributes when it joined a coalition government with the Tories. The party was composed of uncompromising supporters and yet it was operating in a government birthed out of compromising its principles. This type of compromise was a betrayal of Lib Dem voters\u2019 ideals and it was bound to drive people out of the party.\u201d He was never invited back.\n\nBrittany Kaiser was a different kind of naif \u2013 a well-educated, middle-class, well-meaning admirer of Obama who was interested in politics, and who desperately needed a job because her parents back in the US had lost their savings and were, basically, almost dependent on her. So, by a series of accidents she was introduced to Nix, who, to her surprise, hired her and taught her how to make PowerPoint presentations to pitch for clients.\n\nShe turned out to be good at it and her book is a whirlwind account of three frenetic years during which SCL (and CA) appeared to thrive. She found herself seduced by the glamour (tea with Rebekah Mercer, meetings with prime ministers and billionaires, spats with Kellyanne Conway), enjoying being able to funnel money to her parents, alternately bullied and indulged by Nix, perpetually exhausted, hooked on the adrenaline but also needing the money.\n\nIn the end, though, it got to her. At 2:30am on the night of Trump\u2019s inauguration ball, dead drunk, dancing with Mercer she suddenly has an epiphany. \u201cBob and Bekah Mercer,\u201d she thought, \u201cnow represented a new kind of force in American politics: wealthy donors with the money and the wherewithal to use their dollars in measurable, provable ways to make sure their expenditures produces some kind of return on investment.\u201d\n\nThe \u201creturn\u201d was Brexit and Trump. And she was part of it. So her book is some kind of penance for that.\n\n\u2022 Mindf*ck: Inside Cambridge Analytica\u2019s Plot to Break the World by Christopher Wylie is published by Profile (\u00a320).
