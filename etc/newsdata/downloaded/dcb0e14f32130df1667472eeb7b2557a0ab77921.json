For millennia, as Jews were a people without a country, many of the dishes evolved from where their communities had lived, vastly varying depending on geography and cultural influences.\n\nAt Rosh Hashanah, no Ashkenazi Jews, whose ancestors settled along the Rhine river in France and Germany, go without apples and honey, for instance. But for Sephardic and Mizrahi Jewish communities (with ties to the Iberian Peninsula and to the Middle East and North Africa, respectively), pomegranates and dates are among the mandatory symbolic foods. So rich and vast is the expanse of Jewish cuisine that we are blessed with an embarrassment of riches in choosing dishes for our new year\u2019s meal. While you can play it safe and cook only the familiar-to-you foods, you can also go beyond the figurative pale and introduce something new to the table.\n\n[Make the recipe: Autumn Salad With Farro, Apple and Roasted Persimmon]\n\nThis fall, three dynamic new books on Jewish cuisine in its many forms \u2014 chef Einat Admony\u2019s \u201cShuk,\u201d Adeena Sussman\u2019s \u201cSababa\u201d and Leah Koenig\u2019s \u201cThe Jewish Cookbook\u201d \u2014 are here to help us cook the Rosh Hashanah meal of our dreams, whether these dishes are from close to home or far afield. Admony, who was born in Israel and has made New York her home for over a decade, serves food influenced by her Iranian, Iraqi and Yemenite backgrounds. Israeli food is, as the kids say, hot right now, and some credit should go to Admony, who at her New York restaurants has refused to Americanize what she grew up eating and instead (rightly) assumed that if she serves it, people will take to it.\n\nIsraeli cuisine, Admony said in a phone interview, is harder to define than Jewish, as it pulls significant influences from Palestinian and other Arab cultures, as well as Northern African, Mediterranean, Eastern European, Iranian and others \u2014 a bona fide melting pot of flavors and techniques.\n\nSussman, who co-authored model Chrissy Teigen\u2019s cookbooks (among others), melds Israeli food and ingredients found at the shuks (markets) in Tel Aviv, where she lives, with her American sensibilities.\n\nAnd Koenig, a Brooklyn native who has been writing about Jewish cuisine for about 10 years, has produced a tome spanning the Jewish culinary canon from achik chuchuk (tomato and onion salad popular in Bukharian Jewish cuisine) to zeeuwse bolussen (Dutch coiled cinnamon buns). All three books are vibrant, exciting and hunger-inducing.\n\n[Make the recipe: Wine-Braised Pot Roast]\n\nI decided to build a Rosh Hashanah seder around dishes from these three books, bridging the gap between geographies to showcase something of a pan-Jewish approach to the holidays. If you\u2019re hosting a large crowd, round it out with honeyed carrots and savory noodle kugel. At just about every dinner, casual or festive, I also serve punchy, peppery arugula dressed with lemon juice, olive oil and flaky sea salt \u2014 a simple side salad that complements whatever I have cooked.\n\nFor this year\u2019s dinner, I propose (and hear me out) that instead of a brisket, you cook a pot roast, specifically one braised in wine. Koenig first encountered the dish while on her honeymoon in Rome: She was a vegetarian at the time, but the Shabbat dinner she and her husband attended had a lot of meat courses. Taking the phrase \u201cwhen in Rome\u201d to its most literal level, Koenig tried the pot roast and was struck by how clean and familiar, but more streamlined and elegant, the flavors were than those of the briskets of her childhood, which had ingredients such as onion soup mixes. \u201cThis is what your holiday main should be,\u201d she told me, \u201csomething that is comforting and doesn\u2019t have a lot of heavy lifting, the embodiment of the relaxation of the holiday.\u201d\n\nSeparately, while I love me some brisket, you never know how chewy or tender it will be until you tuck into it. The same cut, made exactly the same way, is at times tender and other times stringy and chewy \u2014 so you\u2019re rolling the dice. With a pot roast, there\u2019s nary a doubt. Give the meat a quick, aggressive sear to get a good crust, and then, as Ron Popeil would say, \u201cset it and forget it.\u201d A few hours later, the meat is tender, succulent, yielding. If you can manage it, be patient and give it an overnight rest \u2014 so the flavors age and meld \u2014 and it transforms from delicious to astounding. And, yes, you can make this pot roast in a slow cooker, thanks for asking!\n\nOne cannot live on pot roast alone (though some have tried, I\u2019m sure), so to balance out the meal, and to complement the hearty beef, a sturdy grain such as farro does the trick. Admony\u2019s farro salad, drawing on her Iranian roots, works beautifully with the pot roast, cutting through the fattiness with crunchy, tart bites of apple, juicy, puckery pomegranate and sweet, caramelized bits of roasted persimmon. If you can\u2019t find persimmon this time of year, add some chopped dates \u2014 another symbolic Rosh Hashanah ingredient. A sweet-tart dressing with lemon juice and silan (date syrup), a popular ingredient in Middle Eastern cooking, lends bright, sunny notes to the chewy grains.\n\n[Make the recipe: Tahini Salted Caramel Tart]\n\nIf sweetness is the theme of Jewish new year foods, dessert seems mandatory. This year, in addition to my beloved apple cake, I\u2019m serving Sussman\u2019s stunning and decadent salted caramel tahini tart (which might be a no-go for strict kosher households, due to dairy restrictions). Described in the book as \u201cthe Gal Gadot of tarts,\u201d it immediately seduced me, and I\u2019m so glad to have succumbed. Sussman said she figured the caramel could benefit from tahini\u2019s earthy notes and give the otherwise familiar tart a more nuanced taste. I mostly followed the recipe, but decided to dock the dough and line it with weights during an initial bake, as tart doughs like to puff up and shrink. And because I like a bit of contrast in my sweets, I upped the salt in the caramel a touch to get it just to that \u201csalted\u201d territory.\n\nPaired with a tangy labneh-whipped cream (labneh being another indispensable ingredient in Israel and the rest of the Middle East), the tart manages to be light and luxurious. A small sliver will satisfy the sweetest tooth, making it a great dessert to serve a crowd. Oohs and aahs are guaranteed, and whatever your guests\u2019 geography and religious adherence, should their year take on the same sweetness and luxury, you can take full credit for their good fortunes.\n\nMore from Voraciously:\n\nHow to pick, prep and cook leafy greens \u2014 a nutritional (and delicious) powerhouse\n\nDon\u2019t want to mess up that big piece of meat you just bought?
