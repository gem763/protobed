It is then predicted to take a northward turn toward Florida\u2019s east coast, where some coastal residents have been put under evacuation orders.\n\n\u201cDorian is expected to remain a catastrophic hurricane during the next few days,\u201d forecasters said in a 2 p.m. update.\n\nThe Category 5 storm has become the strongest hurricane on modern record to hit the area.

He worried about island residents who hadn\u2019t heeded calls to move to safety.\n\n\u201cThis will put us to a test that we\u2019ve never confronted before,\u201d Mr. Minnis said in a Sunday afternoon press conference. \u201cThis is a deadly storm and a monster of a storm.\u201d\n\nDarren Henfield, the Bahamas foreign minister, said in a video posted on Twitter that he had participated in efforts in the Abaco Islands to evacuate people from damaged homes and buildings.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing our best,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re strong, and we\u2019re going to be OK.\u201d\n\nThe National Hurricane Center on Sunday called Dorian\u2019s battering of the Abaco Islands \u201ca life-threatening situation.\u201d\n\nThe storm had grown larger, with hurricane force winds extending up to 45 miles out from Dorian\u2019s center. It had maximum sustained winds of about 185 miles an hour, with some gusts over 220 mph, and was moving west at about 5 mph.\n\nIn Florida, mandatory evacuation orders were issued for low-lying and other at-risk areas in Brevard, Martin and Palm Beach, St. Johns, St. Lucie and Volusia counties, including the area in Palm Beach where President Trump \u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort is located. Other counties, including Flagler, Glades and Osceola, issued voluntary evacuation orders for some areas, according to the state\u2019s Division of Emergency Management.\n\nDorian\u2019s Path Potential track area 8 a.m. Friday N.C. S.C. Charleston GA. 8 a.m. Thursday Atlantic Ocean FLA. 8 a.m. Wednesday Orlando 11 a.m. Sunday 8 a.m. Tuesday Miami 8 a.m. Monday 200 miles BAHAMAS 200 km\n\nThough forecasts show the storm is unlikely to make landfall in the state, that remains a possibility, the hurricane center said. A hurricane warning was in effect from Jupiter Inlet in Palm Beach County to the Volusia-Brevard County line in central Florida. The storm is forecast to then march north toward Georgia and the Carolinas, causing flooding and strong winds.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Sunday the storm remained a serious threat to the state and urged residents to prepare for it and heed local officials\u2019 instructions.\n\n\u201cThe strength of this storm cannot be underestimated,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look at the forecast, it absolutely could impact the coast and turn once it hits the coast. So we\u2019ve got to prepare for that eventuality.\u201d\n\nThe governors of Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina declared states of emergency.\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster issued mandatory evacuation orders starting at noon on Monday for coastal residents in eight counties. The evacuations also applied to health-care facilities licensed by the state. He called for schools and government offices in those counties to close, starting Tuesday.\n\nHow to Tell if a Hurricane Is Headed Your Way What you need to know about forecast maps and storm paths\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said the storm already is kicking up dangerous surf and riptides along the state\u2019s coast. \u201cRight now, Hurricane Dorian is fierce,\u201d Mr. Cooper said. \u201cNorth Carolina has to take this seriously. Be ready.\u201d\n\nLate Sunday, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp ordered a mandatory evacuation of the state\u2019s coast starting at midday Monday.\n\nDuring a briefing at Federal Emergency Management Agency headquarters Sunday afternoon, Mr. Trump said the hurricane\u2019s effects \u201cwill be felt hundreds of miles or more from the eye of the storm and long before it potentially makes landfall.\u201d The president said most of the Eastern Seaboard will be affected, \u201cand some of it very, very severely.\u201d\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Have you had to prepare for a hurricane or major storm? What helped you weather through it? Join the conversation below.\n\nDorian\u2019s changing trajectory convinced some travel providers to revise their contingency efforts. Orlando International Airport dropped plans to close on Monday, citing the reduced likelihood of the storm hitting central Florida.\n\nAirlines added extra flights over the weekend and eased restrictions on ticket changes, though some carriers closed services to prevent aircraft and crews being caught by the storm. Spirit Airlines Inc., one of the biggest operators at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, had canceled a fifth of its total flights Sunday, according to FlightAware, an air travel tracking service.\n\nPete Gaynor, the acting administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said the track of Dorian remained uncertain near Florida and the south Atlantic seaboard and he urged residents in its path to remain vigilant.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t dismiss this storm. We are not out of it,\u201d Mr. Gaynor said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cLife-threatening, dangerous surge, water, wind is coming your way. Take the time now to prepare you and your family.\u201d\n\nMr. Gaynor was asked about the Trump administration\u2019s recent decision to shift more than $100 million in federal disaster aid to provide for more detention beds for migrants near the U.S.-Mexico border. He said the shift was \u201cnot affecting our preparedness whatsoever for Dorian.\u201d\n\nActing Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan said Sunday that federal money earmarked for transfer from disaster relief to border issues hadn\u2019t yet been moved and that there had been no impact on the government\u2019s ability to respond to the hurricane because of it.\n\n\u201cThere will be no impact of the potential reprogramming on our ability to respond to this storm,\u201d Mr. McAleenan said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d Mr. McAleenan said the Disaster Recovery Fund contains approximately $25 billion and that the potential reallocation of resources to the southwest border amounted to about $155 million.\n\n\u2014Dan Molinski, Andrew Restuccia, Doug Cameron, Ken Thomas and Gordon Lubold contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Erin Ailworth at Erin.Ailworth@wsj.com and Arian Campo-Flores at arian.campo-flores@wsj.com", "description": "Dorian, a Category 5 storm that has become the strongest hurricane on modern record to hit the northwestern Bahamas, thrashed the Abaco Islands with \u201ccatastrophic winds and storm surge.\u201d", "authors": ["Erin Ailworth", "Arian Campo-Flores", "Erin.Ailworth Wsj.Com", "Arian.Campo-Flores Dowjones.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103190/social"}
