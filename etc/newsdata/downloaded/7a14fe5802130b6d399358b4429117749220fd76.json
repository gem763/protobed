You may overhear them discussing preparations for their time away, and we advise that you do not engage. \"Please disregard terminology 'loadout', 'sesh', 'we on', 'no scope' and 'them Ws'. As a citizen, this is none of your concern.\" In the end the letter is signed off from 'Colin O'Duty'.\n\nDon't Miss 750 SHARES 2 K SHARES 7.3 K SHARES 123 SHARES\n\nWhile all this is all good fun, no one really would send such a letter to their bosses (and risk getting fired). But one man that goes by the name of Chris Carter (Twitter handle @the_sarge1984) had the guts to send it to his boss to see whether he gets lucky.\n\nTwitter/Chris Carter @the_sarge1984\n\nSadly (but unsurprisingly), he didn't as his boss had a rather befitting reply stating \"You can kiss my a**! If anyone is having tomorrow off, it's me.\"\n\nChris, who works as a refrigerator engineer shared this with LADbible and said, \"Me and my team leader regularly play CoD together and we also play Airsoft together. We are both in work today and on the same site, ribbing each other about CoD and trying to get finished first to see if we can get off early.\"\n\nIsn't he the coolest boss or what?", "description": "While Call of Duty Mobile has been the talk of the town recently, the newly unveiled Call of Duty: Modern Warfare on PC and consoles has gotten the entire gaming community excited.
