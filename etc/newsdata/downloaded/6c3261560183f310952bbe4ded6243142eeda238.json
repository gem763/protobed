(AP) - From shooting pigeons to sipping Chardonnay, supporters of the Hegins Park bore witness to a transforming period over the last 20 years.\n\nThe Fred Coleman Memorial Labor Day Pigeon Shoot ended with the 65th annual event in 1998, and over the past two decades, community leaders have developed new ways to raise funds for the park - including the Schuylkill County Wine Festival.\n\nThe thousands who were expected to visit Hegins for a relaxing day of wine and music over the weekend were a stark contrast to the clash of animal rights activists and shoot supporters, which led to hundreds of arrests in the late 1990s and as many as 8,000 estimated spectators for the one-day event.\n\nThe Hegins Labor Day Committee, overseen by Chairman J. Robert \u201cBob\u201d Tobash, canceled what would have been the 66th pigeon shoot in 1999 following a state Supreme Court\u2019s decision. It ruled that officers with the Pennsylvania Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals had jurisdiction over the local event.\n\n\u201cI remember being my dad\u2019s \u2018tail,\u2019 \u201d Chris Tobash, of Hegins, recently said. He was a teenager at the time his father, who died in 2014, was committee chairman.\n\n\u201cI spent a lot of time following him around. Beer used to be sold in returnable glass bottles, and I used to go around the park collecting them,\u201d he said. He\u2019d also run errands in the park when someone needed change, for instance, or had a question for his father.\n\nHe remembers there was an uncertainty about what protesters coming into the park could do.\n\n\u201cThe animal rights people were doing more and more things,\u201d he said about incidents of violence across the country.\n\nAt the 1997 shoot, vandals broke eight windows at the Tobash Insurance Agency office in Hegins. It was also the year that seven animal-rights activists bound themselves in concrete and chains across Route 25 with the intention of disrupting the shoot. As many as 31 people were arrested that year for offenses ranging from liquor control violations to harassment, disorderly conduct and criminal trespass, according to The Republican-Herald archives. Several of those arrested were from out-of-state, but others charged were also from the county.\n\nHomecoming\n\nWhen the pigeon shoot began in 1934, its goal was to finance the development and upkeep of Hegins Park, while it also provided a homecoming atmosphere for community members who gathered to watch the marksmen.\n\nFred Coleman, who was born in Hegins on March 7, 1874, was a famous marksman, avid hunter and munitions specialist who shot in exhibitions worldwide. He was known as \u201cChampion Wing Shot of the World.\u201d Coleman, who later moved to Maine, was invited back to the Hegins event as a guest shooter on several occasions.\n\nThe shoot grew - from 73 entrants to a high of more than 335 shooters in the 1980s - and eventually generated an average of $6,000 to $15,000 annually.\n\n\u201cIn 50 years, the Labor Day (Shoot) Committee has contributed to the park association approximately $250,000,\u201d according to the book \u201cHegins Labor Day Shoot, 50th Anniversary, 1934-1984.\u201d The book, which includes local history and a record of shooters\u2019 scores, was put together by the committee with an introduction by Bob Tobash.\n\nThe shoot was probably on its way out as interest waned, before the protesters began attending in the last dozen years of the event, some park volunteers surmised.\n\nDelbert Hauck, current president of the Hegins Park Association, said the event was traditionally a community gathering like a town reunion, and relied on many volunteers.\n\n\u201cAs kids growing up, we spent a lot of time at the park. I played football here,\u201d Hauck said. He remembers in the 1960s and 1970s, Hegins Park was where the Tri-Valley football games were played.\n\nToday, the wooded park includes courts for tennis and basketball, softball and Teener and Little League baseball fields, a playground, the Bob Tobash Walking Trail and fields where midget football teams practice. There are several buildings, a beer house, eating house, benches, picnic tables and two stages.\n\nThe park association gave land valued at $15,000 and a $10,000 donation so the Tri-Valley Community Pool could be built in the 1970s at the west end of the park.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a terrific park,\u201d Hauck said.\n\nOver the years, funds raised have helped with building maintenance and upkeep, roofing and painting, field maintenance, tractor and mowing equipment, and with the costs of liability insurance.\n\nTwo members each from St. John\u2019s United Methodist Church, Friedens Lutheran Church, Friedens United Church of Christ and the Hegins Valley Fire Rescue sit on the 12-member park association board. There are also at-large community members.\n\nBash without the Bang\n\nOnce the pigeon shoot ended, organizers tried to come up with another fundraiser. The \u201cBash without the Bang\u201d was offered, which included a chicken barbecue and music in the park. The event made about $3,000 to $4,000, Bob\u2019s wife, Mary Tobash, said.\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t anything for a while,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had the shoot and did everything that we could, but every year, it\u2019s gotten harder. I\u2019m getting older too. I love the park. Bob would take care of what I didn\u2019t take care of.\u201d\n\nA few years later, Mary Tobash said she and her husband spoke with local wineries that were interested in starting a wine festival.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worked out very well. Folks have had a good experience and have made a day of it, with the live entertainment, the wine and good food. It has turned out to be a time for family and friends to get together and enjoy the day,\u201d she said.\n\nThe one-day wine festival generates an estimated $25,000 to $30,000 for the park, according to Mary Tobash.\n\nIn turn, the park association continues its tradition of donating funds to several community organizations, including the three churches, fire company, library and swimming pool.\n\nThe park is used several months of the year, hosting reunions, picnics, sporting events, the fire company carnival, the wine festival and the Hegins Valley Arts & Crafts Faire.\n\n\u201cWe have something unique here in the county, and we want to continue to be stewards of this,\u201d Hauck said.\n\nPigeons to wine\n\nTalk of a county wine festival began when Michael Masser, with Benigna\u2019s Creek Vineyard and Winery, was at the Hometown Farmers Market and caught up with Mark T. Major, who was former executive director of the Schuylkill County Visitors Bureau.\n\n\u201cI knew that Pennsylvania wineries were growing in number and other wine festivals were springing up,\u201d Major said.\n\nThe visitor\u2019s bureau presented seed money to a few countywide events, including the wine festival.\n\nMajor credits the winery families and park volunteers for the event\u2019s success.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a nice event and has really grown over the years. They\u2019re the ones that made it happen. \u2026 It\u2019s a proud accomplishment and probably one of my proudest moments,\u201d Major said.\n\nMasser said he wanted to have a countywide festival and thought Hegins Park was the perfect location due to its stand of shade trees as well as an open field for wineries to have their tents.\n\nBenigna\u2019s had held its own festivals for years at its vineyard in Klingerstown. Masser brought his idea before the park association and also invited a fellow wine producer, Tom Stutzman of Red Shale Ridge Vineyards in Hegins, to approach the board.\n\n\u201cI said I\u2019d help \u2018ramrod\u2019 it,\u201d Masser said of promoting and assisting at the first county festival.\n\n\u201cMy boy played baseball at the park and I\u2019ve seen the improvements and renovations. The park association has run a top-notch wine festival from day one and they pull off a good event,\u201d Masser said.\n\nThe first year of the wine festival was a success, Stutzman said, drawing about 1,600 people and participation from seven wineries. Today, the festival hosts 12 wineries.\n\nStutzman\u2019s late father, Warren Stutzman, was a former board president and a fervent shoot supporter and park volunteer. Tom Stutzman remembers the work involved with preparing for the pigeon shoot once protesters started attending, including erecting a temporary fence and the cleanup and fence tear-down after the shoot.\n\nAlthough there\u2019s still preparation for the wine festival, it\u2019s a bit more manageable. Volunteers began setting up tents Wednesday, and on Saturday were scheduled to conduct last-minute preparations, like setting out trash cans and picnic tables.\n\n\u201cThe amazing thing about this event is, once we close at 6 p.m., by about 8 p.m., the park looks like it did before we started. We get pickup trucks in here to pick up the trash. It\u2019s a whole different ballgame.\n\n\u201cWhat people didn\u2019t realize about the shoot was that we really didn\u2019t make money off of the shooters. We made most of the money in the beer stand,\u201d Stutzman said.\n\nThe wine festival\u2019s legacy has been a positive one.\n\n\u201cTo be able to clear at least $20,000 to $25,000 to maintain the park, everyone\u2019s happy,\u201d Stutzman said.\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nhttps://bit.ly/2zMAqGV\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Pottsville Republican and Herald, http://www.republicanherald.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "From shooting pigeons to sipping Chardonnay, supporters of the Hegins Park bore witness to a transforming period over the last 20 years.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Vicki Terwilliger", "The", "Pottsville"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/07/exchange-from_pigeon_shoot_to_wine_00600_c0-134-2000-1300_s1770x1032.jpg?04228106fe81f7eb168e6d66e25593b373ca6a99", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
