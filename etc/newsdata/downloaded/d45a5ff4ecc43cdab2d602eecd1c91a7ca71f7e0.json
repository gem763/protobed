The US has said the Houthi rebels, who are the subject of a military operation being carried out by Saudi Arabia and supported by the US and UK, were not equipped for such a type of attack.\n\nIran, meanwhile, has denied the claims, and accused the US of warmongering.

That now seems unlikely to happen.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr Trump told reporters: \u201cI never rule anything out, but I prefer not meeting him.\u201d\n\nUS media, including CNN, has quoted anonymous US officials as saying the attacks originated in Iran.\n\nThree officials told Reuters the attack was launched from Iran\u2019s southwest, and that it involved both cruise missiles and drones. The officials did not provide evidence or detail the US intelligence they used to make the assessments.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
