According to an interview he did with CNBC his primary complain is that Libra will be a \u201cclosed system\u201d or a \u201cwalled garden\u201d as he calls it.\n\nThis basically means that Libra will be largely controlled by a team of executives. The power will not be in the hands of the people who use it, but in those who have developed it. In other words, Libra will be centralized.\n\nThis is interesting coming from Treacher considering he works for a crypto venture that many enthusiasts, users and analysts alike refer to as centralized itself. At press time, many of Ripple\u2019s XRP units (upwards of 50 percent or more) are still in the hands of Ripple executives, meaning that they are not available to the public. Those at the top remain in charge of the cryptocurrency and serve as the primary owners.\n\nThis goes against the main notion of cryptocurrency considering that it is designed to give the general public access to better financial tools and control over their money. This rule applies to bitcoin, Ethereum and several other digital assets, but Ripple is left out of the \u201cdecentralized circle.\u201d\n\nTreacher still rushed to defend Ripple\u2019s present business model, claiming:\n\nIt\u2019s a network, but it has no perimeter. It connects with all of the players that want to use the technology.\n\nIn the end, Treacher is confident this system will get in Libra\u2019s way, and as we can see, problems are already stirring the pot. Very few people, for example, trust Libra\u2019s parent company following the Cambridge Analytica scandal that made headlines in early 2018. Even more disturbing is the idea that less than three percent of social media users say they would willingly use the digital coin.\n\nLastly, the U.S. Congress has been particularly harsh towards Libra, grilling lead developer David Marcus and questioning whether the company could really keep people\u2019s financial data safe.\n\nBakkt Didn\u2019t Do Anything; Why Will Libra?\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say, however, that Treacher isn\u2019t confident in Libra\u2019s potential. He comments that it could still be a \u201cgood thing\u201d given that a \u201cSilicon Angle giant\u201d is moving into the crypto space. He believes that the company could potentially do a lot to legitimize digital currency once and for all, though in many ways, this is also questionable.\n\nIt was argued by several analysts and industry experts that the new ICE platform Bakkt, designed to bring institutional players closer to crypto, would ultimately legitimize the space. At press time, however, it\u2019s being blamed for bitcoin\u2019s sudden price crash in that it failed to garner any serious attention after \u201copening for business.\u201d", "description": "At press time, Libra is garnering criticism from an unlikely source: Ripple's Marcus Treacher, who comments that it's a \"closed system.\"", "authors": ["Nick Marinoff"], "top_image": "https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/https://s3.amazonaws.com/lbn-s3/2018/10/shutterstock_1022427295-ripple-xrp.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
