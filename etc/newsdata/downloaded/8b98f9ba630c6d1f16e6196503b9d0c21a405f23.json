It says it wants to help an \u201cunder siege\u201d industry switch to electric car production.\n\nIt comes as measures to phase out the internal combustion engine gathering pace across Europe. Earlier this month, Denmark called for a plan to phase out diesel and petrol cars and allow a ban on their sale by 2030. It was backed by 10 other EU countries.\n\nLabour has already pledged to provide \u00a33bn to invest in electric car models and technology. It will exempt new investment in plant and machinery from business rates. Another \u00a32bn will go towards the construction of three battery plants.\n\nThe internal combustion engine policy comes after Labour\u2019s annual conference last month voted for the UK to have a net-zero carbon target by 2030 \u2013 a target that senior party figures deem impossible to achieve. The measure is unlikely to make it into Labour\u2019s next manifesto, but it is setting out an ambitious plan to combat the climate emergency.\n\nRebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, said: \u201cThe automotive sector is one of the UK\u2019s industrial success stories. However, the sector is under siege from Brexit uncertainty and the Tory party\u2019s lack of ambition on electrification.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, we need to accelerate the shift away from fossil-powered cars if we\u2019re to tackle the climate emergency. If we want our automotive sector to flourish, we need a government who is not afraid to intervene.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s vital that we work alongside unions to create a plan for a just transition for workers employed in the automotive sector.\u201d", "description": "Outlawing the sale of internal combustion engine vehicles will help tackle the climate emergency, says shadow business secretary", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31fa27618b860dc0c20670e70d174c871792f742/0_110_3300_1980/master/3300.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2ce278114fee1d3cd38d10de7fba898d", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
