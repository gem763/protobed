Trump\u2019s personal attorneys, Rudy Giuliani and Jay Sekulow, as well as top Republicans in the House and Senate were also invited but either declined or did not respond, he said.\n\nABC, CBS, NBC and Fox did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s requests for comment about whether White House officials also snubbed their programs.\n\n\"On one of the most critical news weeks of the last three years,\" the White House did not offer a guest, the President\u2019s personal lawyers and Congressional GOP leaders either declined to be on the show or did not respond, says @JakeTapper. #CNNSOTU pic.twitter.com/fpc2AIleEp \u2014 State of the Union (@CNNSotu) October 6, 2019\n\nThe lack of White House officials on Sunday shows didn\u2019t stop Trump and his allies from rolling out his defense.\n\nRepublican lawmakers appeared ready to push the White House\u2019s narrative on Sunday, shrugging off news that a second whistleblower had come forward with firsthand information about Trump\u2019s July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the center of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nRep. Chris Stewart (R-Utah), a member of the House Intelligence Committee that\u2019s investigating Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, told \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that he\u2019s \u201cnot at all\u201d concerned about a second whistleblower.\n\nGiuliani appeared on Fox News late Sunday morning, where he shouted at host Howard Kurtz for pushing back on his Ukraine conspiracy theories.\n\n\u201cCould you just listen for one second?\u201d Giuliani shouted at Kurtz, who later shook his head in disbelief. \u201cYou don\u2019t let me get a sentence out. You contradict me immediately.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether ABC, CBS and NBC refrained from inviting Giuliani on their programs Sunday after Biden\u2019s campaign sent a letter to the \u201cbig five\u201d networks last week urging them to not invite the former New York City mayor as a guest.\n\n\u201cGiving Rudy Giuliani valuable time on your air to push these lies in the first place is a disservice to your audience and a disservice to journalism,\u201d a pair of top Biden advisers wrote in the letter.\n\nTrump, whose White House hasn\u2019t given a press briefing in months, fired off a spate of tweets during the Sunday morning shows that attacked Democrats and doubled down on his call for Biden to be investigated.\n\n\u201cIt is INCREDIBLE to watch and read the Fake News and how they pull out all stops to protect Sleepy Joe Biden and his thrown out of the Military son, Hunter,\u201d the president tweeted. \u201cAs lawyers & others have stated, as President, I have an OBLIGATION to look into possible, or probable, CORRUPTION!\u201d\n\nNone of the Republican guests on this week\u2019s Sunday morning talk shows offered a direct answer when asked if there was a record of Trump asking foreign leaders to investigate any other American besides Biden on corruption.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\n2nd Whistleblower Comes Forward On Trump's Dealings With Ukraine: Attorneys\n\nColin Powell: Republicans Terrified Of Speaking Out Need To 'Get A Grip'\n\nPompeo Not Complying With Impeachment Inquiry, Senior House Democrat Says\n\nLove HuffPost?
