Standard Life Aberdeen \u2013 a group formed from the 2017 merger of Aberdeen and Standard Life, run by Gilbert\u2019s friend, Keith Skeoch \u2013 announced that its vice-chairman would be standing down next September.\n\nWinding down: But Martin Gilbert is set to become Revolut chairman\n\nUntil March this year, Gilbert, along with Skeoch, was co-chief executive of the group. He joked last week that his decision to step down and become vice-chair was motivated by a realisation that he had become the FTSE 100\u2019s second-oldest chief executive. But today, Gilbert reveals that he decided to jump because he feared being pushed out by new chairman Sir Douglas Flint.\n\n\u2018I wanted to take my destiny in my own hands,\u2019 he says. \u2018My decision to step down as CEO \u2013 and this is entirely my decision to do what I\u2019m doing \u2013 was because I didn\u2019t want to put Sir Douglas Flint into the position of having to tap me on the shoulder and say: \u201cCome on, it\u2019s time to go.\u201d \u2019\n\nWas an intervention from Flint on the cards? \u2018Definitely.\u2019 Why? \u2018Because he needs succession. At some stage \u2013 I don\u2019t know when he would have done it. But I never wanted to put him in that position\u2026 It\u2019s better to take control of your own destiny and go when people are still sorry to see you go rather than cling on.\u2019\n\nGilbert\u2019s City career is far from over. He remains on the board of mining giant Glencore, and is set \u2013 pending regulatory approval \u2013 to become the chairman of challenger bank Revolut.\n\nGilbert reveals that he decided to jump because he feared being pushed out by new chairman Sir Douglas Flint (pictured)\n\nNo doubt Gilbert\u2019s credentials in the start-up world will be boosted by his newly stubbled chin and surprising penchant for US rapper Eminem. But he may choose to remain quiet about his longstanding friendship with his old golfing companion, President Donald Trump. \u2018He divides the nation,\u2019 Gilbert acknowledges. \u2018I met him after he was nominated. I went to see him in New York after he won, and I haven\u2019t seen him since then.\u2019\n\nUnlike many of his high-profile peers, Gilbert has tried his best to stay out of politics in recent years. \u2018I can\u2019t remember,\u2019 is his response when asked how he voted in 2016\u2019s EU referendum.\n\nBut beneath Gilbert\u2019s attempt to dodge unwanted questions lies a serious point. He believes businessmen should hold back from expressing their personal views on politics \u2013 because doing so is generally counter-productive and turns voters\u2019 heads the other way.\n\nMartin Gilbert, 64: Eminem-loving golfer Gilbert likes |American rapper Eminem Family: Wife, Fiona, a professor of radiology at the University of Cambridge, and three children in their 20s and 30s. Lives: Aberdeen, with houses in London and Zermatt in the Swiss Alps. Hobbies: Skiing, golf and fishing. Favourite music: \u2018Eminem \u2013 every time I say this, it causes mayhem. I do like him, actually.\u2019 Favourite Eminem songs: Stan and Lose Yourself. \u2018I think he\u2019s brilliant.\u2019 Favourite film: Chariots Of Fire. Favourite books: Golf books by Colin Byrne. Breakfast: Crispy bacon and eggs.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s best not to,\u2019 he says. \u2018I\u2019ll tell you why: I\u2019m not sure that people really respect our opinions\u2026I remember being asked to give an opinion on Brexit by [a leading Remain campaigner]. I said: \u201cIf I give an opinion on it, it will swing another 100 voters against what you\u2019re trying to say.\u201d Because there is a deep cynicism around what people like myself think.\u2019\n\nClearly, not every financier felt the same way. It emerged shortly before the referendum, for instance, that US investment banks Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan had donated \u00a3500,000 each to the Remain campaign. \u2018It amazes me,\u2019 says Gilbert.\n\nAway from politics, Gilbert \u2013 unsurprisingly \u2013 is able to recall vividly his decades in the City. He still appears haunted by the split capital scandal of the early noughties.\n\nAberdeen was the largest fund manager accused of mis-selling by encouraging investors to put their money into investment trusts which they were wrongly told were virtually risk-free. The company agreed to pay out \u00a378million in compensation and Gilbert was accused by MPs of being a \u2018sophisticated snake oil salesman\u2019.\n\n\u2018It still amazes me we made it through,\u2019 says Gilbert, who was asked by his board to stay on to save the business and its reputation.\n\nMartin Gilber likes skiing, golf and fishing\n\nGilbert not only survived, but built up Aberdeen Asset Management \u2013 which recorded a profit of just \u00a387 in its first-ever financial year \u2013 into a FTSE 100 business with nearly 3,000 staff before its merger with Standard Life. Businessmen and financiers have probably been knighted for less \u2013 could there soon be a Sir Martin Gilbert?\n\nGilbert looks bashful, and points out there was a Sir Martin Gilbert, a noted historian and author who died in 2015. \u2018And I knew him!\u2019 says Gilbert, explaining that, in a twist of fate, a Washington hotel once inadvertently put him in Sir Martin\u2019s usual luxury suite. \u2018That was good,\u2019 he says. \u2018Sir Martin phoned me up and I had to buy him lunch.\u2019\n\nSo could there be a second Sir Martin Gilbert? \u2018No, no. I think Sir Douglas Flint must be the only financier knighted in about the last 20 years. It\u2019s not going to happen in the financial services world now, is it?\u2019\n\nGilbert doesn\u2019t appear to be leaving Standard Life Aberdeen on much of a high. Investor outflows and disappointing profits have seen the group\u2019s share price almost halve \u2013 to 271p this weekend \u2013 since it was formed in autumn 2017. The deal was dubbed an \u00a311billion merger, but the group\u2019s current market value is less than \u00a36.5 billion.\n\nDespite the group\u2019s recent struggles \u2013 caused mainly, Gilbert says, by external challenges facing the sector, including the rise of \u2018passive\u2019 funds which typically invest in indices like the FTSE and charge lower fees to clients \u2013 he feels that now is the right time to go.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m always taken by the remark \u2013 I\u2019m not sure who made it \u2013 that when things are going well you don\u2019t want to go, and when things are not going so well, you can\u2019t go.\n\n\u2018So I took the view that this was the ideal time to go because we\u2019re back on the way up.\u2019", "description": "Until March this year, Gilbert, along with Keith Skeoch, was co-chief executive of the group.
