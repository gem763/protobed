Clueless and outright insane.\n\nSeriously.\n\nThey don\u2019t seem to understand they can\u2019t just impeach Pence because they feel like it; granted, that\u2019s the main reason they\u2019re pushing to impeach Trump so perhaps we shouldn\u2019t be surprised at how easy they think it would be to remove Pence. And make Pelosi president? EL OH EL.\n\nAll they had to do was not be crazy.\n\nWatch this insanity.\n\nMSNBC plan to make Pelosi president: \u201cYou could impeach Pence first. The problem is that Donald Trump then has to name his replacement. But I think that maybe a deal could be struck where he was told, if you don\u2019t make a replacement, then Nancy Pelosi does become president.\" pic.twitter.com/JjsiEbNCyh \u2014 Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) October 6, 2019\n\nHuh?\n\nSuppose we should just be glad they finally figured out Hillary won\u2019t magically become president.\n\nOnly took them three whole years.\n\nWack-ville.\n\nCrazy-Town.\n\nInsane-o-land.\n\nYup.\n\n\ud83e\udd14 talk about conspiracies and crazy people \u2014 Gary (@garyalan82) October 6, 2019\n\nFile under D for Delusional. \u2014 JV Squad (@JVSquadX) October 6, 2019\n\nIf you\u2019re going to dream\u2026 I suppose.

They just keep sinking lower and lower.\n\nYet more evidence that the left isn\u2019t just insane, but they\u2019re insane idiots.
