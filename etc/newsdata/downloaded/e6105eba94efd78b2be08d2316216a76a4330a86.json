(Maddie Meyer/Getty Images)\n\nHere are my lists of players for Week 2. The rankings default to half-PPR settings, so for full-PPR or standard leagues, adjust players up or down a bit if they are particularly dependent on receiving volume or touchdowns. Following the rankings, I\u2019ll have some notes on players of particular interest this week.\n\n4 QB names of interest\n\nBaker Mayfield, Browns (positional rank this week 8): After laying a Week 1 stink bomb, Mayfield has a chance to drop bombs on the Jets\u2019 underwhelming secondary and restore faith in his ability to conduct a dangerous offense.\n\nBen Roethlisberger, Steelers (10): The fact that Pittsburgh could get nothing going in its opener could be explained, at least in part, by having to play on the road against a tough Patriots defense. Roethlisberger gets an easier assignment at home versus the Seahawks, but it will be hard to excel if a banged-up JuJu Smith-Schuster is limited or can\u2019t play at all.\n\n[Fantasy football start/sit Week 2: Trust Josh Allen, avoid Adrian Peterson]\n\nDak Prescott, Cowboys (11): The debut of the new-look Dallas attack was a smashing success, and Prescott can bolster hopes for a top-five season by keeping it up at Washington.\n\nAndy Dalton, Bengals (17): Speaking of transformed offenses, Cincinnati went pass-happy at Seattle last week, with notable results even in the absence of A.J. Green. If Dalton is going to wing it like that on a regular basis, he\u2019ll be a popular streamer and could contend for fringe-QB1 status.\n\n4 RB names of interest\n\nJames Conner, Steelers (8): Conner was a first-round selection in many drafts, but he didn\u2019t perform like one last week and now is dealing with an illness. He is expected to play, and his fantasy owners will be anxiously looking for reassurance that he was a worthy pick.\n\nDevin Singletary, Bills (27): It was a case of much better late than never for Singletary, who shined in Week 1 after Buffalo finally started to give him the ball. The rookie back has a chance to build on that and make his case to be considered a solid RB2 going forward.\n\n[Fantasy football Week 2 waiver wire advice: Get Hollywood Brown and Malcolm Brown]\n\nMalcolm Brown, Rams (41): Unexpectedly extensive usage, particularly near the goal line, made Brown a coveted commodity on the waiver wire. Will he continue to steal carries and touchdowns from Todd Gurley, thus making Brown a decent flex play?\n\nRex Burkhead, Patriots (44): Burkhead might be New England\u2019s version of Brown, in that he could be slated to ease the workload of a primary back with knee issues (in this case, Sony Michel). In that scenario, Burkhead may get plenty of touches in an expected rout of Miami that wouldn\u2019t seem to require much from Michel.\n\n4 WR names of interest\n\nDavante Adams, Packers (4): Given that Adams had at least 81 yards or a touchdown in every game last season, and in many cases both, his opening line of 4-36-0 was a huge disappointment. That came against the Bears\u2019 stingy defense, but the road doesn\u2019t get much easier in a home date with Xavier Rhodes and the Vikings.\n\nSammy Watkins, Chiefs (8): The top Week 1 scorer among all players, Watkins has an excellent chance against Oakland to maintain his fantasy supremacy. In other words, now may be your final chance to trade for him at anything less than top dollar, at least until Tyreek Hill nears his return.\n\n[How to replace Antonio Brown in your fantasy football lineup]\n\nTyler Lockett, Seahawks (19): With Doug Baldwin gone and seemingly little else among Seattle\u2019s receiving corps, wasn\u2019t Lockett supposed to be peppered with targets? Instead, he got just two last week, hardly befitting a locked-in WR2, so this week\u2019s game will be an important test of his role in the Seahawks\u2019 offense.\n\nDede Westbrook, Jaguars (38): The replacement of injured QB Nick Foles with rookie Gardner Minshew pushed Westbrook down the rankings a bit, but he could bounce right back if he proves to be the apple of Minshew\u2019s eye.\n\n3 TE names of interest\n\nDarren Waller, Raiders (5): Jon Gruden talked up Waller in the offseason, but then again, the garrulous coach talks up a lot of people. In this case, though, promises of feeding targets to the previously unheralded TE could well be coming to fruition.\n\nT.J. Hockenson, Lions (7): Rookie TEs rarely make big impacts right away, but this Iowa product could be an exception, if his Week 1 outing (6-131-1) is any indication.\n\nJared Cook, Saints (10): After posting a career year in Oakland and then signing with New Orleans, Cook was widely considered a top-10 choice at TE, but his inauspicious debut with the Saints (2-37-0) should have his owners worried that they might not have drafted Jimmy Graham 2.0.\n\nRead more on the NFL:\n\nLamar Jackson, Baker Mayfield and the dangers of judging quarterbacks too early\n\nBest bets for NFL Week 2: Take the Dolphins and the points against the Patriots\n\nIt\u2019s the bottom of the ninth for Raiders games on a baseball field\n\nNFL will consider placing Antonio Brown on paid leave and making him ineligible to play\n\nThe NFL wanted a celebration for its 100th season.
