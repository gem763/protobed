No one is above the law,\u201d Pelosi wrote on Twitter.\n\nIn a statement, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler called the announcement \u201camong the most brazen examples yet of the President\u2019s corruption.\u201d Nadler said the committee would continue investigating \u201cregarding these matters\u201d.\n\nMulvaney told reporters that Trump will not profit from use of the property because any charges would be \u201cat cost.\u201d He also said using Doral \u201cwas millions of dollars cheaper\u201d than other facilities and would lead to a \u201croughly 50% savings.\u201d\n\nThe Trump National Doral golf resort is shown in Doral, Florida, U.S., March 18, 2019.

But, no, there\u2019s no issue here on him profiting from this in any way, shape or form,\u201d Mulvaney said.\n\nTrump has repeatedly attacked Joe Biden, a leading Democratic presidential candidate and former vice-president, over his son\u2019s business ties in Ukraine and China, which Trump has repeatedly, and without evidence, called corrupt.\n\nAsked how the president\u2019s use of his private business properties to host official government events differed from Trump\u2019s accusations against the Bidens, Mulvaney told reporters there would be no profit and said the family had made its money before Trump became president in January 2017.\n\nTrump has said he is not involved with the day-to-day operations of his private company and his sons run the business.\n\nRepublican Senator Mitt Romney, who has been critical of Trump\u2019s Ukraine dealings but has not called for his impeachment, called the choice \u201ca very unusual site selection.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic National Committee, in a statement, said it appeared Trump was trying to resuscitate an unprofitable property that has \u201cbeen hemorrhaging money.\u201d\n\nThe news spread quickly.\n\nOn the sidelines of the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, Ghana\u2019s finance minister quipped, \u201cCould you imagine if the president of Ghana did something like that? It would not go down well.\u201d\n\nKenneth Ofori-Atta told Reuters, \u201cWe don\u2019t have a wealthy president, so that would not happen. We have a state facility in the mountains. That\u2019s where something like that would be.\u201d\n\nIn May, the Washington Post reported Doral\u2019s operating income had fallen 69 percent since 2015, citing company documents that it reviewed.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump listens during a joint news conference with Italy's President Sergio Mattarella in the East Room of the White House in Washington, U.S., October 16, 2019. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nOther Democrats said they were amazed at the announcement, and noted the irony of it being made on the same day that House Oversight Committee chairman Elijah Cummings, whose panel had been investigating whether Trump had used taxpayer funds to enrich himself, had died.\n\n\u201cAll pretense is gone,\u201d said Representative Peter Welch, a member of the oversight committee. Referring to Trump\u2019s eldest daughter, he added, \u201cHe\u2019ll probably have Ivanka there, checking them in and taking deposits.\u201d", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump will host next year's Group of Seven economic summit of leaders of developed nations at his Florida golf resort, a move Democrats and others decried as more evidence of the president misusing his office for personal gain.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441992252&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G1T8", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
