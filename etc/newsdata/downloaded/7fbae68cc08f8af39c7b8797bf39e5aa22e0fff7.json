It records traces of the explosive melting, massive earthquakes, tsunamis, landslides and wildfires as the immense asteroid blasted a hole 100 miles wide and 12 miles deep, the scientists said.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What are some questions you\u2019d like to see answered about dinosaur extinction? Join the conversation below.\n\nThe sediments also offer chemical evidence that the cataclysm blew hundreds of billions of tons of sulfur from pulverized ocean rock into the atmosphere, triggering a global winter in which temperatures world-wide dropped by as much as 30 degrees Fahrenheit for decades, the scientists said.\n\n\u201cIt tells us what went on inside the crater on that day of doom that killed the dinosaurs,\u201d said Jay Melosh, a geophysicist at Purdue University who studies impact craters and wasn\u2019t a member of the drilling team. \u201cAll of this mayhem is directly recorded in the core.\u201d\n\nThe scientists in the drilling consortium, led by geophysicist Sean Gulick at the University of Texas in Austin, who was co-chief of the $10 million project, published their research in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The project was sponsored by the International Ocean Discovery Program and the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program.\n\nFrom the platform, scientists drilled into the inner rim of the asteroid crater, buried in the seafloor of the Gulf under about 1,500 feet of limestone.

In 2016, they drilled into the crater\u2019s inner rim for the first time, buried in the seafloor under about 1,500 feet of limestone deposited in the millions of years since the impact.\n\nDrilling Into A Dinosaur-Killing Asteroid Impact Geologists discover new details of the asteroid that wiped out much of the life on Earth 65 million years ago.

In the Chicxulub crater, though, hundreds of feet of sediments built up rapidly, recording impact effects like a high-speed stop-action camera, the scientists said.\n\n\u201cHere we have 130 meters in a single day,\u201d said Dr. Gulick. \u201cWe can read it on the scale of minutes and hours, which is amazing.\u201d\n\nThe asteroid blasted a cavity between 25 and 30 miles deep in the first seconds of impact, creating a boiling cauldron of molten rocks and super-heated steam, according to the scientists\u2019 interpretation of the rock. Rebounding from the hammer blow, a plume of molten rock splashed up into a peak higher than Mount Everest.\n\nWithin minutes, it collapsed into itself, splashing gigantic waves of lava outward that solidified into a ring of high peaks, the scientists said.\n\nAbout 20 minutes or so later, sea water surged back over the newly formed peaks, covering them in a blanket of impact rocks, the scientists said. As minutes became hours, waves choked with shards of volcanic glass and splintered rock rippled back and forth, coating the peaks in a layer of impact rock called suevite, the scientists said. As the hours passed, the backwash of waves added more and more finely graded debris.\n\nAt the very top of the rock core, the scientists detected traces of organic matter and charcoal. \u201cWe think the reflected tsunami brought back these traces of land and these tiny, tiny charcoal fragments,\u201d said Dr. Gulick. \u201cThe land was clearly on fire.\u201d\n\nEarth normally speeds through a cosmic rain of debris. In 2013, a relatively small meteor about 30 meters in diameter and weighing about 13,000 metric tons exploded in the air over Russia, damaging about 7,200 buildings and injuring about 1,400 people.\n\nInspired by the discovery of the Chicxulub crater in the 1970s, astronomers and NASA now routinely map the orbits of nearby asteroids and meteor swarms for signs of potentially lethal collisions. The space agency is planning a mission in 2021 to a nearby asteroid called Didymos to test ways to safely deflect a dangerous comet or asteroid before it strikes.\n\nThere are currently no sizeable asteroids known to be on a collision course with Earth, NASA astronomers say. The dinosaur-killing asteroid, estimated to have been up to 50 miles or so across, was likely an event that occurs only once every billion years, the scientists said.\n\n\u201cImpacts are a fact of life on Earth,\u201d said Dr. Melosh. \u201cBut we know there are no big asteroids crossing Earth\u2019s orbit.\u201d\n\nWrite to Robert Lee Hotz at sciencejournal@wsj.com", "description": "Drilling into the seafloor off Mexico, scientists have extracted a unique geologic record of the day 65 million years ago when a city-sized asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs and three-quarters of all life on Earth.", "authors": ["Robert Lee Hotz", "Lee.Hotz Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104987/social", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
