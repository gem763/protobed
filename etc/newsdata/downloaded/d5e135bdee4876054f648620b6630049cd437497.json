If you shuffle and let them know you\u2019re there, they will scatter away,\" he said.\n\nIn Bolsa Chica State Beach, 124 injuries were reported on Saturday, 64 on Sunday and 42 on Monday, while the nearby Huntington State Beach witnessed around 20 each day, according to the California State Parks. The numbers were first reported in the Orange County Register.\n\nThe pain from minor stings can last 30 to 60 minutes. For more serious stings, with an open wound, people should watch for infections and seek further treatment.", "description": "More than 500 people were injured by stingrays as they tried to soak up the last bits of summer on Southern California beaches.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/california-stingray-nc-jc-190904_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
