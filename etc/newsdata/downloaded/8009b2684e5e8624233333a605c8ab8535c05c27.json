Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe state inquiry into Facebook reflects growing national unease with the size and power of Silicon Valley, amid growing fears that the country\u2019s largest tech companies act in ways that harm rivals or result in higher prices or worse services for consumers.\n\nEarlier this year, state attorneys general opened a similar bipartisan probe of Google, an investigation that centers on its advertising practices and could easily expand to cover other elements of the company\u2019s business, officials have said. In Washington, meanwhile, federal antitrust authorities have divvied up Silicon Valley for further scrutiny. The Justice Department is probing Facebook and Google while the Federal Trade Commission has started investigating Facebook and Amazon, sources have said.\n\nWith the state probe into Facebook, the concerns span the full gamut of its sprawling digital empire, including its past struggles to protect consumers\u2019 data and its prior acquisition of two competitors, Instagram and WhatsApp. Initially, New York launched its probe with seven other states and D.C.\n\n\u201cGiven Facebook\u2019s nearly unprecedented influence in so many sectors of the economy and political process, this bipartisan coalition of attorneys general is committed to ensuring that Facebook is complying with the law and meeting its obligations,\u201d said Mark Herring, the Democratic attorney general of Virginia, one of the 47 officials now participating in the probe.\n\n\u201cBy working together, state attorneys general are leading the way in ensuring digital platforms respect consumer privacy and do not engage in anticompetitive behavior,\u201d added Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich (R).", "description": "Forty-six attorneys general have joined a New York-led antitrust investigation into Facebook, the states announced Tuesday, commencing a high-stakes, sweeping bipartisan probe of the tech giant.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAIfuDN.img?h=200&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=1016&y=1745", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
