(Photo: Jeremy Bloom)\n\nJeremy Bloom has a polite family. But after a few frustratingly failed attempts in which Bloom politely asked Alexa to turn down the volume at dinner time, he shouted instead, \u201cAlexa, zip it.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo our surprise, the music immediately stopped,\u201d says the Pittsburgh-area commercial lender. \u201cWe got a huge laugh out of that. And while not the best lesson in manners for the kids, it is common for us to tell Alexa to 'zip it\u2019 now.\u201d\n\nAs we increasingly rely on anthropomorphized artificial intelligence-powered voice assistants in our homes or in our hands for weather, news, homework help and such, there's a question of whether these machines deserve the respect we (hopefully) afford fellow human beings.\n\nIn other words, should we use words such as \u201cplease\u201d and \u201csorry\u201d when we ask Amazon's Alexa, the Google Assistant or Apple\u2019s Siri to do something on our behalf \u2013 or follow up with a \"thank you\" when the devices deliver on our requests?And if we're bratty with Alexa and the others, what does that not only teach our kids but say about our own level of civility?\n\nDr. Laura Phillips, a clinical neuropsychologist at the Child Mind Institute, says the answers are \u201ccomplicated and really nuanced.\"\n\nA report last year by the U.K.-based market research firm Childwise suggested that voice recognition gadgets could be teaching children to be rude and demanding, and that \u201cthe dividing line between digital \u2018person\u2019 and a real human being might not be clear for children.\"\n\nSocial Security benefits: Social Security cost-of-living increase to raise benefits 1.6% in 2020\n\nSome parents have been struggling to find the right tone.\n\n\"This has really made me think about people versus inanimate objects versus pets versus simulated intelligence,\" says Deidr\u00e9 McLaren, mother of a 4-year-old in Johannesburg, South Africa.\n\nFor Cynthia Craigie, a stay-at-home mother of three in the central coast of California, it is all about what the kids hear.\n\n\u201cHow do you interact with your spouse? How do you interact with the cashier at the convenience store? Do you say 'please' and 'thank you,' or are you on your phone, distracted when you go through the checkout line? Those little things, I\u2019ve noticed my boys pay attention to and will copy my actions. Manners can be considered a lost art.\u201d\n\nBut another parent, Tawnya Slater, sees it differently. Watching manners with these devices is to her, in a word, \"weird.\" \u201cYou want me to say 'please' to my electronic device? Should I say 'thank you' to my trash can for accepting my trash? How about I ask the freezer to please keep my ice cream frozen,\u201d she shared in a Facebook group discussing the topic.\n\nWhat makes things more complicated is that \u201cdigital assistants have this aura of authority,\u201d says Dr. Pamela Rutledge, director of the Media Psychological Research Center in Newport Beach, California. We may know that they\u2019re not human, but to kids, \"they sound like adults, know lots of stuff and are easy to anthropomorphize.\" As conversational interfaces and AI evolves further, such distinctions may blur further.\n\n\"Kids learn through repetition, which is why we all say, 'What\u2019s the magic word?' infinitum,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cThese AI-driven, non-human entities don\u2019t care if you sound tired and crabby, or if you are purposely rude because it\u2019s 'funny.' But interactions of all kinds build patterns of communication and interaction. The more you are used to bossing Siri around or bullying her, the more you\u2019re used to that communication pattern,\" Rutledge says.\n\nSome parents have reported another problem with trying to sound friendly and considerate when talking to Alexa and Google \u2013 throwing in extra words when barking out a command may confuse these assistants.\n\nThe Echo Studio offers high-end sound for an Alexa speaker, at $199. (Photo: Jefferson Graham)\n\nDr. Phillips has another concern. The use of \"please\" and \"thank you\" might, in some sense, cheapen the meaning of such words.\n\n\"When you\u2019re talking to very young infants who don\u2019t understand it\u2019s a machine and we want them to hear kind engagement with other people, it stands to reason that we should be using manners,\u201d says Phillips. \u201cWhen kids are older and understand that Alexa isn\u2019t a person, we don\u2019t want them to use those words in an automatic way. And that we say 'thank you' and 'I\u2019m sorry' and 'please' because there\u2019s a relational piece to our communication and our words impact other people.\u201d\n\nGetting positive reinforcement\n\nAmazon determined that politeness counts when it introduced the Echo Dot Kids Edition last year. When youngsters ask Alexa to solve a math problem by exhibiting good manners \u2013 \u201cAlexa, please tell me what 5 plus 7 is\u201d \u2013 the voice inside the Echo will not only supply the right answer but will then add positive reinforcement: \u201cBy the way, thanks for asking so nicely.\u201d\n\nThis \u201cmagic word\u201d feature, as Amazon called it, was an apparent response by the company to a loud chorus of customers who were concerned that the act of rudely commanding Alexa to do something sent out the wrong kind of message, especially to the youngest members of the family.\n\nGoogle launched a similar \u201cPretty Please\u201d feature for the Google Assistant last fall after director of product management for the Assistant Lilian Rincon saw her then 4-year-old son yelling at the devices to play the ABCs and eventually his favorite Disney songs.\n\n\u201cI quickly realized that we needed a way to help promote polite behavior \u2013 not only for kids but also for all people who now welcome digital assistants to their homes,\u201d she says.\n\nIn Iowa City, senior marketing manager Dana Turner says her husband has come up with another sound reason for treating voice assistants nicely. He \u201calways says 'thank you\u2019 to her because, he says, one day AI is going to take over the world and he wants to be saved.\u201d\n\nEmail: ebaig@usatoday.com; Follow @edbaig on Twitter\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/10/10/do-ai-driven-voice-assistants-we-increasingly-rely-weather-news-homework-help-otherwise-keep-us-info/3928733002/", "description": "Should we use words like \u201cplease,\u201d \u201csorry\u201d and \u201cthank you when talking to Alexa, Siri, and the Google Assistant?", "authors": ["Edward C.
