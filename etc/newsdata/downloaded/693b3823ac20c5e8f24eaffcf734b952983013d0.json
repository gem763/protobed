Bernie Sanders (Socialist, Vt.). This week he sketched out a tax plan to ensure they won\u2019t, at least in the United States.\n\nAccording to the Sanders presidential campaign website:\n\nIt would start with a 1 percent tax on net worth above $32 million for a married couple. That means a married couple with $32.5 million would pay a wealth tax of just $5,000.\n\nThe tax rate would increase to 2 percent on net worth from $50 to $250 million, 3 percent from $250 to $500 million, 4 percent from $500 million to $1 billion, 5 percent from $1 to $2.5 billion, 6 percent from $2.5 to $5 billion, 7 percent from $5 to $10 billion, and 8 percent on wealth over $10 billion. These brackets are halved for singles.\n\nGet news and analysis on politics, policy, national security and more, delivered right to your inbox\n\nMr. Sanders often falsely claims that Scandinavia demonstrates the success of his socialist schemes, even though Scandinavian countries are home to some of the freest economies in the world. The confusion arises because many Sanders talking points haven\u2019t been updated since the 1970s, when these countries were conducting disastrous experiments in government expansion. News of several decades of reform and revival hasn\u2019t yet reached Sanders campaign headquarters.\n\nWhen it comes to wealth taxes, once again we can thank our Scandinavian friends for showing why a Sanders scheme presented as a way to plunder the rich would also make the average citizen poorer. The Scandinavian experience also suggests that if Mr. Sanders ever does manage to enact a wealth tax, he really could achieve his goal of abolishing American billionaires.\n\nSweden abolished its wealth tax in 2007. In March of that year, as the government was preparing for repeal, Karl Ritter of the Associated Press reported:\n\nThe tax, which a handful of developed countries retain, was designed to keep the rich from getting richer -- but is increasingly seen as harming primarily the not-quite-rich upper middle classes.\n\nThe move, expected to be approved by Parliament later this year, underscores the country\u2019s efforts to keep successful Swedes and their capital at home by reforming its fabled but costly welfare state.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not sustainable to keep taxes that radically diverge from other countries,\u201d Finance Minister Anders Borg told the A.P. \u201cNot if you want the money to stay in the country.\u201d\n\nThe A.P. further noted the impact of one of the world\u2019s heaviest tax burdens:\n\nNot surprisingly, the wealthiest Swedes have fled the country, including IKEA founder Ingvar Kamprad, No. 4 on Forbes magazine\u2019s list of the world\u2019s richest people. He lives in Switzerland.\n\nFive-time Wimbledon winner Bjorn Borg moved to tax-haven Monaco in the late 1970s... The government says more than 500 billion kronor ($70 billion) of Swedish capital is outside of the country\u2019s borders.\n\n\u201cThis is money that if it was brought home could be invested to create jobs and welfare in Sweden,\u201d the four coalition leaders said in a joint statement this week.\n\nDenmark had already abolished its wealth tax years earlier. Nordic neighbor Finland axed its wealth tax shortly before Sweden. And while Norway still taxes wealth, it has been reducing the burden in recent years while also cutting rates on corporate income.\n\nBack here in the U.S., Vermont\u2019s most famous Marxist aims to stem the ocean of money flowing out of the U.S. in the event he succeeds. As part of his plunder plan, Sen. Sanders is promising exit taxes at rates up to 60% of wealth to discourage billionaires from fleeing the U.S. and taking up residence in capitalist countries.\n\nThis might allow Mr. Sanders to hold many existing billionaires captive for a time. But his plan surely provides enough incentive for the next generation of entrepreneurs to find other locales to build their fortunes.\n\nThank goodness there\u2019s a giant asterisk on the Sanders plan to achieve his dream of a country without billionaires. The Sanders plan is not constitutional, for the same reason that Elizabeth Warren\u2019s wealth tax is unconstitutional. The founders banned such direct taxes and the 16th Amendment only authorized the taxation of incomes, not balance sheets.\n\nTeam Sanders seems to know this because to make its case the campaign is appealing to the authority of law professors\u2014but ones that are making political rather than legal arguments. Attorney Mark Berg of Feingold & Alpert writes via email:\n\nFor example, Senator Sanders\u2019 announcement cites a 2011 newspaper article by Bruce Ackerman and Anne Alstott of Yale that concludes that because the Direct Tax Clauses of the Constitution were a part of the infamous compromise between the northern and southern states that treated slaves as 3/5 of a person for purposes of apportioning House seats and direct taxes, \u201cit is extremely unlikely that the justices will cite the founders\u2019 original compromise with slavery to bar a tax that would serve the cause of economic equality and democratic legitimacy. The Roberts court may be conservative, but it is not quite as reactionary as all that.\u201d\n\nAmong the legal points that this argument ignores are that while the Constitution was amended to abolish slavery and to eliminate the odious 3/5 provision, the provisions requiring House seats and direct taxes to be apportioned among the states by population were left intact... Thus, a federal direct tax that is not an income tax and is not apportioned among the states is unconstitutional no matter how much the tax would \u201cserve the cause of economic equality and democratic legitimacy.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the moderators at October\u2019s Democratic presidential debate will ask Mr. Sanders to comment on his unconstitutional wealth grab\u2014not to mention the success of Scandinavian tax reform.\n\n***\n\nWhile the socialist Sen. Sanders was promoting his latest scheme to boost government revenue this week, the current occupant of the White House was expressing a more hopeful message at a multilateral meeting of leaders from North and South America in New York. According to a White House transcript, President Donald Trump said:\n\nThis is a critical moment for the world. We must not allow the destructive forces of socialism and communism to repeat the horrors of the last century. Can\u2019t allow it to happen. There have been horrors like nobody would believe. We can\u2019t allow this to happen today in Venezuela. We resolve that the future of the Western Hemisphere will not be written by socialists and tyrants, but by liberty-loving patriots. Our great destiny is to become the first fully free hemisphere in human history. We have a very, very good chance of doing that.\n\nWe work and we pray for the hour when every person across the region, and every suffering soul in Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, will finally know the blessings of democracy and the full glory of freedom.\n\n***\n\nMr. Freeman is the co-author of \u201cBorrowed Time,\u201d now available from HarperBusiness.", "description": "The Sanders plan to abolish American billionaires.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAHTncM.img?h=200&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=576&y=385"}
