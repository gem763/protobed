Her outfit was complemented with a rich red lip.\n\nMiley's post could have also been celebrating the album's six-year release anniversary in addition to her free-spirited ways.\n\nThe day before she marked the album's birthday with another post captioned: 'Bangerz is 6 years old . Wasn\u2019t even 21 when I dropped this record ! Couldn\u2019t drink but fuckkkkk I partied!'\n\nCyrus recently slammed 'slut-shamers' in a lengthy, passionate statement after receiving backlash following her recent kiss with singer Cody Simpson.

Miley's been seen smooching Aussie singer Cody Simpson\n\nThe lengthy note read: 'I know the public feels invested in my past relationship [with ex Liam] because they felt like they saw it thru from the beginning,' the star began her longer confessional.\n\n'I think that's why people have always felt so entitled over my life and how I live it because they've watched me grow up.'\n\n'But I am grown now,' Miley continued, 'and make choices as an adult knowing the truth/details/reality.' People only \"know\" what they see on the internet.' [sic]\n\nMiley also addressed the inequity of how famous women are portrayed in their pursuit of love and intimacy, as compared to famous men.\n\nShe explained: 'Men (especially successful ones) are RARELY slut shamed. They move on from one beautiful woman to the next MOST times without consequence. They are referred to as \"legends\", \"heart throbs\" where women are called sluts/whores! I am trying to just THRIVE/survive in a \"mans\" world.'\n\n'If we can't beat em, join em!' Miley concluded the section. 'If our president can \"grab em by the p***y...\" can't I just have a kiss and acai bowl?!?!'\n\nAfter specifically responding to being recently spotted kissing Cody, she addressed their budding relationship in a separate story.\n\n'I refuse to recluse and \"date\" from home cause A. That's not fun B. Extremely uncomfortable/puts me in a vulnerable position,' the Slide Away performer expressed.\n\n'I would like to share an activity with someone I am dating and not be stuck at home with pretty much nothing to do but \"Netflix and chill\".\n\n'This \"dating\" thing is new to me too. I've never been an \"adult\"/grown a** woman experiencing this... I was in a committed relationship for almost All my teens and early 20s; with the exception of a few breaks, which usually in those times I was working my a** off with not much R&R... and \"meeting/trusting\" people in my position is really tuff.'\n\n'Don't f***ing pity me, not what I'm asking for,' Miley concluded. 'I have a great life I wouldn't trade for \"privacy\" but PLEASE don't make this awkward for me! I am trying to make light and like always MAKE FUN of myself/and the public's perception of me! Get used to me dating \u2013 this is where I am at!'", "description": "Miley Cyrus made a point of calling out slut-shamers who criticized her for hooking up with Cody Simpson, shortly after her breakup with Kaitlynn Carter and her divorce from Liam Hemsworth.", "authors": ["Dailymail.Com Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/15/19363678-0-image-a-7_1570373938477.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
