According to the text, the signers \"hold a range of political views.\" The two alumni who began circulating the letter this week, Joshua Davis, an employment lawyer based in Boston, and Jeremy Feigelson, a cybersecurity and data privacy litigation lawyer based in New York, have both donated to Democratic campaigns. A review of public databases reveal at least three of the alumni who signed are Republican donors and others have not donated to either political party.\n\nThe House of Representatives, led by Democrats, has launched an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump after a whistle-blower complaint revealed a phone call he had in July with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in which Trump appeared to be asking for dirt on one of his political opponents, Joe Biden.\n\nAs part of the inquiry, House committees have asked for internal documents from the White House.\n\nOn Tuesday, Cipollone sent an 8-page letter to Congressional Democrats, stating that Trump \"cannot permit his administration to participate in this partisan inquiry under these circumstances.\" Cipollone's letter came hours after the White House blocked the testimony of Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union.\n\nThe University of Chicago Law School alumni said, \"When any president openly invites the help of foreign powers for partisan political purposes, Congress in the exercise of its constitutional powers should conduct an inquiry and the White House should cooperate. Fair-minded lawyers can easily agree on this regardless of their politics. Your letter instead distorts the law and the Constitution for other purposes, including cable news consumption.\"", "description": "University of Chicago Law School classmates signed a letter to White House Counsel Pat Cipollone criticizing him for blocking impeachment witnesses.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/4223332/1000x563_nbc-191010-pat-cipollone-ac-605p_3c305da69bf1b06c7e9c64fb9b1aa978.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
