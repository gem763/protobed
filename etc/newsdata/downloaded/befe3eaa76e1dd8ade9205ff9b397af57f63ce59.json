Those changes include barring clinics that perform or even refer patients for abortions from receiving federal family planning dollars unless they jump through a near-impossible series of hoops.\n\nThe two Planned Parenthood clinics that are closing, which had received sporadic Title X funding over the years, were already in a precarious financial position. That\u2019s because this is hardly the first time that politicians have waged war on Planned Parenthood or on reproductive health care in general. When he was Ohio\u2019s governor, John Kasich was especially fervent in that mission, signing more than a dozen bills targeting women\u2019s health care. Among them was a major rollback of public financing for Planned Parenthood clinics in the state. By 2018, Ohio ranked 48th in the nation for publicly funded women\u2019s health services. Mike DeWine, the state\u2019s new Republican governor, has picked up where his predecessor left off, signing a bill this year that would ban abortions at as early as six weeks of pregnancy.", "description": "Clinics providing essential services to women are struggling \u2014\u00a0and closing their doors \u2014 after years of political attacks.", "authors": ["The Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/09/opinion/09_clinics_illo/09_clinics_illo-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
