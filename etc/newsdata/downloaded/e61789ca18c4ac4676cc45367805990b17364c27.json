The prime minister had previously said that he would rather \"be dead in a ditch\" then delay Brexit.\n\nJohnson avoided another defeat in the courts after the UK's Supreme Court last month ruled that the prime minister had acted illegally when he suspended Parliament for five weeks in the run-up to the October Brexit deadline.", "description": "Campaigners had asked Scottish judges to force Johnson to ask the EU for a fresh Brexit delay.", "authors": ["Adam Payne"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9740680977cd0a3c3feff8?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
