The governing body has now placed a detailed support network around a \u201cdevastated\u201d Howley following his return to Wales on Tuesday.\n\nSpeaking from Wales\u2019sWorld Cup base in Kitakyushu on Wednesday morning, WRU chief executive Martyn Phillips said: \u201cWe were contacted informally on Wednesday of last week to suggest there was a potential breach of regulation six. It came from one of the betting company\u2019s integrity teams.\n\n\u201cWe were then contacted formally with further information on Friday evening and at that point we informed World Rugby there was a potential breach and we would be seeking face-to-face time with Rob. We reached the decision on Saturday that we were best-placed to come out to Japan. That triggered the formal process we\u2019re now in and it will carry on back in Wales. He\u2019s our employee and we have a duty of care to him. I can assure you that has been a major factor we\u2019ve considered over the last few days.\n\n\u201cRob is back in Wales and we have put the necessary support around him. We\u2019re checking in on his wellbeing as we formalise our processes to get through the investigation.\u201d\n\nWales flew to Japan last Wednesday, but the WRU insists it didn\u2019t know of Howley\u2019s alleged breach before the team\u2019s departure which came in the early hours of the morning. Howley was on the plane from Heathrow.\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\nWales\u2019s entire 31-man World Cup squad learned of Howley\u2019s departure on Tuesday night, but Gatland\u2019s senior leadership group \u2013 which includes captain Alun Wyn Jones, Ken Owens, Jonathan Davies, Justin Tipuric, Cory Hill and Dan Biggar \u2013 were informed 24 hours earlier before Wales\u2019s official welcome and capping ceremony in Kitakyushu. Howley did not attend that ceremony.\n\nThe investigation into Howley will be led by the WRU, but Phillips admitted an independent judicial panel is likely to be involved. \u201cThere will be an investigation and that\u2019s confirmed. I\u2019d be far more interested in quality not speed,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t put any pressure on anyone to do things quickly. I will be putting pressure on them to do it right.\u201d\n\nRugby players and staff at all levels are banned from betting on any match and Phillips insisted Wales\u2019 set-up is well aware of the rules. But he said he was not \u201cembarrassed\u201d by Howley\u2019s World Cup departure.\n\nIt is understood the mood in the Wales team room was sombre on Wednesday morning. Gatland\u2019s players attempted to lighten the mood with some drills inside their spacious Kitakyushu hotel before undergoing afternoon and evening training sessions.\n\nRob Howley: a successful player and coach who struggled to win hearts Read more\n\nGatland \u2013 who has worked with Howley in Wales since 2008 \u2013 had to deal with the departure of his most trusted lieutenant on his 56th birthday. The New Zealander said: \u201cI have had better birthdays for sure. We were shocked. The union are dealing with this and my focus has to be on the next five days in terms of preparing the squad for the first World Cup game against Georgia.\n\n\u201cYou have to deal with adversity at times and it\u2019s how you respond to that. I must say the players have really stepped up in the last 24 hours. They have been incredibly responsible and resilient. \u201cSometimes that brings teams closer together. We have got to draw a line in the sand on this and really focus on preparing the team for the next five days. We got a shock the other day and it took a bit of time for this to sink in.\n\n\u201cThere was concern from the coaches and the players about Rob\u2019s welfare. We have to let the formal process take its course and hopefully that can continue outside our preparation.\u201d\n\nFormer Wales fly-half Stephen Jones is on his way to Japan to replace Howley. Jones was set to succeed Howley as Wales attack coach after the World Cup, but he has been pressed into action sooner than expected and will meet up with Wales in Toyota on Thursday. Wales face Georgia there on Monday.", "description": "The Welsh Rugby Union has revealed it was first made aware of Rob Howley\u2019s suspected breach of World Rugby\u2019s betting regulations a week ago", "authors": ["Alex Bywater"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d18368bc765ef777f383e6a70829f72e185190ca/0_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=03d035011649962aee7c4199e4e7221f", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
