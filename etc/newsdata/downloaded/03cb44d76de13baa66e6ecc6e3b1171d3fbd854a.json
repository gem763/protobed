On Monday, the Trump-defending correspondent cast the president as a victim in a den of treachery.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s never been a presidency where the incumbent has been surrounded \u2015 I don\u2019t say it playfully \u2015 by backstabbers and vipers and rats and snitches,\u201d Rivera told Martha MacCallum on Fox News\u2019 \u201cThe Story.\u201d (See the clip above.)\n\nRivera, who has called Trump a friend, repeated the Trump talking point that Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky said he didn\u2019t feel pressured in a phone call with the president to investigate Joe Biden, as Trump repeatedly asked. The phone conversation, flagged by a whistleblower complaint, prompted the House to launch an impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cSo, how do you have an impeachment inquiry when the star prosecution witness counters your narrative?\u201d Rivera asked.\n\nRivera said the inquiry was \u201cthrowing subpoenas at everyone they can think of.\u201d\n\nWatch the interview above.\n\n#UkrainePresidentZelensky says he was not pressured by @realDonaldTrump into investigating @JoeBiden & son #HunterBiden. If the purported victim says No Harm No Foul, How can House ignore testimony from the star prosecution witness? \u2014 Geraldo Rivera (@GeraldoRivera) October 7, 2019\n\nRelated...\n\nSean Hannity, Geraldo Rivera Cross A Line In Yelling Border Fight\n\nGeraldo Rivera Launches Tone-Deaf Defense Of \u2018My Friend\u2019 Trump After Racist Rant\n\nGeraldo Rivera Can't Make 'Fox & Friends' Hosts See That Trump Tweets Are Racist\n\nLove HuffPost?
