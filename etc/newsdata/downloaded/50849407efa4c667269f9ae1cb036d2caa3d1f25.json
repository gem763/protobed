Johnson\u2019s last two bids for an early election were rejected. And he may not have the numbers on Monday, either.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSome opposition lawmakers accused him of trying to divert attention from his broken pledge to deliver Brexit by Oct. 31. Others said they needed a guarantee that Britain will not exit the European Union without a deal to manage the transition.\n\n\u201cTake no-deal off the table and we absolutely support an election,\u201d Corbyn told the BBC. \u201cI want us not to crash out of the E.U. because of all the damage it will do to jobs all across this country.\u201d\n\nHe declined to say what sort of evidence he would need to be satisfied that Britain would not leave abruptly without a deal.\n\nAsked Thursday what he would do if Labour refused to back an election, Johnson replied, \u201cWe would campaign day after day for the people of this country to be released from subjection to a Parliament that has outlived its usefulness.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn his letter to Corbyn, Johnson wrote, \u201cAn election on 12 December will allow a new parliament and government to be in place by Christmas. If I win a majority in this election, we will then ratify the great new deal that I have negotiated, get Brexit done in January and the country will move on.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe last time a general election took place in December was in the 1920s. The Labour Party is said to favor fair-weather balloting.\n\nSpeaking with the BBC, Johnson said that if lawmakers \u201cgenuinely want more time to study this excellent deal, they can have it \u2014 but they have to agree to a general election on December the 12th.\u201d\n\nThat was a threat but also a call to let voters settle the matter.\n\nAD\n\nIt would be an understatement to say that Johnson has been frustrated in his effort to extract Britain from the E.U.\n\nHe said last month that he\u2019d \u201crather be dead in a ditch\u201d than ask the E.U. for a delay in the Brexit process. And yet, because he missed a mid-October deadline to get his withdrawal deal approved by Parliament, the prime minister was forced to send a letter to European leaders requesting an extension until the end of January.\n\nAD\n\nThis week, British lawmakers voted to support moving Johnson\u2019s Brexit legislation forward in the approval process, but they then rejected his fast-track, three-day timetable, saying they need more time to scrutinize the 115-page bill.\n\nAD\n\nScottish leader and Brexit foe Nicola Sturgeon tweeted Thursday, \u201cSo Johnson appears to be saying to MPs \u2018if you vote for an election, I\u2019ll bring back my bad Brexit bill and try to drag us out of the E.U. before we go to the polls\u2019. Elections should be exercises in letting voters decide, not devices for charlatans to get their own way.\u201d\n\nE.U. leaders are still mulling Britain\u2019s extension request. They are expected to offer a reprieve of some sort. That could be an extension of several weeks, as Johnson would prefer, or the full three months that Parliament forced him to seek. They could also offer a two-tier \u201cflextension,\u201d as they did for a previous Brexit deadline.\n\nAD\n\nIf Johnson loses his election motion on Monday, he could also, bizarrely, call a vote of no confidence in his own government, or he could try to pass a new one-line act of legislation that would need only a simple majority. But that could be amended by Parliament into something Johnson would not want.\n\nAD", "description": "It is both a threat and a serious call to allow voters to settle the matter.", "authors": ["William Booth", "London Bureau Chief", "Karla Adam", "London Correspondent Covering The United Kingdom"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/LsYs2GgrC4ljFEBCsZGYAOiznR0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KJ2CV2HWQUI6TLMLQXRKUAFVZY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
