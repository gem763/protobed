It applies to cases in which the children later end up with a citizen parent \u2014 possibly through the children\u2019s adoption or naturalization of the parents.\n\nThose children used to be deemed citizens through one part of immigration law. Now they\u2019ll have to certify citizenship through another part of the law, which officials said requires different paperwork \u2014 though they insisted nobody is being stripped of rights.\n\n\u201cThis update does not affect birthright citizenship to the military or to anyone else,\u201d an official at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services told reporters Thursday, a day after the guidance caused a stir.\n\nNews reports on Wednesday suggested the change was much broader, denying automatic citizenship to children born to U.S. troops stationed abroad.\n\nThat\u2019s just not true, the USCIS official said.\n\n\u201cA former Marine myself, I know the sacrifices our military service members endure,\u201d said the official, whom the agency insisted not be named as he briefed reporters on the changes. \u201cThe idea this policy negatively impacts or takes anything away from them is incorrect.\u201d\n\nAnother USCIS official chided those who got it wrong.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to distort what\u2019s actually happening here, which I think has happened in the last day or so,\u201d he said.\n\nThe officials acknowledged the 11-page policy was complicated, and USCIS was slow to explain the intricacies of the change, leaving a media industry already skeptical of the Trump administration\u2019s motives to overstate what was happening.\n\nOne reporter tweeted out a key quote from the USCIS announcement but cut it off before the critical portion where the agency detailed the alternate route available to obtain citizenship for the couple dozen children a year who might be affected.\n\nThat reporter\u2019s tweet ignited a fury of follow-ups from other reporters who also misconstrued matters.\n\nMany of them later clarified or deleted their tweets, and story headlines were changed \u2014 but the misinterpretation had already traveled halfway around the globe while the accurate information was still putting on its shoes.\n\nThe hashtag #TRUMPHATESMILITARYFAMILIES trended on some websites and on Reddit.com, which bills itself at the front page of the internet, speculation on the administration\u2019s decision-making ran wild after someone posted a Military.com story headlined \u201cChildren of U.S. troops born overseas will no longer get automatic American citizenship.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope Trump voters are happy. As a service member this is APPALLING,\u201d wrote one poster.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand what his purpose is here, or who he\u2019s trying to appeal to,\u201d another wrote.\n\nThe USCIS officials said they had no choice.\n\nThey said the State Department has long held the other interpretation of which section of law must be used \u2014 and it was refusing to issue passports in those cases.\n\nUSCIS said also it concluded the State Department\u2019s interpretation was more correct, so the agency had to switch.\n\nOne of the USCIS officials who briefed reporters said he would have preferred to keep their version, but that wouldn\u2019t withstand scrutiny.\n\n\u201cIf I could change the law to our interpretation I would happily do so. The fact of the matter is it\u2019s just not what the statute says,\u201d he said.\n\nThe changes could apply in a few cases, such as when a child is born to non-citizen parents overseas, then adopted by U.S. citizen government employees. Another case could involve parents who are legal permanent residents working for the U.S. government at the time of a child\u2019s birth, but they naturalize after the child was born or they had naturalized beforehand but hadn\u2019t accrued enough residency.\n\nOfficials could not say how many of the 20-25 cases a year that may fall under the new guidelines applied to each case.\n\nReporters who changed their stories to correct their misinterpretations seemed to blame the government agency for their confusion, saying the administration needed to clarify its guidance after the erroneous news reports came out.\n\n\u201cThe firestorm was created by the confusion you all created,\u201d CNN anchor Dana Bash told USCIS acting chief Ken Cuccinelli as she interviewed him Thursday.\n\nMr. Cuccinelli acknowledged the situation is complicated, but said that\u2019s the nature of immigration law in this area, and the confusion was born out of reporting, not the policy.\n\n\u201cCongress set these rules, we didn\u2019t set the rules. We\u2019ve been breaking the rules to make it easier for people, and then they couldn\u2019t get their passport,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
