She was just a grand home waiting for some TLC again.\u201d\n\nWith two kids, a greyhound and a Jack Russell along for the ride, she and husband Brendon Smith got to work on plans to transform the property which was surrounded by million-dollar homes, creating a whole new design for the site, raising the home to legal height with council approval, expanding and upgrading everything.\n\n\u201cMy husband was building for a client across the road and saw its potential to restore it to its former glory. With so much history and character we knew it would make an amazing family home with incredible character, and we were ready for a new family home for ourselves and our boys as we had been living in an older Queenslander for a few years,\u201d Mrs Smith said.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have any real concerns as we knew we wanted to retain the original home and restore it to its former glory, which would help retain the beautiful street facade. We felt the home deserved to be there as it stood when it was first built. It had a lot to give back to the street.\u201d\n\nHer first tip for anyone wanting to take on such a project she joked was \u201cmarry a builder\u201d.\n\n\u201cFinding a great architect is imperative. Be patient. Surround yourself with an amazing team of people. Stay true to your ideas. Be ready for lots of hard work. Make sure everyone is on the same page with your level of expectation to finishes.\u201d\n\nShe said the property was \u201ca home again\u201d.\n\n\u201cI still shake my head sometimes when I see something from a different perspective. It\u2019s a gorgeous home to make lasting memories in. We feel it\u2019s the essence of Queensland living. Open roomy areas, just fantastic for family lifestyle.\u201d\n\nHer favourite part was the outdoor area that they carefully designed.\n\n\u201cThe seamlessness between the kitchen, dining, living and the outdoor area makes it all one huge welcoming space.\u201d\n\nAfter all their hard work, the family decided to sell in preparation for a move to the Sunshine Coast. \u201cWe thought it might be a good time to do it.\u201d\n\nAsked if she\u2019d take on such a project again, Mrs Smith said \u201cnever say never\u201d.\n\nReal estate agents Paula Pearce and Mikaela Crone of Place Bulimba described the home as an \u201carchitectural masterpiece\u201d \u2014 embracing indoor-outdoor flow, natural lighting, wide open spaces and double height ceilings.\n\nLush elements were added like mixed spotted gum and Italian tile flooring, loads of timber and ways to make the most of tropical greenery.\n\nThere are five large bedrooms, including a master retreat that has a wraparound walk-in robe, and even a second living area designed to create a private wing for the children for movie nights.\n\nThe property has been set to go to auction on Wednesday November 6 at 5.30pm.\n\nFOLLOW SOPHIE FOSTER ON TWITTER\n\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n116 Barton Road, Hawthorne, Qld 4171\n\n5 bed 4 bath 4 carparks\n\n820sq m block\n\nAuction Wed Nov 6 at 5.30pm\n\nC BUS home automation system\n\nScullery\n\nNew Guinea Rosewood Aneeta Windows\n\nSolar panels\n\nDucted airconditioning\n\nSecurity cameras with alarm and electric front gate\n\nFour car lockable garage with built-in storage\n\nFully-integrated study with hidden wiring\n\nFull irrigation system\n\nDouble glazed Bluish Breeze sky lighting\n\nBora Professional Range including Teppanyaki", "description": "It was called the \u2018avocado\u2019 house for good reason, but now it\u2019s blossomed into anarchitectural masterpiece that\u2019s as different to its previous self as chalk and cheese.", "authors": ["Sophie Foster"], "top_image": "https://www.realestate.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/22010146/capi_7c53b8deff407025ab583f8e371b363e_08bfb29b6680984502b1e9fd028a85cd.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
