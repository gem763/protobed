We need to accept that different conceptions of democracy sometimes contradict one another, and that some of our governing structures are the antithesis of democratic rule.\n\nThe implosion in Britain has created what usually sober and moderate analysts have taken to calling a \u201crevolutionary moment.\u201d Prime Minister Boris Johnson took office this summer committed to getting his country out of the European Union by Oct. 31, even if he failed to make a deal with Britain\u2019s former E.U. partners to minimize disruption.\n\nHe insists that all he is doing is living up to what 52 percent of British voters supported in the 2016 referendum by casting their ballots in favor of leaving the E.U. Opponents of \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit argue that the majority for \u201cleave\u201d was not a majority for the chaos that crashing out of the E.U. could leave in its wake.\n\nJohnson \u2014 made prime minister by the 92,000 members of his Conservative Party in a country of well over 45 million eligible voters \u2014 knew he lacked a majority in Parliament for a no-deal Brexit. So he tried to get around Parliament by \u201cproroguing\u201d it. After a brief sitting this week, under Johnson\u2019s ukase, Parliament was not scheduled to meet again until Oct. 14, leaving him with a lot of unaccountable power.\n\nBut Parliament wouldn\u2019t have it. A 328-to-301 vote on Tuesday, in which 21 members of Johnson\u2019s own Conservative Party bolted to the opposition, gave Parliament control of the process \u2014 and the 21 dissenters were thrown out of the Conservative Party. On Wednesday, the House of Commons passed a bill to block a no-deal Brexit.\n\nNote how many times I have used the word \u201cmajority\u201d and how everyone in this debate claims the \u201creal\u201d majority is on their side. There is also a tension between the majority in the Parliament elected by the people and the majority verdict the people rendered in the referendum.\n\nPolls make a good case that many who voted for Brexit did not expect it to be this difficult \u2014 Brexit supporters such as Johnson suggested it would be a piece of cake \u2014 and that no-deal Brexit is not popular. Writing on the BBC\u2019s website, the respected British political scientist Sir John Curtice calculated that an average of the polls shows 44 percent opposing no-deal Brexit, with only 38 percent favoring it. Of the rest, 11 percent said \u201cneither,\u201d and 10 percent didn\u2019t know. There is no majority here \u2014 and very little support for crashing out.\n\nPersonally, I am on the side of those in Britain who want a second referendum now that everyone knows just how messy this process is. A 21-year-old anti-Johnson demonstrator shrewdly echoed words once used by a Brexit advocate. \u201cIf a democracy cannot change its mind,\u201d Caitlin O\u2019Hara told the New York Times, \u201cit ceases to be a democracy.\u201d Referendums, in principle the most democratic way of solving problems, can be highly imperfect instruments in gauging the public\u2019s will, especially when the views of a significant number of those making a binary choice are complicated or contingent.\n\nWhen it comes to gun control in the United States, the democratic failure is more straightforward. In blocking a vote on a House-passed bill requiring universal background checks, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is clearly foiling the will of an overwhelming majority of Americans. A July NPR-PBS NewsHour-Marist poll found that 89 percent support background checks, including 84 percent of Republicans.\n\nIt\u2019s not just that the Senate is a wildly undemocratic institution \u2014 41 senators representing about one-fifth of the country\u2019s population can block action through the filibuster. It\u2019s also that organizations with extreme views on guns hold outsize sway over the GOP. As a Post editorial spotlighted this week, it seems that no number of casualties from mass shootings will ever be enough to move McConnell off \u201chis insistent inertia.\u201d\n\nSo friends of liberal democracy need to revisit the classic questions about what direct role voters should play, how referendums should be structured and what decisions are best made by representative bodies.\n\nAnd in the United States, we need to confront how radically undemocratic the Senate has become. Perhaps the mass-shooting crisis will force us to acknowledge that what fancies itself as the world\u2019s greatest deliberative body is now one of the free world\u2019s least representative institutions.\n\nRead more from E.J.
