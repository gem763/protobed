National estimates suggest that more than 4 million children in the United States have been diagnosed with anxiety, and nearly 2 million have been diagnosed with depression. Experts have argued that we\u2019re in the midst of an epidemic of children\u2019s mental health, and while awareness has certainly increased, only about 20 percent of kids with a diagnosable mental health disorder are actually getting the help they need.\n\nIt\u2019s frightening stuff to grapple with as a parent. Yet mental health experts resoundingly agree that there is reason to have hope: Treatment, including therapy and medication, can make a profound difference in children\u2019s lives.\n\nThe challenge is identifying whether your child would benefit from outside help, and then knowing how to go about getting it. Fortunately, experts say there are some common signs and behaviors to look out for, as well as simple best practices for connecting with treatment. Here are a few that all parents should be aware of.\n\nFirst, a reminder: Some degree of acting out is normal\n\nSure, childhood can be great. But it can also be really, really hard. Kids are learning how to make their way in the world, coming up against obstacles and changing every day.\n\n\u201cAll kids have emotions,\u201d said Alexandra Hamlet, Psy.D., a clinical psychologist with the Mood Disorder Center at the Child Mind Institute. \u201cEmotions aren\u2019t bad, and kids will go through struggles. They\u2019ll feel emotions and have to work through them, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they need therapy.\u201d\n\nParents should feel reassured that meltdowns, outbursts and even just bad days aren\u2019t just typical; they\u2019re developmentally expected, especially in young children. Sometimes they can be a sign of underlying problems, but they are also kind of a rite of passage for most kids.\n\nWhat you want to pay attention to is the frequency, duration, severity and age appropriateness of behaviors\n\n\u201cNearly all young children have temper tantrums at some point,\u201d reiterated Steven Meyers, Ph.D., a professor of psychology at Roosevelt University and a Chicago-based clinical psychologist. But if you\u2019re concerned, tune into how long your child\u2019s outbursts last, how severe they tend to be and whether they\u2019re having them past an age that you suspect is developmentally appropriate.\n\nThe job of mental health professionals is to take parents\u2019 feedback and to use the clinical assessment tools available to them, like rating scales, to suss out whether a child\u2019s behavior is indeed outside the norm.\n\nIf your child has reached a point where any behavioral issues (from mood changes to outbursts or problems concentrating) are keeping them from getting through their days, or they\u2019re interfering with your ability to do what you need to do, that\u2019s a red flag. For example, some avoidance before school is common. But if your child is having daily, extended meltdowns that make you late for work, that\u2019s a potential sign something more serious is happening.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really when the emotions start to become unmanageable, and they impact the performance of the child or functionally impair them, that\u2019s when we think, \u2018OK, let\u2019s take a look at this in a deeper, closer way,\u2019\u201d Hamlet advised.\n\nTake notes and compare them with friends\n\nAlthough the parenting world is often rife with unhelpful competition and judgment, both Meyers and Hamlet believe that reaching out to friends or family members with kids of a similar age is an effective way to get an initial sense of whether your child is really struggling. All kids are wildly different, so it\u2019s not about comparing. Instead, it\u2019s about using your existing network to help establish some guideposts.\n\nIt\u2019s also really helpful to jot down notes about changes or patterns you see emerging, so that if you do go ahead and talk to your child\u2019s pediatrician, for example, you\u2019re able to provide concrete examples of what you\u2019re talking about, rather than simply walking them through the most recent moment or behavior you can remember.\n\nAnxiety and depression don\u2019t necessarily look the same in young kids\n\n\u201cPsychological disorders come in two general types,\u201d explained Meyers, who emphasized he was speaking in broad brushstrokes. \u201cThe first type are acting out disorders, like ADHD or oppositional children. Those symptoms are typically easy to spot, because they\u2019re visible and they\u2019re impacting the lives of other people.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe second set are what are called internalizing disorders,\u201d Meyers continued, \u201cand they include anxiety and depression, which can be harder to spot because those symptoms are mostly disrupted thoughts and feelings rather than disrupted behaviors.\u201d\n\nThough this is by no means exhaustive, some unexpected signs of anxiety in children include trouble focusing, avoidance and outbursts \u2015 perhaps not what parents typically think of as hallmarks of anxious behavior. \u201cIt\u2019s just their body\u2019s way of reacting to their worries,\u201d Hamlet said.\n\nLikewise, signs of depression vary so wildly it\u2019s hard to single out just a few, but parents should pay attention to things like irritability, outbursts and changes in how children sleep and eat. Don\u2019t necessarily expect depression to manifest itself in really obvious sadness.\n\nPhysical cues can be important too, particularly in children who may not have the verbal abilities to express what they\u2019re feeling. \u201cWhat parents might see more of is their child complaining of headaches or tummy aches, because they don\u2019t have the words to describe it, and their body might be somatizing it,\u201d Hamlet explained.\n\nAnd never ignore anything that seems urgent, like if your child stops eating, is causing him or herself physical harm, or expresses suicidal thoughts or behaviors. That is an emergency, and you need to get help right away.\n\nBe mindful of your family history\n\nWhile mental health issues are the result of a complex mix of genetics and environmental factors, it\u2019s a good idea to be aware of your family history, Hamlet said.\n\n\u201cIf you have a family history, that\u2019s something to consider,\u201d she said, as mental health disorders can absolutely run in families. Genes are by no means destiny, but it\u2019s just another thing to keep in mind.\n\nKnow that it\u2019s always OK to ask questions\n\nIf you have concerns about your child\u2019s mental health, you should absolutely feel empowered to take them to an expert to start a conversation. It\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t know how to find a pediatric mental health specialist off the top of your head; your child\u2019s pediatrician can be an excellent place to start. Teachers can also be good touch points, Meyers said.\n\nReaching out for a bit more information does not necessarily mean your child is embarking on long-term mental health treatment, though there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with that if they do. Unfortunately, sometimes the stigma that still shrouds mental health issues can prevent parents from reaching out.\n\n\u201cIt can be hard for a parent,\u201d Hamlet said. \u201cSometimes they catastrophize. Sometimes they think, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t want them to have a label. I don\u2019t want them to feel like there is something wrong with them.\u2019\u201d Again, though, seeking out an outside opinion does not mean that your child will necessarily begin treatment; it\u2019s just a way of being careful and informed.\n\nAsk your kids about how they\u2019re feeling, then listen\n\nEven with really young kids, it is important to regularly initiate conversations about their emotional lives. Some children are more communicative than others, Meyers said, but if you establish a habit of talking to them about their thoughts and feelings, they might be more likely to come to you when they are struggling in some way. And then you\u2019re in a better position to connect them with outside help as needed.\n\nThe key is to listen and not immediately rush into what Meyers called \u201cintervention mode.\u201d You don\u2019t have to have all the answers, and you cannot solve every problem.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to stay focused in a listening mode when children are describing painful events, we just want to make them feel better,\u201d he said. \u201cBut sometimes we rush to do so.\u201d\n\n\u201cListen. Ask questions to elicit details,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cInquire about what the child\u2019s feelings are, and communicate understanding and compassion, rather than moving to try and solve the problem.\u201d\n\nIf you or someone you know needs help, call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.
