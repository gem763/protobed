So there\u2019s no way to tell how they\u2019ll actually sound, and how Google\u2019s various software tricks work in practice.\n\nWhat I can tell you is that Google has produced a set of small, minimally designed earbuds that look like nothing more than little circles in your ears when you\u2019re wearing them and fit snugly thanks to the little wing coming off the side. The earbud itself slides down into your ear, providing a modicum of passive noise reduction, but Google says the design is vented to reduce discomfort and provide some outside sound. They have touch controls for play, pause, and volume, and Google says they\u2019ll run for five hours of continuous battery life on a single charge, and up to 24 hours of battery life using the case.\n\nThat case is also very nice and small, and you can basically drop the buds in at any angle to charge; magnets snap them into place. The buds are also sweat and water-resistant.\n\nPaired with an Android phone running Android N or higher, you\u2019ll get some special features: the Pixel Buds can detect the noise level of the environment you\u2019re in and adjust phone volume accordingly, you can just say \u201cHey Google\u201d to access the Assistant and features like live language translation. Google says more AI features will arrive over time, as well.\n\nIf you\u2019re paired with an iPhone, the Pixel Buds will just function like regular Bluetooth headphones, because headphones in 2019 are a soul-destroying battle between competing platform vendors giving their own products special features. But Google says the Pixel Buds have long-range Bluetooth that can work across \u201cup to three\u201d rooms indoors and \u201cacross a football field\u201d outdoors. And the beam-forming mics and accelerometers that detect jaw motion should work the same to improve call quality as well.\n\nThe Google Pixel Buds will be available next spring, cost $179, and will come in four colors: \u201cclearly white,\u201d \u201coh so orange,\u201d \u201cquite mint,\u201d and \u201calmost black.\u201d\n\nAll in all, the new Pixel Buds look like promising competitors to the AirPods, but until we can hear them and review all these features, we can\u2019t really know for sure. And that won\u2019t happen until next year.", "description": "Google\u2019s new Pixel Buds are nice-looking competitors to the AirPods that have special features when used with Android phones, but they\u2019re not out until next spring.", "authors": ["Nilay Patel", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_U23E8G-6_j5s7ee3B0w5q3UNhI=/0x74:2040x1142/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19289411/DSCF8017.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
