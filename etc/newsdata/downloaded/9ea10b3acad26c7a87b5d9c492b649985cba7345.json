The statement sent shockwaves through the American Bar Association, startled activist judges, and underscored the stakes for the soon-after incendiary hearings on the nominations of Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas.\n\nMore than that, it galvanized a fierce and still-ongoing debate in law schools, legal journals, and courtrooms across the country. Mr. Meese raised an issue that has come to illumine much of the division that defines today\u2019s politics: Do America\u2019s founding documents stand for certain enduring truths and freedoms ... or for whatever each new generation decides they should stand for?\n\nThe elevation of that issue\u2014and his determination to keep pressing it over the last three decades\u2014has kept a line drawn in the sands of federal law, reinvigorated freedom-focused public interest litigation, and expanded the protection of personal freedom for two generations of Americans.\n\nI\u2019m delighted to say I\u2019ve enjoyed a front-row seat for much of that. I served in several positions within the Justice Department under Attorney General Meese\u2019s selfless leadership. From those positions, I was among the many impressed by his bold and thoughtful leadership, his insights and humor, and his determination in the face of all obstacles.\n\nI was particularly impressed by his ability to endure vicious, personal attacks without responding in kind. By his ability to \u201ckeep his head\u201d when all about him seemed to be losing theirs in the crisis-of-the-moment. By his ability to look beyond the immediate situation and circumstances to see the long-term implications of a decision, and the challenges still coming down the road. He was one of the most natural leaders I have ever known.\n\nAnd one of the most loyal friends. When I and others, in our own spheres of leadership, faced unfair, brutal attacks, he stood resolutely by our side, offering his hard-earned wisdom, quiet strength, and generous support.\n\nPerhaps most of all, I was moved by Mr. Meese\u2019s patriotism\u2014by his unswerving commitment not to one man or administration, or one title or position, but to our nation ... to its Constitution ... to the enduring cause of freedom and justice for all.\n\nIt is so hard, amid the rising roar and brutality of our current politics, to recognize those who genuinely look on government not as a succession of microphones and photo-ops, or power trips or partisan free-for-alls, but as a place of service\u2014an opportunity to preserve what is good while expanding more opportunities for people everywhere.\n\nThat is the spirit Ed Meese modeled, with selfless devotion, before those of us privileged to serve with him. Even in those relatively calmer political waters of 30-plus years ago, his approach was nothing less than revolutionary.\n\nHis great friend President Reagan once told the nation, \u201cIf Ed Meese is not a good man, there are no good men.\u201d Good men, they say, can be hard to find. But they\u2019re out there.\n\nEd Meese\u2019s long fight to preserve liberty and the Constitution, and the uncompromising integrity with which he\u2019s engaged that struggle, remind us of that\u2014that there are, in fact, still \u201ca few good men.\u201d Even great ones.\n\nAnd hope for America, and the freedom for which it stands.\n\nAlan Sears served under Attorney General Edwin Meese III in several capacities.
