They now had two midfielders at the heart of defence.\n\nNorwich\u2019s best attacking moments followed. Pukki led a counter attack that ended with Steve Cook diverting the Finland striker\u2019s cross shot narrowly over his own bar. Ibrahim Amadou then headed over after Bournemouth only half-cleared the resulting corner.\n\nWilson turned another teasing delivery, this time from Diego Rico, just past the post before Norwich launched another promising counter. At last the game had opened up and come to life.\n\nBOURNEMOUTH 0-0 NORWICH BOURNEMOUTH (4-4-2): Ramsdale 7; Smith 7, S Cook 7, Ake 7, Rico 7; H Wilson 5.5 (Danjuma 69, 6), L Cook 7, Billing 7.5, Fraser 7; C Wilson 6.5, Solanke 4 (King 63, 6).

Not used: McGovern, Byram, Stiepermann, Drmic. Booked: Lewis, McLean, Pukki Manager: Daniel Farke 7.5\n\nIt was the sort of situation Josh King might be able to exploit and Howe introduced him just after the hour having started him on the bench due to fatigue following his exertions with Norway during the break.\n\nBournemouth, though, needed their impressive young goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale to keep the game goalless with a sprawling save low down to his right to palm Pukki\u2019s effort behind for a corner.\n\nHowe made his last attacking throw of the dice by chucking on winger Arnaut Danjuma and he tested Krul before seeing a second goalbound effort blocked.\n\nWith seven minutes left, Tom Trybull had Ramsdale flying across his goal as the midfielder\u2019s thumping bent away from goal and just wide.\n\nRight at the death there was one last sniff of goal for Pukki but, in keeping with what had gone before when both defences had been on top, Nathan Ake nipped in with a perfectly-timed intervention.", "description": "Bournemouth and Norwich played out an unlikely goalless draw to earn their first clean sheets of the season.
