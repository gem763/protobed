Get them in a headlock? Kung-fu kick him? Crikey.\n\nThis is getting silly now. It\u2019s either a foul or it\u2019s not, and this challenge by Victor Lindelof on Divock Origi was definitely a foul. This whole \u2018clear and obvious\u2019 excuse has become a cop out.\n\nVAR was controversial once again when Divock Origi looked to have been fouled by Lindelof\n\nMarcus Rashford went on to score from the resulting phase of play for Manchester United\n\nThe television replays showed Origi getting kicked in the calf. How obvious do you want it? It was in the same attacking phase as Marcus Rashford\u2019s goal, too, so VAR should have ruled it out.\n\nAt the very least, referee Martin Atkinson should have went to his pitch-side monitor to double-check the incident. That would have lessened the controversy, even if he decided to stand by his original decision.\n\nThis was a huge moment in a huge match, and the officials got it wrong for me. It is incidents such as this that make me lose faith in VAR.", "description": "CHRIS SUTTON: This is getting silly now.
