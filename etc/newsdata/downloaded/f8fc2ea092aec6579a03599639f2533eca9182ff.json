Me and a female friend were travelling and a fellow \u201cIndian\u201d stopped our bike and commanded my lady friend to be an \u201cIndian\u201d and not to wear the type of clothes she was wearing and repeatedly kept on asking her the question \u201d Are you an Indian ? \u201c This fellow indian is proof of the degrading and dangerous state where our society is heading . HE WAS NOT DRUNK . He was a sober educated indian common man who is now keeping a watch of the sanctity of his own \u201cINDIAN CULTURE \u201c that he thinks is wronged by dress code of my lady friend . His nonchalant behaviour was so scary as he kept on asking people nearby pointing at my lady friend in support to give a judgement weather he was right or wrong as you see in the video . THIS MAN WAS NOT AT ALL CONFUSED CONVINCED!\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the video where the man is wearing a shirt and pant (when did that become an Indian dress code by the way?) saying that the girl should follow the Indian and Hindu \u2018dress code\u2019 -whatever that is. The angry friend tells the man that no clause of the constitution dictates how a person should dress.\n\nDon't Miss 141 SHARES 11 K SHARES 186 SHARES 200 SHARES\n\nNow a man, himself dressed in Western clothes, TALKING IN ENGLISH is talking about INDIAN HINDU code and rules. Do I really need to point out the irony here?\n\nIt seems that some men believe they can dictate the lives of women and employing religion just makes their argument stronger; not only is that problematic and extremely misguided. Might I suggest something for such people? Please go and read the constitution.", "description": "Moral policing seems to be the \u2018time pass\u2019 of most Indian men who literally have no job in life.
