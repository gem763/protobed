However, he vowed to punish Turkey if the country takes any action the U.S. considers \u201coff limits.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of sand that they can play with,\u201d Trump said Wednesday. \u201cLet them fight their own wars.\u201d\n\nSenators Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), and Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) also voiced support for the new sanctions.\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "Vice President Mike Pence said Thursday that the U.S. will withdraw existing Turkish sanctions and will not impose any additional ones after Turkey agreed to a five-day ceasefire with Kurdish forces in Syria.Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan for", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/pAOwmE9ydi1.Ys7cSaR7zQ--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/mike-pence.jpg?fit=1024%2C597&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
