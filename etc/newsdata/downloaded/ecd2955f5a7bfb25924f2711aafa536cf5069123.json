REUTERS/Aly Song\n\nBy mid-morning, dozens of Beijing supporters had started to tear down the large mosaics of colourful posted notes calling for democracy and denouncing perceived Chinese meddling in the former British colony.\n\nThe installations have blossomed across the Asian financial centre, at bus stops and shopping centres, under footbridges and along pedestrian walkways.\n\nThey have also occasionally become hot spots of violence in the city\u2019s three months of unrest.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s protests picked up in June over legislation, now withdrawn, that would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial. Demands have since broadened into calls for universal suffrage.\n\nA pro-Beijing city legislator, Junius Ho, who has been a vocal critic of the protests, had urged his supporters to clean up the approximately 100 \u201cLennon Walls around the city on Saturday.\n\nThe walls are named after the John Lennon Wall in communist-controlled Prague in the 1980s that was covered with Beatles lyrics and messages of political grievance.\n\nHowever, in a message posted late on Friday his Facebook page on Friday, Ho said \u201cfor the sake of safety\u201d the Lennon Walls would not be cleared up, only the streets.\n\n\u201cWe will clean up the environment with a peaceful and rational attitude,\u201d he said.\n\nThe anti-government protesters are angry about what they see as creeping interference by Beijing on Hong Kong\u2019s \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula that ensures freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland, including the right of assembly and an independent judiciary.\n\nChina says it is committed to the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d arrangement and denies interfering. It has accused foreign governments including the United States and Britain, of inciting the unrest.\n\nThe demonstrations have taken on their own rhythm over the months and now tend to peak on the weekends, often with anti-government activists, many masked and in black, throwing petrol bombs at police, trashing metro stations, blocking airport roads and lighting street fires.\n\nAt times, they have been confronted by supporters of Beijing wielding sticks.\n\nMore pro-democracy protests are planned this weekend including a sit in the Yuen Long suburban subway station, marking two months since activists were attacked by a mob there.\n\nThe city\u2019s transit operator, MTR Corp (0066.HK), said it would close train stations near potential protest sites, including Yuen Long and Tuen Mun, for safety reasons starting from early afternoon.\n\nProtesters had said on Friday that while they did not want violence, they would defend themselves if they were attacked.", "description": "Groups of China supporters pulled down \"Lennon Walls\" of anti-government protest messages across Hong Kong on Saturday, raising the possibility of clashes with democracy supporters and another weekend of trouble.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190921&t=2&i=1432208631&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8K048", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
