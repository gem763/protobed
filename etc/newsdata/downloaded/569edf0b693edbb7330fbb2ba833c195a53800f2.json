In 2016, the company was fined $200 million for opening millions of fake accounts in order to meet sales goals. Two years later, it had to pay $1 billion to settle federal charges over consumer abuses related to its auto lending and mortgage businesses.\n\nFormer CEO and veteran Wells executive Tim Sloan, who once denied that the phony accounts were a problem, abruptly resigned in March.\n\nSince then, the bank has struggled to find a new top executive. In a possible sign of the concession it had to make to get Scharf on board, he will be based in New York City, where he currently lives, rather than at the bank's headquarters in San Francisco. He is due to start his new role in October.", "description": "Scandal-tainted bank taps former top deputy to JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon to rehab its reputation", "authors": ["Stephen Gandel"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/03/28/c1ca8c79-6e98-481c-be57-ede33d5b9ce1/thumbnail/1200x630/6d534097d18d7a14602804accce531bf/ap-394030027553.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
