We are asking for common sense changes to laws so that, like politicians, the unique role journalists have in serving society is acknowledged.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSenate estimates deflections\n\nWhile media companies lobby for the overhaul of press freedom rules, opposition and minor party MPs repeatedly found their lines of questioning at Senate estimates hearings shut down.\n\nTo avoid being interrogated too deeply or address politically sensitive issues, ministers and bureaucrats often deflected by taking questions on notice, giving officials weeks to massage their response.\n\nMr Morrison's own department of Prime Minister and Cabinet took 125 questions on notice on Monday alone.\n\nLabor leader Anthony Albanese told Tuesday's caucus meeting the Opposition needed to link the Your Right to Know campaign with the fact Mr Morrison \"refuses to give a straight answer to a simple question\".\n\nIn one notable exchange, bureaucrats cited harm to international relations for their refusal to answer whether Mr Morrison's office had put forward Hillsong church pastor Brian Houston to be included on the guest list for a state dinner at the White House last month. Mr Morrison has dismissed questions over the issue as \"gossip\".", "description": "Media industry says the PM's admission he would not want to live in a country where politicians decide prosecutions proves their point about the need for law changes.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2112%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/dbe772a4d94fc38cdc468a4f6ef8a483d61b6f95", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
