Subscribe here to get the G-File delivered to your inbox on Fridays.\n\nDear Reader (and all men of the West),\n\nSo just to get it out of the way: Who has two thumbs and loves Western Civilization? This guy (I am pointing my thumbs me-ward, which makes typing hard).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust to be clear, I don\u2019t mean \u201cso-called Western Civilization\u201d but you know, Western Civilization.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI mean the thing both liberals and conservatives alike have celebrated for hundreds of years since words like \u201cliberal\u201d and \u201cconservative\u201d had any relevance to politics.\n\nOf course, this is not to say everyone agreed on what Western Civilization is, was, or should be.\n\nBut when I read this from my old friend Peter Beinart, I have to scratch my head.\n\nIn his speech in Poland on Thursday, Donald Trump referred 10 times to \u201cthe West\u201d and five times to \u201cour civilization.\u201d His white nationalist supporters will understand exactly what he means. It\u2019s important that other Americans do, too. . . . The West is a racial and religious term. To be considered Western, a country must be largely Christian (preferably Protestant or Catholic) and largely white.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, this is a more defensible statement than some of my friends on the right seem to think. I say \u201cdefensible\u201d because it\u2019s largely true, but only a partial and mincing truth. Peter is right to note that the West has largely been defined by Christianity, but who can deny that? Though let\u2019s not forget that Christianity itself was born in what used to be called the Orient (ditto Judaism).\n\nThis fact is a nice way of noting that even in the earliest days when Western Civilization was not particularly civilized, it was borrowing from other cultures. That\u2019s a huge part of what makes Western Civilization so special. Sure, it\u2019s got its history of bigotries, atrocities, and other sins \u2014 quick, tell me which civilization or society doesn\u2019t? \u2014 but a central part of the West\u2019s modus operandi has been to sift through what is best in other cultures and our own and appropriate it or modify it. The West, historically, has been more interested in other cultures and civilizations than any other. Celebrating our long history of open-minded curiosity and tolerance is not closed-minded bigotry, no matter how hard you try.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat makes Peter\u2019s statement indefensible is the context. Peter pretty clearly wants to suggest that, because the West, historically, has described a mostly white, mostly Protestant or Catholic civilization, defending it must be an example of bigotry. Must it? Were Will and Ariel Durant spelunkers in the history of white privilege and nativism? Was Isaiah Berlin a trafficker in little more than prettified white-supremacist dogma?\n\nThe West also means something more than merely the culture of white Christians, and if someone other than Donald Trump had given that speech, I think Peter would have an easier time acknowledging it. After all, he is a great fan of Reinhold Niebuhr, who said, \u201cWe take, and must continue to take, morally hazardous actions to preserve our civilization.\u201d I doubt Peter would dare to call this a white-nationalist dog whistle.\n\nInclusion for All Cultures but Our Own\n\nWe\u2019ve reached a pathetic and dangerous point in our culture where anyone who celebrates our traditional culture, our country, and, now, our civilization must be doing so for base and evil reasons (see Rod Dreher for more on this). Today, all other cultures must be celebrated while every ill is blamed on us. This is, to borrow a phrase from social science, garbage thinking. Slavery is a human universal, appearing in every culture around the world. What makes the West unique is not that we had slavery, but that we put an end to it because it was not compatible with our values. The same goes for nearly every charge in the indictment against the West, from racism and misogyny to imperialism and war.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs I\u2019ve written before, the reason Gandhi practiced non-violence against the British Empire is not quite because he abhorred bloodshed, but because he knew pacifism would work against the British. Hitler, who saw himself as a rebel against Western values as evolved from the slave religion of Christianity, never got many lectures about non-violence from his friend Gandhi.\n\nWe fall short of our ideals, but everyone always does (that\u2019s why they\u2019re called \u201cideals\u201d). But in head-to-head match-ups, we do better than the rest of the pack.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWest Bashing Is Western\n\nWhat\u2019s ironic is that Peter\u2019s desk-pounding outrage about Trump\u2019s talk of the West is oh-so Western. The West\u2019s tolerance for anti-Western philosophies is a fairly unique feature of the West itself. We love to beat ourselves up.\n\nBefore the Enlightenment, the job of saying the West is corrupt and evil largely fell to gnostic heretics and the like \u2014 because everything was seen through the prism of religion. Since the Enlightenment, that passion has migrated to more secular humanist creeds. There\u2019s always been a Rousseauian streak in the West that says, \u201cit\u2019s all crap, burn it down.\u201d\n\nThe West\u2019s tolerance for anti-Western philosophies is a fairly unique feature of the West itself. We love to beat ourselves up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, again, until pretty recently, that tendency wasn\u2019t against \u201cthe West\u201d so much as it was against the Enlightenment or democracy or capitalism. Western radicals argued that the West had taken a wrong turn, not that the East was better. There was still this idea that the West was where the action was. Rousseau\u2019s favorite society, after the Geneva of his youth, was ancient Sparta, which is still, you know, part of the West. (Me, I\u2019ll take Athens any day.) But even so, this was an argument within the West about what path the West should follow or where its true roots lay. Some of the Romantics admired Mohammed, but only because he was a man of Will and a useful stand-in for their assaults on the Catholic Church, not because they actually believed in Islam or anything. The Jacobins wanted to start over at Year Zero, but they had no problem believing that history was starting over in the West, in Paris to be exact. Karl Marx, as Western a figure as you can find, believed that the first pages in the next chapter of human history would first turn in England.\n\nThe Anti-Western Cul-de-sac\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat sincerely shocks me about Peter\u2019s outburst is that he has to know what an incredibly bad idea it is for the liberal-Left to go down this road. The list of reasons why the new hatred of Western Civilization is such a bad idea for liberals is too long to recount here but I\u2019ll offer two fairly practical ones. The whole reason liberalism is in trouble today is that it has lost the ability to speak confidently in patriotic and loving terms about America, unless it is in the context of selling some government program or pressing some nakedly political advantage (I\u2019m thinking mostly about immigration maximalism and identity politics). Cutting Medicaid may be wrong, but it\u2019s not unpatriotic. Peter himself recently argued that Democrats need to refocus on the importance of assimilation if they want to be trusted on the issue of immigration. Well, assimilation to what? If American culture is worth assimilating into, so is Western Culture, because the two cannot be separated.\n\nRight now, there\u2019s a hilarious effort afoot to defend the anti-Semitic Saudi sock-puppet Linda Sarsour. She recently called for jihad against Donald Trump and insisted that American Muslims must never, ever assimilate into American culture. So, we have the glorious beclowning spectacle of liberals falling over themselves to defend the subtle nuances of the word \u201cjihad\u201d while at the same telling us that Western Civilization is a dog\u2019s breakfast of backwardness and bigotry. Good luck with that.\n\nDon\u2019t you people realize that you\u2019re like Richard Gere in An Officer and a Gentleman? You\u2019ve got nowhere else to go.\n\nSecond, don\u2019t you people realize that you\u2019re like Richard Gere in An Officer and a Gentleman? You\u2019ve got nowhere else to go. Peter is right that there are non-Western democracies out there. Sure, Japan has Japanese characteristics and India has Indian characteristics. But what makes them democracies is their embrace of Western values. And there is no place in the world physically or conceptually outside the West where these liberals would actually want to live. Insisting that Western Civilization is a corrupt and irredeemable concept is the intellectual and political equivalent of sh*tting where you eat. It leaves you no language that resonates with anyone outside an American Studies department at Fresno State.\n\nOn the Other Hand\n\nBut I will tell you what I did not like about Trump\u2019s speech (though I should say on the whole I liked it and agreed with most of it). In Trump\u2019s telling, the threat to Western Civilization must be met with his favorite qualities: Strength! Will! Etc.!\n\nThe fundamental question of our time is whether the West has the will to survive. Do we have the confidence in our values to defend them at any cost? Do we have enough respect for our citizens to protect our borders? Do we have the desire and the courage to preserve our civilization in the face of those who would subvert and destroy it?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOr, here\u2019s his pithier summary:\n\nTHE WEST WILL NEVER BE BROKEN. Our values will PREVAIL. Our people will THRIVE and our civilization will TRIUMPH! pic.twitter.com/sozuVgdp5T \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 6, 2017\n\nThen, yesterday, Barley and Zo\u00eb were once again playing king of the mountain, when Zo\u00eb spotted a squirrel on a tree. The squirrel was less lucky than the duck. When I tweeted this out yesterday, a whole bunch of people got mad at me for being a party to the slaughter of a squirrel. I\u2019d generally prefer it if the Dingo didn\u2019t kill critters, but I am at a loss as to how people can begrudge a dingo for being dingo-y or how some want to claim that squirrels are like miniature tree pandas. Anyway, the funny thing to me is that just the night before, Zo\u00eb once again tried to embrace the Spaniel\u2019s pacifism and learn how to appreciate tennis balls. She sort of reminded me of the sharks from Finding Nemo (Fish are friends, not food!). She played with the ball for a while, but she clearly wanted it to act more like prey. She\u2019d bite it, then wait for it to squeal or \u201crun\u201d away. Then she\u2019d pounce on it. The experiment didn\u2019t last long. I think for the time being, the lesson is: Squirrels, watch out.\n\nI\u2019ll be on Special Report tonight.\n\nICYMI . . .\n\nLast week\u2019s G-File\n\nTrump and the media have a codependent relationship.\n\nJon Meachem is wrong about Woodrow Wilson.\n\nWhen would you stop loving America?\n\nHow political ignorance affects our political debates.\n\nAnd now, the weird stuff.\n\nDebby\u2019s Independence Day links\n\nWhy did Yankee Doodle call a feather macaroni?\n\nCarnivorous Romanian ducks\n\nIs there a mathematical formula for . . .\n\nKFC sandwich launched into space\n\nMountain of skulls unearthed in Mexico\n\nBehold: a scorpion-venom-milking robot\n\nHow Americans order their steak\n\nRussian motorist arrested for barking like a dog\n\nBird enjoys Q-tip massage\n\nThe secret language of lightning bugs\n\nHow to make a sandwich you can still eat after a year\n\nWhy is George R.
