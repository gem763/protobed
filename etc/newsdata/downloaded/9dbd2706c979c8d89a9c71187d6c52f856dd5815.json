That freedom should be protected, regardless of whether people share the government\u2019s point of view. We\u2019re encouraged that the Arizona Supreme Court has ruled today to protect that key freedom\u2014 guaranteed by the Constitution and so crucial to American life.\"\n\n\"Today\u2019s victory is not just a win for Breanna Koski and me,\" Duka added. \"It's a victory for everyone. Everyone should be free to peacefully live and work according to their beliefs without fear of unjust punishment. We brought our case to protect this freedom, not just for ourselves, but for all Americans.\"\n\nThe studio owners filed the suit to enjoin the city from citing them for violating the ordinance. They had not yet been cited. The owners also sought a declaration that the ordinance violates their free speech and religious exercise rights, but the court stuck to a more narrow decision applying only to the owners and their wedding invitations.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\n\"The city of Phoenix\u2019s anti-discrimination ordinance is still a legal, valid law and remains in effect,\" the city of Phoenix said in a statement. \"It currently affirms that everyone should be treated fairly and equally regardless of sexual orientation, race, religion, sex, gender or disability. On September 16, 2019, the Arizona Supreme Court made a very narrow ruling that one local business has the right to refuse to make custom wedding invitations for same-sex couples\u2019 weddings that are similar to the designer\u2019s previous products. This ruling does not apply to any other business in Phoenix.\"\n\nRelated Articles", "description": "Joanna Duka and Breanna Koski, who run Brush & Nib Studio, potentially faced $2,500 in fines and six months in jail for violating Phoenix's 2013 ordinance.", "authors": ["Christian De La Chapelle"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/m/social/images/social_default_logo-1481777.png", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
