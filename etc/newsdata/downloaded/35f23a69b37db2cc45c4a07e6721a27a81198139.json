And while the clip might be the first you\u2019ve seen of him, that\u2019s in fact five wins in a row for Johnson, who also earned a victory on Dana White\u2019s Contender Series this past summer.\n\nSo you can\u2019t blame Johnson, really, for taking a minute to bask in the attention after a long and winding road in the sport, which started way back in 2007.\n\n\u201cYeah, I gotta say, this makes it feel like all the effort has been worth it,\u201d Johnson told MMA Junkie after the fight. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this a while, and I\u2019ve been doing it because I love what I do, but it does feel good to get a little bit of recognition.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of recognizing, Johnson (8-2 MMA, 1-0 BMMA) seemed to presage the finish late in the first round, when he dropped a hard-charging Schilling (4-6 MMA, 3-3 BMMA), who\u2019s had a tendency to make mental errors, with a wicked counter shot.\n\nFrom there, the fight turned into a battle of attrition, with Johnson absorbing punishing calf kicks throughout the fight, just to bite down on his mouthpiece and keep moving forward. It also didn\u2019t help that his vision was blurry in one eye for much of the fight.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t see out of one eye, and then I got poked in the other one later,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to have that guy coming at you when your vision is blurry. Fortunately it cleared itself up by the time the third round started.\u201d\n\nJohnson pressed forward in the third until he landed the fight\u2019s finishing blow, the huge counter left to the jaw that dropped Schilling, followed by one more on the mat just to make sure.\n\nSo where does Johnson go from here? He was on a one-fight Bellator deal, which seems to indicate the promotion only expected him to be an \u201copponent\u201d for Schilling. But with five straight wins and having now proven his ability to put on crowd-pleasing scraps, Johnson has indicated if a real offer comes from Bellator, he\u2019ll prioritize MMA over boxing.\n\n\u201cIf Bellator wants to have me around and come to a longer deal, I\u2019ll make it my first priority,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI love boxing, I still want to do it, but I think I showed people here I can give the type of fights the fans like.\u201d", "description": "Tony Johnson dropped Joe Schilling with a ridiculous knockout in the third round of their Bellator 229 fight.", "authors": ["Dave Doyle", "Farah Hannoun", "John Morgan", "Blue Corner", "Matt Erickson", "Ken Hathaway", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Mike Bohn", "Abbey Subhan"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/bellator229-tony-johnson-joe-schilling.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
