As an illustration of the challenge OPEC is facing, the U.S. briefly overtook Saudi Arabia as the world\u2019s largest oil exporter in June.\n\nA committee of OPEC+ members is meeting in Abu Dhabi on Thursday to discuss compliance with output cuts that are due to expire in March. Though Russia said earlier this week that deeper cuts are currently off the agenda, the International Energy Agency\u2019s balances suggest the group\u2019s current production levels won\u2019t be enough to prevent a return to inventory builds next year.\n\n\u201cThe challenge of market management remains a daunting one well into 2020,\u201d the agency said in its monthly report. \u201cSoon, the OPEC+ producers will once again see surging non-OPEC oil production with the implied market balance returning to a significant surplus and placing pressure on prices.\u201d\n\nSupply from outside the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will grow by 1.3 million barrels a day in the second half of the year, after an \u201cenormous production surge\u201d over the same period last year. That will be followed by a 2.3 million barrel a day increase in 2020.\n\n\u201cWhile the relentless stock builds we have seen since early 2018 have halted, this is temporary,\u201d the IEA said.\n\nMuch of the growth continues to come from the expansion of U.S. output, but there are several projects elsewhere also boosting the figure. Norway\u2019s giant Johan Sverdrup field will come online before the end of the year and produce 440,000 barrels a day by the middle of 2020, while seven new production units have started in Brazil since the end of last year, the IEA said.\n\nThe agency retained its oil demand growth forecast of 1.1 million barrels a day this year as the market continues to be whipsawed by the trade war between the U.S. and China. Consumption increased by just 200,000 barrels a day in June, meaning world oil demand growth averaged 450,000 barrels a day in the first half.\n\nThose figures should rebound to 2 million barrels a day in the fourth quarter, driven in part by lower prices. For that to happen though, there needs to be no further deterioration in the economic climate or trade disputes, the agency said.\n\nAs demand has wavered, competition for market share both within and outside of OPEC has heated up. While Saudi Arabia has slashed production well below its quota under the output-cut agreement, not all producers have been as compliant. Russia, Iraq and Nigeria pumped 600,000 barrels a day more than their allocations.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Alex Longley in London at alongley@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alaric Nightingale at anightingal1@bloomberg.net, Christopher Sell, Rakteem Katakey\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- As OPEC and its allies meet in Abu Dhabi, the IEA said it faces a significant challenge in managing the market into 2020.Demand for the group\u2019s crude in the first half of 2020 will be 1.4 million barrels a day below its August output as production surges from their competitors, including", "authors": ["Alex Longley"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/M9XSldvDC68TBECWrKGcvw--~B/aD03NTA7dz0xMjk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/9efc094391bfc5432a620203a2b6f0b9", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
