If we lose a soldier, we will have 10,000 born in his place,\" he told AFP.\n\nAhmet Kaymaz, watching from the nearby customs gate, said he would not leave.\n\n\"We will not go anywhere. We will die in Akcakale,\" he told AFP. \"Can a person leave their motherland? We will not abandon it.\"\n\nA farmer, Ahmet Celikcan, who had travelled especially from his nearby village to watch the action, said he believed the government was not interested in seizing Syrian land and that the operation would allow the return of refugees.\n\n\"It is for the Syrians who are here that we want this. We do not want anything there. We don't have our eyes on any land,\" he said.", "description": "Ak\u00e7akale (Turkey) (AFP) - Mixed feelings permeated the Turkish town of Akcakale on the border with Syria on Thursday, with families fleeing a barrage of shells while others defiantly stayed to watch troops push into Syria.
