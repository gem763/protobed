The Times said it corroborated the story with two other officials who had heard the same report from Stier.\n\nIn a correction to the essay posted Sunday night, the Times said the woman involved in the alleged incident did not speak to the Times and that her friends say she does not recall that it happened. The essay\u2019s co-authors said Tuesday that these details were in the initial draft of the story but were taken out during the editing process.\n\nThe president has seized on the correction several times over the past few days, arguing Kavanaugh was treated unfairly and calling for everyone involved in the story to resign from the newspaper. In one instance, he suggested Kavanaugh should sue.", "description": "President Trump on Tuesday ramped up attacks on The New York Times amid continued controversy over a report that included a new sexual assault allegation against\u00a0Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald2_091219getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
