REUTERS/Anindito Mukherjee/File Photo\n\nHis remarks come at a time when India\u2019s automobile sector is battling a bruising slowdown and manufacturers fret about the impact of the government\u2019s plans to get the industry to switch to electric vehicles.\n\n\u201cThe government has no intentions of banning the production or stopping the existing petrol and diesel-fuelled vehicles,\u201d Gadkari said at an industry event in New Delhi.\n\nIndian auto stocks rose in afternoon trading following Gadkari\u2019s remarks on the tax cuts, with shares in Tata Motors Ltd gaining 5% and those in Maruti Suzuki India Ltd rising 1.8%.\n\nThe slowdown in demand for automobiles, made worse by a liquidity crunch among India\u2019s shadow banks, has forced major automakers to halt production and lay off thousands of workers.\n\nMaruti Suzuki is shutting its passenger vehicle manufacturing factories in Gurugram and Manesar in northern India for two days this month, it said on Wednesday.\n\nThis is the first time India\u2019s largest carmaker by market value is halting production due to lack of demand at both those plants, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday.\n\nThe company last faced major shutdowns in 2012 when a factory manager died due to violence at its Manesar plant, but its Gurugram plant had functioned as usual, the source, who was not authorized to discuss the matter with the media, said.\n\nMahindra and Mahindra Ltd, another top automaker, has cut some 1,500 jobs or about 5% of its workforce, and could lay off more workers if the slowdown persists, Managing Director Pawan Goenka said.\n\nThe company also plans to defer 10% of its capital expenditures or as much as 10 billion rupees ($140 million) this year as it cuts back on production, Goenka, speaking at the New Delhi event, said.\n\nSeparately on Thursday, Tata Motors Ltd said in a statement it had slashed vehicle production in August by 52%, the steepest cut in years by the country\u2019s largest automaker by revenue.\n\n($1 = 71.4920 Indian rupees)", "description": "India will not ban vehicles running on petrol or diesel and is considering cutting taxes on hybrid vehicles, Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190905&t=2&i=1426420619&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF840DG", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
