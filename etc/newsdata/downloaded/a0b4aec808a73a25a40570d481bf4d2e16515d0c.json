Unnamed sources routinely whisper their secrets into the pages of the nation\u2019s top newspapers. Among these anonymous sources are allies of the president, seeking to promote his policies, as well as opponents hoping to take him down a notch. I\u2019m no booster of anonymous sources, but even I recognize the distinguished, ancient pedigree they hold in American politics. Thomas Paine wrote Common Sense anonymously. Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay cloaked their authorship of The Federalist Papers under the pseudonym of \u201cPublius.\u201d In more recent days, journalist Joe Klein joined the lower levels of this pantheon with Primary Colors, his roman \u00e0 clef about Bill Clinton.\n\nMore important, time has been remarkably good to Anonymous\u2019 op-ed. When first published, it seemed vague, unnecessarily guarded and excessively self-congratulatory about its own courage. But read in the context of what we\u2019ve learned since about resistance by senior officials to President Donald Trump\u2019s orders, the op-ed seems a lot smarter. The op-ed boasted that the Trump administration was filled with many senior administration officials \u201cworking diligently from within to frustrate\u201d parts of Trump\u2019s \u201cagenda and his worst inclinations.\u201d A steady stream of news stories has appeared\u2014and continues to appear almost daily\u2014confirming the assertion of aggressive sandbagging of the president by top administration officials.", "description": "", "authors": ["Jack Shafer", "Politico.Com Magazine Story"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
