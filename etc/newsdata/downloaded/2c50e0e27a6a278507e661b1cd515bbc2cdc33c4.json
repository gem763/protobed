Chuck Schumer, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Rep. Steny Hoyer walked out of a meeting with President Trump today which they called a \u201cmeltdown,\u201d saying the final straw was when Trump insulted Pelosi as a third-rate politician.\n\nIt seems Trump agreed that it was a meltdown and tweeted a photo from his personal account.\n\nA lot of people are seeing the photo as picturing Pelosi in charge of the room, so much so that the Speaker made it the backdrop of her Twitter page.\n\nLet\u2019s be honest.\n\nThis was inevitable. pic.twitter.com/Mw9XAwOiU9 \u2014 Salvador Hernandez (@SalHernandez) October 16, 2019\n\nCaption: Karen asks to speak to the manager https://t.co/jX9szVDGyV \u2014 Greg Pollowitz (@GPollowitz) October 16, 2019\n\nDo not underestimate the strength that she brings. pic.twitter.com/sxxeQiAiPI \u2014 The Democrats (@TheDemocrats) October 16, 2019\n\nTrump also posted this picture, which shows the Democrats looking a little haggard.:\n\nDo you think they like me? pic.twitter.com/TDmUnJ8HtF \u2014 Donald J.

Impeachment ought to be fun.\n\n* * *\n\nUpdate:\n\nTalk about things escalating quickly:\n\nNancy Pelosi needs help fast! There is either something wrong with her \u201cupstairs,\u201d or she just plain doesn\u2019t like our great Country. She had a total meltdown in the White House today. It was very sad to watch. Pray for her, she is a very sick person! \u2014 Donald J.
