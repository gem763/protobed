Ms Kemp hesitated, then leaned in and put her arms around Guyger, who had just been sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\n\u201cFollowing my own convictions, I could not refuse that woman a hug. I would not,\u201d Ms Kemp told The Associated Press.\n\n\u201cAnd I don\u2019t understand the anger. And I guess I could say if you profess religious beliefs and you are going to follow them, I would hope that they not be situational and limited to one race only.\u201d\n\nMs Kemp saw a woman changed, she said, someone who might seek God\u2019s forgiveness if she knew where to start, if she had a Bible of her own.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Because she still has a lot of life ahead of her following her sentence and I would hope that she could live it purposefully.\u201d\n\nThe judge argued that her actions were appropriate because they took place after the trial and were not part of the official record.\n\nMs But Kemp\u2019s reasoning ignores a crucial point, said South Texas College of Law professor Kenneth Williams: the trial might not actually be over.\n\nIt\u2019s possible Guyger could appeal the decision and the case could wind up back in front of Kemp, who may then have to recuse herself, Williams said.\n\n\u201cThere would certainly be questions about whether she\u2019s neutral and impartial,\u201d he told The Washington Post.\n\n\u201cAs a judge, I don\u2019t think you\u2019d want to do anything to indicate that you might favour or oppose any parties in the case. I believe that by counselling Ms Guyger, she\u2019s given that impression.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s inappropriate; that\u2019s not a judge\u2019s role,\u201d Mr Williams continued. \u201cShe should have said no. It\u2019s just not routine, this is a total aberration. In 30 years, I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201d\n\nMs Kemp did not respond to interview requests from The Post, but she told AP this was the first time she has acknowledged her Christianity to a defendant or given one a Bible.\n\n\u201cYou can have mine,\u201d Ms Kemp told Guyger, handing her the book. \u201cI\u2019ve got three or four more at home. This is the one I use every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t done so much that you can\u2019t be forgiven,\u201d the judge added, according to a reporter in the room. \u201cYou did something bad in one moment in time. What you do now matters.\u201d\n\nMs Kemp flipped to a page in the New Testament \u2013 John 3:16, a verse highlighting God\u2019s love \u2013 and said: \u201cThis is where you start.\u201d\n\nShe picked that passage, she said, so Guyger \u201ccould recognise that, even given the fact that she murdered someone, God still loves her\u201d.\n\nThe exchange led the Freedom From Religion Foundation, which regularly files lawsuits defending the separation of church and state, to log a complaint with the Texas Commission on Judicial Conduct.\n\nMs Kemp, the group wrote, was \u201cproselytising in her official capacity\u201d and her actions \u201coverstepped judicial authority, were inappropriate and were unconstitutional\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is perfectly acceptable for private citizens to express their religious beliefs in court, but the rules are different for those acting in a governmental role ... it violates a vital constitutional principle for a sitting judge to promote personal religious beliefs while acting in her official capacity,\u201d the complaint read.\n\nOthers argued that the dramatic courtroom encounter took focus off the Jean family and made Guyger a sympathetic figure.\n\n\u201cIt definitely was a boon to Ms Guyger,\u201d Mr Williams said.\n\nAnd it further exacerbates the criminal justice system\u2019s racial divide, where leniency is more often afforded to white defendants.\n\n\u201cThe issue is not so much that compassion was extended to Amber Guyger,\u201d Jemar Tisby, an African American historian and writer, said in an interview with NPR. \u201cIt\u2019s that compassion is often withheld from black people in similar situations.\u201d\n\nMs Kemp, a Democrat, first ran for judge in 2014 \u2013 a decision she made after she fasted and prayed, AP reported.\n\nA graduate of the University of Oklahoma\u2019s law school, she worked in the Dallas County district attorney\u2019s office for about 15 years before launching her campaign.\n\nShe soundly defeated the Democratic incumbent in the primary and ran unopposed in the general election.\n\nFour years later, she won re-election, earning an endorsement from the editorial board of the Dallas Morning News, which praised her management of court business.\n\nMs Kemp hasn\u2019t yet said whether she plans to seek a third term.\n\nWashington Post", "description": "Judge Tammy Kemp was clad in black robes and seated at the bench in her Dallas courtroom when she reached for a tissue and wiped the tears from her eyes. It was the coda to an intense, closely watched trial.
