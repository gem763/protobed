In fourth place was Pitchfork Cheddar, made by Trethowan\u2019s Dairy, based in Somerset.\n\nThe French cheese that fared best in the contest was an Epoisses, a pungent soft cow\u2019s milk cheese from Burgundy, which took joint 8th place with a Swiss Gruy\u00e8re.\n\nOuest-France, one of the country\u2019s largest-circulation newspapers, expressed shock at the results. \u201cSacrilege: only one of the 15 top-rated cheeses is French,\u201d it commented.\n\nIt is not the first time that British and other non-French cheeses have won top international prizes. This year, however, it was particularly humiliating for France that Camembert, Comt\u00e9 and Roquefort were conspicuously absent from the highest rated of 3,804 cheeses from 42 countries.", "description": "A British Cheddar and an American blue cheese have surpassed French cheeses to take top awards at a prestigious international competition, prompting an outraged French newspaper to describe the results as \u201csacrilege\u201d.", "authors": ["David Chazan", "Emily Hill", "Nigel Farage", "John Longworth", "Tom Harris"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2016/11/02/112699358_cheddar-cheese-NEWS-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqvAxBzQt3PUdWagt7QmuukZOMikQE45jxr-c8o1gaefU.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
