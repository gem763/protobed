We\u2019ll split the analysis into three groups: very cheap, mid-tier, and expensive. A greater emphasis will be placed on the lower end of the price scale.\n\nPlease note, these player picks were organized early in the day. For MLB contests, always check lineups and weather closer to game time. Rain, wind, or unexpected managerial decisions could open up additional sources of value. Be sure to keep an eye on the MLB Headlines and Injuries desk.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Stay ahead of the competition from wire to wire with rankings, customizable projections, trade evaluator, exclusive columns and more in our Season Pass. And start using optimized lineups with our DFS Toolkit!\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nEight games are on the docket tonight.\n\nDIRT CHEAP BARGAINS\n\nElieser Hernandez \u2013 SP \u2013 Miami Marlins (at Pirates)\n\nStrikeouts are king on most DFS platforms. Despite consistently poor run prevention, Hernandez delivers about a strikeout per inning while tamping down on free passes (2.99 BB/9). His fatal flaw is that he\u2019s a fly ball pitcher with a serious case of homeritis (2.21 HR/9). The Pirates offense isn\u2019t especially powerful, and PNC Park is about as pitcher friendly as they come. Home runs will probably sink him once again. However, there\u2019s a reasonably large chance he\u2019ll turn in a solid outing of over five frames with as many strikeouts. That\u2019s would pay for his low price tag with upside for more.\n\nVladimir Guerrero Jr. \u2013 3B \u2013 Toronto Blue Jays (at Austin Pruitt)\n\nStory continues\n\nI typically want to use ground ball hitters against fly ball pitchers, but Guerrero seems to deliver his power swings against low-and-inside pitches. Pruitt fills the lower quadrants of the strike zone. I see about a one-in-five chance for a home run from Vladito with potential to serve a few missiles through the infield too. As a bonus, he has a valuable lineup role.\n\nNick Solak \u2013 2B/3B \u2013 Texas Rangers (at John Means)\n\nSolak is a must-play bargain tonight. He\u2019s a ground ball hitter visiting a fly ball pitcher at a homer-happy venue. I have the Rangers cleanup hitter projected for a hair under one-third of a home run. If he fails to go big, he\u2019s still likely to spray hard hit line drives. Means is the best pitcher on the Orioles staff. His quality changeup is the only thing standing in the way of a big game from Solak.\n\nTom Murphy \u2013 C \u2013 Seattle Mariners (at Wade Miley)\n\nAnother cleanup hitter, Murphy is an extreme fly ball hitter set to face an extreme ground ball guy. Advantage hitter. Murphy has a little over a one-in-four chance to homer. Due to a high strikeout rate coupled with an unwillingness to draw walks, Murphy is very much an all or nothing play. Of his 60 hits, half have gone for extra bases including 17 home runs (231 plate appearances). It\u2019s hard contact or bust.\n\nAlso Consider: Dario Agrazal, John Means, Chase Anderson, Lewis Brinson, Austin Dean, Braden Bishop, Tim Lopes, DJ Stewart, Austin Nola, Rowdy Tellez, Harold Ramirez\n\nMID-TIER MUST PLAYS\n\nJose Altuve \u2013 2B \u2013 Houston Astros (vs Marco Gonzales)\n\nAmerica\u2019s favorite second baseman may not be stealing bases like he used to, but he does have a career high in home runs. A valuable role in an elite offense leads to frequently favorable matchups. Gonzales, a soft-tossing southpaw, is not immune to bad outings. Plus, there\u2019s that horrific Mariners bullpen hiding behind him. Altuve is likely to rack up five plate appearances with a smattering of hits, runs, and a plausible chance for a home run.\n\nAlso Consider: Renato Nunez, Hanser Alberto, Trey Mancini, Victor Robles\n\nHIGH PRICED VALUES\n\nMookie Betts \u2013 OF \u2013 Boston Red Sox (vs Martin Perez)\n\nBetts is one of only a couple hitters who project to perform better than Altuve. Since the start of July, he\u2019s hitting a robust .330/.398/.607. He\u2019s fired off a pair of two-homer games over his last five contests. It looks like we\u2019re getting the 2018 version of Betts to me. He\u2019ll have the platoon advantage against Perez. The Twins southpaw has faded as the season progresses. Most recently, the lowly Tigers hammered him for eight runs in 2.2 innings. If the Tigers can dismantle him, you better believe the Red Sox are salivating.\n\nAlso Consider: Stephen Strasburg, J.D.
