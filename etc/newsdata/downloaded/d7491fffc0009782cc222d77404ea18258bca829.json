We list this year's Donki offerings from ugly to my eyes are bleeding.\n\nBy Lucy Dayman Oct 28, 2019 5 min read\n\nDonki, Don Quijote, Donkey Hotel\u2014whatever you want to call it\u2014is a place of wonder; a magical retail labyrinth overflowing with everything you\u2019ve ever needed. And plenty of stuff you definitely don\u2019t.\n\nDonki is not just a place to buy your groceries, pick up strange beauty inventions, exchange your cash, chat with robots and ride Ferris wheels. It\u2019s also an excellent place to pick up a last-minute Halloween costume. While Donki shines bright all year round in its garish yellow blue and red glory, the fact is especially true during Japan\u2019s spookiest season: Halloween.\n\nThe Mega Don Quijote in Shibuya where you can get your hands on the worst Halloween costume of your life.\n\nIf you\u2019re reading this now in preparation for Thursday\u2019s antics, to be honest, you\u2019re pushing your luck if you think you\u2019re going to nail an excellent Hollywood-grade costume.\n\nBut if you\u2019re going to fail, you might as well do it spectacularly, because a \u201cso bad it\u2019s good\u201d costume is always better than an \u201cOK\u201d one.\n\nWe assumed that Donki\u2019s shelves would be jam-packed with terrible costumes, so to test out the theory we went to Mega Donki in Shibuya, one of the most hectic outlets in the country. This is what we found formatted in a very subjective list which goes from bad (number 13) to worst (number 1).\n\nWe\u2019ll keep the analysis short and sweet because with these choices there\u2019s somehow both too much and nothing to be said.\n\n13. Giant poo man/emoji poop\n\nWhat is this shit?\n\nThis costume stinks. If you wanted to become the (questionably), popular Unko (poo) Museum personified, this is the get-up for you. If you do want to wear it, be sure to prepare for the \u201cyour costume is shit\u201d jokes. The only person who\u2019d choose to wear this and think it\u2019s going to be funny is the guy who says the same one line about getting shitfaced all night. At least you\u2019ll be warning people to keep a clear distance by wearing your personality as a costume.\n\n12. Scared radish\n\nBut why, tho?\n\nThis one is bad but actually so good because it hits the peak Japan trifecta: (1) It\u2019s food-related. (2) There are cute illustrations. (3) It makes no sense. This costume is ready for prime-time panel TV.\n\n11. Club Queen but also Police\n\nA crime of fashion.\n\nWhen you love to party, but also love being a law-abiding citizen and low-key want to be a ballerina.\n\n10. Pocket Shiet\n\nI\u2019m sorry, what?\n\nYeah, ok this was probably just an unfortunate spelling mistake, but man, it\u2019s impossible to read without thinking of Clay Davis from HBO\u2019s The Wire. If you\u2019ve never seen The Wire, then you can ignore this admission because you probably think it\u2019s shieeeeeeeeeet.\n\n9. Not quite Mike\n\nA Monster with STDs\u2026nice one Donki.\n\nThese off-brand costumes are the best thing about Donki Halloween. Especially when they make innocent Disney characters a little bit sexy, and more especially when they\u2019re a not-at-all sexy James P. Sullivan (better known as Sulley) from Monsters Inc. At least if they went with Mike Wazowski, the costume could have drawn attention to his long sexy legs. Ah well, maybe next year.\n\n8. Bad Lady\n\nOh, you\u2019re bad aright, and not in the cool Michael Jackson way either.\n\nDesigner: \u201cLet\u2019s make a low-rent Batwoman costume, but we can\u2019t use the term Batwoman, because it\u2019s copyrighted. What\u2019s close enough, but not close at all?\u201d\n\nTeam: \u201cHmmmm.\u201d\n\nIntern: \u201cHow about Bad Lady?\u201d\n\nTeam: \u201cPerfect.\u201d\n\n7. Save me\n\nPlease, God. Kill me.\n\nThis one mainly gets points for the photo on the front. The story behind the folks who get the gig of becoming Donki costume models has to be pretty fascinating. Are they failed models? There\u2019s something behind this guy\u2019s expression. What\u2019s he begging for\u2014a new job? That nobody he knows in real life sees this?\n\nIf it\u2019s all an act, then what did this priest do to warrant this type of expression? Maybe he\u2019s just praying that the people who see this don\u2019t notice that Christian is not spelled \u201cChriston.\u201d\n\n6. Pink School Witch\n\nAh, the classic \u201cpink school witch\u201d costume.\n\nThis is the definition of too extra. Do you want to be a witch or a schoolgirl? Both, plus you love pink and want to allude to your love of Oktoberfest\u2019s traditional Bavarian dress? Ok, we have the perfect costume! Double double, toil and trouble \u201cpink school witch\u201d is now a thing.\n\n5. Wizard of Oz tree on crack\n\nA spooky tree from the Wizard of Oz after getting high off their own supply.\n\nWhat is this from? It looks both so familiar but also out of place. It\u2019s from The Wizard of Oz, right? There were spooky trees in that, yeah?\n\nThis costume has to be a lead-in for an awkward party conversation.\n\n\u201cWhat are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cA scary tree, from The Wizard of Oz. I think.\u201d\n\n\u201cRetro, cool.\u201d\n\n\u201cYep.\u201d\n\n[Silence]\n\n\u201cOk, I\u2019m gonna go get a drink\u2026\u201d\n\n*Slinks off into the darkness never to be seen by tree man again*\n\n4. Fishnet bodysuit\n\nThis is definitely in the wrong section.\n\nOn what occasion would you wear this? Probably not Halloween. Donki, I don\u2019t think this is a Halloween costume. Is it worn over something or underneath? Also what\u2019s sexy about it? Flashing the back and the crack? How do these costumes get designed? What process does the design team go through? Is it a round table discussion, or an email thread? We demand to know the process!\n\n3. The crossdress \u201cjoke\u201d\n\nAhhahahahahahahahaha. SO original.\n\nThis is such a universally loved costume theme, it\u2019s weird it doesn\u2019t have a name yet. Let\u2019s just call this selection: \u201cFor guys who secretly want a reason to wear women\u2019s clothing but are too repressed to embrace it so they wait for Halloween to dress up as a \u201cjoke\u201d when there\u2019s actually nothing that funny about it. It\u2019s just funny for other repressed guys because somehow it\u2019s still the 1950s and the idea of being a woman is soooo funny.\u201d\n\nWhenever you see someone in one of these, you can always defer to the great punk scholar Iggy Pop who said \u201cI\u2019m not ashamed to dress \u2018like a woman\u2019 because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s shameful to be a woman.\u201d Preach.\n\n2. Look at my junk\n\nHey, look my penis is a tap!\n\nAdd swan dick to the list of dicks I wish I hadn\u2019t seen.\n\nThese two just scream, \u201cHey look! My penis is here,\u201d and that\u2019s really about it. If only there were more to say, but there isn\u2019t. There\u2019s a tap, and your penis is there. Oh, you\u2019re a swan, cool. Oh, and your penis is the neck. Right.\n\n1. Costume for one\n\nHey, we\u2019re all for self-love.\n\nPoints for creativity. This one begs some type of scathing commentary, but also the tagline is a more brutal burn for whoever wears this than anyone could every dish out; \u201cBe your own date.\u201d Bleak.", "description": "", "authors": ["Lucy Dayman", "Randiah Camille Green", "Limarc Ambalina", "Liam Carrigan"], "top_image": "https://gaijinpot.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/app/uploads/sites/4/2019/10/Don-Quijote-Halloween-Costumes-2019-Pocket-shiet.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
