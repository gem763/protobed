Tory MP Shailesh Vara, a member of the European Research Group (ERG), said Britain must not sign up to \u201cany deal\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe UK must hold its nerve. We must make it clear to the EU that whilst we are happy to have a deal, we want a deal, nevertheless it can\u2019t be any deal and hopefully the EU will see sense,\u201d the former Northern Ireland minister told the BBC.\n\n\u201cNobody wants no-deal. We all want to walk away with something that is fair.\u201d\n\nTory MP David Lidington, who was Theresa May\u2019s de facto deputy prime minister, said MPs would have to \u201ccompromise\u201d if a deal was to be approved - or else risk the EU losing patience.\n\n\u201cIt seems to me the omens are good. It seems they are edging very close indeed to a deal and I really hope with all my heart it succeeds,\u201d the former Europe minister told the BBC.\n\n\u201cI think it is really important for parliamentarians in all parties in Westminster to realise that extensions just postpone the moment of decision.\n\n\u201cParliament is going to have to take decisions. What I have found incredibly frustrating is that people on different wings of the Brexit debate have shied away from compromising when that is the only way we are going to resolve this matter. Eventually, if we are not careful, the 27 are simply going to run out of patience.\u201d", "description": "Brexit negotiations are continuing\u00a0in Brussels today in a desperate bid to get a political agreement ready in time for a crucial EU\u00a0leaders\u2019 summit.\u00a0Despite progress, EU officials\u00a0suggested any deal would still have to be delayed by around two months to \u201cresolve technical issues\u201d.", "authors": ["Adam Forrest", "Ashley Cowburn"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/09/16/Boris-Johnson.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
