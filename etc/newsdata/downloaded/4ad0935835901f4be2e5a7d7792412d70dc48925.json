From February 5, when it was introduced, to July 22, when it was finally pronounced dead, the court-packing plan monopolized the Senate\u2019s attention. \u201cIt preoccupied Washington and became its own drama,\u201d said Alter. \u201cHe had a huge mandate. . . [but] he wrecked it by being arrogant.\u201d The only legislation passed by Congress during this period were extensions for New Deal programs\u2014nothing to address the \u201cone-third of a nation ill-housed, ill-clad, ill-nourished\u201d that was the subject of Roosevelt\u2019s inaugural address. \u201cWhat Roosevelt found,\u201d Shesol said, \u201cwas that the court-packing issue had severely impaired his ability to get things done.\u201d\n\nMuch of the opposition to FDR\u2019s plan came from within the Democratic Party. For the first time, \u201cyou had Democratic voices, significant Democratic voices within the party, opposing Roosevelt in public and in Congress,\u201d Woolner said. Liberals feared that Roosevelt\u2019s plan would ultimately weaken the court as a guardian of civil rights by allowing future presidents with more regressive views to easily install justices hostile to minority rights. For conservative southern Democrats, the court-packing plan was their chance to oppose the president\u2019s expansive claims to federal and executive authority without risking popular disapproval. Catalyzed by this bill, these conservatives joined forces with the Republicans to form an anti-New Deal coalition that fractured the Democratic Party. \u201c[The bloc] caused all manner of mischief from this point forward,\u201d Shesol said. \u201cThis is a relationship that endures. These are the Democrats that eventually become Republicans.\u201d\n\nThe great irony of this saga is that Roosevelt would eventually get his court. Justice Owen Roberts, in \u201cthe switch in time that saved nine,\u201d began ruling in the administration\u2019s favor, and over the course of his long presidency Roosevelt would appoint nine justices to the Court, several of them architects of the New Deal. But the victory was to some extent hollow: As Leuchtenburg wrote, though the \u201cnew Court might be willing to uphold new laws ... an angry and divided Congress would pass few of them for the justices to consider.\u201d\n\nWhen the court-packing bill was finally shelved in July, the latent forces that it unleashed would continue to prove disruptive. The anti\u2013New Deal bloc would consistently block the administration\u2019s policies after conservative gains in the 1938 midterms. Though certain parts of Roosevelt\u2019s agenda would, after much delay, be enacted, the only legislation that approached the transformative nature of the New Deal was the Fair Labor Standards Act and the reauthorization of the Agricultural Adjustment Act in 1938, according to Woolen. The unique confluence of a historic electoral mandate, a popular president, and congressional supermajorities was wasted.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court packing plan is very significant because it was Roosevelt\u2019s greatest mistake,\u201d Woolen said. \u201cIt is often referred to as \u2018The End of Reform.\u2019\u201d\n\nHistorical analogies to contemporary politics have their limits. Meaningful details are obscured or forgotten, while others, taken out of context and exaggerated, appear determinative. While such analogies do not predict outcomes, they can illustrate possibilities\u2014and the failure of Roosevelt\u2019s court-packing plan is especially noteworthy now because the odds of its success were much greater than anyone could expect of such a plan in 2021.\n\nThe left\u2019s agenda today\u2014insofar as it\u2019s a genuinely actionable legislative program and not merely aspirational dream-making\u2014would rival if not exceed Johnson\u2019s Great Society and Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal in scope. Yet the congressional margins in 2021 will be exceedingly narrow, if not insurmountable. The Democrats must hold on to the House and win a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, which appears impossible. They must also, of course, win the White House. If they somehow accomplish those feats, and a President Buttigieg (or Warren\u2026 or Harris...) decides to pursue court-packing, there\u2019s no telling what damage it could do to the party. But it\u2019s clear, if history is any guide, that it would thwart the very ideas that helped lift Democrats to power.", "description": "FDR wasted an electoral mandate on a bid to expand the Supreme Court.
