The tour operator had a series of finance chiefs over the past two years.\n\nThe pay of the last three chief executives of Thomas Cook has come under increased scrutiny.\n\nLabour\u2019s John McDonnell has urged the former bosses to repay their bonuses while the Confederation of British Industry said \u201cquestions are now rightly being asked\u201d about the \u00a335m paid out over the past 12 years to Manny Fontenla-Novoa, Harriet Green and Peter Fankhauser.\n\nThe business secretary, Andrea Leadsom, defended the government\u2019s refusal to help bail out the company, insisting that it would have been \u201ca waste of taxpayers\u2019 money\u201d.\n\nShe would not comment on claims that the UK had refused to back a financial lifeline tabled by Spanish hoteliers and the Turkish government.\n\nShe said only that there were \u201call sorts of rumours\u201d but insisted that \u00a3200m was an underestimate of what the company needed to survive.\n\nA Department for Transport spokesperson later said: \u201cWe do not recognise the details of this proposed solution. At no point was a deal presented.\u201d\n\nThomas Cook had pinned its survival hopes on a restructuring that would have wiped out \u00a31.7bn of existing debts and injected an extra \u00a3900m, half from the Chinese tourism business Fosun. The Chinese company would have taken control of the firm. Demands from banks for an extra \u00a3200m pushed the firm over the edge.\n\nThe business select committee said it wanted answers about the collapse. Its chair, Rachel Reeves MP, said: \u201cThere are serious questions to answer, including about the company\u2019s accounting practices, its remuneration policy and practice, and about the stewardship of the company.\u201d\n\nLeadsom asked banks and credit card firms to give consideration to redundant Thomas Cook staff who may struggle with bills while awaiting redundancy payments.\n\nAbout 645 of them are now working for the Insolvency Service at the defunct group\u2019s Peterborough headquarters, assisting with Operation Matterhorn, the temporary airline set up by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to bring home stranded holidaymakers.\n\nThomas Cook collapse: your questions answered Read more\n\nThe CAA was due to bring 16,800 Thomas Cook customers back to the UK on Tuesday on 74 rescue flights. It repatriated 14,700 passengers on Monday, about 95% of whom had been due to fly that day.\n\nMany flights have been combined, with passengers flown in on larger jets and then taken to their destinations by bus. A Malaysian Airlines A380 superjumbo was flying between Mallorca and Manchester, carrying passengers also due to travel to Birmingham, Gatwick and Newcastle.\n\nSome holidaymakers reported continued confusion, including demands for payment from hoteliers fearful of not being paid, despite the CAA\u2019s guarantees to pay for rooms under the Atol protection scheme.\n\nCustomers who had booked with Thomas Cook but are yet to travel will get full refunds, but the prices of alternative trips will probably be much higher.\n\nMany flight and holiday prices have soared, prompting outrage on social media at BA, Jet2, Ryanair and Virgin among others. The cheapest direct return flights to destinations such as Crete and Tenerife are now almost \u00a3600 for a range of dates in October.", "description": "Travel firm\u2019s auditors also in spotlight with thousands of staff facing uncertain future", "authors": ["Sean Farrell", "Gwyn Topham", "Simon Goodley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/225b46794d5595d44a36b609646a32045737c770/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a92cde39e4768cbba98d2d311797c2c1", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
