Middleton went to the rim on the ensuing possession, got fouled and made both shots.\n\nTurkey had a chance at the end, but Ersan Ilyasova\u2019s jumper was off the mark and the Americans escaped.\n\nThe Americans have now won 21 consecutive World Cup games, extending the record for any nation at FIBA\u2019s signature event.\n\nTENNIS\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - Roger Federer gave away a lead against a guy he\u2019d never lost to and was beaten 3-6, 6-4, 3-6, 6-4, 6-2 by 78th-ranked Grigor Dimitrov in the U.S. Open quarterfinals before a stunned crowd at Arthur Ashe Stadium.\n\nThe 38-year-old Federer took a rare-for-him medical timeout after the fourth set, leaving the court with a trainer. Federer\u2019s upper back and neck gave him trouble.\n\nWhen play resumed after a break of nearly 10 minutes, Federer\u2019s form never picked up. He finished with 61 unforced errors, 33 on the forehand side.\n\nFederer had been 7-0 against Dimitrov, taking 16 of their previous 18 sets.\n\nFederer would have been the oldest Grand Slam semifinalist since Jimmy Connors was 39 at Flushing Meadows in 1991. He also was trying to add to his totals of five U.S. Open championships and 20 major trophies in all.\n\nInstead, Dimitrov advanced to his third major semifinal, first in New York. He will face No. 5 Daniil Medvedev on Friday.\n\nSerena Williams was not troubled one bit by the right ankle she rolled in her previous match. Didn\u2019t get much resistance from her opponent, either.\n\nLooking as dominant as can be, Williams moved just fine and powered her way into the U.S. Open semifinals by overwhelming 18th-seeded Wang Qiang of China 6-1, 6-0 in a mere 44 minutes to move closer to a 24th Grand Slam singles trophy.\n\nNFL\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) - Quarterback Jared Goff has agreed to a four-year contract extension with the Los Angeles Rams through the 2024 season.\n\nThe Rams confirmed the agreement Tuesday night. The team didn\u2019t disclose contract terms.\n\nGoff is beginning his fourth year with the Rams, who made him the No. 1 overall pick in the 2016 draft. After a rocky rookie season, Goff has become a two-time Pro Bowl selection under coach Sean McVay over the past two years.\n\nGoff has passed for 8,492 yards with 60 touchdowns and 19 interceptions in 31 regular-season games as McVay\u2019s starter. He also led the Rams to two playoff victories before the Super Bowl, where he struggled in a 19-for-38 performance for 229 yards in Los Angeles\u2019 13-3 loss.\n\nFLORHAM PARK, N.J. (AP) - The New York Jets have promoted longtime executive Hymie Elhai to team president.\n\nElhai is in his 20th year with the franchise and spent the last five as the Jets\u2019 senior vice president of business affairs and general counsel. He takes over for Neil Glat, who stepped down last Friday and will be a senior adviser with the team.\n\nThe Jets also announced Tuesday that Brian Friedman has become executive vice president and chief operating officer. Friedman is in his 11th year with the team and most recently was a senior vice president and chief financial officer.\n\nElhai will report to chairman and CEO Christopher Johnson and oversee the Jets\u2019 business operations. He\u2019ll also work closely with coach Adam Gase and general manager Joe Douglas to integrate football and business operations.\n\nCOLLEGE FOOTBALL\n\nSILVER CITY, N.M. (AP) - Western New Mexico University officials say freshman wide receiver Eddie Cruz has died in an apparent drowning.\n\nGrant County Sheriff\u2019s officials say a New Mexico State Police dive team was called out to Bill Evans Lake north of Silver City around 3 p.m. Monday after calls about a possible drowning.\n\nDivers recovered a man\u2019s body about 4\u00bd hours later.\n\nSheriff\u2019s officials say the incident remains under investigation.\n\nALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) - A New Mexico spokesman says the team has not yet reached the point of making coaching decisions for the Lobos\u2019 Sept. 14 game against Notre Dame.\n\nCoach Bob Davie, who is 64, had a \u201cserious medical incident\u201d Saturday following New Mexico\u2019s season-opening victory against Sam Houston State.\n\nHe said in a statement Sunday that he expects to fully recover. He thanked the UNM Hospital staff who treated him at a \u201ccritical time.\u201d\n\nThe nature of his medical episode remained unclear Tuesday.\n\nNew Mexico spokesman Frank Mercogliano says the team is \u201cnot to the point\u201d of making decisions about the game next week at Notre Dame.\n\nHOCKEY\n\nDETROIT (AP) - Niklas Kronwall is retiring after 15 seasons with the Detroit Red Wings.\n\nThe hard-hitting defenseman announced his retirement in a video Tuesday on the team\u2019s Twitter account, saying he would be taking a new role within the organization. Kronwall played 953 games in his NHL career and was part of the Detroit team that won the Stanley Cup in 2008.\n\nKronwall had three goals and 24 assists in 79 games last season.\n\nGYMNASTICS\n\nCLEVELAND (AP) - Olympic gymnastics champion Simone Biles says she\u2019s struggling with the arrest of her brother who was charged in a shooting that left three dead.\n\nShe said in a tweet Monday that her heart aches for everyone involved, especially the victims and their families.\n\nAuthorities in Ohio say 24-year-old Tevin Biles-Thomas was arrested in Georgia last week after being indicted on murder, manslaughter and other charges in a New Year\u2019s Eve party shooting.\n\nPolice in Cleveland say the shooting happened just before the end of 2018 when a group of men arrived uninvited to a party.\n\nThree men were killed when gunfire broke out during a fight and two others were wounded.\n\nSOCCER\n\nFlashed on big screens and projected onto landmarks worldwide, the 2022 Qatar World Cup logo was revealed Tuesday with a design that reflects both the tournament\u2019s compact infrastructure and winter schedule.\n\nUsing the colors of the Qatari flag, the white emblem is set against a maroon background and it finally provides an image for soccer\u2019s most controversial tournament beyond construction sites.\n\nIt was inspired by the contours of the World Cup trophy with the unbroken loop depicting a figure of eight - the number of stadiums built for the Middle East\u2019s first World Cup in the tiny Persian Gulf nation.\n\nFIFA said the design also draws \u201cinspiration from a traditional woolen shawl,\u201d a winter garment reflecting the World Cup being played in November and December 2022 to avoid the fierce summer heat in June and July when the tournament is usually played.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "BASKETBALL", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": ""}
