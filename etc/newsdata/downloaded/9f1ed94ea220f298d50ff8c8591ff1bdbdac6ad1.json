No matter what.\"\n\nThe pair have also been sharing loved-up photos and videos on their Instagram Stories.\n\nIt is unclear when the couple started dating, but on 14 October Chad commented on one of Carlla's Instagram photos: \"Was wondering if I could get your number darling? Or do you got a man?\"\n\nTo which she responded: \"I do have a man, kinda looks like you actually.\"\n\nSpeaking to Channel24, Chad's management team confirmed the romance, saying: Carlla is a lovely and friendly girl. She studies art and supports Chad in all his endeavours. His current relationship does not affect his relationship with Kelly, nor does it affect her relationship with him.\"\n\nLast week Kelly tweeted: \"Just saw someone I used to know and heart..... what do I do?\"\n\nThe tweet led many to believe that she ran into her ex-boyfriend, Chad.\n\nEarlier this year the pair reportedly got engaged, after getting matching tattoos on their ring fingers, but six months into the relationship called it quits.", "description": "Chad da Don has moved on from ex-girlfriend Kelly Khumalo with model Carlla Poggenpoel.", "authors": ["Graye Morkel"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9537/189c3ea12850478696188644992f5618.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
