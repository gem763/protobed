I\u2019m not particularly tragic. I\u2019m quite a positive person generally speaking, and I enjoy being daft. But the first time anyone saw me was in Control, and I think that\u2019s stayed with people.\u201d\n\nIt is true that it was Riley\u2019s uncanny turn as the suicidal Joy Division frontman Ian Curtis that made him a star, but a similar dark energy has underpinned his roles in the 12 years since. He was the wide-eyed sociopath Pinkie Brown in the 2010 rework of Brighton Rock, an aloof and haunted Mr Darcy in Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, as well as the crown prince of self-destructive moodiness, Jack Kerouac, or at least his fictional alter-ego Sal Paradise, in the 2012 adaptation of On the Road. \u201cI do have a sad-looking face as well,\u201d Riley confesses.\n\nIt\u2019s something of a surprise then that Riley\u2019s most eye-catching role since Control has been as a bumbling, nefarious minion to Angelina Jolie in Disney\u2019s 2014 hit Maleficent. The sequel, Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, is released this week. \u201cI\u2019m really happy to be in something people might actually watch at some point,\u201d Riley deadpans, a mischievous smile exposing a row of messy teeth. Playing Maleficent\u2019s loyal devotee Diaval \u2013 originally a raven called Diablo in Disney\u2019s 1959 animated classic Sleeping Beauty but transformed into a man for the live-action films \u2013 Riley is the franchise\u2019s secret weapon: the manic, grovelling antidote to Jolie\u2019s deliciously vampy haughtiness.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nJolie was instrumental in Riley\u2019s casting \u2013 she and former husband Brad Pitt were reportedly huge fans of his work in Control \u2013 though Riley explains that it still takes him by surprise when he finds himself on set, being silly alongside one of Hollywood\u2019s biggest names as she cackles beneath two enormous horns. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I was particularly Disney material,\u201d he says. And despite Jolie always introducing herself to co-workers as \u201cAngie\u201d, Riley still refers to her as \u201cAngelina\u201d in conversation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably the northerner in me,\u201d he says, before breaking into a cartoonishly shrill version of his Yorkshire accent. \u201cI\u2019m just waiting for someone to go: \u2018Ooh, is it Anjehh now?\u2019\u201d He says that of all the famous people he has worked with, Jolie is the one his friends and family are most fascinated by. \u201cThat\u2019s mega-stardom, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

A sergeant is sent to a remote island in order to investigate the case of a missing girl. The twist: The girl was never missing \u2013 it was just an elaborate hoax to lure an out-of-towner so the island's residents could sacrifice him to their Sun God.\n\nBeing part of a blockbuster film, he says, took some getting used to, particularly when it came to decisions about his character. \u201cWith Disney things, a lot of people have to tick off on certain aspects,\u201d he explains. \u201cI\u2019m not in Johnny Depp\u2019s position where [I can say], \u2018I think the raven should be drunk!\u2019 Every look that we tried, and there were hundreds of looks, had to be okayed by hundreds of people.\u201d\n\nIn the first film, he says \u201cthe upper echelons\u201d at Disney were riddled with nerves over the scene in which Maleficent turns Diaval from a raven into a man, and whether the scene called for nudity. \u201cHow naked can you have a man in a Disney film?\u201d Riley remembers asking. In the end, he was supplied with a plastic breastplate, complete with six-pack, and some strategically placed mud to cover his modesty for the scene in question. \u201cIt was the best I\u2019d ever looked,\u201d he jokes. For the sequel, he was \u201cthrilled\u201d to remain fully clothed. \u201cI even did up all the buttons on my shirt this time.\u201d\n\nMaleficent: Mistress of Evil is a looser and more sprawling fantasy epic in comparison to its predecessor, with a plot that strands many of the first film\u2019s cast in separate adventures. Aurora (Elle Fanning) is engaged to be married to Prince Philip (Harris Dickinson); the shifty Queen Ingrith (franchise newcomer Michelle Pfeiffer, every bit Jolie\u2019s camp equal) is plotting a coup; while Maleficent is off delving into her ancestry, encountering a possible link to her past in the form of a warrior played by Chiwetel Ejiofor. Diaval has less to do than before, but Riley doesn\u2019t seem too bothered. \u201cThere\u2019s so many times when you put all the work in and nobody cares, or nobody sees it and it disappears,\u201d he explains. \u201cAfter the experiences I\u2019ve had in this business, I sort of limit my expectations.\u201d\n\nRiley trained at the National Youth Theatre as a teenager, but was pulled towards music as he reached his twenties. He says today, however, that his musical aspirations produced \u201climited success\u201d. 10,000 Things, the band he once fronted, were signed to Polydor in 2003 and were a riotous footnote to the \u201cindie landfill\u201d era, The Guardian declaring their only album \u201can overproduced and overlong mess\u201d. After they were dropped by the label, he returned to acting, making a living from a series of odd jobs until he attended an open audition for Control. He would meet his future wife, the actor Alexandra Maria Lara (who played Curtis\u2019s Belgian lover, journalist Annik Honor\u00e9), while working on it, and seemed set for major stardom.\n\nAssisted by a number of accolades for his performance, including a Bafta nomination, he was declared one of the major \u201cnext big things\u201d in UK acting. What followed was a somewhat standard publicity cycle: the modelling contract with Burberry, a few American star vehicles, the rumours that he was going to succeed Daniel Craig as James Bond. But then it all seemed to stagnate.\n\nOutside of his work with the acclaimed British filmmaker Ben Wheatley, including the action thriller Free Fire and the forthcoming Netflix adaptation of Daphne du Maurier\u2019s Rebecca, Riley has often wound up in projects that fared poorly with critics and audiences \u2013 the little-seen BBC spy drama SS-GB, the maligned Marie Curie biopic Radioactive, the latter-day Harvey Weinstein flop Suite Fran\u00e7aise. The Maleficent franchise is probably one of the few projects a large number of people would have seen him in since Control.\n\nRiley is open about the fact that his career took a turn away from what many expected it to be, and quick to be self-deprecating. \u201cI think it was mutual on the part of the film industry and me, a slight reticence and suspicion,\u201d he confides. \u201cThe closer I ever got to being famous, the more I was a bit panicked by it and pulled away from it.\u201d\n\nIt began early. 13, a 2010 action thriller that should have been his big American debut, took years to see the light of day. Riley only discovered it was out in the world when he was visiting his parents back home in Yorkshire and a man carrying a basket of knock-off DVDs offered to sell him a copy of it. \u201cI bought it, obviously, and watched my big American breakthrough on a pirate DVD,\u201d Riley cracks. He still owns it.\n\nEven while filming On the Road in 2010, alongside the likes of Kristen Stewart and Amy Adams, Riley felt out of place. He remembers a friend of Jack Kerouac visiting the set and embracing his co-star Garrett Hedlund with open arms, crying \u201cOh my god, he\u2019s Neal Cassady personified!\u201d, only to react with vague horror when he learnt that Kerouac was being played by, in his words, an \u201cawful tall\u201d Brit. The film\u2019s director, Walter Salles, was in earshot at the time. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if that panicked him slightly,\u201d Riley says.\n\nHe\u2019s not bitter, however. He\u2019s been based in Berlin, where Lara grew up, since Control, the pair raising their five-year-old son and taking turns working on film sets and taking care of the home.\n\n\u201cWe want to have a life with each other,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe most important thing to the two of us is that we are at home as much as we can be, and with our boy.\u201d\n\nAnd if Ian Curtis is the one thing he is ever remembered for, he\u2019s fine with it. \u201cWhen me and my wife were in Cannes [in 2007], we were looking down from the roof of the cinema and people were queuing around the block,\u201d he remembers. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t really getting a single bad write-up, and I wasn\u2019t [either]. There are actors who go their whole careers without a moment like that. Great actors. I\u2019m thrilled that I had Control, and whether that could ever be reached again \u2013 it\u2019s unlikely, isn\u2019t it? You\u2019re only gonna get a role like that maybe two or three times in a career if you\u2019re lucky. I just want to be an actor that works\u2026 who can keep getting away with it.\u201d\n\nMaleficent: Mistress of Evil is in UK cinemas on Friday", "description": "Sam Riley is sitting in the one corner of an otherwise sunny hotel suite that the light hasn\u2019t been able to reach. \u201cI managed to find my way into the shadows!\u201d the 39-year-old says in a soft Yorkshire timbre, nodding to his on-screen affinity for the dark and the tortured. \u201cMy grandfather never understood why I wasn\u2019t doing comedies. I\u2019m not particularly tragic.
