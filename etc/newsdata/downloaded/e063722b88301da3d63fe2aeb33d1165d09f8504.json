The company that manages the arena, AEG, then reportedly passed those costs onto Trump\u2019s campaign, which has now threatened legal action if it\u2019s not assured by Tuesday that the arena would be available for the rally later in the week.\n\nREAD: This Democrat went to a MAGA rally to try to understand Trump supporters\n\nThe Trump campaign also slammed Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat, saying he was using the rally to boost his profile.\n\n\u201cThis is an outrageous abuse of power by a liberal mayor trying to deny the rights of his own city\u2019s residents just because he hates the President,\u201d Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said in a statement. \u201cPeople want to hear from their President, and no mayor looking to beef up his resume for a run for higher office should stand in the way.\u201d\n\nFrey has been a critic of Trump and, when it was announced that Trump would hold a rally in the city, said the president\u2019s \u201cmessage of hatred will never be welcome in Minneapolis.\u201d\n\nFrey got into a spat with Trump on Twitter on Tuesday, after the president said the \u201clightweight mayor is hurting the great police and other wonderful supporters.\u201d\n\n\u201cYawn... Welcome to Minneapolis where we pay our bills, we govern with integrity, and we love all of our neighbors,\u201d wrote Frey in response.\n\nThe Trump campaign has come under fire for not paying its costs in the past. A report from The Center for Public Integrity in June revealed that Trump\u2019s campaign owed city governments at least $841,219 in unpaid bills for public-safety related expenses.\n\nThere\u2019s no legal obligation for campaigns to cover the costs that cities incur during rallies, but they are allowed to use campaign funds to do so. Minneapolis City Attorney Susan Segal told the Star Tribune that \u201cit\u2019s not fair\u201d for residents to have to cover security costs at events.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who the candidate is or what the event is, if it\u2019s anticipated that there will be a need for additional response \u2026 a source of revenue for that needs to be found,\u201d she told the paper.\n\nCover: President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally at U.S. Bank Arena, Thursday, Aug. 1, 2019, in Cincinnati.
