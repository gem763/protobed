Describe Hansen in one word and it must be \u201ccomposed\u201d. It was not always this way. Quite the opposite, in fact.\n\nThese days, as his last stand approaches in Japan, Hansen is almost unflappable, having near-defined the art of calming influence. Such a feat is no easy task while guiding the world\u2019s most demanding, glory-hungry, panicked rugby nation.\n\nEngland\u2019s Joe Cokanasiga admits nerves when facing Wales and Wallabies Read more\n\nThree weeks ago in Perth, two games out from their World Cup opener, the All Blacks conceded the most points in their history in the record 47-26 defeat to the Wallabies, a team with little prior form. Never mind the circumstances of New Zealand playing the second half with 14 men after Scott Barrett\u2019s red card, the loss sent tremors through New Zealand as if Mount Ruapehu was erupting again.\n\nAllow these impassioned kneejerk reactions to infiltrate the team, and the collapse of the three-times world champions would be a weekly occurrence. Hansen instead fronted up with his typical \u201cwe\u2019ve got this\u201d attitude and the All Blacks righted their wrong the following week with an order-restoring 36-0 demolition of Australia at Eden Park. World Cup fears allayed, for the moment at least.\n\nHansen does not get it right every time, but more often than not he has come to represent a mood\u2011soothing presence.\n\nWayne Smith, the former All Blacks and Northampton coach and a longtime confidant whose rugby relationship with Hansen dates back to the early 1980s in Canterbury, recognises this serenity. \u201cHe\u2019s been a steady hand on the ship, so when things like Perth have occurred he\u2019s stopped any form of panic going through,\u201d Smith, dubbed the Professor for his deep-rooted knowledge of the game, says.\n\n\u201cOne of his greatest attributes has been to calm the public down; to say: \u2018Yeah we weren\u2019t that good, we understand that, but we\u2019re going to be way better next week.\u2019 You need to understand how the All Blacks work and how their minds work. There\u2019s so much pride and love for the jersey in that group that they\u2019re always going to bounce back from a poor result. He emits that attitude in everything he says and does so he takes a lot of stress away for people.\u201d\n\nHansen\u2019s win ratio as head coach since 2012 sits at near 89% \u2013 nine losses in 100 Tests \u2013 safely placing him among the pantheon of elite sporting, not merely rugby, mentors. Four years ago he made history by steering the All Blacks to their first retention of the World Cup with victory over Australia in the final at Twickenham. Now he seeks a third successive crown in Japan.\n\nThough the end is nigh, Hansen is reticent to make his final campaign anything like the last gunfight at the OK Corral. Talk of past deeds distracts from present quests, and so any such murmurings are deemed unhelpful to the team-first, task\u2011focused mantra the All Blacks strive to live every day.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Steve Hansen and captain Richie McCaw with the Webb Ellis Cup at Twickenham in 2015.

To appreciate his coaching evolution we must track back 15 years to his time as All Blacks assistant coach alongside Smith and the then head coach Graham Henry. That trio eventually secured reappointment against all odds despite the disastrous 2007 World Cup quarter-final defeat to France in Cardiff, to push through and deliver New Zealand\u2019s first Webb Ellis Cup for 24 years.\n\nMuch controversy and angst, however, was endured in between. Three grand slam triumphs (2005, 2008, 2010) and the comprehensive sweep of the British & Irish Lions typified dominance that also included Tri Nations and Bledisloe Cup conquests. Yet the crowded trophy cabinet did little to alter ingrained World Cup resentment.\n\nAs Smith explains, only victory over Marc Li\u00e8vremont\u2019s erratic French at Eden Park brought the trio any form of real recognition. \u201cBecause we hadn\u2019t won a World Cup we were still seen, not as failures, but there was a lot of negativity around us.\n\n\u201cAt the end of that World Cup in 2011 we\u2019d won 89 games from 103 but it was only really that last game \u2013 even though it was an 8-7 win \u2013 that validated what we were doing publicly,\u201d Smith says. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to look back now and say: \u2018Jeez, it\u2019s been a good era and it\u2019s still going,\u2019 but it was built on the back of some pretty tough times.\u201d\n\nDuring this period, before his promotion to head coach, Hansen overhauled his persona and the confrontational demeanour that too often put him at odds with the media and public. Only after a concerted effort to transform elements of his gruff exterior into the unflustered dry humour and quick wit now regularly witnessed, did he evolve into the coach we can see today.\n\n\u201cI admired his growth in that time,\u201d Smith says. \u201cInitially his public profile was quite poor. Through that time he came to recognise a couple of weaknesses he had and set about making them strengths, and I think that says a lot about him. He realised he wasn\u2019t complete.\n\n\u201cEvery year he got slightly better and that\u2019s what you call a growth mindset. He could have stayed how he was and done reasonably well but never reached the heights he\u2019s reached. He\u2019s worked on himself more than anyone I know. He\u2019s really searched to improve.\u201d\n\nThe Hansen you get in public now is largely the one you get behind the scenes too. He is tough, opinionated, never afraid to say what he thinks, but also empathetic. Assistant coaches and senior players wanting to alter his view must be prepared to battle for it by presenting convincing, compelling cases.\n\nPaddleboarding and luxury: Miyazaki is Jones\u2019s special place for final preparation | Gerard Meagher Read more\n\nThrough the seasons Hansen has softened, somewhat, with more room for negotiation and discussion than when he first assumed the reins and used his inside knowledge and experience to drive firm ideas about what he felt needed to change. No one survives by being solely strong-minded. Hansen has gained respect because those around him know intent comes from the right place.\n\nIn this regard he cares deeply for the All Blacks jersey, its legacy and the players, to the point that he often refers to the team as a family. In navigating international rugby, particularly in the southern hemisphere landscape which requires relentless travel, the All Blacks spend half the year together, riding peaks and the odd trough.\n\nHansen has strived to foster environments where spats are fought but the team remains tight. Where it is OK to make mistakes, so long as you learn from them. Verbal smacks are handed out but they are for the sole purpose of improvement.\n\nLeading nations never stop chasing, which has forced Hansen to adapt and adjust. Not just to rush defences, either. As new players emerge, the age gap grows, and Hansen has needed to change the way he communicates, teaches and learns. This creates both comfortable and uncomfortable moments. In his time, Hansen has seen it all. In his final days as New Zealand coach, in what is likely to be the most open World Cup to date, his calming presence will be needed more than ever.", "description": "New Zealand coach Steve Hansen has reinvented himself in his eight years in charge, going from confrontational figure to oasis of calm", "authors": ["Liam Napier"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78f6276a50ad93d68f5c732d2d0a2b7952ea278f/0_271_4603_2763/master/4603.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=27407cb12dc2d1f837a5d93fabc580c0", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
