Grace Meng of Queens, N.Y., introduced a bill to make feminine hygiene projects \u201cmore accessible and affordable.\u201d But there still isn\u2019t nationwide tampon justice, and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Juli\u00e1n Castro took the opportunity of #NationalPeriodDay to argue against the tampon tax, saying that some have to choose between going to school or work and paying for menstrual products.\n\nEvery day, people are forced to choose between going to school or work, or staying home because they can\u2019t afford the menstrual products they need. Pads, tampons and cups should be available tax-free, across the nation.#NationalPeriodDay https://t.co/orIDdz1lPD \u2014 Juli\u00e1n Castro (@JulianCastro) October 19, 2019\n\nWe\u2019re kind of amused by Democrats suddenly finding a tax they don\u2019t like. And seriously, they\u2019re not even talking about making the products free \u2014 they\u2019re talking about eliminating the sales tax, which adds maybe 10 percent at most to the cost.\n\nAnd we really want to know who can\u2019t afford school because of the sales tax on menstrual products.\n\nYou know before this day we women didn\u2019t know what to do! I mean really guys \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44 \u2014 Kaya Jones (@KayaJones) October 19, 2019\n\nI call in sick often & just bleed out all over my house because I can\u2019t afford tampons for a week every month. Lunatic left. \u2014 Maga Believer 2020 (@MagaBeliever20) October 19, 2019\n\nEvery day, people are forced to choose between going to school or work, or staying home because they can\u2019t afford the toilet paper they need. Toilet paper should be available tax-free, across the nation. \u2014 No Left Turn \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@NoLeftTurn1) October 19, 2019\n\nNo they're not. Nobody is staying home because of a 6-8% sales tax on period products. But if Massengill delivered Gift Packs, I'd send you one. \u2014 Tom (@BoreGuru) October 19, 2019\n\nwhat people? \u2014 Sherry Kirkpatrick (@Sherrytree62) October 19, 2019\n\nSo they can afford the $12.78 for maxipads, but if they tacked on $1.13 in tax they couldn't afford it? I'm all for none of these products being taxed, but let's stop the nonsense that a dollar in tax is keeping someone from going to work. \u2014 Brad \ud83c\udfa9 Zingas (@brahzinga) October 19, 2019\n\nAnd if a dollar tax on maxi-pads is keeping women home from work, here\u2019s a crazy idea \u2014 lowering income tax across the board so everyone has more disposable income to spend on such items.\n\nare you high? seriously even you can't be this stupid. \u2014 (-) (@willsie1sw) October 19, 2019\n\nWhat a load of crap. \u2014 Edie Emu (@PrettymanAlicia) October 19, 2019\n\nThis is probably one of the stupidest things I have ever heard. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 \u2014 Mary Jack (@MaryJack4) October 19, 2019\n\nThat should save you a couple bucks. \u2014 American (@ovalheaded) October 19, 2019\n\nI have 2 words for you weirdos. PERSONAL. RESPONSIBILITY. I just don\u2019t know how woman have survived hundreds of years with periods without you guys and your hashtags\u2026 \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44 \u2014 Jackie \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83e\udd42 (@JackieBeFit) October 19, 2019\n\nThat's nonsense. You are just a liar pandering for votes. \u2014 Jriden2002 (@jriden2002) October 19, 2019\n\nNice to see you\u2019re anti tax for once. \u2014 vmadson (@vmadson810) October 19, 2019\n\nYou are the ultimate panderer. \ud83e\udd2e \u2014 Tikka4 (@Tikka41) October 19, 2019\n\nSeriously Julian Don\u2019t do this. \u2014 Erica Locke (@LockenessNyad) October 19, 2019\n\nYou are so embarrassing, so is this entire progressive movement. We do not need everything thrusted into politics. Gross #NationalPeriodDay \u2014 Kaye (@Liberty4Life73) October 19, 2019\n\nDude\u2026its obvious your campaign is circling the drain. You're reduced to advocating for feminine hygiene products??? Sad.#malefeminist#Trump2020 #KAG \u2014 Yaardie65 (@yaardie65) October 19, 2019\n\nPads and tampons. This is your democrat party. pic.twitter.com/ND2kdwNMTi \u2014 abstractjwl (@abstractjwl) October 19, 2019\n\nSpeaking of pandering, did you catch it? Castro did score some extra props from liberals for using gender-inclusive language in his tweet; notice he said \u201cpeople\u201d are forced to choose, not \u201cwomen\u201d are forced to choose.\n\nIt\u2019s okay to say women, you grubby panderweasel. \u2014 Maya Apugelou (@MayaApugelou) October 19, 2019\n\nUmmm\u2026.people? Pretty sure only women menstruate. \u2014 Babs (@Babs41704111) October 19, 2019\n\nPeople in general or women people? Cause men don\u2019t, you know, menstruate. \u2014 Laura (@NonsenseEnd) October 19, 2019\n\nDo you mean those who are born biologically female? We call those people women. \u2014 Piedmont Tilly (@Oscarthedodle) October 19, 2019\n\nSay it: women. Go ahead. Your handful of supporters won't care. \u2014 John Stephen Walsh (@jswriter65) October 19, 2019\n\nPeople? Do men have periods? Love how these Dems have to pander to their insane base. \u2014 Chris Sutton (@a_zchris) October 19, 2019\n\nWe always love to see someone who thinks they\u2019re woke being corrected for not being a woke as they think they are:\n\nDear ALL MEN, STOP. JUST STOP! You don't get a period, you dont get cramps, you dont worry about how Expensive feminine hygiene products are, and you certainly can NEVER understand a woman's body! Sincerely,\n\nA Woman. \ud83d\udeba\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udc96#NationalPeriodDay #AWomansBodyAWomansChoice \u2014 That's Cute (@iriskiss) October 19, 2019\n\nActually, some men do get periods. Trans men exist. Tmi I'm on my period and I'm not a woman \u2014 \ud83d\udc7b WubBOO \ud83d\udc7b (@Wubbito) October 19, 2019\n\nFor the record, Beto O\u2019Rourke is on the case too with his Menstrual Equity Act, but he did NOT use gender-inclusive language in his tweet; that\u2019s gonna cost him:\n\nIn detention centers and in prisons, in big cities and small towns, women across America don\u2019t have access to the period products they need. On #NationalPeriodDay, men need to join women in demanding real change\u2014which is why I\u2019m supporting the Menstrual Equity Act. \u2014 Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) October 19, 2019\n\nRelated:", "description": "So there are really women staying home from work because they can't afford the sales tax on tampons?", "authors": ["Brett T.", "Posted At Pm On October"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/julian-castro-ap.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
