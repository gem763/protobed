A divided Fed lowered its benchmark interest rate by another quarter percentage point to a range of 1.75% to 2% in an effort to stave off a possible recession triggered by a global economic slowdown and the U.S. trade war with China.\n\nBut don't expect the Fed to respond to President Donald Trump's latest tweet that suggested the \"Fed should get our interest rates down to zero, or less.\"\n\nNot going to happen next week \u2013 or maybe even next year if the economy doesn't tank.\n\n\"I expect the Fed to lower the fed funds rate range by 25 basis points on Wednesday,\" said Robert A. Dye, chief economist at Comerica Bank, before the decision was announced.\n\nThe move takes the radown from the 2% to 2.25% range. The Fed launched its latest round of rate cuts back in late July with a quarter-point cut. July's move was the first rate cut since December 2008.\n\nImpact of Fed's rate cut: How would it affect credit card, home equity line, savings rates?\n\nAnother cut?: Fed looks ready to lower interest rates again with the economy facing risks\n\n\"Global economic indicators are looking cooler, and I believe that the Fed will continue with its 'risk management' approach through next year,\" Dye said.\n\nSo further rate cuts could be ahead, as well.\n\nDye's forecast includes another 25 basis-point cut after the Fed two-day policy meeting Dec. 10-11 and another quarter-point cut in June 2020.\n\nAfter four rate cuts, short-term rates could be down to a range of 1.25% to 1.5% \u2013 down a full percentage point from earlier in 2019.\n\nNo one has a precise crystal ball for the timing \u2013 or the actual rate cuts for that matter \u2013 given that the Fed will be heavily influenced by the overall health of the U.S. economy, as well as any slowdown overseas.\n\nFor consumers, the Fed's next rate cut would mean a slight break on the cost of borrowing on credit cards and other loans.\n\nBut savers are going to be making even less interest on money they're keeping at the bank.\n\nHere's a look at how to get a bit more for your money:\n\nBetter rates aren't always found in branches\n\nIf you want to make more money on your money, you're likely going to have to move some money around to another bank.\n\nAnd you must realize that even the best rates aren't as good as they were earlier this year.\n\nRates on some high-yielding savings accounts had been as high as 2.25% just a few months ago. But those rates have been coming down as banks began anticipating a round of rate cuts by the Fed.\n\nIn early September, online savings accounts were promoting an annual percentage yield of around 2% or higher \u2013 including Marcus by Goldman Sachs (2% with no minimum deposit), Ally Bank (1.9% with no minimum deposit) and Citibank's Citi Accelerate Savings account (2.21%, available in select markets, including Michigan, with no minimum starting balance but a $500 minimum monthly balance is required to avoid a monthly service fee).\n\n\"Many are available with no minimum deposit, or with very modest minimum deposits,\" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for Bankrate.com.\n\nPay attention to the rules and fees, as well as any fine print.\n\nThe Marcus by Goldman Sachs High-Yield Online savings account has an APY of 2% and there is no minimum deposit to open the account and no fees. But if the account is opened but there is no deposit made within 60 days of opening the account, Marcus by Goldman Sachs may close the account.\n\nAnd don't try to use an online savings account as a pseudo-checking account.\n\nFederal law limits certain types of telephone and electronic transfers and withdrawals from online savings accounts to six per statement cycle, according to Ally Bank.\n\nSo you need to keep a careful watch on how many withdrawals you could be making from an online savings account. Ally Bank, for example, charges $10 per excessive transaction.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Savers are looking at lower rates, too, as experts forecast another Fed rate cut in September, and possibly in December.", "authors": ["Susan Tompor", "Detroit Free Press"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4yXP1ZwpUPioi6ntmuGfEg--~B/aD01NDA7dz05NjA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://d.yimg.com/hd/cp-video-transcode/1009217/55044186-d694-405b-9b52-6182aa7a5d79/d4f90f56-9015-50c7-974b-aca449ead962/data_3_0.jpg?s=d6601ba957a3350b85f48df2a713f20e&c=cdacc41d3b63831d7d84e24c2b47820e&a=tripleplay4us&mr=0", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
