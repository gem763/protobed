That has dragged on the economy as a whole, which shrank in the second quarter.\n\nEconomists expect another slight economic contraction in the July-September period.\n\nUncertainties linked to Britain\u2019s planned departure from the European Union and global trade disputes are starting to hurt Germany\u2019s labor market, which has been the backbone of a consumption-driven growth cycle as exports weaken.\n\n\u201cGiven that industrial output provides us with a deep look into the economic development in the third quarter, one could entertain the idea that the German economy will just about avoid a recession,\u201d Thomas Gitzel of VP Bank wrote in a note\n\nJuly\u2019s output reading was revised up to a fall of 0.4% from a previously reported drop of 0.6%.", "description": "German industrial output rose unexpectedly in August, data showed, suggesting Europe's largest economy may yet skirt recession.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438334421&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF970BY", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
