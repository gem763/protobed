His total for the third quarter of the year reflected that.\n\nSeveral of his opponents released their third quarter totals earlier this week. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has a strong small-dollar fund-raising base, pulled in $25.3 million, his campaign said Tuesday, while Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., reported $19.1 million raised during the last three months.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Us Politics"], "top_image": ""}
