We know some people will ask questions like: \u2018Why do we only begin to be hard on employers when it is a time of crisis?\u2019 The reason that we focus on employment equity is because we need to address the inequality that is deeply rooted. All statistics show that, as South Africa, we are doing very badly,\u201d he said.\n\nMildred Oliphant, Nxesi\u2019s predecessor, voiced the same frustrations and promised tougher action every time she presented this report.\n\nLast year, she stated that it was \u201cdisturbing to note that there are still designated employers who would rather budget for fines and penalties than embrace transformation in the world of work\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhat they forget is that there is a price to pay for not heeding the call for transformation; the call to address inequality in whatever form it presents itself. Ladies and gentlemen, inequality carries high economic, social and moral costs. Inequality is capable of undermining economic growth and social cohesion, inflating healthcare costs and driving up crime.\u201d\n\nThe Black Management Forum (BMF) is setting up a legal fund that will be used for litigation to ensure that companies comply with employment equity targets.\n\nAccording to the BMF, this fund will tackle companies that are guilty of \u201cgross violations, derailing transformation in South Africa\u201d.\n\nThe use of the term \u2018gross violation\u2019 may seem a little strong, but it is apt.\n\nThe appalling figures released last week show that the majority of employers, who happen to be white men, do not see employment equity as an imperative.\n\nIn the minds of many business owners, employment equity is rather an irritating requirement imposed on them by government.\n\nSome even see it as reverse apartheid.\n\nThey would rather tick the boxes than enthusiastically embrace the transformation project. They naively and wrongly do not see the business case for it.\n\nThis despite business organisations vowing to do more to make sure that employment equity moves beyond compliance and encouraging businesses to see the economic value of making their workplaces diverse.\n\nReacting to the 2017 report, then Business Unity SA chief executive officer Tanya Cohen stated that, \u201cunless we take meaningful steps so that our workforce reflects the broad demographics of our society at every level, we will miss the opportunity to leverage the full human resource potential that South Africa has to offer\u201d.\n\nBusiness Leadership SA has made similar noises, all to no avail.\n\nIt is now clear that the destruction of the state, the looting of the public purse and the corrosion of our morality were not the only consequences of the wasted decade.\n\nSouth Africa also pressed the pause button on transformation.\n\nThe man who ran South Africa during that time had little interest in fulfilling the constitutionally mandated task of ensuring transformation.\n\nDuring that time, the likes of Oliphant and the Commission for Employment Equity could scream until they were blue in the face, but employers did not give a hoot.\n\nThey just did not take the authorities seriously.\n\nOther players in society were also distracted by the fight against corruption and state capture, and ended up taking their eyes off the transformation ball.\n\nWe have to get this vehicle back on the road.\n\nWhatever efforts we put into rebooting the economy must be accompanied by an energised drive to make sure that the workplace is transformed.\n\nOtherwise, we\u2019ll find ourselves reading the same speeches and moaning about the same thing 25 years from now.", "description": "Like the death toll over holidays, gender-based violence and Friday-night stabbings at shebeens, the failure to move the needle on employment equity has become that frustratingly stubborn issue.", "authors": ["Mondli Makhanya"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8058/23d69e8d9bfd4054baf2db62170969f9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-02"}
