We're delighted that Sian and Amy are now officially permanent members of the abbey choir.", "description": "An historic Abbey has broken with its 200 year old tradition and has decided to admit women for the first time.", "authors": ["Gabriella Swerling", "Social", "Religious Affairs Editor", "Con Coughlin"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/11/TELEMMGLPICT000212730560-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqyuLFFzXshuGqnr8zPdDWXiTUh73-1IAIBaONvUINpkg.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
