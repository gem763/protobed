Yes, the popular DC Comics hero once played by Ryan Reynolds and forever on the \u201cmaybe\u201d list of upcoming DC movies.\n\nIt\u2019s being produced by Greg Berlanti and, as far as we know, has no bearing on Green Lantern Corps, the maybe-still-in-development movie announced at San Diego Comic-Con several years ago.\n\nBerlanti is also working on Strange Adventures, \u201ca DC superhero anthology...[that] will feature characters from across the DC canon.\u201d According to an HBO Max press release, the TV show will be a \u201cone-hour drama series [that] will explore close-ended morality tales about the intersecting lives of mortals and superhumans.\u201d\n\nStrange Adventures is also the title of a highly-anticipated new Tom King comic, which we learned more about at the recent New York City Comic Con; it will feature Adam Strange as well as other DC notables grappling with multiple realities.\n\n\u201cBoth of these original DC properties we\u2019ll be creating for HBO Max will be unlike anything seen on television,\u201d Berlanti said in a press release. \u201cAn anthology series of cautionary tales set in a world where superpowers exist, and, in what promises to be our biggest DC show ever made, we will be going to space with a Green Lantern television series, but I can\u2019t reveal any more about that just yet.\u201d\n\nSo, there\u2019s no word on which Green Lantern this show will focus on. The main story, of course, is of Earthling Hal Jordan who comes upon a magic ring that makes him a part of an intergalactic police force sworn to protect the galaxy. But other humans have taken on the mantle\u2014notably John Stewart\u2014as well as all kinds of aliens from every corner of space.\n\nThey could even choose to introduce one of the latest Green Lanterns from the comics. This show could go any number of ways. And potentially be very expensive.\n\nAiring this series on HBO Max adds a new wrinkle to the live-action DC universe. On the big screen at least, that direction had been in flux for some time. However, after Aquaman, Shazam, and with the upcoming Wonder Woman 1984, the now in pre-production Batman movie as well James Gunn\u2019s Suicide Squad, things seem to be taking a turn.\n\nNot to mention the unrelated, but sure to change things Joker as well as the massive live-action TV universe on the so-far separate DC Universe streaming service.\n\nGreen Lantern seems like something that could, if it wants to, tie into any of that, or live completely on its own. We\u2019ll have to wait and find out. There's currently no word on HBO Max's status in Australia.", "description": "HBO Max just put on a fancy ring and created some shows no one was expecting....", "authors": ["Germain Lussier", "Tegan Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/onv6bddmajlzlitt5q3y.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
