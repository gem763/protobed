How different is today\u2019s capital?\n\n\u201cThe parish is essentially sober but very immoral,\u201d the Reverend H Bloomer told one of social reformer Charles Booth\u2019s researchers at the end of the 19th century. He claimed to have been personally responsible for closing 20 brothels, though four to his knowledge remained.\n\nIt\u2019s not very shocking that my neighbourhood in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s North Islington constituency was a den of vice in late Victorian times. After all, Hornsey Road was formerly known as the Devil\u2019s Lane and frequented by highwaymen. The superb Hornsey Road blog once attempted to exorcise my manor\u2019s diabolical reputation with the ironic tag line \u201cprobably not over a hell mouth\u201d.\n\nBut maybe it is. Peter Ackroyd in London: The Biography argued that neighbourhoods retained their venerable spirits. \u201c[T]here are areas of London where time seems to have come to an end,\u201d he wrote, \u201cor ceaselessly to repeat itself.\u201d St Giles was a case in point: the impoverished district near Covent Garden inspired Hogarth\u2019s Gin Lane, and 250 years later Ackroyd found striking similarities in the 21st-century rough sleepers in its churchyard.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A den of vice in the late Victorian era ... part of Hornsey road today.

He and his team of researchers walked every street in London, filling 450 notebooks with their finds and producing 60 maps, hand-coloured to indicate the level of poverty. Now those maps and edited highlights from their reports are being republished with input from researchers at the London School of Economics. The LSE has an online facility to compare then with the current situation, with modern underlay maps beneath Booth\u2019s poverty maps.\n\n\u201cSurely this is the right moment,\u201d argues Iain Sinclair in the book\u2019s foreword, \u201cwhen divisions between the visibly wretched and the invisibly rich in corporate, de-localised London are becoming critical, to publish a handsome, reconfigured presentation of Charles Booth\u2019s inspirational reckoning?\u201d\n\nPoverty is no longer quite so prevalent as in Booth\u2019s day: Booth concluded that 35% of Londoners lived in poverty at the end of the 19th century, and the Trust for London\u2019s latest figures indicate that 27% do so today. But compare that with a national average of 21% and it\u2019s clear there is a problem.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest South Hornsey \u2013 see image above for colour key.

The map indicates a huge workhouse on Cornwallis Road; like so many other smithies and factories, it\u2019s long gone, and the site is now an adventure playground and park.\n\nBut in November 1897, one of Booth\u2019s researchers, George H Duckworth \u2013 who was not only an Etonian, a Cambridge cricket blue but also Virginia Woolf\u2019s half-brother \u2013 strolled up Hornsey Road with Insp William Dyball, describing it as \u201ca road of small shops that depend for their existence on local knowledge: they give credit which the large houses on Holloway Rd and 7 Sisters Rd will not do\u201d. That sounds about right: even today, chain stores are rare and buying products \u201con tick\u201d is possible, as long as the proprietors know you.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The cat\u2019s meat man pushed his barrow around East End streets selling cheap meat to families as pet food. Often horsemeat, it was sometimes even too rotten for pets.

Some comfortable, others poor.\u201d My cul de sac, running parallel to Hornsey Road, still fits that description. We\u2019ve got all sorts down here \u2013 Poles, Afghans, Pakistanis, City traders, tube train drivers, Nigerians, Cypriots, Muslims worshipping at the mosque round the corner, non-Muslims worshipping at the William Hill next door, council tenants, a declining number of people of Irish descent, Hooray Henry private tenants. Not to mention people like me who bought cheaply these modest late Victorian ex-council houses after Margaret Thatcher\u2019s right-to-buy legislation and are now sitting on nest eggs that scramble the property market so as to exclude younger people.\n\nBeyond my garden fence, there was once a street of grander houses coloured red for \u201cMiddle class, well to do\u201d. The Luftwaffe did for them as they did for many of the homes in Booth\u2019s map. Today Tollington Place\u2019s bomb site is Wray Crescent Open Space, with cricket pitch, playground, and community-maintained raised beds. Let\u2019s not overstate the bucolic makeover, however: the leafy corners have long proved handy for drug deals.\n\nNot far away from Tollington Place on Booth\u2019s map is a street that sticks out like a sore thumb, since it is coloured black, signifying as Booth put it: \u201cLower class. Vicious, semi-criminal\u201d. That was Campbell Road, aka the Bunk, which from the 1860s until it was cleared as a slum in the 1950s was known as the worst street in London. Nearby, next to Hornsey Road Baths are two streets coloured light blue, defined as: \u201cPoor. 18s to 21s a week for a moderate family.\u201d On the other side of Hornsey Road are two streets coloured dark blue, defined as: \u201cVery poor, casual. Chronic want.\u201d\n\nThese mean streets have been disappeared, but the neighbourhood still retains some of its earlier character. Those light blue streets, Marcellus Road and Orpingley Road, were both demolished in 1972 to make way for the Andover Estate, where Ann Widdecombe once made an exploitation doc about her battle with \u201cthe hoodies\u201d, to which the local youth responded with their own YouTube documentary Beyond the Hoodie.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u201cA \u2018melting-pot\u2019 of London\u201d: Clerkenwell. Photograph: Charles Booth Archive, courtesy of London School of Economics\n\nThe dark blue streets, Denmark Terrace and Ellenborough Road have also gone, replaced by the jewel in my neighbourhood\u2019s social housing crown: Sussex Place, described in Pevsner as \u201can eight-storey crescent in red brick with lower blocks enclosing a garden: an ambitious post-war Islington scheme of 1950 by Monson, spaciously laid out, in startling contrast to the tight street of low stuccoed houses which then existed all around.\u201d It\u2019s as though the council was trying to lift the historic curse.\n\nIn other parts of the city, however, the change to London has been dramatic. I look at Booth\u2019s map of King\u2019s Cross: the black-coloured streets are gone as gentrification sweeps across the formerly desolate railway land behind the station; the then functioning gasometers, Booth would have been astounded to discover, have been repurposed as luxury flats \u2013 \u00a3810,000 for a studio and rising into the many millions for a penthouse, but handy for workers at Google\u2019s London HQ nearby.\n\nSimilarly, Booth\u2019s researchers found Shoreditch to be \u201ca very poor and overcrowded district \u2026 the Jewish quarters particularly poor\u201d. But today Shoreditch is a byword for artist-catalysed gentrification and buy-to-let speculation. Typical of the latter is the Atlas Building, a 302-unit newbuild project that completed in June and where 70% of sales have been investment purchases.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Granary Square, Kings Cross, which is private land today, and the same warehouse c 1850 Composite: Science & Society Picture Library/Teri Pengilley for the Guardian\n\nOne of Booth\u2019s volunteers asked a police constable to describe Clerkenwell, just up the road from Shoreditch. He responded that it was a \u201cmelting pot\u201d of London. Which sounds like a lovely meeting point for migrant communities, prefiguring the cosmopolitan London of the 21st century. Not really: what he meant was that Clerkenwell was \u201cwhere all the stolen silver or jewels come to be melted or disassembled\u201d. It\u2019s less Dickensian and more genteel than that today.\n\nI wander off Seven Sisters Road to find out what happened to the Bunk. Today it is called Whadcoat Street, an anonymous dead end that became briefly notorious a couple of years ago when a terrorist drove into a crowd of Muslim worshippers nearby, killing a man.\n\nBlowing in the wind: why do so many cities have poor east ends? Read more\n\nWhat\u2019s striking about the site of the Bunk today is that it\u2019s caught in a gentrification pincer movement. On one side is a new housing development of 22 private one- and two-bedroom flats called the Cottonworks, claiming to be \u201cclose to Upper Street, one of London\u2019s trendiest neighbourhood\u201d [sic]. (Upper Street isn\u2019t close, not really.)\n\nOn the other is City North, a vast new development around and above Finsbury Park tube, where flats of up to \u00a3850,000 are being advertised overseas, as if the better to attract the speculative investors who have already put much of London\u2019s property beyond its citizens, thus adding to the inequality and poverty in the capital identified by Trust for London.\n\nWhat Booth\u2019s poverty maps ultimately show is a London where rich and poor lived right next door to each other: in that sense, at least, today\u2019s London is no different. While only 47 of City North\u2019s 308 apartments are classed as \u201caffordable\u201d homes under the absurd definition of 80% of market rate, just yards away there has been a rise in rough sleepers under the railway bridge on Stroud Green Road. The Bunk may have gone, but poverty in my neighbourhood \u2013 and London \u2013 certainly hasn\u2019t.\n\n\u2022 Charles Booth\u2019s London Poverty Maps is published on 31 October by Thames and Hudson\n\nFollow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter", "description": "A new edition of Charles Booth\u2019s maps and research shows a London in which grinding poverty and wealth lived side by side.
