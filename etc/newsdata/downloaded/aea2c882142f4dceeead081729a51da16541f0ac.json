Now it is everywhere,' National Park Service historic architect Audrey Tepper, who is leading the cleanup, told the LA Times.\n\nMore than $8.7million has been invested in lasers that methodically burn the memorial's white marble, scraping away black splotches that first drew attention in the mid-2000s.\n\nThe process is tedious - taking an hour to clean two square feet.\n\n'It is almost like cleaning with a toothbrush,' construction manager Keith Ramsay said.\n\nExperts say there's no guarantee that the biofilm won't grow back after the restoration is finished.\n\nThe National Park Service has invested $8.7million in efforts to remove a mysterious black biofilm from the surface of the Jefferson Memorial (pictured)\n\nThe outbreak of biofilm is accelerating its creep across several major monuments in the capital\n\nBiofilm is a broad term for swarms of microorganisms that can take many forms in a many different environments for reasons that remain unclear in the scientific community. Common examples include tooth plaque and slime that coats river rocks.\n\nNASA recently conducted an extensive study into biofilm after it was detected in the wastewater pipes of the International Space Station, threatening to corrode the structure.\n\nBiofilm is also a threat to hospitals, where it is believed to contribute to tens of thousands of patient deaths each year by contaminating medical devices and spawning infection.\n\nGiven its diversity, however, scientists have reason to believe it likely has positive uses too.\n\nBiofilm is a broad term for swarms of microorganisms that can take many forms in a many different environments for reasons that remain unclear in the scientific community. A close up of biofilm on the Jefferson Memorial is seen above\n\nExperts are using lasers to burn the black splotches off the memorial's white marble\n\nThere are a few different theories about the root cause of Washington's outbreak.\n\nResearchers had looked into pollution as a possible culprit, but Tepper noted that the biofilm growth has increased as air quality improved.\n\n'The pollution might have been helping clean it,' she said.\n\nA similar theory speculates that climate change could be at fault, as increasingly intense ultraviolet rays may be promoting growth.\n\nYet another theory suggests that the biofilm has always been there but is becoming more noticeable as the memorial decays.\n\n'Nothing is ruled out,' Judy Jacob, a senior Park Service conservator who investigates biofilm outbreaks in the Northeast, told the LA Times.
