There's a belief that companies are trying to aggregate any privacy lawmaking under one roof, where lobby groups can water-down any meaningful user protections that may impact bottom lines.\n\nMany companies make money by selling customers' personal or device-usage data to online advertisers. A privacy framework with too many teeth could prevent companies from selling certain types of data.\n\nTo help speed up the legislative process, the Business Roundtable group released their own consumer privacy framework [more here] that they'd like Congress to analyze and use as a base for any future law. This proposal includes many of the same provisions of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR); however, in very broad terms.\n\nGAO go-ahead for a GDPR-like clone\n\nEarlier this year, in February, the US Government Accountability Office (GAO), a US government auditing agency, gave Congress the go-ahead for passing a federal internet data privacy legislation to enhance consumer protections, similar to the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\n\nGAO recommended that the FTC be placed in charge of enforcing any future user data privacy legislation across the US.", "description": "CEOs who signed: Amazon, AT&T, Dell, IBM, SAP, Salesforce, Visa, Mastercard, and JP Morgan Chase.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/10/1e24c6c6-e731-4434-b0ff-316e7830c0bf/thumbnail/770x578/c16bc7ae86866ae5c439038011f990fa/tech-ceos-open-letter.png", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
