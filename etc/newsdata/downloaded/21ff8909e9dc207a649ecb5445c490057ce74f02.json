They lost 40-16 to England in Oita on Saturday.\n\n___\n\n3:20 p.m.\n\nWales has been dealt a big blow ahead of its match against France in the quarterfinals, with center Jonathan Davies ruled out because of a knee injury.\n\nOwen Watkin was promoted from the bench to the starting lineup, with Leigh Halfpenny taking his place among the replacements.\n\nDavies, a British and Irish Lion and one of Wales\u2019 most experienced players, hurt his knee in the 29-17 win over Fiji in the pool stage on Oct. 9. He was declared fit enough to start against France, only to aggravate the injury in the captain\u2019s run on Saturday.\n\nNews of the lineup change came about an hour before kickoff.\n\n___\n\n3:10 p.m.\n\nNew Zealand is set to be without flanker Matt Todd for the Rugby World Cup semifinal match against England on Saturday.\n\nAll Blacks coach Steve Hansen says Todd \u201cgot a bang\u201d on his shoulder in the 46-14 win over Ireland in the quarterfinals on Saturday and that it\u2019s \u201cunlikely he\u2019ll be available\u201d against England.\n\nTodd is mainly used as a replacement for New Zealand. He came on the 57th minute against Ireland and was sin-binned late in the game.\n\n___\n\n11:45 a.m.\n\nThe semifinal lineup at the Rugby World Cup will be completed on Sunday, with Wales playing France in Oita before host nation Japan takes on two-time champion South Africa in Tokyo.\n\nEngland and New Zealand advanced with big wins on Saturday and will meet in the first semifinal. It\u2019s tough to predict who will be in the second.\n\nJapan\u2019s historic qualification to the quarterfinals has been the story of the tournament so far - it\u2019s the first time any Asian country has got to the knockout stage - and the team has beaten South Africa at the World Cup before, of course.\n\nIn the \u201cMiracle of Brighton\u201d at the 2015 competition, the Springboks were famously defeated by Japan in one of the greatest shocks in any sport.\n\nWales starts as favorite against France in the all-European quarterfinal, having won seven of their last eight meetings.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Latest on the Rugby World Cup in Japan (all times local):", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
