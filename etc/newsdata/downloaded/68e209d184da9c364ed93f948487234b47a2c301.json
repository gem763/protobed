However, officials in the EU are worried that would not provide enough time for a new government to resolve its Brexit position ahead of a likely general election later this year, the Guardian reports.\n\nThe newspaper reports that June has been floated as a natural cut-off date because a vote on the EU's 7-year budget is not likely to arrive until June or possibly later. Downing Street officials, in a bid to prevent the EU from granting an extension, have warned that the UK could wield its veto on the budget as a means of being obstructive.\n\nCrucially, the June cut-off date would also provide enough time for the UK parliament to legislate for a second Brexit referendum.\n\nThe Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, is chief among those EU leaders holding out for the prospect of a second referendum.\n\n\"All the polls since Prime Minister Johnson became prime minister suggest that [a second referendum] is what the British people actually want, but their political system isn't able to give them that choice,\" he said last week.\n\nA consistent majority of British people believe the decision to leave the EU was a mistake, according to long-running polling by YouGov.\n\nMomentum builds for a second referendum\n\nSupport for a second Brexit referendum in the UK parliament has increased in recent months, after the opposition Labour party, which holds the second largest bloc in the parliament, moved to back a new vote.\n\nBBC Newsnight reported on Tuesday that there will be a \"big push\" from opposition MPs to get a second Brexit referendum onto the statute book once Brexit is delayed.\n\nOur political editor tells us that there will be a big push in Parliament next week to get a referendum onto the statute book@nicholaswatt | #Newsnight pic.twitter.com/CZtD6xOPLH \u2014 BBC Newsnight (@BBCNewsnight) October 8, 2019\n\nFormer Conservative MP Amber Rudd, who resigned from Cabinet in September, came out in support of a so-called People's Vote this week, with more Conservative MPs set to follow if Johnson comes out explicitly in favour of a no-deal Brexit.\n\nBrexit talks close to collapse\n\nTalks about a possible Brexit deal were close to collapse on Monday after Downing Street made extraordinary claims about the content of a phone call between the prime minister and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\nAn unnamed Number 10 official claimed that Merkel told Johnson that Northern Ireland had to stay in the EU's customs union, which the source claimed meant a deal now looked \"essentially impossible, not just now but ever.\"\n\nDonald Tusk, the European Council president, gave an insight into the extraordinary level of anger about the reported details of the phone call, which senior German politicians described as \"improbable.\"\n\n\"What's at stake is not winning some stupid blame game,\" he wrote in a tweet addressed directly to Boris Johnson.\n\n\"At stake is the future of Europe and the UK as well as the security and interests of our people. You don't want a deal, you don't want an extension, you don't want to revoke. Quo vadis?
