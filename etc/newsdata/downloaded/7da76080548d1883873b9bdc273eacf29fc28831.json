That route would be about 500 miles longer, adding up to an hour of flight time.\n\nAeroplanes and airlines are more technically advanced than ever before, with better fuel efficiency, longer ranges, and computer-aided logistical planning. But as some flights get longer, the question is whether passengers and flight crews can tolerate more hours in the air without a layover to break things up.\n\nQantas used the flight \u2013 and plans to do the same for the London flight \u2013 to conduct research into how pilots, cabin crews, and passengers coped with the long flight time, as well as to test efforts to minimise the impact of jetlag as passengers cross 15 time zones.\n\nThe flight \u2013 a repurposed delivery flight of a new Boeing 787-9, from Boeing\u2019s Seattle plant \u2013 only had 40 passengers and 10 crew, including four on-duty pilots. Passengers included several Qantas frequent flyers participating in the research study, off-duty Qantas employees, researchers, and media, including this reporter.\n\nThe flight with a full load of passengers and cargo is not currently possible \u2013 the heavier load would reduce the plane\u2019s range.\n\nTwo planes in development from Airbus and Boeing would have that capability. Qantas has said that it will decide by the end of 2019 which one it will use and that it expects to start commercial service as early as 2023, Alan Joyce, Qantas\u2019 CEO, said. The airline had previously hoped to launch service by 2022 or 2023.\n\nDue to the low passenger load, each passenger was allocated a business class seat that could convert into a bed, although passengers were encouraged to spend time in the coach cabin in order to balance the plane.\n\n\u201cI feel better than I usually do,\u201d Nick Mole, one of the passengers in the research study, told Business Insider about 17 hours into the flight. Mr. Mole often flies in business class, but said that he feels better rested after an ultra-long-haul direct flight, rather than one with a connection, including Qantas\u2019 service to New York via Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019d want to do 20 hours in the back of the plane, though,\u201d he added.\n\nAs part of the flight, Qantas altered the normal service routine, adjusting to Sydney time as soon as the plane was in the air. Cabin lighting, meal services, and food options were tailored to help passengers and crew either feel more awake, or be more attuned to nighttime. The \u201clunch\u201d meal \u2013 served at around 11:15 p.m. New York time \u2013 included options like spicy tomato soup, a spicy Mexican-style chicken breast, and braised beef short ribs, while the \u201cdinner\u201d meal \u2013 at around 4:15 a.m. New York time \u2013 included carbohydrate-heavy options and comfort food.\n\n\u201cThe timing and service helped,\u201d Mole said. \u201cI got some good uninterrupted sleep.\u201d\n\nThe primary flight crew, which also took part in extensive testing, including brain-wave measurements and melatonin analyses, also ate the adapted meals and worked on a custom tailored shift schedule.\n\nThe pilot-in-charge, Captain Sean Golding, described the shift period for the four pilots, who worked in two shifts:\n\n\u201cThe whole crew will be on for the first hour-and-a-half. Then, I\u2019ll take a two-and-a-half hour break. I\u2019ll work for the next five-and-a-half hours, sleep for the next five-and-a-half, work the next two-and-a-half, and we\u2019ll all be on for the final approach and landing.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes, I sleep better on the long-haul flights than I do at home,\u201d he added.\n\nBusiness Insider will be publishing a full behind-the-scenes report from Qantas\u2019 first Project Sunrise test flight.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
