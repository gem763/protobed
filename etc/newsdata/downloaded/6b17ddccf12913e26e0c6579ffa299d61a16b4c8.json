That we have to shut the door and be stronger,\u201d Chambers said.\n\n\u201cBut when you have players like that obviously it does help as well. We\u2019re working every day in training and working on what we need to do and we\u2019ll just keep going.\n\n\u201cAubameyang\u2019s very key. He\u2019s a quality striker and a lot of the players on this team are quality, so to have him at the top of the team, scoring the goals is brilliant for us.\u201d", "description": "Arsenal escaped with a win against Aston Villa despite battling with 10 men for 49 minutes - but can thank an oversight from the officials for claiming all three points.Ainsley Maitland-Niles saw red and Villa had twice led before Calum Chambers equalised.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/WTmCf36zgYJ.ZElztlbb_Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEwNTI7aD03ODg-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JqCklufZltbE7cVH4WA4NA--~B/aD0zOTQ7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/37e01962a0b3688148eada36edc788cb", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
