A new clubhouse would be built and the track rotated to create parcels of land that the city could sell for private development. Training and stable operations would move south to Laurel Park in Anne Arundel County, which would undergo a renovation costing approximately $175 million.\n\nAD\n\nBut several key elements remain unresolved. The parties have not yet drafted legislation needed to fund the bonds that would be sold to cover the cost, but they plan to do so before the next General Assembly session starts in January. The bill is expected to be complex and is tentatively dubbed the \u201cRacing and Community Development Act of 2020.\u201d\n\nIn an interview, Frank Stronach, 87, said he doesn\u2019t necessarily have an issue with the deal his daughter, Stronach Group President Belinda Stronach, 53, cut with the city of Baltimore to keep the second leg of the Triple Crown at Pimlico in Park Heights. But he doesn\u2019t like that he wasn\u2019t consulted, believes his daughter is an illegitimate company president and wants the agreement to do much more for the Park Heights community.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cShe is not the rightful owner,\u201d Frank Stronach said. \u201cI\u2019ve been kept out of the loop. We would need a commitment from the state. We would need to have an urban farm, food processing plants, greenhouses. Money will not fix the poverty, only meaningful jobs.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nFrank and Belinda Stronach have been embroiled in lawsuits since last year, when he sued her in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, alleging she was diverting funds meant for projects such as his grass-fed cattle farm to support her extravagant lifestyle. His initial complaint sought $520 million Canadian \u2014 about $390 million in U.S. dollars \u2014 and asked to have his daughter, who also serves as The Stronach Group\u2019s chairman, removed from the company.\n\nIn response, Belinda Stronach alleged Frank Stronach blew millions on failed \u201cpassion projects\u201d over the years, including spending hundreds of millions on agriculture, thoroughbred horse operations, golf courses and two 12-story bronze statues of a Pegasus horse defeating a dragon.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI started in a garage and I built up a company of 175,000 employees,\u201d Frank Stronach said in an interview Wednesday. \u201cI worked seven days a week, 24 hours a day, and then I got shut out of the business by my daughter in 2014.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAlan Rifkin, a lawyer for the Stronach Group in Baltimore, said Frank Stronach can\u2019t derail the deal because he has no controlling interest in the company.\n\n\u201cHis lawsuit has no bearing on this plan,\u201d Rifkin said.\n\nIn a statement, the Stronach Group also said that Frank Stronach no longer has a say in the decisions the company makes.\n\n\u201cWhile anyone is welcome to share their views on horse racing nationally or locally, Frank Stronach has no official role with, nor does he speak on behalf of, The Stronach Group or the Maryland Jockey Club,\u201d the statement said. \u201cTSG and MJC are fully focused on the critically important and transformative plans for Maryland racing and community development that we, along with the Maryland Thoroughbred Industry, the Mayor of Baltimore City, and the County Executives of Anne Arundel and Baltimore Counties have submitted to State leaders.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTiffani Steer, a spokeswoman for the Stronach Group, also said the company \u201cdoes not anticipate a trial prior to 2021\u201d in Frank Stronach\u2019s suit, well after the General Assembly is expected to act on the Preakness deal.\n\nLester Davis, a spokesman for Baltimore Mayor Bernard C. \u201cJack\u201d Young, said the mayor is not worried about Frank Stronach\u2019s suit.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had very productive conversations with the president of the company and we\u2019re looking forward to realizing a plan that all parties agree is the best way forward,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThe legislature\u2019s excited. The city\u2019s abuzz.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Frank Stronach, who described himself as a \u201cmajor\u201d shareholder in the company, said he will continue to press to remove Belinda from the firm. He said he wants a board to pick a non-Stronach family member to serve as president. He also wants to convert the horse-racing industry to a nonprofit model, complete with a \u201cHorse Racing Bill of Rights\u201d that would help protect horses, jockeys and workers.\n\n\u201cCan we improve horse racing and eliminate the poverty of our neighbors? I believe we can do both,\u201d Frank Stronach said.\n\n\u2014 Baltimore Sun\n\nAD", "description": "Frank and Belinda Stronach have been embroiled in lawsuits, with each criticizing the other over spending.", "authors": ["Luke Broadwater"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/lZXHeEm0i6DuSZUzlGZpidtr0r8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5PADYMTZZMI6TJ57ZCSDXBHOGE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
