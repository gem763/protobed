It was supposed to be your job to help, not destroy,\" she said.\n\nProsecutors had asked the judge for special consideration of a life sentence for Perrault, once a pastor at an Albuquerque parish and a chaplain at Kirtland Air Force Base.\n\nHe was convicted in April of six counts of aggravated sexual abuse and one count of abusive sexual contact with a minor under 12.\n\n\"It is a long sentence but certainly a fitting one given the length of his conduct and devastating impact,\" U.S. Attorney John Anderson said.\n\n'HARRY POTTER' BOOKS FROM CATHOLIC SCHOOL BECAUSE READING SPELLS 'RISK CONJURING EVIL SPIRITS'\n\nPerrault pleaded not guilty after he was returned to the U.S. from Morocco in 2017 and maintained his innocence at the sentencing. His defense team plans to file an appeal.\n\nThe abuse counts stemmed from the treatment of one boy at Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque and at Santa Fe National Cemetery. The two sites are within federal jurisdiction, which allowed U.S. authorities to file charges with no statute of limitations.\n\nSeveral people who were not involved in the specific charges were allowed Friday to recount abuse by Perrault and describe their emotional and mental anguish.\n\nElaine Montoya said her first kiss came from Perrault at the start of a two-year sexual relationship.\n\n\"He had convinced me that it was normal ... a gift from God,\" she told the court.\n\nARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY EXPRESSES 'PROFOUND SHAME' FOR BRITISH MASSACRE IN INDIA\n\nCharles Starzynski said his first sexual experience was with Perrault instead of any of the girls he liked. He called the former priest a con man concerned only with his image of sophistication.\n\n\"You're just a jerk,\" he said.\n\nIn his only comments, Perrault said he had not made initial eye contact with the people who testified because he is hard of hearing and was watching a computer to read transcriptions of what was being said.\n\nHe declined several opportunities to make other remarks.\n\nAuthorities say their decades-long pursuit of Perrault led them to Morocco \u2014 a country that does not have an extradition treaty with the United States \u2014 and showed how far they were willing to go to seek justice.\n\nPerrault was in jail at the time and Moroccan officials decided to honor an arrest warrant presented by U.S. authorities.\n\nPerrault is among more than 70 clergy members identified by the Santa Fe Archdiocese as credibly accused of abusing children in New Mexico.\n\nThe archdiocese is in bankruptcy proceedings as a result of the abuse scandal.\n\nPerrault first arrived in New Mexico in the 1960s after church officials in Connecticut sent him to a center that treated priests accused of abuse. Located in the Jemez Mountains north of Albuquerque, the facility was operated by the Servants of the Paraclete religious order.\n\nProsecutors wrote in a recent court filing that they had tried Perrault on a \"small fraction\" of his crimes, saying he had many more victims. At trial, several men testified that he abused them as children in his car, a church rectory and other locations.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe victim at the center of the prosecutors' case said Perrault took him on excursions to amusement parks and to the military base in Albuquerque and had touched him inappropriately as many as 100 times starting when he was 10.\n\nThe abuse ended in 1992, the year Perrault left the state. An attorney had been preparing two lawsuits at the time against the Archdiocese of Santa Fe alleging Perrault had sexually assaulted seven children.", "description": "A former Roman Catholic priest who fled the country decades ago was sentenced Friday in New Mexico to 30 years in prison after a jury found him guilty of sexually abusing an altar boy at a veterans' cemetery and military base.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/AP19256086332590.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
