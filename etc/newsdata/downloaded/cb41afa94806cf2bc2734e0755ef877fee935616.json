So you open up those boxes.\u201d\n\nPitt previously described his 2016 split from Jolie as a \u201chuge generator for change\u201d in his own life that allowed him to take a hard look at his bad habits.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember a day since I got out of college when I wasn\u2019t boozing or had a spliff, or something. Something. And you realize that a lot of it is, um \u2014 cigarettes, you know, pacifiers. And I\u2019m running from feelings,\u201d he told GQ in May 2017. \u201cI\u2019m really, really happy to be done with all of that. I mean, I stopped everything except boozing when I started my family. But even this last year, you know \u2014 things I wasn\u2019t dealing with. I was boozing too much. It\u2019s just become a problem. And I\u2019m really happy it\u2019s been half a year now, which is bittersweet, but I\u2019ve got my feelings in my fingertips again.\u201d\n\nBrad Pitt has had 2 big performances this year in \u201cOnce Upon a Time \u2026 in Hollywood\u201d and now \u201cAd Astra.\u201d He opens up about sobriety and his Alcoholics Anonymous recovery group. https://t.co/ubnlau4Zr9 \u2014 The New York Times (@nytimes) September 4, 2019\n\nIn the Times profile, Pitt described how the attention he received as his career was taking off in the \u201990s \u201creally threw\u201d him and made him even more dependent on drugs and alcohol.\n\n\u201cIt was really uncomfortable for me, the cacophony of expectations and judgments,\u201d he said. \u201cI really became a bit of a hermit and just bonged myself into oblivion.\u201d\n\nLife certainly seems a bit smoother for Pitt these days.\n\nHe reached a custody agreement with Jolie in late 2018 that awarded joint custody of the children. And he\u2019s gaining Oscar buzz for his performance in two of 2019\u2032s biggest movies, \u201cOnce Upon A Time In Hollywood\u201d and the upcoming \u201cAd Astra.\u201d", "description": "The actor got candid about \"pain, grief and loss\" that followed his highly publicized divorce.", "authors": ["Entertainment Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5948037c210000290033cea4.jpeg?cache=oormbqxjzd&ops=1778_1000"}
