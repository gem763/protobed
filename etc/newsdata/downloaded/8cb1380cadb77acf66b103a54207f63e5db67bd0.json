Gareth Southgate doesn\u2019t experiment\n\nIn many ways, Southgate\u2019s team for this game was disappointing. After including both Mason Mount and James Maddison in his squad \u2013 two players who are in form and offer something different \u2013 Southgate surprisingly stuck with Ross Barkley in midfield. While the England manager may well tinker against Kosovo, he could have afforded to experiment against this Bulgarian side.\n\nNow he faces the conundrum of fitting Mount and Maddison in. In truth, you can only really afford to play one of Mount or Maddison in the same midfield, with the pair occupying similar spaces, and thus one of them will not have an extended opportunity in the side in this international break. One of them should have played against Bulgaria in the place of Barkley, whose qualities are well-known.\n\n2. New goal kick laws causing teams trouble\n\nEngland\u2019s first goal came after Raheem Sterling pounced on a loose attempt to play out from the back, with Bulgaria looking to utilise the change to the goal kick law that stipulates that the ball no longer has to leave the box before it is touched by another player.\n\nThe problem is that having defenders inside the box simply invites a tighter forward press, as England showed, pushing all three forwards to the edge of the box and then closing in on the defender receiving the ball to force the error.\n\nBulgaria are not the first side to cause themselves problems in this manner. Tottenham have created plenty of bother for themselves early on this season by pushing their centre-backs level with Hugo Lloris, who is hugely uncomfortable with the ball at his feet.\n\nTraditional goal kicks have not been outlawed. If you do not have the players to play out from the back then there is little harm in playing the ball long.\n\n3. England build towards Euro 2020 in the Liverpool mould\n\nGareth Southgate has settled on a 4-3-3 formation since the conclusion of the World Cup, and England\u2019s version is very much starting to resemble Liverpool\u2019s, particularly the front three.\n\nWings Raheem Sterling and Marcus Rashford both like to cut in and get in behind, much like Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah, while Harry Kane is beginning to thrive as a creator who drops a little deeper, a la Roberto Firmino.\n\nIt is becoming apparent in midfield, too. Southgate seems to be favouring workers in midfield along with one holding player, with Declan Rice getting an extended run in that role. When Ben Chilwell is fully fit and Trent Alexander-Arnold asserts himself as first choice right-back, England will have similarly potent full-backs to Jurgen Klopp\u2019s side.\n\nEngland have rarely had such a concrete plan heading into a major tournament, and that bodes well.\n\n4. Declan Rice finds his international footing\n\nDeclan Rice is an increasingly important figure to this England side, as the only true midfield sitter that Gareth Southgate has at his disposal.\n\nHowever, Rice looked nervous in his first few England appearances, uncharacteristically loose in possession and at times straying out of position.\n\nThis was a much better performance, particularly in the second half. Rice showed why he was lured back from the Irish set-up, firm in the tackle to break up play, simple and accurate with his passing and controlling midfield affairs from the base of the three.\n\n5. Harry Kane will break Wayne Rooney\u2019s England goal scoring record\n\nAnother three to Harry Kane\u2019s England tally. The Tottenham striker scored international goals number 23, 24 and 25 in game number 40.\n\nRooney\u2019s record is 53 goals in 120 games \u2013 if Kane continues at this rate he will have 75 at the same stage. And Kane could go on and on \u2013 he is not a player who relies on physical gifts, and his immense work rate and the nature of many of England\u2019s qualifying fixtures will offer him plenty of opportunities to get up to and surpass Rooney.", "description": "England\u00a0cruised to a 4-0 victory over Bulgaria to continue their perfect start to Euro 2020 qualifying.
