Calling a snap poll, Downing Street believes, will stall his opponents\u2019 bid to set up legislation to avoid a no-deal Brexit at the end of next month.\n\n\u201cWhat MPs will be voting for will be to hold a rapid election,\u201d the senior government official said. An Oct. 14 vote would come three days before a crucial summit with EU leaders in Brussels.\n\nUnder British parliamentary rules, Mr. Johnson can\u2019t trigger an election on his own. Two-thirds of lawmakers must vote in favor for one to be held, meaning Mr. Johnson would need the backing of some opposition lawmakers.\n\nWith lawmakers returning from their summer recess on Tuesday, battle lines are being drawn up over Brexit. The fight pits lawmakers led by the prime minister arguing that the U.K. must quit the bloc on Oct. 31\u2014without a divorce deal if necessary\u2014against an opposing group that wants to block a no-deal exit because of the economic damage it is expected to cause.\n\nThree years after the U.K. voted to leave the EU, the country and its main parties remain bitterly split on how to deliver on the referendum vote, creating a stalemate that has heightened business uncertainty, damaged investment and driven an outflow of financial assets.\n\nMr. Johnson warned on Monday that if lawmakers manage to postpone Brexit for a third time beyond the Oct. 31 deadline, \u201cthey will plainly chop the legs out from under\u201d U.K. negotiators seeking a better deal with the EU in Brussels. The U.K. was originally due to leave the bloc on March 29, but the exit date has been twice postponed.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want an election; you don\u2019t want an election,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. But in a hint that he might call one if Parliament tied his hands, he added: \u201cI want everybody to know that there are no circumstances in which I would ask Brussels to delay. We are leaving on the 31st of October, no ifs or buts.\u201d\n\nLawmakers opposing a no-deal exit were plotting ways on Monday to force Mr. Johnson\u2019s hand through maneuvering in the House of Commons that are expected to start on Tuesday.\n\nA Majority of One With a working majority of just a single seat, Boris Johnson is vulnerable to any revolt from within his party. Seats by party in the U.K. Parliament Majority 320 seats 310 Conservatives 245 Labour 74 Other parties 10 DUP Seats by party in the U.K. Parliament Majority 320 seats 310 Conservatives 245 Labour 74 Other parties 10 DUP Seats by party in the U.K. Parliament Majority 320 seats 74 Other parties 310 Conservatives 245 Labour 10 DUP Seats by party in the U.K. Parliament Majority 320 seats 310 Conservatives 245 Labour 10 DUP 74 Other parties\n\nTheir favored approach is to pass a law requiring Mr. Johnson to ask the EU for an extension of the Brexit negotiations beyond the Oct. 31 deadline, unless he secures a new deal with the EU before then, opposition party officials say.\n\nSince his Conservative Party musters a majority of just one vote in the House of Commons, Mr. Johnson is vulnerable to any revolt in his own party.\n\n\u201cWe are working with other parties to do everything necessary to pull our country back from the brink,\u201d opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said Monday, adding that a no-deal Brexit would cause economic disruption.\n\nMr. Johnson is pushing back, arguing that a majority of Britons voted to leave the EU in 2016 and their vote should be respected.\n\nLast week, he announced Parliament would be suspended for several weeks from mid-September, reducing the amount of time for lawmakers to pass laws that could frustrate or further delay Brexit.\n\nOver the weekend, the government said any Conservative lawmaker who votes to block a no-deal exit could be barred from standing for re-election on the party\u2019s ticket. As many as 20 could be preparing to rebel, political observers say.\n\n\u201cI would say there is a 95% chance that if Parliament does not act this week we will leave without a deal,\u201d said Conservative lawmaker David Gauke, a former justice minister who is against a no-deal Brexit.\n\nSince becoming prime minister in July, Mr. Johnson has led a two-pronged approach to try to resolve Brexit. On one hand, he is trying to renegotiate a divorce deal his predecessor agreed with the EU last year. On the other, he is preparing the country to suddenly break with the EU at the end of October if improved divorce terms aren\u2019t offered.\n\nKey to any renegotiation is finding a guarantee to ensure frictionless trade continues between Northern Ireland, which is in the U.K., and the Republic of Ireland, which is in the EU, after Brexit.\n\nThe current divorce deal could see the U.K. locked into a customs union with the trade bloc indefinitely to ensure no hard border on the island of Ireland, a move which stops the U.K. signing its own trade deals. Mr. Johnson met several EU leaders during August and urged that this \u201cbackstop\u201d be replaced.\n\nSo far, no compromise has been found. European Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva said Monday that talks with the U.K. are continuing but that the outcome \u201cwill depend on when we will receive concrete proposals\u201d from the U.K.\n\nOver the weekend, Michel Barnier, who is leading the negotiations on the EU side, wrote in the Sunday Telegraph newspaper that he was \u201cnot optimistic about avoiding a no-deal scenario.\u201d\n\nEU officials worry Mr. Johnson doesn\u2019t have the votes in Parliament to ratify a revised deal. So only when the dust settles on the current parliamentary fight would negotiations begin in earnest.\n\nWith the likelihood of no-deal rising, both sides are preparing to mitigate the disruption caused by the sudden implementation of trade barriers between the U.K. and the EU. The British government recently launched a large-scale advertising campaign with the slogan \u201cGet Ready for Brexit,\u201d and an online questionnaire to help Britons prepare themselves.\n\nWith a general election looking increasingly likely, Mr. Johnson has toured the U.K., promising fresh funds for the police and schools. He is regularly pictured in British hospitals talking up his attachment to the popular nationalized health service. So far, Mr. Johnson\u2019s approach has translated into a bounce in the polls.\n\nThe Conservatives lead the opposition Labour Party by eight points, according to a poll of polls by Britain Elects. But with public opinion over party preferences unusually volatile as the anti-Brexit Liberal Democrats and the upstart Brexit Party gather significant support, an election could merely extend the Brexit impasse or lead to a government headed by Mr. Corbyn, Labour\u2019s leftwing leader.\n\nWith a parliamentary battle looming, one advantage Mr. Johnson has is that opposition lawmakers are divided. Some want a more mild form of Brexit that would keep the U.K. closely integrated with the EU. Others want to cancel Brexit altogether.\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nBritain\u2019s Liberal Democrats are anti-Brexit. An earlier version of this article incorrectly referred to the party as anti-EU.\n\nWrite to Max Colchester at max.colchester@wsj.com and Jason Douglas at jason.douglas@wsj.com", "description": "The chances of an early British general election to resolve a three-year impasse over Brexit appeared to rise on Monday as Prime Minister Boris Johnson launched a broadside at lawmakers seeking to thwart his Brexit plans.", "authors": ["Max Colchester", "Jason Douglas", "Max.Colchester Wsj.Com", "Jason.Douglas Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103327/social"}
