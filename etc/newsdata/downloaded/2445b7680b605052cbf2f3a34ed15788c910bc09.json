I would have been hindering my own progress by moaning and not wanting to perform properly.\n\n\u201cI have too much respect for my manager, the fans and my team-mates to treat them that way. It was a thing where, 'OK, this hasn't happened, but I've got to get on with it.'\n\n\u201cI've got to prove every time that I'm the top player I claim to be, so I had to get over it quickly.\u201d\n\nZaha stopped short of pledging his long-term future to the Eagles, but their flying start \u2013 sixth in the Premier League after eight games \u2013 has been of some comfort.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nHe added: \u201cI'm seeing how it goes. I'm a Crystal Palace player and I'm just trying to perform to the best of my ability for the club.\n\n\u201cThe season's gone well for us. We've got a lot more in us and everyone's happy with where we are right now.\n\n\u201cLast season I set myself a target of 10 goals and I managed to get 10, so I was happy. Hopefully I can reach my goals again \u2013 that's all that is on my mind.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, Zaha won a gong at the Best of Africa Awards for his charity work, which includes giving 10 per cent of his wages to good causes including his sister's orphanage, Tamara's Hope.", "description": "The winger was the subject of a bid from the Gunners in the summer but it fell way below Palace's valuation", "authors": ["Mike Walters", "Image", "Getty Images", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20536536.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_West-Ham-United-v-Crystal-Palace-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
