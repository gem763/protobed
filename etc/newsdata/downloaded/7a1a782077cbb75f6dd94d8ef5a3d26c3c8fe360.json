Gulen denies any involvement.\n\nThe Cumhuriyet staff had been in and out of jail for the duration of their trials. In September, Turkey\u2019s Supreme Court of Appeals ordered the release of six of those jailed, leaving only Emre Iper, the newspaper\u2019s accountant, still in jail.\n\nCumhuriyet said on Friday the court had ruled for Iper\u2019s release after his lawyers appealed, following judicial reforms passed by the Turkish parliament this month aimed at improving freedoms of speech and press, as mandated by the European Union.\n\nIn the three-year purge since the coup attempt, more than 77,000 people have been jailed pending trial and about 150,000 civil servants, military personnel and others have been sacked or suspended from their jobs. Some 150 media outlets have also been closed and 160 journalists jailed.\n\nRights groups and Turkey\u2019s Western allies have voiced concern over the scale of the crackdown, saying Erdogan used the coup as an excuse to quash dissent.\n\nHarlem Desir, the media freedom representative at the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), said he welcomed Iper\u2019s release.\n\nHe also cited media reports as saying three more journalists had also been released on Friday, which Reuters could not confirm.\n\n\u201cI welcome the release of four journalists and media workers today in Turkey, at a time when the new judicial reform is entering into force,\u201d Desir said in a statement.\n\n\u201cI urge the Turkish authorities to use this positive momentum and release all journalists who are still behind bars in the country,\u201d he said.", "description": "A Turkish court on Friday ordered the release of the last jailed employee of the opposition Cumhuriyet newspaper, one of 14 staff sentenced to lengthy prison terms in April 2018 on terrorism-related charges, the newspaper said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
