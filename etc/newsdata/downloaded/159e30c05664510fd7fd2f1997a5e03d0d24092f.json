New physical editions of the record will become available on November 11th, but with one notable exclusion from the track list.\n\nThe album was once home to Gaga\u2019s controversial collaboration with the singer R Kelly, \u2018Do What U Want\u2019. The song received a mixed reception from both fans and the media due to its lyrics, which implied ambiguous consent in a sexual relationship, in addition to the widely-known allegations of habitual sexual abuse attached to Kelly.\n\nOn the new edition of Artpop, however, track listings for both the CD and vinyl versions are missing \u2018Do What U Want\u2019.\n\nGaga removed the song from platforms and streaming services in January this year, after issuing an apology for working with the singer in spite of the allegations made against him. In the statement, the pop star admitted to having shown \u201cpoor judgement\u201d, and called the allegations against Kelly \u201cabsolutely horrifying and indefensible.\u201d\n\nShe went on to explain, \u201cAs a victim of sexual assault myself, I made both the song and video at a dark time in my life. My intention was to create something extremely defiant and provocative because I was angry and still hadn\u2019t processed the trauma that had occurred in my own life.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t go back, but I can go forward and continue to support women, men and people of all sexual identities, and of all races, who are victims of sexual assault. I have demonstrated my stance on this issue and others many times throughout my career. I share this not to make excuses for myself, but to explain...\u201d\n\nThough this was certainly an action for the better that demonstrated accountability on her part, Gaga\u2019s statement was rightly criticised for conveniently coming at a time when media scrutiny would be greatest \u2013 just after the release of Surviving R Kelly, a docuseries detailing the allegations made against the singer. Gaga had also previously defended working with Kelly, stating that they had formed a \u201cbond\u201d together over \u201cvery untrue things\u201d that had been written about them.\n\nKelly is facing 13 federal charges for sex trafficking, and currently awaiting trial.\n\nThis article originally appeared on i-D UK.", "description": "Take my money, Gaga.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5da5a9bd8ed6270009437447/lede/1571138243614-artpop-copy.jpeg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
