All three were 12-years-old at the time.\n\nLeutner became friends with Geyser in fourth grade as she struggled to make friends herself. They would spend time together playing outside and having sleepovers.\n\nIt was in sixth grade that she also met Weier and she was first told about Slenderman, a faceless, fictional creature in a suit that could grow tendrils from his back.\n\nDespite wanting to end their friendship, Leutner felt bad for Geyser and they remained close.\n\nOn the day after a sleepover for Geyser\u2019s birthday party, things took a horrifying turn which became the subject of true crime film Beware The Slenderman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHeading to the park with the two girls, at Weier\u2019s suggestion, they started to play what Leutner thought would be a game of hide and seek. Weier told Leutner to lie down and cover herself with leaves so she would be disguised.\n\nMorgan Geyser in court in 2015 (Picture: Getty)\n\nAnissa Weier conspired with Morgan to attack Leutner when they were 12-years-old (Picture: Getty)\n\nThen with a kitchen knife Weier later told police that Geyser had brought from her home, Geyser stabbed her multiple times in her chest, arms and legs and left her bleeding in the woods.\n\n\u2018I got up, grabbed a couple trees for support, I think,\u2019 Leutner, now 17, told ABC News. \u2018And then just walked until I hit a patch of grass where I could lay down.\u2019\n\nA cyclist found her and called 911.\n\nIn the ambulance, she says she \u2018couldn\u2019t focus much because my body was working so hard to keep itself alive. It was probably like, \u201cVision isn\u2019t really a priority right now.\u201d\u2018\n\nShe underwent emergency surgery at ProHealth Waukesha Memorial Hospital. One stab wound had cut through her diaphragm, while another narrowly missed her heart by less than a millimetre. The operation took six hours in total. She was left unable to communicate much in recovery and couldn\u2019t breathe on her own for some time.\n\nIt also had last effects on her mentally, and to this day Leutner sleeps with a pair of broken scissors under the pillow next to her \u2018just in case\u2019.\n\nThe two girls believed in a fictional character called Slenderman\n\n\u2018It was a little shocking to me to see that they had this big, huge plan that they had been working on for months,\u2019 she added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGeyser and Weier were charged in adult court with first-degree attempted intentional homicide after the attack.\n\nWeier pleaded guilty to a lesser charge and was found by a jury to be not guilty by mental disease or defect in 2017.\n\nGeyser pleaded guilty to the first-degree charges against her. In 2018, as a part of her plea agreement with prosecutors, Geyser was convicted but found not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect.\n\nWeier was sentenced to up to 25 years and Geyser up to 40 years in a mental health institution. However Geyser is potentially petitioning for release soon.\n\nMeanwhile Leutner plans to go to university next year and embark on a career in a medical field, which she feels was inspired by what happened to her.\n\nThe Sky Atlantic documentary Beware The Slenderman explores how the legend of the Slenderman, born from online memes became the focal point of the investigation into what happened to Leutner.\n\nDirected by Irene Taylor Brodsky, it explores the psychology that led to the horrific attack, and the rise of the Slenderman myth on the internet.\n\nThe parents of Geyser and Weier appear in the film narrating about the girls\u2019 childhoods, and features home videos of Geyser taken by her mother.\n\nBeware The Slenderman is available to watch on Sky Atlantic and to quench your thirst for all things true crime head to Sky Crime\n\nGot a showbiz story?
