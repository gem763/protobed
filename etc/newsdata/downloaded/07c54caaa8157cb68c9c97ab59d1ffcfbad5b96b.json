While the Sequoia Capital-backed firm was a late entrant in payment gateway (B2B payments business), Google Pay made its debut only two years ago in the hyper-competitive, consumer payments space.\n\nBoth companies kicked-off when their segments were considered overcrowded with little opportunity to become a sizeable player. Nevertheless, they have been making strong headways in their business.\n\nTo continue the growth momentum amidst intense competition, the duo also requires periodic investments. While Google has no dearth of capital, Razorpay Inc had also cornered a $75 million round led by Ribbit Capital in June this year.\n\nThe proceeds from the Series C round have started flowing into its Indian entity. According to RoC filings with Ministry of Corporate Affairs, the US-based holding entity Razorpay Inc has invested around Rs 130.15 crore in Razorpay Software.\n\nCalifornia based Razorpay Inc has acquired 21,94,055 equity shares of Razorpay Software at a price of Rs 593.22 per share. It\u2019s worth noting that Razorpay owns and operates the payment gateway business. The payment gateway products suite includes Razorpay Software, Razorpay Tech, and Razor Financial.\n\nIts merchant lending platform Razorpay Capital finances merchants who use company\u2019s products and services. The company also plans to foray into consumer lending and has applied for PPI licence to develop wallet, issue smart cards, gift cards, and co-branded credit cards through Razorpay Tech.\n\nRecently, Razorpay had acquired a fraud prevention AI startup, Thirdwatch, for an undisclosed amount. The company would leverage the Gurugram-based startup\u2019s artificial intelligence and machine learning-based detection tools to reduce cash on delivery frauds.\n\nThe fresh capital is likely to be used to strengthen the company\u2019s neo banking platform Razorpay X and lending arm Razorpay Capital. The firm competes with the likes of Paytm Payment Gateway, Billdesk, CCAvenue, Ogone among several others.", "description": "According to RoC filings with MCA, the US-based holding entity Razorpay Inc has invested around Rs 130.15 crore in Razorpay Software.", "authors": ["Gaurav Tyagi"], "top_image": "https://entrackr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Razorpay-image.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
