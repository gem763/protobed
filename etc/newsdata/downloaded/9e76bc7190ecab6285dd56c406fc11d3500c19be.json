They stand and take pictures with the guards\n\nParticipants attend the right-wing AfD Alternative for Germany political party demonstration titled 'Future Germany' on May 27, 2018 in Berlin\n\nHere, surely, was liberal democracy\u2019s finest hour \u2014 and a devastating indictment of Utopian socialism.\n\nThe whole world wanted to join in, too. Very soon, people from all over the planet (myself included) were descending on Berlin just to see for themselves and grab a souvenir piece of redundant Soviet masonry.\n\nSo, as we approach the 30th anniversary of this joyous moment, surely Germany \u2014 if not Eastern Europe \u2014 must be planning one hell of a party.\n\nTo my great surprise, it is not. Germany is approaching the November 9 milestone in contemplative mood. A sombre classical concert next to Berlin\u2019s Brandenburg Gate \u2014 followed by some vintage disco hits \u2014 will make do as the main event.\n\nWhile Germans like to call those heady days of 1989 \u2018the peaceful revolution\u2019 \u2014 as indeed it was \u2014 there will be no party hats, no euphoria.\n\nFrance may come to a joyous halt every July 14 to celebrate a very bloody and inconclusive revolution more than 200 years ago. In America, July 4, Independence Day is sacrosanct.\n\nYet, despite their magnificent, bloodless triumph, the Germans have never granted it the status of a public holiday (this year, it happens to fall on a Saturday). Perhaps they are mindful it is also the anniversary of Kristallnacht, the infamous 1938 night of orchestrated terror against German Jews.\n\nTheir politicians have decided Germany should, instead, honour the day when the two nations were formally reunified 11 months later. Even that, though, is an occasion for solemnity.\n\nIn recent days, I have watched crowds of foreign tourists flocking to see a surviving section of Berlin Wall which now sits alongside a shiny shopping centre.\n\nPeople were queuing for selfies next to a replica of the old Checkpoint Charlie border crossing, before popping over the road to McDonald\u2019s. Some went to \u2018Trabiworld\u2019 for a ride in a rickety old Trabant, the only vehicle to which most East German workers could aspire.\n\nCheck Point Charlie (pictured above) when in was operational. People now go and see it as a tourist attraction\n\nPeople are pictured above lining up for selfies at Check Point Charlie in BErlin (above)\n\nI dropped in on Berlin\u2019s \u2018Dederon-Design Ostprodukte\u2019, one of several shops selling authentic East German goods \u2014 scratchy clothes, Leninist lentils and those plastic housecoats beloved of the East German housewife (\u00a325 each). While Commie kitsch \u2014 what Germans call \u2018Ost[East]-algia\u2019 \u2014 may amuse outsiders, the locals see it very differently.\n\nAside from the concert, the only other notable event to mark the fall of the Wall will be a week-long panel of debates about the legacy of 1989.\n\nAcademics and commentators will gather to examine the \u2018lessons\u2019 of it all. In short, the over-arching German attitude could be summed up as: where did it all go wrong?\n\nInstead of rejoicing at their liberation from the jackboot of the hated Stasi secret police, many East Germans now just feel marginalised. They argue that the reunification of Germany has relegated them to second-class citizens. They have watched a brain drain as their best and brightest are lured away to enjoy prosperity in the West while living standards in the East fall further behind.\n\nBerlin (pictured above) now looks completely different compared to what it did before the wall was torn down\n\nBorn in the East and now an economist in Berlin, Dr Peter Bonisch, 39, recalls the risks his Catholic parents used to take merely by going to church in East Germany, and thus being branded as suspicious \u2018progressives\u2019.\n\nHe laughs as he recalls his first visit to the West after the fall of the Wall. \u2018We went to McDonald\u2019s and it was so exciting that we took all the packaging home!\u2019 But now he points to all the \u2018unintended consequences\u2019 since 1989.\n\nRobert at the last remaining watch tower in the city\n\nFertility rates, for example, have fallen due to the exodus of young women. Meanwhile, universities and government offices in the East, he says, tend to attract second-rate time-servers who have missed out on jobs in the West.\n\nMichael Kosmider, a Munster-based expert in employment law, points out that, among unskilled workers, wages are around 17 per cent lower in the East.\n\nUnemployment is higher, too. \u2018The big industries have moved towards the West,\u2019 says Kosmider. \u2018It will be very hard to re-establish any in the East and you can\u2019t move people around like chess pieces.\u2019\n\nWest Germans are no happier. Having coughed up nearly \u00a32 trillion in transitional subsidies for their poor relations since 1989, many West Germans are running out of sympathy. They abhor the giant strides taken by the far-Right Alternative fur Deutschland (AfD), thanks to voters in the East.\n\nIt was the \u2018Ossis\u2019 \u2014 as East or \u2018Ost\u2019 Germans are known \u2014 who helped the party triple its vote to come third at the last general election in 2017.\n\nThat was followed, just last month, by two important state elections in the East. In both, the AfD saw a thumping rise in its vote to take second place, at the expense of the far-Left party, Die Linke, which previously served as the protest vote in these parts.\n\nIn other words, disenchanted Ossis who once looked to the Left to redistribute West Germany\u2019s wealth now turn to extreme nationalism. You don\u2019t need to be a Regius Professor of History to know how that panned out last time.\n\n\u2018What was striking was the way in which the AfD stood on the slogan of \u201cLet\u2019s complete the revolution\u201d,\u2019 says historian Dr Hubertus Knabe. \u2018They are now presenting themselves as the defenders of that revolution.\u2019\n\nAn expert on Communist oppression and former director of the prison museum at Hohenschonhausen, he is dismayed that the German government has not done more to embrace the fall of the Wall. He points to a bizarre oversight by the interior ministry where officials simply \u2018forgot\u2019 to apply for state funding to mark the anniversary.\n\nFormer director at the Hochschomhavsen prison Dr Hubertus Knabe (pictured above)\n\nFormer inmate at the Stasi prison Hochschomhavsen talks to school children about his time here.\n\nFormer inmate Rolf at the Hochschomhavsen prison where is now a guide\n\nRobert at the the former Stasi Hochschomhavsen prison, inside the 'Submarine' cells\n\n\u2018In Germany, we are very scared of having an identity. But this anniversary would have been a chance to really celebrate a free and unified democracy,\u2019 he sighs.\n\nConceived in the East, Dr Knabe was born in the West after his pregnant mother made a daring escape shortly before the Wall went up.\n\nGermany, he says, takes a very different stance to its Stalinist past compared with the way it deals with any traces of Nazism.\n\nHence an extraordinary conference this month at which hundreds of Stalinists and Stasi thugs from the old regime gathered in the capital to celebrate a very different landmark: the 70th anniversary of the creation of the East German state.\n\nCome the end of World War II, Germany was carved up between the Allies \u2013 the U.S., UK, France and Soviet Union. In 1949, the Western powers merged their respective areas in to the Federal Republic (West Germany) while the Soviet Union turned its own sector into the \u2018Democratic Republic\u2019 or \u2018DDR\u2019 (East Germany).\n\nRobert at the DDR museum with the director Dr Peter Wolle in a mock up kitchen.Robert with a bubble car used in a escape to the west\n\nMillions started to flee; East Germany is the only country in history to record a constant population decline through its entire existence. To stem that exodus, it built a heavily guarded fence along its border, though weak points remained in Berlin, a city then split between all four powers. So, in 1961, the DDR and their Soviet puppet-masters erected the Berlin Wall.\n\nNow, the city has just witnessed a reunion of those puppets, led by Egon Krenz. The last dictator of the DDR, Krenz later spent just four years in an open prison for his part in the killings of four people shot while trying to escape. He now enjoys a comfortable retirement in the East.\n\nThis month, he was back at a gathering of fellow Stalinists in Berlin, hailing his murderous regime as \u2018a just, peaceful and reasonable world\u2019, to warm applause. Earlier, he told the BBC that the fall of the Wall had been \u2018the worst night of my life\u2019.\n\nHad this been a reunion of, say, SS stormtroopers, there would have been global uproar.\n\nThis neo-Marxist knees-up, however, attracted modest media coverage and a small protest. Most people just preferred to look the other way.\n\nSchool children stand around and listen to a talk given by a former inmate at the prison\n\nMany people visit the former prison each year and it has since been turned into a museum\n\nI drive out through the industrial suburbs of East Berlin to Hohenschonhausen, the infamous prison created by the Soviets and then run by the DDR\u2019s secret police, the Stasi. During the 1980s, it boasted 100,000 agents and 180,000 paid informers. The prison is a compellingly ghastly, perfectly preserved time capsule which attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors each year.\n\nIt is shocking enough to enter the padded cells and \u2018tiger cages\u2019 where you could find yourself banged up for months in solitary confinement on the whim of a gossipy neighbour. It is equally shocking to sit in the same chairs in the huge interrogation block where a suspect would be grilled to the point of insanity.\n\nRolf (above) says he still finds it hard to discuss his experiences\n\nDownstairs is one of the fake delivery vans in which the Stasi would roam the streets, sliding open a door to snatch suspected dissidents off the streets. It is all brilliantly captured in the Oscar-winning 2006 film, The Lives Of Others.\n\nBut what truly brings it home to anyone over the age of 30 is the fact that all this was going on in our lifetime.\n\nThose were the days when deluded Lefties such as Jeremy Corbyn and Diane Abbott would take their famous \u2018motorcycling holiday\u2019 across the people\u2019s paradise of East Germany, at the very same time that people including Rolf Kranz were being incarcerated in prisons like this.\n\nToday, Rolf, 64, returns as a volunteer guide, but he still finds it hard to discuss his experiences.\n\n\u2018I would like to forgive the people who put me in here, but my therapist tells me that this is not possible,\u2019 he says.\n\nHe was a young shop-worker in West Berlin in 1980 when he decided to take a day-trip into East Berlin \u2014 as Westerners could \u2014 \u2018out of curiosity\u2019. In a bar, over several beers, he was persuaded to help a tearful East German youth make an escape attempt.\n\nRolf promptly found himself a prisoner for the next two years. The worst of it, he said, was when his mother was finally allowed to visit him after six months.\n\n\u2018She was blonde before. Now she was completely grey because of me. I have felt guilty about that ever since.\u2019\n\nHe still clutches his prison papers, which were signed in person by the notorious head of the Stasi, Erich Mielke.\n\nIn a vast, bleak Soviet complex in another part of town, I visit the old Stasi HQ and walk through Mielke\u2019s vast office \u2014 a feast of hefty brown furniture and clunky telephones. Here you can see how the Stasi infiltrated everyone\u2019s life.\n\nA map of Saalfeld, a town of 58,000 people, reveals more than 3,300 agents and informers.\n\nDisplay cases show spy cameras hidden in belts, ties and buttons. I find instruction manuals on how to destroy people\u2019s reputations (one document, signed by two Stasi officers, reveals a scheme to plant a suspect\u2019s photo in a gay magazine in West Germany and then present it to his neighbours).\n\nRobert at the DDR museum with the director Dr Peter Wolle in a mock up kitchen\n\nFor all these horrors, many on both Left and Right now believe that the German government\u2019s headlong charge towards reunification after the fall of the Wall was a mistake \u2014 as the British PM, Margaret Thatcher, argued at the time.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t agree with Mrs Thatcher on many things but she was right about that,\u2019 says Tom Strohschneider, former editor of the Left-wing East German daily, Neues Deutschland. \u2018East Germany never had time to develop a sustainable economic plan of its own. It was all about power politics, not about people.\u2019\n\nPerhaps the best way to see how far Germany has travelled is to take a trip to the excellent DDR Museum, which shows the unvarnished truth of ordinary life in the old East.\n\nToday people to to Berlin specifically to see remaining parts of the Berlin wall (above)\n\nYou can walk through an exact replica of a dismal \u2018Ossi\u2019 council flat \u2014 and even poke through the contents of an \u2018Ossi\u2019 wardrobe and kitchen.\n\nThe place is heaving as director, Dr Stefan Wolle, talks me through the \u2018ambiguity\u2019 of ordinary life under the Stasi\u2019s relentless gaze.\n\nThe Berlin Wall was an abomination, which is why the world wants to celebrate its fall next month. It is amazing to think that it has now been down longer than it was ever up.\n\nYet, the last word has to go to those who lived beneath it, people such as Karin Gueffroy.\n\nHer son, Chris, was a waiter who could stand it no longer and made a dash for freedom in February 1989. He was the last East German to be shot dead while trying to escape \u2014 just nine months before the Wall came down.\n\n\u2018The Berlin Wall falling was the best thing that could ever have happened for us Germans,\u2019 says Karin. \u2018But, every year, the anniversary causes me unimaginable pain.\u2019", "description": "Thirty years on from the downing of the Berlin Wall, Robert Hardman visits Germany to find it is still divided, despite the event being the 'most defining image' of his lifetime.", "authors": ["Robert Hardman For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/21/20198086-0-image-a-19_1572037043529.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
