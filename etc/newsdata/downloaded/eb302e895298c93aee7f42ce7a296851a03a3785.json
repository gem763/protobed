And Tom Brady was not a unanimous choice. USA TODAY\n\nBill Belichick isn't the kind of guy who spends much time worrying over weather forecasts. The New England Patriots coach doesn't seem particularly concerned with the predictions of foul weather for his team's game at Gillette Stadium against the Cleveland Browns.\n\nDuring a press conference on Friday, he was asked when he begins to prepare for the possibility of adverse weather conditions.\n\n\"As late as possible,\" Belichick said. \"In the Giant game, it was supposed to be a monsoon and everything and, like usual, there was not one drop of rain and let's say minimal wind. Although there was some wind. It was across the field, so it didn't affect the game that much.\n\n\"We went down to Miami. We thought it was going to be hot. We thought it was going to be hot when it was scheduled. We thought it was going to be hot in training camp. We though it was going to be hot the week before the game. We thought it was going to be hot the day of the game. So predicting heat in Miami in September \u2026 maybe you and I can figure that out.\n\n\"I've seen the forecast (for Sunday against the Browns). This is the exact same forecast we had for the Giants. Not one drop of rain. So we'll see. I don't know. I'm sure it's hard to get it right, especially specific locations like this. Where it is 10 miles from here and where it is here makes all the difference in the world to us. That's the world we're in. So we'll see.\"\n\nIf you'd like to watch, the question starts at 9:10 in the video below.\n\nBill Belichick Live Press Conference 10/25: https://t.co/tQieTm0E71 \u2014 New England Patriots (@Patriots) October 25, 2019\n\nWould Belichick consider a foray into a gig as a weatherman when he retires from football?\n\n\"We'll see what my options are after that,\" Belichick said with a laugh.\n\nFollow Patriots Wire's Henry McKenna on Twitter @McKennAnalysis.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
