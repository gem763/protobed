AP Photo\n\nGitre: The surveys administered by the Army's Research Branch cover myriads of topics, from the individual food items placed in various rations, to the specific material used in seasonal uniforms, to the educational courses offered through the Armed Forces Institute.\n\nA soldier might be asked a hundred or more multiple-choice and short-answer questions in any one survey. They would be asked to record more their behaviors, insights, and experiences related to service directly. They were asked about their civilian lives as well, including their previous occupation, family background, regional identity, religion, and education. This information could be then correlated with other military and government records to provide a more holistic picture of the average American GI.\n\nOne of this research outfit's most reliable \"clients\" was the Army's Office of Surgeon General. The quality and effectiveness of medical and psychiatric care had wide implications, not least in terms of combat readiness. The Surgeon General's office was interested in more than the care it provided. Soldiers were asked about their most intimate of experiences\u2014their sexual habits and hygiene among them.\n\nAdministered in August 1945, Survey #233 asked men stationed in Italy if they were having sex with Italian women, and, if so, how frequently; did they pay for sex, how did they pay, did they \"shack\" up, use a condom and if not why not, drink beforehand, and did they know how to identify the symptoms of an STI? The battle against venereal diseases knew no lines of propriety.\n\nThe Research Branch surveyed or interviewed a half-million service members during the war. The answers they received were as varied as one can imagine, though there were of course common \"gripes,\" which the old Army hands could have easily ticked off without the aid of a cross-sectional scientific survey.\n\nYet the scope WWII military operations and the influx of so many educated civilians did create innumerable challenges that were often novel.\n\nBut from the soldier's perspective, it should not come as a shock that so many of them might have taken to heart the premise of the US's involvement in the war, that the US was committed to defending democracy, and alone if necessary.\n\nRespondent after survey respondent demanded, then, that the US military live up to the principles of democracy for which they were being called to sacrifice. And so, they savaged expressions of the old Regular Army's hierarchical \"caste\" culture wherever they saw it, but especially when it frustrated their own hopes and ambitions.\n\nThey wanted, in the parlance of the day, \"fair play\" and a \"square deal.\" They wanted to be respected as a human being, and not treated like a \"dog.\"", "description": "Inducting millions of civilians and turning them into effective troops, and keeping them happy, healthy, supplied, and fighting, was a daunting task.", "authors": ["Christopher Woody"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9f90f54af909137971d708?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
