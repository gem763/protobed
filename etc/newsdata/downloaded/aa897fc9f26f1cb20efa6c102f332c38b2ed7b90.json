That could spell serious trouble for Netanyahu's lengthy rule.\n\nWithout Lieberman's endorsement, both parties appear to have fallen well short of securing a parliamentary majority with ideological allies.\n\nGantz, a former military chief, has ruled out sitting with a Netanyahu-led Likud at a time when the prime minister is expected to be indicted on corruption charges in the coming weeks.\n\nNetanyahu desperately sought an outright majority with his hard-line and ultra-Orthodox allies in hopes of passing legislation to give him immunity from his expected indictment.\n\nIsrael's attorney general has recommended charging Netanyahu with bribery, fraud and breach of trust in three scandals, pending a hearing scheduled next month. A formal indictment would increase the pressure on Netanyahu to step aside if he does not have immunity.\n\nThe partial results released Wednesday by the Central Election Commission were based on 35 percent of the vote counted. The three Israeli TV channels reported the same outcome, based on more than 90 percent of the vote counted, but did not explain the discrepancy with the commission's percentage.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAccording to the partial results, Likud with its natural allies of religious and ultra-nationalist parties mustered 56 seats \u2014 or five short of the needed majority.\n\nFinal results are expected later Wednesday and could still swing in Netanyahu's favor.", "description": "Israel's two main political parties were deadlocked Wednesday after an unprecedented repeat election, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu facing an uphill battle to hold on to his job.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/netanyahu-.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
