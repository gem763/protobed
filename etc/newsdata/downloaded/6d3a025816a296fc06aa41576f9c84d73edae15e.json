And now we\u2019re stuck here, treated like the lowest citizens on earth.\u201d\n\nNot that long ago, Neh worked as a microfinance officer and lived with her husband and three children in a small town in the West of Cameroon. Earlier this year, she joined a group campaigning for anglophone independence. She insists her activism was peaceful and that she never supported rebel groups, but amid spiralling violence, she was arrested, beaten, and raped by soldiers. One night, an officer took her from her cell and told her to start running. She imagined she was about to die \u2013 but instead she ran into the arms of her husband who had paid a bribe for her freedom.\n\nHustled into hiding, Neh was then put on a plane to Quito where she joined the growing number of migrants from around the world using Ecuador as the jumping off point for the passage north.\n\nThe harrowing journey requires crossing the the lawless jungles of Darien Gap between Colombia and Panama, where migrants risk wild animals, raging rivers and predatory robbers .\n\nFor seven days, the 37-year-old hauled herself up and down mountain slopes, hanging on tree roots. Crossing a river, she was almost swept away by the current; an insect bite paralyzed her arm. And each day, her group passed the bloated and half-eaten corpses of others who had died on the same trail.\n\nThe next stage of her odyssey was more straightforward. With the help of bribes and official paperwork, Neh travelled by bus across Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, and Guatemala. She began to dream of a new life in the US, reunited with the three children she had left behind.\n\nAnd then, in Mexico, everything ground to an halt. She joined hundreds of migrants from Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola, Eritrea, Mauritania, and a smattering of other African countries who are stuck in Tapachula because of Mexico\u2019s willingness to bow to Trump and stem the flow of migrants.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Until recently, African migrants were waved through Mexico by immigration officials who had no interest in stopping them.

But the crackdown has caught up travelers from all around the world.\n\nTheir situation has only been exacerbated by US policies. Earlier this month the US supreme court ruled that the US authorities could deny asylum to anybody who passed through another country to get there.\n\nMeanwhile, US officials have pressured Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to accept asylum seekers from third countries, even though they are among the most dangerous countries in the world.\n\n\u201cWe have been taken hostage. We want our freedom,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Pel\u00e9 Messa, a TV presenter who fled the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2010 \u2013 first for Angola, and then Brazil, which he had left earlier this year when the security situation there made life untenable.\n\nAround him, the inhabitants of the protest camp were gearing up for another day of boredom, under the watchful eye of a group of National Guard officers in riot gear.\n\nRailings were draped with blankets and clothes sodden in the previous night\u2019s downpour. Migrants \u2013 grouped by nationality or language \u2013 pored over documents in Spanish that they couldn\u2019t read or scanned their phones for news from home. A pregnant woman prepared soup on a small wooden burner outside her tent. A couple of toddlers were using discarded plastic bottles as drums.\n\nPel\u00e9 gestured at the desultory scene: \u201cI took my children through the jungle for this? I\u2019m a corpse. I just haven\u2019t started rotting yet.\u201d\n\nUntil recently, African migrants were waved through Mexico by immigration officials who had no interest in stopping them.\n\nBut after Trump\u2019s threat of trade tariffs in May, Mexico\u2019s government scrambled to clamp down: flooding the south of the country with law enforcement, and stepping up cooperation with the US policy of sending asylum seekers back into northern Mexico while their cases are processed.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest For migrants from countries in Africa, who are much harder to repatriate, it has meant being kept in limbo. Photograph: Isaac Guzman/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFor Central Americans trying to get through southern Mexico the crackdown has brought more raids, record numbers of deportations, and greater vulnerability to criminal attacks as they are pushed into less visible routes.\n\nFor migrants from countries in Africa, who are much harder to repatriate, it has meant being kept in limbo.\n\nPreviously, Mexican immigration authorities had typically issued African migrants with documents ordering them to sort out their status or leave the country within 21 days. Now these documents, which had previously served as de facto transit visas, order them to leave by the southern border.\n\n\u201cMexico is using us as an instrument of politics to please Donald Trump,\u201d said Serge, 21, who also fled the conflict in Cameroon. \u201cThis is creating a lot of anger among us.\u201d\n\nFrustration in the camp has bubbled over several times, leading to some scuffles with the authorities. This weekend a small group of desperate Africa temporarily blocked a car carrying Filippo Grandi, the head of UNHCR who was visiting Tapachula. One pregnant woman threw herself in front of the car\u2019s wheels crying and pleading for help.\n\nMigrants are particularly angered by the perception that they are being coerced into applying for asylum in Mexico \u2013 where few feel safe and almost none want to stay.\n\n\u201cMexico is playing games with us,\u201d said a 36-year-old engineer from Eritrea who identified himself as Mr Testahiwet. \u201cThis is the way to get to America and we want to go to America. Mexico is the wrong place to ask for asylum.\u201d\n\nSome are so desperate they have begun looking for ways to get through Mexico undetected \u2013 though their skin colour and their lack of Spanish makes this hard to do.\n\nTrump's plan for those seeking safe haven: a ticket to the violent heart of Central America Read more\n\nOne recent dawn, at a major crossing point on the Suchiate river, not far from Tapachula, around 10 Cameroonians clambered onto a raft made of huge inner tubes and headed towards the Guatemalan side.\n\nThe migrants sat in a glum and nervous silence as they were punted across, and then piled into cars with blackened windows, presumably driven by people smugglers who had promised to get them through Mexico by another route.\n\nBack at the camp, Kelly, another English-speaking refugee from Cameroon, said she hadn\u2019t been able to speak to her children for weeks. Back home, she had been a physics teacher, but she fled her job and her home when the rebels enforced a school boycott on pain of death.\n\n\u201cYou leave when you can\u2019t take it anymore. You start running, and you keep running until you can stop,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are not looking for greener pastures \u2013 we are looking for safety.\u201d", "description": "Hundreds of migrants from Africa are stuck in Tapachula because of Mexico\u2019s willingness to bow to Trump and stem the flow of migrants", "authors": ["Jo Tuckman"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf692150af8e2429911087e88f2de117b7859e55/0_316_6119_3673/master/6119.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=70553ea342645ead4497d6196fc7767a", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
