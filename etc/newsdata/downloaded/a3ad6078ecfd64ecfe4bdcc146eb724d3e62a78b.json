The activists started chanting over Mr. McAleenan again, and he left the stage.\n\n\u201cOK, thank you, have a good day,\u201d he said.\n\nSome in the audience cheered as he left.\n\nHomeland Security later released the acting secretary\u2019s speech he planned to give, in which he recounted the steps the department has taken to cut into the record surge of illegal immigrant families at the border earlier this year.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
