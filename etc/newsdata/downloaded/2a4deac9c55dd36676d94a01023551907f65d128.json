However, videos circulated on social media Wednesday, showed workers removing NBA signage at the Shanghai arena where the games are to be played.\n\nFollow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn", "description": "A disturbing trend has swept over the NBA in which fans \u2014 in America \u2014 have either been removed from games or had their signage confiscated", "authors": ["Dylan Gwinn"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/AP-Photo_Nick-Wass-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
