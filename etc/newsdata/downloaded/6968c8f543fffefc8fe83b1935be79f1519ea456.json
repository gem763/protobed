Since its publication, she has written other books, worked as an adviser to Barack Obama and served as a United Nations ambassador. Her new book is a memoir, \u201cThe Education of an Idealist.\u201d In his review, the Times columnist Thomas L. Friedman writes: \u201cThe interweaving of Power\u2019s personal story, family story, diplomatic history and moral arguments is executed seamlessly \u2014 and with unblinking honesty.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nOn this week\u2019s podcast, Power talks about why she wanted to write this particular book at this particular moment. \u201cThis seemed to me the best way to open up a world that I think has become too cloistered, too inside baseball-y, with foreign policy people talking to each other, government people talking to each other,\u201d she says. She wanted to approach her own experience in a way so that \u201cpeople are swept along with the story but as they go, they then understand the human rights crisis in the world, the refugee crisis in the world and, much more importantly, what one individual can do to try to deal with some of these issues.\u201d\n\nCraig Johnson visits the podcast this week to discuss his series of mystery novels featuring Walt Longmire, which have been turned into the television show \u201cLongmire.\u201d \u201cWhat if you were the sheriff of the least populated county in the least populated state in America?\u201d Johnson says of his inspiration for the Wyoming-set series. \u201cIt would force you to deal more with character and place, which is where I think the best writing comes from.\u201d", "description": "Power talks about her new memoir, \u201cThe Education of an Idealist,\u201d and Craig Johnson discusses his Longmire mysteries.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/27/books/27podcast-cover/27podcast-cover-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
