Sometimes, those bags under your eyes have less to do with the length of sleep you\u2019re getting and more with the actual quality of your sleep.\n\nOver on a recent Reddit thread, users shared how they\u2019ve overcome their sleep quality issues. Below you\u2019ll find several recommendations that might benefit your sleep \u2014 that is, if you\u2019re willing to ditch the smartphone.\n\nRemove all sources of light\n\nFor u/leventnoir, the key to a better night\u2019s rest involves as little light as possible; this means installing blackout curtains and even going so far as to remove all electronics from a bedroom, including alarm clocks and led indicators. (Just remember to set an alarm on your phone, if you go this route.)\n\nIf you aren\u2019t able to do this, u/gnomon75 suggests a comfortable eye mask as an alternative. \u201cIt should have a curve for your nose and extra room for your eyes so that it\u2019s better at completely blocking out light and not leaving gaps like a flat eye mask would.\u201d If you\u2019re sensitive to noise, it might be worth considering earplugs or even a white noise machine \u2014 just be sure you\u2019ll hear your alarm.\n\nConsistency is key\n\nEchoed again and again in the comments is the recommendation to keep your sleeping schedule as consistent as possible if you want to get some quality shut-eye. \u201cSame time to bed, same time out of bed,\u201d u/alakazam writes. \u201cEvery day, even weekends. Right now, I\u2019m getting 7.5 hours of sleep each night, and I feel consistently well-rested and awake in the mornings, which was a pretty big contrast to my grad school days when sleep was inconsistent, even if I slept more on some days.\u201d\n\nIf your days are inconsistent, perhaps it\u2019s time to build a schedule so you can sleep at the same hour without fail.\n\nCut out caffeine\n\nUnsurprisingly, caffeine, as a stimulant, doesn\u2019t bode well for your ability to sleep. (A small study from 2013 found that caffeine consumed six hours before bedtime can still disrupt sleep.) According to u/duostesticuloshabet, it helps to time your caffeine intake appropriately. \u201c... I try my best not have any past noon,\u201d they said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve noticed a significant improvement in my ability to fall asleep and sleep deeply since doing this. Being someone who often works out twice a day between weight training, calisthenics, and running/swimming, it\u2019s easy to forget how much that afternoon pre-workout or energy drink can fuck up your sleep later in the evening.\u201d\n\nLook into a better mattress\n\nIf you aren\u2019t sleeping well, your mattress might be the issue\u2013at least it was in u/dependent_rice\u2019s experience. \u201cI went from sleeping on a cheap IKEA mattress in an iron frame to a boxspring with two mattresses on top and I sleep great every night,\u201d they said. \u201cI fall asleep faster and I have stopped tossing and turning as much.\u201d\n\nNot sure what kind of mattress you\u2019ll need? In another comment, u/msrsnowshoes recommends visiting a retailer and trying out the mattresses instead of using online sellers.\n\nIf the mattress causes you any discomfort anywhere on your body, move onto the next. Otherwise, if you\u2019ve slept at hotels or friends\u2019 places with a mattress you\u2019ve liked, give them a ring and find out the model. You can probably find a similar one at your local retailer (or the same one).\n\nDitch the electronics\n\nYou\u2019ve heard it before, but staring at your smartphone might only worsen poor sleeping habits. \u201cTurning my phone off half an hour before my intended bedtime really helps me stick to when I want to go to bed,\u201d u/midnight_madness8 writes. \u201cI get so distracted otherwise and the process can take twice as long as it should.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s our guide to how to kick yourself off your devices at bedtime. And if you feel tempted to check your Twitter timeline before bed, u/busyminimum recommends leaving it in another room. (And if you\u2019re reading this from bed now, set it down and back away.)\n\nKnow when to see a doctor\n\nIf you\u2019ve tried it all \u2014 or get a full eight hours without feeling any more well-rested \u2014 then maybe it\u2019s time to see a specialist about the problem, u/reditanian recommends.\n\nIf you have any concerns, it\u2019s always best to voice them with a doctor, especially if you\u2019re considering taking supplements to solve the issue. As we\u2019ve written before, melatonin might also help your sleep issues in the short-term, but it\u2019s best to ask a doctor if you\u2019re looking for a long-term answer to your sleep quality problem.", "description": "If you\u2019re someone who can\u2019t ever seem to get a good night\u2019s sleep, and even a later start time to your day won\u2019t help, you\u2019re not alone.
