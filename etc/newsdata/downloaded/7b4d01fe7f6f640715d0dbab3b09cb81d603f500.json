But now that the Trump administration officials have nixed the initiative, the promise may be left unfulfilled.\n\nBack in October 2017, then-VA Secretary David Shulkin decided to add three health conditions \u2013 bladder cancer, Parkinson\u2019s-like symptoms and hypothyroidism \u2013 to the list of diseases eligible to be related to Agent Orange, but White House Officials and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Mick Mulvaney objected, according to documents provided to Military Times.\n\nWhile many of the specifics behind the OMB\u2019s opposition were redacted, the Times' report said the office had concerns that not only was the scientific evidence lacking, but the expansion would have a severe impact on the budget.\n\nIt\u2019s estimated nearly 83,000 veterans are afflicted with one of the three proposed presumptive conditions. The estimated cost for providing disability compensation was also redacted, according to the report.\n\nIn 2016, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (formally known as the Institute of Medicine, IOM) found there was \u201climited or suggestive evidence\u201d linking bladder cancer and hypothyroidism to Agent Orange exposure. That represented an upgrade from a previous recommendation that there was inadequate or insufficient evidence to link the diseases to the toxic herbicides used as defoliants in Vietnam.\n\nThe 2016 IOM report also recommended that veterans with \u201cParkinson\u2019s-like symptoms\u201d \u2013 not just those diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s \u2013 be granted a service-connected presumption that surmises certain disabilities were caused by military service.\n\nThe report came just five months after a provision that was a part of the Agent Orange Act of 1991, which allowed the VA secretary to dictate regulations for \"a presumption of service connection\" for diseases, had expired.\n\nA presumption of service connection is when VA presumes a veteran's disease was caused by their military service, usually due to a certain exposure.\n\nShulkin made the three additions to the Agent Orange list with the knowledge that the provision had expired. At the time, he cited the general authority of the VA and rulings from previous VA secretaries who awarded benefits to prisoners of war for other diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, and osteoporosis, despite the IOM\u2019s claim that more evidence was needed or there was limited proof of any association.\n\nOn Nov. 1, 2017, Shulkin issued a press release in which he stated that he had \u201cmade a decision\u201d on the new presumptive conditions and would conduct a regulatory review.\n\nBut that very same day, Shulkin met with Mulvaney and a veteran\u2019s adviser for Trump\u2019s domestic policy council, who questioned his decision since the 1991 act had expired.\n\nShulkin was eventually ousted in March 2018 and with it, the initiative has sat in limbo ever since.\n\nAccording to Military Times, a briefing delivered in May 2018 to the new acting secretary, Robert Wilkie, stated that the department is waiting for the results of two studies \u2013 the VHA\u2019s Vietnam Veteran Morbidity Study and the Vietnam Mortality Study \u2013 before \u201cre-engaging OMB on prescribing presumptions.\u201d\n\nThe results of those studies were never released. And according to a statement from the VA that was drafted but never released, the VA and the administration determined in \u201clate March (2018) that there is insufficient data and information to overcome the limitations in the scientific support for the rulemaking.\u201d\n\nThe VA\u2019s handling of the amendment to the Agent Orange compensation list is similar to how the federal agency has been handling compensation for veterans made sick due to exposure to a different type of toxin \u2014 toxins that emanated from burn pits.\n\nDuring the wars in both Iraq and Afghanistan, the burn pit method was adopted originally as a temporary measure to get rid of waste and garbage generated on bases. Everything was incinerated in the pits, including plastics, batteries, appliances, medicine, dead animals and even human waste. The items were often set ablaze with jet fuel as the accelerant.\n\nThe pits burned more than 1,000 different chemical compounds day and night, and most service members breathed in toxic fumes with no protection.\n\nA registry was created by the Veterans Administration in 2011, but signing it does not guarantee any form of assistance. Service members and their families concerned with the effects of burn-pit exposure say that they struggle to keep up with the high cost of medical treatments. There are more than 180,000 names signed to the VA registry, but it is estimated that 3.5 million veterans have been exposed to burn pits.\n\nThe Investigative Unit at Fox News has reported extensively on the issues surrounding veterans made sick from their exposure to burn pits, and the lack of assistance once they fell ill.\n\nSince 2016, our reporting has led to scores of interviews with veterans and their families, as well as those who warned military officials during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan about the dangers of burn pits at bases like the Operating Base Marez in Mosul, Iraq. They also included inspectors who answered directly to the Pentagon and urged them to stop using the flawed method for trash disposal.\n\nFox News' Investigative Unit also interviewed General David Petraeus, who was in charge of the U.S. military campaign during the time the burn pits were being used.\n\nThis past winter, the Investigative Unit also reported the Department of Defense provided a full list of military installations that have water near or around them that contain harmful levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances or PFAS.\n\nDubbed \u201cforever chemicals,\u201d these man-made substances do not break down, like plastic. They accumulate over time in the environment and some can linger in the human body for years.\n\nIn June 2018, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) released a report the White House deemed a \u201cpublic relations nightmare.\u201d That report linked PFAS to various cancers, thyroid defects and pregnancy complications at levels lower than the EPA\u2019s drinking water health advisory.\n\nAn internal White House email is quoted as saying, \u201cThe public, media, and Congressional reaction to these numbers is going to be huge. The impact to EPA and [the Defense Department] is going to be extremely painful. We (DoD and EPA) cannot seem to get ATSDR to realize the potential public relations nightmare this is going to be.\u201d\n\nFox News\u2019 Georeen Tanner contributed reporting to this story.", "description": "Military service members looking for compensation after their exposure to the herbicide and defoliant chemical\u00a0known as\u00a0Agent Orange during the Vietnam War are still fighting an uphill battle.", "authors": ["Perry Chiaramonte", "Perry Chiaramonte Is A Producer With Fox News Channel'S Investigative Unit.
