I\u2019m totally fine! No idea what happened. So sorry . But so proud of @mikebreakfast for carrying on and delivering \u201cthe dolphin\u201d!\u2019 she wrote.\n\nFYI I did it again on purpose in Claudia\u2019s area! And im def not drunk as some people think. \u2014 katya Jones (@Mrs_katjones) October 5, 2019\n\nThe star added: \u2018FYI I did it again on purpose in Claudia\u2019s area! And im def not drunk as some people think.\u2019\n\nMike and Katya, who seem to have been taking no prisoners in their rehearsals, scored 22 for their dance, which saw the journalist sliding down a fireman\u2019s pole before ripping off the uniform to reveal his glittery outfit.\n\nPeak Strictly and we love it.\n\nKatya insisted it wasn\u2019t Mike\u2019s fault (Picture: BBC)\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time viewers have been glued to his routine, after they spotted him eating a banana completely wrong in his week two dance.\n\nThe BBC Breakfast presenter had an actual banana in his pocket during his American Smooth. And that wasn\u2019t even the strangest moment of the dance.\n\nThe 53-year-old then proceeded to chomp down on the fruit \u2013 sideways.\n\nWe\u2019re not sure what\u2019s going on in the slightest, but we\u2019re obsessed.\n\nStrictly Come Dancing returns Sunday at 7.15 on BBC One.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
