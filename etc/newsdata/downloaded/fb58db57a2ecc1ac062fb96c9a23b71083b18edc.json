The beer company endorsed by King in his sign subsequently cut ties with him, and readers of the Register were enraged that the paper had dug up King\u2019s tweets from almost a decade ago.\n\nOnce it was revealed that Calvin had a history of offensive tweets himself, the paper became the subject of ridicule on social media.", "description": "The\u00a0Des Moines Register has parted ways with reporter Aaron Calvin after controversy involving Calvin's Twitter history.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Andrew C.
