FCA doesn't get access to the technology or share in the revenue, but it gets them in the game.\n\nAs a hedge, FCA in 2017 also joined a BMW/Intel partnership to develop semi-automated and self-driving car technology.\n\nWhat's next: For electric cars, FCA could easily team up with a company like Volkswagen, Navigant Research's Sam Abuelsamid tells Axios.\n\nThe bottom line: There are other ways FCA can access the necessary technologies while maintaining its independence and coddling its crown jewels: Jeep and Ram.", "description": "\"Why does the car company have to own it?\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/g5Ng9BJ9FL_jTGfjiz0qcVpnj_o=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/06/06/1559855527754.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-07"}
