I mean, they try to say something she just walks off.'\n\nThe footage shows the middle school student brushing by the principal following a verbal confrontation (pictured)\n\nFootage shows Christensen pulling the 11-year-old girl's backpack off\n\nHe then wrestles her to the ground as he tries to handcuff her while she resists\n\nThe unidentified student suffered a concussion and has arm and shoulder pain due to the incident, according to the girl's family who are now taking legal action.\n\nIn the video, Christensen can be heard saying, 'You can't push him out of the way.
