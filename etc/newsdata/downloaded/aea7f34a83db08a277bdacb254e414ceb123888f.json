Several other Buddhist statues, including one called \"Buddha's Footprint\" stand nearby.\n\nSomjit Raepeth, a member of Khao Kala group or UFO Khao Kala, a group that believes that the area possesses supernatural qualities, told the Post in 2015 that members practice strict Buddhist principles and were able to contact aliens from Pluto and another planet called Logu Kata Paka Tigong, located somewhere in the Milky Way.\n\n\"They have high virtues and morals,\" she told the Post. \"The only way to make contact with them is to practice dhamma (Buddhist teachings) to the highest levels.\"\n\nAccording to CNN, followers of the ideology believe that people can hear the aliens through meditation, and have described the aliens as \"slender, little, silvery humanoids.\"\n\nSome followers have reported seeing UFOs and silhouettes of figures on the hilltop, while others say they were actually spun around by alien powers.\n\nThere is no substantive evidence that the site has supernatural or alien qualities, or, of course, that aliens exist.\n\nRead more: How Area 51 became the center of alien conspiracy theories\n\nWassana Chuensamnaun, a lead campaigner for the extraterrestrials, told CNN that aliens from Pluto \"are made of energy\" and have expressed concern about devastation on Earth.\n\nLoku aliens, he says, have \"knowledge of high technology\" and present in physical form. He says Pluto's alien leader claimed Buddha was the \"greatest human mind.\"\n\nAccording to local daily Khao Sod, a member of UFO Khao Kala predicted that World War III would break out by 2022. Wassana told CNN that aliens have promised to take care of a select few \"survivors\" in the event of such fallout.\n\nRead more: Before Area 51, the US' first 'UFO' controversy uncovered a top-secret military project\n\nAuthorities have not taken kindly to the overcrowding of tourists on the hilltop, which houses several Buddhist holy sites.\n\nIn August, they raided the UFO sighting spot out of concern that travelers were jeopardizing the protected forests in the area by camping out and holding activities. In September, authorities and forestry officials returned again and confronted Wassana, along with others at the site, according to CNN.\n\n\"If we find anyone guilty of wrongdoing, we will file a criminal case against them.\n\n\"If a UFO descends and parks here, that's even better. We'll capture them all,\" Police Maj. Gen. Damrong Petpong told Khao Sod in August.\n\nNOW WATCH: Sfenj is a popular street food in Africa", "description": "A group of Buddhist worshippers on a remote hilltop in Thailand believe that aliens from Pluto communicate with people in the area.", "authors": ["Rosie Perper"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0U44g8KhDT9cTmLGjLR5tQ--~B/aD02NDM7dz0xMjg2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/insider_articles_922/460ae1c070de8fc0a26cd803f2d2eac4", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
