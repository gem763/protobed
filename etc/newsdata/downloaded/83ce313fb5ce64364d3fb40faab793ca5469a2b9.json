Mr Johnson, 40, told them \"Aziz,\" his Islamic name pronounced ah-zeez. He has used it for 25 years - and \"countless\" times at that particular store.\n\nBut three unusual things happened on this occasion, he said. When his order was ready, a staffer announced them by drink type, not his name.\n\nThe second unusual part was the employee wrote his name as \"ISIS\" - the acronym for the Islamic terror group - in the printout attached to all three drinks.\n\nMr Johnson didn't even realise it until later, when a friend pointed it out at a bookstore.\n\n\"I was shocked and angry. I felt it was discrimination,\" Mr Johnson told The Washington Post on Friday.\n\nThe third unusual part: Four days later, after the story hit social media and a reporter tweeted about it, Starbucks called Mr Johnson to claim the company had already rectified the situation in conversation with Mr Johnson's niece - a person he says doesn't exist.\n\nIt is not the first time the global chain has faced accusations of racism and discrimination in a Philadelphia store. Last year, an employee called police on two black men sitting in a downtown location, and they were led away in handcuffs.\n\nRead more\n\nPolice officer held up racist signs next to sleeping train passengers\n\nThe incident prompted an apology from CEO Kevin Johnson and national staff training on unconscious bias at 8,000 stores.\n\nBut this corporate response has been different, with representatives downplaying these new allegations.\n\n\"After investigating, we don't believe this was a case of discrimination or profiling,\" Starbucks spokesman Reggie Borges said in a statement. \"The customer approached and provided the name Aziz. The barista mistakenly spelled it incorrectly. We have connected with Mr Johnson and apologised for this regrettable mistake.\"\n\nIn an earlier statement, Mr Borges said Starbucks contacted his \"family\" to apologise.\n\nExcept, Mr Johnson said, it didn't happen that way.\n\nA Starbucks district manager who called Mr Johnson Thursday night said the company believed the issue had been resolved earlier in the week after speaking with a niece of Mr Johnson's named Alora.", "description": "In the same city where a Starbucks employee last year called police on black men for sitting quietly, two men in Islamic dress walked into a different Starbucks store for a drink.Niquel Johnson paid for three drinks in Philadelphia on Sunday, and in typical Starbucks fashion, an employee asked for his", "authors": ["Alex Horton", "Abigail Hauslohner"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/suSbQxkCPLatRsSygCYDig--~B/aD0xNjgzO3c9MjI0NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/d5b62230ad4d5b4e8b7700d0971f6a64"}
