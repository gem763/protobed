Those are old names for the streets, abolished in 1879, still enshrined on a Georgetown Visitation building that predates the change. (John Kelly/The Washington Post)\n\nColumnist\n\nBuilt into the masonry of the Georgetown Visitation convent is a marble marker indicating the cross-streets of another era. Those earlier streets, at what is now 35th and P streets NW, were apparently Third Street and Fayette Street. Georgetown predates the Federal City. At some point, evidently, the District of Columbia absorbed Old Georgetown and rewrote the street names. What is the story around that? And have you ever addressed the provenance of Volta Place, a street not far away?\n\n\u2014 Rocky Semmes, Alexandria\n\n\n\nAnswer Man loves seeing parts of the past that persevere in the present. Georgetown is a good place to glimpse such palimpsests, which include the cobbles and streetcar tracks on O and P streets.\n\nThose two thoroughfares, like many in Georgetown, used to have different names. You can see two of those earlier monikers set in the bricks of the Georgetown Visitation Monastery building. P Street was once Third Street. And what today is 35th Street was Fayette Street. (Why Fayette? It was in honor of celebrated Frenchman Marquis de Lafayette, as are most geographical places named Fayette in the United States.)\n\nGeorgetown was its own thriving city when Congress decided in 1791 to incorporate it within the 10-square-mile diamond that would become the U.S. capital. Georgetown continued as its own place within the District of Columbia, an entity that also included Washington City (the largely federal enclave), Washington County (the area beyond the city) and, until retrocession in 1847, Alexandria and Alexandria County.\n\nSome of Georgetown\u2019s original street names were a reflection of where they were, such as Water Street, just up from the Potomac River. (Today, it\u2019s K Street.) But in 1871, Congress revoked Georgetown\u2019s charter. Eight years later, Georgetown started renaming its streets and renumbering its addresses. Among the changes: Fayette became 35th Street and Third Street became P Street.\n\n\n\nWhat had been Fourth Street, and then Q Street, became Volta Place in Georgetown. It was named in honor of the work of Alexander Graham Bell, winner of the Volta Prize, who kept a lab on that street. (John Kelly/The Washington Post)\n\nMore changes occurred in 1895, when Georgetown was officially consolidated into Washington. By then, developers were building homes in Washington\u2019s \u201csuburbs\u201d \u2014 meaning its outer neighborhoods \u2014 and the city was trying to impose uniform street nomenclature across the board.\n\nIn Georgetown, 32nd Street became Wisconsin Avenue. Some streets that had received new names in 1879 were renamed again. For example, Q Street, which had been Fourth Street, would henceforth be Volta Place.\n\nWhy Volta? Well, that story is downright electrifying.\n\nIn a roundabout way, the street takes its name from Italy\u2019s Alessandro Volta (1745-1827). He was a science prodigy, even if he didn\u2019t speak until he was 4. (His first word? \u201cNo.\u201d)\n\nVolta did many things \u2014 he isolated the gas methane \u2014 but is most closely associated with electricity. He discovered he could create and store electricity by sandwiching zinc and copper plates with disks of brine-soaked fabric. This was the first battery. Volta\u2019s name lives on in one of the units we use to measure electricity: the volt.\n\nVolta conducted his experiments at a time when world leaders believed in science. He was celebrated by Napoleon Bonaparte, and in 1852, Napoleon\u2019s nephew, Napoleon III, established the Volta Prize in his honor. Awardees received 50,000 francs for contributions to the study of electricity.\n\nIn 1880, the Volta Prize was awarded to Alexander Graham Bell, inventor of the telephone. A year earlier, Bell had moved from Massachusetts to Washington, home of his wife Mabel\u2019s family.\n\nWith money from his prize, Bell established the Volta Laboratory at 1221 Connecticut Ave. NW. There, he and his associates worked on sound-recording technology. Bell was interested in human speech and deafness \u2014 he met his wife at a school for the deaf where he taught \u2014 and in 1894, he dedicated a striking building at 35th and Q streets NW. It housed the Volta Bureau, \u201cfor the increase and diffusion of knowledge relating to the deaf.\u201d\n\nIn 1905, Q Street there was changed to Volta Place as a tribute to Bell\u2019s work. (Present-day Q Street is one block north of Volta Place.)\n\nChanging a street\u2019s name can rile people up. Witness the current discussion over turning Good Hope Road into Marion S. Barry Jr. Avenue. In 1901, The Post noted that many residents \u201chave a feeling of personal injury when any attempt is made to take away the old name or to foist a new one upon them in which they have no interest or which is actually distasteful to them.\u201d\n\nSome in Georgetown never forgot. In 1951, the Georgetown Citizens Association asked the city\u2019s commissioners to restore the old street names. \u201cO Street,\u201d they argued, was boring compared to its original name: \u201cBeall Street.\u201d That name came from George Beall, one of the owners of the land upon which Georgetown was built.\n\nThe commissioners declined to restore the names.\n\nTwitter: @johnkelly\n\nFor previous columns, visit washingtonpost.com/john-kelly.", "description": "Don\u2019t look for an address on Fayette Street.
