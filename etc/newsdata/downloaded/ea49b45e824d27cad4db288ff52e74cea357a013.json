Mrs Bland, as she was known for most of her life (a misnomer if ever there was one), was one of the great children\u2019s writers, responsible for The Railway Children, the Bastable series (which included The Wouldbegoods) and the Psammead series, in which a bad-tempered \u201csand fairy\u201d livens up the novels Five Children and It, The Phoenix and the Carpet and The Story of the Amulet.\n\nIt\u2019s not just that Nesbit\u2019s books are brilliant: her life is also brilliant material for one. She was in person at once quite awe-inspiring and a bit of a nightmare, able to weather tragedy and yet a queen of melodrama, a self-supporting writer who opposed women\u2019s suffrage. Vibrantly attractive and adored by her many proteges and readers, she was what they called in those days \u201cadvanced\u201d \u2013 a committed socialist (she and her husband Hubert Bland were among the earliest members of the Fabian Society) who wore free-flowing clothes, gave charitably and wrote ferociously against poverty, and let her children play barefoot in the garden. Her home at Well Hall, in Eltham, was a lively hub for young writers, artists and Fabians; a place, HG Wells recalled, \u201cto which one rushed down from town at the week-end to snatch one\u2019s bed before anyone else got it\u201d. She was generous with her time, her money and her husband.\n\nNesbit put her success down to being one of those people who feel \u201cthat they are children in a grown-up world\u201d; her stories certainly read as if written for equals. In the Psammead novels, there is a delightful mix of the recognisable \u2013 Camden Town, the British Museum \u2013 and the magical; it is as if by grounding her fiction firmly in a real world, Nesbit makes the fantasy seem all the more tantalisingly possible. In her readable and thorough biography, Eleanor Fitzsimons presents a real life of high drama and storytelling.\n\nNesbit\u2019s own childhood was largely happy but nomadic. Her father, a distinguished chemist and teacher, died in 1862 when Edith was three, and from then the family moved around in reduced circumstances, taking regular trips abroad to cope with the ill health of an older sister, Mary, who died young. In 1880, the 21-year-old Edith married Bland, then a bank clerk. He was tall and athletic, powerful seeming. The description left by George Bernard Shaw, a close friend of the couple during their early marriage, makes Bland sound like a bully; nevertheless he was popular with women. He had already impregnated one fiancee by the time they met. Nesbit herself was seven months pregnant when they married; their son, Paul, was born that summer. Two more children, Iris and Fabian, followed. Bland was never good with money; Nesbit supported the family by writing and by decorating greetings cards.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest From left: Sally Thomsett, Jenny Agutter and Gary Warren in the 1970 film of The Railway Children.

Fitzsimons makes this connection and her book is interesting in showing how Nesbit\u2019s lifelong socialist principles found expression in her children\u2019s books. Yet perhaps the biographer is too insistent on drawing links between the life and the fiction. It is true that Nesbit\u2019s characters are often semi-orphans, but then any children\u2019s writer worth their salt knows that absent, or at least supremely negligent, parents are a prerequisite for a decent adventure. Fitzsimons does not always allow for the complex workings of fantasy, craft and imagination in the fiction \u2013 elements that are just as relevant, one suspects, in Nesbit\u2019s approach to life.\n\nThe household was apparently always embroiled in \u201cscenes\u201d; it\u2019s hard to tell what was for show and what was suffering. Shortly after Iris\u2019s birth, Nesbit discovered that Bland\u2019s relationship with his previous fiancee was still going on (she had no idea about Edith). On his nights away from home, Nesbit\u2019s friend, Alice Hoatson, kept her company. When a devastated Nesbit suffered a stillbirth, it was Hoatson who had to prise the dead baby from her arms; before long she had moved in permanently. They told people she had joined them because she was seriously ill; in fact she was heavily pregnant. Nesbit agreed to raise the child, a girl named Rosamund, as her own. It is unclear when she discovered that Bland was the baby\u2019s father. Rosamund would later claim that Nesbit only found out six months after the birth and would have thrown the pair out if Bland hadn\u2019t threatened to leave with them. Others assumed that Nesbit had always known and may even have engineered the affair to get her husband away from a lover she disliked. She had her own intense romantic friendships \u2013 Shaw being one \u2013 yet Fitzsimons concludes that these were probably platonic. After all, she notes drily, Bland \u201cheld women to a high moral standard\u201d.\n\nShe suspects his views were also behind Nesbit\u2019s stance on female suffrage. (Bland\u2019s opinion: \u201cVotes for Women? Votes for children! Votes for dogs!\u201d) She once delivered a speech titled \u201cNatural Disabilities of Women\u201d to an appalled audience of the Fabian Women\u2019s Group, which had invited her to speak on women and work. And yet work she did, writing more than 40 books. It\u2019s one of the odd contradictions that Fitzsimons wisely does not attempt to resolve: that this bright, talented woman would cling to deeply traditional ideas about her place and vulnerabilities, and was apparently in thrall to a bullish hypocrite. Or perhaps she was engaged in a bold experiment in living. Another way of understanding the menage a trois between Bland, Nesbit and Hoatson (who would have a second child with Bland, a son they pretended was Nesbit\u2019s) is as a fruitful and longlasting collaboration between the two women. Nesbit was already an acclaimed poet by the time her children\u2019s stories, often serialised in the Strand magazine, began to improve the family\u2019s fortunes. The first Bastable book, The Story of the Treasure Seekers, appeared in 1899. The still-precarious family finances depended on Bland and Nesbit (they sometimes collaborated) churning out articles, stories and novels. Hoatson\u2019s management of the home and children freed Nesbit to create. She generally set the tone. Her moods could plunge the whole household into gloom just as she enlivened everything when she was happy. Most agreed that Nesbit and Bland thrived on all the drama.\n\nBut in 1900, the family came to grief when 15-year-old Fabian died after an operation to remove his adenoids. The whole episode puts the grown-ups in a bad light. Nesbit seems to have forgotten that the doctor was even coming: she had to be roused from her bed when he arrived at 11am to perform the procedure. It\u2019s possible that Fabian hadn\u2019t been warned not to eat beforehand \u2013 an omission that may have caused his death. Nesbit was, Fitzsimons writes, \u201cdemented with grief\u201d. She threw herself into work and her popularity grew. \u201cTake a book by E Nesbit into any family of boys and girls,\u201d a contemporary noted, \u201cand they fall upon it like wolves.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Sarah Watling\u2019s Noble Savages: The Olivier Sisters is published by Cape.
