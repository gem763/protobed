( SFIX ) reported its fiscal fourth-quarter results Tuesday evening. The online clothing retailer beat fiscal fourth-quarter earnings expectations but issued a weaker-than-expected revenue forecast for the first quarter.\n\nSFIX is trading down more than 10% in early trading Wednesday. Let's check out the stitching the charts and indicators.\n\nIn the daily bar chart of SFIX, below, we can see that prices have been up and down and down and up in a pretty wild trading affair the past 12 months. Gaps to the downside and the upside have not made it easy to navigate. Currently prices are below the declining 50-day and the bearish 200-day moving average lines.\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line is mostly bearish but a number of volume surges has temporarily shifted the OBV line. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is bearish.\n\nIn the limited weekly bar chart of SFIX, below, we can see that prices are below the flat 40-week moving average line. The weekly OBV line is pointed down and the MACD oscillator on this longer time frame is also bearish.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of SFIX, below, we can see an upside price target of $25 but prices are going to first retest the recent lows. This chart does not really look constructive until prices trade at $22.34.\n\nBottom-line strategy: Things are not fitting well for SFIX, technically speaking.
