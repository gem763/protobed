On one side it says 'daughter of the king' written in hieroglyphs.\n\nThe burial complex, which once had a pyramid above it, was uncovered in 2017. The pyramid eroded away after the precious limestone covering was removed, leaving the mud-stones exposed to the elements\n\nAmerican archaeologist Mark Lehner pictured with the black pyramid. He goes on the first filmed tour inside the structure in Channel 4's Egypt's Lost Pyramid programme which airs on Sunday at 8pm\n\nThe assertion that this is Princess Hatshepset's tomb comes from an inscription on the box containing the canopic jars, reports Live Science.\n\nThe mystery of two tombs for one Pharaoh When the tomb in Dahshur was first discovered, it was initially attributed to Pharaoh Amey Quema due to a symbol on the tomb. This was bizarre, as his actual tomb had already been found a mile away - leading to suggestions that it was a decoy. However, when archaeologists opened the tomb they discovered human remains inside, and then a symbol on the box containing the canopic jars saying that the box contained the remains of the 'pharaoh's daughter'. This has led to the theory that it is the tomb of Princess Hatshepset.\n\nAt the end of the programme Egyptologist Dr Chris Morgan makes the startling claim that the tomb may have been raided before the door was sealed, suggesting that priests may have been involved.\n\nShe died towards the end of the Middle Kingdom, which dates from 2030 to 1782 BC.\n\nAs the period drew to a close, Egypt lost control of Lower Nubia and experienced bouts of famine and political unrest.\n\nWhile the 13th dynasty, during which Ameny Qemau ruled briefly, was reasonably prosperous, the Second Intermediate Period may have been impoverished, according to archaeologists.\n\nHer tomb is less than a mile from her father's, according to the programme, which has been nicknamed the 'black pyramid'.\n\nThe structure itself now looks like a pile of rubble, as the precious limestone was removed from the outside, leaving the mud-brick interior exposed to the elements.\n\nThe American archaeologist pictured inside the black pyramid. It contained three chambers, for the Pharaoh and his two wives, it was also raided.\n\nBeneath there are winding corridors to confuse raiders along with three separate hidden chambers for the Pharaoh and his two queens.\n\nDespite their efforts, these were also raided by tomb robbers. Only the box that held the canopic jars belonging to one of the Queen's remained, which would have held her stomach, lungs, liver and intestines.\n\nEgypt's Lost Pyramid airs Sunday at 8pm on Channel 4", "description": "Archaeologists have revealed the face of an Egyptian princess that lived almost 4,000 years ago.
