They are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated POLITICAL, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Charlie Savage\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 Goals\n\nGiven everything we know about the Senate, how likely is it that Trump will be removed from office? Is pursuing an impeachment inquiry to remove Trump from power more of an effort to effectively remove him from office or is it more useful in promoting a negative view of the president in the eyes of the public?\n\n\u2014 Daniel Vance, Washington\n\nConsidering the Republican majority in the Senate, it seems very unlikely that Mr. Trump would be convicted in that chamber if ultimately impeached by the House because it would require 67 votes to remove him. That means a minimum of 20 Republicans would have to break to join all 47 Democrats to oust the president. Senate Republicans have been mainly steadfast in their support of the president thus far.", "description": "Our journalists in Washington responded to readers\u2019 questions about the Ukraine dispute and the impeachment process.", "authors": ["The New York Times"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/26/us/politics/26readers_impeachment_questions/26readers_impeachment_questions-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
