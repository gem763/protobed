Cox III) and his identification of himself in the town-hall meeting as working for \u201ca real estate investment firm in Dallas,\u201d the Free Beacon found a person of that name and occupation and living in the Dallas area in Federal Election Commission filings.\n\n\u201cA \u2018Morgan Cox III\u2019 from Plano, Tex., who listed his occupation as \u2018investor\u2019 donated the legal maximum of $2,700 to Warren\u2019s Senate primary campaign in 2017, followed by two donations totaling $2,700 to her general election campaign the following year. Cox also donated $2,700 to the Elizabeth Warren Action Fund PAC,\u201d the Free Beacon wrote.\n\nFEC records show several other donations to liberal candidates by that person, but none to any other 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls.\n\nThe Free Beacon said CNN did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMs. Warren\u2019s answer to Mr. Cox\u2019s question provided one of the highlights of the town-hall forum of 2020 Democrats, which CNN co-sponsored with the Human Rights Campaign.\n\nMr. Cox asked how she\u2019d respond to someone who told her that he was \u201cold-fashioned and my faith teaches me that marriage is between one man and one woman.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThen just marry one woman. I\u2019m cool with that,\u201d Ms. Warren implied, then added to huge laughter, \u201cAssuming you can find one.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
