Max Rose: Why I oppose Trump impeachment", "language": "en", "text": "But there\u2019s far too much work left to be done and we are in danger of losing the trust of the American people if we choose partisan warfare over improving the lives of hardworking families. I made a promise to my constituents to focus on making their lives better, and I won\u2019t break it.\n\nThere is no doubt that this Administration is one of the most corrupt in history. From taxpayer dollars propping up Trump Organization properties to the mass exodus of Administration officials who have been forced to resign, are facing serious ethical investigations, or have sped through the revolving door to become federal lobbyists for the same industries they oversaw. It\u2019s clear as day, the swamp is alive and thriving.\n\nBut pursuing a partisan impeachment process won\u2019t address any of those serious issues. The truth is impeachment will only tear our country further apart and we will see no progress on the enormous challenges we face as a nation. Impeachment will not fix our roads and bridges or lower the costs of drugs. Impeachment will not keep our kids safe from gun violence or end the opioid epidemic. Impeachment will not improve the lives of the hardworking Staten Islanders and South Brooklynites that I fight for every day.", "description": "", "authors": ["Si Live", "Silive.Com News Rep-Max-Rose-Why-I-Oppose-Trump-Impeachment.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
