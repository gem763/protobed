A CBP document showed maps of where the new wall is likely to be built.\n\nBy the end of 2020, the agency aims to have completed 141 miles of brand-new wall, along with 273 miles of replacement wall, for a total of more than 400 miles of border barriers.\n\nThe funding for the project in Texas comes from congressional appropriations and is separate from construction funding authorized via an emergency order by President Trump. Border Protection estimated that each mile of wall costs about $17 million dollars.\n\nThere are advocacy groups that oppose new wall construction.\n\nSome of the opponents do so on environmental grounds, worrying that walls block animals from crossing the border, and that the barriers could trap animals between the Rio Grande and the wall in the event of a flood.\n\nOthers said a wall supports an intolerant immigration system.\n\n\u201cWe adamantly reject this move by the Republican House leadership to hand over more than a billion dollars in taxpayer money for a monument to intolerance,\u201d said UnidosUS, a Latino nonprofit advocacy group.\n\nBut Border Protection and others said a wall is crucial for giving America control over its borders.\n\nIn the fiscal year 2019, more than 800,000 people have been illegally apprehended while crossing America\u2019s southern border, CBP said.\n\nSupporters of tighter border controls cheered the construction as the latest in a string of good news about strengthening border security.\n\n\u201cThe apprehension numbers have been going down since the peak in May,\u201d Krikorian said. Illegal crossings hit new records this past summer, but by September had fallen below 2016 levels for that month, according to CBP.\n\n\u201cMexico is doing a better job of stopping people,\u201d Krikorian said, also noting that the Trump administration has been closing the \u201ccatch and release\u201d loophole by requiring asylum applicants to wait in Mexico while their cases are pending.\n\nMexico agreed to an arrangement to allow the U.S. to send foreign nationals to Mexico to wait after Trump said he would impose tariffs. Mexico also dramatically increased its own border protection, sending nearly 15,000 troops to its northern border to apprehend migrants before they crossed.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nKrikorian said that while he\u2019d like for even more wall to have gone up, he understands that lawsuits and land use rights have slowed the progress.\n\nMaxim Lott is executive producer of Stossel TV and creator of ElectionBettingOdds.com.
