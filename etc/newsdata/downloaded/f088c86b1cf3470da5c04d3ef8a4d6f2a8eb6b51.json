Instead, they have to rely on police.\n\nBut Transport Secretary Grant Shapps yesterday told MPs he was ready to grant all councils the right to issue penalty charges for the infringements. The move will raise fears that motorists will be treated as cash cows to fill gaps in council budgets.\n\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps told MPs he was ready to grant all councils the right to issue penalty charges\n\nThe Commons transport committee warned earlier this year that police are too thinly stretched to enforce everyday traffic violations.\n\nThe MPs suggested councils should be allowed to issue fines, with the proceeds spent on tackling congestion and improving bus services. Mr Shapps told the committee yesterday: \u2018I have been looking at powers outside of London provided to local areas to do some of these things, and think that... I\u2019ll shortly be making an announcement.\u2019\n\nUnder the Traffic Management Act 2004, councils can apply for powers to tackle parking, bus lane contraventions and moving traffic violations \u2013 rather than police.\n\nWhile the parking and bus lane powers have been taken up widely by councils, generating millions of pounds a year in revenue, those for moving traffic violations have not.\n\nTransport for London has been enforcing yellow box junction contraventions in the capital for over 15 years. Road campaigners accuse the agency of targeting drivers to generate income from its \u00a3130 fines.\n\nNicholas Lyes of the RAC said: \u2018Local authorities know where congestion might require some form of enforcement, particularly in the case of box junctions, so it stands to reason they should be able to improve this through the use of enforcement.\n\nWhile the parking and bus lane powers have been taken up widely by councils, generating millions of pounds a year in revenue, those for moving traffic violations have not (file image, Cardiff, 2014)\n\n\u2018However, we remain concerned that cash-strapped authorities may see this as an opportunity to extract more revenue from drivers.\u2019\n\nIn the 2017/18 financial year TfL collected up to \u00a316million in fines for yellow box offences. But in many cases drivers claim they had no choice but to stop \u2013 either because of poor traffic light sequencing, or because of drivers ahead of them blocking their path.\n\nThe only council outside London which has the powers is Cardiff.", "description": "Most local authorities outside London are unable to fine drivers for 'moving traffic violations'.
