James \u201cAce\u201d Lyons, who died last year at 91, was angry.\n\nCharged with drawing up a war plan in 1979 to compel the Islamic Republic of Iran to release the 52 hostages it had taken, Lyons sought to impose maximum pressure on the regime. Revolution, hostage-taking, and the departure of foreign investors had decimated their economy. What little cash Iran had came from oil, most of which it exported from a few off-shore terminals. More than 90% of Iranian oil exports came from the Kharg Island terminal, for example. Lyons\u2019 idea was simple: Take Iranian oil infrastructure offline and blockade Iranian ports until revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini released American hostages. Seizing key ports to compel a change of Iranian policy was an idea with historical precedent dating back to the 1856-57 Anglo-Persian War .\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter, however, had different ideas. National Security Council aide Gary Sick reportedly (according to those present) leaked word that the White House crisis response group had decided to take military action off the table; Carter preferred to try to negotiate the hostages\u2019 release.\n\nIn hindsight, Lyons\u2019 approach may have been better: When Iranian hostage-takers heard they faced no military action, they upped their demands and what was initially thought of as a 48- to 72-hour episode transformed into 444 days.\n\nThere are many outstanding questions about the latest attack on Saudi infrastructure, most notably whether Houthis in Yemen or a Shi\u2019ite militia in Iraq launched the drones (Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Iraq was not to blame). Ultimately, that question is secondary: Iran\u2019s ties to both the Houthis in Yemen and several (not all) Shi\u2019ite militias in Iraq are extensive. In January 2015, Ali Shirazi, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei\u2019s representative to the Qods Force, declared, \u201cThe Houthis are a version of Hezbollah, and this group will use the stage for confronting the enemies of Islam.\u201d Five months later, Khamenei addressed the question of Iran\u2019s Houthi support directly. \u201cWe support them within the scope of our capabilities because it is our responsibility to do so,\u201d he said.\n\nThat either accelerates attacks into Saudi Arabia is indicative that they are acting as Iran\u2019s proxies, for such moves are neither in Yemen nor Iraq\u2019s interests. If, on one-hand, the drone strikes were Houthi \u2014 repeating with drones what the Yemeni Shi\u2019ite movement had earlier tried with missiles \u2014 it deflates Western pressure to withdraw support for Saudi Arabia\u2019s war efforts inside Yemen just at a time when momentum seemed to have turned against Riyadh. If, on the other hand, the drone strikes originated in Iraq, it confirms the worst assessments of Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi\u2019s effectiveness and sincerity, makes Iraq a legitimate target for Iran\u2019s opponents, and risks a perception that Iraq is turning into the equivalent of Hezbollah-run southern Lebanon. Rather, it seems that Iran is utilizing proxies and drones in an asymmetric attempt to collapse Saudi Arabia\u2019s economy.\n\nTo assume that Saudi Arabia, however, will subject itself to such a game is risky, for Saudi authorities understand Tehran\u2019s goals. It may also be a false assumption on Tehran\u2019s part to assume that Saudi Arabia will not respond directly. Just as Saudi Arabia is vulnerable (the Red Sea port of Yanbu, for example) stands out at night against the desert like a lone Christmas tree against black velvet, Iran\u2019s oil infrastructure is extraordinarily vulnerable.\n\nSanctions are reversable \u2014 the complete destruction of Kharg or Iran\u2019s few other outlets would render the question of sanctions largely moot.\n\nSaudi authorities might curtail oil supply as a wake-up call to both the East and West, forcing the U.S. Congress, for example, to consider just what it would mean if Iran or its proxies controlled the Bab el-Mandeb. With Iranian-backed aggression increasing, however, the Saudi military might have another plan for Iran.\n\nMichael Rubin (@Mrubin1971) is a contributor to the Washington Examiner's Beltway Confidential blog.
