This is no small task. So for guidance, I recently talked with Chris Retzler, who has managed the Needham Small Cap Growth Fund NESGX, +0.00% since the financial crisis.\n\nRetzler, a former Fulbright scholar who went to Columbia Business School a few years after I was there, is the kind of money manager I\u2019m happy to learn from because he posts great returns. So far this year his fund is up 36.5%, compared to 20% for the S&P 500 SPX, -0.31% , 23% for COMP, -0.28% and 17% for the Russell 2000 RUT, +0.41% .\n\nOutperformance over eight months can be a fluke, so it\u2019s better to look at longer time frames when weighing the expertise of a fund manager. Retzler\u2019s fund beats its Morningstar small-cap growth category by 4.6 percentage points annualized over the past three years, and 2.8 percentage points over the last five years.\n\nHere are six companies that are plays on three trends Retzler likes to invest in. All of these names have the key attributes Retzler looks for in companies. These include quality boards and management with the right compensation incentives and stock ownership levels, and products with protective moats.\n\nTrend #1: 5G\n\nWhile many analysts and consumers remain skeptical that 5G will be a big deal \u2014 and we have been waiting a long time \u2014 Retzler has no doubt. After all, 5G holds a lot of promise. It will deliver speeds anywhere from 10 to 40 times faster than current 4G LTE wireless networks. Lower latency supports new cool stuff like augmented reality, self-driving cars, and cloud gaming.\n\nBank of America Merrill Lynch predicts 5G phone shipments will rise to 130 million in 2020 and 327 million in 2021, from 17 million this year.\n\nRetzler thinks the 5G infrastructure build out, which is already under way, will pick up in earnest in 2020. If he\u2019s right, this is a good time to get exposure because the stock market often starts pricing in trends about six months in advance.\n\nTo reap profits from the 5G build out, Retzler favors companies that supply components like radio-frequency chips used in the gear that will power 5G and 5G phones. He also likes companies that sell equipment used to build those components.\n\nRetzler cites the chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing TSM, -0.31% here. The company posted 10% sequential revenue growth in the second quarter. Sales advanced 25% during August compared to July, and 16.5% over August 2018.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor says key sources of revenue growth ahead include 5G development and premium smartphone launches, many of which will see solid demand because consumers want to try out 5G.\n\nThis trend is already underway. \u201cOver the last three months, we have seen an acceleration in worldwide 5G development,\u201d said CFO Lora Ho in the second-quarter conference call in July. Taiwan Semiconductor is a go-to supplier of sophisticated chips capable of powering 5G speeds, because the company uses cutting-edge 7 nanometer and 5 nanometer lithography to produce them.\n\nRetzler is also bullish on a lesser-known 5G chip demand play called MKS Instruments MKSI, -0.52%. It sells equipment used in the manufacturing of chips, chip casings, and components used in mobile phones. The company gets about half its revenue from sales to chip equipment and chip manufacturers.\n\nCEO Gerald Colella cites demand for smaller chips used in 5G phones as key a source of growth ahead. \u201cWe\u2019re very positive because smaller chips will continue to be put into phones, especially with 5G,\u201d he said in the second-quarter conference call in late July.\n\nTrend #2: Modernization of the military\n\nThe military has always driven tech development \u2014 and it\u2019s no different now. This makes military spending on tech a key trend for Retzler. \u201cNew technologies are being deployed for greater precision and effectiveness to minimize casualties for our troops and civilians,\u201d he says.\n\nA good example is tech offered by KVH Industries KVHI, -3.36%. The company\u2019s inertial navigation division offers products that assure uninterrupted access to navigation systems like GPS for military vehicles.\n\nSecond-quarter sales were week following eight quarters of double-digit growth. But the slowdown won\u2019t last forever.\n\n\u201cWe have a strong pipeline of opportunities and continue to get designed into new platforms,\u201d cofounder and CEO Martin Kits Van Heyningen said in the second-quarter conference call.\n\nAnother favorite here is Intevac IVAC, +1.34% , which makes digital night-vision imaging systems for the U.S. military, based on the company\u2019s proprietary electron-bombarded active-pixel sensor technology.\n\nIntevac\u2019s night-vision systems are used in military aircraft, including Apache helicopters and F-35 fighter jets. The company is working on new technology for head-mounted and weapon-mounted night-vision apps. It also offers laser-illuminated infrared cameras for long-range night-time surveillance systems that can identify targets up to 12 miles away.\n\nIntevac beat second-quarter revenue guidance in part because of strong sales of night-vision devices, and it expects sales here to double over the next five years based on new order and backlog trends.\n\nRetzler also cites Lockheed Martin LMT, +2.03% as a key player in military technology worth owning, though it is too big for his small-cap fund.\n\nTrend #3: China\u2019s investment in chip production\n\nAnother major trend Retzler likes to invest in is an outgrowth of the U.S-China trade war. President Donald Trump\u2019s on-again, off-bans on sales by U.S. chip and component companies to Huawei and ZTE woke Chinese officials up to the reality that they do not have enough sophisticated semiconductor production capacity of their own.\n\nTo build that out they are going to have to buy chip equipment.\n\nRetzler thinks Lam Research LRCX, -0.26% will be a key beneficiary. Lam Research has an expertise in cutting-edge technologies like nanoscale chip production. China has been its biggest source of revenue growth. Sales to China accounted for 23% of revenue in the year ending June 30, up from 13% during the same time frame in 2016-1017.\n\nAnd while this one is not exactly undiscovered, Retzler also thinks chip-equipment maker Applied Materials AMAT, -0.84% will benefit from the build out of chip production in China, once China and the U.S. come to a trade-war truce.", "description": "You don\u2019t have to own the big tech stocks to make decent profits.
