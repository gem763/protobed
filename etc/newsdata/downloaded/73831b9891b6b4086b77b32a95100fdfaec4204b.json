On Saturday, the matter was referred to a police watchdog for potential investigation.\n\nThe BBC's Andrew Marr asked whether Johnson had followed ethical rules he had signed on potential conflicts of interest. Those state that elected officials should act \"solely in accordance with the public interest and they should not do so in order to get financial or other benefits for themselves, their families or their friends.\"\n\n\"Everything was done in accordance with the code you just cited and everything was done with full propriety,\" said Johnson.\n\nChallenged that because Arcuri was a friend he should have declared the connection, Johnson said he had not because, \"There was no interest to declare.\"\n\n\"Let\u2019s be absolutely clear. I am very, very proud of everything that we did and certainly everything that I did as mayor of London,\" he said, before suggesting that the allegations were motivated by a desire to thwart Brexit.\n\n\"I think that there is a large constituency in parliament and elsewhere who do want to frustrate that objective [of delivering Brexit on October 31] and, rightly or wrongly, they see me as the person most likely to deliver that objective,\" said Johnson. \"You\u2019ve got to be realistic in my position and you\u2019ve got to expect a lot of shot and shell.\"\n\nArcuri was quoted by the Guardian on Saturday as saying: \u201cThe stories you are writing are more and more false. These are fake news.\u201d", "description": "\u2018There was no interest to declare,\u2019 in case of tech entrepreneur Jennifer Arcuri, said UK prime minister.", "authors": ["James Randerson", "Matei Rosca"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1171297876-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
