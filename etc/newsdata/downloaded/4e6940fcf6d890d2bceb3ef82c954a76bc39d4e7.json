REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz -/File Photo\n\nYet his plans to take WeWork\u2019s corporate parent the We Company public have backfired, as his company becomes the poster child for a bubble in venture capital fundraising that has pushed some start-ups to unsustainable valuations.\n\nThe We Company is contemplating slashing its valuation to as low as $10 billion from the $47 billion billing clinched in a private fundraising round in January backed by Japan\u2019s SoftBank Group Corp, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.\n\nThe sharp drop comes amid investor criticism of widening losses and Neumann\u2019s firm grip on the company.\n\nNeumann, 40, is under pressure to proceed with the initial public offering (IPO) to raise cash to keep WeWork\u2019s operations going. The New York-based company rents workspace to clients under short-term contracts, even though it pays rent for them itself under long-term leases.\n\nIt is by far the biggest crisis Neumann has faced in his career, after arriving in New York at the age of 22 following service in the Israeli military.\n\nHe failed in several ventures before selling his first co-working firm, Green Door, for $300,000 with business partner Miguel McKelvey a decade ago. Neumann and McKelvey used the proceeds from that sale to start WeWork, with its first customers coming to the lower Manhattan site just off Chinatown in February 2010, after seeing ads in Craigslist.\n\nCommunity was a driving force behind the new venture, launched at a time when millions who had lost jobs during the 2008 financial crisis were looking for flexible work space.\n\n\u201cIt quickly became apparent that people were ready for a new approach to work, not just their workspace,\u201d Neumann said in a blog post in 2016, marking the launch in Berlin of WeWork\u2019s 100th site.\n\nNeumann\u2019s parents divorced when he was a boy and he moved 13 times as a child and adolescent, living awhile in Indianapolis where his mother, an oncologist, finished her medical residency. He has called his childhood challenging because of the moves.\n\nThey returned to Israel where he lived in kibbutz Nir Am, near the Gaza Strip, and later served in the Israeli military, which he says taught him to be something greater than himself.\n\nNeumann\u2019s experience on a kibbutz and McKelvey\u2019s growing up in a five-mother commune in Oregon have been cited as a reason the pair hit it off. McKelvey is an architect with the title of chief culture officer at WeWork.\n\nNeumann, now a billionaire as the majority owner of We Company, also has said he thought money was the goal in life until he met his wife Rebekah, a cousin of actress Gwyneth Paltrow.\n\nFormerly called chief brand director, Rebekah Neumann is referred to as a co-founder of WeWork. She is also a filmmaker and introduced Neumann to Kabbalah, a form of Jewish mysticism that has attracted celebrity followers. They have five children.\n\nELEVATING WORLD\u2019S CONSCIOUSNESS\n\nThe early success of the shared workspace validated the global community Neumann envisioned where people can achieve more together than alone, or in the words of the company\u2019s famous mantra: \u201cto make a life, not just a living.\u201d\n\nNeumann arrived in New York in 2001 where he lived with his sister Adi, an Israeli model, and started a handful of businesses that failed, including women\u2019s shoes and a line of baby clothes with knee pads called Krawlers.\n\n\u201cWhen I came to New York I was angry about my history,\u201d Neumann told a luncheon at the New York Stock Exchange in June 2017, adding he learned that you don\u2019t deserve anything. \u201cI became happy. My past helped make who I am today,\u201d he said.\n\nNeumann, described as key to setting WeWork\u2019s strategic direction and execution priorities in the IPO filing, can come off as a bit zany. In the 2016 blog post he said the future of cities would require a healthy mix of 70% magic and 30% logic.\n\nThe We Company also said in the filing that its mission is to elevate the world\u2019s consciousness and that as a community company it is committed to maximum global impact, a vision Neumann endorses.", "description": "Adam Neumann showed he can capitalize on troubled times a decade ago, tapping into demand for workspace by those forced out of jobs in the aftermath of the financial crisis to grow WeWork into a global brand commanding a $47 billion valuation.", "authors": ["Herbert Lash", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190915&t=2&i=1430066517&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8E07T", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
