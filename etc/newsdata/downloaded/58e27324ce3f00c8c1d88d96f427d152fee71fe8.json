In the end, he received a total of $158,333.\n\nBrown had a contentious relationship with the Raiders during the preseason and they voided his contract before the season began. He then signed a contract with the Patriots and played one game for the team before it released him after he was accused of sexual assault.\n\nHis contract with the Patriots included $10 million in guaranteed money. But as Sports Illustrated points out, the contract stipulated that if Brown \u201ctakes any action that materially undermines the public\u2019s respect for, or is materially critical of, the Club, Player\u2019s teammates or the club\u2019s ownership, coaches, management, operations or policies,\u201d then the contract will be null and void.\n\nAlso see: Patriots receiver Antonio Brown accused of rape by former trainer\n\nHis contract included a $9 million signing bonus and a $1 million salary. Since Brown only played with the team for one game, he was paid $158,333. According to the Boston Globe, he was set to receive the first installment of his signing bonus \u2014 $5 million \u2014 three days after the team released him.\n\nBrown has filed a grievance against the team to collect the full $10 million. He will be represented by his union, the NFL Players Association.\n\nBrown, 31, has made $70 million during his nine-year career, and has been one of the best wide receivers in the NFL for years; he has been in the Pro Bowl seven times. But he went on Twitter Sunday to say he\u2019ll never play in the NFL again.\n\nWill not be playing in the @NFL anymore these owners can cancel deals do whatever they want at anytime we will see if the @NFLPA hold them accountable sad they can just void guarantees anytime going on 40m 2 months will see if they pay up ! \u2014 AB (@AB84) September 22, 2019\n\nMarketWatch interviewed Pittsburgh Steelers great Terry Bradshaw a few days before Brown was released by the Patriots. Here\u2019s what he had to say about Brown, who previously played for the Steelers.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like guys like that. I don\u2019t want to play with guys like that. As far as I am concerned he\u2019s a selfish, immature player. I\u2019m disappointed in New England for picking him up. I\u2019m disappointed he could last in the league this long.\u201d", "description": "The Patriots released Brown after he was accused of sexual assault.", "authors": ["Steven Kutz", "Senior Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR052_antoni_ZG_20190910214353.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
