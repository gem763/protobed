She said that Cryer -- who would have been 19 at the time -- \"fell for me in real life\" during the production.\n\nMoore goes on to say that it still \"pains\" her to think of how she treated him, and how she took his virginity flippantly, when it could have been something truly special for him.\n\nAccording to Cryer, now 54, she shouldn't feel pained because he says she isn't actually correct.\n\n\"Well, the good thing about this is she doesn\u2019t have to feel bad about it anymore, because while I\u2019m sure she was totally justified making that assumption based on my my skill level (and the stunned look on my face at the time), I had actually lost my virginity in high school,\" Cryer tweeted on Tuesday, sharing a link to an article reporting Moore's claim.\n\nWell, the good thing about this is she doesn\u2019t have to feel bad about it anymore, because while I\u2019m sure she was totally justified making that assumption based on my my skill level (and the stunned look on my face at the time), I had actually lost my virginity in high school. https://t.co/amxCUaMUQw \u2014 Jon Cryer (@MrJonCryer) September 24, 2019\n\nCryer went on to confirm, however, that her belief that he fell for her was, in fact, accurate.\n\n\"But she\u2019s right the other part, I was over the moon for her during a very troubled time in her life,\" Cryer tweeted. \"I have nothing but affection for her and not a regret in the world.\"\n\nBut she\u2019s right the other part, I was over the moon for her during a very troubled time in her life.
