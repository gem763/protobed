With the world economy sandbagged by the downside risks of the U.S.-China trade war, Trump called the central bank \u201cboneheads\u201d for missing out on \u201ca once in a lifetime opportunity\u201d presented by historically low yields.\n\nThe Federal Reserve should get our interest rates down to ZERO, or less, and we should then start to refinance our debt. INTEREST COST COULD BE BROUGHT WAY DOWN, while at the same time substantially lengthening the term. We have the great currency, power, and balance sheet..... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 11, 2019\n\nTrump reiterated his frustrations with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who he believes has not been aggressive enough in easing monetary policy in the face of a global slowdown.\n\nNegative-yielding global debt, currently estimated at $16 trillion, is bad for savers and bank profits, but makes the risk of default virtually nil.\n\nIt also underscored the president\u2019s growing fascination with negative rates, a condition where investors have sacrificed yield for safety by paying the bond issuer.\n\n\u201cSpecifically as a mercantilst, Trump is focused on bilateral trade balances and U.S. exports...which he seems to think frustrate improvement\u201d of the economy, said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex.\n\nAs yields on safe-haven government debt collapse globally \u2014 largely because of fears over the economy and expected central bank easing \u2014 borrowing costs have dropped sharply.\n\nIn fact, the Congressional Budget Office said last month that the federal government\u2019s savings on borrowing costs translated into a $1.1 trillion net reduction in the CBO\u2019s projections over the following 10 years, even as deficit spending surges.\n\nThe ownership of different government bonds globally More\n\n\n\n\n\nBank of America-Merrill Lynch (BofA) noted recently that \u201cthe ubiquity of negative rates has largely been a function of expected economic weakness. Markets have gone into risk-off mode, pushing [major economies\u2019] rates ever lower as investors flock to safe-haven assets.\u201d\n\nThe bank added that \u201cthe risk is that...yields continue their race to the bottom, inflating a bond-market bubble that poses yet another risk to the global economy.\u201d\n\nWith inflation low, The European Central Bank, Swiss National Bank and the Bank of Japan have all committed to keeping rates negative \u2014 a policy Trump feels the Fed should replicate domestically.\n\nA handful of experts believe negative rates serve a function, at least in the short term.\n\nKrishna Memani, Invesco\u2019s vice chairman of investments, wrote last week that the \u201cgoal of the central bank at the end of the day is to focus on growth and employment, and not to ensure that enough high yielding assets exist in the economy to meet some threshold of claims.\u201d\n\nThe emphasis on higher yields \u201cis a moot point as asset returns cannot be generated without underlying economic growth,\u201d Memani said. That argument dovetails with Trump\u2019s emphasis on the Fed needing to do more to bolster growth.\n\n\u201cIf you frame the argument along these lines, you can see why in a low demand environment that low and even negative yields may be needed to support growth. There is nothing magically different about negative nominal yields,\u201d Memani added.\n\nHowever, other analysts have warned that sub-zero yields are a trap that will be hard to escape once growth and inflation return.", "description": "President Donald Trump on Wednesday called for the Federal Reserve to engineer interest rates to zero \u201cor less.\"", "authors": ["Javier E.
