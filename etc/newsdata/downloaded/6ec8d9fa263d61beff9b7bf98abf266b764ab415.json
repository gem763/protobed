Sign up here.\n\nLaw enforcement officials in Georgia are searching far and wide for a convicted child rapist after he was accidentally released from prison Friday.\n\nThe inmate at-large, Tony Maycon Munoz-Mendez, was serving a life sentence at Rogers State Prison in Reidsville for repeatedly molesting and raping a 10-year-old girl, the daughter of his then-girlfriend, according to WXIA, a local NBC affiliate. He was convicted on rape and child molestation charges in 2015. But somehow \u2014 and prison officials haven\u2019t said how \u2014 he was \u201creleased in error\u201d from the prison Friday morning.\n\n\u201cAll resources are being utilized to ensure the rapid apprehension of Munoz-Mendez, including the Georgia Department of Corrections Fugitive Unit and U.S. Marshals,\u201d the state\u2019s Department of Corrections said in a statement Monday.\n\nThe Gwinnett County prosecutor who oversaw Munoz-Mendez\u2019s conviction, John Warr, told WXIA he was horrified by the prison\u2019s mistake. The inmate was less than five years into his life sentence, and nobody notified him or the victim, now a teenager, of his escape.\n\n\"I saw it online,\" Warr told WXIA. \"So, I contacted the foster mother of the victim, immediately, and informed her what was going on.\u201d\n\nThe Rogers State Prison is a medium-security facility for adult men, according to the state\u2019s Department of Corrections.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether the prison had accidentally released an inmate before, but Georgia\u2019s jails have accidentally released inmates accused of sexual assault in the past \u2014 including one accused rapist and kidnapper in late August. The man in that case, Justin Lamar Jackson, turned himself back in after about three weeks outside the jail.\n\nCover image: Prison cells in Georgia.
