USA TODAY\n\nBy and large, the playoff picture hasn\u2019t changed much from what observers thought it would look like when the college football season began. That might finally change over the next few weeks, starting this Saturday, as competition in the major conferences intensifies.\n\nHere are the five games that could have the most impact in Week 7.\n\nNo. 5 Oklahoma vs. No. 11 Texas in Dallas\n\nSaturday, noon ET, Fox\n\nThe annual Red River showdown, one of the most anticipated games of the regular season, has finally arrived. Of course, it could turn out once again to be just the first of two encounters between the Sooners and Longhorns should they finish atop the Big 12 standings as expected. It will also serve as a showcase for a couple of Heisman Trophy contenders.\n\nSooners QB Jalen Hurts remains in the driver\u2019s seat for the sport\u2019s most prestigious individual honor, despite throwing a rare interception at Kansas last week. He\u2019s still gaining 8.8 yards a carry when he takes off as well, as if speedy WR CeeDee Lamb and veteran RB Trey Sermon didn\u2019t provide enough of a headache for the Longhorns\u2019 depleted secondary. But Texas QB Sam Ehlinger is also worthy of consideration. He has 17 scoring tosses himself and also isn\u2019t afraid to tuck and run. When he does air it out, his primary targets are WRs Devin Duvernay and Brennan Eagles.\n\nBOLD PREDICTIONS: An easy Oklahoma win? Trouble for Wisconsin?\n\nPOWER RANKINGS: ACC | Big 12 | Big Ten | Pac-12 | SEC\n\nSTAFF PICKS: LSU-Florida, Oklahoma-Texas highlight weekend\n\nNo. 7 Florida at No. 6 LSU\n\nSaturday, 8 p.m. ET, ESPN\n\nThe Gators don\u2019t have long to enjoy last week\u2019s huge home victory against Auburn as another top-10 showdown looms. Such is life in the SEC, where the Bayou Bengals hope to take advantage of a high-energy crowd to pick up another quality victory at home.\n\nWhile Florida made its share of mistakes against Auburn, the Gators\u2019 cause was helped by forcing a few more from a freshman quarterback. They won\u2019t have that luxury this week against LSU QB Joe Burrow, whose hot start has been a major reason for the Tigers\u2019 ascendency to front and center in the playoff hunt. He\u2019ll be down one receiver with Terrace Marshall recovering from a foot injury, but Justin Jefferson and Ja\u2019Marr Chase will still give S Shawn Davis and the Florida secondary plenty of concerns. Gators QB Kyle Trask, who played on a bad knee in the second half last week but is ready to go, must hope his pocket holds up and that he continues to get ground support from RB Lamical Perine. LSU LB Jacob Phillips and S JaCoby Stevens want to make sure he doesn\u2019t.\n\nNo. 1 Alabama at No. 21 Texas A&M\n\nSaturday, 3:30 p.m. ET, CBS\n\nWith a \u20182\u2019 already in the loss column, the Aggies are for all practical purposes relegated to a spoiler role as far as the playoff race is concerned. But a major bowl invitation remains in play, and an upset of this magnitude would help that cause considerably. The Crimson Tide, whose most difficult games remain ahead of them, will try to extinguish those upset aspirations as quickly as possible.\n\nAlabama QB Tua Tagovailoa has done nothing to take himself out of the Heisman conversation thus far, amassing 23 TD throws without an interception through his first five games. But he has yet to face a defense equipped to put him under duress. The Aggies might not be able to do it, either, but DT Justin Madubuike will do his best leading the pass rush. A&M QB Kellen Mond has faced a couple of elite defenses and struggled due to protection issues. That doesn\u2019t bode well with the likes of Crimson Tide LB Anfernee Jennings coming to town.\n\nAlabama wide receiver DeVonta Smith scores a touchdown against Mississippi during the second quarter at Bryant-Denny Stadium.

They now find themselves needing to not only beat the struggling Seminoles but to win in impressive fashion as they try to recapture the form they showed en route to last year\u2019s national championship. FSU has looked more like FSU of late after a rocky start, so this trip to Clemson will serve as either a turning point or a reality check.\n\nClemson QB Trevor Lawrence has made some flashy throws but has lacked the consistency he demonstrated over the latter half of the 2018 campaign. He already has five interceptions with just eight scoring throws this year. The Florida State defense is coming off its most complete performance of the season two weeks ago against N.C. State, avoiding the second-half meltdowns that plagued the unit in early September. Seminoles QB James Blackman will return to the starting lineup, though Alex Hornibrook is likely to take snaps as well. Regardless,a porous offensive line must do a lot better keeping them upright, but DE Xavier Thomas and the Tigers\u2019 defensive front will pose matchup problems.\n\nNo. 9 Penn State at No. 18 Iowa\n\nSaturday, 7:30 p.m. ET, ABC\n\nThe Nittany Lions look like the only bunch standing in the way of Ohio State in the Big Ten East. First, however, they must take care of business in this trip to Iowa City, where strange things have been known to happen under the lights. The Hawkeyes will be happy to be back home after last week\u2019s dismal offensive performance at Michigan.\n\nThe Big House proved to be a big nightmare for Iowa QB Nate Stanley as he was sacked eight times and threw his first three interceptions of 2019. That might not bode well against the Nittany Lions, who are averaging five sacks a game themselves led by DEs Yetur Gross-Matos and Shaka Toney. LB Christian Welch and the Iowa defense held up well despite the offense\u2019s woes, but the group might have its hands full with PSU\u2019s dual-threat QB Sean Clifford.", "description": "Week 7 has several intriguing games that will impact the College Football Playoff, led by Florida-LSU, Oklahoma-Texas and Alabama-Texas A&M.", "authors": ["Eddie Timanus", "Published A.M.
