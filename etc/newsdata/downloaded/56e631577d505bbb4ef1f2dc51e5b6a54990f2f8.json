Ney in the general counsel\u2019s office. A Defense official said on Monday that he expected the Pentagon would turn the necessary material over to Congress.\n\nAs the subpoenas begin to stack up, the impeachment inquiry is picking up steam less than three weeks after House leaders opened it in light of an anonymous whistle-blower complaint alleging Mr. Trump was bending American foreign policy for his own political benefit.\n\nThe White House has threatened to try to stonewall investigators\u2019 requests and Mr. Trump has mounted a near round-the-clock defense of himself. But witnesses have steadily begun to produce documentary evidence \u2014 some of which has bolstered the initial complaint \u2014 and a spate of private witness depositions are expected in the coming weeks.\n\nThe investigating committees had scheduled a deposition for Monday with George P. Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state and Ukraine expert, but Mr. Kent did not show up as planned. A committee aide said that conversations about scheduling a new date with Mr. Kent were continuing, and implied that at least three other witnesses scheduled to appear this week were also in doubt.\n\nMr. Kent is the head of the State Department\u2019s bureau of European and Eurasian affairs, but he served until 2018 as a top American diplomat in Ukraine; prior to that he was a senior anti-corruption coordinator for the department in Europe.\n\nThe three others include T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, the State Department\u2019s counselor who the whistle-blower said listened in on the July phone call; as well as Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, associates of Mr. Trump\u2019s private lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who aided his attempts to gin up investigations in Ukraine.\n\nStill, two key figures from the State Department were confirmed to participate in their scheduled depositions. Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union who was deeply involved in Mr. Trump\u2019s policy toward Ukraine, is expected to speak to investigators on Tuesday. And on Friday, they will question Marie L. Yovanovitch, the former American ambassador to Ukraine who was recalled from her post in May after she was deemed not to be sufficiently supportive of Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda there.\n\nHelene Cooper contributed reporting.", "description": "House Democrats are looking for information that could reveal whether President Trump\u2019s decision to withhold security aid from Ukraine was tied to his bid to pressure its government to investigate rivals.", "authors": ["Nicholas Fandos"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/07/us/politics/07dc-impeach/07dc-impeach-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
