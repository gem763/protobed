And on occasions, it can become wonderfully sophisticated.\n\nIn this case, the fungus spreads inside the poor weevil, taking chemical control of the creature and compelling it to climb. When it reaches a suitable height - for the fungus - the insect will lock down on the stem and die. Look and you can see the glaze has gone from its eyes.\n\nMeanwhile, fuelled by the weevil's insides, the fungus will start to grow those exquisite fruiting bodies. The capsules at the top will eventually burst and release countless tiny spores to infect new prey.\n\n\"The perfect symmetry made me think to photograph the beetle from the front to get sharp the whole fungus and the head of the beetle both,\" said Frank.\n\n\"Furthermore as the beetle was dead and immobile, I tried a long exposure under daylight, avoiding the sun to reduce the contrast of the background.\"\n\nNow in its 55th year, WPY has become one of the most prestigious competitions of its kind anywhere in the world. Nearly 50,000 entries were received for this year's event.\n\nFrank Deschandol's picture was Highly Commended in the Plants and Fungi category. A number of other Highly Commended images are shown below.\n\nReader discretion is advised when scrolling down. Nature can be cruel.\n\nThe category and Grand Prize winners will be celebrated at a NHM ceremony on Tuesday 15 October. The museum will then open its annual exhibition of the best photos on the following Friday.\n\nBig cat and dog spat by Peter Haygarth, UK\n\nImage copyright Peter Haygarth/WPY2019\n\nAfrican wild dogs are known to be very effective hunters. Not on this occasion, however. This lone cheetah just managed to escape with its life. The photo was taken in a South African game reserve. Category - Behaviour: Mammals.\n\nCircle of life by Alex Mustard, UK\n\nImage copyright Alexander Mustard/WPY2019\n\nA shoal of bigeye fish in the Red Sea. Their circling behaviour is a dating exercise prior to pairing up, though it also deters predators.

She was using the car as a safe place to bring up her young. The hole was too small for predatory coyotes to pass through. Category - Urban Wildlife.\n\nTouching trust by Thomas Peschak, Germany/S. Africa\n\nImage copyright Thomas.P.Peschak/WPY2019\n\nA curious young grey whale approaches a pair of hands reaching down from a tourist boat in San Ignacio Lagoon, Mexico. Mothers and young in the lagoon will actively seek contact with people for a head scratch or back rub.

The caterpillar weaves the den to give it some protection from predators during its grand metamorphosis into an adult moth. Category - Behaviour: Invertebrates.\n\nBeach waste by Thomas Ware, USA\n\nImage copyright Matthew Ware/WPY2019\n\nLittering the oceans has consequences. This Kemp's ridley sea turtle was strangled by discarded fishing gear attached to a washed-up beach chair. The photo was taken in Alabama. Category - Wildlife Photojournalism.\n\nLast gasp by Adrian Hirschi, Switzerland\n\nImage copyright Adrian Hirschi/WPY2019\n\nA newborn hippo is attacked by a bull in the shallows of Lake Kariba, Zimbabwe. This behaviour is rare but may happen if there is competition for space or a male wants to impose his dominance.
