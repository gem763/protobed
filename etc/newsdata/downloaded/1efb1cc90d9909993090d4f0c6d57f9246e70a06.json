I think maybe two years, in my opinion, because I don\u2019t want to fight all my life because I know it\u2019s very hard. I know a lot of young, hungry guys are coming, and I know to always be undefeated, undisputed, is not almost impossible \u2013 I think it\u2019s impossible.\n\n\u201cYou can watch in history. If you watch all athletes like soccer, boxing, MMA, everywhere, one day you\u2019re going to lose. You have to know when you need to stop. I think maybe two years.\u201d\n\nUnbeaten in 28 fights, Nurmagomedov (28-0 MMA, 12-0 UFC) wants to reach a personal career milestone of a 30-0 record. He has defended his 155-pound title twice, submitting both Conor McGregor at UFC 229 in October 2018, and Dustin Poirier this past month at UFC 242 in Abu Dhabi.\n\nHe thinks he only has a few more fights left in him.\n\n\u201cBefore, I never thought about this \u2013 but right now, it\u2019s like I\u2019m almost there,\u201d Nurmagomedov said. \u201c28-0, and in the next couple of years I\u2019m going to compete because I just (turned) 31. This is not too much for this sport, but for sure I think I\u2019m going to finish (at) 33, 34, it\u2019s going to be done. But right now, I have a couple of years to compete.\u201d\n\nTargeting a return in March, Nurmagomedov wants to fight in his home country of Russia. He is expecting to face former interim lightweight champion Tony Ferguson, who has won his past 12 fights.\n\nHe expects to remain undefeated and undisputed.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s a very good and tough opponent,\u201d Nurmagomedov said. \u201cHe has good experience. I think it\u2019s going to be the same result, (if Allah wills it). This is my opinion. Nothing changed. They just give me all these new opponents with new names, but results, inshallah, are going to stay the same.\u201d", "description": "Khabib Nurmagomedov thinks it's impossible to stay undefeated for a whole career and sees himself fighting for a couple more years.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Simon Head", "Nolan King", "Mike Bohn"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/khabib-nurmagomedov-ufc-242-post-2.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
