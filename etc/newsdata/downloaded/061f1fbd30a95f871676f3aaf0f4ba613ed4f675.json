The bank blamed the losses on a 'rogue trader' who allegedly manipulated the subsidiary's risk-management system, allowing him to place massive derivatives bets on the price of oil and disguise them as hedges similar to what JPMorgan did with the whole London Whale debacle.\n\nThough the bank didn't release the trader's name, according to the press release, he was fired earlier this week. The bank has since reported his actions to the local police.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe trader had been taking unauthorized derivatives positions since January, but he suffered heavy losses over the summer as oil prices fell. He reportedly occupied a relatively senior position, and was in charge of all transactions involving China for the subsidiary.\n\nMitsubshi More\n\nThe bank launched an investigation into the traders' positions while he was out of office in the middle of August. It soon discovered the unauthorized positions, and decided to unwind them immediately (the bank probably could have minimized losses if it had waited until Monday to unwind those positions, when prices spiked nearly 20% intraday).\n\nBecause the trader had manipulated the subsidiary's risk-management system, he was able to make it look like the derivative trades were associated with customer orders.\n\nRelated: Oil Prices Up As Iran Prepares For \"All Out War\"\n\nAs the FT points out, Mitsubishi made a $5 billion net profit last year, so the trading loss is more of an embarrassment than a threat to the bank's survival. But according to Bloomberg, the oil market has a long history of massive trading busts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe incident is a reminder of the damage that a rogue trader can cause to a large financial institution, according to the FT. The Mitsubishi rogue trader will join a growing 'rogues gallery' that includes Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale's J\u00e9r\u00f4me Kerviel, JPM's \"London Whale\" (a.k.a. Bruno Iksil), and Barings' Nick Leeson.\n\nBad Bets More\n\n* * *\n\nRead Mitsubishi's announcement below:\n\nLosses from Overseas Subsidiary\u2019s Crude Oil Trading\n\nThis is to inform you that Mitsubishi Corporation (hereinafter \u201cMC\") can confirm that one of its subsidiaries based in Singapore has realized a previously unidentified loss from derivatives trading. Investigations are currently ongoing to determine all of the details, but what is known so far is outlined below.\n\nStory continues", "description": "A rogue trader working for a Singapore-based subsidiary of Japanese trading giant Mitsubishi recently booked a $320 million loss after several unauthorized derivatives trades went sour", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ygqDnrV2btX2bWdZrtkEug--~B/aD0yNjk7dz00NTA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/oilprice.com/62a622b0a277c66537dbb159afa1bd32", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
