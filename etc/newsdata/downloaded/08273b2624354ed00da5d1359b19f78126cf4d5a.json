He serves up one \u201cmost shocking episode ever\u201d after another, mining uglier pieces of his core each time: progressing from profanity about Haiti and Africa in private to publicly telling four minority American congresswomen, only one of whom was born outside the United States, to \u201cgo back\u201d to the countries they came from.\n\nThe taunting. The insults. The dog whistles. The dog bullhorns. The \u201cLock her up\u201d and \u201cSend her back.\u201d All of it follows reality-TV rules. Every season has to top the last. Every fight is necessary, be it against Ilhan Omar or Debra Messing. Every twist must be more shocking, every conflict more vicious, lest the red light grow bored and wink off. The only difference: Now there\u2019s no Mark Burnett to impose retroactive logic on the chaos, only press secretaries, pundits and Mike Pence.\n\nTo ask whether any of this is \u201cinstinct\u201d or \u201cstrategy\u201d is a parlor game. If you think like a TV camera \u2014 if thinking in those reflexive microbursts of adrenaline and testosterone has served you your whole life \u2014 then the instinct is the strategy.", "description": "", "authors": ["James Poniewozik", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Sunday Trump-Reality-Tv.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
