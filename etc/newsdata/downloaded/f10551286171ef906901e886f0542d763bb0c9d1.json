Others shifting on are star midfield back Samu Kerevi, five-eighths Christian Lealiifano and Bernard Foley, and locks Rory Arnold and Adam Coleman. Michael Cheika also confirmed he won\u2019t seek reappointment as the Wallabies\u2019 coach.\n\nKerevi and Arnold were among Australia\u2019s premier performers in 2019 and will be nearly impossible to replace immediately. But it was some of the longer-serving players in the forefront of captain Michael Hooper\u2019s thoughts following the 40-16 loss to England in Oita on Saturday.\n\nAsked directly about the contributions of Genia and Pocock, Hooper found it hard to stomach that the departees had been farewelled on such on a flat note.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been a fan of those guys from being a young fella, to now playing alongside. Very proud to represent Australia with them,\u201d said Pocock, who is left hanging on 99 Tests. \u201cA lot of me wanted to be able to send those guys out how they deserved to, but we weren\u2019t able to and that\u2019s part of the feeling - I\u2019m feeling pretty gutted.\u201d\n\nPocock, Genia and Kepu were all lining up at their third Rugby World Cup. The latter pair finish on 110 caps, equal-sixth on the all-time Wallabies list.\n\nAustralia's pain self-inflicted in Rugby World Cup loss to England Read more\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the end. A bit of an outpouring of emotion after the game,\u201d said Papua New Guinea-born halfback Genia. \u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing journey. I\u2019ve been so blessed and so privileged to have lived my dream. I\u2019m very sad but also very grateful. Like, how lucky? Got to play 11 years for Australia.\n\n\u201cI never thought I was the most talented bloke, I always wanted to be someone who worked hard so put myself in a position to play well.\u201d\n\nZimbabwe-born Pocock was just as proud. A star of the two previous tournaments, he finishes with 83 caps, something he had never considered achievable.\n\n\u201cAs an immigrant moving to Australia, rugby has given me so much opportunity. I am grateful for the support I have had in Australia and family and friends in Zimbabwe and Zimbabweans all around the world.\u201d\n\nVictorious England flanker Sam Underhill paid homage to Pocock and his influence. He said he and fellow back-rower Tom Curry, who was named man of the match, had regarded it a privilege to line up opposite the legendary ball snaffler.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit surreal coming up against him this evening. Tom and myself were talking about it, he\u2019s been such a brilliant player,\u201d Underhill said. \u201cAny young back-row growing up in the last five or 10 years has probably looked at him as a guy that they want to be like and play like.\u201d", "description": "The tears in the Wallabies dressing room after their Rugby World Cup quarter-final humbling reflected deep disappointment and the sadness of losing some of the country\u2019s great players", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d75ba45d7c772d507ec2d66040b26564d9ac2ad/452_148_2169_1302/master/2169.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2f404f655781bae02e674c1a9d9fb194", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
