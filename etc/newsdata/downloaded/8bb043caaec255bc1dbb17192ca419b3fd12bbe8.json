By volume, 1.8 million images per year will be added to the platform, which already houses 600,000 per year from 10,000 sporting events covered by 300 sports photographers nationwide. Imagn thus now serves as one of the nation\u2019s largest sources of original editorial images.\n\nImagn is both an editorial image photo agency and a leading wire service. The agency serves clients with per picture and per project needs across news and media segments. The wire service is subscription based (or flat fee) for simplicity and offers unlimited images for all editorial purposes across all platforms, with three content subscription options: only sports, only news and entertainment, or combined sports, news, and entertainment. The wire subscription service is best suited for enterprise customers who have high volume content needs and for clients or work teams who desire content delivered via API.\n\n\u201cWe are very excited about the Imagn launch and rebrand and our ability to combine the largest sports image wire service with the largest source of original news images in the US. Along with this powerful combination of image offerings, we will continue to be customer driven and provide the highest level of customer support.\u201d said Bruce Odle, President of Imagn.\n\n\u201cImagn has the potential to be a game changer in the image business and is the result of great strategic thinking about how to utilize the strength and scale of the talent and resources available across the USA TODAY NETWORK,\u201d said Kate Gutman, Head of Content Ventures, USA TODAY NETWORK.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/pr/2019/04/24/introducing-imagn/3561661002/", "description": "Gannett\u00a0officially rebranded its business unit USA TODAY Sports Images to Imagn and expanded its offerings for news and media outlets to include original sports, entertainment and breaking news images sourced directly from the USA TODAY NETWORK", "authors": ["Staff", "Usa Today Network Pressroom", "Published A.M.
