REUTERS/Roosevelt Cassio\n\n(Reuters) - The strike against General Motors Co\u2019s (GM.N) U.S. operations has led to a parts shortage, the automaker said on Wednesday, and as a result it announced the temporary lay-offs of 1,200 workers at its Oshawa assembly plant in Canada.\n\nThe plant, which makes the Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks, ran out of parts on Tuesday.\n\nThe lay-off announcement came three days after about 48,000 hourly workers went on strike across GM facilities in the United States. Contract talks began early on Wednesday and were continuing into the evening aimed at reaching a deal, but no agreement was expected immediately.\n\n\u201cWe anticipated there would be an impact because of the strike,\u201d David Paterson, a spokesman for General Motors in Canada, told Reuters.\n\nThe Oshawa plant will continue to make sedans.\n\nSeparately, Democrats in the U.S. Congress ramped up criticism of GM over its decision to shift health insurance costs for its striking workers to the union and urged the company reach a deal.\n\nRepresentative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat, said on Twitter that the decision was \u201cstraight barbarism.\u201d She added: \u201cGM workers are asking for a raise during a time of record profits. In response, GM execs cut off their health insurance.\u201d\n\nMany Democratic presidential candidates have issued similar comments.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Twitter of the dispute: \u201cEnough of the stonewalling. It\u2019s time for @GM to do the right thing.\u201d", "description": "The strike against General Motors Co's U.S. operations has led to a parts shortage, the automaker said on Wednesday, and as a result it announced the temporary lay-offs of 1,200 workers at its Oshawa assembly plant in Canada.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431314395&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H1LJ", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
