The chain has failed to institute adequate policies and training that would prevent racial profiling, the lawyers said.\n\nThe lawsuit says Massey, a 35-year-old from the Seattle area, was staying at the DoubleTree in Portland's Lloyd District on December 22 when a security guard asked if he was a guest and to state his room number.\n\nThe incident occurred at this DoubleTree by Hilton in Portland, Oregon in December\n\nMassey used his cellphone to capture what happened next in video that was posted to the internet, racking up millions of views and many remarks on social media.\n\nAfter Massey said he was a guest, the guard told Massey he was 'loitering' and the police were on the way to escort him off the property.\n\nHe was eventually accompanied to his room so he could pack his belongings and he was forced at about midnight to find another hotel, according to the lawsuit.\n\n'Mr. Massey hopes to learn what policies of Hilton have led to these events, what Hilton has done in response to such events, and will ask the jury to punish Hilton as an example to other hotels who may be tempted to encourage or tolerate discrimination at their places of business,' said Portland attorney Jason Kafoury.\n\nIn a series of statements in the week following Massey's ouster, the hotel 'sincerely apologized,' announced it had placed the guard and the manager on leave and then later said they were fired.\n\nHilton said in a Wednesday statement that it accelerated scheduled training for all franchise properties globally and worked with the DoubleTree by Hilton Portland, Oregon, an independently owned and operated property, to ensure their employees have completed the diversity and unconscious bias training.\n\n'Hilton has zero tolerance for racism and is committed to providing a welcoming environment for all guests,' the statement said.\n\nOther videos posted by Massey show him talking to hotel staff at the Hilton DoubleTree as he was kicked out of the hotel\n\nMassey's lawsuit seeks $3 million for his frustration, humiliation and feelings of racial stigmatization. The suit also gives notice that Massey intends to sue for an additional $7 million in punitive damages.\n\nIn addition to the local DoubleTree and the Hilton corporation, the suit also lists the security guard and manager as defendants.\n\nSoon after the original incident, posted footage on Instagram showing his confrontations first with staff at the hotel and then a city police officer.\n\nIn the clip, Massey can be heard attempting to explain to staff that he had been on the phone to his mother when he was reported by Hilton porters in the lobby.\n\nMassey, from Kent, Washington, claims he was targeted by a security guard because he is black and that this led to him being kicked out of the hotel.\n\nIn the recording of the incident Massey posted, the guard says that he was calling the cops because Massey was loitering, despite Massey holding his room key card.\n\nPortland police then arrived and escorted Massey out of the hotel. He said he was allowed to get his belongings from his room and check out at the front desk while police waited.\n\nMassey claimed he was 'racially profiled' during the incident although the hotel said it was the result of a 'misunderstanding'\n\n'Tonight I was racially profiled and discriminated against for taking a phone call in the lobby of my hotel,' Massey wrote on Instagram.\n\n'He [the security guard] said that I was a safety threat to the other guests and that I was trespassing and said that I was a disturbance because I took a personal phone call from my mom in a more remote area of the lobby.\n\n'I cannot believe the level of professionalism that this hotel property had with me tonight. It is never ok to discriminate against guests for the color of their skin and to prejudge them based on your own bias against that race.'\n\nHowever, the DoubleTree in Portland, Oregon claimed soon afterwards that the entire incident took place because of a 'misunderstanding'.\n\nPaul Peralta, general manager of the DoubleTree, told OregonLive Monday that he has reached out to Massey to try to amend the situation.\n\n'Safety and security of our guests and associates is our top priority at the Doubletree by Hilton Portland,' Peralta said in a statement. 'This unfortunate incident is likely the result of a misunderstanding between our hotel and guest.\n\n'We are sorry that this matter ended the way it did. We are place of public accommodation and do not discriminate against any individuals or groups.'", "description": "A hotel guest whose lawyers say he was ousted from a Hilton DoubleTree hotel in Oregon for 'calling his mother while black' from his cellphone in the hotel lobby is seeking $10 million in a lawsuit.", "authors": ["George Martin For Mailonline", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/22/19512468-0-image-a-5_1570656986639.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
