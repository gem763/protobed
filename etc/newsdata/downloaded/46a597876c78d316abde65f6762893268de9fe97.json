(Courtesy of Carl Snowden)\n\nLeaders at the U.S. Naval Academy have launched an investigation after an employee reported a noose was hung in the school\u2019s engineering building on Aug. 28, the 56th anniversary of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech and the March on Washington.\n\nOfficials at the military school in Annapolis didn\u2019t find out about the alleged incident until about a week later, on Friday, said Jenny Erickson, a Naval Academy spokeswoman, in an email.\n\nA photo shows what appears to be a rope tied into a noose and hung in an off-limits construction zone in Rickover Hall, Vice Adm. Sean Buck, Naval Academy superintendent, said in a statement.\n\nBuck said the rope could have been part of the construction site. Rickover Hall is undergoing \u201csignificant\u201d ceiling work that includes new ductwork and piping.\n\n\u201cWhile there is a possibility for the alleged noose to have been part of a hoisting system to complete this ductwork, the academy takes all allegations of race hate very seriously, and is working quickly and diligently to determine the facts surrounding the reported incident, specifically why the reported incident was not brought to light sooner,\u201d Buck said.\n\nCarl Snowden, a civil rights leader in Annapolis, said he received a photo of the alleged noose from an anonymous sender in August.\n\nSnowden commended Buck and the academy for opening an investigation. Buck, a Trump administration appointee, started his term as superintendent in July.\n\n\u201cThis is really the first opportunity we\u2019ll see how the Naval Academy handles an issue that has racial overtones,\u201d Snowden said. \u201cI think they\u2019re taking it seriously.\u201d\n\nThe academy\u2019s investigation was announced one day before a marker to commemorate the lynchings of at least five black men in Anne Arundel County was unveiled in downtown Annapolis. The Naval Academy is in the central part of the county.\n\n\u201cAnne Arundel County has a history of racial intolerance,\u201d Snowden said. \u201cThe marker represents an unvarnished and unfiltered truth.\u201d\n\nThe men \u2014 Henry Davis, John Sims, George Briscoe, Wright Smith and King Johnson \u2014 were snatched up by white mobs while they were on their way to jail or awaiting trial behind bars.\n\n\u201cThe majority of them were accused of assaulting white women,\u201d Snowden said.\n\nDavis, who died in 1906 on the campus of St. John\u2019s College in Annapolis, was hanged and shot more than 100 times, Snowden said. A picture of his mutilated body was imprinted on postcards that were sold.\n\nThe Naval Academy\u2019s investigation comes at a time when incidents of hate are on the rise in Anne Arundel County. The number of hate- and bias-related crimes increased 34 percent \u2014 from 47 to 63 \u2014 between 2016 and 2017, according to data from Maryland State Police. Schools have regularly been the targets of nooses, swastikas and other hateful symbols.\n\nAt Chesapeake Bay Middle School, about 20 miles southeast of Baltimore by car, two nooses \u2014 one made out of toilet paper and another made from a sweatshirt drawstring \u2014 were hung in a two-month span, the Capital Gazette reported in December. The month before, fliers promoting the Ku Klux Klan were distributed in neighborhoods in northern Anne Arundel County.\n\n\u201cGiven the fact that in Anne Arundel County we have had a series of nooses at the schools and within the community, you have to take it seriously,\u201d Snowden said about the Naval Academy.\n\nOther universities in the Washington region have contended with racist episodes on their campuses.\n\nPosters bearing the Confederate battle flag and chunks of cotton were found almost two years ago on American University\u2019s campus in Northwest Washington. At least 10 posters were discovered at a handful of locations on campus. Those posters appeared just months after bananas were found hanging from strings in the shape of nooses at the university.\n\nAt George Washington University, a sorority apologized in 2018 for a \u201cracist image\u201d that a member posted on Snapchat. The post showed two young women, a banana and a caption referencing race.\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "An employee reported seeing a rope on the anniversary of Rev.
