But more than 90 percent of those who participated in the controversial vote backed independence from Spain.\n\nThroughout Catalonia, rioting grew increasingly violent Wednesday night, with hooded demonstrators burning cars and hundreds of dumpsters, throwing molotov cocktails and blocking the streets of Barcelona and other Catalan cities. Earlier in the week, protesters also descended on Barcelona's international airport, causing significant flight disruptions.\n\nIn clashes with Catalan and national police, rioters hid behind flaming barricades and threw bottles and heavy objects at them. Police forces fired foam bullets, swung batons and drove armored vans at high speeds to disperse the tens of thousands of masked rioters.\n\nPedro S\u00e1nchez, Spain\u2019s acting prime minister, met with Interior Ministry and security officials to track the situation unfolding in Catalonia, an affluent northeastern region whose capital is Barcelona. The riots erupted less than a month before Spaniards head to the polls for the fourth time in less than four years, as S\u00e1nchez, a Socialist, struggles to form a government.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI have met with the main parliamentary leaders to address the situation in Catalonia,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said in a statement Wednesday, urging Catalan leaders to denounce the violence. \u201cI have invited them to maintain unity in the face of this challenge. Violent groups want to divide us. That is their only hope. They must find us firm, calm and united.\u201d\n\nS\u00e1nchez said restraint and proportionate response would steer the government's reaction.\n\n\u201cModeration is also a form of strength,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said in his nationally televised address Wednesday night. \u201cWe are not going to overreact. We are going to be calm and firm. And I am sure that Catalonia will reestablish its ability to live together.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSanchez called on Torra to condemn the violence explicitly.\n\nTorra, whose office also oversees Catalonia\u2019s regional police force, sent mixed messages Wednesday, refusing to answer reporters\u2019 questions about whether he condemned the violence while participating in a peaceful protest.\n\nAD\n\nLate Wednesday night, he blamed the violent scenes on isolated groups of extremist activists. \u201cWe cannot allow groups of infiltrators and provocateurs to ruin the image of millions of Catalans who have always taken to the street in a peaceful way.\u201d\n\nBut by Thursday morning, Torra was encouraging pro-independence protesters to continue \u201ccivil disobedience.\u201d He said he would push forward with independence and would hold a referendum by the end of his term.\n\nRead more\n\nAD", "description": "Protesters clashed with police in Barcelona and throughout Catalonia, leaving more than 90 injured on both sides.", "authors": ["Pamela Rolfe", "James Mcauley", "Foreign Correspondent Focusing On French", "European Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/4IOb66Won4f7TbsHHz4AEtC5noo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6HEZXUHQ3AI6TNSIO26PQ3VWPY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
