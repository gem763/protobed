Some got out ahead of the deadline by releasing their fundraising hauls early. Others, such as Wayne Messam, the little-known Democratic mayor of Miramar, Florida, and for some reason also a presidential candidate, did not.\n\nBut with the deadline comes full reports from all of the candidates and a clearer picture of where they stand, money-wise, 110 days before the Iowa caucuses. The top-line figure is total money raised and Bernie Sanders led in the third quarter by bringing in $25.2 million. His Senate colleague, Elizabeth Warren, was not far behind with $24.6 million. Pete Buttigieg surprised with $19.1 million, Joe Biden disappointed with $15.7 million, and Kamala Harris rounded out the top five with $11.7 million.\n\nThere are some other noteworthy nuggets buried in these reports, including:\n\nWayne Messam raised just $5.\n\nYou could have watched every minute of every presidential debate so far and never known that Messam is running for president. But he is. The mayor of Miramar, which is bigger than South Bend, reported raising just $5 in the third quarter. On the plus side, that\u2019s five more dollars than he spent.\n\nJoe Biden\u2019s bank account is dwindling.\n\nThe former vice-president doesn\u2019t just trail Senators Sanders and Warren in fundraising, he trails them in amount of money on hand. With $8.98 million in his bank account, Biden is also lagging behind Buttigieg and Harris.\n\nPolitico explains that the problem is tied to Biden\u2019s reliance on big-money donors:\n\nAs Biden\u2019s campaign spending picked up over the summer, his reliance on maximum donors \u2014 who can give only once and are not a renewable campaign resource \u2014 meant that his fundraising could not keep pace. More than one-third of Biden\u2019s contributions came from maximum donors in the second quarter, and max-out donors composed a similar portion of a smaller pie for Biden this quarter.\n\nThat could also explain why Biden was underwater in the third quarter, spending nearly $2 million more than he brought in.\n\nTen candidates spent more than they brought in.\n\nIt\u2019s never good when you spend more money than you make, and that\u2019s what ten candidates did last quarter. But the candidate whose numbers were the most mismatched is Amy Klobuchar. The Minnesota senator spent $7.8 million and brought in $4.8 million. That\u2019s good for a 162 percent burn rate.\n\nTom Steyer is his own biggest fan.\n\nThe California billionaire spent big in the third quarter after getting into the race in early July, dropping a staggering $47 million, a sum that the L.A. Times says \u201cplaces him on track to join the biggest self-funding political candidates in American history.\u201d The $47 million is nearly all of the $49.6 million that Steyer brought in during the third quarter. Who did the money come from? Nearly $1.5 million from small donors, a half million from large donors, and $47.6 million from Steyer himself.", "description": "Third-quarter fundraising totals were due this week and the data provides a look at who\u2019s up and who\u2019s down in the Democratic primary.", "authors": ["Adam K.
