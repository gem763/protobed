We have more of everything than we've had before. More jet fighters. When I came here 50% of our jet fighters didn't fly ... So we are very high on ammunition now,\" Trump said.\n\nThis came after the president said it \"certainly would look\" as though Iran is behind an attack on major Saudi oil facilities that's disrupted 5% of the daily global oil supply.\n\n\"It's looking that way,\" Trump said on whether Iran is responsible.\n\n\"We'll let you know definitively,\" Trump added. \"That's being checked out right now.\"\n\nWhen asked if he has a message for Iran, Trump said he'll have \"a stronger message or maybe no message at all when we get the final results of what we're looking at.\"\n\nRead more: The Trump administration has no idea what it wants to do about Iran\n\nTrump also said he doesn't want a war with Iran and is \"not concerned at all\" about the prospect of an all-out war in the Middle East.\n\n\"Do I want war? I don't want war with anybody,\" he said.\n\nBut Trump also said the US has \"the strongest military in the world\" and is \"prepared more than anybody.\"\n\nIran-backed Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for the attack on the oil facilities, and the Iranian government has denied any responsibility.\n\nHowever, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Saturday blamed Iran explicitly for the attack, tweeting, \"Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world's energy supply. There is no evidence the attacks came from Yemen.\"\n\nSaudi Arabia on Monday said Iranian weapons were used in the attack and that it did not originate in Yemen.", "description": "Trump said it's \"looking\" as though Iran is responsible for the Saudi oil field attack but said he doesn't \"want war with anybody.\"", "authors": ["John Haltiwanger"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7ffa0c2e22af2f2d68744a-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
