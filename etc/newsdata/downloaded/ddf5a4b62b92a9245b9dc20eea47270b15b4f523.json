I fear that if we don't do it now we won't be able to make these reforms in times of stress\" warned Federal Finance Housing Agency director Mark Calabria during an appearance on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe two GSE\u2019s do not originate loans \u2013 instead they purchase and guarantee them on the secondary market. They guarantee more than half of the nation\u2019s mortgages.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nThe plan to reform the duo \u2013 which have been under conservatorship for more than a decade following the financial crisis \u2013 includes eventually removing the government-sponsored entities from conservatorship, which has been a longtime goal of the Trump administration or going through receivership, although nothing has been decided according to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.\n\nThe wildcard in any reform is what happens to the shareholders, which includes major hedge fund players such as Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Capital.\n\nOn Tuesday, Calabria said these shareholders should have been wiped out in 2008 and he warned they are not safe this time around.\n\n\"If the circumstances present themselves to where we have to wipe out the shareholders we will,\" he said in response to a question from Rep. Bill Foster (D-IL).\n\nCalabria's remark sent a chill to investors who are betting big bucks will come their way if Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac get taken out from under government control. As of 2012, profits from Fannie and Freddie have been redirected to the U.S. Treasury, in what\u2019s known as a net worth sweep.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nFOX Business' Brittany De Lea contributed to this report.\n\nRelated Articles", "description": "Shareholders of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac got a scare today.", "authors": ["Suzanne O'Halloran"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
