The sudden entry of a large issuer like Ford F, -1.26% into the high-yield bond market could weigh on prices for junk corporate credit.\n\nThe U.S. carmaker\u2019s more than $35 billion of debt would represent around 3% of the high-yield index. If one more credit ratings firm downgrades Ford, it would become the fifth biggest \u201cfallen angel,\u201d or high-yield issuer once rated as investment-grade.\n\nAnalysts point to 2005 as a example of how fallen angels could overwhelm demand as investors struggle to absorb the bonds of the new entrant into the high-yield market.\n\nBack then, troubles in the U.S. car industry saw both General Motors and Ford lose their investment-grade status. The junk bond market choked on the influx of supply as the total debt outstanding issued by both firms exceeded more than 12% of the overall market.\n\nAs a result, Marty Fridson, chief investment officer of Lehmann Livian Fridson Advisors, estimated the downgrade of General Motors and its subsidiaries alone had caused high-yield credit spreads to widen by 50 points in 2005.\n\nIn other words, the extra premium investors demanded in return for owning a basket of junk bonds over comparable U.S. Treasurys had increased by another 50 basis points.\n\nInvestors have until now mostly focused on the $3 trillion worth of BBB-rated investment grade debt that is on the precipice of being downgraded to a junk rating, and may need to be sold by conservative investors like pension funds and insurance companies barred from holding debt from high-yield issuers.\n\nBut Hans Mikkelsen, head of U.S. investment grade bond strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said Ford\u2019s downgrade is more of an outlier in a largely improving story for the BBB-rated market.\n\n\u201cWe think the Ford situation is idiosyncratic and has little read-through for the BBB-rated segment of the IG market where companies are less cyclical and using levers (cutting dividends, selling assets, etc.) to defend their IG ratings,\u201d said Mikkelsen.\n\nSee: Ford\u2019s debt rating gets downgraded to junk by Moody\u2019s\n\nOpinion: The investing opportunity of a lifetime awaits us when the recession arrives", "description": "High-yield investors may struggle to digest the bonds from large fallen angels, high-yield issuers once rated investment-grade.", "authors": ["Sunny Oh"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR024_junk1_ZG_20190910135316.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
