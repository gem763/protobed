But if this does end up being true, it\u2019ll be interesting to see how the editors decided to spin it.\n\nSo mid-ceremony, Timm just \u201call of a sudden, he just legs it out of there\u201d.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t even say anything \u2013 and everyone was so confused,\u201d the Woman\u2019s Day source blabbed.\n\n\u201cAngie kept asking the crew what was going on and they wouldn\u2019t say so, so she started to think that he must be leaving the show \u2013 she was devastated.\u201d\n\nApparently, Angie wasn\u2019t allowed to see Timm because he was with the paramedics\u2026 or drama\u2026 both, maybe.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile the producers just kept pulling her aside to have chats,\u201d the source continued, which must\u2019ve sucked.\n\nFortunately, ol\u2019 mate was alright. He later told the boys that he \u201cfelt like he was about to collapse\u201d so he made a beeline for the door to get some air.\n\nThe source added that it takes \u201chours\u201d to shoot the rose ceremonies, and it\u2019s \u201ca lot of people crammed into the space\u201d so it can be claustrophobic. And look, fair enough.\n\nThe Bachelor continues 7.30pm Wednesday and Thursday on Channel 10. We\u2019re copping a brand new bachelor this week, and Angie knows him.
