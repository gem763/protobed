In police work, this can be crucial\u2014a matter of life and death, even. It often involves protecting vulnerable witnesses, keeping upcoming operations hush hush, or protecting a fellow police officer who\u2019s working undercover.\n\nYet not long after, someone working in the gang crimes division ran a car license plate mentioned in his case and was able to read the entire file. \u201cCan you please look at this?\u201d DeBrabander wrote to a Palantir engineer in an email, which was obtained by Backchannel in response to public records requests.\n\nMark Harris is a freelance journalist reporting on technology from Seattle. Sign up to get Backchannel's weekly newsletter.\n\nPalantir had been selling its data storage, analysis, and collaboration software to police departments nationwide on the basis of rock-solid security. \u201cPalantir Law Enforcement provides robust, built-in privacy and civil liberties protections, including granular access controls and advanced data retention capabilities,\u201d its website reads.\n\nBut DeBrabander had a hard time getting Palantir to respond, emails show. Two weeks after he made his first complaint, his sensitive case was still an open book to other detectives at Long Beach PD. \u201cI went over to Gangs and had them run the plate since they are not listed in our confidentiality group, and sure enough the plate was found within the narrative of the very report we want to keep tight control on,\u201d he complained in an email to Palantir. Four months later, his case was still visible to other officers, and he was still sending emails to Palantir to fix the problem.\n\nLaw enforcement accounts for just a small part of Palantir\u2019s business, which mostly consists of military clients, intelligence outfits like the CIA or Homeland Security, and large financial institutions. In police departments, Palantir\u2019s tools are now being used to flag traffic scofflaws, parole violators, and other everyday infractions. But the police departments that deploy Palantir are also dependent upon it for some of their most sensitive work. Palantir\u2019s software can ingest and sift through millions of digital records across multiple jurisdictions, spotting links and sharing data to make or break cases.\n\nThe scale of Palantir\u2019s implementation, the type, quantity and persistence of the data it processes, and the unprecedented access that many thousands of people have to that data all raise significant concerns about privacy, equity, racial justice, and civil rights. But until now, we haven\u2019t known very much about how the system works, who is using it, and what their problems are. And neither Palantir nor many of the police departments that use it are willing to talk about it.\n\nIn one of the largest systematic investigations of the company to date, Backchannel filed dozens of public records requests with police forces across America. When Palantir started selling its products to law enforcement, it also laid a paper trail. All 50 states have public records laws providing access to contracts, documents, and emails of local and government bodies. That makes it possible to peer inside the company\u2019s police-related operations in ways that simply aren\u2019t possible with its national security work.", "description": "A Backchannel investigation reveals the difficult issues police and communities face when they adopt Palantir's secretive data-scooping software.", "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Mark Harri", "Jessi Hempel", "Gabriel Nicholas", "Susan Crawford", "Scott Rosenberg", "Peter Rubin", "Tom Simonite", "Christopher Ryan", "Maria Goodavage"], "top_image": "https://media.wired.com/photos/598a2b2bfd3ab00b55b4b863/master/w_2560,c_limit/PalantirIllo1.jpg", "published_at": "2017-08-09"}
