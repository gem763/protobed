REUTERS/Murad Sezer\n\nWitnesses in the city of 15 million, Turkey\u2019s largest, felt buildings sway and said some offices and schools were temporarily evacuated. Three major seismic fault lines criss-cross Istanbul, which straddles Europe and Asia.\n\n\u201cThe quake really shook at the start and then it continued, maybe it felt like that because the building is so tall,\u201d said Ozge Etcan, 27, an employee at a financial firm in Istanbul\u2019s Levent district, where crowds gathered outside in the aftermath.\n\nThe tremor was at a depth of 12.6 km, the Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institute said, locating its epicentre 70 km (44 miles) west of Istanbul in the Marmara Sea, south of the town of Silivri. It struck at 1:59 p.m. (1059 GMT).\n\nBoth the observatory and the U.S. Geological Survey assessed its magnitude at 5.7.\n\n\u201cDespite this earthquake having a magnitude that could be considered serious, we have not as yet received heartbreaking news, just some small damage,\u201d President Tayyip Erdogan told a news conference.\n\nHe said eight people had been treated for slight injuries, but did not provide further details.\n\nThe top section of a minaret had collapsed at the central mosque in Istanbul\u2019s Avcilar district, close to the Marmara Sea, CNN Turk footage showed.\n\nAnother minaret collapsed in the Sariyer district of the city, the municipality\u2019s disaster coordination center said.\n\n\u201cThere will be aftershocks of this quake. What we ask from citizens is that they don\u2019t enter damaged buildings,\u201d Murat Nurlu, head of the earthquake department at Turkey\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Management Directorate (AFAD), told Reuters.\n\nSOME BUILDINGS DAMAGED\n\nCracks emerged in some buildings across the city. Two of them in the Sultangazi and Eyup districts were damaged, AFAD said in a statement, clocking the quake at 5.8 magnitude.\n\nMobile phone users had difficulty making calls shortly after the quake. AFAD said work was continuing to resolve the problem in communications.\n\nThe epicentre was 22 km from the nearest inhabited area, Silivri, AFAD said. It said there had been 28 aftershocks, the strongest of which had a magnitude of 4.1.\n\nThe Istanbul governor\u2019s office said primary and middle schools had been ordered shut for the remainder of the day.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nIn 1999, a quake measuring 7.6 struck the city of Izmit, 90 km southeast of Istanbul, killing more than 17,000 people.\n\nRecep Kutuk, a 37-year-old civil servant, said he experienced two major earthquakes in the region in 1999 and this had made him sensitive to any tremor.\n\n\u201cIt was really powerful. I hope this is not a precursor to another major earthquake,\u201d he said.", "description": "A moderate 5.7 magnitude earthquake shook buildings and damaged two mosques in Istanbul on Thursday, slightly injuring eight people and causing residents to rush from buildings.", "authors": ["Ali Kucukgocmen", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434179378&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P1CM", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
