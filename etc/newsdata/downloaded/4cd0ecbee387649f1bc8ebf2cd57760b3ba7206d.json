That\u2019s scary,\u201d he wrote about the woman who has long been bullied for her looks as a result of a rare congenital disease. Velasquez reposted it in an effort to encourage more kindness.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to give you the benefit of the doubt and say you didn\u2019t mean to say this directly to me,\u201d Velasquez wrote in her caption address to Martinez. \u201cSince October is national anti bullying awareness month, let\u2019s take this as a learning moment and remember even \u2018joking\u2019 like this to a friend can always end up hurting someone else.\u201d\n\nVelasquez\u2019s comment section quickly filled up with positive sentiments from friends and followers who assured her that she is \u201cbeautiful, amazing, and a wonderful example to us.\u201d Others shared their upset about Martinez\u2019s remark.\n\n\u201cThis is disrespectful & just rude. I\u2019m so sorry about people like this in the world,\u201d one person wrote. Another said, \u201cGood for you for calling him out!\u201d\n\nVelasquez clarified in a statement to Yahoo Lifestyle that her intention in bringing attention to the message was so that it could be used as a lesson for both kids and adults on social media.\n\n\u201cWhether you have a blue check mark next to your name or a private account with a few followers, your keyboard has power. There will always be someone on the other end of the screen and those few words, accidental or not, can really hurt someone,\u201d she said. \u201cMy parents raised me to believe in the power and importance of forgiveness. I\u2019ve forgiven the person who posted the \u2018Worlds Ugliest Woman\u2019 video of me and I will forgive Mr. Martinez exactly the same.\u201d\n\nMartinez didn\u2019t immediately respond to Yahoo Lifestyle\u2019s request for comment. However, he did post an apology to his social media accounts.\n\n\u201cThat DM was NOT an attempt to bully her. It was a mistake,\u201d Martinez wrote of his message. \u201cAccidental or not, it was a horrible thing to say and I promise to be better.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "Lizzie Velasquez, once called the \"world's ugliest woman,\" is using her social media to bring attention to a recent instance of cyberbullying.", "authors": ["Kerry Justich"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eByFZ41KOVPtbUDJsnzTtA--~B/aD05MDA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/4d8fb340-e941-11e9-8ffb-96cd12786c33", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
