A \"super Sunday\" if you will. I am sure you are all familiar with the rescheduled qualifying but if you are not, here's a short recap of what's happened so far.\n\nQualifying was moved from Saturday to Sunday morning, due to the threat of severe weather conditions from Typhoon Hagibis. Qualifying began at 2am BST this morning and Sebastian Vettel took pole position ahead of Ferrari team-mate Charles Leclerc. Q1 was red flagged twice after crashes on the pit straight from Robert Kubica and Kevin Magnussen but, hopefully, both cars should be able to be repaired in time for them to start the race.\n\nAlthough Ferrari have had the quickest car since we returned from the summer break but, still, they did not top any sessions until Q1 this morning and then looked some way off the pace in Q2. But Vettel pulled a brilliant lap out to lead his team-mate on the front row, with both Mercedes cars - Valtteri Bottas ahead - around two tenths away in third and fourth.\n\nHere's what the top three had to say after qualifying a little earlier:\n\nVettel - 1st\n\nI think we are quite surprised. We didn't expect that. It was unbelievable. We had a headwind up the esses which is just what you want. I don't think I used the brakes other than turn two.\n\nLeclerc - 2nd\n\nSeb did an amazing lap and today he just deserved to be on pole. To be honest I was pretty happy with my lap apart from in the last sector where I did a few mistakes but pole was not possible. Seb was just too quick. Mercedes are very quick in the race so it's not going to be easy.\n\nBottas - 3rd\n\nWe seemed quite strong, but they are quicker on the straight lines. We are trying everything we can to get ahead, nothing is lost for us yet.\n\nThe race begins at the planned time of 6.10am BST and I'll be here to take you through all of it. Can Vettel take Ferrari's fourth win of the season and fourth in five races? Or will Leclerc or Mercedes fight back?", "description": "To the mega day of F1 action at Suzuka for the Japanese Grand Prix.", "authors": ["Luke Slater"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/formula-1/2019/10/13/TELEMMGLPICT000212866729-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqkzRVrpaG8pgYx8zuruU0oLxVMM-N2Dh3uu4C0ivbnMw.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
