Its wealth management and consumer businesses accounted for 60 percent of revenues in the year to end-June.\n\nAnalysts at Citi said in a recent report it has \u201cbetter profitability than the system average, higher revenue growth, lower risk profile versus peers and solid capital\u201d.\n\nBut a person familiar with Del Vecchio\u2019s thinking said he believes the bank could be managed better, noting that its 13% stake in Generali accounts for about 30% of operating profit.\n\nThe person said Del Vecchio, who also holds a 5% stake in the insurer, wanted to change Mediobanca\u2019s governance rule to ensure he will have a say in the choice of the next chief executive when Nagel\u2019s mandate comes up for renewal next year.\n\nAlthough his intentions are still unclear, three sources close to the situation said Del Vecchio aims, through his stake in Mediobanca, to engineer the future of Generali, including through possible cross-border deals.\n\nDel Vecchio blames Nagel, and the insurer\u2019s CEO, Philippe Donnet, for what he sees as Generali\u2019s poor share price performance compared to rivals like Allianz (ALVG.DE) or Axa (AXAF.PA). While he would favor a tie-up with a foreign rival, he wants to ensure Generali\u2019s Italian identity is preserved, the sources said.", "description": "Mediobanca should rely less on contributions from the investment bank's consumer credit unit and its stake in insurer Generali in a business plan due to be unveiled next month, shareholder Leonardo Del Vecchio said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Claudia Cristoferi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
