Betraying the Kurds would force them to align with the Assad regime and Iran and would ensure the comeback of ISIS. It would be, he tweeted, \u201ca stain on America\u2019s honor,\u201d and a virtual surrender to the terrorists.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump may be tired of fighting radical Islam,\u201d he wrote pointedly of his good friend. \u201cThey are NOT tired of fighting us.\u201d And he commented on the signal Trump\u2019s decision sent to the world: \u201cBy abandoning the Kurds we have sent the most dangerous signal possible \u2013 America is an unreliable ally and it\u2019s just a matter of time before China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea act out in dangerous ways.\u201c\n\nIn his cruelest cut of all, he compared Trump to Barack Obama. \u201cNo matter what President Trump is saying about his decision,\u201d wrote Graham on Twitter, \u201cit is EXACTLY what President Obama did in Iraq with even more disastrous consequences for our national security.\u201d\n\nGraham\u2019s disappointment was palpable, but understandable, given all that he has given up to avoid this moment.\n\nFor the last several years, Graham has transformed himself from one of Trump\u2019s fiercest critics, into one of his most reflexive defenders. Even by the cynical and shape-shifting standards of Washington, Graham\u2019s metamorphosis has been a thing of wonder. The senator once known as John McCain\u2019s best friend in the Senate, transformed himself into Trump\u2019s shinebox, willing to ingratiate himself with rationalizations and praise even as Trump became increasingly erratic.\n\nAt first, it was a mere curiosity. During the 2016 campaign, Graham had called Trump a \u201cnutjob\u201d and a loser,\u201d as well as a \u201ca race-baiting, xenophobic, religious bigot.\u201d He predicted that if the GOP nominated him, \u201cwe will get destroyed.......and we will deserve it.\u201d\n\nBut as McCain faded from the scene, Graham seemed to shift his affections to the man who so publicly insulted McCain.\n\nGraham and Trump became a thing. They played golf. They talked on the phone. And an alliance of the oddest imaginable bedfellows was born.\n\nIn moments of candor, Graham tried to explain the deal he thought he was making. When Mark Leibovich asked him earlier this year what had happened to him, Graham explained:\n\n\u201cWell, O.K., from my point of view, if you know anything about me, it\u2019d be odd not to do this,\u201d he said.\n\nI asked what \u201cthis\u201d was. \u201c \u2018This,\u2019 \u201d Graham said, \u201cis to try to be relevant.\u201d Politics, he explained, was the art of what works and what brings desired outcomes. \u201cI\u2019ve got an opportunity up here working with the president to get some really good outcomes for the country,\u201d he told me.\n\nLike many others in his party, staying \u201crelevant\u201d was central to their political calculations. Capitulating to Trump meant that Graham would become a rock star in the increasingly Trumpist party and virtually assured of re-election in South Carolina next year.\n\nHe would also have the president\u2019s ear. And this was at the heart of Graham\u2019s Bargain.\n\nGraham told himself: by staying close to Trump, he could influence him and prevent horribly bad decisions. Others made the same calculation, but Graham made the uber-tradeoff, because the stakes were so high. What did it matter if he had to endure temporary embarrassments, abase himself on cable television, or even become a political punchline, if he could stop Trump from impulsive decisions regarding Russia or North Korea? Or Syria?\n\nThe world saw Graham as a craven, cringing Uriah Heep. Graham saw himself as someone who could save the world, or at least the Kurds.\n\nGraham calculated: If he didn\u2019t play golf with Trump and indulge his penchant for pillow talk, Trump would be putting and chatting with Rand Paul, listening to the counsels of isolationism, appeasement and international amorality. He was not simply the adult in the room; he was the adult BFF in the room, who would temper Trump\u2019s worst instincts.\n\nAnd then came Trump\u2019s decision.\n\nDespite Graham\u2019s compulsive turd-polishing of the last few years, Trump didn\u2019t even consult him before making the decision to abandon the Kurds. Graham, who had given up so much self-respect to prevent just this outcome, was not even in the room. He didn\u2019t even get a text.\n\nThis is the thing about Faustian bargains. The price is high and the rewards turn out to be illusory. They end badly.\n\nThis week, Lindsey Graham, found that out the hard way. I wonder what they\u2019ll talk about the next time they go golfing together.", "description": "He traded his honor to be \u201crelevant\u201d as a Trump adviser.
