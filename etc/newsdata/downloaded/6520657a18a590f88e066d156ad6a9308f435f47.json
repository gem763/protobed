And I promise that I will make ISIS great again!\u201d Davidson continued.\n\n\u201cTerrific! What a great guy. ISIS is back in a big, big way,\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cAnd we love that.\u201d\n\nIndeed just as Saturday Night Live was lampooning the president, Trump had already taken to Twitter to tease his national address, in which he spoke to the nation and the world in great detail about the raid.\n\nSomething very big has just happened! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 27, 2019\n\nIn a national address from the White House Sunday, President Trump said of al-Baghdadi: \u201cLast night the United States brought the world\u2019s number one terrorist leader to justice, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is dead. He was the founder and leader of ISIS, the most ruthless and violent terror organization anywhere in the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe died after running into a dead-end tunnel, whimpering and crying and screaming all the way,\u201d Trump said.\n\nJerome Hudson is Breitbart News Entertainment Editor and author of the bestselling book 50 Things They Don\u2019t Want You to Know.
