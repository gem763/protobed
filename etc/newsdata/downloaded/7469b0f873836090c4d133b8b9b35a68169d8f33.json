Imagine too that the company makes no promises about whether or not you'll get any return for what was spent. Imagine further that you are competing with other, much larger brands for this advertising space and that it's all under control of that one company. Imagine that you literally have no other options.\n\nYou don't have to imagine this. It's reality. It's Google and it\u2019s Facebook, and if you're a small business owner trying to attract new customers online, this is the impossible task you face. Every day.\n\nBoth companies have created amazing technologies that have literally changed humankind for the better. But there\u2019s been a big cost: Our loss of privacy and competition. While drawing hundreds of millions of consumers to many of its free services, the two tech giants have also accumulated a monstrous amount of data \u2014 and power.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAs I\u2019ve previously written, Google now owns \u2013 according to some industry experts \u2013 close to 90 percent of online search through its many platforms. That not only includes its search engine, but also YouTube, Gmail, Chrome, office apps, storage, web-hosting and hundreds of millions of smartphones and tablets running its Android operating system on more than 76 percent of mobile devices around the world. Facebook has already demonstrated that it can slant the kind of news, videos, ads and information its billions of daily users receive.\n\nGetting found online has become a critical strategy for any business trying to sell its products or build a brand. Unfortunately, the trillions of dollars of worldwide revenues that come from being found online are under the watchful eyes and control of Google\u2019s and Facebook\u2019s search and advertising illuminati, and no one knows how it all really works.\n\nBut it\u2019s the only game in town, so we\u2019re forced to play. And if you want to play in this game, you\u2019ve got to pay. And because there's no competition, Google and Facebook\u2019s ability to charge whatever they want \u2013 let alone track those mysterious \"clicks\" and \"views\" that quickly eats up advertising budgets \u2013 goes unchecked. Who knows if those numbers are right? Who knows where your ads are showing? Who knows if they\u2019re even showing at all?\n\nAll of that is well and fine for big brands, which have enormous budgets that will certainly catch the attention of the Google/Facebook gods. But it puts the millions of small businesses in this country at a huge disadvantage.\n\nEnter Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Ann WarrenSupport drops for Medicare for All but increases for public option Hillicon Valley: Warren takes on Facebook over political ads | Zuckerberg defends meetings with conservatives | Civil liberties groups sound alarm over online extremism bill Feehery: Trump may be down, but he's not out yet MORE. The current front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination wants to break up these tech giants. Good for her.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWarren wants to turn these companies into utilities, which would effectively require \u2013 due to anti-trust concerns \u2013 a breakup. Google's parent company, Alphabet, for example, would likely have to spin off some of its 200 prized holdings, including YouTube, GMail and Chrome, to avoid this conflict. Warren also wants to regulate acquisitions that seek to control markets like when Google gobbled up traffic system app Waze and made it disappear inside of Maps (which controls 67 percent of the navigation market), or when it bought home and office automation technology maker Nest to help automate homes and offices, and gather data and drive traffic and sell ads.\n\n\"As these companies have grown larger and more powerful, they have used their resources and control over the way we use the Internet to squash small businesses and innovation, and substitute their own financial interests for the broader interests of the American people,\" Warren said in a statement. \"To restore the balance of power in our democracy, to promote competition, and to ensure that the next generation of technology innovation is as vibrant as the last, it's time to break up our biggest tech companies.\"\n\nI don\u2019t know if Warren is a socialist or not. And when it comes to this issue, I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m a long-time free-market capitalist. Google, in particular, is killing competition, and Warren\u2019s plan to break it up would have a few very significant effects on countless small businesses like mine.\n\nFor example, it would enable more search engines like Bing, Yahoo and many others to expand their reach and thereby give me and other small business owners better (and more fairly priced) options for our advertising budgets. Different search engines will likely be more attractive to different demographic groups. Having a more affordable, competitive and focused set of search tools to choose from would absolutely get us more bang for the advertising bucks.\n\nVideo is another elusive tool for many small businesses like mine. We would like to produce more. But who\u2019s going to find them amongst all the noisy influencers and brands that are out-maneuvering us? Anything that could chip away at YouTube's more than 73 percent share over the video market would help my videos find the right audience at a more affordable price.\n\nOr perhaps giving more startups the ability to create competing (and better) applications for mobile messaging, mapping, internet browsing (Chrome owns 70 percent of this market), email (Gmail controls a \"paltry\" 27 percent of the email market) and collaboration will result in more great products, more opportunities and more options for both these entrepreneurs and their small business customers.\n\nWarren's plan would do this, and as a small business owner, I love it.\n\nGene Marks is founder of The Marks Group, a small-business consulting firm.
