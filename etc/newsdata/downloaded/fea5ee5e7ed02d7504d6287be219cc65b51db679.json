With this, the government essentially declared to the world that Hong Kong is no longer beholden to legal procedures,\" Cheung said.\n\nA former British colony, Hong Kong was returned to China in 1997 under a \"one country, two systems\" framework, which guarantees Hong Kong people rights and freedoms under an independent judiciary.\n\nEven as Lam invoked the ordinance, last used in 1967 during a months-long riot, she said: \"We're not proclaiming Hong Kong is entering a state of emergency.\"\n\nThe ordinance gives Lam sweeping powers to legalise internment, suspend due process, block the internet and censor the media, among other things.\n\nJudicial review\n\nMeanwhile, the High Court heard a challenge on Friday night to the ban in the form of a judicial review.\n\nAnyone who violates the ban can face one year in prison and a $3,200 fine, but questions remain on just how the ban can be effectively enforced.\n\nEver since the 2003 outbreak of the deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), the surgical mask has become a daily necessity among many of the cleanliness-minded locals who wear it habitually.\n\nEnforcement aside, some feared that the ban signalled that the worst is yet to come.\n\n\"The biggest challenge is to one of Hong Kong's core values, the rule of law,\" said Willy Lam, long-time commentator on Chinese politics and senior fellow at Jamestown Foundation in Washington, told Al Jazeera.\n\n\"The protesters are becoming more defiant every week, and the police have now been now given new powers to arrest more people,\" Lam said. \"This will make the confrontation bloodier, and worse.\"", "description": "Thousands of demonstrators take to the streets as High Court hears challenge to ban on donning masks during protests.", "authors": ["Violet Law"], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/4/42671861b55c42ed89fcfd2ca9eeee8f_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
