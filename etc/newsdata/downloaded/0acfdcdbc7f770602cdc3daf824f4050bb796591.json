Somnox gathers information using multiple high-sensitivity sensors. This data can be used to determine whether you are awake or in a deep sleep. The device's artificial intelligence algorithm can then interpret that data to create a tailor-made 'treatment'. It registers your rate of breaths and adjusts its own rhythm accordingly, ensuring a consistent breathing pattern. The pillow simulates a steady rhythm which the user is able to feel and adapt to, ensuring a deep and restful night's sleep. It can also play soothing meditation music or natural sounds to create a relaxed atmosphere and the white noise which can help people to sleep.\n\nSomnox's creators say it was designed to be 'cradled' both while users are in bed and as they relax.\n\nThey claim the device eases its users into better, longer nights of rest.\n\nThe four students behind the project are industrial designer Julian Jagtenberg, software engineer Job Engel, mechanical engineer Stijn Antonisse, and electrical and software engineer Wouter Kooyman van Guldener.\n\nSpeaking about their product, the group said: 'Sleep experts, called somnologists, have helped to develop Somnox.\n\n'Multiple studies have shown that breathing is one of the most important factors of a good night of sleep.\n\n'A slow breathing rhythm can induce a person to sleep in minutes; your heart rate decreases and you'll become relaxed in minimal time.'\n\nA reviewer from the Guardian said spooning the device was 'like being in bed with a baby Darth Vader'.\n\nBut they found that the device was more useful during the day as the 'purring' from the robot's breathing kept them awake at night.\n\nThey added: 'Is it nice? It\u2019s more \u2026 odd, this breathing baby-weight. More useful in the daytime, when noise issues aren\u2019t so big an issue.\n\n'I don\u2019t have a cat, so used this as a substitute, sitting it on my lap with a bowl of minestrone while I watched Friends.'\n\nThe device, the size of a pillow, has already revolutionised several insomnia sufferers' lives\n\nThe peanut-shaped pillow measures your sleep and simulates breathing, based on your sleep pattern, to ensure a deep and restful night's sleep. An app can be used to personalise preferences for the pillow\n\nThe sleep robot could offer a ray of hope to those who struggle to get to sleep \u2013 studies have suggested that a third of people don't get enough shuteye\n\nThe thinking behind the gadget is based on the way people's breathing has a wider effect on their body and how they fall asleep.\n\nIn deep sleep, people's breathing rate slows down and becomes more regular naturally, and making this happen while still awake can make it easier to fall asleep.\n\nThe extra oxygen breathed in during deep breaths helps to slow the heart rate and relax the muscles, encouraging a state of calm.\n\nDuring times of stress, the nervous system becomes over-stimulated leading to a chemical imbalance that can cause a lack of sleep.\n\nBut breathing deeply can reduce this stress and may help people to nod off.\n\nSomnox says it takes about seven days of using the robot every night to start seeing the benefits, and it can also be hooked up to an iPhone or Android app.\n\nThe robot works by moving in a way that tries to calm down the body's breathing, which slows the heart rate and relaxes the muscles (Pictured: A woman holding a prototype in 2017)", "description": "The sleeping buddy is able to slow down users' breathing by simulating breathing rhythms a human body naturally adapts to.
