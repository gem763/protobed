It really is a priority.\"\n\nAnother thing that many people are unaware of is that sleep in vital for our brain to process information we've gathered throughout the day.\n\n\"In terms of physically, sleep allows the body to repair.\n\n\"We need sleep in order to consider memories and process information.\n\n\"If you've not had time to do these things a lot of our memories and information we learned the previous day does not get processed.\"\n\nMore worrying, a lack of sleep can also lead to an increased change of heart disease, stroke and diabetes.\n\nBut it's not just our physical health that is impacted by how much sleep we get.\n\nAs part of Every Mind Matters, a new platform which aims to help people get support with their mental health which is supported by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Sussex, Public Health England is trying to highlight how important sleep is.\n\nSara explains: \"Your focus and motivation at work the following day will probably be waring. The next day you're going to feel cranky and you not able to tolerate things.\n\n\"But if this is across a long term basis you're probably going to have low mood and anxiety.\"\n\nOne of the affects of these things is difficulty sleeping.\n\n\"It become this horrible, vicious cycle that you really can't get out of.\"\n\nSara suggests going to your GP if you feel you are in this cycle, who may recommend you for CBT therapy.\n\nOne of the most common techniques involves writing down all the things that are worrying you before you go to bed. You then park them, telling yourself that you will think about them again in the morning.\n\nSara says: \"You can put those intrusive things aside and hopefully get a better night sleep.\"\n\nTips for dropping off if you have trouble sleeping\n\nProfessor Colin Espie, Professor of Sleep Medicine at the University of Oxford, has shared his top tips for getting to sleep easier.", "description": "Most of us are guilty of not getting the recommended seven to eight hours every night, but Dr\u00a0Sara\u00a0Kayat", "authors": ["Zoe Forsey", "Image", "Getty", "Getty Images Istockphoto"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20579033.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-475832026.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
