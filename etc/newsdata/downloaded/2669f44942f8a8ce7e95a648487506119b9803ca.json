Republicans are nursing razor-thin majorities with all 100 seats in the House of Delegates and all 40 in the state Senate on the ballot Nov. 5.\n\nRepublicans, who saw their 2-to-1 majority in the House nearly wiped out in an blue wave in 2017, have a 51-to-48 margin in the House and a 20-to-19 edge in the Senate, with one vacancy in each chamber. The contests are drawing national money and attention as a potential bellwether for 2020.\n\n\u201cVirginia is at a turning point, and in 29 days, millions of voters will head to the polls in an election that will have a lasting impact on future generations and set the momentum for upcoming state legislative races across the country,\u201d Schriock said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEMILY\u2019s List, which has endorsed 39 women running this year in Virginia, has worked directly with some individual campaigns to provide advice on such things as fundraising and communications.\n\nSeveral of the endorsed candidates will receive direct, six-figure donations out of the $1.5 million, while $150,000 of it will go to the Democrats\u2019 coordinated campaign, an Emily\u2019s spokeswoman said.\n\nGOP legislative leaders have tried to play down abortion politics since 2012, when they backed a bill that would have forced most women seeking an abortion to first undergo a vaginal ultrasound. Facing a backlash over the invasive nature of the test, they found themselves ridiculed on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and accused of waging a \u201cwar on women.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nRepublicans thought abortion politics might favor them this year, after an uproar over a Democratic bill to loosen restrictions on late-term abortion. Under questioning from a Republican during a hearing on the bill in January, Del. Kathy Tran (D-Fairfax) said the measure would allow an abortion up to the moment of delivery. Tran later said she misspoke.\n\nAD\n\nWhen asked about the bill on a radio show, Gov. Ralph Northam (D), a pediatric neurologist, made comments that Republicans interpreted as an endorsement of infanticide. Northam, a pediatric neurologist who has volunteered as medical director for a pediatric hospice, appeared to be discussing life-support or other options for a newborn that is \u201cnot viable.\u201d He refused to clarify his comments but called the suggestion that he would support killing infants \u201cdisgusting.\u201d\n\nRepublicans hoped those controversies would allow them to paint Democrats as extremists on abortion. But they became wary of raising the issue with swing voters after several red states, including Alabama, moved to sharply limit abortion rights.\n\nPoll finds Virginia voters focused on gun policy ahead of pivotal election\n\nVirginia\u2019s \u2018off-off-year\u2019 elections were once sleepy.
