She had obviously been drinking... she has no memory of the maintenance room.'\n\nPolice have released images of the filthy maintenance room where the rape took place\n\nThe court heard the woman was too drunk to consent and was badly injured in the incident\n\nOpening the case earlier this month, prosecutor Allison Hunter QC told Isleworth Crown Court that the nightclub's CCTV showed the two students and the victim meeting on the dancefloor.\n\nShe added: 'They can be seen to pass her from one to the other, each of them taking it in turns to kiss her.'\n\nOrlando then led the woman to the maintenance room as she held on to his waist, with Costanzo behind, steering her as she leant into him\n\n'I was in the middle of them so it was hard to get away from them,' the woman told the jury. 'They were the support for me walking.'\n\nAll three emerged 16 minutes later, with the woman sandwiched between the defendants.\n\nOrlando and Lorenzo Costanzo are both postgraduate students from wealthy Italian families\n\nThe prosecutor said: 'Orlando can be seen to re-arrange her dress, which was twisted and raised at the front, to cover her modesty.\n\n'The pair propel her towards the ladies' toilet, where they open the door and put her inside and turn and run down the corridor.\n\n'They ran straight up the stairs to the outside, where they can be seen hugging, high-fiving each other, strong arming, laughing and looking at what appear to be images or videos on a mobile phone.\n\n'They engage in gestures simulating sexual intercourse and oral intercourse and appear to laugh and congratulate each other.\n\n'It is the prosecution case that she was not able to consent to what she sustained at the will of these two defendants.\n\n'Her capacity to consent was a matter of supreme indifference and irrelevance to them in their pursuit of their own sexual gratification.'\n\nThe sex attack happened at the Toy Room club near Oxford Street, the court heard\n\nThe complainant told the jury she has no memory of the incident, having begun drinking unlimited prosecco at 11am, plus free shots and vodka at the club, where she was celebrating a female friend's birthday.\n\n'I remember being very drunk and falling over a lot and then I was in the toilets of the club in so much pain, not wanting to get out and then I remember being on the street, sitting on the sidewalk,' she said.\n\nShe told police on a one to ten scale of drunkenness she was a 'ten', adding: 'I do have a history of kissing randomers when I'm drunk.'\n\nWhen cross-examined she admitted the CCTV showed her grinding her rear into Costanzo on the dance floor and flicking her long hair.", "description": "Just six minutes after the woman met Ferdinando Orlando and Lorenzo Costanzo at the Toy Room Club under the London Palladium, they were having sex in the side room near the toilets.", "authors": ["Richard Spillett", "Crime Correspondent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/15/19745122-0-image-a-87_1571149443939.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
