It is also says the UK has \u201can obligation\u201d to nominate a candidate to join the European commission. The prime minister has previously said he will not put forward a nominee.\n\nThe European council president, Donald Tusk, has been in intensive discussions with EU leaders over the weekend. Ambassadors for the EU27 are meeting on Monday morning.\n\nTusk had said he wanted to avoid calling leaders to a summit in Brussels to discuss the issue and would seek to find unanimous agreement to allow sign-off via a \u201cwritten procedure\u201d.\n\nThe Guardian view on general election calls: stay and finish the Brexit job | Editorial Read more\n\nThe circulation of the draft agreement suggests Tusk has been successful in convincing France, in particular, that a three-month extension avoids the EU being dragged into the domestic row in the UK.\n\nThe terms in the draft agreement are in line with those stipulated under the Benn act that forced Boris Johnson to make a request to the EU for a further delay.\n\nThe extension had been due to be signed off on Friday. But the French ambassador had stood alone at a meeting of EU diplomats in arguing it was not the right time.\n\nIt was suggested by France\u2019s ambassador that only after the vote on Monday should the EU decide to \u201cgo short, to push for ratification, or long to accommodate a general election\u201d. Only France insisted the EU wait on agreeing to an extension.\n\nSince then, Johnson told the cabinet the French president, Emmanuel Macron, had informed him he was too isolated to insist on a shorter extension.\n\nDevelopments over the weekend, in which the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National party agreed to table a one-line bill in which they would back a general election on 9 December, have convinced many EU officials the UK will soon go to the polls.\n\nDowning Street has let it be known that if Labour does not support its plan for an short extra period of scrutiny of the withdrawal agreement bill up to 6 November, and then a general election on 12 December, it will look at the joint proposal.", "description": "UK will have option to leave earlier if deal is ratified, leaked draft shows", "authors": ["Daniel Boffey"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6e89b84558bc18bd73b1b916a226dddfb733bf6/0_190_4392_2636/master/4392.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4b8892b960e6033445b47659f00ff143", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
