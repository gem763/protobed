Google also said it would appoint employees to moderate the company\u2019s famously raucous internal message boards, rather than allowing volunteers to do so\u2014in effect acknowledging that the discussions have spiraled out of control.\n\nShare Your Thoughts Have you had, or seen, distracting political conversations at your job? How have you or other people handled it? Share your experience below.\n\n\u201cThis follows a year of increased incivility on our internal platforms, and we\u2019ve heard that employees want clearer rules of the road on what\u2019s OK to say and what\u2019s not,\u201d a Google spokeswoman said.\n\nThe new policy represents a significant about-face for Google. The tech titan helped pioneer the Silicon Valley idea of the workplace as a college-like campus where employees can express themselves freely on topics that are important to them.\n\nThe company\u2019s internal message boards host thousands of discussion groups, on topics ranging from social issues to sports, and employees can spend hours a day sparring in them. In recent years, though, the level of debate at times has driven a wedge between staffers with opposing views as well as between management and an increasingly activist workforce.\n\nThousands of Google employees walked out last year to protest payouts to executives accused of sexual harassment, and some have objected to the company\u2019s pursuit of government contracts.\n\nChief Legal Officer Kent Walker has threatened to fire workers poking around inside the company for information on contentious topics like Google\u2019s cloud-computing relationship with the U.S. Defense Department, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month.\n\nIn its memo on Friday, the company reiterated that confidential information discussed internally should be kept private.\n\nTwo former Google employees, with opposing political views, said the changes overall will be jarring. One of those, a software engineer, said many employees were drawn to the company in part by its policies, including commitments to \u201cdo no evil\u201d and \u201cbring your whole self to work.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was the price of admission. They\u2019re changing the deal,\u201d said the former employee. \u201cIt\u2019s a radical departure on culture overnight.\u201d\n\nThe new guidelines don\u2019t forbid discussing politics at work but require managers to address conversations that become disruptive.\n\n\u201cWhile sharing information and ideas with colleagues helps build community, disrupting the workday to have a raging debate over politics or the latest news story does not,\u201d the guidelines say. \u201cOur primary responsibility is to do the work we\u2019ve each been hired to do, not to spend working time on debates about non-work topics.\u201d\n\nGoogle said it will launch a tool later this year for employees to flag content within internal discussions that doesn\u2019t align with the new guidelines. Those reports would then be reviewed privately by members of the new moderation team.\n\nThe updated guidelines are Google\u2019s latest attempt to dial back the company\u2019s freewheeling discourse. Last year it warned employees that it would discipline anyone who discriminates or attacks colleagues or engages in discussions that are \u201cdisruptive to a productive work environment.\u201d In those guidelines, Google also advised employees to avoid name-calling, including making blanket statements about groups or categories of people.\n\nGoogle, which is based in Mountain View, Calif., and has more than 100,000 employees at offices around the world, has been buffeted by a series of controversies related to politics and social issues.\n\nIn 2017, it fired an employee who wrote an internal memo suggesting men are better suited than women for tech jobs. Last year, former female employees sued Google for allegedly discriminating against women, while former male employees sued it for allegedly discriminating against conservative white men.\n\nFormer Google engineer Kevin Cernekee told the Journal earlier this month that he believes he was fired in large part because he expressed conservative views on the company\u2019s internal message boards.\n\nGoogle told Mr. Cernekee in a termination letter that he was let go for multiple violations of company policies, including improperly downloading company information and misuse of the remote-access software system. A spokeswoman said the company enforces its policies without regard to political viewpoints.\n\nThe turmoil has drawn the attention of political figures\u2014including President Trump\u2014who have accused Google of bias against conservatives. Mr. Trump last year complained on Twitter that Google search results for the words \u201cTrump news\u201d primarily displayed what he labeled \u201cLeft-Wing Media.\u201d\n\nGoogle\u2019s latest changes, while seemingly made with good intentions, could inhibit dialogue among company employees, said David C. Logan, a senior lecturer on workplace management at the University of Southern California.\n\n\u201cCultures of political correctness ironically can become unsafe places to work,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople need to be able to discuss what\u2019s going on in the world. Communities are where you do that and the community where people spend most of their waking time is at the office.\u201d\n\nOther tech companies have also struggled to keep internal employee discourse from getting out of hand. Facebook in 2016 dismantled a popular anonymous discussion board for employees that had become a forum for conservative political debate that sometimes degenerated into racist or sexist comments.\n\nThe changes come at a time when employee activism is increasingly an issue in the tech industry.\n\nMicrosoft Corp. and Salesforce.com Inc. last year had to contend with employee unrest over their ties to the government. Microsoft employees demanded the company sever its work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement while Salesforce employees asked Chief Executive Marc Benioff to re-evaluate the company\u2019s work with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency.\n\nWrite to Sarah E.
