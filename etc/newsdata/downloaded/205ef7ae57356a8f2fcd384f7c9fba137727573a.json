However, this week\u2019s column presented Boot with a unique challenge: how to spin the news of the jihadi mastermind\u2019s death into a jab at the president?\n\nAlso on rt.com Better ISIS than Trump? WaPo, Hollywood, Nats fans show self-defeating toxicity of US politics\n\nHe found a way. Taking issue with President Trump\u2019s description of Baghdadi as a \u201ccoward,\u201d Boot shot back that the so-called Caliph\u2019s death by explosive suicide \u2013 killing three of his own children in the process \u2013 itself proved his bravery. Apparently confident in that take, Boot even pulled the line from his column to post as a standalone tweet, but it soon provoked a torrent of ridicule from commenters online.\n\nHi @CNNPR! What\u2019s the deal with paid CNN contributor Max Boot standing up for Baghdadi? @oliverdarcy@jaketapperpic.twitter.com/5tLGDBUTid \u2014 Mike Cernovich (@Cernovich) October 28, 2019\n\n\u201cMax Boot defended the courage of ISIS terror boss Baghdadi in order to spite President Trump,\u201d one commenter said. \u201cWhat a tragic, pathetic little man.\u201d\n\n\n\nMax Boot - champion of open-ended Middle East military intervention going back decades - penning a Baghdadi cowardice counterfactual because Trump is in the White House & ordered the successful mission to eliminate him has to be the Max Bootiest thing ever. \u2014 Boris Ryvkin (@BRyvkin) October 28, 2019\n\nAnother user recalled Boot\u2019s vocal support for the 2003 invasion of Iraq \u2013 not to mention every US invasion since \u2013 which blew open the floodgates of violence and extremism in the region, leading to the rise of the Islamic State and other violent jihadist groups.\n\nMax Boot is getting dragged right now for suggesting Baghdadi is not a coward because he blew himself up. Seems worth noting that Boot was an early, staunch advocate of the 2003 Iraq War, which helped create ISIS, the terror group Baghdadi led. https://t.co/Oj1YMPTlid \u2014 John Haltiwanger (@jchaltiwanger) October 28, 2019\n\nReacting to the backlash, Boot later decided to delete his ill-fated tweet and scrub the Baghdadi line from his column altogether, offering an explanatory tweet in their place suggesting his words were misinterpreted.\n\nAn earlier version included a sentence questioning whether Trump was right to call Baghdadi a coward. That was removed b/c it wrongly conveyed the impression that I considered Baghdadi courageous. As I wrote Sun: Baghdadi was \"a sick and depraved man.\" https://t.co/R77v7ef0GR \u2014 Max Boot (@MaxBoot) October 28, 2019\n\nUnfortunately for the hawkish columnist, his sudden reversal did little to quell the outpouring of criticism, even if it did save his tweet from being \u201cratioed\u201d any further with dozens of harsh replies.\n\nThe assertion that Max Boot called Baghdadi heroic is contradicted by the fact that rather than being ratioed he deleted his tweet. \u2014 Austere StickFigureText (@doug_in_tx) October 28, 2019\n\nWhoa... sick backpedal bro!\n\n\n\nGood thing I took a screenshot of how much of a clown Max Boot is. I had a feeling he'd delete it.https://t.co/kWQaR04l3Mpic.twitter.com/0UDRlJeOoD \u2014 \ud83d\udc7bMike Halloween-Name-Unknown (@TheOtherMike_) October 28, 2019\n\nLike this story?
