(NYSE:HBI) For Its 3.9% Dividend Yield?", "language": "en", "text": "Could Hanesbrands Inc. (NYSE:HBI) be an attractive dividend share to own for the long haul? Investors are often drawn to strong companies with the idea of reinvesting the dividends. Yet sometimes, investors buy a popular dividend stock because of its yield, and then lose money if the company's dividend doesn't live up to expectations.\n\nIn this case, Hanesbrands likely looks attractive to dividend investors, given its 3.9% dividend yield and seven-year payment history. It sure looks interesting on these metrics - but there's always more to the story . There are a few simple ways to reduce the risks of buying Hanesbrands for its dividend, and we'll go through these below.\n\nClick the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis\n\nNYSE:HBI Historical Dividend Yield, October 16th 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nDividends are usually paid out of company earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Comparing dividend payments to a company's net profit after tax is a simple way of reality-checking whether a dividend is sustainable. Looking at the data, we can see that 39% of Hanesbrands's profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. This is a middling range that strikes a nice balance between paying dividends to shareholders, and retaining enough earnings to invest in future growth. Plus, there is room to increase the payout ratio over time.\n\nIn addition to comparing dividends against profits, we should inspect whether the company generated enough cash to pay its dividend. Hanesbrands paid out a conservative 40% of its free cash flow as dividends last year. It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.\n\nIs Hanesbrands's Balance Sheet Risky?\n\nAs Hanesbrands has a meaningful amount of debt, we need to check its balance sheet to see if the company might have debt risks. A quick check of its financial situation can be done with two ratios: net debt divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and net interest cover. Net debt to EBITDA measures total debt load relative to company earnings (lower = less debt), while net interest cover measures the ability to pay interest on the debt (higher = greater ability to pay interest costs). Hanesbrands is carrying net debt of 3.43 times its EBITDA, which is getting towards the upper limit of our comfort range on a dividend stock that the investor hopes will endure a wide range of economic circumstances.\n\nWe calculated its interest cover by measuring its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), and dividing this by the company's net interest expense. With EBIT of 4.95 times its interest expense, Hanesbrands's interest cover is starting to look a bit thin.\n\nRemember, you can always get a snapshot of Hanesbrands's latest financial position, by checking our visualisation of its financial health.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nOne of the major risks of relying on dividend income, is the potential for a company to struggle financially and cut its dividend. Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well - nasty. Hanesbrands has been paying a dividend for the past seven years. Its dividend has not fluctuated much that time, which we like, but we're conscious that the company might not yet have a track record of maintaining dividends in all economic conditions. During the past seven-year period, the first annual payment was US$0.20 in 2012, compared to US$0.60 last year. Dividends per share have grown at approximately 17% per year over this time.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Could Hanesbrands Inc.
