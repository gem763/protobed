A year ago he was contacted by a Greek academic who claimed the landscapes of the stories in the Odyssey did stretch beyond the Mediterranean. Galway\u2019s coast and the Aran islands fitted in with the tale about Odysseus and the Cyclops, he had insisted.\n\n\u201cAll this can be challenged, as can everything in Homer, so we are just using this as a springboard,\u201d said Doran. \u201cBut it is totally fascinating and not wholly a surprise. We\u2019ve all heard about Basque country and Egyptian music links with Irish music.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Aran islands fit in with the story about Odysseus and the Cyclops, say organisers.

Its current budget is \u20ac39.7m.\n\nMarriage said the year of culture would have three themes of language, landscape and migration, with the aim of reflecting \u201cwhat it means to be a modern European country in these difficult times\u201d.\n\nShe added: \u201cGalway is the most extraordinary place and next year it\u2019s at the heart of Europe. But you have a sense when you are there that it is right on the edge of Europe, looking out on the Atlantic, America next stop. It\u2019s wild, it\u2019s really exciting, I keep thinking it is like Barcelona with rain because it rains 240 days a year.\u201d\n\nThe company behind the most recent Olympic opening and closing ceremonies, Wonder Works, will coordinate Galway\u2019s opening on 8 February. \u201cIt will be howling, it will be wet, the Atlantic will be horizontal but it will be brilliant fun,\u201d said Marriage.\n\nThe year will also see a new interpretation of Gilgamesh; a tour by Druid Theatre of Ireland\u2019s greatest one act plays; and a collaboration with Boston, Nashville and Belfast which will celebrate the transatlantic roots of country, blues, gospel, folk and bluegrass.\n\nGalway will be one of two European capitals of culture next year, sharing the title with Rijeka, in Croatia.", "description": "Irish city welcomes Atwood and celebrates Homer as 2020 European capital of culture", "authors": ["Mark Brown"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22f956f6a93549465e5b7a4afc9e8b47c6576559/0_46_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=22331afe6e45854594f7f832ce0f5b9b", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
