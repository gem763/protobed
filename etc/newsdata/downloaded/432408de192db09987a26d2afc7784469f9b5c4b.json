REUTERS/Umit Bektas\n\nThe Kowloon Tong station was seriously damaged in the attack, the government said in a statement. Riot police deployed in the streets of Kowloon and inside several metro stations after the petrol bomb attack.\n\nHundreds of protesters, many young and wearing face masks, were marching in Kowloon at the time and were headed to a district near the Kowloon Tong station.\n\n\u201cNo crime to cover our faces, no reason to enact (anti-mask) law,\u201d protesters chanted. \u201cI have the right to wear masks!\u201d\n\nThe Hong Kong government introduced colonial-era emergency laws last week to ban the wearing of face masks at public rallies, a move that sparked some of the worst violence since the unrest started in June.\n\nSome protesters erected road barricades using public garbage bins and water-filled plastic barriers used for traffic control and security.\n\nProtesters elsewhere set fire to a government office in Kowloon and vandalised shops and metro stations, the government said.\n\nThere were no skirmishes between protesters and police and by nightfall protesters had dispersed into small groups scattered around Kowloon.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s protests started in opposition to a now-abandoned extradition bill but have mushroomed in four months into a pro-democracy movement and an outlet for anger at social inequality in the city, an Asian financial hub.\n\nThe protests have plunged the city into its worst crisis since Britain handed it back to China in 1997 and is the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.\n\nHong Kong had experienced relative calm since last weekend, when a peaceful march by tens of thousands spiralled into a night of running battles between protesters and police.\n\nSince then there had only been small nightly protests and activists had not flagged any major action this weekend.\n\n\u2018DEFEND THE FUTURE\u2019\n\nA small group calling itself the \u201cSilver-Haired Marchers\u201d began a 48-hour sit-in at police headquarters on Saturday, describing themselves as \u201cold but not obsolete\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe young people have already sacrificed a lot, it is about time for us, the senior citizens in Hong Kong to come forward to take up part of the responsibility from the young people,\u201d 63-year-old Shiu told local media.\n\n\u201cI mean for us, even if we are caught by the police because of an illegal gathering, I don\u2019t mind,\u201d said Shiu, who was identified with only one name.\n\nPolice have arrested more than 2,300 people since June. Since September nearly 40% were under the age of 18 and 10% under 15.\n\nSome protest marchers on Saturday covered their faces with photocopies of the Chinese president\u2019s face, others with \u201cV for Vendetta\u201d Guy Fawkes masks, and a group of protesters plan a \u201cface mask party\u201d on Saturday night.\n\nThe face mask ban carries a maximum one-year jail term, but thousands, including school children and office workers, have defied the ban.\n\nPOLICE CRISIS OF CONFIDENCE\n\nHong Kong\u2019s police are also facing a crisis of confidence amid the worsening political tensions. Protesters accuse them of using excessive force, a charge police deny, and two protesters have been shot and wounded during skirmishes with police.\n\nHong Kong is facing its first recession in a decade due to the protests, with tourism and retail hardest hit.\n\nMany shops have been shutting early to avoid becoming a target of protesters and due to closures of the damaged metro. Some stations on the network were closed on Saturday after being targeted.\n\nProtesters have also targeted China banks and shops with perceived links to China, as well as U.S. coffee chain Starbucks (SBUX.O), which had a store in Kowloon trashed on Saturday.\n\nThe protests have been driven by a concern that China has been eroding Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms, guaranteed under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula introduced with the 1997 handover.\n\nThe now-withdrawn extradition bill, under which residents would have been sent to Communist-controlled mainland courts, was seen as the latest move to tighten control.\n\nSlideshow (24 Images)\n\nChina denies the accusation and says foreign countries, including Britain and the United States, are fomenting unrest.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said in announcing a partial trade deal with China on Friday that he had raised Hong Kong in the talks after previously warning that a deteriorating situation in the city could affect the negotiations.", "description": "Petrol bombs were thrown inside a Hong Kong metro station on Saturday but no one was injured, the government said, as pro-democracy protesters again took to the streets angry at what they believe is Beijing's tightening grip on the city.", "authors": ["Noah Sin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191012&t=2&i=1440010464&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9B0BX", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
