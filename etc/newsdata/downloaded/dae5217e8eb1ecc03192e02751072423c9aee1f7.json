Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, echoed the frustrations of many Republicans over a perceived lack of transparency in the handling of the impeachment inquiry led by House Democrats.\n\nAppearing on \u201cHannity\u201d Thursday, the presidential candidate said she originally supported the inquiry, but she stressed the need for transparency.\n\n\u201cI don't know what's going on in those closed doors,\u201d Gabbard said. \u201cWe as members of Congress do not have access to the information that's being shared. I think the American people deserve to know exactly what the facts are, what the evidence is being presented as this inquiry goes on.\u201d\n\nShe also expressed concerns that a hyper-partisan impeachment inquiry would \u201ctear apart\u201d the country. \u201cI've long expressed my concern about going through impeachment proceedings in a very, very partisan way because it will only further tear apart an already divided country.\u201d\n\nSEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD BE BOTHERED BY WHAT DEMOCRATS ARE DOING TO TRUMP\n\nGabbard also sounded off again about former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who has suggested that Republicans were grooming Gabbard to run a third-party candidacy. After Clinton\u2019s comments, Gabbard called Clinton \u201cthe queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long.\u201d\n\nOn Hannity, Gabbard said that Clinton has sent a warning out to all veterans and anyone who stood up to her \u201cwarmongering policies.\u201d\n\nHILLARY CLINTON IS THE 'WORST LOSER I'VE EVER SEEN,' BRIAN KILMEADE SAYS\n\n\u201cShe is not only calling me a traitor, she is not only trying to smear my character, she's sending a warning out to every veteran, every single American, anyone who stands up the warmongering foreign policies that really are her legacy, that have been so destructive and costly to my brothers and sisters in uniform, because the American people trillions of dollars, and because of so much damage in the war,\u201d Gabbard said of Clinton.\n\nFox News' Sean Hannity then pivoted back to investigations into President Trump. \u201cWhat are your thoughts on Hillary Clinton and the DNC paying for that Russian dossier full of lies?\u201d he asked bluntly.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nGabbard did not address the theory but said that interference into U.S. elections should be a concern for every American, and offered up a solution. \u201cLet's actually protect our democracy by ensuring we have paper ballots were voter-verified paper backups to make sure if anyone comes in and actually try to manipulate the votes we cast in these elections that can be audited, that we have a paper record of the vote.\u201d She called on Congress to pass legislation she proposed which would do just that.\n\nHannity pressed Gabbard for her thoughts on Hunter Biden\u2019s ties to a Ukrainian firm, despite a lack of experience, during his father\u2019s vice presidency. \u201cThose are questions only Hunter Biden can answer,\u201d Gabbard said repeatedly.", "description": "Rep.
