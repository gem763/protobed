It is also not the first time that the Gupta company has tried its luck and we will therefore oppose their actions, as we have always done, and look forward to seeing them in court to put an end to the matter, once and for all,\" said Surv\u00e9.\n\nMatjila's lawyers will be opposing the claim too, Daily Maverick reported.\n\nIndependent was bought by Sekunjalo Independent Media in 2013. The deal was partly funded by a Chinese consortium called Interacom Investment Holdings and partly by the Government Employee Pension Fund through the PIC.\n\nREAD: PIC inquiry wraps public hearings, commission to prepare final report\n\nIt has been revealed in the public hearings of the PIC Commission of Inquiry that the corporation's investment into Independent was regarded as risky.\n\nThe commission was appointed by President Cyril Ramaphosa last year to probe allegations of impropriety related to the PIC's investment deals. It wrapped up its public hearings on Wednesday. Over a period of eight months, the commission, led by Justice Lex Mpati, heard from 77 witnesses, including Matjila and Surv\u00e9.\n\n\n\nThe PIC has since started a process to exit its investment in Independent and has refused to recapitalise the media company which is in a dire financial position, according to Surv\u00e9's testimony before the commission.\n\n*For the original story go to Daily Maverick\n\n", "description": "Sekunjalo will oppose a R1bn lawsuit Gupta-owned Oakbay Investments has lodged against chairperson Iqbal Surv\u00e9 and ex-PIC head Dan Matjila.", "authors": ["Compiled Lameez Omarjee"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7145/4606d7d94bb643e6b6c579b0e417ab24.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-15"}
