Dupas is already serving life behind bars without chance of parole\n\nKathleen Downes was brutally murdered in a Brunswick nursing home. Serial killer Peter Dupas is believed to have killed her because she reminded him of his own mother\n\nFormer solicitor Andrew Fraser leaves the Supreme Court after giving evidence at the trial of Peter Dupas in Melbourne in 2007. He is now too ill to give evidence against Dupas again\n\nPolice had alleged Dupas murdered Kathleen Downes in 1997 because she reminded him of his mother.\n\nThe secret case saw Channel 7 Melbourne's anchorman Peter Mitchell forced to front court and apologise for an on-air blunder when reporting on the upcoming murder trial in March last year.\n\nThe veteran news presenter offered Justice Lex Lasry a 'genuine and sincere apology' on 7's behalf after he 'went off-script' and referred to Dupas as a serial killer.\n\nThe jury was never to know Dupas had already killed Nicole Patterson, Margaret Maher and Mersina Helvagis.\n\nThe case has been slowly drifting through the Supreme Court of Victoria since, but hit a hurdle last week just as it was set to go to trial with news Fraser would not be fit to give evidence.\n\nIn 2015, Fraser told the Coroners Court the triple killer told him while the two were in prison: 'I reckon I\u2019m going to end up wearing the old sheila, Downes, too.'\n\nFraser has been a high-flying legal eagle before winding up in jail with the serial killer.\n\nMrs Downes was killed at the Brunswick Lodge nursing home about 6.30am on December 31, 1997, almost two months after Dupas murdered Ms Halvagis at Fawkner Cemetery.\n\nHer body was found by a staff member on her bedroom floor in a pool of blood after she had been repeatedly stabbed and her throat cut.\n\nSergeant David Dimsey told the court Dupas was the prime suspect due to his lengthy history of violence against women, especially with knives, and 'peeping Tom behaviour'.\n\nDupas had stabbed his next door neighbor without warning as a teenager in 1968, while wearing his school uniform.\n\nMersina Helvagis was stabbed to death as she tendered to her grandmother's grave. Former lawyer Andrew Fraser helped pin the crime on Dupas. But he is now too sick to help out again\n\nDupas stabbed to death young female psychotherapist Nicole Patterson and mutilated her body\n\nIn 1972 he was caught peeking through the windows of a woman as a 19-year old.\n\nHe was charged with rape later that year.\n\nHis victim was a married woman he asked for help after claiming his car had broken down outside her Mitcham home.\n\nHe hid in the house while she was looking for a screwdriver, then threatened her and her 18-month-old baby with a knife before raping her.\n\nDupas was just 21 when he was sentenced to nine years' jail with a non-parole period of five years.\n\nHe was released from jail on September 4, 1979 and immediately attacked four women in 10 days.\n\nDupas would rape and stab multiple women, later telling police he had 'the urge'.\n\n'It just comes over me ... I can't help myself,' he told detectives.\n\nDupas was sentenced to just 6 1/2 years with a five-year minimum.\n\nFour days after his release he raped another woman.\n\nThis time he copped 12 years' jail, with a minimum of 10 years before parole.\n\nWhile inside, he married a nurse and claimed to be reformed.\n\nBut he was back at it again shortly after and sentenced yet again to more jail time after being caught with a rape kit after another attack.\n\nHe was released in 1996 and by October 1997 had murdered sex worker Margaret Maher.\n\nShe had been strangled, and her left breast cut off and placed in her mouth.\n\nLess than a month later, he murdered Mersina Halvagis as she was tidying her grandmother's grave at Fawkner Cemetery.\n\nDupas stabbed her more than 30 times.\n\nLess than two months after the murder of Ms Halvagis, Mrs Downes was stabbed to death in Brunswick.\n\nMargaret Maher had been strangled, and her left breast cut off and placed in her mouth. Peter Dupas was later convicted of her horrific murder\n\nIn 1999, he stabbed to death young female psychotherapist Nicole Patterson and mutilated her body.\n\nThe jury in his murder trial took less than three hours to convict him on that one.\n\nDupas is also suspected of the 1985 murder of mother of four Helen McMahon.\n\nMs McMahon was beaten to death while sunbaking at Rye back beach.\n\nDupas had been free on temporary leave from prison that day.\n\nAt the inquest into Mrs Downes murder, the court heard there were consistencies between the murder of one Ms Patterson, including the choice of murder weapon, the lack of sexual penetration and that the killer wore gloves and removed and searched a drawer.\n\nPolice alleged Dupas had made phone contact with Ms Patterson under a false name before her murder and had twice called Ms Downes\u2019 nursing home about a month before her death.\n\nProsecutors believed Dupas was motivated to kill Ms Downes because she resembled his overbearing mother, whom he resented and had just spent time visiting.\n\nDupas was interviewed over the murder in 2001, but refused to comment, and again in 2013.\n\nThe court heard Fraser had became close to Dupas in the early 2000s at Port Phillip Prison protection unit after being jailed for drug offences.\n\nFraser said the serial rapist, who was concerned about being convicted for the murders of Margaret Maher and Ms Halvagis, twice said he left no forensic evidence at Fawkner Cemetery, 'nor with the old sheila down the road', and once referred to Ms Downes by her surname.\n\nFraser had two months taken off his five-year minimum sentence after giving evidence about Dupas\u2019 murder of Ms Halvagis.\n\nDupas\u2019 barrister John Desmond claimed Fraser had lied about Dupas\u2019 alleged jailhouse confessions to have his sentenced reduced and to claim the rewards on offer for information into the murders.\n\nMs Downes was described as 'a dear old lady with a wonderful nature' and the matriarch of the nursing home.\n\nWhile Dupas will remain behind bars until he dies, Mrs Downes' family will see no justice for their loved one.", "description": "Serial killer Peter Dupas is to get away with another murder after a key witness in the slaying of a 95-year old woman in a nursing home was unable to give evidence.", "authors": ["Wayne Flower In Melbourne For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/04/19379580-0-image-a-2_1570420476861.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
