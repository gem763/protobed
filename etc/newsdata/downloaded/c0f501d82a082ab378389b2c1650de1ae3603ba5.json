It also has been fighting to stop GM from closing auto assembly plants in Michigan and Ohio.\n\nGM has countered that the plant closures are in response to shifts in the global car market and that it plans to open facilities in different locations. It also has argued that its wages and benefits are among the best in the industry and that it offered the UAW more than $7 billion in pay increases.\n\n\u201cWe have negotiated in good faith and with a sense of urgency,\u201d GM said in a statement just before the strike.\n\nThe streets around GM\u2019s pickup truck assembly plant in Flint, Michigan, were alive with picketing.\n\n\u201cEverybody is working together. People are riding by honking their support. They are picketing the plant. They are down at the Union Hall organizing. They\u2019re doing everything,\u201d Stephanie Bond, manager of the Fisher Hall Bingo parlor near the plant, told The Washington Times.\n\nThe blue-collar city was once a hub of industrial activity. Flint now has just one major factory: the GM pickup truck plant. Down the street, The Wooden Keg Tavern was staying open 24 hours a day to provide food and bathrooms for pickets.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re slammed. We\u2019re busier than we\u2019ve ever been,\u201d the tavern manager said.\n\nThe UAW this weekend temporarily extended contracts with Ford and Fiat Chrysler, but those companies could be brought into the strike if talks with GM do not improve. The UAW has targeted GM, analysts say, because it is the most profitable of the leading U.S. automakers.\n\nThe strike also comes amid a widening corruption investigation of UAW leadership that has added pressure on negotiators for both sides.\n\nVance Pearson, head of a UAW regional office based near St. Louis, was charged last week with corruption in an alleged scheme to embezzle union money and spend cash on premium booze, golf clubs, cigars and swanky stays in California.\n\nIt was the same region that UAW President Gary Jones led before taking the union\u2019s top office last year. Mr. Jones has not been charged.\n\n\u2981 This article is based in part on wire service reports.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
