What happened to him remains unknown.\n\nA symbol of peaceful resistance\n\nCole knew he would be searched later by Chinese security so hid the undeveloped film roll in the bathroom.\n\nShortly after he took it, officials broke through the door and searched the hotel room, but they did not discover the film.\n\nThe scene as shot by him and the other three photographers went on to become an iconic symbol of peaceful resistance across the world.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Tiananmen's tank man: The image that China forgot\n\nThirty years ago, Beijing's Tiananmen Square became the focus for large-scale protests, calling for reform and democracy.\n\nDemonstrators had been camped for weeks in the square, but late on 3 June, the military moved in and troops opened fire.\n\nChina has only ever said that 200 civilians and security personnel died, but there has been no publicly released record of deaths.
