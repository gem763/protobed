That withdrawal is proceeding even as Esper announced the plan to put reinforcements in the oil-producing area.\n\nSpeaking to reporters Friday at the White House, Trump said the U.S.-brokered agreement with Turkey to halt its offensive against U.S.-supporting Syrian Kurdish fighters was a win for his administration. That offensive began after Trump announced U.S. troops would not stand in the way, though he also said the U.S. would punish Turkey's economy if the country acted inhumanely.\n\nSecretary of Defense Mark Esper acknowledged in Brussels that the U.S. will be sending forces back into Syria\n\nHe also said anew on Friday that 'we're getting our troops out' of Syria, without mentioning Esper's announcement.\n\n'We are doing well in Syria, with Turkey and everybody else that we're dealing with,' Trump said. 'We have secured the oil. ... We have a couple of people that came knocking, we said don't knock. And I think I would say that things are going very well.'\n\nWhite House officials would not clarify whom he was referring to as 'knocking.'\n\nThe U.S. special envoy for Syria, James Jeffrey, said in Geneva on Friday he had talked to a Russian official about an unspecified issue in Syria's oil region.\n\n'We are currently very concerned about certain developments in the south, in the Deir el-Zour area,' Jeffrey said. 'I've talked to my Russian colleague about that and we're having other contacts with the Russians concerning that situation. We think it is under control now.'\n\nAlthough Esper did not mention the size of the U.S. reinforcements, it could total several hundred troops because fuel-guzzling tanks and other armored vehicles depend on a large supply and logistical support group. One official, who discussed the planning on condition of anonymity because some details remained to be agreed, cautioned that tanks might eventually be eliminated from the mix because of logistical challenges, including air transport.\n\nRussian and Turkish leaders have now divided up security roles in northeast Syria following Trump's abrupt troop withdrawal from the Turkey-Syrian border region. The American move triggered widespread criticism that the U.S. administration had abandoned the Syrian Kurdish fighters who fought alongside the U.S. against IS for several years.\n\nEsper's announcement came even as Trump again indicated in tweets that the U.S. military mission in Syria is complete. He previously has acknowledged a willingness to help protect the oil fields in eastern Syria, suggesting they could benefit the Kurds as well as the United States, although those resources belong to the Syrian government.\n\n'Oil is secured,' Trump tweeted Friday. 'Our soldiers have left and are leaving Syria for other places, then.... COMING HOME! ... When these pundit fools who have called the Middle East wrong for 20 years ask what we are getting out of the deal, I simply say, THE OIL, AND WE ARE BRINGING OUR SOLDIERS BACK HOME, ISIS SECURED!'\n\nAsked about America's shifting Syria strategy, Esper said the U.S. mission has always been to prevent the resurgence of IS. 'That mission remains unchanged,' he said.\n\nBut Esper said at NATO that the U.S. is 'considering how we might reposition forces in the area in order to ensure we secure the oil field.' He added: 'We are reinforcing that position. It will include some mechanized forces.'\n\nHe made clear the main purpose is to prevent IS from regaining access to Syrian oil, which prior to 2017 was a major source of its revenue.\n\nA member of Asayish, or the Internal Security Forces, makes a selfie by an Russian military vehicle during a patrol near Syrian and Turkish border in north Syria, on Friday\n\nStarting in late 2015 and continuing for many months, the U.S. conducted airstrikes against a range of oil resources in the Deir el-Zour province that had been taken over by IS. The attacks damaged or knocked out oil tanker convoys, oil processing plants, storage facilities, pumping stations, pipelines and refineries. It was called Operation Tidal Wave II, after a World War II air campaign to hit Romania's oil industry.\n\nEsper said IS must not be allowed to again threaten the oil.\n\n'If ISIS has access to the resources, and therefore the means to procure arms or to buy fighters or whatever else they do, then it means it makes it more difficult to defeat ISIS,' he said.\n\nJust last week, Trump insisted that all American forces in Syria would come home. Then he said the 1,000 in the north would return home and that American troops in the south, numbering about 200 at the Al-Tanf garrison in the south, would stay.\n\nTrump in the past days has turned a greater focus on the Syrian oil facilities in the eastern part of the country, saying U.S. will stay in Syria to protect them.\n\nAccording to officials, top military leaders have pushed for the U.S. to leave forces in Syria to guard against an IS resurgence. While the group's physical zone of control was largely destroyed by U.S. and Syrian Kurdish forces, insurgents remain in small pockets throughout the country and in Iraq.", "description": "The convoy some dozen armored vehicles displaying the American flag was spotted on Saturday near the town of Qamishli, in an oil-rich region on Syria's northern border with Turkey.", "authors": ["Keith Griffith For Dailymail.Com", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/20/20223958-0-image-a-33_1572118829319.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
