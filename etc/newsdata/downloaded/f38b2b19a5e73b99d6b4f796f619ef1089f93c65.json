This partnership is an opportunity to strengthen the fabric of communities across America.\"\n\nThe partnership comes as the league continues to navigate its involvement in various causes for social activism, taken on by players since former quarterback Colin Kaepernick in 2016 protested social injustice by kneeling during the national anthem before games.\n\nKaepernick has been out of the NFL since the end of the 2016 season, and recently settled a grievance he filed against the NFL, alleging that the league\u2019s ownership denied him employment because of his outspoken and public calls for social reform. Kaepernick\u2019s former teammate, current Carolina Panthers safety Eric Reid, also settled his own grievance that alleged the same claim.\n\nAccording to ESPN, the partnership will call on Roc Nation to take the lead on the creation of and distribution of music content for the NFL\u2019s marketing purposes, including the production and promotion of live concerts at events. ESPN reported that the partnership does not call for Jay-Z to perform at the Super Bowl halftime show.\n\n\"Roc Nation is one of the most globally influential and impactful organizations in entertainment,\" NFL commissioner Roger Goodell told ESPN. \"The NFL and Roc Nation share a vision of inspiring meaningful social change across our country.\"", "description": "The NFL and Roc Nation, the entertainment company founded by rapper and businessman Jay-Z, have partnered to collaborate on social activism and music.", "authors": ["Lorenzo Reyes", "Published P.M.
