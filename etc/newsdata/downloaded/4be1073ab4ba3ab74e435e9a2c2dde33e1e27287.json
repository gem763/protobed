France has yet to name a replacement. Each new candidate will have to undergo a thorough examination of his or her financial interests by the legal affairs committee and a three-hour confirmation hearing, in addition to answering written questions from MEPs.\n\nParliament officials say December 1 is the earliest possible start date, given that the Commission usually begins its work on the first day of the month, following an approval vote in plenary.\n\nJaume Duch, the Parliament's spokesperson, tweeted on Wednesday that MEPs are \"willing to vote on time to allow new Commission to start 1st December\" and are asking \"for rapid appointment of the new 3 commissioners-designate.\"", "description": "The Commission was meant to take office on November 1.", "authors": ["Ma\u00efa De La Baume"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1176191556-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
