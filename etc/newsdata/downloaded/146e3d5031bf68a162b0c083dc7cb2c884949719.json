Chefs and food bloggers find themselves in highly competitive and ever-changing environments.

Don\u2019t let pride stop you from doing what\u2019s right \u2013 honest mistakes are easily fixable and only embarrassing momentarily. All it takes is ownership of the mistake, a sincere apology and rightful acknowledgement to amend the wrong.\n\nWe all draw inspiration from each other, especially when it comes to such a competitive industry, but being a good culinary citizen is doable and rewarding in and of itself.
