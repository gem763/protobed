It was more the pressure that Japan put on us with the amount of effort, tenacity and intensity that they put on us.\n\n\"We actually did really well in terms of intensity, but not as great with our execution.\n\n\"It wasn\u2019t really harsh words, but more trying to calm the guys down and trying to execute better.\n\n\"Siya and the boys did most of the talking and sorted that out.\"\n\nKolisi then revealed what his message at half-time was.\n\n\"The message was just to be patient and trust in our plans. Our mauls and scrums were working, and we didn\u2019t take our opportunities in that first half,\" he said.\n\n\"We didn\u2019t want to change (what we were doing), but we needed to show more patience when we had the ball.\"\n\nThe Boks will now take on Wales in the World Cup semi-finals in Yokohama on Sunday.\n\n- Compiled by Lloyd Burnard", "description": "Springbok coach Rassie Erasmus has praised captain Siya Kolisi and No 8 Duane Vermeulen for their half-time team talks.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7294/8165d58adc464f87928c4ce1cc5c3c73.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
