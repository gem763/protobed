But Sunday\u2019s appointment of Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, an experienced oil official and son of the king, upends that arrangement, allowing his younger half brother, Prince Mohammed, to consolidate his considerable political and economic clout.\n\n\u201cThis appointment is very important for what it signals for the balance of power in the royal family\u2014or the nonbalance of power,\u201d said Robin Mills, an oil expert and chief executive of Dubai-based Qamar Energy. \u201cIt\u2019s part of MBS trying to stamp his control,\u201d he said, using the crown prince\u2019s initials.\n\nPrince Abdulaziz succeeded Khalid al Falih days after the nonroyal also lost his job as chairman of Aramco, known officially as Saudi Arabian Oil Co. The head of the country\u2019s sovereign-wealth fund and a confidante of the crown prince, Yasir al-Rumayyan, was handed that role, meaning oil-policy decisions are now split between two of his political loyalists.\n\nThe shake-up of the kingdom\u2019s energy leadership follows Prince Mohammed taking control of other critical government organs, such as the defense ministry and national guard. Yet since his father, King Salman, ascended to the throne in 2015, Prince Mohammed had resisted putting his stamp of authority on a ministry that helps determine global oil prices.\n\nPrince Mohammed, Saudi Arabia\u2019s day-to-day ruler, is now trying to boost low oil prices that have been hurting growth and slowing the pace of an economic-overhaul program. That program aims to open industries\u2014such as tourism, hospitality and entertainment\u2014to generate jobs and to make the kingdom economy less energy dependent.\n\nAt the center of the crown prince\u2019s plans is the coming initial public offering of Saudi Aramco, the world\u2019s largest energy company. The former energy minister, Mr. Falih, had publicly supported a stock offering, but also worked to delay and reduce in scope, Aramco executives, advisers and Saudi officials said.\n\nBecause of his close sibling ties to Prince Mohammed\u2014and the de facto leader\u2019s broader consolidation of power across Saudi bureaucracy\u2014Prince Abdulaziz isn\u2019t expected to have much leverage to dispute his younger brother\u2019s views, some analysts and Saudi officials said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see him rocking boats or challenging certain policies,\u201d a senior Saudi official said.\n\nPrince Abdulaziz\u2019s first public test will come this week at a meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies in the United Arab Emirates, where the Saudi-led cartel is expected to discuss production cuts that have struggled to boost oil prices. Subdued levels are punishing Saudi Arabia\u2019s economy and threatening Prince Mohammed\u2019s ability to invest in new non-oil industries and attract foreign investment.\n\nSaudi officials, including Prince Abdulaziz, have unsuccessfully sought to stimulate oil prices in recent months, in part to increase the valuation of Aramco ahead of potential listing. Prince Mohammed wants to sell about 5% of the company in a process that could begin this year and he hopes will raise as much as $100 billion to invest domestically.\n\nPrince Abdulaziz, who earned a masters of business administration from King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals in 1985, has decadeslong experience in oil markets. He started attending OPEC meetings in 1987 as an adviser at the Saudi oil ministry. \u201cOther Saudi officials relied on an army of blue-eyed consultants. But he brought his own calculator and crunched the numbers himself,\u201d said an OPEC official.\n\nIn 1995, Prince Abdulaziz was named deputy to the recently appointed oil minister Ali al-Naimi. For years, he was mentioned as a candidate to replace Mr. Naimi but Mr. Falih, a nonroyal, was appointed as minister instead in 2016.\n\n\u201cEveryone assumed that the king and the crown prince would keep the good old rule of keeping royals out of the oil sector,\u201d a Saudi official said.\n\nPrince Mohammed initially reinforced that perception. He sidelined his older brother, Prince Abdulaziz, demoting him in April 2017 from deputy oil minister to a less influential position as state minister for energy affairs.\n\nThe crown prince, who is 25 years younger than the oil minister, saw in the multilingual Prince Abdulaziz, who enjoys art-house cinema and French architecture, a potential rival in global economic circles, people close to Prince Abdulaziz said at the time.\n\nSince then, Prince Abdulaziz has gradually regained influence among his family. He was given the responsibility to negotiate the reopening of joint oil fields with Kuwait and to persuade the U.S. to sell its nuclear technologies to the kingdom, people who know him said.\n\nPeople who have worked with Prince Abdulaziz say he is very focused on minute details, such as flower arrangements or finger food in meetings. He has a reputation inside OPEC for bargaining hard at the table, notably with Saudi Arabia\u2019s chief rival Iran, delegates he has befriended over more than a decade.\n\nThrough decades of high-stakes energy meetings, he has maintained an impish sense of humor. In the middle of one tense OPEC committee, when delegates couldn\u2019t decide on the date of their next gathering, the prince stunned those in the room by singing the theme from the American television sitcom \u201cHappy Days.\u201d\n\nWrite to Summer Said at summer.said@wsj.com, Benoit Faucon at benoit.faucon@wsj.com and Rory Jones at rory.jones@wsj.com", "description": "Mohammed bin Salman upended tradition by picking a royal insider to head the powerful ministry.", "authors": ["Summer Said", "Benoit Faucon", "Rory Jones", "Summer.Said Wsj.Com", "Benoit.Faucon Wsj.Com", "Rory.Jones Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105115/social", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
