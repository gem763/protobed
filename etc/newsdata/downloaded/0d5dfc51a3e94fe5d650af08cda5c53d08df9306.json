Leaders are at best expected to give the deal \"political\" approval and words of encouragement \u2013 which may not be enough for MPs back in Westminster.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

It can only be a political yes, we need much more time.\n\nThe state of affairs recalls warnings from member states in previous days, who had said an agreement needed to be finalised well ahead of the summit so their teams could scrutinise it.\n\nMember states have been kept mostly in the dark about the details of talks so far, with the Commission's team in a \"tunnel\" with the British side.\n\n\"I have no idea where we stand at all because we just don't know. We'll have to see what we get from Michel Barnier at 2pm this afternoon,\" one diplomat said.\n\n\"The more the deal is different from what we had prepared early 2018, the more time it will take for legal experts and customs experts to judge. The closer it is to what we had prepared a year and a half ago the easier it will be.\n\n\"But it's now clear that is too late to give a formal yes at this European Council. There's just not enough time. We don't need that, we can only give a political yes and come back to it another time.\"\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
