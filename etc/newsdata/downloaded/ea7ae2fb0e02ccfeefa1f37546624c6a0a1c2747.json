During the 2008 primary, he famously referred to his future boss as being \u201cclean\u201d and \u201carticulate.\u201d His 2020 campaign has been marked by a series of unforced errors when discussing racial issues, including an instance earlier this year when he said \u201cpoor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids.\u201d\n\n\n\nMany of Biden\u2019s slips point to a blindspot on race that has rightfully drawn significant attention over the last year. But his incoherence is not limited to speech that the political media labels as \u201cgaffes,\u201d but instead extends to much of what he says on basic questions about policy. The section in last Thursday\u2019s debate covering health care ended with a smirking Biden defending, in patriotic terms, a system that kills tens of thousands a year. His economic platform is that \u201cno one should be punished\u201d\u2014a not-so-subtle message to billionaires that he isn\u2019t interested in wealth redistribution. The best case he can make on health care and the economy, the two biggest issues in the primary, is that he will improve systems that already exist, which barely qualifies as a platform. Biden\u2019s incoherence comes not from some charming Washington-esque inability to tell a lie, but from a lack of real ideas about how the government should work.\n\n\n\nIn his piece about how Biden can find a platform that extends beyond reminding people that he once worked for Obama, Klein pointed to Biden\u2019s political style as the thing that makes the former vice president different. \u201cBiden\u2019s approach to politics\u2014whether it\u2019s foreign leaders, congressional negotiations, or the Iowa State Fair\u2014is relational,\u201d Klein writes. \u201cBiden was often deployed to do the in-person work Obama dismissed.\u201d In a piece arguing that the Democratic primary has been a debacle, New York\u2019s Jonathan Chait made a similar point. \u201cIt seems just as likely that many of Biden\u2019s supporters have a positive appreciation for compromise and pluralism,\u201d Chait wrote, \u201cdesigning policies that appeal to wide social and economic swaths of the country, rather than those that draw sharp cleavages between winners and losers.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe idea here is that Biden\u2019s appeal is as a dealmaker. This is something that Biden has run on himself, both in 1988, when he dropped out after being accused of plagiarism, and in 2008, when he quit the race after finishing fifth in Iowa. In the latter campaign, Biden\u2019s signature idea was to essentially make a new Sykes-Picot agreement, dividing Iraq into three semi-autonomous territories. (It was, and continues to be, a bad idea.) In fact, Biden\u2019s entire 2008 campaign was premised on a series of similar pragmatic-seeming compromises, on issues like Social Security (he promoted a plan that would involve bipartisan negotiations on a number of issues, including the retirement age and trumpeted his past work with Republican senators, including Bob Dole) and health care.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with making the case that being a back-slapping dealmaker is what America needs to cut through the Gordian knot at the center of our politics. (There\u2019s also not much right about it.) But it\u2019s not an idea and it certainly doesn\u2019t rise to the level of policy. This was, importantly, the basis of Biden\u2019s last, not-at-all successful campaign, when he ran as the candidate for those who wanted compromise and ended up getting crushed. But this approach\u2014of premising deal-making over ideas\u2014continues to define Biden\u2019s approach to politics.\n\nIt also continues to undercut this presidential campaign. One reason why Biden was so incoherent in Thursday\u2019s debate is that he doesn\u2019t have an ideological foundation to rely on when pressed. His instinct is to cut deals, not to find the best policy or solution. But that also means that Biden has little of substance to offer on most big policy questions. And, while it may very well be true that what voters are looking for is someone willing to compromise, Biden has run on that idea before, with disastrous results.\n\nIt\u2019s not exactly surprising that Biden, as true a creature of the Senate as there ever was, would think about politics this way. And there is an argument to be made that it does have its place in the White House, given the foreign policy-heavy responsibilities of the executive branch. But that means that Biden\u2019s struggles to make sense do not stem from his inability to get out from under Barack Obama\u2019s shadow or from his age. They\u2019re grounded in a shallow approach to policy that\u2019s more rooted in backroom deals than in real world consequences.", "description": "The former vice president is a dealmaker, not a deep thinker.", "authors": ["Alex Shephard"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/04b87db9a83a55b27dd005376badb1d3dcc76ac2.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
