I just kind of feel like it doesn't mean as much as it used to mean because the other part, the real part, I have it now and I'm so happy,\" she continued of Petty, who she made things Instagram official with back in December.\n\nIn addition to getting married, Minaj has also been thinking about starting a family, though it'll be a while before she and Petty take that step.\n\n\"We practice all the time, like, you know, three times a night,\" she quipped. \"... At first I was like, 'I want it now. I want it now.' And then I started thinking if I want it right, right now or if I want to wait another year because I have a couple things that I have to do.\"\n\nThe things Minaj alluded to include collaborations with Adele and Ariana Grande as well as her Fendi collection, which is based off of a line in her song, \"Chun-Li.\"\n\n\"I am so grateful to everyone at Fendi,\" she gushed. \"My work and relationship with them has been ideal since the day I went out there to meet with them. I'm honored, of course. It's Fendi! It's a big freaking deal! I had no idea by saying Fendi in my song that it would turn into a line, and thank God it did.\"\n\nMinaj's Fendi Prints On capsule collection launches globally on Oct. 16.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nNicki Minaj Reveals New Adele Collaboration: 'It's an Epic Song!'\n\nNicki Minaj's Capsule With This Luxury Fashion Label Is So Extra\n\nNicki Minaj Clarifies Her 'Abrupt & Insensitive' Retirement Tweet\n\nRelated Articles:", "description": "'I'm so happy.'", "authors": ["Paige Gawley"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/hx1ReNtGGof1FEMjM1JeXw--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/63eedf70f9102c5e00727b838ce4d488", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
