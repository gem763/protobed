Read more\n\nThe electric eel, which is a kind of fish rather than an eel, inspired the design of the first electric battery.\n\nFor centuries, it was believed that a single species existed throughout the region known as Greater Amazonia, encompassing parts of countries including Brazil, Suriname and Guyana.\n\nBut as part of a project to better understand electric eels and map wildlife in remote parts of South America, de Santana and his team decided to test that theory.\n\nAt first glance, they found little visible difference between creatures collected from different parts of the Amazon basin, suggesting the fish were indeed part of a single species.\n\nBut further analysis, including of DNA from 107 samples they collected, upended centuries of assumptions and revealed three species: the previously known Electrophorus electricus, along with Electrophorus voltai and Electrophorus varii.\n\nAnd their research also uncovered another stunning result: E. voltai is capable of delivering a jolt of 860 volts \u2013 much more than the 650 volts previously recorded from electric eels \u2013 \u201cmaking it the strongest bioelectricity generator known\u201d.\n\nThe findings, published on Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications, theorise that the three species evolved from a shared ancestor millions of years ago.\n\nThe researchers found each of the three species had a clearly defined habitat, with E. electricus living in the Guiana Shield region, E. voltai in the Brazilian Shield, a highland further south, and E. varii inhabiting slow-flowing lowland Amazon basin waters.\n\nAnd they suggest that the particularly strong electric shock that E. voltai can produce could be an adaptation to life in highland waters, where conductivity is reduced.\n\nElectric eels use their shock tactics for a variety of reasons, including hunting prey, self-defence, and navigation. They generate electricity from three specialised electric organs that can emit charges of varying strengths for different purposes.\n\nBut the discovery of the new species raises the possibility that different types of eels may have evolved different ways of generating electricity, perhaps better suited to their diverse environments.\n\n\u201cElectric eel physiology inspired the design of Volta\u2019s first electric battery, provided a basis ... for treating neurodegenerative diseases and recently promoted the advance of hydrogel batteries that could be used to power medical implants,\u201d de Santana said.", "description": "Electrophorus voltai can deliver a jolt of 860 volts, much more than existing record of 650 volts", "authors": ["Agence France-Presse"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b887f0882473021f3c77364a0dc96bac78bb1d0/0_203_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9668e8569a615f2a12287e393eb79338", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
