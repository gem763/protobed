Not unconstitutional,\u201d he said.\n\nMORE TESTIMONY PLANNED\n\nOn Friday, the House Foreign Affairs, Oversight and Intelligence Committees issued subpoenas for Ulrich Brechbuhl, a top aide to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and two officials from the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget (OMB): acting director Russell Vought and Michael Duffey, associate director for national security programs.\n\nThe anonymous whistleblower who set off the impeachment inquiry said in a written complaint that he was told Brechbuhl had listened in on a call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in July that is at the heart of the scandal.\n\nThe inquiry focuses on Trump\u2019s request for Ukraine to investigate a domestic political rival, Joe Biden, the former vice president who is a leading contender for the Democratic presidential nomination to face Trump in the 2020 election.\n\nVia the OMB, Trump had withheld $391 million in security assistance for Ukraine that had been approved by Congress. During the call, the Ukrainian president agreed to investigations of Biden and his son Hunter Biden\u2019s tenure on the board of a Ukrainian energy company.\n\nU.S. law prohibits candidates from accepting foreign help in an election.\n\nLawmakers want Duffey to appear on Nov. 5, and Vought and Brechbuhl on Nov. 6, the committees said in a statement.\n\nThe committees have scheduled more testimony within the next week, starting with Philip Reeker, acting assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, on Saturday.\n\nREPUBLICAN FIREWALL\n\nThe impeachment inquiry could lead to the House approving formal charges - articles of impeachment - which would prompt a trial in the Senate on whether to remove Trump from office. The Senate is controlled by Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans, who have shown little inclination toward removing him.\n\nFifty, all but three, of the Republican senators have now signed on to a resolution, led by Senator Lindsey Graham, calling the impeachment process unfair.\n\nTrump has pressured Republicans to adopt a more robust defense after two recent decisions - withdrawing U.S. troops from Syria and the now-reversed plan to hold a G7 summit at one of his resorts - drew criticism from members of his party.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. Attorney General William Barr, joined by Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey A.
