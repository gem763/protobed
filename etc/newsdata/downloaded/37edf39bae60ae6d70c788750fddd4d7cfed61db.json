Staunch liberal Maude\u2019s sharp exchanges with conservative Archie Bunker (Carroll O\u2019Connor) were so entertaining that Lear fashioned a series around her.\n\nAD\n\nIn a 1998 interview for the TV academy foundation\u2019s archive, Lear said he cast Mr. Macy as Maude Findlay\u2019s spouse based on his work in an off-Broadway play. In it, his character had a prolonged scene of choking to death on a chicken bone.\n\nAD\n\nIt was an unforgettable \u201ctour de force\u201d performance, Lear said.\n\nMr. Macy was born Wolf Martin Garber in Revere, Mass., on May 18, 1922, and grew up in Brooklyn, N.Y. He drove a taxi and held other day jobs while trying to land acting roles.\n\nOnstage, he appeared in the naughty musical revue \u201cOh! Calcutta!\u201d from 1969 to 1971 and the Paul Zindel play \u201cAnd Miss Reardon Drinks a Little\u201d in 1971.\n\nHe made dozens of guest appearances in TV series including \u201cSeinfeld,\u201d \u201cHow I Met Your Mother\u201d and \u201cER,\u201d and he had supporting roles in films. He was the jury foreman in \u201cThe Producers\u201d (1967) and the head comedy writer of a 1950s TV variety show in \u201cMy Favorite Year\u201d (1982). His other movies included the comedies \u201cThe Jerk\u201d (1979) and \u201cAnalyze This\u201d (1999).\n\nIn 1975, he married actress Samantha Harper. A complete list of survivors was not immediately available.\n\nRead more Washington Post obituaries\n\nAD", "description": "He was the foil to Bea Arthur\u2019s unyielding feminist on the daring 1970s sitcom \u201cMaude.\u201d", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/e28IZJuCJ3JaNA3D0nRAxj3UkRM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DSICVEXRZUI6TBUT6SD6IZ4EVI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
