It would be a great loss if the official opposition was allowed to implode.\n\nAs the nine years of the Zuma presidency demonstrated, the country needs a robust press, an independent judiciary and a strong opposition.\n\nAs Maimane showed with his questions to the president about Bosasa, it is only when a strong and credible opposition keeps government on its toes that transparency is upheld.\n\nRegardless of who emerges victorious, it is key that the party continues to be strong enough to play a critical role in holding government to account and enhancing our democracy.", "description": "A few years ago, it was inconceivable that we would be treated to the spectacle of a bitter public power struggle within the country\u2019s official opposition, the DA.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9440/f6c437f81bbc40a29677966044c25aa2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
