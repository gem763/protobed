But it is less great when said pregame show results in an enormous, on-field fire that sends smoke billowing toward fans in the stands.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what happened before the Tennessee Titans faced the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday at Nissan Stadium, a game that got off to a scorching start when a pyrotechnics machine near the sideline tipped over and began to shoot its flames horizontally.\n\nESPN reported the fire took place just after the Titans had celebrated the jersey retirements of former stars Eddie George and Steve McNair. Video showed plumes of black smoke billowing out in the stadium. The team said no one was hurt in the incident. The blaze appeared to have been extinguished by a lone man with a fire extinguisher.\n\nPart of the pyrotechnics equipment burst into flame shortly after the #Titans\u2019 entrance at Nissan Stadium. pic.twitter.com/5mlZPmOu2O \u2014 Erik Bacharach (@ErikBacharach) September 15, 2019\n\nIn a statement, the Titans alluded to a mechanical failure by one of their pyrotechnic devices that resulted in \u201cno injuries and minor field damage.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe vendor will be required by the state of Tennessee to undergo an inspection for the defective device and the others that were used to determine the final cause,\u201d the team said.\n\nThe Colts went on to beat the Titans, 19-17, on Sunday.\n\n\n\nA fire broke out before the Titans faced the Colts on Sunday.
