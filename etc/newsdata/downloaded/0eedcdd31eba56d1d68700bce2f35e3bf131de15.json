Futures on the S&P and Nasdaq were both higher.\n\nThe moves in pre-market trade come after Chinese officials cut short their trip to the United States, where they held discussions on trade. China described the talks as \"constructive\" and both sides said they would remain in contact. President Donald Trump had said China would increase its purchases of U.S. agricultural products as part of a bilateral trade deal. The cancellation may be seen by some investors as a sign the two countries are no closer to reaching a trade deal.\n\nAs a result, Wall Street ended Friday mostly lower.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Department of Justice has warned companies against Chinese theft. Speaking to CNBC Monday, the U.S. Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Adam Hickey, said: \"More cases are being opened that implicate trade secret theft.\"\n\nOn the data front, there will be manufacturing and services PMIs at 09:45 a.m. ET.\n\nIn the corporate world, there are no significant earnings releases. However, there's a strong focus on WeWork after Softbank is reportedly in favour of ousting CEO Adam Neumann.", "description": "U.S. stock index futures were slightly higher Monday morning.", "authors": ["Silvia Amaro"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106136524-1568821686943rtx738w5.jpg?v=1568821769", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
