I mentioned in yesterday\u2019s Afternoon Note that the market should have been lower halfway through the session based on the underlying market breadth, and that\u2019s what happened. The extraordinary light volume is also exacerbating moves during these late summer sessions.\n\nFinancials (XLF) took it on the chin again, weighed down by American International Group (AIG) and American Express (AXP). The XLF sector is up 11.2% in 2019, but it is down 6.3% over the past year, and it\u2019s looking vulnerable after hitting a double top earlier this year.\n\nMaterials (XLB) were also hit hard yesterday, as the winners in the sector reversed lower - perhaps it\u2019s a sign of profit-taking. We\u2019ve been overweight in the sector, and while there are some big winners, the losers are gaining to the downside. We are going to lower exposure in the model portfolio today.\n\nS&P 500 Index -0.79% Communication Services (XLC) -0.67% Consumer Discretionary (XLY) +0.03% Consumer Staples (XLP) -1.09% Energy (XLE) -0.84% Financials (XLF) -1.34% Health Care (XLV) -0.85% Industrials (XLI) -0.59% Materials (XLB) -1.17% Real Estate (XLRE) -0.74% Technology (XLK) -0.50% Utilities (XLU) -0.16%\n\nGyrations & Market Shakeouts\n\nThese market gyrations may be frightening for some and frustrating for most. However, they serve an important purpose if the market is to regain traction and rally into the end of the year. Let\u2019s face it, the last couple of weeks have shaken weak hands and made others weaker.\n\nI\u2019m not sure the market can break out between now and Labor Day. This is a great time to solidify a buy list, and even put on some positions until the big players return from back from the Hamptons and other locales to reload on the market. Keep in mind that it\u2019s been a good year, and it could still be a great year for the stock market.\n\nS&P 500 +15.7%\n\n383 higher\n\n308 +10%\n\n214 +20%\n\nDow Jones Industrial Average: +11.3%\n\nNASDAQ Composite: +19.8%\n\nRussell 2000: +11.1%\n\nHomebuilder stocks act great, although there could be pressure today after Toll Brothers (TOL) posted results that beat on revenue and crushed (beat by $0.18) on earnings. The guidance was slightly cautious, as there was a backlog decline in the total numbers and value. Management raised the lower end of the average selling price. Still, the better action isn\u2019t in the $881,000 average home sold by Toll Brothers, so this stock isn\u2019t the perfect proxy for homes in the heartland, where people leverage low mortgage rates.\n\nThe iShares US Home Construction ETF (ITB) index is trying to break out through a serious resistance point.\n\nBeware Bad Headlines\n\n\u201cHome Depot beats quarterly profit estimates, warns of tariff impact\u201d\n\n-Reuters Business\n\nI wrote about the National Association for Business Economics (NABE) report on Monday. Since then, I haven\u2019t seen a report or headline that echoed the real story of fewer business economists seeing a recession in 2019 and 2020. Instead, the news focused on 2021. If the media wants to really scare people, they should focus on a possible recession by 2025. This way, headlines could read: \u201c100% of economists see recession coming.\u201d\n\nQuestion of the Week With the conscious capitalism in America, including the Business Roundtable, saying profits are no longer the primary goal of business, are you changing your spending and investing habits? For instance, reports are out that Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods (DKS) is looking to stop selling guns. The retailer stopped selling certain rifles last year and raised its age to purchase firearms. If the company stops selling firearms altogether, would you stop shopping there, and would you invest in the stock? https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/20/business/dicks-sporting-goods-gun-sales/index.html?utm_medium=social&utm_content=2019-08-20T13:20:04&utm_term=link&utm_source=twbusiness DKS\n\nApproach\n\nNo new positions on yesterday.
