No.\n\nThe problem with business investment is uncertainty over tariffs and supply chains. Profit margins have been squeezed because corporations have been unable to raise prices due to fear they will lose market share. Giving the market a rate cut will not help the fundamental problem.\n\nThe impact on the U.S.\u2019s real gross domestic product has also stemmed from declining business investment. Companies\u2019 long-run business investment plans have been delayed or indefinitely postponed, and this can clearly be seen in the investment category of real GDP. This category is relatively small in its total impact on GDP; however, the U.S. economy has clearly decelerated even if a recession is unlikely.\n\nCompanies have lost pricing power.
