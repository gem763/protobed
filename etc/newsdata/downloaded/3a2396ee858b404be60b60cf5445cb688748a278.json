I\u2019ve spoken to [HUD] Sec. Carson in terms of the housing element. But we have people living in our\u2026 best highways our best streets, our best entrances to buildings and pay tremendous taxes, where people in those buildings pay tremendous taxes, where they went to those locations because of the prestige,\" he said.\n\n\"In many cases they came from other countries and they moved to Los Angeles or they moved to San Francisco because of the prestige of the city, and all of a sudden they have tents. Hundreds and hundreds of tents and people living at the entrance to their office building. And they want to leave. And the people of San Francisco are fed up, and the people of Los Angeles are fed up. And we\u2019re looking at it, and we\u2019ll be doing something about it.\u201d\n\n(MORE: Trump claims homelessness is 'phenomenon that started 2 years ago,' blames 'liberal' mayors)\n\nPHOTO: Homeless camp in tents in downtown Los Angeles, Sept. 17, 2019. (Damian Dovarganes/AP) More\n\nLocal officials and advocates have pointed the finger back at Trump, saying he has proposed huge cuts in programs from the Department of Housing and Urban Development and other agencies that help people transition out of homelessness and that the federal government could do more to expand affordable housing.\n\nCarson said the administration is looking at ways to support police working in areas with homeless populations and mental health professionals on how to support people dealing with homelessness. In response to criticism about federal funding Carson said \"just throwing money at the problem isn't going to help,\" saying they need to focus on reducing the cost of housing so developers can build more.\n\n\"What we need to do is analyze the reasons that the costs are so high, and it's because of all regulatory barriers and restrictions. In California, it's even solar panels on all the new constructs. That just raises the price ridiculously. In San Francisco, the median home price in the San Francisco bay area is $1.7 million. Who can afford that? So we really need to go to the supply side here. What can we do to create more supply? And if we have adequate supply, that will automatically take care of the pricing. Basic economics,\" he said on Fox News.\n\nPHOTO: Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson testifies during a Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee hearing on September 10, 2019, in Washington, D.C.
