Though other product areas are growing \u2014 such as its wearables, home, and accessories business \u2014 the iPhone is still Apple's biggest moneymaker.\n\nThe next iPhone launch will likely come just before Google is planning to release its Pixel 4 smartphone, which it typically debuts in October. It also follows the launch of Samsung's giant, stylus-wielding Galaxy Note 10. Suffice it to say Apple's new iPhone will face significant competition heading into the holiday season, as usual.\n\nHere's a look at what we're expecting to see in this year's iPhones, based on the reports and rumors that have surfaced so far.", "description": "Apple is expected to release three new iPhones again this fall, and the biggest upgrade may be a new triple-camera system.", "authors": ["Lisa Eadicicco"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5c8684c6262898039d138292-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
