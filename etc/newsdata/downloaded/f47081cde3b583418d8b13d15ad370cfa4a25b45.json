Amid the bravado, after three long years of what were supposed to be the easiest negotiations on earth, I understand the temptation for exhausted MPs, with no time for proper scrutiny and with the fear of no deal hanging over them, to hold their noses in the unusual Saturday sitting and vote it over the line.\n\nI would, however, remind them to look behind the shiny bright fa\u00e7ade of the deal and examine its contents. Yes, it is a deal but what will it really mean? How will future generations hold you to account? Remember what is at stake: the future of our country, the freedoms and livelihoods of constituents and the union of the United Kingdom. The Johnson withdrawal agreement has tweaked a few paragraphs in the Northern Ireland protocol and the political declaration \u2013 ie the two annexes to May\u2019s agreement from April 2019 \u2013 but much of it is a straight cut and paste of May\u2019s deal. Parliament rejected that deal three times on the basis that it was not good enough. Johnson\u2019s deal is no better and significantly worse in many respects.\n\nDominic Cummings\u2019 propaganda machine is successfully keeping media focus on the NI protocol when the real scrutiny should be on the political declaration. The PD delivers the meat of the UK\u2019s future relationship with its largest trading neighbour for the next 10 to 20 years.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nOnce approved and ratified, the withdrawal agreement will be binding and cannot be changed, but it deals with a very limited number of matters \u2013 money, EU citizens and the transition period. In a sense, it is only about the past. The political declaration, on the other hand, is about the UK\u2019s future interaction in over 65 different sectors and the rights and opportunities for UK citizens to enjoy (or not) important economic and social benefits. The declaration is not binding on this government or any future government and can be changed at will by any future government. If, in due course, the EU is not happy with the terms of the future trade relationship, then the UK still risks leaving without a deal in 2020.\n\nBelow is a quick summary of the effects of the Johnson deal:\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

That is a crucial difference. Rather than having (as per May\u2019s deal) a close \u201ceconomic partnership\u201d and a trading relationship that is \u201cas close as possible\u201d with the EU, the UK will now be a distinct market, setting its own rules and trading on a hands-off Canada-style basis. There will be no single market or customs area, market access will be much more restricted and trade will not be frictionless.\n\nContrary to previous Tory desires to reduce regulatory burdens, there will be more customs checks and red tape when it comes to UK exports to the EU. UK standards will most likely be lower than the EU so some goods may not be able to be marketed and sold in 31 states if they do not meet EU standards. Companies will have to comply with multiple rules and redesign their products for different markets. Or they will decide to comply with EU standards anyway. Products may become more expensive (due to lower economies of scale) or face delays.\n\nIn terms of EU imports to the UK, they are most likely to be of a superior standard so will meet the UK minimum requirements. They\u2019re likely to be cheaper (larger scale and one-stop production for both markets) and transit faster. This may put UK businesses at a competitive disadvantage.\n\nYou also have to analyse this scenario in a wider WTO context \u2013 we still don\u2019t know whether the UK will apply zero tariffs for imports from the rest of the world or insist on product standards. UK agriculture and manufacturing could face a double whammy if sales are undercut by cheaper EU and foreign imports.\n\nMaintaining standards\n\nThere is a new section XIV \u2013 Clause 77 \u2013 that requires the UK to uphold the common high standards applicable in the EU and UK in the areas of state aid, competition, social and employment standards, environment, climate change and relevant tax matters. The UK cannot undermine the EU level playing field by allowing circumvention of EU rules.\n\nThis sounds positive, but this is a non-binding commitment, not enforceable until written into an FTA. The UK will no longer be committing to the EU rule book but just a loose commitment to observe high standards \u2013 whether from the EU or the rest of the world. In many areas, the EU standards are replicated elsewhere, for example, the EU competition rules are being copied in Hong Kong, China and Africa, so the idea that the UK will be able to move away from them when dealing with other countries is wholly misleading.\n\nAgencies\n\nEU rules for regulated industries are often made through regulatory networks and agencies where the UK currently enjoys full participation in rule-making. Now, the UK has downgraded its involvement to exploring \u201cthe possibility of cooperation\u201d within the EMA (European Medicines Agency), EBA (European Banking Authority) and EASA (European Aviation Safety Agency). The wording is weak and offers no guarantees. For other networks, like telecoms, energy, transport and chemicals, the wording is feebler, with access dependent on its extent of alignment and cooperation. It is clear that the UK will only have observer status \u2013 meaning that we will be rule-takers without any say in the formulation of policy or actual decision-making regarding authorisations or sanctions.\n\nServices\n\nAs over 80 per cent of the UK economy is driven by services, which has been a huge success story for UK business in the EU, there is the risk of severe dereliction of duty if MPs do not focus on the service industry. This is not just financial services but digital broadcasting, insurance, legal and accounting advice, consultancy, e-commerce, data and transportation services, which to date are provided on a pan-European basis across all 31 EU/EEA states.\n\nHere, the Johnson and May deals are identical. Services will no longer benefit from full passporting in all 31 EU/EEA states. Instead, they will be relegated to the WTO framework with possible add-ons from a Canada-style free trade agreement, which are vastly inferior to the Lisbon Treaty. So, what does this mean?\n\n85 per cent of our economy (services) will effectively be in the same position as a no-deal scenario.\n\nWTO terms for services are rudimentary compared with the EU rules \u2013 they allow minimum access to markets and prohibition on direct discrimination. Host states still retain discretionary power to impose regulatory barriers and standards.\n\nThere is a limited equivalence regime for financial services.\n\nWhen it comes to digital services, there is no guarantee of rule of origin so broadcasters and programmers (Sky, Netflix) will need to move registration and staff to other member states.\n\nIn e-commerce, there is limited cooperation on rules but no guarantees. Courier services are not covered, so one impact may be that Amazon cannot provide next day deliveries from any order fulfilled from an EU member state.\n\nMany sectors are dependent upon the EU\u2019s state of the art passporting regimes \u2013 eg life insurance, travel insurance, health insurance, car insurance, financial services, architects, doctors, nurses, teachers and lawyers. They are all governed by their home state rules and do not have to comply with 31 different sets of requirements.\n\nWhat this will mean in practice? As an example, a UK law firm will no longer be able to provide advice and legal representation across multiple states. Instead, their lawyer will have to requalify, establish and comply with Belgian rules and pay registration and insurance fees in both countries. That will not give the right to practise from Belgium across other EU countries.\n\nAccording to the Law Society, the UK legal sector is the largest in the EU and contributed more than \u00a326bn to the economy in 2017. EU law firms are keen to replace the UK\u2019s success. The APPG on Legal and Constitutional Affairs has recommended that this \u201cdevastating\u201d impact should be \u201cavoided at all costs\u201d. That story is replicated across multiple different business sectors.\n\nGovernance and diplomacy\n\nClauses 123 and 124: Changes to Part II remove the prior commitment in May\u2019s deal to engage in cooperation and dialogue to liaise with the EU to work as partners on regional and global issues. This reaffirms the UK\u2019s autonomy and lack of commitment to cooperate or align its geopolitical strategic agenda. This means a wider global shift in diplomacy and international standing as the UK is not committing to align with the EU in global politics but has the freedom to align itself with other world powers (notably the US). This may cause turbulence in wider markets such as Asia, Japan and South Korea.\n\nThe dispute resolution mechanisms set out in May\u2019s deal have also been altered. Disputes may be determined by the Joint Committee and Arbitral Tribunals, but there will be no obligation to refer to the Court of Justice of the European Union (as per May\u2019s deal) but only a recommended reference where the dispute raises a question of interpretation of EU law. The ruling from the CJEU will be binding on the UK and there will be sanctions in terms of suspended access to markets and financial compensation if it does not adhere to the ruling.\n\nAll in all, when Johnson did his victory lap in the European parliament yesterday, I rather think his fellow leaders were celebrating their upper hand in the negotiations and the concessions accepted by the UK in the last desperate hours. Johnson set out to procure a Rolls Royce but came back with a second-hand Reliant Robin.\n\nThis article was written by Gina Miller with expert legal input from barrister Anneli Howard", "description": "Boris Johnson is being hailed a hero for pulling off a revised Brexit deal in the least likely circumstances.
