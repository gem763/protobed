The officers confronted the shooter within 30 seconds, a swift response credited with preventing more deaths.\n\n\u201cThere are few people who could have done, and would have done, what these police officers did,\u201d Trump said from the White House\u2019s East Room. \u201cTo each of you, we are in awe of your swift response, sterling professionalism, and rock-solid nerves of steel.\u201d\n\nOHIO SHOOTING VICTIMS INCLUDE GUNMAN'S SISTER, MOTHER OF TWO WHO WAS A NURSING STUDENT\n\nThe Dayton police officers who received the Medal of Valor were Sgt. William Knight and officers Brian Rolfes, Jeremy Campbell, Vincent Carter, Ryan Nabel and David Denlinger.\n\nAccording to authorities, 24-year-old Connor Betts shot 26 people in the span of 32 seconds before Knight returned fire after hearing the gunshots from his police cruiser. The five other officers rushed toward the gunman and prevented him from continuing his rampage.\n\n\u201cThese officers were the thin blue line between life and death,\u201d Barr said. \u201cWe thank God on that horrible night in Dayton we had men with these qualities.\u201d\n\nThe president also honored the heroism of five civilians with heroic commendations for having helped others as a gunman opened fire at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, killing 22 people and wounding others.\n\nCalling the shooter \u201csoulless and bigoted\u201d and the attack \u201cracist,\u201d Trump went on to praise the civilians who put their lives in danger to help save others when the gunman began his shooting inside the Walmart.\n\nEL PASO SHOOTING SUSPECT'S MOM SAYS SHE CALLED POLICE WITH CONCERN ABOUT RIFLE SON OWNED: REPORT\n\n\u201cIn the darkest moments of despair, God called them into action and they put love of their neighbor above their life,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe are forever inspired by their goodness and the grace of their deeds.\u201d\n\nThe commendations were granted to Robert Evans, who notified store employees of the shooting; Gilbert Serna, who guided customers to the back entrance during the shooting and hid them in shipping containers; Marisela Luna, who guided customers near the store\u2019s lobby; Angelica Silva, who helped save the lives of wounded victims; and Chris Grant, who was wounded when he threw soda bottles at the shooter to district him.\n\n\u201cTo the families of the heroes, you understand the difference your loved ones made in lives,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe thank you from bottom of our hearts.\u201d\n\nThe pair of shootings in August \u2013 followed by another one in Texas weeks later \u2013 has sparked renewed national discussion of gun control.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn the days after the shootings, which happened within 24 hours of each other, Trump signaled he was open to proposals for new background checks, saying \"there is a great appetite\" for such measures. But within days, following a call with NRA president Wayne LaPierre, Trump abruptly changed his tone and said background checks would not have helped.\n\nTrump's comments were reminiscent of his wavering last year, when he vowed to support background checks in the wake of a school shooting in Parkland, Florida, only to relent after receiving pressure from the NRA.\n\nThis time there seems to be more sustained momentum to produce some sort of measure after Trump asked aides to pull together a comprehensive list of ideas. White House officials have been meeting with lawmakers and congressional staff as they try to formulate a plan Trump can support without risking fallout from his political base.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "President Trump on Monday presented the nations award highest award for public safety to six Dayton police officers who responded to last month\u2019s mass shooting in the Ohio city that left nine people dead and more than two dozen injured.", "authors": ["Andrew O'Reilly"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/09/694940094001_6084702150001_6084702521001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
