He considered holding up billions in foreign aid but was talked out of it by lawmakers and aides who insisted it would be detrimental to national security. He quietly diverted money from other accounts to immigration enforcement.\n\nThe Constitution may give Congress the power of the purse, but that hasn\u2019t stopped the president from pushing beyond his predecessors to ignore Capitol Hill and do what he wants with the federal budget.\n\nThese power plays are reflective of Trump\u2019s style as a businessman: Find your leverage, use your power and ignore the usual rules.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t fault them for trying to be innovative in how they can fund their priorities,\u201d Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) told POLITICO on Tuesday. \u201cBut where I have concerns is where they have exercised a level of authority that doesn\u2019t exist, that goes beyond.\u201d\n\nSign up for Morning Trade A speed read on global trade news \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

He\u2019s pretty bold but I\u2019ll tell you this, he has slowed the number of illegal immigrants coming into this country.\u201d\n\nA senior administration official said that the Office of Management and Budget \"is committed to making effective use of every tool at our disposal, according to the law, to advance the President\u2019s pro-growth agenda.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s six times Trump has threatened to withhold or move taxpayer money to get what he wants:\n\nRunning out the clock on foreign aid \u2014 Acting White House budget director Russ Vought and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney presented Trump with a proposal last month to freeze more than $4 billion in foreign aid by tying up the funds in the last days of the fiscal year. Lawmakers and administration officials in both parties were successful in talking the president out of the plan the budget advisers had hatched, arguing that it was both detrimental to national security and a violation of Congress\u2019 constitutionally granted power of the purse. The administration also backed off a similar plan to withhold foreign aid last year and cut hundreds of millions of dollars in help to Central America this spring.\n\nDiverting Homeland Security cash \u2014 Besides the national emergency declaration the president handed down earlier this year, his administration has also quietly transferred hundreds of millions of dollars to help with immigration enforcement. This summer, the Department of Homeland Security informed Congress it is diverting $271 million \u2014 including $155 million in federal disaster aid \u2014 to beef up funding for its immigration efforts. That move follows the administration\u2019s controversial decision last year to shift disaster aid and other DHS funding toward immigration detention and deportation work.\n\nSlow-walking State Department funds \u2014 Despite abandoning the idea of yanking back foreign aid as the fiscal year draws to a close on Sept. 30, the Trump administration is still keeping State Department spending on a short leash. Initially, OMB said that cash could only be spent at a daily rate of 2 percent, more recently shifting to a weekly rate that varies in amount.\n\nShifting money to the border wall \u2014 The president notched a victory this summer when the Supreme Court allowed his administration to continue taking money from other accounts to build the border wall. But that doesn\u2019t mean the court will feel the same about similar suits brought by the likes of the House of Representatives and 20 states.\n\nFreezing Ukraine assistance \u2014 The president said this week that he didn't use the threat of withholding foreign aid to persuade Ukraine to investigate his political opponent. But his administration did admit last month to withholding $250 million in military assistance to the country, before releasing those funds following bipartisan blowback.\n\nDipping into National Parks fees \u2014 During the five-week government shutdown earlier this year, the Trump administration siphoned cash from National Park Service fees to keep services going as the president held the line on demanding border wall funding. From the beginning, lawmakers warned that the move was out of bounds. And now the government\u2019s own watchdog has ruled that the administration violated federal laws with that money grab.", "description": "The power plays are reflective of Trump\u2019s style as a businessman: Find your leverage, use your power and ignore the usual rules.", "authors": ["Jennifer Scholtes", "Caitlin Emma"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/18/1b/f1e02a704c19a064dd7fe5887494/20190922-trump-guns-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
