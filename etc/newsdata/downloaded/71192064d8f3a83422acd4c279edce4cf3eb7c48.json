But having bet everything on getting Britain out of the European Union by Oct. 31, he can\u2019t back down.\n\nThe U.K. prime minister has lost all authority in the House of Commons and must find a way to win its support for an election so he can get a shot at commanding a majority. If he can\u2019t, he will be trapped in office, compelled by law to request a further delay to Brexit.\n\nJohnson is the third Conservative leader to be undermined by the intractable task of delivering Brexit more than three years after the fateful 2016 referendum. Unlike his two predecessors, though, he was a key architect in persuading the British public to vote for it.\n\nThat decision was meant to settle the European question in British politics that had been lurking for decades. Instead, it\u2019s torn the Tories apart and left a nation that was once the benchmark for stability and pragmatism on the cusp of a third election in just over four years. There\u2019s also no guarantee it will break the deadlock that\u2019s paralyzed a country of almost 70 million people.\n\nAs European Union leaders monitored events, the chaos that has engulfed the U.K. establishment was brought to life in a charged House of Commons. Earlier in the day, the grandson of Winston Churchill was close to tears in an emotional farewell to his colleagues after getting thrown out of the party for siding against Johnson. He had been a Tory member of Parliament for 37 years.\n\nAnd the mood only got worse as the hours wore on. In a dramatic series of evening votes on Wednesday, members of Parliament moved to stop Johnson forcing the U.K. out of the bloc without a deal next month, effectively wrecking his mission to deliver Brexit by Oct. 31.\n\nWhen he angrily responded with a desperate appeal for a snap general election, Parliament rejected that, too.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t negotiate with Boris Johnson,\u201d said John McDonnell, one of the leading figures of the opposition Labour Party, adding that the prime minister has a \u201cpassing relationship with the truth.\u201d Good will and trust in Parliament are in short supply, adding to impasse.\n\nJohnson, who exploited Parliament\u2019s Brexit deadlock to depose Theresa May and become prime minister, has now found himself a victim of the same forces that destroyed her.\n\nHe was the face of the Leave campaign and has sold himself to his party as a tough negotiator who would force EU leaders to back down by threatening to take Britain out of the EU without a deal. Yet he shown himself unable to get his way even in his own party.\n\nAfter he threw 21 MPs who voted against him out of the Conservatives on Tuesday night, the rebels turned up on Wednesday and refused to sit on the opposition benches, staying in their old seats behind the prime minister in a show of defiance.\n\n\u201cIt is completely impossible for government to function if the House of Commons refuses to pass anything that the government proposes,\u201d the prime minister told a noisy parliament. \u201cIn my view and the view of the government, there must now be an election on Tuesday 15 October.\u201d\n\nHis appeal didn\u2019t work as Labour is divided. Some in the party argue it\u2019s a chance to grab power, something that seemed an impossible idea only a few years ago. Others fear that Johnson would win a majority and be able to seek a no-deal Brexit. Timing -- before or after Oct. 31 -- is the key for them.\n\n\u201cWe want an election because we look forward to turfing this government out,\u201d Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said. \u201cThe offer of the election today is a bit like the offer of an apple to Snow White by the wicked queen -- because what he\u2019s offering is not an apple or even an election, but the poison of no deal.\u201d\n\nCorbyn said he would back an election once the bill to stop a no-deal Brexit had become law. Johnson accused the Labour leader of being too scared of losing to fight a contest.\n\nA person familiar with the matter said Johnson plans to keep pushing. And while Johnson is a talented campaigner -- as the 2016 surprise outcome proved -- going to the polls in the current, highly volatile climate is a huge gamble for the Conservatives.\n\nTwo years ago, May called a snap election expecting to win a landslide. Instead, she lost the majority she started with, a failure that resulted in the chaos and confusion that has defined British politics ever since.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Boris Johnson was humiliated by Parliament for a second day running, with his do-or-die Brexit strategy derailed and even his plan for a general election rejected.
