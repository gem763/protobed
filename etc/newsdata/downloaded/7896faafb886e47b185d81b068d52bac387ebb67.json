'But he can be bullied in one-on-ones in the box and he's not especially good in the air.\n\n'Maguire has that presence and those physical qualities, and that is very important.'\n\nIt proved to be a timely assessment of the United defender, who was shown seconds later missing a header unchallenged in the warm-up before their game against West Ham.\n\nMoments after Mourinho's comments, Lindelof was seen going up for header during warm-up\n\nDespite being uncontested, the United defender managed to completely miss the ball\n\nFans took to Twitter to joke about the timing of Mourinho's comments. One fan wrote: The absolute best part of this clip - not a second after Mourinho says Lindelof is not great in the air... Lindeof whiffs on an uncontested free header on a ball being lobbed to him in the warm-up.'\n\nAnother added: 'Mourinho talking about Lindelof: 'He's not especially good in the air.' I'm not sure if that was edited, but my goodness, talk about timing.'\n\nOne fan criticised the Portuguese boss for attacking Lindelof when he was the one who signed him, saying: 'The irony that Mourinho is slamming Lindelof . Hang on... didn't that moaner sign him?'\n\nMourinho on Lindelof:\n\n\n\nTalk about perfect timing. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02pic.twitter.com/1YvoXlAXnl \u2014 UTFR \ud83c\uddfe\ud83c\uddea (@ManUtd_HQ) September 22, 2019", "description": "Jose Mourinho left fans in stitches after criticising\u00a0Victor Lindelof's aerial ability just moments before he was seen missing a header during Sunday's warm-up.", "authors": ["Jordan Seward For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/22/16/18788822-0-image-a-30_1569167136093.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
