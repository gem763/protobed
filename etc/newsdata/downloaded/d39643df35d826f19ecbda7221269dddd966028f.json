As the game went on, he started to not feel so great.\u201d\n\nHale said he expects Martinez to be with the team when the Nationals begin a series Monday night at the first-place St. Louis Cardinals.\n\n\u201cHopefully he is doing great,\u201d Kendrick said. \u201cI love Davey.\u201d\n\nKendrick had three hits and drove in three runs while Sanchez gave up just three hits and no runs in seven innings, lowering his ERA to 3.86.\n\nThe Nationals (82-66) won just one of three against the Braves (93-58) in the weekend series and were outscored 15-1 in the first two games. Washington has a 1\u00bd-game lead over the Chicago Cubs for the top spot in the wild-card standings as the Cubs won 16-6 over the Pittsburgh Pirates.\n\nWashington also clinched an eighth straight winning season \u2014 something only the New York Yankees, Los Angeles Dodgers and St. Louis Cardinals can also claim.\n\n\u201cWe are still in a good spot,\u201d Kendrick said of the playoff chase.\n\nWashington center fielder Victor Robles had two hits, scored twice and battled the sun to make several fine catches.\n\nSanchez, who helped Atlanta win the division in 2018, used his change-up effectively against a power-hitting team and improved to 3-0 this season against the Braves before a crowd of 29,350.\n\n\u201cMy changeup is my best pitch for me. It helps me keep those guys out of balance,\u201d Sanchez said.\n\nThe 35-year-old from Venezuela improved to 8-11 in his career against the Braves.\n\n\u201cHe is a big-game pitcher,\u201d Hale said. \u201cHe is a leader in this clubhouse when he is not pitching. It is one we needed. He got us going. We know Atlanta is a good club. It was a big win for us.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals\u2019 chances of making the playoffs were 93.4% before Sunday\u2019s game, according to ESPN. The Braves lead the National League East by 9\u00bd games.\n\nGetting another start at catcher, Yan Gomes had a two-run single as the Nationals took a 2-0 lead in the second. Washington added three more in the third, as Kendrick had a two-run single and Robles walked with the bases loaded to make it 5-0.\n\nKendrick hit a long solo homer to left in the fifth for a 6-0 lead and the Nationals added a run in the sixth on a double-play grounder hit by Adam Eaton. Kendrick upped his average to .336.\n\nBraves starting pitcher Max Fried (16-6) gave up five runs in just 2 1/3 innings in his shortest outing since May 7.\n\nThe Washington lineup again was missing slugger Matt Adams, who hurt his shoulder Thursday on the road against the Minnesota Twins.\n\nMartinez said before the game Adams has an AC sprain and is day to day, so Kendrick got the start at first base over Ryan Zimmerman.\n\nWashington begins a three-game series Monday against the Cardinals, who will start right-hander Dakota Hudson (15-7, 3.38). The Nationals will counter with Stephen Strasburg (17-6, 3.49), who leads the National League in wins.\n\n\u201cEvery game that we win right now is important for us,\u201d Sanchez said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
