Most of this is her fault because she's never tried to train him out of attacking people, stealing food and screaming continually in the night because he used to be an outdoor cat. Her parents live out in the country, and he was basically a farm cat my girlfriend brought with her to the city. She has not even had him fixed.\n\nThat sounds very judgmental, but he's a cat. You can't blame him for this stuff, it's not like he knows better.\n\nI don't want to live with this cat. My girlfriend says my refusal to move in until the cat is gone is a \"me or the cat\" ultimatum. I don't think that's entirely fair; he is 18 so I can just wait out nature. I did suggest she could rehome the cat with her parents, whom he used to live with, but that was the only \"give up the cat\" suggestion I made.\n\nWe are fighting about this a lot. It seems ridiculous to break up over a cat when we both love cats \u2014 I mean, I don't like this one but I'd certainly never want to see it harmed or unhappy. However, she doesn't want to start waiting for her beloved cat to die and I will not move in with this animal. So maybe ridiculous is all that's left?\n\nI am also allergic. My girlfriend doesn't believe me because I had cats of my own as a kid, but it's usually mild enough to medicate away. This cat is, possibly from sheer force of will, more allergy-inducing than most. Not enough to endanger my life, but not pleasant to live with.\n\n\n\n(Nick Galifianakis/for The Washington Post)\n\n\u2014 Ultimatum or Condition?\n\nUltimatum or Condition?: \u201cI am also allergic. My girlfriend doesn\u2019t believe me\u201d:\n\nIs it possible the cat is your guardian angel, entertainingly packaged as a feline hellbeast?\n\nI\u2019d move in with a screaming aggressive unfixed barn cat before I\u2019d move in with someone who dismissed my health issues as a ploy to get my way. Allergy-deniers have featured in some of the most horrifying stories ever published in this space. It\u2019s sociopathic.\n\nAnd she\u2019s calling you a liar.\n\nSee? No more \u201cridiculous reason to break up\u201d problem, and no cats had to die in the making of this answer.\n\nIf you need other reasons, then see what readers said:\n\nAn un-neutered tom cat who grew up in a barn being kept in an apartment? That poor animal, no wonder it acts the way it does.\n\n\u2014 Anonymous\n\nThis cat has a horrible girlfriend: doesn't care what the cat does to other people, doesn't want to find a good solution for all three of you, and thinks you're lying to get your way. Don't move in with her even if the cat dies today.\n\n\u2014 Warning\n\nI'm allergic but live with two cats because there is a BIG difference in how each particular cat affects you. Oh, and you really need to dump her.\n\n\u2014 Allergic\n\nIf she hasn't bothered to have her cat fixed, SHE is responsible for a lot of his behavior, especially the constant screaming. Thank the cat and ditch the girlfriend!\n\n\u2014 I'm With Caroline\n\nI\u2019m With Caroline: Exactly. And Caroline and I rarely agree on anything.", "description": "Her accusation that you are lying about your allergy is a good reason to break up.", "authors": ["Carolyn Hax", "Advice Columnist", "October At Pm", "Carolyn Hax Started Her Advice Column In", "After Five Years As A Copy Editor", "News Editor In Style", "None As A Therapist.
