As evidence, Jarrett pointed to the man that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi D-Calif., has empowered to lead the inquiry.\n\n\u201cNancy Pelosi knows this,\u201d said Jarrett. \u201cIn January of this year, she said we cannot impeach for political reasons and now she is doing precisely that. And the person that she has handled the gavel to, Adam Schiff, has a long and distinguished record of not just hatred of President Trump but lies and deceptions and false claims.\u201d\n\nWASHINGTON POST AWARDS ADAM SCHIFF 'FOUR PINOCCHIOS' FOR FALSE COMMENTS ABOUT WHISTLEBLOWER\n\n\u201cThis is exactly what the framers feared: that an opposing party would seek to remove a president under impeachment for purely, political, partisan reasons or personal animus,\u201d Jarrett argued.\n\nOn Friday, The Washington Post awarded House Intelligence Committee Chairman Schiff \u201cFour Pinocchios\u201d for misleading the media over his advanced knowledge of a whistleblower\u2019s concerns regarding the now-infamous phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nJarrett said he listed a litany of instances raising concerns over Schiff\u2019s integrity in his new book, \u201cWitch Hunt: The Story of the Greatest Mass Delusion in American Political History.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Schiff] pretended he had information he never had, he lied about Carter Page, he lied about the dossier, he lied about saying he had evidence of collusion with President Trump and Russia\u2026 He is absolutely the worst person to be presiding over this and if Democrats were serious about impeachment Pelosi would dump Adam Schiff,\u201d he said.\n\nLaurie Watkins, former Florida Policy Director for President Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign, disagreed with Jarrett, saying that President Trump has behaved in ways that have warranted an impeachment investigation.\n\nWatkins said the Congressional probe is \u201cjust scratching the surface... as far as the involvement and level of involvement of people in this administration\" in an alleged plot to force the Ukrainian government to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter's involvement in a Ukranian natural gas company.\n\nFox News Political Contributor Tammy Bruce said that Democrats may have reason to demand an investigation of the president, but she believes that the process that they are carrying out is fatally flawed.\n\n\u201cIt is now a classic \u2018star chamber,''' said Bruce, referring to the 15th century English court characterized by secrecy and lack of due process. \"It is a classic framework where the accused doesn\u2019t get to know about their accusers. Their defense does not get to speak up.\"\n\nSENIOR HOUSE MEMBER SAYS HOUSE DEMOCRATS BELIEVE THEY HAVE VOTES TO PASS ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT\n\nBruce continued, \u201c[Democrats] could hold the vote today without any investigation and everyone would vote \u2018yes.\u2019 It would be like getting the jury together and then going in and saying \u2018We don\u2019t need to have the trial. What do you think about this guy?\u2019 That is what has been set up \u2013 that I think all of us would agree is inappropriate.\"\n\nA senior member of the House Democratic Caucus told Fox News on Sunday that while leadership hasn't counted votes to \"impeach,\" they believed that there are 217 votes needed to pass articles of impeachment against President Trump stemming from his Ukraine call -- even before their planned hearings or a formal investigation.\n\nJarrett concluded, \u201cThis is Queen Nancy Pelosi \u2018Off with his head \u2013 trial to be had later.\u2019 This is anathema to the democratic process -- to our constitutional democracy.\u201d\n\nTo watch all of \"Deep Dive\", visit Fox Nation and join today.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR A FOX NATION FREE TRIAL\n\nFox Nation programs are viewable on-demand and from your mobile device app, but available only for Fox Nation subscribers.
