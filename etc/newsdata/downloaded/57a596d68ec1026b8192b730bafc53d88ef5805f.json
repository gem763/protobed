Once the darling of Obama-era Democratic Washington, the company today faces a barrage of criticism from the left, most vocally expressed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s (D-Mass.) trust-busting calls on the 2020 campaign trail.\n\nAnd Facebook has only itself to blame, Waters told Zuckerberg.\n\n\u201cYou have opened up a serious discussion about whether Facebook should be broken up,\" the California Democrat said early in the hearing as she reeled off a series of complaints about everything from the company\u2019s role in facilitating foreign interference in U.S. elections to the lack of diversity in its leadership ranks.\n\nThat set the tone for much of the rest of the day, as the committee\u2019s Democrats repeatedly lambasted Facebook for allowing politicians to lie in political ads without facing fact-checking \u2014 a policy that has drawn the ire of top 2020 contenders including Warren and Joe Biden, himself the subject of a misleading attack ad from the Trump campaign.\n\nZuckerberg insisted that the decision is rooted in Facebook\u2019s commitment to free speech, and that the company wants to ensure \u201cpeople can see for themselves what politicians are saying.\u201d But that didn\u2019t appear to sway lawmakers.\n\nRep. Rashida Tlaib | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\n\u201cWhy should the very politicians who lead our country be held to a lower standard for truthfulness and decency than the average American?\u201d asked Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.).\n\nTlaib, who is a Muslim, also objected to posts showing that white supremacists have used Facebook events pages to organize armed protests of mosques. \u201cIt is hate speech. It is hate. And it\u2019s leading to violence and death threats in my office,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cWe need to be able to play a part in reducing that violence.\u201d\n\nOther lawmakers questioned Facebook\u2019s track record on civil rights. Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) pressed Zuckerberg on whether the leaders steering the Libra Association, which will manage Libra, include any people of color or members of the LGBTQ community. (Zuckerberg didn\u2019t know.)\n\nSeveral raised issues like Facebook\u2019s alleged violations of federal housing laws in the wake of accusations by the Department of Housing and Urban Development that the company has allowed marketers to exclude users by race in real estate ads, and its inability to stop Russia-backed trolls from heavily targeting African American users in their 2016 meddling campaign.\n\nRepublicans are more scattered on what they think of Facebook\n\nWhen Zuckerberg couldn\u2019t answer questions about the company\u2019s ongoing civil rights audit , Rep. Joyce Beatty (D-Ohio) scoffed. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like you think this is a joke, when you have ruined the lives of many people, discriminated against them,\u201d she said.\n\nThe hearing underscored the divide in the GOP about how to rein in Facebook, thanks to a mix of competing instincts over whether to praise the company for its business innovation or criticize it for intervening in the financial system and policing free speech.\n\nThe committee\u2019s lead Republican, North Carolina Rep. Patrick McHenry, tried to set the tone for the hearing by warning that \u201cAmerican innovation is on trial today.\u201d He also slammed California Democrat Brad Sherman for predicting that Libra could wreak even more damage than the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.\n\n\u201cI have my qualms about Facebook and Libra, I do, and the shortcomings of big tech \u2014 there are many,\u201d said McHenry, who also related an anecdote about early attempts to regulate automobiles. \u201cBut if history has taught us anything, it\u2019s better to be on the side of American innovation, competition and most importantly the freedom to build a better future for all of us.\u201d\n\nBut other committee Republicans proceeded to raise grave concerns about Libra\u2019s potential impact, pressing Zuckerberg on fears about damage to the U.S. dollar and grilling him on why Facebook was losing marquee corporate partners such as Visa and eBay that had initially signed up to back Libra.\n\nSome voiced other grievances with Facebook\u2019s influence.\n\nRep. Bill Posey (R-Fla.) put Zuckerberg on the spot about Facebook\u2019s decision to limit the reach of false claims that vaccines are dangerous, arguing that the move restricted free speech rights. Posey pressed Zuckerberg on whether Facebook could \u201csupport users\u2019 fair and open discussions and communications related to the risks as well as the benefits of vaccinations.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re making a bad mistake,\u201d Posey warned.\n\nZuckerberg was more confident; lawmakers were more hostile\n\nThe last time he testified on Capitol Hill, an apologetic Zuckerberg came under fire from lawmakers who sought to take him to task for Facebook\u2019s handling of 2016 election interference and the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal \u2014 but who were also stymied at times by confusion over the world of high technology.\n\nA year and a half later, House lawmakers on Wednesday appeared to mostly speak with a firmer grasp on tech as they aired grievances with the CEO, whose company\u2019s regulatory woes have only multiplied since April 2018. But a more confident Zuckerberg appeared better prepared to take the heat, fielding questions on everything from financial regulation to content moderation to concerns over Facebook\u2019s growing power and size.\n\nThe improved performance comes as the CEO has taken a more public role in addressing regulatory concerns about the company. Zuckerberg dialed up his direct outreach to top officials in Congress and at the White House with a series of closed-door meetings in September. He\u2019s also quietly huddled away from Washington in recent months with Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), sessions that touched on their concerns about Libra and data privacy, according to the lawmakers.\n\nEven so, Zuckerberg acknowledged Wednesday that lawmakers might still hold reservations about Facebook\u2019s latest plans on Libra, given the heavy scrutiny the company is under.\n\n\u201cI believe that this is something that needs to get built, but I get that I\u2019m not the ideal messenger for this right now,\u201d Zuckerberg said in his opening remarks. \u201cWe\u2019ve faced a lot of issues over the past few years and I\u2019m sure there are a lot of people who wish it were anyone but Facebook who were helping to propose this.\u201d\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nSome questions seemed to catch Zuckerberg more flat-footed. He said he did not know whether Facebook has ever done business with President Donald Trump\u2019s D.C. hotel, a question posed by Rep. Madeleine Dean (D-Pa.). And he had no ready answers for a series of rapid-fire questions from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), including one about a recent POLITICO story revealing that he has hosted off-the-record dinners with conservative pundits and journalists.\n\n\u201cIn your ongoing dinner parties with far-right figures, some of who advanced the conspiracy theory that white supremacy is a hoax, did you discuss so-called social media bias against conservatives and do you believe there is a bias?\u201d Ocasio-Cortez asked.\n\n\u201cCongresswoman \u2014 sorry, I don\u2019t remember everything that was in the question,\u201d Zuckerberg responded.\n\nShe said: \u201cThat\u2019s all right. I\u2019ll move on.\u201d\n\nLibra faces more alarm bells than ever\n\nThe hearing raised further doubts that Facebook and its partners would be able to launch Libra next year as planned. Opponents notched a victory when they pushed Zuckerberg to commit to walking away from the project if need be.\n\nZuckerberg attempted to put lawmakers at ease by saying he would be willing, as a member of the Libra Association, to support delaying Libra\u2019s rollout if U.S. regulators didn\u2019t approve. Zuckerberg used the hearing as an opportunity to stress a narrative that policymakers are increasingly starting to hear from Facebook \u2014 that his company can no longer speak on behalf of the group that will manage Libra because the organization is now officially established in Switzerland and 20 other partners have a say.\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s assurance wasn't enough for members such as Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Mich.), who pressed Zuckerberg on what Facebook would do if the association that will manage Libra wanted to move forward without locking down U.S. officials\u2019 approval.\n\n\"Then I believe we would be forced to leave the association,\" Zuckerberg said.\n\nThe Libra Association in recent weeks lost support from major financial institutions and technology companies that had earlier planned to join the Libra effort, including Visa, MasterCard and PayPal. Zuckerberg attributed the loss of a quarter of its tentative initial membership to the fact that Libra\u2019s a \u201crisky project\u201d under intense scrutiny.\n\nLawmakers saw the exit of Libra\u2019s early backers as another reason to question whether it should move forward. Rep. Ann Wagner (R-Mo.) said maybe the departures were a sign that \u201cthey\u2019re not so sure it\u2019s going to work, either.\u201d\n\nLawmakers were unconvinced by Zuckerberg\u2019s statement that Facebook\u2019s aim is to improve the \u201cstagnant\u201d financial system and help people without access to traditional banking. Instead, Sherman expressed outrage that \u201cthe richest man in the world\u201d \u2014 that honor in fact belongs to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, although Zuckerberg is close \u2014 would \u201ccome here and hide behind the poorest people in the world and say that\u2019s who you\u2019re really trying to help.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cYou\u2019re trying to help those for whom the dollar is not a good currency \u2014 drug dealers, terrorists, tax evaders.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS Morning Tech Technology news from Washington and Silicon Valley \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Not acting to overhaul the international payments system, he argued, would come back to bite the United States.\n\n\u201cLibra will be backed mostly by dollars and I believe it will extend America\u2019s financial leadership as well as our democratic values and oversight around the world,\u201d he said. \u201cIf America doesn\u2019t innovate, our financial leadership is not guaranteed.\"\n\nIt\u2019s an argument that didn\u2019t quite connect with lawmakers who had already been questioning why Facebook and its partners are planning to operate Libra from Geneva, rather than the United States.\n\nBut Zuckerberg warned that \u201cthe rest of the world isn\u2019t waiting\u201d and tried to focus lawmakers\u2019 attention on threats from China, which he said was moving quickly to launch similar technology in the coming months.\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s testimony echoed a common refrain from the tech industry and a new point of emphasis for Facebook: U.S. lawmakers should be more concerned about China\u2019s growing influence on the internet than of American companies\u2019 expansion efforts.\n\nThose concerns also earned a prominent mention during Zuckerberg\u2019s highly publicized speech on free expression last week in Washington, where he warned that the U.S. could lose pace with Beijing in setting global rules of the road for the internet.\n\nKaty O'Donnell contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/65/bf/151126794d5db68f5bf4ebf72b8f/191023-zuckerberg-waters-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
