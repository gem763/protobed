They should be a part of urban planning,\" Sutanudjaja told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\nResidents, many of whom have lived there for generations, have valuable knowledge of disaster preparedness, flood mitigation and other risks linked to climate change, she said.\n\n\"Kampungs are living spaces with problems with sanitation and housing that reduce their resilience, so we also don't want to romanticise them. But demolition is not an answer,\" she said.\n\nThere is also risk attached to success: George Town on Penang island, off Malaysia's west coast, is a UNESCO world heritage site that is hugely popular with tourists that many residents blame for congestion and higher rents.\n\nUnder-pressure cities need a conservation approach when modernising, which includes residents to keeps alive traditional knowledge and cultures such as foods, clothing and music, said Saswat Bandyopadhyay, an urban planning professor at CEPT University in Ahmedabad, India.\n\n\"The loss of heritage is irreversible - once it's gone, it's gone. So we must be doing everything we can to preserve it.\"\n\n(Reporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran; Editing by Michael Taylor.
