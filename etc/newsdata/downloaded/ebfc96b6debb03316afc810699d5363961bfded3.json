The onslaught comes at a crucial moment in the Democratic primary contest, as the former vice president attempts to showcase his ability to go toe-to-toe with Trump.\n\nBut with the Democratic National Committee attempting to be a more neutral arbiter than it was in 2016, when it was accused of aiding Clinton, the party helped monitor viral attacks but publicly remained silent.\n\n\u201cThis is the first big test of the 2020 race: Is the press, are Democrats, are Democratic activists, going to let that happen again?\u201d said Jennifer Palmieri, who was the Clinton campaign\u2019s director of communications.\n\nShe and other former Clinton aides have been watching with an apprehensive sense of deja vu as they see Trump solicit a foreign government\u2019s help in attacking a political adversary.\n\n\u201cYou need to be aggressive so people know what\u2019s true and what\u2019s not,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t pick your fights. \u2026 It\u2019s a terrible situation for a campaign to be in. But that\u2019s life when you\u2019re dealing with Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nBiden has been buffeted in recent weeks by a flood of claims on social media seeking to weaponize his debate misstatements and other verbal miscues. The attacks have come not just from the right, but from the left as well.\n\nThe assertion that Biden behaved corruptly when it came to Ukraine appears to be an attempt by Trump and his allies to elevate what are unsubstantiated claims into a dangerous threat to the 76-year-old\u2019s candidacy.\n\nZac Petkanas, the director of rapid response for Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign, said Democrats may have miscalculated four years ago in ignoring conspiracies that incubated on the fringes of the Internet. They quickly went mainstream, Clinton\u2019s campaign realized.\n\n\u201cThe false attacks really were effective at sowing doubt, not only within a right-wing sphere, which is what we originally thought, but within our own supporters,\u201d Petkanas said.\n\nHunter Biden served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine\u2019s largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment.\n\nHunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation. As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases. At the time, the investigation into Burisma was dormant, according to former Ukrainian and U.S. officials.\n\nTrump has suggested that Biden improperly used his influence as vice president, and the president appeared to confirm on Sunday that he raised the matter in a July phone call with newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The Washington Post Fact Checker analyzed several of the claims from Trump and his allies in May and gave them three Pinocchios.\n\nTrump took his attacks even further on Monday \u2014 without proof \u2014 after Biden told Trump to release the transcript of his calls with Ukraine.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden and his son are corrupt. All right?\u201d Trump said, as he was meeting with the Polish president at the United Nations. He added: \u201cIf that ever happened \u2014 if a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, they\u2019d be getting the electric chair by right now.\u201d\n\nWhile Clinton initially ignored escalating conspiracy theories, Biden\u2019s campaign has mobilized its research team, attempting to find ways to combat false charges and return the focus to Trump. They point to polls repeatedly showing Biden defeating Trump and say he has rattled the incumbent president.\n\n\u201cIn an outrageous and unprecedented act of corruption \u2014 and at the expense of our national security priorities \u2014 Donald Trump pressured a foreign country to smear the Democratic candidate he\u2019s most afraid of facing next November,\u201d said Andrew Bates, a Biden spokesman. \u201cThis kind of \u2018self over country\u2019 gutter politics is grossly beneath what we stand for as a country and will be aggressively fought against by the campaign. For the sake of our democracy, it is also incumbent on the press to finally internalize the lessons of 2016 and dispense with the uncritical repetition of wholesale lies simply because Donald Trump says them.\u201d\n\nBiden, at a fundraiser in Iowa on Saturday, said the president\u2019s behavior was troubling. \u201cThe more he thinks he\u2019s likely to lose, the more erratic he becomes and the more things he does that are worrisome,\u201d Biden said.\n\nOver the weekend, the Biden campaign and Trump released dueling videos on Twitter that underscored the social media imbalance Democrats are fighting.\n\nTrump\u2019s video was viewed about 2.7 million times \u2014 nearly five times more than Biden\u2019s video. George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser who was sentenced to prison last year for lying to the FBI, sent a tweet Friday night spreading another unfounded allegation against Biden \u2014 and it got more retweets than the video posted at the top of Biden\u2019s official Twitter account.\n\nOn Facebook, Trump\u2019s supporters also mobilized, amplifying unfounded rumors about the vice president and his son. Conservative social media influencers Lynnette Hardaway and Rochelle Richardson, better known as Diamond and Silk, weighed in on Friday evening, gaining thousands of shares many hours before Biden\u2019s campaign had put out anything more than a plain statement on the platform addressing Trump\u2019s phone call.\n\nTop results on Facebook included material from pro-Trump news pages, some of which are operated by users outside the United States. Among the top videos that appear on Facebook for the search \u201cBiden Ukraine\u201d is a clip from Conservative Edition News, a page with more than 1.6 million followers that links to articles from a website that runs pro-Trump articles with no bylines.\n\nThe online battles illustrate how the campaign is increasingly unfolding in an unregulated digital ecosystem, one in which Trump has eschewed traditional political norms.\n\nSocial media companies maintain that they are not arbiters of truth and intervene only when there is evidence of coordinated inauthentic activity \u2014 a position that has frustrated Democrats. Although Democrats generally have put faith in institutions \u2014 the Justice Department, the media and Congress \u2014 to check Trump\u2019s stretching presidential power, they see few avenues of recourse against the Trump fusillade, even as House Democrats debate whether to begin impeachment proceedings.\n\n\u201cRegardless of who our nominee is, I think we\u2019re going to face similar unconventional actions by the president, and so this is something that should concern the DNC,\u201d Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.) said Saturday as he trailed Biden into the grounds of the Polk County Steak Fry in Des Moines. \u201cI don\u2019t have a concrete idea off the top of my head.\u201d\n\nThe party \u201cought to take every possible responsible action,\u201d Coons said, citing a filing with the Federal Election Commission. But that would probably be futile, he admitted, because the body lacks a quorum.\n\nBrian Fallon, the chief spokesman for Clinton\u2019s campaign, said arguing with Trump on merits was hardly ever successful and said he believes the best option Democrats have is putting Trump on the daily defensive with impeachment proceedings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a nasty mess. You heard that about emails,\u201d Fallon said. \u201cIn the end, people thought it was a mountain being made of a molehill. But then they\u2019d invariably blame Hillary for setting up the server in the first place. They\u2019d blame her a little bit even though they thought Trump was being unfair.\u201d\n\nBiden in June issued a promise not to use false or purloined information and called on other candidates to do the same. But the party has not acted on a resolution that would bind all its candidates to similar norms, even though the pledge was endorsed earlier this year by state party chairs.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers have been quick to condemn the president, but they strained to formulate a way for the party to respond collectively to Trump\u2019s claims. From staunch Biden allies to rivals for the Democratic nomination, there wasn\u2019t a clear sense of how to maneuver tactically to quiet Trump\u2019s megaphone or come up with a counternarrative.\n\nSen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) said the president\u2019s alleged phone call was \u201cjust another on the list of issues\u201d that warrant his impeachment.\n\nWhen asked in an interview what other Democratic candidates could do to present a united front, she said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell other candidates what to do.\u201d\n\nDavid Weigel in Nevada, Iowa, contributed to this report.", "description": "The former vice president\u2019s campaign has been more aggressive in countering Trump\u2019s falsehoods than Hillary Clinton was in 2016, mindful of the damage those attacks had on her campaign.", "authors": ["Matt Viser", "National Political Reporter", "Isaac Stanley-Becker"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KKEO2RW6FQI6TPUWNLNYDAQ6SA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
