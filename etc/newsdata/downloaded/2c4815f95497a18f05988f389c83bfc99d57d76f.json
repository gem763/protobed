Elizabeth Warren\u2019s Cherokee ancestry claims and other controversies, calling its removal a mistake.\n\n\u201cThis Page was mistakenly removed and has been restored,\u201d said Facebook spokesperson Joe Osborne in an email.\n\nThe page, Elizabeth Warren Wiki, was shut down for violating rules against impersonation, a decision appealed by the manager, Cornell Law School professor William A. Jacobson.\n\nHe noted that the page states, \u201cWe are NOT affiliated with Elizabeth Warren\u2019s Senate office or any of her campaigns.\u201d\n\nFacebook offered no explanation for the removal, but Mr. Jacobson speculated that Warren supporters may have complained after the page was cited by backers of Sen. Bernie Sanders, a 2020 Democratic presidential primary rival.\n\nThe page comes as a companion to the site ElizabethWarrenWiki.org, billed as \u201cthe most comprehensive source of information and documentation with regard to Elizabeth A. Warren.\u201d\n\nThe Massachusetts Democrat has climbed steadily in the polls, overtaking Mr. Sanders and challenging the front-runner, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, in some surveys.\n\nFacebook shuts down professor\u2019s page debunking Warren\u2019s Native American ancestry claims - https://t.co/80uSVuyEK7 \u2014 Legal Insurrection (@LegInsurrection) October 1, 2019\n\nBoth the Washington Times and Fox News reached out to Facebook for comment, which he said \u201clikely was a big factor in the page being restored.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo the page is back,\u201d said Mr. Jacobson on his Legal Insurrection site, \u201cbut the risk of shutdown by big tech remains.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
