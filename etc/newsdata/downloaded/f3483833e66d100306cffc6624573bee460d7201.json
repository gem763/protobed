A rule change would need to ensure foreign companies were not automatically considered resident here.\n\n\"We have part 4A, introduced in the early 1980s, and also the diverted profits tax and the multinational anti-avoidance laws,\" he said.\n\n\"We have a plethora of rules, along with the baseline source rule which says if you're making profits in Australia and they're sourced here, they're also taxed here.\n\n\"You don't need to worry about having an extra residency test overlayed on companies that are not incorporated here.\"\n\nTransitional mechanisms for any legislative changes would also be needed.
