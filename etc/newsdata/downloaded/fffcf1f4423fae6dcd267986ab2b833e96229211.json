But I respect him very much,\" Schwarzenegger told Entertainment Tonight. \"I think he's a very dedicated actor and he trains really hard, he's in good shape physically, and he's talented.\"\n\n\"But besides all of that, he's great with my daughter,\" he added, \"and that's the most important part.\"\n\n'TERMINATOR' STAR LINDA HAMILTON DISCUSSES HER 35-YEAR RELATIONSHIP WITH ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER\n\nSchwarzenneger\u2019s daughter Katherine, 29, tied the knot with Pratt in June after dating the actor for a year. Still, the \u201cJingle All the Way\u201d star said he was impressed with the man Pratt, 40, showed himself to be.\n\n\"He's just a nice man. It's always great when someone is successful and someone has a vision and someone is driven and knows where to go in their life. But if you're not kind and if you're not a real mensch, you know, then you don't have much,\" Schwarzenegger said of his daughter\u2019s husband. \"He is a real kind person, and he's terrific with her.\"\n\nIn discussing his latest installment in the \u201cTerminator\u201d franchise, which is said to be sequel to the 1991 classic \u201cTerminator 2: Judgment Day,\u201d despite the number of other series releases in years past, Schwarzenegger said returning to the franchise was a no-brainer in large part because of James Cameron\u2019s involvement in spearheading the first two adaptations.\n\n\"[James] Cameron told me the story after a motorcycle ride and I immediately said to him, 'I'm in. This is fantastic,'\" Schwarzenegger said. \"Especially after he told me he wanted to bring back Linda Hamilton. I couldn't wait to work with her again.\"\n\nARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER BEANS AS SON JOSEPH BAENA GRADUATES FROM COLLEGE\n\nHowever, Cameron had to do a little bit of convincing to Hamilton in order for the Emmy-nominated actress to jump at the idea. Hamilton said she felt a bit of incongruity reprising her heroine role of Sarah Connor simply because of her absence for so many years.\n\n\"It took a little work on their part to bring me back,\" Hamilton admitted. \"Because I just was not really sure that I had anything more to say. It's been 28 years, and I'm like, 'Are you putting me in a wheelchair or what?' Because it was just so far-fetched to come back all these years later.\"\n\n\"But after careful consideration, and a vague outline of the story, [I began] thinking, 'I've got 28 years to fill in with character and make these decisions and then bring them to the sound stage,'\" Hamilton explained. \"And I went for it.\"\n\n\u201cTerminator: Dark Fate\u201d will see Cameron make his return to the franchise for the first time since the second film, \u201cJudgment Day,\u201d though instead of being at the directing helm -- that role was reserved for \u201cDeadpool\u201d director Tim Miller -- Cameron serves as a producer and creative consultant on the project.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"With a great director, you have a chance to really be successful. If you don't have a great director, then your chances are very slim,\" Schwarzenegger offered about the filmmakers. \"And this time, with Tim Miller, a great director, to actually execute the vision of Jim Cameron \u2013 a great director and creator \u2013 we felt very comfortable with that package.\"\n\n\u201cTerminator: Dark Fate\u201d is slated to premiere in theaters on Nov. 1.", "description": "Arnold Schwarzenegger is giving credit where its due.", "authors": ["Julius Young", "Julius Is An La Entertainment Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/01/chris-pratt-arnold-SCHWARZENEGGER-AP.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
