Enterprises that wanted to use it, however, had to either work with third parties or do it themselves. To help these companies \u2014 and capture some of this lucrative market itself \u2014 Google is launching TensorFlow Enterprise, which includes hands-on, enterprise-grade support and optimized managed services on Google Cloud.\n\nOne of the most important features of TensorFlow Enterprise is that it will offer long-term support. For some versions of the framework, Google will offer patches for up to three years. For what looks to be an additional fee, Google will also offer to companies that are building AI models engineering assistance from its Google Cloud and TensorFlow teams.\n\nAll of this, of course, is deeply integrated with Google\u2019s own cloud services. \u201cBecause Google created and open-sourced TensorFlow, Google Cloud is uniquely positioned to offer support and insights directly from the TensorFlow team itself,\u201d the company writes in today\u2019s announcement. \u201cCombined with our deep expertise in AI and machine learning, this makes TensorFlow Enterprise the best way to run TensorFlow.\u201d\n\nGoogle also includes Deep Learning VMs and Deep Learning Containers to make getting started with TensorFlow easier, and the company has optimized the enterprise version for Nvidia GPUs and Google\u2019s own Cloud TPUs.\n\nToday\u2019s launch is yet another example of Google Cloud\u2019s focus on enterprises, a move the company accelerated when it hired Thomas Kurian to run the Cloud businesses. After years of mostly ignoring the enterprise, the company is now clearly looking at what enterprises are struggling with and how it can adapt its products for them.", "description": "Google open-sourced its TensorFlow machine learning framework back in 2015 and it quickly became one of the most popular platforms of its kind.
