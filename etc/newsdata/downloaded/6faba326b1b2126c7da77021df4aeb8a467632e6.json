The author, Kimberly Adams, is the owner of the Northern Colorado Moms Blog Facebook page where the post originated.\n\n\"The rough season I alluded to in the post includes my being a newly single-mom who is going through divorce,\" Adams told \"Good Morning America.\" \"I certainly didn't sign up to be a part-time mom, so the days I don't have my son are really difficult for me. This was one of those days. I shared that fact with some of my closest friends, and my phone rang almost instantly. The post itself was born out of the love I felt from the way my friends showed up for me, and not just on that day, but the way they have shown up for me over and over again in this difficult season.\"\n\n(More: Dad pens viral post to former 'childless self')\n\nThe feedback on the post, has been \"a really beautiful thing to witness,\" she said. Women are tagging friends thanking them for being an \"on the way\" friend. Others are commenting with their sadness for not being able to identify those people in their lives.

Whether a text checking-in, a Facetime call, or literally telling someone 'I'm on my way,\" and driving over to their house, we could do a lot more showing up for one another.\"", "description": "Adult friendship can be complicated: life is busy, and too often we try to pretend everything is OK when it isn't.
