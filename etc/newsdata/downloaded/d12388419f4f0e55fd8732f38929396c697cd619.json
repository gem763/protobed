This comprised 79,600 deliveries for Tesla\u2019s biggest-selling Model 3 sedans, as well as 17,400 combined deliveries for Tesla\u2019s Model S and Model X SUVs. That compares to 87,048 Tesla produced in the second quarter.\n\nAhead of results, Wall Street analysts were largely anticipating between 95,000 to 100,000 deliveries for the quarter.\n\nShares of Tesla fell more than 5% after hours as of 4:56 p.m. ET, reflecting investors\u2019 disappointment that production failed to clear the top range of estimates.\n\nAhead of official results, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in a company-wide email that the company had \u201ca shot\u201d at delivering more than 100,000 vehicles during the quarter, Electrek first reported last week. The publication had also reported that Tesla was allowing its sales team to offer discounts and other incentives like free Supercharging to help boost deliveries through the end of the quarter.\n\nTesla reported third-quarter delivery results ahead of earnings later this month.

But the company posted a much wider-than-expected loss over the same period, with its net loss attributable to common stockholders totaling $408 million.\n\nAt the time, Musk said he expected Tesla would only break-even for the third-quarter, pivoting to focus on \u201ccontinuous volume growth, capacity expansion and cash generation\u201d as a primary aim. Earlier in the year, Musk had anticipated that the company would be profitable in \u201call quarters going forward.\u201d\n\nMusk in July had also reiterated guidance for total deliveries to come in between 360,000 and 400,000 for the full fiscal year \u2013 a level which has come closer within reach after the solid third-quarter results.\n\n\u201cWe continue to believe the biggest overhang around the story is Tesla's ability to hit its overall unit guidance for 2019 of 360k to 400k units with a strong 2H as this will be the telling tale of demand trends as Tesla is now a \u2018demand story\u2019 rather than a production story,\u201d Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note last week. \u201cHitting the 360k-400k unit demand guidance for 2019 is going to be a Herculean-like task in our opinion as ~345k-350k is likely the line in the sand as Street whisper numbers have continued to come down over the past few months.\u201d\n\nTesla\u2019s deliveries have resurged over the course of 2019 after a rocky start. The company handed over a disappointing 63,000 vehicles the first three months of the year amid struggles to get cars overseas to Europe and China.\n\nIn the months since, Tesla has grown to become a leader in the European electric-vehicle market, with tax incentives in some countries helping to propel demand. In the Netherlands, Tesla units sold grew nearly 400% from August to more than 5,700 in September, Bloomberg reported Tuesday, citing Bovag data. And Tesla\u2019s Model 3 was Western Europe\u2019s most registered battery-electric car in the first five months of the year, according to auto market intelligence consultant Matthias Schmidt, topping competitors including the Renault Zoe, Nissan Leaf and BMW i3.\n\nAt least one analyst pointed to similarly strong growth in Tesla\u2019s sales in China. Citing insurance registration data, Piper Jaffray analyst Alexander Potter estimated in a note last week that Tesla\u2019s 3Q deliveries rose 175% in China over the year prior. And more favorable policies could help support future sales in the region, where Tesla is also building out its Shanghai Gigafactory: In late August, China unexpectedly said it would exempt Tesla\u2019s electric vehicles from the country\u2019s purchase tax, amid a phase-out in China\u2019s electric-vehicle subsidies that had been expected to crimp auto sales for Tesla and its overseas competitors.\n\nTesla is expected to report fiscal-third quarter earnings results on October 30.\n\n\u2014\n\nEmily McCormick is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.
