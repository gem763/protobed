Desperate to get skeptical voters on board and protect vulnerable Democrats in swing districts, Hollywood leftists are joining what has been dubbed the \u201cImpeachment Task Force\u201d in order to push left-wing talking points.\n\nDemocratic Coalition co-founder Scott Dworkin told Newsweek that the \u201ctask force\u201d plans to have 100 celebrities and \u201c1,000 other members,\u201d who will blast common impeachment talking points on social media. Celebrity recruits include numerous anti-Trumpers like George Takei, Alyssa Milano, Ron Pearlman, Debra Messing, and Rosie O\u2019Donnell, Dworkin confirmed.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s propaganda machine is going to be in overdrive for the foreseeable future, so we need to be fighting every day, in every way,\u201d Dworkin said, according to Newsweek:\n\nDworkin noted that many of the recruits openly express their anti-Trump sentiments on Twitter. He believes their massive social media influence will make the message unavoidable.\n\n\u201cA lot of these celebs have been attacked by Trump people or even by Trump personally, so he will be paying attention,\u201d Dworkin said:\n\nImpeachment this asshole now. This is indefensible. https://t.co/N0UYsL60VA \u2014 Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) August 29, 2019\n\nthe big lie is donald trump #ImpeachmentNow \u2014 ROSIE (@Rosie) October 2, 2019\n\n\ud83d\udea8FORMAL IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY HAPPENING!!! \ud83d\udea8FORMAL IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY HAPPENING! \ud83d\udea8FORMAL IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY HAPPENING!\n\nhttps://t.co/2DhtEdLGIn \u2014 Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) September 24, 2019\n\n\"Why All The Arguments Against Impeachment Are BS\" \u2013@mehdirhasan pic.twitter.com/CaJmL2s829 \u2014 Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) May 31, 2019\n\n1) You need to calm down. 2) The country doesn\u2019t need the whistleblower to know what you\u2019ve done. That\u2019s just the person who raised the alarm. 3) Pack your bags. We\u2019re throwing you out, whether by impeachment or by vote. https://t.co/oQq2Z4QO3F \u2014 George Takei (@GeorgeTakei) October 4, 2019\n\nHollywood\u2019s impeachment messaging effort follows the same line of thinking as the House Democrats\u2019, who discussed a similar strategy during a private conference call last weekend. Democrats agreed upon a handful of keywords and phrases in an effort to gain the general public\u2019s support on impeachment. The keywords and phrases include \u201cbetrayal,\u201d \u201cabuse of power,\u201d and \u201cnational security.\u201d", "description": "A slew of left-wing Hollywood actors -- including Alyssa Milano and Debra Messing -- have joined forces with the\u00a0Democratic Coalition's \"Impeachment Task Force.\"", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/06/AlyssaMilanomap2-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
