It is fairly clear why. He has apparently been directing the probe his boss, President Trump, has been demanding for years: one designed to show that the FBI investigation into Trump\u2019s secretive and compromising relations with Russia was itself a crime.\n\nSeveral newspaper reports have turned up details of Barr\u2019s involvement. He has met with officials in Australia, the United Kingdom, and Italy. In theory, there\u2019s nothing wrong with cross-checking the FBI\u2019s work to make sure it handled its investigation of Trump correctly. But everything about this investigation suggests Barr is carrying out a political vendetta at Trump\u2019s orders to intimidate bureaucrats who would defy the authoritarian and lawless president.\n\nBarr has been prejudging the Mueller investigation in public since before Trump appointed him. In 2017, he said Mueller\u2019s investigation of obstruction of justice risked \u201ctaking on the look of an entirely political operation to overthrow the president.\u201d Last April, he accused the FBI of \u201cspying\u201d on Trump, again opining without evidence that the bureau had treated the president very unfairly. (\u201cI think there was a failure among a group of leaders [at the FBI] at the upper echelon.\u201d)\n\nHe has repeatedly cast the FBI investigation as a coup attempt. \u201cRepublics have fallen because of Praetorian Guard mentality where government officials get very arrogant, they identify the national interest with their own political preferences, and they feel that anyone who has a different opinion, you know, is somehow an enemy of the state,\u201d he said in one especially wild interview. \u201cAnd you know, there is that tendency that they know better and that, you know, they\u2019re there to protect as guardians of the people. That can easily translate into essentially supervening the will of the majority and getting your own way as a government official.\u201d This is exactly Trump\u2019s \u201cDeep State\u201d theory, albeit employing more multisyllabic terms: An evil cabal of bureaucrats has decided to overturn the will of the people by trying to overturn the 2016 election.\n\nAnother sign is that Trump\u2019s loyalists have expressed almost uncontainable excitement about Barr\u2019s work. In April, Trump excitedly told Sean Hannity that Barr was investigating \u201cbig\u201d and \u201cincredible\u201d evidence that Ukraine had secretly colluded with the Hillary Clinton campaign to plant evidence against Trump.\n\nThe right-wing legal community has been vibrating with excitement at what Barr is producing. Conservative columnist and movement apparatchik Hugh Hewitt gleefully predicts Barr will give \u201cshock therapy\u201d to Democrats. \u201cA Justice Department inspector-general report into surveillance of American citizens based on the Steele dossier is coming,\u201d he notes. \u201cIf indictments are warranted, U.S. Attorney John Durham will be bringing them. And a deep dive into Ukrainian natural-gas company Burisma and its well-connected board member named Biden, is imminent.\u201d Former George W. Bush attorney general Michael Mukasey, after, of course, insisting in the Wall Street Journal editorial page on Trump\u2019s innocence, pivots to Barr\u2019s counter-investigation. Mukasey lets on that one of Barr\u2019s investigators will soon \u201cdetermine whether highly specific criminal laws were violated, and if so by whom\u201d \u2014 i.e., the perpetrators are not Trump or his loyalists but the people who investigated him. The fact that Republicans have such specific and wildly positive expectations for Barr\u2019s probe is a foreboding sign.\n\nBarr\u2019s counter-investigation is not the same thing as Trump\u2019s attempts to pressure Ukraine to smear Biden. It is not improper on its face; in theory, Barr might be double-checking everything in a completely aboveboard fashion. But there is little reason to believe Barr is acting fairly at all and a great deal of reason to suspect he is carrying out his duties as hatchet man for his authoritarian boss.", "description": "Attorney General William Barr has met with officials in Australia, the United Kingdom, and Italy as part of the counter-investigation of the FBI that President Trump has been demanding.
