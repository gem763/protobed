It would be a very ugly scene for baseball, a very ugly seen for the Yankees, if one of our guys was hit by something from the upper deck. Something tragic could happen and nobody wants that.\u201d\n\nA warning message was shown on large center-field video board before the game: \u201cPlease be advised that it is illegal to throw any substance or object in the stadium. Violators face ejection and a permanent ban from Yankee Stadium, as well as criminal and civil penalties.\u201d\n\nNew York fans erupted after a replay review changed Edwin Encarnaci\u00f3n\u2019s infield hit leading off the eighth to a groundout. Houston went on to win 4-1 and take a 2-1 lead in the best-of-seven series.\n\n\u201cI went out on the field the other day I wanted the umpires to know that it was becoming a dangerous situation,\u201d Hinch said Thursday before game 4. \u201cOur guys have reported both in the bullpen and in the outfield, you could see the stuff thrown on the field. There\u2019s no place for that. Both teams will agree. And it\u2019s really hard to stop fans from doing that. But it\u2019s also very dangerous. MLB is aware. We\u2019re aware.\u201d\n\nReddick homered off Luis Severino in the second inning for a 2-0 lead. Fans directed insults at him when he went to right\n\n\u201cYou throw a baseball hard enough and hit somebody in the head when they\u2019re not looking, it could do some damage to the player, so it\u2019s definitely disrespectful and at the same time very unsafe,\u201d Reddick said after the game.\n\nHe also said he was subject to verbal abuse.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of all kinds of different things here, but you\u2019re used to that for nine innings. Pretty standard,\u201d Reddick said. \u201cThey\u2019re all yelling at the same time, so it all kind of mumbles together.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Astros manager AJ Hinch says he will remove his team from the field if fans at Yankee Stadium again throw objects at Houston players.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/17/368a9f_alcs-yankees-astros-baseball-81789-houston-astros-manager-aj-hinch-watches-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
