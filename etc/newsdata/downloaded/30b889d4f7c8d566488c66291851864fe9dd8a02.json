REUTERS/Edgar Su\n\nNew Zealand, like the United Kingdom and Norway, is one of the few countries where police do not carry guns while on general duty. However, hand guns, rifles and tasers are kept in their vehicles and can be used with a supervisor\u2019s permission.\n\nSerious crime is relatively unusual in New Zealand, although frontline police were armed for several weeks following the massacre by a suspected white supremacist at two mosques in Christchurch on March 15.\n\nThe attack sparked a debate on whether all police should carry fire arms.\n\n\u201cFollowing the events of March 15 in Christchurch, our operating environment has changed,\u201d Police Commissioner Mike Bush said in a statement on Friday.\n\n\u201cPolice must ensure our people are equipped and enabled to perform their roles safely and to ensure our communities are, and feel, safe. This means having the right people with the right tools, skills and knowledge ready to respond at all times,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Armed Response Teams will be rolled out in Manukau county in Auckland, New Zealand\u2019s largest city, and Waikato and Canterbury on Oct. 28 on a six-month trial.\n\nThey will be routinely armed, equipped, mobile and ready to support frontline police officers at incidents that require enhanced tactical capabilities, Bush said.\n\nHe said there was no immediate threat.\n\nAustralian national Brenton Tarrant has been charged over the attack in Christchurch, New Zealand\u2019s worst peace-time shooting. Tarrant has pleaded not guilty to 92 charges against him and faces trial in May.\n\nThreat levels have been heightened around the country since the Christchurch attack and 1,400 firearms have been seized from offenders since March.\n\nPolice Minister Stuart Nash said the move did not mean that police would be armed routinely.\n\n\u201cThe three areas have been selected for the trial because of the incidence of crimes involving armed offenders,\u201d Nash said.\n\n\u201cPolice turn up to some callouts with no knowledge of what they are walking into. Every month police turn up to 200 incidents where a firearm is involved,\u201d he said.\n\nNew Zealanders must have a gun licence to own a firearm. There are an estimated 1.5 million guns in the country.\n\nThe government banned military-style semi-automatic and other high-calibre guns within weeks of the Christchurch shooting and also introduced a gun amnesty scheme. More than 29,000 firearms have been collected so far, according to statistics provided on the police website.", "description": "New Zealand officials said on Friday armed police will patrol parts of the country in a trial project following heightened security concerns after a mass shooting in Christchurch in March that killed 51 people.", "authors": ["Praveen Menon", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442082261&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H003", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
