I guess I\u2019ll put lipstick on today.\u2019 \u201d (When it comes to dating apps, both Piotr and Claire told me they prefer Hinge and specifically cited the app\u2019s system of prompts. Take note, digital daters.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnyway, unlike Claire, Piotr said he\u2019s always nervous before a date \u2014 so much so, in fact, that he typically takes a shot of whiskey to steel himself before heading out. \u201cIt\u2019s scary putting yourself out there and being judged by someone,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s nerve-racking.\u201d\n\nThis time around, Piotr was worried that the restaurant where he and Claire were to meet was so far from his job that he wouldn\u2019t be able to get there in time and decided to work from home that day. He ended up getting to Leziz Cafe and Restaurant in Dupont Circle in plenty of time and chose to sit on a bench outside so as not to be \u201ctoo early.\u201d\n\nThe good news is that Claire said Piotr did not seem at all anxious when he walked in to meet her. (She was early, too.) \u201cIf he was nervous,\u201d she told me, \u201che hid it well.\u201d Ironically, Piotr told me that he thought Claire seemed nervous, and that was a good thing. \u201cIt made me calm down a bit realizing she was in the same boat.\u201d Alas, I\u2019ve been writing this column long enough to know that the thing that most relaxes people on these dates is when they realize they have nothing to lose \u2014 in other words, they\u2019re not particularly attracted to the person sitting across from them. Asked about his first impression of Claire, Piotr offered this halfhearted observation: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I immediately fell in love with her. There was nothing wrong with her.\u201d \u201cHe was pretty cute,\u201d Claire told me. \u201cMaybe a little younger than I usually go for.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThey drank beers and pushed through what Piotr terms \u201ctypical getting-to-know-you conversation.\u201d They talked about family, school, their careers. He ordered the salmon, Claire got the rib-eye, and they shared a cheese plate. She said the conversation moved along pretty well. \u201cHe seemed genuinely interested in what I had to say.\u201d But she felt like she\u2019d done most of the talking. \u201cHe was pretty quiet.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love learning about people who are willing to share,\u201d Piotr told me \u2014 but added that he prefers not having to talk about himself.\n\nThings picked up when Claire mentioned that she\u2019d been reading \u201cThe Name of the Wind,\u201d a fantasy novel from \u201cThe Kingkiller Chronicle\u201d series by Patrick Rothfuss. Piotr is, as he puts it, \u201ca huge fantasy nerd.\u201d \u201cHe was very excited to talk about that,\u201d said Claire. He taught her how to pronounce the name of the novel\u2019s main character, Kvothe. (It\u2019s Ka-voth-ee.) Piotr loosened up considerably on the topic of fantasy fiction. \u201cProbably too much for a first date,\u201d he later told me. He needn\u2019t have been concerned; a self-proclaimed nerd herself, Claire described him as \u201cjust the right amount of nerd.\u201d \u201cWe had a lot in common,\u201d she said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe conversation was good,\u201d Piotr said. \u201cBut it was all on a friendly level. There was no romantic spark. I\u2019ve gone on dates before where ... I\u2019m sad that I\u2019m walking away, like, \u2018I wish this date wasn\u2019t over.\u2019 \u201d After a couple of hours, Piotr apologized for having to leave so soon \u2014 he had another appointment \u2014 and they left the restaurant together. They walked for a bit, hugged and then went their separate ways without exchanging contact information. \u201cProbably not the best move on my part,\u201d Piotr said, \u201cbut I wasn\u2019t thinking about it.\u201d\n\nClaire told me she didn\u2019t feel much of an attraction either, but \u201cI would have maybe gone out with him again if he had asked.\u201d In the end, she considers the date a success because \u201cI got to talk about books I like.\u201d\n\nRate the date\n\nClaire: 4 [out of 5]. \u201cHe didn\u2019t do anything wrong. It just didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nPiotr: 5. \u201cI loved getting to know Claire. As opposed to not going on a date, it was great.\u201d\n\nUpdate\n\nNo further contact.\n\nAD", "description": "She said he was \u201cjust the right amount of nerd.\u201d", "authors": ["Neil Drumming"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/MPHegvRRFD5fB-gB62sXl7X3ry8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RMUHSNW2FQI6TLDDGALHCFKD7Y.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
