However, the single most important part of Johnson\u2019s plan for the UK remains totally unresolved.\n\nThe Queen is expected to say that her government\u2019s first priority is to get Brexit done by passing the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill. The problem for Johnson is that the Withdrawal Agreement part of this bill doesn\u2019t currently exist in any meaningful way.\n\nIt\u2019s being negotiated in Brussels with EU officials and Johnson has very little control over where this negotiation ends up. His hope is that an agreement can be reached on Wednesday, before EU leaders meet on Thursday to agree it, meaning Johnson can bring a deal back to London.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of road to travel before Wednesday. And even if Johnson does get a deal from Brussels, getting it through Parliament will be no walk in the park.\n\nShould he fail on all fronts, then he will have to decide whether or not to break the law. Opposition lawmakers recently passed legislation stating that if no deal is in place by 11 p.m. on Saturday night, then Johnson must request a further Brexit delay.\n\nIt\u2019s all a bit of a mess and international observers would be forgiven for asking why, exactly, Johnson is making the Queen read out ambitious spending pledges on things like healthcare, cracking down on crime and pumping money into schools.\n\nVirtually everyone in the UK thinks that there is going to be an election sooner rather than later. So, this Queen\u2019s speech isn\u2019t designed to pass lawmakers in parliament; its purpose is to advertise Johnson and his government to the country at large.\n\nPolitics has become something of a game of chess at one of the most critical moments of the UK\u2019s history. Today, Boris Johnson will use the Queen to make his opening move.", "description": "View the latest news and breaking news today for U.S., world, weather, entertainment, politics and health at CNN.com.", "authors": ["Analysis Luke Mcgee In Westminster", "Cnn'S Duarte Mendonca", "Cnn'S Bianca Britton", "Cnn'S Sarah Dean", "James Frater"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191011135547-01-queens-speech-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
