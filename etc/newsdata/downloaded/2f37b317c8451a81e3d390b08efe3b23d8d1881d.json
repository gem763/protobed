I think it\u2019s bad for the UK, bad for the EU and bad for Europe, and a colossal mistake.\u201d\n\nHe added in comments reported by the Evening Standard: \u201cYoung people prefer cooperation to separation\u2026 In the end, the young are going to win because they will be here and the elderly won\u2019t.\n\n\u201cOne day, I confidently predict, the young ones will reenter the EU or form a new alliance with them.\u201d\n\nMr Major is not the first to suggest that older voters had stolen young people\u2019s futures by voting for Brexit. Others have said that a second referendum should be held once the older generation had died off, or that the voting franchise should be denied of senior citizens entirely.\n\nRemainers Hope Older Brexit Voters Dying Will Tilt EU Referendum Re-run https://t.co/tt1LhNBMTc \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 18, 2019\n\nWithin days of the June 2016 vote, articles published in the left-wing media like the Huffington Post and The Independent claimed that older voters had \u201cscrewed over\u201d the young while GQ Magazine ran with the headline: \u201cWe Should Ban Old People from Voting.\u201d\n\nProminent figures in the British media establishment also celebrated the prospect of the old dying to usher in a new Europhile age in Britain. Gary Lineker, former football player and spokesman for crisps brand Walkers, \u2018joked\u2019 in December 2016 that by the time the UK leaves the EU, \u201cmost the people who voted for it will be dead\u201d.\n\nIn May 2017, author Ian McEwan said that there should be another referendum in 2019 when senior voters are \u201cin their graves\u201d.\n\n\u201cBy 2019 the country could be in a receptive mood: 2.5 million over-18-year-olds, freshly franchised and mostly remainers; 1.5 million oldsters, mostly Brexiters, freshly in their graves,\u201d the then-69-year-old had said.\n\nWhile Polly Toynbee, a columnist at the left-liberal Guardian, celebrated \u201cSwing Saturday\u201d in January 2019 \u2014 marking the day when \u201cthe country turns Remain\u201d.\n\n\u201cEnough old Leavers will have died, and enough young Remainers will have come on to the electoral register to turn the dial on what the country thinks about Brexit,\u201d the 72-year-old had said.\n\nEurophile Journo: \u2018Bad Winter\u2019 Will Kill Older Leave Voters, Grandchildren Will \u2018Spit on Their Graves\u2019 https://t.co/DYczQZ1VTU \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 13, 2017\n\nMajor is a vocal critic of Brexit and joined the recent legal challenge to cancel Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s prorogation of parliament, claiming it was a political move to stop Remainers finding ways to stop the UK leaving the EU. The Supreme Court ruled last month that the suspension of parliament was unlawful and MPs returned to the Commons.\n\nFormer Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith effectively called Major a hypocrite for opposing Johnson\u2019s prorogation of parliament when he suspended the House during a scandal in 1997.\n\nMr Duncan-Smith said in September: \u201cSo the words \u2018pot\u2019 and \u2018kettle\u2019 do come to mind rather significantly here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do recall that this is the same man suddenly prorogued Parliament in the height of the \u2018cash-of-questions\u2019 report and he was highly criticised at the time, but he still went ahead,\u201d he added.", "description": "John Major has told young people that Brexit was a \"colossal mistake\" and that he hopes one day they will force the UK to rejoin the EU.", "authors": ["Victoria Friedman"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Young-Remainers-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
