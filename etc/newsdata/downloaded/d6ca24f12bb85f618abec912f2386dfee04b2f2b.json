Now they\u2019ll debate together for the first time.", "url": "https://politico.com/story/2019/08/29/biden-warren-debate-2020-1477959", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-08-29", "downloaded_at": "2019-09-02 07:06:33.309387+00:00", "text": "\u201cTheir experiences, their attitudes are very different,\u201d said Mike Lux, who served as national deputy political director on Biden\u2019s 1988 presidential campaign and later worked with Warren. \u201cElizabeth came up through the progressive movement ranks, and Biden came to town a long time ago and is very much a part of the old school in the Senate.\u201d\n\nTheir differences go beyond the fight over the bankruptcy bill. In 2016, Warren was one of a handful of senators who voted against a health care bill that included funding for a cancer \u201cmoonshot\u201d initiative named for Biden\u2019s son, Beau, who died of brain cancer in 2015. Biden called a vote to move forward with the bill over which he presided \u201cmaybe one of the most important moments in my career.\u201d\n\nDespite their history, Biden\u2019s campaign played down expectations for a potential clash with Warren.\n\n\u201cAs Joe Biden said himself, he has deep respect for Elizabeth Warren,\u201d Andrew Bates, a Biden campaign spokesman, said in a statement to POLITICO. \u201cHis campaign is not focused on running against any of the other candidates, but on making the case that he has an unparalleled record of delivering progressive change and that he is the best person to defeat Donald Trump and the atrocious values he represents.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s campaign declined to comment.\n\nBut the two candidates have subtly jabbed each other in recent days. Biden\u2019s campaign implicitly criticized Warren for not attracting as much support from voters of color, while Warren last week chastised Democrats who want to \u201cjust turn back the clock\u201d and \u201cmake change incrementally.\u201d\n\nThey also have sharp differences on policy issues. Warren backs Bernie Sanders\u2019 \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d proposal while Biden has called for adding a public option to Obamacare \u2014 an issue that\u2019s likely to come up on the debate stage. Warren has also called for breaking up Facebook and other big tech companies, which Biden hasn\u2019t embraced, and for repealing most of the 1994 crime bill, which Biden helped write.\n\nWarren has described the fight over the bankruptcy bill as a formative political experience.\n\nMelissa Jacoby, a University of North Carolina law professor who served with Warren on the National Bankruptcy Review Commission in the 1990s, said Biden\u2019s \u201cneed to protect his corporate constituency may have been blocking his ability to hear the reality of the situation.\u201d\n\nBiden has defended his vote for the bill, which passed in 2005, as a way to secure consumer protections in a bill that was likely to pass the Republican-controlled Congress, anyway.\n\nBut he doesn\u2019t appear to have held a grudge against Warren over her criticisms of him.\n\nThe next time they saw each other, Biden \u201cheld out his arms and shouted from halfway across the room, \u2018Professor! Come here and give me a hug!\u2019\u201d Warren recalled on the Senate floor in 2016.\n\n\u201cHe had not forgotten our earlier battle, but he made it clear that he continued to think and rethink issues about working families and that, even when we disagreed, we could respect \u2014 and even like \u2014 each other,\u201d she said, adding that Biden had \u201cprovided encouragement, wisdom and good counsel time and again.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Warren told him at the time that she thought his past positions on issues like bankruptcy would make it harder to run to Hillary Clinton's left in the primary.\n\nWarren and Biden found themselves at odds again in the final days of the Obama administration, as Biden worked to steer a health care bill called the 21st Century Cures Act through Congress. Warren decried the bill as full of too many giveaways to the pharmaceutical industry.\n\n\u201cWhen American voters say Congress is owned by big companies, this bill is exactly what they are talking about,\u201d she said in a speech on the Senate floor.\n\nShe accused Republicans of holding funding for the opioid crisis and Biden\u2019s cancer moonshot initiative \u201chostage unless everyone agrees to special favors for campaign donors and giveaways to the richest drug companies in the world.\u201d She was one of only five senators to vote against the bill, along with Sens. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Sanders.\n\nWhile it\u2019s unclear whether Warren will go after Biden on the debate stage, she\u2019s hinted on the campaign trail that she\u2019s not afraid to talk about their old disagreements.\n\n\u201cAt a time when the biggest financial institutions in this country were trying to put the squeeze on millions of hardworking families who were in bankruptcy because of medical problems, job losses, divorce and death in the family, there was nobody to stand up for them,\u201d Warren told reporters in April. \u201cI got in that fight because they just didn\u2019t have anyone. And Joe Biden was on the side of the credit card companies.\u201d", "description": "Two of the top-polling Democratic contenders have scrapped for years over bankruptcy law and other issues.", "authors": ["Theodoric Meyer", "Alex Thompson"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/ea/64/fe40339547d7b6f07e06c38a1da5/warren-biden.jpg"}
