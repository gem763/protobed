Nearly 30 raised $500,000 or more in the third quarter, according to a POLITICO analysis of the fundraising filings. And all but six of the so-called \u201cfrontliners\u201d have at least half a million more banked than their challengers, if they have any challenger at all.\n\nMuch of the success can be attributed to ActBlue, the independent nonprofit online donor portal which essentially serves as a one-stop-shop for Democrat voters, allowing them to give to the Democrat candidate or organization of their choice with ease.\n\n\u201cOur only mission is to help small-dollar donors make their voices heard by easily giving to the groups they care about. That\u2019s why we have dedicated support teams for donors and the groups that use our platform, as well as free digital fundraising trainings,\u201d ActBlue explains.\n\nRepublicans do not have an online powerhouse equivalent to the left-wing organization, giving Democrat candidates a clear advantage in terms of fundraising ability. While the GOP has been pushing WinRed, it raised a fraction \u2013 $30 million \u2013 of the $297 million funneled by ActBlue in the third quarter, according to Politico.\n\nSome say this spells trouble for Republicans, who hope to take back the House in 2020. However, some members of the GOP are dismissing concerns. They believe that money will come in as the election draws closer and are banking on messaging\u2013 specifically, that impeachment remains widely unpopular among voters in key congressional districts.\n\n\u201cTheir base is fired up, and ActBlue has done a brilliant job. But I think we\u2019re going to close that gap,\u201d said Rep. Tom Cole (R-OK) said, according to Politico.\n\n\u201cPeople know it\u2019s going to be a very consequential election so there\u2019s going to be plenty of money moved behind our challengers,\u201d Cole added.\n\nPolitico describes the Democrats\u2019 financial advantage as potentially \u201cprohibitive\u201d and says it is causing some in the GOP to rethink attempts to oust \u201ccertain freshmen with massive war chests who hold districts in pricey media markets where Trump is not popular,\u201d as it may not be financially viable or realistic:\n\nIncumbents such as Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.), who is sitting on $2 million in the Los Angeles media market, and Sean Casten (D-Ill.), who has $1.4 million at his disposal in the Chicago area, may become less appealing targets because of the cost of attacking them on the airwaves. Both have at least $1.2 million more on hand than their challengers. \u201cA lot of them are again building up such strong races that it\u2019s possible they won\u2019t get a competitive candidate,\u201d said Rep. Ami Bera (D-Calif.), a leader of the New Democrat Coalition. \u201cWe can take them off the playing field.\u201d\n\nDespite that, many Republicans are remaining optimistic and banking on two key factors: Trump\u2019s backing and the general unpopularity of impeachment. Internal polling for the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) released this month showed that impeachment remains overwhelmingly unpopular in key congressional districts.\n\nThe majority of voters in those districts, 59 percent, do not view President Trump\u2019s July 25 conversation with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky as problematic. Additionally, the majority of independents in those districts\u2013 57 percent \u2013 do not view the conversation itself as impeachable either.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported:\n\nThe survey spelled trouble for Democrats who hold seats in Trump-won districts. The vast majority \u2013 62 percent \u2013 consider the conversation between the two leaders was \u201cappropriate.\u201d Only 33 percent considered it impeachable. Furthermore, Republican candidates in Trump districts represented by Democrats hold a \u201cdouble-digit advantage\u201d over impeachment-supporting Democrats. Respondents were asked: \u201cAnd, thinking ahead to the next election, would you be more willing to vote for: A Democratic candidate for Congress who believes that President Trump should be impeached and removed from office\u2026or\u2026 A Republican candidate for Congress who believes that President Trump\u2019s actions do not rise to an impeachable offense and that voters should be allowed to decide for themselves in next year\u2019s elections.\u201d Fifty-four percent of voters in those Trump-won, Democrat-held districts said they would be more willing to vote for a Republican. Only 38 percent chose a Democrat, giving Republicans a 16-point advantage.\n\nWhile Republicans seek to catch up to Democrats in terms of fundraising, they hope that the negative sentiment towards impeachment will offset the cash advantage of their competitors and ultimately work in their favor.\n\n\u201cIf they have the wrong positions for their districts, money can\u2019t save them,\u201d Rep. Steve Stivers (R-OH) said, according to Politico.", "description": "Democrats are building a financial powerhouse in hopes of maintaining a majority in the U.S. House, outraising competitors.", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/american-money-US-dollars-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
