It\u2019s not trying to bring others along on some given path. It\u2019s just doing.\u201d\n\nThe world has heard plenty from Trump. Does this speech even matter?\n\nIt does to some people \u2014 but definitely not like it did before.\n\nTrump likes to go it alone. That goes against the very reason the United Nations was created \u2014 to solve problems together. Still, whatever he does can hurt other countries.\n\nHe threatened to send in the military after he said Iran attacked Saudi Arabia's oil fields. He triggered economic jitters across the globe with his trade war against China. And he disagreed with just about everyone when he insisted North Korea didn\u2019t violate a U.N. Security Council resolution when it re-started weapons testing.\n\nForeign leaders will be watching closely \u2014 and perhaps a little nervously \u2014 to see what Trump plans to do about those disagreements, the crisis in Venezuela and Russian aggression in Europe.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always struck by the official discrepancy between the high-level agenda and what everyone talks about in the corridors,\u201d said Jeffrey Feltman, a former chief foreign policy adviser to U.N. Secretary-Generals Ban Ki-moon and Ant\u00f3nio Guterres who is now at the Brookings Institution. \u201cThis year there will be some overlap on climate, but otherwise in the corridors it will be about Iran, energy supplies and trade wars. The U.S. is in the middle of all three of those.\u201d\n\nWhich countries will Trump focus on?\n\nTrump will mention plenty of issues in his speech, but it\u2019s being written to send a message to two countries in particular: Iran and China.\n\nFirst, Iran. He already slapped new sanctions on Iran and sent additional troops to the Middle East after the Saudi oil attacks, which spurred the biggest percentage increase in oil prices since the first Gulf War. But he hasn\u2019t said what\u2019s next, leaving some to worry he could be considering a military strike.\n\nA senior administration official said Iran may just be an area Trump wants to form the kind of coalition he\u2019s generally not interested in. \u201cWe welcome this opportunity to consult with a broad range of partners and allies on our collective response,\u201d the official said. \u201cIt's important to remember the attack on the Saudi infrastructure really is an attack on everyone who consumes that energy.\u201d\n\nSecond, China. Trump wants to revive talks with China after a protracted trade war. Tariffs on U.S. and Chinese goods are starting to harm the economy and left him with a major unfulfilled campaign promise as he runs for reelection.\n\nSo let\u2019s set aside the authoritarian nations. What do democratic countries want to hear?\n\nLeaders of democratic countries, including French President Emmanuel Macron and others representing long-standing European allies, have been pushing Trump to re-engage with them on global issues.\n\nAnd they\u2019ll be looking for signs that he\u2019s gotten the message.\n\nTrump has gotten along better with autocratic leaders than democratically elected ones \u2014 from Russian President Vladimir Putin to North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un \u2014 and pulled out of numerous agreements, including the Iran nuclear deal and a 12-nation trade pact. Recently, nearly every top diplomat of both parties surveyed said U.S. influence has declined under Trump, according to the Global Situation Room survey.\n\nBut on Monday, he gave leaders some hope when he unexpectedly stopped by the U.N. climate summit, along with Vice President Mike Pence and U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Kelly Craft, where he appeared to listen to remarks from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s argued in the past that each country should ask solely in its own interest. And he\u2019s argued that American might, combined with his negotiating skill, would build U.S. power,\u201d said Jon Alterman, who previously served at the U.S. State Department. Now \u201cit seems to me that the president is a little more circumspect about what tools he has at his disposal and what he needs allies to do and what he wants to do unilaterally.\u201d\n\nEveryone is talking about Ukraine. Will Trump?\n\nUkraine won\u2019t be at the center of Trump\u2019s remarks \u2014 but it\u2019ll be on his mind, and everyone else\u2019s there.\n\nTrump still plans to meet with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. Yes, he\u2019ll do it amid growing calls for impeachment after accusations that he asked Zelensky to investigate one of his top political rivals, former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cThis is, I think, going to be the most-watched bilateral meeting at the General Assembly,\u201d said Heather Conley, who worked at the State Department during the George W. Bush administration. \u201cAnd this will certainly have the intensity of international focus on a very new Ukrainian president who just last year was a television star. So this will be quite an extraordinary approach focusing on U.S. assistance to Ukraine.\u201d\n\nTrump has tried for days to justify his comments to Zelensky in a July phone call that was brought to Congress\u2019 attention in recent days.\n\nOn Monday, he said he wanted to ensure the country cracked down on corruption while raising the specter that he may have released $250 million in foreign aid after Ukraine said it would look into allegations that Biden pushed the country to fire a prosecutor investigating the company connected to his son, Hunter.\n\n\u201cIf we're supporting a country, we want to make sure that country is honest,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIf you don't talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?\u201d\n\nBack in Washington, some Democrats are renewing calls for Trump\u2019s impeachment for what they call an abuse of power. Here in New York, foreign leaders are just waiting to see whether the latest controversy reshapes his presidency at all.\n\nRyan Heath contributed to this report.", "description": "Here are four big questions (and answers) about the American president\u2019s big address to the UN General Assembly.", "authors": ["Anita Kumar", "Arren Kimbel-Sannit", "Emma Anderson", "Kalina Oroschakoff"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1170468298-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
