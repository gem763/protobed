The last tax hike in 2014 hit consumers hard and caused deep downturn.\n\nThe initial budget for the current fiscal year amounts to 101.5 trillion yen, with social security and debt-servicing accounting for more than half the overall spending plan.\n\nThe finance ministry is seeking 24.97 trillion yen to pay for debt-servicing costs for fiscal 2020.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence called for spending to rise 1.2% to a record 5.32 trillion yen for fiscal 2020 to pay for U.S.-made interceptor missiles, stealth fighters, and other equipment it wants to counter threats from North Korea and China.", "description": "Budget requests from Japan's ministries have hit a record amount for the next fiscal year starting in April, the finance ministry said, highlighting the conflicting need to promote fiscal reform while propping up a flagging economy facing external risks.", "authors": ["Tetsushi Kajimoto", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
