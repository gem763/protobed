A WeWork spokesperson reached by Business Insider declined to comment.\n\nThe embattled office-rental company has been reeling since its failed attempt at a public offering last month, which was scrapped after the company's financials and leadership came under harsh scrutiny from investors and the public. Co-founder Adam Neumann resigned as CEO last month, and WeWork's new CEOs are reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, among other cost-cutting measures.\n\nA valuation of less than $8 billion would represent a stark drop-off from SoftBank's recent $47 billion private valuation of WeWork in January. SoftBank has now calculated that WeWork needs at least $3 billion to operate through the next year, and could run out of cash next month without a debt offering, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe latest proposal from SoftBank is still up in the air and subject to change, people with knowledge of the discussions told Bloomberg. The Japanese company, already WeWork's largest investor, is reportedly sharing its proposal with about 100 investors in order to shore up support for the debt offering.\n\nWeWork is also considering a competing bailout plan from JPMorgan. A source told Business Insider that a debt package from the bank could be in the billions.", "description": "SoftBank is reportedly eyeing a plan to rescue WeWork that would value the company below $8 billion, according to Bloomberg.", "authors": ["Aaron Holmes"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da9d81bcc4a0a68376f28d2?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
