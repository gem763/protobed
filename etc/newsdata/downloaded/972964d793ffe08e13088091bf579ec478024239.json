Let's use their lingo. The Times is \"an aggressive operation to discredit\" anyone deemed hostile to liberalism by publishing damaging information about them.\n\nThis outraged front-page story came in the wake of Times politics editor Tom Wright-Piersaniti being forced to apologize for (and delete) objectionable tweets. On Jan. 1, 2010, he tweeted, \"For example, I was going to say 'Crappy Jew Year,' but one of my resolutions is to be less anti-Semitic. So ... HAPPY Jew Year. You Jews.\" And this: \"I don't hate Mohawk Indians, though. I love those guys. I just hate Indians with mohawks. Different indians, different mohawks.\"\n\nA month ago, CNN photo editor Mohammed Elshamy was exposed for 2011 tweets. He apparently wrote, \"More than 4 jewish pigs killed in #Jerusalem today by the Palestinian bomb explode,\" and \"Despite everything happening now in Egypt, I'm proud of the army generation that liberated us from the zionist pigs @ 6 october 1973\".\n\nThose who live to expose Twitter outrages must be stopped!\n\nArthur Schwartz, an ally of Donald Trump Jr., tweeted, \"If the @nytimes thinks this settles the matter we can expose a few of their other bigots. Lots more where this came from.\"\n\nIn The Times story, The Times admitted this was about \"potentially embarrassing social media posts and other public statements,\" but a caption under another picture in the story warned, \"The operation is the latest step in a long-running effort by President Trump and his allies to undercut the influence of legitimate news reporting.\"\n\nSo, in other words, everything The Times does is \"legitimate.\" Everything its critics report about it is intended to \"undercut the influence\" of heroic journalists.\n\nNot to be outdone in outrage, Times publisher Arthur Gregg Sulzberger issued a memo about his paper's allegedly \"fearless and fair coverage\" of Trump and complained, \"They are using insinuation and exaggeration to manipulate the facts for political gain.\" The lack of self-awareness is mind-boggling. This sentence could be the motto of The New York Times.\n\nA spokesman for CNN also looked silly by proclaiming that when those in government \"and those working on their behalf, threaten and retaliate against reporters as a means of suppression, it's a clear abandonment of democracy for something very dangerous.\" Can we please stop these insufferable people from constantly insisting that they are the Embodiment of Democracy, and that when you attack them, democracy is abandoned, suppressed or endangered?\n\nThese journalists can dish it out against Trump and Trump backers, calling them the worst humans on Earth news cycle after cycle, but they're reduced to whining like children when someone somewhere says, \"Boo!\" about them.\n\nL.
