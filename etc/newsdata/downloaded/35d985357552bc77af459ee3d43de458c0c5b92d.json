Michael Flynn is picking up where Republicans left off last year as he tries to turn the FBI inside out to find new evidence.\n\nThe House GOP in 2017-18 launched an aggressive investigation into decisions by the Barack Obama administration to put the FBI\u2019s Russia probe squarely on President Trump and his colleagues.\n\nAmong other discoveries, Republicans found out that the FBI relied on a now-discredited Democratic Party-financed dossier to obtain wiretaps and run down its anti-Trump allegations.\n\nThe midterm elections ousted GOP House control, stopping the inquisitors.\n\nNow Flynn\u2019s new attorney Sidney Powell has filed court motions to try to unearth documents on how the FBI pursued not just the former general but the Trump cast.\n\nMs. Powell, a Texas appeals attorney, wants to prove that former special counsel Robert Mueller didn\u2019t abide by U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan\u2019s \u201cBrady\u201d order in February 2018. (The term derives from the 1963 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Brady v. Maryland that mandates that prosecutors turn over exculpatory evidence to the defense.)\n\nMichael Caputo, a Trump campaign adviser, says Ms. Powell has documented Justice Department chicanery in the past.\n\n\u201cWhen the bogus Russia investigations started, many of us caught up in the hoax passed around Sidney Powell\u2019s book \u2018Licensed to Lie\u2019 to prepare for the worst,\u201d Mr. Caputo told The Washington Times. \u201cShe\u2019s a real expert on the Justice Department\u2019s habit of hiding exculpatory information. Today she\u2019s representing all of America, shining a light on this systemic corruption and advancing our knowledge of the origins of this politically commissioned inquiry.\u201d\n\nMs. Powell filed an extraordinary motion last week, listing a smorgasbord of documents she wants Judge Sullivan to force the government to relinquish.\n\nHer aim is twofold: First, find Brady material by delving deep inside the FBI and the Justice Department\u2019s Trump-Russia probe, akin to how Republicans did the same chore last year. Second, ask the judge to dismiss the case based on a Brady violation.\n\nSpecial Assistant U.S. Attorney Brandon Van Grack quickly rejected the bid, saying the prosecution ended with Flynn\u2019s guilty plea.\n\n\u201cThe government has exceeded its discovery and disclosure obligations in this matter, including those imposed pursuant to Brady v. Maryland,\u201d Mr. Grack said in an Aug. 30 filing.\n\nSaid Ms. Powell: \u201cNot only have the prosecutors thumbed their noses at this court\u2019s order, they have ignored the rules of ethical conduct for the D.C. Bar.\u201d\n\nIn a list of 40-plus items, she is demanding access to FBI agent interview notes, or 302s; internal memos; wiretap transcripts; and records of any anti-Flynn leaks to reporters.\n\nSome are tantalizing. Ms. Powell asserts that the British Embassy may have sent a letter to the new Trump White House warning that Christopher Steele, the dossier writer, was unreliable.\n\nFlynn, briefly Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, pleaded guilty to lying to two FBI agents. They visited the White House on Jan. 24, 2017, to ask him about phone calls he conducted with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. The agents, including Peter Strzok, knew what Flynn had said. Flynn committed a falsehood by saying he had not urged Kremlin restraint over Obama economic sanctions when he did in fact say that.\n\nFlynn\u2019s sentencing was delayed while he cooperated with prosecutors in a case tied to foreign lobbying, not Russian election interference.\n\nMr. Mueller concluded his 22-month probe in March with a verdict that he could not establish that the Trump campaign conspired with Moscow in 2016 election trespassing.\n\nSince Flynn\u2019s guilty plea on Dec. 1, 2017 \u2014 20 months ago \u2014 new revelations emerged about how the FBI went about targeting Trump aides, including Flynn. He fired his defense team and summoned Ms. Powell, long a Brady champion.\n\nAmong new disclosures since the guilty plea:\n\n\u2981 The Republican majority on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence reported in May 2018 on closed-door testimony from then-Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe. Mr. McCabe testified that the agents who interviewed Flynn \u201cdidn\u2019t think he was lying.\u201d\n\n\u2981 Former FBI Director James B. Comey said at a public event that he sent agents to interview Flynn when he knew the White House was in its early chaotic days and he didn\u2019t have to first go through the president\u2019s counsel. Flynn had no legal counsel to prepare him for the agents \u2014 one of whom, Mr. Strzok, held great hostility toward the new president.\n\nMs. Powell\u2019s long list of Brady demands:\n\n\u2981 Stefan Halper\u2019s role in providing the FBI with any information on Flynn. Mr. Halper is a Washington national security adviser and Cambridge University professor who was retained by the FBI to spy on Trump campaign advisers. Flynn wants \u201call payments, notes, memos, correspondents, and instructions by and between the FBI, CIA or DoD with Stefan Halper.\u201d\n\n\u2981 All un-redacted text messages between Mr. Strzok and his then-girlfriend, former FBI counsel Lisa Page. They both expressed deep dislike of candidate Trump and his supporters.\n\n\u2981 Any wiretap applications that deal with Flynn. (It is known the FBI obtained four wiretap warrants on Trump volunteer Carter Page based largely on the dossier.)\n\n\u2981 Information on any U.S. intelligence spies assigned to Flynn since he retired in 2014 after heading the Defense Intelligence Agency.\n\n\u2981 All information that came from State Department official Kathleen Kavalec, one of several Obama political appointees who met with Mr. Steele or received his anti-Trump allegations.\n\n\u2981 Records of Bruce Ohr, another Obama official who met with Mr. Steele and his employer \u2014 Fusion GPS, Hillary Clinton\u2019s opposition research firm. Mr. Ohr conveyed Mr. Steele\u2019s allegations to the FBI and Justice Department lawyers. Mr. Ohr was associate deputy attorney general at the time.\n\n\u2981 The phone records of former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and Washington Post columnist David Ignatius. Mr. Ignatius broke the story on U.S. intercepts of Flynn\u2019s phone calls with Mr. Kislyak.\n\nConservative pundits say someone in the Obama administration committed a felony with that leak.\n\n\u2981 Any FBI records on leaks to the press on Flynn from top Obama officials.\n\nJudge Sullivan said in a written order Sept. 11: \u201cThere is a strong presumption in favor of public access to judicial records.\u201d\n\nDuring his cooperation phase, Flynn sat down with the FBI for \u201cmultiple debriefings in 2017-18,\u201d the final Mueller report said.\n\nRegarding Flynn, the report focused on his time in the presidential transition as he conducted phone calls with Mr. Kislyak. There is no evidence of any Russia election collusion.\n\nWhen Flynn pleaded guilty in 2017, the media, including the New York Times, wrote stories implying that his Mueller cooperation meant big trouble for Mr. Trump in the Russia probe. Flynn provided no such evidence.\n\nThe New York Times wrote: \u201cMr. Flynn\u2019s decision to plead guilty to lying to investigators about those conversations marked a significant new phase in the investigation of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, and a politically treacherous development for the president and his closest aides, whose activities in the West Wing are being scrutinized by F.B.I. agents, lawmakers, federal prosecutors and the media.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
