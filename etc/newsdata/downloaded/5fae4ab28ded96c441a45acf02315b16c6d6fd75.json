Today, Bungie seems to be fixing the problem.\n\n\u201cWe have issued a fix for players who accidentally purchased content on an inactive account before enabling Cross Save,\u201d Bungie tweeted today. \u201cWe have made a one-time attribution to grant the appropriate content.\u201d\n\nOne of the numerous people who had this problem tells Kotaku that their account for the game was fixed earlier today. Another said they don\u2019t see credit for the lost season passes in their game yet.\n\nThe issue popped up on Bungie\u2019s message boards on Tuesday and then in Kotaku\u2019s tips inbox (that\u2019s [email protected] for all the best scoops, please) throughout the weekend.\n\nThe issue is complicated, but boils down to:\n\nPeople paid for something;\n\nThe thing they paid for disappeared;\n\nCustomer support said they couldn\u2019t do anything about it.\n\nFrustrating! It\u2019s also convoluted, because it involved a bad combination of Destiny 2\u2019s new well-intentioned character transfer system and the game\u2019s latest annual pass, which was bundled with the $90 \u201cdigital deluxe\u201d edition of the game\u2019s new Shadowkeep expansion.\n\nThe expansion costs around $50 without the deluxe accoutrements, which include a year\u2019s worth of season passes \u2014 there are four seasons to a year, even in Destiny, though they name them things like Season of the Undying instead of, you know, Fall. Season passes give players access to extra rewards and a bonus mode, and run $15 per three-month season. Missing out means getting a little less game.\n\nBack in what we here in the real world call the season of summer, Bungie began offering support for cross-saves, a pretty cool option that would henceforth let a person hop between playing on different console and PC platforms while retaining their save progress. Many players began activating this system online in advance of it going live in the game, only to log into Destiny 2 last week to see that it didn\u2019t seem to take.\n\nWe heard from a Destiny fan named Jonathan who had been playing Destiny 2 on his PlayStation 4 and thought he\u2019d set up the cross-save option correctly. While Bungie says today that the fix they issued was for people who hadn\u2019t activated cross-save before purchasing the pass, he said he had gotten confirmation weeks ago that he was fine.\n\nAfter setting up cross-save, he had bought the Digital Deluxe edition on Steam and tried to boot the game up on his PC. The game started, but his PS4 character wasn\u2019t there. Instead, his PC copy of Destiny 2 was prompting him to start a new character. Realising the cross-save feature hadn\u2019t worked, he tried to activate it again. That worked. His PS4 character showed up in his Steam game \u2014 but without the annual season pass. He saw an option to buy it in the in-game store for 1,000 virtual pieces of silver, or $15.\n\nAs others did before and after him, Jonathan sought help on the official forums. Bungie support reps replied to some people, saying that \u201cSeason Passes will be applied to the first account that signs in. If you plan to Cross Save but will use another character set, it\u2019s recommended to set up Cross Save before logging in.\u201d\n\nThis frustrated players like Jonathan, who had thought they\u2019d done the cross-save feature correctly. He had an email confirming that. Regardless, he had paid for the annual pass and wanted to use it. For Jonathan and others, the season pass was getting applied to that blank account that they signed into without realising their character save hadn\u2019t yet transferred over.\n\nThey didn\u2019t want the season pass for that newbie character. And once they transferred their actual, established character over via cross-save, that season pass wasn\u2019t applied because, as per Bungie, that wasn\u2019t the first account they logged into on the platform for which they\u2019d bought the season pass.\n\nJonathan tried getting a refund on the game and repurchasing it, but that didn\u2019t work either. On Saturday, he and other players began contacting Kotaku, and we began asking Bungie what was going on.\n\nThis evening, we heard a fix might be coming and checked with Jonathan. He had good news. His Destiny 2 account suddenly gained 1,000 extra silver and an indication that he owns the next three season passes to round out the year. He had bit the bullet and spent 1,000 silver yesterday to buy into Season of the Undying, so that extra 1,000 Silver may simply be Bungie making good on the fact that he basically had to buy it twice.\n\nOn Saturday, Jonathan was stressed. \u201cAs someone with a budget and not a lot of money to spend, I\u2019m extremely frustrated with this and just don\u2019t know where to go with it,\u201d he wrote in an email to Kotaku.\n\nTuesday has brought better news for him, and hopefully for other Destiny 2 players with this issue as well.", "description": "Since last week, scores of Destiny 2 fans have been grinding their teeth over the apparent loss of their year\u2019s worth of\u00a0Season Passes, complaining about a flaw in development studio Bungie\u2019s character transfer feature that cost them $40 to $60 worth of digital stuff.
