Abe Restaurant\n\nKamaru are mole crickets that burrow on wet rice fields and are quite difficult to catch. According to the late restaurateur Larry J. Cruz, it is only when a rice farmer tills the field that the kamaru gets between his toes -- then he makes the catch!\n\nIn Pampanga province in the Philippines' Central Luzon region, they are a popular delicacy, often cooked adobo-style (marinated in vinegar, crushed garlic and soy sauce) or fried, and served with tomatoes. Bonus: They are a great source of protein and vitamin B.\n\nWhere to try it in Manila: Abe Restaurant\n\nAt Cruz's Abe Restaurant they prepare it adobo-style -- saut\u00e9ed with vinegar, crushed garlic and tomatoes.

Medal Elepano\n\nTiny rice field birds found in sugarcane plantations, pitaw are a delicacy in Bacolod, a city in Negros Occidental province.\n\nOften prepared fried, the birds are so tiny you can eat the bones as well.\n\nThis delicacy, similar to young quail, can be purchased in packaged form at local stores to take back home as a souvenir.\n\nWhere to try it in Manila: Grace Park\n\nNamed Asia's best female chef in 2016, Margarita Fores, originally from Bacolod, prepares the popular delicacy adobo-style before frying it to a crisp at her Manil restaurant, Grace Park.\n\nThe birds are served atop garlic butter brown rice.\n\nGrace Park , G/F One Rockwell, Rockwell Drive, Makati, Philippines; +63 2 843 7275\n\nIgado\n\nIgado takes its name from the Spanish word for \"liver.\" Wilson Quindo Tan\n\nPork belly and liver cooked in vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, onion, bay leaves, bell peppers and green peas make up igado, a popular dish in the Ilocos region of the Philippines (it's also found in Bicol, in Albay province).\n\nIt takes its name from higado, the Spanish word for liver, and is often described as a cousin of adobo and menudo (tomato-based pork stew).\n\nWhere to try it in Manila: Top Meal Food Haus\n\nChef and owner Wilson Quindo Tan saut\u00e9es cubed pork liempo (belly) and pork liver strips with garlic, onion, soy sauce and oyster sauce, then tops them with onion rings.\n\nTop Meal Food Haus , 5994 J.

Peninsula Manila\n\nDo crabs stuffed with fresh coconut and their own aligue (fat) and cooked in coconut milk sound delicious or what?\n\nBuntaa is a popular dish in Butuan City in Agusan del Norte in Mindanao. It takes its name from Binuntaan, which means 'pull out' -- which is what they do with the meat from female crabs.\n\nWhere to try it in Manila: Toyo Eatery\n\nAt Toyo Eatery, No. 43 on the 2019 edition of Asia's 50 Best Restaurants list, chef Jordy Navarra's take on buntaa involves working with its flavor profile. He created a crab and ginger flan to \"mimic the eggy texture you can get from crab roe,\" then made a roe sauce, which they serve with crab meat.\n\nAcidity comes in the form of a coconut vinegar reduction. Navarra calls it \"reusing the theme ingredients\" of crab, coconut and ginger, but in different permutations.\n\nToyo Eatery, 2316 Chino Roces Ave, Makati, Philippines; +63 917 720 8630\n\nPyanggang\n\nPyanggang, blackened coconut curry usually served with chicken, is a festive dish that hails from the Tausug tribe of Sulu province in Southern Mindanao.\n\nThe black curry-like sauce is made by burning coconut on charcoal, then grinding and blending it with spices. At Tausug weddings it is not uncommon to find a whole chicken prepared in this manner and served over yellow rice as the centerpiece.\n\nWhere to try it in Manila: Talisay, The Garden Cafe\n\nChef Tatung Sarthou, who you may have recently seen on Netflix's \"Street Food\" episode on the Philippines, uses prawns to created this dish at new restaurant, Talisay, The Garden Caf\u00e9, which is due to open in late September.\n\nApart from celebrating the rich seafood of Sulu, the sweetness of the poached shrimp complements the rich, smoky flavor of the burnt coconut sauce. He serves this with a salad of grilled eggplants, tomatoes, shallots, green mangoes and palapa (spiced toasted coconut).\n\nTalisay, the Garden Cafe, 44 Maginhawa Street, Barangay UP village, Quezon city, Philippines\n\nTiyula Itum\n\nLampara's version of tiyula itum is a tribute to the flavors of Mindanao. Kristyn Ang\n\nLiterally translating to \"black stew,\" tiyula itum is a braised beef soup dish that originated from the Tausug people of the Philppines' Sulu archipelago.\n\nIt is considered \"food for royalty\" and is served on special occasions like weddings and Hari Raya (festival of the breaking of the fast). As with the pyanggang, the black color comes from the use of charred coconut meat.\n\nChunks of beef\u2014sometimes goat\u2014are marinated in a mix of spices and powdered burnt coconut meat before being fried with garlic, onions, turmeric, ginger and lengkuas (a type of tuber).\n\nWhere to try it in Manila: Lampara\n\nOn Eid al-Adha, an annual Muslim holiday that's referred to as the \"Festival of the Sacrifice\", chef RJ Ramos released his version of the dish as a tribute to the flavors of Mindanao. Their take on tiyula itim incorporates elements of pyanggang in terms of flavor profile.\n\nHomemade chicken stock is used to make fish fumet, along with lemongrass. The burnt coconut is then saut\u00e9ed with pounded garlic, ginger, lemongrass, burnt chilies, galangal and onions, before adding the reduced fish fumet.\n\nLampara substitutes beef with prawns and mussels, since the Tausugs are \"people of the sea.\"", "description": "There's so much more to cuisine in the Philippines than adobo and balut.
