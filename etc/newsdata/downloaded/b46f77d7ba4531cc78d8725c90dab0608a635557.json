This is a very Manchester day. The clouds are gunmetal grey and hanging patiently, like an insistent parent holding a damp flannel in the direction of a toddler\u2019s mucky face.\n\nEngland won\u2019t mind if time is taken out of the Test. Surely they are in no position to contemplate winning, regardless how vivid the memory remains of Ben Stokes\u2019s heroics at Headingley. After two days of sub-optimal bowling and fielding, and ten overs of predictably questionable batting, England will do well to leave Lancashire with the Ashes alive.\n\nIf they don\u2019t it will be largely down to Steve Smith. Once again the Australian elevated his craft to levels not seen for 70 years. This is his series, and we are lucky to be around to witness greatness. But cricket being cricket, somehow he may still yet fly home without the urn.\n\nI\u2019m going to be around for the next hour or so to keep Adam Collins\u2019s seat warm.
