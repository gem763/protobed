Suppliers and buyers must come to an agreement for the monthly installment plan, and Splitit claims the process is \"risk-free\" for suppliers.\n\nFinancing options have become increasingly popular among consumers and they should appeal to businesses as well, but B2B does present new challenges.\n\nJust as consumer financing products enable shoppers to make purchases they might not otherwise, B2B offerings should enable more firms to do the same. Being able to stretch out a purchase may allow more companies to make purchases, which could be particularly important for small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) that may not have enough funds to pay for large orders all at once. This benefits suppliers too, as they can potentially secure more sales and even win new clients away from other suppliers that don't offer installment payments. And because Splitit Business Payments doesn't require buyers to submit an application or have their credit checked, such offerings may be able to simplify B2B payments.\n\nBut because each B2B payment using Splitit's platform requires the buyer and supplier to come to a specific agreement, the financing option may lose some of its convenience. When consumers use point-of-sale (POS) financing options they can be served a set of already determined terms, enabling quick decisions and purchases. But with Splitit's B2B offering, the two parties need to agree on the installment plan for each deal, so Splitit would do well to find ways to simplify and facilitate this process so negotiations don't create friction and hurt its offering's appeal.\n\nGetting into B2B payments could help Splitit on two levels, as it can cash in on the industry's immense value and potentially leverage the relationships it builds for its other offerings. Business Insider Intelligence forecasts US B2B payments volume to rise from $21.8 trillion in 2019 to $28.8 trillion in 2024, so if Splitit can find any success in the space it should prove to be lucrative.\n\nAnd Splitit may be able to do so, as B2B payments have been slow to digitize, so its platform could attract companies looking to improve their payment processes. Additionally, if the firm impresses both suppliers and buyers with its B2B offerings, it may be able to convince those with consumer-facing sales to employ its consumer products too, boosting its whole business.\n\nInterested in getting the full story?
