In fact, it's not a cease-fire it's a demand of capitulation of the Kurds.\"\n\nAfter briefing NATO ambassadors gathered in the formal meeting room of the North Atlantic Council, Pompeo appeared at a brief news conference with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, who began by saying: \"I welcome that two NATO allies, the United States and Turkey, have agreed on a way forward.\"\n\nStoltenberg's remarks hinted at the tensions of recent days, in which Trump first gave the go-ahead for the Turkish offensive and then reversed course amid a storm of criticism. At one point, Trump had threatened to \"totally destroy and obliterate the economy of Turkey.\"\n\nStoltenberg reiterated his carefully calibrated remarks about Turkey. \"We all know and understand that the situation in northeast Syria is fragile, difficult,\" Stoltenberg said. \"Turkey is on the frontline ... the forefront of a very volatile region. No other ally has suffered more terrorist attacks. They host millions of refugees, and Turkey has legitimate security concerns.\"\n\nPompeo also reiterated his call for restraint and urged that the efforts by NATO allies to fight the Islamic State not be undermined.\n\nMost experts say many such gains have been put at risk as a result of a hasty U.S. pull-out and the Turkish incursion, with hundreds of jihadists reportedly escaping from Kurdish-run detention camps amid the fighting.\n\nAt one point on Friday, there seemed to be some disagreement on the Turkish side as to what was agreed \u2014 with Turkey saying it was merely a \"pause\" in its operation \u2014 and whether the purported cease-fire was holding, as fighting continued in parts of the area.\n\nStoltenberg continued to try to put on a positive spin. \"NATO is an important forum for all NATO allies to sit together and address common security concerns and the situation in northeast Syria is a concern for all NATO allies,\" he said.\n\nPompeo, in response to a question, said that he could not explain comments by Trump, made in a tweet, declaring that the U.S. had secured \"the Oil\" \u2014 saying he had not seen the remarks. It was unclear what oil the president was referring to.\n\nTrump also insisted that European allies had agreed to repatriate foreign Islamic State fighters who had been detained in northeast Syria, but Pompeo was more guarded in his remarks and declined to specify which countries might be willing to accept the detainees.\n\n\"We have seen comments today from a number of countries who have said they may well be prepared to take back these fighters,\" Pompeo said. \"I have to say I am happy about that. I am disappointed that it didn't occur previously.\"\n\nPompeo did call on other countries, including European allies, to do more to help Turkey.\n\n\"We've seen the burden that that's placed on our NATO ally Turkey, with now some 2 or 3 or 4 million people displaced persons inside of Turkey,\" Pompeo said at the news conference. \"That's an enormous burden. Europe needs to provide, to seriously consider how to respond to this threat, this challenge that is presented by migration.\"", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/fb/93/7d9a3f394e1cb24173c35581aa11/191019-pompeo-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
