I miss him,\" wrote one Twitter user.\n\nFor Rabbi Dayna Ruttenberg, it was a reminder of how committed the devoutly religious Presbyterian minister was to progressive politics.\n\n\"I'm just glad when people bring him back because he did such a powerful thing. He instilled a feeling of love and safety and well-being and concern into generations of children,\" she told Day 6.\n\nWhile you're in your Mr. Rogers feels, a few things to remind you about his radical theology. <br><br>1/x<br><br>He was a Presbyterian minister whose life\u2019s work was built almost entirely (if not entirely) around Leviticus 19:18 (Love your neighbor as yourself.) <br>Hence... the neighborhood. \u2014@TheRaDR\n\nMister Rogers' Neighborhood, which aired from 1968 until 2001, tackled everything from war to sexuality in a child-friendly format.\n\nThose messages, she says, are needed today more than ever.\n\n\"There's a movement towards othering people, towards treating people as instruments \u2026 this is a very intense time of not caring about people's humanity for their own humanity but rather sort of, 'Are you useful to my purposes or not?'\" Ruttenberg said.\n\nRuttenberg shared some of her favourite moments from the show.\n\nVietnam War\n\nThe very first episode of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood hit TVs across the U.S. on Feb. 19, 1968.\n\nThe episode didn't shy away from the contentious Vietnam War that started more than a decade earlier.\n\nViewers discovered that King Friday, one of the show's regular cast of puppet characters, was establishing a border guard in his make-believe kingdom, and later in the week, that he was building a border wall.\n\nIt was an effort to explain how groups are set apart from each other in relation to the ongoing war.\n\n\"He was trying to address some of that us-and-them, inside-outside, mentality that was really relevant as the Vietnam War was raging on,\" Ruttenberg recalled.\n\nSegregation\n\nOne of the most powerful episodes, from Ruttenberg's perspective, tackled segregation in swimming pools.\n\nFrancois Clemmons, a recurring visitor to Mister Rogers' neighbourhood, was a black police officer. In a 1969 episode, Rogers invites Clemmons to sit by the pool.\n\n\"He just had Officer Clemmons come over \u2014 and Officer Clemmons was hot because it was a hot day \u2014 and they both decided to take off their shoes and socks and to put their feet in the kiddie pool,\" Ruttenberg said.\n\n\"Mr. Rogers helped to wash Officer Clemmons' feet.\"\n\nAt a time when the issue of racial segregation divided America, Ruttenberg says the episode sent a message that white feet and black feet could \"share space in the water.\"\n\nSexual orientation\n\nBehind the scenes, Rogers went out of his way to protect Clemmons.\n\nWhen Clemmons, who is gay, visited an LGBT-friendly bar, Rogers implored him to not return.\n\nAccording to Ruttenberg, it wasn't about asking Clemmons to deny his sexuality, but rather keep him safe.\n\nFrancois Clemmons appeared on Mister Rogers' Neighborhood from 1968 until 1993.
