But apart from her business ventures, Rihanna has never faltered when it comes to stepping out with a new and exciting look. She\u2019s tried everything \u2014 from a black pixie to a blonde mohawk to bright red curls \u2014 and in Paris on Thursday night, while celebrating her latest Fenty launch, the star stepped out with a new blunt fringe.\n\nYes, Rihanna has had a fringe before \u2014 most notably back in 2007 \u2014 and even showed us how to do a curly fringe back in 2012. But has she ever had hair this long with a blunt fringe at the same time? We think not.\n\nThis dramatic new look comes at a time when plenty of other celebrities are opting for huge hair makeovers. For example, Millie Bobby Brown just went bright blonde and Demi Lovato just dip-dyed her hair neon green, but Rihanna\u2019s change is perhaps the most attainable in the lot. Plus, the new look solidifies the fact that while the curtain fringe may have ruled summer, the blunt fringe \u2014 also seen on Liv Tyler \u2014 are sure to reign supreme this autumn. After all, if it\u2019s good enough for RiRi\u2026\n\nLike what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?\n\nShop Rihanna\u2019s Savage x Fenty Show\n\nProof That Rihanna Looks Good In Every Hairstyle\n\nCan We Not Talk About Rihanna's Body?", "description": "PARIS, FRANCE \u2013 SEPTEMBER 26: Rihanna arrives at the \u2018Fenty\u2019 after party on September 26, 2019 in Paris, France.
