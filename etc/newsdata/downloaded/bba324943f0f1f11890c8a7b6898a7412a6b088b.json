The majority of Catalans, separatist or not, have all along regarded the charges and now the sentences as disproportionate.\n\nOne protester in Barcelona carried a placard that read: No soy independentista pero tampoco soy gilipollas (I\u2019m not pro-independence but I\u2019m not an idiot either).\n\nCentral Barcelona was almost impassable to traffic as protesters gathered at various points in the city. School and university students filled the streets and were soon joined by office and municipal workers.\n\nOne student union called for \u201cmassive disobedience\u201d, calling on students to be \u201cthe point of the lance of the people\u2019s movement for independence\u201d.\n\nThe umbrella group Tsunami Democr\u00e0tic, which was formed to channel reaction to the sentence, has called on supporters to block the main terminal at Barcelona airport.\n\nThe rail service to the airport was cancelled at the request of the regional police force on Monday afternoon.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Thousands gather at Catalunya Square in Barcelona. Photograph: Marta Perez/EPA\n\nA large crowd gathered outside the supreme court building in Barcelona where Marcel Mauri, leader of the grassroots organisation \u00d2mnium Cultural, denounced the sentence as \u201cvengeance\u201d after learning that \u00d2mnium\u2019s former leader, Jordi Cuixart, had been sentenced to nine years in prison.\n\nIn Girona around 6,000 demonstrators massed outside the seat of the Spanish government in the province. The Girona local authority suspended all official activities, as did Tarragona, Catalonia\u2019s second city.\n\nA heavy police presence at key transport hubs prevented protesters from blocking major rail and road links as they have in the past but some minor roads were blocked in the north of the region. The national rail operator Renfe said train services were operating as normal.\n\nPolice also closed off access to the Parc de la Ciutadella which adjoins the Catalan parliament building in Barcelona.\n\nThe Catalan football federation called off all matches and training sessions in solidarity with the imprisoned leaders, while Barcelona football club condemned the sentences and called for dialogue.\n\nThe Committees for the Defence of the Republic, a direct action group, called for a \u201cpermanent mobilisation\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe people rule and the government obey\u201d, they said in a statement, warning the Catalan government not to backtrack on its commitment to establishing an independent Catalan republic.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Demonstrators take to streets in Barcelona and elsewhere in Spain after verdicts", "authors": ["Stephen Burgen"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef6d7444eb3f17adb4ab6f49573b6090a475b347/0_72_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a0261ae9456c88638a1290120f360a3f", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
