It\u2019s triggered by very hot or very cold weather, so the heatwave this summer was a struggle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018He\u2019s suffered from it his whole life, ever since he was a baby and had cradle cap on his scalp. At the time, someone recommended I use olive oil to soften the skin, but it made his hair fall out! To this day he still has a little patch where his hair never grew back.\n\nAngelo struggles with verbal communication (Picture: Anna Kennedy)\n\n\u2018As he got older, he needed the labels cutting out of his clothes and he\u2019d wear layers and layers of socks everyday so that the pressure would alleviate the itching on the backs of his knees. Now, the eczema has followed him into adulthood and we\u2019ve tried everything to help sooth it, but so far nothing had helped.\u2019\n\nIt was then that Anna, who is an educator and charity chair who has worked to provide improved education facilities for children with autism spectrum disorders, turned to her Twitter followers for help.\n\nDeborah Meaden recommended the brand to Anna on Twitter (Picture: Anna Kennedy)\n\nAmong her large Twitter following was businesswoman Deborah Meaden, who recommended a \u00a34 moisturiser by family toiletries brand, Good Bubble, which she partnered with after founder Amy Wordsworth appeared on Dragon\u2019s Den.\n\nAnna said: \u2018I thought I might as well give it a go, so I tried both the moisturiser and the bubble bath.\u2019\n\nThe products cost under \u00a35 (Picture: Good Bubble)\n\n\u2018Within a few days of using it on Angelo\u2019s skin, I noticed that it had really soothed the eczema and calmed it down. It looked so much better! There was less inflammation, Angelo wasn\u2019t scratching anymore and overall, he was far more settled.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019re often seeing so-called \u2018miracle cures\u2019 for eczema, and we always caveat this with the fact that there is currently no \u2018cure\u2019 for it, but there are products that might help clear up symptoms.\n\nAngelo\u2019s arm after using the moisturiser for some time (Picture: Anna Kennedy)\n\nFor Angelo, it was the mix of cottonseed and aloe vera in Good Bubble\u2019s baby moisturiser, which is normally used on children, but works on everyone.\n\nAmy Wordsworth, founder of Good Bubble, added: \u2018Eczema can be distressing at the best of times, so I can\u2019t imagine what it must\u2019ve been like for Angelo not being able to communicate his frustrations.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m so thrilled our baby moisturiser has helped him to better cope with his sensitive skin and that we\u2019ve been able to help Anna\u2019s family after all the amazing things she\u2019s done to raise awareness of autism spectrum disorders.\u2019\n\nMORE: There\u2019s now an advent calendar that lets you donate to a good cause every day\n\nMORE: Cadbury announces its Easter range for next year and people are confused\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Angelo, who is non-verbal struggled to communicate the pain of his condition, but found relief through a cream recommended by Deborah Meaden.", "authors": ["Jessica Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_91940570_1572003616.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
