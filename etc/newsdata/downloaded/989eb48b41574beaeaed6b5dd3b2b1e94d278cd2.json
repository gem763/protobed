Everyone was full go. Everyone assumed it was a fumble. Well, I shouldn\u2019t say everybody.\u201d\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nIndeed there were a few people who saw Trey Hendrickson\u2019s strip of Rams quarterback Jared Goff differently, and as happens all too often to the Saints, they each wore black and white striped shirts. Referees initially ruled Goff had thrown an incomplete pass and blew the play dead as Jordan was rumbling down the sideline on his way to the end zone.\n\nA replay review clearly showed that Hendrickson had knocked the ball out of Goff\u2019s hand before the quarterback\u2019s arm began moving forward, but by then the damage was done. Because the referees blew the whistle instead of letting the play continue, Jordan\u2019s 87-yard fumble return for a touchdown was wiped out and the Saints instead took possession at their own 13-yard line.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, download it here.]\n\nEvery Saints player acknowledged that the blown call was far from the only reason for their 27-9 loss to the Rams, but that didn\u2019t make the costly mistake any easier for them to swallow. This is the third straight game that the Saints have been the victim of a high-profile officiating error, the third straight time it\u2019s sometimes felt like they were playing 11-on-18.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt started with last January\u2019s infamous missed pass interference call that helped the Rams beat the Saints to advance to the Super Bowl and led to groundbreaking replay rule changes during the offseason. Then referees mistakenly ran 15 extra seconds off at a key juncture of Monday\u2019s season opener, hurting the Saints\u2019 chances of getting in position to score before halftime.\n\nCameron Jordan returns a fumble for a touchdown that was nullified due to the play being called an incomplete pass by the official against the Los Angeles Rams.

Saints coach Sean Payton was still steaming at halftime about the blown call, telling Fox sideline reporter Erin Andrews, \u201cI'm so tired of being on the wrong side of it.\u201d\n\nWhile Payton had calmed down by his postgame news conference, Jordan was still seething about the premature whistle. He said any \u201cFoot Locker\u201d referee will tell you to let the play play out before correcting himself. He also lamented that the NFL employs older referees who \u201cwere in their prime maybe a decade ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen people are at the top of their craft, usually that doesn\u2019t happen, right?\u201d Jordan asked.\n\nNo disrespect to footlocker https://t.co/YhiBokGL8Z \u2014 cameron jordan (@camjordan94) September 16, 2019\n\nFrustrating as being on the wrong end of another blown call had to be for the Saints, they leave Los Angeles with much bigger worries. Chief among them is the health of future Hall of Fame quarterback Drew Brees, who left Sunday\u2019s game with a first-quarter thumb injury severe enough that he could not grip a football thereafter.\n\nBrees hurt his thumb when he made contact with Rams pass rusher Aaron Donald\u2019s hand. The Saints quarterback underwent X-rays after the game and intends to see a hand specialist in Los Angeles on Sunday night.\n\nAsked how severe the injury is, Brees said, \u201cI have no idea. I really don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all up in the air,\u201d he added.\n\nBackup Teddy Bridgewater completed 17 of 30 passes for 165 yards in Brees\u2019 absence, but the Saints struggled to sustain drives with him under center. Too many costly penalties were a major factor, as was the Saints\u2019 inability to keep the Rams\u2019 defensive front seven out of the backfield.\n\n\u201cTeddy came in ready to go,\u201d Payton said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think we played particularly well around him. When we watch that tape tomorrow, it\u2019s not going to be pleasant for some guys.\u201d\n\nThe film room won\u2019t be any easier for the Saints\u2019 defense, which struggled to cover the Rams\u2019 talented receiving corps and yielded three second-half touchdowns. The biggest play was a fourth-quarter, 66-yard pass to Cooper Kupp in which he broke five tackles to set up a 1-yard quarterback sneak by Goff.\n\nWhile Jordan acknowledged the Saints played poorly in the second half, he couldn\u2019t help but wonder if the game might have gone differently had his fumble return resulted in a touchdown. Instead of a 10-3 lead, the Saints failed to convert a fourth-and-1 at their own 49-yard line and the Rams capitalized with a field goal in the dying seconds of the first half.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a 10-point swing,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cSeems like that\u2019s affecting the game, right?\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "It wasn't enough that the referees again cost the Saints, but now Drew Brees is hurt, too.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/H4.giRBOCNxTAdGzbADgqw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/29X.WSJ0nSQC7nAnil1X7Q--~B/aD0zMDAzO3c9NDUwNDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/1b297db0-d82e-11e9-b795-5a346cb6a6a0", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
