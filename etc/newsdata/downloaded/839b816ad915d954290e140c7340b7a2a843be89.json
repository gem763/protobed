The campaign will launch Thursday with a national cable TV and radio ad. It will expand to local TV, digital, and radio ads in targeted Senate and House districts over the upcoming weeks, the organization said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMitchell would not disclose which specific districts, because he said he didn\u2019t want to alert \u201cBig Pharma\u201d in advance.\n\nMitchell said the ads will urge lawmakers to pass a bipartisan Senate Finance Committee bill (S. 2543), as well as the signature drug pricing bill from House Democrats (H.R. 3).\n\nThe Senate bill, which is backed by the administration, is facing Republican opposition over a provision that would impose a limit on drug price increases in Medicare\u2019s Part D prescription drug program.\n\nThe bill would force drug companies to pay money back to the government if their prices rise faster than inflation. It faces long odds of making it to the Senate floor without substantial changes, but it is likely far more palatable to Republicans than a competing bill in the House.\n\nThe House legislation is the signature effort from Democratic leaders to bring down the cost of prescription drugs.\n\nThe bill will allow the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate lower prices for up to 250 drugs per year, and the savings will apply to people in private insurance plans as well as Medicare.\n\nThe measure is expected to pass the House later this month or early next month, though there are still concerns from some Democratic lawmakers.
