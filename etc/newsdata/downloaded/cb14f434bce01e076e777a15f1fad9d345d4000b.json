Upbit, one of the country\u2019s biggest exchange platforms, has discontinued DigixDAO trading and all Metal (MTL) transactions except MTL to Korean won withdrawals. The move is a major blow to MTL, for whom Upbit transactions represented 20% of global trade in the currency. Upbit has also discontinued its support for FunFair, Mysterium and Rise (RISE) in the past month. In many cases, Upbit\u2019s altcoin traders are being forced to transfer their funds to overseas exchanges, as no other South Korean exchanges offer trading in these five altcoins. The Korea Blockchain Association, which represents South Korean exchanges, says its members will \u201ccarefully review\u201d the currencies they list at a meeting next month. Yonhap quotes an Upbit spokesperson as saying, \u201cWe are just trying to simplify our transaction processes. We are not discontinuing support for these currencies because we consider them to be unsafe.\u201d\n\nBitFlyer CEO: \u201cGlobal Crypto Regulations Talks Will Take Place in March\u201d\n\nYuzo Kano, the CEO of Japanese exchange platform BitFlyer, told Business Insider Japan that the country\u2019s finance minister believes worldwide cryptocurrency regulation will be on the agenda at an upcoming G20 meeting.
