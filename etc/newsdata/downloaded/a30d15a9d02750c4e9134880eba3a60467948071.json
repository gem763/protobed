Cooper asked O'Rourke how he would enforce the proposal and compel unwilling gun owners to participate.\n\n\"I expect my fellow Americans to follow the law,\" the Texas Democrat responded. \"The same way that we enforce any provision, any law that we have right now. We don't go door-to-door to do anything in this country to enforce the law.\"\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate and former Rep.

SHANNON STAPLETON / REUTERS\n\nUnsatisfied with the answer, Cooper continued to press O'Rourke, asking him how he would ensure that all owners of guns subject to his mandatory buyback initiative agreed to turn in their weapons. The CNN anchor floated the scenario of a gun owner refusing to participate in the proposal.\n\n\"If someone does not turn in an AR-15, an AK-47 \u2014 one of these weapons of war \u2014 or brings it out in public and brandishes in an attempt to intimidate, as we saw when we were at Kent state recently, then that weapon will be taken from them,\" O'Rourke said. \"If they persist, there will be other consequences from law enforcement. But the expectation is that Americans will follow the law.\"\n\nCooper then turned to Buttigieg, noting that the Midwestern mayor previously called O'Rourke's plan a form of \"confiscation.\"\n\nButtigieg faulted O'Rourke for failing to explain how his proposal would get weapons \"off the streets.\" He said Democrats need to instead focus on quickly and effectively pushing less controversial gun safety measures, like universal background checks for gun transactions and so-called \"red flag\" laws.\n\n\"We cannot wait for purity tests,\" the mayor said. \"We have to just get something done.\"\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg speaks during a Democratic presidential primary debate hosted by CNN/New York Times at Otterbein University, Tuesday, Oct. 15, 2019, in Westerville, Ohio. John Minchillo / AP\n\nThe last comment visibly irked O'Rourke, who pushed back on the idea that his buyback program was part of a \"purity test.\" He said Democrats should not limit their gun safety proposals based on polls or suggestions by political consultants \u2014 a not so thinly-veiled jab at Buttigieg.\n\n\"I don't need lessons from you on courage \u2014 political or personal,\" Buttigieg, who was deployed to Afghanistan during his time in the Navy Reserve, told O'Rourke during a heated part of the exchange.\n\nHe advised O'Rourke to focus his criticism on gun lobby groups like the National Rifle Association (NRA), and not fellow Democrats.\n\nO'Rourke, in turn, told Buttigieg that he was not taking anyone on for simply challenging his proposal on policy grounds. But he said that calling his buyback plan a \"shiny object\" represented a \"slap in the face\" to survivors of gun violence.\n\nThe conversation finally cooled off when Buttigieg pivoted to health care.\n\nImmediately after the exchange between O'Rourke and Buttigieg, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, in a more conciliatory tone, urged the rest of the candidates to dial down the rhetoric.\n\n\"I worry about how we talk to each other and about each other,\" he told the audience.", "description": "\"I don't need lessons from you on courage \u2014 political or personal,\" Buttigieg told O'Rourke during a heated exchange", "authors": ["Camilo Montoya-Galvez", "Camilo Montoya-Galvez Is The Immigration Reporter At Cbs News.
