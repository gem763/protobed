Instead the state is now starkly divided between the hard-Left and the hard-Right.\n\nThe result will be seen as personal vindication for Mr Ramelow, Germany\u2019s first regional prime minister from the Left Party, a successor to the former East German communist party.", "description": "The nationalist Alternative for Germany party (AfD) made sweeping gains in regional elections on Sunday, inflicting heavy losses on Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats (CDU).", "authors": ["Justin Huggler", "Norman Tebbit", "Asa Bennett", "Henry Smith", "John Longworth"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/27/TELEMMGLPICT000214333387-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqsCNzwEn1rYoPN2nqjhn_yt1QKlgsLFjdQgqprUIoy34.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
