But nothing really has. 'I do not see structural changes,' said Rep. Val Demings after Pelosi's announcement.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s historic announcement on Tuesday that the House will launch a formal impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump reflects a growing sentiment among Democrats that Trump has abused his power at the highest levels.\n\nIn a closed-door meeting earlier in the day, Pelosi described to Democrats what would happen next: The six House panels investigating Trump would compile evidence against him and share it with the House Judiciary Committee, which would then decide whether to recommend articles of impeachment to the full House.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThere is just one problem: All of that had already been in motion since July.\n\n\u201cThere was no discussion of any structural changes,\u201d Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said. \u201cIt was all about what the president has done.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the White House\u2019s refusal to turn over a whistleblower complaint that reportedly outlines Trump\u2019s efforts to solicit foreign interference in the 2020 presidential election by pressuring Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate Joe Biden and his son jolted an impeachment effort that some had declared dead. But two months ago, the Judiciary Committee announced an \u201cimpeachment investigation\u201d \u2014 and Pelosi blessed it in legal documents filed in Democrats\u2019 effort to obtain evidence against Trump.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Others said everything was functionally the same.\n\nJudiciary Committee Democrats described Pelosi\u2019s announcement as a powerful endorsement of a process already underway.\n\n\u201cShe has thrown the weight of her office and the caucus behind this,\u201d said Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon (D-Pa.), the vice chairwoman of the Judiciary panel. \u201cMaybe it will remove some of the questions about whether or not we\u2019ve been engaged in an impeachment investigation for the last few months.\u201d\n\nOther lawmakers noted that she left lawmakers without a time frame for action, frustrating Democrats who had hoped her backing would include an urgent push to bring articles of impeachment to the House floor.\n\n\u201cNo, I do not see structural changes,\u201d said Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.), one of just three lawmakers who sit on both the Judiciary and Intelligence committees.\n\nPelosi\u2019s pronouncement was undoubtedly a historic escalation for a House speaker who has strenuously avoided uttering the word \u201cimpeachment\u201d in public. With her muscle behind the process, it is more likely than ever that articles of impeachment will head to the full House for a vote. But aside from a political shift, the actual process of crafting articles remains the same.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/3888/1155968404_6089163104001_6089162887001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nIn late July, the Judiciary Committee entered a new phase when it began referring to its various Trump probes as an \u201cimpeachment investigation\u201d in court filings. Pelosi signed off on those court filings \u2014 and members of the committee took it as an explicit blessing by the speaker.\n\nAccording to multiple sources, lawmakers were not given a deadline on Tuesday for when the committee leaders must turn over their materials to the Judiciary Committee. Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), the chairman of that panel, stated last month that he was aiming to decide by the end of the year whether to recommend articles of impeachment to the full House.\n\nSimilarly, Nadler asked four committee chiefs last month to share documents and other relevant information for his panel\u2019s ongoing impeachment investigation \u2014 a call Pelosi echoed Tuesday.\n\nThe revelation that the Trump administration was withholding the whistleblower complaint from the congressional intelligence committees heightened the urgency to formalize the House\u2019s impeachment process \u2014 one that had been mired in a series of strategic and messaging mishaps over the past few weeks.\n\n\u201cWe just don\u2019t have the time anymore to allow those issues to be resolved through the normal court process,\u201d said Demings, who announced on Tuesday that she supports impeaching Trump.\n\nIn the coming days, Democrats will ramp up their oversight efforts as they seek to learn more about the whistleblower\u2019s allegations. The White House indicated it could release the complaint and the inspector general\u2019s report to the congressional intelligence committees by the end of the week.\n\nDemocrats are preparing to grill acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire when he appears before the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday. Maguire has refused to turn over the full whistleblower complaint \u2014 which the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general dubbed \u201curgent\u201d \u2014 apparently because of objections from the Justice Department. Democrats also hope to get to the bottom of allegations that Trump sought to freeze hundreds of millions of dollars in military assistance to Ukraine to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nPolitically, Pelosi\u2019s full embrace of an impeachment inquiry represents a reset of sorts after the Judiciary Committee\u2019s struggles to sustain momentum behind its investigation, which has centered on former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a different energy,\u201d said Rep. Mike Quigley (D-Ill.), a member of the Intelligence Committee. \u201cThere will be much more resources and effort toward that end. I also think there\u2019s a dramatic difference tactically in courts when you have an impeachment inquiry with the full body behind it.\u201d\n\nModerate Democrats have grumbled about Nadler, and some lawmakers \u2014 including Rep. Stephanie Murphy (D-Fla.), co-chairwoman of the Blue Dog Coalition \u2014 demanded that the impeachment process be snatched from his committee and handed to a select committee.\n\nPelosi ignored that request Tuesday in favor of the ongoing process, though aides and some Democrats said the suggestion isn\u2019t off the table.\n\nThere are no immediate plans to hold a vote on the House floor to endorse the impeachment inquiry, according to lawmakers and aides. But Republicans have been arguing for months that Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry is a \u201csham\u201d because, they say, it requires a House vote.\n\n\u201cSpeaker Pelosi\u2019s decree changes absolutely nothing,\u201d said Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee. \u201cAs I have been telling Chairman Nadler for weeks, merely claiming the House is conducting an impeachment inquiry doesn\u2019t make it so. Until the full House votes to authorize an inquiry, nobody is conducting a formal inquiry.\u201d", "description": "\"I do not see structural changes,\" said Rep.
