The bank attributed the decline to its decision to exit its equities business.\n\nAnalysts are looking for signs that Deutsche's exit from some business may have a knock-on effect to other business lines.\n\nRevenue at Deutsche's cash-cow bond-trading division dropped 13% in the third quarter, underscoring continued weakness at the German lender's investment bank.\n\nThat compares with a 10% rise in the third quarter for U.S. banks, according to Goldman Sachs.\n\nDeutsche, founded in 1870, is considered one of the most important banks for the global financial system, along with JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup.\n\nBut the German lender has faced a stream of losses and scandal, prompting it to embark on one of the biggest overhauls to an investment bank since the aftermath of the financial crisis.\n\nChief Executive Officer Christian Sewing noted the bank's four core divisions posted a pre-tax profit. \"These quarterly results are just an interim assessment, but they are encouraging,\" Sewing wrote to staff.\n\nThe initial reaction from some analysts less favorable, however.\n\n\"One has to look very hard to find anything positive in Deutsche Bank's results this quarter,\" said Octavio Marenzi, CEO of capital markets management consultancy Opimas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Tom Sims, Arno Schuetze, Patricia Uhlig and Hans Seidenstuecker; Editing by Michelle Martin and Lincoln Feast.)", "description": "Deutsche Bank  on Wednesday posted an 832 million euro  ($924.35 million) loss in the third quarter due to costs for a major restructuring and as income from its key bond trading division fell sharply.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MFLUOhLJoUahnsSbRnlBqg--~B/aD02MDA7dz03OTk7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/reuters.com/03e724bd452abf1786a1f6635471f784", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
