It reads in full, \u201cThe use, possession of, or association with tobacco, drugs, and/or alcohol at any time while being a member of the cheerleading team is prohibited. This includes weekends, holidays, and during the summer. An involvement in sexually-related behaviors and/or activities in a public forum, including parties or the Internet is prohibited. Violation of these will result in your removal from the squad. You are expected to comply with all rules of the school and district and laws of our community.\u201d\n\nWestwood High School, part of Round Rock Independent School District, confirmed that seven cheerleaders were removed for violating the code of conduct. Several had committed vaping violations, says the school, while other violations were undisclosed.\n\n\u201c...The violations relate to activities in the \u2018zero tolerance\u2019 category, including, but not limited to, vaping,\u201d read the district\u2019s statement to Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cParents have the option of asking for a grievance hearing if they believe the decision should be reviewed and at least four have done so at this point. Cheerleaders are certainly athletes, however the program is also considered a student leadership organization and standards do differ from those required of other athletic team members. All participants agree to abide by the code of conduct and are aware of the consequences when they begin the program. In fact, try-out criteria include a character component which considers behavior, attendance and teacher recommendations.\u201d\n\nThe punishment parallels other measures taken by school across the country to stamp out the use of e-cigarettes, a habit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) calls \u201cfatal.\u201d This week, the CDC declared on its website that 1,479 lung injury cases stemming from vaping (using an e-cigarette) have been reported from 49 states, with 33 deaths confirmed in 24 states.\n\nOn Oct. 11, the CDC published a report identifying a mysterious illness called EVALI (a.k.a., \u201ce-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury\u201d), which causes coughing, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.\n\nOne single cause of EVALI has not been identified, but experts are concerned about THC, the ingredient in marijuana that causes psychological effects. \u201cWe do know that THC is present in most of the samples tested by FDA to date, and most patients report a history of using THC-containing products,\u201d states the CDC. \u201cThe latest national and state findings suggest products containing THC, particularly those obtained off the street or from other informal sources (e.g. friends, family members, illicit dealers), are linked to most of the cases and play a major role in the outbreak.\u201d\n\nIn light of the health risks, the CDC advises: \u201cConsider refraining from use of all e-cigarette, or vaping, products.\u201d\n\nSchools have been taking the health warnings seriously, churning out extreme consequences for kids caught vaping. A high school in Alabama temporarily removed stall doors in the boy\u2019s bathroom, a popular place for daily vaping. According to television station WAFF, one student was even found passed out in a stall after using an e-cigarette.\n\nA school district in Texas changed its dress code, forcing kids to roll up the sleeves of their sweatshirts to prevent them from hiding e-cigarettes. Meanwhile, clothing company Vaprwear sells hoodies designed for discrete, \u201chands-free\u201d vaping.", "description": "The Texas school district removed several cheerleaders from the squad for \"vaping violations.\" Other schools across the country are struggling to stop teens from vaping.", "authors": ["Elise Sol\u00e9"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/j68GI3hvwdLqssjoKaivkQ--~B/aD00MDAwO3c9NjAxNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/6f1e8010-f123-11e9-b7df-a547f711d4f4", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
