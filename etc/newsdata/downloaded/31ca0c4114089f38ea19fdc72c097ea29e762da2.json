The mining business had turnover of R20bn in the 2018 financial year, according to the company\u2019s financial report, mostly from internal sales to Sasol\u2019s other operations.\n\nThe company is the world\u2019s biggest manufacturer of fuel from coal, an energy-intensive process. Sasol\u2019s coal mines produce about 40 million tons of coal a year, almost entirely for use in its own operations, according to its website.\n\nThe company would plan to sign a coal-purchase agreement with whoever buys the asset, said one of the people.\n\nSasol announced a long-term review process in November 2017 that would involve disposing of some assets at prices that ensure value for the company, it said in an emailed response to questions, while declining to comment directly on a possible mine sale.\n\n\u201cWe do not wish to comment at this stage on which assets have been earmarked for divestment, since they form a part of a disciplined and confidential M&A process,\u201d it said. \u201cSasol will update the market as and when appropriate regarding progress on the asset review process.\u201d\n\nThe mine sale plan comes as Sasol grapples with cost overruns and delays at its giant US chemicals project. Selling its coal mines may also help Sasol reduce its environmental liabilities at a time when more investors are focusing on how businesses affect climate change.\n\nThe Lake Charles chemical plant in Louisiana, which is starting up this year, will transform Sasol\u2019s production mix to focus on chemicals. Yet the company has lurched from one setback to the next, with the project now estimated to cost as much as $12.9bn, about 50% more than initially planned.\n\nSasol\u2019s shares have tumbled 48% in the past 12 months. Besides the cost overruns and startup delays, the company has also twice postponed its annual financial results while it completes an investigation into what went wrong at Lake Charles.\n\nThe company said in May it would accelerate the previously announced asset sale program. It said on Wednesday the company would \u201cproceed only if there is value for Sasol and we will not sell assets at sub-optimal prices.\u201d", "description": "The mining business had turnover of R20bn in the 2018 financial year.", "authors": ["Loni Prinsloo", "Paul Burkhardt"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5141/c6d9f11212334981a5f3a1447f8b0141.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
