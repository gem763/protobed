If you make a purchase by clicking one of our links, we may earn a small share of the revenue. However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA TODAY\u2019s newsroom and any business incentives.\n\nShopping for guys can be tricky business. Though \u201ctraditional\u201d men's gifts\u2014think neckties and whiskey stones\u2014seem like safe bets, in truth, men have a wide variety of tastes and those \u201csafe\u201d gifts rarely get real use.\n\nThis year, we\u2019ve got you covered with the best gift ideas for all the men in your life: the home chef, the student, the traveler, the gamer, the outdoorsy athlete, and plenty more. These are the best gifts for men of 2019, according to Reviewed:\n\n1. For the home cook: Philips Airfryer\n\nMake a healthier Thanksgiving dinner. (Photo: Philips)\n\nWhether it\u2019s game day or just a busy Wednesday, sometimes you just want something quick, easy, and delicious. Airfryers aren\u2019t the most health-conscious products in the world, but they do a good job of providing crispy food without the mess or hassle of frying in oil. This Philips model won our roundup of the best airfryers, excelling in most of our testing.\n\nWant something a little more adventurous? You could set this person up with a gift card to Home Chef, which won our roundup of the best meal kit delivery services, giving them tasty ready-to-make meals a few times a week.\n\nGet the Philips Airfryer at Amazon for $199.95\n\n2. For the podcast addict: Apple Airpods\n\nBest gifts for 2018: Apple Airpods (Photo: Reviewed / TJ Donegan)\n\nWe\u2019ve tested nearly every pair of headphones on the market, and Apple\u2019s Airpods have consistently been the top pick in our roundup of the best true wireless earbuds. They are incredibly easy to use with any Apple product, they sound great, they charge easily in the included carrying case, and they have absolutely zero wires. Best of all? They\u2019re actually cheaper than most of the competition\u2014rare for any Apple product.\n\nGet the Apple Airpods at Amazon for $144.00 ($15 off the list price)\n\n3. For the Netflix binge-watcher: Roku Ultra\n\nThe best gifts for men: Roku Ultra (Photo: Roku)\n\nIf you own a TV, you need a streaming box. The Roku Ultra (2018 edition) costs around half what the Apple TV costs, but it\u2019s easier to use, works with all the major streaming services, and supports new 4K and HDR TVs. The best trick? Just plug headphones into the remote for easy wireless listening. That\u2019s perfect for late-night streaming, no specialty headphones required.\n\nGet the Roku Ultra at Amazon for $69\n\n4. For the student: Asus Chromebook Flip C434\n\nThe best gifts for men: Asus Zenbook UX331UA Laptop (Photo: Asus)\n\nIf you\u2019re buying a laptop for a student (or anyone who needs a great laptop), the 13-inch Asus Chromebook Flip C434 is just about the best all-around option for the money. With its zippy performance, vibrant display, and chic aesthetic, the Asus Chromebook Flip can really walk the walk. Its performance is good enough for everyday tasks like surfing the web and checking email, and its bezels are practically nonexistent (meaning you\u2019re getting a ton of screen space). But what we like best is the sophisticated design. Need something to protect it? We recommend the Timbuk2 Authority Laptop Backpack ($129), a stylish and ultra-functional backpack anyone will love.\n\nGet the Asus Chromebook Flip C434 at Amazon for $539.99\n\n5. For the aspiring chef: Henckels Zwilling Pro 8-Inch Chef\u2019s Knife\n\nThe best gifts for men: Henckels Zwilling Pro 8-inch Chef's Knife (Photo: Henckels)\n\nAsk any chef or serious cook: an 8-inch Chef\u2019s Knife is a must-have. This Henckels model is almost universally praised by online shoppers and won our roundup of the best chef\u2019s knives, easily slicing through the competition in our testing. If you want something to go with it, I personally love the $50 Epicurean Gourmet Series cutting board, which is beautiful, functional, excelled in our testing, and is even dishwasher-safe.\n\nGet the Henckels Zwilling Pro 8-Inch Chef\u2019s Knife at Bed Bath & Beyond for $149.99 ($119.99 for BEYOND+ members)\n\n6. For the fashionable but cold: Canada Goose \"Lodge\" Down Hooded Jacket\n\nThe best gifts for men: Canada Goose Lodge Packable Windproof 750 Fill Power Down Hooded Jacket (Photo: Nordstrom)\n\nYes, it's possible to look good even when the temperatures drop below freezing. Canada Goose continues to be a favorite with our readers. The \"Lodge\" is a slightly thinner, more fitted alternative to the bulky jacket, but the 750-fill-power duck down will easily contend with blustery winter winds. Draw strings at the waist and hood help seal in the warmth.\n\nGet the Canada Goose \"Lodge\" Down Hooded Jacket at Nordstrom for $575\n\n7. For the tech-savvy: Amazon Echo Dot (3rd Gen)\n\nThe best gifts for men: Amazon Echo Dot (3rd Gen) (Photo: Amazon)\n\nAt Reviewed, we love voice-controlled smart speakers like the Amazon Echo, but the diminutive (and affordable) Echo Dot is a perfect way to bring that functionality to other rooms in your house. I use mine in the kitchen, where it\u2019s perfect for streaming music while I cook, setting timers, or entertaining my kids.\n\nGet the Amazon Echo Dot (3rd Gen) at Amazon for $49.99\n\n8. For the always prepared: Leatherman Wave Multitool\n\nThe best gifts for men: Leatherman Wave Multitool (Photo: Leatherman)\n\nEven if he doesn\u2019t need a multitool, most every guy wants one\u2014or at least to have one when the moment calls for it. The Leatherman Wave easily won our roundup of the best multitools. It looks great, offers impressive performance, has excellent user reviews, and comes with a 25-year warranty.\n\nIf you go this route, we also highly recommend picking up a pair of the best work gloves we\u2019ve tested: Carharrt Men\u2019s Grain Leather Work Gloves.\n\nGet the Leatherman Wave at Amazon for $117.95\n\n9. For the new homeowner: Logitech Circle 2 Indoor/Outdoor Camera\n\nThe best gifts for men: Logitech Circle 2 Indoor Security Camera (Photo: Logitech)\n\nAs someone who just got the keys to my first home, there\u2019s one thing I wish I had at all times: a wireless camera to keep an eye on things. The Logitech Circle 2 is the best pick, as it ran away with our roundup of the best smart indoor security cameras. It\u2019s affordable, easy to use, comes with free 24-hour storage, works indoors and out, and is compatible with Apple HomeKit, Alexa, and Google.\n\nGet the Logitech Circle 2 Indoor/Outdoor Security Camera at Amazon for $142.28\n\n10. For the well-traveled: Grafomap Custom Framed Map\n\nThe best gifts for men: Grafomap Custom Map (Photo: Grafomap)\n\nI\u2019m in love with these custom maps from Grafomap. Just put it in any location, move it around to frame it how you want, and you\u2019ll get a killer map in one of a number of eye-catching designs. You can customize the labels, get it framed, or have it printed directly onto canvas. Posters start at just $49 with framed versions costing $60 more\u2014way less than it\u2019ll cost to have anything custom framed at a store.\n\nGet a Custom Map Poster at Grafomap.com for $49\n\n11. For the movie aficionado: TCL 6 Series Roku TV\n\nThe best gifts for men: TCL Roku 6 Series TV (Photo: TCL)\n\nThe TCL 6 Series is simply jaw-dropping. It has 4K and HDR compatibility, awesome picture quality, and even Roku's streaming platform built right in. It\u2019s not only the best TV under $1,000 we\u2019ve tested this year, it\u2019s way under that limit. You can get a 55-inch model for just $650, and the 65-inch version is below the $1,000 mark too.\n\nGet the 55-inch TCL 6 Series Roku TV from Amazon for $529.99\n\n12. For the perpetually late: Skagen Signatur Watch\n\nThe best gifts for men: Skagen Signatur Brown Leather Watch (Photo: Skagen)\n\nSmart watches are fun and all, but a traditional wristwatch is still a timeless way to complete an outfit. This Skagen Signatur watch is simple, but pairs perfectly with casual and formal outfits. I own two Skagen watches myself and I wear them all the time. If you\u2019re buying for someone who likes a little more pizazz in their wardrobe, MVMT Watches also makes a huge array of stylish, affordable timepieces with great reviews.\n\nGet the Skagen Signatur Leather Watch from Skagen for $95\n\n13. For the frequent flyer: Sony 1000XM3 Noise Cancelling Headphones\n\nThe best gifts for men: Sony WH1000XM3 Headphones (Photo: Sony)\n\nWhile Bose\u2019s excellent Quiet Comfort headphones have owned the noise cancelling space for years, Sony is the new champ in town. Now widely regarded as the best all-around noise cancelling headphones you can get, the Sony 1000XM3s offer superb sound quality, cancel out ambient noise beautifully, and are supremely comfy for long flights, train rides, or just working at your desk.\n\nGet the Sony 1000XM3 Noise Cancelling Headphones at Amazon for $348\n\n14. For the avid reader: Amazon Kindle Paperwhite\n\nThe best gifts for men: Amazon Kindle Paperwhite (Photo: Amazon)\n\nAmazon has finally updated its best all-around Kindle with more storage, a more even backlight, a lighter and thinner design, and waterproofing. The Kindle Paperwhite was already the no-brainer choice for anyone who wants the best e-reader you can buy, and the newest updates just cement that reputation.\n\nGet the new Amazon Kindle Paperwhite at Amazon for $129.99\n\n15. For the guy who loves games: Nintendo Switch\n\nThe best gifts for men: Nintendo Switch (Photo: Nintendo)\n\nThe Nintendo Switch took a little time to get going, but it\u2019s been out awhile now and there is a long list of new and classic games available for it. Whether you\u2019re buying for a young gamer looking for family-friendly titles, a young person who wants to play the latest and greatest, or a classic gamer jonesing for a nostalgia fix, the Switch has it all.\n\nBuying for someone who already has a Switch? We highly recommend some newer games like Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening ($57.79), Super Smash Bros. Ultimate ($44.99), our favorite Switch case ($17.74), and the best USB battery backup we\u2019ve tested ($49.99) for extra battery life on the go.\n\nGet the Nintendo Switch at Amazon for $299\n\n16. For beards of all shapes and sizes: Wahl Clippers Beard Trimmer\n\nThe best gifts for men: Wahl Stainless Steel Beard Trimmer (Photo: Jess Rose Photography)\n\nThe Wahl Clippers Stainless Steel Beard Trimmer won our roundup of the best beard trimmers, with its top-notch battery life, trimming ability, and professional-quality build. It\u2019s not waterproof, but it is easy to keep clean, so if you\u2019re buying for someone with a beard, they\u2019ll appreciate this one.\n\nGet the Wahl Clippers Beard Trimmer at Amazon for $59.97\n\n17. For the gym rat: Herschel Supply Co. Novel Duffel\n\nThe best gifts for men: Herschel Supply Co. Novel Duffel (Photo: Herschel Supply Co.)\n\nDuffel bags are definitely the black sheep of the bag family\u2014that\u2019ll happen when you mostly stuff dirty, smelly things in them\u2014but they don\u2019t have to look bad. This Herschel Supply Co. duffel looks good enough you could bring it to the office, but it\u2019s functional enough to work as a daily gym bag or on as a day trip carry-on with necessary touches like a separate compartment where you can stash your shoes or smellier gear after a workout.\n\nGet the Herschel Supply Co. Novel. Duffel at Nordstrom for $63.74 (25% off)\n\n18. For the coffee lover: SterlingPro Double Wall French Press\n\nThe best gifts for men: Sterling Pro Double Wall French Press (Photo: Sterling Pro)\n\nIf you\u2019re buying for someone who really loves coffee, the Sterling Double Wall French Press is perfect. It is double insulated so it keeps coffee nice and hot, it looks fantastic, it works for everything from frothed milk to hot chocolate, it's dishwasher safe, and it's the best French press we've ever tested. Best of all, it\u2019s about a third the price of many other stainless steel French presses, meaning it\u2019ll feel like your gift cost way more than it actually does.\n\nGet the SterlingPro Double Wall French Press at Amazon for $35.98\n\n19. For those who always put off cleaning: Ecovacs Deebot N79S\n\nThe best gifts for men: Deebot Ecovacs N79S (Photo: Deebot)\n\nRobot vacuums aren\u2019t enough to keep your whole place clean, but they do a good job of keeping it looking neat on days where you just don\u2019t have the time. This model from Ecovacs did well in our testing and it has some fancier features like compatibility with both Alexa and Google Assistant, customizable schedules, and a \u201cmax mode\u201d that increases cleaning power temporarily\u2014all despite being one of the more affordable robot vacuums around.\n\nGet the Ecovacs Deebot N79S at Amazon for $199.99\n\n20. For the music lover: Sonos One SL Wireless Speaker\n\nThe best gifts for men: Sonos One SL (Photo: Sonos)\n\nPeople adore their Sonos systems, and the Sonos One SL is the best way to get in on the act. Just a single One SL can fill a room with beautiful music that is so, so much nicer than what you get from basic smart speakers like the Amazon Echo. The One SL can stream from all the most popular music services, works with Alexa, and can even be paired with a second One SL for wireless stereo sound.\n\nGet the Sonos One SL at Amazon for $179\n\n21. For athletes and fitness addicts: Fitbit Charge 3\n\nThe best gifts for men: Fitbit Charge 3 Fitness Watch (Photo: Fitbit)\n\nWhether you\u2019re buying for a hardcore athlete or someone just trying to get up off the couch more, the Fitbit Charge 3 is the way to go in our opinion. It has 7-day battery life, activity tracking, a heart-rate monitor, and sleep tracking, as well as one of the better apps of any other smart fitness tracking watch.\n\nBuying for someone truly hardcore? The Garmin Forerunner 235 offers much better activity and heart rate tracking as well as GPS for tracking your runs.\n\nGet the Fitbit Charge 3 Fitness Tracker at Amazon for $139.95\n\n22. For the guy who wants a drone: Potensic T25\n\nThe best gifts for men: Potensic T25 Drone (Photo: Potensic)\n\nMost high-quality drones will cost you $500 and up, which can be pricey if you aren\u2019t sure you are going to get a lot of use out of it. The Potensix T25 is our favorite drone under $200, making it an awesome way to practice flying (and crashing), without spending a ton of money. Despite the price, you\u2019re still getting an included 1080p camera and smart features like hovering, decent battery life, and a \u201cFollow Me\u201d mode.\n\nGet the Potensix T25 at Amazon for $169.99\n\n23. For the guy constantly traveling: Samsonite Flexis Softside Luggage with Spinner Wheels\n\nThe best gifts for men: Samsonite Flexis Softside Luggage (Photo: Reviewed / Seamus Bellamy)\n\nOur top-rated carry-on luggage, the Samsonite Flexis 21\" Spinner features tough, nimble wheels that should last for years of hard use. It offers 2,520 cubic inches of packing space. The inside of the suitcase boasts a large open area with elastic retention straps for securing your clothes or packing cubes into place, as well as mesh stash pockets for organizing smaller items. On the inside of the bag\u2019s lid, you\u2019ll find a zippered, mesh compartment that\u2019s perfect for jamming socks or underwear in. We were particularly impressed with the self-healing YKK Strong Grip Zip. If one of the bag\u2019s zippers gets messed up (but doesn\u2019t break), zipping and unzipping it should make it as good as new.\n\nGet the Samsonite Flexis 21\" Spinner at Amazon for $121.61\n\n24. For guys who love a hot sauce kick: The Good Hurt Fuego Hot Sauce Sampler Pack\n\nThe best gifts for men: The Good Hurt Fuego Hot Sauce Pack (Photo: The Good Hurt)\n\nWith 7 different flavors of hot sauce and a clever packaging design, this sampler pack from Thoughtfully is a standout gift idea for any guy.
