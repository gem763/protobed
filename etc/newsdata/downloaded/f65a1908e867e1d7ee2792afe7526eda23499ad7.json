I didn\u2019t want to stay for just one or two more years, I wanted to commit my future to Arsenal and the club wanted me to do the same.\n\n\u2018You can go through difficult times, like this, but that is no reason to run away and I\u2019m not going to. I\u2019m here until at least 2021.\n\n\u2018I said that Arsene Wenger was a big factor in me joining Arsenal \u2014 and he was \u2014 but ultimately I signed for the club. Even when Arsene announced he was leaving, I wanted to stay because I love playing for Arsenal and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve been here for six years.\n\n\u2018When I moved from Real Madrid, it was a really tough time for Arsenal. But I always believed in what we could do and together we delivered. More recently things have been difficult and a lot has changed. But I\u2019m proud to be an Arsenal player, a fan and I\u2019m happy here. Whenever people see me in the street I always say, \u2018This is my home\u2019. I\u2019m going nowhere.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmery was influential in Arsenal\u2019s decision to withdraw a contract offer to Aaron Ramsey worth around \u00a3200,000-a-week and he remains keen to cut the club\u2019s wage bill.\n\nThe Spaniard effectively utilised a budget of just \u00a345m last summer to bring in the likes of David Luiz, Nicolas Pepe and Dani Ceballos.\n\nMORE: Paul Ince slams Declan Rice\u2019s \u2018ridiculous\u2019 \u00a380m valuation amid Manchester United transfer rumours", "description": "Arsenal playmaker Mesut Ozil insists he'll see out his current deal with the club and will not be leaving the Gunners in January.
