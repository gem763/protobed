(Virgin Galactic Photo / Courtney Crow)\n\nLike the rocket plane it operates, Virgin Galactic\u2019s stock price blasted off on its first day as a publicly traded company, and then glided to a somewhat lower altitude.\n\nThe company, founded 15 years ago by British billionaire Richard Branson, now bills itself as the \u201cworld\u2019s first and only publicly traded commercial human spaceflight company.\u201d It went public today thanks to a merger with a special-purpose vehicle known as Social Capital Hedosophia, or SCH.\n\nSCH took on a 49% share of the merged company, which is known as Virgin Galactic Holdings and traded on the New York Stock Exchange as SPCE. Branson and other shareholders in the pre-merger Virgin Galactic retained a controlling share of 51%. The company was valued at $1.5 billion at the time of the merger. SCH\u2019s CEO, venture investor Chamath Palihapitiya, is investing another $100 million in the enterprise.\n\nDuring today\u2019s trading, share prices rose by as much as 9.7%, compared with the $11.79 value for final trading before the merger on Friday. By the end of today\u2019s trading, the price settled down to $11.75, marking a smidgen of a loss for the day. Trading volume amounted to more than 12.5 million shares.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, the value of SCH\u2019s shares had been rising over the past few weeks in anticipation of the merger.\n\nSince its founding as a privately held company, Virgin Galactic has been working on a launch system that includes its WhiteKnightTwo carrier airplane and the SpaceShipTwo rocket plane.\n\nThe first SpaceShipTwo, dubbed VSS Enterprise, broke up during a rocket-powered test flight in 2014, killing one test pilot and severely injuring the other. The second SpaceShipTwo, VSS Unity, has successfully passed the 50-mile space milestone twice during tests at California\u2019s Mojave Air and Space Port.\n\nOperations are now transitioning to Spaceport America in New Mexico, and the current schedule calls for commercial flights to the edge of space to begin in 2020. More than 600 \u201cFuture Astronauts\u201d have made reservations at a cost of as much as $250,000 a seat. Branson says he\u2019ll be on the first commercial flight.\n\nBranson, who has big plans for point-to-point suborbital spaceflights using a worldwide network of spaceports, rang the NYSE\u2019s opening bell and flashed a thumbs-up to kick off today\u2019s trading.\n\nAfterward, he hailed the market milestone on CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk on the Street.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the public want to dabble a little bit in a spaceship company, own a little bit of a spaceship company, they can now do so,\u201d he said.\n\nVirgin Galactic CEO George T. Whitesides was more businesslike about the value proposition in a prepared statement.\n\n\u201cFor the first time, anyone will have the opportunity to invest in a human spaceflight company that is transforming the market,\u201d Whitesides said. \u201cVirgin Galactic has been working tirelessly to turn the concept of human spaceflight into reality, and our IP and engineering skills alongside the talent we have in our business makes us confident and excited about our future.\u201d\n\nVirgin Galactic\u2019s main competitor in the suborbital human spaceflight market is Blue Origin, the privately held space venture founded by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. Blue Origin has been conducting uncrewed flight tests of its New Shepard suborbital spacecraft for the past four years. The company hasn\u2019t yet set a ticket price, and it\u2019s not yet taking reservations, but Bezos and other executives say New Shepard will start flying people next year.\n\nIn recent years, Virgin Galactic spun off The Spaceship Company, which builds the WhiteKnightTwo and SpaceShipTwo planes; and Virgin Orbit, which is working on an air-launch system to put spacecraft in orbit. The Spaceship Company is part of Virgin Galactic\u2019s go-public plan, but Virgin Orbit isn\u2019t.\n\nOther major players in the long-term human spaceflight market include publicly traded Boeing and privately held SpaceX, which are building space taxis for NASA\u2019s use and plan to take on private customers as well. This month, Boeing\u2019s venture capital arm committed to investing $20 million in Virgin Galactic Holdings.\n\nMore from GeekWire:", "description": "Like the rocket plane it operates, Virgin Galactic's stock price blasted off on its first day as a publicly traded company, and then glided to a somewhat lower altitude.
