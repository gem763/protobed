Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez following a televised town-hall event in the Bronx , N.Y., March 29, 2019. (Jeenah Moon/Reuters)\n\nRepresentative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., NY) told supporters during a town hall in Queens on Thursday that impeachment proceedings against President Trump were \u201cboring\u201d and distracted from the goal of \u201csocial and economic and racial justice in the United States of America.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe should have been impeached a long time ago. I\u2019m over it. And so that\u2019s how I feel about it because we\u2019ve got work to do,\u201d she said, before going on to argue that \u201cimpeachment of this president is the short-term action we need to preserve our democracy, but if we are really going to thrive as a country, we need to make long-term investments.\u201d\n\nOcasio-Cortez, who has long been an advocate of impeaching the president, also pushed back against allegations of misconduct by House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), who apparently learned of the whistleblower complaint before it was filed, according to a New York Times report.\n\n\u201cAll of this is in complete compliance with whistleblower laws, and there\u2019s nothing out of the norm from that,\u201d she said. \u201cThis whistleblower followed all of the laws and protocols that we have established for whistleblowing and followed all the proper channels. The threat was vetted. It was passed on by the inspector general.\u201d\n\nThe night was marked by an incident involving an apparent stunt pulled by a member of the pro-Trump LaRouche group, who demanded in a comment that people need to \u201cstart eating babies\u201d to combat climate change.\n\n\u201cWe only have a few months left. I love that you support the Green New Deal, but getting rid of fossil fuel is not gonna solve the problem fast enough,\u201d the woman ranted, as Ocasio-Cortez remained calm before giving a measured response.\n\n\u201cWe do need to hit net zero in several years,\u201d the congresswoman said. \u201cBut I think we all need to understand that there are a lot of solutions that we have, that we can pursue. And that if we act in a positive way, there is space for hope. We are never beyond hope.\u201d", "description": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has said she finds impeachment \"boring\" and wants to focus on social and economic justice.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Andrew C.
