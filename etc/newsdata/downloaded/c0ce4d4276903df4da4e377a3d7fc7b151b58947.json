He was dismissive of both.\n\n\u201cIf it were about science it would be led by scientists rather than by politicians and a mentally ill Swedish child who is being exploited by her parents and by the international left,\u201d Knowles said.\n\nThe commentator Christopher Hahn, appearing on The Story to theoretically offer a liberal perspective, immediately criticized Knowles.\n\n\u201cYeah, I mean, you\u2019re a grown man and you\u2019re attacking a child. Shame on you,\u201d Hahn said.\n\nA Fox News spokesperson subsequently told the Daily Beast: \u201cThe comment made by Michael Knowles who was a guest on The Story tonight was disgraceful. We apologize to Greta Thunberg and to our viewers.\u201d\n\nFox News told the Hollywood Reporter it had \u201cno plans\u201d to book Knowles as a guest in the future.\n\nThe channel has not commented on Laura Ingraham\u2019s attack on Thunberg.\n\nIngraham used her show The Ingraham Angle to suggest, incorrectly, that Thunberg wanted people to \u201ccede control of our economy, our way of life, our way of transport, how many children you want to have, and if we don\u2019t go along, we will be punished by our own children.\n\n\u201cDoes anyone else find that chilling?\u201d Ingraham said.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait for Stephen King\u2019s sequel, Children of the Climate.\u201d\n\nKing\u2019s fictional story The Children of the Corn focuses on a group of children in a remote town who believe anyone over the age of 19 should be killed.\n\nCurtis Ingraham, Laura Ingraham\u2019s brother, swiftly criticized his sister, suggesting that her rightwing pronouncements were motivated by financial gain.\n\nHe said: \u201cClearly my sister\u2019s paycheck is more important than the world her three adopted kids will inherit.\n\n\u201cI can no longer apologize for a sibling who I no longer recognize. I can and will continue to call out the monstrous behavior and the bully commentary born out of anger.\u201d", "description": "Network says it has no plans to book Michael Knowles in future after rightwing commentator referred to \u2018mentally ill Swedish child\u2019", "authors": ["Adam Gabbatt"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29086ee3ca0b37909ca4ccc0a0c821efb1377d8e/321_0_1911_1147/master/1911.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9bfe2a8865d19918f82043f4d3b513d9", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
