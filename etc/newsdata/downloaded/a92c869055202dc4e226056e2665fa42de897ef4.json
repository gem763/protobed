(CBC)\n\nIn the open letter, the student groups said the apology did not go far enough.\n\n\"While the central administration maintains that 'racism has no place on our campus,' implicit and explicit racist attitudes, actions, and aggression continue to occur at our institution,\" reads the letter.\n\n\"The central administration's response to an isolated incident fails to address systemic racism in a meaningful way.\"\n\nThey want a direct apology to the two students who were carded and an apology that recognizes systemic issues on campus.\n\nThe school has brought in new interim policies that say carding should only happen in the rarest of cases, but the student groups want more clarity, including strict rules for private security on campus.\n\nThey also want all faculty and staff to be forced to take anti-racism training and for the school to begin collecting race-based data to be able to put hard numbers to the issue.\n\nFr\u00e9mont also announced he would form a discrimination-free campus committee.\n\nThe student groups want a seat at that table, beyond the school's promise to recruit three racialized students for it.\n\n\"We urge the administration to make the appropriate acts of reconciliation that respond to racialized students' concerns. The University of Ottawa must do better,\" reads the letter.\n\nThe student groups are holding a press conference on the issue Tuesday at 10 a.m.", "description": "Student groups are calling out the University of Ottawa\u2019s response to two carding incidents, saying the school\u2019s administration is not doing enough to address systemic racism on campus.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5148153.1558702752!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/university-of-ottawa-generic-stock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
