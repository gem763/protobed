During his remarks, he discussed the political path forward for the GOP, taking on 2020 Democrat candidates and new administration policies.\n\nIn a moment of jest, the President took on \"energy efficient\" light bulbs and joked about how they always \"make him look orange.\"\n\n\"The light's no good, I always look orange.\"@realDonaldTrump jokes about his skin tone at the GOP Member's Retreat in Baltimore. pic.twitter.com/PUR5ObYBhk \u2014 Washington Examiner (@dcexaminer) September 13, 2019\n\nThe Trump administration recently loosened regulations and bans on incandescent light bulbs implemented during the Bush administration.\n\nIn typical fashion, the leftist media is taking his statement literally and running fact checks.\n\nFrom the Washington Post:\n\nThe comment drew laughs from the audience, though it was not immediately clear whether the president meant it in jest or in earnest. The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\n\n\nIt is true that bulbs have different light temperatures, but the effect this has on someone\u2019s complexion is typically not very significant, said Jocelyn Augustino, a D.C.-based freelance photographer.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen you go into a family\u2019s house, just because there are tungsten lights, I don\u2019t think you look around the room and think everyone looks orange,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nIn situations where the president is being photographed or filmed, professional photographers will know to adjust the white balance so that it is accurate to what is being seen in person, she added. \u201cIt\u2019s video or photo 101.\u201d\n\n\n\nTamzin Smith, a portrait photographer in Rockville, Md., pointed out that Trump\u2019s orange complexion is visible even when he is photographed against white backgrounds. If bulbs were responsible for casting a warm glow, anything white in a photo of the president \u2014 including the background, a white shirt, or even his teeth \u2014 should also be orange.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou can see that even when his teeth are white, his skin is orangey-red,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not the lighting.\u201d\n\nTrump blamed energy-saving bulbs for making him look orange.\n\n\n\nExperts say probably not. https://t.co/PU6REk5QLJ \u2014 The Washington Post (@washingtonpost) September 13, 2019\n\nFrom CNN:\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Thursday evening claimed that energy efficient light bulbs make him look orange, one in a series of bizarre claims about green energy and climate conservation in remarks to Republican House members in Baltimore.\n\nPresident Trump on Thursday evening claimed that energy efficient light bulbs make him look orange. https://t.co/riozr6dBc9 \u2014 CNN (@CNN) September 13, 2019\n\nIt was a joke, people!", "description": ".09/13/2019 21:41:40PM EST.", "authors": ["Katie Pavlich", "Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/238/8f38c309-c338-417a-8f54-fa880fa361de.png", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
