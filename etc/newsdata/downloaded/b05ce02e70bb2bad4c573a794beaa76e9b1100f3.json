(Anna Moneymaker/The New York Times)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 House Democrats have resigned themselves to the likelihood that impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump will extend into the Christmas season, as they plan a series of public hearings intended to make the simplest and most devastating possible public case in favor of removing Trump.\n\nDemocratic leaders had hoped to move as soon as Thanksgiving to wrap up a narrow inquiry focused around Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, buoyed by polling data that shows that the public supports the investigation, even if voters are not yet sold on impeaching the president.\n\nBut after a complicated web of damaging revelations about the president has emerged from private depositions unfolding behind closed doors, Democratic leaders have now begun plotting a full-scale \u2014 and probably more time-consuming \u2014 effort to lay out their case in a set of high-profile public hearings on Capitol Hill.\n\nTheir goal is to convince the public \u2014 and if they can, more Republicans \u2014 that the president committed an impeachable offense when he demanded that Ukraine investigate his political rivals.\n\n\u201cJust the facts, baby,\u201d said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus. \u201cIf we tell that story with simplicity and repetition, the American people will understand why the president must be held accountable. If we don\u2019t, then there is great uncertainty, and in that vacuum Donald Trump may find himself escaping accountability again.\u201d\n\nTrump, increasingly embittered by the impeachment inquiry, complained Monday that Republicans were not defending him aggressively enough.\n\n\u201cRepublicans have to get tougher and fight,\u201d Trump said during a rambling, hourlong question-and-answer session with reporters at a Cabinet meeting. \u201cWe have some that are great fighters, but they have to get tougher and fight, because the Democrats are trying to hurt the Republican Party for the election, which is coming up, where we\u2019re doing very well.\u201d\n\nThe president belittled Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, one of the few members of his party who has signaled he may be open to impeaching Trump, underscoring how anxious the senator\u2019s defection has made him about possible cracks in support from his own party.\n\nLaunching into a series of attacks on Democrats, Trump said approvingly that they were \u201cvicious and they stick together. They don\u2019t have Mitt Romney in their midst \u2014 they don\u2019t have people like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey stick together,\u201d Trump added. \u201cYou never see them break off.\u201d\n\nIt was the second time in two days that he has complained about a lack of support from Republicans.\n\n\u201cWhen do the Do Nothing Democrats pay a price for what they are doing to our Country, & when do the Republicans finally fight back?\u201d Trump tweeted late Sunday night.\n\nThe president\u2019s allies on Capitol Hill tried Monday to ramp up their defense of the president by forcing a vote in the House to censure Rep. Adam B. Schiff, D-Calif., who is leading the impeachment inquiry as the chairman of the Intelligence Committee. The vote, which failed in the Democratic-led chamber, was a display of Republican solidarity for Trump.\n\nThere are risks for Democrats in the longer timeline, which could make it more difficult for lawmakers in politically competitive districts who fear a backlash from constituents if they appear to be preoccupied with targeting Trump instead of addressing major issues such as gun safety or health care.\n\nAnd Democrats are all too aware that Trump has succeeded in the past in steering the subject away from allegations of misconduct on his part, as he did with the investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election conducted by special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nThis time, Democratic leaders hope to deny him the opportunity.\n\nThey have issued subpoenas to a growing cast of characters, including Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s private lawyer who is at the center of the Ukraine pressure campaign, and have demanded documents from Vice President Mike Pence. They have invited or compelled Trump administration officials past and present to appear at the Capitol before rolling television cameras, and cloistered them behind closed doors to extract a daily drip of testimony that backs up their case.\n\nThat effort continues Tuesday when William B. Taylor Jr., the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, is scheduled to testify behind closed doors about text messages in which he wrote to other officials that it was \u201ccrazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d On Wednesday, investigators will question Laura Cooper, a Pentagon official, about decisions to hold up Ukraine\u2019s military aid.", "description": "WASHINGTON -- House Democrats have resigned themselves to the likelihood that impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump will extend into the Christmas season, as they plan a series of public hearings intended to make the simplest and most devastating possible public case in favor of removing", "authors": ["Michael D.
