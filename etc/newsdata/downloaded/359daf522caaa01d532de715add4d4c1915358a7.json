As a native Clevelander who lived through the madness in real time, I am cursed with the memory of the questionable decisions my city made in a fit of panic. One decision in particular haunts me above the rest: when local celebrities and politicians decided to shamelessly beg LeBron to stay using, I\u2019m sorry to say, a \u201cWe Are the World\u201d parody entitled \u201cWe Are LeBron.\u201d\n\nIt \u2026 did not work.\n\nSee, Cleveland was not exactly known for having the best luck with sports. But what Cleveland did have was LeBron James. This is a man so good at basketball that he singlehandedly gave the city a chance of winning its first major-league championship since 1964. And Cleveland loved LeBron for that. A multistory banner of him hung downtown \u2014 arms outstretched like Sports Jesus watching over his city, as if to say, \u201cHush, my children. I will bring you your championship. Oh, yes.\u201d And we believed him. Much like Gollum, he craved the ring, and he was determined to bring the team to victory. But absent a contract to keep him on the Cavs, everyone knew LeBron\u2019s odds of actually getting that ring would be far greater if he deserted Cleveland for a team with, like, at least one other decent player. Faced with the reality that Cleveland might lose its star, and taking the phrase \u201cdesperate times call for desperate measures\u201d a bit too literally, \u201cWe Are LeBron\u201d was born.\n\nIt\u2019s been almost ten years since the fateful day \u201cWe Are LeBron\u201d debuted, and I\u2019m still no closer to understanding how it happened. I have so many questions, namely: Why \u201cWe Are the World\u201d? Maybe, if we had used an iconic charity single originally recorded by a supergroup of artists pleading for world peace to stay on our basketball team in an ironic way, it would have been hilarious. Maybe. Unfortunately, \u201cWe Are LeBron\u201d was deeply, devastatingly, cringe-inducingly sincere.\n\nIn the video, local news anchors stood with local politicians and local commercial stars to make their plea to LeBron: You can\u2019t leave. We need you. Nobody will love you more than we do. It\u2019s a level of desperation that would be lazy and offensively over-the-top coming from an ex-girlfriend in a rom-com; from a group of real people with autonomy, it\u2019s just upsetting. Ted Strickland, then-governor of Ohio, stands next to local weatherman Dick Goddard to belt out an off-tempo \u201cPlease stay LeBron, we really need you.\u201d Less than six months later, Ted Strickland lost his reelection bid to John Kasich and Ohio gubernatorial elections have been dominated by Republicans ever since. Tim Misny, a Cleveland celebrity famous for his local lawyer commercials featuring the catchphrase \u201cI\u2019ll make them pay,\u201d gets a lower-third graphic during his close-up that reads: \u201cIntimidating TV Lawyer.\u201d It feels like a half-hearted attempt at a joke from the poor sucker tasked with editing the video together, but it\u2019s too late \u2014 at this point, all I can do is concentrate on the fact that they thought the TV commercial lawyer singing to LeBron might change his mind.\n\nI routinely pore over the video. I examine the faces for traces of regret. I try to imagine what they\u2019re thinking. Are they wondering, as they should be, \u201cHow did I get here?\u201d At the two minutes and three seconds mark, there\u2019s footage of Senator Sherrod Brown, who at least had enough good sense to not physically be present, singing from his Senate office. I\u2019d swear it was hostage footage. You can\u2019t say the man never sacrificed anything for his constituents; there was certainly no foreseeable PR benefit to participating. If anything, it was politically harmful, and the look on the senator\u2019s face said he knew as much. (To be fair, Sherrod Brown has been reelected twice since appearing in the video, and I\u2019m convinced the one thing that saved him was having the good sense to only participate remotely.)\n\nIn the end, LeBron did leave Cleveland. But four years later, he returned. In true third-act fashion, he\u2019d realized a win didn\u2019t mean as much if it didn\u2019t happen in his hometown. In 2016, he broke Cleveland\u2019s curse and won the city its championship. In 2018, I moved to L.A., and six months later, LeBron followed. (Obsessed much?) Luckily, his second move was accepted far more gracefully, and no song or dance was involved. Nonetheless, \u201cWe Are LeBron\u201d remains at the forefront of my mind to this day.", "description": "Cleveland, sing-begging is not a good look.", "authors": ["Brittany Van Horne"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/12/12-ITATAL-Lebron.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
