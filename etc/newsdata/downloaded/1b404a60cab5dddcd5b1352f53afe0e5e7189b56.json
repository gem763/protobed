said it was unlikely Mr Trump would engage with other representatives on how to deal with the climate crisis in any case, but the move to create a different event scheduled for the same time has proved provocative.\n\nMary Robinson, the former Irish president said: \u201cHe won\u2019t go to the climate summit and he wants the distraction factor, I suppose.\u201d\n\nA statement from the White House press secretary said Mr Trump would be introduced by Vice President Mike Pence at the event on protecting religious freedom, an issue that is considered important to the president\u2019s Christian voter base.\n\n\u201cThe President is working to broaden international support for ongoing efforts to protect religious freedom in the wake of increasing persecution of people on the basis of their beliefs and a growing number of attacks on and destruction of houses of worship by state and non-state actors,\u201d a spokesperson said.\n\nThe summit also follows global climate change protests in which millions of schoolchildren and protesters around the world took to the streets in what is believed to be the largest climate protest in history.\n\nStudents in more than 150 countries skipped school to join an estimated 2,500 protests in a bid to persuade governments to combat spiralling greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nUN secretary-general Antonio Guterres has urged countries to up their climate efforts and told leaders \u201cnot to come with fancy speeches, but with concrete commitments\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cPeople want solutions, commitments and action. I expect there will be an announcement and unveiling of a number of meaningful plans on dramatically reducing emissions during the next decade, and on reaching carbon neutrality by 2050.\u201d\n\nMore than 30 heads of state and government have signed an appeal for greater action to fight climate change circulated by Alexander Van der Bellen, Australia\u2019s president, ahead of next week\u2019s conference on global warming at the UN.\n\nHowever, the Trump administration seems to be going in the opposite direction.\n\nLast month Mr Trump announced plans to revoke Obama-era regulations designed to prevent hazardous methane leaks from oil and gas drilling operations.\n\nReports say Mr Trump also wants to tear down Clinton-era legislation to open up more than half of the world\u2019s largest intact temperate rainforest in Alaska, to potential logging, energy and mining projects.", "description": "Donald Trump will miss key climate summit talks at the United Nations on Monday in favour of chairing his own meeting on religious freedom, according to a UN official.
