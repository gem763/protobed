Douglas called \u2018the marketplace of ideas,\u2019\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe presumption has always been that the marketplace would offer a level playing field. But in the age of social media, that landscape is neither level nor fair.\u201d\n\nMr. Stengel argued in favor of hate speech laws that penalize insults against people on the basis of race, religion, ethnic origin and sexual orientation.\n\n\u201cAll speech is not equal,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd where truth cannot drive out lies, we must add new guardrails. I\u2019m all for protecting \u2018thought that we hate,\u2019 but not speech that incites hate. It undermines the very values of a fair marketplace of ideas that the First Amendment is designed to protect.\u201d\n\nMr. Stengel\u2019s op-ed has been widely criticized by free speech advocates, with his tweet promoting the piece having racked up thousands of replies and only a handful of shares and likes on Twitter. He later tweeted that he was happy conservative outlets like Fox News were joining in the debate surrounding hate speech.\n\nMy @WashingtonPost piece on why the very broadness of the First Amendment suggests we should have a hate speech law. And if we did, why the President might be in violation of it. https://t.co/3ybv3kC69f \u2014 Richard Stengel (@stengel) October 29, 2019\n\nHappy to have @FoxNews join the debate around hate speech. This is the virtue of Constitutional protections for free speech. Not so sure about those protections for hate speech. But, heck, let\u2019s debate. https://t.co/Ew8TbBb8zw #FoxNews \u2014 Richard Stengel (@stengel) October 30, 2019\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
