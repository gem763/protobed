(Hilary Swift/The New York Times)\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 Gregory Rodriguez thought he had the flu when he went to the emergency room Sept. 18, feeling feverish, nauseated and short of breath.\n\nHe woke up four days later in a different hospital, with a tube down his throat connecting him to a ventilator, and two more tubes in his neck and groin, running his blood through a device that pumped in oxygen and took out carbon dioxide. The machines were doing the job of his lungs, which had stopped working.\n\n\u201cI was basically on the verge of death,\u201d he said.\n\nRodriguez, 22, a college student, is one of the nearly 1,300 people in the United States who have become seriously ill because of vaping. Like him, about 70% are young men. And also like him, many vaped THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana.\n\nVaping is odorless and easy to hide, and Rodriguez slipped into doing it constantly, inhaling enormous amounts of THC and craving more. He decided to talk about it in the hope that his story might be a warning to other people under the false impression that vaping is safe.\n\n\u201cI want people to stay as far away as they can from vapes, especially THC vapes,\u201d he said.\n\nLung illnesses linked to vaping were first recognized during the summer. The exact cause is still unknown. Toxic chemicals released from vaping fluids, or from the battery-powered vaping devices themselves, are among the suspects.\n\nSo far, 29 deaths have been reported. The youngest to die was a 17-year-old boy from the Bronx.\n\nThe lung damage looks like a chemical burn, the kind of injury caused by industrial accidents or the mustard gas used as a weapon in World War I, according to researchers at the Mayo Clinic.\n\nSo far, no vaping product is in the clear.\n\nRodriguez said he started smoking marijuana toward the end of high school. He has struggled with anxiety and depression, and marijuana, he said, \u201cgave me some relief.\u201d\n\nBut the smell gave him away, and his parents would not allow it in the two-bedroom apartment he shares with them and his older brother in Jamaica, Queens.\n\nAfter about two years, friends suggested that he try vaping THC. He ordered a few vaping devices from Amazon and found local THC dealers.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re in college, you always know somebody who knows a guy,\u201d he said.\n\nHe would text a dealer, and they would meet, usually in the dealer\u2019s car. A cartridge holding a gram of THC oil cost $40, which Rodriguez would pay in cash, money he had earned from a part-time maintenance job at Kennedy Airport.\n\nVaping THC was \u201clike a miracle,\u201d he said. The high came on faster and felt more intense than when he smoked marijuana. Best of all, he said, \u201cIt was discreet.\u201d\n\nThere was no odor, so he could vape in his room, at school, on the street, just about anywhere, and no one would know. The device was small enough to hide in his hand. He also thought vapor would be safer for his lungs than marijuana smoke, even though it sometimes made him cough violently.\n\nVaping made it easy to take in more and more THC. When he smoked marijuana, a joint or blunt or pipe lasted only so long. But with a THC cartridge, he could vape for hours, with no need to roll a new joint or reload a pipe.\n\nEventually, Rodriguez was vaping much of the time. \u201cI was never without it,\u201d he said. His favorites included flavors like Fruity Pebbles and Sour Patch Kids. The few times he ran out, he could think about nothing but getting more, and sometimes, one of his legs would start shaking. A cartridge that would last most people four or five days, he would finish in a day or two.\n\n\u201cIt was a habit, an addiction,\u201d he said.\n\nIt is possible to become addicted to marijuana or dependent on it, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n\nA computer-science student, he explored the dark web to find THC vendors with lower prices than he paid on the street and turned money from his bank account into Bitcoin, to make purchases that would be encrypted and untraceable. On the electronic order forms, he requested the best and strongest THC available.\n\nBoxes of cartridges, 25 for $400, started arriving in the mail early last summer. The return address was a house on a residential street in Ventura, California.\n\nThe products had a variety of labels, including Dank Vapes, the same name reported by many other people who got sick. It is not actually a brand, but a label that sellers can put on any product. Some of the other cartridges may have been counterfeit versions of brands that are legal in some states. No one knows what is in the knockoff products or who makes them, health officials say.", "description": "NEW YORK -- Gregory Rodriguez thought he had the flu when he went to the emergency room Sept. 18, feeling feverish, nauseated and short of breath.He woke up four days later in a different hospital, with a tube down his throat connecting him to a ventilator, and two more tubes in his neck and groin, running", "authors": ["Denise Grady"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Wdy70tN_iEV9sxHxiy1AlA--~B/aD0yNDAwO3c9MzYwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/3a6e98922a755998d390873a06c24dc6", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
