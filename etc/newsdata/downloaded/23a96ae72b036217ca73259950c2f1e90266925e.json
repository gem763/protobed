The investigation relates to the Trump Organization\u2019s role in alleged hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels, as well as other matters.\n\nThe justices are under no obligation to hear the case or to schedule it as the parties request. However, a request from a sitting president would likely get close attention from the high court. While a case heard by the Supreme Court this term would likely be decided by June, a case heard in the following term would almost certainly not be decided until after the election.\n\nTrump filed suit in federal district court in New York last month in a bid to block the grand jury subpoena. The judge assigned to the case dismissed the suit, ruling that he had no jurisdiction to intervene in a state court proceeding.\n\nTrump then appealed that decision to the 2nd Circuit. A three-judge panel, all of whom were appointed by Democratic presidents, is set to hear 40 minutes of arguments on the subject Wednesday morning.\n\nAt least three other disputes related to Trump\u2019s financial records are also pending in the courts and could, potentially, make their way to the Supreme Court.\n\nEarlier this month, a panel of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals voted, 2-1, to reject a suit Trump brought to block the same accounting firm from complying with a subpoena the House Oversight Committee issued in April. Trump\u2019s attorneys could ask the full bench of the D.C. Circuit to rehear that appeal or they could ask the Supreme Court to take up the dispute.\n\nAnother 2nd Circuit panel is currently considering a case Trump brought challenging House subpoenas aimed at seeking his tax returns and other financial records from two Trump lenders, Deutsche Bank and Capital One. The banks have said they don\u2019t have Trump\u2019s personal returns, but Deutsche appears to have returns for two Trump family members.\n\nAnd a federal district judge in Washington is considering a lawsuit the House Ways and Means Committee filed in July against the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service over their refusal to comply with a formal committee demand and subpoena for Trump\u2019s tax returns and returns filed by Trump businesses. No ruling has been issued.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/85/4d/9fe32ebb4c0da2709b55616eb20c/190602-scotus-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
