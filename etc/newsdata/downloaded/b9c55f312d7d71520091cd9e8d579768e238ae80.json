(AP Photo/Bernat Armangue)\n\nBARCELONA, Spain (AP) \u2014 The Latest on the situation in Catalonia (all times local):\n\n12:05 p.m.\n\nThe Spanish soccer federation has postponed next week's marquee game between Barcelona and Real Madrid due to a fear of more street violence in Catalonia.\n\nBarcelona is the capital of Spain's northeastern Catalonia region, which has recently seen clashes between police and protesters angered by a Supreme Court decision to sentence nine separatist leaders to prison.\n\nSeparatist groups have called for supporters to rally in Barcelona on Oct. 26, the planned date of the match.\n\nThe federation, in consultation with government officials, says it isn't safe to play on the same day as the rally.\n\nThe federation's competitions committee said Barcelona and Madrid have until Monday to decide on another date for the game. If the clubs cannot agree, then the committee will choose.\n\n___\n\n11.00 a.m.\n\nSpain's Supreme Court says that an investigating judge is telling Belgian judicial authorities that former Catalan regional president Carles Puigdemont possesses no parliamentary immunity that might prevent his extradition to Spain.\n\nA court statement says Belgian authorities asked for clarification on the matter early Friday.\n\nPuigdemont is sought by Spain on possible charges of sedition and misuse of public funds. He has so far avoided extradition from Germany and Belgium, where he fled at the end of 2017, following a failed attempt to declare independence in the wealthy region.\n\nThe separatist leader was elected as a European lawmaker in May. But the court says Judge Pablo Llarena is telling Belgium that Puigdemont didn't take office because he didn't swear on the Spanish Constitution \u2014 a pre-requisite under Spain's electoral rules.\n\n___\n\n10:50 a.m.\n\nFugitive former Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont has handed himself in to Belgian justice authorities after Spain issued a new warrant for his arrest following the sentencing of 12 of his former colleagues.\n\nPuigdemont's office said Friday that he, \"in the company of his lawyers, voluntarily appeared before Belgian authorities\" in relation to the arrest warrant.\n\nIt said that Puigdemont rejects the warrant and opposes any attempt to send him back to Spain.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether he is still being questioned or held.\n\nPuigdemont and a number of his associates fled to Belgium in October 2017 after they were summoned to court over the secessionist push he led and the holding of an independence referendum that the Spanish government said was illegal.\n\n___\n\n9:00 a.m.\n\nThe Catalan regional capital is bracing for a fifth day of protests over the conviction of a dozen independence leaders.\n\nClashes with police broke out in Barcelona late on Thursday when a mob of far-right anti-independence activists tried to storm a big separatist protest. Health authorities in the region say 18 people were injured and the regional police arrested 11 protesters.\n\nSpain's central authorities say that 46 flights into and out of the region are canceled Friday due to a general strike called by pro-independence unions. Picketers have also blocked the border with France at the major crossing point of La Jonquera.\n\nFive marches of tens of thousands of people from inland towns are expected to converge in Barcelona's center on Friday afternoon for a mass protest with striking students and workers.", "description": "The Spanish soccer federation has postponed next week's marquee game between Barcelona and Real Madrid due to a fear of more street violence in Catalonia.
