This One Would Change Senate Procedures.", "language": "en", "text": "As the 2020 Democratic candidates continue to vie for the party's nomination, one thing becomes more and more clear, especially about Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA): not only does she want to be president but she wants to be a dictator with the ultimate authority.\n\nShe wants to get rid of gun violence in America so she said she would give Congress 100 days to act before taking executive actions to implement \"common sense\" gun laws.\n\nShe wants to protect women's rights to abortion so she'd require states to come before her Department of Justice to ask for permission to implement pro-life legislation.\n\nNow, she wants to get rid of the filibuster to make sure the Green New Deal becomes a reality. She made that point very clear during Wednesday night's climate change town hall on CNN.\n\n\"We need to work across the aisle, but I'm going to tell you, I've been there now two years and some months and I'm seeing no evidence of it. I'm seeing, I kid you not, in our United States Congress, I was part of a committee hearing during which the underlining premise of the hearing was to debate whether science should be the basis of public policy,\" Harris explained. \"This, on a matter that is an existentialS threat to who we are as human beings. So, again, back to the United States Congress, because here's my point: if they fail to act, as president of the United States, I am prepared to get rid of the filibuster to pass a Green New Deal.\"\n\nAgain, Kamala knows that her policies are unfavorable so she wants to work around Congress. This is dangerous to our entire system. #ClimateTownHall pic.twitter.com/lhqD22qrm4 \u2014 Beth Baumann (@eb454) September 4, 2019\n\nFor someone who is a lawyer, Kamala sure isn't very familiar with the rule of law. She seems to \"forget\" \u2013 or blatantly ignore \u2013 the fact that a system of checks and balances exist. If she were to win the Democratic nomination and, ultimately, the presidency, she can't resort to executive action at every turn. Congress is supposed to be the lawmakers, not the president.\n\nNot only that but the president doesn't have the power to get rid of a Senate procedure, in this case, the filibuster.\n\nDemocratic candidates continue to show their true colors and their true intentions. It's obvious Harris' goal isn't to be a figurehead or a leader. Her goal is to be a dictator, a single ruler. And that's a direct threat to our republic.", "description": "Come on, lady..10/02/2019 12:36:40PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Katie Pavlich", "Cortney O'Brien", "Guy Benson", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/137/324c31a7-93da-4105-93f6-770a8e0f59c8.png"}
