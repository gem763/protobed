The electric four-wheel drive also promises more exhilarating driving.\n\nOther technology that Nissan officials showed was for what it called a \u201csafety shield\u201d concept of 360-degree monitoring by a vehicle, to intervene when drivers make mistakes, such as accelerating when they should be braking.\n\nNissan said the technology can help attain its goal of zero fatalities in its vehicles.\n\nThe demonstrations were timed for the opening of the Tokyo Motor Show this week.\n\nOther companies have developed similar technologies that allow cars to drive autonomously using sensors, radars, cameras and stored digital maps.\n\nGlobal traffic safety regulations still restrict or prohibit hands-free driving.\n\nBut, preparing for a future when cars might be allowed to drive themselves, Nissan showed virtual companions like holograms of animated characters that pop up in a car to keep drivers company.\n\nA headset has to be worn to see the characters, who were controlled remotely by people wearing headsets and other gadgetry.\n\n\u201cOne big goal of this kind of service is to appeal to people who are moving away from cars,\u201d said Tetsuro Ueda, an expert at Nissan\u2019s mobility service section.\n\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to win back the many Japanese consumers who no longer see cars as status symbols or fun and prefer to spend their money on smartphones and video games. Although many living in the countryside need cars to get around, unlike in the U.S., major Japanese cities provide ample public transportation.\n\n___\n\nFollow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama\n\nOn Instagram https://www.instagram.com/yurikageyama/?hl=en\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "An electric car with smooth four-wheel drive and a virtual friend for the coming age of automated driving are among the technology in development from Nissan.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Yuri Kageyama"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/23/japan_nissan_92094_c0-152-3662-2288_s1200x700.jpg?24d901129d34118cf22185f5f3fecb9db45a72b1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
