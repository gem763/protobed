We must know whether Kavanaugh lied to the Senate, whether he sexually assaulted the women who credibly accused him of doing so, and whether he is ultimately fit to be a justice on the Supreme Court. Brett Kavanaugh will roll back rights that women have worked for generations to secure. We won\u2019t wait around for that to happen, we\u2019re fighting back now.\n\nUPDATE \u2014 4:00 P.M. EST: Following their protest against Kavanaugh outside the Supreme Court, leftists are now demonstrating outside Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s (R-KY) residence.\n\nAnti-Kavanaugh people are now outside of what they say is Sen.
