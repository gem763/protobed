Here's a quick guide to Isa saving.\n\nIt is possible to switch your current year's cash Isa if you move the entire amount, but it is far simpler to get your choice right in the first place.\n\nRates are low and that makes the best Isa more important\n\nBanks and building societies should be apologising to savers for the slim pickings on offer here.\n\nSavings rates really are dire at the moment and unfortunately, institutions are doing little to shelter savers from the assault of the low interest rate environment.\n\nThe cut to 0.25 per cent for the base rate, launch of a new funding scheme to pump cheap money to banks, and expansion of quantitative easing, has made things even worse.\n\nMany now ask themselves why bother?\n\nYet when rates are low it becomes even more important to make sure you are getting as much as you can from your savings.\n\nWe also think an Isa is still worth having, despite the new tax-free savings interest allowance of \u00a31,000 a year for basic rate taxpayers and \u00a3500 for higher rate taxpayers.\n\nIt's tough to get that much interest now, but one day rates will rise.\n\nMoney sheltered in an Isa will deliver a tax-free income, even above that \u00a31,000 level and if you are building up a long-term pot, you may one day be very grateful for that.\n\nAnd who knows if the personal savings allowance will be around forever - it is much more likely to disappear than the Isa wrapper.\n\nYou may also want to look into stocks and shares version of an Isa - how to choose the best (and cheapest) DIY investing Isa.\n\nHOW WE PICK OUR FAVOURITE FIVE ISAS Lee Boyce: This is Money's savings expert Our five favourite Isas round-up is a permanent feature of This is Money. It comes complete with an explanation detailing why we're happy to pick each account. This page will be kept updated as and when new deals pop up or old ones get scrapped. Our team work tirelessly to stay on top of the latest rate changes, but banks and building societies can pull deals without telling us. If you spot a deal here that is not longer available please email us at editor@thisismoney.co.uk Remember, you can open an Isa or transfer (provided you're not tied to a fixed-term) at any time during the year. Note that we don't just copy the best rates from the savings tables - we scour the market for all-around winners. This is a taster of the top deals. For the best rates, visit our savings rates tables, which are comprehensive and independently compiled.\n\nOur five favourite Isas:\n\n\n\n- Facts: \u00a31 to open\n\n- Transfers in: Yes\n\n- This is Money says: This best buy can be opened online, by post, by phone or in-branch and is offered by the UK's second-largest mutual, which has FSCS protection.\n\nCharter Savings Bank cutting its rate means this is the best non fixed-rate deal on the market now, but it comes with a bonus rate of 0.29 per cent until the end of January 2021, and only lets you make three withdrawals a year\n\n- Facts: \u00a3500 to open\n\n- Transfers in: Yes\n\n- This is Money says: Cynergy Bank has the best short-term fix. It is FSCS-protected, and can only be applied for online. It is worth noting Cynergy's deals tend to last only a short time as it is one of a new breed of smaller challenger banks, so fills up its coffers quickly when it unveils a best buy account.\n\nThis deal is a much better one than its two and three year options, which pay exactly the same rate. Elsewhere you can get a 1.60 per cent deal from Sharia bank Al-Rayan, or 1.55 per cent offers.\n\n- Facts: \u00a31,000 to open\n\n- Transfers in: Yes\n\n- This is Money says: Al-Rayan offers the top two year rate. There are a clutch of other providers that offer 1.75 per cent over 24 months. It is worth noting that as Al-Rayan is a Sharia-compliant provider, it does not pay interest, rather it pays an expected profit rate, which it monitors on a daily basis. It is FSCS-protected\n\n- Facts: \u00a31 to open\n\n- Transfers in: Yes\n\n- This is Money says: This account from Virgin is the second best on the market, and doesn't come with a bonus period. However, it isn't strictly easy-access - savers can only make two withdrawals per year. There is also a Manchester United version of the account, where you can win prizes - it offers the same rate of interest.\n\n- Facts: \u00a31,000 to open\n\n- Transfers in: Yes\n\n- This is Money says: This is the best rate you can get on an Isa - but it requires fixing for five years. It can be opened in its Epsom branch, online, or by post.\n\nWhat you need to know about Isas Listen to our special Isa podcast \u2013 we tackle the basics and have tips for those who are experienced Isa savers or investors.
