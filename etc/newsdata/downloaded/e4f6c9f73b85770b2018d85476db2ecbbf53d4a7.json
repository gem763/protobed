Trump impeachment theater is now a full production. Okay\u2014ever since the Democrat retook the House, impeachment theater has been in production, but now it\u2019s official. Lewandowski was yanked before the House Judiciary Committee via subpoena and gave the Left a run for its money. He slapped down the nonsense hurled at him regarding the Trump-Russia myth. He wasn\u2019t going to play by their rules because he doesn\u2019t need to accept those parameters. This is a witch hunt. It\u2019s political theater. So, have fun\u2014and he did (via Fox News):\n\nLewandowski visibly frustrated committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., during the Democrat's first question \u2013 when the witness, in an apparent effort to stall for time, repeatedly asked Nadler to point to the specific section in the Robert Mueller report related to his question. Lewandowski was following White House orders not to discuss confidential conversations with the president beyond what was already public in the former special counsel's report.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n\"He's filibustering,\" a frustrated Nadler said.\n\nAmid the back-and-forth, the top Republican on the committee, Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, moved to adjourn the hearing, forcing a failed voice vote that caused further delay, before questioning resumed from other lawmakers.\n\nLewandowski later declined to play along with certain questions. New York Democratic Rep. Hakeem Jeffries asked Lewandowski if he was Trump\u2019s \u201chitman, the bag man, the lookout, or all of the above?\"\n\n\"I think I'm the good looking man, actually,\" Lewandowski replied.\n\nLewandowski, considering a run for the Senate in New Hampshire in 2020, had been subpoenaed to testify about Mueller\u2019s report. In a reminder of the political backdrop, during a recess, the witness tweeted out a link to a website promoting his possible candidacy. And Democrats referenced his ambitions.\n\n\"You are not on the campaign trail yet,\" Jeffries said. \"This is the House Judiciary Committee. Act like you know the difference.\"\n\n[\u2026]\n\nAt another point, Texas Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee told Lewandowski, \u201cYou are obviously here to block any reasonable inquiry into the truth or not of this administration.\"\n\nLewandowski fired back that he was unable to give her a response because it wasn\u2019t a question but a \u201crant.\u201d\n\nDuring his questioning, Georgia Rep. Hank Johnson said, \u201cMr. Lewandowski, you are like a fish being cleaned with a spoon \u2014 it\u2019s very hard to get an answer out of you.\u201d\n\nLewandowski appeared to mock California Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell\u2019s unsuccessful bid for the White House earlier this year, calling him \u201cPresident Swalwell\u201d at one point during questioning.", "description": ".09/17/2019 19:26:55PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/260/f08c5472-ec83-4c03-a70d-398737f12598.png", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
