NHTSA recently extended the deadline to 2020 for full compliance, while vehicles sold in the European Union have until 2021.\n\nElectric cars are quieter than their internal combustion engine-having counterparts\n\nElectric cars are quieter than their internal combustion engine-having counterparts. The only noises EVs usually generate is caused by wind resistance or tire noises, and that is only at moderate to higher speeds.\n\n\u201cThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is requesting public comment on amending the new Quiet Vehicle safety standard FMVSS No. 141, Minimum Sound Requirements for Hybrid and Electric Vehicles, to allow multiple driver-selectable sounds so long as they meet the existing performance requirements,\u201d an agency spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cNHTSA is considering whether to allow hybrid and electric vehicles to be equipped with a suite of pedestrian alert sounds from which a driver may select a preference.\u201d\n\nThe new rule requires all newly manufactured electric vehicles that weigh 10,000 pounds or fewer to make an audible noise when traveling forward or in reverse at speeds of 19 mph or less. NHTSA says the sound alert is not required at higher speeds because other factors, such as tire and wind noise, \u201cprovide adequate audible warning to pedestrians.\u201d Initially, NHTSA did not stipulate what kinds of noises manufacturers chose to install in their vehicles.\n\nSome automakers have already selected their sounds. Mercedes-Benz has an artificial humming sound picked out for its electric EQC lineup, while VW has said its compact ID.3 electric vehicles will come installed with a fake sound for low speeds when they hit showroom floors in 2020. Mercedes-AMG, the automaker\u2019s performance brand, is working with rock band Linkin Park to find a more bass-slapping sound for its vehicles.\n\nSome automakers are already exploring ways to make money off the absence of noise in EVs. Porsche is offering an interior $500 \u201cElectric Sport Sound\u201d in the configurator for its recently unveiled electric Taycan sports car, according to Electrek.\n\nOther automakers, though, are looking for workarounds. Last year, The Verge reported that Ford was seeking a partial exemption for its lineup of police vehicles. The company is asking whether it could include an \u201coff switch\u201d \u2014 presumedly so law enforcement officials can use their EVs to sneak up on suspected criminals.\n\nUpdated September 17th, 9:50AM ET: Added statement from NHTSA spokesperson", "description": "The federal government is requiring automakers to include artificial motor sounds in electric and hybrid cars when traveling at low speeds to alert pedestrians, but it wants to give vehicle owners the ability to choose which sounds they use.", "authors": ["Andrew J.
