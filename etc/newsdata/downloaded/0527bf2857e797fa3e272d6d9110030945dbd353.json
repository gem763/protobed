Beijing has denied eroding Hong Kong's freedoms and Xi has vowed to crush any attempt to \"split\" China.\n\nThe unrest was sparked by a bill that would have allowed the extradition of accused individuals to mainland China for trial in Communist Party-controlled courts. It has since widened into a pro-democracy movement.\n\nMatthew Lee, a university student, said he was determined to keep protesting even after five months.\n\n\"I can see some people want to give up but I don't want to do this because Hong Kong is my home, we want to protect this place, protect Hong Kong,\" he said.\n\nMany of the movement's supporters wore masks in defiance of a recently introduced ban on face coverings at public gatherings and volunteers handed more out to the crowd.\n\nOrganisers said they wanted to use their right to protest, as guaranteed by the city's constitution, despite the risk of arrest.\n\n\"We're using peaceful, rational, nonviolent way to voice our demands,\" Figo Chan, vice convener of the Civil Human Rights Front, told reporters.\n\nThere were organised rallies on Nathan Road (North & South), Canton Road and Kowloon Park Drive #HongKong #Protests pic.twitter.com/6ugebN3oXH \u2014 Zahra K (@Zahra_HK) October 20, 2019\n\n\"We're not afraid of being arrested. What I'm most scared of is everyone giving up on our principles.\"\n\nThe group has organised some of the movement's biggest protest marches. One of its leaders, Jimmy Sham, was attacked on Wednesday by assailants wielding hammers.\n\nOn Saturday, police arrested a 22-year-old man on suspicion of stabbing a teenage activist distributing leaflets near a Lennon Wall plastered with pro-democracy messages.\n\nLocal media images showed the young activist had been severely injured in the afternoon incident in northeastern Tai Po district.\n\nA witness told local broadcaster RTHK the assailant shouted afterwards that Hong Kong is \"a part of China\" and other pro-Beijing messages.", "description": "Police fire tear gas as demonstrators press calls for accountability and political rights.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/20/6609335a323d4bd6ac77268445ed4490_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
