But so much more than the game defines Dungy.\n\nHe\u2019s been a go-to adviser for players and executives. He\u2019s a top-level analyst on NBC\u2019s Sunday night broadcasts. Dungy is heavily involved in charity and diversity work.\n\nPlus, he\u2019s an author.\n\nDungy and his wife, Lauren, just penned their fourth book in a children\u2019s series. This one is titled \u201cCarson Chooses Forgiveness,\u201d and it follows \u201cWe Chose You,\u201d which focuses on adoption; \u201cMaria Finds Courage,\u201d and \u201cAustin Plays Fair,\u201d which are self-explanatory.\n\n\u201cMy wife and I are peewee coaches and things come up,\u201d Dungy says, \u201cand we try to walk the young players through different situations.\n\n\u201cIn \u2018Carson Chooses Forgiveness,\u2019 one guy hogs the ball and won\u2019t pass it. Will he try to embrace this guy or shut him down and keep the team divided? There\u2019s a very good message for kids and parents that sometimes we have to help kids through those life lessons.\u201d\n\nThe Dungys were inspired to write way back when Tony was coaching; he retired after the 2008 season.\n\n\u201cLauren and other wives would go in (to schools and libraries) and read and emphasize how important reading is,\u201d Dungy says. \u201cShe said, \u2018We can\u2019t find a lot of books with a real good message or with diversity.\u2019 They were reading in the city schools and there were no African-American characters or Hispanic characters, and so that was when we thought of doing different kinds of kids and people in the books.\u201d\n\n___\n\nLIKE FATHER, LIKE SON\n\nPatrick Mahomes is getting a chance to play on the same field where his pop once played, albeit in totally different sports, for what is likely to be the only time in his career.\n\nThe Chiefs visit the Raiders on Sunday, and that means one last trip to the \u201cBlack Hole\u201d of what is generally known as Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum. It has long served as the home for the Athletics - thus, the place where Pat Mahomes Sr. pitched as the visitor on several occasions - and the Raiders, who are departing for their swanky new Las Vegas digs next season.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really cool, when you think about it,\u201d Kansas City\u2019s quarterback said. \u201cBut it\u2019s just playing the sports we love, and it just worked that we get to play on the exact same field.\u201d\n\nMahomes even gets to play on the same dirt. The Coliseum is the last of its generation of dual-purpose stadiums, and that means the infield is still down until the A\u2019s season is over.\n\n\u201cI can say that I played on the exact same field my dad played on at some point,\u201d Mahomes said, \u201cso that\u2019s cool. I played some shortstop, so I\u2019ve had my feet right there.\u201d\n\n___\n\nSAY MY NAME\n\nTitans safety Kevin Byard (BY\u2019-urd) doesn\u2019t think his last name is that hard to pronounce. Now the man with the NFL\u2019s most interceptions since the start of the 2017 season has a plan to fix that.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to keep working, I\u2019m going to keep making plays until I don\u2019t have to introduce myself no more,\u201d Byard said. \u201cPeople are going to be trying to find out what my last name is before they get on TV and do the things they do.\u201d\n\nByard became the NFL\u2019s highest-paid safety in July just before training camp, and he got his 13th career interception in the Titans\u2019 opening win at Cleveland.\n\nBut Rex Ryan, a former NFL coach who now lives in Nashville, called the safety \u201cByrad\u201d on ESPN\u2019s \u201cGet Up\u201d show and was quickly corrected. Someone shared video of Ryan\u2019s mistake with Byard on Twitter, and the safety responded \u201cBYRAD!?!?\u201d with some laughing emojis. Byard said Wednesday he has no hard feelings toward Ryan, who was showing him and the Titans some love.\n\nAnd if people keep messing up his name?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m kind of used to it at this point,\u201d Byard said.\n\n___\n\nGO DAD GO\n\nMiami Dolphins quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick has been in the NFL so long his oldest sons are now 12 and 10. After games, they want to talk with him mostly about fantasy football.\n\n\u201cWhich just drives me insane,\u201d Fitzpatrick says.\n\nThe quarterback on the boys\u2019 fantasy team? Their dad.\n\n\u201cYou better believe it,\u201d he says with a grin.\n\nFitzpatrick, 36, has seven children and is glad he has hung around long enough for his oldest boys to enjoy watching him play.\n\n\u201cI think about that a little bit,\u201d Fitzpatrick says, \u201cespecially when you\u2019re in a game where it\u2019s a struggle and you\u2019re losing and just trying to continue to do your best.\u201d\n\nThat was the case last week, when the Dolphins lost to Baltimore 59-10.\n\n___\n\nPro Football Writers Barry Wilner and Teresa M.
