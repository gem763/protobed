The report said Trump acted to advance his personal political interests, risking national security, and that White House officials intervened to shift evidence to a separate electronic system.\n\nDuring a roughly three-hour committee hearing held after the release of the seven-page document, the top U.S. intelligence official, Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, said the whistleblower had acted in good faith and followed the law in bringing the complaint.\n\nTrump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate the 2020 Democratic presidential front-runner, former Vice President Joe Biden, in coordination with U.S. Attorney General William Barr and Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, according to a summary of a July telephone call released by the Trump administration on Wednesday.\n\nDemocrats have accused Trump of soliciting a foreign power to smear a domestic political rival. The Ukraine controversy follows U.S. intelligence conclusions that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. election with a campaign of hacking and propaganda to boost Trump\u2019s candidacy.\n\n\u201cI am deeply concerned that the actions described below constitute \u2018a serious or flagrant problem, abuse, or violation of law or executive order\u2019 that \u2018does not include differences of opinion concerning public policy matters,\u2019 consistent with the definition of an \u2018urgent concern\u2019,\u201d the whistleblower complaint, dated Aug. 12, said.\n\nThe call occurred after Trump had ordered a freeze of nearly $400 million in American aid to Ukraine, which the administration only later released. Before the call, Ukraine\u2019s government was told that interaction between Zelenskiy and Trump depended on whether the Ukrainian leader would \u201cplay ball,\u201d the whistleblower said.\n\nThe identity of the whistleblower, a person within the U.S. intelligence community, has not yet been made public. In the report, the whistleblower said that \u201cI was not a direct witness to most of the events described\u201d and based his account on information from colleagues.\n\nThe whistleblower\u2019s concerns did not end with Trump\u2019s conversation with Zelenskiy. The next day, the whistleblower report said, Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations Kurt Volker and Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland met with Zelenskiy and other Ukrainian political figures and advised them \u201cabout how to \u2018navigate\u2019 the demands that the president had made of Mr Zelenskiy.\u201d\n\nTrump has repeatedly suggested wrongdoing by Biden and his son but has offered no evidence to back up the assertion. There has been no evidence that Biden used his position to help his son in the Ukraine matter.\n\n\u2018GOOD FAITH\u2019\n\nAt the hearing, despite comments by Trump and other Republicans, Maguire said there was no reason to believe the whistleblower was disloyal to the United States or a political hack.\n\n\u201cI believe the whistleblower and the inspector general have acted in good faith throughout,\u201d he said, also referring to intelligence community Inspector General Michael Atkinson, who determined that the whistleblower allegations appeared credible and were of urgent concern.\n\n\u201cI think the whistleblower did the right thing. I think he followed the law every step of the way,\u201d Maguire said.\n\nMaguire frustrated committee Democrats when he declined to answer when was asked if he had discussed the whistleblower complaint with Trump, though he said he spoke with the president often. Maguire refused to say whether the whistleblower\u2019s allegations merited investigation and said he did not think it was \u201cappropriate\u201d for him to publicly rebuke Trump\u2019s attacks on the whistleblower.\n\nMaguire testified about the document after refusing for weeks to share the report with Congress. Committee Democrats said federal law had required that the report be given to Congress.\n\n\u201cI have upheld my responsibility to follow the law every step of the way in the matter that is before us today,\u201d Maguire testified. Under questioning, he acknowledged that this was the first time a whistleblower complaint was not shared with Congress.\n\nMaguire said he had not immediately released the report out of concern for \u201cexecutive privilege,\u201d a legal doctrine protecting certain executive branch communications.\n\n\u201cI am not familiar with any prior instances where a whistleblower complaint touched on such complicated and sensitive issues including executive privilege. I believe that this matter is unprecedented,\u201d Maguire said.\n\nMaguire said he did not know who the whistleblower was and that he would work to ensure the individual\u2019s anonymity is protected and that the individual not face retaliation.\n\nThe whistleblower complaint concerns a July 25 telephone call in which Trump pressed Zelenskiy to investigate Biden and his son Hunter, who had worked for a company drilling for gas in Ukraine.\n\n\u2018INFORMATION WARFARE\u2019\n\nAdam Schiff, the Democratic committee chairman, grilled Maguire about why the whistleblower report was withheld. Trump, Schiff said, \u201chas betrayed his oath of office, betrayed his oath to defend our national security and betrayed his oath to defend the Constitution.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat you are seeing in the actions of this president is not democracy. It is the very negation of democracy,\u201d Schiff said as the ended the hearing.\n\nActing Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Joseph Maguire is sworn in to testifify before a House Intelligence Committee hearing on the handling of the whistleblower complaint in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., September 26, 2019. REUTERS/Leah Millis\n\nRepresentative Devin Nunes, a close Trump ally who is the committee\u2019s top Republican, blasted Democrats for pursuing the matter, as well as media reports about the call and whistleblower report.\n\n\u201cI want to congratulate the Democrats on their latest information warfare effort against the president,\u201d Nunes said sarcastically.\n\nSaying more than six White House officials had made contact about Trump\u2019s communication with Ukraine, the report cited concerns that efforts to put pressure on Ukraine \u201cpose risks to U.S. national security,\u201d undermining efforts \u201cto deter and counter foreign interference in U.S. elections.\u201d\n\nTrump has denied wrongdoing and accused Democrats of trying to destroy him politically.\n\nThe whistleblower report also said, citing multiple U.S. officials, that senior White House officials had intervened to \u201clock down\u201d records of the call, especially the exact transcript.\n\n\u201cInstead the transcript was loaded into a separate electronic system that is otherwise used to store and handle classified information of an especially sensitive nature,\u201d the report said. \u201cOne White House official described this act as an abuse of this electronic system because the call did not contain anything remotely sensitive from a national security perspective.\u201d\n\nPelosi referred to that claim at a news conference, saying, \u201cThe president has been engaged in a cover-up all along.\u201d\n\nA federal law required that the report be sent to lawmakers after an inspector general deemed it was urgent and credible.\n\nThe complaint stated that multiple U.S. officials said they were \u201cdeeply concerned by what they viewed as Mr. Giuliani\u2019s circumvention of national security decision-making processes to engage with Ukrainian officials and relay messages back and forth between Kiev and the president.\u201d\n\nThe complaint cited two instances that might have a connection with \u201cthe overall effort to pressure Ukrainian leadership.\u201d According to U.S. officials, Trump instructed Vice President Mike Pence to cancel his trip to Ukraine to attend Zelenskiy\u2019s inauguration in May, sending a lower-level Cabinet member instead.\n\nMaguire said the greatest challenge facing the U.S. intelligence community is protecting the integrity of elections, federal, state and local. Maguire said it would be \u201cunwarranted\u201d and \u201cunwelcome\u201d to have outside interference in a U.S. election, adding, \u201cNo person in the country is beyond the reach of the law.\u201d\n\nTrump denounced the report. \u201cTHE DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO DESTROY THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND ALL THAT IT STANDS FOR,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter. \u201cSTICK TOGETHER, PLAY THEIR GAME, AND FIGHT HARD REPUBLICANS. OUR COUNTRY IS AT STAKE!\u201d\n\nUnder the U.S. Constitution, the House has the power to impeach a president for \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d No president has ever been removed from office through impeachment. Democrats control the House and Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans control the Senate.\n\nSlideshow (12 Images)\n\nThe United States has been giving military aid to Ukraine since Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014. The $391.5 million in aid at issue in the current controversy was approved by Congress to help Ukraine deal with an insurgency by Russian-backed separatists in the eastern part of the country.\n\nThe details of the July 25 call drew furious reactions from Democrats, who accused Trump of soliciting Ukraine\u2019s help to smear Biden, who has led in polls among Democratic candidates seeking to challenge the Republican president in the November 2020 election.\n\nThe call occurred after Trump had ordered a freeze of the military aid. The whistleblower report said that an official from the White House informed departments and agencies on July 18 that Trump had issued instructions to suspend all security assistance to Ukraine. Neither the White House budget office of the National Security Council staff \u201cknew why this instruction had been issued,\u201d the report said.", "description": "A whistleblower report released on Thursday said President Donald Trump not only abused his office in attempting to solicit Ukraine's interference in the 2020 U.S. election for his own political benefit, but that the White House also tried to \"lock down\" evidence about that conduct.", "authors": ["Patricia Zengerle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434169650&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P19V", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
