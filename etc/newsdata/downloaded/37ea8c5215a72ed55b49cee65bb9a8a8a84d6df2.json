The producer claims the NRA owes it $17.1 million for breach of contract after the gun-rights group stopped paying agreed-upon fees to sponsor the program and advertise on it.\n\nUnder Wild Skies is hosted by Tony Makris, who also is a top executive at the NRA\u2019s former advertising firm, Ackerman McQueen Inc. The NRA and Ackerman McQueen have fallen out and are embroiled in other litigation. Mr. Makris declined to comment, as did a spokesman for Ackerman McQueen.\n\nUnder Wild Skies says it is being unfairly punished by the NRA as retaliation for the group\u2019s dispute with Ackerman McQueen, adding that \u201cUWS is not a subsidiary of Ackerman McQueen and is not under its control or direction.\u201d\n\nWilliam A. Brewer III, an attorney for the NRA, called the lawsuit \u201cwithout merit\u201d and a desperate attempt by Under Wild Skies to avoid answering basic questions about its performance under the production company\u2019s NRA contract.\n\nAs for allegations that NRA representatives participated in free hunting safaris, Mr. Brewer said: \u201cThese were trips to extol the benefits of hunting and promote the brand of the NRA with one of its core audience groups. The NRA\u2019s past support of this show was public and widely known.\u201d\n\nIn the lawsuit, Under Wild Skies said \u201cprominent NRA figures,\u201d including Mr. LaPierre and his wife, had appeared in hunts on the TV show, and that \u201cUWS paid for the safaris and hunts of these NRA officers, spouses and board members.\u201d Among the locations for these hunts, the suit alleged, were Botswana, Tanzania, Mozambique and Uruguay.\n\nThe NRA officials used their experiences on the program to seek memberships into elite hunting organizations, the complaint alleged.\n\nThe NRA also received benefits from the officials\u2019 appearances on the show, the suit said, including brand awareness in the hunting community and donations from hunting groups.\n\nThe plaintiff included copies of a 2016 contract extending the NRA\u2019s sponsorship of the program until 2025, signed by Mr. LaPierre.\n\nThe allegation that Mr. LaPierre and other NRA figures received free safari hunts is the latest revelation to buffet the organization in recent months. Mr. LaPierre allegedly received more than $540,000 of travel and wardrobe expenses billed to Ackerman McQueen, and the NRA last year was negotiating to buy its CEO a $6 million mansion in an arrangement involving the ad agency that later fell apart.\n\nNRA officials have said Mr. LaPierre\u2019s travel and wardrobe costs were justified as business expenses, and that no NRA money was spent on the aborted house-purchase proposal. Mr. LaPierre so far has prevailed in internal boardroom battles over the expense allegations and appears to have the support of most NRA board members.\n\nUnder Wild Skies said the NRA stopped paying it after sending a letter in July demanding \u201cexcessive information\u201d about the show and its metrics.\n\nWrite to Mark Maremont at mark.maremont@wsj.com", "description": "National Rifle Association CEO Wayne LaPierre, his wife and other top NRA officials were treated to free hunting safaris by an NRA vendor, according to a new lawsuit that raises new questions about the organization\u2019s governance.", "authors": ["Mark Maremont", "Mark.Maremont Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-96906/social", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
