She\u2019s now employed a professional childminder to take care of them after school while she\u2019s at work.\n\nI\u2019m quite hurt by all of this and fail to see what I\u2019ve done that\u2019s so terrible. I admit I\u2019m quite relaxed when it comes to grand-parenting \u2013 I allow them treats and let them watch a bit of telly when we get back from school, but it seems this doesn\u2019t fit in with what my daughter wants.\n\nShe claims her son has been saying inappropriate things at school, and his teacher has pulled\n\nher up on it. She seems convinced it\u2019s my fault for letting him watch certain TV shows. What should I do? I absolutely loved looking after them and feel quite angry she\u2019s reacted like this.\n\nOn the other hand, I don\u2019t want to fall out with her. Any advice?\n\nColeen says\n\nTry not to take it personally and fall out with your daughter. She\u2019s not banned you from seeing your grandchildren or from babysitting at other times. I know you liked looking after the kids but, actually, this might be best for your relationship with your daughter.\n\nIf there are things you do that she doesn\u2019t like, it\u2019s really hard to complain to your own mother. However, if she\u2019s paying a childminder and doesn\u2019t agree with something, it\u2019s a lot easier to deal with.\n\nIf she has professional childcare then she doesn\u2019t risk falling out with you and that\u2019s probably a big part of her decision.\n\nMy mother-in-law used to help me with childcare, but she did things I didn\u2019t like and it was really hard to tell her.\n\nI would just explain to your daughter it makes sense because now you can just be their granny and you\u2019re up for babysitting.\n\nYou have to respect how other people want to bring up their kids, but I\u2019m sure treats can still be on the agenda in the future.", "description": "I enjoyed looking after the grandkids and can't see what I've done that's so terrible", "authors": ["Coleen Nolan", "Image", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20678638.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Woman-with-head-resting-in-palms-of-hands.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
