Put simply: making a management simulation game on three consoles (and making it the best it possibly can be on all three), is a tricky programming puzzle.\n\n\u2018We have to take the game apart and figure out how to fit it into what is essentially a smaller box. That takes a fair amount of time and engineering work, and it turns out we need to take a little more to iron out the remaining creases.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey add: \u2018We know you\u2019ll be disappointed by this news, but hopefully you understand why we\u2019re doing it: quality is the most important thing and we want you to have the very best experience.\u2019\n\nThe console versions are now slated to be released in \u2018the first half of 2020\u2019, which hopefully won\u2019t place it in the incredibly crowded month of March alongside Doom Eternal, Final Fantasy 7 Remake, Watch Dogs: Legion and Animal Crossing: New Horizons.\n\nThe PC version was released last autumn and the console versions will include all the same features, along with everything that\u2019s been added in updates since then \u2013 such as an interior designer and character customisation.\n\nYou\u2019ll also get the expansions Bigfoot and Pebberley Island too, which add snowy and tropical backdrops and all the fictional diseases they cause.\n\nThe British developer consists of many people who worked on the original Theme Hospital at now defunct developer Bullfrog \u2013 who also created management sim Theme Park.\n\nTwo Point Hospital releases on Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch in 2020.\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter.", "description": "Two Point Hospital has been delayed on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch until 2020.", "authors": ["Adam Starkey"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/two-point-hispital-17c4_1571842957.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
