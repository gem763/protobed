ANA remains committed to expanding the boundaries with Avatars and will continue to look for partners that allow the technology to reach its full potential.\"\n\nAgility Robotics' latest model has a humanoid frame and is capable of independently traversing outdoor terrain. The robot is capable of climbing stairs and selecting its own routes, all while carrying objects.\n\nBy combining the research of Agility Robotics with ANA's Avatar platform and core technology, ANA will enhance the Avatar capabilities of the robot, allowing it to be controlled from anywhere on the planet. ANA says that by bringing these two principals together will result in a wide range of applications in fields such as \"tourism and entertainment as well as security and potentially even emergency rescue and response\".\n\n\u00a9 Asia Travel Tips", "description": "ANA has signed a MOU with Agility Robotics, a start-up spinoff of Oregon State University.
