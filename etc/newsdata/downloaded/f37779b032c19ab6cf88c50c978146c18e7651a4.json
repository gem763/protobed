But soon, the realities of eviction come knocking at their door.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________\n\nFILMMAKER'S VIEW\n\nBy Ricardo Calil\n\nWhy should one make a film about immigrants, refugees and homeless people reinventing scenes from classic movies in the same place where they were screened 60 years before?\n\nBecause this concept allowed us to bring together universes that seemed distant to each other: past and present, documentary and fiction, glamour and decadence, fight for shelter and artistic invention.\n\nBecause one single project allowed the director - who is also a film critic - to approach several subjects that are close to his heart: the love of movies, social inequality, urban decay and the end of street cinemas, and prejudice against the homeless, immigrants and refugees.\n\nBecause cinema should be for everyone, and masterpieces shown for the Brazilian elite in the past should also be accessible to people who are suffering from social vulnerability in the present.\n\nBecause the process offered the residents a chance to occupy the building, not only physically, but also symbolically - consuming culture in a temple created for this end.\n\nBecause they could reinvent their realities through the filter of cinema. And because the same happened with the crew of the film - who, coming from a different economic universe, were also transformed by the experience.\n\nBecause everyone deserves a chance to shine. And so they did, incarnating characters that once belonged to Marlon Brando, Gregory Peck, Audrey Hepburn, Gina Lollobrigida, Vittorio de Sica, Gloria Swanson, Harriett Anderson and others.\n\nBecause there's a trend in Brazil - and, we believe, in the whole world - of criminalising social protest and repelling the homeless, immigrants and refugees. A film that shows their power, creativity and talent can offer a modest contribution to oppose this sad vision.\n\nSource: Al Jazeera", "description": "A community of refugees and homeless people occupying an abandoned cinema take to the screen and reenact film classics.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/16/af97a9ad0e924dcf8c7145640ed1a428_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
