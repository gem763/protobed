Deeply hurt, he vowed to keep it private.\n\nPictured on Meghan's wedding day to Trevor Engelson in Jamaica in 2011. Last night, retired Hollywood lighting director Thomas Markle, 75, spoke for the first time since his daughter issued her writ against this newspaper for publishing parts of the letter\n\nIt would have remained a secret had its existence not been revealed by an unnamed \u2018long-time friend\u2019 of Meghan\u2019s in a glowing article in America\u2019s People magazine about the Duchess in February.\n\nMeghan\u2019s friend portrayed the letter as loving and conciliatory, saying: \u2018After the wedding she wrote him a letter. She\u2019s like, \u201cDad. I\u2019m so heartbroken. I love you, I have one father. Please stop victimising me through the media so we can repair our relationship.\u201d \u2019\n\nAt the time it was widely speculated that Meghan had, perhaps, authorised her friends to brief the magazine \u2013 something neither she nor the Palace have denied. What is certain is that Mr Markle viewed the letter very differently, saying it made no attempt to heal their rift and felt more like \u2018a final farewell\u2019.\n\nAttack dog lawyers loved by the rich and famous... By Ian Gallagher When the rich and famous want to silence their critics, it is to \u2018attack dog\u2019 lawyers Schillings that they frequently turn. Media experts said choosing the aggressive London-based Schillings over the Royal Family\u2019s preferred law firm Harbottle & Lewis \u2013 who represented the couple when they initially raised concerns about the letter with The Mail on Sunday \u2013 was a risky move by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. One said it could be seen as \u2018using a sledgehammer to crack a nut\u2019. The firm was founded in 1984 by Keith Schilling, now 63, the son of a jobless father and a shopworker mother, who left school at 15 to be a clerk in a media law firm. He has since been at the forefront of efforts by lawyers in the reputation protection business to exploit the Human Rights Act passed under Labour as one of the legal weapons that can be used against newspapers and broadcasters. His firm used Article Eight of the European Convention on Human Rights to persuade Law Lords in 2004 that the model Naomi Campbell should not have been pictured outside a drug rehabilitation clinic. The case established privacy law in Britain and since then the Schillings name has been found on warning documents in the legal offices of media organisations across the country. Schillings became the go-to law firm for those wanting to obtain injunctions to gag newspapers from publishing stories that are seen as damaging. It has had many successes, but some high-profile failures too. It suffered a notable setback in 2007 when one of its most influential clients, Lord Browne of Madingley, lost a battle with The Mail on Sunday. The BP chief executive resigned after 41 years with the oil giant after he admitted he had lied to the court over how he met his former boyfriend Jeff Chevalier. Interestingly, Lord Browne is now listed on Schillings\u2019 website as chairman of its advisory board. The firm became expert at seeking so-called super-injunctions, where even the reporting of the injunction\u2019s existence was banned. The orders, however, proved useless when public outrage led to celebrities being outed on Twitter and even in Parliament. Recently the firm represented retail tycoon Sir Philip Green, who suffered humiliation when he was forced to drop a court injunction that stopped the media reporting allegations made by five former staff. Combative Mr Schilling has been called \u2018the silencer\u2019 because of his readiness to stop the presses, once suggesting that there were \u2018too many newspapers\u2019. Of the decision by the Duke and Duchess to hire his firm, media commentator Roy Greenslade said: \u2018The choice of legal firm is interesting. I can\u2019t remember that they\u2019ve [the Royal Family] used Schillings before. Is [Harry] taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut?\u2019\n\nLast night, retired Hollywood lighting director Mr Markle, 75, spoke for the first time since his daughter issued her writ against this newspaper for publishing parts of the letter. He said: \u2018I decided to release parts of the letter because of the article from Meghan\u2019s friends in People magazine. I have to defend myself. I only released parts of the letter because other parts were so painful. The letter didn\u2019t seem loving to me. I found it hurtful.\u2019\n\nHe previously told this newspaper: \u2018The letter was presented in a way that vilified me and wasn\u2019t true. It was presented as her reaching out and writing a loving letter in the hope of healing the rift, but the letter isn\u2019t like that at all. I have the right to defend myself.\u2019\n\nMr Markle, who lives in Rosarito, Mexico, said he was \u2018devastated\u2019 when the existence of the letter was made public. He is also angered by false claims that he asked for and received payment for releasing parts of the letter.\n\nFurthermore, Mr Markle only learned through People magazine that his daughter had received a letter he had sent in response to hers. Until then, he was left wondering if she had read it.\n\nPrince Harry last week issued a searing statement announcing his wife was suing this newspaper and launched a withering attack on the British press, describing coverage of Meghan as \u2018bullying\u2019.\n\nHe claimed the couple had been hit by \u2018relentless propaganda\u2019, adding: \u2018I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.\u2019\n\nThe announcement of the lawsuit on Tuesday overshadowed the end of the Sussexes\u2019 highly successful ten-day tour of Africa. Harry was criticised for the timing of the statement and it was reported advisers had warned it would push the tour off the front pages.\n\nNeither Sara Latham, the couple\u2019s communications secretary, nor Samantha Cohen, their private secretary, is believed to have had any input into the statement and there was speculation Harry had not consulted Buckingham Palace, Prince Charles nor Prince William beforehand. There was reportedly puzzlement among officials that the statement was released before the end of the Government-funded tour. Engagements such as the couple\u2019s meeting with President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa received far less coverage because of it.\n\nKen Wharfe, who served as Princess Diana\u2019s bodyguard, called the statement \u2018a monumental misjudgment\u2019 while Good Morning Britain\u2019s Piers Morgan, a columnist for this newspaper, called the rant \u2018hysterically over-the-top\u2019, saying Harry had \u2018petrol bombed\u2019 positive press coverage of the tour.\n\nMr Markle is particularly upset Meghan\u2019s friends used the People magazine article to misinterpret something he wrote in his letter of response to his daughter, in which he suggested he and Meghan should pose for a press photo together.\n\nMeghan\u2019s anonymous friend is quoted in the magazine saying: \u2018He writes her a really long letter in return, and he closes it by requesting a photo op with her. And she feels like, \u201cThat\u2019s the opposite of what I\u2019m saying. I\u2019m telling you I don\u2019t want to communicate through the media and you\u2019re asking me to communicate through the media. Did you hear anything I said?\u201d It\u2019s almost like they\u2019re ships passing. He knows how to get in touch with her. Her telephone number hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s never called, he\u2019s never texted.\u2019\n\nThomas Markle is particularly upset Meghan\u2019s friends used the People magazine article to misinterpret something he wrote in his letter of response to his daughter, in which he suggested he and Meghan should pose for a press photo together. Pictured in 2002\n\nMr Markle insists he suggested the photo as a way of showing the world they could be friends again and described his daughter\u2019s interpretation as a \u2018tragic misunderstanding\u2019.\n\n\u2018When Doria [Meghan\u2019s mother] was photographed with Meghan and Harry for the first time it showed she was part of the family. I don\u2019t want a picture for any other reason than if we show harmony then the press will back off.\u2019\n\nIt was also falsely stated that he never tried to contact Meghan after her wedding. Mr Markle showed this newspaper texts proving he had subsequently attempted to contact his daughter multiple times on the only number he has for her; a number from which both she and Prince Harry texted him in the run-up to the wedding.\n\nHe called that number in the presence of a reporter from the MoS but an automatic voice recording said the line was \u2018restricted or unavailable\u2019.\n\nMeghan Markle's (pictured in South Africa on October 2) father, who lives in Rosarito, Mexico, said he was \u2018devastated\u2019 when the existence of the letter was made public\n\nMr Markle was deeply hurt his daughter did not use her letter to enquire how he was doing after his heart attacks. \u2018There was no loving message in there, nothing asking about my health, nothing from her saying, \u201cLet\u2019s get together and heal our differences.\u201d\n\n\u2018When I opened the letter I was hoping it was the olive branch I\u2019d longed for. I was expecting something that would be a pathway to reconciliation. Instead it was deeply hurtful. I was so devastated I couldn\u2019t show it to anyone \u2013 and never would have, had it not been for the People magazine piece which meant I had to release portions to defend myself.\u2019\n\nMr Markle still hopes a reconciliation with his daughter is possible: \u2018I don\u2019t recognise the person who wrote the letter but I still love my daughter. All it would take is one phone call and most of this craziness would stop.\u2019\n\nNo payment was requested or given for this article.\n\nHow Meghan Markle's 'special sisterhood' told US celebrity magazine intimate stories about hand warmers for Royal guards, cookies by the bed - and THAT bombshell letter\n\nBy Ian Gallagher\n\nEarlier this year a group of five women \u2013 the Duchess of Sussex\u2019s inner circle \u2013 resolved to \u2018speak the truth\u2019 about their royal friend to an American celebrity magazine. Exactly how they arrived at the decision to collectively \u2018break their silence\u2019 and fight what they called the \u2018global bullying\u2019 endured by Meghan will no doubt emerge in time.\n\nWith its blend of celebrity and human interest stories, People has a readership of 35 million\n\nIt has been widely reported that the resulting article was sanctioned by the Duchess herself, something she and Kensington Palace has never denied.\n\nTo many Royal commentators, it seemed inconceivable that this well-meaning quintet would run to People magazine to \u2018set the record straight\u2019 and criticise her father without her blessing.\n\nClearly the women \u2013 identified only as a long-time friend, a co-star, a former colleague, a friend from Los Angeles and a close confidante \u2013 intended to make an impact with their anonymous attempt at reputation management.\n\nWith its blend of celebrity and human interest stories, People has a readership of 35 million. The five friends monopolised the February 18 edition, their words spread over eight glossy pages and heralded with the front cover headline: The Truth About Meghan.\n\nThey spoke of the Duchess being \u2018guided by a deep sense of gratitude and humility\u2019 and being someone who \u2018personifies elegance, grace, philanthropy\u2019. One friend said: \u2018Forget the fact of who she is married to: she was royalty from the day I met her.\u2019\n\nThe article included private details of the couple\u2019s life at Kensington Palace, where they were then living.\n\nDuchess of Sussex' friends spoke of her being \u2018guided by a deep sense of gratitude and humility\u2019 and being someone who \u2018personifies elegance, grace, philanthropy\u2019. Pictured in Johannesburg on October 2\n\nReaders learned that the Duchess can knock up a \u2018five-star meal\u2019 from leftovers and how, far from being imperious and waited on hand and foot, she paints her own nails, does all her own make-up, treats staff to ice cream and sorbets and gives hand warmers to Palace guards because she doesn\u2019t like the \u2018guys to be cold\u2019.\n\nOne friend said: \u2018There\u2019s a false assumption that she lives in some gilded palace with staff and ladies-in-waiting and all those Royal perks. It\u2019s simply not true. We\u2019ve all been to their cottage. It\u2019s small and she\u2019s made it cosy. Meg cooks for herself and Harry every single day \u2013 there\u2019s no chef or butler.\u2019\n\nHer Los Angeles friend described spending a couple of days with Meghan. \u2018Her husband was out of town on work. In the room she made up for me, there was a candle, cookies by the bed, slippers and a robe. We were the only two in the house. She made the most lovely meals\u2026 It was raining and muddy outside, so the dogs got all dirty and she\u2019s wiping them off with towels.\u2019\n\nIn a similar vein, her \u2018long-time\u2019 friend added: \u2018I was with her last month, and she was going on a public engagement. Harry and I were sitting with the dogs, and we were all chatty, and she was painting her nails\u2026 She\u2019s very self-service.\u2019\n\nIn the magazine, the five friends \u2013 who are said to \u2018form a special sisterhood\u2019 \u2013 portray Meghan and Harry as \u2018very grounded\u2019 (the couple are pictured on October 2 in Johannesburg)\n\nRecalling boxes she saw lining the couple\u2019s Kensington Palace cottage, the friend adds: \u2018[Meghan] said, \u201cThey\u2019re hand warmers. Every time it gets cold like this, I take them to the guard stations. The guards are standing at their posts, and I don\u2019t want the guys to be cold.\u201d \u2019\n\nThe same friend reportedly caused consternation in Royal circles by revealing in the next breath the Duchess writes her own speeches and \u2018many of Harry\u2019s\u2019. She added: \u2018They do it together.\u2019\n\nOf the claim that the Duchess fires off 5am emails to staff, another friend told the magazine: \u2018The email thing is such a weird slant on someone who is actually an incredibly organised, focused, hard-working person.\u2019\n\nSignificantly, it was also this article that alerted the world to the existence of a letter written by Meghan to her father, Thomas Markle \u2013 the letter that is now at the centre of a legal dispute between the Duchess and The Mail on Sunday.\n\nOne friend is quoted in the People article as saying: \u2018After the wedding she wrote him a letter. She\u2019s like, \u201cDad, I\u2019m so heartbroken. I love you. I have one father. Please stop victimising me through the media so we can repair our relationship.\u201d \u2019\n\nThe friend adds: \u2018He writes her a really long letter in return and he closes it by requesting a photo op with her. And she feels like, \u201cThat\u2019s the opposite of what I\u2019m saying. I\u2019m telling you I don\u2019t want to communicate through the media, and you\u2019re asking me to communicate through the media. Did you hear anything I said?\u201d It\u2019s almost like they\u2019re ships passing.\n\nHer Los Angeles friend described spending a couple of days with Meghan (pictured in South-Africa). \u2018Her husband was out of town on work. In the room she made up for me, there was a candle, cookies by the bed, slippers and a robe'\n\n\u2018He knows how to get in touch with her. Her telephone number hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s never called; he\u2019s never texted.\u2019\n\nOne unforeseen consequence of the friend\u2019s description of the letter from Meghan to her father was that it spurred Mr Markle to defend himself against what was clearly a very public admonishment. Some Royal observers have suggested that, had Palace courtiers been consulted about the article, not blindsided by it, they might well have anticipated his likely response.\n\nAs it was, the repercussions were devastating.\n\nMr Markle, now 75, had kept the letter, which he received the previous August, three months after his daughter\u2019s wedding.\n\nHe had no intention of showing it to anyone. That, at least, was the position until he read the People article six months later. It left him \u2018devastated\u2019.\n\nElsewhere in the magazine, the five friends \u2013 who are said to \u2018form a special sisterhood\u2019 \u2013 portray Meghan and Harry as \u2018very grounded\u2019. One said: \u2018She has a firm understanding of the things she can and can\u2019t control. And she tries not to put any effort into the things she can\u2019t control.\u2019\n\nIt was reported at the time that the Palace was informed by magazine staff about the article only minutes before publication.\n\nThe following day former Buckingham Palace press secretary Dickie Arbiter, who worked as a media manager for both Prince Charles and the late Diana, Princess of Wales, observed presciently: \u2018Assuming \u2013 and as these sources are anonymous we don\u2019t know for sure \u2013 that this was done with her agreement, it has opened a Pandora\u2019s Box, in my opinion.\n\n\u2018The issue with her father is an open wound and I\u2019m not entirely sure it is the best idea to aggravate that.\u2019", "description": "Retired Hollywood lighting director Thomas Markle, 75, has spoken for the first time since his daughter issued her writ against this newspaper for publishing parts of the letter.", "authors": ["Caroline Graham In Rosarito", "Mexico For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/21/19342444-0-image-a-18_1570307920155.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
