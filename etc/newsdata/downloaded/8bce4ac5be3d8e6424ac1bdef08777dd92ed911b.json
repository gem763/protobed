The deal should allow the U.S.-made fighter jets to gradually replace Poland\u2019s fleet of Mikoyan MiG-29 and Sukhoi Su-22 jets, both Russian-made.\n\n\u201cThis proposed sale will support the foreign policy and national security of the United States by improving the security of a NATO ally, which is an important force for political stability and economic progress in Europe,\u201d the Defense Department said in its announcement. \u201cThis proposed sale of F-35s will provide Poland with a credible defense capability to deter aggression in the region and ensure interoperability with U.S. forces.\u201d\n\nAlthough the deal could still be blocked or modified by Congress, it has so far not met significant opposition there.\n\nThe deal should also give a not-insignificant boost to Lockheed\u2019s foreign sales, which have contributed to windfall profits for the Bethesda-based defense manufacturer. It should help Lockheed compensate for a recent U.S. decision to cancel planned deliveries of 100 F-35 jets to Turkey.\n\nAnd it comes at a time when the F-35 program is ramping up production, with the Defense Department pursuing larger deals in a bid to bring the plane\u2019s unit price down. The company delivered 29 of them in the most recent quarter.\n\nIn early June, the Defense Department and Lockheed Martin announced a tentative agreement to procure 470 new F-35s for the Air Force, Navy, Marines and allied militaries. The $34 billion deal is \u201cthe largest procurement in the history of the [Defense] Department,\u201d according to a statement from the Pentagon.", "description": "The order for 32 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters is part of an expanded military partnership between the United States and Poland.", "authors": ["Aaron Gregg", "Reporter Covering The Defense Industry", "Commercial Aviation", "Government Contractors.", "September At Pm", "Aaron Gregg Covers The Defense Industry", "Government Contractors For The Washington Post'S Business Section."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/-_pGsmz4-sCG26Q5XRHwMwejpAA=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XIJSVCUNNEI6TNXUAMZVMUBNZY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
