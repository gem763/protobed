I even changed from the beginning to the final because I was a teenager growing up.\n\n\"It's really weird for me, I feel like a completely different person, I've grown up in the industry so and it's mad some of the stuff I've been through.\"\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nHe added: \"I'm in a lucky position that I still have a career 10 years down the line because it is cutthroat, it is a tough industry to stay a part of.\n\n\"I said 10 years ago that I hope I'm still doing it 10 years later, so maybe I should say that again. I'll do it as long as I enjoy it, if I woke up tomorrow and I hated it I'd stop doing it.\"\n\n* Joe is starring as The Spirit of the Mirror in panto Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs at the Birmingham Hippodrome this year\n\n* His The Impossible Dream tour kicks off on November 3 and his new album is due for release next year\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
