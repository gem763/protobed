He rotated heavily in midweek, with the likes of Sokratis, Mesut Ozil and Nicholas Pepe all set to come back into the side.\n\nVilla have been boosted by the return of Matt Targett, who has not featured since his move from Southampton in the summer.\n\nDean Smith also has Trezeguet available, after he missed the West Ham game through suspension.\n\nPredicted Line-ups\n\nArsenal \u2013 Leno; Maitland-Niles Sokratis, David Luiz, Kolasinac; Guendouzi, Ceballos; Pepe, Ozil, Nelson; Aubameyang\u200b\n\nVilla \u2013 Heaton; Guilbert, Engels, Mings, Taylor; Douglas Luiz, McGinn, Grealish; Jota, Wesley, Trezeguet\n\nWhen is it?\n\nKick off between Arsenal and Villa is 4.30pm on Sunday September 22.\n\nHow can I watch it?\n\nDue to the Chelsea vs Liverpool match kicking off at the same time, no UK channel will be broadcasting the game live.\n\nHighlights will be available to watch on Match of the Day 2 on Sunday night at 10.35pm on BBC One.\n\nOdds\n\nArsenal 2/5\n\nDraw 4/1\n\nVilla 7/1\n\nOur Prediction\n\nArsenal and Villa both tend to play expansively, so we can expect this game to be open with chances for both sides.\n\nBjorn Engels and Tyrone Mings have impressed for Villa at the back, but will face their toughest test yet in Aubameyang and Pepe, with the latter keen to get his first goal for the club.\n\nWesley has come under some criticism since his move from Club Brugge, but faces an Arsenal defence that have looked shaky in every match and may be able to profit.\n\nArsenal 3-1 Villa\n\nArsenal will need to improve on their last league game, a 2-2 draw at Watford where defeat looked likely despite having been two goals up. Aubameyang is chasing the golden boot once again this season. A hat trick today would take him level with Aguero on eight. Aston Villa will be looking to move out of the relegation zone. Their only league win came against Everton just under a month ago. Lacazette injured, but Aubameyang and 18 year old Saka produced the goods in Germany on Thursday. The latter an exciting prospect. Another big day for him against Villa.
