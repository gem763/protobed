You have enough money. You don\u2019t need to trademark a phrase. #RiseandShineIsNotYours\" a fourth frustrated fan penned.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nDespite the trademark application, Kylie is raking in profits for the song.\n\nHer online store The Kylie Shop offered a $65 hoodie baring the new phrase, but it recently sold out.\n\nThe clip emerged when Kylie sang briefly to daughter Stormi in her Kylie Cosmetics office, and it blew up across the Internet. That's all it took.\n\nShe's already in talks with pop-star Ariana Grande to sample the viral clip that has given her the spotlight.\n\nThe business mogul took it to the extreme on Thursday morning as she posted a picture of her face posing as the iconic sun from the Teletubbies.\n\n\"No caption needed,\" she joked.\n\nBut she's using this opportunity to her advantage, as the star has now released a collection of hoodies with \"Riise\" and \"Shiiinnee\" penned on the sleeves - with her own face as the sun.", "description": "Fans have slammed her for trademarking the hit lullaby which became an internet sensation last week", "authors": ["Brogan-Leigh Hurst", "Image", "Instagram"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20708486.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_MAIN-Kylie-Jenner.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
