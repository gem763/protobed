Yes, it\u2019s a story with a heroine who has to defy her family, stand up for her principles, save the man she loves, and is finally lifted up in a floaty pink dress \u2013 but you can still be a powerful woman in a floaty pink dress, after all. And you should never put up with being put in a corner, no matter what you\u2019re wearing.\n\nIf our heroine, Baby, is an underrated feminist icon, Penny \u2013 Johnny\u2019s dance partner, played by eighties pin-up Cynthia Rhodes \u2013 has the story that is the true challenge of the film. It\u2019s the substance too; it\u2019s what gives the whole thing some proper gravitas. Dirty Dancing shows a middle stage of womanhood that is so often unrepresented, ignored, trivialised, or suppressed with endless daily concerns of motherhood. Penny has a genuine crisis to attend to, her abortion, and frankly, let\u2019s be honest, we\u2019ve all had our scares. Despite her immense glamour, Penny is, in fact, the \u201ceverywoman\u201d. She\u2019s all of us, hiding inside the most perfect shell.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Currently \u2013 there are no guarantees as to whether it will remain. As I write, the US Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case which many view as a conduit to the dismantling of Roe v Wade. Expected to be heard in June 2020, the case concerns Louisiana legislature that, if upheld, would see the state left with just one doctor authorised to perform abortions. And closer to home, Northern Ireland, despite recent advances in the case of rape, incest, and extreme foetal abnormalities, still will not provide safe and legal abortions for other women who are unable to safely and responsibly continue with a pregnancy.\n\nIn Dirty Dancing, Penny has no choice but to pay for an illegal procedure. Rhodes plays the role so well \u2013 tough and desperate, vulnerable and steely, tearful and mature. And it is Penny\u2019s good character that saves her. She digs in, she knows how to take responsibility for herself, she doesn\u2019t bother with Robbie again once it\u2019s clear he\u2019s not going to help \u2013 she takes it all on herself. Penny is nails. What a woman.\n\nAnd it\u2019s Baby \u2013 a 17-year-old girl, who immediately understands what she needs and tries to fix it. Her offer of help is automatic. There is zero discussion of the ethics of abortion. It is a given to all who know and care for Penny that it is the necessary and correct course of action. Our hero Johnny and his cousin Billy are right there with her, and it only makes the men sexier and more appealing for not questioning Penny\u2019s right to do as she does.\n\nEven when Baby\u2019s father Jake Houseman finds out, there doesn\u2019t appear to be any judgement on Penny, only concern for her health and disgust for the \u201cbutcher\u201d who didn\u2019t do a good job. It is an extraordinary scene \u2013 thanks mainly to the restraint in the writing, plus the powerful performances. It would be so easy for the film to lecture us at this point, or make Jake a patriarchal bogeyman, but writer Bergstein does neither. She just lets her characters be who they are \u2013 what they don\u2019t say is more important than what they do. It\u2019s not very feminist of me to think this way, but look, we all need a day off \u2013 men who promote and support women\u2019s rights are sexy. There\u2019s no point denying it.\n\nPro-choice campaigners have since called Dirty Dancing the \u201cgold standard\u201d in depicting an abortion on screen. Dirty Dancing showed me as a young girl, in the most delicate and gentle way possible, that should similar issues arise in my life, I could count on other women to help me. Penny is not alone \u2013 the touching gathering of all the other shocked dancers outside the cabin where she is moaning in pain also showed me that it doesn\u2019t have to be a source of shame either. You just have to ask for help, and a community will draw close.\n\nFemale solidarity and male support are the twin poles holding up Dirty Dancing as a feminist trailblazer \u2013 a film that weaves a difficult and upsetting issue into an otherwise joyful confection in a principled, careful way. I loved Johnny for supporting Penny all the way. I loved Billy for doing his best to arrange the abortion itself. I loved Jake for treating Penny with such gentle respect. But most of all, I loved Baby for diving in there and making it happen, without a moment\u2019s hesitation. She gets the money. She learns the dance. She covers for Penny. She gets her dad. She is a force to be reckoned with.\n\nI Carried A Watermelon: Dirty Dancing and Me by Katy Brand is published by HQ, HarperCollins in hardback, ebook and audiobook", "description": "Dirty Dancing is a feminist manifesto.
