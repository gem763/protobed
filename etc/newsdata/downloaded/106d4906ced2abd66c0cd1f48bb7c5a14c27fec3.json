Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) told the N.Y. Times: \"It\u2019s like if you had a big, 1,000-piece puzzle on a table. This fills in a lot of pieces of the puzzle.\"\n\nAnother big dump on Trump will come Nov. 19, with the publication of \"A Warning,\" a book by the anonymous senior Trump administration official who penned a mysterious and damaging N.Y. Times op-ed last year.\n\nThe author is represented by Keith Urbahn and Matt Latimer of Javelin.\n\nLatimer told the WashPost's Phil Rucker that the author didn't take an advance, \"and intends to donate some of the royalties to nonprofit organizations that focus on government accountability and supporting truth-tellers, ... including the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association.\"\n\nLast evening, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement: \"President Trump has done nothing wrong \u2014 this is a coordinated smear campaign from far-left lawmakers and radical unelected bureaucrats.\"\n\n\"There was no quid pro quo. Today was just more triple hearsay.\"\n\nGo deeper ...
