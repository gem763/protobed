The biomedical firm Ambry Genetics Corp. manufactures the test, which launched Tuesday.\n\nDNA testing is the standard for hereditary cancer screening, but it excludes large portions of hereditary material, thereby missing variants that increase risks for cancer. But adding RNA to DNA testing can provide more evidence about whether genes have the variants, according to Ambry Genetics.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time we are offering paired DNA and RNA testing,\u201d said Emily Dalton, director of the genetic specialist team at Ambry Genetics. \u201cIt\u2019s going to allow us to identify more patients who are at risk for hereditary cancers and actually provide more accurate results to inform patient care as well.\u201d\n\nResearchers also have developed a single blood test that can detect numerous cancers with a degree of accuracy that exceeds 99%.\n\nThe test, made by the health care company GRAIL, uses next-generation sequencing technology to search for tiny chemical tags (methylation) in DNA that affect whether genes are active or inactive. It detected more than 20 cancers including breast, colorectal, esophageal, gallbladder, lung and leukemia.\n\nWhen the test was applied to nearly 3,600 blood samples, it successfully picked up a cancer signal from cancer patient samples and pinpointed the tissue where the cancer began.\n\nGeoffrey Oxnard, thoracic oncologist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and one of the study\u2019s researchers, said the blood test uses the cancerous genes to better find cancers.\n\n\u201cIf we know what a cancerous DNA looks like, then we can go hunting for it,\u201d Dr. Oxnard said. \u201cWe can hunt for all the cancers and then once we found a signal, we can clarify if that is a colon cancer signal or a head and neck signal. And that\u2019s amazing.\u201d\n\nWhile some cancers are related to a patient\u2019s inherited genetics, Dr. Oxnard said cancerous genes more often are \u201ccompletely haywire\u201d in different ways.\n\nThis year, an estimated 1,762,450 new cancer cases will be diagnosed in the United States and 606,880 people will die from the disease, according to the National Cancer Institute.\n\nThe most common types of cancer, according to 2018 figures, are breast, lung and bronchus, prostate, colon and rectum, melanoma, bladder, non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, kidney and renal pelvis, endometrial, leukemia, pancreatic, thyroid and liver.\n\nThis year, almost 700,000 people in the U.S. are expected to seek testing to determine whether they have genetic mutations linked to increased risks of cancers. Of those, an estimated 16,000 people could be affected by the new paired genetic test, said Ambry Genetics.\n\nKara Milliron, genetic counselor at the University of Michigan\u2019s comprehensive cancer center, said results from genetic testing for cancer screening could come back in three ways: positive, negative or \u201cvariant of unknown or uncertain significance.\u201d\n\nShe said the paired genetic testing provides a better look and interpretation of these variants of unknown significance. The University of Michigan\u2019s cancer center was one of more than 40 sites in a pilot study that used the +RNAinsight tests on patients.\n\n\u201cCancer is a significant public health problem. It causes tremendous morbidity and mortality every year,\u201d Ms. Milliron said. \u201cAny improvements to genetic testing where we can get better answers for patients I think is really, really important. And it does have a significant impact on our ability to take care of patients in the best way.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
