My first Diwali at home in Delhi after 20 years.\n\n\u2018Could not have thought of a better occasion to come back to Instagram and use this platform to spread love, to spread light, and to hopefully help bring you closer to yourself, because no matter where you are in your life we all have the ability to shine our inner light on this world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018So\u2026 I\u2019m back now; let\u2019s you and me get together, and light up all the dark corners of this world. Deal? #diwali\u2019\n\nConsider it a deal, Kunal.\n\nIn the photos, Kunal is seen sporting some dapper black and gold jack and new facial hair including a twizzly new \u2018stache.\n\nThe post was the first he uploaded in four months, last appearing in the south of France overlooking the sea, announcing that he was going travelling with his family and encouraging others to be kind.\n\nSince then, the only thing known about what he\u2019s been up to was the fact he purchased Nicolas Cage\u2019s old home in LA, priced at a not-too-shabby $7.5million (\u00a35.8million).\n\nMore: The Big Bang Theory Did you spot The Big Bang Theory star in Netflix's Unbelievable?
