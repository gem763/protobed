The news momentarily stole the shine from a third quarter earnings report that defied expectations, even as mega-sized opioid settlements proliferate around the country.\n\nHowever, JNJ is mostly unfazed by these developments, at least publicly. In this week\u2019s Q3 earnings call, CFO Joseph Wolk shed some light on the company\u2019s surprise decision to settle with two Ohio counties, rather than fighting it in court.\n\n\u201cIn Ohio you saw something different,\u201d Wolk said, explaining a \u201cdivergent paths\u201d approach that may hint at JNJ\u2019s future strategy.\n\n\u201cWe saw a reasonable amount in proportion to other companies that were involved as defendants,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were particularly pleased to see that the funds were going to victims of opioid addiction and so for many reasons there we though the best path for all stakeholders was settlement.\u201d\n\nSettling cases is \u201csomething we will always take into account in terms of what is the best solution for all stakeholders, including investors who obviously want certainty,\u201d Wolk added.\n\nThe $20.4 million combined settlement last week took some JNJ watchers by surprise, given that the health care giant has typically been unafraid of taking its chances in front of a jury \u2014 a luxury it has given its hefty balance sheet.\n\nRecently, S&P analyst David Kaplan told Yahoo Finance that a landmark $572 million Oklahoma opioid verdict may be playing a role in JNJ\u2019s thinking.\n\n\u201cMy sense is that in the Oklahoma case, they were the last ones standing and they kind of bore the burden for everybody,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think that they don\u2019t want to stand there alone. It was a little bit of a surprise to me,\u201d according to Kaplan.\n\nMeanwhile, JNJ is reportedly working on a $4 billion settlement to avoid more than 2,500 opioid lawsuits, according to the Wall Street Journal. That sum is significantly less than the $50 billion experts conservatively estimated.\n\nJNJ is one of several pharmaceutical defendants in the cases, along with OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma, Endo International, Mallinkrodt and Teva Pharmacueticals, which is also said to be working on a settlement.\n\nEndo and Mallinkrodt have settled some cases, and drug distributors AmeriSource Bergen, McKesson and Cardinal Health are in talks to settle all cases for $18 billion.\n\nAnjalee Khemlani is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
