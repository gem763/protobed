Johnson says he will walk away from the Brexit talks if the EU refuses to \u201cengage\u201d with the U.K. plan.\n\nBritain narrowly voted in 2016 to leave the EU but remains deeply divided over the departure terms.\n\nAccusing his political opponents of seeking endless Brexit delays, Johnson will tell Conservatives that Britain must leave the EU on Oct. 31 so that \u201cin 2020, our country can move on.\u201d\n\nA Brexit agreement between the EU and his predecessor, Theresa May, was rejected three times by the U.K. Parliament, largely because of opposition to the \u201cbackstop,\u201d an insurance policy designed to ensure there is no return to customs posts or other infrastructure on the Irish border.\n\nAn open border underpins both the local economy and Northern Ireland\u2019s peace process. But Johnson and other British Brexit supporters oppose the backstop because it would keep the U.K. tightly bound to EU trade rules in order to avoid customs checks - limiting the country\u2019s ability to strike new trade deals around the world.\n\nSo far, the U.K. has floated the idea of a common area for livestock and agricultural products, plus largely untested \u201ctechnological solutions\u201d as a replacement for the backstop.\n\nThe Daily Telegraph reported the new U.K. plan proposes to keep Northern Ireland in a regulatory zone with the EU for food, agricultural and industrial products until 2025. The EU has previously rejected any proposals that contain a time limit.\n\nJohnson said late Tuesday that convincing the EU to strike a deal would not be \u201ca walk in the park,\u201d but he thought the agreement could be reached by the time the bloc\u2019s leaders meet for a key summit in Brussels on Oct. 17-18.\n\n\u201cWe have made huge progress and I hope very much that in the course of the next few days we are going to get there,\u201d he told a reception at the Conservative conference.\n\nJohnson says the U.K. can handle any bumps that come from tumbling out of the bloc without a deal, which would mean the instant imposition of customs checks and other barriers between Britain and the EU, its biggest trading partner.\n\nBut the U.K. government and businesses both say the disruptions would be substantial, with the flow of goods coming into Britain through the major Channel port of Dover cut in half.\n\nMany lawmakers want to prevent a no-deal exit and have passed a law that compels the government to seek a delay to Brexit if it can\u2019t get an agreement with the EU by Oct. 19. Johnson says he won\u2019t do that \u2014 though he also insists he will obey the law.\n\nIn his conference speech, Johnson will say \u201cwe can, we must and we will\u201d leave the EU on Oct. 31 \u2014 promising weary voters a life beyond the Brexit morass.\n\nWhether Britain leaves the EU on Oct. 31 or not, Johnson is likely to face the verdict of voters in an election before the end of the year.\n\n\u201cVoters are desperate for us to focus on their other priorities. What people want \u2014 what leavers want, what remainers want, what the whole world wants \u2014 is to move on,\u201d he\u2019ll say.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will send what he says is the U.K.'s \"final offer\" for a Brexit deal to the European Union on Wednesday, as the date for Britain's departure from the bloc looms in less than a month.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jill Lawless"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/01/britain_politics_27915_c0-215-5137-3210_s1770x1032.jpg?357a1e148b5664f7179b09ce1c3b8e555d2606b4"}
