Ilhan Omar is in hot water for another controversial vote she made Tuesday.\n\nBoston Celtics star Enes Kanter, who is Turkish, tore into the Minnesota Democrat for voting against Turkish sanctions.\n\n'What an absolute disappointment and shame that the only [D]emocrat who did NOT support the Turkish bill aiming to stop the killing of innocent people is @IlhanMN who seems like [she's] on #DictatorErdogan's payroll working for his interests, but not for the American people and democracy!'\n\nBoston Celtics player Enes Kanter, who is Turkish, used Twitter Wednesday to call out Rep. Ilhan Omar for voting against Turkish sanctions\n\nOn Tuesday night, Boston Celtics player Enes Kanter shamed Rep. Ilhan Omar on Twitter over her vote saying she seemed to be on the payroll of 'dictator' Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\n\nRep. Ilhan Omar is taking heat for two controversial votes she made Tuesday. She voted no on a House bill to push President Trump to impose sanctions on Turkey. She also voted 'present' on a House resolution that would commemorate the Armenian genocide\n\nThe House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted 403 to 16 to pass the Turkish sanctions bill. She was the lone Democrative no vote, joining 15 Republicans in her objections.\n\nOmar had previously penned an op-ed for the Washington Post calling sanctions part of a 'failed foreign policy playbook.'\n\n'Accountability for the invasion of northern Syria is essential,' Omar argued Tuesday.\n\n'Turkey\u2019s incursion and the ensuing fallout is a humanitarian catastrophe\u2014especially for the Kurdish people. But too often our sanctions policies are ill-considered, inhumane and hurt the very people we claim to be helping,' she continued.\n\nShe said the sanctions being imposed would 'hurt civilians rather than political leaders.'\n\n'There are positive policies we could pursue - like banning or limiting weapons sales or creating a buffer zone - but pursuing sanctions that have no chance of being signed into law is the wrong response at the wrong time,' she said.\n\nDirectly after casting a no vote against sanctions, Omar voted 'present' as the House voted 405 to 11 on a resolution making it U.S. policy to commemorate the Armenian Genocide at the hands of the Ottoman Turks from 1915 to 1923.\n\nIt had strong backing from celebrate advocate Kim Kardashian, who is of Armenian descent.\n\nThe vote is expected to inflame the U.S. relationship with Turkey.\n\nThe resolution also 'reject efforts to associate the U.S. government with efforts to deny the existence of the Armenian Genocide or any genocide.'\n\nOnly Republicans cast no votes. One Democrat joined her in voting present, Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas. Republican Rep Paul Gosar of Arizona also voted present.\n\nThe other present votes were Republican Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona and Democratic Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas.\n\nOmar explained her vote in a statement.\n\n'I also believe accountability for human rights violations - especially ethnic cleansing and genocide - is paramount. But accountability and recognition of genocide should not be used as cudgel in a political fight.'\n\n'It should be done based on academic consensus outside the push and pull of geopolitics,' she continued. 'A true acknowledgement of historical crimes against humanity must include both the heinous genocides of the 20th century, along with earlier mass slaughters like the transatlantic slave trade and Native American genocide, which took the lives of hundreds of millions of indigenous people in this country.'\n\n'For this reason, I voted \"present\" on final passage of H.Res. 296, the resolution Affirming the United States record on the Armenian Genocide,' Omar added.\n\nOmar is slated to appear with Sen. Bernie Sanders in Minneapolis on Sunday as she makes her endorsement of the 2020 hopeful official. Sanders has been holding rallies with members of the so-called 'squad' who have announced their support of him.\n\nHe hosted a post-heart attack rally in New York City alongside Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez earlier in the month.\n\nHe also stood side-by-side Rep. Rashida Tlaib in her home city of Detroit.\n\nSanders' event with Omar had to be moved to a bigger venue at the University of Minnesota, his campaign announced Tuesday, due to 'high demand.'\n\n", "description": "Rep.
