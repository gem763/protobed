A sharp reduction in export prices shines light on poor underlying demand fundamentals for thermal coal in the domestic market.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe St. Clairsville, Ohio-based Murray Energy has reached a restructuring agreement with its creditors and will finance its operations with cash on hand and a $350 million debtor-in-possession financing facility, the company said in a statement. Robert Murray, who founded the company with a single Ohio mine in 1988, will step down as chief executive and become chairman of the board. He\u2019ll be replaced by Robert Moore, who has served as the company\u2019s executive vice president, chief operating officer and chief financial officer, according to the reorganization plan.\n\nMurray, who started working in coal mines at 16 to support his family, has long been a Trump ally, donating generously and hosting a fundraiser in West Virginia for the president this summer. In 2017, Murray met with White House energy officials to offer an \u201caction plan\u201d calling for deep cuts in the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s staff, withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement, a rollback of safety and pollution regulations and the repeal of President Barack Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan.\n\nWithin a year, the administration followed through by pledging to withdraw from the Paris accord, delivering cuts at the EPA and beginning to repeal and replace the Obama-era plan to curb climate-warming emissions from coal-fired power plants.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYet at other times Murray\u2019s efforts to have the federal government throw a lifeline to the sinking U.S. coal industry were spurned by independent agencies despite support from Trump and his deputies.\n\nLast year, regulators on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, including four selected by Trump, unanimously rejected a proposal from Energy Secretary Rick Perry widely seen as a way of propping up ailing coal and nuclear plants.\n\nAnd in February, Trump tried to intervene with the Tennessee Valley Authority to keep open two coal plants that bought most of their coal from Murray. But the independent agency defied Trump and voted to close the plants anyway.\n\nAD\n\nThe always outspoken Murray has blasted FERC as \u201cfeckless\u201d for failing to protect coal plants and said he is \u201cextremely disappointed\" in the TVA\u2019s decision.\n\nAD\n\nBut Murray reserved his sharpest criticism for Obama, who he once called \u201cthe greatest enemy I\u2019ve ever had in my life\u201d for issuing regulations he saw as destructive to the industry in which he had spent his entire working life.\n\nMurray Energy operates more than a dozen mines throughout Ohio, Kentucky, West Virginia, Illinois and Utah and produced 76 million tons of coal annually. The company employs 7,000 people, according to its website, and counts billions in unfunded retirement benefits and workers\u2019 compensation among its liabilities, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNow comes the part where workers and their families pay the price for corporate decision-making and governmental actions,\u201d the United Mine Workers of America, which represents a large chunk of Murray Energy\u2019s full time employees, said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cMurray will file a motion in bankruptcy court to throw out its collective bargaining agreement with the union. It will seek to be relieved of its obligations to retirees, their dependents and widows. We have seen this sad act too many times before.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The private coal giant whose founder pushed the Trump administration for an overhaul of what it called \u201canti-coal\u201d environmental policy is the fifth coal company to seek bankruptcy protection this year.", "authors": ["Taylor Telford", "Reporter Covering National", "Breaking News", "Dino Grandoni", "Reporter Covering Energy", "Environmental Policy"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/dbSTqR0y3OdQiDBkIiMs1rtLKNA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7ZHQNCW3U4I6PISBBBEDCVSC2A.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
