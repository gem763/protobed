(AP) - The theater staging a play about the notorious late Mayor Vincent \u201cBuddy\u201d Cianci says it has raised just $500 for the charity bearing his name, while collecting donations during the show\u2019s sold-out run.\n\nTrinity Repertory Company is raising money for the educational foundation during \u201cThe Prince of Providence ,\u201d with solicitations in programs, collection buckets at the door nightly and Cianci\u2019s own pasta sauce for sale. These efforts had raised about $500 as of Friday, the theater said.\n\nCianci established a college scholarship fund for Providence school children in 1994, during his second stint in office and before he was sent to prison in 2002 for presiding over widespread corruption in City Hall. An Associated Press examination in 2014 found the charity had amassed hundreds of thousands of dollars, but gave out just a few thousand per year in grants and spent most of its money on expenses other than scholarships. Cianci said then they were building the fund so it continues making money.\n\nCianci\u2019s charities were overhauled after he died in January 2016, merging into the Cianci Educational Foundation.\n\nThe theater says it didn\u2019t seek or receive any assurances from the foundation that it\u2019s being run well today, or have any concerns. The play, which premiered Sept. 12, was extended due to its popularity and ends Sunday.\n\nCianci\u2019s nephew, Brad Turchetta, had hoped the theater would raise more for the foundation. By comparison, Turchetta said, the Graduate Hotel in Providence removed portraits of Cianci in response to a complaint about his criminal history and sold them, raising roughly $15,000 to $20,000 for the foundation\u2019s scholarships.\n\nTurchetta, the foundation\u2019s executor, said Trinity offered to fundraise after some of Cianci\u2019s relatives and friends publicly complained when it was announced in March that \u201cThe Prince of Providence\u201d would be inspired by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Mike Stanton\u2019s biography of the same name. They think the book is inaccurate and felt Cianci\u2019s memoir would\u2019ve been a better choice.\n\nTurchetta said the foundation is run differently now, with a board that distributed more than $20,000 last year in scholarships and follows the law regarding how much money raised needs to be given out. There was a board before, but mainly Cianci ran it, he added.\n\nTurchetta said Friday he\u2019d give the AP a recent tax form showing the changes, but hadn\u2019t done so by Tuesday.\n\nThe most recent publicly available tax form covers the scholarship fund in 2015, prior to the merger. It shows nearly 55% of the disbursements were for contributions and gifts and about 45% was spent on operating and administrative expenses. The largest gift listed went to the commerce association in Providence\u2019s Federal Hill neighborhood, which Cianci often frequented.\n\nCharity evaluators look for at least 65% of disbursements to be spent on contributions, said Christopher Ryan Jr., an expert on trusts who teaches at Roger Williams University School of Law in Bristol, Rhode Island.\n\nFor years, no money from the \u201cMayor\u2019s Own Marinara Sauce\u201d was donated to the scholarship fund. A Cianci adviser told the AP in 2014 the sauce made $3 in income in total from 2009 to 2012.\n\nTurchetta said the sauce now provides several hundred dollars for the foundation monthly.\n\nCianci was known for his colorful TV appearances and publicity stunts touting Providence and himself. He was forced from office twice due to felonies. Cianci reinvented himself as the host of a popular radio talk show before attempting a comeback bid in 2014.\n\nCaitlin Howle, a spokeswoman for Trinity, said the theater thought the fundraising would recognize \u201cthe positive elements of Buddy\u2019s legacy.\u201d\n\nStanton said he wasn\u2019t consulted about fundraising and he dismissed criticism of his book Monday, saying it\u2019s fair and accurate and of course Cianci \u201cpartisans\u201d aren\u2019t going to like it.\n\nM. Charles Bakst, a retired political columnist for The Providence Journal, didn\u2019t donate when he saw the play. Bakst didn\u2019t mind the fundraising though, since donating was optional. It would\u2019ve given him pause if proceeds from ticket sales went to the foundation.\n\nThe AP\u2019s past reporting about Cianci\u2019s scholarship fund was \u201cjolting,\u201d Bakst said. Still, he was surprised more wasn\u2019t collected.\n\n\u201cA decent number of people who went to that show were fans of his and I would think they might be a little more apt to give,\u201d he said Monday.\n\nTurchetta appreciates the theater\u2019s gesture of goodwill and enjoyed seeing the play.\n\n\u201cIt keeps Buddy\u2019s name in the news and at the forefront,\u201d he said. \u201cBuddy would\u2019ve liked that.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The theater staging a play about the notorious late Mayor Vincent \"Buddy\" Cianci says it has raised just $500 for the charity bearing his name, while collecting donations during the show's sold-out run.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jennifer Mcdermott"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
