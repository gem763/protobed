Most of them, from both Republicans and Democrats, are more annoying than anything else. But sometimes, one comes along that just nails the issue right on its head. The latest example of this comes from Kentucky, where a group is running a series of digital ads addressing the transgender issue in kids' sports. The group, Campaign for American Principles, criticizes Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andy Beshear. The basic premise of these ads is that in the left's desire for transgender ideology to become reality, basic fairness is being stripped away.\n\n\"All female athletes want is a fair shot in competition at a scholarship, at a title, at victory,\" the video says overlapped across teenage girls competing. \"What if that shot was taken away by a competitor that claims they\u2019re a girl but was born a boy? Andy Beshear supports legislation that would destroy girls\u2019 sports. He calls it 'equality.' Maybe. But is it fair?\"\n\n\"Vote against Andy Beshear. He's too extreme for Kentucky.\"\n\n\"All any athlete wants is a fair shot in competition, but what if the rules change? if Andy Beshear gets his way anyone at any time can change teams for any reason. Vote against Andy Beshear he's too. Extreme for Kentucky,\" another video says, featuring wrestlers.\n\nSome may criticize these ads as political hyperbole. But, sadly, there is precedent. Virtually the exact same scenario is happening in Connecticut. Over the past couple years, a pair of biological boys who identify as female have dominated nearly every single track and field event. The unfairness has been so bad, that one girl is currently suing her state's high school athletic governing body.\n\nAs we saw at CNN's LGBT town hall last night, the left's belief in transgenderism is no joke. These ads accurately depict the sort of environment kids will grow up in if conservatives cede ground to leftists on this issue.", "description": ".10/11/2019 20:12:15PM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/170/b6df436f-e3c0-4ccf-991e-ecd737fed2b0.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
