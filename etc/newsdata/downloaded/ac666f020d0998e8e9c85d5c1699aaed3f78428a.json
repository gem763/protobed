This is Money podcast", "language": "en", "text": "It\u2019s been more than a month since Britain\u2019s most high profile fund manager Neil Woodford was embarrassingly forced to close the doors to his flagship fund.\n\nSince then, investors have been unable to sell out and this week - after the first 28 days of closure rolled round - Woodford Equity Income locked savers in for another four weeks.\n\nOver the past month, Woodford, his business, its associates and the entire fund management industry have been thrown under the spotlight, but ultimately, will all this fuss and fiasco make any difference?\n\nOn this week\u2019s podcast, Simon Lambert, Georgie Frost and Alex Sebastian look at what next for the investment world, what has changed and whether once the noise dies down it will simply be back to business as usual.\n\nCan we learn anything from the Woodford mess?\n\nAre there other investments we should be looking at?\n\nIs this just another reason to ditch active management for passive funds?\n\nWill we still continue to love our star managers?\n\nAll this and more comes under the microscope, as the team look to Woodford and beyond and consider the business of making money from making other people\u2019s money.", "description": "Neil Woodford, his business, its associates and the fund management industry have been thrown under the spotlight, but ultimately, will all this fuss and fiasco make any difference?", "authors": ["This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
