WeWork had planned to hold a roadshow to promote the offering as soon as this week, an executive told analysts on Wednesday.\n\nThe Financial Times reported on SoftBank\u2019s position earlier Monday. Representatives for SoftBank and We Co., the parent of WeWork, declined to comment.\n\nIn the span of a few months, WeWork has gone from one of America\u2019s most valuable unicorn startups to a punchline in investment circles. Early this year, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. pitched WeWork as a $65 billion business. Now WeWork advisers are estimating the company is worth about a third of that amount.\n\nSoftBank Stake\n\nSoftBank Group Corp. and its affiliates hold about 29% of WeWork stock, Bloomberg reported last week. That\u2019s even more than co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Adam Neumann, though he maintains effective voting control through a three-class share structure.\n\nA low valuation would hit SoftBank Group especially hard. Unlike its affiliate the Vision Fund, which invested just once at about a $20 billion valuation in early 2017, SoftBank Group kept pouring money into WeWork, most recently in January at a $47 billion valuation. Overall, SoftBank has invested $10.65 billion into the New York-based company, which owns or leases office space and then rents it to companies\u2019 needing short-term space.\n\nNeumann has been the subject of scrutiny from investors over disclosures in WeWork\u2019s IPO paperwork. The company paid Neumann rent and spent $5.9 million to acquire a trademark he owned, as it lent him money. In recent months, WeWork has sought to address some of its governance issues, including by adding a woman to its board.\n\nCredit Requirement\n\nWeWork has lined up a $6 billion credit line that is contingent on it raising at least $3 billion in an IPO, according to its prospectus.\n\nThe company is already considering additional financing. WeWork is planning to rely on junk bonds for funding for the foreseeable future, a company executive said in a meeting with analysts, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nThe executive said WeWork could also explore whole-business securitizations, or the practice of pledging royalties, fees, intellectual property and other key assets as collateral, the person said. Those types of bonds are becoming more popular. They may enable companies with riskier ratings to improve their credit by cutting financing costs and issuing higher-quality bonds.\n\n(Updates with SoftBank risk in sixth paragraph.)\n\n--With assistance from Ed Hammond and Gillian Tan.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Sarah McBride in San Francisco at smcbride24@bloomberg.net;Ellen Huet in San Francisco at ehuet4@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Mark Milian at mmilian@bloomberg.net, ;Liana Baker at lbaker75@bloomberg.net, Michael Hytha, Anne VanderMey\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Executives of WeWork and its largest investor, SoftBank, are discussing whether to shelve plans for an initial public offering of the money-losing co-working company, said people with knowledge of the talks.SoftBank is pressing WeWork to postpone the stock offering after investors expressed", "authors": ["Sarah Mcbride", "Ellen Huet"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/oU5RpDwAQD4HBbNYmXsBvw--~B/aD0xNDY3O3c9MjIwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/6e9f81003817d53414ec716671cfa64d", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
