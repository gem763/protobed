(KAZUHIRO NOGI/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nSwimmer Conor Dwyer, a two-time Olympic gold medalist, was issued a 20-month ban for testing positive for an anabolic agent, according to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency. The suspension prematurely ended his hopes for a third Olympic appearance and prompted the decorated swimmer to announce his retirement.\n\nUSADA said in a statement Friday that Dwyer, 30, tested positive in three out-of-competition tests in 2018, and a three-member panel of the American Arbitration Association \u201cfound that Dwyer had testosterone pellets inserted in his body.\u201d\n\nDwyer was a part of the United States 4x200 relay teams that won gold at the 2012 London Games and again four years later at the Rio Olympics. He also won an individual bronze at the 2016 Games in the 200-meter freestyle race. He\u2019d qualified for this year\u2019s world championships, which took place in July, but was removed from the U.S. roster with no explanation and did not compete in Gwangju, South Korea.\n\nAccording to the arbitration panel\u2019s ruling, Dwyer did not dispute that he had the pellets surgically implanted. According to the panel's final ruling, Dwyer returned home from the Rio Olympics three years ago and \u201cfor many months, he had been suffering from health issues such as brain fog, low mental and physical energy, difficulty sleeping, depression and anxiety.\u201d\n\nHe eventually underwent a hormone replacement therapy and had the pellets surgically implanted in October 2018. The panel wrote that \u201che was not concerned with his swimming performance, but rather his overall mental health and well-being.\"\n\nDwyer didn't realize at the time that the procedure violated anti-doping policies and would result in a positive test, according to the panel\u2019s findings.\n\nShortly after USADA issued its statement Friday afternoon, Dwyer on Instagram announced his retirement from the sport. He did not directly address the panel\u2019s findings.\n\n\u201cIt has been an incredible ride and I have accomplished more than my wildest dreams,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt was an honor to represent my country alongside my teammates. \u2026 This is an unfortunate end to an incredible chapter of my life. I believe that things happen for a reason, and I can\u2019t wait to share with you all the next chapter of my life.\u201d\n\nDwyer\u2019s 20-month ban is retroactive to December 2018, which means he wouldn\u2019t be able to return to the competition until after the Tokyo Games.\n\n\u201cAs noted in the Panel\u2019s decision, USADA is independent of sport and here to help athletes ensure they compete clean and protect their health and well-being within the rules,\u201d Travis Tygart, USADA\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating that Mr. Dwyer did not take advantage of this support and hopefully this case will convince others to do so in order to protect fair and healthy competition for all athletes.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nRussians take gold and silver in men\u2019s all-around, illustrating U.S. gymnastics gap\n\nNoah Lyles, with two world track championship gold medals, returns home\n\nAmerican Simone Biles wins fifth all-around world gymnastics title", "description": "Dwyer, who won gold as a member of the U.S. 4x200 relay team in both London and Rio, announced his retirement Friday afternoon.", "authors": ["Rick Maese", "Reporter Covering A Variety Of Subjects", "Including Health", "Safety", "Olympics", "Legal", "Political Issues In Sports", "October At Pm", "Rick Maese Is A Sports Features Writer For The Washington Post.
