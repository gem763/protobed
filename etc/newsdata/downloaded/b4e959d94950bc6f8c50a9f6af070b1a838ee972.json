But why do that when you can brazenly enjoy it right in front of them because they believe that piece of chocolatey goodness is actually really gross?\n\nRather than go through all the explanations about why you are allowed to have this treat while they are deprived, just make them think they don\u2019t want it anyway. By lying about how it tastes.\n\nIt\u2019s spicy\n\n\u201cOh, sorry, this is pretty spicy,\u201d is a favourite lie among the parents in our Offspring Facebook Group. There are a LOT of you out there telling your kids that your favourite ice cream or candy bar is spicy (and we applaud you for it). If your kid doesn\u2019t know what \u201cspicy\u201d means yet, find a way to introduce a little spiciness now so that you can use the excuse later. Many kids find mint to be \u201cspicy,\u201d so that might be a good place to start.\n\nIt has alcohol in it\n\nLook, kid, I don\u2019t make the laws. This milkshake is spiked with alcohol and I\u2019m not allowed to share it with you. You can\u2019t have this until you\u2019re a grown up.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want your kids to think you\u2019re drinking booze all the time, though, you could also go the \u201ccaffeinated\u201d route, like Mitzy, who says, \u201cIf I get a fancy sweet drink at a coffee shop, I\u2019ll tell them there\u2019s too much caffeine in it for their little bodies. It\u2019ll make them stop growing.\u201d\n\nThe added threat of stunted growth really polishes that trick off nicely.\n\nIt tastes like coffee\n\nIf the thought of caffeine doesn\u2019t scare them enough, just tell them it tastes like coffee. Let them try a sip of (cooled off) black coffee sometime or a coffee-flavored treat. They\u2019re probably not going to like it and you\u2019ve got the perfect trick for the next few years. (If they do like it and now they ask for coffee all the time, whoops, sorry, it was worth a shot.)\n\nIt\u2019s too hot\n\nIf your child is sensitive to temperature, make a big show of blowing on that hot chocolate. \u201cIt\u2019s still really hot; you could burn your tongue,\u201d you can say, over and over until you\u2019ve drained the cup entirely.\n\nIt\u2019s licorice-flavored\n\nThis one wouldn\u2019t work on my own son because despite his natural pickiness, the kid strangely LOVES licorice flavour. But I have to imagine that most of your kids don\u2019t (black jelly beans are an abomination and should be banned). The licorice lie will work extra well with dark chocolate, thanks to its rich colour.\n\nIt kind of tastes like...\n\n... whatever flavour they hate the most. Hm, this kind of tastes like broccoli. Or lima beans. Or tuna fish. Or feta cheese. You know what flavours will most make your kids recoil\u2014that\u2019s what your next treat should taste like.", "description": "Sure, you could sneak around, hiding your favourite treats in the box of the blandest cereal in your pantry, devouring them in secret once the kids are safely in bed for the night.
