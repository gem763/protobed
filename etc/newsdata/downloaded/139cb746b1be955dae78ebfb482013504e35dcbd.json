(The SDF\u2019s commander has suggested this was an understatement, stating that the raid was the result of five months of intelligence cooperation between his militia and the Americans.)\n\nEven though Russian and Turkish forces, who place much less of a priority on combatting the Islamic State than the United States and its allies, have rushed into the void left by American troops in northeastern Syria, Trump observed that the United States had cooperated with Russia in advance to allow American Special Forces to fly over \u201cRussia-held areas\u201d on their way to Baghdadi without having to inform Moscow of the precise nature of the mission, and with Turkey, which \u201cknew we were going in,\u201d so that its forces didn\u2019t \u201cstart shooting\u201d in the midst of the operation.\n\nThe Donald Trump who addressed the nation today was a supremely confident commander in chief, not the president besieged by impeachment proceedings one might have expected. He boasted of how he\u2019d predicted the 9/11 attacks and disastrous Iraq War, and reveled in divulging the gory details of the raid.\n\n\u201cWe are out\u201d of the business of keeping the peace between dueling factions in Syria and Turkey, Trump crowed, going so far as to declare that exposing his Kurdish partners to slaughter for several days made it \u201cmuch easier\u201d to deal with them and that he was glad to help the Turks carve out a \u201csafe zone\u201d by attacking and forcibly removing Kurdish elements from northern Syria. \u201cI want our soldiers home.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are 8,000 miles away\u201d from Syria, Trump continued, tellingly exaggerating the distance. \u201cRussia is right there, Turkey is right there. Syria is there \u2026 Iran is right there. Iraq is right there. They all hate ISIS.\u201d He also called out European nations as a \u201ctremendous disappointment\u201d for their unwillingness to take in ISIS prisoners from their countries. \u201cThey can walk back [to Europe]. They can\u2019t walk to our country. We have lots of water in between our country and them.\u201d", "description": "With the killing of the leader of ISIS, the president made the case for his transactional, tactical style of foreign policy.", "authors": ["Uri Friedman"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/RTS2T2Y6/facebook.jpg?1572199546", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
