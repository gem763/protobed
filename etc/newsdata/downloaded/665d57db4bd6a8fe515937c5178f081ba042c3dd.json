In an ideal world, we\u2019d all use reusable nappies and the good news is that advancements in washing machine technology make this easier than ever before.\n\nThere\u2019s no need to spend time presoaking or using expensive cleaning agents: you simply chuck your used nappy in a nappy bucket or laundry bag and, once it\u2019s full, pop them on a hot wash (a long 60C cycle is best to ensure all bacteria is banished) with regular non-bio washing powder.\n\nYour washing pattern will, of course, depend on how many nappies you buy and your baby\u2019s routine: most parents find that changing a nappy every three to four hours is sufficient, just like you would with a disposable.\n\nThis means you\u2019ll probably get through between six and eight a day (although very young babies might need closer to 10 nappy changes). Because of this, we\u2019d recommend investing in around 20 nappies, which allow you to run a wash every other day and have a few spare while they\u2019re hanging on the line.\n\nThere\u2019s a variety of options when it comes to reusables: hassle free all-in-one designs are a good place to get started, while two-in-one nappies allow you to layer additional booster pads (these are made of materials such as fleece, bamboo or hemp) on top of the inner layer to maximise the absorbency of your nappy.\n\n\u201cEven switching to one to two reusable nappies a day makes a difference,\u201d explains Szpotowicz. So if you\u2019re not able to go reusable full time, it could be worth also looking into eco-friendly disposables.\n\nThe eco-friendly disposables we\u2019ve featured have undergone testing to show their nappies can start decomposing much quicker than regular disposables (for example, with parts decomposing significantly in under 10 years, compared to the hundreds of years a regular one might). However, it is worth noting that some experts believe that this isn\u2019t always replicated in landfill conditions, which are extremely crowded and lack oxygen.\n\nDespite this, unlike traditional nappies, eco-friendly ones are made with sustainable principles in mind \u2013 such as the way they source their materials, avoidance of certain chemicals (such as chlorine) and their commitment to helping the environment.\n\nBut when it comes to cost, which option works out cheaper? Well, there\u2019s no denying that there\u2019s a higher upfront cost when it comes to reusables: you\u2019ll need to spend between \u00a3200 and \u00a3300 up front to get a bundle of reusable nappies.\n\nOnce you do, they\u2019ll likely take you up to when your little one starts potty training. There\u2019s also dedicated buying and selling reusable nappy groups to help you snap them up second hand and many councils offer an incentive scheme by providing a voucher towards your first purchase (see if you\u2019re eligible here). What\u2019s more, experts estimate it costs around \u00a3800 to keep a baby in disposable nappies for the first two years of their life and for every pound spent on them, it costs taxpayers 10p to dispose of them.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

Working out at just \u00a39 per reusable nappy, these pocket nappies are extra lightweight \u2013 ideal if you don\u2019t love the bulk some reusables can create under clothing. Although it\u2019s recommended to use the provided boosters, we actually got several hours\u2019 wear out of the nappy\u2019s thin micro-fleece layer alone. But the beauty of this nappy is that it\u2019s easy to customise too. Each nappy comes with two bamboo boosters to use, so you can tailor things to your needs and use both if your baby is a heavy wetter. A simple but incredibly useful pocket nappy that is a great place to start your reusable journey.\n\nBuy now\n\nMama Bamboo biodegradable nappies: from \u00a310, Mama Bamboo\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to combine reusables with disposables, Mama Bamboo offers a biodegradable bamboo nappy. Unlike regular nappies, Mama Bamboo claims these decompose much quicker (with at least 60 per cent of the nappy being decomposed in less than three months) and are made from sustainably sourced wood pulp and bamboo. The result is an incredibly soft nappy that felt silky smooth as we wrapped it around our little one! Not only is the bamboo extra comfortable but it was also the most absorbent of the eco-friendly disposables that we tried.\n\nBuy now\n\nBambooty easy dry nappy: from \u00a310.99, Bambooty\u200b\n\nThis easy dry nappy well and truly lived up to its name! Available in several different print options, this all-in-one option comes in its matching wet bag making it easy to take out and about. One thing we really liked about this nappy is that its inner layer actually has two flaps (made of bamboo and organic cotton) that fold over each other \u2013 meaning it\u2019s really absorbent without having to add your own booster, which can sometimes make nappies feel bulky. Despite the double layer, it was actually quite lightweight and one of the quickest to dry too. A great all-rounder.\n\nBuy now\n\nBambino Mio Miosolo all-in-one reusable nappy: \u00a315.99, Bambino Mio\u200b\n\nAnother all-in-one option is Bambino Mio, a popular UK brand known for its funky prints and super easy-to-use nappies. The 100 per cent polyester inner works with a tab system, meaning you can simply pop the core out of the nappy for efficient washing and then slip it back in when they\u2019re ready to use. There\u2019s also the option of using their disposable liners range, which especially come in handy when catching and disposing of a poonami. Bambino Mio offers particularly impressive absorbency (lasting around five hours without additional boosters) and this one-size nappy can be used right up to potty training. The only drawback is that we found it took a little bit more time to get a perfect fit with the velcro waistline.\n\nBuy now\n\nMum and You eco-nappies trial pack: \u00a32.50, Mum and You\n\nThis trial pack is a great way of seeing if eco-friendly nappies could work for you. Mum and You\u2019s nappies are made from sustainable wood pulp with the plastic-free packaging being made from renewable sugar cane. With a cute kitten design, these nappies feel almost paper-thin and while they didn\u2019t last as long as some in our round-up, they still do a decent job staying dry. We\u2019d also recommend the brand\u2019s plastic-free wipes, which fully decompose within four to six weeks in landfill conditions and can be used for home composting.\n\nBuy now\n\nLittle Lamb organic cotton nappy: \u00a312.50, Little Lamb\n\nFor babies with particularly sensitive skin, these organic cotton nappies, designed to be combined with nappy wraps, are a godsend. Made from organic materials (which are certified by GOTS), they use 90 per cent organic cotton \u2013 resulting in a thick, plush nappy that is gorgeously snugly on your little one\u2019s bottom. The simple velcro design means these ones aren\u2019t one-fit (size one goes up to 9kg, size two should take you up to potty training and size three can be used from 16kg onwards) so you will need to repurchase when your baby grows older. These truly are one of the softest nappies we tried and are a great option for overnight or heavy wetters. However, it\u2019s also worth bearing in mind the thickness of the material can make it a little bulky and thick \u2013 so perhaps they\u2019re more suitable for winter nights than summer ones.\n\nBuy now\n\nClose Nappies pop-in-newborn single printed nappy: \u00a310.99, Close Nappies\n\nIn collaboration with baby charity Bliss and Babipur (\u00a33 of each purchase goes directly to the charity), this superhero print nappy is specifically designed for premature and/or tiny babies and can be used from birth. Because of this, there are a few special features you won\u2019t find on other reusables. Its front section, for example, is designed so it sits below the umbilical cord. A great thing about this nappy is how easy it is wash: the outside wipes clean so you can just wash the terry soaker (which detaches by poppers) and replace \u2013 meaning it\u2019s great if you need something that dries in a hurry! Because it dries so quickly it\u2019s worth mentioning that it is less absorbent than most (which is understandable, given it\u2019s designed for newborns who will have more frequent nappy changes). However, if you\u2019re lucky enough to have a newborn that sleeps through the night, you can get around this problem by teaming it with their handy pop-in night-time nappy booster, which is made of bamboo and fleece.\n\nBuy now\n\nKit and Kin eco nappies: \u00a38, Kit and Kin\n\nAnother eco-friendly disposable with impressive credentials. Kit and Kin\u2019s hypoallergenic nappies might not be reusable but they do their bit to help the planet. Both the packaging and nappies are made from an oxo-biodegradable material, meaning they could biodegrade within six years. Not only is the brand\u2019s subscription model (receive four packets a month direct to your door) hassle-free but for every 10 purchased, it funds the purchase of one acre of tropical rainforest. We loved the cute animal print design on the bottom of the nappies, making these perfect for tummy-time snaps, and they held up well on the absorbency test. Unlike most reusables, this one doesn\u2019t have a wetness indicator, making it a bit trickier to figure out if a change is due.\n\nBuy now\n\nBamboozle stretch waddle: from \u00a312.99, Babipur\n\nThe Bamboozle is specially designed to work as a night-time reusable and has won best reusable nappy five years on the trot in the Mother and Baby awards. It\u2019s designed to be used as a two-part system with one of their waterproof nappy wraps, and while it is super absorbent by itself, many parents choose to team it with an additional booster if their baby is a particularly heavy wetter and sleeps long stretches. It was certainly heavy by the time morning came around but we can confirm there were no leaks with this one at all when used throughout the night. The only slight downside is that because it\u2019s so absorbent, it seemed to take forever to dry \u2013 so you\u2019ll need a few in your stash while waiting for the washing line to do its thing.\n\nBuy now\n\nBaba+Boo one size reusable pocket nappy: \u00a314.95, Baba+Boo\n\nAfter giving up work to be a stay-at-home parent, the founder of Baba+Boo decided to turn her passion for cloth nappies into a business. Its one-size reusable nappy is easy to use and, unlike many reusable nappies, relies on an array of carefully located poppers rather than velcro (which can sometimes fray). The result is that you can use it any time from when your little one weighs around 8lbs, right up to potty training. We loved the vibrant, bright design of this one and its popper placements allow you to find the perfect fit. The fleecy inner-liner is lovely and soft but we found we needed to use a booster if using it for more than a few hours at a time. Another great thing about this nappy is that it also dries extremely quickly.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Reusable and eco-friendly nappies\n\nWe especially loved Little Lamb\u2019s slimline all-in-one pocket nappy, which couldn\u2019t be easier for starting your nappy journey. If you\u2019re looking for an overnight nappy, Babipur\u2019s Bamboozle nappy is definitely a good choice. While reusables are more eco-friendly, Mama Bamboo\u2019s sustainably made disposables are still a great alternative to traditional nappies.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
