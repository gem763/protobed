Eight brokers will handle transactions, he said.\n\nForeign companies and banks have expressed interest but are waiting to see how trading goes, he said.\n\nThe futures were schedule to start trading last July, then in January, but were delayed as it took time for the exchange to negotiate with participants and authorities, he said.\n\nTOCOM reported a fourth straight year of losses for the 2018/19 financial year. Hamada has said he was hopeful that the new products will help make it profitable this year.\n\nTOCOM's trading volume stood at 23.6 million contracts in 2018, or just over a quarter of the record 87 million contracts traded in 2003.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n($1 = 107.9500 yen)\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Yuka Obayashi and Aaron Sheldrick; editing by Jason Neely)", "description": "The Tokyo Commodities Exchange will start trading Japan's first electricity futures on Sept. 17 after delays, a move that may boost competition in Japan's roughly $130 billion power sector after liberalisation.
