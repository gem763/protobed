To close out the month, I\u2019d like to highlight some tips from readers about how to transition from casual rider to cycling enthusiast.\n\nScruffy has a tip for buying a good used bike:\n\nGetting a used bike can present a great deal, since bicycle tech hasn\u2019t changed much in the past 20 years. However, if you don\u2019t know much about bikes, find someone who does and can go shopping with you to make sure the bike works well and fits you well.\n\nmostlyempath suggests classes:\n\nIf you\u2019re concerned about cycling in an urban environment, my local bicycle association had classes on \u201cbiking in the city\u201d. Check your local area to see if there\u2019s someone offering a class. I found it to be immensely valuable when I was getting started and it helped me be more confident on the road.\n\nAntifaz recommends an upgrade:\n\nBike shoes help! Who knew? I never did, but now I do. Even casual ones will make a big difference (I\u2019d only recommend the casual ones for city).\n\nBike shoes are, of course, those shoes that lock into the clipless pedals that you install on your bike to match. (If you\u2019ve done an indoor cycling class and were handed a pair of special shoes, you\u2019ve used these.)\n\nNot ready for the special shoes? You can get a pair of clips for a few bucks, and attach those to your regular pedals. Both options help to hold your feet on the pedals so you can push more efficiently.\n\nOther upgrades recommended by readers: Good headlights and taillights, making sure your bike is properly fitted to you (your bike shop can help if you\u2019re clueless), and a bell so you can be heard at a distance. In the personal care department, Bloomtownrat recommends some antibacterial lubricant:", "description": "I hope you enjoyed our month of cycling this September, where we hopped on our bikes, ventured outdoors (perhaps) and took a look at some training plans to build fitness specifically for longer and faster rides.
