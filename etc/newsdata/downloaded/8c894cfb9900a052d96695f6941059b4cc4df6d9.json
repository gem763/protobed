(AMELIA KUNHARDT/AP)\n\nAnne Rivers Siddons, whose best-selling novels such as \u201cPeachtree Road,\u201d \u201cOuter Banks\u201d and \u201cLow Country\u201d often portrayed the lives of women coming to terms with the social mores of the South, died Sept. 11 at her home in Charleston, S.C. She was 83.\n\nThe cause was lung cancer, said a stepson, David Siddons.\n\nMs. Siddons did not publish her first novel, the autobiographical \u201cHeartbreak Hotel,\u201d until she was 40. She went on to write 19 novels, developing a loyal readership and a reputation for creating spirited characters who defied social expectations to find their way in the world.\n\nHer breakthrough novel was \u201cPeachtree Road,\u201d a 1988 bestseller that chronicled the changing fortunes of an Atlanta family \u2014 and the city itself \u2014 from the 1940s to the 1980s.\n\n\u201c \u2018Peachtree Road\u2019 is a huge, sprawling novel,\u201d novelist Ellen Feldman wrote in The Washington Post. \u201cIt is also a carefully wrought one that somehow manages to retain the grace and delicacy of the world it mourns. Most important, it is a compulsively readable book. Siddons is a born teller of tales.\u201d\n\nInevitably, Ms. Siddons drew comparisons with an earlier Atlanta novelist, Margaret Mitchell, the author of \u201cGone With the Wind.\u201d If she did not write about the Civil War in her novels, Ms. Siddons did address the civil rights movement, racial misunderstanding, the modernization of the South and, for better or worse, the loss of the region\u2019s traditions.\n\n\n\nSiddons\u2019s books sold by the millions. (AMELIA KUNHARDT/AP)\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way not to love the South,\u201d she told the Associated Press in 1992. \u201cIt\u2019s such a rich place. I\u2019m the seventh generation of my family to be born in the same little town. So it\u2019s who I am. But you\u2019d have to be a fool not to see what\u2019s hurtful about it.\u201d\n\nSome of her novels were set in other places \u2014 \u201cHill Towns\u201d takes place in Italy, \u201cColony\u201d and \u201cUp Island\u201d in New England \u2014 but the central characters were almost always Southern women caught between the present and the past.\n\nIn \u201cHeartbreak Hotel\u201d (1976), Ms. Siddons drew on her experiences as a student in the 1950s, when she wrote an editorial calling for an end to segregation at her college, Auburn University in Alabama. It appeared with a disclaimer from university officials that they did not approve of such a move. When Ms. Siddons wrote another column calling for integration, she was dismissed from her job as editor of the student newspaper.\n\n\u201cI was really aware of the disapproval on campus,\u201d she said in 2000, \u201cand I got the first taste of how it might feel to espouse a cause that was not everybody else\u2019s.\u201d\n\nThe central female character of \u201cHeartbreak Hotel\u201d goes through a similar experience, then goes off with a reporter covering the civil rights movement, spurning the fraternity boy she was expected to marry. The book was made into a 1989 movie, \u201cHeart of Dixie,\u201d starring Ally Sheedy.\n\nIn another autobiographical novel, \u201cDowntown\u201d (1994), Ms. Siddons drew on her experience as a magazine journalist in Atlanta who gets caught up in social change during the 1960s, when \u201cpromises . . . hung in the bronze air like fruit on the eve of ripeness.\u201d\n\nMany of her novels focused on women who grow older with varying degrees of gracefulness, as they balance independence, love and friendship in their lives. In \u201cFault Lines\u201d (1995), an Atlanta homemaker flees her emotionally barren husband for a new life, and a new lover, in California.\n\nMs. Siddons\u2019s lush prose was sometimes criticized veering over the top in \u201cFault Lines,\u201d as in this description of an outdoor tryst with a bearded man in a lumberjack shirt: \u201cLast night\u2019s dizzy plummet into heat and red darkness took me again, and I lost myself again.\u201d\n\nMs. Siddons lamented, \u201cI will never be considered anything but a regional writer by the New York Times,\u201d but her legions of readers did not care. Her books sold by the millions, and in the early 1990s, she signed two contracts that paid her more than $16 million for seven novels.\n\nShe spent summers in Maine for more than 40 years and moved from Atlanta to Charleston in 1998, but in many ways Ms. Siddons\u2019s imagination remained rooted in her native Georgia.\n\nOne of her best-received novels, \u201cNora, Nora\u201d (2000), was the story of a small-town girl who flourishes under the tutelage of a sophisticated, iconoclastic female teacher \u2014 the Nora of the book\u2019s title \u2014 who arrives in \u201cthe town and the school like a comet, trailing delight and outrage in equal parts in her wake.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis lively, sparkling coming-of-age novel is superbly written and wholly engaging,\u201d novelist Greg Johnson wrote in the Atlanta Journal Constitution. \u201cIt is also a wise and humane book that seems destined to broaden this charismatic author\u2019s large and loyal readership.\u201d\n\nSybil Anne Rivers was born Jan. 9, 1936, in Atlanta and grew up about 20 miles away in the town of Fairburn, Ga. Her father was a lawyer, her mother a school secretary.\n\nGroomed to be a Southern belle, Ms. Siddons was a cheerleader and homecoming queen in high school and joined the Delta Delta Delta sorority at Auburn. But instead of getting married after she graduated in 1958, she moved to Atlanta to work in advertising.\n\nIn 1963, she became an editor and writer for Atlanta magazine, as the city was emerging as the center of the New South. Her first book, published in 1975, was a collection of humorous essays and articles. She then gave up journalism to concentrate on writing fiction.\n\nHer husband of 48 years, businessman Heyward Siddons, died in 2014. Survivors include four stepsons and three grandchildren.\n\nMs. Siddons\u2019s final novel, \u201cThe Girls of August,\u201d about four female friends who return each summer to the same beach house, appeared in 2014.\n\n\u201cThe South is hard on women, partly because of the emphasis put on looks and charm,\u201d Ms. Siddons told People magazine in 1991. \u201cNo matter what I did, I always ended up with this hollow feeling. It finally hit me that that\u2019s why I write: I am writing about the journey we all take to find out what lives in that hole.\u201d", "description": "In 19 novels, she portrayed the longings and struggles of women in a changing South.", "authors": ["Matt Schudel", "Obituary Writer", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/v7BAEFZecH79Ql2GDTCtJkowDRQ=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RUNWIOWVPII6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
