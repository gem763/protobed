The show did take home the award for Best Drama Series, and Peter Dinklage won the award for Best Supporting Actor in a Drama for his role as Tyrion Lannister. Those two wins at tonight\u2019s telecast, combined with the 10 awards the show won at the Creative Arts Emmys last week, means Game of Thrones ties its previous record for most wins for a single season of television. The show previously won 12 awards for its fifth season in 2015, setting a new record.\n\nThe lack of awards may not be too surprising for fans considering the response to the show\u2019s eighth and final season received. Many critics were largely underwhelmed, and a portion of fans were disappointed. Still, welcoming the cast on stage and standing for the actors involved in HBO\u2019s popular series was a heartwarming display of support and celebration for the series.\n\nStill, it was a great night overall for HBO. The network saw awards for some of its most popular shows on top of Game of Thrones; Barry and Succession took home some top category prizes, including Bill Hader\u2019s win for Best Actor in a Comedy Series for his work in Barry. Jesse Armstrong took home Emmy gold for his writing on Succession, one of HBO\u2019s most recent popular series.\n\nAmazon also touted a super night, leading the number of wins for a streaming service. The company won a number of awards for darling shows like The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, and newcomer series for Amazon Prime Video (through a partnership with BBC), Fleabag. Fleabag won a number of awards, including for Best Comedy and Best Actress in a Comedy for Phoebe Waller-Bridge. The actress also received an award for her writing on the show\u2019s pilot. Netflix didn\u2019t have an amazing night compared to previous years, but it still managed to bring home some trophies for shows When They See Us and Ozark.\n\nThe full list of Emmy winners can be read below.
