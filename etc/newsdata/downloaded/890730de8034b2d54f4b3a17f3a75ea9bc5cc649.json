But as he prepares to hand over this portfolio to lead efforts on a \"European Green Deal\" in the incoming Commission, Timmermans said after a ministers' meeting discussing the Hungarian and Polish situations that the work he started would continue.\n\n\"I can say very clearly that all those who believe that this is sort of the end of the era because I'm going to hand over my portfolio to other colleagues in the Commission, and they believe that this puts an end to this debate, are absolutely wrong,\" Timmermans told reporters Monday after a meeting of the General Affairs Council (ministers held a closed-door hearing on Hungary as part of the Council meeting).\n\nSome politicians in the bloc's eastern states believe \u2014 and hope \u2014 that rule of law concerns will take a backseat under Ursula von der Leyen's leadership. But Timmermans rejected this notion.\n\n\"It is very clear that also President-elect [Ursula] von der Leyen, when she addressed the European Parliament, [she was] crystal clear about the fact that also the von der Leyen Commission will continue with pursuing the respect for the rule of law by all member states,\" he said.\n\n\"So yes, you will see other commissioners standing here, less facial hair but the same commitment, the same determination, and the same pursuit of what we believe is an essential element of European cooperation.\"\n\nThe EU has struggled to address concerns about the rule of law, and the Council meeting on Monday did not make any conclusions on the substance of the Hungarian government's defense of its policies.\n\nTen members states, in addition to Hungary and the Commission, spoke at the hearing, according to one diplomat, who said that \"Hungary was very well-prepared.\" Another diplomat described the mood in the room as \"concerned.\"\n\nHungarian Justice Minister Judit Varga told Hungarian media that the hearing was part of a \"political attack.\"\n\nThe \"attacks\" on Hungary began in 2015 when the country said no to migration, the minister said, adding that the \"pro-migration liberal elite\" repeats baseless accusations against Hungary, which are echoed in \"the liberal, especially Western European media.\"\n\nThe European Parliament started formally examining the state of the rule of law in Hungary in 2012, and voted last year to trigger the so-called Article 7 disciplinary procedure over concerns about judicial independence, corruption, freedom of expression and more.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of Germany and France during the hearing, French Secretary of State for European Affairs Am\u00e9lie de Montchalin said that the \"general picture painted by the European Parliament's report about the respect for fundamental values in Hungary is worrying,\" according to officials.\n\n\"It is up to Hungary to demonstrate that some of the cases mentioned in the European Parliament's report have indeed been closed,\" she said.", "description": "Commission vice president says when he takes on a new job, it won\u2019t be the end of an era.", "authors": ["Lili Bayer", "Ma\u00efa De La Baume"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1141639653-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
