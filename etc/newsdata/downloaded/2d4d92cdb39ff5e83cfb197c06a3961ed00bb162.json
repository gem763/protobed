We have 14 months.", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-07-26", "text": "Scientific reality makes clear that the only plausible way to preserve a livable climate \u2014 and hence modern civilization \u2014 starts with aggressive national and global cuts in carbon pollution by 2030.\n\nBut political reality makes clear that such cuts can\u2019t happen instantly \u2014 and that global action requires leadership from the United States. After all, the U.S. is the richest country in the world and the biggest cumulative source of heat-trapping emissions over the past century.\n\nWith eight years of a pro-science president, Barack Obama, the nation made steady progress on reducing emissions and committing to future reductions, enabling a global climate deal in Paris in 2015. But with just two and a half years of an anti-science administration, national and global progress have both stalled under President Donald Trump, who has begun to abandon the Paris Accord and undermine action here and abroad.\n\nThat means November 3, 2020 \u2014 the U.S. presidential election \u2014 is the deadline for Americans who do not want to destroy the health and well-being of current generations, their children, and future generations. If Trump is reelected, the prospects for the necessary national and global cuts in carbon pollution by 2030 will be gone.\n\nWhy are deep cuts by 2030 so important?\n\nBack in October 2018, the nations around the world unanimously approved a landmark report from scientists warning that we must make rapid reductions in global carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 in order to have any plausible chance of averting catastrophic climate change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat report \u2014 published by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) \u2014 led to headlines like \u201cWe have 12 years to limit climate change catastrophe, warns UN\u201d by The Guardian, and \u201cThe world has just over a decade to get climate change under control, U.N. scientists say\u201d from the Washington Post.\n\nBut when freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) made the exact same point this January \u2014 that U.S. millennials fear \u201cthe world is going to end in 12 years if we don\u2019t address climate change\u201d \u2014 the right-wing and even some in the media pounced.\n\nSo, ThinkProgress contacted leading experts on exactly what the science says. They confirmed that, yes, as Ocasio-Cortez said, the world must act fast if we are to maintain any plausible hope of avoiding the catastrophic impacts that come with warming of 2 degrees Celsius or more above pre-industrial temperatures.\n\nFor instance, climatologist Michael Mann told ThinkProgress via email in January, \u201cProjected impacts look especially bad beyond 2\u00b0C or so of planetary warming.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd there is no scenario for stabilizing warming below 2\u00b0C that doesn\u2019t require rapid reductions in carbon emissions over the next decade,\u201d Mann added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe IPCC report noted, for instance, that \u201cLimiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C rather than 2\u00b0C is projected to prevent the thawing\u201d of as much as 1 million square miles of permafrost. And that matters because the northern permafrost contains twice as much carbon as the atmosphere does today.\n\nSo, we face the very real possibility of a snowballing catastrophe \u2014 where global warming of 2 degrees or more thaws a huge area of permafrost, and the resulting carbon emissions released because of this then creates considerably more warming that in turn releases yet more heat-trapping gases from the permafrost.\n\nAndrew Jones, co-director of Climate Interactive, a U.S. think tank that generated some of the scenarios the IPCC used in its report, told ThinkProgress he \u201cdefinitely\u201d agreed with Mann\u2019s assessment. Rapid reductions means a 30-50% decrease in global emissions by 2030, rather than the 10% increase we are currently looking at.\n\nInto this discussion over rhetoric comes a new article in journal Nature Climate Change, \u201cWhy setting a climate deadline is dangerous.\u201d In it, scholars from Japan, the U.K., and Germany argue \u201ca 2030 deadline arises from political (mis)use of science in setting an artificial deadline.\u201d\n\nThe article is deeply flawed. For instance, the authors write of the IPCC\u2019s \u201cestimate of the remaining time to reach 1.5\u00b0C \u2014 a likely range of 12\u201334 years from 2018. This is where the \u201812 years\u2019 rhetoric originates.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut that\u2019s not accurate. The \u201912 years\u2019 rhetoric does not originate from the fact that we might hit 1.5 degrees Celcius in 2030. It originates from the fact that if we don\u2019t make very deep cuts by 2030, we have no possible chance of keeping below 1.5 degrees \u2014 and if we don\u2019t make deep cuts by 2030 we are going to blow past 2 degrees.\n\nAlso, the new article\u2019s concerns about deadlines are mostly hypothetical. For instance, one of the biggest problems they allege is that: \u201cA more fundamental problem with deadline-ism is that it might incite cynical, cry-wolf responses and undermine the credibility of climate science when an anticipated disaster does not happen.\u201d\n\nBut the people using the 2030 deadline aren\u2019t saying any specific disaster will happen immediately after missing such a deadline. They are saying if we don\u2019t make deep cuts by 2030, then we can\u2019t stop catastrophic climate change in the ensuing decades.\n\nThe fact is, all the major climate change impacts \u2014 like sea level rise, Dust-Bowlification, and temperature rise \u2014 are irreversible over a span of centuries if not millennia. The IPCC made that very clear in its big 2014 \u201csynthesis\u201d report. The summary of that report for policymakers, which was signed off by every major country, mentions \u201cirreversible\u201d 14 times and has extended discussions of exactly what it means and why it matters. Deadlines matter.\n\nThinkProgress asked Dr. Mann to comment on this new article about deadlines. \u201cWe should of course be as clear as possible about what we mean when we talk dangerous warming limits and pathways for limiting warming below them,\u201d he wrote in an email.\n\n\u201cBut saying there should be no targets or timelines at all is really just giving a free pass to polluters,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s a welcome message to the forces of denial and delay.\u201d And those forces currently control the highest office in the land.\n\nIf the world is to have any plausible chance of saving the climate, we need the strongest possible action by 2030, and that means we need to elect a president in 2020 who understands the urgency, and who understands that deadlines matter in the face of irreversible catastrophe.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-climate-action-urgent-Alexandria-Ocasio-Cortez.jpg?w=1024&h=685&crop=1"}
