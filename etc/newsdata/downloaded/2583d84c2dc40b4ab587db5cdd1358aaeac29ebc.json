It is the Islamic Republic of Iran that is your neighbour,\" Rouhani continued as he presented an alternative regional security pact that promotes freedom of navigation and free flow of oil and other energy resources.\n\n\"A single blunder can fuel a big fire,\" he warned.\n\nTensions between Iran and the US have escalated since President Donald Trump's decision last year to withdraw the US from the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement and reimpose crippling sanctions.\n\nHours before Rouhani's speech, the United States announced more sanctions against Iran [Drew Angerer/AFP]\n\nEU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini acknowledged struggles to preserve the pact, from which Iran has stopped strict compliance as it presses for economic benefits.\n\n\"I will not hide that it is increasingly difficult to do it,\" she told reporters after talks among European powers.\n\nIran deal 'all but dead'\n\nMehran Kamrava, of the Center for International and Regional Studies at Georgetown University in Qatar, said the nuclear deal was \"all but dead\", despite some European nations, such as France and Germany, working hard to preserve it.\n\nKamrava said Rouhani made an important point about how the landmark accord could be used as a platform for the US and Iran to talk about other larger issues - a point he noted was probably \"too subtle for Donald Trump to pick up\".\n\n\"Its fairly obvious, and in fact, the Iranians have been saying this, that the nuclear issue could be the basis for dialogue and negotiations over bigger issues the West is concerned with - for example, Iran's support for Hezbollah, the developments in Syria, Iran's tough rhetoric against Israel.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Al Jazeera's Zein Basravi, reporting from Tehran, said Iran was in \"a much stronger position\" compared with one year ago when its economy was in \"tatters\".\n\n\"What we have seen in the last 24 to 48 hours is a very different delegation from Iran,\" Basravi said.\n\n\"We have seen jovial photographs and videos of Iran's president meeting various world leaders and we have seen a much stronger representation by the Iranian president in this speech ... and it's going to be obvious to the people in Iran watching what he's saying.\"", "description": "France's efforts to arrange a meeting between Trump and Rouhani falters after US tightens punishing sanctions on Tehran.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/9/26/b338a2004ded41f888fcb6cf41239dd5_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
