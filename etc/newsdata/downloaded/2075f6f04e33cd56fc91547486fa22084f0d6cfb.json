Here's what you need to know as you start your Monday and the new work week...\n\nTrump wants to meet whistleblower, wants Schiff questioned for 'fraud and treason'\n\nPresident Trump on Sunday said he wants to meet the whistleblower who filed a complaint about his July phone call with the Ukrainian president and to have House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., questioned for \u201cfraud and treason.\u201d \u201cLike every American, I deserve to meet my accuser, especially when this accuser, the so-called \u2018Whistleblower,\u2019 represented a perfect conversation with a foreign leader in a totally inaccurate and fraudulent way,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cThen Schiff made up what I actually said by lying to Congress.\u201d\n\nTrump last week released a transcript of the call with President Volodymyr Zelensky, which along with the complaint, detailed how he asked his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. The incident has set off a formal impeachment inquiry from House Democrats. But Schiff opened Thursday\u2019s hearing on Capitol Hill with Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire with an exaggerated reading of the phone call, which he later walked back as a \u201cparody.\u201d\n\nTrump on Friday blasted Schiff for the fictional summary and demanded his immediate resignation. Appearing on ABC News\u2019 \u201cThis Week,\" Schiff said that precautions have been taken to protect the whistleblower\u2019s identity amid the criticism from Trump and his allies. The whistleblower is reportedly a member of the CIA and according to Schiff, could testify before House lawmakers soon.

The Biden campaign wrote to NBC News, CBS News, Fox News and CNN to voice \"grave concern that you continue to book Rudy Giuliani on your air to spread false, debunked conspiracy theories on behalf of Donald Trump,\" according to the Daily Beast, which first reported the existence of the letter.\n\nMeanwhile, \"Fox News Sunday\" anchor Chris Wallace reported that Giuliani was not the only attorney trying to get damaging information on Biden from Ukrainian officials, and Trump\u2019s decision to withhold aid from Ukraine this summer was made in spite of several federal agencies supporting the aid. Washington, D.C., lawyers Joe DiGenova and his wife, Victoria Toensing, worked alongside the former New York City mayor. According to a top U.S. official, the three attorneys were working \"off the books\" -- not within the Trump administration -- and only the president knows the details of their work.\n\nToensing denied the allegations in a tweet. Giuliani denied working with other attorneys in an interview with Maria Bartiromo on Sunday Morning Futures.\" Wallace responded, \"We stand by our story.\"\n\nPelosi: Democrats 'ready' to impeach Trump: 'He gave us no choice'\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi told CBS News\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d on Sunday that despite her previous hesitation to launch impeachment proceedings against President Trump, Democrats are now ready to impeach the commander-in-chief if necessary. \u201cWe could not ignore what the president did. He gave us no choice,\" she said. \"So, it wasn\u2019t any change of mind. I always said we will follow the facts where they take us, and when we see them, we will be ready. And, we are ready.\u201d\n\nUAW strike against GM enters third week\n\nAfter a weekend of talks, there is still no contract.
