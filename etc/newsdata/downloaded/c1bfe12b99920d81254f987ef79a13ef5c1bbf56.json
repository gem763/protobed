The AOFM has been issueing more notes of late. On Thursday morning it also issued $500 million of Treasury notes with an April 24, 2020 maturity and all were taken up at a yield of 0.93 per cent.\n\nUncovered treasury notes might be a new thing in Australia but it happens elsewhere.\n\nUS Treasury has been under increasing pressure to keep buyers bidding for its new bonds.\n\nA concern for the US Treasury is the decline in the bid-to-cover ratios in bond auctions since peaking in 2012.\n\nThe bid-to-cover ratio has fallen from above three times earlier this decade, to around 2.4 times currently.\n\nCiti noted that there had been a higher incidence of 'tailing' since the Fed stepped back from quantitative easing.
