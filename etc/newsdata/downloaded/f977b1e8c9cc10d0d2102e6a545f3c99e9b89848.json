Norway? I could live here forever!", "language": "en", "text": "Advertisement\n\nThe Scandinavians were the first to fall in love with Britpop \u2013 way before anyone in the UK, so, as the bass player with Britpop band Blur, I\u2019ve spent a lot of time in Nordic countries over the years.\n\nI\u2019ve had spectacular nights on the razzle-dazzle in Stockholm, Helsinki and Oslo, and the countryside \u2013 which I stumbled upon accidentally when playing at summer festivals \u2013 is like nowhere else on Earth.\n\nBut I\u2019ve never seen the Northern Lights and I love deep winter, so I went on a 12-night, no-fly cruise from Southampton to Norway.\n\nTasting the air: Alex on the deck of the Aurora, which goes from Southampton to Norway to see the Northern Lights\n\nCruising is like being on tour with a band. You turn up somewhere, take your pick of the best things on offer, then push off somewhere else.\n\nWhen we stopped in Tromso, which looked like a cool Advent calendar with all its doors open.\n\nNordic chic is where it\u2019s at right now and they really understand lighting, probably because it\u2019s dark for such long periods. The sun sets in Tromso on November 21 and it doesn\u2019t return until February.\n\nBy dinner it was snowing hard. Going somewhere that is colder than your deep freeze is not everyone\u2019s idea of fun but one thing is for certain: food never tastes quite so good as it does when you\u2019ve just been outside in a blizzard.\n\nIt\u2019s a unique cuisine and they eat local, which makes a lot of sense in the Arctic. Transport is either expensive or impossible and it\u2019s hard to grow anything in the winter months so they are big on preserved foods, many unusual.\n\nMagical display: Alex finally makes his dream come true as he watches the Northern Lights for the first time\n\nReindeer is as common as lamb in the UK \u2013 rich and livery tasting, but over the week I was served everything from the game bird ptarmigan to local parmesan. When the waiter told us the salmon was frozen, my heart sank a little before he explained that freezing is the natural way of preserving food up here and it was the best salmon I\u2019ve ever had.\n\nBut that paled next to the fermented cod. It bore about as much resemblance to fish as milk does to cheese \u2013 a different class of mouthful.\n\nIt is traditionally eaten with aquavit \u2013 pure, weapons-grade alcohol, straight off the still. And a wonderful thing an ice-cold glass of aquavit is, too, but for all that, it\u2019s the vegetables that steal the show.\n\nMaybe because they are such a precious resource, they are cooked with love and attention to detail I\u2019ve not seen anywhere else. Who thought swede could be delicious?\n\nAnd I\u2019ve never felt so hungry, perhaps because you get a lot of exercise in the Arctic.\n\nKeeping warm on the mountain outside Alta while waiting for the light show to begin\n\nEven standing outside counts. You can taste the air. It\u2019s also the world\u2019s best hangover cure, which was fortunate because I\u2019d stayed up late the night before dancing myself stupid with friends I\u2019d made in The Crow\u2019s Nest, one of the bars on board.\n\nAny kind of pampering is enhanced by extreme conditions and I took advantage of the on-board spa. The sauna had a vast window and as we travelled further north, I spent a lot of time in there watching endless pristine frozen landscapes roll by.\n\nAfter two days at sea we arrived at Alta, another modern marvel of a metropolis and it was from there that I took a trip to the top of a dark, distant mountain to get the best view of the Northern Lights, the Aurora Borealis.\n\nCandles lit the way to a wigwam with a roaring fire at its heart. Shortly after my second cup of hot chocolate the first stars began to appear.\n\nTen minutes later I was able to spot the Plough, and then the sky lit up green in a phantasmagorical display so spectacular it produced gasps and cries. The Milky Way striped the sky from horizon to horizon, the veil of night, bottomlessly profound.\n\nWhat has made the extreme north special for me is the feeling of scale it gives: the sense of being on an actual planet floating perfectly balanced in an unexplainable universe so vast and wonderful it makes you giddy.\n\nThat was the feeling I wanted and the reason I came to this great wilderness. And I\u2019m very glad I did and I will definitely come back because after asking myself \u2018Why would anyone want to live here?\u2019 on the sailing out, I got a feeling I don\u2019t get very often \u2013 that I could stay here for ever.\n\nEven in these days of a shrinking world where things are more similar wherever we go, the far north remains another world altogether.", "description": "As the bass player of Britpop band Blur, Alex James has spent a lot of time in Nordic countries - but until now he'd never seen the Northern Lights.
