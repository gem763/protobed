Kennedy High School in Richmond.\n\nWhen the West Contra Costa Unified School District in California needed money to repair and upgrade deteriorating classrooms, it hired Piper Jaffray Cos. to sell $191 million of municipal bonds.\n\nAs far as school officials knew, the March 2016 sale went off flawlessly, enabling the district to refinance older debt and tackle tasks such as removing asbestos and upgrading science labs.\n\nHowever, within a day of the initial sale, the original buyers sold, or \u201cflipped,\u201d $35 million of the district\u2019s bonds for a profit of $306,000, a Wall Street Journal analysis of trading in the bonds found.\n\nWithin 10 trading days, the post-offering trading had generated $1.24 million of market-adjusted profits. Piper Jaffray participated in some of that trading, buying back bonds and reselling them.\n\nNewly issued municipal bonds, which are marketed as long-term investments, aren\u2019t supposed to trade like that. The post-offering buying and selling suggests West Contra Costa\u2019s bonds\u2014sold in what is called a negotiated offering\u2014were initially underpriced. That means the district will pay more in interest over the life of the bonds than it would if the bonds had been priced closer to what subsequent investors paid.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s money being left on the table that costs taxpayers and rate payers and governments,\u201d said Patrick Clancy, who recently retired after 30 years as a financial adviser to local governments issuing bonds. \u201cThat\u2019s not the way it\u2019s supposed to go.\u201d\n\nMunicipal Market The Journal analyzed all trading in newly issued municipal bonds* between March 2013 and November 2017. Those bonds had a face value of: The Journal analyzed all trading in newly issued municipal bonds* between March 2013 and November 2017. Those bonds had a face value of: $1.24 trillion Big investors who bought some of those bonds sold them within one day of the offering. Those \u2018flipped\u2019 bonds had a face value of $59 billion Those quick sales generated profits of $291 million By the end of 10 days of trading, the prices of many of those bonds had risen further. Market-adjusted profits from all of the post-offering trading totaled $901 million\n\nA Journal analysis of municipal-bond data found such post-offering trading to be routine. About $60 billion, or roughly 5%, of newly issued bonds in negotiated offerings between 2013 and 2017 were sold to customers who turned around and sold them to dealers within a single day of the initial offering, usually for a profit, the Journal found.\n\nPrices on those flipped bonds were then marked up further as they were sold to longer-term investors, bringing the total market-adjusted profits to more than $900 million. The Journal\u2019s investigation found that those profiting from the flipping often include the banks hired to price and sell the bonds.\n\nPiper Jaffray, which was paid about $500,000 to act as the lead underwriter, said in a written statement that the California school-district bonds were priced \u201cfairly and successfully.\u201d It said: \u201cOur secondary market trading was a small fraction of the total trading volume.\u201d\n\nThe district\u2019s financial adviser, Blake Boehm of municipal advisory firm KNN Public Finance, briefed the school board not long after the bond sale, deeming it \u201cvery successful.\u201d After the Journal shared its findings about post-offering trading with the West Contra Costa district, then-Associate Superintendent John al-Amin said that those findings \u201care deeply concerning and would undermine the faith bond issuers have in the municipal market.\u201d\n\nAlthough underwriters often make money by reselling flipped bonds, that doesn\u2019t appear to be their primary motive.\n\nUnderwriters are obligated to purchase any bonds they can\u2019t place with customers, which ties up cash and exposes them to risk. So they have an incentive to price the bonds to move\u2014and, if necessary, to sell them to customers who have no intention of holding them for long. When those customers want to sell, the underwriter often will step in to buy.\n\nUnder federal rules, underwriters have a duty to set prices that are \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d taking into consideration all relevant factors, including their \u201cbest judgment\u201d of the fair market value. In recent years, the Securities and Exchange Commission has begun enforcement efforts aimed at protecting issuers during the pricing and sale of bonds.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has begun enforcement efforts aimed at protecting issuers during the pricing and sale of bonds.

The settlement marked the first time the SEC has determined that underwriter pricing behavior violated the fair dealing standard, even though there was no fraud or misrepresentation. IFS, which didn\u2019t admit or deny the findings, didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe identity of buyers and sellers of municipal bonds isn\u2019t public information. The Journal identified some using regulatory reports insurers file with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or NAIC.\n\nDuring the period of the Journal\u2019s analysis, insurers bought and quickly sold $3.7 billion of newly issued municipal bonds, the filings show. Of that total, $2.6 billion, or 70%, was sold back to the underwriter that had just priced and sold the bonds. The underwriter paid the insurer more than the initial price 88% of the time.\n\nThat pattern played out with a $3.7 million bond that was part of the West Contra Costa offering:\n\nTrade number Note: Trade sequences may be slightly out of order due to reporting lags. Sources: Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board; National Association of Insurance Commissioners On the first day of trading, the lead underwriter, Piper Jaffrey, sold all of the bond in five trades at the offering price of 97.735. Two of the customers who bought a total of $2.35 million in bonds in two trades sold, or 'flipped,' the bonds within a day. One of those customers, insurer Safety National Casualty, sold its bonds back to Piper Jaffray at a price of 98.650, giving it a profit of $10,065. Piper Jaffray then sold the same amount to another dealer at a price of 98.750, for a profit of $1,100. Dealers that bought from Piper Jaffray also resold the bonds at higher prices. At the end of nine days of trading, most of the bonds were owned by long-term investors, who paid on average 2.8% more than the offering price. Read the full methodology\n\nIn recent months, municipal-bond prices have risen following years of decline in borrowing by state and local issuers due to changes in tax law and financial constraints on governments.\n\nWhen cities and school districts decide to sell municipal bonds, they engage securities firms to underwrite them. Generally, the public entities have two options. They can put the bonds up for competitive bids and award them to the securities firms that price them with the lowest interest cost. Or they can choose an underwriter in what is known as a negotiated offering. Negotiated offerings account for about 75% of the money raised in bond offerings.\n\nSuppose a town needs to raise $20 million to build a new town hall. The securities firm it selects as lead underwriter examines the town\u2019s finances, as well as interest rates for U.S. Treasurys and other municipal bonds. Then it gauges investor appetite for the town\u2019s bonds at different interest rates and maturity dates.\n\nThe underwriter, after consulting with the issuer, slices the total amount to be raised into a series of bonds with different interest rates and maturity dates, then buys the bonds at a discount to their offering prices\u2014typically less than half a percentage point. The difference between the discounted price and what the underwriter sells them for is the underwriter\u2019s pay.\n\nThe underwriting process sets up an obvious conflict. The municipal issuer wants to pay the lowest possible interest rate. The underwriter wants to ensure the bonds will be attractive enough to easily resell to investors and bond dealers. The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, or MSRB, which writes rules for underwriters, requires them to disclose that they have \u201cfinancial and other interests that differ from those of the issuer.\u201d\n\nShare Your Thoughts How closely should local governments monitor municipal-bond underwriters? Join the conversation below.\n\nMany issuers engage advisers to help navigate the process and monitor the underwriters.\n\nPrairie-Hills Elementary School District 144, which serves pre-kindergartners through eighth-graders in Chicago\u2019s economically struggling south suburbs, didn\u2019t hire an adviser when it issued bonds in 2016. It needed money to add vestibules to school entrances so its staff could see and talk with visitors before buzzing them in, the superintendent said. An elementary-school roof needed to be replaced. School board members were eager to add air conditioning to classrooms.\n\nThe district hired Oppenheimer & Co., which priced and sold about $20 million of municipal bonds on March 22, 2016. By the end of the first trading day, one-quarter of the bonds had been flipped, some of them back to Oppenheimer itself, according to the Journal\u2019s analysis.\n\nThe Prairie-Hills school district near Chicago, which includes the Fieldcrest Elementary School, hired Oppenheimer & Co. to sell about $20 million of municipal bonds. Photo: Pictometry\n\nOppenheimer, a unit of Oppenheimer Holdings Inc., bought back about $1.6 million in bonds it had sold to insurer Contintental Casualty Co. just hours earlier, then resold them for a profit of $10,969, NAIC and MSRB trading records show. Continental made $10,530.\n\nTrading in the first 10 days after the offering netted Oppenheimer and traders at other firms nearly $700,000, or about $540,000 when adjusted to account for movements in the broader market.\n\nContinental Casualty flipped bonds with underwriters 845 times between 2013 and 2017, the most of any insurer appearing in the Journal\u2019s analysis. A spokesman declined to discuss those trades, saying by email: \u201cWe are not going to share any insights into this practice at this time.\u201d\n\nThe trading profits suggest the bonds were underpriced, meaning taxpayers will wind up spending additional money for interest payments.\n\nOppenheimer said in written statements it had followed its standard protocol and is \u201cconfident that the pricing of the bonds was fair, reasonable and equitable to the district.\u201d\n\nIt said 2016 was a difficult financial year for Illinois and Cook County, and there was \u201csignificant uncertainty as to whether state aid would be available to fund the district\u2019s budget.\u201d\n\nThe district\u2019s bonds, however, were somewhat insulated from those concerns because they were insured, earning them a rating of AA by Standard & Poor\u2019s, now S&P Global. Oppenheimer said that while it \u201csought buy-and-hold market participants, traditional buyers except for one, did not participate.\u201d\n\nLast year, the Prairie-Hills district discussed issuing another bond to turn an old junior-high school into a building that could house a magnet school and alternative school programs. If the district decides to issue bonds, it will hire a municipal adviser, said Superintendent Kimako Patterson.\n\nThe Journal\u2019s analysis \u201cis of intense interest and concern,\u201d the superintendent said. \u201cDistricts pretty much depend on companies like Oppenheimer to be honest and do what\u2019s in our best interest.\u201d\n\nThe MSRB, a self-regulatory organization overseen by the SEC, established the rule saying that underwriters have a duty to set \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d prices, but its rules also say the underwriter isn\u2019t required to \u201cexert its best efforts to obtain the \u2018most favorable\u2019 pricing\u201d unless it tells the issuer it will do that.\n\nIn an interview, MSRB senior adviser and former general counsel Michael Post said: \u201cWe have longstanding rules that require underwriters to treat issuers fairly and to purchase the bonds in an underwriting at a fair price.\u201d He declined to comment on specific trades in the Journal\u2019s analysis.\n\nIn 2017, the Washington Economic Development Finance Authority sold $134 million of tax-exempt bonds on behalf of a private company building a facility that would convert farm waste to paper pulp. The company, Columbia Pulp I LLC, paid Goldman Sachs & Co. $3.8 million, or about 2.9% of the money raised, to underwrite the bonds.\n\nThe unit of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. set prices so the bonds would generate annual interest of 7.75% for buyers\u2014a high yield indicative of the speculative nature of the company\u2019s new technology. Goldman sold the bonds in 25 trades, all at 11 a.m. on July 25, 2017.\n\nA little more than an hour later, some of the original buyers sold $10.75 million of the bonds to dealers at 5.3% more than they had just paid, generating profits of $571,000.\n\nLater that day, according to NAIC filings, Goldman bought back $6.6 million of bonds it had sold to insurers for $376,000 more than the buyers had paid. Trading records show Goldman then resold those bonds for a $42,000 profit.\n\nWithin 10 trading days of the initial sale, $32 million of the bonds were flipped by initial buyers, the Journal analysis showed. Goldman and the dealers and customers who bought and resold them made market-adjusted profits totaling $2.2 million.\n\nColumbia Pulp declined to comment. In a written statement, the Economic Development Finance Authority said it \u201cdoes not assume responsibility for or monitor secondary market trading in its bond issues.\u201d\n\nThe post-offering buying and selling suggests bonds sold by the West Contra Costa school district, where John F. Kennedy High School is located, were initially underpriced. Photo: Brian L. Frank for The Wall Street Journal\n\nAfter the West Contra Costa bond offering in 2016, the underwriter, Piper Jaffray, said in a report to the school district that 23 financial firms and 16 smaller investors had bought $180 million of the $191 million in bonds. The report identified those firms as \u201cgoing-away\u201d buyers.\n\nThe district\u2019s financial adviser, Mr. Boehm, later told the school board: \u201cThe term \u2018going away\u2019 means that\u2026these are true buyers. These are not dealers looking to just buy the bonds for purposes of putting [them] in the trading inventory.\u201d\n\nA Piper Jaffray spokeswoman said the firm didn\u2019t intend to give school officials the impression that the $180 million worth of bonds wouldn\u2019t be resold.\n\nWrite to Tom McGinty at tom.mcginty@wsj.com and Heather Gillers at heather.gillers@wsj.com", "description": "A Journal analysis of trading data suggests new bonds often are underpriced, which means taxpayers will pay more in interest.", "authors": ["Tom Mcginty", "Heather Gillers", "Tom.Mcginty Wsj.Com", "Heather.Gillers Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-101550/social", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
