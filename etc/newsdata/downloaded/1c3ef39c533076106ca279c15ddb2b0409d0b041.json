He says marriage, the \"best season of my life,\" has since taught him \"patience, trust, commitment, kindness, humility and all the things it looks like to be a good man.\"\n\nHe concludes with words of encouragement for others who may be struggling: \"Be kind today, be bold today and love people today not by your standards but by God's perfect unfailing love.\"\n\nBack in March, Bieber took to social media to announce a break from music. Since then though, the singer has appeared on songs with Billie Eilish, Ed Sheeran, Chris Brown and Lil Dicky.", "description": "The Canadian pop star also looks back at how fame at a young age drove him to drugs.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5268506.1567521203!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/justin-bieber.jpg"}
