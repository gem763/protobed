Though he usually appears in public in a crisp suit, for the flight he\u2019s dressed casually: dark-wash jeans, a navy blue zip-up hoodie emblazoned with the slogan \u201cLa French Tech,\u201d a two-day beard.\n\nIt\u2019s the second all-hands meeting of the eight-hour flight to New York City for the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly and Macron is plotting how to pull off his most audacious foreign policy move yet \u2014 putting U.S. President Donald Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in the same room, to engineer a breakthrough in their two countries\u2019 40-year conflict.\n\nBut in high-stakes diplomacy, like everything else, logistics are key, and Macron\u2019s time in New York will be short.\n\n\u201cTrump is Tuesday?\u201d Macron asks his advisers, referring to his own scheduled encounter with the American leader. \u201cCan we try pulling him up to Monday?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe first thinks in terms of France shining in the world\" \u2014 A high-level Elys\u00e9e adviser\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d answers Emmanuel Bonne, his chief diplomatic adviser. \u201cWe already know that he is busy all Monday afternoon.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen does he speak at the General Assembly?\u201d Macron shoots back. \u201cWe should try to catch him after his speech, that\u2019s when it makes sense.\n\n\u201cWhat we should do is go catch him in the room in the back,\u201d he concludes. The plan is set. All that\u2019s left is to carry it out.\n\nCall it the Macron method.\n\nPOLITICO was granted access to the French president and his entourage during his two-day visit to the U.N., as Macron sought to broker the first face-to-face meeting between a U.S. and Iranian president in four decades.\n\nWhat emerged was an inside look at a hyperactive, disruptive foreign policy that\u2019s highly dependent on the French president\u2019s personal relations with other leaders \u2014 and above all, ambitious.\n\nHalfway through his five-year mandate, Macron has set himself apart with a series of high-profile diplomatic interventions that are as bold as they are seemingly intractable.\n\nThe balls he is currently juggling include an attempt to reboot the European Union, a play at resetting relations between Russia and the West, a bid to save the Iran nuclear deal \u2014 and an effort to literally try to save the planet from catastrophic climate change.\n\n\u201cHe first thinks in terms of France shining in the world,\u201d says a high-level Elys\u00e9e adviser, who asked to remain anonymous because he\u2019s not allowed to speak publicly. \u201cThen in terms of European sovereignty [promoting EU interests]. And then in terms of creating new dynamics.\u201d\n\nUkraine, the Amazon, Libya, the United States, Venezuela \u2014 no part of the world is too far outside the traditional French orbit, no scheme too bold, no possibility of disappointment enough of a deterrent.\n\n\u201cMister President, we need hope! Help us!\u201d \u2014 Two Venezuelan women shout to Macron in New York\n\nJust as Macron broke free of his country\u2019s left-right ideological divide during his long-shot campaign for the presidency, so has he tried to shrug off the traditional constraints to international decision-making.\n\nIn pursuing his diplomatic ambitions, the French president has consistently courted disruption \u2014 even if it ultimately backfires \u2014 in order to try to advance his country\u2019s interests on a global chessboard that hasn\u2019t seen so much unpredictability since the end of World War II.\n\nIf that leaves Macron frequently exposed to failure, his advisers say, it also opens up opportunities \u2014 however slim \u2014 to punch through seemingly insolvable problems.\n\n\u201cHe has the courage to act,\u201d the high-level adviser said. \u201cToday who is willing to expose himself on the Iranian file? Who is willing to expose himself on the Libyan issue? Who is willing to seek out Trump? If Macron doesn\u2019t do it, who will?\u201d\n\nPrice of ambition\n\nThis is what it\u2019s like to walk the streets of New York with Macron.\n\nThe French president is strutting through midtown Manhattan with a coterie of advisers, ministers and bodyguards. He walks with confidence, hands in the pockets of his perfectly tailored navy blue suit, enjoying shoutouts from onlookers behind the wooden security barriers set up around the U.N. perimeter for the duration of the summit.\n\n\u201cMister President, you are magical!\u201d a Frenchman shouts from a street corner.\n\n\u201cThank you for everything!\u201d an American woman chimes in.\n\nMacron stops, asks the man where he\u2019s from in France, and his Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire leaps out to volunteer to snap a picture.\n\n\u201cMister President, we need hope! Help us!\u201d two Venezuelan women plead with him. He approaches them and cups their hands in his.\n\n\u201cI spoke with the Bolivian president yesterday, and we are going to continue working on this,\u201d he says. He looks at them intently. He gives the impression that he\u2019s letting them in on a secret.\n\nAnd yet, accolades aside, the results of the Macron method have been, at best, mixed.\n\nThe French president caused a stir this summer when he hosted Vladimir Putin at his presidential summer retreat in Br\u00e9gan\u00e7on in the south of France, a week before the G7 summit. The move was widely seen as a prelude to reintegrating Moscow into the Western world order despite the Russian president\u2019s bloody track record in Ukraine, Syria, and \u2014 with the use of a nerve agent to try to murder a former Russian spy living in the U.K. \u2014 on EU soil.\n\n\u201cRussia is very profoundly European,\u201d Macron said at a joint presser with Putin. \u201cRussia fully belongs within a Europe of values.\u201d\n\nMacron is so adamant about resetting relations with Russia that he publicly threatened his own foreign service over it, warning a gathering of over a hundred ambassadors at his yearly address to the diplomatic corps not to undermine his efforts.\n\n\u201cWe have a deep state,\u201d he said at the August gathering. \u201cThe collective tendency might be to say, [the French president said something] but we know the truth, we will continue the way we always have. I would recommend you not take that path.\u201d\n\nWhat France lacks in hard influence, Macron tries to make up for with sheer audacity and willpower.\n\nAnd yet, so far, Macron and his advisers have been hard pressed to point to concrete action \u2014 beyond a recent prisoner exchange with Ukraine \u2014 Russia has taken that indicates Putin is ready for a fundamental overhaul of his country\u2019s relationship with Europe.\n\nSimilarly, Macron has struggled to get traction with his attempts to overhaul the EU, a key part of his foreign policy. Since his election as president, Macron has laid out an agenda of reform, with speeches and proposals \u2014 but his efforts have been met with institutional, diplomatic and German reluctance and suspicion that his professed Europhilia is nothing more than blue-and-gold plating on the traditional French agenda.\n\nHe emerged from May\u2019s European Parliament election in control of the institution\u2019s third largest political group, breaking the two-party stranglehold that had dominated European politics for decades. He also came out looking like the winner from the negotiations over Europe\u2019s top jobs, with his last-minute candidate Ursula von der Leyen nominated for European Commission president, his Belgian ally Charles Michel in the European Council and France\u2019s Christine Lagarde headed for the European Central Bank.\n\nBut his disregard for established political practice has not just ruffled many feathers in the hallways of Brussels; it seems to have turned many in the city \u2014 and the Parliament \u2014 against him.\n\nThe initial sense, reinforced by French boasting, that Macron had pulled off a coup by backing von der Leyen has cooled, with some questioning whether his support of a German conservative closely allied with Chancellor Angela Merkel will work out to his advantage. He also suffered one of his most high-profile defeats yet, when his nominee for French commissioner, Sylvie Goulard, was overwhelmingly voted down in her confirmation hearing at the European Parliament last week \u2014 in no small part as retribution for his hubris.\n\nMano a mano\n\nBack in New York, the U.N. General Assembly has started. It\u2019s an hour and a half before Macron is scheduled to deliver his speech, and he and his advisers are working on the wording, huddled inside the tiny \u201cFrance bureau\u201d in the U.N. headquarters in New York, with its view of the East River.\n\nEvery few minutes, one of his aides opens the door and hurries into the hallway. \u201cWhere are the speeches from last year and the year before? He wants to see them!\u201d one says.\n\n\u201cOne hour to go, version eight coming out,\u201d sighs another, standing over the portable printer the president\u2019s aide de camp carries with him.\n\nFrance may be a regional power, a cultural power, an economic power \u2014 a nuclear power with a seat on the U.N. Security Council. But it\u2019s not a superpower. Macron may be a player, but he can\u2019t act as the sole protagonist. He can mediate and create opportunities, but he\u2019s not in a position to force concessions.\n\nSo what France lacks in hard influence, Macron tries to make up for with sheer audacity and willpower. An amateur boxer, he has turned global diplomacy into a contact sport \u2014 with a willingness to throw out the rule book and go mano a mano if that\u2019s what it takes to move forward his agenda.\n\n\u201cThe calling of France is to try and weigh in on this world order with the cards that we have,\u201d Macron told the gathering of his ambassadors in August. \u201cIt\u2019s this strategy of audacity, of taking risks, which means that everything we are doing and everything we will do will maybe not succeed \u2026 what is fatal today is not trying.\u201d\n\nMacron seems fatigue-retardant. He is said to sleep very little and work incessantly. His advisers stay up answering messages over an encrypted app until 1 or 2 a.m. on a daily basis, including weekends.\n\nHis aides joke among themselves about one of his favorite catchphrases. \u201cThe funniest is when he comes up to me and says, in a genuine, earnest way: \u2018Hey, get some rest,\u2019\u201d one of them says, with a hint of irony. They would love to do just that \u2014 if only their boss\u2019 demands weren\u2019t so constant.\n\nDespite his seemingly boundless energy, the frenetic pace of work has taken a physical toll on Macron. His two and a half years in power have aged him. His sideburns \u2014 which he keeps long, almost \u201970s style \u2014 are grayer, the lines around his eyes and the carving of his cheeks more pronounced.\n\nHis constant juggling has caught up with him, publicly, at least once. At a joint press conference with Chilean President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era at the G7 in August, Macron seemed distracted.\n\n\u201cRegarding President Trump, I think what works is the direct relationship\" \u2014 Emmanuel Macron\n\nHe kept checking his phone, prompting Pi\u00f1era to ask him at one point: \u201cDo you agree with what I just said?\u201d\n\nBehind the scenes, discussions were ongoing about what to announce after the surprise visit of Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, a prelude to his efforts in New York.\n\nZarif\u2019s presence, for a little over three hours, in a building across the street from where G7 leaders, including Trump, were meeting was a quintessential Macron moment.\n\nHad it been handled differently, the invitation could have made Trump feel like he had been both ambushed and upstaged. Instead, it focused the world\u2019s attention on a summit that many had dismissed as yet another useless gathering of leaders who can barely agree among themselves, let alone constructively work together on the world\u2019s problems.\n\nShuffle diplomacy\n\nNo relationship with a foreign leader has taken up as much of Macron\u2019s time as his relationship with Trump.\n\nAfter an initial bromance forged over white-knuckle macho handshakes, Trump repeatedly took aim at the French president, ostentatiously withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement, making terse threats of sanctions over a French effort to provide a financial lifeline to Iran and even publicly siding with the Yellow Jackets protesting against Macron\u2019s government.\n\nMore recently, however, things have been mostly going well between the two men \u2014 as Macron has developed a strategy of smothering the U.S. president with attention.\n\n\u201cRegarding President Trump, I think what works is the direct relationship,\u201d Macron told reporters at his closing press conference at the G7.\n\nIt\u2019s that relationship that allows Macron to execute the plan he hatched on the plane, when Trump shows up unexpectedly for part of the U.N.\u2019s climate summit on the first day of the assembly. Seeing his opportunity, Macron pounces, pulling the U.S. president aside as he leaves the hall.\n\nThe next day, Macron tries to close the deal. After Trump delivers his speech at the General Assembly, Macron takes another opportunity to grab him. As the two men talk, Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, who was meant to meet with Macron, is kept waiting for half an hour in the \u201cFrance Bureau.\u201d He\u2019d come with three of his grandchildren, eager to take their picture with the French president.\n\nAfter Macron takes the stage at the U.N. General Assembly a little later that afternoon, he and Trump hold a third meeting, sitting down with their ministers and advisers at the Lotte New York Palace Hotel where Trump had set up shop.\n\nFrench and U.S. officials have been in contact for hours, if not days. So it takes just a quarter of an hour for Trump to agree to a four-point plan as a basis for a meeting with Rouhani.\n\nFrom there, Macron and his entourage are off to the Millenium Hilton New York One UN Plaza Hotel, where the Iranian president is staying. Kissinger may have invented shuttle diplomacy, but Macron does shuffle diplomacy, moving by foot between Trump and Iranian officials in an increasingly high-stakes mediation.\n\nAs he waits to be invited up to the room where Rouhani holds his meetings, Macron huddles with his team in a small conference room, tucked behind a hidden door in the bustling lobby.\n\nTogether with his foreign minister and his trade minister, as well as his two top diplomatic advisers, he discusses how best to convince Rouhani to sign up to the agreement he\u2019s struck with Trump.\n\n\u201cThe second point is going to be difficult for him to accept, but I will mention the ballistic [missile program] here in this context,\u201d says Macron, in reference to a clause in the document about Iran\u2019s aggressive activities in the Arab world.\n\nTrump, he says, is expecting his call when the meeting with Rouhani is over.\n\nMacron's hands are in his pockets. He\u2019s walking with a swagger. He hasn\u2019t given up hope on striking an agreement.\n\nAfter the huddle, Macron and a small part of his team are taken by the Iranians up to the elevator to meet with Rouhani.\n\nFifteen minutes later, he comes back down \u2014 empty handed. Rouhani had agreed in principle on the document\u2019s points but did not yet have authority to go ahead with a meeting with Trump. He needed to consult Tehran. \u201cWe still have some work to do\u201d Macron announces when he reemerges from the elevator.\n\nThe French president and his advisers walk back to the nearby French mission. Deep in conversation with his top diplomatic adviser Bonne, Macron goes over next steps.\n\n\u201c[Iranian nuclear negotiator Abbas] Araghchi is going to call Tehran now, discuss the technical details,\u201d Bonne says.\n\nMacron shoots back, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to start renegotiating.\u201d\n\nHis hands are in his pockets. He\u2019s walking with a swagger. He hasn\u2019t given up hope on striking an agreement.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wondering if we\u2019re going to have to push back our take-off time,\u201d he tells POLITICO. \u201cWe are making progress. We are seeing that the positions are growing closer.\u201d\n\nThe day ends in disappointment. Macron makes one last try to strike a deal. Sensing a meeting might be too big a step for Iran to take, Macron and his team suggests a secure phone call with Trump at 9 p.m. that evening.\n\nMacron delays his departure, and returns to Rouhani\u2019s quarters to facilitate the call, but in the end it\u2019s a no-go. Tehran insists that Trump needs to lift his sanctions before any contact can take place.\n\nThe plane takes off later that evening, three hours after the planned departure. Macron walks up and down the aisles, checking in on his aides, thanking his support staff. It\u2019s not the ending he wanted. But he\u2019s already thinking about the next episode.", "description": "Behind the scenes of the French president\u2019s close-contact foreign policy.", "authors": ["Rym Momtaz", "Ma\u00efa De La Baume"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PoliticoFinalCover_rgbCROP-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
