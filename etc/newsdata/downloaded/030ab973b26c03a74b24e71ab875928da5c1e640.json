Senior reporter Ben Penn spread his \u201cSCOOP\u201d on Twitter about how \u201cTrump Labor Department's new sr adviser Leif Olson posted on Facebook that Jewish media \u2018protect their own.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe story was worse. It was headlined: \u201cTrump Labor Aide Quits After Anti-Semitic Facebook Posts Surface.\u201d The piece led with skewering Olson for having \u201ca history of advancing controversial conservative and faith-based causes in court.\u201d Oh no!\n\nNEWT GINGRICH: WHAT IF WE LOST ELECTRIC POWER \u2026 FOR YEARS?\n\nThat didn\u2019t stop the Anti-Defamation League from initially bashing Olson. Rather than face the media firestorm, Olson resigned.\n\nOnly the story didn\u2019t end there. That was just the beginning. The ADL backed out when it realized Olson was actually mocking someone else\u2019s anti-Semitism. And then a ton of people threw their support behind Olson \u2013 across political lines.\n\nEven in battleground 2019, there was widespread disgust at the way that Bloomberg and Penn tried to destroy Olson, simply because he\u2019s conservative.\n\nFor a while, Bloomberg stood by Penn\u2019s lousy reporting. Washington Post Media Critic Erik Wemple described that attitude as \u201cunsurprising and highly disappointing.\u201d Lefty Vox headlined its take, \u201cHow mocking anti-Semitism got a Trump official falsely accused of actual anti-Semitism.\u201d And conservative National Review described the incident as \u201cBen Penn\u2019s Bad-Faith Hit Job on Leif Olson.\u201d\n\nNationalReview.com Editor Charles Cooke called the story \u201ca deliberate attempt to get a guy fired for mocking the very position you\u2019re accusing him of holding.\u201d\n\nPundits lined up to blast Penn. Commentary Editor John Podhoretz messaged Penn and called him a \u201cRepugnant child\u201d and said he was \u201ceither stupid\u201d or \u201cutter garbage.\u201d Penn actually captured an image of the comments and posted it, acting indignant. Only that generated even more criticism.\n\nNationalReview.com Editor Charles Cooke called the story \u201ca deliberate attempt to get a guy fired for mocking the very position you\u2019re accusing him of holding.\u201d\n\nOf course, no true D.C. scandal is ever complete without the cover-up. And Bloomberg supplied it. After the story blew up, the outlet \u201cremoved \u2018Anti-Semitic\u2019 from the headline and clarified Olson\u2019s reference to those tropes.\u201d It still left the original hit job on the site.\n\nAnd then it tried to get people to stop talking about it. The Washington Post reported that a Bloomberg editor urged staffers not to \u201ctweet out the story or about the story (or use any other social media to post anything).\u201d The goal was to avoid \u201cmore Twitter-rage.\u201d\n\nBipartisanship has finally returned to Washington. Penn and Bloomberg Law are widely and deservedly mocked on both sides of the aisle. And Olson got his job back, in the ultimate rejection of Penn\u2019s politics of destruction.\n\nSleepless Nights at The New York Times\n\nThe New York Times has been on a downward spiral lately. It\u2019s not that paper has gone farther left, it just can\u2019t hide it anymore. It\u2019s been only a month since a headline that treated President Trump fairly was changed and it appears that Times staffers have lost their minds.\n\nOr maybe that\u2019s not new.\n\nSuch is the case of Times columnist Michelle Goldberg, who was writing about the newspaper\u2019s favorite topic \u2013 the demise of the Republican Party. She was referencing the book \u201cR.I.P. G.O.P.,\u201d which claims the 2020 election \u201cwill produce a second blue wave on at least the scale of the first in 2018 and finally will crash and shatter the Republican Party.\u201d\n\nGoldberg twisted that into her ideal fantasy: \u201cthe Republican Party, that foul agglomeration of bigotry and avarice that has turned American politics into a dystopian farce, not just defeated but destroyed.\u201d\n\nBut in the course of her counting chickens exercise, she let slip a personal detail. Speaking of author and pollster Stanley Greenberg, she noted: \u201cHis confidence will not be enough to lessen the insomnia that has plagued me since the cursed night when Trump was elected.\u201d\n\nSo, she can\u2019t sleep because of \u2026 Trump. Maybe she should read the Times.\n\nCollege Athletics in Black and White\n\nAtlantic staff writer and former ESPN host Jemele Hill host caused controversy about African-American athletes this past week. Her black-and-white analysis had people seeing red all over.\n\nIt all started with the headline that read, \u201cIt\u2019s Time for Black Athletes to Leave White Colleges.\u201d Hill\u2019s article followed that up with suggesting black athletes pick historically black colleges and universities instead. She was roundly criticized as being \u201cpro-segregation\u201d and asked what a \u201cwhite college\u201d was.\n\nHill wrote that the idea could \u201cbring some welcome attention and money to beleaguered black colleges, which invested in black people when there was no athletic profit to reap.\u201d But she went on, noting that, \u201cMore revolutionarily, perhaps they could disrupt the reign of an \u2018amateur\u2019 sports system that uses the labor of black folks to make white folks rich.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nSinger Kaya Jones responded, saying: \u201cMy grandparents went through it! It was illegal in most countries to be married outside your race. MLK and my grandparents are rolling in their graves.\u201d\n\nHill has said and written controversial things about race before. She made a comment about Malcolm X\u2019s assassination that she tied to Trump, eventually offering to apologize. Then she quoted the late president Andrew Johnson saying said that the U.S. has \u201ca government for white men\u201d and added that, \u201cUnder Trump, Johnson\u2019s wish came true.\"\n\n\u2018Compassionate\u2019 Stripping\n\nYou\u2019d think it was sweeps month over at \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d ABC has long had a lurid fascination with fringy sex stories, even highlighting Erika Eiffel, who changed her name to Eiffel because she had a commitment ceremony with the Eiffel Tower.\n\nThis week we had strippers. It was for a good cause, though. GMA was promoting the new Jennifer Lopez movie \u201cHustlers.\u201d GMA anchor Adrienne Bankert described it as a \u201cstar-studded female-led drama where the women flip the script\u201d and called it a \u201ccompassionate message about love and friendship.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWell, not exactly. They strip for and then rob their clients. The GMA gang fell over themselves showing respect for the idea of sex work and robbery. Host Michael Strahan responded to the idea with the rationalization of the day: \u201cYou gotta do what you gotta do.\u201d\n\nHe even asked former Disney Pop Tart Keke Palmer, who plays Mercedes, what her ideal stripper name would be. Palmer told viewers that \u201cit would be something sweet like baby girl, or baby doll.\u201d Ah, the wholesome family fun of felonious stripping.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY DAN GAINOR", "description": "NationalReview.com Editor Charles Cooke called the story \u201ca deliberate attempt to get a guy fired for mocking the very position you\u2019re accusing him of holding.\u201d", "authors": ["Dan Gainor", "Dan Gainor Is The Vice President For Techwatch", "Business", "Culture At The"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/04/694940094001_6083527106001_6083527905001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
