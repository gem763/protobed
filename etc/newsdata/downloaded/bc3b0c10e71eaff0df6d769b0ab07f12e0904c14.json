The second you get that \u201cout of office\u201d auto-reply, you suddenly remember the twenty minute conversation you had about their upcoming trip to Hawaii and feel like a goober. Meanwhile, they come back to a thousand \u201cHey, can you help with this? OH NEVERMIND SORRY ENJOY YOUR TRIP!\u201d email threads.\n\nGoogle is trying to make this happen a little less often with a feature it\u2019ll soon roll out for its G Suite (read: paid Gmail/Docs/Hangouts/Calendar/etc. plans for businesses) users. If you\u2019ve marked yourself as out of office on your calendar, your coworkers will get a heads up before they email you.\n\nThe heads up comes in the form of a little yellow banner that hovers right above the send button, alerting the sender that you\u2019re currently out of the office, and when you\u2019re set to return.\n\nA similar message will pop up if they try to message you in Hangouts, too.\n\nIt all ties into the out-of-office functionality that the company introduced into Google Calendar last year, which automatically declines all meeting requests for the window in which you\u2019ll be gone.\n\nYou probably don\u2019t want every rando/spammer who tries to email you to know your travel plans, so Google says that the Gmail/Hangouts heads up functionality will only work with Gsuite users that have already been granted access to your calendar otherwise. So it\u2019s information they already had, now they just don\u2019t have to go looking for it.\n\nIf you don\u2019t like the concept or the banner screws with your workflow for some reason, each user can disable it \u2014 go into the \u201cAccess permissions\u201d section of your Google Calendar settings, and turn off \u2018Show calendar info in other Google apps\u2019.", "description": "What a handy little banner this will be.", "authors": ["Greg Kumparak"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6970ee250000710a752608.jpeg?ops=1778_1000"}
