Initially, the social media profile fields were optional, but the DHS made themobligatory for all visa applications in May, this year. See a full timeline here.\n\nThe AP reported back in June that the DHS was planning to expand this procedure, but did not provide any details. The federal registry submission this week explains the changes in greater detail.\n\nPer the official document, immigrants, asylum seekers, and refugees will be required to list all the social media platforms they used in the past five years, along with the respective usernames.\n\nThe DHS plans to update the following forms to add social media collection fields:\n\nForm N-400 - document immigrants, asylum seekers, and refugees must file for beginning the naturalization procedure.\n\n- document immigrants, asylum seekers, and refugees must file for beginning the naturalization procedure. Form I-131 - document that refugees must file when wanting to travel abroad the US and be allowed re-entry into the US.\n\n- document that refugees must file when wanting to travel abroad the US and be allowed re-entry into the US. Form I-192 - document that inadmissible aliens must file to temporarily enter the US for legitimate reasons.\n\n- document that inadmissible aliens must file to temporarily enter the US for legitimate reasons. Form I-485 - document that immigrants, asylum seekers, and refugees must file for obtaining permanent residence in the US (for obtaining a green card).\n\n- document that immigrants, asylum seekers, and refugees must file for obtaining permanent residence in the US (for obtaining a green card). Form I-589 - document aliens must file for asylum in the US.\n\n- document aliens must file for asylum in the US. Form I-590 - document aliens must file for refugee status in the US.\n\n- document aliens must file for refugee status in the US. Form I-730 - document that approved asylum seekers and refugees can file to bring in family members in the US.\n\nIn June, the DHS said that lying or withholding data from these forms would have serious consequences towards an application's chance of approval.\n\nThe procedure has been marred by problems. Just in the past two weeks, two cases emerged where travelers holding a valid visa were denied entry into the US for social media posts made by their friends [case 1, case 2].\n\nThe DHS has never detailed what searches and investigations CBP and other employees carry out based on the provided social media profile information.\n\nApplicants for green cards or US citizenship may not be too happy with the DHS' upcoming plan.\n\nThe program will also draw the ire of privacy advocates. In 2016, the the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) called the DHS' proposal to collect social media profile from visa applicants \"an intelligence surveillance program clothed as a customs administration mechanism.\"\n\nThe DHS will be seeking comments and insight from interested parties on its new rules until November 4, when the process will move forward for approval and implementation.", "description": "The process of getting refugee status, a green card, and citizenship will become way more intrusive.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/06/20e68d9b-cfd2-4b32-89c0-c48caf3fb2f4/thumbnail/770x578/7461f1bd23e7d7a7996f5c05b2e43e83/us-flag.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
