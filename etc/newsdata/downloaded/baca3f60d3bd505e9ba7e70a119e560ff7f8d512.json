In search of a convenient narrative, Solomon has embraced questionable sources and even shared a pre-publication copy of one story with a Ukrainian American businessman who federal authorities now say was illegally trying to influence American politics.\n\nSolomon\u2019s articles are emblematic of the way the right-wing news pipeline to Trump functions: Shaky allegations get picked up by eager partisan journalists, who are then featured on Fox News where they grab the attention of the president.\n\nLast week, Solomon defended his decision to send a draft of a March 26 story on a Ukrainian anti-corruption organization to three Trump-associated operatives hours before its publication. The draft of his story \u2015 titled \u201cUS Embassy pressed Ukraine to drop probe of George Soros group during 2016 election\u201d \u2015 was shown to Lev Parnas, an Ukrainian American associate of Rudy Giuliani\u2019s who was arrested Thursday on charges of campaign finance violation, as well as frequent Fox News guests Joseph diGenova and Victoria Toensing. Solomon suggested this was part of his fact-checking process even though the story did not appear to concern those three beyond their interest in potentially damaging information about Trump\u2019s opponents.\n\n\u201cI typically spend a long period of time before any column or news story fact-checking information with numerous people,\u201d Solomon tweeted.\n\nBut Solomon\u2019s dedication to \u201cfact-checking information with numerous people\u201d didn\u2019t appear to extend to a main subject of his story, the Anti-Corruption Action Centre, which he suggested was \u201ccollaborating with FBI agents\u201d who were investigating Trump\u2019s then-campaign chair Paul Manafort. Solomon also suggested that AntAC, a Ukrainian organization, avoided an investigation because of the support of the Obama administration and billionaire George Soros, a common bogeyman for conservatives and target for conspiracy theorists. (AntAC receives funding from Soros\u2019 Open Society Foundations, as well as from the U.S. government and a range of other donors.)\n\nSolomon never reached out to AntAC for comment about allegations made to him by former Ukrainian prosecutor general Yuri Lutsenko, according to AntAC\u2019s executive director, Daria Kaleniuk. (Solomon\u2019s story states that he repeatedly reached out to AntAC and Open Society Foundations, although he does not specify when.) And unlike the Republican operatives, Kaleniuk said AntAC received no draft of the article before The Hill published it.\n\n\u201cI wonder why the same approach was not given to me, as he was naming my organization and he was actually sliming it,\u201d Kaleniuk told HuffPost.\n\nSolomon did initially contact Kaleniuk in October 2018, many months before publishing his column in The Hill, saying he was \u201cworking on a story for publication Monday about the DOJ\u2019s Kleptocracy Project and its success in Ukraine.\u201d He asked for comment on a number of questions, including about connections between AntAC, Soros\u2019 foundation and the FBI. Kaleniuk said she found the questions biased and conspiratorial and did not respond. Solomon did not publish anything to do with the Kleptocracy Project or Ukraine in the weeks after his email, according to The Hill\u2019s archives.\n\nAfter Solomon\u2019s story ran in March, Kaleniuk contacted The Hill\u2019s editors requesting an opportunity to comment on the allegations against her organization. But her rebuttal clearly didn\u2019t get as much traction: The Hill\u2019s website says that Solomon\u2019s original piece had over 36,000 shares, while Kaleniuk\u2019s piece had just 118. A Twitter search of accounts run by The Hill or The Hill\u2019s opinion section didn\u2019t turn up any links to Kaleniuk\u2019s piece, though the accounts did promote Solomon\u2019s work.\n\nSolomon did not respond to a voicemail message and multiple emails from HuffPost. Editors at The Hill did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nQuestionable Methods And Uneasy Colleagues\n\nSolomon has defended his journalistic practices on Twitter. In a series of tweets this month, he said he would sometimes send people a \u201csummary of my reporting\u201d before publication. But according to the Daily Beast, what Solomon sent to Republican operatives hours before his Ukraine story was posted online was no \u201csummary.\u201d It was a copy of his story \u2015 headline, lede, and paragraph after paragraph.\n\nSolomon also tweeted that this was part of a fact-checking process that he had followed at every job he\u2019d held, \u201cstarting when I was a young reporter at AP and continuing today at The Hill.\u201d It is common for journalists to send a list of fact-checking questions to a subject of an article. But sharing full, unpublished drafts \u2015 especially with partisan political operatives who are not directly involved in the story \u2015 is a violation of journalistic standards that wouldn\u2019t fly at his previous publications.\n\n\u201cAP standards prohibit any behavior or activity that creates a conflict of interest, including sharing unpublished drafts of stories with sources,\u201d a spokesperson for the Associated Press told HuffPost.\n\nSolomon said that he had over \u201cthree dozen communications over three days involved in the fact checking process for that particular story.\u201d He said his fact-checking process could catch mistakes and lead to better context and comments.\n\nSolomon\u2019s reporting has been a cause of concern for newsroom staff at The Hill, who have criticized his work for bias and shared their unease at his close ties to Trump associates. Over a dozen staff members sent a memo to The Hill\u2019s management complaining about Solomon\u2019s stories and accusing him of leaving out important context that didn\u2019t fit his theories, The Washington Post reported last year.\n\nHuffPost last year debunked a misleading piece by Solomon that suggested FBI agents who\u2019d exchanged anti-Trump text messages had leaked anti-Trump material to the media. They had not.\n\nSolomon was shifted to the role of \u201copinion contributor\u201d following the staffers\u2019 memo, according to The Daily Beast, while Solomon claimed he had requested the change.\n\nEthan Miller via Getty Images President Donald Trump is a big fan of Fox News host Sean Hannity (left) and often listens to what his guests say.\n\nShady Sources And The Fox News Pipeline\n\nQuestions have also been raised about the sources Solomon has used for his columns. His March series of stories on Ukraine \u2015 a country with complex politics he had little prior history of covering \u2015 carried a wide range of claims against U.S. Democratic officials and Obama-era appointees. He suggested that Ukrainian officials, urged along by then-U.S. Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, conspired with Democrats to influence the 2016 presidential election and release damaging information against Trump. He also contended that then-Vice President Biden pressured the Ukrainian government to fire prosecutor general Viktor Shokin in order to quash an investigation into his son Hunter Biden, who had business ties in Ukraine. (Shokin was, in fact, widely criticized for not pushing corruption cases hard enough.)\n\nOne of the main sources named in Solomon\u2019s series on Ukraine was Yuri Lutsenko, who served as prosecutor general after Shokin. Many journalists, foreign policy experts and activists who focus on Ukraine have criticized the idea of treating Lutsenko as a reliable source, saying that he, too, is a discredited figure who has been an impediment to anti-corruption efforts. After the Trump administration recalled Ambassador Yovanovitch, Lutsenko texted AntAC\u2019s Kaleniuk to brag about how he had gotten rid of the organization\u2019s ally.\n\nLutsenko has also repeatedly backtracked on his various claims, including telling the Los Angeles Times in late September that he never found any evidence of wrongdoing by the Biden family. Ukrainian authorities announced on Tuesday that they have launched a criminal investigation into Lutsenko over his alleged links to illegal gambling. Lutsenko, who traveled to the United Kingdom days before the announcement, has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nNonetheless, Solomon boosted Lutsenko\u2019s conspiracy claims against the Bidens, Yovanovitch and Clinton not only in his columns for The Hill but also on Sean Hannity\u2019s Fox News show, which often serves as a direct pipeline to Trump. The president has tweeted about Solomon at least four times this year, usually in connection with the columnist\u2019s Fox News appearances.\n\nJohn Solomon: Factual errors and major omissions in the Mueller Report show that it is totally biased against Trump. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 7, 2019\n\nAfter Solomon was on Hannity\u2019s program in March, Trump tweeted, \u201cJohn Solomon: As Russia Collusion fades, Ukrainian plot to help Clinton emerges.\u201d He was quoting the headline of Solomon\u2019s March 20 column, which was based on an interview with Lutsenko. Appearing alongside Solomon on Fox News that evening were diGenova and Toensing, two of the political operatives to whom he emailed his draft of a later March column.\n\nSolomon was back on Fox News nine days later, suggesting to host Laura Ingraham that Democrats were attempting to hide a conspiracy between Clinton and Ukrainian officials to target Trump during the 2016 campaign.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what they don\u2019t want people to start digging into,\u201d Solomon said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re digging in it. I\u2019ve been reading your reporting on that,\u201d Ingraham responded. \u201cWe look forward to the next report.\u201d", "description": "There's a direct line between John Solomon's shaky allegations and the president's brain.", "authors": ["Senior World News Reporter", "Senior Justice Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9ba9932100002a04331447.jpeg?cache=otign9hue3&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
