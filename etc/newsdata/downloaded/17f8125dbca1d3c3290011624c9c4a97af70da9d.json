'We're not gonna hurt you.'\n\nTough decision: Jessie, show host Carson Daly and Kyndal waited to learn who Gwen would name the winner\n\nJessie's version of Dancing with a Stranger, by Sam Smith and Normani, was in the pocket, and Taylor had just one note for him: Give us more.\n\nIn the knockouts, Kyndal's inventive, delicate rendition of Sia's tune beat out Jessie's R&B swagger, with Gwen saying 'she sings from her heart,' and has 'so much style to her voice.'\n\nCoach John Legend, 40, paired two of his most soulful singers for the knockout rounds.\n\nSoul singer: John Legend, 40, paired two of his most soulful singers for the knockout rounds\n\nJames Violet, 20, worked in a warehouse in Syracuse, New York, where he sang to himself in his windowless office.\n\nHis 'gorgeous' cover of Post Malone's Stay showed it was time well-spent, but Taylor urged him to stop meandering, both vocally and physically onstage.\n\nJames' competitor Khalea Lynee, 36, 'absolutely nailed' her song, C\u00e9line Dion's Because You Loved Me, Taylor added.\n\nGood times: Taylor and John laughed while preparing his singers for the Knockout Rounds\n\nCool cover:James Violet, 20, performed a cover of Post Malone's Stay\n\n'She's one of those singers that knows her stuff,' she confessed.\n\nJohn urged Khalea, a St. Petersburg, Florida, resident, to think about someone when she sang, saying it would come through on her face\u2014so she focused on her late mother.\n\n'I don't think I would be a performer if it wasn't for her,' Khalea affirmed.\n\nOnstage, her deeply emotional performance had the coaches exclaiming 'Wow,' and 'My God,' with three of them moved to stand up.\n\n'Khalea, you just made a C\u00e9line Dion song sound easy to sing,' coach Kelly Clarkson, 37, pointed out. 'If she heard that, she'd be like, ''Somebody get her out of here''.'\n\nNailed it: Khalea Lynee, 36, performed C\u00e9line Dion's Because You Loved Me\n\nEasy singing: Kelly told Khalea that she 'just made a C\u00e9line Dion song sound easy to sing'\n\n'When you're singing, and you're in the zone, you're as powerful of a human being as there is on the planet,' coach Blake Shelton, 42, agreed.\n\nJohn loved Khalea's gospel flavor, which reminded him of Whitney Houston, and he picked her.\n\nBut James was gracious in his loss, saying: 'There's not really a better person to lose to.'\n\nThe last round of the night belonged to Blake, who paired his most 'explosive' performers.\n\nCountry star: The last round of the night belonged to Blake, who paired his most 'explosive' performers\n\nMiami native Joana Martinez, 15, went toe-to-toe with Ricky Duran, 29, from Austin, Texas.\n\nThe teen was thrilled to meet her mentor, and couldn't wait to tell her sibling the news.\n\n'My sister and I always listen to Taylor Swift,' she divulged. 'I actually got to meet Taylor Swift, and now I can't wait to throw it in my sister's face.'\n\nGoofing around: The country star and Taylor enjoyed kidding each other\n\nThe high school student's cover of California Dreamin' by The Mamas & The Papas included notes that Blake said 'literally blew my mind.'\n\nBut Taylor suggested that Joana perform to the crowd more, and avoid gesticulating with her hand while singing, which undermined her powerful vocals.\n\nJoana tried again after hearing that, and it stunned Taylor, who said: 'God, you're phenomenal.'\n\n'Taylor Swift calling me ''phenomenal,'' I had no words,' Joana crowed, repeating 'Oh my God.'\n\nMind blowing: Joana Martinez's cover of California Dreamin' by The Mamas & The Papas included notes that Blake said 'literally blew my mind'\n\nHer competitor, Ricky, chose The Black Crowes hit She Talks To Angels, his girlfriend's favorite song, which played off his natural tendency to sound like singer Chris Robinson.\n\n'There's something about the way you stand and attack a lyric that kind of reminds me of the way that Springsteen plays,' Taylor told him, suggesting ways for him to carry his guitar.\n\n'Good notes,' a grateful Ricky replied.\n\n'See, she knows what she's doing\u2014that's why she owns Swift Airlines,' Blake offered.\n\nStrong singer: Ricky Duran belted out The Black Crowes hit She Talks To Angels\n\n'That's a lie,' Taylor insisted, calling him 'Blake Lively.'\n\n'I wish,' Blake noted.\n\n'Me too,' Taylor said.\n\nAt the knockouts, the girl's powerhouse vocals wowed the coaches, with Gwen saying: 'I'm really fascinated by Joana, 'cause I really wanna see what more she's gonna do.'\n\nDecision time: Joana and Ricky stood next to each other as Blake decided their fate\n\nBlake agreed, telling Joana: 'I'm continuously blown away by your talent.'\n\nBut he saved his vote for Ricky, a four-chair turn during the blind auditions, whom he liked for his rock stylings and openness to being coached.\n\nJoana was then quickly stolen by his girlfriend, Gwen, who'd 'wanted her from the beginning.'\n\nThe Voice will return on Monday on NBC.", "description": "The 29-year-old pop star was once told to give up any hope of making it in Nashville, she revealed while serving as a 'mega-mentor' on Tuesday's episode of The Voice", "authors": ["Dailymail.Com Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/03/20359370-0-image-a-52_1572407920901.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
