He needed a conference room to meet high level Italian security agents where he could be sure no one was listening in. And he needed an extra chair for U.S. Attorney John Durham of Connecticut who would be sitting at his right hand side.\n\nBarr was in Rome on an under-the-radar mission that was only planned a few days in advance. An official with the embassy confirmed to The Daily Beast that they had to scramble to accommodate Barr\u2019s sudden arrival. He had been in Italy before, but not with such a clear motive. Barr and Durham are looking into the events that led to Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation, and suddenly all roads were leading to Rome.\n\nThe Daily Beast has learned that Barr and Durham were especially interested in what the Italian secret service knew about Joseph Mifsud, the erstwhile professor from Malta who had allegedly promised then candidate Donald Trump\u2019s campaign aide George Papadopoulos he could deliver Russian \u201cdirt\u201d on Hillary Clinton. The Italian Justice Ministry public records show that Mifsud had applied for police protection in Italy after disappearing from Link University where he worked and, in doing so, had given a taped deposition to explain just why people might want to harm him.\n\nA source in the Italian Ministry of Justice, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told The Daily Beast that Barr and Durham were played the tape. A second source within the Italian government also confirmed to The Daily Beast that Barr and Durham were shown other evidence the Italians had on Mifsud.\n\nMandel Ngan/Getty More\n\nEver since Robert Mueller concluded his probe in March 2019, Barr has worked to blunt its impact\u2014and investigate the investigators behind it. Barr assigned Durham to look into the Mueller probe\u2019s origins. And the Attorney General\u2019s name is listed in the whistleblower complaint about the July 25 call Trump made to the Ukrainian president to pressure him into investigating political rival Joe Biden. According to the complaint, Barr was directly involved in the president\u2019s attempt to \u201csolicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.\u201d The minutiae of his involvement are feeding a scandal gripping Washington that changes by the nano-second.\n\nInside the Call: How Trump Pushed Ukraine to Probe Biden\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice did not return numerous emails and calls for clarification about Barr, Durham, and Mifsud. But they did issue a statement on Monday confirming that the American legal team had been in the eternal city.\n\n\u201cAs the Department of Justice has previously announced, a team led by U.S. Attorney John Durham is investigating the origins of the U.S. counterintelligence probe of the Trump 2016 presidential campaign,\u201d Kerri Kupec, the Justice Department spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cMr. Durham is gathering information from numerous sources, including a number of foreign countries. At Attorney General Barr\u2019s request, the President has contacted other countries to ask them to introduce the Attorney General and Mr. Durham to appropriate officials.\u201d\n\nThe Italian intelligence community had Mifsud on their radar for some years before he got involved in the Trump campaign\u2019s troubles. His affiliations with both the Link University of Rome and London Center of International Law Practice\u2014both often affiliated with western diplomacy and foreign intelligence agencies\u2014made him an easy target. So did the slew of apartments he owned in Malta that are allegedly tied to a racket involving Russians buying Maltese passports for cheap.", "description": "Mandel Ngan/GettyROME\u2013When Attorney General William Barr showed up at the U.S. embassy\u2019s Palazzo Margherita on Rome\u2019s tony Via Veneto last week, he had two primary requests.
