We and our advisers will use the time to ensure that at the February hearing, Telegram\u2019s position is presented and supported as much as possible.\u201d\n\nIn mid-October, reports had speculated as to whether Telegram\u2019s pledge to return money to investors in the event of a delay could be superseded by a \u201cforce majeure\u201d clause in its purchase agreement.\n\nA leaked copy of the document had revealed that the force majeure clause \u2014 which encompasses natural disasters, terrorist threats and the eruption of war \u2014 had also included legal or regulatory actions on the part of the authorities.", "description": "Investors in the Telegram Open Network and $1.7 billion Gram token sale have reportedly voted against the return of their funds in the wake of legal action by t...", "authors": ["Marie Huillet"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvNjg0ZDAwMmYyNTk5NGE2OWYxZmQ2MjhlZWI5ZDU1ZmMuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
