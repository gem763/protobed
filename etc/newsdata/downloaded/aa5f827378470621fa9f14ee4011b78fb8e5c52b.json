We want an election as soon as that\u2019s removed and it\u2019s in his hands to do so.\u201d\n\nSpeaking earlier on Sunday, the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, said only a promise from Johnson to MPs would suffice.\n\n\u201cHe could come to parliament and categorically give parliament an undertaking that he\u2019s not going to come out without a deal,\u201d she told BBC One\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show.\n\n\u201cBut he won\u2019t do that, because coming out without a deal is something that people around him like Dominic Cummings would want, because then it becomes not just Brexit but a Trump Brexit.\u201d\n\nAs well as the economic impact, Abbott said, no deal would hamper international cooperation in areas such as policing, citing the investigation into the deaths of 39 people whose bodies were found in the back of a lorry in Essex last week.\n\n\u201cIf we crash out without a deal, we have no access to the European arrest warrant, we have no access to Europol, we have no access to all sorts of important databases,\u201d she said. \u201cWe cannot crash out of the EU without a deal, and Labour will do anything in its power to stop that.\u201d\n\nBut Abbott said she would welcome an election. \u201cLabour\u2019s attitude to an election is, we\u2019re up for [it]. We have over half a million members and they want an election. I don\u2019t think any of us believe that Boris Johnson should be in power for a minute longer than is necessary,\u201d she said.\n\nHowever, many Labour MPs, and a number of shadow ministers, are wary about agreeing to an election given recent polling, with the Conservatives leading by up to 16 points.\n\nOne senior MP said Labour\u2019s coherence on the issue could be tested if the EU agreed to an extension until 31 January. \u201cI get the impression we have quite a unified position as things stand. If the EU granted a long extension, that may change,\u201d they said.\n\nLabour is poised to oppose a government motion on Monday for an election under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act. This requires two-thirds of MPs to back it, giving the party an effective veto.\n\nHowever, another route could be calling for an election via a bill, which would need only a simple majority, with both the Lib Dems and the government suggesting this as a route.\n\nAt the same time, Johnson and his ministers hope to resume efforts to push the withdrawal agreement bill through parliament.\n\nIn an interview broadcast on Sunday, Tony Blair said Corbyn should use the passage of the bill to eliminate no deal.\n\n\u201cThe sensible thing for him to say to Boris Johnson is, \u2018Yes, I\u2019ll agree to your general election, but you\u2019ve got to agree to timetable proper scrutiny of your bill and allow us to amend that so that we rule out no deal as the outcome of the future negotiation\u2019,\u201d the former prime minister told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Westminster Hour. \u201cBecause otherwise, Jeremy Corbyn hasn\u2019t prevented no deal.\u201d\n\nBlair said he would rather Brexit were decided by a second referendum, which, he argued, could take place simultaneously with a general election. \u201cYou can deal with them both on the same day if you want. But you should deal with them separately,\u201d he said.", "description": "Leader Jeremy Corbyn insists threat of leaving EU without deal has to be removed for good", "authors": ["Peter Walker", "Gary Younge"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60c871b8d62d0d7447297377c53145eb9a193048/0_5_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=453e70e6d841574fff6792e66d12a5b4", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
