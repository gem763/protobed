Times news articles are not supposed to contain opinion. A news article containing the phrase \u201cthe hijacking of public policy by religious fundamentalism\u201d would get into the paper only as a direct quote from a source. The same would go for any news article reference to \u201cthe ridiculous actual barrier\u201d on the Mexican border.\n\nThe reaction of The Times has been muted so far, however. Mr. Keller acknowledged in his e-mail to me that he has talked to Ms. Greenhouse about her remarks, but would not disclose what he said or whether her role would change. There was a more public Times response in 1989 when The Washington Post reported that Ms. Greenhouse and some Post journalists had participated in a march in support of abortion rights. In The Times\u2019s catch-up article, Howell Raines, then the paper\u2019s Washington editor, said of Ms. Greenhouse, \u201cShe now acknowledges that this was a mistake and accepts the policy.\u201d\n\nMs. Greenhouse told me she considers her remarks at Harvard to be \u201cstatements of fact\u201d \u2014 not opinion \u2014 that would be allowed to appear in a Times news article. She said The Times has not suggested that she avoid writing stories on any of the topics on which she commented in June. \u201cAny such limits would be completely preposterous,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Harvard speech was an \u201cunusual thing for me\u201d because it involved speaking to fellow alumni \u201cabout our generation ...about the culture of the times,\u201d Ms. Greenhouse said. \u201cI really felt I owed this audience the respect to speak from the heart.\u201d Almost all of her other speeches are devoted to describing and analyzing the actions of the court, she said. My instinct is that this top-notch reporter let her guard down in drafting what she considered a particularly personal speech to fellow alumni.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut as the influential Supreme Court reporter for The Times, a beat that touches nearly all areas of public policy, Ms. Greenhouse has an overriding obligation to avoid publicly expressing these kinds of personal opinions. During the current term, allowing her to cover court developments that involve the topics on which she voiced opinions in June risks giving the paper\u2019s critics fresh opportunities to snipe at its public policy coverage. This appears, however, to be a risk that Times editors are willing to take.\n\nMy predecessor, Daniel Okrent, has spoken out in various media in defense of Ms. Greenhouse in this instance, saying her unbiased court coverage shows that the strong opinions she is now known to hold have not affected her journalism or how it is perceived. He has called it a \u201ctest case\u201d that should spur a \u201cre-examination\u201d of the need for a limit on the kinds of personal opinions that news staffers express in public. The guideline also deserves scrutiny because it \u201cmakes it difficult for journalists to be citizens\u201d and \u201cpretends\u201d that they don\u2019t have opinions, the former public editor wrote in an e-mail message to me last week.\n\nThere is no perfect traffic light for the intersection of The Times\u2019s commitment to impartiality \u2014 in both perception and reality \u2014 and the personal opinions its journalists obviously hold. But I don\u2019t see Ms. Greenhouse\u2019s situation as making a case for a looser guideline. I believe there are good reasons for The Times\u2019s policy on the voicing of personal opinions in public by news staffers. Mr. Keller\u2019s e-mail to me clearly indicated that he considers the standard important and worth preserving.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In any case, The Times\u2019s policy on personal opinions should be based on the needs of the entire staff, not just an exceptional and experienced reporter like Ms. Greenhouse. There are always new or less-experienced Times news staffers, for example, who could benefit from the discipline of the guideline on expressing personal opinions.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBemoaning the difficulties journalists face in being citizens strikes an old-fashioned editor like me as whining. Forty-plus years of newspapering haven\u2019t changed my view of journalism as a calling \u2014 as a public service \u2014 that requires sacrifices and special obligations. Keeping personal opinions out of the public realm is simply one of the obligations for those who remain committed to the importance of impartial news coverage. And if the full rights of citizenship for journalists are the issue, where should the line be drawn? Should journalists contribute money or time to political candidates?\n\nThe Times\u2019s guideline requires its journalists to demonstrate, to sources and readers, a determination to be an impartial observer by keeping personal opinions separate and private \u2014 not pretending they don\u2019t exist. It\u2019s not a unique concept in our society. It doesn\u2019t seem all that different from the way judges and military officers, for instance, traditionally have been expected to exercise restraint in publicly expressing their personal views, especially about politics.\n\nThe guideline\u2019s broadest value comes from serving as a formal reminder for Times journalists of their need to be disciplined about personal opinions. Public perceptions of bias, which can be sparked by some nuance in carefully edited articles, are likely to be triggered even more easily by expressions of personal opinion outside the news columns. The merest perception of bias in a reporter\u2019s personal views can plant seeds of doubt that may grow in a reader\u2019s mind to become a major concern about the credibility of the paper.\n\n\u201cThe discipline of these guidelines is intended to fortify self-discipline, to minimize natural human temptation,\u201d Mr. Keller told me. Self-discipline has become increasingly important, given the growing number of opportunities staffers have to electronically transmit their personal views in a casual or offhand manner. Postings of personal opinions on blogs beyond The Times, unrestrained by self-discipline, are easy for critics to find and fashion into a dossier attacking the credibility of the reporter or the paper.\n\nMr. Keller advanced another interesting reason for the guideline: preventing a staffer from personally taking a public stand on some controversy, and becoming too attached to it. \u201cPublicly taking sides in a debate gives you a position to defend, an inclination to prove you are right, in a way that merely holding private opinions does not,\u201d he wrote in the e-mail. \u201cThe strongest among us can resist those temptations, but rules (and editors) exist in part because we are heir to the normal frailties that comes with being human.\u201d\n\nIn the end, I am reminded of a fleeting moment in Ms. Greenhouse\u2019s June speech. Near the end, she mentioned the dozen or so different ways she could identify herself \u2014 including being a journalist. Each of them, she acknowledged, \u201cimposes some obligations, opens some opportunities while foreclosing others.\u201d", "description": "The Times\u2019s guideline requires its journalists to demonstrate, to sources and readers, a determination to be an impartial observer by keeping personal opinions separate and private.", "authors": ["Byron Calame", "The Public Editor"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2006/04/04/opinion/calame_75.jpg", "published_at": "2006-10-08"}
