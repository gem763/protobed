He\u2019s in steady decline. He\u2019s having a hard time pronouncing people\u2019s names. He was calling Mike Pence \u2018Mike Pounce\u2019 last night. He\u2019s an angry guy and he\u2019s isolating himself from his staff,\u201d Scaramucci told Yahoo Finance, referring to a speech in Baltimore where the president mistakenly referred to Vice President Mike Pence as Mike Pounce. And to no one\u2019s surprise, #MikePounce was trending on Twitter by the end of the evening.\n\nARE YOU MIKE POUNCE pic.twitter.com/RewiscSFcT \u2014 The Volatile Mermaid (@OhNoSheTwitnt) September 13, 2019\n\nScaramucci floated the idea that the Republican leadership should replace the president as the party\u2019s nominee in 2020, telling Yahoo Finance\u2019s On the Move, \u201cIf he\u2019s the nominee, Senator McConnell and Donald Trump are Thelma and Louise driving the GOP off the cliff.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m calling on my fellow Republicans: let\u2019s take him out and put a good relief pitcher in. Let\u2019s go with the policies that work and let\u2019s get rid of the nonsense. Same policies, less crazy,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump listens to a question from reporters next to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) as he arrives for a closed Senate Republican policy lunch on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., March 26, 2019.

Scaramucci compares Trump to former President Lyndon Johnson, who famously withdrew his name from the ballot in March 1968.\n\n\u201cSenator McConnell has to go to him and say \u2018look it\u2019s not working, obviously something is wrong here, they\u2019re moving to impeach you... you\u2019ve got to leave,\u201d said Scaramucci. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to resign right now, but just finish the term and say you\u2019ve made America great, but you\u2019re not running again like Lyndon Johnson said in 1968.\u201d\n\nNick Rose is a producer for Yahoo Finance.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard,SmartNews,LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "Outspoken former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci claims the president is 'unhinged' and in 'steady decline.'", "authors": ["Nick Rose"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/PM4BarykjinHuZwfPForNQ--~B/aD0xNTgwO3c9MjgyNDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/510505d0-d667-11e9-adf7-2a95018c378a", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
