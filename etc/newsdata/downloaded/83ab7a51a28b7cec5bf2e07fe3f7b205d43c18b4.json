Real success today is inner peace and leading a peaceful life. A life free of drama and any sort of conflict. A life where your find is full of happy thoughts. A life where there is less ego and more soul. A life where you do things because they make you feel good and not to please anyone.\n\nThat's the kind of life worth living.\n\nPexels\n\nBut it's easier written than done, right? Well, take this as your baby step towards a peaceful life as we have listed things you need to wrap your head around and truly comprehend in order to live peacefully. So here we go, please do take note.\n\n1. You can't control everything.\n\nUnsplash\n\nThe only thing you can control is YOUR life. You can't control how people behave, react or how they think. You can'control everything that happens around you. So go with a flow and take a stand for things you want or don't want. And controlling everything is exhausting, so let go.\n\nDon't Miss 1.1 K SHARES 566 SHARES 417 SHARES\n\n2. Forgive and forget.\n\nPexels\n\nYou know how mentally draining it is to hold grudges or stick to fights? Yes, people do really bad things to us sometimes. And the best way to overcome that is by first grieving, giving yourself adequate time to get over whatever happened. Then, instead of bad-mouthing them or playing victim, let go. You'll realise by forgiving them, you are doing good to yourself.\n\n3. People rarely ever change.\n\nPexels\n\nThis is one of the hardest things to accept for someone who really believes that love and kindness can change people. People don't change. If they are used to behaving in a certain way all their life, it's hard to see the world differently. People have been raised in certain ways and rarely do they overcome that. Just let them be. It's not on you to change them.\n\n4. Stop living your life in order to please others.\n\nPexels\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you do everything to make other people happy, the only unhappy person in the end will be you. Is that worth it?\n\n5. Expect nothing and appreciate everything.\n\nPexels\n\nRight now, if you can think of even one person to call or run to when something goes wrong, you are better off than 95% of people out there. Because the reality is, we always have more than we value. So appreciate everything you have, nurture that love and surround yourself with it. Don't expect because expectations lead to direct disappointment.\n\n6. Kindness reciprocates.\n\nPexels\n\nMake kindness your vibe. Make people feel mad good around you even if they have nothing to offer you. Good deeds are karmic, so if you give good, you get good.\n\n7. Walk away from anything that doesn't serve you.\n\nPexels\n\nIf something is bringing out the worst in you, making you a bitter person, depriving you of everything that makes you unique, please walk away. Your future self will be thanking you years from now. Put yourself first. Choose you. Choose peace.\n\n8. You won't get everything your heart desires.\n\nPexels\n\nSometimes you can work your ass off for something and you still might not get it. Life is unfair but you can't let it get to you. Continue working hard towards your goals because when life does give you what you want, nothing comes close to describing that euphoric, oh-so-amazing feeling.\n\n9. Worrying doesn't make tomorrow's problems vanish.\n\nPexels\n\nBesides inflicting physical damage to your body, unwanted worrying and stress also takes away your peace. So stop and just breathe. If something is not in your control, just walk away.\n\n10. Know your worth.\n\nPexels\n\nUnderstand your worth. Because that will help you filter out people who belittle you.\n\n11. Just live, you don't need to figure out life all the time.\n\nPexels\n\nDo yourself a favour and stop figuring out all the time where you will be in the next 5 or 10 years. Do you realise the kind of stress you put yourself through when you do that? The energy that entails? Develop a list of goals and work towards them. But please don't stop living. Go on that vacation. Spend time with your mom. Gift your dad whatever he wants. Just be content and live.", "description": "It's not money, not owning fancy cars or living in a mansion.
