Intelligence officials were able to scope out his exact location two weeks ago, and Trump was made aware of the planned raid at the end of last week.\n\nMoments after a team including the US president gathered in the White House situation room at about 5pm ET (11pm in Syria) on Saturday, eight helicopters \u2013 mostly twin-rotor CH-47s \u2013 took off from an airbase in northern Iraq.\n\nUS officials have not confirmed exactly where the aircraft took off from, but most reports say it was Erbil. The aircraft apparently flew over Turkey and territory controlled by the Russian military.\n\nThey reached their intended target, a small compound outside the village of Barisha, in Idlib province, Syria, three miles (5km) south of the Turkish border, about an hour and 10 minutes after takeoff. The on-the-ground operation was supported by military aircraft and ships, Trump said. The operatives \u2013 commandos with the Delta Force \u2013 brought with them military dogs and a military robot.\n\nVillagers in Barisha said there was shooting from helicopters for 30 minutes before troops became active on the ground. They said the helicopters fired missiles at two houses, flattening one.\n\nBelieving the main compound door to be booby-trapped, the soldiers entered by blasting through the wall.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest People walk on rubble at the site of the US raid.

He ignited his suicide vest, killing himself and his children and causing the tunnel to collapse, according to Trump. The dog was injured and retrieved by the commandos.\n\nTo get to his remains, troops had to dig through debris. Lab technicians conducted an on-site DNA test and within 15 minutes of his death, they positively identified him.\n\nTrump said US troops remained in the compound for about two hours after Baghdadi\u2019s death and recovered highly sensitive material about Islamic State, including information about its future plans.\n\nAfter the troops retreated, US fighter jets fired six rockets at the house, levelling it.\n\nDrone footage Footage courtesy of Anadolu Agency\n\nJust before 3.30am Syrian time, the fleet of choppers took off for the return journey to Iraq.\n\nThe US national security adviser, Robert O\u2019Brien, said Baghdadi\u2019s remains would probably be disposed of at sea.", "description": "Baghdadi died in a US raid on a compound near the village of Barisha in north-west Syria", "authors": ["Glenn Swann", "Finbarr Sheehy", "Cath Levett"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ba2dd69b18381282be9572b257525eae0c29919/0_529_4056_2435/master/4056.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d5442f812b2805e58397f0d63a2dc88c", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
