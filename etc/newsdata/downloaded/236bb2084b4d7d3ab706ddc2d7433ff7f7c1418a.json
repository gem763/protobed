And at the close of play, after the lowest score of what has been astonishing Ashes series from the right-handed run machine, the mystery was solved.\n\nSmith, who finally missed a straight one to fall leg-before to Chris Woakes for 80 in the evening session, revealed that he had been dosed up on cold remedies all day. \u201cI\u2019ve been struggling a little bit. I\u2019ve got a little bit of the flu,\u201d he said.\n\nJofra Archer\u2019s six wickets put England on top despite Steve Smith\u2019s resistance Read more\n\nArcher, fresh from his second six-wicket haul in only his fourth Test match for England, had noted a difference in how Smith looked at the crease, saying: \u201cIt might just be my perception of it but he didn\u2019t look as nailed on as he usually is.\u201d When Smith\u2019s bout of the sniffles was then put to him, the fast bowler replied: \u201cI knew there was something!\u201d\n\nThe pair have been locked in an absorbing duel this summer, one which Smith can claim to have had the better of ever since bouncing back from the concussion suffered at Lord\u2019s when struck on the neck by a 92mph Archer short-ball.\n\nThe Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\n\nHaving missed the defeat in Headingley due to the after-effects of that blow, Smith has responded with 373 runs in three innings. In total he has batted just shy of 31 hours this series and now has 10 consecutive scores of 50 or more against English bowlers in Test cricket \u2013 a record by any batsman against one opponent.\n\nIndeed the wicket conjured up by Woakes could almost be considered the first time England have truly got the 30-year-old out this summer. Smith\u2019s five previous dismissals came when either chasing fast runs or the lbw at Lord\u2019s, padding up to Woakes on 92, while still dazed from Archer\u2019s thunderbolt.\n\nSam Curran gives England a snarl they have lacked in Ashes summer of Steve | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nArcher said: \u201cIt\u2019s weird, you know. Every time he bats, I don\u2019t know what it is. He literally cannot get out. If he plays a bad shot, the ball lands in no man\u2019s and. For the whole series. Obviously he\u2019s a good batter, he\u2019s got a good temperament, but I don\u2019t know what it is: the ball never ever goes to hand.\n\n\u201cWe know he\u2019s going to miss one, though, and today just proves it. Funnily enough, the last person he missed one off was Woakes [at Lord\u2019s].\u201d\n\nAs was the case following his six for 45 at Headingley, Archer was mostly relieved to be off the field. And then doubly so when Rory Burns, whose stunning catch to remove Peter Siddle at gully wrapped up the innings, overturned an lbw decision off the last ball of the day to see England head into day three with a lead of 78 runs and 10 wickets in hand.\n\nOn the Burns catch, Archer added: \u201cWhen I saw him hit the ball, I thought it was four. It was a special catch. I don\u2019t think you should underestimate how good the catch is, especially given the position it\u2019s put us in. Although the Ashes are lost, we\u2019ve still got a lot to play for \u2013 the World Test Championship and our own games. It would mean a lot for the team to win here.\u201d", "description": "Jofra Archer had a feeling something was not right with Steve Smith on day two at the Oval and it turned out to be flu with the Australian dosed up with cold remedies for a mere 80", "authors": ["Ali Martin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/452f5987d67dd52d03e9d6f4638eed730272a3ab/0_1036_2223_1333/master/2223.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c8a643118ec044a762e8411cf11f17ef", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
