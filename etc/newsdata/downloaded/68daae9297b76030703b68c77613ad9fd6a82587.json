Hong Kong international airport on August 14 AP\n\nPolice with anti-riot helmets and shields responded by firing tear gas.\n\nIn the evening, protesters gathered at a shopping mall in another district, Yuen Long. More home-made incendiary devices were thrown in the street but there was no indication anyone was injured.\n\nElsewhere, scuffles were reported as government supporters heeded a call by a pro-Beijing member of the Hong Kong legislature to tear down protest posters at subway stations.\n\nThe events are an embarrassment for China\u2018s Communist Party ahead of 1 October celebrations of its 70th anniversary in power. Hong Kong\u2019s government has cancelled a fireworks display that day, citing concern for public safety.\n\nThe protesters in Tuen Mun marched about 2 kilometres from a playground to a government office building. Many were dressed in black and carried umbrellas, a symbol of their movement.\n\nProtesters chanted, \u201cReclaim Hong Kong!\u201d and \u201cRevolution of our times!\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Protesters also set up barricades to block traffic.\n\nA government statement said protesters caused unspecified damage to the Tuen Mun light rail station and threw objects onto the tracks.\n\nAn organiser quoted by government broadcaster RTHK criticised police for sending armed anti-riot officers.\n\nThat will \u201conly escalate tension between protesters and police,\u201d the organiser, Michael Mo, was quoted as saying.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, has agreed to withdraw the extradition bill. But protesters are pressing other demands, including an independent investigation of complaints about police violence during earlier demonstrations.\n\nProtesters complain Beijing and Ms Lam\u2019s government are eroding the \u201chigh degree of autonomy\u201d and Western-style civil liberties promised to the former British colony when it was returned to China in 1997.\n\nThe protests have begun to weigh on Hong Kong\u2019s economy, which already was slowing due to cooling global consumer demand. The Hong Kong airport said passenger traffic fell in August. Business is off at hotels and retailers.\n\nPolice refused permission for Saturday\u2019s march but an appeal tribunal agreed to allow a two-hour event.\n\nProtesters in Tuen Mun also complained about a group of women from mainland China who sing in a local park. Residents say they are too loud and accuse some of asking for money or engaging in prostitution.\n\nThose complaints prompted a similar march in July, highlighting tension between Hong Kong residents and migrants from mainland China.\n\nLater on Saturday, protesters gathered at a mall in Yuen Long, the location where men with sticks had beaten protesters and subway passengers on July 21 in an incident that caused controversy in Hong Kong.\n\nSome protesters threw petrol bombs on the street outside the Yoho Mall but there was no indication anyone was injured. Others started small fires in the street.\n\nAlso on Saturday, there were brief scuffles as government supporters tore down protest posters at several subway stops, according to RTHK.\n\nThat campaign was initiated by a pro-Beijing member of Hong Kong\u2019s legislature, Junius Ho.\n\nNear the subway station in the Tsuen Wan neighborhood, a woman who was tearing down posters threw a bag at a reporter and a man shoved a cameraman, RTHK reported. It said there was pushing and shoving between the two sides at stations in Yuen Long and Lok Fu.\n\nMr Ho made an appearance in the Shau Kei Wan neighbourhood but residents shouted at him and told him to leave, RTHK said.\n\nMr Ho initially called for protest signs to be torn down in all 18 of Hong Kong\u2019s districts but he said Friday that would be reduced to clearing up trash from streets due to \u201csafety concerns.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, the Hong Kong Jockey Club cancelled a horse race after some protesters suggested targeting the club because a horse owned by Ho was due to run.\n\nMeanwhile, the Hong Kong airport announced restrictions on access on Sunday following what it said were calls to disrupt traffic there.\n\nAdditional reporting by AP", "description": "Pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong turned violent on Saturday after demonstrators threw Molotov cocktails and police fired teargas.
