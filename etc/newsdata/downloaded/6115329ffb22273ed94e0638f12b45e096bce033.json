USA TODAY\n\nHOUSTON \u2014 October is down to its final days, and the experimenters have gone home. The workarounds have collapsed, and the only teams still playing baseball are those built on a foundation that has ruled the game for decades.\n\nTuesday, the Washington Nationals and Houston Astros will begin the 115th World Series secure in the knowledge that the majority of their pitches will be thrown by the greatest arms in the game. The methods that can carry a team through 162 games \u2013 the \u201cOpener\u201d strategy, the commitment to short starts or bullpen games \u2013 crumbled this postseason.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Rays? Sure, they pushed the Astros to a five-game test in the AL Division Series, but they\u2019re golfing.\n\nThe New York Yankees? Their relievers were admittedly gassed after absorbing one too many brief outings from James Paxton and couldn\u2019t pull off a do-or-die bullpen game, succumbing to Houston in a six-game ALCS.\n\nWORLD SERIES PREDICTIONS: Astros are heavy favorites over Nationals\n\nWORLD SERIES: History not on Washington's side with long layoff\n\nNATIONALS: D.C. is loving its baseball team\n\nEven the mighty, 106-win Los Angeles Dodgers were felled by a roster that was one starter short of a full deck, as they let the Nationals up for air in their NLDS with a Game 4 dud that turned the fortunes of both franchises.\n\nAnd so in this Fall Classic, the itinerant starter that has become the scourge of Major League Baseball \u2013 he answers to \u201cTBA\u201d \u2013 will make at most one appearance, for the Astros in Game 4. And even then, they may opt to deploy rookie Jose Urquidy in a conventional manner and have him start the game.\n\nOtherwise, it\u2019s aces galore in what on paper looks to be a delight for pitching aficionados as the Astros aim for their second in three years and the Nationals their first in franchise history.\n\n\"If you want to do well against the Nationals,\" Astros manager A.J. Hinch said Monday, \"you have to beat their starters.\"\n\nBreaking down what should be a tightly-contested World Series:\n\nFor starters\n\nProjected rotations\n\nGame 1: RHP Max Scherzer (11-7, 2.92 ERA) vs. RHP Gerrit Cole (20-5, 2.50 ERA)\n\nGame 2: RHP Stephen Strasburg (18-6, 3.32) vs. RHP Justin Verlander (21-6, 2.58)\n\nGame 3: LHP Patrick Corbin (14-7, 3.25) vs. RHP Zack Greinke (18-5, 2.93)\n\nGame 4: RHP Anibal Sanchez (11-8, 3.85 ERA) vs. RHP Brad Peacock (7-6, 4.12)\n\nIn a series featuring three former Cy Young winners and at least five hurlers who should receive votes in this year\u2019s balloting, Cole looms above them all. Nobody was more dominant this season \u2013 Cole struck out 326 in 212 \u2153 innings \u2013 and perhaps most significant, no starter in this series has been so unblemished in the postseason.\n\nCole carried the Astros out of danger in the ALDS, beating Tampa Bay in Games 1 and 5, and also bulled past the Yankees in ALCS Game 3. He\u2019s given up just one earned run in 22 \u2154 innings overall \u2013 a 0.40 ERA. All the other highly decorated hurlers have gotten clipped at least once:\n\nA four-run first inning toppled Verlander in ALCS Game 5, and the Rays also blitzed him for four runs in an ALDS start on three days\u2019 rest.\n\nGreinke was ambushed by Tampa Bay for six runs in ALDS Game 3.\n\nScherzer gave up three runs in the first two innings of the NL wild-card game.\n\nStrasburg\u2019s career postseason ERA is now 1.10 \u2013 but he departed NLDS Game 5 facing a 3-1 deficit.\n\nCorbin walked five in NLDS Game 1 and gave up six runs in a Game 3 relief appearance.\n\nSo there\u2019s only one truly invulnerable arm in this Series, and that makes the Astros\u2019 walk-off win in ALCS Game 6 all the more significant \u2013 Cole will start Game 1 and Game 5, at least, rather than a Game 7 ALCS start limiting him to perhaps one outing in this battle.\n\nShould he win both outings \u2013 and thus neutralize Scherzer \u2013 the Nationals will have to go 4-1 against everybody else. It\u2019s a perilous, but navigable path, almost certainly requiring two outcomes: Strasburg continuing his playoff dominance and besting Verlander in Game 2, and Sanchez continuing his stellar postseason (one earned run, five hits in 12 \u2154 innings) by beating Peacock, Urquidy and a cast of many in Game 4.\n\nA view of Minute Maid Park before workouts on Monday. (Photo: Erik Williams, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nCheckers and chess\n\nHinch\u2019s ploy to go for the kill with Verlander on short rest backfired in the ALDS. In this series, both managers face interesting Game 4 choices should they be the one down 2-1 (or worse yet, 3-0).\n\nWould Hinch start Cole on three days\u2019 rest rather than risk a possible bullpen game? Would Martinez do the same with Scherzer even though Sanchez has been stellar?\n\nThe Nationals\u2019 NLCS sweep of punchless St. Louis took care of a big headache for Martinez \u2013 he never had to use a starter in relief, and barely had to dip into his trough of relievers. Ninety-nine of the 108 outs were recorded by their four starters and top relievers Sean Doolittle and Daniel Hudson.\n\nWashington probably won\u2019t be so fortunate this time, with a potentially long season and a potent Houston lineup. Rookie right-hander Tanner Rainey has eased into Martinez\u2019s October circle of trust by retiring 15 of 18 batters faced and stealing some crucial outs against the Dodgers and Cardinals.\n\nHow quickly will Martinez go to Rainey and, less optimally, Fernando Rodney if a starter is struggling? Can he beat Houston with, essentially, a seven-man staff?\n\nHinch has fewer such problems, and even if he opts for a bullpen night in Game 4, knows Cole is waiting to reset the squad in Game 5. He\u2019ll draw comfort from Will Harris\u2019 postseason performance \u2013 the set-up man is unscored upon In 5 \u2154 innings \u2013 but will fireman Ryan Pressly\u2019s balky knee hold up? Can long man Josh James improve on a shaky ALCS in which he allowed six of his last 12 batters faced to reach base?\n\nNot much can keep Hinch up at night, but the middle innings on nights Greinke or Urquidy start is worth fretting over.\n\nKeep an eye on\n\nJuan Soto: He\u2019ll turn 21 the night of Game 3, but in lieu of gifts, he and the Nationals hope the prodigy can regain his stroke at the plate. In less than two years in the majors, Soto has shown a knack for adjusting when even the briefest slumps occur. The Cardinals pitched him very tough, striking him out seven times in 16 at-bats and holding him to just one extra-base hit. Washington has enjoyed epic production from Nos. 4-5 hitters Anthony Rendon and Howie Kendrick (a combined 23 hits this postseason), but the going\u2019s about to get tougher. They will need a productive Soto to keep the middle of the order cooking.\n\nGeorge Springer: He was held to four hits in 25 ALCS at-bats, but this is October, and Springer always equals damage. He homered in Astros victories in Games 1 and 3, the latter a go-ahead third-inning shot. Springer has an .894 OPS in 43 career playoff games, and the Astros are 9-3 when he goes deep.\n\nIn the end\n\nIt has been an epic run for the Nationals \u2013 an absurd 82-40 record since their well-documented 19-31 skid to start the season. It seems almost foolish to side against a club that is playing so well and, at this point, demoralizing opponents.\n\nBut the Astros are no ordinary foe. While the Nationals have leaned on a veteran core that\u2019s the oldest in the majors, Houston combines the seasoning of three deep playoff runs with a squad that remains in its physical prime. They dispatched an excellent Yankees team in six games despite batting just .179.\n\n\"Altuve, and Gerrit and Will Harris are the only three who have played outstanding this postseason,\" said third baseman Alex Bregman, who batted .167 against the Yankees. \"I think our best baseball is yet to be played.\"\n\nThese Nationals have holes \u2013 namely, that bullpen that only received a partial fix at the trade deadline \u2013 but they just vanquished a squad that was incapable of exposing them. Houston\u2019s deep lineup, potentially dominant rotation and good-enough bullpen will provide a test the Nationals can\u2019t quite pass.\n\nPrediction: Astros in 5.", "description": "It's the 115th edition of Major League Baseball's World Series, with the Houston Astros and Washington Nationals facing off in a best-of-seven set.", "authors": ["Gabe Lacques", "Published A.M.
