Don Bacon, one of 29 co-sponsors of the sanctions legislation, said Turkey should be held responsible for \u201ctheir malicious actions\u201d against the Kurds.\n\n\u201cThe Kurds have spilled their blood alongside ours for the last 16 years and we absolutely can\u2019t abandon them now,\u201d he said.\n\nCheney\u2019s announcement came a day after a similar bipartisan bill was introduced by Sens. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., and Lindsey Graham, R-Wyo., that would freeze all U.S. assets of Turkey\u2019s political leadership and bar the United States for selling the country military equipment or technology.\n\nTrump responded to the criticism Thursday on Twitter, saying he has been talking to both sides in order to end the war.\n\n\u201cI am trying to end the ENDLESS WARS,\u201d he said.", "description": "Oct. 11 (UPI) \u2014 Nearly 30 Republican House representatives have co-sponsored legislation to impose sanctions against Turkey for its military", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
