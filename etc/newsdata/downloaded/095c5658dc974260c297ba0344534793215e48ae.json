But the danger is the Taliban will play for time while the drawdown goes on. They can delay, prevaricate, while our troops are dwindling, and then just fire up the military campaign again.\"\n\nTrump's top Afghanistan negotiator, Zalmay Khalilzad, has had to \"negotiate with one hand behind his back and given the Taliban an incentive to delay and harden their demands to see if they can get what they want for free\" because of Trump's public impatience with the Afghanistan conflict, Kolenda said.\n\nThe Afghanistan war enters its 19th year and the US struggles to prop up the central government as the Taliban gains ground. The Global Peace Index recently rated it the most dangerous country in the world,\n\nTrump sees himself as a master negotiator, but his penchant for making rash national security proclamations, sometimes via tweet, also has some officials on edge; Trump's declaration that the US would pull troops out of Syria caused Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Syria envoy Brett McGurk to leave the administration, and contributed to the resurgence of the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.\n\nDuring his Syria tweetstorm, and just after he had named Khalilzad his top envoy, Trump also said that he wanted half of all US troops to leave Afghanistan. He was eventually talked down from that decision by Sens. Lindsey Graham and Mitch McConnell, but at the time, defense officials were in a tailspin, Politico reports.\n\n\"The president said, 'Let's do this,' and nobody was ready for that,\" a former defense official told Politico. \"That caused quite a bit of consternation. The State Department was looking to [the Pentagon] like, 'What is this drawdown,' and we were like, 'Uhhh?'\"\n\n\"The timing couldn't have been worse. It was severely damaging,\" said another military official who had recently been in Afghanistan. \"We've probably gone double the rounds [of negotiations] because the Taliban were like, 'Hey, you're leaving anyway. Why should we negotiate?'\"\n\nTrump's team continues to say the negotiations are moving along smoothly. After Khalilzad briefed Trump and his national security team in a closed-door meeting at Trump's Bedminster, New Jersey golf course, Trump tweeted: \"Just completed a very good meeting on Afghanistan. Many on the opposite side of this 19 year war, and us, are looking to make a deal - if possible!\"\n\nBut without knowing the substance of the negotiations, it's impossible to tell what the outcome might be. Without the bargaining chip of US military power, the end of US involvement in Afghanistan is unlikely to look anything like peace.", "description": "Trump sees himself as a powerful negotiator, but in Afghanistan his desire to withdraw forces his negotiator to work with \"one hand behind his back.\"", "authors": ["Ellen Ioanes"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5cbb19b4207d46541d5e4e62-960-480.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-19"}
