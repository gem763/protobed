There should now be no doubt in anyone\u2019s mind that this policy works.\n\n\u201cControlling the disease in wildlife is a crucial element to tackling this devastating disease, alongside a range of measures such as enhanced biosecurity and strengthening cattle movement controls.\n\n\u201cWhen this strategy began, opponents to it cited estimates that wildlife control would only deliver reductions of 16% in TB outbreaks in cattle, at best. It is clear from this peer-reviewed evidence that they were wrong.", "description": "The badger cull has cut tuberculosis rates in cattle by up to 66 per cent, a new peer-reviewed study has shown, as farmers celebrated the news.", "authors": ["Helena Horton"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/08/23/TELEMMGLPICT000022182148-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq3LWUGqiHWvaGajKvH-vRlH2n8B2PueWIsxIYQ6ADe-Q.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
