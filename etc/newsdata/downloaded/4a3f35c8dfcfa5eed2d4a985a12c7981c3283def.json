Thanks to all of you for making this possible.\"\n\nIf the woman is found guilty, she could face up to a year in jail and a 1,700 (about \u00a31,500) fine.\n\nShe is expected to give evidence during the trial, which is listed for three days this week.\n\nHuman rights and feminist groups last week urged Cyprus's attorney general to dismiss the case and her legal team will ask Judge Michalis Papathanasiou to exclude her retraction statement.\n\nShe maintains she was raped by members of the Israeli group and her lawyers say police exerted pressure by threatening her and her friends with arrest when she was interrogated without a lawyer until 2am.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nAt a hearing earlier this month the court heard one of the Israelis had told police in a statement the group had earlier talked about having sex with her in a \"very bad and aggressive way\".\n\nMichael Polak, director of the group Justice Abroad, has previously said the teenager, who missed out on her place at university, has been diagnosed with PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder).", "description": "The 19-year-old woman faces prison after allegedly making false allegations that she was raped in an hotel room in Cyprus on July 17", "authors": ["Neil Murphy", "Image", "Afp Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20582396.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_CYPRUS-BRITAIN-ISRAEL-CRIME.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
