But on Saturday, in Scotland's county Fife, people from the community gathered at a beach to remember her \u2014 and plan to try to right that historical wrong.\n\nIt's believed Adie was buried on the beach under a large stone slab so that she couldn't rise from the grave.\n\nBut eventually, Adie's remains went missing. And now, officials have launched a campaign to find them.\n\nAs It Happens host Carol Off spoke to county Fife archaeologist Douglas Speirs about Adie and plans to give her a reburial if her remains are found.\n\nHere is part of their conversation.\n\nDouglas, how hopeful are you that the remains of this woman, Lilias Adie, can actually be found?\n\nI'm actually quite confident.\n\nCertainly, I think the skull is probably in a museum collection, but it's just been misplaced or mislabeled.\n\nI think it's very likely that her other bones \u2014 her ribs, and femur, and so on, and leg bones \u2014 are probably hidden away in lofts, and so on, in houses in Fife. The owners just don't appreciate their significance or history.\n\nArchaeologist Douglas Speirs removing seaweed from what is believed to be the slab of stone that sat atop Lilias Adies' grave. (Fife Council)\n\nBut why were the bones taken in the first place?\n\nThe grave was opened in 1852 at the request of a local antiquarian. This chap, Joseph Neil Paton, was a great collector of antiquarian items and Scottish curios and features and facets of Scottish history.\n\nBut he was also a very keen phrenologist. He believed strongly in the emerging science, as it was considered then, that you could infer much about an individual's character and their traits from the study of their skull.\n\nSo he was very keen to obtain this skull of a known witch, so that's why it was opened.\n\nWhat do we actually know about Lilias Adie and how she came to be accused of being a witch?\n\nEssentially, all we know of her is contained in the court session minutes for the period July 1704 to September 1704.\n\nIn these minutes, it's recorded that a couple of local village women fell ill with some kind of summer illness. They accused Lilias of causing that malady through witchcraft.\n\nShe was taken into custody. She was maltreated. She confessed to a whole range of things.\n\nAs part of these confessions, we can infer a number of things about her. She was probably in her late 50s, 60s, or possibly, even her 70s.\n\nShe does not appear to have been married, or if she was married, she was a widow by this time.\n\nShe appears to have been a vulnerable individual, very lowly status, of the labouring landed class, at this time. So she was a very minor player, a small time individual in a little and otherwise unknown hamlet.\n\nAn image of Lilias Adie's skull, taken in 1904 when the skull was in the St. Andrews University anatomy collection. (Fife Council)\n\nShe confessed to being a witch, presumably after being tortured to do so. What does the record say that she actually confessed to?\n\nThe records are quite lengthy because over the period of about a month, 29 days which she was actually incarcerated, she was interrogated seven times, and paraded in church to confess twice. And minutes were made of these confessions.\n\nEssentially, the main accusations against her were that she had caused the illness of two individuals.\n\nBut [in] the confessions, which were extracted from her principally through sleep deprivation, she confessed a wide range of things.\n\nShe was in cahoots with the devil. She confessed to having renounced her Christian baptism, having gone through a Satanic ritual of baptism, having had sex and carnal relations with the devil on many occasions. She describes his black, swarthy skin, his cloven feet, and his hat and so on.\n\nBut there's no real substance in terms of the accusations of her doing anything bad or anything, other than her cohorts, essentially, with the devil.\n\nSpeirs says a heavy slab of stone was placed on top of Adie's grave because people genuinely believed she would rise out of her grave. (Fife Council)\n\nThe tradition was to burn so-called witches at the stake. How did Lilias Adie die?\n\nWe're not exactly sure how she died. The last entry of the court session minutes talks about her a few hours before her death \u2014 that she was weak and that her eyes were fading and so on. So we believe she simply passed away after that.\n\nRelatively quickly, within three days, she was buried in the intertidal zone, on the shore nearby, in a most elaborate revenant burial ceremony.\n\nShe was taken out at low tide. Her body was locked in a makeshift wooden chest. It was buried and on top of this was placed a large, heavy sandstone slab. And these were all attempts to stop her rising from the grave.\n\nThey were genuinely worried about the real prospect of her physically pushing her way out of the box, pushing up through the mud, pushing the stone off and actually rising from the grave in a very real and physical sense.\n\nGood Heavens. Of course, Lilias Adies was not the only woman who was accused of being witch. There are thousands of them in Scotland, right?\n\nThe preservation of written records in Scotland isn't terribly good. We have big gaps in all of our records.\n\nBut if we collate the known records, we have actual real written evidence for about 3,600 accusations or cases of witchcraft. We can definitely see of those 3,600 cases about 1,400 led to executions.\n\nBut what we can't say is how many are not represented in the missing records or how many led to executions where we know that there was an accusation but we don't have the records telling us what the outcome of the case was.\n\nMembers of the local community at a wreath-making workshop for Lilias Adie. The wreaths were made to lay at her grave. (Fife Council)\n\nBut in this case, having a grave makes Lilias Adies somewhat unique. So what are the plans if you're able to recover her remains? What will the county do with them?\n\nIt is very unique, as you say, because the vast majority of witches were strangled, garroted, and then burned, and then they were unceremoniously buried next to the fire pit.\n\nWe knew of very few real authenticated graves of witches so that really does make Lilias' grave stand out.\n\nThe plans for the return of her bones are under consideration.\n\nIf they are secured then it's likely, or the hope is from the local community, that they will be reburied in the local parish cemetery and given the dignity that she never received in life.\n\nWritten by Katie Geleff and John McGill.
