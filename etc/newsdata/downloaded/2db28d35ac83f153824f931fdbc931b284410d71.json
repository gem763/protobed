Therefore, evolution has left us with a brain that can reward itself; satisfying curiosity feels pleasurable, so you explore the environment even when you don\u2019t expect any concrete payoff. Infants prefer to look at novel pictures compared with familiar ones. Preschoolers play longer with a mechanical toy if it\u2019s difficult to deduce how it works.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, curiosity doesn\u2019t just ensure new opportunities for learning, it enhances learning itself. In a recent experiment, subjects read trivia questions and rated how curious each made them feel. Later, they saw the questions again, each followed by a photograph of a face, and judged whether that person looked like he or she would know the answer. In a surprise final memory test for the faces, subjects better remembered those appearing after trivia questions that made them curious. Curiosity causes a brain state that amplifies learning.\n\nThis function of curiosity \u2014 to heighten memory \u2014 is the key to understanding why we\u2019re curious about some things and not others. We feel most curious when exploration will yield the most learning.\n\nSuppose I ask you, \u201cWhat\u2019s the most common type of star in the Milky Way?\u201d You\u2019ll obviously feel no curiosity if you already know the answer. But you\u2019ll also feel little interest if you know nothing about stars; if you learned the answer, you couldn\u2019t connect it to other knowledge, so it would seem nearly meaningless, an isolated factoid. We\u2019re maximally curious when we sense that the environment offers new information in the right proportion to complement what we already know.\n\nNote that your brain calculates what you might learn in the short term \u2014 your long-term interests aren\u2019t a factor. That\u2019s why a cardiac surgeon who is passionate about her job will nevertheless find a conference presentation on the subject boring if her brain decides that the talk won\u2019t add to her knowledge. Conversely, when a friend persuades her to watch a documentary on type fonts, her brain may calculate that this will be a rich source of information \u2014 and she finds herself fascinated.", "description": "You\u2019ve been clickbaited by your own brain.", "authors": ["Daniel T.
