Yet they are also aware that at some point they will have to stop using that tool as stimulus for fear of hitting the so-called reversal rate, at which cheap money turns contractionary.\n\nThe new Bloomberg survey of economists suggests the Fed and Bank of England, both of whom have signaled opposition to negative rates, would only reduce their benchmarks to zero from a range of 1.75% to 2% and 0.75% respectively now.\n\nBy contrast, the ECB should be able to drop its deposit rate to as low as minus 0.8% from the current minus 0.5%, and the Bank of Japan could lower its key rate to minus 0.35% from minus 0.1%, according to the poll\u2019s median estimates.\n\nThe findings suggest monetary policy can still be loosened before being fully exhausted, which is welcome news in a world economy beset by trade tensions and where manufacturing is already in recession. They nevertheless also signal central banks have less firepower than historically -- which may alarm investors and underscore calls for governments to do more if the current slowdown endures.\n\n\u201cCurrently, it seems that the ECB and Bank of Japan have the will to press interest rates lower in the event of an economic downturn,\u201d said Timo Hirvonen, chief economist at FIM Group OYJ in Helsinki. \u201cThe Fed and Bank of England do not see negative interest rates as an option.\u201d\n\nMarkus Brunnermeier and Yann Koby of Princeton University popularized the idea of a reversal rate in a study which argued that at some point, accommodative monetary policy turns contractionary because banks cease lending amid concerns about their equity positions or the need to satisfy capital regulations. Some banks, especially those in Europe, have begun arguing against negative rates.\n\nWhat Bloomberg\u2019s Economists Say...\n\n\u201cAll of the debate, uncertainty, and complexity around the lower bound for rates obscures a simple truth -- somewhere not too far from zero, the cost of cuts starts to outweigh the benefits. Some major central banks are already there. If the next downturn comes sooner than we think, others won\u2019t be far behind.\u201d\n\n-- Tom Orlik\n\nAnother reason to suspect there\u2019s a floor for rates is the suspicion that the lower benchmarks go, the more people will raise savings in order to protect their retirement. Some policy makers have also argued there\u2019s the risk that rock-bottom rates will inflate asset bubbles or damage productivity.\n\n\u201cNegative rates have diminishing marginal returns in terms of expectations for inflation and incentivizing investment and spending,\u201d said Constance Hunter, chief economist at KPMG LLP.\n\nThe Fed has already cut its benchmark twice this year, with policy makers led by Chairman Jerome Powell leaning towards acting again. But Powell said last month that negative rates were not \u201cat the top of our list\u201d of tools. Such a policy may be deemed illegal in the U.S. and it\u2019s also unclear how much of an economic gain it would yield given the likely disruption it could cause to banks and money market funds.\n\n\u2018Something Unnatural\u2019\n\nThe BOE is also adverse to negative rates, even as the risk mounts of the U.K. leaving the European Union without a divorce deal. Governor Mark Carney has ruled out going below zero, arguing there is \u201csomething unnatural\u201d about doing so as it could hurt the margins, profitability and capitalization of banks, and thus their willingness to lend.\n\nThe euro area and Japan have already gone negative. The ECB last cut its rate on banks\u2019 overnight deposits on Sept. 12 and President Mario Draghi has signaled that\u2019s not necessarily the floor. Officials argue that what lenders lose on profit margins they more than recoup on volume, as low rates boost demand for credit.\n\nWhile the BOJ has indicated greater willingness to ramp up its easing measures, it\u2019s also wary of the side effects on commercial banks and markets of its massive easing program.\n\nIn a survey published this week by the Bank for International Settlements, central bankers said sub-zero rates and asset purchases had helped growth and inflation, and that the positives outweighed the negatives.", "description": "Central Banks Are Nearing \u2018Reversal Rates\u2019\u00a0as Global Growth Slows", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic9e4480f4f6d3103a41f064436eee3390.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
