Spending with Microsoft at the Brazilian government between 2012 and 2018 has reached 1 billion reais ($246 million) and the objective is to reduce that by at least 35 percent.\n\nThe approach should be replicated with other major technology providers that do business with the Brazilian government, which include IBM, Oracle, Red Hat and VMware.\n\nAccording to the SGD, the main goal is to achieve savings, but also standardize and simplify the procurement process for central government.\n\nThe prices will be set either via agreements with the vendors, or unilaterally by the government. The amounts were defined according to the lowest price paid between 2017 and 2019 for each of the services listed.\n\nAccording to the SDG, the other large suppliers will be called in to discuss their new prices for the government before the end of 2019.\n\nThis follows the approach adopted by other countries such as Australia, where limits to the value of IT contracts has been enforced since 2017. Contract lengths have also been shortened, with aims including the ability to bring in innovative technology and services earlier.", "description": "The new rules for central government bodies aim to achieve savings of 35 percent and will be replicated for other vendors such as Oracle and IBM.", "authors": ["Angelica Mari"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/04/8396df91-c760-40cf-9bba-9cb0cf3be119/thumbnail/770x578/3cd60c7c8c51e9df669d61ca1941f4f7/signing-contract.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
