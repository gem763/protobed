'It's about protection through combining two systems, the government and Anangu.\n\n'This decision is for both Anangu and non-Anangu together to feel proud about; to realise, of course it's the right thing to close it.\n\n'The land has law and culture. We welcome tourists here. Closing the climb is not something to feel upset about but a cause for celebration. Let's come together, let's close it together.\n\n'If I travel to another country and there is a sacred site, an area of restricted access, I don't enter or climb it, I respect it. It is the same here for Anangu. We welcome tourists here. We are not stopping tourism, just this activity.'\n\nSince July thousands of tourists have been making the pilgrimage to central Australia.", "description": "The picture, taken by a Japanese tour guide, shows a\u00a0crowd gatherting at Uluru.Thousands of people are rushing to climb the rock before the practice is banned on October 26.", "authors": ["Alana Mazzoni For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/22/19512398-0-image-a-5_1570656411006.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
