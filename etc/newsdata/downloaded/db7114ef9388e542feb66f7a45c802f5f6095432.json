What I\u2019m saying is bad things happen to everyone, and this week, one bad thing in particular happened to all of us.\n\nNoah Centineo bleached his beard.\n\nYes, the To All the Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before star dyed his beard a light, fleshy blond, so from afar you\u2019re like, Is that a beard, or is his skin really dehydrated?\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t bleach my beard, that would be ridiculous. Why would I do that?\u201d Centineo, 23, said in his Instagram Story over the weekend, laughing and sporting a decidedly bleached beard and tagging colorist Shah Karegar.\n\nHe would do it, presumably, either to prepare for an upcoming movie role (in the as-yet-unannounced Spencer Pratt biopic, perhaps) or to punish modern society for its multitude of sins.\n\nDo you repent yet?\n\nTo be clear, even with a blond beard, Centineo is better looking than any person I\u2019ve ever seen in real life. But it is still a harsh new reality, one that few are equipped to deal with.\n\nOn Twitter, one fan shared Centineo\u2019s blond-bearded Instagram Story and wrote, \u201cnoah centineo update he just bleached his beard. am actually crying. I am actually considering to stop my fan account.\u201d The person\u2019s display name is now \u201cnot noah centineo updates.\u201d\n\nnoah centineo update he just bleached his beard. am actually crying.
