He has recruited a rare pro-Bolsonaro indigenous voice, Ysani Kalapalo, to travel with him to New York in an effort to soften his notoriety as a rainforest destroyer.\n\nBut in a strongly worded open letter, 16 indigenous leaders from Brazil\u2019s Xingu indigenous park spurned Bolsonaro\u2019s \u201ccolonialist and ethnocidal\u201d programme for their communities, which he has pledged to open for commercial exploitation.\n\nThe leaders claimed the sole interest of Kalapalo \u2013 who recorded a recent video denying Bolsonaro was to blame for the Amazon fires \u2013 was to \u201cinsult and demoralize Brazil\u2019s indigenous leaders and movement\u201d on social media.\n\n\u201cNot content with its attacks on indigenous peoples, the Brazilian government now seeks to legitimize its anti-indigenous policies by using an indigenous figure who sympathizes with its radical ideologies,\u201d they added.\n\nIn a recent article for the Guardian, the Xingu\u2019s best-known leader, Raoni Metuktire, accused Bolsonaro of doing nothing to stop ranchers invading indigenous lands.\n\nBolsonaro\u2019s UN appearance will represent the culmination of a government propaganda drive designed to repair Brazil\u2019s global image and fend off the threat of economic sanctions.\n\n\u201cWe are not the villain of the environment,\u201d Bolsonaro\u2019s environment minister, Ricardo Salles, insisted during an interview in New York.\n\nBrazil environment minister to meet US climate denier group before UN summit Read more\n\nBut observers are awaiting Bolsonaro\u2019s speech \u2013 which one commentator expected to focus on the issues of \u201csovereignty, liberalism, communism/left, Christianity and the Amazon\u201d \u2013 with considerable trepidation.\n\nIn January, Bolsonaro\u2019s unusually brief international debut at the World Economic Forum in Davos was widely panned as well as being overshadowed by a snowballing scandal linking one of his politician sons to Rio gangsters.\n\nWriting in Rio\u2019s O Globo newspaper, the former head of Brazil\u2019s foreign service, Marcos Azambuja, fretted that Bolsonaro\u2019s address would showcase a new-look Brazil that has shocked the world: a place of narrow sectarianism, religious zeal and naive and foolhardy diplomacy.\n\n\u201cI have no advice for whoever is preparing our speech. I\u2019d just like to recall the \u2026 warning once given to two inexperienced hedgehogs about how to make love,\u201d Azambuja wrote. \u201cBe very careful.\u201d", "description": "Open letter decries \u2018colonialist and ethnocidal policies\u2019 ahead of address in which president expected to attack left and foreign critics in New York", "authors": ["Tom Phillips"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab706599eed9206d5cf7eae47495280e2927c23f/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=93d4e9b987f3bba976834273a5f17743", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
