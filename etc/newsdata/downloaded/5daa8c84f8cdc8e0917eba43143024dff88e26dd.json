The artworks were created by world-renowned, local artists i.e. Creative and Brent Comber. The art installations will live permanently at Connaught.\n\nCheryl Hamilton and Michael Vandermeer of i.e. Creative were invited to create a public art piece unique to its permanent location at Connaught. The public art by i.e. Creative, titled \u201cDendrochron\u201d is a 2.74-meter sculpture that encapsulates bronze and stainless-steel elements.\n\nMichael Vandermeer explains, \u201cDendrochron references pre-colonial forests, the local history of industrial logging, and the West Coast modern culture of Edgemont Village. Cheryl Hamilton adding, \u201cOur artwork combines both nature and physics, melding both art and science and we are excited to occupy this space at Connaught to showcase Dendrochron.\u201d\n\nComber, whose works are comprised of locally sourced materials and produced at his local studio, has been sought after by architects, interior designers and high-profile art collectors from all around the world. His artworks that will be on public display at Connaught are titled \u201cShattered Sphere\u201d, as well as \u201cSeaglass\u201d, which is a collection of sculptural benches.\n\n\u201cEach of the pieces explore the use of wood and what connects people to the Pacific Northwest,\u201d says Brent Comber. \u201cI grew up on the North Shore and I am excited to be showcasing work that reflects the natural wonders around us at Connaught. My hope is that the residents and community members will come experience, interact and connect with the artworks\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe recognize and appreciate the important role public art plays and we have a strong desire to make public art more accessible to not only our residents but the broader community,\u201d says Michael Ward, Senior Vice President Development and General Manager, Vancouver of Grosvenor Americas. \u201cIt is our honour to continue our contribution to the local art community to shine light on talented artists like i.e. Creative and Brent Comber.\u201d\n\nThe public art contributions at Connaught complement the collection of public art Grosvenor has curated at their development in the District of West Vancouver, Grosvenor Ambleside.

Brent initially began working with wood as a garden designer in early 1990, creating pieces to compliment his Pacific Rim-inspired gardens. Using solid pieces of wood, Brent found a new take on furniture design that truly integrated with the landscape.\n\nMaterials are sustainably sourced from the surrounding area and milled at his waterfront studio. Through the exploration of materials; wood, stone, glass, resources are taken at their purest form and transformed into objects of recognition, yet the fundamental elements remain. Brent takes care to ensure that every piece retains its story, its relationship with the greater system, and that this story remains visible throughout his body of work.\n\nBrent is the fourth generation of his family to be raised within the Pacific Northwest. Ranging from residential to commercial installations, his aesthetic interpretation of the coast has been recognized both locally and globally, showing as far as Paris, London, Japan, Bora Bora and beyond. Brent continues to explore themes unique to the Pacific Northwest that connect people to this unparalleled setting and the history and dynamism of the landscape.\n\nAbout i.e. Creative\n\nArtists Cheryl Hamilton & Michael Vandermeer form the artistic collaboration that is ie: They believe that art can serve to inspire and provide a moment of celebration and community interaction when placed outside the gallery walls and into public space.\n\n\n\nCheryl and Michael work with themes that involve nature and physics, combining their different backgrounds: art and science respectively. Their differing perspectives are sometimes humorously described as imperial versus metric. This difference allows them to create an exchange about a project right from the beginning. As they continue to generate discussion, they eliminate the ideas that fall short of continued dialogue. This allows them to create artworks that sustain conversation. Their artwork is also a physical intersection between philosophy and craft.\n\n\n\nAs artists that fabricate and install their own work, practicalities such as material choices, production schedules and production techniques are considered from the moment of an idea\u2019s germination. Their pride and focus on production techniques and high-quality craftsmanship lead to results that capture the attention of viewers who may not normally engage in conceptual artwork.\n\nVictoria Levy Account Manager Talk Shop Media D: (604) 738-2220 Victoria@talkshopmedia.com Jordan Prior Director of Project Marketing Grosvenor Americas D: (604) 640-3504 Jordan.Prior@Grosvenor.com", "description": "", "authors": ["Grosvenor Americas"], "top_image": "http://www.globenewswire.com/Attachment/LogoDisplay/830519?filename=830519.jpg&size=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
