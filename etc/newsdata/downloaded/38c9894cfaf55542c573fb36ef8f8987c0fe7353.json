I absolutely love mine. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the fabric. It feels so luxurious that I want to wear it all the time,\" a customer shared.\n\n\"I saw this on Shark Tank a while ago and thought I'd buy this for my daughter (16) because she's always using my Hoodies to keep warm while watching TV or reading. I was really surprised how well made it was and the type of material. Super soft and well worth the money if you want something to lounge around that's comfy,\" another fan wrote.\n\n\n\nTHE COMFY: Original Blanket Sweatshirt, $39.99 (Orig. $44.99)\n\nSelena Gomez is one of \"Shark Tank's\" biggest fans.
