Office equipment and another computer is in front of him.\n\nRegrets \u2014 everyone\u2019s got \u2018em but some have more than others, especially when it comes to their finances. A new survey by Student Loan Hero reveals that 83% of Americans (up 7% from last year\u2019s survey) wished they\u2019d handled their money differently in 2018. Top laments: not saving enough and conspicuous consumption.\n\nGraphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance More\n\nAs far as specific spending items go, 48% of those surveyed think they need to cut back on eating out, and 17% of people who bought a car last year now regret that purchase.\n\nPurchases big and small\n\nThe saying \u201cDon\u2019t sweat the small stuff\u201d does not apply to savings and overspending, according to co-researcher Rebecca Safier. However, that\u2019s precisely what many Americans seem to be doing when it comes to their cash.\n\n\u201cMost people seem to blame small purchases for their lack of savings, but they don\u2019t have as much regret around major purchases like cars or vacations. That\u2019s not to say they should regret big purchases. However, they might not realize that these major expenses could be eating into their savings even more than their restaurant habits.\u201d\n\nLittle white piggy banks standing on top of 7 stacks of coins in ascending order on white surface, green background More\n\nSurprisingly, there was a seemingly low level of regret for incurring student debt. \u201cWith the huge student debt burden, Americans are carrying \u2014 $1.56 trillion among 45 million borrowers \u2014 we might expect to see even more people regretting their student loans. However, it seems the majority of people still think their education was worth the debt they had to take on to get it.\u201d\n\nThe folks at Student Loan Hero told Yahoo Finance that the goal of this study was to show people that they\u2019re not alone in having financial regrets. \u201cIf you reflect on what went right in the past year \u2014 and areas where you could have done better \u2013 you can use this awareness to make better decisions in the year to come.\"\n\nAMS More\n\nReggie Wade is a writer for Yahoo Finance.
