The goal is to stop them from moving profits to lower-tax countries, and to prevent governments from unilaterally imposing their own Big Tech taxes. Two of Canada\u2019s main political parties, however, say the measures don\u2019t go far enough.\n\nIn Canada\u2019s election campaign, three major political parties have proposed measures to tax the tech giants. But the OECD wants to establish a consensus among countries, rather than have them unilaterally impose their own digital taxes. \u201cThe current rules dating back to the 1920s are no longer sufficient to ensure a fair allocation of taxing rights in an increasingly globalised world,\u201d reads the introduction to its proposals.\n\nThe organization\u2019s suggested system would let governments tax a to-be-determined portion of firms\u2019 worldwide earnings, even if they do not have a physical presence in that country. It suggests applying the measure to companies with revenues of more than \u20ac750 million ($1.1 billion) that have a \u201csustained and significant involvement in the economy\u201d of the country levying the tax. It\u2019s also proposing a \u201clegally binding\u201d dispute-resolution mechanism to arbitrate between companies and governments.\n\nCanada\u2019s politicians have proposed taxes that are narrower in scope than the OECD proposals, but similar in intent. They focus on specific kinds of digital-platform revenue, unlike the OECD\u2019s, which are based on firms\u2019 total profits and include sectors other than technology.\n\nIn September, the Liberals promised a three per cent value-added tax on local sales of advertising and user data by firms with annual global revenues of at least $1 billion, of which $40 million or more came from Canada. The party promised to impose the tax beginning in April 2020, and to lift it once governments reach a new agreement via the OECD process.\n\nWhat happens next: G20 finance ministers review the OECD proposals at a meeting in Washington, D.C. on October 17 and 18 The OECD holds public consultations on its proposals in Paris in November The 134 countries participating in the process agree to the OECD\u2019s approach by January 2020 The steering group for the process\u2014whose 24 current members include a senior official in the Canadian finance department\u2014delivers a final report by the end of 2020, which will include details on revenue thresholds, affected sectors and included business activities\n\nOn Wednesday, Liberal spokesperson Eleanore Catenaro said, \u201cUntil a consensus is reached at the OECD level on a different mechanism, we\u2019re going to move forward with this three per cent tax to make sure that global tech giants are paying their fair share.\u201d\n\nIn September, Conservative leader Andrew Scheer told reporters he would ensure \u201cforeign multibillion-dollar corporations who are collecting hundreds of millions of dollars worth of ad revenues or subscription fees out of Canada pay their fair share,\u201d but did not provide details of how he proposed to do so. The Conservatives did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday.\n\nThe NDP proposal would require foreign digital media companies to pay the same taxes as Canadian competitors.\n\nM\u00e9lanie Richer, NDP director of communications and media, said, \u201cThe OECD proposal includes some positive steps \u2026 but [Canada needs] more fundamental reforms,\u201d citing the party\u2019s proposal requiring companies to \u201cprove the economic substance of offshore transactions.\u201d\n\nThe Green Party platform includes a corporate tax on \u201ctransnational e-commerce companies doing business in Canada\u201d that will require firms to \u201cregister, collect and remit taxes where the product or service is consumed.\u201d On Monday, leader Elizabeth May said the proposal is not a sales tax, but that a Green government would apply it \u201cfurther upstream to ensure that we collect \u2026 almost like a levy on [companies\u2019] ability to do business in Canada.\u201d\n\nJohn Bennett, a Green Party information officer, said the party \u201c[supports] the OECD proposal in principle but Canada should go farther,\u201d noting that the Green platform calls for ad purchases on foreign-owned digital platforms like Google and Facebook to be ineligible for tax deductions, among other measures.\n\nMany of the firms likely to be affected by the OECD proposals are headquartered in the U.S. Seventeen of the 30 target companies of France\u2019s digital-services tax are U.S.-based, according to KPMG. But unlike that measure, the OECD plan would also cover firms that sell products to consumers in markets other than their own through third-party distributors, meaning the tax changes would apply to luxury-brand owners like LVMH and Kering, which are both French.\n\nThe proposal specifically carves out extractive companies\u2014meaning Canada\u2019s mining and energy sectors would not be affected\u2014and suggests further discussion about whether other industries like financial services should also be exempt.\n\nGoogle Canada, Facebook Canada and Netflix all said they pay applicable taxes in the countries in which they operate, in response to questions from The Logic about the OECD and party proposals.\n\n\u201cThis is a complex area for law and is governed by a vast network of international treaties,\u201d said Aaron Brindle, head of public affairs at Google Canada. \u201cThat said, we agree that tax rules should be simpler and clearer.\u201d\n\nErin Taylor, communications manager for Facebook Canada, said, \u201cTax policy should provide certainty for businesses to operate domestically and abroad. We continue to support multilateral approaches like that being undertaken at the OECD.\u201d\n\nShare the full article! Send to a friend\n\nLoading... Thanks for sharing!
