How dare he actually deliver on his promise not to have anymore of our precious warriors shipped home in boxes after getting killed on battlefields we can\u2019t even pronounce, while refereeing conflicts that began long before America was a thing, in campaigns without any kind of coherent objective?\n\nConservatives like me still think of ourselves as hawks, but after hard experience we have learned to be hawkish only where America\u2019s interests are directly at stake. We\u2019re not doves. We\u2019re just not going to spill our troops\u2019 blood when we do not absolutely have to. The elite may not like our attitude, but then it\u2019s generally not the elite that ends up having to bury its sons, daughters, husbands and wives. We do.\n\nI generally like the Kurds. I generally dislike the Turks. But they\u2019ve been killing each other for a long time and no one has yet offered a sufficient reason why America should stick its troops in the crossfire between them. We hear words like \u201cbetrayal\u201d tossed around, often by people whose track record re: honor is (charitably) lacking, but that assumes America had a say in this latest round ramping up. If the Turks are intent on invading, a firm \u201cNo\u201d from the Oval office is not going to stop a battalion of Leopard tanks. If you want to stop them, you have to be prepared to stop them. That means war, and the president \u2013 along with millions of us \u2013 say \u201cNo thanks.\u201d\n\nSome solid conservatives who I respect disagree with the president\u2019s take. They point out that the Kurds have fought with us and that they\u2019ve had a raw deal. They also point to the Turks\u2019 sordid history of genocide, like with the Armenians. These are good points \u2013 I spent 16 months away from my family deployed helping Muslims avoid a genocide in Kosovo \u2013 but they are not good enough to justify us doing the only thing that can stop the Turks if they are committed to their threatened aggression, i.e., being willing to have American troops fight them.\n\nLet\u2019s have some real talk, because the Orange Man Bad side of the debate \u2013 the side that suddenly is all hopped up on war juice \u2013 offers nothing but hack clich\u00e9s to support its amorphous position. The Kurds helped destroy ISIS, true. It\u2019s also true that the Kurds would have fought ISIS anyway, since the psycho caliphate was right next door. Let\u2019s be honest \u2013 the Kurds didn\u2019t show up for us at Normandy or Inchon or Khe Sanh or Kandahar. The Syrian Kurds allied with us in their homeland because we shared a common interest in wiping out the head-lopping freak show that was ISIS. Moreover, all Kurds are not equal. The PKK \u2013 the Kurdistan Workers' Party \u2013 are a bunch of commie terrorists who have been fighting the Turks for a long time. Those reds are no friends of ours, and it\u2019s their antics that seem to be inspiring the Turkish campaign. I have little use for the Turks, but they aren\u2019t just picking this fight for Schiffs and giggles. The fact that it\u2019s all so confusing is a really, really good reason for us to stay the hell out of it.\n\nMoreover, we keep hearing about our \u201cobligation\u201d to the Kurds, but who is the genius who promised the Kurds that if Turkey attacked the United States would go to war? Would that promise be binding on us if it were? After all, I don\u2019t recall my senators voting on a treaty \u2013 after debate and with accountability to us voters \u2013 agreeing to put American lives on the line to protect the sovereignty of hypothetical Kurdistan. This idea that some sort of obligation for America to defend another people can arise outside the treaty ratification process is as bizarre as it is unconstitutional. Now we\u2019re supposed to shed our blood because our elites feel we owe it to foreign strangers?\n\nI do note that there is one treaty, duly signed and ratified by the Senate, at play here. That\u2019s the NATO treaty under which we agreed to go to war to defend Turkey if attacked. If Erdogan, that thug, were more cunning he would assert Article 5 and demand NATO forces come to Turkey\u2019s defense against the cross-border attacks by the PKK.\n\nNone of this is to justify what Turkey is doing. I hope the tough and brave non-communist Kurds bloody these bullies\u2019 noses. But I cannot think of any way to adequately explain to the mom and dad of a 20-year-old 82nd Airborne 11 Bravo paratrooper from Rancho Cucamonga why their son got his head blown off in Northern Syria fighting the Kurd\u2019s war for them.\n\nIn the Army War College, they drilled into us the necessity of a clearly defined objective as the foundation of every successful military operation. If you do not know exactly what you wish to achieve, you cannot plan and execute effectively. Okay critics, what\u2019s our proposed objective in Northern Syria? Stop with the clich\u00e9s about \u201cbetrayals\u201d and \u201cabandoning allies\u201d and tell me \u2013 exactly \u2013 what we would seek to achieve. And then tell me \u2013 again, exactly \u2013 how many dead Americans we should sacrifice to achieve it.\n\nWe have our own national interests to protect. The threat to America is not Turks imposing a security zone a few miles inside Syria. It\u2019s China pumping out a couple warships a month and deploying new carrier-killing missiles using tech they steal from us under the noses of our politically preoccupied FBI and CIA. If the president\u2019s critics in Congress really want to be tough guys, let them pass a declaration of war and let them sign their names to the butcher\u2019s bill instead of trying to get Trump to walk out to the end of the branch so they can saw it off.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear \u2013 and I need to be crystal clear because the gung ho gang\u2019s MO is to mischaracterize its opponents\u2019 views to distract from the strategic bankruptcy of its own \u2013 that fighting for the Kurds would not be immoral. It\u2019s a good cause, but we can\u2019t intervene every time there\u2019s a good cause. Iraq was a good cause, and a disaster. I\u2019d come back on active duty, if the Army was that desperate, and serve there proudly. Our troops will do everything we ask of them and more. They will lay down their lives for this cause if we send them. And that\u2019s the point.\n\nWe owe our men and women in uniform the moral courage to make the hard decision not to fight, even when we see a grievous wrong unfolding, where there is no compelling national interest and no clear objective. We can\u2019t garrison Syria forever. We can\u2019t right every wrong around the globe.\n\nHow many dead Americans is it worth to stop the Turks and Kurds from brawling? I, and our president, say, \u201cExactly none.\u201d Those who disagree owe us all an exact number of their own.\n\nWhat happens if the liberals achieve their dream of an America they rule over? Check out my action-packed yet hilarious novels of America torn apart by the kind of liberal fascism the Democrats promise, People's Republic, Indian Country and Wildfire (plus Book Number IV comes out this November)!
