McDonald\u2019s Singapore\n\nIf you love Big Mac so much that you even want to eat it in your dreams at night, McDonald\u2019s Singapore might just have the thing to help you.\n\nThe fast food giant will on Monday (Oct 7) evening launch a brand new loungewear line dedicated to its iconic burger and fries as well as the brand\u2019s signature colours \u2013 yellow and red.\n\nStarting 6pm, it will give out a McDelivery Sleeping Mask \u2013 a white and yellow eye mask that says \u201cdreaming of fries\u201d \u2013 to customers who make purchases of S$18 and above via the McDonald\u2019s and McDelivery apps or the McDelivery web platform.\n\nThe sleeping mask will come free with any S$18 purchase (excluding delivery fee). Caption goes here Source\n\nYes, that means you don\u2019t have to go to an actual store, and its the perfect opportunity to say you\u2019re too lazy to go get dinner.\n\nTo redeem the mask, customers must first enter the promo code \u201cmcdnightin\u201d.\n\nAt the same time, the restaurant will also sell a S$24.90 bundle that consists of a Happy Sharing Box B (6-piece McNuggets and 4-piece McWings) and one set of burger and fries-themed loungewear in either men\u2019s or women\u2019s free size.\n\nA close-up look at the loungewear print. McDonald\u2019s Singapore\n\nCustomers must again enter the same promo code to also receive the McDelivery Sleeping Mask.\n\nAnd while the sleeping mask can be redeemed at any time of the day thereafter, the loungewear set will only be sold after breakfast hours via the same McDelivery platforms.\n\nCouple-wear has never made people so hungry. McDonald\u2019s Singapore\n\nThere is something you must take note of though: all items in the loungewear collection are only available while stocks last, and we all know what that means in Singapore. Chances are, there\u2019ll be many disappointed fans and a disproportionate number of scalpers turning to Carousell for a quick buck.\n\nAccording to McDonald\u2019s, the new clothing line is part of its McDelivery Night launch, after running McDelivery Day promotions in 2018 and earlier this year.\n\nThe chain, which was the first in Singapore to offer 24/7 delivery service in 2005, is celebrating \u201cthe joys of actually staying in and enjoying the convenience of food delivery while lounging about\u201d, Agatha Yap, senior director of McDonald\u2019s Singapore\u2019s marketing, menu and digital innovation said.\n\nSo go ahead, get lazy.\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - Couple-wear has never made people so hungry..
