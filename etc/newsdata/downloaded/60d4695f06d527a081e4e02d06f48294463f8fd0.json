Now the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) has taken the next step by challenging the law\u2019s constitutional validity in the Supreme Court.\n\nThe group argues that the law offends four separate articles of the Indian constitution and wrongfully interferes in Muslim Personal Law.\n\nHaving struck down Triple Talaq just over two years ago, the court will now examine whether the law brought in to ban it is unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cIf 20 Islamic countries can ban Triple Talaq, why can\u2019t India? Even Mohammad the Prophet said that triple talaq is a sin,\u201d India\u2019s minister for legal affairs, Ravi Shankar Prasad, said when parliament voted on the act earlier this year.\n\nAlso on rt.com Sign of unity or \u2018BJP propaganda\u2019?
