Nick Sandmann\u2019s $250 million lawsuit against the Washington Post was dismissed in late July by federal Judge William Bertelsman who said the Post\u2019s reporting was protected speech. However, today Judge Bertelsman partially reversed that earlier decision, allowing 3 of 33 claims to proceed to discovery:\n\nAfter reviewing an amended complaint, Judge William Bertelsman ordered Monday that the case could enter the discovery phase and hence a portion of the lawsuit against the newspaper could continue\u2026 Bertelsman said in the order that he stands by his decision that 30 of the 33 statements Sandmann\u2019s lawyers argued were libelous were not, but that \u201cjustice requires\u201d further review of three of the statements. \u201cThese three statements state that (Sandmann) \u2018blocked\u2019 Nathan Phillips and \u2018would not allow him to retreat,'\u201d the order reads.\n\nJudge Bertelsman\u2019s decision is here. He doesn\u2019t fully explain why he reconsidered his previous ruling; however, he says some additional detail was added to the complaint about Nathan Phillips, the source of the statements published by the Post:\n\nThe Court will adhere to its previous rulings as they pertain to these statements except Statements 10, 11, and 33, to the extent that these three statements state that plaintiff \u201cblocked\u201d Nathan Phillips and \u201cwould not allow him to retreat.\u201d Suffice to say that the Court has given this matter careful review and concludes that \u201cjustice requires\u201d that discovery be had regarding these statements and their context. The Court will then consider them anew on summary judgment. The Court also notes that the proposed First Amended Complaint makes specific allegations concerning the state of mind of Phillips, the principal source of these statements. It alleges in greater detail than the original complaint that Phillips deliberately lied concerning the events at issue, and that he had an unsavory reputation which, but for the defendant\u2019s negligence or malice, would have alerted defendant to this fact.\n\nThe Washington Post has reported on the story as well. The last line of the Post story states, \u201cA Post representative declined to comment.\u201d\n\nSandmann\u2019s attorneys tweeted about the decision:\n\nAs a prepare for summary judgment hearing today in LA in Vernon Unsworth v. Elon Musk, the news of our team\u2019s huge win in Covington, KY reaffirms my career-long belief that our system of justice works. Nicholas Sandmann deserves his day in court against WaPo. Now he will get it. \u2014 Lin Wood (@LLinWood) October 28, 2019\n\nNEWSFLASH: Federal Judge William O. Bertelsman partially reversed his ruling to dismiss #nicksandmann's claims against the @washingtonpost. Nick's case may now proceed into discovery. The ruling bodes will for the NBC and CNN cases, as well. @LLinWood pic.twitter.com/4MoJdSreXa \u2014 Todd V. McMurtry (@ToddMcMurtry) October 28, 2019\n\nSandmann has filed similar suits against NBC and CNN. The changes made to this complaint seem pretty specific to the facts involving the Post\u2019s story so it\u2019s not clear any of this would be transferable to a case against, for instance, CNN. But regardless of how the case turns out the discovery process should be very interesting. I very much look forward to learning what Post employees and editors were saying about this as it was happening. It\u2019s hard to believe they came up with such a biased account of what happened by accident.", "description": "\"Suffice to say that the Court has given this matter careful review...\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Nick-Sandmann.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
