It's a fair and balanced agreement for the EU and the UK and it is testament to our commitment to find solutions,\" Juncker said on Twitter.\n\nThe deal must still be formally ratified by the European and UK Parliaments.\n\nHere is some reaction from around the world on the agreement:\n\nGermany\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Heiko Maas has described the Brexit agreement negotiated by the British government and the European Union as \"nothing less than a diplomatic feat\".\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Berlin, Maas said the agreement \"is proof that we all worked very responsibly together\", adding a reminder that it still needs to be discussed by EU leaders and the European Parliament.\n\nScotland\n\nThe leader of the Scottish National Party said her party will not vote for the new deal.\n\nNicola Sturgeon said the agreement \"would take Scotland out of the European Union, out of the single market and out of the customs union against the overwhelming democratic will of the people of Scotland\".\n\nShe said in a written statement that her party's lawmakers \"will not vote for Brexit in any form\".\n\nFrance\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said it was now down to Johnson to deliver a vote in the British Parliament on the Brexit deal agreed with the EU.\n\nWhen asked by reporters if the deal would pass the House of Commons, Macron said: \"This is not my job. As long as I'm here, I'm not the prime minister [of the UK]\".\n\n\"This is your prime minister [the UK prime minister] to deliver now a vote to parliament so I\u2026my understanding now is that now he's in a situation to get a majority at the parliament and I do hope it will be the case,\" he added.\n\nMacron said it was now up to Boris Johnson to deliver Brexit [Laurent Cipriani/AP]\n\nBrexit Party\n\nBrexit Party leader Nigel Farage has urged the UK Parliament to reject the new deal.\n\nFarage said the deal is \"just not Brexit\" and would bind Britain to the EU in too many ways.\n\nThe commitment to regulatory alignment in this agreement means that the \u201cnew deal\u201d is not Brexit, despite improvements on the customs union. \u2014 Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) October 17, 2019\n\nLib Dems\n\nThe leader of Britain's pro-Europe Liberal Democrats said the party is determined to halt the Brexit process despite the new deal.\n\nThe party's leader Jo Swinson said she is \"more determined than ever\" to stop Brexit and to \"give the public the final say\".\n\nThe party is in favor of holding a second referendum on Brexit.\n\nLabour Party\n\nUK Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn has condemned the revised deal as \"even worse\" than the settlement reached by Johnson's predecessor that was repeatedly rejected by British lawmakers.\n\n\"From what we know, it seems the Prime Minister has negotiated an even worse deal than Theresa May's, which was overwhelmingly rejected,\" Corbyn said in a statement.\n\nDUP\n\nThe Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) said it could not support what was being proposed in Johnson's deal regarding customs and consent issues for Northern Ireland's border with Ireland post Brexit.\n\n\"As things stand, we could not support what is being suggested on customs and consent issues, and there is a lack of clarity on VAT (value-added tax),\" DUP leader Arlene Foster and deputy leader Nigel Dodds said in a statement.\n\n\"We will continue to work with the Government to try and get a sensible deal that works for Northern Ireland and protects the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom.\"", "description": "Several UK parties have said they will vote against the Johnson's new deal in the parliament.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/17/87cb09e739314c319b4f68a7636de4c5_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
