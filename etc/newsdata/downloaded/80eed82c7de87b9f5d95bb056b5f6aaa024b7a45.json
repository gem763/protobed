After months of leaks, the search giant has finally confirmed at today\u2019s event what we\u2019ve all known for some time now: the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL both have two rear cameras, a face unlocking feature, gesture controls, and a 90Hz display.\n\nThe lack of the notch is one of the big evolutions of the Pixel 4. Last year\u2019s phones (the surprisingly named Pixel 3 range) suffered with one of the worst notches I\u2019ve ever seen on a phone. Honestly, I hated it. When the company released the 3a and 3a XL though (Google\u2019s entry-level Pixel phones), the notch was no longer there, and the phone was so much better to use.\n\nNow Google has removed the notch for a simple reason: to fit a whole load of new technology in.\n\nThe bar at the top not only contains a selfie-camera, it also has a near-infrared flood emitter, a dot projector, and \u2014 excitingly \u2014 the first radar chip in a mobile phone: the Soli sensor. With this, you can use gestures (like a hand wave) to interact with the phone. For example, you can swipe your arm to answer calls, change tracks, and turn off alarms.\n\nBecause of this, the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL now has a face unlocking feature that \u2014 according to the company \u2014 will be the fastest on the market and work in extreme low light conditions. If this holds up in reality, it will be awesome \u2014 as it\u2019s one of my main bugbears with the iPhone\u2019s unlocking system.\n\nAnother element Google announced was an easier way to manage your personal data on Google hardware. Supposedly this can be done with just a push of a button:\n\nIt\u2019ll also allow you to easily delete Google Assistant data.\n\nOne assumes this is a direct reaction to Apple\u2019s focus on privacy, as well as some recent scandals about how Google is using your data. For Pixel users worried about privacy, this should be a pretty big boon.\n\nAnyway, let\u2019s have a look at the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL\u2019s specs:\n\nDisplay\n\nThe Pixel 4 has a 5.7\u2033 FHD+ flexible OLED display with a 19:9 aspect ratio. The Pixel 4 XL has the same display, but is 6.3\u2033 instead. Using Smart Display technology, the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL can run a 90Hz display, but can also adapt this depending on the environment in order to save battery life.\n\nCameras\n\nBoth the Pixel 4 and the Pixel 4 XL have the same rear camera set-up, with 16MP and 12MP lenses on the back of the devices, and an 8MP one on the front. The selfie camera also can deliver a 90-degree field of view, meaning more people can fit in your snaps. The phones have a hybrid zoom software that delivers some pretty impressive results.\n\nSoftware-wise, Google is rolling out Live HDR+. Basically, this will give an image of what the photo will actually look like on the viewfinder of the phone. Honestly, this looks like it\u2019s going to be incredible.\n\nTo give you an idea (as these are grabbed from the live stream), this is what a phone screen normally looks like when taking a HDR shot:\n\nAnd this is what it\u2019ll look like with Live HDR+:\n\nBasically, it should drastically improve mobile photography, as you\u2019ll be able to actually see what you\u2019re taking pictures of.\n\nThere are also a range of other features, including the ability to change more camera settings, improve white balancing, night sight (which has some phenomenal astronomical capabilities), and an update that makes the famous \u201cportrait mode\u201d look even better.\n\nChipset\n\nEach phone also contains a 2.84/1.78 GHz Octa-Core Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 chipset. Basically, this should deliver a top quality speed comparable to any flagship phone out there.\n\nStorage and RAM\n\nThe Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL are both launched with 6GB RAM. These days, that isn\u2019t a crazy amount, but should be more than enough to keep the phone going. The base models of the phones also come with a rather paltry 64GB of storage.\n\nI\u2019d always suggest going for at least 128GB (which is the other storage option you have), but the Pixel might be one of the few phones where this doesn\u2019t matter that much, as Google will store all your photos and videos in the cloud for free.\n\nBattery\n\nOne difference between the devices is that the Pixel 4 XL has the larger battery, with a 3,700mAh capacity, compared to 2,800mAh on the regular Pixel 4.\n\nColors\n\nYou have the pretty standard \u201cClearly White\u201d (it\u2019s white) and the \u201cJust Black\u201d (it\u2019s black) colors, but there\u2019s also a jazzy surprise in there too: \u201cOh So Orange\u201d (spoiler, it\u2019s orange).\n\nYep, that sure looks like a burnt, rusty orange.\n\nI\u2026 don\u2019t really like this. But hey, everyone\u2019s different!\n\nPrice and release\n\nThe Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL will come out on October 24, but you can pre-order the damn things now. The Pixel 4 starts at $799, while you can grab the Pixel 4 XL for $899.\n\nWe\u2019ll be back soon with hands-on articles and reviews of the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL, so make sure you keep an eye trained on Plugged!\n\nThis post includes affiliate links to products that you can buy online.
