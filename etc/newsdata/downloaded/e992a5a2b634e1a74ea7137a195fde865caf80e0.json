Why so many, and why have they gone without for so long?\"\n\nWatch Autumn Peltier speak at the UN:\n\nShe said she's been taught traditional knowledge from an early age about the sacredness of water, and that more people should learn these lessons.\n\n\"Maybe, we need to have more elders and youth together sitting at the decision table when people make decisions about our lands and waters.\"\n\nPeltier called for an end to plastic use as one step in restoring a more sustainable world.\n\nHer speech comes a day after huge crowds took to the streets in Canada as part of a global climate strike.\n\nThe speech was her second at the UN headquarters, having urged the General Assembly to \"warrior up\" and take a stand for our planet last year.\n\nThere is a Greta Thunberg in Canada. Her name is Autumn Peltier. <a href=\"https://t.co/Jmoo3jJF5C\">https://t.co/Jmoo3jJF5C</a> \u2014@chriscorrigan\n\nPeltier, who is nominated for the 2019 International Children's Peace Prize by the David Suzuki Foundation, has spread her message at hundreds of events around the world.\n\nIn 2015, Peltier attended the Children's Climate Conference in Sweden, and a year later, confronted Prime Minister Justin Trudeau about his \"broken promises\" at a meeting of the Assembly of First Nations.\n\nShe was named the chief water commissioner by the Anishinabek Nation, a political advocacy group for 40 First Nations across Ontario, when she was just 14 years old.", "description": "Canadian Indigenous water activist Autumn Peltier addressed hundreds of international guests at UN headquarters in Manhattan on Saturday.
