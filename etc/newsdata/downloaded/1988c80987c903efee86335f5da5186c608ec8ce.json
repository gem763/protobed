How Count Arthur Strong conquered comedy", "language": "en", "text": "Comedy has its careerists: thrusting tyros zeroing in on the fame, the TV gigs, the movie roles. But there are other, more circuitous routes to the top. The fictional Count Arthur Strong certainly took one, via the dog days of vaudeville and bit parts in Hammer horrors. His creator Steve Delaney took one too, meandering from drama school to a carpentry career to the slow gestation of his alter ego, away from the circuit\u2019s bright lights.\n\nThe Count is a star now; his sitcom \u2013 co-written with Graham Linehan \u2013 ran for three series to 2017. But he was once an oddity on the Edinburgh fringe, where I started watching him at the turn of the century \u2013 an experience never to be forgotten, for various reasons. Yes, this blithering, dyspeptic old-school entertainer was a creation of near-genius, and Delaney\u2019s blood vessel-busting performance a spectacle to behold. But \u2013 wow! \u2013 those early shows could be gruelling. The joke was in Arthur\u2019s frustration and confusion, as his own waning powers (of memory, movement, syntax) thwarted this or that overreaching set piece. Often, Delaney took that joke to painful, patience-fraying extremes.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Indomitabubble \u2026 Count Arthur Strong. Photograph: Des Willie/BBC/Retort\n\nI laughed, I winced \u2013 and I watched as other audience members walked out. (\u201cThree quarters getting it and a quarter not,\u201d says Delaney now: \u201cThat works for me!\u201d) I certainly didn\u2019t peg Count Arthur as a national treasure in waiting \u2013 his BBC One sitcom twice Bafta-nominated, his radio show multi-award-winning, his national tours a fun-for-all-the-family hot ticket. \u201cI always thought Arthur would work in a sitcom,\u201d Delaney tells me. \u201cI never had any question about the various things he would work in. I believe in the character.\u201d\n\nAnd so he should: it\u2019s his life\u2019s work. Delaney is 64 now, and \u2013 chatting at his publicist\u2019s HQ before another UK tour \u2013 he\u2019s looking good on it. A gentle chap with a naive air about him, he\u2019s grown into Arthur, whom he dreamed up in the 80s. Delaney was studying at Central School of Speech and Drama, and needed an act for a circus-themed cabaret. Arthur was a sort-of strongman competing with Dracula to take bites out of a Bible. \u201cIt was very embryonic,\u201d Delaney recalls. \u201cHe had the voice I used to lapse into anyway when I was arsing about. With this act, I was arsing about in a circus, so I just used that voice.\u201d\n\nAnd what a voice it is. Northern (Delaney\u2019s from Leeds, the son of a foundryman and a seamstress), wheedling, malaprops a-go-go. \u201cI didn\u2019t get wherever I am by not knowing where I am.\u201d \u201cIf this turns into a full bowl of cashews, it could chiropidise the whole show. With my feet!\u201d (I could go on. I\u2019d love to go on.) He is hair-trigger touchy \u2013 a trait Delaney claims to share. \u201cI often overreact to innocent questions, immediately thinking it\u2019s to do with something I haven\u2019t done. That defence mechanism is big up north. It was prolific in my family.\u201d It makes for great comedy. \u201cEveryone likes that Arthur says what he thinks. Immediately. It goes through no filter.\u201d\n\nBut beyond the cantankerousness, the Count is indomitable. \u201cHe\u2019s a great optimist. He\u2019s always on the lookout for the next thing. \u2018We\u2019ll get three of those, and I\u2019ll set a market stall up.\u2019 I love that about him,\u201d says Delaney, \u201cperhaps because it\u2019s unlike me.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, it took initiative for Delaney to make a success of the Count. He was a bit-part actor in the 80s (Juliet Bravo, All Creatures Great and Small), and a joiner on the side. The jobs overlapped: he was sitcom star Geoffrey Palmer\u2019s carpenter of choice. Not until 15 years after drama school did he revive the Count for the comedy stage \u2013 after which instant success, he quit acting immediately. \u201cAt drama college,\u201d he says now, \u201cI learned that I wasn\u2019t versatile. I didn\u2019t have the application you need to change what you do every time you do something. If I had a performance in me, it was about homing in on something in a very meticulous way.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s what Delaney did \u2013 far from well-trodden comedy paths. \u201cI would hire venues. I\u2019d put my own evenings on. I\u2019d virtually print the tickets myself.\u201d After six years, he quit carpentry too, and Arthur \u201cbecame my living. I come from a generation where you have to have a job. And Arthur\u2019s my job; that\u2019s very much how I treat it.\u201d Even today, he professes no interest in taking on other roles. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in being an actor\u201d \u2013 unlike Steve Coogan, say, to whose Alan Partridge the Count is often compared. But really, there\u2019s no analogy to be drawn, no other comic who\u2019s dedicated a lifetime to just one character.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018There are no other characters that could have come out of me\u2019 \u2026 Steve Delaney. Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian\n\nBut why this character? \u201cThere are no others that could have come out of me,\u201d says Delaney. \u201cThey say write about what you know. Well, when I was a kid in the 60s, a lot of stuff on TV was transitioning from the collapse of variety theatre. Light entertainment was fantastic: The Arthur Haynes Show, The Army Game, Bootsie and Snudge. And I place Arthur right on that transition period.\u201d It\u2019s a moment laced with melancholy; Count Arthur has a dark side. \u201cWhen music hall was breathing its last gasp is when Arthur started getting into it. Beautifully mistimed. So he\u2019s always been chasing it.\u201d\n\nOf course, whether Arthur really was a vaudevillian, or only ever performed in the music hall of his own mind, is moot. \u201c[TV producer] Geoff Posner once told me I should map out everything Arthur\u2019s ever done. His backstory, in effect. So I went home and got out my pen and notepad. And I don\u2019t think I wrote a line.\u201d That\u2019s not how the character works. \u201cIt would place too many restrictions on his flights of fancy. I deliberately don\u2019t answer those questions. Arthur goes on about how he was in The Bridge on the River Kwai: I don\u2019t know if he was or not. Maybe he just really resents Alex Guinness.\u201d He pauses, Arthur-like. \u201cOr is it Alec Guinness? Even I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s called.\u201d\n\nFor me, there's nothing funny in coming up with a character with dementia. I steer clear of it. He's a nutty old bloke\n\nDelaney won\u2019t be drawn on whether the forgetful Count is a portrait in senility rather than mere dottiness. \u201cI steer clear of it. For me, there\u2019s nothing funny in coming up with a character with dementia. The best way I can describe Arthur is, he\u2019s a nutty old bloke. In the way people were allowed to be nutty when I was a kid. \u2018Don\u2019t go near him, he\u2019s mad.\u2019 People don\u2019t grow old in the same way any more. Mind you,\u201d he says, \u201ceven when he was young, Arthur was like that.\u201d\n\nAt any rate, the character\u2019s variety roots show in his stage work, where routine after routine (the ventriloquist\u2019s Egyptian dummy; his lederhosen-clad Sound of Music tribute; or the silent comedy set-piece in which his stooges dress him as Sherlock Holmes) would grace the end of any pier. Then there are the moments that splice hilarity with agony \u2013 like the Count\u2019s caterwauling rendition of Bill Withers\u2019 Lovely Day in his last show The Sound of Mucus. Playing Arthur for two-and-a-half hours on stage \u2013 clenched, inflexible, barking \u2013 looks like a physical endurance test. Is it?\n\n\u201cI never feel that, no. I know it\u2019s hard: I was dizzy at the end of Lovely Day, wobbling around. But if Arthur would be on his knees at the end of it, then I want to be on my knees as a performer. It might hurt in the moment, but not after the show. And besides,\u201d he says, \u201cthose moments people call excruciating, I love them.\u201d\n\nThere may be fewer of them these days \u2013 although Delaney insists he never toned down the character. \u201cSome fans of the radio show didn\u2019t like the TV show, and thought it was a watered-down version. But to me, they\u2019re just different stories, different sides of Arthur \u2013 but the same approach from me.\u201d Whatever the approach, it\u2019s secured for Delaney an audience far wider than he expected. \u201cWhen I was at the London Palladium, doing pantomime,\u201d he tells me, \u201cI was having a chat with Bobby Davro. And he said to me, \u2018You are mainstream. You sell venues out\u2019.\u201d Delaney was puzzled by this then, and still is. \u201cI like doing things on my own terms too much. I don\u2019t regard what I do as mainstream at all.\u201d\n\nBut what\u2019s thrilling about Count Arthur\u2019s success is it proves you can be both. Experimental and popular. Eccentric and mainstream. Successful, and diffident about success. In the Count\u2019s case, that success shows no signs of waning, with new TV projects in development (on which he is sworn to secrecy), a foray into publishing (with semi-coherent thriller Codename Rattlesnake) and a new tour (Is There Anybody Out There?, about stargazing) all in the pipeline. Of the latter, Delaney tells me: \u201cI\u2019m itching to perform again as Arthur now. I\u2019ve spent enough time writing as him, I need to get out there and do it. You always think, \u2018I wonder if I can still do it?\u2019 \u2013 and I know the answer to that question, of course I do. But I enjoy having to prove it.\u201d", "description": "As the dyspeptic old-school entertainer embarks on a tour, his creator Steve Delaney reflects on dedicating his life to one character", "authors": ["Brian Logan"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f3eb3c8735ffe02feab21384e6db345481ff7f6/0_844_3643_2185/master/3643.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5a0595560605ab5c1d9ced403965de83", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
