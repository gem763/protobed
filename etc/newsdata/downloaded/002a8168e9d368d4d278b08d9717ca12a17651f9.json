And now we're starting to see how much these disappointments in the tech space are hitting some big investment banks.\n\nIn its third quarter earnings report released Tuesday, Goldman Sachs (GS) executives outlined a tough environment for their own investments in some new issues like Uber (UBER) as well as its position in The We Company. Revenue in Goldman's equity securities division fell 40% from the prior year, a decline the firm said reflected \"significantly lower net gains from investments in private equities as well as net losses from investments in public equities.\"\n\nOn an earnings conference call, Goldman CFO Stephen Scherr said the bank\u2019s mark-to-market hit on its public holdings was $267 million, with most of that coming from its stakes in Uber, Avantor (AVTR), and TradeWeb (TW).\n\nScherr also revealed that the company wrote down its stake in WeWork by $80 million. WeWork, which filed to go public in August, subsequently saw its valuation fall precipitously, pulled its IPO, and is now seeking alternative financing arrangements in order to continue as a going concern. Goldman's writedown also follows Jefferies (JEF) taking a $146 million hit on its WeWork investment in its earnings report released last month.\n\nJPMorgan (JPM), which has been leading efforts to arrange WeWork's latest financing package, was pressed repeatedly on its involvement with the company during a call with the media, but said only that it continues to support its clients in a complex situation. The firm did not offer color on which positions impacted its equities business, though JPMorgan reported a 5% drop in revenue in its equity markets group.\n\nThis rough year for IPOs has had some Silicon Valley investors, most notably Benchmark's Bill Gurley, arguing that it is the IPO process itself \u2014 not the companies presented to the market \u2014 that is the problem.\n\nWall Street is feeling Silicon Valley's pain. (Getty) More\n\nGoldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, unsurprisingly, thinks this year is merely a stark example of how public markets instill discipline on companies that otherwise didn't have much.\n\n\"I think the IPO process is alive and well in the United States,\" Solomon said Tuesday. \"I do think that we are going to see a rebalancing of this process of private capital formation.\"\n\nSolomon added that changes could be coming to how large companies grow and the length of time they stay private before beginning the IPO process, but said he sees the events of this year as a \"healthy adjustment.\" Of course, \"healthy adjustment\" is exactly how one would expect the CEO of a bank that is pretty directly feeling the pain from some of these IPOs to explain away the market's current view of the space.\n\nBut while both bankers and venture capitalists work to prove why WeWork isn't the beginning of a new, frosty period in markets but merely an outlier, along the way the hits being taken are real.\n\nIt's part of the reason why officials like Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren have called out the risks WeWork's stumbles pose to the broader commercial real estate market. And why WeWork's non-entry to the public market doesn't mean the story is going away anytime soon.\n\nBy Myles Udland, reporter and co-anchor of The Final Round.
