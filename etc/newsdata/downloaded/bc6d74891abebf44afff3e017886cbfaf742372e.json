We are not finding the court doing their part to the best of their ability. The last time there was a bust worth millions in Springfield - the guys got bail of R5000. I hope that doesn't happen again. So we are worried about what happens after the arrest,\" he said.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android or iPhone.\n\nKEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter.\n\n- FOLLOW News24 on Twitter", "description": "Three suspects have been arrested for their involvement in drug manufacturing and drug dealing.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6812/27339e03eb164094b6a439b58d338b37.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-19"}
