Sign up here.\n\nThe World Trade Organization is in crisis and needs reform to play its global role effectively, according to the trade minister of Finland, which currently holds the rotating European Union presidency.\n\nAs an end to the U.S.-China trade war proves elusive and new rounds of tariffs are levied between the U.S. and the EU, Finland says the EU will continue to play by the global rule book policed by the WTO.\n\n\u201cThe European Union, Finland included, is very committed to continue the positive trade agenda with the U.S., but obviously we are ready to defend our interests when necessary,\u201d Trade Minister Ville Skinnari said in an interview on Bloomberg TV in Helsinki on Thursday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s for all of us to see the importance at the global level of WTO,\u201d he said. \u201cHonestly, the WTO is in crisis, it needs to be reformed. We need the rules.\u201d\n\nInternational commerce has been under threat since U.S. President Donald Trump launched an effort to overhaul America\u2019s trade relationships around the world. The escalating fight between the U.S. and China threatens to weigh down the global economy, with trade tensions between the EU and the U.S. adding to the list of risks.\n\nA way to get out of the intensifying tit-for-tat cycle of new levies is to talk, Skinnari said.\n\n\u201cThe key word is dialogue, keep up the good dialogue,\u201d he said. I believe, and I\u2019m an optimist -- we need to be -- Europe has to take leadership.\u201d\n\nAs trade tensions hammer the euro zone, hurting its export-reliant members, Finland\u2019s Economy Minister Katri Kulmuni underscored the importance of investments.\n\nIt \u201crequires we have investments related to education, investments to infrastructure, and investments to boost the economy,\u201d Kulmuni said in a Bloomberg TV interview. But she said such investments can\u2019t be allowed to clash with the EU\u2019s fiscal rules.\n\n\u201cConsidering the euro zone, the basics are the rules and they have to be followed. We\u2019re going to stick to those,\u201d she said. \u201cWe hope for responsible policy and economic decision-making from all the countries.\u201d\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Kati Pohjanpalo in Helsinki at kpohjanpalo@bloomberg.net;Francine Lacqua in London at flacqua@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Tasneem Hanfi Br\u00f6gger at tbrogger@bloomberg.net\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars.
