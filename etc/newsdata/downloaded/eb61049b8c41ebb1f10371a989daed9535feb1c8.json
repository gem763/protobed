So basically after we got out of the car, you know, it was immediately people already right there ready to help. They were taking belts off and shirts. And I heard them calling for different things. Some dude brought me some water from out of his car. There were just people coming from everywhere, helping me, to police officers cutting off my clothes.\u201d\n\nWASHINGTON REDSKINS SPELL LONDON FLETCHER'S NAME WRONG AS THEY INDUCT HIM INTO RING OF HONOR\n\nHe added: \u201cThere were so many people around me trying to help keep Kira calm. She told me a lady took off her shoes and gave them to her. And, you know, those people basically left naked that day because they used all their stuff and gave it to us to help. So it was amazing seeing those people that don't even know you from a can of paint to get out of their car and do all that for us.\u201d\n\nNorton credits everyone who was at the scene with saving his life.\n\n\u201cI would just tell them thank you,\u201d Norton said. \u201cThey're the ones that saved my life that night. We have the names of some people. But we're still trying to find that couple that actually were the first people on the scene to start helping.\u201d\n\nNorton has appeared at Dolphins games since the crash.
