The product operates in 19 other countries, including Canada, Mexico and the Philippines, and will roll out to Europe by early next year.\n\nUsers can decide whether they want to share information like photos, occupation and gender identity, and current Facebook friends aren\u2019t suggested as matches or able to see a user\u2019s dating profile, according to the company. Matches are suggested based on \u201cpreferences, interests and other things you do on Facebook.\u201d An Instagram-integrated \u201cSecret Crush\u201d feature also lets users carry a torch for people they know, only notifying the other party if there\u2019s mutual interest.\n\nThe service is ad-free and free to use. And the company stressed that what happens on Facebook Dating stays on Facebook Dating: \u201cIt won\u2019t be shared to the rest of Facebook,\u201d Facebook Dating product manager Nathan Sharp wrote in a blog post.\n\nBut the proposition that online daters place their faith in Facebook earned immediate skepticism, given the company\u2019s many data-related transgressions over the years. \u201cHappiness, brought to you by the company that gave you the Cambridge Analytica Scandal\u2122!\u201d wrote New York Times opinion writer Charlie Warzel. \u201clol i can\u2019t think of anything i would trust facebook to not accidentally reveal less,\u201d tweeted Slate writer Ashley Feinberg of the Secret Crush feature.\n\nJust one day before Facebook\u2019s announcement, in fact, TechCrunch reported that a non-password-protected server with more than 419 million users\u2019 phone numbers and Facebook IDs had been discovered online.\n\nA Facebook spokesman told the site that the dataset had been taken down and there was no evidence Facebook accounts had been compromised. \u201cThis data set is old and appears to have information obtained before we made changes last year to remove people\u2019s ability to find others using their phone numbers,\u201d he said.\n\nFacebook An Instagram-integrated \u2018Secret Crush\u2019 feature lets users select people they know.\n\nMark Weinstein, a privacy expert and CEO of the social network MeWe, urged users against entrusting Facebook \u201cwith their romantic life, dating details and interests, and fetishes and nuances.\u201d\n\n\u201cFacebook\u2019s promises don\u2019t mean anything \u2014 we have well over a decade of evidence of that, including this week,\u201d he told MarketWatch. \u201cJust the fact that they are repeatedly revealing that they leave critical data unsecured \u2026 should scare people enough.\u201d\n\nAn obvious worst-case scenario would be a hack, said Sean McGrath, editor of the site ProPrivacy.com \u2014 which wouldn\u2019t be beyond the realm of possibility. \u201cIn fact, services like Tinder go as far as to spell out that they cannot guarantee the safekeeping of personal data in their privacy policy,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cIf a malicious actor had access to the most intimate corners of your life, the damage they could wreak is difficult to imagine.\u201d\n\nSee also: \u2018I was humiliated\u2019 \u2014 online dating scammers hold nude photos for ransom in \u2018sextortion\u2019\n\nMcGrath also raised concern over any one company knowing so much about its users, especially given Facebook\u2019s ownership of platforms like Instagram and WhatsApp. \u201cFrom a privacy standpoint, alarm bells should be ringing when one company has a monopoly on our personal data,\u201d he said.\n\nThe potential public airing of some users\u2019 data could also pose safety risks if they are LGBTQ and not out, for example, said Jennifer King, the director of consumer privacy at the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford University Law School. And it\u2019s unclear how Facebook plans to combat the proliferation of online romance scams, King said, or whether it has a sufficient customer-service infrastructure in place to properly respond to users\u2019 complaints.\n\n\u201cGiven that they\u2019re not charging for this service, I question whether they\u2019ll be responsive in a timely fashion, in a way that you might see other sites take more aggressive action,\u201d she said.\n\nFacebook didn\u2019t respond to questions from MarketWatch about its plan for handling romance scams, what precautions it had taken to prevent users\u2019 dating information from being compromised, and whether it planned to monetize the service in the future, among other queries.\n\nBut King also saw potential upsides to the service, pointing out it seemed to have been designed with an eye toward safety and security: Users can share date locations and/or details with a trusted contact as they set off to meet someone in person, according to Facebook. And Facebook\u2019s ability to suggest matches based on such vast criteria \u2014 for example, users\u2019 mutual groups and events \u2014 opens up the potential for \u201cmore rich connections\u201d than they might find on a traditional dating app.\n\nPlus, she pointed out, some of Facebook\u2019s online-dating competitors don\u2019t exactly have spotless data-privacy records. For example, Danish researchers drew criticism in 2016 after releasing about 70,000 OKCupid MTCH, -4.31% users\u2019 profile information without the site\u2019s or users\u2019 permission. In 2018, NBC News reported that the gay dating app Grindr had a security vulnerability that could reveal users\u2019 location data. (The company at the time said it had \u201cmoved quickly to make changes to its platform to resolve this issue.\u201d)\n\nAnd this past Valentine\u2019s Day, Coffee Meets Bagel users learned that some of their names and email addresses \u201cmay have been acquired by an unauthorized party.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo the extent that [Facebook maintains its] wall between the dating service and the rest of the platform with regards to selling data or targeting for advertising,\u201d King said, \u201cit potentially, actually, could be a better place for some people.\u201d\n\nSo should unattached Facebookers trust Mark Zuckerberg and company with their casual hookups, soulmate searching and everything in between?\n\n\u201cI guess if you trust them so far \u2014 if you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019ve had a problem with them to date \u2014 then I don\u2019t see any major risks that this introduces,\u201d King said. \u201cBut I would tread carefully with what new things you elect to share with them that you aren\u2019t already sharing.\u201d\n\nMcGrath, for his part, said he believes Facebook has done \u201cvery little over the years\u201d to earn back its users\u2019 trust.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not saying don\u2019t use the platform,\u201d he said. \u201cBut users should maintain strict control of their privacy settings, do their best to understand the privacy policy and be mindful of exactly how much data they are willing to share before getting into bed with Facebook\u2019s dating service.\u201d\n\nShares of Facebook have been up 42% so far this year compared to a 15% gain for the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.14% and an 18% increase for the S&P 500 Index SPX, -0.01% .", "description": "The company rolled out its new Dating service just a day after a report that millions of its users\u2019 phone numbers had been discovered online.", "authors": ["Meera Jagannathan"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ872_zuck_ZG_20190906195750.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
