(Photo by Charles Sykes/Invision/AP)\n\nFormer San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick wants to return to the NFL. Though Kaepernick has not played since 2016, his agent has reportedly reached out to teams desperate for quarterback help, according to Chris Williamson of SNY.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nNFL teams were hit with a rash of quarterback injuries in Week 2. The Carolina Panthers, New Orleans Saints, New York Jets and Pittsburgh Steelers could all be looking to add quarterbacks after losing their starters to injury.\n\nKaepernick may not have played in the NFL recently, but he\u2019s reportedly in \u201cthe best shape of his life.\u201d\n\nSource close to @Kaepernick7 in light of all the QB injuries: \u201cColin is literally in the best shape of his life. He\u2019s been working out 5 days a week at 5 am for 3 years. He wants to play and his agent has been contacting teams in need of a QB.\u201d \u2014 Chris Williamson (@CWilliamson44) September 17, 2019\n\nThe 31-year-old Kaepernick has made it clear he wants another shot in the NFL. Kaepernick has posted a number of workout videos on social media during the offseason. He even held a private workout with Cleveland Browns receiver Odell Beckham Jr.\n\nKaepernick hasn\u2019t played since 2016. During that season, he began taking a knee during the national anthem to protest racial injustice in the United States. At the end of the season, Kaepernick became a free agent. He was not signed in the offseason.\n\nIn his final season, Kaepernick completed 59.2 percent of his passes in 12 games with the 49ers. He threw for 16 touchdowns and 4 interceptions.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlenty of teams have had opportunities to bring Kaepernick in for a workout the past few seasons, but have opted for other options, including Derek Anderson, Austin Davis and Tom Savage.\n\nWhile Kaepernick\u2019s time away from the game can be viewed as a detriment, Washington signed Josh Johnson last season despite the fact that Johnson hadn\u2019t appeared in an NFL game since 2014.\n\nGiven that NFL teams haven\u2019t brought in Kaepernick yet, it\u2019s unlikely he gets a call this time. The Steelers opted to sign former first-round pick Paxton Lynch to their practice squad instead of giving Kaepernick a shot. The Jets, Panthers and Saints could all make similar decisions.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nChris Cwik is a writer for Yahoo Sports. Have a tip?
