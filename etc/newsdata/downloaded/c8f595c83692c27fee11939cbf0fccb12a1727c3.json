He is a very successful businessman and a master tactician.\n\nHe was my coach at Stade Francais in 2010. His background is in textiles and fashion, which made him his millions and is ironic because I swear he only owns two T-shirts.\n\nFrom what I'm told, there's already enough money in his bank account to retire but he coaches because he loves the competitive edge and he's pretty damn good, which helps.\n\nFormer team-matesEddie Jones (left) and Michael Cheika enjoy winding each other up\n\nIn one training session with him I was doing tackling practice and he walked passed and said, 'Hask, mate, why don't you try to tackle me?'\n\nHe ended up running into me eight or nine times trying to bump me off. I did miss one, which I never heard the end of. He was always keen to get in and test himself.\n\nA lot of coaches tell you to be aggressive, smash things, but a lot of them are ex-players who never hit anything. You think, 'Mate, you can't even bang a drum'. Bizarrely a lot of these guys end up as defence coaches. When Cheika spoke like that, you knew he would do exactly the same as he was asking of you.\n\nDuring run-throughs, he'd step in for the reserves and play No 10. He'd do a dummy-and-go or try a chip or run over the top of someone.\n\nIf he dropped the ball, though, he would always blame the guy who threw the pass! If one of his passes went to floor, he would bollock the player for not reading him. No one ever argued because they knew they'd get filled in. It was funny.\n\nHe's aggressive and straight talking but he matches it with smartness. He loves playing on the underdog thing, having something to moan about.\n\nHe'll be desperate for someone to say something in the media this week that winds him up. All he'll do is repeat it to his players.\n\nHe'll feel aggrieved \u2014 it's his team against the world. That's why all the players who work with him want to play for him. You have seen this week how players will stand up for him. It's a mob mentality, which I bought into and still do.\n\nBefore a match, he would get you so fired up and worked with me on my aggression and gamesmanship. Jim Hamilton, when playing for Edinburgh v Stade Francais, started on me just before half-time, and carried on in the tunnel.\n\n\"Checks\" had me so fired up that I punched Jim in the face, in front of all the kids hanging over the tunnel edge. It was brave as Jim loved a scrape and was known for his heavy hands. It descended into a mass brawl.\n\nJames Haskell (left) and Cheika had an exchange during the 2015 Rugby World Cup\n\nWhen England played Australia in the 2015 World Cup, I was 24th man, warming up and I passed Cheika. I said hello, he said: 'Mate, you wanna have a word with that Ben Morgan, he's just written our pre-match speech'.\n\nMorgan had said something about making the Wallabies relive their last 'Twickenham nightmare'. We got knocked out of the World Cup. Never poke the bear.\n\nIn many ways, Cheika is similar to Eddie Jones, but in other ways they are very different. One is emotional, the other is not. Eddie loves revving Cheika up and Cheika loves getting revved up. It's a perfect formula.\n\nThey're both so passionate, and players are inspired by that. Eddie may not have the physical aggression, but he has the brain power and the personality. We live in a world of PR where people are scared of saying anything and the players love it when these two go at each other.\n\nWith social media, it all pops up on your feed. You'll see, 'Cheika calls out Eddie Jones' or vice versa. The lads are like old wives, gossiping, saying: 'Bloody hell, have you seen what Cheika said?' You love it when your coach leads from the front. We're aggressive sportsmen. You want to see them scrap. They will be hoping for a bit of that this week.\n\nI'd have run through walls for both these coaches. Cheika, along with Eddie, and Jamie Joseph \u2014 who I worked with at Highlanders in New Zealand \u2014 are coaches I always wanted to play more for.\n\nThere will be a lot of time spent on the breakdown this week, as both sides have huge turnover threats in the back row. Australia's Michael Hooper and David Pocock are guys I admire. The worst thing about them is that when you clear out one, the other pops up and they're so hard to get off the ball. England will be practising against this.\n\nAustralia's back-row pair of Michael Hooper (left) and David Pocock will be dangerous\n\nYou will have two reserves wearing bibs pretending to be those two. I spent my career being one of those bib men. I've been all the amazing players \u2014 Sergio Parisse, Schalk Burger, Duane Vermeulen, Jerry Collins, Richie McCaw... I am sure they'll be sorry to hear that I've been ruining their image!\n\nOften my sole job was to dip over the ball and try to steal it. The session would be touch, but if I went at the ball, the lads had a green light to smash me. It meant I was on my backside getting cleaned out a lot.\n\nI should have had danger pay, especially with the likes of Kyle Sinckler running around smoking people!\n\nIn Tom Curry and Sam Underhill, England have young guys who could go on to form a similar partnership to Pocock and Hooper. They're aggressive and they complement each other.\n\nSam's added ball-carrying to his game and is becoming the complete backrower. Tom is like a terrier \u2014 hard, fast and quick. Then Billy Vunipola adds the weight and just does what Billy does best.\n\nTom Curry (left) and Sam Underhill have impressed for England despite their young ages\n\nWith Tom, Sam and Billy, England should have too much for Australia. The Wallabies looked like world beaters against the All Blacks in the summer, but they lack consistency.\n\nWhen Hooper, Kurtley Beale and Tevita Kuridrani are firing, they can be awesome, but they have a tendency to implode. They do have a knack of getting it together against England. So what has gone before will not matter. It's game on.\n\nThe last time I played Australia was on the summer tour in 2016 when we won 3-0. Everyone talks about the English being arrogant but I was astounded by their demeanour. I'll never forget the video of all their ex-sportsmen laughing to a Rocky montage of them beating us. That was all the motivation we needed. That was early in Eddie's reign and now we are taken much more seriously.\n\nIt will be close, but I'm backing England by seven points.", "description": "JAMES HASKELL: Don't be fooled by Michael Cheika's nonchalant demeanour.
