His research and study of the cannabis plant has modernized cultivation practices. Politically, as a legalization pioneer and leading expert on growing cannabis who is based in California, Rosenthal has been the subject of highly publicized trials that shifted public opinion in favour of state medical marijuana laws.\n\nSays apollogreen CEO Tyler LeBlanc, \u201cHaving Ed join our team provides to us a wealth of knowledge, particularly about his innovative cannabis growing processes and research. As a champion for cannabis legalization for decades his experience is vital to the Canadian market.\u201d\n\napollogreen is an industrial-scale B2B micropropagation and genetics company that supplies premium quality (safe, lab-tested, and disease-free) cannabis and hemp starter plants to the global market.\n\nRosenthal says, \u201cWhat really excites me about the apollogreen group is its pursuit of innovation to increase production while maintaining the highest quality disease-free plants. I believe apollogreen will be recognized as a premier producer in Canada and internationally, which is why I joined the team.\u201d\n\napollogreen has now opened its 5,000 sq ft Phase 1 facility in Prescott-Russell and has begun the cultivation of plantlets. The Phase 2 building will be started after the next round of investment is complete. There will be a ribbon cutting ceremony of Phase 1 October 9th .\n\nAbout Ed Rosenthal\n\nIn the ultimate show of respect, Tommy Chong has said that Ed Rosenthal has turned more people on to pot than Cheech & Chong. But where Tommy goes for laughs, the legalization of medical and recreational marijuana has been a serious business for Ed \u2013 a.k.a. The Guru of Ganja.\n\nRosenthal has put his freedom on the line for the cause of cannabis. Deputized by the city of Oakland to cultivate starter plants so that for patients could grow their own medicine, he was arrested by federal authorities, tried and retried.\n\nThe unfairness of his treatment, and the resulting publicity, turned much of the public around on the subject. Ed\u2019s crusade has spanned the era of Just Say No and the War on Drugs to today\u2019s reality \u2013 where 11 U.S. states have legalized the recreational use of marijuana.\n\nWhile he has worked to change attitudes and act as an influencer, the Guru of Ganja has also earned a reputation as one of the most knowledgeable pot experts on the planet. A co-founder and sometime editor of High Times magazine, Ed is a renowned herb horticulturalist, whose practices have set the standard for home growing for a generation.\n\nHe has written dozens of books that millions of growers have used as their guide \u2013 the most influential being the Marijuana Grower\u2019s Handbook, the bible of the business. His syndicated column, Ask Ed is a must-read for anyone who wants to know the nuts and bolts of growing-your-own.\n\nHe continues to push the socially responsible side of cannabis activism. He has been a founder of several organizations dedicated to good works. These include the cannabis education publisher Quick Trade Publishing, the marijuana technology consulting company Quantum Nine, Green Aid: The Medical Marijuana Legal Defense and Education Fund and Amsterdam\u2019s Hash Marihuana & Hemp Museum.\n\nHis life\u2019s guiding principles remain to educate the public on the benefits of marijuana, to share his encyclopedic knowledge of the plant itself, and to fight laws that do far more harm than the plant itself could ever do.\n\nwww.apollogreen.com\n\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191008005627/en/\n\nContacts\n\nKimothy Walker\n\n613 859 3753\n\nKimothyAWalker@gmail.com", "description": "OTTAWA, Ontario \u2014 As apollogreen opens its Phase 1 state-of-the-art facility just off Highway 417 in Vars, near the Amazon Fulfillment Centre, the quickly growing genetics and cannabis micropropagation company is pleased to announce the addition of legendary cannabis social activist, educator...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20191008005627/en/748516/3/4102467capollogreen_logo_1_en.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
