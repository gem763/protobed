Sign up for the Today\u2019s WorldView newsletter.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is at it again. His countrymen will vote Tuesday in a second national election within six months following Netanyahu\u2019s failure to cobble together a stable coalition after an April vote in which he sneaked a narrow victory. Now, Israel\u2019s longest-ruling prime minister is resorting to his tried-and-tested tactics: stirring race-baiting fear over Arab voter fraud, hailing his unique ability to defend the nation (with President Trump\u2019s brotherly support) and dangling red meat to his right-wing base in the form of vows to annex portions of the West Bank.\n\nIn the final throes of the campaign, Netanyahu issued a rather surreal video instructing Israelis to make correct use of election day \u2014 a national holiday \u2014 by casting a ballot rather than canoodling in bed with their lovers. As Steve Hendrix, The Washington Post\u2019s new Jerusalem bureau chief, wrote, it was as if \u201cNetanyahu\u2019s final message has been: I\u2019m losing.\u201d\n\n\u05d2\u05e0\u05e5 \u05d0\u05de\u05e8 \u05d1\u05e8\u05d0\u05d9\u05d5\u05df \u05dc\u05d0\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9 \u05e1\u05d2\u05dc \u05e9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d0 \u05f4\u05d9\u05de\u05de\u05e9 \u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05de\u05d3\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea \u05e9\u05dc \u05de\u05e8\u05e6\u05f4.\n\n\n\n\u05e8\u05e7 \u05de\u05d7\u05dc \u05d2\u05d3\u05d5\u05dc \u05d9\u05de\u05e0\u05e2 \u05de\u05de\u05e9\u05dc\u05ea \u05e9\u05de\u05d0\u05dc \u05d5\u05e8\u05e7 \u05de\u05d7\u05dc \u05d2\u05d3\u05d5\u05dc \u05d9\u05e9\u05d0\u05d9\u05e8 \u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05d9\u05de\u05d9\u05df \u05d1\u05e9\u05dc\u05d8\u05d5\u05df. \u05e6\u05d0\u05d5 \u05dc\u05d4\u05e6\u05d1\u05d9\u05e2 \u05de\u05d7\u05dc! pic.twitter.com/cmM9WSegyQ \u2014 Benjamin Netanyahu (@netanyahu) September 16, 2019\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s desperation is real. He knows that he needs to stay in office to marshal the country\u2019s parliament into passing legislation that could insulate him from a series of ongoing corruption investigations. Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party is running neck-and-neck in the polls with the centrist Blue and White party; the prime minister can count on a number of parties even further to the right to back him in an alliance that would keep him in power.\n\nThough it\u2019s always a mistake to bet against his capacity for survival, there\u2019s one clear reason Netanyahu may be foiled this time: The party of Avigdor Liberman, a former cabinet minister in Netanyahu\u2019s government and a staunchly secular right-wing nationalist, may win enough seats to play the role of kingmaker. Liberman, whose refusal earlier this year to sit alongside ultra-Orthodox and other religiously minded parties in Netanyahu\u2019s coalition prompted this week\u2019s election, could throw in his lot with a possible alliance of secular mainstream parties and thereby doom Netanyahu to the sidelines.\n\nIn the hurly-burly of the election campaign, the tensions within Israel\u2019s Jewish population have come to the surface. \u201cWhen religion and state get more space in elections, it\u2019s always vitriolic,\u201d Einat Wilf, a secular centrist former Israeli lawmaker, said to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. \u201cPeople understand the implication that their way of life is in danger. So the rhetoric in many ways plays into real fears.\u201d\n\nWhile Netanyahu scaremongers over Arabs and leftists taking over the state, Liberman released a dark video urging supporters to counter the votes of the country\u2019s mobilized religious parties. These have propagated their own divisive messaging, featuring secular men disrupting children\u2019s ability to observe Shabbat.\n\n\u201cThe rifts are deepening, the gaps are widening and basic solidarity between us is unraveling: right against left, Jews against Arabs. The social fabric is torn,\u201d wrote Benny Gantz, the former Israeli military commander who is Netanyahu\u2019s chief rival. He called on Israelis to rally behind a more broad-minded government of unity: \u201cAfter years of extortion and surrender to small parties that care about limited sectors of society, we will establish a government to represent the majority and take care of all Israel\u2019s citizens.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the matter of those who don\u2019t have the same rights as Israeli citizens. \u201cAt stake in the election is not only the balance between religious and secular visions for Israel\u2019s future,\u201d wrote my colleagues Ruth Eglash and James McCauley. \u201cNetanyahu has promised, if reelected, to upend the longtime status quo in the occupied territories by annexing large portions of the West Bank, an initiative that would be popular with right-wing voters but could incur Arab outrage. When he announced these grand designs, he cited the approval of the Trump administration, slated to release its new Middle East peace plan after the Israeli election.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s ambassador in Israel, David Friedman, is an envoy with close ties to Jewish settler organizations. He has publicly cheered plans for annexation and in the past has dismissed the two-state solution \u2014 the vision of an independent Palestinian state emerging alongside Israel that has been the official policy goal of successive U.S. administrations \u2014 as a \u201cscam.\u201d For years, the Israelis have mastered their system of control over the Palestinians without too much international blowback over human rights; annexation, though, could change that.\n\n\u201cThis limbo where Palestinians are not citizens of Israel and not ruling themselves \u2014 it was supposed to be temporary, in theory,\u201d Yehuda Shaul, co-founder of Breaking the Silence, an Israeli group that gathers testimony from past and serving Israeli soldiers to shed light on the occupation of the Palestinian territories, told my colleagues. \u201cAnd Netanyahu basically came out in his speech saying it\u2019s not temporary.\u201d\n\nMany of Israel\u2019s supporters in the Washington foreign-policy establishment fear that a Netanyahu emboldened by Trump would confirm a dark reality. \u201cIf Benjamin Netanyahu succeeds in prolonging his tenure as Israel\u2019s prime minister following Tuesday\u2019s election, the proposition that Israelis and Palestinians will be condemned to live in one state forever is likely to become inescapable,\u201d wrote Jackson Diehl, The Post\u2019s deputy editorial director. \u201cThat would mean a choice between a country that is secular and democratic but binational, or a Jewish apartheid regime.\u201d\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s existence as the leader of Israel has diminished any hope for a two-state solution and we can\u2019t be expected to be silent about that! https://t.co/A6pVIGWc59 \u2014 Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) September 15, 2019\n\nA victorious Netanyahu could renege on his annexation vows and return to a pre-election status quo. But, as Robert Kagan wrote in a lengthy essay for The Post over the weekend, there are fewer incentives now for such caution than in the past. As readers of Today\u2019s WorldView know, Netanyahu has curried the favor of various majoritarian, nationalist, illiberal rulers around the world, from India to Russia to Hungary to the Oval Office.\n\n\u201cThe right-wing nationalist movements in Europe are staunchly pro-Israel even as they maintain historical anti-Semitic tendencies,\u201d wrote Kagan. \u201cThey admire Israel\u2019s combative nationalism and its plucky resistance to their common enemy, the European Union. Even Germany\u2019s far-right nationalists these days see an increasingly nationalist Israel as \u2018a role model for Germany.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIn the West Bank, my colleagues report the air is heavy with resignation and defeat: For Ibrahim Qtishat, a 50-year-old date farmer in the Jordan Valley, \"there is no reason to believe Netanyahu was not serious about his plans, and the Palestinians have no means of countering any future attempt to execute that proposal.\n\n\u201c \u2018The whole world is supporting him,\u2019 he said.\u201d\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday, along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions?
