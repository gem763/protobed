It stated: \u201cDepending on the court\u2019s reasoning it would still either be open or not open to the prime minister to consider a further prorogation.\u201d\n\nLord Keen QC, representing the government, cautioned the justices that the English and Scottish applicants in the appeal \u201cwere inviting the court into forbidden territory\u201d. The decision to prorogue was political and not open to challenge in the courts, he declared.\n\nThe president of the supreme court, Lady Hale, promised that the court would deliver its ruling early next week. She added: \u201cI must repeat this case is not about when and on what terms the UK leaves the EU. We are solely concerned with the lawfulness [of prorogation].\u201d\n\nThe final afternoon saw a rapid sequence of exchanges between the justices, Keen and Pannick that exposed the lack of consensus over a pivotal process in the UK\u2019s unwritten constitution \u2013 particularly, who has the power to summon parliament back.\n\nIn his closing submissions, Keen said the judges should decline to become involved. \u201cWhether it is dissolution or prorogation [of parliament], this is forbidden territory \u2026 It is a matter between the executive and parliament.\n\n\u201cThe applicants and petitioners are inviting the court into forbidden territory and an ill-defined minefield that the courts are not properly equipped to deal with.\u201d\n\nThe court should read the \u201cauthentic and contemporaneous documents\u201d that had been prepared for the case, Keen said. He dismissed the \u201cdiscourteous and incendiary language\u201d deployed by the barrister for the Scottish applicants, Aidan O\u2019Neill QC, who accused the government of lying.\n\nEven if the supreme court found Johnson\u2019s advice had been unlawful, Keen maintained, the court should then leave it to the executive and parliament to respond. That suggestion prompted one justice, Lord Hodge, to ask how parliament could respond if it was prorogued and \u201cwouldn\u2019t be there\u201d.\n\nAnother justice, Lord Kerr, suggested that if the court found that Johnson\u2019s advice to prorogue had been unlawful that would consequently mean the prorogation instructions were also unlawful. The Scottish appeal court has already ruled that the prorogation is \u201cnull and void\u201d.\n\nThe question of what \u201crelief\u201d or \u201cremedy\u201d the courts should deliver if they find against the prime minister is complicated by the courts\u2019 reluctance to be seen to be trespassing on what many consider to be parliamentary privileges.\n\nPannick told the justices: \u201cWe would expect, in the light of a declaration [of unlawfulness], that the prime minister ensures that parliament resumes as soon as possible next week \u2026 We would ask that the court give an indication if it thinks it appropriate what it expects next week so that parliament will meet to decide what happens next.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cIt may be that the [Commons] Speaker and Lord Speaker will take action to ensure that parliament reopens as soon as possible next week and then parliament can debate and will decide exactly how it wishes to proceed.\u201d\n\nEarlier Lord Garnier QC, a Conservative former solicitor general who intervened in the case on behalf of Sir John Major, accused Downing Street of releasing \u201cmisleading\u201d statements about prorogation of parliament and publishing excuses for Johnson\u2019s five-week suspension of the Commons that \u201care not the true reasons\u201d.\n\nThe extraordinary clash of evidence from two Conservative prime ministers came as the court grappled with questions involving the trustworthiness of Johnson\u2019s newly appointed administration.\n\nThe Downing Street press office, Garnier told the court, had been \u201cmisleading\u201d in releasing announcements during the summer that initially suggested that reports of an extended prorogation were \u201centirely false\u201d.\n\n\u201cIts effect was plainly to mislead,\u201d Garnier added.\n\nSupreme court prorogation hearing: who are the judges? Read more\n\nAs to the cabinet minutes, which were subsequently published, Garnier said, they \u201care not the true reasons\u201d. The cabinet documents suggested that the need for a long suspension was to prepare for a Queen\u2019s speech and a break for the conference season.\n\nQ&A What is the UK supreme court and how does it work? Show Hide The supreme court of the United Kingdom was formally established on 1 October 2009. It is the ultimate court for hearing cases of the greatest public or constitutional importance, and is the final court of appeal in the UK, except for criminal cases heard in Scotland. The supreme court took over the judicial functions of the House of Lords, separating the judiciary from the legislature. It brought an end to the system of appealing to the \"lords of appeal in ordinary\" - commonly known as the law lords. The court comprises the president and deputy president and 10 other judges of the supreme court. Judges are appointed by the Queen on the advice of the prime minister, to whom a name is recommended by a special selection commission. The prime minister is obliged to recommend this name. The judgments in all decided cases from the court are published on the court's website.\n\nIn submissions to the high court earlier this month, Garnier obliquely compared Johnson to an estate agent, citing a 2009 New Zealand case of Premium Real Estate involving a salesman who misrepresented a buyer as a genuine purchaser when in fact they wanted to resell the property for a quick profit.\n\n\u201cIt could hardly be suggested that the duties of the prime minister to the monarch are less than those of an estate agent to a homeowner,\u201d Garnier noted. \u201cAccordingly, if the court is satisfied that the prime minister\u2019s decision was materially influenced by something other than the stated justification, that decision must be unlawful, irrespective of whether the unstated justification was itself legally impermissible.\u201d\n\nThe 11 justices now begin a behind-the-scenes debate among themselves to decide on their judgment. The process traditionally starts with the latest recruit to the supreme court bench \u2013 in this case Lord Sales \u2013 opening discussions with their initial conclusions and views. The bench is likely to be divided by such crucial, constitutional issues. In its article 50 decision in 2017, the supreme court ruling was returned by an eight to three majority.", "description": "Final arguments at supreme court raise question of who has power to bring parliament back", "authors": ["Owen Bowcott"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4b69f06a00a6d7b72fc5b64036e00972325f1c6/69_197_6322_3793/master/6322.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5ac383557008e5825657a86a88b60cb3", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
