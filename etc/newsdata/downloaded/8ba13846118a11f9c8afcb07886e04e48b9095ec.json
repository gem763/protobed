Although PiS is way ahead in opinion polls, the final outcome is still in doubt \u2014 and the extra-parliamentary session allows the government to push through legislation even if it loses power. The vote on the legislation is due on Tuesday.\n\nThe draft mining law gives Warsaw the power to circumvent local governments and communities if it decides that a mining project is important for \u201cthe raw material security of the country.\u201d\n\nThe government argues that the law is needed to slash red tape and provide greater certainty to investors. The explanation in the draft says it \"will make possible faster and more effective administrative procedures.\"\n\nBut skeptics are worried about the speed of the legislation \u2014 it's not going through consultations, and instead is being rushed through parliament as a private member's bill \u2014 and on its impact at a time when the rest of the EU is shifting away from coal.\n\n\"In 20 to 25 years, coal\u2019s share in the energy mix will go down to 40-50 percent because Poland [will] diversify its energy sources\u201d \u2014 Piotr Naimski, the government\u2019s adviser for strategic energy infrastructure\n\n\u201cThe effect will be accelerating the implementation of hard and lignite coal mining projects,\u201d said Janusz Buszkowski, a climate and energy lawyer from ClientEarth, an NGO.\n\nAbout 80 percent of Poland's electricity is generated by burning hard coal or even dirtier lignite \u2014 giving it the highest coal dependency in the EU. The government has promised to cut that to 50 percent in 2040, but that pace is at odds with the EU\u2019s push for carbon neutrality by 2050.\n\nPoland, along with the Czech Republic and Hungary, is blocking the 2050 initiative, and is holding out for generous EU compensation to finance decarbonization.\n\nPoland is also moving ahead with new coal-fired power generation installations, such as a 1,000-megawatt plant in the northern town of Ostro\u0142\u0119ka.\n\n\u201cCoal guarantees our energy security. In 20 to 25 years, coal\u2019s share in the energy mix will go down to 40-50 percent because Poland [will] diversify its energy sources,\u201d Piotr Naimski, the government\u2019s adviser for strategic energy infrastructure, said in London last month.\n\n\u201cWe want to carry out our energy policy the way we want to run it, not the way imposed on us by French or German companies,\u201d Naimski added.\n\nLocal governments are fuming at the prospect of Warsaw overriding their wishes.\n\n\u201cThis law will effectively end our planning powers,\u201d said Piotr Kuczera, the mayor of Rybnik in the western Polish region of Silesia, which sits atop some potential coal deposits that remain untapped.\n\nTo mine or not to mine\n\nLocal governments are whipsawed by conflicting demands \u2014 Warsaw's push to continue burning coal against growing grassroots and international pressure to cut coal use.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about the environment,\u201d said Kuczera. \u201cWe have taken care of former mining grounds, there are new companies coming to town, unemployment is 3.8 percent, we\u2019re no longer dependent on coal for our economy.\u201d\n\nPOLAND NATIONAL PARLIAMENT ELECTION POLL OF POLLS\n\nFor more polling data from across Europe visit POLITICO Poll of Polls.\n\nBapro, a privately held Polish company, is currently going through the permitting process to build a coal mine to extract an estimated 115 million tons of coal sitting under Rybnik. \u201cIf that new law passes, we won\u2019t be able to influence the process anymore,\u201d Kuczera said.\n\nThe government has tried to calm the regional backlash caused by the proposed law, explaining that it would only apply to coal deposits that have a strategic meaning for the country.\n\n\u201cThe law won\u2019t affect any [coal] deposits in Silesia and the Lesser Poland [Krak\u00f3w] regions,\u201d Deputy Energy Minister Adam Gaw\u0119da said in Rybnik on Tuesday. He said the law is being debated to make sure deposits of lignite in central Poland and hard coal in eastern Poland could be extracted in the future.\n\nSilesia is a key battle arena in the election; Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki is running for a parliamentary seat from the regional capital Katowice. A poor showing in Silesia could endanger PiS\u2019s chances of forming the next government.\n\nThe law appears aimed at Z\u0142oczew in central Poland, where there are potential lignite deposits seen a crucial for the future of the nearby power plant in Be\u0142chat\u00f3w \u2014 Europe\u2019s largest emitter of carbon dioxide. Be\u0142chat\u00f3w will run out of fuel in the mid-2030s, and the government wants to ensure continued operations of a plant that supplies a fifth of Poland\u2019s electricity.\n\nKuczera was skeptical of the government's scramble to calm voters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the election campaign and I\u2019m not surprised that is their reaction,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they wanted an open discussion, why are they skipping the consultation process by tabling it via a group of MPs, not the government? Why is the parliament working on it a day after the election?\n\n\u201cWe are ready now to replace coal with other sources of energy. And I\u2019m saying this as a mayor of a town where two coal mines are still operating and will operate for another 20-30 years,\u201d said Kuczera.\n\nThis article is from POLITICO Pro: POLITICO\u2019s premium policy service.
