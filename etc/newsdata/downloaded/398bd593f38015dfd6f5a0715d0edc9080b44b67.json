Going to court without a plan could delay and complicate the company\u2019s turnaround efforts.\n\nForever 21, with about 600 U.S. stores, would be one of the largest retail bankruptcies yet in a year rife with them, and could leave landlords with millions of additional square feet of vacant space. U.S. retailers have closed 8,567 stores in 2019, according to a Sept. 27 report from Coresight Research, more than all of last year. While the parties initially discussed closing at least 100 Forever 21 locations, that number could now be higher, the people said.\n\nRepresentatives for Forever 21 and Simon didn\u2019t respond to requests seeking comment, while Brookfield declined to comment.\n\nForever 21 was aiming to file for bankruptcy with an agreement in place to give its landlords a stake in the company while allowing co-founder Do Won Chang to retain a share, Bloomberg earlier reported. Negotiations with the mall operators have included questions over ownership and leadership of the company during and after its restructuring, as well as which stores to shutter.\n\nThe talks among Forever 21, lenders and its landlords are evolving rapidly, and the outcome may still change, the people said.\n\nThe Los Angeles-based retailer is now headed into the biggest sales period of the year, when it\u2019s essential to have well-stocked shelves and adequate staffing. Lenders watch holiday performance keenly, and a difficult season could weaken support from creditors and vendors.\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "Deal would give its two largest landlords, one being Brookfield, a stake in the company, sources said", "authors": ["Lauren Coleman-Lochner", "Eliza Ronalds-Hannon", "Scott Deveau", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/forever-21.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
