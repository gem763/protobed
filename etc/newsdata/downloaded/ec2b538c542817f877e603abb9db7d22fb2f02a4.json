Several other states supported Yost\u2019s request.\n\nA three-judge panel from the Cincinnati-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals noted that trial preparations have been made already and that Ohio did not object when counties in the state began making claims against the drug industry.\n\n\u201cIn view of these circumstances, we decline to exercise our discretion to deploy \u2018one of the most potent weapons in the judicial arsenal,\u2019\u201d the judges wrote, paraphrasing previous case law.\n\nYost reacted in a news released noting that the 6th Circuit did not say that Ohio\u2019s argument was incorrect or invalid, but that the trial court in Cleveland should address the issue.\n\nThe state is reviewing its options, he said.\n\nA ruling from a separate 6th Circuit panel rejected the argument from defendants that U.S. District Judge Dan Polster should recuse himself from the trial because of prejudice against the defendants in comments in court and to reporters.\n\n\u201cBut we must take his statements in context. Judge Polster equally placed blame on all parties, readily acknowledged that settlement efforts might not work, and acknowledged that both sides had compelling arguments,\u201d the panel said.\n\nOpioids, a category of drugs that includes prescription versions and illegal drugs such as heroin - have been linked to more than 400,000 deaths in the U.S. since 2000. Ohio has been one of the hardest-hit states.\n\n___\n\nGeoff Mulvihill reported from Cherry Hill, New Jersey.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A federal appeals court on Thursday denied two efforts that could have kept the first federal trial on the opioids crisis from starting as scheduled this month in Cleveland.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mark Gillispie", "Geoff Mulvihill"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/10/opioid_lawsuits-ohio_89574_c0-67-5386-3207_s1770x1032.jpg?0fb7884b9cc17afc6acdd686f578ccd57f0d9cd6", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
