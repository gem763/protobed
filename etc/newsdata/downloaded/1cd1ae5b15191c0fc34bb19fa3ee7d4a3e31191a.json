The station was quickly closed down as scuffles took place between protesters and police; the district\u2019s glitzy boutiques also brought down their shutters. A kilometer away, chanting crowds filled Admiralty station, which is situated by the legislature, main government offices, and the Chinese military garrison.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t let police think that what they do will scare us off,\u201d said Lita, a 19-year-old university student, as her friends broke up the paving slabs outside the Hong Kong Club. \u201cWe\u2019re doing this because the police beat and arrested our fellow protesters.\u201d\n\nAs night fell, police pursued protesters into the Causeway Bay retail district, firing tear gas as shoppers ran for cover.\n\nEarlier in the day, many protesters waved the Stars and Stripes and played \u201cThe Star Spangled Banner\u201d on speakers as they walked up Garden Road to the American legation. Marchers called on the U.S. to pass the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act\u2014a measure that would require Washington to annually assess the enclave\u2019s level of autonomy from Beijing and cancel its trading privileges if that autonomy is compromised.\n\nThe idea is to incentivize Beijing to keep its hands off the former British colony, because scrapping Hong Kong\u2019s privileges would economically hurt mainland China, which regards the city as a valuable entrep\u00f4t and capital market.\n\n\u201cWe hope Congress will pass the act. The session resumes next week, so this is good timing,\u201d one protester called Catherine told TIME. \u201cThe U.S. government treasures values like democracy, justice and human rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want the international community to care about what is happening in Hong Kong and to help us,\u201d said Kelli Lo, 28, who was waving two small U.S. flags. \u201cTrump can push China to step back.\u201d\n\nThe Hong Kong government issued a statement condemning \u201cthe illegal behavior of the radical protesters,\u201d expressing \u201cregret over the re-introduction of the Act,\u201d and reiterating \u201cthat foreign legislatures should not interfere in any form in the internal affairs\u201d of Hong Kong.\n\nIn a separate development, prominent campaigner Joshua Wong was arrested as he attempted to leave the territory on trip to the U.S. and Germany. In a statement released via his political party Demosisto, he said \u201cI was arrested by police for \u2018breaching bail conditions\u2019 this morning at the airport\u2019s customs and I am detained in custody now.\u201d\n\nHe said that he had been given prior approval for his trip and called the decision to detain him a \u201cdirect consequence\u201d of his \u201cpolitical prosecution.\u201d\n\nHong Kong has endured more than three months of unrest, which began as a campaign against a hated extradition bill but quickly escalated into a rebellion against the territory\u2019s unrepresentative, Beijing-backed government. The democratic movement is calling for universal suffrage as well as exoneration for all protesters arrested to date, and an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality in the handling of the protests. Many protesters also want self-determination, or even independence, for the territory, which was retroceded to China in 1997 after 156 years of British rule and promised a \u201chigh degree\u201d of autonomy as part of the handover deal.\n\nLast week, Hong Kong\u2019s top official, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, finally withdrew the extradition bill. (The proposed law would have allowed return of fugitives to mainland China and was therefore seen by Hongkongers as a tool to allow Beijing to round-up dissidents and critics.) But what was intended as a major concession to the protesters instead provoked scorn as many\u2014even pro-government politicians\u2014chastised Lam for doing too little, too late.\n\nThe call for U.S. intervention has infuriated Beijing, which regards the unrest in Hong Kong as a separatist color revolution, stirred up by hostile Western powers. But so far, the protesters show no signs of backing down.\n\n\u201cWhen the American Army comes,\u201d one protester scrawled Sunday outside the Bank of China, \u201cI\u2019ll lead the way.\u201d\n\n\u2014With reporting by Laignee Barron and Aria Hangyu Chen / Hong Kong\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Thousands marched on the U.S. consulate in Hong Kong Sunday, calling for Washington's help in their push for greater political freedom.", "authors": ["Time Staff"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/gettyimages-1173095834.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}
