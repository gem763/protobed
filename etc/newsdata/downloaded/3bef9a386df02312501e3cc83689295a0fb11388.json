It made a fortune with premium SMS services and Commandos, a real-time military tactics video game.\n\nFridman became one of the company\u2019s main shareholders and well as one of its main creditors.\n\nThen in 2014, telecoms firm Vimpelcom, which is also controlled by Fridman, abruptly cancelled or changed its contracts with one of Zed Worldwide\u2019s Russian subsidiaries, depriving it of significant revenues, prosecutors say.\n\nThose contracts had boosted Zed\u2019s revenues to such an extent that it planned to list on Nasdaq, securing a 140-million-euro ($157-million) loan in 2013, some of which came from a bank controlled by Fridman, prosecutors say.\n\nThey claim Fridman and Vimpelcom, which is now known as Veon, \u201cknew it would be impossible (for Zed) to honour this loan if there was a significant reduction in revenue from the Russian market\u201d.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Aware of everything\u2019 \u2013\n\nAs a result, Zed Worldwide filed for bankruptcy protection in June 2016, and four months later, entrepreneurs close to Fridman made a 20-million-euro purchase offer \u2014 which was \u201cmuch less than its value when the obstructions began,\u201d they say.\n\nIn a document sent to the court, Fridman\u2019s lawyers said their client \u201cis not nor has ever been a director neither legally nor in fact\u201d of the companies accused of deliberately driving down Zed\u2019s market value.\n\nBut prosecutors argued in their submission that Fridman \u201chides his control of criminal activities behind subordinates\u201d.\n\nInvestigators have analysed \u201ca series of WhatsApps and emails that show that Fridman was aware of everything that was happening,\u201d Grinda told AFP.\n\nThe case was opened when Zed founder Javier Perez Dolset filed a criminal complaint alleging there was a strategy to seize his company.\n\nBut he himself ended up being indicted on separate charges of fraud, a fact which Fridman has pounced on, accusing Dolset of making up \u201ca conspiracy theory\u201d.", "description": "Madrid (AFP) \u2013 One of Russia\u2019s most powerful tycoons, Mikhail Fridman, appeared in Spain\u2019s top criminal court for questioning on Monday", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/21/93ea26_mikhail-fridman-who-has-russian-ukrainian-israeli-nationality-has-listed-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
