Not only does it come with noise cancellation, the AirPods Pro sport a brand new design.\n\nAnd if you look at early online reactions on social media, the AirPods Pro's design is nothing short of hilarious.\n\nApple\n\nThe new design on the Apple AirPods Pro is largely courtesy of cushioned eartips (three sizes) that come in the box, in order to provide a customized, seamless fit into the user's ear. It's also the first time a pair of AirPods have come with eartips.\n\nIt's these eartips that are making the AirPods Pro look a bit funny, from the perspective of social media, which is flooded with hilarious memes comparing the Apple wireless headphone to a variety of familiar objects.\n\nDon't Miss 15.7 K SHARES 11.6 K SHARES 1.6 K SHARES 869 SHARES 567 SHARES\n\nHere are some of the most hilarious reactions to the new AirPods Pro design from Twitter.\n\nTwitter\n\nPeople thought the new AirPods Pro took inspiration for its design from the legendary Teletubbies. Interesting.\n\nTwitter\n\nOthers compared it to the plants from Plants vs Zombies mobile game -- probably the closest AirPods Pro resemblance so far, don't you think?\n\nTwitter\n\nMKBHD repeated the Plants vs Zombies theme with the AirPods Pro design, along with comparisons with a hairdryer and Pingu the Penguin cartoon. Not bad at all.\n\nTwitter\n\nAnd to sum up the early reactions on the Apple AirPods Pro, there was this hilarious tweet about the different versions of AirPods Pro coming up later down the hatch from Apple.\n\nDespite all the attention AirPods Pro seem to be having for their design right now, it boasts off a cool new feature -- it will tell you the exact eartip size you should have on the AirPods Pro, depending on the auditory response of your ear canal. If by example you have the tiny eartips on the AirPods Pro, which isn't ideal for the shape of your ear canal -- for perfect noise cancellation -- AirPods Pro will tell you that you need to replace your eartips. That's pretty cool, in our opinion.\n\nAirPods Pro go on sale on October 30 for US $249.", "description": "Apple just announced the AirPods Pro which is slated for release on October 30.
