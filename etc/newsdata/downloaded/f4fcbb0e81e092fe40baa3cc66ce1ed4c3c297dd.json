REUTERS/Ivan Alvarado\n\nProtesters detained the officers early on Thursday and held them at a cultural center in Quito that indigenous groups have used as a base in the highland capital.\n\nLooking scared, the officers were asked to take off their bullet proof vests and boots, according to Reuters\u2019 witnesses.\n\nComplaining about a lack of media coverage of police violence, indigenous leaders ordered TV journalists onto the stage and demanded that broadcasters show the scene live. At least three private channels complied.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to radicalize (the protests) with more force,\u201d Jaime Vargas, head of indigenous group Conaie, told the cheering crowd. \u201cI\u2019ve just ordered our partners in the Amazon to close all oil wells.\u201d\n\nIt was a sharp escalation of week-long protests against Moreno\u2019s decision to cut fuel subsidies as part of his efforts to reduce the fiscal deficit and make good on commitments in a loan deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\nAuthorities confirmed the officers were released after the body of an indigenous protester, who was killed in clashes on Wednesday, was taken to the assembly.\n\nThe protester, a man from the highland province of Cotopaxi, was one of four fatalities related to the unrest. Protesters mourned him in a massive street demonstration, with some of the police officers helping to carry his coffin among the crowds.\n\nMoreno has called for calm.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve said \u2018yes\u2019 to dialogue, but first there must be peace,\u201d Moreno told Colombian broadcaster RCN late on Thursday.\n\n\u2018REPRESSION\u2019\n\nThe unrest is the latest flashpoint in Latin America over unpopular structural economic reforms. Argentine President Mauricio Macri was trounced in an August primary vote amid stiff opposition to an IMF deal he signed last year.\n\nSince last week, security forces in Ecuador have turned tear gas and water cannons on protesters who have set up burning barricades and hurled stones at police lines.\n\nInterior Minister Maria Paula Romo apologized after police fired tear gas in safe areas for protesters. She said authorities have faced extreme violence from some, including about 600 people whom she said swarmed a military barracks late on Wednesday, wounding several military officers.\n\n\u201cI want to point out how unusual and atypical this is,\u201d Romo told a news conference. \u201cThere are sectors that are seeking out more violence.\u201d\n\nThe unrest has already slashed the Andean nation\u2019s oil production by 520,000 barrels and forced the government to relocate to the coastal city of Guayaquil.\n\nMore than 900 people have been arrested, though most have been released due to lack of evidence, according to the office of the ombudsman, a state institution that monitors conflicts.\n\nMore than 500 have been wounded, it said.\n\nThe Red Cross in Ecuador said the violence was so bad it had depleted its blood bank. It called on Twitter for donations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not used to this kind of repression,\u201d Ombudsman Freddy Carrion told Reuters by phone, blaming a state of emergency the government has imposed for fanning tensions.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t solve anything. It actually created a deeper spiral of violence on both sides.\u201d\n\nProtests erupted in the nation of 17 million people last week when truck drivers took to the streets over fuel price rises. But indigenous protesters have now taken the lead, with many walking from surrounding provinces to Quito.\n\nMoreno, 66, who succeeded leftist leader Rafael Correa in 2017, has repeatedly refused to restore the fuel subsidies, defending their elimination as part of overdue efforts to clean up finances.\n\nPast indigenous protests have brought down presidents in Ecuador, but Moreno says he is not quitting.\n\nWithout offering evidence, Moreno has accused Correa and Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro of plotting to oust him.\n\nSlideshow (23 Images)\n\nCorrea and Maduro have laughed off those accusations.\n\n\u201cThe guilty one is on the International Monetary Fund. Savage capitalism,\u201d Maduro said in a speech in Caracas on Thursday.\n\n(This story refiles to correct headline spelling of \u201cEcuadoreans\u201d, byline)", "description": "Indigenous leaders in Ecuador freed eight police officers after parading them before an angry crowd for several hours in retribution for a government crackdown on anti-austerity protests that have shaken President Lenin Moreno's government.", "authors": ["Henry Romero", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439514097&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A04W", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
