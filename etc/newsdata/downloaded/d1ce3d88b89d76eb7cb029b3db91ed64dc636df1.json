The Vietnamese at Dien Bien Phu. Washington's withdrawal from Long Island. What makes a military operation so perfectly complete that you can almost hear Shang Tsung himself say \"Flawless Victory\" in the back of your mind? A few criteria for the title of \"successful\" come to mind.\n\nFor one, it can't be an overwhelming win between two countries, one being vastly superior to the other. Sure, the United States completely crushed Grenada but who gives a s---? So the odds need to be close to evenly matched.\n\nSecondly, a pyrrhic victory isn't exactly what anyone would call a \"success.\" Yes, the British won at Bunker Hill, but they lost half of their men doing it. Also, if luck was critical to the outcome, that's not planning. The British at Dunkirk planned only to get a tenth of those men off the beaches.\n\nFinally, there needs to be some kind of military necessity, so Putin's \"Little Green Men\" don't count.", "description": "Military history is full of resounding victories won by outnumber, outmatched, or otherwise unlikely forces.", "authors": ["Blake Stilwell", "We Are The Mighty"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d83f0382e22af48530c64aa-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
