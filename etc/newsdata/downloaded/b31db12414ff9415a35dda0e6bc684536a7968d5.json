The U.S. has locked Turkey out of a program for advanced F-35 fighter jets to punish it for buying Russian S-400 missiles that Washington says could compromise intelligence gathered by American aircraft.\n\nErdogan met with Graham ahead of a possible gathering with Trump on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly this week. Graham praised Turkey as a \u201cvery important ally\u201d in the Middle East and said both countries may also \u201ctalk about about a free trade agreement.\u201d\n\nErdogan, meanwhile, is shopping around for alternatives to the F-35 that could draw him even closer to Moscow.\n\nPutin\u2019s Knights Joust in Istanbul Sky to Tempt Erdogan From NATO\n\nTurkey and the U.S. are also at loggerheads over how far to push American-backed Kurdish forces away from the Turkish border with Syria. Ankara views the Kurdish YPG fighters as enemies because of their links to the separatist PKK group Turkey has battled for decades. But the Kurdish force was critical to U.S. efforts to defeat Islamic State in Syria, and many in Congress opposed Turkey\u2019s attempts to weaken them and render them more vulnerable to any Turkish attack.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Selcan Hacaoglu in Ankara at shacaoglu@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Onur Ant at oant@bloomberg.net, Amy Teibel, Taylan Bilgic\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Senator Lindsey Graham, one of President Donald Trump\u2019s closest Congressional allies, met Turkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in an effort to mend an alliance most recently strained by Ankara\u2019s purchase of a Russian missile defense system.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to get them back in the F-35", "authors": ["Selcan Hacaoglu"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rrE97I9eCZMFqabzdLRqwQ--~B/aD0xNTAwO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/e8a311942c212a31feef8ebc143f1bcb"}
