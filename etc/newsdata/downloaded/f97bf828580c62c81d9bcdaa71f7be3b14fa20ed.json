The change in the wind meant the plane had to perform a go-around, which was the first time the co-pilot had experienced this, according to the report.\n\nAccording to the commander, the co-pilot seemed \u201cfine\u201d following the go-around, and gave no cause for concern about flying the next day.\n\nThe co-pilot reported that he felt \u201cincreasingly nervous\u201d about flying to and from Glasgow on the morning of the incident, but felt he had been \u201cover-thinking\u201d the need to do a good approach.\n\nThe AAIB reported that the flight back to Glasgow from Stansted began normally, but the co-pilot began to suffer from anxiety mid-flight. During the landing, when the commander mentioned \u201cwindshear\u201d due to typical turbulence around Glasgow, the co-pilot had an anxiety attack, according to the ambulance crew that met the plane on landing.\n\nThe AAIB concluded that the Airbus A319 aircraft landing safely, and the incident could have been avoided if the co-pilot reported as unfit for duty. It also reiterated the need for better communication between the co-pilot and the commander.", "description": "An easyJet\u00a0co-pilot suffered an\u00a0anxiety attack and left the cockpit as the plane carrying 148 passengers approached the runway, an accident report said.\u00a0 The co-pilot was operating a return flight from London Stansted airport to Glasgow when anxiety attack occurred, leaving\u00a0the captain\u00a0to perform a single pilot landing with the help of Glasgow air traffic control.
