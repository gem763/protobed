UPDATE 1-Australia's South32 coking coal output rises 8% on Illawarra ramp-up\n\n(Adds first-quarter details, production forecast)\n\nOct 17 (Reuters) - South32 Ltd on Thursday reported an 8% rise in coking coal production for the first quarter, as the miner ramped up output at its Illawarra project in New South Wales.\n\nProduction of the steel-making ingredient, known as metallurgical or coking coal, was about 1.7 million tonnes in the September quarter, compared with 1.5 million tonnes a year earlier. (https:// Illawarra operations, which account for nearly all of the company's coking coal output, rose 9% in the quarter.\n\nThe miner maintained its fiscal 2020 production forecast across all of its operations, with Illawarra expected to produce 7 million tonnes of coal for the year.\n\nThe company, spun off from mining giant BHP Group in 2015, saw output from its Dendrobium and Appin mines at Illawarra rise following infrastructure improvements.\n\nMeanwhile, the miner's aluminium production during the quarter was largely unchanged from last year, while Alumina production ticked up slightly.\n\nIn August, South32 announced a 25% decline in annual profit as the trade war between China and the United States hurt aluminium prices.", "description": "UPDATE 1-Australia's South32 coking coal output rises 8% on Illawarra ramp-up", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEB66095_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
