The device could also be confiscated during school hours for the next three business days.\n\nHowever, Jim Hendry, spokesperson for the Lester B. Pearson school board, said no cellphones will be kept overnight.\n\nThe school's governing board discussed the new policy in June and it was presented to Secondary 1 parents in late August, he explained. The plan was well-received and an email went out to everybody else, he said.\n\n\"It is unfortunate that the conversation is taking place on social media, with accurate and inaccurate information,\" Hendry wrote in an email to CBC.\n\n\"St. Thomas is a vibrant school community, and as always, is open for discussions with parents within the appropriate venues available.\"\n\nAny issues regarding health and/or safety will be considered a \"top priority\" at St. Thomas, he said, and any time a student needs to be reached, parents can do so through the appropriate cycle office.\n\nMixed reaction from parents\n\nThe policy is an unwelcome surprise for Marco Romani, whose son Massimo this week started Secondary 5 \u2014 Quebec's equivalent to Grade 11 \u2014 at St. Thomas. Marco Romani says he could understand a policy that bans cellphones in the classroom, but this new policy goes too far.\n\n\"It's very prohibitive. It's basically no cellphones period. That's the end of the story,\" Romani told CBC News.\n\nRomani says that, as a single parent, he communicates with his son via cellphone \u2014 sending reminders for orthodontist appointments and after-school commitments.\n\n\"I expect the students not to be on their phones while in class, but it's my understanding that the students use their phones any time they're out of class.\" Romani said.\n\nFor other parents, however, this policy is a step toward lessening teenagers' dependence on electronic devices.\n\nAnni Mills, whose son is starting Secondary 4 \u2014 or Grade 10 \u2014 at St. Thomas, says she hopes this new policy will change her son's digital habits, even outside of school.\n\n\"When they come home right away, instead of going to homework or going outside, they go straight to electronics,\" she said.\n\nShe has already implemented a similar policy in her household. From Monday to Thursday, when her children get home they place their electronic devices on the counter, and are not allowed to touch them for the rest of the night.\n\nThe only exceptions: her children can use them for homework, or if an activity \u2014 like sports practice \u2014 is planned.\n\n\"I think it's wonderful, and I think all of the schools should adopt it,\" Mills said.\n\n\"It's a really good place to start for everybody.\"\n\nSt. Thomas principal Marie-Jos\u00e9e Coiteux declined CBC Montreal's request for an interview about the new policy, but said in a statement that it was brought in because she was concerned about the presence of cellphones on student learning and health.\n\nShe also pointed out there is other technology available to students for educational purposes \u2014 like chrome books, smart boards and computers in the computer lab.\n\nFor his part, Romani remains skeptical.\n\n\"Smartphones are a part of life now.\" He said.\n\n\"Especially for younger people, that's something that is going to be with them for the rest of their lives. They need to be taught how to use it.\"\n\nMarco Romani, right, whose son Massimo started Secondary 5 this year at Saint Thomas High School in Montreal, says the new cellphone policy goes too far. (Submitted by Marco Romani)\n\nBroader discussion on cellphones in the classroom\n\nIn other parts of Canada, school cellphone use policies \u2014 if they exist \u2014 vary.\n\nOntario, for instance, will also be restricting them in classrooms across the province starting in November.\n\nA spokesperson from the Ontario Ministry of Education said in a statement that the ministry plans to \"restrict the use of cellphones and other personal mobile devices during instructional time.\"\n\nExceptions will be made be for educational purposes, health or medical purposes, or special needs, said the spokesperson.\n\nQuebec does not intend to follow Ontario's example.\n\nA spokesperson in Quebec's Education Ministry said in a statement to CBC News that an outright ban is inconsistent with the ministry's mission to educate and sensitize young people to these devices. The spokesperson said these devices are becoming a bigger part in young people's lives.\n\nHowever, Quebec's provincial government has expressed concern about the amount of time children are spending on mobile devices \u2014 with Junior Health Minister Lionel Carmant announcing in August that his ministry will be looking into ways to tackle youth screen addiction.", "description": "Some parents say the cellphone ban policy of a high school on Montreal's West Island goes too far, while others say it's a good start in tackling screen dependence, a concern raised by other provinces and schools.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5140780.1558470258!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/teen-cell-phones.JPG"}
