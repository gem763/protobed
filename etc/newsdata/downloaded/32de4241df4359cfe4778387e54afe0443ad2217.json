Kay Ivey (R-AL) adamantly vowed on Tuesday that she would not resign her office, despite revelations last week that she once appeared in blackface in a college Baptist Student Union skit while she was a student at Auburn University. The national Republican leaders who demanded a Democratic governor resign for a very similar scandal have suddenly changed their minds on whether this is a forgivable offense.\n\nIvey, at her first public appearance since releasing a video message apologizing for the 1967 incident, said, \u201cHeavens no, I\u2019m not going to resign. It\u2019s something that happened 52 years ago and I\u2019m not that person. My administration stands on being inclusive and helping people.\u201d\n\nIvey\u2019s record has been anything but inclusive: she vocally opposed the LGBTQ \u201cagenda\u201d and \u201clifestyle,\u201d signed a bill allowing adoption agencies to discriminate on \u201creligious freedom\u201d grounds, and ran a 2018 campaign ad boasting of her efforts to protect Confederate memorials.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, whose racist record and rhetoric has been a hallmark of his political career, backed Ivey on Friday, praising her as a \u201cvery, very high-quality woman\u201d who had already apologized.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut earlier this year, Trump and his handpicked GOP leadership showed no such forgiveness when a Democrat was in an almost identical position.\n\nIn February, Gov. Ralph Northam (D-VA) was thought to have been captured in a photo from his 35-year-old medical school yearbook page showing a man in blackface and another man dressed in Ku Klux Klan robes. Northam apologized for the photo, though he later claimed he did not believe he was in either picture. He did admit to \u2014 and apologize for \u2014 wearing blackface to imitate Michael Jackson once.\n\nTrump called Northam\u2019s actions \u201cunforgivable\u201d at the time.\n\nDemocrat Governor Ralph Northam of Virginia just stated, \u201cI believe that I am not either of the people in that photo.\u201d This was 24 hours after apologizing for appearing in the picture and after making the most horrible statement on \u201csuper\u201d late term abortion. Unforgivable! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2019\n\nRNC Chair Ronna McDaniel, who has thus far been silent on the Ivey controversy, tweeted more than a dozen times demanding Northam\u2019s immediate resignation.\n\nAfter 11 DAYS of bipartisan calls for him to resign, Democrat Ralph Northam now says, \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d He is a disgrace to Virginia. Northam must resign. \u2014 Ronna McDaniel (@GOPChairwoman) February 11, 2019\n\nDisgraced Democrat Ralph Northam is STILL holding onto power \u2013 and it\u2019s not helping Virginia heal. There have been bipartisan calls for his resignation for TWO WEEKS. This shouldn't be a partisan issue. He needs to resign. \u2014 Ronna McDaniel (@GOPChairwoman) February 15, 2019\n\nAnd then-RNC spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany (now Trump\u2019s campaign secretary) has also been silent on Ivey\u2019s scandal, despite demanding that Northam step down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for the Democratic governor to step down. It\u2019s time for him to resign,\u201d she urged, during a February MSNBC interview. \u201cThere\u2019s no place in society for those images. There\u2019s no place in society for those beliefs and he\u2019s got to stop down.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/48632076452_f7e21b71f7_b.jpg?w=1024&h=769&crop=1"}
