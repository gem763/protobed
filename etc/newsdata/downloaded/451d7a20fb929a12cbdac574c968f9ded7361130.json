We all know about the Trump-Ukraine issue that launched the House Democrats\u2019 formal impeachment push. In that phone call, Trump supposedly threatened to withhold aid unless the Ukrainians opened up an investigation into Hunter Biden. A transcript of the call debunked this shoddy allegation. There was no quid pro quo and now Trump asked the Australians to help the Department of Justice in their probe of the origins of the Russia collusion circus (via NYT):\n\nPresident Trump pushed the Australian prime minister during a recent telephone call to help Attorney General William P. Barr gather information for a Justice Department inquiry that Mr. Trump hopes will discredit the Mueller investigation, according to two American officials with knowledge of the call. The White House restricted access to the call\u2019s transcript to a small group of the president\u2019s aides, one of the officials said, an unusual decision that is similar to the handling of a July call with the Ukrainian president that is at the heart of House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump. Like that call, the discussion with Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia shows the extent to which Mr. Trump sees the attorney general as a critical partner in his goal to show that the Mueller investigation had corrupt and partisan origins, and the extent that Mr. Trump sees the Justice Department inquiry as a potential way to gain leverage over America\u2019s closest allies. And like the call with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, the discussion with Mr. Morrison shows the president using high-level diplomacy to advance his personal political interests. President Trump initiated the discussion in recent weeks with Mr. Morrison explicitly for the purpose of requesting Australia\u2019s help in the Justice Department review of the Russia investigation, according to the two people with knowledge of the discussion. Mr. Barr requested that Mr. Trump speak to Mr. Morrison, one of the people said. It came only weeks after Mr. Trump seemed to make military aid to Ukraine contingent on Mr. Zelensky doing him the \u201cfavor\u201d of helping Mr. Barr with his work.\n\nBreaking News: President Trump pushed Australia's prime minister to...cooperate with an active DOJ investigation.\n\n\n\ngood heavens when will the lawlessness end https://t.co/9udvxcH22G \u2014 Andrew Clark (@AndrewHClark) September 30, 2019\n\nThe Obama admin & Hillary's campaign solicited & used made up dirt on @realDonaldTrump from foreign nationals & governments\n\n\n\nNow trying to get to the bottom of this gross abuse of power where Democrats SPIED on Republicans is being turned into a scandal against POTUS?\n\n\n\nInsanity! \u2014 Elizabeth Harrington (@LizRNC) September 30, 2019\n\nWell, first, there\u2019s nothing illegal here. Second, the Mueller report did have partisan origins. It started as an FBI counterintelligence probe into Russian collusion and disgraced ex-FBI Agent Peter Strzok was a key person who signed off on it. Sztrok and his mistress, former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, exchanged tens of thousands of texts, anti-Trump in nature, and meant exactly how they read, according to Page. She has since resigned from the FBI. Strzok was fired over the exchanges. It was these texts that showed election meddling might not have been coming from the Kremlin, but the J. Edgar Hoover Building. That\u2019s what AG Barr is trying to figure out. Strzok and Page also mentioned an \u201cinsurance policy,\u201d which many have alleged is a reference to the Trump dossier that was used to secure a FISA spy warrant against Carter Page, a former foreign policy adviser for the Trump campaign. It was not verified. It was a political opposition research project funded by the Democrats and the Hillary Clinton campaign. So, yeah\u2014totally out there to view the Mueller probe as a partisan witch hunt. It was. Stack those sandbags, folks. The Left is going to make another hard impeachment push, even if it makes them look like total fools.", "description": ".09/30/2019 20:05:29PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann", "Leah Barkoukis", "Julio Rosas"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/269/41724fc8-1a25-4051-aed9-4d70fd822625.png", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
