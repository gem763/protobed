It has gained Royal Assent. He has done his level best to wreck this country\u2019s chances of a successful negotiation.\n\n\u201cBy his own logic and his own argument, he must now back an election.\u201d\n\nTurning his fire on backbench Labour MPs, the PM added: \u201cMost of them don\u2019t want it because they fear he will lose.\n\n\u201cBut a small and sensible minority don\u2019t want it because they\u2019re terrified he might actually win.\u201d\n\nBoris added: \u201cI will not ask for another delay.\n\n\u201cIf honourable members want another delay, the only proper way to do this is to ask permission from our masters, the voters.\u201d\n\nBoris accused them of running scared from the voters, attacking them for all having \u201cyellow bellies\u201d, as well as \u201ccoming up with ever more outrageous excuses for delaying an election until hell freezes over\u201d.\n\n12 Mr Johnson has promised to deliver Brexit with or without an agreement by October 31\n\n12 Jeremy Corbyn said he will not vote for a General Election that would take place before October 31\n\nHitting back Mr Corbyn insisted: \u201cI want to turf out this reckless government. But we will not walk into his trap\u201d.\n\nBut some Tories also spoke out against the PM\u2019s election bid, warning it may not solve the nation\u2019s Brexit splits.\n\nFormer Tory minister Sir Alan Duncan was one, and branded Brexit \u201cthe most divisive, poisionous and difficult issue of our life\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cIt is pushing our entire party system to the point of collapse\u201d.\n\nElsewhere tonight Mr Johnson lashed out at MPs as they were set to saddle Britain with a \u201czombie\u201d Parliament for another three months.\n\nDespite being bitterly deadlocked on Brexit, the Commons was on course to turn down the PM\u2019s plea for a snap general election, and for the second time.\n\nInstead of a nationwide poll on October 15, the snub means an election will now only be possible at the end of November at the earliest.\n\nWith the Queen\u2019s permission, the PM suspended Parliament for five weeks until October 14 as soon as the vote ended.\n\nIf MPs vote for an election as soon as they return, the earliest it could be held would be on November 21 as the campaign must be five weeks long.\n\nLeading the boycott, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn insisted a new rebel law to block No Deal on October 31 must be in place before any election takes place.\n\nAnd hours before Parliament was formally prorogued, the controversial law that delays Brexit by three months until January 31 went live when it was formally given royal assent.\n\n\n\nHERCULEAN TASK</h2\n\nEarlier today Mr Johnson said a No Deal Brexit would be failture for both the British and Irish governments.\n\nThe prime minister was in Dublin for his first meeting with Irish PM Leo Varadkar since he entered Number 10.\n\nThe Taoiseach described the task ahead as \"very tough\" but said Ireland wanted to be Britain's \"friend\" and \"ally\".\n\nMr Varadkar also appealed to the PM's love of Winston Churchill and the classics, with an Irish anecdote about Britain's great wartime leader after referring to Ireland as the UK's \"Athena\".\n\nBoris said No Deal would be a \"failure of statecraft\" for both sides and told the Irish PM: \"I have one message that I want to land with you today Leo and that is that I want to find a deal.\n\n\"I want to get a deal, like you I\u2019ve looked carefully at No Deal and assessed its consequences for our country and yours.\n\n\"Yes we could do it [get through No Deal], we could get through it, but that outcome would be a failure of statecraft of which we would all be responsible.\"\n\nThe pair have spoken over the phone twice but the backstop remains the main stumbling block in their negotiations.\n\nMr Varadkar said he would listen to \"alternatives\" to the backstop but they must be \"realistic\".\n\nMr Johnson said that whatever the alternative the UK will \"never never ever institute checks on the border and I hope our friends at the EU will say the same.\"\n\nHe added the UK's \"commitment to the peace process is unshakeable.\"\n\nLETS MAKE A DEAL\n\nBoris' message to Brussels comes after Amber Rudd claimed No10 was devoting \"80-90 per cent\" of its time to planning for a No Deal Brexit.\n\nThe work and pensions secretary resigned in disgust over Boris' purging of the 21 Tory rebel MPs that voted against the government in a dramatic Commons showdown last week.\n\nShe told the BBC: \"There is a huge amount of planning in getting No Deal. But I have not seen enough planning in actually getting deal.\"\n\nThe PM's call for a deal could also jeopardise a potential election pact with the Brexit Party.\n\nLeader Nigel Farage has promised the Tories a 100-strong majority if Boris delivers a \"clean break\" No Deal.\n\nHowever, senior chiefs have denied any chance of an alliance with Home Secretary Sajid Javid insisting the party can \"stand on our own two feet\".\n\nMOST READ IN POLITICS WHAT A BERK!

KORMA OVER Priti Patel to introduce 'vindaloo visas' to save the nation's curry houses\n\nMr Johnson has repeatedly refused to broker a deal with Brussels unless the hated backstop is ditched from any Withdrawal Agreement.\n\nHe has warned Dublin and Brussels that Britain will be leaving the bloc \u201cdo or die\u201d by October 31.\n\nLast week the PM said he would rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d than go begging to EU chiefs for an extension.\n\nWhat is the Backstop? The Irish backstop is essentially a safety net that would prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit.\n\nIt is one of the most controversial elements of Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal and has been a constant stumbling block between No10 and Brussels.\n\nUnder May\u2019s deal, the UK would enter a transition period after officially leaving the EU where it would remain a member of the bloc\u2019s economic zones - namely the single market and the customs union.\n\nThis would give the government time to agree the details of our new trading relationship with Brussels.\n\nThe backstop would come into effect if the transition period ended before all the details of the new relationship had been worked out.\n\nNorthern Ireland would then remain a member of the single market until a trade agreement had been reached to keep the border effectively invisible.\n\nThat would mean goods crossing the Irish border would not be subject to checks for customs or product standards.\n\nThe whole of the UK would also remain in a common customs territory with the EU, meaning there would be no \"tariffs, quotas, rules of origin or customs processes\" applied to UK-EU trade.\n\nThe arrangement would keep the Northern Irish border open, but would mean the UK would temporarily have to go on following the EU's rules and regulations without having a say in deciding them.\n\n12 Boris Johnson arrives back in Downing Street after a Brexit summit with Irish PM Leo Varadkar Credit: PA:Press Association\n\n12 Boris Johnson meets Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar in Dublin this morning Credit: PA:Press Association\n\n12 Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar hold crunch Brexit talks in Dublin\n\n12 Labour boss Jeremy Corbyn leaves home in Islington, North London, this morning Credit: Reuters\n\n12 Brexit protesters outside Parliament this afternoon Credit: AFP or licensors\n\n12 Boris Johnson described a No Deal Brexit as a 'failure' Credit: Getty Images - Getty\n\n12 Boris Johnson told Leo Varadkar that No Deal would be a 'failure' for both sides Credit: PA:Press Association\n\n12 The two leaders are holding their first meeting since Boris became PM in July Credit: PA:Press Association\n\n12 Varadkar said Ireland would be the UK's 'friend' and 'ally' during Brexit talks Credit: Getty Images - Getty\n\nBoris Johnson tells Leo Varadkar we must get Brexit done as he arrives in Dublin for talks with Irish PM\n\nWe pay for your stories!
