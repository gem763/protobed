And if you use language that \u201cdumbs you down,\u201d you may be misunderstood by those around you at work, which can significantly hurt your ability to advance.\n\n\u201cA well-spoken person never goes out of style,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cWhile it can be tempting to use shortcuts when speaking, go into slang mode, or just follow the crowd, you should try not to.\u201d\n\nUsing the following words and terms can chip away at your professional image, she says. \u201cWe\u2019re all capable of falling into these traps, but the trick is to catch yourself and avoid making them a habit.\u201d\n\nHere are 39 words and phrases we all use from time to time that may be dumbing us down:\n\n\u2018Legit\u2019\n\n\u201cIt just doesn\u2019t convey a high degree of intelligence,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cYou\u2019ll be seen as far more credible when you\u2019re direct and speak professionally.\u201d\n\n\u2018OMG, shut up!\u2019\n\nYou never want to use this to tell someone to be quiet at work \u2013 but that\u2019s not even what we\u2019re talking about here.\n\nIf you\u2019re genuinely surprised or excited by something at work, there are better ways to express your those feelings than saying something dumb like, \u201cShut up?!?!\u201d\n\nInstead, try \u201cWow, that\u2019s great!\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m so thrilled about this opportunity!\u201d\n\n\u2018!@%&$\u2019\n\nAvoid vulgar language and profanities at work. They\u2019re unprofessional and dumb you down.\n\n\u201cHaving a trash mouth never got anyone promoted, and can get you into trouble at work. Save it for your ride home (unless you take mass transit),\u201d Taylor said.\n\n\u2018Ditto\u2019\n\nIf you\u2019re trying to say \u201cme, too\u201d then say \u201cme, too.\u201d\n\n\u2018Oh my God!\u2019\n\nThere are many better, smarter ways to express your shock or excitement.\n\n\u2018My bad\u2019 or \u2018oopsies\u2019\n\nThese are two of the worst ways to own up to or acknowledge a mistake at work. Go with the most straightforward and professional version: \u201cThat was my mistake. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\u2018Whatever\u2019\n\n\u201cThis is part of a \u2018set\u2019 or family that goes with \u2018Totally,\u2019 \u2018Like\u2019 and \u2018Um.\u2019 A family that no one wants to visit,\u201d Taylor said.\n\n\u2018Chill out\u2019\n\nFirst of all, you almost never want to tell your boss or colleague to \u201crelax\u201d or \u201ccalm down\u201d because nobody likes hearing that. But if you\u2019re going to do it, don\u2019t use the phrase \u201cchill out.\u201d It\u2019s just obnoxious and unprofessional.\n\n\u2018Ironic\u2019\n\nChances are, you\u2019re not using it correctly, and you\u2019ll just sound dumb when you say it.\n\n\u2018Totally!\u2019\n\n\u201cAnother classic that hasn\u2019t parted from today\u2019s jargon, but can be reminiscent of walking through a mall bursting with teen drama,\u201d Taylor said.\n\n\u2018For sure\u2019\n\nJust stick with \u201cyes.\u201d\n\n\u2018No worries\u2019 or \u2018No prob\u2019\n\n\u201cI have fallen prey to this, and it\u2019s not a big offender,\u201d Taylor admitted. \u201cBut when it\u2019s used to replace \u2018you\u2019re welcome,\u2019 I fear that \u2018you\u2019re welcome\u2019 will fade into old English oblivion.\u201d\n\n\u2018Booyah\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s great to be happy at work. But when you\u2019re particularly excited or proud of something, don\u2019t yell out \u201cbooyah!\u201d It\u2019s annoying for so many reasons, Taylor said.\n\n\u2018Dude,\u2019 \u2018man,\u2019 or \u2018bro\u2019\n\nNo, no, no. Don\u2019t refer to your male colleagues as \u201cdude\u201d or \u201cman\u201d or worst of all, \u201cbro.\u201d\n\n\u2018Chicks\u2019 or \u2018girls\u2019\n\nThe same goes for \u201cchicks\u201d and \u201cgirls.\u201d It\u2019s highly offensive and inappropriate, even if you\u2019re a woman referring to other women this way.\n\n\u2018You guys\u2019\n\nWhile most of your coworkers likely won\u2019t take no offence to this, some people might feel uncomfortable being addressed this way \u2013 so you\u2019re better off avoiding it.\n\n\u2018Awesome\u2019\n\n\u201cGranted, it could be a lot worse,\u201d she said. \u201cBut this is one of those words that has gotten so overused, that when you say, \u2018That\u2019s awesome,\u2019 it\u2019s almost like saying, \u2018Nice \u2026 what else?'\u201d\n\n\u2018Whattup?\u2019 or \u2018sup?\u2019\n\nStop with the slang.\n\n\u2018Um\u2019 or \u2018uh\u2019\n\nWe understand you sometimes use these as filler words when you\u2019re nervous, and you may feel like you can\u2019t control the number of \u201cums\u201d and \u201cuhs\u201d you use on a daily basis, but you can try!\n\nOverusing these words will make you sound less competent and can kill your credibility, so you\u2019ll want to pay attention to how frequently you use them, and take the right steps to stop saying them forever.\n\n\u2018Literally\u2019\n\n\u201cThis makes you wonder how much productivity time in corporate America could be gained if this useless word could be \u2018literally\u2019 banished,\u201d Taylor says.\n\n\u2018Spoiler alert\u2019\n\nThis phrase can sometimes be funny or cute, but it often comes off as cheesy, which can make you seem a little less intelligent.\n\n\u2018Like\u2019\n\nThis is, like, another filler word you\u2019ll want to stop using, like, immediately.\n\n\u2018Duh\u2019\n\nDo we really need to explain this one?\n\n\u2018Yup,\u2019 \u2018yah,\u2019 \u2018nope,\u2019 and \u2018nah\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno.\u201d That\u2019s all.\n\n\u2018Shout-out\u2019\n\n\u201cNo one really needs to shout if they\u2019re congratulating you,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cSo let\u2019s put this phrase to rest.\u201d\n\n\u2018I know, riiight?!\u2019\n\n\u201cWell-meaning people use this when they\u2019re trying to be very agreeable. But when it\u2019s virtually in every other sentence, it can seem hollow and irritating,\u201d Taylor said.\n\n\u2018Extra\u2019\n\nAny word that\u2019s currently \u201ccool\u201d in popular culture should be \u201creserved for a dorm room, not a board room,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nMade-up words\n\nJust \u2026 don\u2019t.\n\nMisused words\n\nIf you\u2019re not really sure what a word means, don\u2019t use it.", "description": "Business Insider - Stop saying these things, like, legit, right now..
