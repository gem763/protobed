According to Variety, Steinfeld has been offered the lead role in its Disney+ Hawkeye series. If she accepts, the Transformer wrangler would play Kate Bishop, who succeeds Jeremy Renner\u2019s Clint Barton and takes up the bow and arrow as the new Hawkeye. (In the comics, the character is also a member of the Young Avengers, which means franchising opportunities and a possibly very long contractual commitment!) Studio execs must have watched Bumblebee and said, \u201cThat girl has moxie! Draw up a contract!\u201d Any other platforms with a \u201c+\u201d in their title have something to offer Steinfeld? We know HBO is going with \u201cMax\u201d for its premium streaming service, but they\u2019ve got a lot of upcoming programming to cast. Surely there\u2019s room for a combo Hawkeye/Spider-Gwen.", "description": "Hailee Steinfeld has reportedly been offered the lead role in the Disney+ Hawkeye series, where she would play Kate Bishop, the successor to Jeremy Renner\u2019s Clint Barton.", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/09/09-hailee-steinfeld.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
