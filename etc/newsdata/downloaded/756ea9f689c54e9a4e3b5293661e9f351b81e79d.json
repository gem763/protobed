Both parties had been in talks stretching into nights and weekends before coming to a tentative agreement.\n\nIt may not be the end of strikes in the automotive industry as late Friday the UAW said next on the docket are negotiations with Ford Motor Company.\n\n\u201cWe can confirm the UAW today notified Ford it plans to negotiate with us next,\u201d Ford said in a statement. \u201cAs America\u2019s No. 1 producer of vehicles and largest employer of UAW-represented autoworkers, we look forward to reaching a fair agreement that helps Ford enhance its competitiveness and preserve and protect good-paying manufacturing jobs.\u201d\n\nRoughly 57 percent of UAW members voted to ratify the contract. Unionized GM workers are expected to receive an $11,000 ratification bonus as part of the deal. Temporary workers will receive $4,500. The agreement calls for 3 percent wage increases or 4 percent lump-sum payments in the first four years of the contract, as well as profit-sharing and a pathway for temporary workers to become full-time employees.\n\nGM also affirmed plans to invest more than $7 billion in its U.S. operations.\n\n\u201cWe delivered a contract that recognizes our employees for the important contributions they make to the overall success of the company, with a strong wage and benefit package and additional investment and job growth in our U.S. operations,\u201d said Mary Barra, GM Chairman and CEO. \u201cGM is proud to provide good-paying jobs to tens of thousands of employees in America and to grow our substantial investment in the U.S.\n\nTicker Security Last Change Change % GM GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY 36.74 +0.92 +2.57%\n\nMany workers who are dismayed at the thought of GM closing more plants will be disappointed that the agreement does not include reopening the Lordstown assembly plant in Ohio.\n\nGM's Lordstown, Warren and Baltimore plants would go unallocated, per GM's original plan, while the Detroit-Hamtramck plant in Michigan, which was also going to be idled, would stay open and make electric trucks.\n\nThe future of temporary workers was a major sticking point \u2014 the agreement would provide full-time temporary workers with a pathway to permanent employment starting on Jan. 6, 2020. Part-time temporary employees would have a pathway to regular status beginning Jan. 1, 2021.\n\nGM also caved following workers' anger at being asked to share a larger portion of health insurance costs.\n\nIndustry expert Kristin Dziczek, of the Center for Automotive Research, said that the strike had some of its roots tied to GM's 2008 bailout.\n\n\"The union agreed to some changes to help GM and Chrysler get through some really tough times,\" she told FOX Business. \"And now that [GM has] had a decade of very positive financial results, the union members wanted their share for that. It was difficult for the company to claim poverty.\"\n\nThe strike cost GM roughly $1.5 billion in lost profits, and employees won't see more than $835 million in direct wage losses, according to Michigan-based consulting firm Anderson Economic Group. Their calculations extrapolate to Oct. 20.\n\nRoughly 49,000 UAW members walked off General Motors factory floors when the strike began.\n\nFOX Business' Grady Trimble and Jason Racki contributed to this report.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Both parties had been in talks stretching into nights and weekends.", "authors": ["Evie Fordham", "Thomas Barrabi"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/gary-jones-mary-barra-Getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
