Facebook said Monday that the company also will label state-controlled media as such on its platform, more clearly identify fact checks, and invest $2 million in media literacy projects.\n\nThe company said it will add more prominent labels on debunked posts on Facebook as well as on Instagram. It will put labels on top of what are deemed \u201cfalse\u201d and \u201cpartly false\u201d photos and videos.\n\nStarting with large pages in the U.S., Facebook said, it will add a new section about \u201corganizations that manage this page\u201d and provide more information about who is behind a page. The moves come after the company said it noticed groups and people \u201cfailing\u201d to disclose the organizations behind pages so people think they are run independently.\n\nIn a speech at Georgetown University last week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg outlined some of the challenges of fact-checking on its platform and noted that Facebook would not work to debunk claims made in political ads. Mr. Zuckerberg said Facebook\u2019s focus on authenticity and verifying its users was preferable to attempting to define what sort of speech is harmful.\n\n\u201cWe now require you to provide a government ID and prove your location if you want to run political ads or a large page,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said last week. \u201cYou can still say controversial things, but you have to stand behind them with your real identity and face accountability. \u2026 We now remove billions of fake accounts a year \u2014 most within minutes of registering and before they do much.\n\n\u201cAs a principle, in a democracy, I believe people should decide what is credible, not tech companies.\u201d\n\nCritics of Facebook\u2019s efforts have said the company has not gone far enough and that the company\u2019s problems stem from its business model, which is built on targeted ads and keeping users entertained and engaging with the content hosted on its platform.\n\nFacebook\u2019s right-leaning critics in the United States have accused the platform of unfairly blocking conservative content, while liberals have voiced concerns over Facebook\u2019s ubiquitous nature online as akin to a monopoly.\n\nMr. Zuckerberg has said that having all sides of the political divide \u201cangry at us\u201d means that the platform must be fair, and he has framed the future of the global internet as a choice dependent upon American values vs. Chinese values.\n\n\u201cUntil recently, the internet in almost every country outside China has been defined by American platforms with strong free-expression values,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said at Georgetown. \u201cThere\u2019s no guarantee that these values will win out. A decade ago, almost all of the major internet platforms were American. Today, six of the top 10 are Chinese.\u201d\n\nWhether any of Facebook\u2019s changes have an immediate impact remains to be seen. At least four people were killed Sunday in southern Bangladesh after security officials fired on protesters angry over a Facebook post allegedly undermining Islam\u2019s Prophet Muhammad, but the poster said his account was hacked.\n\nMr. Zuckerberg is scheduled to be back in Washington this week to testify before the House Financial Services Committee.\n\n\u2022 This article is based in part on wire-service reports.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
