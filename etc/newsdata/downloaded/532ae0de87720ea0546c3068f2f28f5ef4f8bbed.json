In comparison, at the start of 2015, buyers under 50 accounted for less than half of super-prime purchases, the estate agency and property consultant said.\n\n\n\nMore: This Eight-Acre Compound in California\u2019s Napa Valley Comes With a Winery Permit\n\nDriving the increase is a change in how wealth is created.\n\n\n\n\u201cSuper-prime buyers are getting younger because there are opportunities to make money in tech that are unrelated to your age,\u201d said Daniel Daggers of Knight Frank\u2019s private office in the report. \u201cAt the same time, mature wealthy individuals are increasingly passing on businesses and assets to the younger generations to enable them to travel and enjoy new experiences.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe increase in younger buyers comes amid the political uncertainty that has affected sentiment since the EU referendum in 2016.\n\n\n\nBrexit had been scheduled for Oct. 31. On Monday it was announced that the deadline had been extended again, until Jan. 31, 2020.\n\n\n\nBut the continuing uncertainty isn\u2019t holding back demand, which is continuing to build in London\u2019s super-prime sector.\n\n\n\nIn the third quarter of the year, there were 6.5 potential buyers for every new sale listing above \u00a310 million, the highest figure since the first three months of 2014, the report said.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: Great Escapes: France\u2019s Enchanting Loire Valley\n\nThe demand is being buoyed by the falling value of the pound.\n\n\n\n\u201cDollar-denominated buyers believe now is the right moment to buy U.K. real estate to capitalize on the weak pound,\u201d said Charles Penny, also of Knight Frank\u2019s private office. \u201cMany are taking the view that whatever happens with Brexit, any weakening of the pound will be quick to recover. If enough buyers fast-track their decision making, and supply continues to fall in the best postcodes, we could see a shift towards a sellers\u2019 market\u201d\n\n\n\nAs more high-net-worth individuals target London, the highest-value properties are seeing transactions increase.\n\n\n\nThere were 16 sales of homes priced above \u00a330 million in the year to May 2019 compared to 11 over the 12 months prior, the report said.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Liz Lucking"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-121438?size=1.5005861664712778&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
