Because \u201cif you assume the story is about generosity, it\u2019s easy to learn the wrong lessons: that it\u2019s O.K. for a child to take selfishly, and that adults should give until it hurts \u2014 and keep giving until they literally have nothing left to offer.\u201d Welp. Speaking of giving all of yourself to all of the things, we published our guide to time management for new parents who go back to work.\n\nIn health news, the Food and Drug Administration found low levels of a cancer-causing chemical in samples of Zantac, so our staff reporter Christina Caron asked experts what pregnant people with heartburn should do, and Jacob E. Osterhout wrote about five childhood ailments that don\u2019t require a visit to the E.R. Plus, Lisa Abramson shared her experience with postpartum psychosis. Scroll down for links to all of these stories, drop us a line with any questions and don\u2019t miss today\u2019s Tiny Victory.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n\u2014 Jessica Grose\n\nP.S.
