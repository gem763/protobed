Mario Alex Protello wrote.\n\nRichard Thompson, president and chief counsel of Thomas More Law Center, which filed the petition on Wood\u2019s behalf said, \u201cThe schools are promoting Islam over Christianity or any other religion, and you have a double standard, which we think is a violation of the establishment clause.\u201d Thompson also said in the firm\u2019s press release, \u201cUnder the pretext of teaching history or social studies, public schools across America are promoting the religion of Islam in ways that would never be tolerated for Christianity or any other religion.\u201d\n\nThompson said that on top of getting an F in the class, Wood was also made to watch a pro-Islam \u201cPowerPoint presentation that denigrated her religion and basically said that Christians are not as faithful as Muslims. So we strongly believed that this was a violation.\u201d\n\nFIVE FEEL-GOOD STORIES FROM THIS WEEK YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS\n\nThe Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in February that the assignment to write the Islamic conversion prayer ... did not violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.\n\nCharles County Public Schools released a statement after the Supreme Court's denial saying, \u201cThe decision reaffirms a favorable U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ruling earlier this year that the school did not \u201cimpermissibly endorse any religion and did not compel Wood to profess any belief.\u201d\n\nOne Muslim scholar strongly disagrees. Zuhdi Jasser, president of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy, said: \u201cThey made this the student recite the Islamic call to call of witness a prayer, which makes her a Muslim. That's absurd.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nJasser said the High Court should have taken the case. He said it would have been an opportunity to challenge the ideologies of a brand of Islam that has produced ISIS and other terror groups.\n\n\u201cThe theocratic interpretations of Islam are really what we need to defeat, which is the establishment of the Islamic leadership,\" Jasser added, \"and the Establishment Clause in America is really the \u2026 nuclear way to defeat political Islam.\u201d", "description": "Supreme Court rejects case of Christian Maryland student forced to write Muslim conversion prayer.", "authors": ["Lauren Green", "Lauren Green Currently Serves As Fox News Channel'S", "Fnc", "Chief Religion Correspondent Based In The New York Bureau.
