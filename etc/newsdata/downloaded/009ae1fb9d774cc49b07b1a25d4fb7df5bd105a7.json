Yet the economic failure of the Great Leap Forward and the famine and purges of the Cultural Revolution caused millions of deaths across the country.\n\nAfter Mao's death in 1976, the country slowly emerged from stagnation, with the reforms of Deng Xiaoping.\n\nCurrent President Xi Jinping came to power in 2012 and has since overseen China's emergence as global super power.\n\nA pyramid controlled from the top\n\nAround 7% of the population are members of the party - loyal membership is essential for anyone who wants to climb the career ladder - whether in politics, business or even entertainment.\n\nThat even goes for people like e-commerce giant Alibaba's Jack Ma, telecomm company Huawei's founder Ren Zhengfei or celebrities like actress Fan Bingbing.\n\nIf they are seen to go against party ideals, they have to publicly apologise to save themselves from secret detention and persecution, which is exactly what happened with actress Fan last year.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Fan Bingbing: the actress had to publicly apologise\n\nStarting from the local level, party organisations elect the higher-up bodies all the way to the leadership. The National Party Congress elects a central committee which in turn elects the politburo.\n\nThese elections are usually decided and approved beforehand and the real powers rest with the politburo.\n\nAt the very top is President Xi. In 2017, the party cleared the way for him to become president for life.\n\nThe party also voted to enshrine his name and ideology in the constitution, elevating him to the level of founder Mao Zedong.\n\nThe all-powerful politburo\n\nThe Communist Party controls the country from government to police to military.\n\nAt the top, the politburo ensures the party line is upheld and controls three other important bodies:\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The Chinese Communist Party has ruled the country since 1949\n\nThe State Council is the government, headed by the premier - currently Li Keqiang - who is junior in rank to the president.\n\nIts role is the implementation of party policies across the country, for instance managing the national economic plan and the state budget.\n\nThe link between military and party dates back to World War Two and the subsequent civil war. The close ties are institutionalised by the Central Military Commission, leading China's armed forces.\n\nIt has control over the country's nuclear arsenal and its more than 2 million troops, the world's largest military.\n\nA tight grip on public opinion\n\nThe Communist Party does not tolerate dissent. No true opposition parties are permitted and critics of the government risk persecution.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption President Xi has unrivalled power in China\n\nRepression of those who speak out against the authorities shows no signs of abating and a crackdown on human rights has intensified under President Xi.\n\nThe crackdowns also don't spare high-ranking party members. Bo Xilai, once a powerful regional party chief, was found guilty of corruption and abuse of power in 2013 in a show trial and sentenced to life in prison.\n\nChina insists it is upholding human rights and justifies its harsh hand on dissent by saying that lifting millions out of poverty trumps individual liberties.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Journalist Karoline Kan explains how Chinese social media is censored.\n\nMedia and the internet - including social media - are tightly controlled; China's \"Great Firewall\" internet censorship controls access to many Western news websites, as well as Google, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter.\n\nThe digitalisation of everyday life allows the party to implement advanced surveillance technologies culminating in plans for a social credit system.\n\nThis near-total control of media has helped the Party sway public opinion and enforce control.", "description": "We look at what role China's Communist Party plays, how it is run and how it runs the country.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/D658/production/_109027845_gettyimages-1151691179.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
