Chinese markets are closed until Oct. 7 for public holidays.\n\nTo counter losses from the trade war and regain export competitiveness, the People\u2019s Bank of China has consistently set the yuan\u2019s mid-point rate above the key 7 per dollar rate, allowing it to fall about 2% after Washington labelled it a currency manipulator in August.\n\nThe Sept. 24-Oct. 3 poll of over 60 foreign exchange strategists showed the yuan CNY=CFXS will be about 1% weaker at a more than decade-low of 7.20 against the dollar by end-2019. It closed Monday at 7.15.\n\nThe currency is forecast to hover around the same rate by March 2020 and then appreciate to 7.16 per dollar by this time next year.\n\n\u201cThe yuan is being held up by string, bogies and glue. The trade war is going to get worse,\u201d said Michael Every, head of financial markets research, Asia-Pacific at Rabobank, who was the most pessimistic forecaster for the 12-month horizon at 7.75, not seen since early 2007.\n\n\u201cThere will be more downward pressure on the yuan and when that happens. It is bad news for all emerging market currencies.\u201d\n\nAnalysts were divided on expected moves in U.S.-China trade relations, with over 60% anticipating further deterioration or a continuation of the status quo and the rest forecast an improvement.\n\nForecasts for where the yuan will trade in a year were divided too, with 31 of 60 respondents expecting it to weaken further and 29 respondents seeing the yuan gaining from here.\n\n\u201cI think that there might be some signs in the shorter term to say that things will be the same or perhaps the trade tone improves or perhaps there is a minor deal,\u201d said Martin Rasmussen, China economist at Capital Economics.\n\n\u201cBut some of the core issues at the centre of the trade war such as industrial policy, intellectual property theft and so on - we do not think that China will be willing to compromise a lot.\u201d\n\nThese developments keep threatening gains for other Asian currencies, barring the Japanese yen. All but one respondent to an additional question expected another sharp depreciation in the Chinese yuan to pose \u201cserious risks\u201d to other major Asian currencies over the coming year.\n\n\u201cUnless an interim trade deal materializes, we think economic and monetary easing pressure will see CNY weaken, even though it will likely be paced by the PBoC,\u201d said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at ANZ in Singapore, referring to the People\u2019s Bank of China.\n\nA much weaker currency would elevate risks of capital outflows, something China has controlled for years, but a weak growth outlook and expectations of further policy easing make things difficult for the world\u2019s second largest economy.\n\n\u201cThey will have to continue doing whatever is necessary to try and keep money in. But there\u2019s a limit to how much tighter capital controls can get - they are already incredibly draconian,\u201d Rabobank\u2019s Every added.", "description": "The Chinese yuan will slip by year-end to deeper lows last hit against the U.S. dollar during the 2008 global financial crisis as the authorities nudge the partly managed currency down while the U.S.-China trade war rumbles on, a Reuters poll showed.", "authors": ["Sumanto Mondal", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1436876229&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9306D", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
