Woods also joins Nicklaus as the only player to have won the Masters in three different decades after he clinched his first as a 21-year-old in 1997.\n\n\"It's overwhelming just because of what has transpired,\" Woods said in the Green Jacket ceremony in the Butler Cabin.\n\n\"Last year I was very lucky to be playing again. At the previous Champions Dinner I was really struggling and missed a couple of years of not playing this great tournament and now I'm the champion. Twenty two years between wins, it's a long time and it's unreal for me to experience this. My mom was here, she was there in 1997 as well. I'm just so happy and excited and I'm at a loss for words.\"\n\nTiger Woods sparked scenes of thunderous celebration on the 18th green.\n\n'Epic Sunday'\n\nWoods began the day two shots behind Italy's Francesco Molinari, and rode the roller coaster of a gripping final round to first share the lead after the Italian found the water in front of the short 12th.\n\nTwo holes later five players were tied at the top, but Woods' birdie on the long 15th took him clear on his own. Another birdie on the short 16th ignited thunderous roars which reverberated around the towering pines as Woods marched off with a two-shot lead and a thousand-yard stare in scenes reminiscent of his heyday.\n\nA moment between a father and a son.#themasters pic.twitter.com/Ft0ta2mD5o \u2014 Masters Tournament (@TheMasters) April 14, 2019\n\nSporting a red mock turtleneck in a nod to his last win at Augusta in 2005, and chewing gum throughout, Woods maintained his focus to edge world No.2 Dustin Johnson, three-time major champion Brooks Koepka and another American Xander Schauffele.\n\nWhen the winning putt dropped, Woods clenched his fist and punched the air to tumultuous applause, before walking off the 18th to embrace his mother Kultida, children Sam and Charlie, girlfriend Erica Herman and members of his team. Woods' father and mentor Earl died in May 2006.\n\n\"To have my kids there, it's come full circle,\" Woods added. \"My dad was there in 1997 and now I'm the dad with two kids there.\"\n\nThe celebrations lasted an eternity as the patrons chanted \"Tiger, Tiger\" around the 18th green before a beaming Woods whooped and high-fived his way to the scorer's hut.\n\nWoods' bogey at the last gave him a round of 70 for his first major title when trailing going into the final day.\n\n\"It's been an epic Sunday here at the Masters and a great day for golf, just one of the most amazing days in our history,\" said Augusta National chairman Fred Ridley.\n\nPhotos: The 2019 Masters Golf Tournament Day four \u2013 Tiger Woods punched the air to tumultuous applause and chants of \"Tiger, Tiger\" as he sealed his 15th major title.
