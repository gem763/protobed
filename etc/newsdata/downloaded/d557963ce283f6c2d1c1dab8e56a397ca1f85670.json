Tragically, many were unable to get out of the way.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Bourke St killer delivers bizarre rant\n\nPolice said the hostile vehicle policy does not replace the current pursuit policy but there may be times when a pursuit evolves into such an attack.\n\nA compulsory training package of scenarios will be rolled out from mid-December this year while face-to-face training will be provided from January 1, 2020.\n\nAll operational officers are expected to have completed the training by June 30, 2020.\n\nVictoria Police consulted extensively with The Police Association before the announcement.", "description": "Victorian police officers \u201cmust take action to prevent death or serious injury\u201d if they are faced with a criminal in a hostile vehicle such as the Bourke St massacre, a new policy states.", "authors": ["Sarah Mcphee"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/fe77ba36a3d6d89fdc23c9856c1d907a?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
