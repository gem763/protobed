General Assembly. \u201cStop the sanctions so as to open the way for the start of negotiations.\u201d\n\nHis words came shortly after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced additional U.S. sanctions targeting Iran\u2019s ability to sell its oil, this time imposing penalties on six Chinese companies and their chief executives for continuing to transport Iranian crude.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re telling China and all nations, know that we will sanction every violation of sanctionable activity,\u201d Pompeo said at an event for United Against a Nuclear Iran, a lobby group opposed to the nuclear deal, a few blocks from where Rouhani was speaking at the United Nations\u2019 headquarters.\n\nTensions in the Middle East have risen as the nuclear deal unravels under U.S. pressure and Iran turns back to expanding its nuclear enrichment program, despite previous compliance with it for up to a year after Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the accord.\n\nThe escalating crisis has raised concerns of a direct conflict \u2014 a scenario that all parties, including bitter rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia, have stressed they want to avoid. The United States, meanwhile, has sent military reinforcements and heightened its security presence around the Persian Gulf.\n\nIn his U.N. speech on Tuesday, Trump described Iran as \u201cone of the greatest threats\u201d to the planet.\n\nRouhani said U.S. wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria had failed, with Washington \u201cunable to resolve the more sophisticated issues\u201d plaguing the Middle East.\n\n\u201cSecurity shall not be supplied with American weapons and intervention,\u201d he said. \u201cSecurity cannot be purchased or supplied by foreign governments.\u201d\n\nWhile Rouhani\u2019s manner was measured, his words were ominous.\n\n\u201cOur region is on the edge of collapse, as a single blunder can fuel a big fire,\u201d he said, adding that it will become secure only when U.S. troops withdraw.\n\nThe vast divide between the Washington and Tehran runs right through the narrow Strait of Hormuz, a critical shipping waterway at the mouth of the Persian Gulf where a fifth of the world\u2019s oil passes each day.\n\nMonths of lower-level attacks on oil tankers near the strait and Iran\u2019s shooting down of a U.S. surveillance drone over the waterway have been blamed on Iran.\n\nThe most stunning attack unfolded earlier this month when drones and missiles struck key oil sites in Saudi Arabia, jolting global oil prices and temporarily knocking out nearly 6% of daily global crude oil production.\n\nIran has denied any involvement in the attacks, and says any strikes by the U.S. or Saudi Arabia will lead to \u201call-out war.\u201d Saudi Arabia has invited U.N. investigators to assess where the strikes were launched from, and says Iranian weapons were used.\n\nRouhani used his time at the podium to appeal to Iran\u2019s neighbors, saying their destinies are intertwined. The free flow of oil \u201ccould be guaranteed,\u201d he said, when there is security for all the region\u2019s countries.\n\nHe also talked about Iran\u2019s proposal for a Coalition for Hope, or the Hormuz Peace Initiative, that Tehran envisions would be formed under a U.N. umbrella and involve Middle Eastern countries.\n\n\u201cNeighbor comes first; then comes the house,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are neighbors with each other and not with the United States.\u201d\n\nIranian state television broadcast Rouhani\u2019s speech live across the country of 80 million people, many of whom are struggling under the weight of crippling U.S. sanctions that have sent the Iranian economy into freefall and limited Tehran\u2019s ability to sell its oil abroad.\n\nDiplomatic efforts in Europe have scrambled to preserve the nuclear deal by searching\u2014 still unsuccessfully\u2014 for ways around the U.S. sanctions. Just before his speech, the remaining signatories to the accord \u2014 Russia, China, Britain France, Germany and Iran \u2014 stressed they are trying to preserve it.\n\nDespite months of diplomatic frenzy, Rouhani said Iran has \u201conly heard beautiful words.\u201d\n\n\u201cEurope is unable and incapable of fulfilling its commitments,\u201d he said, warning: \u201cOur patience has a limit.\u201d\n\nThe European position appears to have shifted after the Sept. 14 attack on Saudi oil sites. In a joint statement, Britain, France and Germany joined the U.S. this week in blaming Iran for the attack and in saying that the time had come for Iran to accept negotiations on its missile program and issues of regional security. These are two key main issues Trump says the nuclear deal did not address when it was completed under the Obama administration.\n\nIn his speech at the U.N., Trump left open the possibility of diplomatic engagement with Iran. As Rouhani ended his remarks, he also suggested there was still room for diplomacy.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s return to justice, to peace, to law, commitment and promise and finally to the negotiating table,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Matt Lee in New York and Amir Vahdat in Tehran, Iran, contributed.\n\n___\n\nAya Batrawy covers the Persian Gulf for The Associated Press.
