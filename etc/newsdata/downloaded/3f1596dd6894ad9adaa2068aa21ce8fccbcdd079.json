Apologise for what?\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

We thought we were having a private chat, some nasty little creep broadcasted it to the world.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Gary Lineker Salary: \u00a31.75m PA\n\nHe insisted he was \u201cnot having a go at Carrie Gracie\u201d and said: \u201cI thought the whole point of it was that men were earning too much and women too little, so a man takes a pay cut. That doesn\u2019t address the issue?\u201d\n\nIn the leaked conversation, Humphrys could be heard asking Sopel: \u201cHow much of your salary you are prepared to hand over to Carrie Gracie to keep her?\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cOh dear God. She\u2019s actually suggested that you should you lose money; you know that don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nAt the time, the BBC admitted Gracie had been told she would be paid in line with the north America editor, Jon Sopel, whose salary was in the \u00a3200,000-\u00a3250,000 range, but after she accepted the role her pay turned out to be \u00a3135,000.\n\nIn the same year, 2017, Humphrys was on a salary of \u00a3600,000\u2013\u00a3649,999. He subsequently took three pay cuts.\n\nWhen an audience member at Cheltenham asked Humphrys, referring to Gracie, if he is a misogynist, he said: \u201cThat is an offensive question. Do you have any evidence for that?\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, Humphrys referred to the backlash after the leaked conversation as \u201cpreposterous\u201d.\n\nElsewhere in the new interview, Humphrys said he thought it was \u201coutrageous that the BBC is nearly 100 years old it has never had a woman director-general\u201d. He added: \u201cI think that is just plain wrong and the next one just has to be in my view.\u201d\n\nHe also said the BBC has \u201cprobably always has had an institutional bias\u201d.\n\n\u201c[BBC bosses] see the world through a particular lens at different times in their history,\u201d said Humphrys. \u201cI think probably in the late Eighties and Nineties we lost sight of the concern many people had specifically at that time about immigration. We didn\u2019t address or acknowledge it as we should have done\u2026\n\n\u201cBecause most people who becomes bosses at the BBC come from decent universities and have probably done liberal arts degrees and had lecturers and professors who are on the left of politics. They\u2019ve assimilated that, it\u2019s not that they\u2019ve come to the BBC with a specific agenda, but their mindset is that of the liberal left.\u201d\n\nHumphrys memoirs, A Day Like Today, were published earlier this week.", "description": "John Humphrys has said he doesn\u2019t know what he should apologise to Carrie Gracie for after a conversation was leaked of him making light of the gender pay gap, and in particular her salary, at the BBC.", "authors": ["Ellie Harrison"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/22/08/john-humphrys-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
