Conditions at Ascot on Friday looked pretty gruelling and that should play to the strengths of Kynren, who relishes deep ground, while the drop back to today's trip could also play to his strengths.\n\nAlthough a beaten favourite at Ayr last time, Kynren would have found conditions plenty quick enough that day and I also like Ben Curtis riding as his figures aboard the selection read 111320. So David Barron's gelding is narrowly preferred to last year's 1-2, Raising Sand and the admirable Ripp Orf.\n\nSportsmail's racing expert Robin Goodfellow dishes out his tips for Saturday's meetings at Ascot, Newmarket, Redcar, Wolverhampton and Fontwell.\n\nSportsmail's racing expert Robin Goodfellow dishes out his tips for Saturday's meetings\n\nASCOT\n\nROBIN GOODFELLOW 2.00 Maygold 2.35 Morando 3.10 Kynren (nap) 3.40 Cape Byron 4.15 Di Fede (nb) 4.50 Saaheq GIMCRACK 2.00 Danzeno 2.35 Faylaq (nap) 3.10 Casanova (nb) 3.40 Donjuan Triumphant 4.15 Dandhu 4.50 Alaadel\n\nNortherner - 2.00 Dakota Gold (nb)\n\nNEWMARKET\n\nROBIN GOODFELLOW 1.40 Eva Maria 2.15 Under The Stars 2.50 Man Of The Night 3.25 Iridessa 4.00 Vatican City 4.35 Maybe Today 5.10 Warning Fire GIMCRACK 1.40 Eva Maria 2.15 Under The Stars 2.50 Never Alone 3.25 Billesdon Brook 4.00 Raaeb 4.35 Specialise 5.10 Warning Fire\n\nNewmarket \u2013 3.25 Veracious (nap); 4.00 Raaeb (nb)\n\nREDCAR\n\nROBIN GOODFELLOW 1.45 Duesenberg 2.20 Finniston Farm 2.55 Troubador 3.35 Makzeem 4.10 Breanski 4.45 Railport Dolly 5.20 Manshood GIMCRACK 1.45 Vega Magic 2.20 Finniston Farm 2.55 Summer Sands 3.35 First Contact 4.10 Breanski 4.45 Detachment 5.20 Roundhay Park\n\nNortherner \u2013 2.55 Summer Sands (nap)\n\nWOLVERHAMPTON\n\nROBIN GOODFELLOW 5.30 Picture Poet 6.00 Inflamed 6.30 Abwaaq 7.00 Kahala Queen 7.30 Walk On Walter 8.00 Turanga Leela 8.30 Dobrianka GIMCRACK 5.30 Lippy Lady 6.00 Hermano Bello 6.30 Daysaq 7.00 Kahala Queen 7.30 Walk On Walter 8.00 Chitra 8.30 All Points West\n\nFONTWELL", "description": "Kynren (Ascot, nap, 3.10) has spent more time knocking on the door than a window salesman in recent times, but he may be ready to snatch a win on Saturday.", "authors": ["Sam Turner For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/30/22/19126432-0-image-a-13_1569877589153.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
