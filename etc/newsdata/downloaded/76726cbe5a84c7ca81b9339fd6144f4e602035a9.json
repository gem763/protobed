And if we take into account how the US has negotiated similar agreements with other countries such as the Korean trade agreement, Canada, Mexico, they have inevitably got what they wanted in those situations.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

They basically want to turn it into a system whereby it\u2019s the pharmaceutical companies who set the prices.\u201d\n\nIt is understood UK officials have managed to work around a ban on discussing drug pricing with US firms by using alternative \u201ccoded\u201d language.\n\nTrade ministers had been barred from discussing the NHS with US counterparts according to a letter from senior Downing Street officials published in The Sun, which said service provision and drug pricing \u201care not on the table and we do not therefore expect to see any internal discussion of them\u201d.\n\nHowever, a source told the Channel 4 show that Ms Truss\u2019 department had sidestepped this issue by using alternative language that did not directly reference drug prices.\n\nShe had referred to the issue as \u201cvaluing innovation\u201d.\n\nMr Amin added that it was quite possible the trade deal would not feature the words NHS \u2013 and instead pharmaceutical companies would be given the green light through \u201ccoded language\u201d in any future agreement.\n\nA government spokesperson said: \u201cThe NHS is not, and never will be, for sale to the private sector, whether overseas or domestic\u200e. The government is committed to the guiding principles of the NHS \u2013 that it is universal and free at the point of need. The government will continue to ensure that patients have access to clinically and cost-effective medicines that are affordable to the NHS, and that decisions on how to run public services such as the NHS are made by the UK government and the Devolved Administrations, not our trade partners.\n\n\u201cThe sustainability of the NHS is an absolute priority for the government. We could not agree to any proposals on medicines pricing or access that would put NHS finances at risk or reduce clinician and patient choice.\u201d", "description": "Senior British civil servants have met with representatives from a US companies\u00a0to discuss\u00a0the NHS in post-Brexit trade negotiations, it has been revealed.
