I wrote about everything Lady Gaga did. I covered The September Issue with such enthusiasm that I was eventually quoted on the DVD box. Bloggers like Bryanboy were happening, and most fashion people were feeling rather uncomfortable about it, and I couldn\u2019t stop writing about the clash of old and new media.\n\nI was keeping a journal throughout this whole ridiculous experience \u2026 but I sure as hell won\u2019t be publishing it. Instead, here\u2019s a lightly fictionalized diary of one very strange year.\n\nOctober 1, 2008\n\nToday, I saw the future, and it is dangerous shoes. In 2009, if designers have their way, we will all risk injury for the sake of fashion. Runway models have already fallen in too-high heels at Rodarte, Prada, and Pucci\u2019s spring 2009 shows \u2014 others almost fell at Dolce & Gabbana, BCBG, and Peter Som.\n\nSince I cannot afford any of these shoes, this will not be my problem.\n\nJanuary 28, 2009\n\nThe September Issue, a documentary about Vogue\u2019s 2007 September issue, premiered at Sundance and now all of Vogue\u2019s secrets are out.\n\nThe secrets include that Anna Wintour and her team had some issues with cover girl Sienna Miller\u2019s physical features, including her hair (\u201cunruly\u201d) and teeth (\u201ctoo many fillings\u201d). The final cover was a composite of her head from one photo and her body from another. This is sort of common, no? Just like photoshopping away armpit creases and lower-belly shadows? The general public should know these things go on, so it\u2019s good that the film brings them to light, albeit bad for Vogue to become the symbol of this sort of thing.\n\nI cannot wait to see this movie to fully understand the ways in which the Vogue team would find me, a blogger dressing and grooming on a blogger\u2019s salary, an absolute goblin.\n\nMay 13, 2009\n\nLady Gaga wore an \u201corbit\u201d hat on Ellen the other day. It looked like she had a solar system without any planets around her face. But of course she did, because she is the sun around which we all revolve.\n\nMarch 18, 2009\n\nToday I read on Perez Hilton that Lady Gaga allegedly gets stopped by the police when she\u2019s out in public because she likes to wear underpants instead of pants pants. This sounds made-up but she\u2019s fashion\u2019s most important person right now so everyone should probably obsess over it anyway.\n\nMay 19, 2009\n\nWell, apparently that store Oak is trying to make \u201cspants\u201d happen. Spants are a skirt and pants together in one piece of clothing. I do wonder if this will catch. Jeggings did. Maybe that trend wasn\u2019t rock bottom.\n\nJuly 9, 2009\n\nLady Gaga continues to be incredibly important every time she breathes or wears a thing. Today I found a video of a press conference she did wearing a mask that covered her entire face, which she called \u201ca contemporary art piece.\u201d It\u2019s also a great contemporary \u201cI\u2019m not wearing makeup today, k thanks bye fu\u201d piece.\n\nJuly 21, 2009\n\nLady Gaga went on TV in France wearing a coat made of flaccid Kermits. I am both very here for this and also the appropriate amount of disturbed.\n\nAugust 31, 2009\n\nFashion media probably won\u2019t stand the test of time, if recent newsstand numbers are any indication. It\u2019s time to face the uncomfortable truth that the Cut might need to become a reality show. Like The City or Stylista or Running With Heels or Project Runway.\n\nI am prepared to sacrifice my position for the cause, and become a character who has to complete impossible challenges, like de-wrinkling a silk top faster than eight other people, in order to win a Chipotle gift card and a one-day internship where I will have to de-wrinkle yet another silk top.\n\nSeptember 15, 2009\n\nI went to the Park Avenue Hotel this morning to watch Snuggie\u2019s very first fashion show. I couldn\u2019t pass up the opportunity to witness both dogs and humans modeling the \u201csexiest looks in blanket-wear.\u201d Also, I was sick of having to stake out Amber Rose and her boyfriend Kanye West at every show, and I correctly surmised that they would not attend. Their loss.\n\nOnly a handful of people were there, which was great because I got to sit front row. Never mind that there was only one row. One dog model got tired mid-walk and plopped down on the runway, which was actually perfect, because the Snuggie is an item of clothing for people who can\u2019t be bothered to move.\n\nLater that day I caught Joan Rivers at the Dennis Basso show. She said the Snuggie is a knockoff of the Slanket. \u201cI would wear a Slanket anywhere. I think it\u2019s great, because it leaves your ass exposed,\u201d she said. \u201cSo you can get to the bathroom fast, which at my age is a plus.\u201d\n\nOctober 5, 2009\n\nPhoebe Philo presented her first runway collection for C\u00e9line, and now everyone remembers what clothes for grownups look like. \u201cI wanted to clean it up, refocus, and present a strong, powerful woman,\u201d Philo said of the collection. Every runway look included actual bottoms \u2014 skirts, shorts, even flowy pants. But notably, nary a spant in sight.\n\nNovember 10, 2009\n\nLady Gaga wears sunglasses made of razor blades in the \u201cBad Romance\u201d video. The September Issue is behind us but I do believe I will be writing about her for the rest of my life.\n\nNovember 19, 2009\n\nLast night, the Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show taped in New York, featuring numbers by the Black Eyed Peas and Kings of Leon, two musical artists that will surely be just as popular even ten years from now.\n\nI went backstage in the middle of the day to interview the models. It takes nearly the entire day to prepare them for the two total minutes of runway walking they do in the show. Which makes you wonder: If these remarkably gorgeous specimens of humankind need this many hours to get made up to model underwear, what would it take for the average person? Ten years of kale juice?\n\nBackstage, Victoria\u2019s Secret has two buffets laid out \u2014 one for food and a more popular one for hair extensions. Seems healthy.\n\nNovember 30, 2009\n\nThe sons and daughters of the landed gentry have just gathered for the Crillon Ball in Paris. I was surprised to see that the 17-year-old personal style blogger Jane Aldridge, who posts photos of her fashion choices on the site Sea of Shoes, also attended, upon the recommendation of Vogue.\n\nAldridge has already been quite successful. So successful that she\u2019s designed two lines for Urban Outfitters and appeared on the greatest show of all time, The City. It makes you think, doesn\u2019t it? What if her schtick \u2014 wear things, take photos, post them to the internet \u2014 is the future of fashion? Could we one day live in a world where this very activity rules our lives and dictates the media consumption patterns of fashion enthusiasts?\n\nHa! Yeah right. Personal style bloggers will rule the world, sneakers will become the height of fashion, and New Yorkers will refuse to drink any milk that is not made of oats. Sounds about right.\n\nAmy Odell is the author of Tales From the Back Row, a more robust account of covering fashion for the Cut.", "description": "Ten years ago, former Cosmopolitan.com editor Amy Odell was blogging at The Cut.
