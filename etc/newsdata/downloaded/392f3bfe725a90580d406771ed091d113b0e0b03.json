It needs that funding for social care.\u201d\n\nLast year, former prime minister Theresa May pledged an extra \u00a320 billion a year by 2023 for the health service.\n\nDr Nick Scriven, from the Society for Acute Medicine, said at some point the NHS would \u201creach a vital tipping point and care will be compromised despite all the heroic efforts by the human side of this, the staff in post.\u201d\n\nJeremy Hughes, chief executive at the Alzheimer\u2019s Society said: \u201cThe report\u2019s findings echo what we\u2019ve seen through our campaigning, that the dire state of social care is resulting in more and more people with dementia being rushed to hospital with falls, dehydration, infections, and other avoidable emergencies.\u201d\n\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said: \u201cWe are supporting our most vulnerable by transforming mental health services with a record spend of \u00a312.1 billion this year and are working to reduce the number of people with learning disabilities and autism in mental health hospitals by improving specialist services and community crisis care, reducing avoidable admissions and enabling shorter lengths of stay.\n\n\u201cWe will set out our plans to reform social care in due course.\u201d", "description": "The Care Quality Commission warned of a `perfect storm\u00b4 across health and social care where people cannot access the care they need.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/00/wire-19715216-1571094289-796_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
