Making \u201925 is hard. My debut in the UFC, I didn\u2019t make weight. I didn\u2019t make weight a few times in my fighting career trying to make \u201925.\u201d\n\nWith several exciting new additions to the 135-pound division like former featherweight king Jose Aldo and former lightweight champ Frankie Edgar, Cejudo likes the current state of the division.\n\nCejudo, who\u2019s targeting a return in March, has his eyes on two former champs.\n\n\u201cI like Frankie Edgar. I like the Dominick Cruz right now,\u201d Cejudo said. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s jumping at me. As much as Joe does have a victory over me \u2026 but at the end of the day, it\u2019s cutting the weight, man \u2013 especially being up at \u201935 and then feeling good, and having a good camp, and just being more happy. Be more happy, literally \u2013 like, I cut 25 pounds to get down to \u201925.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to end up finishing my career at bantamweight, 100 percent.\u201d", "description": "Henry Cejudo doesn't want to be forced into fighting Joseph Benavidez at flyweight and wants either Frankie Edgar or Dominick Cruz next.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Simon Samano", "Nolan King", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Matt Erickson"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/henry-cejudo-ufc-238-5.png?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
