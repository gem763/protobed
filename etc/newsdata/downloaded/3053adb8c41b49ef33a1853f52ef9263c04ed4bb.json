The foreground shows a biblical phrase from the Old Testament which reads: \u2018Though one may be overpowered, two can defend themselves. A cord of three strands is not quickly broken.\u2019\n\nDash (left), who starred in the 1990s hit movie Clueless, pleaded not guilty on Wednesday to a count of domestic battery. She was bailed out on Monday morning by Marty (right), the man she is charged with assaulting\n\nAccording to court documents obtained by DailyMail.com, she is also demanding a jury trial three days after she was heard on a 911 call saying that her husband and his children were conspiring against her.\n\nDash is facing a sentence of up to one year in prison after she allegedly attacked Marty following a fight with her stepdaughter.\n\nMarty, who is a lawyer and Dash's fourth husband, married the actress last year just 10 days after they met.\n\nDash submitted her written plea after being paired with a public defender. Dash told the court that she is indigent, and in a court form listed no savings or property of any value.\n\nCourt forms also identify Dash as a 'white' female.\n\nIt is unclear if that is how she classified herself or if that was mistakenly put in by the Pasco County Sheriff's Office, who told DailyMail.com that they could not comment on any personal information.\n\nDash, who in 2016 said that Black History Month should be abolished, is the daughter of a Mexican-American mother and an African-American father. The complaint notes that she did provide officers with her driver's license.\n\nThe Pasco County Sheriff's Office later explained why they noted that Dash was white.\n\n'Stacey Dash was never asked her race by the arresting deputy, nor did she volunteer any information about her race. The arresting deputy assumed that she was Hispanic,' said a spokesperson in a statement.\n\n'However, the Pasco Sheriff's Office follows the Department of Justice Uniform Crime Reporting standards and, according to the DOJ reporting requirements the only allowable races are: Asian/Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, Black/African American, American Indian/Alaskan Native, Unknown, or White.'\n\nThe statement went on to explain that officers 'are unable to capture information that is outside of these racial categories established by the Department of Justice.'\n\nDash and Marty are allowed to have contact while she awaits trial, and he was the one to bail her out of jail the day after the incident.\n\nThe 52-year-old was taken into custody in the early hours of Monday morning at the home she shares with Marty in Pasco County, Florida.\n\nBody camera footage taken by the arresting officers shows Dash being handcuffed and placed in the back of a squad car wearing nothing but a long t-shirt and flip flops.\n\nIt was Dash who called police to her home at about 7:45pm, claiming that her husband had placed her in a chokehold.\n\nThat allegedly occurred after Dash and her stepdaughter, 15, got into a fight, and the actress pushed the teenager.\n\nIn the body cam footage, Dash appeared confused as she was placed in handcuffs and could be heard asking if she was under arrest.\n\nThe arresting officer later asked Dash where she was born and what she did for a living. She told him she was an actress and that she starred in the film Clueless.\n\nDash also mentioned working in politics and her stint as a Fox News contributor.\n\nDash was ultimately charged with battery, and officers returned to the property after midnight to arrest the actress.\n\nDash rose to fame starring as Dionne Davenport in the 1995 film Clueless alongside Alicia Silverstone\n\nMarty posted to social media around this time, tweeting: 'Anyone who would falsely use law enforcement to destroy another person's life deserves exactly what they get.'\n\nThe complaint that has been filed in the case states that Dash 'pushed the victim and slapped him in the face.'\n\nIt is then noted that the victim 'sustained red scratch marks to his left upper arm from being pushed.'\n\nDash and Marty 'reside in the same household together as a family unit' it is noted, 'and are intimate partners.'\n\nThe actress was being held at the Land-O-Lakes Detention Facility.\n\nShe will still be able to see her husband despite the charge as a Order of Commitment signed by a court official stating that contact between the defendant and her victim will be allowed at this time.\n\nDash rose to fame starring as Dionne Davenport in the 1995 film Clueless alongside Alicia Silverstone.\n\nThe actress married her lawyer husband in Florida last year.\n\nIt is her fourth marriage after previously being married to Brian Lovell, James Maby and Emmanuel Xuereb.\n\nShe has two children - a 16-year-old daughter and 27-year-old son - from previous relationships.\n\nHer latest wedding in Spring last year came soon after she launched a failed bid to enter politics.\n\nShe had announced she was running as a Republican for California\u2019s 44th district in February 2018 but withdrew from the congressional race just a month later.\n\nDash, who was an on-air contributor at Fox News until 2016, is a frequent supporter of President Donald Trump. She supported him in the last election.\n\nDash claims to have voted for Barack Obama in the 2008 election but then switched her party affiliation in 2012 to Republican and endorsed Mitt Romney in the election.", "description": "The post, which Jeffrey Marty initially posted last April,\u00a0shows a photo of him and wife Stacey Dash kissing in the background with a biblical quote in the foreground.", "authors": ["Ariel Zilber", "Chris Spargo For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/21/19270754-0-image-a-6_1570135341145.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
