At my son\u2019s school this group is called the School Community Council (or SCC). In Ontario, SCCs exist at every public school.\n\nYou'll Also Love This Mom's POV: I\u2019ll Volunteer, But I\u2019ve Had Enough Of School Fundraisers\n\nAt its heart, a PTA or SCC is really just a group of dedicated parent volunteers who want to make the school a better place for their kids and yours.\n\nFull disclosure: I was hesitant about joining the SCC and becoming a \u201cPTA mom\u201d when my son started kindergarten, mostly because of the bad rap that these moms are given online and in pop culture. The stereotype paints PTA moms as judgmental perfectionists who are hell-bent on banning gluten from the school bake sale (see: Christina Applegate\u2019s Gwendolyn in Bad Moms), and I just don\u2019t have time for muffin-related drama in my life. There is also usually an undercurrent of \u201cmom wars\u201d between stay-at-home moms and working moms, which inevitably depicts both sides as tired caricatures rather than complex individuals who are just doing the best they can. Thankfully, as is so often the case, reality is much different from the movie version.\n\nLooking around the room at that first SCC meeting, I saw a group of fellow parents who just wanted to be involved in their child\u2019s school and do what they could to help enrich the school experience for all kids, not just their own. There were working parents and stay-at-home parents, newbies like myself and veterans who\u2019d been attending meetings for years. There were no grown-up \u201cMean Girls\u201d here \u2014 everyone was welcome. And after spending a year on the inside, I\u2019m happy to report that my own experience is nothing like the movies and memes would have you believe.\n\nAlso Recommended: All Of The Reasons I Hate Popcorn Day At My Kids\u2019 School\n\nIf they ask you to come to a meeting or volunteer to help with something, it\u2019s not because they\u2019re judging you or trying to guilt you into getting involved.\n\nAt its heart, a PTA or SCC is really just a group of dedicated parent volunteers who want to make the school a better place for their kids and yours. They\u2019re the ones who organize the pizza day that saves you from packing a lunch. They\u2019re the ones who organize fundraisers to help your child\u2019s teacher get some new iPads for the class. They\u2019re the ones who get together the night before the first day of school to write positive messages in sidewalk chalk that might help calm a child\u2019s back-to-school jitters. They send out reminders about field trips, picture days and school assemblies so that even if you\u2019re not the most organized parent, you know someone\u2019s got your back.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that things always run smoothly, of course. After all, we\u2019re talking about a fairly large group of people with different personalities, coming together to work on various projects, committees and sub-committees. There is bound to be some friction from time to time. But it\u2019s not unlike any other team dynamic \u2014 some people may click more than others, but ultimately, everyone is working towards the same goal.\n\nSo if you happen to be approached by a member of your local PTA this year, resist the urge to dive into the nearest set of bushes. If they ask you to come to a meeting or volunteer to help with something, it\u2019s not because they\u2019re judging you or trying to guilt you into getting involved. As the saying goes, many hands make light work, and more volunteers are always needed. It\u2019s OK to join the PTA! And if it\u2019s not your thing, that\u2019s OK, too. Just know that they\u2019ll be there if you ever change your mind \u2014 no bake sale experience necessary.", "description": "Full disclosure: I was hesitant about joining the SCC and becoming a \u201cPTA mom\u201d when my son started kindergarten, mostly because of the bad rap that these moms are given online and in pop culture.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/parents/content/imgs/_8col/pta.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
