She tells us that the \u00a324 (8,995 Hungarian forints) Bershka dress she purchased for her friend\u2019s wedding is officially \u2018brown\u2019 and that she cleared her outfit choice with the bride ahead of the event.\n\nShe said: \u2018This whole story is ridiculous\u2026 really.\n\n\u2018My dress is BEIGE\u2026 not white. My dress is actually called \u201cBROWN\u201d on the website (it has a white version but I bought the \u201cBROWN\u201d) \u201cBarna\u201d means brown\u2026\u2019\n\nThe \u00a324 dress as it is pictured and described on the Bershka website \u2013 sold as the colour \u2018brown\u2019. There is a white version on sale as well\n\nBeing officially brown is not enough defence for the wedding shamers though. They say that her dress appears off-white, which makes it inappropriate to wear it as it is \u2018in the spectrum of white\u2019.\n\nOne use wrote: \u2018Technically she isn\u2019t wearing white (but still in the white area category and tacky AF).\n\n\u2018Her coat/blazer though is white. The dress looks good and definitely not wedding appropriate.\u2019\n\nAnother said: \u2018There are some shades of light pink/light blue/light yellow that I wouldn\u2019t even wear to a wedding because they could look close to white in pics, let alone off white.\n\nAnother wrote: \u2018It\u2019s linen. And WAY too close to white to wear to a wedding without looking like an insecure narcissist screaming for attention.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOthers were more upset at the fact Noemi was holding the bride\u2019s bouquet in the photo.\n\nOne person said: \u2018I wonder why she\u2019s holding the bouquet like that. Is she showing off her lines or something? Making sure we see the whole outfit?\u2019\n\nNot everyone was quite so brutal \u2013 one person didn\u2019t see an issue with Noemi\u2019s dress.\n\n\u2018Look, and I\u2019ll probably get down voted for this [\u2026], but I don\u2019t see the big deal here,\u2019 the person wrote.\n\n\u2018Yes, it\u2019s whiteish but it\u2019s midi length and a textured casual fabric (linen) that I doubt could ever be confused with a wedding gown.\n\n\u2018While I personally wouldn\u2019t wear this to a wedding, I wouldn\u2019t be annoyed if someone wore it to mine. I don\u2019t think it takes away from the bride one bit, I mean come on, she\u2019s the bride, I doubt anyone would confuse her for someone else.\u2019\n\nOn the bouquet, Noemi says: \u2018There is a tradition in Hungary that the bride throws her bouquet and who grabs it, will be the next one who gets married\u2026 I am not engaged (I\u2019ve been waiting for it for years now\u2026) and I grabbed the bouquet\u2026\n\n\u2018Btw, the bride is one of my best friends on the photo and I actually showed her the dress before the wedding and she really really liked [it]\u2026\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018So I am not a wedding crasher, I DID NOT STEAL the wedding bouquet\u2026 And my shoes are actually light pink.\u2019\n\nMORE: Harry Potter-mad couple spend \u00a35,000 on Hogwarts wedding with broomstick rides\n\nMORE: Inseparable kids who say they\u2019ll be together forever stage fake wedding photoshoot\n\nMORE: Dying man marries love of his life in wedding ceremony with every detail donated\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "The guest is a 'popular Hungarian Instagram girl' and decided to hold onto the bouquet while posing for a photo with the bride.", "authors": ["Almara Abgarian"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_89833286-e1571054078847_1571073410.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
