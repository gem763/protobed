No details were provided about what the youngsters were suspected of bringing into school.\n\nA seven-year-old in Hertfordshire was allegedly found in possession of a kitchen knife with a 6in (15cm) blade, but any prosecution was prevented by the child\u2019s age.\n\nAnd an eight-year-old was investigated for having a \u201csmall\u201d Swiss army knife in their possession on school premises. Again, the suspect\u2019s age ruled out prosecution.\n\nSouth Wales Police said similar circumstances prevented them from prosecuting both a seven-year-old and a nine-year-old each found with a knife, and an eight-year-old caught with a nail file.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nIt was a similar disturbing picture around England:-\n\nIn Bedfordshire, a pupil was caught in possession of machete, while others were accused of carrying a meat cleaver and a firearm.\n\nIn Cambridgeshire, a relatively common toy known as a fidget spinner was adapted with a spike to be used as a weapon.\n\nDevon and Cornwall Police confirmed a 14-year-old was handed a youth caution for bringing a sword into school.\n\nGreater Manchester police recovered a samurai sword from a school.The force said other weapons involved in incidents at school included a machete, a Taser and a snooker ball.\n\nWest Midlands Police said a 15-year-old was cautioned for being caught in possession of an axe, while a 16-year-old was given a postal charge for possessing a zombie knife.\n\nIn Wiltshire, armoured gloves, a hammer and a shank were among the weapons allegedly used.\n\nLeicestershire police said a 15-year-old was given a youth caution for bringing nunchucks - a martial arts weapon - to school.\n\nNorfolk police pupils were found with a baton, a wooden stake and a pencil sharpener blade.\n\nNorthumbria police\u2019s list of weapons at school included a chair leg, a baseball bat, broken glass and a butter knife - the latter being found on a suspect aged 10 or younger.\n\nThames Valley police reported a bayonet being discovered at school, while a hatchet and a hammer were used to threaten another person. The force said other weapons involved in incidents at school included a machete, a Taser and a snooker ball.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nSchool leaders said the figures were \u201cgrim but unsurprising\u201d, but highlighted a problem in society that schools cannot solve alone and made worse by cuts to policing and essential services.\n\nAnd police chiefs warned that violence was a growing problem among young people, but forces wre working with schools to educate youngsters and explain why they should not carry weapons.\n\nChief Constable Olivia Pinkney, National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council lead for children and young people, said that although incidents are rare, forces are seeing a small number of offences on school premises involving weapons.\n\n\u201cSerious violence is a growing problem amongst young people and we continue to work closely with partners to address this,\u201d she said.\n\nGeoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \u201cThese figures are grim but unsurprising and reflect a growing problem over the prevalence of weapons in wider society.\n\n\u201cThe scourge of weapons has grown worse in recent years, and while there are a number of complex factors involved, a key issue has been cuts in policing and local support services for vulnerable families.\n\n\u201cGangs have filled this vacuum and often pressure and groom young people into dealing drugs and carrying weapons.\n\n\u201cSchools are doing their best to tackle these problems, but they cannot possibly solve this issue on their own.\u201d\n\nEnd the knife epidemic - The Mirror's demands Police\n\nWe need more police and support officers. Police numbers have been cut by 20,000 under the Tories.\n\nThere is an urgent need for more officers on the beat with beefed up powers to tackle the rise in knife crime.\n\nWe should look at tougher sentences for selling and carrying blades.\n\n\n\nReverse the cuts to youth services\n\nSince 2011 there has been a 44% cut to youth services. This has seen youth clubs and leisure facilities closed across the country.\n\nChildren\u2019s mental health services and the number of youth and social workers have also been cut.\n\nScotland halted the rise in knife crime by giving young people help with education, training and housing.\n\n\n\nSchools\n\nEvery secondary school should hold knife crime workshops to teach young people about the danger of carrying offensive weapons.\n\nYoung people should hear from relatives of knife-crime victims. Pupils should be taught about the dangers of social media and given advice on how to tackle peer pressure.\n\nThere should be a dedicated police officer for every secondary school.\n\n\n\nTackle the problems behind the epidemic\n\nChildren excluded from school are twice as likely to carry a knife. Pupil Referral Units (PRUs) have become \u201cfinishing schools\u201d for gangs. At the same time young people are being caught up in wars between rival drug cartels.\n\nWe need to improve PRUs and tackle Britain\u2019s drug crisis.\n\n\n\nKnife crime tsar\n\nThere should be a single person responsible for co-ordinating the response to knife crime.\n\nThey should work with the police, schools and councils. Funds should be directed at the areas which need the most help.\n\nAnd Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), added:\u201dThe biggest barrier to keeping young people safe is not a lack action from schools, it is a lack of funding for essential public services.\n\n\u201cSchools already work in partnership with the police and local authorities to prevent pupils from coming to harm and to ensure they don\u2019t cause harm to others. The problem for everyone concerned is that they are all under-resourced and over-stretched.\u201d\n\nThe shocking figures come at a time of rising concern about knife crime, with police-recorded incidents at the highest level since current records began.\n\nLatest Home Office figures show that 43,516 offences involving a knife or sharp instrument were recorded by forces in England and Wales in 2018/19. The figures exclude Greater Manchester.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nThis was up 8% on the previous 12 months and the highest number since comparable figures started to be collected in 2010/11.\n\nA Department for Education spokesman said: \u201cSchools should be safe and disciplined environments for both pupils and teachers.\n\n\u201cWe recently announced a \u00a310 million investment to establish behaviour hubs so that schools with a track record of effectively managing pupils\u2019 behaviour can share what works with schools that need it.\n\n\u201cWe have strengthened teachers\u2019 powers so they can take action if they suspect a pupil has brought a prohibited item, including knives, into schools.\"", "description": "One four-year-old was found carrying a knife in mid-Wales last year, Dyfed Powys says, while kids as young as six brought weapons into schools in Greater Manchester", "authors": ["Mark Ellis", "Image", "Getty Images", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20585870.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_Weapons.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
