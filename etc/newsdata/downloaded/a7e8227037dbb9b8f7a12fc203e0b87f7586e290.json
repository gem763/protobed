Come over here you\u2019ll be caught by the neck, that chicken neck. You don\u2019t fool me,\u201d said Mr Gracie, a 52-year-old mixed martial arts fighter appointed to public office last month by Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil's far-right president.\n\nIn a subsequent interview with Brazilian news outlet UOL, Mr Gracie complained tourism appeared to be declining in the country due to the \u201cfalse fires\u201d, claiming without evidence that the burning of the rainforest was at normal levels.\n\n\u201cThis gang of clowns only open their mouths to speak ill of our country,\u201d Mr Gracie said. \u201cOf course a bunch of people will be surprised, they\u2019ll think I called him chicken because I was questioning his manhood, but I\u2019ve seen plenty of gay men who are more manly than this imbecile.\u201d\n\nMr Gracie\u2019s homophobic outburst came a week after Mr Macron condemned Mr Bolsonaro for \u201cextraordinarily disrespectful comments\u201d about his wife.\n\nIn a post on Mr Bolsonaro's Facebook page, a user insulted the 66-year-old French first lady by comparing her appearance with that of Mr Bolsonaro\u2019s wife, Michelle, implying the younger woman was more attractive.\n\nThe supporter suggested Mr Macron was jealous, and that that was why he was \u201cpersecuting\u201d the Brazilian leader. Mr Bolsonaro hit \u201clike\u201d on the post, writing: \"Don't humiliate the guy ... ha ha.\"\n\nAsked about alleged derogatory comments he himself had made about Brigitte, Mr Gracie called Mr Macron's wife a \u201cdragon\u201d.\n\n\"I'll ask you a question, is his wife beautiful or ugly? Would you take it? If you\u2019re going to talk rubbish about our country, you better be ready to listen to some rubbish back, and about your relatives. The fact he sleeps with a dragon doesn\u2019t make him a fire expert. She\u2019s ugly, brother,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite belated efforts to stop deforestation \u2013 the major source of Brazil\u2019s fires \u2013 there were more than 2,000 fire outbreaks in the Amazon in the 48 hours after the government on Thursday imposed a burning ban, according to the country\u2019s National Space Research Institute.\n\nNomeado \"embaixador do turismo\", Renzo Gracie tem se reunido com empres\u00e1rios e autoridades do EUA pra atrair turistas ao Brasil.

In return, Mr Macron questioned the Brazilian president\u2019s trustworthiness and commitment to protecting biodiversity.\n\nRead more\n\nHow Jair Bolsonaro found a friend in Trump while rainforest burned\n\nChildren struggling to breathe from smoke caused by Amazon fires\n\nFood price profiteering is destroying the Amazon", "description": "Brazil's tourism ambassador has threatened to choke Emmanuel Macron and called his wife Brigitte \u201cugly\u201d amid a continuing war of words between the French president and the Brazilian government over the fires in the Amazon rainforest.In a video posted on social media, Renzo Gracie accused Mr Macron", "authors": ["Tom Embury-Dennis"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/agWOihjUF0Qer1MGl31MNA--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/0512ce6794330db321a693bbf2389981"}
