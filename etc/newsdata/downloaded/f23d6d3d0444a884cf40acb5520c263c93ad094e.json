They are social and economic hubs for growth and should be better supported.\u201d\n\nEmily McVeigh said: \u201cMy father would say that ultimately it\u2019s a shame that we can\u2019t make enough money from farming without diversification. But I have so many friends with farms and I always tell them that maximising the value of their location or view is their biggest asset.\n\n\u201cThe main point is that our diversification has allowed a 460 acre farm to support three households, which has to be what this is all about.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also allowed us to have multiple income streams, giving us far more flexibility and we\u2019re less prone to sudden market shifts or shocks.\u201d\n\nShe started this side of the business when she presented a business plan to my father when she was in her early twenties.\n\nMs McVeigh added: \u201cWe started by offering weddings on the farm in a marquee and we were among the first to offer glamping in Suffolk. From a single yurt and a shepherds hut it grew into a small woodland village with assorted luxury tents, yurts and huts, not only offering great glamping accommodation, but also enabling us to offer a complete festival wedding package and experience.\n\nThey also host hen parties on the farm and have built a cookery school to provide activities for those staying in the yurts and shepherds huts in their woodland.\n\nThere are no plans to stop the traditional activities, however. She explained: \u201cThis all adds to the more traditional agricultural income \u2013 the arable farm and longhorn cattle which is run by my sister Lucy, and my father remains hugely involved as does my brother Tom. We do the harvest in-house and contract lots of the day-to-day work out. But even here we\u2019ve diversified, our herd of English Longhorn cattle and our on-site butchery allows us to sell meat to local shops and direct to customers.\u201d", "description": "Some farmers are making more money from glamping than food, as the Countryside Land and Business Association (CLA) tells members that holidaymakers can save their businesses.", "authors": ["Helena Horton", "Benedict Spence", "Michael Gove", "Nick Timothy", "Matthew Lesh"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/25/luxury-glamping-suffolk-kenton-hall-estate-featured-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqEDjTm7JpzhSGR1_8ApEWQA1vLvhkMtVb21dMmpQBfEs.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
