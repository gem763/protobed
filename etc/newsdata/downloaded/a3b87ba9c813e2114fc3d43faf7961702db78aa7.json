The \u201cit\u201d in question is subscribing people to his relatively new newsletter called Mark Halperin\u2019s Wide World of News. He\u2019s been pitching it all over social media and asking people to sign up for their daily dose of Halperin\u2019s opinions on various bits of political news.\n\nNothing wrong with that, right? But some people who didn\u2019t sign up suddenly began receiving the emails and not all of them were happy about it.\n\nFormer reporter Meredith Shiner revealed on Twitter that she had been unwittingly subscribed to Halperin\u2019s newsletter. She expressed frustration with the author\u2019s aggressive tactics. \u201cI did not consent to receiving this newsletter and I want the author to know and publicly acknowledge the importance of consent,\u201d Shiner wrote on Halperin\u2019s website. Halperin is also releasing a new book, much to the consternation of his critics. He interviewed more than 75 Democrat strategists and politicians for How to Beat Trump, due to be published in November. Some of the participants, including former Obama advisor David Axelrod, expressed regret about their decision to respond to Halperin\u2019s questions. Others, such as Joe Biden campaign adviser Anita Dunn, did not.\n\nI unsubscribed from the Mark Halperin newsletter I did not sign up for and took liberty to provide my own reason as to why I no longer want to receive it. pic.twitter.com/P64qomDsg7 \u2014 Meredith Shiner (@meredithshiner) September 4, 2019\n\nI\u2019m clearly not important enough to be automatically subscribed, so I haven\u2019t run into this issue. But one thing I have noticed is that Halperin was nearly radio silent on Twitter after his fall from grace, but then this summer he came back with a vengeance. I\u2019ve been following him for years and had almost forgotten that he was out there, but over the past few months, he\u2019s been tweeting a lot.\n\nNearly all of the tweets are just items from his WWoN website with links to drive people there. The others are pitches to sign up for his newsletter or promotions of his upcoming book. His level of reach and interactions is kind of dismal, however. Here\u2019s one of his tweets from yesterday which, at the time of this writing, had garnered a grand total of four retweets and five likes.\n\nMark Halperin's Wide World of News for Friday, September 6, 2019https://t.co/Tu6yk2efOK \u2014 Mark Halperin (@MarkHalperin) September 6, 2019\n\nThat\u2019s kind of remarkable when you consider that this is a guy with well over 300K followers and he\u2019s getting basically zero interaction. It\u2019s as if nobody wants to be seen talking to him, so he hasn\u2019t gotten any sort of amnesty in the social media world the way some other accused Me Too perpetrators have. But it\u2019s not as if nobody is seeing his tweets. When I looked at his Twitter page I noticed that there were more than 400 people I follow who also follow Halperin.\n\nAnd in the few cases where he is drawing comments, most of the ones I saw over the past week or so were either from Trump supporters who were berating him or people reminding him he still hasn\u2019t apologized for his behavior. In short, Mark Halperin still appears to be a pariah in political circles. I can\u2019t imagine how many copies of that book his publisher thinks they\u2019re going to sell.\n\nThat Wide World of News page is a bit curious as well. (I linked it at the top of this article.) I hadn\u2019t visited it before today, but the layout is really kind of strange. It\u2019s reminiscent of one of the earliest blogs from the days of Blogger. It has a white background and it just scrolls endlessly downward with one day\u2019s entries after another and no obvious way to search or link straight to any particular bits of content. This is a man who was working in media for many years. Seems like he could have gotten someone to design something a bit more user-friendly.\n\nIn any event, I suppose the message here is that Halperin is back, baby! Not that you could tell at a quick glance.", "description": "Well, not *just* women", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/halperin-glower.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
