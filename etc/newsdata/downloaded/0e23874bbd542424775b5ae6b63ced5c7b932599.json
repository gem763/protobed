Schulte said the officer, who police have not named, did not realize the son was home.\n\n\"It was a mistake,\" Schulte said. \"It was a startling situation. It was an accident.\"\n\nThe Dallas Police Department referred USA TODAY to DeSoto police. DeSoto police said they had been in contact with the Dallas department.\n\nThe officer's garage door was open and other doors that had been unlocked were locked when the officer arrived at the home in DeSoto, a suburb of Dallas, Schulte said.\n\n\"It caused him to have some concern that there's something in the house. Then things happened very quickly,\" Schulte said.\n\nSchulte described the officer as a \"long-term veteran of the Dallas Police Department\" and said DeSoto police didn't \"fault him\" for not calling police when he thought something might be wrong.\n\nThe officer told police he wanted to check the house out himself before he \"wasted a call to 911,\" Schulte said.\n\n\"If you come home and something doesn't feel right, doesn't bother us at all. Go ahead and call 911 so we can come out and check it out,\" Schulte added.\n\nThe officer is not expected to be charged in the incident, Schulte said. \"This just happens to be one of those situations where accidents do happen,\" Schulte said.\n\nThe incident follows the recent police shooting of Atatiana Jefferson, who was killed in her Fort Worth home earlier this month while playing video games with her nephew. Officer Aaron Dean is facing a murder charge in that case.\n\nIn Dallas, former officer Amber Guyger was sentenced this month to 10 years in prison after she fatally shot Botham Jean in his own apartment, thinking he was an intruder in her home.\n\nFollow USA TODAY's Ryan Miller on Twitter @RyanW_Miller\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: DeSoto Texas police: Dallas officer shot son, thought he was intruder", "description": "The incident occurred Saturday evening when the off-duty Dallas police officer returned home and thought someone might be inside, DeSoto police said.", "authors": ["Ryan W.
