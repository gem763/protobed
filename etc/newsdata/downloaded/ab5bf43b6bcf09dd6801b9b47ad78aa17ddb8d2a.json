(AP) \u2014 The winless Miami Dolphins have again changed starting quarterbacks because coach Brian Flores changed his mind.\n\nRyan Fitzpatrick will make his first start since Week 2 when the Dolphins play at Buffalo on Sunday. Flores had previously said Josh Rosen would remain the starter after Fitzpatrick came off the bench and nearly rallied Miami to its first victory last Sunday against Washington.\n\n\u201cWe moved the ball better with Ryan in the game, and I think we need to stay with that,\u201d Flores said Wednesday. \u201cCame to that conclusion over the last couple of days. We feel that was the best thing for this team, and it\u2019ll give us the best opportunity for this team to go up into a tough environment and try to pull out a win.\u201d\n\nThe Dolphins (0-5) are 17-point underdogs against the Bills (4-1).\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited,\u201d said Fitzpatrick, 36, who played for the Bills in 2009-12. \u201cI just enjoy playing football. I like being out there. It\u2019s a lot more fun for me to be out there and playing. Preparation is a lot more fun when you\u2019re the guy, so I\u2019ll be lot happier day to day knowing I\u2019ll be out there.\u201d\n\nFitzpatrick started the first two games of the season, and Rosen started the past three. Rosen had perhaps his worst game of the year Sunday and was benched at the start of the fourth quarter with Miami trailing 17-3.\n\nFitzpatrick led the Dolphins to two late touchdowns, doubling their season total, but they failed to convert a two-point try in the final seconds and lost 17-16.\n\nWith the frantic rally, the inconsistent but sometimes dynamic veteran lived up to his nickname of FitzMagic.\n\n\u201cHistorically there have been times in my career, whatever team it has been on, that we have gotten on a little bit of a roll,\u201d the 15-year veteran said. \u201cThat momentum is a fun feeling. Hopefully there\u2019s a lot more of that to come.\u201d\n\nRosen acknowledged he played badly and had no quarrel with being demoted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m bummed out, but if coach wants to make the decision, it\u2019s his decision to make,\u201d Rosen said. \u201cI wish I would have made it a little tougher on him. But it\u2019s a long season. I\u2019m going to continue to push Fitz and be there for him, like he was there for me.\u201d\n\nThe decision undercuts this week\u2019s criticism that the Dolphins were sticking with Rosen because they\u2019re intent on finishing with the NFL\u2019s worst record to secure the No. 1 draft pick. Rosen\u2019s demotion also underscores the likelihood Miami will use its top pick next year to take a QB.\n\nRosen ranks last among qualifying quarterbacks in passer rating, completion percentage and yards per attempt, and the second-year pro is 3-13 as a starter.\n\n\u201cFor him it\u2019s got to be day-to-day improvement,\u201d Flores said. \u201cThat was the conversation I had with him. He\u2019s still a young, talented player, and there\u2019s still a lot of room for development with him, and we\u2019ll continue to develop him in practice.\u201d\n\nFitzpatrick\u2019s statistics are only slightly better, but he threw for 132 yards in one quarter against the Redskins, with no sacks or interceptions.\n\nThe Dolphins are on pace to score 134 points, which would be the fewest by any team in a 16-game season.\n\n\u201cOffensively we need more production,\u201d Flores said. \u201cWe got that out of Ryan the other day for a quarter.\u201d\n\nThe revolving door at QB is nothing new for the Dolphins, who have had 21 starters at the position since Dan Marino retired nearly 20 years ago.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nFollow Steven Wine on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Steve_Wine", "description": "DAVIE, Fla.
