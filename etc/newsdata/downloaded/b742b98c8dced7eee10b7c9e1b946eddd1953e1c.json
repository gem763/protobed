And I think that those tensions are something we have to live with.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"In general, in a democracy, I think that people should be able to hear for themselves what politicians are saying,\" Zuckerberg continued. \"Often, the people who call the most for us to remove content are often the first to complain when its their content that falls on the wrong side of a policy.\"\n\nIn the 35-minute speech at Georgetown Thursday afternoon, Zuckerberg elaborated on that defense, saying that having tech company's moderate content could be dangerous.\n\n\"Political ads on Facebook are more transparent than anywhere else,\" Zuckerberg said. \"We don't factcheck political ads\u2026 because we believe people should be able to see for themselves what politicians are saying.\n\n\"I know many people disagree, but in general I don't think it's right for a private company to censor politicians or the news in a democracy. And we are not an outlier here.\"\n\nRead more here.\n\n& ON THAT CHINA BUSINESS\u2026: Mark Zuckerberg hit China's model for the internet in a speech Thursday, saying that Facebook could not operate there without compromising its values.\n\n\"I wanted our services in China because I believe in connecting the whole world, and I thought maybe we could help creating a more open society,\" Zuckerberg during a speech at Georgetown University.\n\n\"I worked hard on this for a long time, but we could never come to agreement on what it would take for us to operate there and they never let us in.\"\n\nZuckerberg spent a large portion of Thursday's appearance defending Facebook as a vehicle for freedom of expression and expanding free speech.\n\nHe contrasted that view with China's model, which he said has been stifling mentions of protests on Chinese apps.\n\nHe specifically mentioned TikTok, a video sharing platform whose parent company ByteDance reportedly released guidelines recently effectively banning criticism of the Chinese government.\n\n\"Until recently, the internet in almost every country outside China has been defined by American platforms with strong free expression values,\" he said. \"But there's no guarantee that these values will win out. A decade ago, almost all of the major internet platforms were American. Today, six of the top ten are Chinese.\"\n\nRead more here.\n\nBIDEN GOES AFTER ZUCK: Former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenTrump says lawmakers should censure Schiff Schiff says committees will eventually make impeachment inquiry transcripts public Trump threat lacks teeth to block impeachment witnesses MORE's presidential campaign on Thursday hit Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg over a speech where the executive defended his company's decision not to take down political advertisements with inaccuracies.\n\n\"Facebook has chosen to sell Americans' personal data to politicians looking to target them with disproven lies and conspiracy theories, crowding out the voices of working Americans,\" Bill Russo, the Biden campaign's deputy communications director, said in a statement.\n\n\"Zuckerberg attempted to use the Constitution as a shield for his company's bottom line, and his choice to cloak Facebook's policy in a feigned concern for free expression demonstrates how unprepared his company is for this unique moment in our history and how little it has learned over the past few years.\"\n\nBiden's campaign lashed out after Zuckerberg delivered a speech at Georgetown University where he argued that it is not Facebook's role to moderate political content.\n\nRead more here.\n\nLOCK 'EM UP: Sen.

The personal information included was not redacted as required by Section 6(b) of the Consumer Product Safety Act.\n\nThe committee, led by Chairman Roger Wicker Roger Frederick WickerLawmakers toast Greta Van Susteren's new show Hillicon Valley: Trump official declines to testify on trade protections for tech | Senators call for better info-sharing on supply chain threats | Apple pulls app after Chinese pressure Key Democrat presses FTC over Facebook settlement's 'dangerous precedent' MORE (R-Miss.), was informed of the disclosures in April and subsequently sent letters to the agency and interviewed employees about the breach, concluding that \"the series of improper disclosures is likely attributable to incompetence and mismanagement rather than deliberate, bad-faith efforts by senior managers or commissioners.\"\n\nThe committee recommended that the CPSC implement formal training for all new employees on how to handle personal consumer data, review information technology used to process data requests and implement policies to ensure that CPSC management reviews all sensitive data requests.\n\nWicker wrote in a letter to acting CPSC Director Robert Adler on Wednesday that while the data disclosures were \"concerning,\" the committee concluded they did not occur due to deliberate steps, but were entirely accidental.\n\nRead more here.\n\nSMALL BIZ HEARING AHEAD: The House Small Business Committee Chairwoman Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez (D-N.Y.) on Thursday formally invited some of the largest tech companies in the country to testify at an upcoming hearing about whether their practices harm small businesses.\n\nVel\u00e1zquez invited Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple to testify at a hearing in November, underlining that the committee is looking for a response by Oct. 31.\n\n\"It is no secret that big tech platforms have grown exponentially in the digital era, altering the ways American consumers buy products and shifting many traditional business models,\" Vel\u00e1zquez said in a statement.\n\n\"Given this, I believe it is appropriate and necessary to bring big tech companies and small businesses to the table to discuss how the rise in online retail and digital platforms is shaping the playing field for America's small firms,\" she said. \"I look forward to the hearing and hope to confirm the presence of Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Apple in the coming weeks.\"\n\nAmazon and Facebook both confirmed they have received the invitation. Google and Apple did not immediately respond to The Hill's request for comment.\n\nRead more on the hearing here.\n\nDIVIDED WE STAND: Democratic divisions over how to tackle Big Tech were on display at the latest primary debate as presidential contenders sparred over whether to break up Silicon Valley's giants, how social media should handle President Trump Donald John TrumpGOP congressman slams Trump over report that U.S. bombed former anti-ISIS coalition headquarters US to restore 'targeted assistance' to Central American countries after migration deal Trump says lawmakers should censure Schiff MORE's tweets and whether the government is doing enough to prevent interference in U.S. elections using social media.\n\nWhile Democrats uniformly vowed to challenge the tech industry and its practices, the debate highlighted candidates' differences on the issue, as each of the hopefuls offered distinct proposals for reining in companies' market power, protecting privacy and safeguarding elections.\n\nThe roughly 10 minutes likely marked the longest-ever discussion about tech's market power and privacy practices during a presidential debate, experts told The Hill, signaling the importance of the issue in 2020.\n\nThe candidates seemed to agree only that the government should somehow confront the world's largest tech companies, but they were divided on how.\n\n\"I think that conversation has transformed,\" Tim Wu, a leading tech antitrust expert and professor at Columbia University Law School, told The Hill. \"[The American electorate] has always turned on our biggest companies and begun to question if they become too powerful. It's natural, it's healthy, to start to ask those questions of the former darlings of the Democratic Party.\"\n\nThe tech conversation kicked off with a question from the moderators about whether the candidates supported Sen.

But for months, candidates have hedged and side-stepped about where they come down on the issue, sporadically offering smaller-scale proposals to rein in Big Tech.\n\nNone of the other candidates explicitly endorsed Warren's approach, which would impose tougher antitrust rules and require companies including Google and Facebook to spin off elements of their businesses.\n\nRead more here.\n\nA LIGHTER CLICK: Comments that are very real and not fake.\n\nAN OP-ED TO CHEW ON: Social media shouldn't be a 'sanctuary city' for child pornographers\n\nNOTABLE LINKS FROM AROUND THE WEB:\n\nCyber group that hacked DNC in 2016 is back in action targeting European foreign ministries (ZDNet)\n\nHow a massive Facebook scam siphoned millions of dollars from unsuspecting boomers (Buzzfeed)\n\nVideo giant Twitch pushes Trump rallies and mass violence into the live-stream age.
