They don\u2019t want those people out any more than we do,\u201d he said.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 Two \u201chigh-value\u201d jihadists held by Syrian Kurds have been taken into US custody and moved out of the country, a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/09/27b192_captured-british-islamic-state-is-fighters-el-shafee-el-sheikh-alexanda-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
