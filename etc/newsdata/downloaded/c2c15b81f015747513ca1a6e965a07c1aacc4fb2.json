A spokesperson said: \u201cScottish Rugby once again expresses its sincere condolences to the people of Japan and all those affected by Typhoon Hagibis which struck last weekend.\n\n\u201cWe have been able to convey our best wishes directly to the mayor of Yokohama and the chairman of the Japanese Rugby Union. We stand with the great people of Japan.\n\nScotland\u00b4s World Cup came to an end with a defeat to hosts Japan (David Davies/PA)\n\n\u201cFollowing receipt of correspondence yesterday from World Rugby, Scottish Rugby confirms that it has received a notice of complaint from Rugby World Cup Ltd. Scottish Rugby is querying whether the matter is an appropriate one for the bringing of misconduct charges.\n\nREAD | RWC 2019 \u2013 Scottish Rugby statement.https://t.co/WOSfZZovIf \u2014 Scottish Rugby (@Scotlandteam) October 16, 2019\n\n\u201cIf misconduct proceedings are to proceed, Scottish Rugby looks forward to receiving a fair hearing in this matter. No further comment would be appropriate at this time.\u201d\n\nDodson called a press conference last Friday to urge World Rugby to use \u201ccommon sense\u201d and move the game back 24 hours.\n\nAsked if further legal action could be a possible step if the game was scrapped, Dodson said: \u201cI think our view is that we have to reflect on that matter at that time.\n\n\u201cThis is a glorious, world-class sporting occasion. We don\u2019t want to be the people that taint that. But we also don\u2019t want to be the collateral damage of this.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s why we took the legal route. It was just to say we\u2019ve had a different opinion, two different opinions, one from the QC, that challenges that rigidity over scheduling.\u201d\n\nWhat a moment!
