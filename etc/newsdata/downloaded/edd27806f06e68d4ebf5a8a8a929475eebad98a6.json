REUTERS/Jason Lee\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, a press conference with the two teams was delayed indefinitely, organisers said, and a Reuters witness saw workers tearing down giant banners advertising the exhibition game between the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets.\n\nSponsors and partners had already cut ties with the NBA after a tweet by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey last week supported anti-government protests in the Chinese-ruled city, and NBA commissioner Adam Silver backed his right to free speech.\n\nHere are comments from Chinese fans.\n\nYU JIE, FAN WAITING TO SEE NBA PLAYERS IN SHANGHAI\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why political conflicts affect sporting events. Just because they don\u2019t want us to see Morey\u2019s comments on TV, the fans\u2019 night has been cancelled.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m patriotic of course. I support that Hong Kong is part of China, but I just don\u2019t understand this.\u201d\n\nXU ZIYANG, ANOTHER FAN OUTSIDE THE PLAYERS\u2019 HOTEL\n\n\u201cPersonal opinions belong to them. It doesn\u2019t affect us chasing the stars.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know if the players will come out, but they should appear at night to eat dinner or go shopping. The fans\u2019 night has been cancelled - that can\u2019t be helped - but I think they will appear\u201d.\n\nKEITH YUEN, NBA BASKETBALL FAN IN HONG KONG\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he (Silver) is mixing up sports and politics. I think he was speaking as a U.S. citizen on this occasion. I\u2019m really grateful for his support and the support of the majority of the U.S. citizens.\u201d", "description": "Chinese organisers on Wednesday cancelled a fan event on the eve of a planned National Basketball Association (NBA) exhibition game in Shanghai, part of an escalating row over a team official who supported protests in Hong Kong.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438774983&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF980PG", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
