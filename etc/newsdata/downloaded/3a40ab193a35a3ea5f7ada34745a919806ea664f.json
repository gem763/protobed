Photo: Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Imag\n\nIf you\u2019ve never heard of Joe Walsh, well, that\u2019s about the only thing he has in common with many of the people who are currently running for president \u2014 that, and the fact that now he\u2019s running, too.\n\nWalsh is a smooth-talking conservative known as much for his unfastened persona on Twitter and on the radio as he is for the single term he served as the tea-party congressman from Illinois.\n\nLast Sunday, he announced his campaign for the Republican nomination \u2014 joining a sparse primary field on the right that includes just one other barely known entity: Bill Weld, the former governor of Massachusetts with hair the radioactive color of yellow Gatorade who, in 2016, ran as veep on the Libertarian ticket with Gary Johnson.\n\nSince his announcement, Walsh has taken up semi-permanent residence in the psyches of professional take-havers and in our nation\u2019s television studios, where he\u2019s been selling the confounding story of his recent transformation from obedient Trump voter to never-Trumper. And he has set up a contrast with the president: He apologized for the dumb, offensive, and racist things he\u2019s said in the past.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how much of an appetite Republican voters, 80 percent of whom approve of Trump, have for such contrast. But Walsh is making a bet that the president is more vulnerable than the surveys suggest. Whether that\u2019s the case, politics is showbiz, baby, and the telegenic Walsh \u2014 who looks like a cross of Will Ferrell, Rahm Emanuel, and a loyal beagle \u2014 is giving the cable networks and click-mongers a bit of the precious, precious drama that they (well, we) need to survive. Throughout this past week, I spoke to Walsh at length about the presidential campaign, racism, how he explains his most fucked-up statements, and what happens if he accidentally gets himself elected president. Our conversations have been condensed for clarity.\n\nCan you can you walk me through how you arrived at your decision to run?\n\nBecause the guy\u2019s a madman. The guy is completely unfit and unhinged. He lies every time he opens his mouth. When he got elected, Olivia, look: I voted for him. I didn\u2019t love him. I didn\u2019t like him. He wasn\u2019t Hillary.\n\nWhen he first got elected, I tried doing the good-Trump-bad-Trump thing every day. But that didn\u2019t last that long, because I realized pretty quickly that he just lies all the time, and then he finally lost me at Helsinki, when he stood in front of the world and said, \u201cI\u2019m with Putin and not my own people.\u201d From that moment on, a little over a year ago, it\u2019s just been downhill.\n\nI\u2019m stunned and disappointed that a bigger Republican isn\u2019t challenging him. I waited for months, and I thought somebody would get in. I wrote a piece in the New York Times three weeks ago, and that piece was a plea. I would tweet and say stuff on my radio show with every idiotic thing he did, Come on guys, somebody \u2014 and it just wasn\u2019t happening, and some people came to me, and I started to look into it the last month or so.\n\nCan you tell me about the people who came to you?\n\nNo surprise: Bill Kristol and I had a conversation a couple of months ago. Bill, obviously, has been trying to find someone to take him on, because he feels the same way I have, and that conversation led to a bunch of other conversations.\n\nSo how do you justify voting for Trump over Hillary? I understand you don\u2019t like Hillary, a lot of conservatives feel very strongly about her, but it\u2019s not as if we didn\u2019t know who Trump was, right? It\u2019s not like he was only revealed to be an asshole within the last year.\n\nYou know what\u2019s funny, Olivia, and I don\u2019t want to sound na\u00efve: I didn\u2019t know he was this big of an ass. I didn\u2019t know he was this unfit. I just always figured he was a goof. Not a very smart guy. But he\u2019d at least hire some good people and maybe a few good things might happen. But I didn\u2019t know that, financially, the guy was an absolute disaster, that he\u2019d lost more money than anybody in the country. In a way, we didn\u2019t really know that much about him, except he was a playboy who\u2019s never had to work for anything in his life.\n\n\u201cWe\u201d \u2014 what do you mean?\n\nThose of us who voted for Trump. In a weird way, as high profile as he was, there was a lot that we didn\u2019t know about him. And so it was a fairly easy vote, because I\u2019m not gonna vote for Hillary. You know who I am, politically, I\u2019m a disruptive guy. I figured maybe he\u2019ll shake both political parties up because, to me, both political parties are worthless. It became clear that it wasn\u2019t just disruptive. It\u2019s dishonesty, conspiracy, and everything else.\n\nWhat\u2019s your impression of the Democratic field right now?\n\nAside from me running, I don\u2019t want Trump to win. So I hope that there\u2019s a Democrat that can get elected. Joe Biden seems to be a safe pick \u2014 he looks kind of old and shaky to me. Elizabeth Warren, who I don\u2019t like politically, seems to be the best, most energetic, sincere, committed candidate. I think she might not be able to beat Trump. I wish there was a stronger candidate. But you know what? Maybe it doesn\u2019t matter. I think dislike of Trump is so profound \u2014 I mean, Republicans got their butts whipped in 2018!\n\nSo then why not just support one of the Democratic candidates?\n\nYou\u2019re asking that question as if I wasn\u2019t going to run.\n\nAssuming that your goal is to make sure that Trump doesn\u2019t get elected \u2014 is that a fair assessment of your goal?\n\nWell, my goal is to beat him. As difficult as you and I know that is going to be, I wouldn\u2019t do this if I didn\u2019t at least have that as my primary goal. Aside from that, to me, 2020 is bad versus wrong. Trump\u2019s bad for America. I think generally the Democrats\u2019 ideas are wrong for America. If I wasn\u2019t going to run, I\u2019m not voting for Trump either way. Would I vote for a Democrat? Maybe.\n\nIf the Republican Party enabled Trump to get elected and the Republican Party has allowed him to continue to be a fucking idiot for the last two and a half years, is there not something fundamentally wrong with the current Republican Party?\n\nYes \u2014 amen.\n\nSo then why do you want to preserve it?\n\nTo get it back to what it was a long, long time ago, before I ran for office. At least the party that energetically fought for freedom and limited government. The party sucks so bad. But we live in a two-party country. And that may change soon, who knows. But we need a viable, passionate limited-government party in this country, because the Democrats are gangbusters about what they believe.\n\nYou think that? I think a lot of people on the left would disagree with that assessment of the Democratic Party.\n\nI think they\u2019re wrong. I think they\u2019re understandably gun-shy. None of the Democrats thought Trump would win, and so now they\u2019re doing the reverse thing. They\u2019re like, \u201cOh my God, we suck, we\u2019re not gonna beat Trump.\u201d Cool it, guys! I think the Democratic Party right now is in strong shape.\n\nYou\u2019ve historically been at odds with the Republican Party, so why are you even a Republican? Why not be an independent?\n\nMaybe that\u2019s where I\u2019m going. Maybe this is my last effort to try to do what I can to move and influence the Republican Party in this two-party world we live in, and maybe it won\u2019t work, and maybe post-Trump, all hell\u2019s gonna break loose anyway.\n\nI assume, going into this, it wasn\u2019t a surprise to you that people would be digging into your past.\n\nOh, God, no. I always figured that if I did this, what would people go after Joe Walsh for? It\u2019s stuff I\u2019ve said. I\u2019ve probably sent out 50,000 tweets in the last six years. I\u2019ve been on the radio for how many hours in the last six years. I always figured it would be stuff I\u2019ve said, and I\u2019ve said some stupid stuff. I\u2019ve said some offensive stuff. I\u2019ve said some insulting stuff, some ugly stuff. When you\u2019re as outspoken as I am, you\u2019re gonna step in it. I\u2019ve always tried to explain and own my tweets and apologize when it\u2019s necessary.\n\nI saw you on CNN the other night, and you said, \u201cWe\u2019re all a little racist.\u201d Can you expand on that?\n\nWhat I was trying to say is, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a racist.\u201d I know I\u2019m not a racist. I think if we\u2019re all honest, we\u2019re all a little bit racist. I think if we\u2019re all honest, almost all of us, over the course of our lives, have said some stupid things and made some racist remarks, offensive remarks, and certainly, Olivia, people like me, who have been in the public eye and very outspoken and pushed the boundaries on these issues \u2014 I\u2019m sure there are times when I\u2019ve said things that people can interpret as racist. I\u2019m just trying to be honest. I think because I\u2019m in the public eye, I have to be held accountable for what I\u2019ve said. But I think we\u2019re all capable of it, most of us, even if it\u2019s not purposeful. I just think people need to be honest about that. If that makes sense.\n\nUh, sort of. If you were saying that we all have our implicit biases because of our worldview and the way we were raised and our race and gender, maybe everyone has a bit of intolerance on some level?\n\nWe\u2019re all so eager and quick to pounce when somebody says something that can even remotely be considered racist, and so people get afraid to say things, and we\u2019re all quick to judge, and I think we live in glass houses, because a lot of the people who throw stones \u2014 I just think if we\u2019re honest. I shouldn\u2019t say we all are. But I think many of us have stepped in it on occasion and said things that we\u2019ve regretted that could be interpreted as racist. I\u2019m certainly out there and saying things more than the average bear. I guess all I\u2019m trying to do is be honest and apologize for things I\u2019ve said that can be interpreted as racist.\n\nBut I\u2019ve had conversations with people who are overtly racist about the N-word. And my feelings about the N-word, or any term like that, is that either that word is something that is in your vocabulary and it\u2019s something you might accidentally say, or it is not in your vocabulary. And if it\u2019s not in your vernacular, then you don\u2019t just utter it. I feel the same way about any explicitly racist or intolerant comment. Either that\u2019s in your brain or it\u2019s not in your brain. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a matter, most of the time, of misspeaking, if that makes sense \u2014\n\nIt does make sense. And trying to be as honest as I can: Because I\u2019m so outspoken, and I push the envelope on a lot of issues, and I have pushed the envelope on race because I have strong interest on the issue of race, I always have, I\u2019m sure that I\u2019ve said things that people would interpret as being racist, because I say things that most people won\u2019t say to push a discussion on the issue of racism.\n\nWould you say that you\u2019ve ever held racist beliefs?\n\nI would say no. I mean, honestly, looking at myself, I don\u2019t believe I\u2019m racist. No.\n\nWhen it comes to what you\u2019ve said about Islam: How do you feel about Islam today?\n\nOf the 60,000 tweets I\u2019ve sent out \u2014 I found out exactly, it\u2019s 60,000 tweets \u2014 the issue of Islam is an issue I\u2019ve spoken out a lot about. I have always tried to be careful \u2014 I have not always succeeded \u2014 in distinguishing between Islam and Islamism. I believe Islamism is a bad, evil ideology. I don\u2019t believe Islam is. So if you went through everything I said about Islam and Islamism, I\u2019m generally harshly criticizing Islamism. There have been times where I\u2019ve screwed up and conflated Islam and Islamism and said things about Islam in general that I would apologize for.\n\nCan you help me understand the distinction you\u2019re trying to make?\n\nIslamism is an ideology that believes Islam should conquer the world and people who are not Islam need to convert or whatever. It is more of, when we talk about Sharia law, you don\u2019t separate religion and the state. It\u2019s Islam in its most radical, political form. Islamism is, I\u2019m sorry.\n\nOkay \u2026 But in terms of people of Muslim faith. How do you feel, generally, about people of Muslim faith?\n\nThe same way I feel about people, generally, of the Christian faith or the Jewish faith. It doesn\u2019t matter to me. If you\u2019re a God-fearing, peace-loving, whatever kind of a person, I don\u2019t care what color or faith you are. If you are of a radical ideology, no matter what your religion or faith is, and you are not tolerant of other faiths. Most Islamists are not tolerant of other faith \u2014 well then, yeah, I\u2019d have a problem with that.\n\nWould it not be, I don\u2019t know, more productive to talk about radical terrorist ideology being promoted under the guise of the Muslim faith? Because most people of Muslim faith look at radical terrorists and say, \u201cThey don\u2019t represent my faith.\u201d Just the way that most Christians look at any white Christian shooter and say, \u201cThat person\u2019s not a Christian, and they don\u2019t represent my faith.\u201d\n\nWhen you speak to most peaceful Muslims, the average, peaceful, normal, moderate, freedom-loving Muslim, they\u2019ll tell you about the Islamists. That is where the radical Islamic ideology, the terrorism and all of that, comes from. I don\u2019t think the average American is aware of the difference between Islam and Islamism.\n\nI grew up in a post-9/11 world. The right was very successful in fearmongering about Muslims, broadly, and not making any distinctions between terrorists and people of Muslim faith \u2014 regardless of what George W. Bush\u2019s rhetoric was in the immediate aftermath of the attacks.\n\nTotally agree. Totally agree.\n\nBut we\u2019re talking about billions of people. It\u2019s a lot of fucking people. And most of them are definitely not terrorists.\n\nYou\u2019re right. It\u2019s unfortunate. That\u2019s really too bad. And I suppose I\u2019ve been guilty of this as well because I\u2019ve been so outspoken about it. Way too many Americans have assumed that all Muslims are bad and that\u2019s wrong and that\u2019s horrible.\n\nDid you ever have similar assumptions?\n\nNo! Never, never! Only because I\u2019m not some uneducated dope on this issue. Like with the issue of race, it\u2019s an issue I care about, so it\u2019s an issue I study, and it\u2019s an issue that, when I talk about it or tweet about it, I try to make a real fine distinction between Muslims in general and the radical element of Islam, Islamists and the terrorists and all the rest.\n\nBut looking at the tweets that you\u2019ve sent about it, in my mind it\u2019s like, I don\u2019t see any similar statements from you using any kind of similar language talking about radical Christian terrorists in America. So it seems like a dog whistle to people who hold racist beliefs on the right, whether or not you say that you do yourself.\n\nNo, and what\u2019s not fair, Olivia, is you\u2019re probably looking at a few of the more egregious tweets where I\u2019ve admitted that I mistakenly stepped over the line and confused my intention of directing my tweet at Islamists and not Muslims.\n\nThere seems to be a pattern of you \u201cstepping over the line\u201d when it comes to Muslims, but I don\u2019t see a similar pattern of you stepping over the line when it comes to Christian extremists or extremists of other faiths, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s hard for me to accept the idea that you were not trying to be outrageous and sound a dog whistle to racists on the right.\n\nI\u2019d respond in two ways: If you went through all my tweets, you\u2019re gonna find 50 times as many tweets where I went after Islamic terrorists and I went after Islamists. I mean, maybe a hundred times more. You may find a handful of tweets where I screwed up and I said Muslims instead of radical terrorists. That\u2019s one. But the second issue is, let\u2019s be real, when I went to Congress, eight, nine years ago, the threat domestically \u2014 Eric Holder said this! \u2014 the threat domestically was young, Muslim American men becoming radicalized and coming back here to commit acts of terror. Fast forward nine years: Christopher Wray said three weeks ago that the threat that keeps him up is these radical white-supremacist acts of terror. I\u2019ve been really strong this last year calling out white-supremacy terror.\n\nIf you look at the terror committed on American soil since 9/11, it\u2019s statistically overwhelming that it has been committed more by white nationalists than by foreign actors.\n\nI\u2019d dispute you on that [Note: I am right]. It\u2019s one of the few things I agreed with Eric Holder on. He identified that as our main domestic threat as recently as eight, nine years ago. I will acknowledge that we\u2019ve done a pretty decent job against it here domestically and now we have to do the same job against white supremacy.\n\nWhat do you say to people who remain skeptical of you, who hear your apologies or hear you clarifying and say, \u201cI don\u2019t believe him?\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s nothing I can do except continue to own, explain, and apologize as genuinely as I can, and people will either believe or not believe. If the apology is genuine \u2014 and I\u2019m just speaking for myself: It is \u2014 we either forgive or don\u2019t forgive, and I hope that we have not become so polarized today that people on both sides aren\u2019t willing to forgive. If people on both sides aren\u2019t willing to forgive, then we\u2019re gonna be divided forever.\n\nWhen you\u2019re talking about the racist beliefs you think people hold on some level, whether or not they admit it, would you allow that any of those beliefs, on any level, conscious or subconscious, motivated you to be so hypercritical of Barack Obama?\n\nActually, no. And this has always been an issue that bothered me, Olivia. I despise Barack Obama\u2019s politics, and Barack Obama\u2019s politics and Joe Walsh\u2019s politics were a hundred and 80 degrees apart. What always bothered me, what many people on our side back then felt, was like if you did attack Barack Obama\u2019s policies, a lot of us felt that too easily people were then accused of racism because you attacked or criticized the nation\u2019s first black president. I can speak for myself: Every criticism I had of Barack Obama was based on his policies, period.\n\nWhen I look at 2016, it\u2019s pretty clear to me that a lot of what motivated people to vote for Donald Trump was a racist backlash to Barack Obama. Do you think that\u2019s a fair characterization?\n\nNo. You and I will agree on a lot, but only because I\u2019ve had the experience of talking to these people for six years \u2014\n\nSo have I. I talk to Trump supporters every day. And I don\u2019t think that they are awful people. I don\u2019t think that every Trump voter is \u201cdeplorable,\u201d but I think it\u2019s pretty clear that when you look at that election, and who was motivated, that there was a racist backlash.\n\nI never felt that way when it came to Trump voters that a vote for Trump was a backlash against Obama\u2019s race. Obviously, I didn\u2019t feel that way. I never felt that way about 94 percent of Trump voters that I\u2019ve spoken to over the years. It was a backlash against Obama. It was a backlash against his policies. I just never picked up the race angle to it. That\u2019s just always struck me as so unfair. I understand there are racists who support Trump, but I think the vast majority, no.\n\nAre you open to the idea that maybe your own implicit bias, because of who you are and your worldview, blinds you to some of that? Because I admit I don\u2019t see the world the same way that a woman of color sees the world, because I don\u2019t experience the world the same way that a woman of color experiences the world. So there are things that I can learn from listening to people of color talk about their experience that, if I\u2019m just walking through the world on my own, I\u2019d never be aware of. And I realize that I\u2019m blinded to a lot about how the world works because of that, because I\u2019m a white woman from the East Coast.\n\nWell, yeah, that is endemic in all of us. We are who we are, and we are from where we\u2019re from. You said it better than I did, so if I can take it back, I\u2019ll take it back: We\u2019re all biased. We\u2019re not all racist. We\u2019re all biased. We all discriminate. We all have our prejudices. I guess that\u2019s a better way to put it. But you\u2019re not dummy and I\u2019m not dummy. And I can sit here with you for 30 minutes and tell you why I opposed Barack Obama, and it had nothing to do with the color of that man\u2019s skin. I never felt that way.\n\nWhat do you think motivates you, psychologically, to be \u201cprovocative?\u201d\n\nI wanna make a difference. Like, I wanna get people to think. I hate political correctness. And I hate the way that in this damn country of late, we stifle speech. I recoil against that. So I try to really push the envelope. To say provocative things. To get people to feel and to think. And to feel more open about talking about sensitive subjects. I guess that\u2019s one way I\u2019d put it.\n\nIf you\u2019re being really honest, though, is any of it motivated by a desire for attention? By liking the exhilaration of being in the crosshairs?\n\nNo. That just pisses me off.\n\nReally? I can admit it \u2014 I\u2019m in media, I go on television, it\u2019s because I have a side of me that is egomaniacal. Anyone who goes on television on purpose has that aspect, right? And I feel like if you\u2019re courting controversy, whether or not your actual goal is to have a conversation, if you\u2019re the agent to open up that conversation, then a part of you must enjoy that, must enjoy being at the center of it, must enjoy the controversy, the attention, that it results in.\n\nWell, I enjoy being in the battle. I enjoy being the tip of the spear. I enjoy being in the arena. It\u2019s not because there\u2019s a TV camera there. I like trying to make a difference. I like trying to get people to think about these things, whether there\u2019s a camera there or not. That\u2019s never been my motivation. It\u2019s not the reason I\u2019m doing this. Good God, no.\n\nReally?\n\nOh, Olivia! Come on!\n\nI\u2019m not saying I think it\u2019s the central reason. But nobody runs for president if they don\u2019t like attention, come on.\n\nNo, God no. I feel like I\u2019ve aged three years. This is the biggest pain-in-the-ass thing I\u2019ve ever done. Anyone who would do this because they simply want attention or that\u2019s the motivation? They need their heads examined. My God. This is too big of a pain in the ass for that.\n\nDonald Trump didn\u2019t think he was going to get himself elected president, either. So what happens if you accidentally get yourself elected president?\n\nYou know, nobody has asked me that. I think I\u2019d be a great president.", "description": "Joe Walsh, the one-term Illinois Congressman, Tea Partier, and conservative radio host who is primarying Donald Trump for the Republican nomination, discusses past racist comments, the \u201cstrong shape of the Democratic field, and his case for 2020.", "authors": ["Olivia Nuzzi"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/04/04-joe-walsh.w1200.h630.jpg"}
