On Tuesday, after a beach event, the couple visited the Auwul Mosque in Bo Kaap as a part of Heritage Day.\n\nMeghan changed out of her casual beach attire from the morning into an olive green, floor-length dress and a traditional white head scarf as a sign of respect. As for Harry, he changed into a tan suit with brown shoes and a white shirt underneath. The couple arrived at the mosque holding hands after they were seen sharing a kiss publicly earlier in the day.\n\nChris Jackson/Getty Images More\n\nThe mosque welcomes visitors of all denominations. It is the first mosque in South Africa, and the couple had the opportunity to view the first known manuscript of the Qu\u2019ran in South Africa. Inside, Meghan, 38, and Harry, 35, sat on the floor of the mosque and spoke with local leaders.\n\nMeghan certainly isn\u2019t the first female member of the royal family to don a headscarf as a sign of respect to Muslim culture. Both her sister-in-law, Kate Middleton, and her late mother-in-law, Princess Diana, have made appearances in similar white head scarves.\n\nTim Graham Photo Library via Getty Images, Chris Jackson More\n\nFollowing the visit, Meghan removed the head scarf to greet locals who had come out to catch a glimpse of the royals. A loud brass band played lively music for the couple as they shook hands and hugged well-wishers.\n\nFor more from the royal tour of Africa, watch the clip below:\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nMeghan Markle and Prince Harry Give Rare, Enthusiastic Interview During Royal Tour of Africa\n\nMeghan Markle Kisses Prince Harry, Says He\u2019s \u2018The Best Dad\u2019\n\nWhy We Won't See Much of Baby Archie During Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's Africa Tour (Exclusive)\n\nRelated Articles:", "description": "Both Kate Middleton and the late Princess Diana have worn similar head scarves on official appearances.", "authors": ["Rachel Mcrady"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9cLvjtYXh.yfsz9leXKkVA--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/e3626b917f8527978c9e71b11c83e3cc", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
