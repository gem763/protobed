The Justice Department has opened a broad antitrust probe into the technology industry, though it has not zeroed in on particular companies.\n\nIn July, the FTC fined Facebook $5 billion for mishandling users\u2019 personal information, and just this week the FTC announced that it would fine YouTube $136 million for targeting children with advertising, though in both cases the fines were largely regarded as little more than a slap on the wrist.", "description": "New York and Texas are leading investigations into tech giants\u2019 alleged anticompetitive behavior.", "authors": ["Blake Montgomery"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567798873/GettyImages-959804502_1_1_kwvenh", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
