REUTERS/Jorge Luis Plata\n\nPresident Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador responded to comments by Richard Glenn, the U.S. deputy assistant secretary of State for international narcotics and law enforcement, on Wednesday in the U.S. Congress.\n\n\u201cOfficials from other countries should not give their opinion on internal matters that only correspond to our government,\u201d Lopez Obrador said at a news conference.\n\n\u201cImagine if I were to declare that the strategy followed in the United States is wrong because it allows for the uncontrolled sale of weapons that then come in to Mexico and cause the death of civilians?\u201d he said, using U.S. gun laws as an example.\n\nGlenn told a congressional hearing in Washington on Wednesday that Mexico should develop a comprehensive strategy for fighting organized crime.\n\n\u201cWhat we need to see is greater political... commitment from the highest levels of government in Mexico,\u201d he said, in response to a question in the hearing about the lack of progress in containing drug cartels.\n\nGlenn\u2019s comments came a week after Sinaloa Cartel gunmen forced outmatched Mexican security forces to release one of the sons of jailed drug lord Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman, who had briefly been detained.\n\nLater during the news conference, held in Mexico\u2019s national palace, Lopez Obrador sought to underscore the two neighbors\u2019 strong ties by playing footage on a large screen behind him of U.S. President Donald Trump praising him at the United Nations last month.\n\nIn the clip, Trump touted Lopez Obrador\u2019s decision to deploy 27,000 militarized police to the U.S.-Mexico border to help thwart U.S.-bound migrants.\n\n\u201cMexico is showing us great respect, and I respect them in return,\u201d said Trump in the video, as Lopez Obrador stood by approvingly at his podium in the ornate auditorium where he holds court with reporters each morning.\n\nLopez Obrador\u2019s critics say he has done too much to cater to Trump\u2019s hardline immigration agenda.\n\nDuring his 2016 election campaign, Trump labeled Mexican migrants as rapists and criminals and since then has successfully used the threat of across-the-board tariffs to push Lopez Obrador to help police the border.", "description": "Mexico's president on Thursday accused a senior U.S. diplomat of lacking respect for Mexican sovereignty after he questioned the Mexican government's strategy for quelling drug cartel violence.", "authors": ["Julia Love", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444689350&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O01U", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
