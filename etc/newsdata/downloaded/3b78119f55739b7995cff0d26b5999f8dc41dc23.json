Not if you consider the career of Gen. John Shalikashvili", "language": "en", "text": "When John Shalikashvili\u2019s family applied to come to America from Europe in 1952, his unemployed parents \u2014 a former military officer and a housewife \u2014 were living off the charity of relatives. If at the time the United States had a merit-based immigration system, which the Trump administration is now proposing, the family\u2019s lack of resources and desirable labor-market attributes would have disqualified them from entry.\n\nBut the Shalikashvilis were allowed in \u2014 and to the great benefit of America\u2019s national security.\n\nDrafted into the Army in 1958, Shalikashvili rose to become chairman of the Joint Chiefs (CJCS), America\u2019s top general, in 1993. He played a key role in guiding the United States, Europe, and beyond through the chaos of the immediate post-Cold War era.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe successfully led 14 nations and over 50 NGOs in an unprecedented international mission to rescue 500,000 Kurdish refugees trapped in the mountainous Turkish-Iraqi border in the first Gulf War\u2019s aftermath. As CJCS Gen. Colin Powell Colin Luther PowellTrump directed Perry, State Dept. officials to talk to Giuliani on Ukraine: report Powell: 'The Republican Party has got to get a grip on itself' Lobbying World MORE\u2019s assistant, he helped secure \u201cloose nukes\u201d in the newly independent former Soviet republics. As NATO\u2019s top military officer and then as chairman himself, Shalikashvili helped unite European and U.S. stakeholders behind the Clinton administration\u2019s Partnership for Peace and NATO enlargement initiatives of the 1990s.\n\nThere were many reasons for his success. But none was because he or his family brought skills, career success, or financial resources to this country. Instead, what the 16-year old Shalikashvili did bring was a mindset that stemmed directly from his Old World experiences.\n\nFor one, the Warsaw-born Shalikashvili had a strong desire to repay America, the only nation to make him a citizen. Poland refused, because his parents weren\u2019t Polish. So did Germany, where his family fled after barely escaping the Warsaw Uprising.\n\nAnd he showed his gratitude through a dedication to spreading American ideals, which held extra meaning for him as a WWII refugee. As Powell\u2019s assistant, Shalikashvili took trips to the former Soviet Union with I. Lewis \u201cScooter\u201d Libby, the under secretary of defense for policy. Libby later recalled how Shalikashvili talked about \u201cunderstanding the perils of people who live outside the glow of democracy and\u201d \u2014most critically \u2014 \u201cwhat it means to be dedicating your life to bringing freedom to those areas.\u201d\n\nLittle wonder that historian David Halberstam praised Shalikashvili for having \u201can immigrant\u2019s special appreciation for America and a belief that this country, not just in the eyes of its own citizens, but in the eyes of much of the world, was the place the least fortunate turned to as the court of last resort.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nKey to Shalikashvili\u2019s success in securing America and its way of life was conflict prevention: \u201cHis genius was that he could always find something \u2014 an idea, a strategy, a wrinkle \u2014 to prevent destructive conflict and to bring people together and advance the mission.\u201d That\u2019s Gen. Wesley Clark, who worked under Shalikashvili, echoing common sentiment.\n\nWhere did that dogged dedication to preventing conflict come from? Again, look to his World War II childhood in Europe.\n\n\u201cSeeing people killed had been part of my growing up,\u201d he once reflected. Having lived in Warsaw, the most-bombed city of the war, and then in end-of-war Germany, Shalikashvili knew firsthand the devastation that conflict could unleash and how even an entire race could be targeted for annihilation. Forced to live underground after their Warsaw apartment was dive-bombed, his family had to pay others to carry grandmother\u2019s stretcher through sewers and cellars, one of many first-hand lessons in the selfishness of people during trying times. \u201cYou deal with it,\u201d he continued, \u201cby trying not to let it demolish you.\u201d\n\nSeeing the extremes of human behavior as a child taught Shalikashvili the value of what I call \u201cconstructive open-mindedness\u201d \u2014 neither downplaying the risks of bad things occurring nor prematurely dismissing possibilities for a better world. It\u2019s part of what made him so skilled at reducing conflict.\n\nIn 1995, Shalikashvili and National Security Advisor Anthony Lake toured Gettysburg, where three days of fighting in 1863 had produced some 45,000 casualties. Reflecting on how the recent Somali mission had been judged a disaster because eighteen soldiers died in the Black Hawk Down incident, Shalikashvili critiqued: \u201cSomething has broken down in the debate about the use of force. Eighteen people died so thousands and thousands could live. To me, that\u2019s glory.\u201d\n\nIndeed, during his career Shalikashvili was known for attacking problems by plunging into the details and convincing with facts rather than emotion. Gen. Robert W. Riscassi recalled: \u201cShalikashvili just brought logic to the table. He\u2019s relaxed, non-intrusive. His forte is knowledge.\u201d\n\nSo, should the United States adopt a merit-based immigration system? The career of America\u2019s only foreign-born chairman of the Joint Chiefs gives us strong cause to say no.\n\nAndrew Marble is author of the new book Boy on the Bridge: The Story of John Shalikashvili\u2019s American Success (University Press of Kentucky), the first-ever biography of Gen.
