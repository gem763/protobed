REUTERS/Steve Marcus/File Photo\n\nHamilton, 63, reunites with Arnold Schwarzenegger and director James Cameron for \u201cTerminator: Dark Fate,\u201d out in U.S. movie theaters on Friday.\n\n\u201cI sort of had an existential crisis at the beginning of the film when I showed up and felt like \u2018uh-oh,\u2019\u201d said Hamilton.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never felt more alone in my life than when I started and that probably wasn\u2019t a reflection to what was going on on set and around me. It was what was going on inside of me,\u201d the actress said.\n\nSet two decades after Hamilton played Sarah Connor as a muscular mother battling futuristic cyborgs to save her teenage son in 1991 film \u201cTerminator 2: Judgment Day,\u201d the new movie sees her teaming up with an enhanced human to save a Mexican factory worker from a terminator from the future.\n\nHamilton said she trained her body for a year for the role as well as \u201cgetting myself into Sarah\u2019s head, her disappointments, her sorrows, her guilt, all the deep hard stuff.\u201d\n\nThe actress, who was married to Cameron from 1997 to 1999,\n\nshrugged off the acclaim she won for her earlier work as Connor, which led the way for the portrayal of strong women on screen.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just an actress playing a part and it\u2019s an accident of timing. It\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t do good work. It was that the world was ready to receive it too. So, I try to stay very, very balanced about it and never think of myself as an icon or having a legacy,\u201d she said.\n\nSo balanced that Hamilton said she was looking forward to returning to what she called her \u201cinvisible\u201d life at home in New Orleans.\n\n\u201cWhen this movie\u2019s open, I\u2019m just going to, like, go underground, be invisible for a while,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be that person in my neighborhood. I want to be like, \u2018Let\u2019s talk about our dogs and our cats and the people around us being born.\u2019 ... I\u2019ve established a very real, authentic life for myself and I don\u2019t want that to change when I go home to it.\u201d", "description": "Linda Hamilton set a new standard for female action heroes more than 30 years ago, but her return to the \"Terminator\" movie franchise prompted more than a little soul searching.", "authors": ["Rollo Ross", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446243474&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S1IU", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
