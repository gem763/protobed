His remarks come one day after Pompeo pushed back on House Democrats' efforts to take depositions from State Department officials, accusing the lawmakers of bullying and intimidation.\n\n\"And we want to make it abundantly clear that any effort by the secretary, by the president or anyone else to interfere with the congress' ability to call before it relevant witnesses will be considered obstruction of the lawful functions of congress,\" Schiff said.\n\nObstruction charges can be used to impeach a president under the U.S. Constitution.
