The official, who was not authorized to disclose operational details and spoke on condition of anonymity, said U.S. troops on the ground are at risk of being \u201cisolated\u201d and cannot travel overland without a \u201chigh risk\u201d of armed confrontation with Turkey-backed forces.\n\nThe camp in Ein Eissa, some 35 kilometers (20 miles) south of the border, is home to some 12,000 people, including 1,000 wives and widows of Islamic State fighters and their children. The Kurdish-led administration in northern Syria said in a statement that 950 IS supporters escaped after attacking guards and storming the gates. It was not immediately possible to confirm that figure.\n\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Turkish warplanes struck villages near the camp on Sunday. It said camp residents fled as clashes broke out between Turkey-backed Syrian fighters and Kurdish forces, without providing an exact number.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS People watch from Akcakale, Sanliurfa province, southeastern Turkey, as smoke billows from fires on targets in Tel Abyad, Syria, caused by bombardment by Turkish forces, Sunday, Oct. 13, 2019.

He said a few were recaptured but that supporters inside the other section of the camp also escaped and were carrying out attacks. He described the situation as \u201cvery volatile.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. official said a \u201csmall group\u201d of American troops withdrew from a base in the town because of the threat posed by Syrian fighters allied with Turkey, but that U.S. forces were still present in larger bases nearby.\n\nThe Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces were a key U.S. ally in the war against the Islamic State group and drove the extremists from most of the territory they once held in northeastern Syria. The force swept up thousands of Islamic State fighters and their family members in the campaign, and has warned it may not be able to maintain its various detention centers as it struggles to repel the Turkish advance.\n\nNATO member Turkey views the Kurdish fighters as terrorists because of their links to the insurgency in its southeast and has vowed to carve out a \u201csafe zone\u201d along the border. It launched the operation earlier this week after President Donald Trump moved U.S. forces aside, saying he was committed to getting out of America\u2019s \u201cendless\u201d wars.\n\nThe United Nations says more than 130,000 Syrians have fled since the operation began five days ago, including many who had taken refuge from previous rounds of fighting in the country\u2019s eight-year civil war. The fighting reached the main highway that runs between Hassakeh, a major town and logistical hub, and Ein Eissa, the administrative center of the Kurdish-held areas.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this Saturday, Oct. 12, 2019 photo, Turkey-backed Syrian fighters enter Ras al-Ayn, Syria.

Turkey\u2019s official news agency said Syrian fighters allied with Ankara had captured the town, while Kurdish officials said they were still battling to hold onto it. The Anadolu news agency said Turkey-backed forces had cleared the town center of Suluk, which is located at a strategic crossroads about 10 kilometers (six miles) south of the border.\n\nTurkish troops and their Syrian allies have made steady gains since launching the operation, capturing several northern villages in fighting and bombardment that has killed and wounded dozens of people. The military said it captured the center of the sizable town of Ras al-Ayn Saturday. Turkey continued shelling around the town and sporadic clashes could be heard.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says 440 Kurdish fighters have been killed since the operation began Wednesday. The SDF says 56 of its fighters have been killed since the operation began. It was not immediately possible to reconcile the two accounts. Turkey says four of its soldiers and 16 allied Syrian fighters have been killed since the operation began.\n\nThe clashes have spilled across the border, with shells fired from Syria hitting the Turkish border towns of Akcakale and Suruc. Anadolu says one person was wounded in Suruc on Sunday. Cross-border fire has killed 18 civilians in Turkey since the operation began.\n\nHeavy outgoing shelling could be heard in Akcakale early Sunday and at least one incoming projectile hit a house, leaving a gaping hole in the exterior wall and rubble inside. It was not immediately clear if anyone was wounded. Police collected evidence as a crowd gathered outside.\n\nThe U.N. meanwhile said a pumping station in the town of Hassakeh was damaged by shelling, affecting the water supply for 400,000 people, including 82,000 residents of camps for displaced people.\n\n___\n\nEl Deeb reported from Beirut.
