Binge-watching the news is no longer the preserve of obsessives.\n\nBut for Palestinians, the deadlocked vote and its seemingly dramatic aftermath, where no party won a majority or has an obvious path to forming a governing coalition, is the equivalent of a bad show on television where you already know the ending.\n\nMohammad Shtayyeh, the Palestinian prime minister, said the difference between the two biggest party leaders, the incumbent, Benjamin Netanyahu, and the former military general Benny Gantz was as insignificant as that between Pepsi and Coke.\n\nHe said Palestinians did not hold their breath to see who would become the next Israeli prime minister because the \u201ccompetition is between two candidates who do not have any agenda to end the occupation\u201d.\n\nMore than 2.5 million Palestinians live under Israeli military control in the occupied West Bank and 2 million more live under a blockade in the Gaza Strip. To win support from Israeli ultra-nationalists and settlers, both leaders have sold the promise that Israel will take permanent control over large sections of Palestinian territory \u2013 a move for decades considered an endgame scenario for Palestinians\u2019 aspirations of statehood.\n\nGantz has long portrayed himself as a centrist and even hinted at a vague intention to come to an agreement with the Palestinians. But his broad ideology does not differ hugely from Netanyahu\u2019s: when the Israeli prime minister pledged to annex up to a third of the occupied West Bank, Gantz accused him of stealing his policy. His criticism that Netanyahu has sided with far-right politicians, mostly refers to the impact on Israel, not Palestine.\n\nIn the West Bank town of Anata, Hassan Saleh, an 80-year-old retiree leans on his walking stick as he sits on a wooden chair.

Whoever wins, he scoffs, will not suddenly lift Palestinians \u201cabove the clouds\u201d.\n\n\u201cNetanyahu \u2026 and even [Palestinian President] Abu Mazen \u2013 all of them are the same,\u201d he says.\n\nAs he speaks, his son arrives. He is not hopeful either, but disagrees: \u201cAt least Netanyahu is straightforward. He at least tells you to your face. Others don\u2019t tell you to your face and still do the same.\u201d\n\nIn Gaza, which is geographically isolated from the West Bank and ruled by the Palestinian political and militant group Hamas, the general reaction to the election also appears to have been a shrug.\n\n\u201cWhen there was a war against Gaza in 2014, it was under the Netanyahu government, and Benny Gantz was the head of the army,\u201d says Mahmoud Ayyad, a 22-year-old student. \u201cThey practised all forms of killing and destruction against the Palestinian people. I don\u2019t think there is any difference between them.\u201d\n\nNetanyahu struggles to hold on to power as Gantz claims victory Read more\n\nIsrael and Hamas have fought multiple short battles over the past two years, leading to pressure in Israel to launch some sort of decisive military blow against the group, even after three wars failed to topple it.\n\nSeeking to appease the hawks, Netanyahu and Gantz have both attempted to sell themselves as the candidate most ready for war. Gantz, whose campaign boasted of the hundreds of \u201cterrorists\u201d killed in the 2014 conflict, recently promised to bomb Gaza with \u201cdisproportionate force\u201d. Meanwhile, Netanyahu has said there is \u201cno choice but to enter a war\u201d.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care who is in charge in Israel,\u201d says Ahmad Allam, a 27-year-old construction worker from Gaza City. Palestinians, he says, should instead focus on their own situation, where the public have not chosen their leaders for well over a decade.\n\n\u201cI think we should care who is in power in Palestine,\u201d says Allam. \u201cI am jealous of [Israelis], they get to elect a leader, and choose who they want to serve them. But we cannot.\u201d\n\nEven if hope is lost, some would relish the chance to see Netanyahu\u2019s decade-long stint come to a close. The prime minister has run the most rightwing government in Israel\u2019s history, and would leave at an especially bleak time for Palestinians.\n\n\u201cI know all of them are alike,\u201d says Samira Sultan, a 37-year-old teacher in Gaza. \u201cBut a new face would make a difference in our lives.\u201d", "description": "People in the West Bank and Gaza say Netanyahu and Gantz are two sides of the same coin", "authors": ["Oliver Holmes", "Sufian Taha", "Hazem Balousha"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e33328600b443b938fef6803d8cdc3867328e27/0_133_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5acf00d923c4f11b849fc092564ce1a2", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
