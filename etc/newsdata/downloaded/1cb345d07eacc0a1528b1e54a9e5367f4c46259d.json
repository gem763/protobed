They may need to adapt their size, they may need to adapt the number of branches, it may be the number of personnel in each branch,\u201d Villeroy said.\n\n\u201cBut branch networks are much more profitable,\u201d Villeroy said, adding they can much more easily sell other products and maintain relations with clients.\n\nThe head of a big French bank told him that when they made a new product offer only online, client take-up was 3%. But when it was clearly indicated clients could call their account manager for more information, take-up jumped to 50% even if people did not necessarily always call.\n\nFrance\u2019s biggest retail banks have in recent years trimmed back their retail networks as they struggle to keep costs down in the face of fierce competition from traditional rivals on online newcomers.\n\nVilleroy said France was probably Europe\u2019s most competitive banking market, largely because it was concentrated among a few big lenders, unlike in most other European countries.\n\nHe also renewed a long-standing call for more consolidation of the sector in Europe, which he said remains far more fragmented than compared to the United States\u2019 banking market.", "description": "New online banks may be grabbing an ever larger market share, but traditional bricks-and-mortar banks are still much more profitable, France's central bank head said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436242485&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF910ZE"}
