A decision on that case is not due until February 2020.\n\nThe ACCC claimed TPG had advertised the $20 fee as a prepayment to cover unexpected costs such as overseas calls. However, if the fee was not used, the watchdog claimed TPG had failed to refund customers.\n\n\"A reasonable consumer would expect that this $20 payment would be refunded if it was not used, but in fact it is non-refundable. It is unacceptable that TPG only disclose this forfeiture in fine print,\" ACCC deputy chairman Delia Rickard said.", "description": "The competition regulator has lost its case against TPG Telecom over allegations the company was misleading customers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2879%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_200%2C$y_83/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/6f1438284d3d9644e8d0c689733d35e9691463ab", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
