He delves into the Australian landscape, a harsh and often unforgiving environment, to highlight ghost gums and old gnarly trees, and explores the history of the landscape, tracing Aboriginal rock carvings under ancient starry skies. Most of the images in this gallery were created in the New South Wales town of Hill End. In recent years, his practice has increasingly involved collaborations, with projects devised to encourage others to explore and celebrate their own creativity", "description": "Australian Peter Solness specialises in the photographic technique of light painting, not simply as a visual effect but as a way to reach more deeply to the heart of his subjects", "authors": ["David Fanner"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecf6d42da3477a95cdcbd75386e06a720bd60ef7/0_168_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a0615b0a0233991a2d977ef8f3ece777"}
