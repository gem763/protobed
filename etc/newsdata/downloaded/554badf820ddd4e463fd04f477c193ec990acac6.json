Please help by asking the Board and @GovStitt to give careful and thoughtful consideration to his petition @justice4julius.'\n\nKim Kardashian asked Oklahoma officials to consider a clemency petition for Julius Jones, right who is on death row for a murder conviction in the 1999 killing of Paul Howell. Jones, who's black, says his trial was tainted when a juror used a racist term to describe him\n\nReality star Kim tweeted Wednesday urging Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt and the state Pardon and Parole Board to consider Jones' clemency petition\n\nJulius Jones, left, was convicted of murder in the 1999 shooting of 45-year-old Paul Howell, right, but says a racist juror tainted the outcome of his 2002 trial\n\nThe mom-of-four then shared a link to a page petitioning on behalf of Jones, who was an honor student on a scholarship at the University of Oklahoma at the time of his conviction.\n\nThat details how Jones' 'co-defendant fit an eyewitness\u2019s description of the shooter, while Mr. Jones did not'.\n\nIt adds: 'In a case riddled with odious racial discrimination \u2014 including a police officer\u2019s use of a racial slur during Mr. Jones\u2019 arrest and the State\u2019s removal of all prospective black jurors except one \u2014 evidence shows that a juror used the n-word before jury deliberations at the sentencing phase.'\n\nHowell was killed in the driveway of his parents\u2019 home in Edmond, KFOR reports.\n\nKim added: 'There is an amzing (sic) documentary that @violadavis did that featured the Julius Jones\u2019 case called The Last Defense.\n\n'I believe in his innocence, let\u2019s correct his wrongful conviction @GovStitt.'\n\nKardashian tweeted Wednesday urging Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, picutred, and the state Pardon and Parole Board to consider Jones' clemency petition\n\nJones' lawyers have requested that his death sentence to be commuted to time served.\n\nHe appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court after a juror told Jones' lawyers in 2017 that another juror used a racist term to describe Jones in his 2002 trial, saying authorities should 'shoot him behind the jail.'\n\nThe court rejected that appeal.\n\nKim followed up her tweets with the addresses of Governor Kevin Stitt and Oklahoma Pardon & Parole Board, writing: 'I noticed lots of people are asking what they can do to help in the Julius Jones case. You can send letters to the Pardon & Parole Board, and the Governor.'\n\nKardashian has been championing prison reform in recent years, following her success with convincing President Trump to commute the life sentence of nonviolent drug offender Alice Marie Johnson in June 2018.\n\nIn April, the mother-of-four revealed that she wants to become a lawyer and is said to be in the midst of a four-year apprenticeship with a San Francisco law firm. She is expected to take the California Bar exam in 2022.\n\nHer support for 'Making a Murderer' convict Brendan Dassey will not affect his latest bid for clemency, the Wisconsin governor has reportedly said.\n\nDassey submitted a fresh appeal last week directly to the Democrat governor, who was elected at the start of this year.\n\nThe Keeping Up With The Kardashians star then begged Gov Tony Evers to read Dassey's handwritten letter, in a tweet to her millions of followers.\n\nAfter his latest appeal was not considered by the US Supreme Court, Dassey's legal team launched a move outside the court system by going directly to the governor.\n\nBut the chances of getting a pardon from Gov Evers appear remote because he says pardons cannot be issued to inmates still serving their sentences.\n\nNow aged 29, Dassey was convicted of the 2005 rape and murder of Teresa Halbach at the family auto salvage yard in Manitowoc County, Wisconsin, despite retracting his earlier confession.", "description": "Julius Jones, right, was convicted of murder in the 1999 shooting of Paul Howell, 45.
