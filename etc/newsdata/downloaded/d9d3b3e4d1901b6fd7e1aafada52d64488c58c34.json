With considerable fanfare, the network announces that its predominantly low-income and minority students have once again defied their demographics, earning consistently impressive scores on the state\u2019s standardized tests. Not only do they dramatically outperform children across the city, erasing the achievement gap between white and black, rich and poor, they even beat the privileged kids in suburban Scarsdale and Chappaqua.\n\nDivining the secret to Success\u2019 success has been an obsession for years in media and education circles. That is partly because its founder and leader is the former New York City Council member Eva Moskowitz, whose hardball politics and support of punitive consequences for noncompliant students and parents have stirred public backlash. In 2016, the New York Times reporter Kate Taylor posted a hidden-camera recording of a Success teacher ripping up a first grader\u2019s incorrect math work, then ordering her off the classroom rug. (The teacher was briefly suspended.)\n\nRobert Pondiscio, a former public-school teacher in the South Bronx who became an education writer, won Moskowitz\u2019s permission to embed himself for a year inside one of her more than 40 schools to discover once and for all how Success does what it does. A senior fellow at the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, Pondiscio is allied with the education reform and charter movements, but not hesitant to criticize them. In a recent interview published online, he reprised his pitch to Moskowitz: \u201cRight now, somebody in this town is offering Kate Taylor a book contract to write about Success Academy. Do you want to read her book, or do you want to read my book?\u201d\n\nPondiscio\u2019s \u201cHow the Other Half Learns: Equality, Excellence, and the Battle Over School Choice\u201d may not be the book Moskowitz wants to read after all. At Bronx 1, the elementary school he follows in the impoverished South Bronx, we meet parents who embrace stern discipline and sky-high expectations in service of pressing their children to achieve and others who find the approach harassing. We see a kindergarten teacher bring a little boy to tears by telling him he must skip a favorite activity \u2014 blocks \u2014 because he was daydreaming and his \u201cbook review doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d We later see the same teacher break down crying as she describes why she felt she had to do that. \u201cBecause why would I let him fail when other kids are surpassing it and they\u2019ll go to first grade?\u201d she asks. \u201cYou would not want me as your child\u2019s classroom teacher.\u201d", "description": "Robert Pondiscio spent a year embedded in one of the charter network\u2019s controversial, high-performing schools. \u201cHow the Other Half Learns\u201d is his account of what he learned.", "authors": ["Dale Russakoff"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/26/books/review/Russakoff1/Russakoff1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
