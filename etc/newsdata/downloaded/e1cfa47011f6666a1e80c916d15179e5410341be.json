Utilities in the state have under scrutiny from customers and public officials in recent years for their roles in several massive wildfires.\n\nThe blaze erupted around 1:30 a.m. Monday on the west side of Sepulveda Pass, where Interstate 405 passes through the Santa Monica Mountains, racing down toward neighborhoods and threatening thousands of homes. It broke near the J. Paul Getty Museum and drove many, including celebrities LeBron James and Arnold Schwarzenegger, from their homes.\n\nGarcetti said the city had cleared some brush in the area over the summer. The branch came from a tree 25 feet above the power line and 20 feet up a hill, KABC-TV reported.\n\nSTRONG WINDS INCREASE SIZE OF KINCADE FIRE\n\nMore than 650 acres have burned and thousands have evacuated their homes. A dozen have been destroyed and five were damaged. Garcetti said there were no open flames but firefighters were working to extinguish embers throughout the burned area.\n\nLos Angeles Fire Chief Ralph Terrazas said firefighters were initially overwhelmed.\n\n\u201cThey had to make some tough decisions on which houses they were able to protect. Many times, it depends upon where the ember lands,\" he said, The Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nThe blaze was 15 percent contained as of Tuesday evening, officials said.\n\nThe city's Department of Water and Power said it doesn't cut off service to customers during high winds, unlike Pacific Gas & Electric, California's largest utility, according to The Times.\n\n\u201cOur systems are completely different,\u201d Andrew Kendall, senior assistant manager of the DWP\u2019s power system, said at a board meeting earlier this month, according to the paper. \u201cWe have a 465-square-mile service territory.
