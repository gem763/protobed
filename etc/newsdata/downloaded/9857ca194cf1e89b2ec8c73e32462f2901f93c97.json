This time, Kourtney clapped back at a troll who accused her kids of ditching school and implied that she doesn\u2019t value education.\n\nIn the latest installment of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, Kourtney took viewers behind the scenes of her family\u2019s recent vacation to Finland. She also shared her travel diary and more photos on her Poosh website, which she promoted on Instagram yesterday. She included some pics of her kids in her IG post, and they were incredibly adorable but they did open the door to some unfair criticism. Someone decided to comment, \u201cDon\u2019t your kids go to school \ud83d\ude2b their education is so important more than these trips.\u201d\n\nQuick note: Reality shows are filmed months in advance to give the show enough time to make it all make sense and look pretty, so this vacation had to have happened back in the spring. And that\u2019s exactly what Kourt said when she responded to the troll, who probs just doesn\u2019t know how filming works and might have forgotten that kids get breaks. (Ugh, can all of us Olds take a sec to shed a tear and pour one out for summer vacation?)\n\nWhen one of Kourt\u2019s followers defended her and said they went during spring break, Kourtney chimed in and schooled the troll on the school system and the benefits of traveling the world. A simple \u201cExactly, it was spring break, but traveling can be educational too,\u201d ended the whole exchange.\n\nSo if you\u2019re keeping score when it comes to Kourt clapping back at trolls, it\u2019s like 781,236 to 0.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "Do not come for her!", "authors": ["Shannon Barbour"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QYPHLjQ.AmPfSwyWuKFbWA--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/harper_s_bazaar_391/a6bf5daf12bdce3b5fb0af6c879052a1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
