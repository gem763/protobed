Police accused of criminal acts. Yet Duterte\u2019s drug war is wildly popular.", "language": "en", "text": "The country\u2019s police chief resigned this month over accusations that he allowed 13 officers to resell confiscated drugs and release a crucial suspect. The chief, Oscar Albayalde, denied the allegations, which date from his time as a provincial commander in 2013. Investigators called for graft and drugs charges against him.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe controversy is a blow to the credibility of the police, inviting renewed scrutiny of the drug war. But experts said it is unlikely to derail Duterte\u2019s signature policy.\n\n\u201cThe war on drugs has been synonymous with the president. They mutually feed each other,\u201d said Francisco Ashley Acedillo, a former lawmaker. \u201cUntil one is undone, the other will not be undone.\u201d\n\nIn September, the government cited an 82 percent satisfaction rating for the drug war in a Social Weather Stations survey as it pushed back on a United Nations resolution calling for the investigation of human rights violations. Police records show over 6,000 deaths in anti-drug operations, but human rights watchdogs count more than 20,000 others killed by unknown perpetrators.\n\nAD\n\nPolling released last month put Duterte\u2019s satisfaction rating at 78 percent, slightly below previous results. The president enjoyed a higher rating of \u201cvery good to excellent\u201d among wealthier Filipinos, though his popularity among the poorest respondents has decreased.\n\nAD\n\nOn the campaign trail, Duterte diagnosed drugs as the scourge of society \u2014 claiming their use was connected with rape and murder. The narrative struck a chord with his supporters, propelling him to victory in 2016 elections. (Officials in 2015 estimated there were 1.8 million drug users in the Philippines.)\n\nDuterte was the only candidate who offered a solution to the prevalence of drugs, a longtime frustration among the urban poor, said Jennifer Oreta, an assistant professor of political science at the Ateneo de Manila University.\n\nBut the crackdown targets the poorest Filipinos while satisfying the middle class and overseas Filipinos who are a pivotal in determining election outcomes, Oreta said.\n\nFor Maria, who lost a brother and father to the drug war in 2016, the shake-up among senior police is \u201cjust right.\u201d She asked to be identified by only her first name for safety reasons.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPlainclothes police killed her father when they stormed her house past midnight in a slum north of Manila, she said. He was listed as one of the deaths in police operations. As she readied his funeral arrangements the next day, her brother\u2019s body was wheeled in, covered in packaging tape.\n\n\u201cSome people are scared to talk because [Duterte] is still sitting in power. But when he\u2019s gone, they\u2019ll come out,\u201d Maria said.\n\nSo far, Duterte has emerged little scathed even on matters where his administration has been at odds with public sentiment, notably his turn away from the United States and pivot to China.\n\nPolls show that Filipinos distrust Beijing \u2014 which asserts sovereignty over waters claimed by the Philippines \u2014 but perhaps not enough to bother rural communities who stand to benefit from Chinese infrastructure loans. When Duterte appeared to side with Beijing after a Chinese trawler sank a Filipino fishing boat, his popularity was largely unaffected.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile cozying up to China, Duterte has raised salaries for the armed forces, effectively buying the acquiescence of a group that had expressed concerns about Beijing\u2019s expansion in the South China Sea, senior military officials have said.\n\nSeveral scandals have rocked the police force during his term. In 2016, authorities revealed that a kidnapped South Korean national was killed within police headquarters, and his ashes flushed down a toilet. The killing of 17-year-old Kian Delos Santos the following year led to the only conviction of police officers in a drug-war-related killing.\n\nHowever, then-police chief Ronald Dela Rosa went on to win a seat in the Senate, having won over voters by participating in game shows and using a mascot to poke fun at himself.\n\nAD\n\nAcedillo, the former congressman, said the Philippines\u2019 institutions are often personality-driven, helping to explain the appeal of strongman-style leaders.\n\nAD\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that all Filipinos are enthused by the way Duterte has prosecuted the drug war.\n\nAmnesty International cites previous surveys showing that Filipinos fear for their families\u2019 lives and prefer due process over summary executions.\n\n\u201cWhile surveys would show that many Filipinos appear to support the anti-drug campaign as a way to tackle crime, they also show the public have serious, growing concerns,\u201d said Nicholas Bequelin, Amnesty\u2019s director for East and Southeast Asia and the Pacific. \u201cAfter scandal upon scandal, the mood seems to be shifting.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nPhil Robertson, deputy director of Human Rights Watch\u2019s Asia division, calls Duterte\u2019s continued popularity \u201ca mystery,\u201d and all the more reason for international institutions to step in to stem the carnage.\n\nThe International Criminal Court is probing killings in the Philippines, and Duterte retaliated by withdrawing the country\u2019s membership.\n\nAD\n\nBut in the absence of more-forceful external intervention, experts say the drug war\u2019s toll shows no sign of easing.\n\n\u201cThe operation has taken a life of its own,\u201d said Oreta, the political scientist. \u201cIt won\u2019t stop just because there\u2019s controversy on top.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Allegations against former top cop have renewed scrutiny of the Philippine leader\u2019s signature policy.
