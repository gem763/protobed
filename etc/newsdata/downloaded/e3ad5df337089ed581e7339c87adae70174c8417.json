The new look aims to amplify USA TODAY\u2019s promise to unearth the diverse range of perspectives present today.\n\nThe design updates reflect USA TODAY\u2019s commitment to telling stories through innovative signature experiences, complete with the brand\u2019s iconic use of color. Each subsection is labeled with bold colors to help audiences and advertisers more easily appreciate USA TODAY as more than just news, with content spanning sports, entertainment, money, tech and more.\n\nWith these changes, the USA TODAY desktop site helps to create a uniform brand experience for its more than 125 million readers across all platforms, including mobile app and mobile web. As part of the changes, USA TODAY improved site search on the site and transparent content labels, also in its mobile app and mobile web products. These changes come ahead of editorial tentpoles across sports and politics, including the Olympics and the 2020 election.\n\nAlso included in the update is a new approach for branded and sponsored content will allow advertisers to enjoy new opportunities to create unique environments with custom colors and templates, allowing for more ownership within those pages for a brand and its visual identity.\n\nAdditional new features include labels for editorial and sponsored content, a vertical photo gallery template, and streamlined access to content through easier navigation within the page headers. Also, a new virtual yellow highlighter has been added to opinion content across all platforms to indicate to the audience that is it someone\u2019s opinion instead of USA TODAY\u2019s editorial reporting.\n\n\u201cWith the new visual design and pages that load faster than we can see, we aimed to delight our loyal users while also providing more brand-safe environments with unique creative opportunities for advertisers,\u201d said Kris Barton, Chief Product Officer, Gannett | USA TODAY NETWORK. \u201cWe are committed to delivering engaging products and this initiative keeps USA TODAY at the forefront of digital media innovation.\u201d\n\nThe updated site will be rolled out to all users on USATODAY.com by the end of this month.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/pr/2019/10/28/usa-today-continues-digital-evolution-updated-website/2487194001/", "description": "Continuing on its path of digital evolution, USA TODAY announced a desktop update today with a new look and feel, optimized web pages, and page speed.", "authors": ["Usa Today Network Press Room", "Published P.M.
