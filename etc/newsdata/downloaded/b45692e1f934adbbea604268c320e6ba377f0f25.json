He sells tinctures, candies, capsules and beauty products made from Cannabidiol (CBD), the non-intoxicating chemical component in marijuana that doesn\u2019t get users high like THC. It\u2019s said to help with everything from chronic pain and anxiety to insomnia, diabetes and menstrual cramps.\n\n\u201cI never did drugs. I\u2019m a pastor, I run a Christian products business. People were like, \u2018You\u2019re selling what?\u2019\u201d Swanson, whose family owns the church supply company Swanson Christian Products, told FOX Business.\n\nHe says the idea to sell CBD came to him in a prayer meeting when people started raving about its healing power to treat back pain and insomnia. \u201cSo many people were telling me how this oil had been helping them,\u201d Swanson recalled.\n\nSo he did some research, and decided to start farming hemp last year on a plot of land his family owns. Swanson launched his own line of CBD products called Gen1:29, marketing products with the Bible verse it's named after. His goal is wholesale distribution at Christian bookstores and retailers.\n\n\u201cEvery herb and fruit bearing seed I have given you for food, Love God!\u201d one of the product label\u2019s reads.\n\n\u201cOur hope is that maybe somebody would get to read that on the product and go into a church, congregation or synagogue,\u201d Swanson said.\n\nUsing the Bible to destigmatize CBD to Christian consumers is the latest way entrepreneurs are breaking into the multi-million dollar industry. The ubiquitous ingredient can be found in everything from coffee and candy, to makeup and spa products. The stuff is advertised on cocktail menus, at hotel mini bars and in pet products. It\u2019s been marketed to a high end Barneys and fitness studios like SoulCycle have started peddling CBD products. And CVS announced in March it would start selling CBD items in more than 500 stores. So it\u2019s no surprise, marketing experts say, that Christian companies and Swanson are becoming for-profit prophets of CBD.\n\n\u201cReferring to the Bible or using scriptural verses on product packaging is a savvy marketing technique that serves to legitimize a product that may seem taboo or strange,\u201d Kira Ganga Kieffer, a doctoral candidate in religious students at Boston University who specializes in American religious history and pop culture, said.\n\nApart from the Christian-heavy marketing, the Gen 1:29 products don\u2019t appear to be significantly different than any others on the saturated CBD market. There\u2019s a 2,500 mg bottle of CBD oil selling for $180;. (To compare, a bottle in the same size from the CBDistillery costs $130). Then there\u2019s a $50 body butter containing 100 mg of CBD; and $85 sour-worm gummies containing 1,500 mg of CBD.\n\n\u201cThe packaging is also tongue-in-cheek by saying \"Love, God\" as though God sent this bottle of CBD oil straight to you as a personal gift. It seems intended to be an enticing combination of gimmick and authenticity,\u201d Kieffer noted.\n\nThere\u2019s been little scientific proof to support medical claims for alleviating chronic pain, depression, anxiety or cancer. The Food and Drug Administration has only approved one CBD-containing drug, Epidiolex, to treat people with epilepsy.\n\nAnd there\u2019s been ongoing confusion on the legality of CBD. Last year, the 2018 Farm Bill lifted a federal ban on hemp production that once classified hemp as a drug. Most states, however, haven\u2019t changed their laws to align with federal rules, so many police officers and local law enforcement are confused about what products are legal.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nSwanson has a retail storefront in Murfreesboro, where CBD made from hemp extract is legal. In 2017, Tennessee modified its industrial hemp law to allow the production of hemp with 0.3 percent THC or less (hemp growers must be licensed by the Department of Agriculture).\n\nCBD and religion\n\nSome websites are likening the old biblical practices of anointing with oil with the new age natural wellness trend of CBD. God\u2019s Greenery, a sister online publication of CannabisMd, owned by Toronto-based media company Miraculo, Inc., aims to be \u201cthe leading online resource for Christians to explore cannabidiol (CBD) and its natural benefits for healing,\u201d according to the website. Some content featuerd includes \u201cTop 10 scriptures that could give Christians a thumbs-up for CBD\u201d , which notes Bible verses like James 5:14 (New Living Translation), and Mark 6:13 (Revised Standard Version) that make mentions of oil. \"Here are 10 Bible passages that could apply to a Christ follower's use of CBD,\" Natalie Gillespie, author of the post and editor-in-chief of God's Greenery, wrote.\n\n\u201cGod\u2019s Greenery hopes to create a community of thoughtful Christ followers and seekers who want to pursue optimal health God\u2019s way,\u201d the website states.\n\nOther sites, like ChristianCannabis.com, started by a nondenominational, marijuana-loving pastor, sells religious-themed CBD balm and vape pens to devout Christians.\n\nSome churches in the South are starting to discuss CBD more openly. Texas-based pastor Jeff Mousa, of Dallas Bible Church, says the topic has come up, though there is still a stigma attached to CBD for being associated with marijuana.\n\nWhile some progressive Christian churches and companies are openly preaching about CBD, others are trying to disassociate themselves from the conversation entirely. The Christian Book Distributors, formerly called CBD, changed its name in July to ChristianBook.com after it was getting inundated with requests for cannabis products.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nSwanson says he inititally faced some backlash from the Christian community for selling it.\n\n\u201cIt was a struggle,\u201d he said.", "description": "Christian companies are breaking into the CBD business to bring a different kind of healing to those in need.", "authors": ["Jeanette Settembre"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/Christian-CBD-oil-1280.png?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
