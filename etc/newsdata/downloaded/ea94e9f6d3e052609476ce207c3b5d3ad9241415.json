It\u2019s massive.\n\n\u2018For a lot of us it was one of the first things we ever did, so people do strongly associate us with those roles.\n\n\u2018But it doesn\u2019t faze me because it\u2019s not like it has been something awful we\u2019ve been a part of and it\u2019s hanging over our heads, and we wish we could forget about it.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018It\u2019s something that is part of history, and is something really cool to have been a part of.\n\n\u2018Whether or not it makes it hard and we are type cast or whatever, it\u2019s still such a nice thing to be a part of.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGame of Thrones seasons one to eight are available to stream on NOW TV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
