We\u2019ve made it clear that this is an important issue to the city since last summer, but we have seen little to no progress.\u201d\n\nUnder consideration are citations for sidewalk riders in parts of downtown, mandatory slow zones and curfews, among other changes.\n\nCity leaders are also discussing a limit on scooter vendors, prioritizing companies who show they can curb sidewalk scootering.\n\nThere are no formal rules governing the scooters, only a \u201ctemporary operating agreement\u201d between the cities and companies that dictates how many scooters can be in the city and where they can be parked.\n\nScooter advocates have praised the mode of transportation for its ability to ease traffic and greenhouse emissions and calling it a safer, faster alternative to driving.\n\nSome have said sidewalk ridership shows a need for more bike lanes in the city, so people can safely ride on the streets.\n\n\u201cRespectfully, if you would stop prioritizing cars over other modes and build more bike infrastructure, this would be far less of an issue!\u201d Mike Christensen, executive director of the Utah Rail Passengers Association, tweeted to Salt Lake City Mayor Jackie Biskupski. \u201cI wish this much concern was being shown to automakers and other auto-related industries for the constant threat posed to people walking, biking, and riding scooters in our community.\u201d\n\nStill, many are wary of sidewalk scootering. Emergency rooms have seen a drastic spike in injuries involving electric scooters including from broken noses, facial lacerations and blunt head trauma.\n\nSeveral scooter companies currently operate within the city\u2019s boundaries. Two of those companies, Lime and Spin, told the Tribune they were working to address sidewalk ridership with in-app reminders and warning stickers on the scooters.\n\nDespite the challenges, city leaders \u201cwant the scooter program to work,\u201d Larsen told the Tribune. \u201cThey\u2019re a popular thing and they\u2019re still incredibly safe compared to a car.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Salt Lake Tribune, http://www.sltrib.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "City leaders in Salt Lake City threatened to crack down on electric scooters amid a spike in injuries and growing complaints of sidewalk riders from residents.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
