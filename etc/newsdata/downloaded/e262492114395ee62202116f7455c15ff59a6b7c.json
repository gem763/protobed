(Image: Lego/YouTube)\n\nWhen Lucasfilm wanted to reveal new characters like Zorri Bliss or Jannah from Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker, we saw their images in the pages of Vanity Fair. Today, two more new characters got their big, albeit slightly less regal, reveals as toys on a YouTube livestream.\n\nA close up of the Boolio minifigure from Lego. (Image: Lego)\n\nThose characters are aliens by the names of Boolio and Babu Frik, who\u2019ll each be appearing in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. Boolio was revealed as part of the new Lego Millennium Falcon set and Babu Frik was revealed as an accessory with the C-3PO Hasbro Black Series.\n\nDuring the livestream everyone involved was very cautious to say literally nothing about Boolio. That, coupled with being part of the Falcon set, suggests he may play a fairly important part of the story.\n\nAs for Babu Frik, he\u2019s a droid builder and apparently one of Anthony Daniels\u2019 favourite new characters. That makes sense, considering he comes with C-3PO, but does he build new droid D-O? Rebuild 3PO? We don\u2019t know. Here are a few screenshots from the video.\n\nBabu Frik and C-3PO, who has a bowcaster and bandolier. (Image: YouTube)\n\nA Babu Frik close-up. (Image: YouTube)\n\nAs you can see, Babu is very small and has a visor that can lift up revealing his face.\n\nWe wish we could give you any more information on these characters \u2014 but alas, we are in the dark. And yet, anytime we learn the name or look of a new Star Wars character it\u2019s cool because from now on, they\u2019re part of history.\n\nYou\u2019ll be able to purchase the toys and many other items come \u201cTriple Force Friday\u201d on October 5. And you\u2019ll see these characters in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker on December 18.", "description": "When Lucasfilm wanted to reveal new characters like Zorri Bliss or Jannah from Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker, we saw their images in the pages of Vanity Fair.
