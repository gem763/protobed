Kids dance Kizomba, young people dance it too, we all communicate through it.\n\n\"You can almost see the soul of the person you are dancing with in it. It's our culture. It's us!\n\n\"In Kizomba, we understand the world through touch. It's like when babies touch things to understand them; in the same way, we communicate through touch.\n\n\"For people from other countries, at first sight it might look like a sexual thing. But it's not. When you dance Kizomba you can understand the joy that we have.\n\nA mix of styles - and a link with history\n\nKizomba is a mixture of many musical styles. Angola's close ties with Brazil and Cape Verde date back to colonial times, when Angola was the hub of the slave trade.\n\nIn both Angola and Cape Verde, local African dances and music styles mixed with the Zouk. In fact, the Caribbean Zouk, the Haitian Kompa and the Semba are all components of what we now know as Kimzomba.\n\nThe pleasure it brings to people is clear when they dance.\n\nAs Dinamene adds:\n\n\" You can see all the people dancing with smiles on their faces!\u201c", "description": "Kizomba is a style of dance which has become really important in Angolan culture in recent decades.\n\nThe word \"Kizomba\" means \"celebration\" or \"party\" in Kimbundu, a Bantu language. \n\nThe dance style developed in Angola in the 1980s and 1990s in the region around the capital Luanda, first as a music", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/82/94/42/1000x563_cmsv2_e305e957-a087-5e0e-bfab-2c4bf33e0871-3829442.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-29"}
