Y\u2019all! Princess Twilight Sparkle is coming to M:tG!\n\nAhem. The three-card, silver-bordered set will be featured along side a My Little Pony-themed play mat and four special card sleeves. It\u2019s only available from 22 October through 5 November \u2013 while supplies last \u2013 on Hasbro\u2018s Pulse website.\n\nThe cards (obviously not tournament legal) pay homage to the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic series, whose upcoming finale will mark the end of an era in Pony canon. Seriously, don\u2019t sleep on My Little Pony, it\u2019s the Robotech of friendship.\n\nThe three cards feature the aforementioned Princess Twilight Sparkle (how is this not a Planeswalker card?), a double-sided card featuring Nightmare Moon and her Princess Luna alter-ego, and Rarity.\n\nIf you look at Princess Twilight Sparkle\u2019s action text you\u2019ll notice mention of Applejack, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, and possibly Fluttershy. IGN tried to pin down Wizards to see if that meant the company planned on releasing a full Pony set at some point\u2026 but the company stayed mum on the subject. Here\u2019s hoping a full set pans out.\n\nI\u2019m not sure there\u2019s anything cuter than \u201cPonies: the Galloping,\u201d as Hasbro\u2018s calling the crossover, but the best part about the whole event is that all the proceeds go to charity.\n\nWhile $50 might seem like a bit much for a trio of M:tG cards, some sleeves, and a play mat, 100 percent of the net profits go to Extra Life, a charity that supports the Children\u2019s Miracle Network Hospital.\n\nIf three ponies aren\u2019t enough to sate your desire to destroy enemy Planeswalkers with the magic of friendship, check out this mind-boggling github repository featuring more than 11,000 fan-made My Little Pony cards for Magic: the Gathering. You\u2019re welcome.\n\nRead next: Game publishers exploit \u2018culturally British\u2019 loophole, dodge millions in UK taxes", "description": "", "authors": ["Tristan Greene"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2Fponies.jpg&signature=9694b3e27a0b7d0ebc611c75db1ed579", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
