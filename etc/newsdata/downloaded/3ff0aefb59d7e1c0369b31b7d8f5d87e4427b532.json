The prime minister looks set to lose his bid for a snap poll on Dec. 12, after opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn reiterated he\u2019ll only support it if the risk of a no-deal Brexit is removed.

Here\u2019s How It Works: QuickTake\n\nLib Dems Seek Cross-Party Support for Poll (10 a.m.)\n\nJo Swinson, leader of the pro-EU Liberal Democrats, urged other parties to back her proposal for a general election on Dec. 9 (see 8:30 a.m.)\n\nShe told the BBC on Sunday that \u201ctime pressure\u201d meant she was not seeking to use the proposed bill -- which is also backed by the Scottish National Party -- to secure amendments such as lowering the voting age from 18. \u201cI think we have to pass this as it is drafted,\u201d she said. \u201cWe cannot assume we will keep getting an extension to Article 50. We do need to resolve this issue.\u201d\n\nBut Conservative Party Chairman James Cleverly told the BBC the plan was \u201cclearly a gimmick\u201d and the Tories would not support something put forward by two parties who want to see Brexit stopped.\n\nLabour Digs in Over Early Election (9:30 a.m.)\n\nLabour made it clear it won\u2019t support Johnson\u2019s bid for an early general election when the proposal is put to the House of Commons. A no-deal Brexit must be off the table before the party will consider a snap poll, senior officials said.\n\nBut speaking on Sky News, Labour\u2019s health spokesman Jon Ashworth declined to say whether the party would back an early poll if the EU -- as is widely expected -- announces a Brexit extension until the end of January. Likewise Diane Abbott, Labour\u2019s shadow home secretary, told the BBC the party will wait to see the terms of delay before deciding.\n\n\u201cIt is reasonable for Parliament to wait until the EU decision,\u201d Abbott said.\n\nBoth Ashworth and Abbott also said Labour is unlikely to back the proposal for the Liberal Democrats and Scottish National Party for an early election on Dec. 9, secured by a simple majority in Parliament (see 8:30 a.m.).\n\n\u201cThe Lib Dem\u2019s plan is an opportunistic stunt,\u201d Ashworth said. \u201cIt would need cross-party support and is subject to amendments.\u201d That\u2019s the same reason the government is unlikely to get behind it.\n\nMorgan: Government Will Keep Seeking Early Poll (8:45 a.m.)\n\nCulture Secretary Nicky Morgan said the government will keep seeking an early general election if it loses Monday\u2019s vote in the Commons, pointing out that the government\u2019s motion is to both get the Brexit legislation through and secure a snap poll on Dec. 12.\n\nIn an interview with Sky News, Morgan said the government still wants to leave the EU on Oct. 31, but with the bloc expected to announce an extension by Tuesday, the government had been forced to find an alternative way to get Brexit done. The U.K. needs the uncertainty to end, she said.\n\nMorgan also indicated the government would not adopt the proposal from the Liberal Democrats and Scottish National Party (see 8:30 a.m.) to pass a bill to hold a general election on Dec. 9. Unlike Johnson\u2019s motion, which requires a two-thirds majority to pass, the Lib Dem/SNP plan needs only a simple majority.\n\nBut Morgan made clear the risk for the government is that such a bill could be amended, potentially taking the first part of what Johnson wants to get done -- getting his Brexit legislation ratified -- off the table ahead of an election.\n\nSNP, Lib Dems Seek Early Poll as Opposition Splits (8:30 a.m.)\n\nThe Scottish National Party said it is working with the Liberal Democrats to secure an early general election, and that they had sent a letter to European Council President Donald Tusk to seek a \u201cmeaningful\u201d extension to at least the end of January to ensure the risk of a no-deal Brexit is removed.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Sign up to our\u00a0Brexit\u00a0Bulletin, follow us @Brexit\u00a0and\u00a0subscribe to our podcast.Boris Johnson accused members of Parliament of holding the U.K. \u201chostage\u201d ahead of a vote Monday on an early general election.
