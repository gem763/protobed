REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nKupperman was expected to provide testimony about Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine brought to Congress\u2019 attention by a report from a whistleblower about a July 25 telephone call between the U.S. president and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\n\nTrump\u2019s request to Zelenskiy that he investigate former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, a leading candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, and his son Hunter Biden, who had served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company, is the focus of the inquiry being conducted by the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees.\n\nTrump made his request after withholding $391 million in security aid approved by the U.S. Congress to help fight Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.\n\nTrump again dismissed the inquiry in comments to reporters.\n\n\u201cI had a great conversation with the Ukrainian president. I had another with him also, I think before that, which was the same thing, it was nothing. They tried to take that conversation and make it into a big scandal,\u201d Trump said on Monday.\n\nThe committees have interviewed a series of witnesses, including current and former diplomats and administration officials, for interviews behind closed doors that often last for eight to 10 hours.\n\nAfter the Trump administration said it would not comply with the probe, the committees started issuing subpoenas to both compel testimony and provide protection against possible retribution.\n\nSchiff noted that a federal judge has validated the legality of the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry in a separate decision about releasing information regarding a separate investigation, into Russian election interference in 2016, to Congress and that all witnesses need to come forward when called.\n\nThe Trump administration appealed that ruling on Monday.\n\nSlideshow (10 Images)\n\nSchiff said he did not expect Kupperman\u2019s failure to appear to stall the probe.\n\n\u201cWe are not willing to allow the White House to engage us in a lengthy game of \u2018rope-a-dope\u2019 in the courts. So we press forward,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cWe will not allow the White House to delay our investigation.\u201d\n\nUnderscoring the partisanship around the investigation, Republicans defended Kupperman\u2019s failure to appear.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an investigation. I think the real key here is, this is not an investigation. These are a few depositions designed to get an outcome that was predetermined,\u201d Republican Representative Mark Meadows told reporters.", "description": "Democrats in Congress, answering Republican complaints that their impeachment investigation of U.S. President Donald Trump is being conducted in secret, plan a vote on Thursday on a format for going public with their inquiry, marking a significant new stage in the probe.", "authors": ["Patricia Zengerle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445931227&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R1GH", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
