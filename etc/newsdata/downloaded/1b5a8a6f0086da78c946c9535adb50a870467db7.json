In 2010, fossil fuels accounted for more than 10 times the amount of electricity than renewables, according to the analysis. Today electricity generation from fossil fuels has halved, according to the report, with electricity derived from coal, oil and gas down from 288 terawatt hours to 142 terawatt hours in the most recent 12-month period.\n\nThe report attributed the shift to shrinking demand due to efficient electric grids and the growth of renewable capacity paired with falling energy costs.\n\nThe trend is the first sign that the country, which has recently vowed to adopt net zero gas emissions by 2050, is heading in the right direction.", "description": "Electricity generated from wind, solar and\u00a0hydroelectric plants beat out traditional fossil fuel plants as the top source of power for the United Kingdom during a three-month period for the first time, accordin", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/getty-2008-windmills_turbines.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
