All defendants were acquitted of the most severe charge \u2014 rebellion.\n\nThe charges all relate to the independence referendum held in Catalonia on October 1, 2017. The vote was declared illegal by the Spanish government, which moved immediately to punish those involved.\n\nThe former head of Catalonia's regional government Carles Puigdemont classified the prison sentences as an \"atrocity\".\n\n\"It is time to react ... for the future of our sons and daughters. For democracy. For Europe. For Catalonia,\" he said on Twitter.\n\nPuigdemont was not part of the trial because he fled to Belgium where he lives in self-imposed exile.\n\nThe former deputy leader of Catalonia and head of the pro-independence Esquerra Republicana party Oriol Junqueras received the harshest sentence: 13 years for sedition and misuse of public funds.\n\nThe court convinced Junqueras and eight other leaders on charges of sedition and four of them of misuse of public funds, the court ruling showed.\n\nIn a letter published on his party's Facebook page, the independentist leader said the movement \"would return stronger and to win.\"\n\nThe jailed Catalan leader also told Euronews in an interview earlier this year that he would never give up for self-determination for the Catalan region of Spain.\n\nREAD MORE: Catalan separatists await verdict after historic trial comes to an end\n\nThe high-profile trial started in February and saw more than 300 witnesses testify. When it ended in mid-June, Ignacio Gonz\u00e1lez Vega, the spokesman for the professional association for Spanish Judges for Democracy, said that \"the nuclear question is whether or not there has been violence that integrates the crime of rebellion\".\n\nHe believes that \u201caccusations are still based on the fact that (the declaration of independence on October 1) was a planned plot spread out through time with episodes of violence while the defence still argues that the declaration of independence was made without any violence.\u201d\n\nSome Catalan separatists have, however, accused the country's courts of being heavily influenced by politicians.\n\nIf the Supreme Court rules against them, the defendants will be able to appeal to the Constitutional Court and then the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.\n\nWhat might happen now is largely unknown. Separatist protests have been largely peaceful but police told Reuters authorities are prepared for any outbursts of violence.\n\nAfter the ruling, the CDR grassroots movement tweeted: \"It's time to rise up against the authoritarian fascism of the Spanish state and its accomplices. It is time for the #RevoltaPopular (popular revolt).\"\n\nOn Saturday, around 10,000 people marched in Madrid on the country's National Day to protest Catalan independence.\n\nREAD MORE: Catalan Separatists' trial: How they got here and what's next?", "description": "The 12 defendants \u2014 including former Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont currently in self-imposed exile \u2014 face up to 25 years in jail.", "authors": ["Cristina Abellan Matamoros"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/22/90/30/1000x563_cmsv2_284f1e21-c8a0-553f-ad83-59d5ee05fdc7-4229030.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
