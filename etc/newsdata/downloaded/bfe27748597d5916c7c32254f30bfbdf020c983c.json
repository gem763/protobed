After the group gave Trump an award for helping pass and signing into law the First Step Act, the president left without taking questions from students, many of whom weren\u2019t even allowed into the venue to see him speak.\n\n\u201cBenedict College has taken full operational control of the previously scheduled candidate forum on Saturday & Sunday and will be hosting the Inaugural Collegiate Bipartisan Presidential Forum at Benedict College, a discussion with the Democratic presidential candidates-IN THE LITTLE THEATER at the Fine Arts Center,\u201d Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin, a co-sponsor of the event, told campaigns in a text early Saturday morning. \u201cThe theme is \u2018Students First\u2019 and there will be significant student participation and attendance.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with POLITICO later Saturday morning, Benjamin said he spent several hours working the phones with campaigns and Benedict College President Roslyn Clark Artis to smooth things over.\n\n\u201cI called all the campaigns. I wanted them to know if there was any concern about participating in this event, then I\u2019d also have an alternative set up available to them, but we needed them to come to [Benedict College],\u201d he said. \u201cThese students needed to see and have their chance to ask questions of the next president of the United States.\u201d\n\nBenjamin will now moderate sessions with the Democratic candidates. The 20/20 group will only sponsor two of its previously scheduled panels on criminal justice reform.\n\nThe difference with the Benedict-led event, Benjamin told campaigns, is that the candidates can choose whether to stick with the questions the campaigns have reviewed and a subsequent Q&A, or deliver remarks on their vision for the next steps for criminal justice reform and then participate in a Q&A.\n\n\u201cThe event will honor all previous ticketed commitments & ensure significant student participation and attendance,\u201d he added.\n\nTickets to attend the sessions were originally $40. Before purchases were cut off, tickets for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren sold out. Students are now able to attend at no cost.\n\nTrump on Saturday assailed Harris for canceling her scheduled appearance.\n\n\"Badly failing presidential candidate @KamalaHarris will not go to a very wonderful largely African American event today because yesterday I recieved [sic] a major award, at the same event, for being able to produce & sign into law major Criminal Justice Reform legislation, which will greatly help the African American community (and all other communities), and which was unable to get done in past administrations despite a tremendous desire for it,\" Trump wrote on Twitter.\n\nHarris was given the same award in 2016.\n\n\u201cMy whole life I\u2019ve fought for justice and for the people \u2014 something you\u2019d know nothing about. The only part of criminal justice you can claim credit for is the 'criminal' part,\u201d Harris responded to Trump on Twitter.\n\nNew Jersey Sen. Cory Booker also sought to capitalize on Harris\u2019 initial cancellation, tweeting late Friday that \u201cI, for one, will be there tomorrow.\u201d Booker, who played a significant role in the criminal justice law\u2019s passage, told reporters Saturday that Harris is like a sister to him, but \u201cit was very important for me to be here.\u201d\n\nBoth candidates are jockeying for position in South Carolina, a state central to their paths to winning the Democratic nomination. A recent Monmouth poll of the state, however, has Harris in fourth place at 6 percent with likely Democratic voters \u2014 down from 12 percent in July \u2014 while Booker remains at 2 percent.\n\nIn Trump\u2019s Friday address at Benedict College, he suggested that his experience with investigations throughout his presidency made him more aware of those being treated unfairly by the criminal justice system. He used much of the address to defend his signature criminal justice reform law passed in December 2018.\n\nTrump has drawn widespread condemnation for his incendiary language on racially sensitive issues, including earlier this week when he used the word \"lynching\" to describe the ongoing House impeachment investigations against him.\n\nHarris blasted the president for using the word, saying that \"invoking that torture to whitewash your own corruption is disgraceful.\"\n\nAccording to a recent AP-NORC poll, just 4 percent of African Americans said they think Trump\u2019s actions have been good for them in general.\n\nChristopher Cadelago and Daniel Lippman contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/76/0e/a0ce97444139a5289927e850db45/191026-harris-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
