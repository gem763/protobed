The affair had caused \"severe reputational damage,\" it added.\n\nBou\u00e9e admittedduring an investigation by law firm Homburger that he had asked Credit Suisse's security chief to place Iqbal Khan, head of wealth management, under observation in late August after rival bankannounced hewould be joining them. The surveillance was conducted by a licensed observation firm retained through an intermediary.\n\nBou\u00e9e had ordered the surveillance on Khan \"in order to protect the interests of the bank\" and had not informed CEO Tidjane Thiam or any other member of the bank's senior leadership, Credit Suisse said in a statement\n\nThe executive reportedly feared that Khan would try to encourage Credit Suisse colleagues to join him at UBS. Bou\u00e9e was concerned that Khan posed a risk to the interests of Credit Suisse and the fact that he continued to socialize with \"key employees\" added to his concerns, Credit Suisse said.\n\nStill, neither Homburger nor the surveillance operation found any evidence that Khan had breached his contractual obligations by trying to poach employees or clients away from Credit Suisse.\n\nKhan was observed on seven business days between September 4 and September 17.\n\nCredit Suisse commissioned its investigation after prosecutors in Zurich opened a case concerning potential coercion or threats following a complaint made by Khan, who reportedly confronted one of the people tailing him.\n\nThe incident on September 17 between Khan and \"a member of the external observation team\" was not part of the investigation as it is the subject of an ongoing criminal investigation, the bank said.\n\nThe investigation also \"did not identify any indication that the CEO had approved the observation of Iqbal Khan nor that he was aware of it prior to [September 18] after the observation had been aborted,\" it added.\n\nCredit Suisse's head of global security has also resigned with immediate effect.\n\nBou\u00e9e will be replaced by James Walker, a senior executive at Credit Suisse's finance division.
