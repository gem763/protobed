More\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nLong-term debt was down to $90 billion in June, and Culp has set plans to reduce it by about $30 billion more. These plans include the sale of GE Healthcare\u2019s biopharma unit to Danaher (NYSE:DHR) and a slow exit from Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHGE).\n\nBut some of the biggest overhangs from the Immelt era, like GE Power, remain. So does one from the era of Jack Welch \u2014 the reinsurance of long-term care policies highlighted by whistleblower Harry Markopolos.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhere\u2019s the Beef?\n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that the asset sales leave GE with few avenues to growth \u2014 and these growth avenues are why investors buy stocks.\n\nGE reported a small loss of 1 cent per share for the June quarter. Its $28.8 billion of revenue was down over $1 billion from the previous June. Losing the biopharma unit and, eventually, taking Baker Hughes\u2019 revenue off the balance sheet, will reduce revenue further.\n\nCulp seems to be two-thirds of the way to a turnaround. He has stopped the bleeding and created a new, more transparent corporate culture. Growth is the next step.\n\nIn December 2018, GE filed to spinoff its most promising growth avenue, GE Healthcare, through a mid-2019 IPO. But Culp hasn\u2019t talked about it in months. In February, Culp told CNBC that a 2019 IPO looks \u201cunlikely.\u201d Many investors are waiting for an update.\n\nGE Healthcare accounts for one-sixth of the company\u2019s sales and nearly half its profit during good times. It seems to be the perfect platform on which Culp could work the magic he worked at Danaher. There he bought smaller healthcare companies, built their value and sold judiciously.\n\nGE Aviation, the other big profit driver, faces a $400 million per quarter hit to cash flow from the Boeing 737-MAX scandal. But the unit continues to perform, generating military contracts even as foreign nationals get hauled into court for stealing GE\u2019s trade secrets.\n\nAnalysts are Pounding the Table for GE Stock\n\nDespite a lack of growth catalysts, analysts keep pounding the table for GE stock. A Citi analyst has a \u201cbuy\u201d rating on the stock. Others have dismissed Markopolos\u2019 charges, which I detailed in July, as overwrought.\n\nThe argument is that with less debt and business prospects improving, the company is trading at barely two-thirds its sales.\n\nAny kind of profit would thus be a catalyst for the shares, initially as a defensive play but later, based on Culp\u2019s acquisition wizardry. This is especially true if, as some analysts now believe, it has enough reserves to handle the long-term care losses.\n\nThe Bottom Line on General Electric Stock\n\nIt\u2019s hard for me to buy the optimism yet, but there\u2019s an argument to be made.\n\nI think analysts still underestimate the damage Welch\u2019s long-term care time bomb could do. Given the high cost of nursing care, and the average age of those insured, this will remain a problem for years to come.\n\nBut by the end of this year Culp may have cut GE\u2019s debt nearly in half through asset sales. If GE Power really is on a \u201cpositive trajectory,\u201d as one analyst recently claimed, it would take care of the last big downside risk.\n\nThe question then becomes how Culp can create growth. The June quarter showed GE with over $71 billion in cash and short-term investments on its books. Some of that is committed to the remains of GE Capital, which Immelt used as a cash cow to build his power and energy conglomerate.\n\nBut there may be enough there for Culp to shop for a healthcare acquisition. If he makes one, the stock will rise.\n\nDana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.
