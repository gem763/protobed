As a protege of Bolton, Kupperman is unlikely to last very long in the job; Trump said he would name a new adviser next week.\n\nThe position does not require Senate confirmation so Trump can pick whoever he likes, but it was unclear on Tuesday who the White House considers to be among the potential candidates.\n\nAs for Bolton, his \"priorities and policies just don't line up with the president,\" Gridley said. \"There is no one issue here ... they just didn't align on many issues.\"\n\nThe summit that never was\n\nThe dismissal followed a head-spinning turn of events that began over the weekend with an announcement on Twitter by Trump that he had invited delegations from Afghanistan, including the Taliban, to Camp David for peace talks \u2014 but then canceled the meeting before it could take place.\n\nTrump then told reporters at the White House on Monday that he considered the peace negotiations to be \"dead.\"\n\nThe president appeared to have taken on the Afghanistan portfolio himself and cut some of his advisers \u2014 including Bolton \u2014 out of the matter.\n\nTensions reached a point at which Bolton reportedly was excluded from meetings about the war in Afghanistan, an issue that might otherwise have obviously fallen into the purview of the national security adviser.\n\nBut Trump had become a dove and wanted to reach a peace agreement that would permit the withdrawal of most or all American forces from Afghanistan.\n\nThe president's allies felt they couldn't trust Bolton not to blow up the process, in the way Bolton also may have complicated earlier talks by pushing for a tougher stance with North Korea.\n\nAt one point, special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad would not agree to let Bolton take a draft copy of the Afghanistan agreement out of the conference room where they were meeting, The Washington Post reported.\n\n\"I knew there were some concerns about the whole Taliban meeting but I didn't know for sure,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told reporters on Tuesday.\n\nGraham, a sometime ally of the president but who has been skeptical of the Afghanistan talks, said he thought Trump should have the adviser he wants in the job.\n\nThese kinds of differences between Trump and Bolton eventually spun the two men too far apart.\n\n\"The president been signaling his displeasure with him for a while,\" said Fernando Cutz, who served as senior director at the National Security Council in the Trump administration until last year.\n\n\"We saw a lot of the telltale signs that the president uses when he doesn't like somebody being used on Bolton for a while now \u2014 isolating him from meetings, sending him to Mongolia when he went to North Korea [and] sending him to Warsaw when he wanted to make a key decision on the Taliban.\"\n\nHawk\n\nBolton's aggressive positions on Venezuela, North Korea and Afghanistan clashed with the comparative reluctance of his boss to entertain new confrontations and his enthusiasm about winding down some old ones.\n\nTrump promised to cut bait on the long-running war in Afghanistan, faulted the U.S. invasion of Iraq and rattled the foundations of America's security posture around the world, including its forward deployment of forces and system of alliances in Europe and Asia.\n\nBolton, meanwhile, communicated in old-school terms to leaders in Caracas, Pyongyang and Tehran with threats about the prospect of direct action by the U.S. military.\n\nIn one episode, he displayed a legal pad that mused about sending the equivalent of an Army brigade to Venezuela's neighbor, Colombia.\n\nDuring a chill in relations with Iran, Bolton couched the long-planned deployment of an aircraft carrier, the USS Abraham Lincoln, as a quick response to ostensible threats by Iranian forces to American troops in the Middle East.\n\nU.S. commanders also sent other units, including B-52 bombers, in what they called a move to try to deter an Iranian attack.\n\nAnd Bolton also was said to have been a crucial force in torpedoing an agreement between Trump and North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, seeking broad concessions from Kim about his weapons of mass destruction.\n\nAngry North Korean officials later called Bolton \"dim-sighted.\"\n\nThe sum of positions like these and others was a national security adviser with a view about American strategic ways, means and goals that wound up at stark odds with that of the president.\n\n\"In all three\" \u2014 North Korea, Iran and Venezuela \u2014 \"Bolton wanted a war and the president didn't,\" Cutz said.\n\nProlonged estrangement\n\nTrump administration officials have been quoted for some time in press reports describing the unease with which the president began to see Bolton's moves.\n\nTrump appeared to have been focused elsewhere, including on trade negotiations with China, and then become dismayed when he checked back in with the issues in Bolton's portfolio.\n\nTrump, who has mocked what he has called the wasted sacrifice and money involved with America's wars in the Middle East \u2014 especially since the United States hadn't taken any oil for itself or some other economic recompense \u2014 was not pleased to see news coverage about Bolton bringing the United States to the brink of a crisis with Iran.\n\nTrump eventually admitted that, for as much as he said he liked Bolton, he was aware of his own need to rein him in.\n\n\"He has strong views on things but that's OK. I actually temper John, which is pretty amazing,\" Trump said on May 9. \"I'm the one that tempers him. That's OK. I have different sides. I have John Bolton and other people that are a little more dovish than him. I like John.\"\n\nThe mustache and the line\n\nBolton followed Army Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster \u2014 a widely respected but straight-laced strategist who never clicked with Trump personally \u2014 and retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn, who was forced out of the administration early as part of the Russia imbroglio.\n\nBolton already was a well-known conservative apostle of intervention and regime change who had earlier served as ambassador to the United Nations in the administration of President George W. Bush.\n\nHe went on to became a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and served as a commentator in the press and on Fox News when McMaster's departure created the opening for him in early 2018.\n\nTrump liked Bolton's TV appearances and sought his counsel unofficially before bringing him formally into the administration. Bolton reportedly was instrumental in shaping Trump's tough Iran policy even before he reentered the government.\n\nHe might have been recruited even sooner, but the president's hand was reportedly stayed for some time, in part because of Bolton's mustache.\n\nOnce Trump overcame his objections, the new national security adviser seized his new position at the top of the official national security decision-making apparatus, shaping the staff with his own appointees and leaning into shaping policy.\n\nGaps opened almost immediately between Bolton and Trump based on the president's freewheeling style that included making policy via Twitter or in impromptu remarks.\n\nBy the summer, Trump was saying that \"we'll have to see\" whether Washington would recognize the borders of Ukraine since Russia's invasion in Crimea and the eastern border.\n\nBolton was then asked whether the administration actually would concede the claims made by Russia based on its use of force.\n\nThe national security adviser, no fan of Moscow, sought to draw a distinction between Trump's musings and what might be produced by the National Security Council or the Defense Department.\n\n\"That's not the position of the United States,\" Bolton said.\n\nNPR correspondents Susan Davis and Franco Ordo\u00f1ez contributed to this report.", "description": "The national security adviser caught the president's attention for his aggressive stance as a Fox News commentator but strayed from favor after pushing too hard against Trump's wishes.", "authors": ["Philip Ewing"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/05/17/ap_19121457462116_wide-f9c1663047a576eeb0d6bdbfc6e3534557bf43a1.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
