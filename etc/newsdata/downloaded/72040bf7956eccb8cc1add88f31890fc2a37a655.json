Start easy \u2013 start with something you already enjoy\n\n\u201cWhat are the things that you really enjoy doing?\u201d asks Michael Rosen. \u201cLet\u2019s say it\u2019s cooking, then if you then ask yourself, well what if I was just a bit more playful with it? So you follow a recipe, and then you just say, well what would happen if I just played around with some of these ingredients? You\u2019re playful with it. The advantage of cooking is that it has an outcome for both you and the people around you, so you can say, \u2018well, did you like it? No?\u2019 Well you won\u2019t do it again. Then you can try something else.\u201d\n\n2. Move onto the more mundane things you have to do\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say you walk every day and it\u2019s a little bit boring. Well, what happens if you\u2019re a bit more playful with it? Where did my parents walk, and how did they walk? What if I imitated that? So you think about walking as a sort of memory thing. Or what about if you thought about looking at the way other people walk, and then quietly at some point, imitated their walks? You play with walking.\u201d\n\n3. Use play to tap into your imagination or fantasy life\n\n\u201c[Take] the thing you always wished you'd done and play with that. If I\u2019m in a cab and a cabbie says, \u2018Oh you\u2019re a writer? I wish I\u2019d done that\u2019, then I say, \u2018Well have you got children? Do you tell them stories?\u2019, \u2018Oh yeah\u2019. So I say, 'well what stories do you tell them?\u2019, \u2018Oh well I\u2019ve made this thing up about this cabbie\u2019. And I go, \u2018That\u2019s wonderful!\u2019. They are playing with the idea of cabbiness. If they\u2019ve created a dog cabbie, well that\u2019s just magic!\u201d\n\n4. Try writing a tongue twister\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good fun to make up tongue twisters because all you\u2019ve got to do is find two sounds that are a bit like each other. Like \u2018s\u2019 and \u2018sh\u2019 and then you think of all the s and sh words you know and then you see if you can repeat it.\u201d\n\n5. Or get a pen and paper and doodle with a friend\n\n\u201cDoodling is a lovely thing to do. Do your doodle and then colour in your doodles and then swap round. Do your doodle, pass it to someone else then pass it to someone else.\u201d\n\nWoman's Hour is on BBC Radio 4 on weekdays at 10am and at 4pm on Saturdays.
