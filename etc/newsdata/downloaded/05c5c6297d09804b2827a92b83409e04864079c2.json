Since I did that my Universal Credit has been stopped. This is my fourth month without any Universal Credit coming in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I have paid my rent and I stocked up well with food but now the money is running out. I do not understand what the hold up is.\n\nHe was left without benefits for four months (Picture: Gloucestershire Live /SWNS.COM)\n\n\u2018Surely there should be something in place where those that have terminal illness have applications fast tracked.\u2019\n\nMr Smith, who previously worked as a mechanic and on the docks, added that he had attempted to call the DWP, but was kept on hold for 45 minutes.\n\nHe continued: \u2018To be honest I am stressed to the max. I am running out of money. It is not fair.

I hoped whatever was left in the bank the family could use to bury me.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018I feel my body drifting away from me. I am not in a hurry to go but I feel myself slowing. I want to get this claim sorted so I know where I stand.\u2019\n\nA spokesperson for the DWP confirmed they have now approved Mr Smith\u2019s UC payments and said he is not expected to look for work.\n\nThey added: \u2018We apologise for any distress caused during this difficult time and we continue to work with him to ensure he is getting all the support he\u2019s entitled to.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
