Marijuana advocates are divided among themselves over whether to push for full legalization or settle for less far-reaching legislation. And many Republicans \u2014 some of whom are seeing the benefits of cannabis legalization in their home states \u2014 are still decidedly against any legalization on the national level, even for medicinal uses.\n\nAt the same time that Congress is in gridlock, there is growing national support for cannabis, which is illegal at the federal level but at least partially legal in 33 states. In addition, public opinion is shifting rapidly, with nearly two-thirds of Americans supporting legalization according to Gallup \u2014 double the level of support two decades ago. That\u2019s led to a steadily growing number of lawmakers on both sides of the aisle who represent states with legal cannabis markets, making them more sympathetic toward legislation aimed at helping the burgeoning industry \u2014 which brought in roughly $10 billion in sales last year.\n\nThese conflicts between state and federal law have created a rash of problems for cannabis companies, including lack of access to banking services, sky-high federal tax rates and bewildering questions about exactly what business practices are legal.", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com Story"], "top_image": ""}
