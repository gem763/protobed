You can see it occur at 3:13 in the this video. If you look closely, you can see they have been wired with antitank missiles on racks slung on the sides.\n\nIn fact, this was the first confirmation that Pyongyang has maintained the fleet of 87 U.S.-built helicopters it smuggled into the country more than a quarter century ago.\n\nThe MD 500 is a civilian version of the distinctive Army OH-6 Cayuse light observation helicopter, which entered U.S. military service back in the 1960s. The no-frills design has been nicknamed the \u201cFlying Egg\u201d due to its compact, ovoid fuselage. It was widely employed to evacuate casualties, escort friendly transport helicopters, scout for enemy forces up close, and provide light fire support to troops on the ground with miniguns and rocket pods. Exceptionally cheap\u2014selling for $20,000 each in 1962!\u2014they were agile and small enough to land in places other helicopters couldn\u2019t.\n\nHowever, they were also highly exposed to enemy fire: 842 of the initial 1,400 OH-6As were lost in action in Vietnam. Evolved MH-6 and AH-6 \u201cLittle Bird\u201d special operations and mini gunship variants continue to see action with the U.S. military today in Africa and the Middle East.\n\nBack in the 1980s, McDonnell Douglas received an order for 102 helicopters from the Delta-Avia Fluggerate, an export firm registered in West Germany under businessman Kurt Behrens. Between 1983 and 1985, the U.S. company Associated Industries transferred eighty-six MD 500D and -E helicopters and one Hughes 300 (an even smaller two-man type) via six shipments for export by Delta Avia to Japan, Nigeria, Portugal and Spain.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Pyongyang has maintained the fleet of 87 U.S.-built helicopters it smuggled into the country more than a quarter century ago.", "authors": ["Sebastien Roblin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GbUIu_y3WU_de78wB1XNbQ--~B/aD04Nzk7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/e4ea12eabb14d3657fb0d52b5012f02f", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
