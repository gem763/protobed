Flight tomorrow cancelled due to the BA strike. BA rebooked me Victoria-Seattle-LHR but didn't explain I needed a US visa to transit via Seattle.\n\n\u201cRefused boarding at Victoria today, now stranded. Can you help get me home?\u201d\n\nhttp://players.brightcove.net/624246174001/default_default/index.html?videoId=6082850384001\n\nPrince Harry says 'no one is perfect' as he launches global initiative to encourage more environmentally friendly travel\n\nBritish Airways is telling passengers: \u201cWe\u2019re extremely sorry for the problems caused by the strike action called by the pilots\u2019 union, Balpa, on 9, 10 and 27 September.\n\n\u201cWe proposed an offer of 11.5 per cent over three years to Balpa, a deal already accepted by members of the Unite and GMB unions, which represent 90 per cent of British Airways\u2019 staff, a deal which we believe is fair.\u201d\n\n\"If your flight is cancelled, please do not go to the airport.\"\n\nBA says that the pilots\u2019 union negotiating team shook on a deal on 12 August but then backtracked.\n\nBalpa disputes the 11.5 per cent figure. It has put forward a new proposal in a letter to the airline\u2019s chief executive, Alex Cruz. It was rejected by BA, which says: \u201cWe continue to be available for constructive talks with Balpa, on the basis that there are no pre-conditions to those talks.\u201d\n\nBrian Strutton, general secretary of Balpa, said: \u201cOur members\u2019 resolve is very strong and they remain very angry with BA, but they also want to leave no stone unturned in trying to find a resolution to their dispute.\n\n\u201cAvoiding strike action and agreeing a deal with their pilots surely must be the desired outcome for British Airways.\n\nThe airline is expected to withdraw staff travel concessions from striking flight crew. A significant number of BA pilots live away from London and use the discount scheme to fly to and from work.\n\nThe first two-day stoppage is expected to cost British Airways around \u00a3100m in lost revenue and additional costs.", "description": "On the eve of the biggest strike in its history, British Airways has urged passengers hit by the walk-out not to go to the airport.Members of the British Airline Pilots\u2019 Association (Balpa) working for BA voted overwhelmingly in favour of industrial action in a dispute over pay.", "authors": ["Simon Calder"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/d2NLO2hAGHCfDlFQxW5KoQ--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/8dcfd7f607155774d22623ab2b5117c7", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
