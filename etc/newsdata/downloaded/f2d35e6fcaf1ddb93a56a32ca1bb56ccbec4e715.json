The latter took his case to the Supreme Court, while Avery\u2019s attempt at a new trial was thrown out just last month.\n\nThe new documentary series\u2019s director, Shawn Rech, told Newsweek they are yet to confirm the legitimacy of the prisoner\u2019s confession, but said that \u201cseeing as it was given by a notable convicted murderer from Wisconsin, we feel responsible to deliver any and all possible evidence to law enforcement and legal teams\u201d.\n\nHe added that over 20 months, his team have \u201cuncovered an unfathomable amount of information and evidence that is leading us to the truth\u201d.\n\nDassey\u2019s lawyer, Laura Nirider, said: \u201cWe are aware of the alleged confession given by an inmate in Brendan\u2019s case.
