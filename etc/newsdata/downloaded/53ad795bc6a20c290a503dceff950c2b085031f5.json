Sevilla is undefeated in four rounds after also winning at Espanyol and drawing with Celta Vigo.\n\nNext weekend Lopetegui\u2019s Sevilla will host Madrid.\n\nThe win at Alav\u00e9s pushed Sevilla into first place. Atl\u00e9tico Madrid is one point behind, followed by Real Madrid and Athletic Bilbao two points back. Defending champion Barcelona and Real Sociedad are three points off the pace.\n\nFIRST GOALS\n\nEspanyol scored its first goals of the season and got its first win after fighting back for a 2-1 victory at Eibar.\n\nFacundo Ferreyra and Esteban Granero scored in the final 15 minutes to pull off the comeback.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A masterfully taken free kick by Sevilla midfielder Joan Jord\u00e1n earned a 1-0 victory at Alav\u00e9s and lifted his team to the top of the standings in the Spanish league on Sunday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Joseph Wilson"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
