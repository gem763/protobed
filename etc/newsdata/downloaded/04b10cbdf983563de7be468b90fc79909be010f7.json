The company began streamlining in 2017 after explosive sales growth petered out as consumers shifted some of their dollars toward active lifestyle brands like Lululemon.\n\nShares of the Baltimore company are down 23% since its last earnings report in July. Its stock rose more than 2% in premarket trading on Tuesday.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
