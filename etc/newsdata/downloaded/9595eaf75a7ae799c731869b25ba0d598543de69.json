He is intelligent, colorful, articulate, and engaging, and has already performed a valuable public service by exposing the incoherent sycophancy of some of Trump\u2019s media water-carriers.\n\nAnd, of course, the enemy of my enemy is my friend. But I also can\u2019t help reflect that this is how we got here.\n\nConservatives looked the other way, struck alliances, made accommodations because, well, we were all on the same side, right?\n\nYes, politics is about addition, and we can use all the help we can get, and politics often makes strange bedfellows (pick your clich\u00e9 of choice). I get all that. I also agree that we can\u2019t get hung up on questions of ideological purity and should welcome defectors.\n\nBut the enemy of my enemy temptation is also how conservatives found themselves in bed with guys like Charlie Kirk, Steve Bannon, Sheriff Clarke, and all the misfit toys and grifters on the right\u2026 because the alliances seemed to make so much sense at the time.", "description": "", "authors": ["Charlie Sykes", "Thebulwark.Com The_Problem_With_Joe_Walsh"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
