Elijah E. Cummings has confirmed that his now-viral handshake snub of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell at the congressman\u2019s memorial last week was deliberate.\n\nA video showing Bobby Rankin brushing past Mr. McConnell\u2019s extended hand during Cummings\u2018 memorial at the Capitol racked up millions of views since Thursday, with many social media users lauding Mr. Rankin as a hero.\n\nIn an interview with The Washington Post published Monday, the 64-year-old Mr. Rankin said his reason for snubbing the senator stemmed from the loss of his brother one year ago.\n\nHe said his brother, Jerry, died from cancer after being exposed to tainted water while serving in the Marines at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. Without further clarification, Mr. Rankin blamed Mr. McConnell for Jerry not receiving the veterans\u2019 benefits he was owed before he died.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw Mitch McConnell, all I saw was my brother\u2019s face,\u201d he told The Post. \u201cElijah Cummings reached across party lines trying to help my brother get his military benefits, and Mitch McConnell was one of the persons he reached out to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI could not put my hands in the man\u2019s hand who refused to help somebody who served his country,\u201d he added. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do it, because I was thinking about my brother.\u201d\n\nMr. McConnell did not return The Post\u2019s multiple requests for comment on Mr. Rankin\u2019s claims.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
