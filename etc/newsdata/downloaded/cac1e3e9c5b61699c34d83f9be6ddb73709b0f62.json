Dump Frey and Omar! Make America Great Again!' the president said in a tweet that amplified the dispute.\n\nFrey trolled him in a reply that made reference to the campaign's history of sticking cities with security costs.\n\n'Yawn... Welcome to Minneapolis where we pay our bills, we govern with integrity, and we love all of our neighbors,' Frey tweeted.\n\nDonald Trump picked a fight with Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Wednesday over security charges for the president's upcoming rally that Trump's campaign says are exorbitant.

Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., left, and Tina Smith, D-Minn., on Thursday, January 24, 2019\n\nThe president's campaign has accused Frey of 'abusing the power of his office and attempting to extort' the campaign by 'conjuring a phony and outlandish bill for security in an effort to block a scheduled Keep America Great rally'\n\nTrump's campaign refused to repay the city of El Paso for $470,417.05 in expenses incurred by the local fire department, police department, airport and other government agencies during the president's February visit to the border town.\n\nA late payment fee increased the total costs to more than $500,000.\n\nIn January of 2017, the Center for Public Integrity reported that Trump and his Democratic competitors were all guilty of leaning on cities for security.\n\nHillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders were truant in repaying municipalities that provided security for their allies, but Trump has been accused of stiffing them altogether.\n\nThe candidate who likes to brag about his crowd sizes had bigger bills. And he refuses to admit on federal forms that he owes those cities any money.\n\nHis campaign never entered into formal contracts with the cities, only the venues, making it impossible for municipalities to collect on those debts.\n\nFrey is attempting to recoup the costs another way. He's charging the venue directly, the Trump campaign says, prior to Thursday night's evening's rally.\n\nThe city estimated $530,000 in security costs for the rally that could get unruly. Trump's tweet on Tuesday indicated he'll open verbal fire on Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Somali-American immigrant who represents Minneapolis in Congress.\n\nTrump's campaign says the city on Minneapolis presented the Target Center with a bill for security, and the venue passed it on to the president's reelection campaign.\n\nAccording to the campaign, the Target Center, which is managed by entertainment company AEG, threatened to cancel the rally, if Trump refused to prepay.\n\nFrey trolled him in a reply that made reference to the campaign's history of stiffing cities on security costs\n\nPolice officers stand in front of President Donald Trump demonstrators, keeping them separated from Trump supporters during a June rally in Orlando Florida\n\nIn a statement Tuesday night, the Trump campaign assigned the blame to Frey's office.\n\n'Democrat Mayor Frey is using the bogus security charges to pressure the Target Center, site of the contracted October 10, 2019 rally, into preventing Minnesota residents from exercising their First Amendment rights in support of President Trump,' the campaign claimed.\n\nIt said: 'Frey\u2019s city government preemptively informed the Target Center that it would be responsible for $530,000 in security and other costs related to the event. The Target Center attempted to pass the costs on to the Trump campaign under threat of withholding the use of the arena.'\n\nThe Trump campaign erroneously claimed that the U.S. Secret Service 'is solely responsible for coordinating security' and warned that 'withholding the use of the arena would be viewed as a breach of contract and result in court action.'\n\n'Additionally, the ridiculous sum of $530,000 is more than 26 times the estimated security costs for a 2009 Target Center health care rally held by President Barack Obama. Police officials estimated that the costs then were around $20,000. Again, the costs are a matter between the city and the Secret Service,' the statement said.\n\nFrey did not dispute the underlying facts of the matter on Tuesday morning.\n\nA news article the Trump campaign provided as evidence of its claims said that 50 extra officers were brought in to secure Obama's rally at the center ten years ago, and the added security measures were expected to cost more than $20,000. Obama is pictured at the Target Center in September 2009\n\nA news article the Trump campaign provided as evidence of its claims said that 50 extra officers were brought in to secure Obama's rally at the center ten years ago, and the added security measures were expected to cost more than $20,000. A final tally of costs was not provided.\n\nFrey had not responded to the Obama cost comparison as of Tuesday morning. Requests for comment from the mayor's office were not immediately returned, either.\n\nThe Obama rally was held 10 years prior, though, and the Twin Cities Pioneer Press article only referred to police department costs. It did not address charges to other local agencies the city may have incurred such as medical, fire and aviation costs.\n\nIn a tweet several hours hours prior to the charge, Frey said Trump would not be successful in his attempt to flip the state of Minnesota, which the Republican lost to Clinton by a fewer than a half-million vote.\n\nRetweeting the state Democratic Party, which had called Trump's message 'hateful,' Frey said: 'We've seen this playbook before. Trying to drive a wedge between Minneapolis and Greater Minnesota didn't work in 2018 and \u2014 with your help \u2014 it won't work in 2020.'\n\nTrump labeled him a radical leftist in Tuesday morning tweet. The president claimed his attempt to collect was 'probably illegal,' and he'd still be rallying his supporters on Thursday night.\n\n'Someone please tell the Radical Left Mayor of Minneapolis that he can\u2019t price out Free Speech. Probably illegal! I stand strongly & proudly with the great Police Officers and Law Enforcement of Minneapolis and the Great State of Minnesota! See you Thursday Night!' he asserted.", "description": "Donald Trump picked a fight with Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Tuesday over security charges for the president's upcoming rally that Trump's campaign says are exorbitant.", "authors": ["Francesca Chambers", "Senior White House Correspondent For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/13/19442648-0-image-a-44_1570539546721.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
