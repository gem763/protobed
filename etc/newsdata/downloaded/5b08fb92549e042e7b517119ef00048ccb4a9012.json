It has threats from local public who do not see eye to eye with journalists or the press. It has threats from the militants.\u201d\n\nIndian leaders have cited threats of \u201cexternally aided terrorism\u201d to justify the communications ban, but journalists are warning that months-long outages are perpetuating cycles of misinformation which could just lead to more unrest.\n\n\u201cThe press in Kashmir should have more access should have more rights,\u201d Shah said. \u201cThat is when you will be able to control the rumors, rather than having distorted narratives, which create further chaos.\u201d\n\nLast week, India announced that it would restore service to some mobile phone plans, but continues to block text messaging and the internet. It\u2019s also stalled on repeated requests by journalists to restore web access in their offices.\n\n\u201cIt shows the style of functioning of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, that he is authoritarian and fascist. He just wants to curb the freedom of expression, that\u2019s it,\u201d said Ishfaq Naseem, a freelance journalist in Kashmir who writes for international publications told VICE news.\n\nShah, who lives in a neighborhood where anti-government protests happen each Friday, has witnessed first-hand how the lack of communications has fueled anger.\n\n\u201cI'm sure people living all across having been recording and they will start sharing that. More and more videos and information will start pouring out,\u201d Shah said. \u201cI think it is the fear of that, that the communication blockage still continues.\u201d\n\nEdited by Rachel Win.\n\nCover: \"The Kashmir Walla\" being printed for weekly distribution at the press.", "description": "A government-imposed communications ban is preventing journalists from calling sources and doing research online.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5db07fb086c00a00925b3075/lede/1571849028358-kash.jpeg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
