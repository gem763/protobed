A 50 meter (164-foot) -high, man-made mound _ the presumed tomb of Antiochus _ sets the background.\n\nSon of the founder of the Commagene kingdom, Antiochus reigned between 64 and 38 BC, until he was deposed by the Romans. The kingdom spanned an area from the eastern edge of the Taurus mountains to the Euphrates River.\n\nThe ancient site _ which includes giant 10-meter (33-foot) -high, seated statues of Antiochus himself surrounded by ancient Gods, including Zeus and Apollo _ was discovered in 1881 by a German engineer. Excavations began there in the 1950s.\n\nToday, the site is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the monuments are among the best-known images of Turkey, featuring on postcards and Turkish tourism posters and ads.\n\nVisitors climb to the site at dawn or at dusk to see the statues under the spectacular lighting. It\u2019s also a favorite spot for stargazers to watch the night sky.\n\n__\n\nSuzan Fraser in Ankara, Turkey contributed.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Visitors snap photos of massive stone heads that stare down on them from the summit of Mount Nemrut, in Turkey\u2019s southeastern Adiyaman province, their faces illuminated by sunset lighting.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Emrah Gurel"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/04/turkey_nemrut_mountain_photo_gallery_94064_c0-217-3363-2177_s1770x1032.jpg?9510c0902414ce8e225278ade9ef673ca2259c77", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
