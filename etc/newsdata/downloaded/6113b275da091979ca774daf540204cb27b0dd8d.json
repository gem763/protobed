Still, I shouldn\u2019t have said it. I apologised.\u2019\n\nRant: \u2018I got that Gaga\u2019s single Born This Way definitely sounded similar to Express Yourself, but I couldn\u2019t see why she was so ungracious and nasty about it'\n\nHaving his say: \u2018I think it\u2019s just wrong \u2014 an established artist shouldn\u2019t kick down a younger artist right at the start of their career'\n\nDuring the interview in question, Elton said of Madonna: 'She\u2019s such a nightmare, sorry. Her career\u2019s over, I can tell you that.\n\n\u2018Her tour\u2019s been a disaster. She\u2019s been so horrible to Gaga. If Madonna had any common sense she\u2019d have made a record like Ray Of Light, stayed away from the dance stuff and just been a great pop singer and make great pop records which she does brilliantly.\n\n'But no, she had to prove that she was, like\u2026 and she looks like a f**king fairground stripper.'\n\nIn 2016, Elton revealed that he ended his bitter feud with the Queen of pop when they were coincidentally ended up at the same restaurant and he invited her to share a meal with him.\n\nHarsh: At the time of Madonna's interview, Elton hit out at the Material Girl singer, calling her a 'nightmare' and a 'fairground stripper', little realising his comments would be broadcast on TV\n\nHe told The Graham Norton Show: \u2018I said something horrible about her that you should never say. I was in a restaurant in the south of France a couple of years ago and she walked in so I sent her a note saying, \u201cYou\u2019ll probably never speak to me again but I am really sorry and ashamed of myself and can I buy you dinner.\u201d\n\n'She was very gracious and accepted and we talked. We are fine \u2013 it was just me and my big mouth.\u2019\n\nThe father of two jokingly added: \u2018I can\u2019t say it won\u2019t happen again but not with Madonna!\u2019\n\nHowever, it appears that the star may well have reignited their drama following his latest comments in his memoir.\n\nMeanwhile, Madonna and Lady Gaga, 33, certainly seemed to have buried the hatchet, as the two pop stars partied together at an Oscars after-party earlier this year.", "description": "Elton John, 72, branded Madonna, 61, 'nasty and ungracious' over her past comments about Lady Gaga, 33.", "authors": ["Niomi Harris For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/21/20152544-0-image-a-87_1571949557661.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
