Growth lagged in domestic and international same-store sales, and the slowdown hit Domino's top and bottom lines.\n\n\"We remain steadfastly focused on driving profitable growth for the Domino's system, and most importantly, for our franchisees,\" Domino's CEO Ritch Allison said in the report. He added that the company faced \"a unique competitive environment.\"\n\nHere are the key numbers:\n\nAdjusted earnings per share: $2.05, versus the $2.07 estimate\n\nRevenue: $820.8 million, versus the $823.1 million estimate\n\nDomestic same-store sales growth: 2.4%, versus 6.4% in the year-ago period\n\nGlobal same-store sales growth: 1.7%, versus 3.3% in the year-ago period\n\nThe company also shifted its guidance model, providing new forecasts for the next two to three years instead of its previous three to five year estimates. Domino's now expects global retail stores to see 7% to 10% sales growth in the next two to three years. It previously anticipated 8% to 12% sales growth over the next three to five years.\n\nThe third-quarter report announced board approval of an up to $1 billion share buyback program.
