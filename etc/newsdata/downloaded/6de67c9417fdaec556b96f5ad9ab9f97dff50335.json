ParkJockey: The Florida-based company\u2019s ambition is to sell space access to businesses such as ride-hail, car rental and food delivery.\n\nTo do that, it wants to sell an \u201coperating system\u201d (hardware and software) to garage owners that will turn their real estate into a service that customers can pay to access.\n\nLate last year, ParkJockey acquired 2 large parking operators as part of a financing round led by SoftBank.\n\n2. City Storage Systems: Best known as former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick\u2019s new undertaking, the company is also in the business of repurposing parking lots.\n\nIt's been buying up properties, including parking garages, that it will turn into commercial kitchens for delivery-only restaurants and other consumer services.\n\n3. SpotHero: The company is focused on a parking spot booking app (for human drivers), but it\u2019s already thinking about the arrival of robot drivers.\n\nIt\u2019s been working with partner lots to upgrade some of their technology to handle autonomous vehicles, which CEO Mark Lawrence tells Axios can also have immediate benefits for human drivers .\n\n\u201cEvery location that we make [AV]-ready today is a better experience for our consumers now,\u201d Lawrence says. \u201cWe\u2019ve done studies that show that people are willing to pay more for an automated experience versus one that\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, some real estate developers also are planning for a future without as much parking space.\n\nAvalonBay Communities, which is working on an upcoming residential complex in Los Angeles, has designed a large parking garage that they anticipate converting to recreational purposes like a gym and theater, and even some retail and restaurant space.\n\nThe owner of the Grove and other upscale shopping centers is working with Google to eventually convert to more restaurants and stores, according to the LA Times.\n\nYes, but: Developers already have tough decisions to make in regards to their investments, which typically have a 30-year horizon, as they juggle near- and long-term uses.\n\nConstruction costs for above-ground parking structures can cost $21,000 per space, and another $500 per year to maintain each space. Meanwhile, parking costs an average of $2 per hour in the U.S., but can reach $33 for 2 hours of parking in New York.\n\nAnd converting garages is expensive: In Pittsburgh, it cost $17 million to convert a 3-floor garage into more than 60 apartment units.\n\nThe bottom line: These companies may have to make big investments years before it's clear if they made the right bet.\n\nGo deeper:", "description": "Empty parking spaces may be repurposed as food delivery hubs or vehicle recharging centers", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/kud3d3jaENemGqA3ITXj3Ge-Aqo=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/05/30/1559239970634.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-31"}
