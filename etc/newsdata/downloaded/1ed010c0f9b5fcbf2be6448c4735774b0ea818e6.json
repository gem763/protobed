REUTERS/Peter Nicholls\n\nOne of Britain\u2019s top Brexit negotiators is set to join Goldman Sachs after a year sabbatical.\n\nOlly Robbins, Theresa May\u2019s Europe Adviser and chief Brexit negotiator, will join the investment bank in 2020 as a managing director covering UK corporates.\n\nMultiple outlets reported the move late on Monday. Sky News first reported the appointment.\n\n44-year-old Robbins was Theresa May top Brexit advisor and is credited with negotiating the so-called Chequers deal that has proved unpopular with Brexiteers.\n\nRobbins became a lightning rod for criticism due to what many Brexiteers saw as his pro-EU influence over the negotiations. Last month, Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage dismissed leaked documents on no deal Brexit preparations \u201can Olly Robbins special\u201d and \u201cfear-mongering.\u201d\n\nOxford-educated Robbins is a life-long civil servant and has served under four different prime ministers.\n\nThe hire by Goldman Sachs extends the investment bank\u2019s reputation for enjoying a cosy relationship with governments. The bank\u2019s chairman in London Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, the former prime minister of Portugal and president of the European Commission from 2004 to 2014.\n\nIn the US, the bank has been nicknamed \u201cGovernment Sachs\u201d due to the close links between Goldman and policymakers. The most high profile recent example was Gary Cohn, who quit as COO of the bank to become Donald Trump\u2019s National Economic Council director.\n\nIn a public statement, the Cabinet Office said Robbins would first take up a position at Oxford University before joining Goldman Sachs.\n\nRobbins will become the first ever Heywood Fellow, a new position established at the university in honour of former Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood. Robbins will explore \u201cissues relating to public service and policy\u201d in the position.\n\nBoris Johnson said in a statement: \u201cI am delighted that Olly will be the first Permanent Secretary to take up this Fellowship in Jeremy Heywood\u2019s memory, which follows his many years of dedication to public service in a variety of different roles.\u201d\n\nRobbins said: \u201cIt is an enormous privilege to be given the opportunity to reflect on some of the challenges the Civil Service faces, as the first Heywood Fellow.\u201d\n\nSeparately on Tuesday, it was announced that Robbins will be awarded a KCMG for public service as part of Theresa May\u2019s resignation honours list.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nOscar Williams-Grut covers banking, fintech, and finance for Yahoo Finance UK.
