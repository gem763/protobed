REUTERS/Anushree Fadnavis/File Photo\n\nThe six-member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) cut the repo rate by 25 basis points to 5.15%, in line with expectations in a Reuters poll. The reverse repo rate was reduced to 4.9%.\n\nAll six MPC members voted in favour of a rate cut and for retaining the accommodative stance, the statement said.\n\nCOMMENTARY\n\nRUPA REGE-NITSURE, GROUP CHIEF ECONOMIST, L&T FINANCE HOLDINGS, MUMBAI\n\n\u201cIt is a no-event monetary policy. A reduction of 25 bps was factored in by the street. What is noteworthy is the MPC\u2019s clear admission that growth has slowed significantly and broad-based demand weakness will keep headline CPI under check.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is definitely a scope for further rate cuts but as the MPC has rightly asserted, intensified efforts are needed to restore the growth momentum.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn our opinion, the RBI as a central bank has done more than enough to stabilise economic settings. From here onwards, monetary easing may not achieve much incrementally.\u201d\n\n\u201cInstead of aggressive easing, what we need is the dedicated effort to remove structural constraints at individual sector level. The RBI can support this effort by focusing on financial stability.\u201d\n\nBARNABAS GAN, ECONOMIST, UOB GROUP, SINGAPORE\n\n\u201cThe RBI has been the most aggressive central bank in Asia, injecting rate cut into the economy. Given the fact the (PM Narendra) Modi has plans to make India $5-trillion economy over the next five years, India\u2019s present growth is at a 6-year low. With the modest growth we have seen so far, it does give the RBI a reason to cut rates further.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have also been seeing that the government is also coming with a fiscal policy. All these moves should actually be sufficient to cushion the slowdown in India\u2019s growth.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe expect the central bank to likely monitor how the growth is panning out. Given how things are going, we expect the RBI to hold its hand in December to see how the rate cuts are translating as the fiscal policy is also in place.\u201d\n\nSIDDHARTHA SANYAL, CHIEF ECONOMIST AND HEAD OF RESEARCH, BANDHAN BANK, KOLKATA\n\n\u201cThe cut was in line with market consensus, and we wouldn\u2019t have been surprised if the magnitude of the cut was slightly higher. We continue to see inflation well-anchored. This will offer the central bank more room for easing going ahead. We see rates eventually going to sub-5% by the first half of 2020.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe expect some more transmission of rate cuts to borrowers will happen given that the cumulative reduction in repo rate is now 135 basis points during 2019. But that will likely be only a gradual process, given the current weak sentiment and lack of momentum in investments and credit demand from larger corporates in several pockets of the economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cInterestingly, in the absolute lower end of the socio-economic pyramid, however, credit growth seems to be notably better at the moment.\u201d\n\nRAJESH CHERUVU, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, VALIDUS WEALTH, MUMBAI\n\n\u201cThe MPC just about met estimates by cutting rates by 25 bps. Markets were expecting more, some as high as 40 bps. While the MPC has been dovish and accommodative, the extent of FY20 real GDP downgrade from 6.9% to 6.1% in a span of 2-2.5 months only does raise questions. Couple this with the RBI\u2019s expectation of Q2FY20 CPI hardening by 30 bps over the same 2-2.5 months due to surging food prices, and the picture for bond yields is slightly worrying.\u201d\n\n\u201cTransmission yet again remains a focal point with the full impact of rate cuts still to translate to India\u2019s banking system. The RBI is doing its homework, but its arguably reactionary nature and the policy itself could leave markets with a sense of wanting for more in light of the stress seen recently in a renowned, now troubled HFC, a corporation bank and its exposure to an \u201cinfamous\u201d real estate firm and the PCA (Prompt Corrective Action) on the said HFC\u2019s merger partner.\u201d\n\nSHILAN SHAH, SENIOR INDIA ECONOMIST, CAPITAL ECONOMICS, SINGAPORE\n\n\u201cThe official policy stance remains \u201caccommodative\u201d, suggesting that further loosening will follow in the near term. We are pencilling in another 25 bps cut in December.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe extent of rate cuts should eventually support a pick-up in economic growth. In turn, we think that underlying price pressures will rise and push headline CPI inflation above the 4% target by the middle of next year.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven that interest rates in emerging markets rarely stay on hold for prolonged periods, we think the MPC will opt for modest rate hikes by the end of 2020.\u201d\n\nANAGHA DEODHAR, ECONOMIST, ICICI SECURITIES, MUMBAI\n\n\u201cWe are penciling in one more rate cut, albeit of a smaller magnitude (around 15 bps). This takes our terminal repo rate expectation to 5% by the end of FY20. Likely pick-up in growth and inflation in H2 along with the fiscal stimulus provided by corporate tax cuts are likely to limit the room for MPC to cut rates.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe upward revision in Q2 inflation confirms that the MPC had underestimated inflation previously.\u201d\n\n\u201cCurrently, the outlook for economic growth is weak, both domestically and globally. Hence, aggressive easing of monetary policy is unlikely to boost economic growth significantly.\u201d\n\nGARIMA KAPOOR, ECONOMIST AND VICE-PRESIDENT, ELARA CAPITAL, MUMBAI\n\n\u201cWhile lower lending rates are welcome, they alone may not be able to turn around the sentiment in the economy. It would need to be accompanied by spending from the government.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe current sluggish growth dynamics and benign outlook on inflation suggest that the MPC would have more room to cut rates.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy November-end, data is likely to indicate that GDP growth in Q2 hasn\u2019t improved much from Q1 levels basis the high frequency data. We expect terminal repo rate to be 4.75% in this easing cycle.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith the linking of floating lending rate to external benchmark, the transmission of rate cuts from here will be immediate. Moreover, with RBI maintaining surplus liquidity and continuing to guide for an accommodative stance, we believe the transmission is only likely to improve from here.\u201d\n\nK. JOSEPH THOMAS, HEAD RESEARCH, EMKAY WEALTH MANAGEMENT, MUMBAI\n\n\u201cThe RBI has once again proved to be well ahead of the curve in unleashing monetary efficacies to combat the economic slowdown... with the cut of 25 bps (and) bringing down the repo rate to 5.15%.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn conformity with this aggressive approach, the RBI is likely to continue with its campaign for more rapid transmission of the benefits to credit users, through lower rates to a large extent linked to the base rate. There may be further cuts in the rate in light of the GDP growth forecast being lowered form 6.90% to 6.10% for FY20. We need to see more action from the government for a consumption-led recovery.\u201d", "description": "The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Friday cut interest rates for a fifth straight meeting this year, stepping up its efforts to kickstart an economy growing at its slowest pace in six years.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1436931310&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF930FP", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
