And it may hurt him more that it came from someone else than you. There are, of course, chances that he may not find out about it. Are you willing to take the risk? Or is your partner finding out a distant probability and you would rather not tell him? Would you rather shield him from the pain as it meant nothing or tell him everything as you prefer honesty?One thing you should know is that nothing binds you to talk about your cheating with your partner. If you feel talking about it will help fix your relationship, sure, go ahead. If you want to end things with your partner but don\u2019t want to tell them that you have cheated, that is fine too. At the end of the day, everyone gets to decide for themselves if they should tell their partner. There is no such moral compass when it comes to cheating and it definitely, does not label you as a bad person. You are only human who is trying to figure it all out, so, don\u2019t be hard on yourself.", "description": "There is no absolute law when it comes to telling your partner that you cheated.
