She\u2019s been a pivotal voice in speaking out against Ignatova and her accomplices, revealing the tactics scammers used in the scheme to con as much as \u00a34 billion ($5 billion) from victims around the world.\n\nBut it seems not everyone is able to stomach the truth that OneCoin is nothing more than an old-fashioned Ponzi scheme with no actual product.\n\n\u201cIt is horrible, the abuse is vile and the threats feel very real to me, I\u2019m always looking over my shoulder now,\u201d McAdam told the BBC.\n\n\u201cIt is taking its toll on my health but I will not give up until me and the thousands of other OneCoin victims like me see some form of justice,\u201d she added.\n\nMcAdam is just one of 70,000 UK-based victims who invested into the OneCoin scam.\n\nThe Glaswegian invested \u00a38,000 ($10,000) of her personal finances into the Ponzi scheme; she also ended up forming a layer of the pyramid herself after encouraging friends and family to invest a further \u00a3220,000 ($279,000) into OneCoin.\n\nRuja Ignatova, along with her brother, Konstantin Ignatov, ran OneCoin which claimed to be a new and better version of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.\n\nThey held elaborate and glamorous events where they pitched OneCoin to potential investors, and claimed it was going to change the world and usher in a new world of financial freedom. Those who invested early were told they would be at the start of a revolution.\n\nHowever, nothing actually existed, OneCoin didn\u2019t have a blockchain or a cryptocurrency. Ignatova has since vanished and is being charged with money laundering offenses.\n\nMcAdam is campaigning for the OneCoin scam to be taken more seriously in the UK and has reported the death threats to the police. More power to her. The more victims that speak out against scams like this, the better.\n\nWant more Hard Fork?
