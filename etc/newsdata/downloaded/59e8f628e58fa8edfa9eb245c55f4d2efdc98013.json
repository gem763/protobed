(Photo: Getty)\n\nClimate change scares most teens \u2014 and they\u2019re reacting by taking action, according to a new survey.\n\nThe Washington Post and Kaiser Family Foundation published the survey results Monday. The findings couldn\u2019t be more timely: Young people around the world are organising a massive climate strike Friday whose participants already include Patagonia, Lush and Ben & Jerry\u2019s. Their businesses will be closed Friday in solidarity with the Global Climate Strike.\n\nThe survey, conducted between July and August, polled 629 teenagers living in the U.S. (ages 13 to 17) online and by telephone. Fifty-seven per cent of teen participants said climate change makes them feel afraid; 52 per cent felt angry, according to the survey.\n\nAccording to the survey, the teens are doing what they can. About one in four have participated in a walkout, attended a rally, or written a public official to opine on the state of the climate, per the Post.\n\nThat\u2019s something to celebrate \u2014 and this wave of energy is largely thanks to 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg. She began the Fridays for Future movement in August 2018, skipping school every Friday to protest outside the Swedish parliament for the country\u2019s inaction on climate change.\n\nThe teen badass is now in the U.S. for the United Nations Climate Summit keeping her Friday strikes going.\n\nTeens aren\u2019t doing this all alone, though, as the survey results show. The survey included the perspective of some 2,293 adults \u2014 and more than half also feel afraid. Exactly 50 per cent feel angry too, so their emotions aren\u2019t that far off from how the youth are feeling.\n\nSome 38 per cent of adults would call climate change a \u201ccrisis,\u201d which is just a percentage point more than the teens. Both groups \u2014 84 per cent and 88 per cent for adults and teens, respectively \u2014 believe there\u2019s \u201cstill time to prevent the worst effects.\u201d\n\nOur youngest generations are going to bear the worst consequences of climate change, and that\u2019s why they\u2019re not letting this issue go. After all, they didn\u2019t create this mess. This is the world they\u2019ve inherited, though, and they deserve to enjoy it every bit as older generations have. Teens won\u2019t let their fears stop them from taking action. They can\u2019t afford to. None of us can.", "description": "Climate change scares most teens \u2014 and they\u2019re reacting by taking action, according to a new survey....", "authors": ["Tegan Jones", "Germain Lussier"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/kkcnsxrlhj7btzeiv398.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
