According to ABC News Lynchburg affiliate WSET, Wright contacted the high school and learned there was a balance of more than $4,000 in negative accounts.\n\nThe former Marine and father of three said a school staff member told him that the high school was most in need, and \"depending on how well this goes, we can focus on the middle and elementary schools after.\"\n\n\"Children should not be worried about their account balances; they just need to focus on school and getting food to feed their growing minds and bodies,\" he wrote. \"Thank you in advance for any donations.\" Regardless of a student's balance, Amherst County Public Schools did note that they can still receive a hot meal.\n\nSince the campaign began on Wednesday, Wright surpassed his initial goal and closed the campaign out once it reached $7,676.\n\nWright shared the payment details about how the donations were being processed to avoid fees and to be transparent in a post on Facebook.\n\nHe also said he received cash donations and personal checks, which he added into a Navy Federal bank account and transferred the value into the fundraiser.", "description": "A Virginia man pays off high school lunch debt for students.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/school-lunch-stock-gty-jef-190910_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
