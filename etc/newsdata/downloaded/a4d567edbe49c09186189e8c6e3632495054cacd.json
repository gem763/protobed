However, the tunnels below are incredibly fragile, and they feel the strain of the arriving machinery almost immediately. Meanwhile a concerned Tom (Ellis Hollins) voices his concerns about the lack of health and safety regulations and thus stages a protest.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take long for Cindy to get agitated by how slow the work is progressing, and thus she voices her frustrations, however a tonne bag of sand slips from a nearby crane and nearly lands on both her and Tom \u2014 but thankfully it misses both of them.\n\n(Picture: Lime Pictures)\n\nThis is just the beginning, as almost every villager finds themselves caught up in the drama \u2014 including Breda (Moya Brady), who already has enough on her mind \u2014 what with her having promised Tony (Nick Pickard) that he can return home. The villainous granny suffers an accident and crashes into one of the nearby cranes \u2014 an incident which causes a crack in the village floor.\n\n(Picture: Lime Pictures)\n\nMeanwhile, Charlie and Ella \u2014 both of whom are in the tunnels \u2014 find themselves trapped as the ceiling starts to collapse, and they can\u2019t remember which way they came in!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWoody (Jake Quickenden) informs everyone that it\u2019s simply too dangerous to move the crane, but Luke \u2014 who\u2019s been drinking \u2014is having none of his excuses, and \u2014 determined to build his restaurant \u2014 jumps on board to finish the job.\n\n(Picture: Lime Pictures)\n\nConcerned, Nancy (Jessica Fox) asks Darren (Ashley Taylor Dawson) for help in putting a stop to Luke. However, it\u2019s no use, as Luke turns the crane on and proceeds to lose control \u2014 much to everyone\u2019s dismay \u2014 and he begs Woody to help him. The steel girders \u2014 which are loaded in the crane\u2019s arm \u2014 swing atop the village. As a result, Luke exits the cabin.\n\nLater, a steel girder falls from the crane \u2014 but will anyone be injured as a result?\n\nMitchell (Imran Adams) and Scott (Ross Adams) are also caught up in the drama, as are Sienna (Anna Passey) and Finn (Keith Rice) \u2014 both of whom are in their flats and see the crane swinging out of control from their window.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly set to be an eventful week for Hollyoaks, but the question is: will anyone lose their life as a result?\n\nOne to watch: Tuesday 29th October at 7pm on E4.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Chaos ensues during Hollyoaks' biggest week of the year.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/HO-EP-5288-DARREN-NANCY-MANDY-01-9b3d-e1571227185564_1571519844.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
