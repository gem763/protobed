'I actually designed that. I signed off on the design of how they are creating that belt.\n\n'So most certainly that belt was brought into fruition, brought to life because of me: the real bad motherf***er. So most certainly one of those men is on my radar.'\n\nMcGregor is expected to make his long-awaited return to the octagon at the end of the year, though nothing has been confirmed yet.\n\nMcGregor won his rematch against Diaz, having surprisingly lost their first encounter\n\nDana White insisted he has no plans of making a fight between McGregor and Frankie Edgar\n\nHowever, UFC president Dana White has admitted that McGregor will not be facing Edgar despite the Irishman recently suggesting a deal had been struck.\n\nWhite said recently: 'Conor loves to fight and wants to fight again, but that Frankie Edgar fight isn't going to happen.\n\n'Edgar is two weight classes below him. Edgar is in a position; he was supposed to fight Aljamain Sterling, and Aljamain fell out, got hurt.\n\n'Frankie's coming to the end of his career and he could end up getting himself into a title position again. So to take the Conor fight makes no sense.'", "description": "Conor McGregor has admitted he is keen to fight the winner of next month's blockbuster showdown between Nate Diaz and Jorge Masvidal ahead of his expected return to UFC later this year.", "authors": ["Jordan Seward For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/08/20072538-0-image-a-7_1571815954217.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
