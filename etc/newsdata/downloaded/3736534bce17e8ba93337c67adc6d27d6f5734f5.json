(Aboud Hamam/Reuters)\n\nChulov was reporting this past Sunday from the northeastern Syrian city of Qamishli, a Kurdish administrative hub, when news broke that Syrian government forces, who for decades had denied many rights to Kurds, would be returning to towns along the border.\n\nRussia, Chulov explained, had brokered a deal between Kurdish forces and the Syrian government over control of the region.\n\n\"It meant that power was changing hands, and the fear on the streets was palpable,\" said Chulov.\n\nDisplaced Syrians sit in the back of a pick up truck as Arab and Kurdish civilians flee amid Turkey's military assault on Kurdish-controlled areas in northeastern Syria, on Oct. 11 in the Syrian border town of Tal Abyad.

(Stoyan Nenov/Reuters)\n\n\"So new alliances are being very quickly formed in real time,\" he added. \"The Russians are saying very loudly, we are stepping into this space.\"\n\nThe reordering of power has left the Kurds without any close allies, he said, and they may be scrambling to find a regional supporter.\n\n\"Their only play will be to look towards Iran as a regional patron,\" he said.\n\n\"And I think that Iran, who has long coveted northeastern Syria, would see the Kurds of the province as a good way to assert their influence.\"\n\nWritten by Allie Jaynes.
