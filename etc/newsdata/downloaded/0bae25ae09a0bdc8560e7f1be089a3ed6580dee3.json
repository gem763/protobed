Many brands launch limited edition products and collections and donate some or all of the proceeds to various breast cancer charities that help educate people on spotting the disease, and supporting those who are affected by it.\n\nAccording to the NHS, the best way to check yourself is to look for large lumps, or thickened tissue. Often lumps are not cancerous, but always get them checked out by your doctor if you find one.\n\nOther signs to look out for are discharge from your nipples, especially if there's blood, lumps or swelling in either armpits, dimpling around the skin of your breasts, a rash on or around your nipples, and a change in the appearance of your nipple, such as becoming sunken.\n\nIf you've previously had a benign lump, a family history of breast cancer or are very tall or overweight then you may be more likely to be at risk, and should check yourself regularly.\n\nDespite what many people think, pain in your breasts is usually a sign of breast cancer.\n\nAlthough many of these products have pink elements to them, and appear to be directly aimed at women, it's not only women who can suffer from breast cancer.\n\nAn estimated 390 men are diagnosed each year, while around 54,800 women are diagnosed, and it usually occurs in men over 60, but it can also affect men younger than this. For men, the disease usually develops in the small amount of tissue behind their nipples.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

The print features across the collection, which includes tote bags, necklaces, wash bags and other cute accessories. We love that this is something you could wear any time, not just during breast cancer awareness month. In support of CoppaFeel! \u2013 which encourages young people to check for signs of the disease \u2013 \u00a320,000 of profits from Accessorise's collaboration will go to the charity, which is even more reason to invest in this chic head piece.\n\nBuy now\n\nVans classic slip on breast cancer awareness nude check shoes: \u00a354.99, Office\n\nVans has turned its black and white slip on shoe \u2013 arguably the brand\u2019s best known product \u2013 into a mish mash of skin tones with the odd freed nipple and illustrations around the rubber sole. The collection also includes the SK8 Hi high tops with illustrations of people who\u2019ve had a mastectomy. Expect the usual rubber sole\n\nBuy now\n\nClinique dramatically different moisturising lotion jumbo limited edition, 200ml: \u00a339, Clinique\n\nThis classic moisturiser has probably graced most people\u2019s beauty stashes at some point \u2013 and is still part of ours thanks to its silky feel, lightness and lack of scent, making it great for sensitive skin. It comes with a limited edition keyring in support of the charity. The brand will donate \u00a37.84 to the Breast Cancer Campaign for every one of these bottles sold from 1 October. And as it\u2019s so huge, it will last ages.\n\nBuy now\n\nStella McCartney x Adidas mastectomy sports bra: \u00a359, Stella McCartney\n\nOk, so this one doesn\u2019t support a charity \u2013 although the brand does have other products that do \u2013 but the entire idea and production of this raises more awareness of how women\u2019s lives and bodies are affected, post mastectomy and we think that\u2019s pretty important. The bra has a front close zip and extra soft lining which is designed to be comfortable on sensitive skin, it has also been made to support high impact.\n\nBuy now\n\nGirls vs Cancer knockers sweatshirt: \u00a338, Girls vs Cancer\n\nA welcomed colour change, this chunky marl grey jumper comes with three different tongue-in-cheek slogans across it: bangers, fun bags and knockers.
