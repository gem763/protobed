But regardless of where you're applying, Chait said there was a relatively easy way to draw attention to yourself and up your chances of landing the role you want: Be active in your community and build your personal brand.\n\nMaybe that means attending Meetup events for people in your industry; maybe it means staying active on Instagram if you're in a field like marketing.\n\nChait shared a hypothetical example of someone looking to make a career change: The person has a degree in art history, and has been working in food service, but they'd love to get a job in tech.\n\n\"Do you have a GitHub profile?\" Chait said, referring to a site that hosts free programming projects. \"Have you contributed to some open-source projects? Have you gone to a local technical meetup? Have you written some articles on Stack Overflow?\" (Stack Overflow is a question-and-answer site for programmers.)\n\nDora Korpar, a former Trader Joe's employee who's now a programmer at a San Francisco startup, told Business Insider's Julie Bort that it's helpful to create a GitHub profile and participate in open-source projects, since programmers evaluate each other's work there.\n\nEven people who started contributing to Quora and Reddit forums without any intention of finding a job have found career benefits, like potential clients looking at their profiles and getting in touch.\n\nAn additional benefit of being involved in your community, Chait said, is that you might meet people whose teams have openings. \"You get the inside track,\" he said. (Though your willingness to schmooze at Meetup-type events depends on your feelings about the power of networking.)\n\n\"You don't have to be a Pulitzer Prize-winning author or have 2 million followers on Twitter to really stand out,\" Chait added. \"You just have to do something that's somewhat noteworthy and different and represents you.\"", "description": "Boost your chances of landing the job you want by staying active in your community and on social media, Greenhouse CEO Daniel Chait said.", "authors": ["Shana Lebowitz"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5c66efd6262898106f49b2ac?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
