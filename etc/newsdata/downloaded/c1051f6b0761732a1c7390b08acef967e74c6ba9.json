A handful of Republicans have said Trump wasn't serious with the suggestion.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nKudlow also said that Trump\u2019s call for China to investigate the Biden family had not come up during trade discussions, which are set to continue in Washington this week, and that the issues would not be linked together.\n\n\u201cThe president's view is there is no linkage between that and the trade talks. I guarantee there will be no linkage,\u201d Kudlow told reporters.\n\nTrump last week publicly urged Ukraine and China to investigate unsubstantiated corruption allegations about Biden, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, and his son Hunter.\n\nTrump subsequently told reporters he would keep issues related to Biden \u201cseparate\u201d from trade discussions with China while insisting he has the \u201cobligation\u201d to call on foreign countries to investigate corruption and that his urgings had nothing to do with politics.\n\nTrump\u2019s calls have triggered massive scrutiny from House Democrats who are currently pressing forward with an impeachment inquiry focused on a private conversation during which Trump asked Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate Biden.\n\nRepublicans have offered varying degrees of defense of Trump, with some suggesting he was not serious when he urged China to investigate the Bidens.\n\n\u201cI think he's getting the press all spun up about this.

That\u2019s all he\u2019s doing,\u201d Jordan continued.\n\nTrump administration officials are hosting a delegation of Chinese officials for trade discussions later this week as the U.S. and China seek to resolve their ongoing trade dispute.\n\nTrump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, a partial transcript of which has since been released by the White House, triggered a whistleblower complaint alleging Trump was using his official office to solicit foreign interference in an election.\n\nTrump has insisted there was nothing improper about his conversation with Ukraine, while doubling down on the allegations against Biden without offering specific evidence.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m only interested in corruption. I don\u2019t care about politics. I don\u2019t care about Biden's politics.
