I don\u2019t give a (expletive) about no belt. He\u2019s the trophy. There\u2019s so many holes that I see. I\u2019m not going to sit here and talk (expletive) about him. He\u2019s great, he\u2019s accomplished a lot, but that fight makes so much sense. It\u2019s like one of those built-up animes: \u2018Dragon Ball Z\u2019 vs. \u2018Naruto,\u2019 right? So I want that.\u201d\n\nHall (15-9 MMA, 8-7 UFC) who\u2019s coming off back-to-back wins over Bevon Lewis, and Antonio Carlos Jr. last month at UFC on ESPN+ 16, thinks he has the style to stand and trade with \u201cThe Last Stylebender.\u201d\n\nAnd he thinks that Adesanya\u2019s past opponents have shown him too much respect in the striking department.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a feeling \u2013 I know I was destined to fight him, it\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Hall said. \u201cIn terms of holes \u2013 I mean, there are so many. Everyone has holes. I have holes, too. I\u2019m sure he sees them. My job is to not let him get them. But I just know how to fight him. I know how to fight that style. That\u2019s a very creative style and you can\u2019t be one dimensional when you fight a style like that. You can\u2019t go out there and just box and be one dimensional. We see the opponents that go out there and get starstruck or just get out of their element.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very dynamic. I\u2019m extremely dynamic. And with that two-dynamic creativity, it\u2019s just going to create this explosion and the world doesn\u2019t know. They don\u2019t even know what\u2019s going to happen, so it\u2019s just a matter of time.\u201d\n\nDespite having inconsistencies throughout his UFC career, Hall thinks he\u2019s finally found his groove. He came out of \u201cThe Ultimate Fighter\u201d in 2013 with a lot of hype and wasn\u2019t quite able to live up to it, but thinks he\u2019s now ready to make a run in the 185-pound division.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see their faces when I get that strap because I\u2019m the guy that\u2019s not supposed to,\u201d Hall said. \u201cCoulda, woulda, shoulda \u2013 but it\u2019s just a matter of time. It\u2019s inevitable. It\u2019s going to happen. I believe it. I want it. I\u2019m going to have it. But I\u2019ve got to do what I\u2019ve got to do.\u201d", "description": "Uriah Hall wants to fight middleweight champion Israel Adesanya and thinks he has the standup style to compete with him.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Mike Bohn", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Simon Head", "Nolan King", "George Garcia"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/uriah-hall-antonio-carlos-junior-ufc-on-espn-plus-16-8.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
