At a rally on Thursday, he said it was his \u201cunconventional\u201d approach that led to the deal.\n\nThe agreement requires the Kurdish fighters to vacate a swath of territory in Syria along the Turkish border, largely solidifying Turkey's position.\n\nA senior military official -- who worked on designing the U.S. anti-ISIS strategy with both the Kurds and the Turks -- told Fox News earlier that the 120-hour cease-fire had little chance of success.\n\n\"There is no way the Kurds can leave that security zone,\" the source said. \"There are thousands of Kurds who live in what the Turks want as a buffer zone. That\u2019s what these fighters\u2019 families live. That is where they are from.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nVice President Mike Pence told Fox News in an exclusive interview that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan knows Trump \u201csays what he means\" when he talks about slapping new sanctions on Turkey if its military defies the terms of the agreement.\n\nPence acknowledged the Trump administration was grateful to the Kurds that \"helped us defeat ISIS,\" but point out that Turkey \"had very real issues of terrorism and ISIS and the PKK organization, a Kurdish terrorist group the United States recognized as a terrorist organization many years ago.\"\n\nFox News' Jennifer Griffin, Melissa Leon and the Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Just hours after President Trump announced a cease-fire between Turkish and Kurdish-led forces in Syria, journalists have reported continued fighting in the Syrian town of Ras al-Ayn on Friday morning, while other areas\u00a0have reported relative calm since the agreement.", "authors": ["Edmund Demarche", "Edmund Demarche Is A News Editor For Foxnews.Com.
