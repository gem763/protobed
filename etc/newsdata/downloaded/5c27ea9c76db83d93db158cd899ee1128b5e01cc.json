She has previously denied the charges against her.\n\nHer bodyguard, Rani Saidi, received an eight-month suspended sentence and a 5,000 euro (\u00a34,460) fine.\n\nAfter the trial Princess Hassa's French lawyer, Emmanuel Moyne, said the plumber's allegations were \"fanciful\", and said they would launch an appeal.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nIn September 2016, Mr Eid was called to the fifth floor of the luxury apartment block on Avenue Foch in the French capital to fix a damaged wash basin.\n\nThe Egyptian workman said he took photos of the bathroom which he needed for his work.\n\nBut the princess was allegedly enraged to see her reflection captured in the mirror. The indictment said she called Mr Saidi who then beat and bound Mr Eid.\n\nImage copyright AFP/Getty Image caption The incident took place at a luxury apartment on Avenue Foch in Paris\n\nThe plumber said he was forced to kiss her feet and was not allowed to leave for several hours.\n\nAt one point the princess allegedly yelled: \"Kill him, the dog, he doesn't deserve to live.\"\n\nMr Saidi told the court in July he heard the princess cry for help and rushed in to see her and Mr Eid gripping the phone.\n\n\"I seized (him) and overpowered him, I didn't know what he was after,\" he said, and suggested the plumber wanted to sell the images. Taking photos of the princess is illegal under Saudi law.\n\nDefence lawyers had questioned why Mr Eid returned to the residence in the following days with a bill for 21,000 euros.\n\nWho is Princess Hassa?\n\nIn Saudi state media, Princess Hassa is hailed for her charity work and advocacy for women's rights.\n\nShe is reported to have left France shortly after the incident. The princess had been questioned about the allegations.\n\nA French judge issued an arrested warrant in March 2018, forcing her to stay in Saudi Arabia.\n\nHer lawyer reportedly said during the trial that she had offered to appear in court via Skype.\n\nYou may also be interested in:", "description": "The sister of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman received a 10-month suspended sentence.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/168CE/production/_108766329_040170212.jpg"}
