(Albert Gea/Reuters)\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday defended the company\u2019s policy of allowing political campaigns to run advertisements containing misleading or false information on their platform.\n\n\u201cPeople worry, and I worry deeply, too, about an erosion of truth,\u201d Zuckerberg told the Washington Post. \u201cAt the same time, I don\u2019t think people want to live in a world where you can only say things that tech companies decide are 100 percent true.\u201d\n\nFacebook has come under fire for approving an ad for President Trump\u2019s 2020 reelection campaign accusing rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter of corruption, a charge which which he has vigorously disputed. In response, Senator Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) released her own Facebook ad saying Zuckerberg supports Trump for reelection.\n\n\u201cIn general, in a democracy, I think that people should be able to hear for themselves what politicians are saying,\u201d Zuckerberg continued.\n\nIn a speech Thursday at Georgetown University, Zuckerberg also explained that Facebook and related platforms such as Instagram and Whatsapp don\u2019t operate in China due to censorship concerns.\n\n\u201cWhile our services like WhatsApp are used by protestors and activists everywhere,\u201d Zuckerberg said, \u201con TikTok, the Chinese app growing quickly around the world, mentions of these same protests are censored, even here in the U.S.\u201d\n\nFacebook has tried to make inroads into the Chinese market before, even developing a censorship tool for that purpose, according to a 2016 report from the New York Times. However, the efforts to bring the company to China were unsuccessful.\n\nZuckerberg is scheduled to testify next week at a congressional hearing on Facebook\u2019s business practices.\n\nWarren has called to break up Facebook and other big tech companies, writing on Medium, \u201cWe need to stop this generation of big tech companies from throwing around their political power to shape the rules in their favor.\u201d Zuckerberg has referred to Warren as an \u201cexistential\u201d threat to the company.\n\nSocial media companies including Facebook struggle with policies of free speech and censorship that differ from country to country. A European court recently ruled that European Union member nations can force Facebook to remove content from its platform world wide if that content is found to be illegal under one of those nations\u2019 laws.", "description": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday defended the company's policy of allowing political campaigns to run advertisements containing misleading or false information on their platform.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Jim Geraghty", "Kevin D.
