How can we tell? Dividend paying companies with growing earnings can be highly rewarding in the long term. Yet sometimes, investors buy a popular dividend stock because of its yield, and then lose money if the company's dividend doesn't live up to expectations.\n\nWith only a three-year payment history, and a 1.5% yield, investors probably think \u00d8rsted is not much of a dividend stock. A low dividend might not be a bad thing, if the company is reinvesting heavily and growing its sales and profits. Some simple research can reduce the risk of buying \u00d8rsted for its dividend - read on to learn more.\n\nExplore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on \u00d8rsted!\n\nCPSE:ORSTED Historical Dividend Yield, October 28th 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nDividends are usually paid out of company earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. So we need to form a view on if a company's dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. \u00d8rsted paid out 20% of its profit as dividends, over the trailing twelve month period. Given the low payout ratio, it is hard to envision the dividend coming under threat, barring a catastrophe.\n\nAnother important check we do is to see if the free cash flow generated is sufficient to pay the dividend. Unfortunately, while \u00d8rsted pays a dividend, it also reported negative free cash flow last year. While there may be a good reason for this, it's not ideal from a dividend perspective.\n\nWe update our data on \u00d8rsted every 24 hours, so you can always get our latest analysis of its financial health, here.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nFrom the perspective of an income investor who wants to earn dividends for many years, there is not much point buying a stock if its dividend is regularly cut or is not reliable. The company has been paying a stable dividend for a few years now, but we'd like to see more evidence of consistency over a longer period. During the past three-year period, the first annual payment was \u00f86.00 in 2016, compared to \u00f89.75 last year. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 18% a year over that time.\n\nWe're not overly excited about the relatively short history of dividend payments, however the dividend is growing at a nice rate and we might take a closer look.\n\nDividend Growth Potential\n\nDividend payments have been consistent over the past few years, but we should always check if earnings per share (EPS) are growing, as this will help maintain the purchasing power of the dividend. It's good to see \u00d8rsted has been growing its earnings per share at 162% a year over the past three years. The company is only paying out a fraction of its earnings as dividends, and in the past been able to use the retained earnings to grow its profits rapidly - an ideal combination.\n\nConclusion\n\nDividend investors should always want to know if a) a company's dividends are affordable, b) if there is a track record of consistent payments, and c) if the dividend is capable of growing. Firstly, the company has a conservative payout ratio, although we'd note that its cashflow in the past year was substantially lower than its reported profit. Next, earnings growth has been good, but unfortunately the company has not been paying dividends as long as we'd like. While we're not hugely bearish on it, overall we think there are potentially better dividend stocks than \u00d8rsted out there.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Is \u00d8rsted A/S (CPH:ORSTED) a good dividend stock?
