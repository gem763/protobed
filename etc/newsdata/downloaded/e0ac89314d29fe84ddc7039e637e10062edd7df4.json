I will need some time with the family, we need vacation, we need a break.\n\n\u2018Especially if I\u2019m playing the Olympics and all that. So I\u2019ll probably play the French, Halle, Wimbledon, the Olympics, maybe Cincinnati and then the US Open.\u2019\n\nFederer competed in Masters 1000 events in Madrid and Rome in order to tune up for Roland Garros in 2019, but it seems unlikely he will do the same next season.\n\nWinning a first Olympics singles gold will be no straightforward task for the 20-time Grand Slam champion, with world No. 1 Novak Djokovic \u2013 who tested conditions in Tokyo at the Japan Open, a tournament he won, a matter of weeks ago \u2013 making no secret of his desire to do the same, with former winners Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray both set to be in the field.\n\nMurray, who will target a third successive singles gold, may not, however, team up with his brother Jamie in Japan.\n\nMurray cast doubt over his Olympics chances (Picture: AFP via Getty)\n\nDoubles specialist Jamie has struck up a partnership with their compatriot Neal Skupski, which has begun to take decent shape after a slow start.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, he has played with his brother Andy at the past three Olympic Games, though the pair have only won one match at the three tournaments combined.\n\nAnd Andy, who takes on Uruguay\u2019s Pablo Cuevas in Antwerp later on Thursday, suggested they won\u2019t team up together in Toyko, while he won\u2019t be willing to offer his services to Great Britain captain Leon Smith for every doubles match at the Davis Cup in Madrid next month.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a done deal that we will play together,\u2019 said the older sibling, who on Thursday faces Pablo Cuevas in the European Open second round.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s been doing well with Neal and also if I played a match for example like I did with Alex de Minaur (their recent three-set marathon in China) where I\u2019m at right now there\u2019s no chance I\u2019m playing doubles after that.\n\n\u2018I would be useless. I was so tired at the end of that match. If I played a quick singles match and if I had a chance to eat and rest and recover then I\u2019d want to play, but it will depend on the situation. I won\u2019t be playing singles and doubles every day of the Davis Cup. Right now I\u2019m not in the right shape to be doing that.\u2019", "description": "Roger Federer will compete at the French Open in 2020 but Andy Murray cast doubt over his Olympics doubles participation.", "authors": ["George Bellshaw"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1180244682_1571310074.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
