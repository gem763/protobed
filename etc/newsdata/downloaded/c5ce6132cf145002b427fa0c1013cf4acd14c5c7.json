The town sheriff is attempting to round up a posse to track down Butch and Sundance, leaders of the Hole-In-The-Wall Gang, which has been robbing banks and trains with such impunity that they\u2019ve become an embarrassment for lawman across the frontier. Unbeknown to everyone, these celebrity outlaws are watching the scene unfold from a perch across the street, where they\u2019re blowing their loot on liquor and whores, but the sheriff\u2019s recruitment efforts were doomed to run aground regardless. There just isn\u2019t much appetite for going after an elusive and dangerous pair that seem to be generous in spreading their stolen loot around.\n\nThe Wild Bunch at 50: the enduring nihilism of Sam Peckinpah's western Read more\n\nThere is, however, time for a brazen salesman to make a pitch: \u201cThe horse is dead,\u201d he says. The future is bicycles.\n\nThe sequence everyone remembers from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid follows shortly afterwards, when Paul Newman, as Butch, pedals Katherine Ross\u2019s Etta Place around on the handlebars of a new bike, with the jaunty Oscar-winning song Raindrops Keep Fallin\u2019 on My Head playing in the background. It may not be accurate to called the film a \u201crevisionist western\u201d \u2013 a term reserved for less commercial visions like Monte Hellman\u2019s The Shooting, Robert Altman\u2019s McCabe & Mrs Miller, and Sam Peckinpah\u2019s The Wild Bunch, released the same year \u2013 but even before our heroes meet a hail of bullets in the final freeze-frame, the end of an era is nigh. It\u2019s no wonder Butch winds up chucking the bike into the woods later on.\n\nButch Cassidy was a box-office sensation when it premiered 50 years ago, more than doubling Midnight Cowboy and Easy Rider, which grossed $44.8m and $41.7m, respectively, against its colossal $102.3m. For perspective, only six films since have doubled up the competition since \u2013 three of them Star Wars movies (Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi); two of them Steven Spielberg movies (Jaws and ET); and the other Titanic. It\u2019s important to understand the film as a commercial juggernaut, first and foremost, because it\u2019s so plainly eager to turn a horse into a bicycle, reconfiguring the hidebound traditions of the western for a hipper, more self-aware audience.\n\nIn a William Goldman script peppered with memorable lines, the first exchange sets the tone. Butch looks around a bank at closing time, chatting with the security guard as he perhaps sizes up his next job.\n\n\u201cWhat happened to the old bank? It was beautiful.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople kept robbing it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a small price to pay for beauty.\u201d\n\nRight away, Goldman establishes Butch as a charismatic mouthpiece for the quip-ready screenwriter, contrasting nicely with the Sundance Kid, Robert Redford\u2019s taciturn sharpshooter. But he\u2019s also created two heroes who break the western mold, neither justice-seeking white-hats nor grizzled, sneering black-hats, and not as traditionally masculine as either party. Butch is a man who appreciates beauty and art, but doesn\u2019t have the stomach for violence; it\u2019s not until late in the film that we (and the Kid) discover that he\u2019s never shot a man before and he looks sickened to have to do it. He\u2019s a pleasure-seeker above all else: robbing banks and trains are his way to make an easy living and enjoy whatever sinful freedoms his vocation affords him.\n\nAudiences in 1969 were all too happy to embrace the light, quippy irreverence of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid after a turbulent summer, and Goldman, director George Roy Hill, and the two impossibly handsome stars made them feel cool for doing it. True Grit had performed well earlier in the year as a throwback to the genre\u2019s past, giving John Wayne a proper victory lap, but Butch Cassidy was thoroughly modern, a star-making vehicle for Newman and Redford that reflected a need for the genre to turn the page and that feels as much of its time as it does authentic to Wyoming in the late 1890s. With Ross at the center of a love triangle between friends, the film attempted to bring Jules and Jim to the American mainstream, taking a lesson from the French new wave on how to revivify old Hollywood craft.\n\nIt still works spectacularly well. There\u2019s an alchemy up and down the production: Jack Lemmon, Steve McQueen, and Warren Beatty all passed on playing the Sundance Kid, and none seem capable of the quiet confidence that Redford possesses in the role, which parries so well with Newman that the two would run it back again with Hill a few years later in The Sting. The pop doodling of Burt Bacharach\u2019s score is about as far from a traditional western score as possible, but it somehow meshes with the sepia sheen of Conrad Hall\u2019s photography, which burnishes the legend of these two men while their story is still being told. And while Goldman\u2019s screenplay dances on the edge of glib, it\u2019s lively and sophisticated, with a strong theme about the capitalist forces that really tamed the Wild West.\n\nButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is such a rollicking good time that it takes a while to notice it\u2019s about the end of the line for its heroes, whose celebrity is already widespread when the film opens and ultimately hastens their demise. \u201cYour times is over and you\u2019re gonna die bloody,\u201d warns a sheriff, prophetically, in an early scene, and the film is mostly about Butch and Sundance getting chased out of America by hired guns and dying at the hands of the Bolivian army. They\u2019re mostly guilty of stealing from the wrong guy: EH Harriman, the railroad tycoon, spends more trying to catch them than they rob from his safes, but it\u2019s an opportunity for a powerful man to send a message about who\u2019s really in charge. Guys like Butch and Sundance can handle local lawmen and half-hearted posses, but they can\u2019t fight progress. The EH Harrimans of the world will make certain of that.", "description": "The 1969 western paired Paul Newman and Robert Redford to magical effect and remains one of the most undeniably entertaining westerns to date", "authors": ["Scott Tobias"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2744ff27c8866af891c6184fd22b7c0b70addab7/0_140_3720_2232/master/3720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cbc590c5d9280846c21f7aa8ba198a57", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
