REUTERS/Francois Lenoir/File Photo\n\nBut Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar played down the prospects, saying the gap between Britain and the EU remained \u201cvery wide\u201d and he doubted Johnson could make the compromises needed to get a deal and have it ratified by UK lawmakers.\n\nWith just seven weeks until Britain is due to leave the EU, Johnson will travel to Luxembourg on Monday for his first meeting with Juncker as he seeks to reneogitate the exit deal his predecessor Theresa May reached with the bloc.\n\nJohnson says Britain will leave the EU on Oct. 31 whether or not he reaches a deal. But parliament passed a law last week over his objections ordering him to seek an extension if he fails to reach an agreement with the bloc.\n\n\u201cWe are working incredibly hard to get a deal. There is the rough shape of a deal to be done,\u201d Johnson said at a convention of local politicians in northern England, during which he was heckled by a protestor for a decision to suspend parliament for more than a month as the Brexit deadline rapidly approaches.\n\nDoubt over Brexit has created Britain\u2019s biggest political crisis in decades. Johnson\u2019s opponents say he has no real prospect of reaching an agreement with the EU on terms of Britain\u2019s exit from the bloc, and was instead steering the country on a course to crash out without an agreement.\n\nThe prime minister says he does want a deal but needs a credible threat to leave without one if he is to persuade the EU to compromise.\n\nJohnson said he would also be meeting with EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier on Monday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about the ideas that we have been working on, and we\u2019ll see where we get. I would say I\u2019m cautiously optimistic,\u201d he said.\n\nIncoming EU trade commissioner Phil Hogan on Friday also said he saw \u201csome cause for optimism\u201d about a breakthrough in negotiations, Irish broadcaster RTE reported.\n\nThe main disagreement has been over plans to guarantee the border in Ireland remains open, known as the \u201cbackstop\u201d.\n\nThe deal reached last year with Johnson\u2019s predecessor May would guarantee regulatory alignment between Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland to help keep goods flowing. But the British parliament rejected it three times, with both supporters and opponents of Brexit saying it would leave British territory subject to EU rules with no control over setting them.\n\nJohnson says the border backstop must be replaced to reach any deal. The EU says any replacement must have the same effect, and so far London has offered no proposals that are good enough.\n\nWIDE GAP\n\n\u201cWe always said we are willing to explore alternative arrangements ... But so far I think it is fair to say that what we are seeing falls very far short of what we need,\u201d Varadkar told Ireland\u2019s RTE radio in an interview.\n\n\u201cThe gap is very wide,\u201d he said. He later told another Irish broadcaster, Virgin Media News, that he was not sure Johnson would be able to make the compromises necessary.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson MP speaks to media after the DUP annual party conference in Belfast, Northern Ireland November 24, 2018. REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne/File Photo\n\nA report in the Times newspaper suggested Johnson could opt to tweak the backstop by having some EU rules apply only in Northern Ireland, not the rest of the United Kingdom. But Johnson\u2019s government\u2019s Northern Irish allies rejected the report, which suggested they might agree to such a move.\n\n\u201cWe will not accept a Northern Ireland-only backstop,\u201d Sammy Wilson, spokesman for the Democratic Unionists whose 10 lawmakers support Johnson\u2019s government, told BBC Radio Ulster. \u201cIt won\u2019t be a backstop by any other name either. We will not be accepting separate arrangements that cut us off from the UK.\u201d\n\nHe suggested that the Northern Ireland assembly would require an effective veto of any EU regulations, something the EU and Ireland have repeatedly rejected.", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Friday there was \"the rough shape of a deal to be done\" over Brexit, as he prepared to meet European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in a renewed push to reach an agreement.", "authors": ["Conor Humphries", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429401358&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C0UO", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
