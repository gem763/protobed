After the changeover the frequency became busy, meaning the controller was unable to change the heading of the F-15s.\n\n\u201cThe controller believed he would have plenty of time to change the heading of the F-15s when they came on frequency,\u201d the report said. \u201cHowever, the frequency became busy just as they transferred and so by the time the F-15 pilots checked in with the controller they were already about to fly over Chatteris.\u201d\n\nThe incident was classified in the second-highest danger category but the board was unable to establish how close the two pairs came to colliding. The pilots did not see the parachutists, the report said.\n\nThe board noted it was \u201cunfortunate\u201d that the air traffic controller at Lakenheath had not warned the pilots \u201cdue to the completion of the handover at a busy time\u201d. The controlled had not subsequently filed a report on the incident.\n\nA US air force representative had recently retired at short notice, leading to a gap in the advisory post during which time a report related to the incident was overlooked, the report said.\n\n\u201cA full-time liaison officer had been recruited and was due to be in post in the coming months; in the meantime, the post was being covered by other personnel,\u201d the board reported. \u201cDespite the lack of report, he was able to provide the board with details about the circumstances.\u201d\n\nThe American air force base at Lakenheath has rebriefed crews all of its crews to remind them of the need to avoid the parachuting site.\n\nOperators from Chatteris, home to several skydiving centres, call Lakenheath each morning to advise that they are active, and the board said there was \u201cvery little more that Chatteris could have done from an operational perspective to prevent the airprox\u201d.\n\nThe parachutists, who first reported the event before Airprox contacted the pilots of the US planes, had \u201cno control over their speed or direction while in freefall\u201d but could have opened their parachutes to slow their descent, the report added.", "description": "Airprox board says F-15 pilots inadvertently flew across Cambridgeshire parachute site", "authors": ["Mattha Busby"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63e3a20ff828d68944ff15eeb0329aa7836712b5/0_0_1770_1062/master/1770.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=128d412fbc371621ad7af7b51dbdfea9", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
