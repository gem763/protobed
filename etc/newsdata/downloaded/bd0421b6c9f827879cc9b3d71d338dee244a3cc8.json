CRM, +0.48% co-CEO Marc Benioff said that capitalism in America is under siege and could be dying because stakeholders want more than merely profits from their companies.\n\n\u201cIf the highest value [you anchor your company around] isn\u2019t trust, then every key stakeholder \u2014 your employees, your customers and your investors \u2014 will walk out,\u201d Benioff said during a fireside chat at TechCrunch on Thursday in San Francisco.\n\nComments from the founder of the giant cloud-computing and workforce-services company come as a number of high-profile investors and politicians have assailed capitalism, considered by some the most powerful source of economic and social advancement in human history.\n\nAngus Deaton, a 2015 Nobel laureate in economics and Princeton University professor, recently wrote that capitalism is \u201cvisibly sick,\u201d and that a push toward socialism or Democratic socialism, is growing in America.\n\n\u201cThe virus of socialism has re-emerged and is infecting the young once more,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHedge-fund billionaire Ray Dalio in recent reports, including on MarketWatch, has said that capitalism is no longer working for most Americans. However, the founder of Bridgewater Associates LP. recommends \u201curgent reform,\u201d rather than ditching it altogether.\n\nA widening gap between wealth Americans and those at or near poverty also has been a key driver for the philosophical push toward socialism. That is even as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.88% the S&P 500 SPX, +0.90% and the Nasdaq Composite COMP, +0.92% indexes have been climbing steadily since the 2008-09 financial crisis.", "description": "Salesforce.com Inc. co-CEO Marc Benioff said that capitalism in America is under siege and could be dying because stakeholders want more than merely profits...", "authors": ["Mark Decambre"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-FY906_CRM_11_ZG_20171122140435.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
