But, the app requests a massive amount of user data in order to operate. The app was announced on Thursday as a companion messaging app to image-sharing platform Instagram and lets you send messages and status updates only to people that have been designed as \u201cClose Friends\u201d on the platform.\n\nHowever, Threads asks for a significant amount of data from users showing that Facebook\u2019s desire to collect as much personal information as possible has not been deterred by its numerous privacy scandals in recent months. Business Insider found that Facebook\u2019s new Threads app requests:\n\nContinuous access to your location\n\nYour movement and fitness activity\n\nYour battery level\n\nWhether you\u2019re connected to WiFi or mobile data or not\n\nYour closest friends, per your Instagram \u201cClosest Friends\u201d list\n\nIf given access, Threads can collect a large amount of personal data that could be used to form an in-depth profile of users. It is unclear if such information could be used to inform Facebook\u2019s ad-targeting system. Facebook has attempted to rebrand itself as a \u201cprivacy-focused\u201d firm following its many data scandals such as the Cambridge Analytica scandal which left 80 million of the platform users\u2019 personal data vulnerable.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently defended the company\u2019s plans to encrypt its messaging services, making it so that the company would not have access to user\u2019s chat logs. But now, the United States, Britain, and Australia have signed an open letter requesting that the firm suspend these plans as it could have a negative effect on the fight against child exploitation and terrorism.\n\nSpeaking on a livestream during the company\u2019s weekly internal Q&A session, Zuckerberg announced he was aware this could be an issue and acknowledged that encryption would reduce the number of tools available to fight the problem. Zuckerberg stated: \u201cWhen we were deciding whether to go to end-to-end encryption across the different apps, this was one of the things that just weighed the most heavily on me.\u201d\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently defended the company\u2019s plans to encrypt its messaging services, making it so that the company would not have access to user\u2019s chat logs.

The app will state \u201cat the gym\u201d when it detects a user is working out or \u201d at the beach\u201d when a user is located close to the ocean.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
