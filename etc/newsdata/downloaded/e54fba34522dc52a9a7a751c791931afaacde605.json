He scored the best win of his career two months ago, a 10-round decision win over the Cuban boxer Luis Arias, and is back in action against a yet to be determined opponent on November 16 in Glasgow.\n\nHe became linked to McGregor shortly after footage emerged in August of the UFC fighter throwing a punch at an older man in the Marble Arch pub in Dublin. The man reportedly refused a shot of McGregor's Proper No. Twelve whiskey.\n\nMcGregor later told ESPN that he must get his \"head screwed on\" but before that grovelling apology, Keeler tweeted that it was \"sad to see McGregor stoop so low.\"\n\nRead more: Conor McGregor has finally realized the fight game has moved on without him\n\n\"[He] did the same to a friend of mine a couple of years ago, and he's still walking around acting the gangster,\" Keeler tweeted. \"I'd be happy to put him in his place if he had the balls to step in a ring again.\"\n\n@thenotoriousmma enough mouthing done settle in ring like men with respect and class if have the balls \ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc\ud83c\udf40 A post shared by Luke Keeler (@coolhandlukek) on Aug 17, 2019 at 8:39am PDT Aug 17, 2019 at 8:39am PDT\n\nDetails about the bullying are sparse, but speaking to Business Insider over coffee at the Colosseum Gym in Dublin, Keeler said it all began three to four years ago.\n\nKeeler's gymmate Davey Oliver Joyce, a featherweight who fights Leigh Wood in MTK Global's Golden Contract tournament at York Hall on Friday, told us \"he punched one of his mates,\" adding that: \"Luke is my mate. He called McGregor out and stood up to him \u2026 it was the right thing to do.\"\n\nHis friend and McGregor shook hands after, but Keeler said that the incident was one of a few around Dublin. \"I don't think he's in the right frame of mind,\" Keeler told us.\n\nIt was not long before McGregor called Keeler, getting his phone number from one of his Straight Blast Gym teammates who had sparred athletes at the Colosseum Gym.\n\n\"I put that tweet out calling him a bully, and he made a phone call to me, there was a bit of ranting and raving. I don't think he was in his right mind,\" Keeler said. \"I just says, 'We could have a fight, do you know what I mean?' It's obviously a payday.\"\n\nTalks took place, Keeler said. \"My management spoke with [his team] about making a fight happen.\"\n\nKeeler thinks he can lure McGregor into a fight next year\n\nMcGregor is one of several opportunities for Keeler. The 32-year-old is currently ranked as the world's no.3 middleweight with the World Boxing Organization (WBO) and says he has been in discussions with the slick, American southpaw Demetrius Andrade, the current WBO champion.\n\nFor Keeler, a title fight against Andrade could be used as leverage to entice McGregor into an all-Irish boxing world title fight in Dublin, next summer.\n\n\"There's talks,\" Keeler said. \"I think he's [Andrade] struggling for opponents.\"\n\nThe champion Demetrius Andrade.

A fight against Keeler, around St. Patrick's Day in Boston, New York, or Philadelphia, is what has been talked about, according to Keeler.\n\nThe Irishman's fight in November is, what he calls, a busy, no-risk fight so he can stay sharp while his team attempts to negotiate a world title fight shortly after.\n\n\"He's spoken about as this avoided guy \u2026 a twice world champion who is undefeated, but I see weaknesses and mistakes. He's not unbeatable,\" Keeler said of Andrade.\n\nKeeler would not be fazed by his southpaw stance or his slick skills, as he says he learned a lot sparring a similar fighter \u2014 the British super middleweight Billy Joe Saunders.\n\n\"I'd be going in as a huge underdog, but I'd be going in to take that belt,\" he said.\n\nKeeler says that if he upset the odds and beat Andrade as the underdog, he could push for middleweight world title unification fights against the division's other champions like Saul \"Canelo\" Alvarez.\n\nIt could also lead to McGregor.\n\n\"It will probably be announced before Christmas, [and if I beat Andrade] it opens the door to huge fights like Canelo. McGregor might get his head together, and that's a dream payday in Dublin. It sets up a huge 2020,\" he said.\n\nKeeler and his boxing trainer Peter Taylor.

You can win all the belts in the world, but you can't support your family with belts, you support your family with money.\n\n\"I'm more pleased when my lads come out of this financially secure and uninjured. If he fights Conor McGregor, he'll come out that match uninjured that's for sure, because he beats him easy and he'll be financially secure.\"\n\nRead more: A 22-year-old Irishman got his Conor McGregor moment in Dublin's raucous 3Arena, winning in 30 seconds\n\nSize matters. I'd have no worries about that fight [with McGregor] at all.\n\nTaylor said he's not even studied McGregor's style in his only boxing bout to date, his 10th round stoppage loss to Floyd Mayweather in 2017.\n\nThis is because he does not see it as an even contest.\n\n\"Luke's profession is boxing,\" Taylor said. \"Conor McGregor is not a professional boxer; he's an MMA fighter. If it was an MMA fight we'd be looking at it completely different. But it's in Luke's area, and he's comfortable.\n\n\"Conor wasn't comfortable with Floyd Mayweather, who was lighter than McGregor and a 40-year-old man. Luke is in his prime, and he's a lot bigger. Size matters. I'd have no worries about that fight at all.\"\n\nOn the Andrade challenge, Taylor said: \"Everyone has weaknesses. Andrade falls in with his shots. If we take the fight I'd be confident we can win it. He's technically very good, a southpaw. He'd overlook Luke and think it's an easy fight.\n\n\"Luke's improved, and there's more improvement to come. He's always training, trying to get better. He's intelligent. When he fights Andrade, everyone will get a shock. We're looking forward to the fight.\"\n\nIt is clear Keeler thinks Andrade could lead to McGregor \u2014 and he'd even meet the UFC fighter halfway, in a cage, with boxing rules.\n\nKeeler wants Conor McGregor to \"stay sober.\" Getty Images\n\n\"Yeah, of course, stand-up \u2014 if he wanted to do that as an event,\" Keeler said. \"But I think he needs to get himself fresh, fit; he's just a circus at the moment. It would be nice if he got a win in the UFC and if I win the world title, then it's attractive \u2026 put it in the cage, six-ounce gloves.\n\n\"In 2020, Canelo, McGregor \u2026 people might think it's far-fetched, but you have to think and speak these things. It was more far-fetched him speaking about Mayweather than it is me speaking about him. You never know.\"\n\nBeating Andrade and winning the world middleweight belt would raise Keeler's name in boxing, and though he'd use that as a platform to further pursue McGregor, he has challenged his rival to do a few things to ensure the bout happens.\n\n\"Hopefully he comes back, stays fresh, and stays sober,\" he said.", "description": "Luke Keeler says he is in negotiations for a world title fight and hopes to win so he can defend the championship against Conor McGregor, next summer.", "authors": ["Alan Dawson"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9475ceb513f4023306c8d0?width=1200&format=jpeg"}
