The throng in Parliament Square cheered the news of the vote. Hundreds of thousands of people had marched to make their voices heard as MPs, once again, deferred a decision on Brexit.\n\nIt was indeed an important victory for common sense and constitutionalism. The prime minister tried to bounce parliament into voting through a worse deal than that negotiated by his predecessor, but brave MPs stood their ground. Sir Oliver Letwin says he wants Britain to leave the European Union, but he and several of his former Conservative colleagues are rightly worried about the possibility of a no-deal Brexit.\n\nAs Sir Oliver said after the vote, he and those (including this title) who oppose the prime minister\u2019s deal must now part company, but before we do we should praise him and his colleagues for their public service. By passing the Benn Act, and yesterday\u2019s amendment, they have ensured that the disaster of a disorderly Brexit could not be inflicted on this country.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBut in our view \u2013 and in the view of the majority of those who marched yesterday \u2013 the damage that would be caused by Mr Johnson\u2019s hard Brexit deal could be almost as great as crashing out without a deal. That is why we have argued for the Brexit decision to be put back to the people in a Final Say referendum. And that argument is not over yet.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Say during a march in London EPA\n\nYesterday could have been the day that the Brexit question was finally decided \u2013 and if it had been, it would have been in favour of leaving the EU. That it was not is another victory of sorts, but these increasingly small steps forward cannot go on forever. If parliament cannot decide on Brexit, then the people must.\n\nWe do not know what will happen in the next few days or weeks. The vote yesterday suggested that a vote on the Brexit deal itself would be extremely close. That is why it was so important for the supporters of a Final Say to make their strength of feeling clear to MPs. If this Brexit deal is poised on a knife-edge in parliament, MPs should resolve it not by arm-twisting and deal-making, but by revisiting the original democratic mandate.\n\nNow, the choice is clear: Mr Johnson has negotiated a withdrawal agreement that provides clarity about what \u201cLeave\u201d means. The alternative would be to Remain, having considered all the options in exhausting detail over more than three years.\n\nThere is insufficient support among the people or in parliament for leaving without a deal, so a Final Say referendum could be a straight choice between the prime minister\u2019s deal and staying in the EU.\n\nIn the next few days, if the prime minister fails to get his deal through parliament, MPs must rule out any further delays and give the people a Final Say.", "description": "The House of Commons voted yesterday to \u201cwithhold approval\u201d of Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal.
