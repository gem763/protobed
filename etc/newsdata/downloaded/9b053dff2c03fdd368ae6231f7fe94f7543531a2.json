Or maybe you just want to avoid the choppy muddy sounds of a subpar speaker? No matter the case there are plenty of options. So, we narrowed it down to 11.\n\nWe tested everything. Simple and clean two speaker sets for browsing, big subwoofers for music, 5.1 surround sound systems for gaming and movies, and set ups with all sorts of smart functionality and extra features.\n\nThere is definitely something here for you.\n\nEdifier isn\u2019t exactly a household name but it has been consistently making great quality speakers of all sorts for years.\n\nThe R1280DB are the latest iteration of their mid-level 2.0 computer speakers that combine great design and build with a nicely rounded set of features and fantastic audio quality.\n\nThey\u2019re large speakers for their price but in return you get a powerful, rich sound that can easily fill a small living room. Digital and analogue connectivity can be found round the back and there\u2019s Bluetooth too.\n\nA convenient remote seals the deal. Also look out for the older R1280T, which lose the digital inputs and Bluetooth but cost less.\n\nBuy now\n\nAt this price, it should come as no surprise that the Creative A60 don\u2019t exactly set the world of computer audio alight.\n\nHowever, even a very basic pair of speakers such as these will provide an upgrade over the speakers in most laptops, or the built-in speakers in computer monitors.\n\nYou get more volume, more bass and a much better stereo image. The A60 offer just a single analogue audio input, power switch and volume control \u2013 but they sound decent, look smart and are a doddle to use.\n\nBuy now\n\nJust like the Creative A60, the Edifier R12U are the most basic of upgrades you can get for your computer. They\u2019ll sound a little louder and fuller than the speakers you get in most laptops or computer monitors and that\u2019s about it.\n\nHere, though, instead of a mains power connection like the A60, the R12U rely on a USB connection for power. This makes them more portable and more ideal for life on the road with a laptop.\n\nBuy now\n\nIf a simple, cheap set of speakers is all you require, but you don\u2019t want to compromise too much on quality and volume, the Creative T20s are the way to go.\n\nThis reasonably compact 2.0 set has a simple all-black style, with the option to expose the drivers or keep them protected with a fabric grille.\n\nThey produce a warm, full sound that, while it certainly won\u2019t knock your socks off with bass, is more than ample for close-up desktop listening. Detail can\u2019t compete with more expensive units, but compared to similarly priced systems with a sub-woofer, they\u2019re far better in this regard.\n\nBuy now\n\nSurround sound for home computers used to be all the rage a few years ago but its popularity has waned recently. Nonetheless, there are still options out there and the Logitech Z506 is a fine entry-level example.\n\nClarity from any of its five speakers isn\u2019t exactly breathtaking, but you can add real drama to games and movies thanks to its central and rear speakers and sub. Not one for audiophiles but potentially a cinephile\u2019s delight.\n\nBuy now\n\nIf powerful, thumping bass is high on your priority list \u2013 then a 2.1 system like the Logitech Z533 is the way to go.\n\nThis stylish set includes a hefty wired remote control that includes volume and bass controls, plus sockets for an aux input and headphones.\n\nThe system packs a real punch too, bringing bass-heavy music to life. The compromise here is clarity at the top end and mid-range, warmth is lacking compared to similarly priced 2.0 systems.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe Minirig 2 is a portable Bluetooth speaker with just a single driver in it, so it can\u2019t do stereo. However, it is the ultimate accompaniment to road warriors that want to get the best music from their laptop or phone while away.\n\nMeasuring just 4 x 3 inches and weighing just under 2lbs, this beautifully built aluminium cylinder produces an astonishingly powerful and pleasing sound that will easily fill a small hotel room with music.\n\nYou can hook it up either via Bluetooth or a 3.5mm jack cable and it\u2019ll last an astonishing 80 hours on one charge.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe Sonos One is a smart living room speaker that includes support for Amazon\u2019s Alexa voice-controlled assistant. You can speak to it and ask it to play your favorite tunes, answer a question and much more.\n\nThis can also fit in with Sonos\u2019 range of other wireless speakers, allowing you to control all the audio in your home from one spot. All that and it sounds fantastic too.\n\nYou don\u2019t get the stereo image of normal computer speakers, but if you just want a quality speaker mainly for music and to help you control your smart home, it\u2019s well worth a look.\n\nBuy now\n\nWhile you certainly can spend more on dedicated surround sound computer speakers, this is about the limit we\u2019d suggest going to before considering setting up a proper home theatre system with a dedicated AV receiver.\n\nHere you get a nice step up in all-round sound quality compared to cheaper units, plus you get digital inputs, an easy-to-use control interface and a remote.\n\nThere\u2019s loads of power too, so even those with a large room can enjoy the wonders of surround sound.\n\nBuy now\n\nBringing together a striking design, loads of power and superb clarity \u2013 the Edifier E235 are the ultimate 2.1 computer speakers.\n\nWith digital and analogue inputs as well as Bluetooth connectivity and a remote control, they\u2019re versatile and posses superb quality and will certainly be a bass-lover\u2019s delight.\n\nFor added convenience the sub-woofer is wireless too. Just make sure you\u2019ve got room for the massive sub and sizeable speakers.\n\nBuy now\n\nFor those serious about upping their computer audio game, professional-grade audio monitors like the Genelec 8010 are the way to go.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to buy two of them \u2013 with each having its own internal power supply and amp \u2013 and a proper audio interface to support their XLR inputs, but the leap in fidelity compared to anything else on this list is huge.\n\nAdd in a subwoofer and you\u2019re talking recording studio levels of power and detail.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe Verdict: Best computer speakers\n\nThe Creative T20 are a great first entry into decent-quality computer speakers for those on a budget while the Minirig 2 is our go-to for audio on the move. However, for their combination of style, sound quality and features the Edifier R1280DB is our pick of the best computer speakers.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
