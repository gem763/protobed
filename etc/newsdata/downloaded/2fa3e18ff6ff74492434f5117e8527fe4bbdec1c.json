More than that, I believe that if Steve were still alive, we would have combined our companies, or at least discussed the possibility very seriously.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Disney's focus on 'Star Wars' for its Netflix competitor shows it's not worried about fan fatigue, but experts say the franchise needs to reinvent itself to thrive\n\nJobs was a board member of The Walt Disney Company and majority shareholder of the animation studio Pixar, which Disney acquired in 2006.\n\nAn Apple-Disney merger would be \"the largest deal of all time,\" according to CNBC. Apple is worth more than $1 trillion and was the first company to ever reach that mark. Disney's market value is $246 billion.\n\nBut Jobs' feelings about Disney's culture could have made a merger difficult. Earlier in the excerpt, Iger reminisced about Jobs' frustrations with Disney.\n\n\"Among his many frustrations was a feeling that it was often too difficult to get anything done with Disney,\" Iger said. \"Every agreement needed to be vetted and analyzed to within an inch of its life, and that's not how he worked. I wanted him to understand that I didn't work that way, either, that I was empowered to make a call, and that I was eager to figure out this future together, and to do so quickly.\"\n\nBecause of that attitude, and other factors, Iger expected Jobs to react negatively when Iger proposed the idea of Disney buying Pixar. But he didn't.\n\n\"I waited for him to hang up or to erupt in laughter,\" Iger recalled. \"The quiet before his response seemed endless. Instead, he said, 'You know, that's not the craziest idea in the world.'\"\n\nJobs was ultimately satisfied with the Pixar merger, according to Iger.\n\nIn the excerpt, Iger recounted a conversation with Jobs close to the end of his life. \"Look what we did,\" Jobs said, according to Iger. \"We saved two companies.\"\n\n\"The Ride of a Lifetime: Lessons Learned from 15 Years as CEO of the Walt Disney Company\" will be released on September 23.", "description": "In an excerpt from his upcoming book, \"The Ride of a Lifetime,\" Disney CEO Bob Iger shared memories of his friendship with Apple cofounder Steve Jobs.", "authors": ["Travis Clark"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8293f62e22af04a055e739-960-480.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
