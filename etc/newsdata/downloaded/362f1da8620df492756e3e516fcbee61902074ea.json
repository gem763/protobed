Photo: Nicole Wilder\n\nTransparent didn\u2019t ask to end at this time, or under these conditions: four seasons into a groundbreaking run, with a standalone movie that feels more like a glorified epilogue and unfolds minus its main character, Maura Pfefferman, a onetime patriarch who had transitioned to become a woman. The show\u2019s two-time Emmy-winning star, Jeffrey Tambor, was pushed out in 2017 after being accused of sexually harassing two of his trans co-workers, an extra-dramatic development that cast a pall over the story (as well as that of another family saga featuring Tambor, Arrested Development). That Transparent had just finished its most ambitious and fully realized season \u2014 a ten-episode, time-tripping, theologically- and politically-infused account of the Pfeffermans\u2019 trip to Israel \u2014 only amplified the sense of cosmic unfairness. It\u2019s painful whenever a show calls it quits, by its own volition or the network\u2019s, but there\u2019s something uniquely painful about seeing a great one go out at the peak of its creative power, and against its will. But to paraphrase Al Swearengen \u2014 the main character of HBO\u2019s Deadwood, another prematurely cut-short drama that wrapped things up this year with a movie \u2014 if you want to hear God laugh, tell him (or her) your plans.\n\nIn that spirit, series creator Jill Soloway, who co-wrote and directed the 100-minute \u201cMusicale Finale,\u201d makes do with what they\u2019ve been given. The movie kills Maura off-camera via natural causes, then lets the aftermath unfold without once showing Tambor\u2019s face \u2014 a nonverbal statement on the scandal that lands with gut-punch force, like cutting a disgraced family member\u2019s face from photo albums. More strikingly \u2014 and quite Solowayian in its chutzpah \u2014 the script turns Transparent into a full-blown musical, complete with dance numbers. It\u2019s a move that doubles down on the series\u2019 already powerful Brechtian impulses, embedding a metafictional story-within-a-story that observes Maura\u2019s ex, Shelly (Judith Light), as she directs a madcap and cathartic stage musical about her family, casting a substitute Maura in the form of a weed dealer with a mellifluous voice (cabaret star Shakina Nayfack, Soloway\u2019s collaborator on the musical numbers).\n\nEarly reaction to the \u201cMusicale Finale\u201d has been mixed to negative. Some critics complained that the musical numbers introduced too drastic a change into the show\u2019s carefully developed aesthetic, and that the film\u2019s running time was too brief to do anything but check in with the other major characters \u2014 including Maura\u2019s best friend, Davina (Alexandra Billings), and Shelly\u2019s three kids: Ali, who now goes by Ari (Gaby Hoffman), Sarah (Amy Landecker), and Josh (Jay Duplass) \u2014 and offer them scraps of hope and closure. It\u2019s definitely a bittersweet, sometimes frustrating, occasionally surreal experience. Shelly stages a Dr. Phil-meets-South Park number titled \u201cYour Boundary Is My Trigger,\u201d chastising her kids for denying access to their feelings. The main cast bands together for the climactic \u201cJoyocaust,\u201d a summation of the series\u2019 thoughts on Judaism, genocide, survival, and hope that flirts with kitsch, then marries it. It is amazing in the best and worst way; they could\u2019ve brought in Mel Brooks to introduce it.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: Whatever one might think of the concept of this wrap-up film, or the relative success or failure of its musical numbers and non-musical scenes, its existence is the ultimate expression of everything Transparent has been about.\n\nBeyond its cultural specifics, this is a series about people trying to be happy. Unfortunately, decisions made in the name of happiness tend to make others unhappy, especially when they upend the status quo and force people to question whatever they thought they knew. It doesn\u2019t matter whether unhappy reactions seem logical or irrational from afar. People\u2019s feelings are real even when they\u2019re caused by misunderstandings, social conditioning, and fear. Being an adult means accepting that life is messy, unfair, and closure-proof, and that eventually everyone gets to spend time in the abyss.\n\nTransparent gets it. The show is kicked off with a father coming out to his adult children, and eventually to the rest of society, as a lifelong cross-dresser, then deciding to transition biologically. Most of season one was built around the reactions of Ari, Josh, Sarah, and Shelly to Maura\u2019s bombshell (the kids rechristened her Moppa, a nickname that stuck till she insisted on Maura). Josh handled the news the worst of Maura\u2019s three children, but in time he came around. The show was always conscious of his (and other characters\u2019) tangled psychological reasons for resisting change in other people, as well as the primordial realities of existence: Because we rarely get to choose our fates, self-determination comes down to figuring ourselves out as best we can, and making the best of whatever we\u2019ve been given.\n\nWe saw this dynamic play out time and again, not just in Maura\u2019s arc, but in the stories of the other characters. Ari identified as straight, then lesbian, then non-binary, and in season four, insisted that their family respect their less-than-reverent feelings about Israeli politics. Sarah kept leaving and returning to her husband, Len (Rob Heubel), variously identifying as lesbian, bisexual, and polyamorous, and pissing off Rob and her other partners \u2014 in particular her college flame, Tammy Cashman (Melora Walters), whom Sarah wooed away from a straight marriage, then jilted. Somehow every major character had to learn how to be genuinely okay with everyone else\u2019s issues, their perpetual state of developmental flux, as well as the larger truth that, as Mel Brooks once put it, \u201cTragedy is when I cut my finger. Comedy is when you fall into an open sewer and die.\u201d As in life, every character on Transparent is the star of the film unspooling in their mind. It takes a Herculean effort to get beyond their myopia and appreciate that other people are contradictory and infuriating and worthy of love, too. \u201cI am a beautiful soul,\u201d screams Tammy, drunkenly barging into Josh\u2019s party after being jilted by Sarah and chucking their leftover wedding cake into the pool. \u201cAnd you are all monsters!\u201d\n\nWhat bolder way to express all these complexities than by transforming the show itself?\n\nThis is the same Transparent, yet it isn\u2019t. Its spirit is the same, but it looks and moves differently and (literally) has a different voice. It\u2019s a work-in-progress arriving at the tail-end of the series\u2019 run. It\u2019s a musical made by people who haven\u2019t made any other musicals. They have the right idea, but there are necessarily some awkward steps and flat notes and songs that don\u2019t quite land the way the series wants them to. It hasn\u2019t figured everything out yet. But why should we expect it to? Transparent only just formally arrived at this new stage of its aesthetic evolution. \u201cMusicale Finale\u201d turns us all into the Pfefferman children, going over to dad\u2019s house for the zillionth time and realizing the old nouns and pronouns no longer apply. It almost feels like a test, which reveals whether we truly absorbed what this show was about.\n\nWe queue up Transparent to discover that the role of Tambor has been effectively recast, and that we are just going to have to accept this new person as the same person, representing the same basic personality and the same virtues and flaws. True to the show, and to our own experience, we reencounter someone we knew and loved, only to find that their presentation and energy have changed. Do we reject them because they aren\u2019t what we\u2019d grown accustomed to?\n\nThe film\u2019s stylistic gambits also draw out elements that floated under the surface during Transparent\u2019s regular run. The effect on the viewer is similar to those silent, sepia-tinted flashbacks in Deadwood: The Movie that revisited important events in seasons one through three. Whenever we saw those flash-cuts, it was as if the town itself was suffering from PTSD. Taken together, they asserted that the town of Deadwood itself, not any single person, was always the main character: the phrase \u201cbody politic\u201d was made tangible. The finale of Transparent doesn\u2019t have any flashbacks, but the musical numbers play out in a similarly revelatory way, suggesting that perhaps it was always a musical, but for various reasons, it never went all the way there. From Ari and Josh trading Jim Croce lyrics in the pilot, to Josh spontaneously grabbing his guitar and performing at a roadside coffeeshop for his then-girlfriend Shea (Trace Lysette), to the entire family bonding in Israel (and back home in Los Angeles) by singing songs from Jesus Christ Superstar, Transparent\u2019s musical moments always arrived when the characters felt at their happiest, their most ecstatically free. In a way, it\u2019s as if the series always had a song in its heart.", "description": "The Transparent musical finale is not how the show wanted to go out.
