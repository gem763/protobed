This, as they ended their search without finding anyone who was missing still alive from the Labor Day tragedy off the Southern California coast.\n\nIt\u2019s not known what started the fire.\n\nROB LOWE ON CALIFORNIA BOAT FIRE: 'AN UNSPEAKABLE HORROR ON A BOAT I\u2019VE BEEN ON MANY TIMES'\n\nNational Transportation Safety Board member Jennifer Homendy said Tuesday that she was \u201c100 percent confident\u201d investigators would find the cause of the fire aboard the Conception, which caught fire before dawn Monday and sank near Santa Cruz Island.\n\nShe also said the NTSB planned to stay at the scene for up to 10 days and would look into safety measures aboard the boat, such as whether it had fire extinguishers, and will interview survivors, first responders, divers and others.\n\nThe captain and four crew members awake on the upper decks jumped off the front of the vessel, swam to an inflatable boat at the back and steered it to a ship anchored nearby.\n\nAmong those believed to be dead are five members of one family and the marine biologist leading the diving tour.\n\nDNA will be needed to identify all the victims, and authorities will be using the same rapid analysis tool that identified victims of the deadly wildfire that devastated the Northern California town of Paradise last year, the sheriff said.\n\nOfficials have not released any victims\u2019 names, but Brown said he had heard anecdotally that they ranged from teenagers to people in their 60s. He said most appear to have been from Northern California, including Santa Cruz, San Jose and the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nThe 75-foot Conception was on the last day of a three-day excursion to the chain of rugged, windswept isles that form Channel Islands National Park in the Pacific Ocean west of Los Angeles. The fire broke out shortly after 3 a.m. Monday as the boat sat anchored in Platt\u2019s Harbor off Santa Cruz Island.\n\nThe sheriff said all 34 victims were trapped on the boat\u2019s lower deck when flames quickly blocked both a narrow stairway and an escape hatch leading to the upper decks.\n\n\u201cThe one crew member who was not rescued appears to have been asleep in the sleeping area down below with the passengers,\u201d Brown said.\n\nIt appears the crew sent multiple mayday calls, including one from the Conception in which a crew member could be heard saying he couldn\u2019t breathe.\n\nA later one came from the fishing vessel the Grape Escape after the crew reached it in their small boat. One of the vessel\u2019s owners said he heard explosions as he watched the Conception go up in flames from about 100 yards away. Brown said the blasts could have been exploding scuba tanks or propane tanks.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Conception, based in Santa Barbara Harbor, was owned by Santa Barbara-based Truth Aquatics, founded in 1974. A memorial at the harbor has quickly grown as mourners come to pay their respects.\n\nCoast Guard records show the boat\u2019s owners quickly addressed all safety violations from the last five years.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Flames roared through a boat of sleeping scuba divers so quickly that it appears none of the 34 people below deck could escape, authorities said Tuesday as they ended their search without finding anyone who was missing still alive from the Labor Day tragedy off the Southern California coast.", "authors": ["Frank Miles", "Frank Miles Is A Reporter", "Editor Covering Geopolitics", "Military", "Crime", "Technology", "Sports For Foxnews.Com.
