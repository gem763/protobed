REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/File Picture\n\nThe United Nations estimates 10.3 million people - almost half the country\u2019s population - are in need and some 41 percent of North Koreans are undernourished, while Pyongyang said in February it was facing a food shortfall this year and had to halve rations, blaming drought, floods and sanctions.\n\n\u201cU.N. supported programs failed to bring the results as desired due to the politicization of U.N. assistance by hostile forces,\u201d Kim Chang Min, secretary general for North Korea\u2019s National Coordinating Committee for the United Nations, wrote to the top U.N. official posted in the country.\n\nIn the Aug. 21 letter, Kim said the number of international staff should be cut by the end of the year.\n\nNorth Korea wants the number of international staff with the U.N. Development Programme to be cut to one or two from six, the World Health Organization to four from six and the U.N. Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) to cut its 13 staff by one or two.\n\nKim said the number of international staff with the World Food Programme should be reduced \u201caccording to the amount of food aid to be provided\u201d once the agency and North Korean agree how to implement a plan for 2019 to 2021.\n\nThere was also no need for a humanitarian aid coordination officer, Kim wrote, adding that U.N. aid officials could instead \u201cvisit as and when required.\u201d\n\n\u201cHistorically there\u2019s been a critical lack of international expertise and oversight and capacity to monitor the use of the assistance that is provided,\u201d said a U.N. diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re deeply surprised by this turn of events in part because this is when the needs have grown and the U.N. has been trying to mobilise support to scale up assistance in country,\u201d the diplomat said.\n\nThe move comes amid stalled talks between the United States and North Korea aimed at dismantling Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear and missile programs. The U.N. Security Council has unanimously ratcheted up sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to choke funding for those programs.\n\n\u201cThe North Korean government\u2019s decisions are only hurting the North Korean people,\u201d said a second U.N. diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\n\u201cThis is coming at a time where both Russia and China are pushing a false narrative that sanctions are causing the humanitarian problems in North Korea and the only way to solve that is to give North Korea sanctions relief,\u201d the diplomat said.\n\nRussia\u2019s U.N. ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, told reporters on Tuesday that unilateral sanctions imposed on North Korea by other countries and some strict interpretations of U.N. sanctions were hindering humanitarian work.\n\n\u201cThe population of North Korea should not suffer under those sanctions that have been imposed illegitimately,\u201d he said.", "description": "North Korea has told the United Nations to cut the number of international staff it deploys in the country because the world body's programs have failed \"due to the politicization of U.N. assistance by hostile forces,\" according to a letter seen by Reuters on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Michelle Nichols", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190905&t=2&i=1426340367&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8400H"}
