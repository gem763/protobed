Here\u2019s what their language says about their presidencies.", "language": "en", "text": "I first discovered presidential lexicons run the world after joining the National Security Council staff in early 2016. In the Obama administration, sports analogies dominated White House speech from the Oval Office on down. This reflected the hard-work ethos: President Barack Obama reminded us that our job was to \u201cleave it all on the field.\u201d On the NSC staff, we were taking our turn as stewards of U.S. foreign policy, running \u201cthrough the tape\u201d until we could \u201cpass that baton\u201d to the next administration. And though it was late in Obama\u2019s second term, he often reminded us: \u201cBig things happen late in the fourth quarter.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAll the sports talk didn\u2019t just reflect the high adrenaline. It also mirrored a particular vision of ourselves as public servants: teammates with a shared mission. Our job was to \u201cmove the ball down the field\u201d toward solving big, complex problems \u2014 sometimes, problems so complex we needed to plot out the first 10 \u201cplays.\u201d\n\nAdmittedly, progress was often incremental: The president framed our goals in terms of hitting singles, doubles and the occasional home run. But we were reminded that \u201chard things are hard,\u201d and when tackling hard things such as climate change or terrorism, incremental progress worked.\n\nAbove all, we spoke in terms of opportunities. NSC staffers inevitably had to respond to unforeseen crises every day, but our leadership urged us to stay focused on what we, in Obama-speak, called our \u201caffirmative agenda\u201d \u2014 and to put \u201cpoints on the board\u201d to achieve it. Someone passed out stickers exhorting us to \u201cFIGHT CYNICISM\u201d and \u201cUNLOCK THE IMPOSSIBLE.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter the 2016 election, I stayed on at the National Security Council. As my new leadership arrived in early 2017, I tried to take on a fresh vernacular to resonate with the new businessman in chief. I couched policy recommendations in terms of \u201cgood deal\u201d or \u201cbad deal.\u201d I injected \u201creturn on investment\u201d and \u201cburden sharing\u201d into my memos.\n\nBut I struggled to figure out the overarching objectives of the Trump team lexicon. What \u201caffirmative agenda\u201d was all this haggling meant to advance? Sure, \u201cAmerica First\u201d was our new motto \u2014 but that didn\u2019t provide specific guidance on tackling most national security dilemmas. Some officials tried to develop the slogans into a broader articulation of Trump foreign policy. But we all knew that one predawn presidential tweet could upend any carefully crafted policy message.\n\nFor months, I tried to explain to colleagues elsewhere in government what, exactly, the NSC position on a Middle Eastern country was. They complained that the White House\u2019s statements kept changing, and I couldn\u2019t argue. So I finally took to parroting President Trump\u2019s own preferred response: \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d And when the president directly contradicted his team on myriad issues, I stopped pretending this was all a coherent messaging strategy. I copied his official spokespeople: \u201cI will let the president speak for himself.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI finally stumbled upon three key realizations about language in the Trump administration: First, getting the words right didn\u2019t matter. The precise phrase to explain a U.S. policy position didn\u2019t matter. Perfect talking points for the president\u2019s conversations with foreign leaders really didn\u2019t matter, because he wouldn\u2019t use them anyway. In fact, the lack of clarity often let the president claim his words were misconstrued. The lack of clarity was the point.\n\nSecond, we had shifted from the language of opportunity to a language of threats. I filed away my \u201cUNLOCK THE IMPOSSIBLE\u201d stickers and adjusted to \u201cprotect our sovereignty\u201d in an \u201cextraordinarily dangerous world.\u201d\n\nAnd third, unlike the sports-team lexicon of the Obama White House, there was no longer a \u201cteam\u201d at all. In the Trump administration, national security priorities were indistinguishable from personal interests.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLast week, Trump\u2019s remarks about the whistleblower hit all these familiar notes of personal vendetta and vagueness: \u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? With spies and treason, right? We used to handle them a little differently than we do now.\u201d\n\nToday, I wonder what lexicon Americans want their president to embrace when he speaks to the world. Do they want a quarterback trying to move the ball down the field? Or are they gratified by a leader speaking in menacing innuendo? And finally: If the White House\u2019s words have lost their meaning, does anyone care?\n\nIn coming months, as the president says, we\u2019ll see what happens.\n\nRead more:\n\nMichael McFaul: Here\u2019s what a presidential phone call with a foreign leader looks like in a normal White House\n\nMax Boot: The rough transcript is devastating.
