after they were stolen in a burglary at John Lewis in Milton Keynes, in July 2017.\n\nShe admitted money laundering by allowing \u00a346,000 cash to be deposited into her bank account that was also used to pay finance on Bullock's \u00a39,600 Rolex watch and a Porsche Cayenne.\n\n(Image: Leicester Mercury/BPM Media)\n\nThe stolen goods were seized from their home along with a VW Golf and five motorbikes.\n\nMiss Silver said designer shoes, clothing and several thousands of pounds in cash were found during two police searches, along with Ingram's store tag removal devices.\n\nShe said: \"There was significant evidence of high living and expenditure.\n\n\"Miss Ingram enjoyed a high standard of living with little or no income to speak of.\"\n\nThe day after appearing at Leicester Crown Court to have the drugs case adjourned for trial, Ingram went on a shoplifting spree in Aylesbury, where she was caught with three females, laden with \u00a34,000 of stolen goods.\n\nShe admitted handling in relation to that, as well as shoplifting hundreds of pounds of goods from Next stores in Nottinghamshire and Mothercare in Leicester, between October 2017 and February 2018.\n\nShe also admitted converting criminal property, stolen wares she sold from her tanning shop, between January 2016 and July 2-17.\n\nRecorder Dominic Nolan QC told Ingram: \"Your offending was done cynically for monetary gain to fund the luxurious and glamorous lifestyle you wanted to live.\n\n\"I have seen the evidence of expensive foreign trips to the United States, France and the Netherlands, a skiing trip to Chamonix, a helicopter trip in New York, a shower of Christmas gifts and a trip to Lapland for the children, a house full of designer clothes and goods, expensive stays in hotels and spas, champagne, cocktails and fine dining - many of these events photographed on your phone to show off to your friends.\n\n\"Honest citizens working hard for modest wages suffer when people like you conduct criminal enterprises fuelled by vanity and greed.\"\n\nRecorder Nolan said Ingram had been offering the Mulberry handbags to friends at just over half price: \"cynically seeking to carve yourself a profit from the theft.\"\n\nIngram's defence barrister, Claire Fraser, said the defendant met Luca Bullock - who is serving a six-year sentence for the handbag conspiracy offence and other unrelated offences - when she was a schoolgirl.\n\nMiss Fraser said it was at times an abusive relationship and Ingram \"thought she had no choice but to do what was demanded.\"\n\nShe said it was Bullock who sourced the stolen handbags and asked her to sell them.\n\nReferencing the couple's \"high living\" she said Bullock had received a large compensation payment in relation to a traffic accident.\n\nSmith's barrister, Beth Crocker, said he agreed to falsely admit the cannabis found in Ingram's garden was his - in order to pay off a \u00a31,500 drugs debt.\n\nHe said he hard-working dad-of-three hadn't been in trouble for years and had no idea of the amount or value involved and had faced being sentenced for a crime he did not commit.\n\nIngram was jailed for two years, and her valuables and assets may be seized.\n\nSmith was given a 12 month jail sentence, suspended for two years, with 120 hours of unpaid work and a 20 day rehabilitation activity requirement.", "description": "Sophie Louise Ingram, 29, of Braunstone, Leicester, traded in stolen Mulberry handbags and was caught with a kilogram of cannabis in her garden", "authors": ["Suzy Gibson", "Image", "Leicester Mercury Bpm Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20650276.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_LEI_Sophie-Ingram-01.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
