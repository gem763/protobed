Please, behold this glorious hippo couch, painstakingly crafted out of the finest of fake leathers:\n\nSure, uh, the thing costs $95,000, but that is a small price to pay for such a striking centerpiece for your new, grown-up home, right?\n\nBesides, look at everything that nearly six-figure sum buys you: Life-like hippo skin! A strangely scrotal snout! A pair of terrifying gray eyes that definitely will not haunt you, late into the night, when you realize you spent more than a downpayment on a home to buy a hippopotamus sofa! And, amazingly, you can sit on it, too\u2014albeit extremely upright and presumably not at all comfortably.\n\n\"Unlike the aggressive, unpredictable nature of the hippopotamus, this sofa provides a reliable place to read or entertain guests,\" the Hammacher Schlemmer description reads, \"while paying tribute to the animal ancient cultures revered for its intrepidity, tenacity, and bravery.\"\n\nWelcome to your future. Welcome to adulthood. Welcome to going into massive amounts of debt to own some furniture that looks like a sub-Saharan animal!", "description": "It's time to grow up.
