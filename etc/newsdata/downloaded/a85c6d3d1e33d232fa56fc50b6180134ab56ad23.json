The Mole needs to be at least 7 feet (2 metres) deep before it can take useful measurements.\n\nInvestigating, operators at the German Aerospace Center \u2014 who provided the digging instrument \u2014 ruled out the initial hypothesis that the Mole had struck a rock.\n\nInstead, they believe that the nature of the soil itself surrounding the Mole was preventing the device from moving deeper into the Martian surface.\n\nTo push its way into the soil, the Mole relies on there being sufficient friction between itself and the sides of the hole it has digging \u2014 without such, the probe cannot gain enough purchase to hammer itself down further.\n\nIn theory, as the instrument digs, soil should tumble into the hole surrounding the mole, thereby providing the necessary friction to press on deeper.\n\nThe probe \u2014 dubbed 'the Mole' \u2014 began hammering its way into the soil of the Red Planet in March, but after digging a few inches it found itself unable to go deeper\n\nExperts believe that the probe \u2014 depicted here in a cross-section \u2014 encountered an unexpected layer of cemented soil that wasn't falling into the hole the device had dug\n\nAccording to the scientists, however, the Mole has likely encountered an unusually cemented type of soil \u2014 dubbed 'duricrust' \u2014 that engineers had not expected the probe to encounter on Mars.\n\nThe duricrust is not falling into the hole dug by the mole, leaving the probe to judder up and down as it fails to get the purchase needed to push deeper.\n\nExperts believe that the duricrust \u2014 which is hidden from sight by a layer of loose surface material \u2014 is around 2\u20134 inches (5\u201310 centimetres) thick.\n\nAfter first trying to compact the surrounding soil with the instrument arm on-board the InSight lander, pictured in this artist's impression, engineers tried pushing the mole sideways\n\nWhen the probe reaches a depth of around 16 feet (5 metres), it will begin taking temperature measurements to help scientists better understand Mars' interior\n\nTo get the Mole moving, the engineers first tried pushing down on the soil around the probe using the scoop on the end of the InSight lander's instrument arm.\n\nThey hoped that this would compact the soil around the Mole to give it purchase.\n\nThis approach proved unsuccessful, however, as the location of the Mole's hole lay at the furthest extent of the instrument arm's reach, limiting the amount of force the arm was able to apply to the soil.\n\nNext, the team removed the mole's support structure, allowing the instrument arm access to instead apply pressure to the mole sideways, forcing it up against the edge of the hole it had dug.\n\nAccording to the NASA Insight Twitter feed, this approach appears \u2014 at least provisionally \u2014 to have worked, with the Mole once again digging its hole.", "description": "The Mole was supposed to hammer its way 16.4 feet (5 metres) beneath the Red Planet's surface to take temperature measurements, but became stuck shortly after it began digging.", "authors": ["Ian Randall For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/11/19783732-0-image-a-29_1571223086055.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
