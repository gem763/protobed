It is owned by Europe\u2019s richest man, Bernard Arnault.\n\nTiffany, which featured in the 1961 film Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s starring Audrey Hepburn, was founded in New York in 1837 by 25-year-old Charles Lewis Tiffany and his friend John B Young, who opened a stationery and \u201cfancy goods\u201d emporium on Broadway.\n\nAnalysts at Jefferies said: \u201cIf a bid at this level, or indeed higher, was confirmed, it would be the largest M&A [mergers & acquisition] transaction to date for LVMH but one it could comfortably afford.\u201d\n\nThey noted that in 2011, LVMH approached and acquired Bulgari in a similar manner, over the weekend. Alessandro Bogliolo, the chief executive of Tiffany, who is trying to reinvigorate the brand, was chief operating officer of Bulgari at the time of the bid before exiting the following year.\n\nThe deal would bolster LVMH\u2019s hard luxury division, which includes Bulgari jewellery, Hublot and Tag Heuer watches. This will allow it to compete better with Swiss rival Richemont, which focuses on watches and jewellery.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "French conglomerate has held preliminary discussions with US jeweller", "authors": ["Julia Kollewe"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9bd3885a86ad9db70b854cf9cb433b0a7157c10/218_348_3024_1815/master/3024.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f73532270f58b1398b5bd33a7cc2680a", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
