A majority in every surveyed nation but Sweden agree with this sentiment. Another two-thirds feel that politicians and political parties don\u2019t care about \u201cpeople like them\u201d while 54% agree their country\u2019s society \u201cis broken.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not as bad as it used to be, though. The belief of failing societies worldwide has dropped by 4 percentage points since a similar poll was conducted three years ago; it has fallen in the U.S. by 6 percentage points in that time. So there\u2019s that.\n\n\u201cPopulist sentiment is widespread: 64% say their country needs a strong leader to take it back from the rich and powerful,\u201d the poll said, while another 62% say the \u201cculturally elite\u201d experts within their borders don\u2019t understand the lives of everyday people.\n\nOpen borders and immigration appear to be a hard sell just about everywhere these days.\n\n\u201cOnly 15% of adults globally agree that their country \u2018would be better off if we let in all immigrants who wanted to come here.\u2019 This proportion has barely changed between 2016 and 2019 (up just 1 point) and no country records an increase or a drop of more than 5 points. An outright majority of adults in 24 of the 27 countries surveyed disagree with this opinion,\u201d the poll said.\n\nFind more numbers in the Poll du Jour at column\u2019s end.\n\n50 THINGS YOU MUST KNOW\n\nIt is not your imagination. Lots of viable news simply does not get reported. Certain topics have been selectively edged off the public radar by the liberal elite, activists, radical professors, the news media, politicians and others who seek to control culture and politics.\n\nJust in time to chronicle this phenomenon: \u201c50 Things They Don\u2019t Want You to Know,\u201d a new book by Jerome Hudson, entertainment editor of Breitbart.com.\n\nHe provides clear examples of those things you should know, chapter by chapter: \u201cAmerica\u2019s most deadly and dangerous cities are run by Democrats,\u201d \u201cThe U.S. settled more refugees in 2018 than any other nation,\u201d \u201cDrug overdoses kill more Americans than gun violence,\u201d \u201cAmazon paid $0 on $11.2 billion in profits in 2018\u201d and \u201cHillary and Bill Clinton made millions and Russia got 20% of all U.S. uranium.\u201d\n\nThere are 45 more matters to consider in the book, on subjects ranging from racial strife to defense, education, abortion and much more. Mr. Hudson gives an explanation for each topic with facts, figures and meticulous footnotes so you know the exact sources.\n\n\u201cOn each issue we see elites weaponizing emotions at the expense of facts and data that don\u2019t yield the politically correct conclusions they desire. This must stop,\u201d writes Mr. Hudson.\n\nThe publisher is Broadside Books, the conservative imprint of HarperCollins. The book arrives next week.\n\nWHAT ELIZABETH WARREN USED TO KNOW\n\nThe great neutralizing power of the campaign trail has emerged \u2014 and it could influence the trajectory of one Massachusetts Democratic senator and her quest for the White House.\n\n\u201cElizabeth Warren used to be more interesting. Her ascent in the Democratic presidential campaign is the oft-told tale of a politician becoming boring, telling voters what they want to hear and disguising it as something else. Yet she may be making a classic political blunder,\u201d writes Warren Henry, a senior contributor to The Federalist.\n\nMs. Warren also does not have the calm and collected demeanor or the rhetorical ability of former Presidents Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama to counter the boring factor, Mr. Henry points out.\n\n\u201cWarren lacks the skills of a Reagan or Obama. And so far, it does not appear that America will be in an economic or international crisis in 2020. In such an environment, Warren starts to look like a textbook example of winning the primary to lose the general. The ghost of Elizabeth Warren past would have a better shot at victory,\u201d the columnist concludes.\n\nWHAT COLLEGE STUDENTS DON\u2019T KNOW\n\nOne organization which champions an increase of college-level civic education offers a new survey to make their point. It reveals the \u201calarming\u201d things that the 1,002 respondents actually believe, due to faulty academics.\n\nThe American Council of Trustees and Alumni\u2019s poll of these college graduates reveals that 26% of them believe Brett M. Kavanaugh is the chief justice of the Supreme Court, while 14% of respondents selected Antonin Scalia, who died in 2016. Fewer than half correctly identified John G. Roberts Jr.\n\nMeanwhile, 18% of the respondents agreed that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is the author of the New Deal, a suite of public programs enacted by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1930s. The New York Democrat, of course, introduced the Green New Deal earlier this year.\n\nMeanwhile, two-thirds of the respondents also do not know how long U.S. lawmakers serve in office.\n\nThe organization blames such misinformation on the \u201csteady deterioration\u201d of the U.S. college curriculum.\n\n\u201cWhen American history and government courses are removed, you begin to see disheartening survey responses like these, and America\u2019s experiment in self-government begins to slip from our grasp,\u201d says Michael Poliakoff, president of the nonprofit group \u2014 who adds that just 18% of colleges now require students to take courses in the U.S. government or American history.\n\nPOLL DU JOUR\n\n\u2022 66% of the world\u2019s population agree that traditional politics \u201cignore people like me.\u201d\n\n\u2022 60% say their nation is not better off accepting all immigrants.\n\n\u2022 60% say employers should favor native citizens \u201cwhen jobs are scarce\u201d in their country.\n\n\u2022 54% agree their country\u2019s society is \u201cbroken.\u201d\n\n\u2022 49% want a \u201cstrong leader\u201d willing to break rules to fix the country.\n\n\u2022 43% agree that immigrants take social services away from native citizens.\n\nSource: An IPSOS/Global Adviser poll of 18,528 adults in 17 countries conducted March 22-April 5 and released Sept. 5.\n\n\u2022 Kindly follow Jennifer Harper on Twitter @HarperBulletin\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
