The Gunners have only lost one of their last 11 games. Slavia Prague, who have reached the Champions League quarter finals three times, sit at the top of the Czech First Division, but are used to a less competitive league than the Women\u2019s Super League, as they already have a 61 point goal difference after just 9 games.", "description": "A Champions League quarter-final place is at stake but, in the knowledge that Arsenal beat Slavia Prague in the away leg 5-2, manager Joe Montemurro says he will rest players as next week\u2019s international break approaches.", "authors": ["Sophie Penney"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/30/TELEMMGLPICT000211358650-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqM37qcIWR9CtrqmiMdQVx7I6TmtWQvbyPUx0PwpP7dTo.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
