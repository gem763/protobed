Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) shouts during a confirmation hearing in Washington, D.C., September 27, 2018. (Win McNamee/Reuters)\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) lambasted President Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria on Monday, less than an hour after the president confirmed his decision to pull forces back in the face of a potential Turkish invasion of northern Syria.\n\nGraham stipulated on Twitter that he \u201cdon\u2019t know all the details\u201d and was setting up a call with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to learn more, but nevertheless criticized the administration for what he views as a shortsighted decision.\n\nGraham continued to attack the White House during a Monday morning appearance on Fox & Friends for being \u201cirresponsible\u201d in its treatment of Kurdish allies.\n\n\u201cThis impulsive decision by the president has undone all the gains we\u2019ve made, thrown the region into further chaos, Iran is licking their chops, and if I\u2019m an ISIS fighter, I\u2019ve got a second lease on life,\u201d Graham said. \u201cTo those who think ISIS has been defeated, you will soon see, and to Turkey you have destroyed the relationship, what little you had with the U.S. Congress, and I will do everything I can to sanction Turkey\u2019s military and their economy if they step one foot into Syria.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like President Trump, and I\u2019ve tried to help him,\u201d he added. \u201cThis to me is just unnerving to its core. To say to the American people that ISIS has been destroyed in Syria is not true.\u201d\n\nThe South Carolina senator has long been a defender of the Kurds as key allies in the fight against ISIS. In December 2018, Graham tweeted his displeasure at the potential Syrian withdrawal, saying \u201cAmerica\u2019s worst nightmare is to have reliable allies like the Kurds who have fought so bravely against ISIS \u2013 abandoned and destroyed.\u201d\n\nOn Monday morning, Trump took to Twitter to proactively defend the decision, stating that the U.S. had destroyed \u201c100% of the ISIS Caliphate\u201d and that \u201cit is time for us to get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars, many of them tribal, and bring our soldiers home. WE WILL FIGHT WHERE IT IS TO OUR BENEFIT, AND ONLY FIGHT TO WIN.\u201d", "description": "\u201cThis to me is just unnerving to its core.
