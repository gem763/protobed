The strike was said to have disrupted output from the region to the amount of 5.7million barrels per day, roughly 6% of global production. The disruption is said to be amongst the largest on record and saw an initial 19% jump in pricing.\n\nProduction recovery\n\nUS president Donald Trump has suggested tapping strategic reserves to curb the impact of crude shortfalls, following the Saudi attacks. Russia has also lent its support and highlighted that global oil reserves remained enough to temper the mid-term losses in output which could stem from the geopolitical tensions.\n\nSaudi Arabia has however already managed to recoup 2million barrels per day in output and given guidance that the balance of production lost should be recovered shortly as well.\n\nGeopolitical risk remains\n\nThe drone strike and subsequent move in oil highlights continued hostility within the Middle East and oil\u2019s vulnerability to geopolitical tension. While Yemen rebels have claimed responsibility for the attack, some US officials have suggested that Iran may have had an influence in the Saudi attack (a claim which Iran firmly denies). US president Donald Trump has threatened retaliation to the bombing once all the facts of the event are uncovered. In turn there remains a threat of increased geopolitical tension within the Middle East and an upside risk to the price of oil through further disruption.\n\nSupply vs demand\n\nMarkets continue to assess the balance of supply verse demand for oil. On the supply side the OPEC+ (Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries & Russia) have extended the production curbs of 1.2million barrels per day, which commenced in January this year. Further supply constraints have manifested from the sanctioning of Iran and Venezuela by the US. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) has also warned of an oil glut in 2020 largely as a result of an increasing oil rig count and shale initiatives in the US.\n\nA slowing rate of growth for the global economy and recessionary fears have been keeping oil prices subdued on the suggestion of reduced demand for the commodity. The ongoing trade war narrative remains a further threat to global growth which has continuously been reflecting in the price of oil. Markets will be looking to renewed talks between China and the US (commencing imminently) and monitoring tensions in the Middle East for near term directional guidance on the commodity.\n\nBrent Crude \u2013 Technical View\n\nContinue Reading", "description": "Commodities Analysis by Shaun Murison covering: Brent Oil Futures.
