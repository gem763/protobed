It sounded like a fine thing to say, back when men were unabashed \u201cmen.\u201d Now, we have #MeToo, and toxic males, and even such a once man-friendly rag as Gentlemen\u2019s Quarterly (i.e., GQ), which has historically celebrated men, seems to be just sick about them, eager to atone for their Y chromosome.\n\nAs a subscriber for decades \u2014 and as a biological male \u2014 I eagerly delved into GQ\u2019s \u201cNew Masculinity\u201d issue. I\u2019ve historically read the magazine that \u201cmeets millions of modern men where they live\u201d for high-grade long-form journalism, or to settle existential quandaries such as, \u201cWhat the hell is face serum and do I need to use it?\u201d Still, one generally doesn\u2019t turn to men\u2019s magazine editors with soft hands who fret about conquering \u201cyour complex pant-shoe relationship\u201d for instruction on the meaning of manhood. Not to pick on GQ, which, after all, helps us perform vital functions, such as how to \u201csalute the celebrity mustache.\u201d\n\nBut after years of #MeToo scandals, which have revealed weirdos and perverts and sex criminals (and that\u2019s just R. Kelly), \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d is now regarded as tautology in some quarters. In more than a few tellings today, just to be a man is to be toxic.\n\nSo GQ\u2019s newish editor in chief, Will Welch, is taking a crack at overhauling our benighted gender, presenting an issue in which, as he puts it, \u201ctraditional notions of masculinity are being challenged\u201d and \u201coverturned.\u201d In doing so, he holds, we can be more generous, empathetic humans, even to ourselves, since \u201ctoxicity simply cannot thrive in the golden presence of genuine self-love.\u201d Tell that to Harvey Weinstein, who allegedly \u201cself-loved\u201d into a potted plant in front of one of his trapped victims.", "description": "Meet the \u201cnew man\u201d: whatever others say he is.", "authors": ["Matt Labash"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/23/opinion/23labash2/23labash2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
