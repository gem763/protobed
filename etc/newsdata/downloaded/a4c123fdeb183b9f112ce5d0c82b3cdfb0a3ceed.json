The news release says that blockchain-based CBDC would be \u201caimed at facilitating the settlement of tokenized assets between financial institutions.\u201d\n\nMonitoring tech insights for central banks\n\nThe underlying objectives for the new hub would be identifying and developing insights in critical trends in technology affecting central banks and serving as a focal point for a network of central bank experts on innovation, the news release reads.\n\nThomas Jordan, chairman of the governing board of the SNB, said that the central bank has been closely following the trend of digitization of the financial sector and technological innovation. He added that the new cooperation will allow the banks involved to further expand expertise in financial markets and their infrastructure.\n\nAttitudes towards CBDCs\n\nIn early September, Jordan claimed that stablecoins pegged to foreign currencies could hamper Switzerland\u2019s monetary policy in some circumstances. He argued that providing the general public with access to a CBDC could pose a threat to financial stability by increasing the likelihood of a bank run.\n\nSimilarly, BIS general manager Agustin Carstens previously expressed a negative stance toward CBDCs, claiming that they could facilitate a bank run and enable people to move their funds from commercial banks to central bank accounts faster, destabilizing the system.", "description": "The Swiss National Bank and SIX Group to jointly research digital central bank money within a project of the BIS Innovation Hub Centre", "authors": ["Helen Partz"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvOTA3MGZiZTEzNmYwZGQzOTE2MmNkYjdiM2FlYzcyMzUuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
