(Aubree Milks/AP)\n\nThere was an $85 billion elephant in the room at this year\u2019s Air Force Association conference, an annual trade show where thousands of uniformed airmen rub shoulders with suit-clad defense contractors hawking the latest advanced weaponry.\n\nThose entering the conference hotel in National Harbor, Md., were welcomed by an enormous blue banner splashed with the Northrop Grumman logo and the words \u201cLEGENDARY DETERRENCE\u201d \u2015 a not-so-subtle reference to the company\u2019s ballistic missile ambitions.\n\nNorthrop is poised to take over a massive Air Force nuclear weapons program called Ground Based Strategic Deterrent, or GBSD, which will call on a team of contractors to replace the U.S. military\u2019s aging stock of Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles. But Boeing\u2019s Arlington-based defense business, which has handled the Minuteman program since 1958, has launched an aggressive lobbying campaign in defense of its interests.\n\nNorthrop \u201cis on a path to a sole-source opportunity,\u201d Boeing GBSD Program Manager Frank McCall warned in an interview Wednesday on the floor of the trade show.\n\n\u201cThere has never been a time in the history of the Minuteman when the Air Force wasn\u2019t supported by both companies,\u201d he said, adding that he thinks the Pentagon is taking \u201ca winner-take-all approach\u201d that is \u201cunprecedented in the history of intercontinental ballistic missiles.\u201d\n\nThe ground-based missiles make up one leg of the U.S. nuclear triad, which aims to be ready to deliver warheads at a moment\u2019s notice from air, land or sea. They are meant to deter other countries from launching a nuclear strike by sending a message that any first-mover will be destroyed immediately.\n\n[Why can\u2019t we use nuclear weapons against bedbugs?]\n\nThe different components of the triad are extremely expensive to build and keep at the ready. For the new ground-based missiles, the Pentagon faces a difficult dilemma as it tries to get the best solution for the best price.\n\nThe Air Force had hoped to evaluate multiple competing options. But Boeing, thought to be the only viable competitor aside from Northrop, says it won\u2019t participate unless the Air Force changes its approach.\n\nWith Boeing out, the Northrop-led team appears to be the Pentagon\u2019s only option, something that could make it hard for the government to negotiate a fair price.\n\nIt is a common dilemma facing Defense Department weapons buyers, who have the impossible task of running a competitive marketplace when there are, at best, two or three potential suppliers for the most expensive weapons systems. The U.S. defense industry has consolidated to a worrying degree in the decades since the Cold War, officials and analysts say, with a handful of dominant suppliers exerting tremendous influence.\n\nA White House report released last year found 300 cases in which important defense products are produced by just a single company, a \u201cfragile\u201d supplier, or a foreign supplier.\n\n[White House report points to severe shortcomings in U.S. military supply chain]\n\nThere is big money at stake for Boeing and Northrop: Defense Department estimates for the long-term cost of the program range between $62 billion and $100 billion. Both companies have formidable lobbying operations, spending $7.2 million and $8.3 million, respectively, on Washington lobbyists in 2019.\n\nBoeing\u2019s stewardship of the Minuteman program brought it roughly 600 defense contracts totaling $8 billion in the first 30 years of the programs, according to estimates provided by the company. Northrop has traditionally taken a secondary role handling complex systems integration.\n\nIn 2017, Northrop and Boeing were awarded contracts worth $349.2 million and $328.6 million, respectively, to develop their own version of a next-generation replacement for the Minuteman. In July, the Air Force asked each company to submit a proposal, hoping to compare the two missile designs and negotiate a fair price.\n\nBoeing quickly threw a wrench into that plan, announcing July 25 that it would walk away from the competition because the Air Force\u2019s request for proposals allegedly favored Northrop.\n\nBoeing\u2019s concerns stem from Northrop Grumman\u2019s 2017 acquisition of a company called Orbital ATK for $7.8 billion. Orbital ATK \u2015 which operates as a Northrop Grumman business unit called Innovation Systems \u2015 is a dominant producer of rocket motors that power ballistic missiles. Aerojet Rocketdyne, the other U.S. manufacturer of rocket motors, also is working with Northrop.\n\nBoeing has taken its case to the Pentagon, as well as to the Federal Trade Commission, but has failed to block the deal.\n\n\u201cWe continue to stand ready to support this important program,\u201d wrote Leanne Caret, president of Boeing\u2019s Arlington-based defense business, in a July 23 letter seen by The Washington Post. \u201cAs we have discussed, we believe there are other procurement structures that could provide this capability more rapidly at less cost, and we will look for ways to leverage the work \u2026 to help support this critical national security mission.\u201d\n\nBoeing later approached Northrop about the possibility of teaming up but was rejected, a Boeing official said. So it came as little surprise Monday when Northrop released the list of companies it is teaming up with, and Boeing isn\u2019t on it.\n\n[Secret locations of U.S. nuclear weapons in Europe accidentally included in report from NATO parliament]\n\nAir Force officials stood by their approach but declined to comment on how they will proceed.\n\n\u201cWe are very open to a variety of proposals. \u2026 We are open to teaming relationships. We just don\u2019t want to dictate,\u201d Will Roper, the Air Force\u2019s assistant secretary for acquisition, technology and logistics, told reporters Monday. \u201cWe think it should be decided by industry and what they think is best value.\u201d\n\nSoon afterward, Boeing countered that it is pursuing a multifaceted advocacy and lobbying campaign asking the government to force Northrop to collaborate.\n\n\u201cWe believe it is a path to a better weapons system solution that will allow us to field the solution more quickly than either company could handle on its own,\u201d said McCall, the Boeing official.\n\nAnalysts expressed concern over the current arrangement, in which Northrop will almost certainly be the only bidder. Whether Boeing\u2019s proposal will resolve the problem is less clear.\n\n\u201cI would much rather see a direct competition between Northrop and Boeing,\u201d said Dan Grazier, a former Marine Corps captain working at the Project on Government Oversight, a watchdog group. \u201cThe best practice for any acquisition system would be a solid, honest, competitive prototyping, where the government can weigh competing options and get a competitive price.\u201d", "description": "The two Virginia-based defense giants are jockeying for position on the Air Force's Ground Based Strategic Deterrent program, a ballistic missile program thought to be worth as much as $85 billion.", "authors": ["Aaron Gregg", "Reporter Covering The Defense Industry", "Commercial Aviation", "Government Contractors.", "September At Am", "Aaron Gregg Covers The Defense Industry", "Government Contractors For The Washington Post'S Business Section."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/d3pOMGne8jdpQXB77Mxt28TyXTY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RDKS57DMFYI6TO7HDR4Y7OAFGY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
