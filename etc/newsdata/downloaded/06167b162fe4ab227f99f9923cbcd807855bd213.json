Experience is gained by playing at the highest level for a period of time,\u201d du Plessis told reporters.\n\n\u201cIn this new phase of a lot of guys coming in, you got to give it some time.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cHash (Hashim Amla) finishing, AB (de Villiers) finishing in a year\u2019s time, we got two players with a lot of runs behind their names finishing.\n\n\u201cIt is going to take some time to fill those shoes but we as leadership understand that it is important to be patient with the guys because they will come through again.\u201d\n\nElgar put together two crucial century partnerships with du Plessis, who made 55, and Quinton de Kock (111) to stand up to the Indian spinners who are formidable in home conditions.\n\nDu Plessis said he was confident his batsmen would adapt to the turning tracks in the upcoming matches.\n\n\u201cLook, I think we have got a lot of confidence in our dressing room and belief because of what happened in the first innings,\u201d said du Plessis.\n\n\u201cI do think the pitches will probably take a bit more spin in the next two Test matches. But Dean scored a great 160 in the first innings and Quinny as well, a great combination of attack and defence.\u201d\n\nDu Plessis also praised South Africa\u2019s leading spinner Keshav Maharaj for his three wickets in India\u2019s first innings.\n\n\u201cKeshav is a very, very good spinner,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHe probably wasn\u2019t at his best in the second innings but I have a lot of confidence that on wickets that offer a little bit more spin, he is just as good as any one of the spinners in the Indian team.\u201d\n\nThe action shifts to Pune for the second Test starting October 10.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Skipper Faf du Plessis said Sunday that South Africa's leadership will have be patient with an emerging team that was thumped to the tune of 203 runs by India in the opening Test.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ind-vs-sa-test-match-day-4_59e9759e-e820-11e9-a8aa-54897fdfe8ad.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
