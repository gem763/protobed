The U.S. withdrawal from the area clears the way for a military assault by Turkey, which views the Kurdish-led SDF as a threat to its own security.\n\n\u201cThere were assurances from the United States of America that it would not allow any Turkish military operations against the region,\u201d said SDF spokesman Kino Gabriel, according to Reuters. \u201cBut the [president\u2019s] statement today was a surprise and we can say that it is a stab in the back for the SDF.\u201d\n\nLocal media reported Monday that U.S. forces had begun leaving northeast Syria. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also said Monday that the withdrawal had begun.\n\nIn a statement early Monday afternoon, the Pentagon did not offer details on the U.S. exit but said it opposes any looming military action by Turkey against the SDF.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Defense made clear to Turkey \u2014 as did the President \u2014 that we do not endorse a Turkish operation in Northern Syria. The U.S. armed forces will not support, or be involved in any such operation,\u201d said Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman. \u201cIn conversations between the Department and the Turkish military we have consistently stressed that coordination and cooperation were the best path toward security in the area.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s decision immediately sparked a harsh backlash on Capitol Hill, including by some of the president\u2019s closest Republican allies.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican, said on Twitter that he\u2019s likely to introduce a Senate resolution the opposing the decision and asking for it to be reversed.\n\n\u201cIf press reports are accurate this is a disaster in the making,\u201d he said, adding that the move will fuel an Islamic State comeback, could force the Kurds to align with Syrian dictator Bashar Assad and with Iran, and would be a \u201cstain on America\u2019s honor for abandoning the Kurds.\u201d\n\nRep. Liz Cheney, Wyoming Republican, called the withdrawal a \u201ccatastrophic mistake.\u201d\n\n\u201cPulling out of northern Syria ignores that painful lesson, represents an abandonment of our Kurdish allies despite their vital contributions to the fight against ISIS, emboldens Iran, and serves as an undeserved gift to the Ergodan regime, which has only continued its steady march toward Moscow,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nSen. Tim Kaine, Virginia Democrat, blasted not only the policy decision itself but also the fact that the president apparently made the move without consulting congressional leaders.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s decision to pull U.S. troops from Syria\u2019s border with Turkey and abandon the Kurds is a betrayal of a key partner in our fight against ISIS,\u201d Mr. Kaine said in a statement. \u201cNow they are on their own \u2014 facing threats from the Syrian government, Turkey, Russia, and ISIS remnants. And Trump took this step against the advice of our diplomats and military leaders. He didn\u2019t even notify the Kurds, our allies, or Congress.\u201d\n\nThe withdrawal from Syria makes good on a promise Mr. Trump made late last year, when he vowed to an \u201cendless war\u201d in the Middle East and bring troops home. The move led directly to the resignation of then-Defense Secretary James Mattis and sparked a fierce backlash on Capitol Hill.\n\nSince then, however, the White House and Pentagon seemingly have slow-walked the withdrawal, and American forces have remained stationed in Syria.\n\nSunday evening\u2019s announcement seems to change that. In a statement, the White House said that the president spoke with Mr. Erdogan on Sunday night and the two men discussed the situation inside Syria.\n\n\u201cTurkey will soon be moving forward with its long-planned operation into Northern Syria. The United States Armed Forces will not support or be involved in the operation, and United States forces, having defeated the ISIS territorial \u2018Caliphate,\u2019 will no longer be in the immediate area,\u201d White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement.\n\nRegional analysts condemned the move as \u201cinsanity\u201d and said it sends a horrible signal to U.S. allies.\n\n\u201cThat we should hand over crucial real estate to Turkey, a country that now works against American interests in almost every way, borders on insanity,\u201d Jonathan Schanzer, senior vice president for research at the Washington-based think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said on Twitter. \u201cAnd the idea of green lighting a war *against our own allies* is mind boggling.\u201d\n\nThe White House also said it is passing responsibility to Turkey for all of the Islamic State fighters captured in recent years.\n\n\u201cThe United States Government has pressed France, Germany, and other European nations, from which many captured ISIS fighters came, to take them back, but they did not want them and refused,\u201d Ms. Grisham continued. \u201cThe United States will not hold them for what could be many years and great cost to the United States taxpayer. Turkey will now be responsible for all ISIS fighters in the area captured over the past two years in the wake of the defeat of the territorial \u2018Caliphate\u2019 by the United States.\u201d\n\nThe Pentagon also shifted responsibility for captured Islamic State fighters to Turkey.\n\n\u201cAs the president has stated, Turkey would be responsible, along with European nations and others, for thousands of ISIS fighters who had been captured and defeated in the campaign lead by the United States,\u201d Mr. Hoffman said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
