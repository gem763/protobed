He accused the pair of \u201cpandering to China\u201d for not speaking out and suggested they didn't have \u201crespect\u201d for America, complaining that they \u201ctalk badly about the United States.\u201d\n\nPopovich, a former Air Force member, has been outspoken in his criticism of the Trump administration. ESPN reports that Kerr has also previously been very outspoken about social issues in the U.S. and has spoken negatively about Trump in public.\n\nTrump said Kerr, who has said he wanted to learn more about the situation before commenting on it, was acting like a \u201clittle boy who was so scared\u201d when he declined to comment on Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey's pro-Hong Kong tweet.\n\n\u201cHe couldn\u2019t answer the question. He was shaking. \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.\u2019 He didn\u2019t know how to answer the question. And yet he\u2019ll talk about the United States very badly,\u201d Trump continued.\n\nWhen talking about Popovich's avoidance to directly address China's apparent retaliation, the president said he thought he \u201cdidn\u2019t look quite as scared\u201d as Kerr. The president then added he thought both their responses were \u201cpretty sad actually.\u201d\n\nPopovich threw a jab at Trump while praising NBA Commissioner Adam Silver's defense of free speech earlier this week in response to China's actions against the pro-basketball league. Chinese state television said it canceled the planned broadcast of two NBA exhibition games due to be played in the country this week after Morey tweeted and then deleted support for Hong Kong protesters. Chinese companies and the Chinese Basketball Association began to sever their ties with the team, and the Chinese government demanded an apology, but Silver shot back that the NBA's free speech would be protected regardless of the consequences.\n\nPopovich lauded Silver's response to the controversy as showing a \u201cbig difference\u201d from \u201cwe\u2019ve had to live through the past three years,\u201d referring to Trump's constant attacks against the media.\n\nFor all his criticism towards the coaches for not directly addressing China's role in the fight, Trump didn't seem to have the stomach to do it either.\n\n\u201cThey have to work out their own situation,\u201d the president said of the dispute. \u201cThe NBA, they know what they're doing.\u201d\n\nWarriors player Steph Curry, who had also been a target for Trump, said he had to \u201cwelcome Steve (Kerr) to the club\u201d in response to the president's attacks against his coach. \u201cThat's kind of par for the course there,\u201d he reportedly joked to reporters.", "description": "Trump, who went after the NBA coaches rather than commenting on China\u2019s role in the free speech dispute, said Kerr was like a \u201clittle boy who was so scared.\u201d", "authors": ["Julia Arciga"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2983,w_5304,x_0,y_143/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570668624/GettyImages-1180080424_atnvdf", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
