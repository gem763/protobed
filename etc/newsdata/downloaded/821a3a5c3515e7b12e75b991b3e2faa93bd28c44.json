He then pushed one of the linesman before being restrained by team mates and was shown the red card.\n\nDescribing Ribery\u2019s conduct as \u201cseriously disrespectful\u201d, Serie A\u2019s disciplinary tribunal said on Monday that Ribery had approached the linesman with \u201cthreatening behaviour\u201d and pushed him twice.\n\nEarlier, Ribery \u2014 who was also fined 20,000 euros ($22,196) \u2014 apologised on Twitter for his behaviour, saying that he was \u201cagitated\u201d after the controversial finish.\n\nFiorentina asserted that the move which led to Lazio\u2019s 89th-minute goal began with a foul by Jordan Lukaku on Riccardo Sotil and were baffled as to why the referee did not review the incident on the pitchside monitor \u2014 instead relying on a silent check by the VAR official.", "description": "Fiorentina's veteran forward Franck Ribery has been suspended for three matches by Serie A's disciplinary tribunal for pushing a linesman following his side's 2-1 home defeat by Lazio on Sunday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445915687&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R1E6", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
