While it might have just been a challenge for them, it also seemed like a need to show off.\n\nOpenAI is clearly interested in showing off what its Dactyl robotic-hand can do with a Rubik\u2019s Cube.\n\nThe organization announced that the robot has learned to solve a Rubik\u2019s Cube one-handed, an accomplishment that speaks to the robot\u2019s dexterity in handling and manipulating the cube more than anything. Previously, we had seen the robot interact with unknown objects without any real-world training, only virtual simulations. Now, Dactyl has built on that ability to learn this new one.\n\nAllowing the robot to analyze the cube and figure out a way to solve it would be one thing, actually pulling off the movements to carry that out would be another, but \u201clearning\u201d to solve means that even with severe impairments that altered its path of action \u2014 like having some of its fingers tied together, the system was able to make adjustments to find the path towards solving the puzzle.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly not a flawless system, and it won\u2019t be taking down any world champions in the next few weeks but in the video below you can see it solve the cube in under four minutes, which is pretty damn impressive.", "description": "There\u2019s always been something so annoying about people who found the need to stack additional challenges onto solving a Rubik\u2019s Cube quickly, whether it was doing it blind-folded or while juggling or one-handed.
