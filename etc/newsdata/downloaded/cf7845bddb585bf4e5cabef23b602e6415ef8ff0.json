Just tell him he 'ain't a quarterback'", "language": "en", "text": "Anytime Lamar Jackson wasn\u2019t sharp enough during passing drills last offseason, his longtime quarterbacks coach knew just how to light a fire under him.\n\nJoshua Harris would allude to the lingering doubts facing Jackson about his ability to throw at an NFL level.\n\n\u201cThis is why they say you ain\u2019t a quarterback!\u201d Harris would bark if Jackson misfired on an easy pass. It was a reference to last year\u2019s NFL draft when some teams didn\u2019t think Jackson could make the necessary throws to run a pro-style offense and asked the former Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback to work out at receiver or running back instead.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nJackson led the Baltimore Ravens to a 6-1 record as a starting quarterback last season, but the rookie\u2019s harshest critics harped on his low completion percentage (58 percent), penchant for fumbling (12) and overreliance on his running ability (147 rushes vs. 170 passes). As a result, Harris was quick to roast Jackson during drills if he fled the pocket at the first hint of pressure, quipping, \u201cNo wonder everyone thinks you\u2019re just a runner!\u201d\n\nIt was quite a homecoming for Ravens QB Lamar Jackson, who destroyed the Miami Dolphins in the season opener. (Getty Images)\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a player who responds so well to criticism,\u201d Harris told Yahoo Sports. \u201cIf I mention something someone said about him to try to get him going, the next throw he makes is always perfect. I\u2019ve realized that\u2019s something that he thrives on.\u201d\n\nFueled by the desperate desire to prove the Ravens right for believing in him and to make his many critics eat their words, Jackson enjoyed some long-awaited vindication Sunday afternoon. The second-year quarterback went 17-of-20 for 324 yards and five touchdowns in a season-opening 59-10 thrashing of the Miami Dolphins.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt would be foolish to overstate the importance of one game against an overmatched opponent, but it\u2019s certainly noteworthy that Jackson destroyed Miami with his arm instead of his legs. He rushed just three times for 6 yards, a clear message that he\u2019s more than just a dazzling athlete.\n\nWhen asked if his perfect quarterback rating and franchise-record completion percentage would finally put an end to the talk that he\u2019s not an NFL-caliber passer, Jackson flashed a wry grin and pounced on the chance to clap back at the naysayers.\n\n\u201cProbably not,\u201d Jackson told reporters in Miami, \u201cbut not bad for a running back.\u201d\n\nAsk people close to Jackson to explain his apparent offseason improvement as a passer, and they\u2019ll typically cite two factors. They point to the Ravens installing a new passing attack tailored to Jackson\u2019s skills and Harris finally having time to refine the quarterback\u2019s unconventional throwing mechanics.\n\nHaving jettisoned Joe Flacco over the offseason and thrown all their chips in on Jackson, the Ravens tasked offensive coordinator Greg Roman with overhauling the playbook in their quarterback\u2019s image. Roman was an ideal choice given his experience exploiting the strengths of another exceptionally mobile quarterback, former San Francisco 49ers starter Colin Kaepernick.\n\nIn addition to learning the new playbook, Jackson also worked with Harris all offseason to fix the mechanical flaws that limited his effectiveness passing the ball as a rookie. They spent a few mornings and evenings a week doing throwing drills on the South Florida field where Jackson once played youth football, often flying in Ravens or ex-Louisville receivers for additional help.\n\nLamar Jackson's red-hot start was only topped by Derek Carr and Dak Prescott in Pro Football Focus' weekly draft grades of quarterbacks.\n\nHarris\u2019 goal was to deliver the Ravens a true dual-threat quarterback by the time training camp began rather than the one-dimensional running specialist of a year ago.\n\n\u201cWhat he can be is something the league hasn\u2019t seen,\u201d Harris said. \u201cHe can give you what any pocket passer can give you but then when there\u2019s nothing there, he can take off and make an explosive play. That\u2019s his ultimate ceiling, but we are still working on creating the discipline that it takes to do that.\u201d\n\nOver the next few months, it should become clearer whether Jackson\u2019s near-flawless passing performance against Miami will be remembered as a bizarre anomaly or the start of a trend. For now, it\u2019s another step in his obstacle-laden journey from unpolished recruit, to polarizing draft prospect, to budding NFL success story.\n\nThe rise of Lamar Jackson\n\nJackson\u2019s football odyssey began in Pompano Beach, Florida, 14 years ago with a straightforward challenge from his first youth football coach.\n\nVan Warren told the 8-year-old that he had to demonstrate he could throw a football at least 20 yards if he wanted to compete for the starting quarterback job. If Jackson fell short, he would have to play another position.\n\n\u201cI walked 20 yards, and he threw a dime,\u201d Warren said. \u201cI was like, \u2018Alright, let\u2019s go to work.\u2019\u201d\n\nTales of Jackson\u2019s video game-esque youth football exploits generated plenty of buzz when he transferred to Boynton Beach High School late in his sophomore year, but head coach Rick Swain insisted the newcomer would have to earn the team\u2019s starting quarterback job. The competition ended 30 minutes into Jackson\u2019s first practice after he displayed a combination of speed, elusiveness and arm strength Swain had never witnessed from a high school prospect before.\n\nJackson\u2019s dual-threat ability prompted Swain to switch from a traditional spread offense to a no-huddle pistol scheme. In two years at a historically downtrodden Boynton Beach program, Jackson led the team to a 20-4 record and produced more than 5,000 yards of offense, 3,033 through the air and 2,440 on the ground.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to imagine any college coach not pursuing Jackson after watching his jaw-dropping high school highlight reel, but in reality the future Heisman Trophy winner was not considered a can\u2019t-miss recruit. Rivals rated Jackson a four-star prospect and the 17th-ranked dual-threat quarterback in the 2015 class. Scout and ESPN awarded him only three stars.\n\nOne concern that scouting services had about Jackson was that his completion percentage was unusually low for a quarterback prospect with high-major arm talent. Jackson also played in a rudimentary offense that relied on his ability to freelance and seldom required him to read defenses and find open receivers from the pocket.\n\nAmong the first college recruiters to fly to Boynton Beach to assess Jackson in person was Louisville wide receivers coach Lamar Thomas, a former all-state high school receiver under Swain years earlier. Swain successfully piqued Thomas\u2019 curiosity when he described Jackson as the best athlete he had ever coached, no doubt as much a friendly dig at Thomas as a compliment for Jackson.\n\n\u201cThat really got my attention,\u201d said Thomas, himself a former eight-year NFL veteran with the Miami Dolphins and Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\n\u2018When I went to see him, he was a little raw, but he was a really good athlete. I saw him running, I saw him spinning, I saw him juking, I saw him throwing. I said, \u2018Wow, this kid is legit.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThomas had the inside track to land Jackson thanks to his relationship with Swain, but first he had to persuade Louisville head coach Bobby Petrino to approve a scholarship offer. Petrino was impressed with Jackson\u2019s speed, strength and elusiveness but did not initially see an ACC-caliber quarterback.\n\nTo get Petrino to change his mind, Thomas altered Jackson\u2019s highlight reel to eliminate his running plays and showcase only his arm. Watching Jackson effortlessly send deep balls 60 yards with a flick of the wrist, Petrino saw a different quarterback.\n\nOnce Petrino agreed to recruit Jackson to play quarterback, Louisville emerged as an instant contender to land him. Many other schools envisioned Jackson transitioning to another position in college, a deal breaker in the eyes of him and his mother, Felicia Jones.\n\n\u201cThat was not something to even entertain,\u201d Warren said. \u201cIf you weren\u2019t talking quarterback, there was nothing to even talk about.\u201d\n\nJackson\u2019s four finalists were Louisville, Florida, Mississippi State and Nebraska, each of whom recruited him as a quarterback. Louisville emerged the winner by showing Jackson he\u2019d have a realistic chance to compete for the starting job right away instead of sitting for at least a year or two behind a veteran.\n\nBefore Jackson committed, Jones told Petrino she needed him to promise he\u2019d play her son exclusively at quarterback. Petrino kept his word with one exception, a practice early in the 2015 season when he was in desperate need of a dynamic punt returner and offered Jackson a crack at it.\n\nOnly minutes after practice ended, members of the Louisville staff received a phone call from Jackson\u2019s mother. She reminded them of the promise Petrino had made in her living room and that was the end of the punt returning experiment.\n\n\u201cTo this day, we still don\u2019t know how she found out so fast,\u201d Thomas said with a chuckle. \u201cThe kid caught the ball so effortlessly and everybody was like, \u2018Hmmmmmm.\u2019 But in the back of my mind, I knew we had made that promise and we had to stick to it.\u201d\n\nTantalizing as it was to unleash Jackson all over the field, Louisville clearly made the right call building its offense around the future Heisman Trophy winner\u2019s unique talents at quarterback. Jackson emerged as one of the nation\u2019s elite dual-threat quarterbacks, throwing for over 9,000 yards and 69 touchdowns during his decorated three-year college career and adding more than 4,000 yards and 50 touchdowns on the ground.\n\nLamar Jackson works with his quarterback coach, Joshua Harris. (Courtesy of Joshua Harris)\n\nThe man behind Jackson\u2019s star turn\n\nIt\u2019s no accident that Jackson\u2019s star turn at Louisville coincided with his decision to entrust his throwing mechanics to an instructor with an unusual background for his gig.\n\nHarris played defensive end at Tennessee State in the early 2000s before leaving football behind and earning his law degree. He only began researching how to instruct quarterbacks when he started coaching high school football in Florida and his son started to take an interest in playing the position.\n\nA maniacal researcher with a thirst for knowledge, Harris poured himself into his new passion, devouring books on the fundamentals of throwing a football, volunteering at clinics run by prominent quarterback coaches and studying film of the likes of Tom Brady and Drew Brees. Within a few years, Harris understood the nuances of the quarterback position better than most of the men who have played it.\n\nIt was through Warren that Harris first met Jackson before the quarterback\u2019s sophomore season at Louisville. Harris worked with Jackson at a handful of Warren\u2019s Sunday passing clinics in Pompano Beach, swiftly establishing a strong rapport with the Louisville star and his mother.\n\nBy that time, Warren thought he had taught Jackson all he could about the quarterback position. He urged Jackson to begin working with Harris on his mechanics.\n\n\u201cI thought Coach Josh would be able to take Lamar to the next level and I was right,\u201d Warren said. \u201cLike I tell anyone, it was Coach Josh and his planning taking Lamar to where he is right now.\u201d\n\nFor two years, Harris followed Louisville\u2019s plan for Jackson, helping him learn the scheme that Petrino built for him and putting him through drills designed to help him thrive. Only when it was time to begin preparing for the 2018 NFL draft did Harris begin addressing some of the many concerns scouts had raised about Jackson\u2019s potential transition to the pro game.\n\nAware that NFL teams were wary that so much of Jackson\u2019s college success had come in the shotgun formation, Harris advised his pupil to take every snap under center during his pro day. Harris also emphasized passing concepts during that nationally televised workout in an effort to address concerns about Jackson\u2019s ability to read a defense and find an open receiver.\n\nJackson did not run the 40-yard dash at the scouting combine because Harris felt a speedy time might fuel the calls to move him to receiver. Never did Jackson work out for any NFL team at running back or receiver because he wanted to make it clear that quarterback is his position.\n\n\u201cHe has been a quarterback his whole life,\u201d Harris said. \u201cHe never told me the talk of him playing other positions hurt, but I think it was like, \u2018Why are they saying that? I threw for 9,000 yards in college!\u2019 He felt like he had already shown people he was a quarterback by then.\u201d\n\nIf last offseason was all about draft preparation, then this one offered more time for Harris to refine Jackson\u2019s mechanics.\n\nOne point of emphasis from Harris was helping Jackson find a consistent rhythm with his 3- and 5-step drops to help him better time his passes to receivers. When watching film from last season, Harris felt Jackson often allowed the pass rush to dictate the pace of his drops.\n\nAnother point Harris stressed was Jackson being more disciplined aligning his feet, hips and elbow to his eyes. Jackson\u2019s failure to adhere to that basic concept as a rookie contributed to his accuracy issues, especially on passes outside the numbers.\n\nThe drill Jackson hated most was Harris\u2019 unusual method of making him comfortable staying in a collapsing pocket and surveying his downfield options. Harris would simulate conflict in the pocket by swinging a broom at Jackson, forcing him to learn to move his feet and reset them before throwing the ball.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll swing it, swing it, swing it and then I\u2019ll say, \u2018Throw,\u2019 and he has to make an accurate pass,\u201d Harris said. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t, he knows it\u2019s 10 pushups.\u201d\n\nThe fruits of Jackson\u2019s offseason work were on display Sunday afternoon when he shredded his hometown Miami Dolphins without hardly resorting to scrambling. The quarterback whom so many wanted to transform into something else showed that his arm is just as dangerous as his feet.\n\nIt was a surprise for many around the NFL. It was vindication for Jackson and his inner circle.\n\n\u201cWith all the scrutiny he faced preparing for the draft and during this past offseason, to have him have that good a day was a feel-good moment,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI\u2019ve told him, \u2018You\u2019ve been proving people wrong your whole life. Let\u2019s just continue to do that.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Lamar Jackson put in an offseason of hard work to prove he's more than just a runner.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/L1ZvISL5FehUMM5usKDl1A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/o3V_JTcbCYm0AeJ0lvHopg--~B/aD0yNzAyO3c9NDA1MztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/b4d71dd0-d51f-11e9-bdf8-55912b61bd27", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
