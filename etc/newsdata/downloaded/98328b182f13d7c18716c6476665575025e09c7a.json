Previously, the organization sold the three companies\u2019 targeted ad inventory based largely on the location of subscribers.\n\nThe organization is also offering programmers the ability to carve out some of their national ad time to sell as targeted advertising among Comcast, Charter and Cox subscribers.\n\nA handful of TV programmers have recently expressed a desire to offer ad targeting as advertisers increasingly turn to data and digital platforms to reach narrower groups of consumers with the most fitting messages.\n\n\u201cTurning on addressability will keep the dollars in TV,\u201d said Nicolle Pangis, chief executive officer of NCC, referring to the ability to use anonymized customer data to send different ads to different households.\n\nNCC is also changing its name to Ampersand, a rebranding partly meant to evoke collaboration among TV distributors, programmers and other parts of the media business.\n\nTV distributors such as cable operators and satellite providers for years have offered targeted ads, using the two minutes of commercial time per hour that they typically get from networks. A household in one ZIP Code might see an ad for a minivan, for example, while a household in another ZIP Code tuned into the same program might see an ad for a luxury car.\n\nThe offering has been popular among local advertisers, such as car dealerships and political advertisers. But targeting using more granular data on a wider scale has required marketers to cobble together buys across a number of pay-TV distributors, reconciling different data sets.\n\nThe same held for any programmers that wanted to sell targeted ads across the country: They, too, needed to do deals with separate TV carriers to turn on the capability and iron out the differences.\n\nNCC\u2019s effort to grow addressability is a step in the right direction but still doesn\u2019t reach enough households to be practical for some major marketers, said Tracey Scheppach, co-founder and chief executive of targeted-advertising consulting firm Matter More Media. \u201cWhat we really need is universal addressability for this to work completely across all premium TV inventory.\u201d\n\nMany advertisers, meanwhile, still like national TV commercials\u2019 ability to reach large groups of people at once.\n\nNCC was created in 1981 to aggregate advertising inventory for its owners and sell it to advertisers targeting people in specific locations. Comcast, Charter and Cox today reach nearly 40 million households across various parts of the country. NCC also sells ads on behalf of a number of other pay-TV distributors, increasing its reach to 85 million households.\n\nThe new data capability will create consistency in how all three NCC owners define and present their data sets. Advertisers or programmers can find audiences using set-top-box data that incorporates attributes such as subscriber information, like location, and anonymized viewing habits, as well as third-party data sets that help identify audiences such as car buyers or pet owners.\n\nNCC sells ads on behalf of its owners in both video-on-demand and live programming, though the majority of its addressable inventory is in VOD.\n\n\u201cThe opportunity I saw at NCC was the ability to match the TV world to the digital world,\u201d said Ms. Pangis. \u201cThere are huge opportunities for buyers of media to buy differently than they have using data sets available.\u201d\n\nNCC hasn\u2019t signed any TV programmers to its new initiative but says it is in talks about ways to work together. A programmer might want to sell the targeted ad inventory on its own and only pay a fee for the capability. It also could pay for NCC\u2019s ad sales services for part or all of its commercial time.\n\nWrite to Alexandra Bruell at alexandra.bruell@wsj.com", "description": "Cable operators Comcast, Charter Communications and Cox Communications are trying to make it easier for television networks and advertisers to target commercials to specific consumer groups.", "authors": ["Alexandra Bruell", "Alexandra.Bruell Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109391/social", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
