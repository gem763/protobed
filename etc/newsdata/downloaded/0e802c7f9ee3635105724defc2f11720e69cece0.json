Last few years have been extremely difficult,\u2019 Murray said after the match.\n\nMurray was clearly emotional after the match in Antwerp (AP Photo/Francisco Seco)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Both me and Stan have had a lot of injury problems in the last couple of years.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s amazing to be back, playing against him in the final like that. I think it was a great match.\n\n\u2018Stan was playing unbelievable. I just managed to hang in a bit at the end of the second set and the third set was extremely close again.\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t expect to be in this position at all. I\u2019m happy, very happy.\n\nStan Wawrinka won the first set but could not stop Murray\u2019s comeback (AP Photo/Francisco Seco)\n\n\u2018Stan is a brilliant player. He\u2019s won many big tournaments. We know each other\u2019s games well, we\u2019ve played many tough matches in the past. I expected another one today and that\u2019s what I got.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve really enjoyed my week here. The atmosphere the last few days has been amazing.\n\n\u2018To have crowds like this over the weekend, its really important to sustain the tournament. Thank you for everyone who came out to support the event.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m very proud of the win this week.\u2019", "description": "Andy Murray admits he 'didn't expect to be in this position' after beating Stan Wawrinka to win the European Open.
