It\u2019s been a busy year for the game and developer Rockstar. The company has faced criticisms over crunch, the main game eventually released to great reviews, Red Dead Online launched to less great reviews, then got updated more and more, fans walked around with soup and a country-trap hybrid hit song used the game in a music video.\n\nHere\u2019s (almost) everything that has happened in the last year since RDR2 released.\n\nA large group of dedicated Red Dead Online fans decides to do something very strange in late September. The group gathers and walks across the whole map carrying bowls of soup. The event is hilarious, though many fail to make it to the end due to obstacles like trains and bandits.\n\nClose to a year after releasing Red Dead Redemption 2 on PS4 and Xbox One, Rockstar Games announces that the game is coming to PC. It will be available first in November on Rockstar\u2019s new game launcher as well as the Epic Game Store. In December the game will be available on Steam. The PC version will also be available on Google Stadia as a launch title. The PC port of RDR2 will include new content, such as new weapons and bounty hunter missions.\n\nOne year later and Red Dead Redemption 2 is clearly not Rockstar\u2019s main focus anymore. Instead, Red Dead Online is going to receive future updates and new content. But Red Dead Redemption 2's PC launch will most likely bring about new discoveries as players data mine the game more effectively. It will also receive wild and useful mods, just like GTA V on PC.", "description": "Red Dead Redemption 2 launched a year ago today, on October 26 2018.
