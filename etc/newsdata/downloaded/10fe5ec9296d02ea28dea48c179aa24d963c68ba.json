Over a year, they found that on days of high air pollution there was a total of 124 cardiac arrests, 231 strokes and 193 severe asthma attacks.\n\nReacting to the figures, Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, said: \u2018As these new figures show, air pollution is now causing thousands of strokes, cardiac arrests and asthma attacks, so it\u2019s clear that the climate emergency is in fact also a health emergency.\n\n\u2018Since these avoidable deaths are happening now \u2013 not in 2025 or 2050 \u2013 we need to act now.\n\n\u2018For the NHS that is going to mean further comprehensive action building on the reduction of our carbon footprint of one fifth in the past decade.\u2019\n\nThe figures are released today by health network UK100 ahead of the International Clean Air Summit in London on Wednesday. Polly Billington, director of UK100, said: \u2018Air pollution is a problem in towns and cities across the country, with children and adults being hospitalised for life threatening conditions.\n\n\u2018That is an individual tragedy for each of them, and collectively a huge burden on our NHS. Local government needs additional powers and resources to address this public health crisis.\u2019", "description": "Air pollution contributes to 36,000 deaths a year in England and causes significant health risks, it is claimed, with rates of cardiac arrests, strokes and severe asthma all rising as a result.", "authors": ["Ben Spencer Medical Correspondent For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/00/19609284-0-image-a-23_1571615627577.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
