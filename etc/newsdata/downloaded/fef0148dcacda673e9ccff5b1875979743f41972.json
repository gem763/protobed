Slowdown in global economic growth, trade-related concerns and a string of disappointing economic data are cited as the reasons for the Fed\u2019s expected dovish stance.\n\nIn such a scenario, utility, real estate, telecommunications and gold mining companies are poised to gain the most.\n\nDismal Global Growth Outlook\n\nThe IMF lowered its projections for 2019 GDP growth to 3% in October from 3.2% in July, according to the latest World Economic Outlook published earlier this month. Global trade uncertainty was cited as the chief obstacle to global economic growth.\n\nIn fact, the report also points toward the fact that the ongoing U.S.-China trade war has led to direct costs, market turbulence, and decline in investment and reduced productivity because of disruptions in supply chain.\n\nIn addition, geopolitical tensions related to Brexit could possibly reduce economic activity and hinder a likely moderate recovery in emerging markets and the eurozone.\n\nDisappointing Economic Data\n\nApart from the pessimistic view of IMF toward global growth, certain domestic economic data have also been anything but encouraging.\n\nFirst, the U.S. manufacturing sector contracted in September, with the U.S. manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index from the Institute for Supply Management coming in at 47.8%. This is the lowest reading since June 2009. In addition, new orders for manufactured durable goods in September also declined 1.1% to $248.2 billion, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nSecond, consumers are also growing less confident about the economy. This was reflected in the Conference Board\u2019s Consumer Confidence Index, which declined in September (125.1) after suffering a slight contraction in August (134.2). U.S. retail sales, also dropped for the first time in seven months, shedding 0.3% in September as households cut back their spending on building materials, motor vehicles, hobbies and online shopping.\n\nSeptember\u2019s drop in retail sales compelled economists to lower their third-quarter consumer spending growth estimates to an about 2.5% annualized rate from 3%. Finally, sales of new single???family houses also declined 0.7% in September from the revised August rate to reach a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 701,000. Sales of existing single-family homes also declined 2.2% last month.\n\nAll these factors make the case stronger for a third rate cut by the central bank in 2019.\n\nPossibility of a Rate Cut in October\n\nIn fact, the CME\u2019s Fedwatchtool, which indicates the probability of FOMC rate moves in the upcoming meetings, recently showed that about 93.5% of investors are now expecting another rate cut at the FOMC\u2019s meeting scheduled next week. This could put the Fed rate in the range of 1.50% to 1.75%.\n\nFinally, Goldman Sachs also sees a 95% possibility of a quarter-point reduction in Fed rates at the upcoming FOMC meeting. The bank largely cited fears over a global growth slowdown and trade tariffs. Sluggish inflation was mentioned by the bank too, which was well below the Fed\u2019s target of 2%.\n\nThe current Fed rates are in the range of 1.75% to 2.00%.\n\nOur Choices\n\nWe have, therefore, chosen four stocks from sectors such as utility, real estate, telecommunications and gold mining. The stocks carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\n\nThe reason behind this selection is the fact that capital-intensive, high-dividend yield\u00ecng sectors such as utility and real estate have huge infrastructure which requires constant maintenance and significant expenditure.\n\nA low interest-rate environment reduces borrowing costs for these companies, which could improve their efficiency and in turn boost their profit margins. Telecommunications is also a capital-intensive sector.\n\nIn addition, investment in gold mining stocks could yield greater returns as well. This is because Fed\u2019s easing policy and rising concerns over uncertainty in trade and economy may drive demand for safe havens like gold.\n\nKinross Gold Corporation KGC acquires, explores and develops gold properties. The company carries a Zacks Rank #1. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has risen 19.2% over the past 60 days.
