I would definitely have died without blood donors\u2019 (Picture: Siliana Coelho)\n\nSiliana Coelho filmed a video of herself writhing in pain because of her sickle cell \u2013 and the clip quickly went viral on Twitter.\n\nThe 21-year-old from Ealing, London filmed the clip in the middle of an agonising sickle cell crisis and the footage amassed 33,500 retweets, and reached 1.7 million people.\n\nIn the video you can see Siliana crying out and writhing with pain, which is common for people experiencing a sickle cell crisis. The disease makes her red blood cells form into abnormal shapes and get stuck, causing life-threatening blockages and complications.\n\nI suffer from Sickle Cell and most people can\u2019t even imagine what it feels or looks like. This is what I and others go through. Please share it and raise awareness for it, that\u2018s all I want\ud83e\udd7a\u2764\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/NyqT3pCzBW \u2014 Siliana (@ANGOLANCVNDY) October 6, 2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe hopes that by putting her pain on the internet for everyone to see, she will inspire more black people to donate blood.\n\n\u2018The pain of a normal sickle cell crisis is like your bones are being broken with hammers, it pulsates with you blood,\u2019 says Siliana.\n\n\u2018In that video I had the crisis in my chest, which is one of the worst. I felt burning and hot, and like my chest with being crushed with a pile of bricks. It was like being stabbed in the chest in time with your heartbeat.\u2019\n\nSiliana says that sickle cell effects every area of her life.\n\n\u2018The hardest thing about living with sickle cell is that I\u2019m constantly in pain,\u2019 she explains.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t have a moment to not feel anxious or paranoid. Because the condition is so unpredictable, you never know what to expect.\u2019\n\nAt the moment, Siliana is suffering with hearing and vision problems as well as knee pain because of the lack of oxygen that impacts her vital organs.\n\n\u2018It effects your mental state, you have no life,\u2019 she says. \u2018I\u2019m constantly sick in hospital, constantly wondering when is the next time I\u2019ll be back in hospital.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m unable to work because I can\u2019t even hold a stable job. I\u2019m in hospital every two weeks. Who will have me?\n\n\u2018Then your love life. It\u2019s hard to date. You always think: \u201cWho is going to love me with this condition?\u201d Because I\u2019m constantly sick.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018You don\u2019t feel that confidence or even wanting to date when you\u2019re so sick.\u2019\n\n(Picture: Siliana Coelho)\n\nSiliana, like many sickle cell patients, needs regular blood transfusions just to stay alive. She receives eight units of blood, every six weeks, at Hammersmith Hospital.\n\nShe said she shared the video to raise awareness of the disease and inspire more black to donate blood.\n\nBlood needs to be well matched but the shortage of black blood donors makes it harder to find blood for black patients. In fact, NHS Blood and Transplant needs 40,000 new black blood donors over the next three years.\n\nThe shortage of black blood donors makes it harder to find the best matched blood for black patients, and that puts black people them at risk of serious transfusion reactions.\n\n\u2018I am shocked and overwhelmed by the reaction to the video,\u2019 says Siliana. \u2018I never thought it would reach this many people. I wanted people to see what the pain is really like.\n\nWhat is sickle cell? Sickle cell is a disorder of the haemoglobin in the red blood cells. Haemoglobin is the substance in red blood cells that is responsible for the colour of the cell and for carrying oxygen around the body. People with sickle cell disorder are born with the condition, it is not contagious. It can only be inherited from both parents each having passed on the gene for sickle cell. The main symptoms of sickle cell disorder are anaemia and episodes of severe pain. The pain occurs when the cells change shape after oxygen has been released. The red blood cells then stick together, causing blockages in the small blood vessels. These painful episodes are referred to as sickle cell crisis. They are treated with strong painkillers such as morphine to control the pain. Over time people with sickle cell can experience damage to organs such as the liver, kidney, lungs, heart and spleen. Death can also result from complications of the disorder. Treatment of sickle cell mostly focuses on preventing and treating complications. The Sickle Cell Society\n\n\u2018When you say you have sickle cell people say, \u201cit\u2019s such a shame\u201d, but they don\u2019t know how bad it really is. I wanted people to see what it looks like.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe also wants to make sure people know just how much they are able to help people like her through the simple act of donating.\n\n\u2018Plenty of people do not realise the power they hold with just donation their own blood,\u2019 says Siliana. \u2018There have been crucial times where I\u2019ve needed blood. If no one donated, I don\u2019t know where I would be.\n\n(Picture: Siliana Coelho)\n\n\u2018It went viral overnight which was very shocking to me. I\u2019ve tried to like and reply to the replies but there have been so many, about 1,500 replies. A lot of people were asking how they could help and I have said they can donate blood.\n\n\u2018I feel there\u2019s a lack of awareness about blood donation in the black community and we need to do more to help the community. We also need more billboards and posters, especially in the communities where there are more black people.\u2019\n\nBecome a blood donor Register today and book and appointment by calling 0300 123 23 23, downloading the GiveBloodNHS app, or visiting www.blood.co.uk\n\nSiliana\u2019s worst crisis came in February 2018. The sickle cells blocked the blood vessels in her lungs, damaging lung tissue, and cutting the oxygen flow.\n\nShe developed Acute Chest Syndrome \u2013 which is potentially fatal \u2013 and needed an emergency red cell exchange and three weeks in hospital.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I was struggling to breathe \u2013 I would definitely have died without blood donors,\u2019 said Siliana. \u2018That was the scariest one I have had.\n\n\u2018Although the condition is often invisible, it affects us severely. Sickle cell should be categorised as a condition along with cancer and diabetes. Because it is terminal and fatal.\n\n\u2018There needs to be more care, love and compassion towards it.\u2019\n\nSiliana is studying biomedical science at university and wants to work in a sickle cell unit when she graduates.\n\nMORE: Incredible foster mum teaches the black children she cares for about their heritage and culture\n\nMORE: Incredible photoshoot showcases the honest realities of living with cancer\n\nMORE: The best Christmas markets for 2019 so you can get your festive trinkets\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Siliana shared a video of herself screaming and writhing in pain because of a sickle cell crisis to raise awareness about blood donation.", "authors": ["Natalie Morris"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/siliana-comp1_1571057004.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
