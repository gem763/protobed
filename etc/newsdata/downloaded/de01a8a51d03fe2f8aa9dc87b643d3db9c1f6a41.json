It\u2019s little wonder, then, that modern-day flora fans are searching for alternatives that last and save money in the long term while looking just as pretty.\n\n\n\nFaux flowers remain popular (we rounded up some of the best earlier this year) but there\u2019s no getting past the fact that even the most convincing aren\u2019t real. Here\u2019s where dried flowers come into play.\n\n\n\nSold in bunches, wreaths and as individual stems, this trend seems to have stemmed from the idea of creating a wedding bouquet you can keep sentimentally for longer. But there\u2019s no need to be getting married to jump on the bandwagon \u2013 many people are buying dried flowers to display around the home.\n\nAnd what\u2019s even better is that these blooms are environmentally friendly too, thanks to their long shelf life, low carbon footprint and biodegradability.\n\nTrouva, the online home of the best independent boutiques, has seen a staggering 103 per cent rise in dried flowers sales year on year, with customers \u201cgoing wild\u201d for them.\n\nBut while dried flowers have a unique rustic beauty, they are brittle and can be extremely delicate. Even the most considered packaging and postal service may damage them at least slightly. Preserved flowers, such as those from The Magic Flower Company, below, will fare better in transit. Their natural sap has been replaced with a special, plant-based liquid that keeps them looking fresh, soft and colourful for a year or more.\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to arranging, floral stylist and author Carolyn Dunster follows the Japanese philosophy of wabi-sabi, which teaches us to appreciate the imperfect beauty of nature. \u201cStay minimal and keep it monotype,\u201d she says. \u201cChoose earthenware, clay, woven and handmade containers over anything too new and shiny, wire up a simple hoop to hang above a bed or secure dried bunches onto doorknobs.\u201d\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

For the very fair price of \u00a325, you get a decently sized bunch of strawflowers, larkspur and broom that looks like it\u2019s been picked from the hedgerows and an old tin can laminated with a replica vintage label for that retro touch. Both parts come wrapped in pale peach tissue paper with the flowers already arranged and tied with a cream hessian ribbon for minimum faff. We think they\u2019d make wonderfully quirky centrepieces for a summer wedding, as well as brightening up an empty shelf where houseplants keep wilting on you.\n\nBuy now\n\nLittle Deer dried natural poppy seed head bunch: \u00a310.50, Trouva\u200b\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to be instantly struck by the sculptural beauty of these dried poppy seed heads from Brighton homeware boutique Little Deer. Each stem is 55cm long and you get 10 per bunch, with beautiful natural dissimilitude in the size, shape and texture of each.

They\u2019re delivered in a sturdy box, wrapped in brown kraft paper and bubble wrap, so don\u2019t worry about them being ruined en route. Little Deer also stocks a stunning \u2013 and currently hugely popular \u2013 range of dried pampas grass, as well as some exotic dried palm leaves.\n\nBuy now\n\nShida preserved flowers Manhattan: \u00a339, Shida Preserved Florist\n\nThe hot pink hydrangea steals the spotlight in this chic preserved bouquet.
