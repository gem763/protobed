I am not sure who was actually behind it. I don\u2019t think it had anything to do with the manager Kenny, I think it was the players who were close to Luis in the dressing room who really wanted to support their mate.\n\n\u201cMaybe I have to look at myself now and say I did not have the courage as an individual to say \u2018I am not wearing it\u2019. I don\u2019t think everyone within Liverpool Football Club thought what we was doing was right but I do think as a football club or you as a family, your first reaction is to support them even if you know that they are wrong and that is wrong.\u201d\n\nEvra said: \u201cWhen I saw it I was like this is ridiculous. This is unbelievable. You put your own club in danger when you do those things. You always have to support your player because he is from your team but this was after the ban. If it was before and we were waiting for the sanctioned, I would understand.\n\n\u201cWhat message do you send to the world? Supporting someone being banned because he used some racist words.\u201d", "description": "Jamie Carragher has apologised to Patrice Evra for the way Liverpool handled the aftermath of Luis Suarez\u2019s ban for racially abusing the Frenchman in 2011.", "authors": ["Lawrence Ostlere"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/22/00/jamie-carragher.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
