REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\n\nReuters\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump is unequivocal: He knows the art of the deal. He's the master negotiator. He'll make great deals for the US, which is why he was elected president.\n\nBut a closer look at Trump's record shows he has a pattern of caving in to foreign leaders at the United States' expense.\n\nThis week, Trump stunned allies, members of his own party, and even his own administration officials when he announced the withdrawal of US troops from northeast Syria after being backed into a corner by Turkey's president during a phone call.\n\nTrump also has a history of acceding to North Korea on denuclearization, and dropping the ball in the trade war with China.\n\nTrump's history of capitulating to foreign countries is strongest when it comes to Russia.\n\nSince taking office, he's let Russia off the hook for its global aggression; he's called for Russia's re-admittance to the G7; he's publicly sided with Russia over the US; and he's weighing withdrawing the US from a crucial treaty that protects US allies against Russia.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is unequivocal: He knows the art of the deal. He can negotiate better than anyone, and that's why he'll make great deals for the US.\n\nBut the biggest winners in Trump's latest \"deal\" are an autocratic Turkish leader, the Islamic State (ISIS), Russia, and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nAfter a phone call between Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Trump administration on Sunday abruptly announced the US would withdraw troops from northeast Syria.\n\nIn doing so, foreign policy experts said the US is effectively abandoning the Kurds, who bore the brunt of the US-led campaign against ISIS, and giving Erdogan a green light to launch a military operation in the region.\n\nThe Kurds have fought for more than 40 years for an independent state from Turkey, at the cost of thousands of lives. By pulling out of northern Syria, Trump is paving the way for Turkey and Erdogan to attack the Kurds once more, a fact he acknowledged in a tweet on Monday.\n\nWithdrawing US troops from Syria also creates a vacuum that opens the door for the resurgence of ISIS and plays right into the hands of Russia and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nTrump painted the move as being long overdue and beneficial to the US, but current and former officials say it actually damages the country's interests and its perception among key allies, an assessment that a growing, bipartisan group of lawmakers \u2014 and even some hosts on \"FOX & Friends\" \u2014 agree on.\n\nRead more: Republicans and former US officials rip into Trump for abandoning the Kurds in Syria\n\nErdogan \"definitely out-negotiated\" Trump in their call, a National Security Council official with direct knowledge of the discussion told Newsweek. Trump \"only endorsed the troop withdrawal to make it look like we are getting something \u2014 but we are not getting something.\"\n\nThe official added: \"The US national security has entered a state of increased danger for decades to come because the president has no spine, and that's the bottom line.\"\n\nBrett McGurk, Trump's former top envoy in the fight against ISIS, echoed that view.\n\n\"Donald Trump is not a Commander-in-Chief,\" McGurk said in a tweet responding to the withdrawal of troops from Syria. \"He makes impulsive decisions with no knowledge or deliberation. He sends military personnel into harm's way with no backing.\"\n\nHe added: Trump \"blusters and then leaves our allies exposed when adversaries call his bluff or he confronts a hard phone call.\"\n\nRead more: Here are all the major players in the Trump-Ukraine scandal\n\nTrump, Kim Jong Un More\n\nBRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTrump v. North Korea\n\nThis isn't the first time the US president has been criticized for acquiescing to foreign leaders at the cost of US interests.\n\nSince he took office, Trump has been fixated on convincing North Korea to tamp down its budding nuclear program. He and other US officials have had multiple meetings with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and his deputies, and Trump often points to his reputation as a dealmaker when advertising his summits with Kim.\n\nWhile Trump got a number of photo ops out of it, national security veterans warn that the US has gained few substantive commitments from North Korea and that its nuclear program shows few signs of slowing down.", "description": "Trump has a long history of caving to foreign leaders when he's backed into a corner.
