To call them roads would be a travesty; these are at best mountain paths cut out of the upper Himalayas, consisting of rocks and shifting sand, and remaining cut off by snow for eight months of the year.\n\nAn abrupt change of landscape right after crossing Rohtang Pass towards Lahaul and Spiti side catches us by surprise. The green mountains before Rohtang, now give way to their brown and arid counterparts on the leeward, rain shadow side of the Chandra Valley.\n\nAfter being mercilessly jolted over stones and rocks for miles, the sudden sight of Yari Khoksar, an idyllic looking village next to the Chandra waterfalls, makes us sit up. Nestled in the crook of the hurrying Chandra, the colourful, cultivated fields here are the only sign of vegetation we have seen since crossing the Rohtang Pass. The miniscule village consists of just two families, with a total population of 15! We focus on traversing the rest of the tricky path till we reach our destination of the day, Sissu, a beautiful village in Lahaul at around 11,000 feet elevation, boasting of a waterfall, a helipad and a beautiful lake called Goldrop.\n\nNext morning we set off for Chandertaal \u2014 the Moon Lake in Spiti, so called because it is shaped like the crescent moon. If we thought the path from Rohtang to Lahaul was bad, this was even narrower and more damaged, at times disappearing under the ice-cold waters of a waterfall rushing to fall over the cliff to join the happy river below! We drive through that, heart in mouth, a prayer on our lips. Fresh landslides or stray rocks tumbling down are not unknown in this area. At one place we get off to help push down a boulder into the river after it has rolled down in the path of a bus ahead of us.\n\nChandertaal is stunning in its aquamarine glory, seeming to lend the sky above it a unique colour. Such tranquility and beauty needs time to be absorbed; so we strike camp at 14,000 feet in temperature plummeting to between minus 6 and minus 4 \u2014 not an easy feat considering ours was a rapid climb to that elevation. Undaunted, next morning we set off on the same treacherous terrain and climb another 2000 feet to reach Kunzum pass which separates Lahaul and Spiti for a good part of the year.\n\nSpiti, which means \u2018middle land\u2019 (between Tibet and India) is a sub-Himalayan desert with extreme weather conditions, and hence, one of the least populated regions of the world. A raw, untouched beauty dominates this desert mountain valley high up in the Himalayas in the N-E part of Himachal Pradesh. And it is here in Spiti River Valley \u2014 in these mountain ranges surrounding us on all sides \u2014 that we see what has to be the world\u2019s most stunning sand and rock formations.\n\nEnjoying the stark raw beauty of the landscape for miles, we are still not prepared for the stunning artistry that centuries of snow, sand storms and passage of glaciers has created in this area, almost as if to compensate it for the lack of vegetation and humans. Words cannot do it justice; all I can say is that it is so beautiful that it seems unreal.\n\nReluctantly we leave this behind to reach Chicham, a village with just 30 families and 100 inhabitants, set amidst spectacular canyons and gorges. Unconnected till 2017, today it boasts Asia\u2019s highest bridge connecting it to the next village, Kibber. Stopping for a bit to chat with locals and admire the throbbing beauty of the place, we moved on higher to Kibber , a village at 14,500 ft in a narrow valley on top of a limestone rock, across the gorge.\n\nOur next stop is the more than 1000 year-old Kee Monastery, as much steeped in history and the culture of Spiti as everything else here is.\n\nIt is humbling to observe that the rivers that flow through this land and the majestic mountains are the same that find a mention in Vedic times and have stood the test of time. To be in the presence of such history, such raw untamed beauty and some of the world\u2019s most amazing scenery reached in one of India\u2019s most treacherous terrain, was a strange combination of an exhilarating, and yet, a humbling experience.", "description": "Driving through Lahaul and Spiti \u2014 India\u2019s most treacherous terrain steeped in beauty and timelessness \u2014 was an exhilarating but humbling experience.
