At least eight women ranging from former Capitol Hill staffers to political activists, have alleged Biden touched them in a way that made them uncomfortable or violated their personal space.\n\nBiden has yet to issue a unequivocal apology but released a video following the mounting allegations earlier this year. In the video, Biden said he would try to be more \"mindful and respectful\" of the issues going forward, but later added he was \"not sorry in the sense that I think I did anything that was intentionally designed to do anything wrong or be inappropriate.\"\n\n\"It was inappropriate that I didn't understand, that I assumed,\" Biden said on ABC's \"The View.\"\n\nRead more: 'Have the record player on at night': Joe Biden's animated response to a Democratic debate question about segregation was a head-scratcher\n\nClinton described Biden as a \"thoroughly decent human being who has served our country honorably,\" and said it was easy to isolate \"a little annoying habit or other kind of behavior\" from a public person. Instead of focusing on the alleged improprieties from Biden, Clinton advised voters to judge him based on the \"totality\" of his deeds.\n\n\"We can pick apart anybody,\" Clinton said to PEOPLE. \"I mean, that's a great spectator sport.\"\n\n\"But this man who's there in the Oval Office right now poses a clear and present danger to the future of the United States,\" Clinton added, referring to President Donald Trump. \"So get over it.\"", "description": "\"We can pick apart anybody,\" Hillary Clinton said to PEOPLE magazine. \"I mean, that's a great spectator sport.\"", "authors": ["David Choi"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d92c3842e22af51c3429928?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
