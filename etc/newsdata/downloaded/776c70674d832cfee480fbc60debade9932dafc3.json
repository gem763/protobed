Should Phoebe have ended up with David instead of Mike?).\n\nIt goes without saying, then, that people seldom agree on who the best friend was out of all six. There are the Monica die-hards. There are those who can\u2019t resist Chandler\u2019s quips. There are the fans whose dearest dream is to take a guided tour of Phoebe\u2019s whimsical brain.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Friends's top 30 episodes \u2013 from worst to best 1/30 30. \"The One with Chandler in a Box\" Season four, episode eight This list wouldn\u2019t be complete without a post dedicated to Chandler and Joey\u2019s friendship. After a multi-episode arc that sees Chandler falling for and then kissing Joey\u2019s girlfriend Kathy, the former is struggling to get his roommate to forgive him. Joey thus sentences him to spending Thanksgiving inside a wooden crate. Kathy, of course, shows up during dinner to give Chandler an emotional farewell \u2013 prompting Joey to open Chandler\u2019s box and tell his friend to go be with Kathy. Sweet. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 2/30 29. \"The One with the Cop\" Season five, episode 16 Joey thinks he\u2019s in love with Monica, Phoebe meets a police officer, but none of this matters \u2013 the beating heart of this episode is Ross\u2019s attempt to purchase a new sofa and get it to his apartment without paying the delivery fee. Rachel and Chandler agree to help him, only for Ross to repeatedly instruct them to \u201cpivot\u201d, \u201cpivot\u201d, \u201cpivot\u201d, in one of the funniest, most memorable scenes in the show\u2019s 10-year history. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 3/30 28. \"The One with the Sonogram at the End\" Season one, episode two In the second episode of Friends\u2019s first season, Ross and Susan struggle to find their places as co-parents at the onset of Carol\u2019s pregnancy. The storyline manages to address both Ross\u2019s and Susan\u2019s angst in a rather sensitive way, with a sweet denouement when both of them hold Carol\u2019s hand during her ultrasound. (Side note: Carol is played in this episode by Anita Barone, though the part ultimately went to Jane Sibbett for the rest of the show.) An unrelated scene in which Rachel brings her engagement ring back to her former fianc\u00e9 Barry (while the orthodontist\u2019s young patient awaits) delivers a nice dose of comic relief. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 4/30 27. \"The One with the Memorial Service\" Season nine, episode 17 This episode aired for the first time in 2003, and it\u2019s fascinating to see how Friends delivered its take on the beginnings of social media. Ross has discovered an alumni website for people who went to his and Chandler\u2019s college \u2013 and is understandably fascinated to find out his former crush \u201clost an ear in a boating accident\u201d and had a failed business. He and Chandler, naturally, end up posting false updates about each other. While the episode is filled with the kind of Friends jokes that haven\u2019t aged well (quips about Chandler being gay, comments about women not wanting to sleep with a weird man), Ross\u2019s need for his former classmates\u2019 attention prompts him to hold his own funeral wake \u2013 which of course doesn\u2019t go well. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 5/30 26. \"The One where Emma Cries\" Season nine, episode two As Rachel struggles to get her newborn daughter to stop crying, Ross and Joey fight over the latter\u2019s decision to propose to Rachel after she gave birth. The dispute escalates to hilarious heights when Joey begs Ross to punch him \u2013 only to dodge the blow, leaving Ross to painfully hit a pole. Things only get worse when Joey takes Ross to the hospital and asks one insulting question after the other. The punching incident is played for laughs a second time after Joey, wanting to demonstrate how natural it is to duck when a punch is approaching, ends up hitting Ross in the face. The whole thing is just goofy and classically funny. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 6/30 25. \"The One with All the Rugby\" Season four, episode 15 Ross tries to impress his English girlfriend Emily by playing rugby with her friends, and ends up rather seriously injured in the process. But the funniest plotline of the episode involves Monica, who grows increasingly obsessed by a light switch in her apartment that seemingly doesn\u2019t do anything. Courteney Cox does a wonderful job at bringing to life Monica\u2019s increasing frustration \u2013 and who can\u2019t relate to her level of dedication when it comes to solving an inane problem? Meanwhile, Chandler tries to escape his relationship with Janice by telling her he\u2019s moving abroad \u2013 specifically to 15 Yemen Road, Yemen. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 7/30 24. \"The One where Rachel Has a Baby \u2013 Part One\" Season eight, episode 23 As Rachel progresses through the phases of labour, she and Ross are left sharing their room with several couples, one after the other. There\u2019s the couple that overshares, the couple that fights (with a great guest appearance by Debi Mazar) and ultimately, Janice (Chandler\u2019s ex) with her new husband. I happen to find most TV birth episodes a bit, well, exhausting \u2013 so many times, they\u2019re an overwhelming combination of high-running emotions, screams, and physical approximations \u2013 but this one is genuinely funny. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 8/30 23. \"The One with All the Jealousy\" Season three, episode 12 Ross showers Rachel with gifts at her office, setting the stage for the pair\u2019s break-up a few episodes later. Monica strikes up a romance with her colleague Julio, who writes a poem inspired by her and titled The Empty Vase. Those make for nice sitcom moments, but Matt LeBlanc is the real star of the episode. Joey finds himself in an embarrassing situation when auditioning for a part in the Broadway play A Tale Of Two Cities and is asked to use the advanced dance skills he listed on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 \u2013 a brazen line. After failing to train a group of performers to do the instructed choreography, he is asked to perform the dance himself and winds up running away. The whole storyline is hilarious, and it\u2019s a rather original take on the lying-on-your-CV trope. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 9/30 22. \"The One with the Dirty Girl\" Season four, episode six Per the titular plot, Ross dates a woman who happens to have an extremely messy apartment. The episode\u2019s best scene, however, comes when Phoebe and Monica partner up to cater a funeral. When it seems like the widow is trying to avoid paying Monica, the latter can\u2019t work up the courage to confront her. Phoebe, however, is having none of it and delivers an impassioned speech about the importance to get paid for one\u2019s work. The moment is empowering, played for laughs, and stands out as an instance of Phoebe\u2019s trademark audacity. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 10/30 21. \"The One with the Blackout\" Season one, episode seven A power blackout in New York City might not be the most thrilling premise in the history of television, but it is brilliantly executed here. Chandler takes the cake when it turns out he\u2019s stuck with a Victoria\u2019s Secret model he admires \u2013 and his internal monologue grows increasingly panicked as he tries to interact with her. Meanwhile at Monica\u2019s apartment, Ross tries to tell Rachel he loves her but is interrupted when a cat jumps on his back. It\u2019s a lively episode that showed Friends\u2019s potential from season one. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 11/30 20. \"The One with Ross's Sandwich\" Season five, episode nine Another classic one-liner. When Ross finds out someone at work ate his Thanksgiving leftovers sandwich \u2013 \u201cthe only good going on in [his] life\u201d \u2013 he goes in a rage at work and winds up yelling at his superior, who not only ate some of the sandwich but threw the rest away. \u201cYou threw my sandwich away? MY SANDWICH! MY SANDWICH,\u201d he yells, loud enough to scare away the pigeons in the Flatiron district. To this day, \u201cRoss when he finds out his boss ate his sandwich\u201d remains the gold standard for anger among Friends fans. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 12/30 19. \"The One with Ross's Wedding \u2013 Part Two\" Season four, episode 24 Two pivotal arcs in one episode! First, Monica and Chandler sleep together for the first time after a guest at her brother\u2019s wedding mistakes her for the mother of the groom. Then, just as it looks like Rachel is finally ready to let Ross go and let him marry Emily, he says the wrong word at the altar. This was only the season four finale, yet it foreshadowed the end of the series six seasons later in more ways than one. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 13/30 18. \"The One with Ross' New Girlfriend\" Season two, episode one Ross and Rachel\u2019s on-off love story provided some of Friends\u2019s funniest, saddest, and most memorable moments. In this instance, Rachel returns from the airport, where she intended to surprise Ross and confess her feelings for him \u2013 only to find out he had reconnected with an acquaintance named Julie, now his girlfriend. Aniston\u2019s comedic talent shines as Rachel goes from one mishap to the next \u2013 falling from an airport chair, splitting her forehead open, using a bouquet of flowers to stop the bleeding, and running up the stairs to tell the other friends about Julie\u2019s arrival. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 14/30 17. \"The One where Rachel Tells...\" Season eight, episode three Ross\u2019s reaction to Rachel telling him she was pregnant with his child wasn\u2019t great, but it was funny. After a couple episodes\u2019 worth of build-up, Rachel finally feels ready to break the news to her ex \u2013 only for him to focus on his outrage upon finding out that condoms are only 97 percent effective. Jennifer Aniston delivers a great performance as the calm, confident Rachel, which contrasts brilliantly with Schwimmer\u2019s outrage as he calls the president of the condom company. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 15/30 16. \"The One with Unagi\" / \"The One with the Mix Tape\" Season six, episode 17 Who could forget \u201cunagi\u201d, the concept Ross supposedly learned during his karate training (which is actually the Japanese word for freshwater eel)? After Rachel and Phoebe take a self-defense class, Ross explains \u2013 somewhat disdainfully \u2013 that being able to defend oneself in a controlled environment is different from being able to do so when the attacker strikes by surprise. The rest of the episode sees the group trying to scare one another \u2013 adding \u201cunagi\u201d to the list of Friends catchphrases fans still reference today. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 16/30 15. \"The One with the Stripper\" Season eight, episode eight Forget about the main plot line, which centres around Monica\u2019s efforts to throw Chandler a late bachelor party and unknowingly hires a prostitute instead of a stripper. The best part of the episode \u2013 and the reason why it deserves the 15th spot on this list \u2013 is a scene in which Ross gets caught between his girlfriend Mona and Rachel\u2019s father, Dr Leonard Green, who has just found out that Rachel is pregnant to Ross\u2019s child. Ross ends up in the unfortunate position of having to explain both how much he cares for Rachel \u2013 to Dr Green \u2013 and why he doesn\u2019t want to be with her \u2013 to Mona. The situation escalates when Joey leaves a message on Ross\u2019s answering machine, accusing him of \u201cknowing something about\u201d the \u201chooker\u201d in Chandler and Monica\u2019s home. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 17/30 14. \"The One with the Embryos\" Season four, episode 12 This season four instalment has the right balance of emotion and humour. On the one hand, Phoebe goes through IVF and anxiously waits to find out whether the process was successful \u2013 knowing that her brother and his wife can only afford to try once. On the other hand, Rachel, Monica, Chandler and Joey embark on a silly contest to determine who knows the other friends best. That particular story line ends not only with Monica and Rachel having to trade apartments with Chandler and Joey \u2013 it also gave viewers a cult sequence that sees Ross going over the top as the host of the group\u2019s trivia game, and the two women losing their flat because Rachel doesn\u2019t know that Chandler\u2019s TV guide gets delivered to \u201cChanandler Bong\u201d. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 18/30 13. \"The One Where Ross Is Fine\" Season 10, episode two If you feel the need to state multiple times in a conversation that you are doing just fine, you most likely are not. Ross learns this lesson the hard way in season 10, after finding out that Rachel and Joey are dating \u2013 while he himself is in a relationship with paleontologist Charlie Wheeler (Aisha Tyler). Yes, Ross was too often a lacklustre romantic partner, but David Schwimmer is a brilliant comedian whose talents shine as he brings Ross\u2019s manic energy to life. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 19/30 12. \"The One with the Holiday Armadillo\" Season seven, episode 10 How could we possibly forget David Schwimmer\u2019s performance as the Holiday Armadillo, the character invented by Ross in an attempt to get his son Ben interested in Hanukkah? Even when Chandler comes close to unknowingly ruin his friend\u2019s efforts (by showing up dressed as Santa Claus), the episode keeps the sweet, heartwarming tone expected during the holiday season. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 20/30 11. \"The One Where Ross and Rachel Take a Break\" Season three, episode 15 Chronologically, this episode directly precedes The One with the Morning After. Rachel and Ross have a major argument due to Ross\u2019s insecure behaviour, which causes him to smother his girlfriend while she\u2019s trying to deal with a stressful situation at work. Ross tells Rachel he\u2019s \u201ctired of having a relationship with her answering machine\u201d and brings up Rachel\u2019s oft-maligned mentor Mark. What\u2019s interesting here is that Ross is getting upset over a situation he helped create in earlier seasons, by \u2013 rightfully \u2013 urging Rachel to spread her wings, become assertive, and ultimately chase a fulfilling career. The fact that he can\u2019t handle her success and its impact on their personal lives speaks volumes, and many couples might relate. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 21/30 10. \"The One with the Morning After\" Season three, episode 16 The break-up episode to rule them all. When Rachel finds out that Ross slept with someone else shortly after they decided to take a break from their relationship, she makes it clear there\u2019s no going back. Seeing the two of them split (for valid reasons!) after trying to find each other for so long is a bitter experience, but the point of no return occurs when Rachel realises the other woman was there when she visited Ross\u2019s apartment. Not to sound overly involved in the lives of these two entirely fictional people, but it\u2019s impossible to watch and not feel it all: Rachel\u2019s anger, Ross\u2019s despair as he tries and fails to fix the unfixable, and the sadness of two people who tried, tried and tried again to make it work but couldn\u2019t. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 22/30 9. \"The One with Frank Jr\" Season three, episode five Two elements land this episode a spot in the top 10. First, Phoebe tries to bond with her half-brother Frank Jr, with difficulty \u2013 and while she\u2019s understandably frustrated when she realises how little they have in common, the storyline sets the basis of their unique sibling relationship. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 23/30 8. \"The One Where No One's Ready\" Season three, episode two No, nothing groundbreaking happens in this episode. It\u2019s season three. Ross is growing increasingly frustrated because his friends \u2013 including his now-girlfriend Rachel \u2013 are taking too long to get ready for an important event. But Monica, who is distracted after hearing a message from Richard, goes through a truly agonising mishap involving her ex\u2019s answering machine, which escalates to unforeseeable heights. Plus, Rachel ends up putting Ross in his place after he yells at her in front of the rest of the group. Ross was a funny character but often a horrible boyfriend, and it\u2019s truly refreshing to see Rachel call him out on his behaviour. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 24/30 7. \"The One with Barry and Mindy's Wedding\" Season two, episode 24 Yes, Rachel\u2019s awful experience as the maid of honour at her ex-fianc\u00e9\u2019 Barry\u2019s wedding is hilarious \u2013 and it culminates with an unexpectedly uplifting rendition of \"Copacabana\". But the real stars of the episode are Monica and Richard, who end up breaking up because they don\u2019t see eye to eye when it comes to having children in the future. Their split takes viewers somewhat by surprise \u2013 Richard was, after all, ready to go through all the stages of parenting again \u201cif he had to\u201d \u2013 and rings impressively true. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 25/30 6. \"The One Where Ross and Rachel...You Know\" Season two, episode 15 It\u2019s season two. Ross and Rachel are transitioning from their initial friendship to their first attempt at a romantic relationship. Meanwhile, Monica falls in love with Richard Burke, the older ophthalmologist whom, according to many fans, she should have chosen over Chandler (and whether you agree with that take or not is entirely up to you). It\u2019s vintage Friends \u2013 and this episode set up storylines that framed the rest of the sitcom for many seasons to come. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 26/30 5. \"The One with the Birth\" Season one, episode 23 In the penultimate episode of the first season of Friends, Carol give birth to Ben, further exploring the family dynamics of Carol, Ross and Susan as co-parents. Ross and Susan\u2019s near-constant fighting causes them to get locked in a closet with Phoebe \u2013 an unlucky accident that ends up giving them the chance to bond in earnest. In short: The One with the Birth puts same-sex parenting on the map, and yes, it does so at times in a very 1995 way, but it\u2019s overall touching and tackles the theme in a rather convincing way. Plus, the side storyline that sees Joey bond with a single mother as she goes through labour shows a sweet, unexpected side of his character. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 27/30 4. \"The One Where Ross Got High\" Season six, episode nine At first glance, this isn\u2019t one of Friends\u2019s most memorable tour de forces. The Thanksgiving episode begins with the ordinary concerns \u2013 Monica doesn\u2019t want to tell her parents that she and Chandler are living together, Ross and Joey are itching to get dinner over with so they can spend time with Joey\u2019s attractive roommate Janine and her friends \u2013 but it escalates into amazing levels of absurdism. Rachel\u2019s failed trifle, which includes beef, remains a cult reference. But most memorable is Judy Geller\u2019s monologue when she puts all six friends in their places one by one, swiftly handling everyone\u2019s issues \u2013 from Monica\u2019s reluctance to tell them about her relationship with Chandler to the revelation that Ross smoked pot as a teen. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 28/30 3. \"The One with the East German Laundry Detergent\" Season one, episode five It\u2019s filled with many of the moderately funny Friends staples \u2013 Chandler\u2019s unsatisfying relationship with Janice, Joey\u2019s romantic troubles, and of course, \u201cUgly Naked Guy\u201d, Monica\u2019s neighbour from across the street \u2013 but the laundromat scene alone salvages the entire episode. What begins as an innocent attempt at learning how to wash her clothes by herself sees Rachel stand up for herself when another woman tries to steal her cart. It\u2019s not just a fundamental element of the character journey that sees her grow from a spoiled young woman who has never had to fend for herself into an accomplished professional and capable parent. It\u2019s also a moment that will ring true to many who have moved to New York over the course of their lives: the city, because it\u2019s so big, overpopulated and filled with overachievers, has a way of teaching even the most timid of wallflowers how to advocate for themselves. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 29/30 2. \"The One Hundredth / The One with the Triplets\" Season five, episode three Lisa Kudrow carries this season five episode \u2013 which, as one of its two titles suggests, was the 100th of the show, on her shoulders as Phoebe, who agreed to be her brother\u2019s surrogate, gives birth to triplets. Kudrow gives a memorable performance as Phoebe\u2019s feelings escalate from fear (while she readies herself for contractions), to frustration (when her doctor turns out to be an overly dedicated fan of the Happy Days character Fonzie) and, finally, to sadness (when her last-minute request to keep one of the babies fails to materialise). It\u2019s a touching take on surrogacy, which manages to address some of its emotional entanglements while still showing how Phoebe can move on with her life and find her place as the babies\u2019 aunt. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 30/30 1. \"The One with the Lesbian Wedding\" Season two, episode 11 In 1996, The One with the Lesbian Wedding gave viewers the first same-sex wedding between two women shown on network television. Sure, the episode itself isn\u2019t without flaws (some might argue that Carol and Susan\u2019s wedding remained fundamentally heteronormative) but it remains one of the milestones from Friends\u2019s legacy. It\u2019s also moving and plants the seeds for some of the most enduring character arcs of the show, from Joey\u2019s soap opera career to Monica\u2019s professional woes and Rachel\u2019s evolving family dynamics (beginning with her parents\u2019 divorce). Phoebe\u2019s storyline, which sees her supposedly possessed by the spirit of a recently deceased elderly massage client, is full of her character\u2019s trademark whimsy and quirkiness. This is, in many ways, the quintessential Friends episode. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 1/30 30. \"The One with Chandler in a Box\" Season four, episode eight This list wouldn\u2019t be complete without a post dedicated to Chandler and Joey\u2019s friendship. After a multi-episode arc that sees Chandler falling for and then kissing Joey\u2019s girlfriend Kathy, the former is struggling to get his roommate to forgive him. Joey thus sentences him to spending Thanksgiving inside a wooden crate. Kathy, of course, shows up during dinner to give Chandler an emotional farewell \u2013 prompting Joey to open Chandler\u2019s box and tell his friend to go be with Kathy. Sweet. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 2/30 29. \"The One with the Cop\" Season five, episode 16 Joey thinks he\u2019s in love with Monica, Phoebe meets a police officer, but none of this matters \u2013 the beating heart of this episode is Ross\u2019s attempt to purchase a new sofa and get it to his apartment without paying the delivery fee. Rachel and Chandler agree to help him, only for Ross to repeatedly instruct them to \u201cpivot\u201d, \u201cpivot\u201d, \u201cpivot\u201d, in one of the funniest, most memorable scenes in the show\u2019s 10-year history. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 3/30 28. \"The One with the Sonogram at the End\" Season one, episode two In the second episode of Friends\u2019s first season, Ross and Susan struggle to find their places as co-parents at the onset of Carol\u2019s pregnancy. The storyline manages to address both Ross\u2019s and Susan\u2019s angst in a rather sensitive way, with a sweet denouement when both of them hold Carol\u2019s hand during her ultrasound. (Side note: Carol is played in this episode by Anita Barone, though the part ultimately went to Jane Sibbett for the rest of the show.) An unrelated scene in which Rachel brings her engagement ring back to her former fianc\u00e9 Barry (while the orthodontist\u2019s young patient awaits) delivers a nice dose of comic relief. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 4/30 27. \"The One with the Memorial Service\" Season nine, episode 17 This episode aired for the first time in 2003, and it\u2019s fascinating to see how Friends delivered its take on the beginnings of social media. Ross has discovered an alumni website for people who went to his and Chandler\u2019s college \u2013 and is understandably fascinated to find out his former crush \u201clost an ear in a boating accident\u201d and had a failed business. He and Chandler, naturally, end up posting false updates about each other. While the episode is filled with the kind of Friends jokes that haven\u2019t aged well (quips about Chandler being gay, comments about women not wanting to sleep with a weird man), Ross\u2019s need for his former classmates\u2019 attention prompts him to hold his own funeral wake \u2013 which of course doesn\u2019t go well. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 5/30 26. \"The One where Emma Cries\" Season nine, episode two As Rachel struggles to get her newborn daughter to stop crying, Ross and Joey fight over the latter\u2019s decision to propose to Rachel after she gave birth. The dispute escalates to hilarious heights when Joey begs Ross to punch him \u2013 only to dodge the blow, leaving Ross to painfully hit a pole. Things only get worse when Joey takes Ross to the hospital and asks one insulting question after the other. The punching incident is played for laughs a second time after Joey, wanting to demonstrate how natural it is to duck when a punch is approaching, ends up hitting Ross in the face. The whole thing is just goofy and classically funny. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 6/30 25. \"The One with All the Rugby\" Season four, episode 15 Ross tries to impress his English girlfriend Emily by playing rugby with her friends, and ends up rather seriously injured in the process. But the funniest plotline of the episode involves Monica, who grows increasingly obsessed by a light switch in her apartment that seemingly doesn\u2019t do anything. Courteney Cox does a wonderful job at bringing to life Monica\u2019s increasing frustration \u2013 and who can\u2019t relate to her level of dedication when it comes to solving an inane problem? Meanwhile, Chandler tries to escape his relationship with Janice by telling her he\u2019s moving abroad \u2013 specifically to 15 Yemen Road, Yemen. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 7/30 24. \"The One where Rachel Has a Baby \u2013 Part One\" Season eight, episode 23 As Rachel progresses through the phases of labour, she and Ross are left sharing their room with several couples, one after the other. There\u2019s the couple that overshares, the couple that fights (with a great guest appearance by Debi Mazar) and ultimately, Janice (Chandler\u2019s ex) with her new husband. I happen to find most TV birth episodes a bit, well, exhausting \u2013 so many times, they\u2019re an overwhelming combination of high-running emotions, screams, and physical approximations \u2013 but this one is genuinely funny. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 8/30 23. \"The One with All the Jealousy\" Season three, episode 12 Ross showers Rachel with gifts at her office, setting the stage for the pair\u2019s break-up a few episodes later. Monica strikes up a romance with her colleague Julio, who writes a poem inspired by her and titled The Empty Vase. Those make for nice sitcom moments, but Matt LeBlanc is the real star of the episode. Joey finds himself in an embarrassing situation when auditioning for a part in the Broadway play A Tale Of Two Cities and is asked to use the advanced dance skills he listed on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 \u2013 a brazen line. After failing to train a group of performers to do the instructed choreography, he is asked to perform the dance himself and winds up running away. The whole storyline is hilarious, and it\u2019s a rather original take on the lying-on-your-CV trope. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 9/30 22. \"The One with the Dirty Girl\" Season four, episode six Per the titular plot, Ross dates a woman who happens to have an extremely messy apartment. The episode\u2019s best scene, however, comes when Phoebe and Monica partner up to cater a funeral. When it seems like the widow is trying to avoid paying Monica, the latter can\u2019t work up the courage to confront her. Phoebe, however, is having none of it and delivers an impassioned speech about the importance to get paid for one\u2019s work.

Netflix / Warner Bros Television 10/30 21. \"The One with the Blackout\" Season one, episode seven A power blackout in New York City might not be the most thrilling premise in the history of television, but it is brilliantly executed here. Chandler takes the cake when it turns out he\u2019s stuck with a Victoria\u2019s Secret model he admires \u2013 and his internal monologue grows increasingly panicked as he tries to interact with her. Meanwhile at Monica\u2019s apartment, Ross tries to tell Rachel he loves her but is interrupted when a cat jumps on his back. It\u2019s a lively episode that showed Friends\u2019s potential from season one. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 11/30 20. \"The One with Ross's Sandwich\" Season five, episode nine Another classic one-liner. When Ross finds out someone at work ate his Thanksgiving leftovers sandwich \u2013 \u201cthe only good going on in [his] life\u201d \u2013 he goes in a rage at work and winds up yelling at his superior, who not only ate some of the sandwich but threw the rest away. \u201cYou threw my sandwich away? MY SANDWICH! MY SANDWICH,\u201d he yells, loud enough to scare away the pigeons in the Flatiron district. To this day, \u201cRoss when he finds out his boss ate his sandwich\u201d remains the gold standard for anger among Friends fans. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 12/30 19. \"The One with Ross's Wedding \u2013 Part Two\" Season four, episode 24 Two pivotal arcs in one episode! First, Monica and Chandler sleep together for the first time after a guest at her brother\u2019s wedding mistakes her for the mother of the groom. Then, just as it looks like Rachel is finally ready to let Ross go and let him marry Emily, he says the wrong word at the altar. This was only the season four finale, yet it foreshadowed the end of the series six seasons later in more ways than one. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 13/30 18. \"The One with Ross' New Girlfriend\" Season two, episode one Ross and Rachel\u2019s on-off love story provided some of Friends\u2019s funniest, saddest, and most memorable moments. In this instance, Rachel returns from the airport, where she intended to surprise Ross and confess her feelings for him \u2013 only to find out he had reconnected with an acquaintance named Julie, now his girlfriend. Aniston\u2019s comedic talent shines as Rachel goes from one mishap to the next \u2013 falling from an airport chair, splitting her forehead open, using a bouquet of flowers to stop the bleeding, and running up the stairs to tell the other friends about Julie\u2019s arrival. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 14/30 17. \"The One where Rachel Tells...\" Season eight, episode three Ross\u2019s reaction to Rachel telling him she was pregnant with his child wasn\u2019t great, but it was funny. After a couple episodes\u2019 worth of build-up, Rachel finally feels ready to break the news to her ex \u2013 only for him to focus on his outrage upon finding out that condoms are only 97 percent effective. Jennifer Aniston delivers a great performance as the calm, confident Rachel, which contrasts brilliantly with Schwimmer\u2019s outrage as he calls the president of the condom company. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 15/30 16. \"The One with Unagi\" / \"The One with the Mix Tape\" Season six, episode 17 Who could forget \u201cunagi\u201d, the concept Ross supposedly learned during his karate training (which is actually the Japanese word for freshwater eel)? After Rachel and Phoebe take a self-defense class, Ross explains \u2013 somewhat disdainfully \u2013 that being able to defend oneself in a controlled environment is different from being able to do so when the attacker strikes by surprise. The rest of the episode sees the group trying to scare one another \u2013 adding \u201cunagi\u201d to the list of Friends catchphrases fans still reference today. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 16/30 15. \"The One with the Stripper\" Season eight, episode eight Forget about the main plot line, which centres around Monica\u2019s efforts to throw Chandler a late bachelor party and unknowingly hires a prostitute instead of a stripper. The best part of the episode \u2013 and the reason why it deserves the 15th spot on this list \u2013 is a scene in which Ross gets caught between his girlfriend Mona and Rachel\u2019s father, Dr Leonard Green, who has just found out that Rachel is pregnant to Ross\u2019s child. Ross ends up in the unfortunate position of having to explain both how much he cares for Rachel \u2013 to Dr Green \u2013 and why he doesn\u2019t want to be with her \u2013 to Mona. The situation escalates when Joey leaves a message on Ross\u2019s answering machine, accusing him of \u201cknowing something about\u201d the \u201chooker\u201d in Chandler and Monica\u2019s home. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 17/30 14. \"The One with the Embryos\" Season four, episode 12 This season four instalment has the right balance of emotion and humour. On the one hand, Phoebe goes through IVF and anxiously waits to find out whether the process was successful \u2013 knowing that her brother and his wife can only afford to try once. On the other hand, Rachel, Monica, Chandler and Joey embark on a silly contest to determine who knows the other friends best. That particular story line ends not only with Monica and Rachel having to trade apartments with Chandler and Joey \u2013 it also gave viewers a cult sequence that sees Ross going over the top as the host of the group\u2019s trivia game, and the two women losing their flat because Rachel doesn\u2019t know that Chandler\u2019s TV guide gets delivered to \u201cChanandler Bong\u201d. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 18/30 13. \"The One Where Ross Is Fine\" Season 10, episode two If you feel the need to state multiple times in a conversation that you are doing just fine, you most likely are not. Ross learns this lesson the hard way in season 10, after finding out that Rachel and Joey are dating \u2013 while he himself is in a relationship with paleontologist Charlie Wheeler (Aisha Tyler). Yes, Ross was too often a lacklustre romantic partner, but David Schwimmer is a brilliant comedian whose talents shine as he brings Ross\u2019s manic energy to life. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 19/30 12. \"The One with the Holiday Armadillo\" Season seven, episode 10 How could we possibly forget David Schwimmer\u2019s performance as the Holiday Armadillo, the character invented by Ross in an attempt to get his son Ben interested in Hanukkah? Even when Chandler comes close to unknowingly ruin his friend\u2019s efforts (by showing up dressed as Santa Claus), the episode keeps the sweet, heartwarming tone expected during the holiday season. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 20/30 11. \"The One Where Ross and Rachel Take a Break\" Season three, episode 15 Chronologically, this episode directly precedes The One with the Morning After. Rachel and Ross have a major argument due to Ross\u2019s insecure behaviour, which causes him to smother his girlfriend while she\u2019s trying to deal with a stressful situation at work. Ross tells Rachel he\u2019s \u201ctired of having a relationship with her answering machine\u201d and brings up Rachel\u2019s oft-maligned mentor Mark. What\u2019s interesting here is that Ross is getting upset over a situation he helped create in earlier seasons, by \u2013 rightfully \u2013 urging Rachel to spread her wings, become assertive, and ultimately chase a fulfilling career. The fact that he can\u2019t handle her success and its impact on their personal lives speaks volumes, and many couples might relate. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 21/30 10. \"The One with the Morning After\" Season three, episode 16 The break-up episode to rule them all. When Rachel finds out that Ross slept with someone else shortly after they decided to take a break from their relationship, she makes it clear there\u2019s no going back. Seeing the two of them split (for valid reasons!) after trying to find each other for so long is a bitter experience, but the point of no return occurs when Rachel realises the other woman was there when she visited Ross\u2019s apartment. Not to sound overly involved in the lives of these two entirely fictional people, but it\u2019s impossible to watch and not feel it all: Rachel\u2019s anger, Ross\u2019s despair as he tries and fails to fix the unfixable, and the sadness of two people who tried, tried and tried again to make it work but couldn\u2019t. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 22/30 9. \"The One with Frank Jr\" Season three, episode five Two elements land this episode a spot in the top 10. First, Phoebe tries to bond with her half-brother Frank Jr, with difficulty \u2013 and while she\u2019s understandably frustrated when she realises how little they have in common, the storyline sets the basis of their unique sibling relationship. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 23/30 8. \"The One Where No One's Ready\" Season three, episode two No, nothing groundbreaking happens in this episode. It\u2019s season three. Ross is growing increasingly frustrated because his friends \u2013 including his now-girlfriend Rachel \u2013 are taking too long to get ready for an important event. But Monica, who is distracted after hearing a message from Richard, goes through a truly agonising mishap involving her ex\u2019s answering machine, which escalates to unforeseeable heights. Plus, Rachel ends up putting Ross in his place after he yells at her in front of the rest of the group. Ross was a funny character but often a horrible boyfriend, and it\u2019s truly refreshing to see Rachel call him out on his behaviour. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 24/30 7. \"The One with Barry and Mindy's Wedding\" Season two, episode 24 Yes, Rachel\u2019s awful experience as the maid of honour at her ex-fianc\u00e9\u2019 Barry\u2019s wedding is hilarious \u2013 and it culminates with an unexpectedly uplifting rendition of \"Copacabana\". But the real stars of the episode are Monica and Richard, who end up breaking up because they don\u2019t see eye to eye when it comes to having children in the future. Their split takes viewers somewhat by surprise \u2013 Richard was, after all, ready to go through all the stages of parenting again \u201cif he had to\u201d \u2013 and rings impressively true. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 25/30 6. \"The One Where Ross and Rachel...You Know\" Season two, episode 15 It\u2019s season two. Ross and Rachel are transitioning from their initial friendship to their first attempt at a romantic relationship. Meanwhile, Monica falls in love with Richard Burke, the older ophthalmologist whom, according to many fans, she should have chosen over Chandler (and whether you agree with that take or not is entirely up to you). It\u2019s vintage Friends \u2013 and this episode set up storylines that framed the rest of the sitcom for many seasons to come. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 26/30 5. \"The One with the Birth\" Season one, episode 23 In the penultimate episode of the first season of Friends, Carol give birth to Ben, further exploring the family dynamics of Carol, Ross and Susan as co-parents. Ross and Susan\u2019s near-constant fighting causes them to get locked in a closet with Phoebe \u2013 an unlucky accident that ends up giving them the chance to bond in earnest. In short: The One with the Birth puts same-sex parenting on the map, and yes, it does so at times in a very 1995 way, but it\u2019s overall touching and tackles the theme in a rather convincing way. Plus, the side storyline that sees Joey bond with a single mother as she goes through labour shows a sweet, unexpected side of his character. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 27/30 4. \"The One Where Ross Got High\" Season six, episode nine At first glance, this isn\u2019t one of Friends\u2019s most memorable tour de forces. The Thanksgiving episode begins with the ordinary concerns \u2013 Monica doesn\u2019t want to tell her parents that she and Chandler are living together, Ross and Joey are itching to get dinner over with so they can spend time with Joey\u2019s attractive roommate Janine and her friends \u2013 but it escalates into amazing levels of absurdism. Rachel\u2019s failed trifle, which includes beef, remains a cult reference. But most memorable is Judy Geller\u2019s monologue when she puts all six friends in their places one by one, swiftly handling everyone\u2019s issues \u2013 from Monica\u2019s reluctance to tell them about her relationship with Chandler to the revelation that Ross smoked pot as a teen. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 28/30 3. \"The One with the East German Laundry Detergent\" Season one, episode five It\u2019s filled with many of the moderately funny Friends staples \u2013 Chandler\u2019s unsatisfying relationship with Janice, Joey\u2019s romantic troubles, and of course, \u201cUgly Naked Guy\u201d, Monica\u2019s neighbour from across the street \u2013 but the laundromat scene alone salvages the entire episode. What begins as an innocent attempt at learning how to wash her clothes by herself sees Rachel stand up for herself when another woman tries to steal her cart. It\u2019s not just a fundamental element of the character journey that sees her grow from a spoiled young woman who has never had to fend for herself into an accomplished professional and capable parent. It\u2019s also a moment that will ring true to many who have moved to New York over the course of their lives: the city, because it\u2019s so big, overpopulated and filled with overachievers, has a way of teaching even the most timid of wallflowers how to advocate for themselves. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 29/30 2. \"The One Hundredth / The One with the Triplets\" Season five, episode three Lisa Kudrow carries this season five episode \u2013 which, as one of its two titles suggests, was the 100th of the show, on her shoulders as Phoebe, who agreed to be her brother\u2019s surrogate, gives birth to triplets. Kudrow gives a memorable performance as Phoebe\u2019s feelings escalate from fear (while she readies herself for contractions), to frustration (when her doctor turns out to be an overly dedicated fan of the Happy Days character Fonzie) and, finally, to sadness (when her last-minute request to keep one of the babies fails to materialise). It\u2019s a touching take on surrogacy, which manages to address some of its emotional entanglements while still showing how Phoebe can move on with her life and find her place as the babies\u2019 aunt. Netflix / Warner Bros Television 30/30 1. \"The One with the Lesbian Wedding\" Season two, episode 11 In 1996, The One with the Lesbian Wedding gave viewers the first same-sex wedding between two women shown on network television. Sure, the episode itself isn\u2019t without flaws (some might argue that Carol and Susan\u2019s wedding remained fundamentally heteronormative) but it remains one of the milestones from Friends\u2019s legacy. It\u2019s also moving and plants the seeds for some of the most enduring character arcs of the show, from Joey\u2019s soap opera career to Monica\u2019s professional woes and Rachel\u2019s evolving family dynamics (beginning with her parents\u2019 divorce). Phoebe\u2019s storyline, which sees her supposedly possessed by the spirit of a recently deceased elderly massage client, is full of her character\u2019s trademark whimsy and quirkiness. This is, in many ways, the quintessential Friends episode. Netflix / Warner Bros Television\n\n6. Joey Tribbiani\u200b\n\nFunniness: 3/5\n\nSure, over the years, Joey provided the show with some of its best-known one-liners (see: \u201cJoey doesn\u2019t share food!\u201d and \u201cHow you doin\u2019?\u201d). He was also a recurrent source of situational comedy (see: Joey locking himself into his media unit to prove a point, only for all his and Chandler\u2019s belongings to get stolen). Still, it\u2019s hard to compare his goofiness to Chandler\u2019s dry one-liners or Phoebe\u2019s knack for the absurd.\n\nLikeability: 4/5\n\nWhether he was rushing a pregnant Rachel to the ER, helping new head chef Monica win over her kitchen staff, or going vegetarian throughout Phoebe\u2019s pregnancy (because she was craving meat despite her principles), Joey was possibly the sweetest of all six friends (I said 'possibly'). Yes, he had occasional misgivings (such as his bigoted reaction when his sister Dina announced her pregnancy), and his overall track record on women is, well, terrible (though he did attempt to atone for his terrible approach to dating later on in the show by calling all his exes and apologising to them). But you do get the sense that he was overall trying his best to do right by those he loved.\n\nDrama potential: 2/5\n\nPerhaps owing to Joey\u2019s easy-going nature, he was often relegated to secondary plots, as opposed to the main event (with some exceptions, such as his major fallout with Chandler in season two and his ill-timed crush on Rachel in seasons nine and 10). For that reason, Joey wasn\u2019t the biggest purveyor of drama on the show \u2013 and while that might make him easier to befriend in real life, it does slightly play against him as a fictional character.\n\nOverall score: 3/5\n\nYes, we are as shocked as you are to see Joey tumble to the bottom of this ranking, but the numbers have spoken.\n\n5. Ross Geller (tie)\n\nFunniness: 4/5\n\nMore often than not, Ross was funny despite himself (like when he got stuck with his leather pants around his ankles while on a date, or when he placed an irate phone call to a condom manufacturer after Rachel told him she was pregnant with their child). Still, as a character, he was regularly hilarious, and David Schwimmer brought Ross\u2019s brand of comedy to life in an admirable manner.\n\nLikeability: 2/5\n\nRoss probably thought he was a good guy, but his record shows otherwise. He cheated on Rachel (no, they were not on a break) then tried to get her back; he dated one of his students; he challenged Phoebe\u2019s belief that her mother had been reincarnated in a cat (which, sure, he\u2019s entitled to his doubts, but could he not just drop it?); and he wasn\u2019t the best brother to Monica, nor was he the best father to Ben. Ross, you were selfish, irascible and emotionally immature, and for that, you get a two.\n\nDrama potential: 4/5\n\nRoss\u2019s tortured relationship with Rachel provided most of the emotional backbone in many seasons of Friends. Add to that the evolution of his relationship with his ex-wife Carol (and with Carol\u2019s wife Susan), his disastrous wedding to Emily during which he said the wrong name at the altar, and his emotional breakdown in season five, and you can\u2019t deny that Ross\u2019s life was as dramatic as the 2017 Oscars (aka The One When They Wrongly Announced La La Land As Best Picture).\n\nOverall score: 3.3/5\n\nSeems fair.\n\n5. Monica Geller (tie)\n\nFunniness: 2/5\n\nThis might be an unpopular opinion, since Monica is such a beloved character, but: I have never found her laugh-out-loud funny. Sure, her excessive competitiveness and cleanliness were amusing, but it was no match for Phoebe\u2019s otherworldliness or Chandler\u2019s bitterness. Sorry.\n\nLikeability: 5/5\n\nLet\u2019s all remember that it\u2019s Monica who let Rachel into the group, which, from what we gather about Rachel\u2019s past self, took a lot of forgiveness and understanding. Generally, Monica often showed an ability to look past other people\u2019s misgivings \u2013 and let\u2019s not forget that she let Rachel use the first name Emma for her own daughter, when she had planned on using it for years.\n\nDrama potential: 3/5\n\nMonica\u2019s careers choices provided their ups and downs, and her relationships were certainly a source of upset \u2013 many still believe she should have ended up with Richard instead of Chandler, for example. But just like her husband Chandler, you always had a sense that Monica would be all right in the end, and while that\u2019s not a bad thing, it does mean that her potential for drama was slightly lower than, say, Phoebe\u2019s.\n\nOverall score: 3.3/5\n\nMonice shares the same rating as her brother Ross.\n\n3. Rachel Green\n\nFunniness: 4/5\n\nRachel had her moments \u2013 and boy, were they great moments. She sang \u201cCopacabana\u201d in that terrible bridesmaid dress at her ex-fiance\u2019s Barry\u2019s wedding, for one. She fell violently to the ground while trying to escape from Ross and his new girlfriend Julie during an ill-fated attempt to welcome Ross at the airport. She unsuccessfully tried to woo her crush Joshua with a cheerleading routine at a party. Let\u2019s make it official: Rachel was a hoot.\n\nLikeability: 3/5\n\nAs we all know, Rachel grew throughout the show from a spoiled, sheltered young woman to a capable person with a successful career and the ability to advocate for herself in her personal life. This also means she became progressively less selfish \u2013 such as when she tried to help her sister Jill (Reese Witherspoon) after their father cut her off, or when she demonstrated patience and maturity when confronted to her other, just as terrible sister Amy (Christina Applegate).\n\nDrama potential: 4/5\n\nThe way Jennifer Aniston brought Rachel\u2019s sorrow to life during her break-up with Ross earns Rachel major points. Ditto Rachel\u2019s infamous decision to leave New York City for Paris (and to then get off the plane!). Ditto Rachel\u2019s pregnancy in season eight (just try to remember that for several episodes, we had no idea who the father was).\n\nOverall score: 3.6/5\n\nAgain, this seems fair.\n\n2. Chandler Bing\n\nFunniness: 5/5\n\nChandler\u2019s friends derided Chandler\u2019s humour \u2013 undeservedly so. The man was a master at banter. Sure, he used it as a defence mechanism, but who could blame him? Plus, he wasn\u2019t great at the advice, but he could always provide a sarcastic comment.\n\nLikeability: 4/5\n\nChandler bankrolled Joey\u2019s career for years. He felt terrible when he fell for Joey\u2019s girlfriend Kathy (and spent Thanksgiving in a box as penance). He fell hard for Monica and was overall a supportive husband to her (yes, with some exceptions), including through their struggle to conceive then adopt children. Chandler\u2019s problematic treatment of his \u201cdad\u201d (which we have discussed time and time again) and his occasional bout of fatphobia are two of the reasons why he doesn\u2019t get a 5/5 in this category.\n\nDrama potential: 3/5\n\nCertainly, Chandler\u2019s once-secret relationship with Monica was a major topic of intrigue. His marriage, and the lead-up to it, wasn\u2019t devoid of drama either. Yet, Chandler didn\u2019t always have the most colourful storylines, perhaps because he was the one who got his act together most of the time. Great for him, but not so great for his score in this category.\n\nOverall score: 4/5\n\nBeing a close second in any ranking feels like a very Chandler Bing move, so I\u2019m happy with this.\n\n1. Phoebe Buffay\u200b\n\nFunniness: 4/5\n\nPhoebe was so wonderfully weird in a way that made her one of the funniest of the bunch. Remember when she sang along to Ross\u2019s terrible attempt at playing the bagpipes? What about when she told Rachel her maternity trousers would be great for shoplifting melons? Good times.\n\nLikeability: 3.5/5\n\nPhoebe was the most straight-talking of all the friends, and (perhaps owing to her rough upbringing) she had no patience for their silly problems. This does mean she has less of a soft spot, although it makes her an absolute petty role model (the kind of person who can answer the question: \u201cYou wanna help?\u201d with \u201cI wish I could, but I don\u2019t want to\u201d). Still, she was a strongly principled person, meaning she usually tried to do the right thing for her loved ones \u2013 even when said loved ones were a bunch of orphaned rat babies.\n\nDrama potential: 5/5\n\nA long-lost brother? A triple surrogate pregnancy? A scientist soul mate living in Minsk for the advancement of humanity? A hidden biological mother? An estranged father? A tough childhood on the streets? Need I go on?\n\nOverall score: 4.1/5\n\nOur winner.
