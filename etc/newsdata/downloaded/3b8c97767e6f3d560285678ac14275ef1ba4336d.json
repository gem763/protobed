In New York City, the Department of Education has given its stamp of approval to the walk-out and won\u2019t mark it as an absence, making it less \u201ca strike\u201d and more a coordinated effort by the school system to force political action on children.\n\nTweeted DOE: \u201cWe applaud our students when they raise their voices in a safe and respectful manner on issues that matter to them.\u201d Does it? The department is only giving kids a pass to skip school to protest on this one issue. So while school brass may applaud students raising their voices, only preapproved political posturing will be granted official protest status.\n\nSure: Children are our future, goes the adage. Shouldn\u2019t they have a say in what happens to their planet?\n\nBut what \u201csay\u201d are they having by marching around with signs \u2014 repeating slogans and talking points spoon-fed to them by \u2026 adults?\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio tweeted about the strike on Monday, \u201cYoung people are taking action against Climate Change in record numbers. You know why? BECAUSE. WASHINGTON. WON\u2019T. We are running out of time. Our kids aren\u2019t waiting. We can\u2019t either. #ClimateStrike\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s hard to ignore that in this call for action there\u2019s no, well, action. They\u2019re literally doing what they\u2019re urging politicians to stop doing: talking.\n\nWe could have had an army of teenagers cleaning up parks or beaches instead of striking and making signs. Teens could have led the way by not using cars or plastic utensils for the day.\n\nOr how about something as simple as this: Give up their phones for a day (or, heck, 15 minutes!) to save energy. (Right!)\n\nInstead, expect stories on Saturday about how much garbage the protesting kids left behind.\n\nIn my Russian-speaking community, people took to Facebook to discuss the similarities they saw to their time in the Soviet Union. One mom posted that the strike is \u201cSoviet-style brainwashing and propaganda\u201d Another mom wrote that the particular issue doesn\u2019t matter; \u201chaving children demonstrate on school time was the Soviet way.\u201d\n\nOne Park Slope elementary school sent parents a note that the entire school will be walking out for the strike. A mother of a 6-year-old told me, in response: \u201cI am all for people supporting causes they believe in, but do not force your causes and beliefs on my first-grader.\u201d\n\nAnother mom told me she believes in climate change and thinks the government should take action but finds the strike absurd. She\u2019s afraid to single her kid out by making him skip it and isn\u2019t speaking up.\n\nIn America in 2019, it really ought to be OK for parents to say: \u201cMy kids are not your props and, no, it\u2019s not OK for them to spend school time making climate-change signs or walking out in protest.\u201d\n\nMemo to DOE: Some parents would actually prefer their kids to be in class learning than taking part in one-sided political theater (though, it\u2019s true, at some schools kids who strike won\u2019t be missing much).\n\nNor should parents be put on the spot and have to declare whether they want their kid to attend the organized protest. This isn\u2019t a school subject. It\u2019s not standardized testing or dissecting a frog. Parents shouldn\u2019t even have to opt in to have their child attend (and whether even that should be allowed is arguable).\n\nIn any event, the real test to see if kids care about the Climate Strike would be to do it after school or on a weekend. After all, almost any teen will agree to skip school, no matter the cause. But every grown-up knows that far fewer teens would spend their free time protesting than school time.\n\nFact is, teenagers should be learning how to be adults and learning adult skills \u2014 not just mimicking actions of the adults in their orbit to gain their approval.\n\nI believe climate change is real and we must deal with it. I teach my children to be good stewards of the environment. But that\u2019s separate from allowing them to be exploited for political goals \u2014 even if I happen to agree with the mission.\n\nSticking kids with the job of solving climate change or even just using them as puppets is deeply inappropriate.\n\nDe Blasio tweeted: \u201cNew York City stands with our young people. They\u2019re our conscience.\u201d Maybe adults should have their own conscience.\n\nTwitter: @Karol", "description": "I believe climate change is real and we must deal with it.
