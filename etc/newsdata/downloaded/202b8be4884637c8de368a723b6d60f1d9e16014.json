On Wednesday it was over $23 a share.\n\nPro Medicus develops and sells systems for radiologists, mainly in the United States though also in Australia, that allow doctors to view two-dimensional or three-dimensional scans on one system, as well as pull up patient records. It also offers a billing and administration system for doctors, a product that is mainly sold in the local market.\n\n\"There's always a risk,\" Mr Hupert said in response to a question about whether competitors can replicate the technology and systems.\n\n\"We believe we are 18 to 24 months ahead of the competition. We don't know of anyone at this point that has been able to match the functionality or the speed or the scalability of what we do.\"\n\nMr Hupert attributed a large part of the company's success to the unusual combination of a tech expert and a medical doctor founding a business.\n\nPro Medicus' big break came in the depths of the global financial crisis. Hupert and Hall had realised they needed to develop their own technology and were scouring the world for the right acquisition to do so.\n\nUnlike many companies, they didn't have any debt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's in our DNA to be conservative,\" Mr Hupert said.\n\nThey got close to finalising one transaction, though it fell over at the last minute. Then out of the blue came a call from a chief executive they had met at the annual Chicago RSNA [Radiological Society of North America] conference: their buyer had dropped out, would Pro Medicus still be interested in the business?\n\nSo in January 2009. the company acquired the loss-making Visage unit from the Nasdaq-listed Mercury Computer Systems in a transaction worth about $5 million.\n\n\"There were very different times during the GFC. And there were strange anomalies, of which Visage was one,\" said Mr Hupert.\n\nBuying the company at a bargain basement price was one win. Three years later, Pro Medicus would sell off part of its first acquisition for $15 million.\n\nBut the real success was buying a company that had developers who understood what Pro Medicus was trying to do, and had the same approach.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome 85 per cent or 90 per cent of that development team remains with the company nearly 10 years on, according to Mr Hupert.\n\n\"When we acquired Visage we were thrilled they had the same culture,\" he said.\n\n\"It's the story of software: either you're quick or you are dead, and you don't want to be dead. It's never set and forget.\"\n\nPro Medicus has consistently spent on research and development, even when the business was running at a loss.\n\nThe focus has been building a product that radiologists and other doctors want to use: a quick, all-in-one option, that allows doctors to use the same screen for 2D and 3D images. The speed of the system is linked to using streaming technology to transport files.\n\nNext, the company will explore artificial intelligence applications, such as machines identifying unusual formations in the scans and alerting doctors to them.\n\nMr Hall said the company has watched three technological revolutions in radiology in a very short space of time. The first was the transition from physical photographs to digital; the second was 3D and the latest is artificial intelligence applications.\n\nNow, Pro Medicus' focus is on building its presence in the US market. Apart from attending major trade shows such as RSNA in Chicago, most business comes from incoming calls and word-of-mouth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company has won contracts with prestigious hospital groups including Mayo, Mercy, Yale New Haven and Partners Healthcare, which means doctors graduating from Harvard and Yale will have been trained on Pro Medicus' software.\n\nThe company is optimistic about continuing its growth. At its February result, Pro Medicus said it had received a number of new requests for proposals in the US.\n\nBroker Evans & Partners analysts are forecasting Pro Medicus wins contracts each year totalling $US50 million, spread over seven years. That compares to $US32 million in 2016, but the broker stressed the forecasts should be considered in the context of an addressable market of $US2.2 billion, of which $US1.35 billion is image viewer software and $US0.8 billion is image storage.\n\nIn April the company showed it was on track to achieve that forecast, signing a $14 million, seven-year contract with Duke Health, ranked in the top 20 best hospitals in the US, an announcement that sent its shares rocketing up again.\n\nAnd as for when the founders, who each control just under 30 per cent of the company, will sell?\n\n\"I think a lot of our shareholders are very happy that we have significant skin in the game,\" said Mr Hupert, noting the pair sold down at listing, a little in 2004, and a year ago when they each sold one million shares.\n\n\"We never say never to anything. We did tell the market we may sell up to three million shares each but didn't, it was only one million. At this stage we're pretty happy with the way things are going,\" he said.\n\nThe biggest surprise in building Pro Medicus was how quickly the company cracked the US market, according to Mr Hupert.\n\n\"It's gone very well for us. And as much as you'd like to dream of this a few years ago, often that's not the reality. Thankfully in our case it has been,\" he said.\n\nFind out who are Australia's richest people in the Financial Review Rich List 2019, out on Friday May 31.", "description": "Three eras of radiology technology have passed while Sam Hupert and Anthony Hall built Pro Medicus, now worth over $2.2 billion.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.435%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_364%2C$y_428/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d98c9e3e59dd1c30f7bafa50018eedfb305e97e0", "published_at": "2019-03-28"}
