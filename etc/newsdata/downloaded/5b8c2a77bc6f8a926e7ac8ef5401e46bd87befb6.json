In the book, \"Never Say Never: Adventures in NY Politics,\" he lives up to the description The New York Times bestowed on him two years ago \u2014 the paper called him an \u201cirascible straight shooter,\" a label he's since embraced.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nHe provides an insider's look at some policy debates within the Senate's Republican conference and the intrigue involving the seemingly dry issue of procurement reform. And there's no small amount of score-settling, with several colleagues, and Gov. Andrew Cuomo, coming in for pointed criticism. For example, he recalls being on the receiving end of \"insincere platitudes\" from Cuomo when he lost a vote for Senate majority leader to John Flanagan in 2015.\n\nHe recounts in some detail the drama of that battle with Flanagan, which unfolded in the aftermath of corruption charges being brought against Dean Skelos. Flanagan prevailed, 18-15, in a vote that spoke to upstate-downstate divisions in the GOP conference.\n\nDeFrancisco criticizes some of his fellow conference members for not being forthright about their intentions. \u201cTotaling the votes that Flanagan thought he had and those that I thought I had resulted in a count of 38, when there were only 33 senators!\" he writes.\n\nSome members are singled out by name. Former Sen. Mike Nozzolio, he writes, showed his \u201ctrue character\u201d when he criticized DeFrancisco for not calling him to request his support, despite the fact that Nozzolio had been openly lobbying for Flanagan.\n\n\u201cHe then said I should have also called Kathy [sic] Young, a senator with whom he was very close, to ask for her support \u2026 Kathy Young was not only supporting Flanagan, but also calling other senators for him as well. She was so forceful in these calls that she actually badgered one female senator into tears. Yes, Mike and Kathy are two peas from the same pod. Maybe that\u2019s why they were so close,\" he writes. (Young, whose name is usually spelled Cathy, recently left the Senate, creating a vacancy to be filled later this year.)\n\nAfter the vote, Cuomo called him to offer some sympathetic words. In his telling, DeFrancisco was having none of it.\n\n\u201cI replied by saying that if he thought I would make a great leader why the hell did he make calls on behalf of John Flanagan,\" he writes. \"He forcefully responded that he stayed out of it and made no calls. I told him, \u2018Do you think that I\u2019m a moron,\u2019 and that I knew he had made calls because some of the senators that he called informed me of it. What followed was an embarrassing silence. He then went on to a totally different topic.\u201d\n\nDeFrancisco details the conference\u2019s internal debates on topics such as the 2016 minimum wage hike and his push for procurement reform legislation authored by Comptroller Tom DiNapoli. For a couple of years, that legislation seemingly had the support of a solid majority of legislators, but went nowhere after intense arm-twisting from Cuomo. DeFrancisco, the sponsor of that bill, details what that arm-twisting looked like.\n\nAccording to DeFrancisco, Flanagan agreed in a May 2017 conference to bring the bill to the floor for a vote the following week. DeFrancisco received a call from the governor that weekend.\n\n\u201cI already knew that he definitely did not want it to pass since it would curtail his ever-expanding powers,\u201d he writes. Cuomo then brought up the controversy surrounding Senate stipends that was brewing at the time and demanded that a bill about executive branch contracting be amended to address questions of legislative paychecks.\n\n\u201cHe was obviously trying to pressure me to not pursue the bill because there is no way he could have believed that I would add a totally irrelevant amendment to a piece of legislation that both houses wanted to pass. Cuomo then claimed I was playing politics. Amazing! An accusation that I am playing politics from a man who never took a breath without assessing how his every word and action would affect him politically.\u201d\n\nDeFrancisco says he subsequently received a call from Robert Mujica, Cuomo\u2019s budget director and a former GOP staffer. After criticizing the procurement bill, Mujica segued into talking to DeFrancisco about the senator\u2019s pick to be the State Fair\u2019s director. \u201cIt was obvious to me that Rob was trying to get me to back off the procurement bill in return for the possible naming of Troy Waffner as fair director.\u201d\n\nWhen lawmakers returned to Albany, Flanagan told Republicans that there had never in fact been a promise to vote on the measure.\n\n\u201cI told him he had committed to doing the bill but, almost on cue, two senators stood up and said they recalled no such commitment by the majority leader. Fortunately, the sole [Democrat] in our conference, Simcha Felder, stood up to speak, which was significant since he rarely spoke in conference. Simcha made clear that there was, in fact, such a commitment. Despite this, the bill was not voted on that week.\u201d\n\nThe final pages are mostly about DeFrancisco\u2019s unsuccessful quest for the GOP\u2019s gubernatorial nomination in 2018. For a fleeting time, he seemed like the frontrunner, but his momentum rapidly faded when Marc Molinaro reentered the race.\n\nAs he recounts it, his campaign met its downfall in part thanks to party leaders like Nick Langworthy and Ed Cox (who \u201chad not been a strong chair\u201d) manipulating the rules to smooth the path for Molinaro.\n\n\u201cIt almost sounded to me like the GOP was trying to lose this race. You have a gubernatorial candidate whose highest level of education was a community college degree, and who had no work experience other than in elective office.\u201d\n\nDeFrancisco floats a theory he heard from longtime radio host Fred Dicker that, in his view, might explain why Republicans backed the wrong horse in 2018.\n\n\u201c[Dicker] felt that this whole group behind Molinaro was tied to Al D\u2019Amato \u2026 Al D\u2019Amato had already endorsed Andrew Cuomo for re-election. It was no surprise to me that he would do so, in light of the fact that his lobbying firm, Mercury Enterprises, was one of New York\u2019s top-grossing lobbying firms. Maybe Dicker had been right. Who knows?\u201d\n\nFor DeFrancsico, that 2018 contest was the end of an era both personally \u2014 it was the last election he\u2019d ever run, after going 17-0 earlier in his career \u2014 and politically. He has little faith that the GOP will recover the losses it incurred that year, writing that \u201cit is likely that the senate will turn 2 to 1 democrat as the assembly has been for many years.\u201d\n\nThe memoir in some ways offers a rebuttal to the way that era will likely be defined in history books. In the waning years of the GOP\u2019s control of the Senate, the common narrative often involved constant gridlock and corruption, with legislators\u2019 perp walks often becoming weekly occurrences. DeFrancisco uses the book to collect many of his well-honed rebuttals of the prescriptions that have been offered by reformers and editorial boards.\n\n\u201cMy law practice gave me total independence on how I voted on various issues,\u201d he writes of the still ongoing debate over legislators' outside jobs. \u201cMy livelihood did not depend on whether or not I won an election.\u201d\n\nHe discloses that he spent years suffering from \u201cmini-strokes\u201d and made an emergency trip to the hospital in 2014 where he was diagnosed with a \u201crapid irregular heartbeat that \u2026 can result in sudden death.\u201d That\u2019s when he decided to put in paperwork to start collecting a pension, making him the latest in a long line of legislators lambasted for \u201cdouble-dipping\u201d by collecting two paychecks at once.\n\nBut, he writes, the critics often don\u2019t take into account that people like his wife would not have been eligible to collect the full pensions had their legislative spouses died before filling out the paperwork. \u201cI would bet that just about anyone who was facing the situation that I was would have done the same thing,\u201d he writes.\n\nDeFrancisco doesn\u2019t dispute that there have been many corrupt legislators in recent years. But he does argue that several of them, such as former Senate Republican Leader Joe Bruno, have been tried in the press by \u201cprosecutors that are more concerned about convictions than justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a basic tenet in the law, namely, that one is presumed innocent until proven guilty, but this was not so for legislators at this time in history,\u201d he writes.", "description": "There's no small amount of score-settling, with several colleagues coming in for pointed criticism.", "authors": ["Bill Mahoney"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/fb/e0/f1b9b697440e894c34c57e73e3a3/johndefrancisco.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
