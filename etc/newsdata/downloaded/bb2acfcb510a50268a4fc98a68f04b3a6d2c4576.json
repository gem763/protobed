(Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post)\n\nMore than 300,000 students in suburban Maryland headed back to school Tuesday, with enrollment projected to set a record for the state\u2019s largest system, in Montgomery County, and with efforts underway to expand early learning and foster literacy.\n\nIt was also another first day of classes that fell in September, after Labor Day, in keeping with an executive order by Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) in 2016 that schools not open before the public holiday.\n\nIn Montgomery, early estimates pegged enrollment at more than 164,000 students, reflecting an increase of 1,000 to 1,500 students and extending a surge spanning more than a decade.\n\nMontgomery County Public Schools Superintendent Jack Smith started the day before dawn at Quince Orchard High School in Gaithersburg, greeting students, parents and staff. By midmorning, he was at Brown Station Elementary, which has a two-way immersion program in English and Spanish. He noted that second-graders involved since kindergarten were at ease.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just amazing to see them operating in another language in the academic setting so comfortably,\u201d Smith said in an interview. \u201cBecoming fully fluent and literate in English and in another language . . . is something I think we need to expand.\u201d\n\nPrince George\u2019s County opened with Monica Goldson presiding as chief executive, following a year as interim leader of the state\u2019s second-largest system. In June, she was named to the permanent post.\n\nGoldson pointed out it was her \u201c28th first day of school\u201d as an educator \u2014 and still a thrill. \u201cWhen you walk into the buildings and see kids, it changes everything,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just excited to have them back.\u201d\n\n[Schools chief who led Md. system after predecessor left amid scandals gets permanent post]\n\nOpening day in the two Maryland school systems and others in nearby counties came as the city of Alexandria and Arlington County in Virginia also marked the start of classes. Last week, the District and Virginia\u2019s Fairfax and Prince William counties opened schools, and before them, Loudoun County.\n\nIn Prince George\u2019s, Goldson welcomed students and staff during visits at schools in Suitland and Riverdale and was joined by Maryland Superintendent of Schools Karen Salmon as she made stops at schools in Laurel and Largo.\n\nEnrollment in Prince George\u2019s was projected to dip slightly, to 134,265, with about 200 fewer students than last year.\n\nGoldson pointed to $53 million in state funds that she said will help the school system expand prekindergarten and work toward improvements in literacy, special education, teacher compensation and support for schools with high-needs students.\n\nOn Tuesday, she visited Montpelier Elementary School in Laurel, where she recalled that a teacher read to 4-year-olds in full-day prekindergarten as the children identified objects and numbers in the book.\n\nIn a surprise, she and Salmon handed out lunches to teachers at Largo High School and at the International High School at Largo.\n\n\u201cIt was good to have an opportunity to serve the teachers who serve our students,\u201d she said.\n\nNearly 1,200 new teachers are working in Prince George\u2019s classrooms, and Goldson challenged principals to teach at least one class this fall to reconnect with classroom experiences.\n\nOf challenges ahead, she said the school system is focused on transportation and ensuring buses get students to school on time. The county has more than 1,000 routes and is short a couple of dozen bus drivers, she said.\n\n[School board majority in Maryland favors renewal of superintendent contract]\n\nIn neighboring Montgomery, the county started the year with a new school, its 207th: Snowden Farm Elementary, in the growing community of Clarksburg, a suburb in the northern part of the county.\n\nBuilding additions were open at Ashburton Elementary in Bethesda and S. Christa McAuliffe Elementary in Germantown. Since 2008, Montgomery\u2019s enrollment has climbed by more than 23,000 students.\n\nLooking ahead to the year, Smith underlined rising enrollment, prekindergarten programs and a new curriculum in math and English language arts for elementary and middle schools.\n\nMore than 1,000 new teachers were hired in Montgomery \u2014 nearly 30 percent of whom attended county high schools.\n\nNew initiatives include a program to bring bilingual volunteers into elementary schools to help teach world language lessons.\n\nSmith said the school system faces challenges in renovating outdated facilities and in integrating a focus on student well-being into academic programs. He noted that labor contracts for its three employee unions come up in the months ahead.\n\n\u201cWe have to make sure that in our contract negotiations, we remain highly competitive to attract and retain the very best employees,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more:\n\nLast year: School opens with another year of record enrollment projected in Maryland\n\nHonors classes for all leave some parents asking: Is it really honors?\n\nCan you skip 47 days of English class and still graduate from high school?\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "As classes resume, Prince George\u2019s expects a slight dip in student numbers.", "authors": ["Donna St. George", "Reporter Covering Education", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/1u4fl44SZkv6lR-zIUA5-nNadSA=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ENHJTZRZBUI6TMIL6BNCFZ2YMU.jpg"}
