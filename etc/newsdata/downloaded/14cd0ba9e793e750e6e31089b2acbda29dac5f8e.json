But eventually, it always does.\"\n\nNicholas Hyett at Hargreaves Lansdown said that Spotify, \"in the grand scheme of things, is expensive share for a company that doesn't make a huge amount of profit and in fact probably won't make a profit overall this year\".\n\nHowever, he said Spotify showed it was adding premium users - its highest-margin segment - and has showed some evidence of shifting to semi-own label music, reducing the cost of royalties to record companies.\n\nThe company also said chief financial officer Barry McCarthy would be stepping down from his post at the start of next year.\n\nHe played a key role in taking Spotify public in April 2018 in an unusual \"direct listing\" under which it sold no new shares.\n\nMr McCarthy will be replaced in January by Paul Vogel, its vice-president of financial planning and analysis, but will retain a seat on the board if shareholders give their approval.\n\nMr Vogel said he planned to \"just to keep things going as they are\".\n\nSpotify has managed to continue adding users even as Apple and Amazon ramped up their own music streaming services. Both have tied music products to their hardware devices, such as offering services through their smart speakers and phones, and Apple Music has overtaken the Swedish company as the US market leader.\n\nHowever, Spotify brushed off the threat posed by the pair, with boss Daniel Ek saying it was Spotify's \"game to lose\", adding: \"There's a game still to be played, but at the moment we're the largest.\"\n\nStory continues", "description": "Spotify added five million subscribers in the most recent quarter to bring\u00a0the total to 113m, sending shares sharply higher.", "authors": ["Hannah Boland"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cdhSS7UBYETkLkVgD5eMxA--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/7808d135d75fb2a1d89e299fa607e881", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
