He recounted serving in Afghanistan in the military while he was still closeted and realizing he might die without being able to know what it was like to fall in love and marry.\n\nOn the subject of public health rules that bar gay men from giving blood dating from the HIV epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s, Buttigieg's personal experience colored his answer.\n\n\"My blood is not welcome in this country and it's not based on science,\" Buttigieg said. \"It's based on prejudice.\"\n\nAs president, he said, he would move to change the policy.\n\n\n\n\n\nCRITICISM OF TRUMP RECORD\n\nU.S. Senator Cory Booker opened the forum, stressing inclusion and acceptance.\n\n\"You can\u2019t lead the people if you can\u2019t love the people \u2013 all the people,\" he said.\n\nU.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, a top Democratic contender, missed the event while he recovers from a heart attack.\n\nGay rights advocates have expressed dismay at the Trump administration's record on LGBTQ issues, including a ban on transgender individuals serving in the U.S. military.\n\nLawyers for the Department of Justice argued at the U.S. Supreme Court this week that federal civil rights law does not prohibit employers from firing workers based on their transgender identity or sexual orientation.\n\nAhead of the forum, Buttigieg and U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris released plans to secure equality for LGBTQ people.\n\nAll three support the Equality Act, like most other Democrats, which would explicitly add LGBTQ protections to federal anti-discrimination law.\n\nThey also vowed to make pre-exposure prophylaxis, a drug that helps lower the risk of contracting the human immunodeficiency virus, accessible and affordable to all who want it.\n\nButtigieg said he would eliminate the HIV/AIDS epidemic by 2030, in part by restoring the White House Office of National AIDS Policy that has gone dormant under Trump.\n\nAll three candidates promised to elevate LGBTQ concerns as president. Warren said she would appoint a special envoy at the State Department, while Harris said she would create a White House position, chief advocate for LGBTQ+ Affairs, to coordinate efforts across the entire federal government.\n\n(Reporting by Joseph Ax; Additional reporting by Sharon Bernstein in Sacramento, California; Editing by Paul Tait and Peter Cooney)", "description": "Joe Biden said on Thursday he would withhold foreign aid from countries that persecute lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, as he joined eight other Democratic presidential candidates at a televised forum on LGBTQ issues.
