Only 2 of the 14 Democratic state senators and about 15 of 233 Democratic state representatives have backed a candidate among the 20 running.\n\n\u201cFour years ago, we were laughing at the Republicans\u201d over the size of the GOP field, said Raymond Buckley, chairman of the state Democratic Party.\n\nAt a recent dinner party at the home of Rep. Annie Kuster, eight friends sat around a table to talk about the primary. The guests broke down the pros and cons of their favorite candidates but realized there was a stalemate, with each liking a different candidate\u2026\n\nAnecdotally, some New Hampshire pols have said candidates have showered less attention on them and the state than they\u2019re accustomed to.
