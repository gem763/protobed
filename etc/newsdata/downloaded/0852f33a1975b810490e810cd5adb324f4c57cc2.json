The recipients came from 89 local and network radio, television and digital news organizations.\n\n\u201cWinning an RTDNA National Edward R. Murrow Award means that a news organization has provided exemplary public service to its viewers, listeners and readers. These honorees truly represent the very best in broadcast and digital journalism around the world,\u201d said Dan Shelley, RTDNA Executive Director.\n\n\u201cEvery person who worked on this project was committed to chronicling this horrible epidemic in a meaningful way, and it\u2019s truly amazing to see their hard work recognized with a National Murrow Award,\u201d said Peter Bhatia, who was editor of The Enquirer when the project was done and is now the editor of the Detroit Free Press. \u201cReceiving this honor recognizes the excellence in video at The Enquirer and an extraordinary staff of visual journalists who are making a difference in their work every day.\u201d\n\nSeven Days in Heroin was also recognized nationally earlier this year as a Pulitzer Prize winner for local reporting.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2KbhKEn", "description": "Cincinnati Enquirer named a winner of the 2018 National Edward R.
