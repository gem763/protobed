(\u201cRDT\u201d or the \u201cCorporation\u201d) (CSE: DOSE) is pleased to announce that today it has completed the first closing of a private placement of common shares in the capital of the Corporation (\u201cCommon Shares\u201d) at a price of $0.70 per Common Share for gross proceeds of $756,076 (the \u201cPrivate Placement\u201d). A total of 1,080,108 Common Shares were issued to investors, including a director and senior officer of RDT, in connection with the first closing of the Private Placement.\n\n\n\nDue to further investor interest, additional closings of the Private Placement may be held until October 25th.\n\nCertain of the Common Shares issued under the Private Placement will be subject to a four-month hold period. The proceeds received from the Private Placement will be used by the Corporation to strengthen its working capital position and for general corporate purposes.\n\nIn connection with this initial closing, $35,369 in cash fees and 17,684 warrants will be paid to Profinnotiv AG. Each warrant will entitle the holder to purchase one Common Share at an exercise price of $1.00 per Common Share for a period of two years.\n\nGiven that a director and senior officer of the Corporation participated in the Private Placement, that portion of the Private Placement constituted a \"related party transaction\" within the meaning of Multilateral Instrument 61-101 \u2013 Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (\u201cMI 61-101\u201d). In its consideration and approval of the Private Placement, the board of directors of the Corporation determined that the Private Placement was exempt from the formal valuation and minority approval requirements of MI 61-101 on the basis that the fair market value of the Common Shares issued to related parties did not exceed 25% of the market capitalization of the Corporation, in accordance with Sections 5.5 and 5.7 of MI 61-101. The Corporation did not file a material change report at least 21 days prior to the anticipated date of completion of the Private Placement due to the Corporation\u2019s determination that it was in the best interests of the Corporation to avail itself of the proceeds and complete the Private Placement in an expeditious manner.\n\nThis news release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any Common Shares nor shall there be any sales of the Common Shares in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. The Common Shares have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cU.S. Securities Act\u201d), or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold within the United States unless registered under the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state securities laws or an exemption from such registration is available.\n\nAbout the Corporation\n\nRapid Dose Therapeutics Corp. is a publicly-traded Canadian life sciences company that provides innovative, proprietary drug delivery technologies designed to improve outcomes and quality of lives.
