USA TODAY\n\nThe three Korean automotive brands are producing the highest-quality vehicles in the U.S., according to an influential annual survey by J.D. Power.\n\nGenesis, Kia and Hyundai \u2013 all part of the same Korean manufacturing group \u2013 took the first, second and third slots, respectively, for the second straight year in the J.D. Power Initial Quality Study (IQS). Their electronics performance was especially strong.\n\nBut if you want the highest-quality vehicle on the market, you'll have to save up for the Porsche 911, a luxury sport coupe that ranked No. 1 among all models. (Scroll down or click through the gallery above to see the full list of the 22 vehicles to win their categories.)\n\nThe 2019 J.D. Power IQS survey gauges how new vehicles are faring in their first 90 days. The study plays an influential role in shaping public perceptions of automotive brands and vehicles, as automakers typically tout their performance to customers.\n\nIt doesn't gauge long-term reliability, value or popularity. Instead, it tracks defects and shortcomings, such as poorly performing infotainment and problems with advanced safety systems.\n\nThese cars really can fly: Startups aim to begin test flights as early as next year\n\nIs cash on borrowed time? What's the future for cold, hard money?\n\nLand Rover and Jaguar, luxury British brands owned by India-based Tata Motors, placed second to last and last, respectively. (See the full list of brands below.)\n\nOverall, vehicle quality stayed flat for the 2019 model year, marking the first time it hasn't improved in five years, J.D. Power said.\n\n2018 J.D. Power IQS results: Genesis, Kia, Hyundai come out on top\n\n\u201cAutomakers continue to make progress in areas like infotainment that attract a lot of consumer attention,\u201d Dave Sargent, vice president of global automotive at J.D. Power, said in a statement. \u201cHowever, some traditional problems crept up this year including paint imperfections, brake and suspension noises, engines not starting and the \u2018check engine\u2019 light coming on early in the ownership experience.\"\n\nHe also said more people are having issues with their advanced driver assistance systems, which are critical for building consumer trust in future automated vehicles.\n\nThe 2019 Hyundai Santa Fe.

Therefore we only have responses from states which comprise about 30% of Tesla\u2019s sales volume, and our current rules preclude us from reporting publicly on what may be an unrepresentative sample of customers.\"\n\nWinners in each major vehicle category:\n\nTop overall model: Porsche 911\n\nSmall car: Kia Rio (runners up: Hyundai Accent, Nissan Versa)\n\nSmall premium car: BMW 2 Series\n\nCompact car: Kia Forte (runners up: Hyundai Elantra, Toyota Corolla)\n\nCompact sporty car: MINI Cooper (runner up: Hyundai Veloster)\n\nCompact premium car: Genesis G70 (runners up: BMW 4 Series, Kia Stinger)\n\nMidsize car: Chevrolet Malibu and Ford Fusion (runners up: Hyundai Sonata, Kia Optima)\n\nMidsize sporty car: Dodge Challenger\n\nMidsize premium car: Mercedes-Benz CLS (runners up: Genesis G80, Audi A7)\n\nLarge car: Nissan Maxima (runners up: Toyota Avalon Chrysler 300)\n\nSmall SUV: Kia Sportage (runners up: Hyundai Tuscon, Hyundai Kona)\n\nCompact SUV: Chevrolet Equinox (runners up: Ford Escape, Honda CR-V, Nissan Rogue)\n\nCompact premium SUV: BMW X4 (runners up: Lincoln MKC, Mercedes-Benz GLC)\n\nMidsize pickup: Ford Ranger (runners up: Nissan Frontier, Toyota Tacoma)\n\nMidsize SUV: Hyundai Santa Fe (runners up: Ford Flex, Jeep Grand Cherokee, Kia Sorento, Nissan Murano)\n\nMidsize premium SUV: Lexus RX (runners up: Mercedes-Benz GLE)\n\nMinivan: Kia Sedona (runners up: Dodge Grand Caravan, Toyota Sienna)\n\nLarge SUV: Chevrolet Tahoe (runners up: Toyota Sequoia, Ford Expedition)\n\nLarge premium SUV: Cadillac Escalade (runner up: Lincoln Navigator)\n\nLarge light-duty pickup: Nissan Titan (runner up: Ford F-150, Toyota Tundra)\n\nLarge heavy-duty pickup: Chevrolet Silverado HD (runner up: Ford Super Duty)\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2019/06/19/2019-jd-power-iqs-initial-quality-study/1480119001/", "description": "The three Korean automotive brands are producing the highest quality vehicles in the U.S., according to an influential annual survey by J.D.
