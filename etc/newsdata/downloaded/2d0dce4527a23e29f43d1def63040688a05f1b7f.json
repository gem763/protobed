Now they\u2019re getting new homes.", "language": "en", "text": "By the time photos made the rounds among neighbors on community website Nextdoor, the van parked outside a San Diego-area Circle K convenience store was home to hundreds of rats \u2014 and a woman who didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\n\u201cIt was devastating,\u201d said Kimberly Jackson, a local animal shelter volunteer who saw the pictures and set out to find the van owner earlier this month. \u201cShe thought I was there to ridicule her like everybody else was. And I just asked, \u2018How can I help you? This is not good.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHelp came, for both the rats and their human. Last week, staff from the San Diego Humane Society showed up with crates to carry off about 320 critters, scrambling to get the job done before the vehicle was towed. A GoFundMe page launched by another concerned resident has raised over $5,000 for the van\u2019s owner, identified online only as \u201cCarla.\u201d\n\nWith the rats gone, Carla is able to stay with family now, the fundraiser announced this week. And she has a new car \u2014 a well-traveled but functional SUV \u2014 donated by another local.\n\nThe outpouring of support has left Carla overwhelmed and sometimes tearful, her helpers say.\n\n\u201cShe said she had no idea so many people cared about her,\u201d the GoFundMe page says.\n\nAD\n\nA few weeks ago, Carla\u2019s world was much more bleak. The rat situation was alarming local businesses \u2014 including Carla\u2019s employer, Circle K, the online fundraiser says. The woman feared losing her job as rats swarmed around the Del Mar shopping center, near what the San Diego Union-Tribune called one of the area\u2019s \u201ctoniest communities.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe van was \u201ca health hazard,\u201d the GoFundMe said. With average litters in the double digits and gestation times of about a month, the rats were set to keep multiplying.\n\nA man who answered the phone at Circle K told The Washington Post the convenience store did not wish to comment.\n\nHumane Society officers who arrived Oct. 8 found a car that no longer started and would have to be dismantled to flush out all the animals, said Danee Cook, a captain with the Humane Society\u2019s law enforcement department. With the owner\u2019s help, Cook said, staff removed dozens of rats that first day.\n\nAD\n\nThen came what Cook called \u201cthe big removal.\u201d Hearing that Carla was under pressure from her employer to move the van quickly, staff rushed back to pull out seats and tear up upholstery as they tried to round up the rest of the rats, many of whom were skittish or pregnant.\n\nAD\n\nSome animals burrowed too deep to reach, Cook said. She\u2019s not sure how many animals were still snuggled inside the car when it was finally towed.\n\nThe car smelled so bad that the first towing company turned down the job, according to Jackson. The tow truck driver didn\u2019t even want to open the door.\n\nThe influx of rats has strained the resources of a shelter network that typically keeps just a handful of the animals at each of its locations: \u201cUnless its an animal cruelty case, we\u2019ve just never had an impound of this magnitude,\u201d Cook said.\n\nAD\n\nBut this was not a case of animal abuse, she said. The owner gave her rats ample food and water \u2014 and surrendered them readily when Humane Society officers showed up.\n\n\u201cThey were not being handled regularly and socialized, but she was doing the best she could,\u201d Cook said.\n\nAD\n\nMore than 100 of the rats are now ready for adoption at $5 for a same-gender pair, she said, while about 10 have found new owners already. The rest of the critters are in foster care until they give birth.\n\nAs the rats await adoption, others are still working to help the animals\u2019 owner \u2014 \u201ca sweet soul and a smart woman who fell on very hard times,\u201d Jackson said. The GoFundMe money will pay off some but not all of Carla\u2019s more than $7,000 in credit card debt. And on Friday, Jackson said, Carla agreed to meet the GoFundMe creators\u2019 one condition for giving her money: getting counseling. She plans to join a six-month program for people who struggle with animal hoarding.\n\nBut Jackson said Carla still lacks what her rats are now headed for: a permanent home.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The woman had two animals named Jacob and Rachael.
