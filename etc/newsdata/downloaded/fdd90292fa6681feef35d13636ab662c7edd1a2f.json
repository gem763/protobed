Silva replied. 'The pressure is here. I am never scared about the pressure. Never, never, never.\n\n'It's the way I work. I don't have problems with the pressure. When I say to you it's a must-win game, it's a must-win game.'\n\nUnder-fire Everton manager Marco Silva admits he is not frightened of pressure\n\nThe international break can be a precarious time for struggling managers and Silva is banking on the continued support of the club's majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri.\n\nEverton's descent towards the relegation places continued with a fourth Premier League defeat in a row at the hands of Burnley, after Jeff Hendrick volleyed home a deserved winner midway through the second half.\n\nAt the end, Silva went to applaud the Everton fans in the away end and was met with a torrent of abuse. 'I face up to things, more in these periods than the others,' he said.\n\nSilva went to applaud Everton fans and was met with a torrent of abuse after Burnley loss\n\nSeason at a glance Live tables\n\nFixtures\n\nScores Premier League\n\nPremier League\n\nChampionship\n\nLeague One\n\nLeague Two\n\nScottish Premiership\n\nScottish Div 1\n\nScottish Div 2\n\nScottish Div 3\n\nLigue 1\n\nSerie A\n\nLa Liga\n\nBundesliga\n\n\n\n\n\n'I went there to the fans because it's what we must do.

We had a worse period last season, longer than this one, and they reacted well.\n\n'In this way the things will change for us, but the belief is the same, no doubt.'\n\nEverton were not helped by the sending-off of captain Seamus Coleman, who received a second yellow card 11 minutes after half-time for fouling Dwight McNeil, having been fortunate to escape a straight red for an awful late tackle on Erik Pieters in the first half.\n\nPieters played on but eventually succumbed to the leg injury and left Turf Moor wearing a protective boot.\n\n'It felt bad,' said the Dutchman. 'It's lucky I didn't break it.\n\n'I know he (Coleman) didn't mean it. Straightaway, he stayed with me and apologised like 10 times.
