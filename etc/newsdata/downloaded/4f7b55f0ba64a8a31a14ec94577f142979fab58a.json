When I offer him headphones, he declines, saying, \u201cI hear my voice plenty.\u201d\n\nThe 41-year-old comedian\u2019s low-level anxiety seems to be in part due to the fact that season three of his beloved animated show Big Mouth has just dropped on Netflix three days earlier and the reactions from fans are starting to flood in.\n\n\u201cIf someone had said five years ago, that I would work on a show for over a year, the entire show would come out over a weekend, and then anyone who wanted to be in touch with you about the show, positively and negatively, could contact you in any number of platforms, it\u2019s a pretty surreal thing,\u201d Kroll tells me as we settle in for this week\u2019s episode of The Last Laugh podcast. \u201cSo I both engage and try to keep some distance from it. Because no matter how positively everything comes in, it\u2019s hard for the brain to absorb.\u201d\n\nKroll is back in Los Angeles on a brief break from his national \u201cMiddle-Aged Boy Tour,\u201d his biggest stand-up tour ever, which will bring him to the Brooklyn Academy of Music as part of the New York Comedy Festival next month. It\u2019s the first time Kroll, who has spent his career embodying outlandish characters, is truly being himself on stage.\n\nThe same day the new batch of Big Mouth episodes premiered, Joker arrived in theaters to the best October box office opening in history and an outsized level of controversy for what is still essentially a comic book movie. I wanted to know what Kroll thought of that film\u2019s director Todd Phillips suggesting that he stopped making comedies because it\u2019s too hard to be \u201cfunny nowadays with this woke culture.\u201d\n\nBig Mouth, which in this season alone mines laughs from masturbation, the #MeToo movement and pansexuality among other potentially fraught topics, seems like the perfect counter-example to Phillips\u2019 claims. As the critic Emma Specter put it in her Vogue review, \u201cIt\u2019s refreshing to see a show made by adults tackle the complex question of sexual fluidity with humor that isn\u2019t derived from a hacky, cynical angle of \u2018Aren\u2019t these kids crazy, with their nonbinary pronouns?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cPart of me is like, I don\u2019t know about weighing in on any of this,\u201d Kroll says as a preface before offering up a thoughtful, cogent answer that both references incestuous dick pics and a recent trip to the Galapagos Islands to explain his willingness to evolve as a comedian.\n\nMeanwhile, Big Mouth is in no danger of being \u201ccanceled,\u201d either literally or in the metaphorical sense. Not only did Netflix recently announce that it was picking up the show for an additional three seasons but they also gave the green light to a separate spinoff series called Human Resources about the world of the Hormone Monsters, Shame Wizards and other fantastical creatures that populate the show\u2019s adolescent minds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a workplace comedy set in the world of the monsters,\u201d Kroll says, comparing it to shows like The Office. \u201cI\u2019m really excited about it.\u201d\n\nHighlights from our conversation are below and you can listen to the whole thing right now by subscribing to The Last Laugh on Apple Podcasts, the Himalaya app or wherever you listen to podcasts.\n\nOn kids watching \u2018Big Mouth\u2019 despite its dirty content\n\n\u201cWe have been more than pleasantly surprised about how many kids have watched it and, even more so, that parents are OK with it. Obviously the show is very dirty, but I think more and more people are realizing that the messaging of what we\u2019re saying is trying to be pretty responsible. My nieces and nephews are texting and DM\u2019ing me being like, \u2018My friends all watch the show, everyone loves it,\u2019 and that\u2019s awesome. Because, look, it\u2019s a show that we made as adults, but we made it about this very tricky, lonely time in life, so the idea that kids would watch it and hopefully feel a little less alone and learn a thing or two and have a laugh at it, is very gratifying.\u201d\n\nHow they decided to tackle #MeToo through \u2018Disclosure\u2019 the Musical\n\n\u201cThis season was the first season that we wrote after #MeToo had really taken hold and built momentum. We wanted to talk about sexual harassment, so I sort of said off-handedly, \u2018The bad example would be they do a musical of the movie Disclosure.\u2019 Everyone laughed and then were like, well let\u2019s try to figure out what the actual movie is. We went back to look at other movies that are now \u2018problematic,\u2019 like Revenge of the Nerds or Sixteen Candles\u2014movies that we all loved growing up but then you go back and watch and go, these are tricky. But they weren\u2019t quite as funny or didn\u2019t make as much sense. And Disclosure really speaks to 25 years later, there is a lot of talk of the paranoia of women weaponizing sexual harassment.\u201d\n\nOn making comedy despite \u2018woke culture\u2019\n\n\u201cI think that you can still talk about anything and be crazy and not feel too censored. It\u2019s a trickier time, but also we have a show where a boy sends a dick pic to his cousin that he made out with. You can still do and say some pretty crazy, wild shit. But everybody approaches comedy differently and has different objectives and opinions inside of it. And we don\u2019t always get it exactly right and there are people who are not always thrilled about how we are speaking about an issue. I\u2019m of the opinion, personally, we have this ability to listen and communicate with the audience and hear what they have to say. And sometimes, I\u2019m like, I don\u2019t agree with you. And other times I\u2019m like yeah, I hear you, we didn\u2019t get that exactly right. We\u2019ll do better. I\u2019m here to evolve and adapt. And everybody goes and makes their own art and however they want to do it, god bless \u2018em. And if they stop making it because it\u2019s not the way they want to do it anymore, go ahead.\u201d\n\nOn getting rejected by \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019\n\n\u201cGrowing up, SNL was so important to me. It still holds this weird power over all of us. Whether you watch the show or not, it does loom very large. I knew if I didn\u2019t get SNL that things were going to be OK, that I was going to work, but more than anything ever in my life I wanted to be on Saturday Night Live. [John Mulaney] and I worked on our auditions together and he got cast as a writer on the show. Jordan [Peele] was in that audition, Ellie Kemper was in that audition. There were a bunch of people in that audition who have gone on to have very good careers. There\u2019s something about SNL that I\u2019ll always wish I got on that show. Even when I then got to go make my own sketch show, on my terms, doing characters I wanted to do without anyone else telling me what I could or couldn\u2019t do in an environment that was entirely in my control, there was still that thing of being like, \u2018Oh, but Saturday Night Live\u2026\u2019 But it\u2019s all worked out just fine.\u201d\n\nNext week on The Last Laugh podcast: Stand-up comedian, actress and author of the new book, Small Doses: Potent Truths for Everyday Use, Amanda Seales.", "description": "On this week\u2019s episode of \u201cThe Last Laugh\u201d podcast, \u201cBig Mouth\u201d creator Nick Kroll pushes back on the idea that \u201cwoke culture\u201d has made it harder to be funny.", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_675,w_1200,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571714582/191021-Wilstein-last-laugh-Nick-Kroll-tease_vd36rj", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
