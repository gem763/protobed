Then came Uber, followed by Grab and Gojek, Southeast Asia\u2019s answer to the revolutionary ride-hailing app.\n\nCompetition from the technology titans wiped out $1.7 billion, or almost 80%, of PT Blue Bird\u2019s market value from a peak. Revenue plunged 23% in three years and the latest quarterly earnings fell to a record low. But rather than give up, the 54-year-old cab operator is now seeking to turn the tide. Leading the effort is Noni Purnomo, who succeeded her father in May as president.\n\nFour months into her new job at the Jakarta-based company, Purnomo is banking on technology to transform the flagging business her late grandmother started in 1965. Her plans include focusing on electric vehicles made by Tesla Inc. and BYD Co. to cut fleet ownership costs and improve efficiency using data.\n\n\u201cWe decided to take a huge leap,\u201d Purnomo, 47, said at her office in Jakarta last week. \u201cWith this leap, we hope we can address our shortcomings\u201d and catch up with rivals.\n\nWhile sustainability is her immediate priority, Purnomo\u2019s goal eventually is to beat the ride-hailing giants that have upended what was once an industry renowned for its steady revenue and dominated by small owners and families like Purnomo\u2019s. She\u2019s up against Singapore-based Grab, the regional giant that bought Uber Technologies Inc.\u2019s Southeast Asian operations last year.\n\nPurnomo\u2019s toughest challenge yet may be convincing investors that her company is here to stay and thrive. Blue Bird\u2019s shares traded at 2,580 rupiah (18 cents) in Jakarta on Monday. They reached an all-time high of 12,500 rupiah in January 2015, months after Blue Bird raised a modest $200 million from an initial public offering.\n\nPurnomo has already added about two dozen EVs to Blue Bird\u2019s almost 30,000-strong fleet of cabs that operate in the cities of Java, Sumatra, Bali, Lombok and Batam. Eventually, the plan is to have 2,000 of the zero-emission taxis from Tesla and Chinese maker BYD, she said.\n\nEVs may give her company an edge as initial data have shown encouraging signs, she said. The vehicles cost 40% less to operate than fossil fuel-powered cars, and generate 30% more revenue, according to her.\n\nBesides, her rivals can\u2019t replicate this model easily, Purnomo said. Their asset-light model would require drivers to bear the financing costs of an expensive EV, a risky proposition for most individuals, she said. A representative for Grab didn\u2019t respond to request for comments.\n\n\u201cWe have a different business model and the company can take the risk instead of the individual,\u201d she said.\n\nCharging Stations\n\nThe lack of charging infrastructure in the Southeast Asian country could pose a hurdle. Right now, Blue Bird has facilities at its main office in Jakarta, while there\u2019s one available at the city\u2019s airport. President Joko Widodo\u2018s government is trying to ramp up charging stations in malls and other public places to help boost sales of EVs.\n\nRead about Indonesia\u2019s plan to form electric-car hub\n\nBlue Bird will also invest in the internet of things -- an emerging technology that links machines and gadgets and likely to get a boost with the roll out of 5G wireless networks. IoT will help Blue Bird collect data and improve operational efficiency and help implement dynamic pricing, a variable fare model popular with the likes of Uber, Lyft Inc. and Grab.\n\nPurnomo said the company now has the technical capability to fight back and the financial resources to challenge them, without elaborating on how she plans to raise capital. On the other hand, Grab has money to burn. Valued at $14 billion, it is planning to raise more than $4.5 billion in its latest funding round.\n\n\u201cGojek and Grab\u2019s low fares have caused a major churn for these taxi companies,\u201d said Kenny Liew, an analyst at Fitch Solutions. \u201cThe taxi companies need to look at new business models, even partnerships with ride-hailing players, to stay relevant.\u201d\n\nRival Ties\n\nBlue Bird already has an alliance with Gojek, operated by PT Aplikasi Karya Anak Bangsa, that allows its fleet to be available on the Gojek app. While it opens up the customer base, it also has the disadvantage of lower margins, Liew said. Gojek offers both motorcycle and cab rides.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Follow Bloomberg on LINE messenger for all the business news and analysis you need.In 2015, the shares of Indonesia\u2019s largest cab company were soaring, while its revenue reached a record high.
