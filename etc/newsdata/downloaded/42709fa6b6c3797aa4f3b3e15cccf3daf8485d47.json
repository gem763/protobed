Without having an obsession, they happen naturally.\"", "description": "The Portuguese icon found the net in the 2-1 defeat to Ukraine on Monday night", "authors": ["Mark Jones", "Image", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Paulo Novais Epa-Efe Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20583123.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Ukraine-vs-Portugal-Kiev-13-Oct-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
