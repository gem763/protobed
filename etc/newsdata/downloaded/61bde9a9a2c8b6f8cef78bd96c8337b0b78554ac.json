Boko Haram, an Islamic State affiliate, popularized the use of child suicide bombers and child jihadis, indoctrinating abducted children and children conceived from the rape of abducted young women.\n\nThe children freed from military custody were immediately transported to a Borno government and United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF) rehabilitation center for recovery.\n\n\u201cOperation Lafiya Dole\u201d Theatre Commander Olusegun Adeniyi confirmed that the children have been \u201cabsolved\u201d of any hostile involvement in acts of terror despite being arrested, in some cases, alongside their parents during the raids. \u201c[They] are mostly victims, rather than perpetrators,\u201d he said, continuing:\n\nThe children are commonly subjected to abuse, and most of them witness killing and sexual violence. Regardless of how they are recruited and the roles they play, their participation bears serious implication on their physical and emotional well-being. Therefore, their rehabilitation and reintegration into civil life is an essential part of our programme.\n\nUNICEF acting Chief of Maiduguri Field Office Gillian Walker said, \u201cchildren taken away from their families and communities, deprived of their childhood, education, healthcare, and of the chance to grow up in a safe and enabling environment.\u201d\n\nWalker said UNICEF is working with the goal of reuniting \u201call conflict-affected children\u2026 with their families,\u201d so they can \u201chave hope of fulfilling their dreams and their human rights.\u201d But the work is far from over, Walker said, and she believes they can do better:\n\nWe have made progress, but we would like to see all children suspected of involvement with armed groups, transferred out of military custody to the care of the relevant local authorities as quickly as possible to facilitate their return to their families and communities, spending minimal, if any, time in detention.\n\nWhile these children are finally safe, many others remain prisoners to the terrorists of Boko Haram \u2013 also known as the Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP) \u2013 and victims of tens of millions of Nigerian child marriages. The influence of the Nigerian Islamic State has also emboldened would-be abductors as far as Borno and Adamawa.\n\nOn Friday morning at approximately 12:10 a.m., a group of kidnappers captured six female students at Engravers College in Kaduna, as well as two instructors. The kidnappers are demanding a ransom, which state governor Nasir El-Rufai told reporters is \u201cbeing negotiated\u201d as they \u201c[try] to protect the victims and secure their release.\u201d\n\nBoko Haram has not shied away from using children as bombs, or attempting to forcibly convert them. But, as it has done for years, the Nigerian government insists that they \u2013 and radicalized Islamic members of the Fulani tribe \u2013 are no longer a threat.", "description": "The Nigerian military announced the release of 25 children arrested in Boko Haram raids on Thursday.", "authors": ["Nate Church"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/nigeria-soldiers-boko-haram-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
