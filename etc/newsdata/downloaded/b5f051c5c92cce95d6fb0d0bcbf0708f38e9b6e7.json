(Jonathan Bachman/Reuters)\n\nWe do the best we can with what we\u2019ve got, and we\u2019ve always had just enough because of the support like readers like you.\n\nA Democratic presidential primary \u2014 which just happens to be taking place during National Review\u2019s 2019 Fall webathon \u2014 is always . . . an unusual, target-rich environment for a conservative magazine. I don\u2019t know about you, but for me, the emergence of the clown car of candidates running in 2020 stirred feelings of excitement, instant irritation, a bit of amusement, a dash of dread, and buckets of preemptive exasperation. The Circus of Liars has come to town, and calling them out is set to be the biggest and most furious game of whack-a-mole of all time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI spend a lot of time covering the campaign and reading other publications\u2019 coverage of it. There are lots of fine institutions, and many cover the race quite well. But I think few people recognize how much National Review covers the Democratic primary and how well my colleagues cover it, in depth, breadth, and insight. It\u2019s easy for right-of-center publications to simply shrug and say, \u201cWe don\u2019t agree with these guys, they stink.\u201d National Review listens, reads, studies, analyzes and digests . . . and then explains in detail why we don\u2019t agree with these guys, and why they stink.\n\nBut every now and then we\u2019re pleasantly surprised. Take Andrew Yang. Maybe he intrigues you, or maybe you think he\u2019s nuts. But National Review noticed him early and took him seriously, unlike many other publications. Back in April, our Alexandra DeSanctis interviewed Andrew Yang and sharply assessed, \u201cUnlike the rest of the Democrats, Yang is not fighting for the honor of being the most left-wing candidate on stage. He\u2019s not even especially progressive. He is, ultimately, a technocrat, with a complex explanation for every problem and a corresponding, carefully developed policy solution, which is more feasible in some cases than in others.\u201d Long before most publications had ever heard of the \u201cYang Gang,\u201d National Review was evaluating where he had a point and where he was off his rocker. Our Teddy Kupfer diagnosed that he\u2019s running his campaign as an Internet meme. Howard Husock covered Yang\u2019s past work in attempting to revitalize depressed cities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOr take Marianne Williamson, who is, let\u2019s face it, at least a little strange. But as Kathryn Lopez noted, she doesn\u2019t sound quite so wacky when she describes a country enduring a spiritual crisis and under assault from dark forces of division and rage. Kayla Bartsch observed, \u201cWilliamson understands that we have to re-anchor our politics in the soul of each person rather than in the sparring of nameless groups and faceless systems. Although she is obviously a wacky candidate, Williamson\u2019s aim of solving political problems with energy, atonement, and love is not as far out as it may seem.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael Brendan Dougherty noticed that Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s criticism of the pre-Trump bipartisan foreign-policy consensus echoed that of the current president, and that when other congressional Democrats were eager to demonize the Knights of Columbus, Gabbard defended them. Most mainstream-media institutions either ignored or failed to notice Gabbard\u2019s small deviation from Democratic-party orthodoxy on late-term abortions; you can\u2019t slip something like that past our DeSanctis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(A note about rumors of MBD\u2019s clairvoyance: Five days after Michael wrote his column entitled \u201cThe Beginning of Bernie\u2019s End,\u201d the Vermont senator had a heart attack. Michael, please don\u2019t write any columns entitled \u201cThe Beginning of Jim\u2019s End.\u201d)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, National Review\u2019s coverage isn\u2019t just about spotting those rare diamonds in the rough.\n\nIt\u2019s very easy to write that the Democrats have assembled a bunch of idiots. But only a Mark Krikorian can spell out how the candidates don\u2019t know the basics of our current immigration policy, or how they\u2019re calling for the creation of programs that already exist. When Beto O\u2019Rourke called for gun confiscation, our Charlie Cooke instantly recognized and explained how Beto\u2019s debate-stage rallying cry undid decades of work by the gun-control movement. Madeleine Kearns laid out how the Democratic candidates\u2019 discussion of gender reflects a \u201ctirade of alphabet activism.\u201d Kevin Williamson notes how often progressive voices lament polarization as if it just came out of nowhere from entirely natural sources, like a hurricane \u2014 absolving themselves of any responsibility and ignoring their own role as anti-constitutional provocateurs and culture war aggressors.\n\nAnd the most recent issue features eleven \u2014 eleven! \u2014 writers dissecting the uninspiring record, extreme proposals, and implausible promises of Elizabeth Warren.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot to toot my own horn, but quite a few folks found my recent lengthy and comprehensive timeline of Hunter Biden\u2019s employers, business dealings, partners, clients, and secret meetings extremely useful. In isolation, most of Hunter\u2019s cozy arrangements that created the appearance of a conflict of interest for his father can be explained as legal but distasteful errors in judgment. Put all together, and it\u2019s an indisputable pattern of powerful institutions at home and overseas paying massive amounts to the underqualified Hunter as his father shaped U.S. policy in the Senate and the Obama administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs hopefully you\u2019ve noticed, this stuff is really good. This stuff is also not cheap, or easy, or quick to produce, and yet somehow the team here writes all this \u2014 and records podcasts, and short videos, and produces a biweekly print magazine. You can\u2019t just go down to the local bus station and find a bunch of people who know the issues inside and out, who understand the nitty-gritty of policy details, who can write with clarity and style and wit and insight.\n\nWhich is why we need your support. We don\u2019t have a wealthy Uncle Rupert to throw money our way. We do the best we can with what we\u2019ve got, and we\u2019ve always had just enough because of the support like readers like you.
