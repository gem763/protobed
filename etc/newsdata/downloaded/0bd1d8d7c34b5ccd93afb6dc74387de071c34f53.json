The athlete encouraged students to \u201cshare God\u2019s love with friends\u201d in a 22-second video, viewable above.\n\nThe video was posted to YouTube Aug. 28. However, it began making the media rounds this week after Louisiana\u2019s Big Easy Magazine questioned whether or not Brees was aware he\u2019d supported \u201ca religious group known to be one of the most well funded anti-LGBT organizations in the country.\u201d The clip itself makes no mention of Focus on the Family, though the group is referenced on the official website for \u201cBring Your Bible to School Day.\u201d\n\nAnd while Brees has been vocal about his Christian faith, his participation in Focus on the Family didn\u2019t sit well with some fans given that group\u2019s well-documented opposition to same-sex marriage and other LGBTQ rights.\n\nIn an effort to \u201cset the record straight,\u201d Brees responded to the criticism in a short video posted to his social media accounts Thursday.\n\nHopefully this sets the record straight with who I am and what I stand for. Love, Respect, and Accept ALL. I encourage you not to believe the negativity you read that says differently. It\u2019s simply not true. Have a great day. pic.twitter.com/4RdTahE7EZ \u2014 Drew Brees (@drewbrees) September 5, 2019\n\n\u201cI live by two very simple Christian fundamentals,\u201d he said in the clip, which can be viewed below. \u201cLove the Lord with all your heart, mind and soul, and love your neighbor as yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure why the negativity spread or why people tried to rope me into certain negativity,\u201d he continued. \u201cI do not support any groups that discriminate or that have their own agendas that are trying to promote inequality. \u2026 That\u2019s not what I stand for.\u201d\n\nBrees doubled down on that stance at a Thursday press conference, telling reporters that his video \u201cwas not promoting any group, certainly not promoting any group that is associated with that type of [anti-LGBTQ] behavior.\u201d\n\nDrew Brees addresses his \u201cNational Bring Your Bible To School Day\u201d video that appeared on Focus on The Family platforms.\n\n\n\nHe said he was not aware of the group\u2019s anti-LGBT views. He says hate goes against everything being a Christian is all about. pic.twitter.com/Jjhexqljo0 \u2014 Amie Just (@Amie_Just) September 5, 2019\n\n\u201cI know that there are, unfortunately, Christian organizations out there that are involved in that kind of thing, and to me that is totally against what being Christian is all about,\u201d he said. \u201cBeing Christian is love. It\u2019s forgiveness, it\u2019s respecting all, it\u2019s accepting all.\u201d\n\nBased in Colorado, Focus on the Family has lobbied against same-sex marriage, arguing that there is \u201cno place for it within the context of a Christian worldview\u201d on its official website.\n\nThe group opposed the 2011 repeal of \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell,\u201d which banned gay and lesbian people from serving openly in the U.S. armed forces. It was also an organizer of the now-defunct Love Won Out symposium, featuring \u201cpowerful stories of ex-gay men and women.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Focus on the Family president Jim Daly denounced the backlash that Brees had weathered.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that mean-spirited antagonists have attempted to draw attention away from this event by mischaracterizing the beliefs and positions of our organization,\u201d he told The Washington Post.\n\nAs for Brees, the 40-year-old has previously participated in anti-bullying efforts. In 2012, he joined Ellen DeGeneres and Demi Lovato in signing a petition encouraging the Motion Picture Association of America to change the rating of the documentary \u201cBully\u201d so that younger viewers could access the film.", "description": "The New Orleans Saints quarterback faced backlash after encouraging students to partake in \"Bring Your Bible to School Day,\" a Focus on the Family initia...", "authors": ["Senior Culture Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7277ae3b0000b140d0c032.jpeg?cache=4ppdhcjfsy&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
