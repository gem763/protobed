The move is a direct result of the Trump regime\u2019s sanctions against the South American country, according to the email that users received on Tuesday.\n\nAdobe\u2019s drastic action is an effort to comply with Donald Trump\u2019s Executive Order 13884 which was signed in August and prohibits American companies from doing business in Venezuela. Users will lose access to Adobe products like Photoshop and Illustrator, among other apps, and have until October 28 to download any files before their Adobe accounts are deleted.\n\n\u201cDue to the recent presidential executive order in the United States (Executive Order 13884) regarding activities with the government of Venezuela, Adobe is no longer permitted to provide you with access to software and services or enable you to make any new purchases,\u201d Adobe said in its email to customers in Venezuela.\n\nUsers will not get any refunds, according to a notice published to Adobe\u2019s website, and the tech giant says that the sanctions won\u2019t allow it to issue refunds even if they wanted to.\n\n\u201cWe are unable to issue refunds,\u201d Adobe says on its site. \u201cExecutive order 13884, orders the cessation of all activity with the entities including no sales, service, support, refunds, credits, etc.\u201d\n\nUsers in Venezuela won\u2019t be able to use Adobe\u2019s free services, but Adobe hasn\u2019t explained whether that\u2019s a necessary step to be in line with U.S. sanctions against Venezuela. Adobe did not immediately respond to an email from Gizmodo Tuesday.\n\nCuriously, Venezuelans citizens who no longer live in the country have complained on social media that they received Adobe\u2019s email and aren\u2019t sure if their Adobe services will be cut off. People have taken to Twitter, confused about why they received the email.\n\nHi @AdobeCare\n\nRegarding the email you guys sent to all Venezuelans using Adobe platforms, how does this affect Venezuelans who reside in other countries?\n\nI live in the US, and still got this email.\n\nThank you very much in advance. \u2014 Ren\u00e9e T. (@reneetv) October 7, 2019\n\nDonald Trump has waged economic warfare against the government of Nicolas Maduro, whose military has thus far stuck with the authoritarian as the country continues to struggle.\n\nBasic services like electricity have become more scarce and people are going hungry, conditions that have led to a refugee crisis in South America. And cutting off software access, while a seemingly small act in the grand scheme of things, will certainly make the lives of ordinary Venezuelans that much harder.", "description": "Adobe users in Venezuela received an email Tuesday notifying them that the company will soon suspend their subscriptions and delete their accounts.
