The last visitors to scale the sacred rock were allowed to stay until sunset before a permanent ban took effect.\n\nTo commemorate the climbing ban, news agency Reuters reported, public celebrations took place over the weekend when the dismantling of the trail and its railing begun.\n\nHundreds of tourists clambered up the UNESCO World Heritage-listed 348-metre (1,142-ft) monolith, formerly known as Ayers Rock. Authorities had reportedly opened the climb mid-morning amid clear skies after blustery conditions delayed early trekkers.\n\nAFP PHOTO\n\nUluru is a top tourist draw in Australia despite its remote desert location near Alice Springs in the Northern Territory. While most visitors don't climb its steep, red-ochre flanks, the impending Oct. 26 ban has triggered a surge in people taking a final opportunity to make the trek.\n\nDon't Miss 14.2 K SHARES 6.3 K SHARES 3.3 K SHARES 4.9 K SHARES 4.7 K SHARES\n\nAccording to Australian government data, nearly 400,000 visitors flocked to the Australian landmark in the year to end-June. Australians still make up the bulk of the visitors to climb the rock, followed by Japanese.\n\nThe Anangu people, the traditional owners of Uluru, have called for the climb to be closed since 1985, when the park was returned to indigenous control. The Anangu say Uluru has deep spiritual significance as a route their ancestors took.\n\n\"This is our home,\" read a sign at the base of the rock. \"Please don't climb.\"\n\nAFP PHOTO\n\n\"It shows that Anangu can actually make decisions about the land they own and more importantly Anangu aren't going to have to get sad anymore,\" said Steven Baldwin, national park operations and visitor services manager.\n\n\"Whenever anybody gets sick, or injured, or worse on the climb, they get extremely sad, so this is an absolutely fantastic day for the park and fantastic for Anangu.\"\n\nSonita Vinecombe, a visitor from the Australian city of Adelaide who lined up early in the morning to make the trek, said she had mixed feelings.\n\nREPRESENTATIONAL IMAGE. AFP\n\n\"You want to respect the cultural side of things, but still you want to have it as a challenge to get up the rock,\" she told Reuters.\n\nAmerican tourist Kathleen Kostroski said she would not climb because it would be \"sacrilegious\" to do so. Dozens of people have died while climbing Uluru, from falls and dehydration. Summer temperatures often top 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nAFP PHOTO\n\nThe closure was announced two years ago when fewer than 20 percent of visitors were making the climb. It was an emotional day, said indigenous ranger Tijiangu Thomas.\n\n\"Happiness is the majority feeling, knowing that people are no longer going to be disrespecting the rock and the culture - and being safe.\"\n\nThe recent closure, which took effect on October 26, marks 34 years since the land was given back to the Anangu people, an important moment in the struggle by indigenous groups to retrieve their homelands.\n\nWith Reuters Inputs/Featured Image: AFP", "description": "Hundreds of tourists clambered up the UNESCO World Heritage-listed 348-metre (1,142-ft) monolith, formerly known as Ayers Rock.
