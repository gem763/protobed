JACK DOYLE examines the small print", "language": "en", "text": "His critics said the negotiation was a \u2018sham\u2019, insisting that the EU would never re-open Theresa May\u2019s deal.\n\nBut yesterday, 85 days after entering Downing Street, Boris Johnson announced he had secured a \u2018real Brexit\u2019 agreement that would allow the UK to take control of its money, borders and laws \u2013 and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier admitted that the backstop had been \u2018abandoned\u2019.\n\nMuch of the agreement remains from Theresa May\u2019s original blueprint that she presented to the House of Commons three times only to have it roundly rejected.\n\nBut in critical areas it is different. Here JACK DOYLE examines the small print to see where Mr Johnson has won new concessions and where he\u2019s had to compromise.\n\nMuch of Mr Johnson's agreement remains from Theresa May\u2019s original blueprint that she presented to the House of Commons three times only to have it roundly rejected (Mr Johnson is pictured left in Brussels yesterday, and Mrs May is pictured right earlier this week)\n\nWhat\u2019s the same\n\nFree movement: Like Mrs May\u2019s deal, the agreement states unequivocally that freedom of movement will end after Brexit \u2013 a key demand of the Leave campaign. Home Secretary Priti Patel has already announced plans for a new \u2018points-based\u2019 immigration system based on the needs of industry.\n\nMoney: The calculation of the UK\u2019s \u2018divorce bill\u2019 hasn\u2019t changed. It will be around \u00a338billion \u2013 made up of our share of EU spending commitments and a payment for the two-year \u2018transition\u2019.\n\nCitizens\u2019 Rights: Both sides agree to protect each other\u2019s foreign nationals: Britons living in the EU and EU nationals living in the UK, whose rights will be preserved in perpetuity.\n\nSecurity: The deal envisages close defence and security and cooperation in future including the UK taking part in European defence projects.\n\nAgriculture and fishing: The UK will leave the Common Agricultural Policy and the Common Fisheries Policy, and regain control over its territorial waters.\n\nTransition: Like Mrs May, Boris Johnson has agreed a transition period until the end of 2020 \u2013 with an optional, one-off extension of up to two years - during which little will change. This will allow time for talks on the future trading relationship.\n\nDominic Cummings looks around a corner holding up his iPhone, ahead of the opening sessions of the European Council summit at EU headquarters in Brussels\n\nIt took two personal phone calls at 9.30am and 11am from Boris Johnson to European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker to agree a special 'derogation' for sanitary products\n\nWhat\u2019s new\n\nCustoms\n\nNorthern Ireland will stay part of the UK\u2019s customs territory and benefit from any UK trade deals.\n\nCustoms checks on goods crossing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\n\nAnalysis: In an attempt, to keep the Northern Irish border with the Republic open, and to preserve EU-UK trade, Mrs May agreed to a backstop that would have put the whole of the UK in a customs union with the EU.\n\nThe consequence was to massively constrain the scope for post-Brexit trade deals with the rest of the world.\n\nBut Brexiteers like Mr Johnson argued it was an \u2018instrument of our own incarceration\u2019 that would have tied the UK to EU rules without a say.\n\nWhat replaces it is a fudge, but one which allows the UK to set its own tariffs, opening the door to new trade deals. Legally, Northern Ireland remains in the UK\u2019s customs territory and will benefit from any lower tariffs on imports agreed in new trade deals \u2013 and allowing Mr Johnson to say the country is leaving \u2018as one United Kingdom\u2019.\n\nBut in practice, Northern Ireland will be part of the EU\u2019s customs border, with different tariffs paid depending on the destination. Customs checks, performed by the UK authorities, will take place in port.\n\nVerdict: A pragmatic solution that liberates the UK from the original backstop and allows for trade deals.\n\nSingle market\n\nNorthern Ireland to stay aligned to EU rules on goods and agriculture\n\nAnalysis: Like the original backstop, Mr Johnson\u2019s deal keeps Northern Ireland in effect inside the single market when it comes to a raft of agricultural and industrial goods regulations.\n\nMuch of the 64 pages of the new protocol is made up of lists of the EU regulations \u2013 on cars, medicine and food, that Northern Ireland will have to follow after Brexit.\n\nThis was Mr Johnson\u2019s first major concession, made early in September, and done with the DUP\u2019s agreement. Without such an arrangement, the problem of keeping open a border where cows can stand astride the line \u2013 become insurmountable.\n\nVerdict: A necessary compromise.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson, center, is greeted by Luxembourg's Prime Minister Xavier Bettel, center left, during a round table meeting at an EU summit in Brussels on Thursday\n\nImages of Mr Johnson on Thursday were in stark contrast to Mrs May at an EU summit in 2016 (pictured). May appeared to have been given the cold shoulder by fellow leaders at the event in Brussels\n\nVAT\n\nNorthern Ireland to follow EU VAT rules\n\nAnalysis: The UK will enforce the rules and collect the taxes, but after Brexit Northern Ireland will have to accept EU rules on VAT.\n\nIn theory that would make it impossible for Northern Ireland to cut VAT rates to below EU minimums, unlike the rest of the UK.\n\nHowever there is one exemption, carved out by Mr Johnson at the last minute: an opt out for sanitary products to allow him to reduce VAT rates to zero, from five per cent now, to fulfil a pledge made during the referendum campaign.\n\nVerdict: A win on sanitary products, but more EU alignment for Northern Ireland.\n\nConsent\n\nA vote every four years for Stormont\n\nAnalysis: A major objection raised by critics of the \u2018anti-democratic\u2019 backstop was that there was no way out.\n\nBut Mr Johnson\u2019s deal allows for degree of democratic oversight. A new \u2018consent mechanism\u2019 will give the Northern Ireland Assembly the chance to vote on the new customs and single market rules four years after the end of transition period, which is due to conclude at the end of next year. If the new regime is approved by a simple majority of assembly members then another vote would take place every four years thereafter.\n\nIf there was cross community support \u2013 approval from a majority of both unionist and nationalist members - there would not be another vote for eight years.\n\nIf at any point the assembly voted down the new regime, there would be a two-year buffer period before the rules lapsed. What the DUP wanted was a vote in advance of the rules coming into force, with majorities required on both sides.\n\nVerdict: A significant concession from the EU that allows for a way out of the backstop, but not enough for the DUP.", "description": "Much of the agreement remains from Mrs May's original blueprint.
