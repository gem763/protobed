It is not easy when you concede a goal [before half-time] but after that it was a great game, a proper Premier League game, a proper derby.\n\n\"There is still a long way to go, we are trying to improve the team every week and I think we did a great game, and a mature game here.\n\n\"It is not easy to play with maturity here, but I think we did that tonight.\"\n\nArsenal were only able to celebrate Aubameyang's equaliser following the intervention of VAR, which showed him to be clearly onside when he received Bukayo Saka's pass.\n\nUnited manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer claimed the assistant referee's raised flag contributed to hesitation in his defence but David Luiz had little sympathy.\n\n\"Now with VAR you have to adapt, you have to play to the end,\" the Brazilian said.\n\n\"You can prepare for that in training. It is not easy, sometimes defenders will stop, but you just have to adapt.\"", "description": "Earning a point after falling behind on the stroke of halt-time at Old Trafford pointed to Arsenal's character, according to David Luiz.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/IpwLkcCKTofmXAz1kvMxsw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/PKnj9Rji8N3Ebj9.jljMEw--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/omnisport.uk/f4245c0e9ab3ee0c6767f1f3b6b1854e", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
