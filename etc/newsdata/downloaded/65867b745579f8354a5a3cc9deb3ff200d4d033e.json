The UK-based paper also quoted her as saying that she believed Saudi Arabia told the Moroccan government to silence her husband.\n\nThere was no comment from Saudi Arabia on Moussaoui's claims.\n\nThe Human Rights Watch, in a statement in April, said prison authorities in Morocco were holding Bouachrine \"in a form of abusive solitary confinement for more than a year\".\n\nWhile the journalist was allowed a weekly 45-minute family visit, visits by his lawyers and two 5-minute phone calls weekly, he is not allowed to meet fellow inmates and guards are not instructed to speak with him, the rights group said.\n\nAnother journalist at Akhbar al-Yaum was sentenced to a year in jail in September on charges of abortion and extramarital sex. Hajar Raissouni was pardoned by Morocco's King Mohammed VI earlier this month after the case drew widespread criticism from rights groups, who described it as an attack on media freedom.", "description": "Taoufik Bouachrine was sentenced to jail last year on rape charges he says are politically motivated.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2018/11/10/ccab365d0e604f669342309d8cf7bfcb_18.jpg", "published_at": "2018-11-10"}
