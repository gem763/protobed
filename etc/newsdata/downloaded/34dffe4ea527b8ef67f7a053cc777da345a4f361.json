Following on from a 0.73% fall from Friday, Bitcoin ended the day at $10,380.\n\nA relatively choppy morning saw Bitcoin slide from an early morning high $10,395 to a mid-day intraday low $10,255.\n\nIn spite of the choppy start to the day, Bitcoin left the major support and resistance levels untested.\n\nFinding support through the afternoon, Bitcoin rallied to a late intraday high $10,488. Falling short of the first major resistance level at $10,514.33, Bitcoin fell back to $10,300 levels and into the red.\n\nFor Bitcoin, the extended bullish trend remained intact. Bitcoin continued to hold above the 38.2% FIB of $9,734 having steered well clear of sub-$9,000 levels and the 62% FIB of $7,245.\n\nThe Rest of the Pack\n\nAcross the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was a mixed bag.\n\nMonero\u2019s XMR joined Bitcoin in the red on the day, with a 0.99% loss.\n\nIt was a bullish day for the rest of the pack, however.\n\nEOS led the way, surging by 8.02% on Saturday. Ethereum (+3.96%), Bitcoin Cash SV (+2.8%), and Stellar\u2019s Lumen (+2.73%) also saw solid gains on the day.\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP (+2.34%), Litecoin (+2.2%), and Binance Coin (+0.77%) trailed the pack in spite of the gains on the day.\n\nThe relatively bullish start to the weekend left the majors mixed for the current week.\n\nEOS led the way, rising by 6.63% Monday through Saturday. Ethereum and Litecoin were also in positive territory, with gains of 4.02% and 0.24% respectively.\n\nIt was red for the rest of the pack, however. Bitcoin SV and Binance Coin led the way down, with losses of 11.03% and 6.25% respectively.\n\nStellar\u2019s Lumen also struggled in the week, falling by 3.3%. Losses elsewhere were modest, however. Monero\u2019s XRM was down by 1.53%, with Bitcoin Cash ABC and Ripple\u2019s XRP down by 0.39% and 0.11% respectively.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s dominance eased back to 69% levels following a lackluster day on Saturday.\n\nThrough the current week, the total crypto market cap recovered from a Wednesday low $257.48bn to $266bn levels. In spite of the recovery, another crypto rally is needed to recover to $270bn levels seen at the start of the week.\n\nAt the time of writing, the total crypto market cap stood at $266.04bn.\n\nThis Morning\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 0.19% to $10,360. A bearish start to the day saw Bitcoin fall from an early morning high $10,403 to a low $10,337.\n\nBitcoin left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.\n\nElsewhere, Monero\u2019s XMR (-1.65%), Stellar\u2019s Lumen (-0.7%), Binance Coin (-0.03%), and Bitcoin Cash SV (-0.43%) also saw red.\n\nBitcoin Cash ABC led the way in the early hours, up by 0.98% at the time of writing.\n\nFor the Bitcoin Day Ahead\n\nBitcoin would need to move through to $10,360 levels to support a run at the first major resistance level at $10,469.\n\nSupport from the broader market would be needed, however, to break out from the morning low $10,403.\n\nBarring a Bitcoin breakout later in the day, Saturday\u2019s high $10,451 and first major resistance level would likely pin any upside.\n\nFailure to move through to $10,360 levels could see Bitcoin spend a 3rd consecutive day in the red.\n\nA fall through to $10,320 levels would bring the first major support level at $10,273 into play before any recovery.\n\nBarring a crypto meltdown, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$10,200 support levels on the day.\n\nGet Into Cryptocurrency Trading Today\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n\nMore From FXEMPIRE:", "description": "Bitcoin\u2019s struggles continue while a number of the crypto majors find strong support.
