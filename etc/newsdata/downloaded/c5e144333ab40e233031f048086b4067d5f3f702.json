Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts at the fourth round Democratic presidential nomination debate, but the former vice president has a potentially larger headache \u2013 a lack of campaign cash.\n\nAs Biden was on the debate stage Tuesday night, his third quarter of fundraising filing to the Federal Election Commission was making headlines.\n\nBIDEN'S THIRD QUARTER FUNDRAISING HAUL A WARNING SIGN\n\nAccording to the report, Biden had just under $9 million in his campaign coffers after spending more money than he raised during the July-September fundraising quarter. That\u2019s far less than Warren, who reported $25.7 million cash on hand, and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, another top tier rival who reported having $33.7 million in the bank.\n\nBiden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield, pressed on the report, told reporters in the spin room after the debate in suburban Columbus, Ohio that \u201cit\u2019s more important how you spend the money than how you raise it.\"\n\nAnd she emphasized that \u201cwe have resources that we need to continue to run our race. We\u2019ve always said we think this race is going to be a dogfight, that it\u2019s going to go long. We\u2019re building an operation that is going to be sustained.\u201d\n\nTHE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN\n\nOn Wednesday, Biden said he was confident he had the fundraising to make it to the general election.\n\n\u201cOur fundraising is building. We've raised a lot of money online. And we've raised money offline as well, so we feel confident we're going to be ready,\u201d he told reporters at a campaign event in Ohio.\n\nAnd taking aim at Warren \u2013 who transferred more than $10 million from her 2018 Senate re-election campaign to her White House bid \u2013 Biden noted he \u201cdid not start off by dropping $10 million from a Senate campaign, wherever that money was raised from, into a race.\u201d\n\nIt was just two weeks ago that Biden was left in the dust by Warren, Sanders, and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg when it came to their third-quarter fundraising hauls. And unlike Warren and Sanders \u2013 who\u2019ve brought in most of their money from small-dollar grassroots donations -- much of Biden\u2019s money comes from top-dollar fundraising events with big-bucks donors.\n\nA Democratic consultant who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely called the $15.2 million Biden raised in the third quarter \u201ca devastating number.\u201d\n\nTaking an indirect shot at Biden, Warren campaign chief strategist Joe Rospars highlighted the new data released Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe FEC report data are pretty stark. There\u2019s nowhere to hide from the reality of the dollars and the calendar in front of us,\u201d Rospars tweeted on Wednesday. \u201cIs a campaign\u2019s fundraising growing? Is its spending able to grow going into the early contests, as it must? For Warren, the answers are yes and yes.\u201d\n\nDemocratic operative Michael Ceraso described the new Biden cash on hand figure as troubling.\n\nCeraso, who worked on Sanders\u2019 2016 campaign and who parted ways this summer with the Buttigieg campaign, warned that Biden needs to remain in the top tier conversation or \u201chis cash flow may dry up as the primary enters the homestretch, which may prevent the VP from competing and challenging his opponents in Super Tuesday states and beyond.\u201d\n\nBiden is spending money at a greater rate than the amount he raised left him, with a burn rate of 112 percent. Warren\u2019s burn rate - the pace at which candidates are spending their campaign cash \u2013 was a much more modest 76 percent.\n\nRepublicans spotlighted Biden\u2019s campaign cash on hand figures as a warning sign for a candidate who has already relinquished his status as the unrivaled front-runner in the polls.\n\n\u201cBiden\u2019s money problems are now a crisis for the campaign and if he doesn\u2019t turn it around soon, he\u2019ll end up on the sidelines sooner than anyone anticipated,\u201d emphasized Joe Gierut, press secretary for the pro-Republican America Rising PAC.\n\nFundraising is far from definitive, but like polling, it\u2019s an important barometer of a candidate\u2019s momentum and his or her campaign\u2019s strength. Among the things funds can be used for are building staff and grassroots outreach efforts in the crucial early voting states and running TV, radio, and digital ads.\n\nBiden \u2018eclipsed\u2019 on 2020 debate stage\n\nThe spotlight on the former vice president\u2019s campaign cash numbers came as the spotlight at the debate shifted from him to Warren, who has soared in recent months and is now tied in most national and early voting state polling with Biden for the top spot in the nomination race.\n\nBiden was front-and-center as the debate kicked off, focusing on the Ukrainian controversy and the impeachment inquiry.\n\nBut when the conversation turned to the battle over \"Medicare-for-all,\" the former vice president was mostly absent from the discussion as the spotlight shifted to Warren.\n\nThe populist senator, who has produced one progressive policy proposal after another, grabbed the most speaking time in the debate, roughly six more minutes than Biden, who was second.\n\n\u201cHe faded at times,\u201d noted Mo Elleithee, the founding executive director of the Georgetown University\u2019s Institute of Politics and Public Service and a Fox News contributor. \"He popped his head up occasionally.\n\n\u201cHe did allow himself to get eclipsed by some others, like Buttigieg and (Sen. Amy) Klobuchar and some of the others,\u201d added Elleithee, a senior spokesman for Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign who later steered communications for the Democratic National Committee. \u201cHe\u2019s got to step up. He cannot miss opportunities and I think he missed a few.\u201d\n\nGOP strategist and presidential campaign veteran Colin Reed called Biden \u201cnearly invisible\u201d at the debate and said it\u2019s \u201ca sign of how far this campaign has fallen that no one bothers to go after him.\u201d\n\nBut Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, a top Biden friend and 2020 surrogate, told reporters in the spin room on Tuesday night that being out of the spotlight benefitted Biden.\n\n\u201cUnlike previous debates where the vast majority of the attention was focused on testing or challenging Vice President Biden, tonight was a night when Sen. Warren\u2019s plans on a wide range of issues \u2013 from the wealth tax to 'Medicare-for-all' \u2013 came under repeated questioning,\u201d Coons highlighted.\n\nBiden echoed that sentiment on Wednesday, saying \"it's kind of about time other people get questioned.\"\n\nAnd he pushed back on the labeling of Warren as a co-front-runner, saying \u201cI haven\u2019t seen any polling showing that nationally, on average, that anybody else is a frontrunner.\u201d\n\nFox News\u2019 Jared Halperin contributed his report", "description": "Joe Biden was overshadowed by fellow co-front-runner Sen.
