We didn't have a clue how to start. But then we jumped into a sponsorship and partnership with Fortum, a big international energy company, and they came up with this manure invention.\"\n\nFortum HorsePower, which has helped the event power lights and scoreboards for a fifth consecutive year, provides heat for approximately 1,250 customers in the area, all year round.\n\nAnssi Paalanen, vice president of Fortum HorsePower, said:\n\n\u201cWe first started to use horse manure here in 2015. First in small test amounts and then slowly ramping up the production and getting what is now roughly 10 percent.\"\n\nThe vice president of Fortum HorsePower also said that manure from two horses daily was enough to heat a single-family house for one year and added manure output from the estimated 6 million horses in Europe could satisfy Finland\u2019s entire electricity consumption.", "description": "An entire sports event in Finland has been run on horse manure.", "authors": ["Andrew Robini"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/26/66/48/1000x563_cmsv2_6e1026f3-2985-5442-97e5-33676de6ca35-4266648.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
