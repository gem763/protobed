I want to be in heaven.\u2019\n\nHe would keep asking his parents why they wouldn\u2019t help him die.\n\nOn one family holiday his mum said \u2018he developed really weird obsessions, like he became scared of steps and stairs and of walking on seagull poo\u2019.\n\nSome confused Jack\u2019s illness with behavioural problems (Picture: PA Real Life)\n\nHe developed vocal tics, a stutter, began to regress \u2013 playing with baby toys and watching Thomas the Tank Engine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe would repeat meaningless phrases, screech, or bark like a dog and became sensitive to noise and smells.\n\nMum Alison said: \u2018He looked like a severely autistic child. He was playing with the toys on the floor and was in his own little world. He did not look like Jack, he looked like a lost little boy.\n\n\u2018They thought he might have been on the autistic spectrum, but before this there was nothing suggesting that. It was so sudden and made no sense.\n\n\u2018He was very irritable. We felt like we were walking on eggshells around him. He had really severe mood swings and really isolated himself. He couldn\u2019t cope with people.\n\n\u2018There was one moment when he was jumping up and down on my neck laughing this evil laugh and when he spoke it was like it wasn\u2019t his voice. It was as if he was possessed.\n\nJack and Cara were like peas in a pod before he developed Pandas (Picture: PA Real Life)\n\n\u2018He stopped sleeping in his bed, saying he didn\u2019t deserve to sleep in a nice comfy bed. He would wander around looking for the most uncomfortable place to sleep.\n\n\u2018It was such a severe change in him that there had to be an explanation.\u2019\n\nJack had brain scans that ruled out any neurological issues, but that only added to the stress.\n\nAlison said: \u2018I thought Jack would be happy that his brain was normal, but he was completely devastated.\n\n\u2018He burst into tears and said, \u201cThis has made me feel worse that there\u2019s no reason. This makes me want to die even more\u201d.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJack was eventually diagnosed with a condition known as paediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (Pandas) \u2013 which causes inflammation of the brain.\n\nJack would refuse to sleep in his bed insisting he did not deserve to be comfortable (Picture: PA Real Life)\n\nNot much is known about Pandas, but Jack\u2019s reaction to treatment with antibiotics was immediate.\n\nAlison said: \u2018Within a couple of days of taking antibiotics Jack was his old self again but he deteriorates when his dosage is lowered \u2013 talking about running away and becoming homeless again.\n\n\u2018All the thoughts about dying had come back. And then it became harder to get the medication in him, because he didn\u2019t want to get better, he wanted to die.\n\n\u2018There was one occasion when he\u2019d just come off them and out of the blue he held a knife to his throat and said he was going to die.\u2019\n\nAlison also feels it can be difficult to get ongoing antibiotics, fragmenting treatment.\n\nMum Alison who hopes more research into Pandas can improve science\u2019s understanding (Picture: PA Real Life)\n\nShe said: \u2018I think partly because there\u2019s no published studies demonstrating that long-term antibiotics are beneficial and there\u2019s a reluctance to prescribe them because there\u2019s concerns about us becoming resistant to them.\n\n\u2018For Neil and me it has felt, at times, like we have been judged by everyone. The fact Jack could hold it together sometimes, particularly at school, meant some medics thought it was a lack of boundaries at home causing the problem. One even suggested we take up parenting classes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlison added: \u2018There are some studies that suggest children grow out of PANDAS when they reach puberty, because the immune system matures. But there is a lack of research, so we really don\u2019t know. There\u2019s still a long way to go in terms of getting this illness properly recognised.\n\n\u2018We take each day as it comes but we do feel hopeful.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
