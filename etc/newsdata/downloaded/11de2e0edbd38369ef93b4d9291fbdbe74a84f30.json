The haka requires a response. It's a challenge to you, personally, and it requires a response. I thought it was brilliant and quite imaginative, too.\"\n\nMarler continued to remonstrate with Owens as he left the pitch to take his place on the bench.\n\nColes, though, insisted there were no hard feelings.\n\n\"That's what it's about, I thought it was awesome,\" he said.\n\n\"All the boys were pretty pumped. They (England's players) earn a shitload of money so they can afford the fines.\n\n\"They'd be like 'I'll take the hit!' We were looking around at each other, going: 'Bring it on'. It was awesome. We enjoyed it.\"\n\nAfter the haka, England dominated the early skirmishes, with Tuilagi crashing over for the opening try after just 96 seconds - setting the All Blacks on their way to their first World Cup defeat in 12 years.\n\nAsked about England's haka challenge, Springboks head coach Rassie Erasmus said: \"I don't think it was disrespectful... I wouldn't make a big issue about it.\"\n\nWorld Rugby's decision to fine England opens the governing body to accusations of hypocrisy, however, after trumpeting England's actions with a video post that was widely viewed online.\n\nThe clip on World Rugby's YouTube channel, entitled \"England's incredible response to intense New Zealand haka\", has racked up more than four million views.", "description": "England have been fined for crossing the halfway line during New Zealand's haka after they formed a 'V'-shaped formation at last weekend's Rugby World Cup semi-final.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7994/ce7f3e0b84304f758ceca7936d4bc855.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
