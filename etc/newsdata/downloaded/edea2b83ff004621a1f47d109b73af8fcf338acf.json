Order your copy here.\n\nGus Van Sant has spent the last 30 years crafting one of the most beguiling filmographies of any American auteur. He has won the Palme d\u2019Or and has been nominated twice for an Academy Award for Best Director. He has made films as famed as Good Will Hunting and as shocking as Elephant, as iconic as My Own Private Idaho and as politically important as Milk. His chameleonic cinematic output has featured street hustlers, school shooters, rock stars, drug addicts and skateboarders, he\u2019s searched for, found and explored the drama of youth, the dreams of outsiders, the power of the chosen family. But across the years Gus has also been a prolific photographer. His book 108 Polaroids is a tender document of 15 years of casting calls, a chronicle of those he\u2019s met and worked with. Now another star has passed before his lens; Gus has shot Zo\u00eb Kravitz for one of the cover stories of this issue of i-D. We thought we\u2019d take the opportunity to speak to the man himself\u2026\n\nHey Gus, how are you today? What are you working on at the moment? I am good today. It\u2019s my birthday, so I\u2019m doing some birthday things.\n\nWhat was it like shooting Zo\u00eb Kravitz for this issue? Zo\u00eb and I ran into each other at a party recently and had a nice moment, so I was excited to be able to take her picture for the cover of i-D. We have a number of mutual friends and she now has a husband from Portland, Oregon. It was great to be able to learn more about her \u2013 she\u2019s a very magical person.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about photography and portraiture in particular? I don\u2019t consider myself a very good photographer, but I have taken a lot of portraits of people as a way of remembering them. I try and use different approaches to taking a photograph, but the most successful pictures I have taken are just straight forward portraits.\n\nDo you still shoot a lot of Polaroids? I lost my original Polaroid camera, and replaced it with another one that got broken, and now the film has been mostly discontinued, so I haven\u2019t been shooting a lot of Polaroids recently. The pictures of Zo\u00eb in this issue were taken with a digital Hasselblad, which is somewhat similar in format.\n\nWho is you favourite photographer? And why? I think overall my favourite is F. Holland Day, who would be considered one of the Pictorialists. They were photographers who were working a little like painters, composing and manipulating their pictures rather than using the camera in a documentary fashion.\n\nWhat makes a good photograph? Usually for me it is a frozen moment, something fleeting, a look, an event, or a kind of light, a place, a person, that was only there for that small moment and will possibly never be there again.\n\nHow do you feel about Instagram and the impact it has on photography and the image? To be honest I\u2019m not very well versed in Instagram, I started an account but have a hard time keeping it current, so I\u2019m not sure I could say.\n\nWhat\u2019s the best piece of advice you have ever been given? One pretty good one for me has been to follow your own dreams.\n\nAnd the best piece of advice you could give to anyone who would want to follow in your footsteps? Follow your dream.\n\nSo many of your films are about the ideas of youth, families, outsiders \u2013 what keeps you coming back to these stories? I think they are reflections of how I see myself, so I come back to them because it\u2019s the things that I am relating to.\n\nYet your most recent film \u2014 Don\u2019t Worry, He Won\u2019t Get Far on Foot \u2014 was about a quadriplegic cartoonist. What drew you to this story? Originally I was asked to make a film about John Callahan, and the project had been in development for 20 years. Finally I found a way to do it, but it was a \u201cjob\u201d at first.\n\nIs there one actor you wish you could have worked with? He\u2019s not really an actor, but sometimes I see people that have a kind of peaceful thing about them that I like, and right now that person would be Jimin from BTS. I\u2019d love to photograph him too, but maybe that\u2019s something for the future?\n\nCredits\n\nArchive photograph Bruce Weber\n\nThis article originally appeared on i-D UK.", "description": "Fresh from photographing Zo\u00eb Kravitz for the cover of The Post Truth Truth Issue, we meet the iconic American auteur.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5da443293f14460009e5cbe5/lede/1571046671183-gus-van-sant.jpeg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
