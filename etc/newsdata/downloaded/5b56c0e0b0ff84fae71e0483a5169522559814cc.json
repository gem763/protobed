After swift backlash, The Times updated the story to include the significant detail that some friends of the alleged victim said she did not recall the purported sexual assault.\n\n\u201cMy move would have been the moves that The Times had made. I mean, no one has challenged the basic accuracy of the story that they published,\u201d Abramson told Harris Faulkner Wednesday on \u201cOutnumbered Overtime.\u201d\n\nPogrebin and Kelly have blamed New York Times editors for the gaffe, claiming the significant details were cut during the editing process. The newspaper also revised the story to mention that the alleged victim refused to be interviewed, and has made no other comment about the episode.\n\nNYT REPORTERS BEHIND KAVANAUGH STORY GRILLED ON \u2018THE VIEW,\u2019 BLAME \u2018OVERSIGHT\u2019 BY GRAY LADY EDITORS\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true that material fact was left out and The Times ran an editor\u2019s note explaining that, which is what you do when you leave something out, but it was no conspiracy to leave out that fact. It was, you know, unfortunately, cut from the piece -- as I understand it,\u201d Abramson said.\n\nFaulkner responded by asking how the accuracy could be challenged when the alleged victim, and an alleged witness, didn\u2019t cooperate.\n\nTRUMP RIPS NEW YORK TIMES OVER KAVANAUGH PIECE, CALLS FOR RESIGNATION OF ANYONE INVOLVED IN 'SMEAR STORY'\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to take on something that even the victims doesn\u2019t say happened,\u201d Faulkner said.\n\n\u201cWell, it's friends of the victim\u2026 she has chosen not to talk to the press,\u201d Abramson said, before adding that alleged witness Max Stier went to the FBI over the alleged incident.\n\nFaulkner quickly added that Stier is a \u201cformer Democratic operative for the Clintons,\u201d but the ex-Times honcho downplayed his liberal agenda.\n\n\u201cHe works for a nonpartisan political group now,\u201d Abramson said. \u201cI don\u2019t know that you can characterize him as a partisan. If he was such a partisan, why didn\u2019t he go public with this right during the confirmation hearing when he could have really dealt a blow?\u201d\n\nFaulkner reminded Abramson that Stier did go to the FBI at the time.\n\nAbramson said that proved the investigation into Kavanaugh was a \u201csham,\u201d to which Faulkner asked, \u201cThen why did it end up in your paper?\u201d\n\nNYT REPORTERS BEHIND KAVANAUGH STORY SUGGEST KEY INFORMATION WAS REMOVED BY EDITORS\n\nAbramson responded that the incident is a \u201cthird example of sexual impropriety\u201d by Justice Kavanaugh, to which Faulkner quickly added, \u201callegation.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important,\u201d Abramson said.\n\n\u201cWow, you really think that, without the evidence from the victim's own mouth,\u201d a stunned Faulkner said.\n\nAbramson said that the reporters involved in the controversial piece were her colleagues when she ran the historic newspaper before she was unceremoniously fired in 2014.\n\nWhile Abramson feels The Times handled the Kavanaugh story correctly, not everyone agrees. The paper has been widely criticized by watchdogs on both sides of the political spectrum and President Trump has called for the people responsible to resign.\n\nFaulkner then listed a series of recent missteps by the paper -- including changing a Trump headline amid liberal backlash, admitting plans to shift coverage from Russia to Trump\u2019s alleged racism in audio from a leaked town hall, and apologizing for an inappropriate tweet that was used to promote the controversial Kavanaugh story.\n\nNEW YORK TIMES DELETES TWEET CALLING UNPROVOKED PENIS THRUSTING 'HARMLESS FUN'\n\nAbramson called the tweet \u201ccompletely out of bounds\u201d but dismissed it as a mistake on Twitter, where reporters \u201caren\u2019t as careful with the words they use.\u201d\n\nFaulkner asked Abramson point-blank if she would have allowed the story to run if she were still in charge.\n\n\u201cI would have asked for [the omitted details] to be put in,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no evidence that it was fiction.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFaulkner said it was an omission of facts, to which Abramson said: \u201cit doesn\u2019t make the story itself fiction. It just doesn\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t make the story inaccurate.\u201d\n\nAbramson then said a \u201ccloud hangs over\u201d the Supreme Court because of the allegations against Kavanaugh.\n\n\u201cI have supreme faith and confidence of the top editors both on the news side and opinion side,\u201d Abramson said.", "description": "Former New York Times\u00a0executive editor Jill Abramson defended the Gray Lady, claiming there was \u201cno conspiracy\u201d behind the controversial, now-revised piece on\u00a0Supreme Court\u00a0Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh that omitted key details.", "authors": ["Brian Flood", "Brian Flood Covers The Media For Fox News.
