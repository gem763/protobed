He played a leading role in advancing Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach to foreign policy.\n\nBolton was at the forefront of the president\u2019s policy of maximum pressure against the Iranian regime, which has succeeded in bringing the world\u2019s leading state sponsor of terrorism to its knees economically.\n\nUnder Bolton\u2019s leadership at the National Security Council, combined with that of Mike Pompeo at the State Department, Iran\u2019s capacity to conduct terrorism abroad, intervene in foreign wars, and build its military capability has been undermined.\n\nBolton was an early supporter of the U.S. withdrawal from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) negotiated by the Obama administration. As national security adviser, he was at the forefront of ensuring that this hugely flawed deal cannot be revived by Tehran.\n\nBolton was also instrumental in shaping the U.S. response to the Venezuela crisis and a host of other international issues, from confronting Russian aggression in Europe and the Middle East to pressuring NATO allies to invest more in the common defense.\n\nBolton rightly placed strengthening the transatlantic alliance at the very heart of strategic thinking in the White House and was a powerful adversary for Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia. He consistently stood up to Russian aggression and threats to Europe and made it clear at every opportunity to the Kremlin that the United States would stand with and defend its allies in the face of the Russian bear.\n\nU.S. leadership in Asia was also bolstered under Bolton, and his support for Taiwan helped lead to the best U.S.-Taiwan relationship in 40 years. And he was at the forefront of the Trump administration pushing back on Chinese designs in the Indo-Pacific in ways that strengthened America\u2019s presence and credibility.\n\nAs national security adviser, Bolton was a staunch defender of the fundamental importance of national sovereignty and self-determination, and was a prominent backer of Britain\u2019s exit (Brexit) from the European Union and the U.S.-U.K. \u201cspecial relationship.\u201d\n\nBolton understood the tremendous importance of Brexit to the United States and offered his full backing to British efforts to free itself from the shackles of the European Union. He was a great friend for Britain in the White House and a key architect of the United States\u2019 overall approach to dealing with the European Union under Trump, which represented a significant shift away from the \u201cEuro-federalism\u201d of the Obama administration.\n\nBolton leaves the White House in a stronger position to meet the challenges facing the United States today. He led the National Security Council with resolve and determination at a time when the enemies of the free world seek to harm the United States, its allies, and global security on several fronts.\n\nHe was uncompromising in his view that powerful American leadership matters on the world stage and that the United States must work closely with its key allies to advance U.S. interests.\n\nBolton will be remembered as one of the most effective national security advisers of recent times and leaves a powerful legacy after serving his country in the White House.", "description": "John Bolton served with distinction as President Donald Trump\u2019s national security adviser and significantly strengthened the strategic posture and outlook of the United States as the world\u2019s superpower.\u00a0\n\nBolton advanced a clear-eyed approach to dealing with the myriad threats facing the United States today and was uncompromising in his view that the U.S. must project strength and resolve in confronting its enemies.", "authors": ["Nile Gardiner", "Director", "Margaret Thatcher Center For Freedom", "Bernard", "Barbara Lomas Fellow", "Nile Gardiner Is Director Of The Heritage Foundation'S Margaret Thatcher Center For Freedom", "Barbara Lomas Fellow."], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_optimized/public/images/2019-09/GettyImages-1039322308.jpg?itok=_isjFhNR", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
