Everybody made the decision and everybody stood together and everybody ultimately came through the game and we were proud of our performance.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s happened before but we have protocols in place which helped throughout the game.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s difficult; I don\u2019t want to categorise the whole country by saying that its racist, but there were obviously elements of the crowd making those chants.\n\n\u2018But the second half was a lot better. I don\u2019t know if it was a turning point, but hopefully.\u2019\n\nSouthgate praised the officials for dealing with the situation appropriately and also believes that by at least pausing the game in the first half, his players made a statement.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s an unacceptable situation,\u2019 Southgate told ITV. \u2018I think we\u2019ve made two statements really by winning the game but also we have raised the awareness of everybody to the situation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The game was stopped twice and I know for some people that won\u2019t be enough. But I think we as a group were on board with that process.\u2019\n\nThe England boss did say that if any further racist abuse in the second half would have led to his side leaving the field and probably not returning.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nEngland\u2019s performance on the field was exceptional given the circumstances, as Raheem Sterling and Ross Barkley both scored twice, while Marcus Rashford and Harry Kane also got on the score sheet.\n\nMORE: Raheem Sterling calls out Bulgaria coach after England players suffer racial abuse\n\nMORE: Marcus Rashford praises Bulgaria captain Ivelin Popov over his \u2018courageous\u2019 act at half-time", "description": "Tyrone Mings says the England players and management made a 'unified decision' to play the second half against Bulgaria after suffering racist abuse through the first half of the match....", "authors": ["Phil Haigh"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1181069459_1571129445.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
