Sometimes, it\u2019s because they\u2019re venting and just need an outlet. Other times, it\u2019s a habit they\u2019ve acquired and don\u2019t even realise it. Meanwhile, you\u2019re a silent bystander, taking in every needless detail of their tale.\n\nCNN recently shared advice about how to shut down the over-talker at the office who wastes your time with small-talk \u2014 but over-talkers are everywhere and not just in meetings. (Think about that trainer at the gym who offers unsolicited advice or that passenger next to you on a flight who wants to talk politics.) If a gossiping colleague or talkative stranger won\u2019t ever seem to shut up, we have a few ideas for a quick escape, depending on how well-acquainted you are.\n\nFirst, showing clear signs of disinterest in the conversation might benefit you without having to interrupt them; keep your headphones in, provide one-word answers or physically face your body away from them as a means of conveying that you would really like for the conversation to end. (Just don\u2019t be a dick about it, assuming they\u2019re not being one, either. If I want someone to stop talking, sometimes, I\u2019ll just check my phone and offer a quick apology. They\u2019ll usually take my lead and we\u2019ll go our separate ways.)\n\nIf it\u2019s a total stranger, as in, the canvasser on the street who won\u2019t leave you alone, I like to keep it simple. A succinct \u201cit was nice talking to you\u201d generally works. It conveys that you\u2019re no longer interested in talking, without being a jerk about it or flat-out lying that you\u2019re in a rush.\n\nIf it\u2019s a colleague that won\u2019t seem to get the picture, interrupt them and make it clear you have a deadline or responsibility to attend to. On a recent Reddit thread, u/skeletorjellytor suggested saying something along the lines of \"I\u2019d love to chat, but I really have to focus on this.\" The key part of this advice is offering them another time to talk \u2014 if you\u2019re actually interested in resuming the conversation. \"If you just want them to leave you alone, leave it at that,\" u/skeletorjellytor said. \"No need to make it rude, but you need to be assertive with your time.\"\n\nAnd if it\u2019s a friend that simply dominates the conversation when you\u2019re with them, honesty works best long-term. (Perhaps they don\u2019t even realise the extent of their talkativeness.) Let them know you can\u2019t get a word in or that you want to stay on topic if they tend to veer. Listen and understand when it\u2019s best to interrupt or not to; if it\u2019s them venting, you should expect to be a little more patient than usual. But if they just won\u2019t let up for air, sometimes, the best course of action is cutting to the chase and letting them know you have something to say, too.", "description": "We all know someone who tends to ramble on and on while telling a story.
