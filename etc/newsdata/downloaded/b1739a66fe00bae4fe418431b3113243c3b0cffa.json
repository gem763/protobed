The scars of that childhood will probably never fully heal but nine years ago Robinson met his father for the first time.\n\n\u201cI played for England throughout my career but I\u2019m actually half-Jamaican and half-Scottish,\u201d says the 45-year-old, who became Jamaica's joint operations director earlier this year.\n\n\u201cI was brought up as a Scot, my mum was Scottish, and I didn\u2019t know my dad. I grew up in Harehills and Chapeltown, quite deprived parts of Leeds with a Caribbean community, and I look at my journey now after doing some amazing things in rugby.\n\n\u201cIf I could achieve what I did then how many more kids could there be from these areas who have a talent and may even get into rugby league?\n\n\u201cBeing involved with Jamaica is great for me because as a young lad I looked at guys like Ellery Hanley and if you\u2019re a black kid and you see a black man in a team then it\u2019s something you can relate to.\n\n\u201cMy dad wasn\u2019t there for me but it\u2019s important that I pass my family heritage on to my kids. I said to the missus \u2018we need to get to Jamaica\u2019 because the fact I\u2019m 45 and have never been there is ridiculous really.", "description": "Jason Robinson is universally regarded as the greatest cross-code player of all time and won a combined 75 caps for England, Great Britain and the British and Irish Lions.", "authors": ["Ross Heppenstall", "Maggie Alphonsi"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/rugby-league/2019/10/19/TELEMMGLPICT000000354030-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqbfM8-5DcJ4LA2M2woo7N1DshH3_mIOYyRJZPMkm5hcI.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
