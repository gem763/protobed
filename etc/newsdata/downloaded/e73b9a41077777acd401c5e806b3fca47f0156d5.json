Granted, there was a lot of Trump-bashing, some intense moments where the candidates slung some mud at one another, and the reiteration of trash left-wing policies. One thing is clear: there is not a single person on that stage last night who could beat Donald Trump. It\u2019s not even close. For the three-hours this breakfast was on, we learned that Democrats want to increase taxes, have a terrible health care plan that will gut private health insurance, will confiscate guns, and they don\u2019t like Trump\u2019s trade policy with China, even though they do but can\u2019t say it.\n\nYet, the Free Beacon's Matthew Continetti was stunned that there were no questions about the economy. Job creation was left off. And it\u2019s no surprise why? The economy is booming and despite the liberal media harping on signs of a recession in the hopes that there will be one, the fundamentals are solid. Paychecks are bigger, over three million jobs have been created, consumer confidence is high, unemployment is still under four percent\u2014there really isn\u2019t much to bash other than they don\u2019t like the man who made this all happen. You can\u2019t attack Trump on the economy.\n\nOur own Katie Pavlich noted that there were also no questions about abortion. Probably because the entire field is full of extremists who think it should be permissible to kill babies up until the moment of birth. Late-term abortion has become the final frontier for the baby killer party, who now proudly and unabashedly support this heinous act.\n\nAlso, zero abortion questions tonight \u2014 Katie Pavlich (@KatiePavlich) September 13, 2019\n\nBecause the Trump economy is\n\n\n\n- record low unemployment for ALL Americans\n\n- record job creation\n\n- HUGE wage growth\n\n- jobs coming back to the US\n\n\n\nDemocrats can\u2019t touch that, and they know their socialist policies would just destroy @realDonaldTrump\u2019s success https://t.co/ZZsevUPtaz \u2014 Abigail Marone (@abigailmarone) September 13, 2019\n\nThe lack of foreign policy emphasis in these debates reflects a misunderstanding of what the president actually does. Presidents have unilateral power to do basically whatever they want in the foreign policy domain. Congress conceded that power long ago. Yet, it's an afterthought \u2014 Michael Tracey (@mtracey) September 13, 2019\n\nAlso, and this was brought up by liberal reporter Michael Tracey, there was little emphasis on foreign policy.\n\n\u201cThe lack of foreign policy emphasis in these debates reflects a misunderstanding of what the president actually does. Presidents have unilateral power to do basically whatever they want in the foreign policy domain. Congress conceded that power long ago. Yet, it's an afterthought,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nAgain, given that we have a city mayor, a couple of one and two-term senators, an entrepreneur, and a former vice president who has been wrong on every major foreign policy crossroads in the past thirty years, the Democrat-media complex thought it was well to downplay this portion as well. They cannot make Democrats looks bad. It\u2019s true\u2014they did a good job doing that on their won last night.", "description": ".09/13/2019 15:22:19PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Guy Benson", "Cortney O'Brien", "Katie Pavlich"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/255/7276d7cd-2387-4208-85a8-c95e47fb4775.png", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
