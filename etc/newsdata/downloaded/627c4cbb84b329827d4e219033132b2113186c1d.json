Here\u2019s how it all panned out.\n\nKARDASHIANS JEERED\n\nKim Kardashian and Kendall Jenner presented the award for Best Reality Series \u2014 which RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race won. But the reality siblings suffered an embarrassing moment during their intro, when one hard-to-swallow sentence drew an unexpected laugh.\n\n\u201cOur family knows first-hand how truly compelling television comes from just being themselves,\u201d announced Kim \u2014 and a roar of mocking laughter quickly erupted throughout the audience.\n\nKim and Kendall just got laughed at mid-intro... pic.twitter.com/e0MjUo21Ix \u2014 Scott Feinberg (@ScottFeinberg) September 23, 2019\n\nOmg the audience LAUGHED when Kim talked about them \u201cbeing real\u201d on their show.

Both he and his fabulous headwear took to the stage.\n\n\u201cAnd once again we witness history unfold,\u201d said Kerry Washington as she presented him with the award for his role in a show that tells the story of queer people of colour during the AIDS crisis in New York.\n\n\u201cWe as artists are the people who get to change the hearts and minds of the people on this planet \u2014 please, don\u2019t ever stop doing that,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Lead Actress in a Drama Series award went to Jodie Comer for Killing Eve, beating out her co-star Sandra Oh, also nominated. Comer apologised to her parents, who she insisted stay home in Liverpool, England, rather than come to LA because \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was going to be my time\u201d.\n\nGame of Thrones star Peter Dinklage won Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series.\n\n\u201cI count myself so lucky to be a part of a community that is all about tolerance and diversity \u2014 because no other place would I be standing on a stage,\u201d he said.\n\nThe supporting women of Game Of Thrones had less luck. Despite four different GoT ladies (Gwenoline Christie, Lena Headey, Maisie Williams and Sophie Turner) being nominated in the Best Supporting Actress in a Drama category, the gong went to very nervous first-time nominee Julia Garner for Ozark.\n\nSuccession writer Jesse Armstrong took home the award for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series, and the Brit landed one of the night\u2019s funniest jokes in his speech.\n\n\u201cQuite a few British winners. Maybe too many? Maybe you should think about those immigration restrictions for s**thole countries?\u201d he quipped.\n\nBest Directing for a Drama Series went to actor Jason Bateman, who also directed on his series Ozark. He seemed stunned as his name was read out.\n\nCOMEDY\u2019S BIG WINNERS\n\nTony Shaloub won the night\u2019s first award, for Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series for his work in The Marvellous Mrs Maisel.\n\nAlex Borstein won Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series, for the same show. She downed a quick shot before accepting her award.\n\n\u201cI know a lot of people were upset last year because I wasn\u2019t wearing a bra \u2014 well this year I\u2019m not wearing any underwear. So you\u2019re gonna wanna throw that seat out or clean it \u2026 a lot of sweaty, nervous women in here. It\u2019s like a Bikram yoga class,\u201d she said.\n\nBrit Phoebe Waller-Bridge won Most Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series for Fleabag. \u201cIt\u2019s reassuring to know that a dirty, pervy, messed-up woman can make it to the Emmys!\u201d she said, joking that while writing is difficult, she does it all for the awards.\n\nHarry Bradbeer picked up the award for Directing for a Comedy Series \u2014 also for Fleabag, thanking the show\u2019s creator Waller-Bridge for coming into his life \u201clike some glorious grenade\u201d.\n\nStars Maya Rudolph and Ike Barinholtz presented the award for Best Lead Actor in a Comedy Series with a hilarious bit \u2014 they announced they\u2019d both had laser eye surgery earlier today (\u201cIt was the only time they had available,\u201d sighed Rudolph) and winced as they tried and failed to read the teleprompter correctly. The award went to Maya\u2019s fellow Saturday Night Live alumnus Bill Hader for Barry.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to say Best Lead Actress in a Comedy was an upset \u2014 most assumed Julia Louis-Dreyfus had it in the bag for the final season of Veep, but instead went to a shocked Phoebe Waller-Bridge for Fleabag.\n\n\u201cNooooo! I can\u2019t believe it \u2026 no,\u201d were her first words on stage.\n\nLater in the night, Fleabag also took home the Outstanding Comedy Series award.\n\n\u201cWell now this is just getting ridiculous,\u201d said Waller-Bridge, who also let Harry Bradbeer take the mic again, as he admitted he forgot to thank his wife in his earlier Best Directing speech. \u201cIt\u2019s been a very difficult hour,\u201d he announced.\n\nWHERE IS EVERYONE?\n\nThis wide shot of the audience had us wondering: Have the Emmys been hit by seat filler budget cuts? Were the stars all out having more fun at the bar in the foyer?\n\nA HEARTBREAKING MOMENT\n\nThe cast of Game of Thrones presented the award for Best Supporting Actress in a Limited Series to Patricia Arquette for her role in The Act. Arquette used her speech to pay tribute to her transgender sister Alexis, who died in 2016 aged 47.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy that at 50 I\u2019m getting the best roles of my life \u2026 But I\u2019m so sad, I lost my sister Alexis and that trans people are still being persecuted. I\u2019m in mourning every day of my life \u2026 Trans people are human beings. Let\u2019s get rid of this bias that we have everywhere. Give them jobs,\u201d she said.\n\nBen Whishaw won Best Supporting Actor for his work in A Very English Scandal, admitting at the start of his speech: \u201cI\u2019m hungover. My agent took me out for drinks and I\u2019m hungover.\u201d\n\nAN INCREDIBLE SPEECH\n\nMichelle Williams won Best Lead Actress in a Limited Series for her role as Gwen Verdon in Fosse/Verdon, and delivered an impassioned, inspiring speech that had the audience cheering. She thanked the production \u201cfor supporting me completely and paying me equally, because they understood that when you put value into a person, it empowers that person\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe next time a woman \u2014 and especially a woman of colour, because she stands to make 52\u00a2 on the dollar next to her white male counterpart \u2014 tells you what she needs in order to do her job, listen to her. Believe her. Because one day she might stand in front of you and thank you for allowing her to succeed because of her workplace environment, not despite it.\u201d\n\nBam. And all with no notes!\n\nWilliams finished with a tender shout-out to her daughter with late Aussie Heath Ledger: \u201cMatilda, this if for you, like everything else.\u201d\n\nFirst-time nominee Jharrel Jerome also got emotional when he won the award for Best Lead Actor in a Limited Series for his role in Netflix series When They See Us.\n\nA YAWN OF AN OPENER\n\nHomer Simpson made a surprise appearance \u201clive on stage\u201d to host at the top of the show, a cartoon piano dropping on his head within seconds, as Black-ish actor Anthony Anderson frantically looked for a replacement presenter.\n\nEventually, Breaking Bad star Bryan Cranston graced the stage for a largely earnest monologue about the power of television. It won\u2019t go down as one of the Emmys\u2019 most memorable openers.\n\nFELICITY \u2018WATCHING FROM PRISON\u2019\n\nFormer Emmy-winner Felicity Huffman was recently sentenced to two weeks in jail for her part in the college admissions scandal \u2014 and it didn\u2019t go unremarked upon during the Emmys.\n\nComedian Thomas Lennon served as an offstage commentator during the ceremony, and offered up this quip: \u201cThe producers have asked me to give a special shout-out to any of our previous lead actress winners who are watching tonight from prison. Hopefully, those two weeks are gonna right fly by.\u201d", "description": "Game of Thrones star Peter Dinklage praised Hollywood\u2019s diversity when accepting his Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series Emmy today.", "authors": ["Nick Bond"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/6f68a7590e4bc897984fd906f4af20fa?width=650", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
