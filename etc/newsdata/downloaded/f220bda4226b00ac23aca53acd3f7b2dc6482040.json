In fact, if they\u2019re not careful, a lot of folks will crack once they retire.\n\nPerhaps no other stage of life triggers such intense feelings of excitement and liberation, on the one hand, but, on the other, fear and anxiety. Retirement for many entails a leap of faith after decades of routine. You\u2019re not simply at work Friday, doing your job, and retired Monday, dancing for joy, though. Retirement is a major transition that unfolds over many years, as we move from the life we know into the life we will get to know.\n\nMany pre-retirees do not fully comprehend how dramatically their lives will change.\n\n\u201cI struggled with it,\u201d Nancy Schlossberg says of retiring more than two decades ago from a university teaching career. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t what I expected.\u201d\n\nAnd she\u2019s an expert on transitions and how to navigate them; the author of \u201cToo Young to Be Old: Love, Learn, Work, and Play as You Age\u201d and other books on aging, and creator of a respected academic theory about transitions.\n\nA few lucky souls know exactly what their retirement looks like. The rest of us figure it out as we go. If we go, that is. Many people are simply not psychologically ready to retire, even if they\u2019re financially able. Their job is their identity. They believe that \u201cI work, therefore I am,\u201d and its plaintive corollary, \u201cWithout work, what am I?\u201d\n\nResearch shows that adjusting to retirement is difficult for such people, who report more boredom, anxiety, restlessness and feelings of uselessness. Retired men, for example, were found to be 40% more likely than employed men to experience depression, and the greatest increase in suicide rates between 2000 and 2016 occurred among 45- to 64-year old men, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nSociologist Phyllis Moen suggested that \u201cpeople spend more time planning a wedding than planning retirement,\u201d says Schlossberg, who at 89 years old enjoys a prolific second act as an author and public speaker. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to think about your identity and what you\u2019re losing, and how you get a new identity. What would give you a sense of meaning and purpose?\u201d\n\n\u201cVisualize the kind of person you want to become [in retirement], share it with other people and get their feedback.\u201d \u2014 Karl Pillemer\n\nThere is no one-size-fits-all solution, but there are ways to carry the relevancy of your work life into retirement. Constructing a framework for your retirement should start at least three to five years before the planned date. Assessment and course correction occurs about a year before. A year or so after retirement, the honeymoon period will likely have waned; it\u2019s time then to review how things are going. Give yourself another couple of years for retired life to become your new normal. That\u2019s a six- to eight-year journey that will require flexibility and resilience.\n\n\u201cThis is an entirely new experience,\u201d says gerontologist Ken Dychtwald, co-author of the 1989 best seller \u201cAge Wave\u201d and founder of a consulting firm that bears the same name. \u201cYou\u2019ve been in patterns for decades. How is a person to know what will satisfy them?\u201d\n\nStart by finding your spot on the retirement transition curve. Dychtwald has identified five phases of retirement: imagination (15 to five years before retirement); anticipation (five years prior); liberation (first year of retirement); reorientation (years 2 to 15); and reconciliation (more than 15 years after retirement).\n\nThree years to retirement: anticipation\n\nYou\u2019re past the imagination stage and its fantasies, hopes and wishes. The anticipation stage is reality. Friends are retiring; you\u2019re tired of working, the finish line is in sight. It\u2019s time to seek wise advice on how to handle feelings about leaving regular employment and the supportive social network it typically provides.\n\nSet aside any money concerns for now. Of course, money matters, but there\u2019s plenty of guidance for retirees about your financial portfolio; not so much about your emotional portfolio.\n\n\u201cPeople make the decision to retire based on an economic state rather than a life state,\u201d says retirement coach Mitch Anthony, who teaches investment advisers to help clients plan their life in addition to their finances. \u201cRetirement is a mental-health consideration,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe\u2019ve treated it as if it\u2019s something you have to do, then, \u2018Do you have enough money?\u2019 \u2014 and conversation over.\u201d\n\nRead: Here\u2019s exactly where you should retire \u2014 based on what\u2019s important to you\n\nBeing emotionally grounded going into retirement will likely lead to better, more mindful financial decisions in retirement. Moreover, retired life may require less money than you expect. Find purpose and ways to feel relevant, and your financial plan will seem like a piece of retirement cake.\n\nIn this anticipation stage, ask yourself how you\u2019ll spend time in retirement, which could span 25 years or longer. What activities, interests and lifestyle would be compatible?\n\nOne way to answer that question is to think about retirement not as the end of work but as the start of a late-career transition. \u201cUse some of the tools you might use in conceptualizing a career,\u201d says gerontologist Karl Pillemer, a professor of human development at Cornell University. \u201cWhat are my aptitudes? What are things I like to do?\u201d\n\nRetired men are 40% more likely than employed men to experience depression.\n\nFor instance, if you climbed the corporate ladder, you likely had a mentor and learned how successful people got that way by observing and asking questions. Do the same around your retirement. Find people with a few years of experience living the retirement life you want, and learn how they got it. Asking for direction is a sign of strength, not weakness.\n\n\u201cIdentifying goals in retirement and having perseverance in pursuing them leads to better retirement,\u201d says Pillemer. \u201cVisualize the kind of person you want to become, share it with other people and get their feedback \u2014 especially people who have successfully made the transition.\u201d\n\nOne year to retirement: check-in\n\nIt\u2019s time for a pre-flight review. Says Norman Abeles, emeritus professor of psychology at Michigan State University and an expert on aging: \u201cDevelop concrete steps. What am I going to do the week after I retire? How about six months after that? Talk with your partner \u2014 what are the two of you going to do together? After you visit the grandchildren and have done the traveling, what are you going to do day by day?\u201d\n\nOne helpful preparation tool comes from transition expert Schlossberg: the \u201cfour S\u2019s\u201d of coping with life changes and assessing your social and emotional strengths and weaknesses. These include: your situation with work and family at the time of the transition; your sense of self (outlook, resilience, spirituality); support (self-esteem, social network, role models) and strategy (optimism, reframing, self-management).\n\nRealize there\u2019s a light at the end of the retirement tunnel. \u201cThere will be many surprises along the way, but over a couple of years you will develop a new sense of purpose, a new sense of who you are, and a new way of negotiating relationships and building new ones,\u201d says Schlossberg:\n\nYear 1 of retirement: liberation\n\nYou made it; you\u2019re free to be\u2026who, exactly? Schlossberg has identified several types of retirees: \u201cadventurers\u201d who shake things up; \u201csearchers\u201d looking to fit in; \u201ceasy gliders\u201d who live one day at a time; \u201cinvolved spectators\u201d who are still connected to their careers; and two kinds of \u201cretreaters\u201d \u2014 those who pause to regroup and those who essentially don\u2019t leave their rocking chair.\n\nYou may take on several of these personas, especially in that initial, exciting honeymoon period when being old is new again. Studies show that older people tend to be happier than younger people, reporting greater psychological well-being and life satisfaction. \u201cLearn to have fun again, to make new friends, to have less structure, to try something and fail at it,\u201d says Dychtwald.\n\nAt the same time, the loss of structure and routine understandably can bring up sadness and depression. \u201cAsk retirees what they miss most, and No. 1 is the social connection, the stimulation, the action,\u201d Dychtwald says. \u201cPeople don\u2019t think that through.\u201d\n\nBe resilient and resourceful. Maintain social contacts, stay physically active, practice self-compassion and consider part-time work.\n\n\u201cNot only do you have the possibility of doing something new; you have to have at least some sense of what the choices might be and which might be a match for you,\u201d says Dychtwald. \u201cStop, take a deep breath and look inside. Meet the modern age halfway.\u201d\n\nThree years post-retirement: reorientation\n\nThe honeymoon\u2019s over. It\u2019s been over for a while, in fact. By now, ideally, you\u2019re a year or so into the reorientation stage of retirement. You\u2019ve taken twists and turns, and, finally, you\u2019re settling in.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing people need is to reframe their mindset in terms of what they have to offer the world, and their perspective on aging,\u201d says Chip Conley, author of \u201cWisdom @ Work: The Making of a Modern Elder.\u201d After selling the successful boutique hotel chain he founded, Conley, 58, is now a strategic adviser to Airbnb, the worldwide home-sharing company.\n\nConley views retirement as a time to reinvent yourself and pursue what you\u2019ve always wanted but never dared to chase. Increasingly, older people are doing just that.\n\nAccording to the Kauffman Index of Startup Activity, entrepreneurship in the U.S. is growing fastest among people over age 55. \u201cInstead of being the end of the book, retirement is an added chapter,\u201d says Conley, who in his new role calls himself a \u201cmentern\u201d \u2014 a mentor to younger colleagues and an intern who is eager to learn.\n\nAs the reorientation stage unfolds over a decade or two, people start paying attention to their legacy, which ushers in the reconciliation stage. Your legacy is not the material wealth you leave in a will; it\u2019s how you will be remembered. This is a literal opportunity of a lifetime \u2014 the chance to distribute the wealth of knowledge, depth and wisdom you\u2019ve acquired just by being alive.\n\n\u201cThe storyline of retirement will be less about winding things up and more about transforming oneself,\u201d says Dychtwald. \u201cRather than just becoming elderly, we become elders \u2014 wise, well-traveled and deeply experienced.\u201d\n\nRead more of the Best New Ideas in Retirement\n\n\u2022 How robots and your smart fridge can keep you out of a nursing home\n\n\u2022 Retirement is one third of your life: ignore it at your peril", "description": "Your emotional \u2018glide path\u2019 is as important as your financial plan.", "authors": ["Jonathan Burton", "Asst.
