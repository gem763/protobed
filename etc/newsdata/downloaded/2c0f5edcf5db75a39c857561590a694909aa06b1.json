I enjoyed the film and TV series, but both actors were too young and short to fit Stephen Hunter\u2019s description of Bob Lee Swagger as a tall, lean, grizzled and slow-talking but fast-thinking \u201cArkansas hick\u201d with a hip replacement and assorted other combat injuries.\n\nTo me, there is one actor who can best portray the 72-year-old sniper, and that is Clint Eastwood. As Clint Eastwood at 89 is still acting in films he directs, such as 2008\u2019s \u201cThe Mule,\u201d I\u2019d like to see him direct a film based on \u201cGame of Snipers\u201d and portray Bob Lee Swagger.\n\nUntil then, one can enjoy reading about Bob Lee Swagger in this new novel. In the opening of \u201cGame of Snipers,\u201d Bob Lee Swagger is resting on a rocker on the porch of his Idaho ranch when Janet McDowell arrives unannounced and unwelcomed.\n\n\u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d he called. \u201cJust so you know: this is private property, and I\u2019m not what you call a public fellow. If you\u2019re selling, I\u2019m not buying. If you\u2019re interviewing, I\u2019m not talking. And if you\u2019re campaigning, I don\u2019t vote. But if you\u2019re lost, I will happily give you directions, and a glass of water,\u201d Mr. Hunter writes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not lost, Mr. Swagger \u2014 Sergeant Swagger. It took me days to find out where you lived. I know you don\u2019t like interruptions, and there\u2019s no reason you should, but I would claim the right to a hearing because of the circumstances\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201c he said, thinking, oh, Lord what now?\n\n\u201cMy son. Lance Corporal Thomas McDowell, sniper, 3/8. Baghdad, 2003. Came home to me in a box.\u201d\n\nAnd Mom wants the sniper who killed him dead.\n\nBob Lee Swagger recalls that the Iraqis had an effective sniper program and many Americans died, but then an American team analyzed data and designed new strategies to counter the sniper program. So our dying went way down and theirs went way up, he noted.\n\nThe woman told him that after her son died, she traveled to Iraq seven times. She had been raped four times, bilked by con artists three times and beaten three, once severely, while trying to learn who killed her son. She used money from the sale of her house, and she became a Muslim to understand the killer. She learned about an outsider who trained the Iraqis with a Russian sniper rifle and taught them effective tactics. He later vanished when the Americans gained the upper hand.\n\n\u201cHe was called \u201cJuba the Sniper,\u201d she told him.\n\nBob Lee Swagger admired the determined woman, but the principled former sniper told her that he would not kill the sniper for her, as that would be murder, not war, and revenge, not justice. But he tells her that he has a contact in the Israeli Mossad, and he offers to go to Israel and tell them about Juba the Sniper.\n\nThe elderly former sniper meets with the Mossad. They tell him about an Israeli agent who was shot by a sniper with a very long and impressive shot. They also suspect Juba of firing on a school bus and killing several children. The Mossad tells Bob Lee Swagger that Juba is a Syrian, a Sunni peasant named Alamir Alaqua.\n\nThe American sniper suggests taking him out, but the Mossad officers want to have a chat with him.\n\n\u201cBut Juba\u2019s secrets are more important than his life,\u201d a Mossad officer tells Bob Lee Swagger. \u201cWho can he identify? What is he working on? \u2026 Perhaps most important, what is the source of their considerable funding.\n\nBob Lee Swagger accompanies the Mossad on a raid that delivers some of the answers to these questions and suggests that the sniper is heading to America. Bob Lee Swagger once again becomes a gun consultant on the FBI/Mossad team as the manhunt for Juba in America begins.\n\nThe most important aspect of Stephen Hunter\u2019s Bob Lee Swagger thrillers is guns. Mr. Hunter gets guns \u2014 and he gets guns right. As a gun enthusiast and shooter, he knows guns.\n\n\u201cGame of Snipers\u201d is a suspenseful, interesting and action-packed thriller. I hope Clint Eastwood reads it and thinks about portraying Bob Lee Swagger.\n\n\u2022 Paul Davis covers crime, espionage and terrorism.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nGAME OF SNIPERS: A BOB LEE SWAGGER NOVEL\n\nBy Stephen Hunter\n\nG.P.Putnam\u2019s Sons, $27, 400 pages\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
