REUTERS/Massimo Pinca\n\nThe 21-year-old Monegasque\u2019s victory at the Italian Grand Prix on Sunday triggered scenes of intense emotion at Ferrari\u2019s home race and catapulted Leclerc ahead of Vettel in the standings.\n\nThe newspaper headline writers left no doubt about the prevailing sentiment on Monday.\n\n\u201cReclerc\u201d declared the front page of the daily Gazetta dello Sport, playing on the Monegasque\u2019s surname with the Italian word for king and announcing the coronation of the team\u2019s \u2018little prince\u2019.\n\nVettel, a four times world champion who endured a bleak afternoon at Monza and was lapped by his team mate after collecting a 10 second stop/go penalty for dangerous driving, was highlighted as a man in crisis.\n\nThe victory at Monza was Leclerc\u2019s second in a row, following on from his breakthrough in Belgium the previous weekend, but the first by a Ferrari driver since 2010.\n\nTellingly perhaps, the last Ferrari driver to take back-to-back wins in Belgium and Italy, Formula One\u2019s two fastest tracks, was Schumacher in his debut season with the team in 1996.\n\nLeclerc, too, is in his first season with Ferrari, a team celebrating their 90th anniversary, and two thirds of the way through the campaign the youngster is ahead of Vettel on points, poles, podiums and wins.\n\nLeclerc also showed in Monza that \u2014 like most great drivers including seven times world champion Schumacher \u2014 he can be fearless but also selfish and ruthless when it suits his purposes.\n\nTeam boss Mattia Binotto alluded to this when he congratulated him over the team radio at the finish by saying \u2018you are forgiven\u2019, referring to shenanigans in Saturday\u2019s qualifying.\n\nLeclerc had taken pole on the basis of his first fast lap in the final shootout, with the final minutes descending into farce with no driver willing to take the lead and allow others to slipstream.\n\nWithin Ferrari, sources said, it had been agreed that Leclerc would give Vettel the necessary tow but that never happened and the German was not impressed.\n\nIn the race, Leclerc also showed he was willing to push the rules to the limit \u2014 triggering a black and white warning flag, the equivalent of a yellow card in soccer, when he squeezed Mercedes\u2019s Lewis Hamilton off the track.\n\n\u201cThe racing was very hard, maybe over the line \u2014 and Lewis I think was instrumental in not making it an incident,\u201d commented Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff.\n\n\u201cBut at the end of the day, what do you do? You give a leading Ferrari in Monza a five-second penalty? Out of the question... because then we need a police escort out of here.\u201d\n\nLeclerc, like the Schumacher of old, was aggressive and single-minded after seizing his chance and starting from pole position.\n\nUnlike the German, he addressed the crowd afterwards in fluent Italian. The crowd had no need for forgiveness, they already had their favourite.", "description": "Sebastian Vettel was supposed to be the man to follow in Michael Schumacher's footsteps at Ferrari but the heir apparent to the master of Maranello is looking more and more like Charles Leclerc.", "authors": ["Alan Baldwin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1427895716&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF880U8-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
