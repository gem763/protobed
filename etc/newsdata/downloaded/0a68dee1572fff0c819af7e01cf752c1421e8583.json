Bloomberg\n\nEveryone knows stocks soared under Trump. Everyone did not know that would happen before he won. Heading into November 2016, strategists and economists focused on his unpredictability, his protectionist ideas, instead of pro-growth policies like tax cuts. Many predicted a more volatile Trump would send stocks into a correction.\n\nStrategists at RBC Capital Markets said prior to Election Day that a Trump victory would send the S &P 500 down 10 to 12 per cent. Barclays had predicted a drop of as much as 13 per cent. The team at JPMorgan advised investors to sell the rebound that materialised just a few hours after Trump won.\n\nOur economy is bigger than one person or one election cycle. \u2014 Nationwide's Mark Hackett\n\nIt wasn't just stock handicappers. Two economics professors, Justin Wolfers and Eric Zitzewitz, wrote a paper on the topic for Brookings in October 2016. They analysed the futures market during the first presidential debate and extrapolated the reaction to conclude a Trump win would send stocks down 10 per cent to 15 per cent.\n\nA Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist posited that a Trump presidency would cause a stock market crash and could plunge the global economy into recession.\n\nPartly, it was a reflection of polling data. Since Trump was viewed as a long shot, many predicted investors would be shocked into selling if he won. That was the thinking at Citigroup, where strategists said the S &P 500 could lose 3 per cent to 5 per cent immediately. They added that a Trump win would also pose risks to stocks in the long term.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe first prediction came true. S &P 500 futures were halted after a 5 per cent plunge in the hours after the 2016 race was called. But they rebounded just as fast and the index has gained more than 40 per cent since Trump's election.\n\nIt was much the same for Barack Obama as he ran for re-election against Mitt Romney in 2012. Two months ahead of the election, nearly 50 per cent of respondents in a Bloomberg survey said a win for the incumbent would be a negative for US financial markets. That's even after the S &P gained 42 per cent from Obama's first election to his second.\n\nAmong prognosticators who muffed the call was Donald Trump, who said in a November 2012 tweet that both the stock market and the US dollar would plunge following Obama's second victory. The S &P 500 rose almost 50 per cent in that term, bringing his eight-year return to 112 per cent, while Bloomberg's dollar index gained 21 per cent in the four years that ended in November 2016.\n\nIn the heat of an election, people let their emotions take over and exaggerate the impact a president will have on the economy and markets, according to Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide Funds Group.\n\n\"The most nay-saying people to Barack Obama will admit that there was not a transformation of our economy in any way that they would've feared the day he got elected. Same thing with the Democrats with Trump. There hasn't been this transformation that was feared,\" Hackett said in an interview at Bloomberg's New York headquarters. \"Our economy is bigger than one person or one election cycle.\"\n\nAnother forecasting entity that often miscalculates is the stock market itself. Shares plunged more than 5 per cent the day after Obama was elected to his first term and the loss in the S &P 500 swelled past 3 per cent the second time. Neither proved prescient.\n\nEven as the evidence points to how difficult it is to nail the predictions, the prognostications are likely to continue streaming in -- and anxiety is likely to spiral heading toward November 3, 2020 as the battle for the presidency heats up.\n\n\"Political risks are obviously still out there,\" Jennifer Foster, co-chief investment officer of equities at Chilton Trust, said in an interview at Bloomberg's New York headquarters. However, the election is \"still a year away -- there's still a lot of time for things to happen. Trying to take those risks and assign them to equity valuations today just feels like an exercise in futility.\"\n\nWashington Post", "description": "Everyone knows stocks soared under Donald Trump.
