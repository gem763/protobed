I didn't expect it to happen. When it happened I was devastated. I thought it was going to be Dean and I calmed down when Lord Sugar said he had lost us profit. But then he flipped back to me and I knew.\n\n'When they said they sold nothing, I knew I was a dead man walking.'\n\nA pivotal moment which led to Kenna's exit was when Dean and Ryan-Mark briefed the manufacturing team on the premium lolly the corporate client expected, comprised of raspberries, coconut milk and glitter -retailing at \u00a33.85 each.\n\nWith the unimpressed client saying the lollies resembled 'something rude', Dean dropped the price to the bargain basement price of \u00a31.25 each - with the client refusing to pay more than a pound, and Dean walking away from the deal.\n\nLord Sugar later slammed the team's products in the boardroom, saying their premium lolly resembled a 'pig's trotter.'\n\nLucky escape: In an exclusive interview with MailOnline, Kenna laid the blame for the failure firmly at sports management company owner Dean's door\n\nHarsh: Lord Sugar slammed the team's products in the boardroom, saying their premium lolly resembled a 'pig's trotter'\n\nAccused of 'divorcing himself' from the sales process in the boardroom, Kenna hit back and said: 'I did not walk away from the process, I trusted them to make a decision, I gave them clear instructions to sell. Dean walked away from the deal.\n\n'Dean 100 per cent deserved to be fired.I think he is living on borrowed time, Ryan-Mark, Souleyman (Bah), they haven't done much. There's a lot of the girls who are flying under the radar too.'\n\nKenna said he believes this was the death knell for the task- particularly as a separate team smashed their sales of healthy blueberry and lavender lollies at London Zoo.\n\nHe said: 'We had only seen the ice lollies in liquid form, we didn't know what they would turn out like.\n\n'We had been given a really broad brief by the team, we made that brief. I had never worked with glitter before so I didn't know it would vanish into the mixture.\n\nStress: Kenna said he believes this was the death knell for the task- particularly as a separate team smashed their sales of healthy blueberry and lavender lollies at London Zoo\n\n'I told them when we saw the lollies, stick to the price, get something. I didn't want to lose out hundreds of pounds, I would never have expected them to walk away from a deal with nothing.'\n\nAs to who he would tip to win the \u00a3250,000 investment from Lord Sugar, he said: Carina (Lepore - who led the girls team to victory) has been brilliant, she's sharp, she knows what she's doing. She's good.\n\n'Lewis (Ellis) as well. I know had some issues last week but he helped me so much in the task. He's a contender, he's really come on. He could win.'\n\nKenna said his exit in only the second week of the competition had surprised him, as he thought he would make it halfway.\n\nHe said: 'I told my mum when I was going through the process, I'll see you in seven or eight weeks, and to go out in week two is devastating. But I'm carrying on with my business.'\n\nThe Apprentice continues next Wednesday at 9PM on BBC One.", "description": "The second episode of The Apprentice 2019 saw ice-cream manufacturer Kenna Ngoma become the latest casualty of the boardroom - in an ice lolly task,", "authors": ["Eve Buckland For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/22/19513096-0-image-a-101_1570657413829.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
