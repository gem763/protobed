In 1958, he stuck up for compatriot Mike Hawthorn following his exclusion from the Portuguese Grand Prix. Hawthorn was disqualified for proceeding against the racing direction, but Moss defended his sole title rival and Hawthorn\u2019s second place was reinstated. Hawthorn would go on to beat Moss to the championship by a single point.\n\nMoss only officially retired from motor racing in 2011, but after he fell ill with a serious chest infection shortly before Christmas in 2016, and spent 134 days in a Singapore hospital, he soon retired from public life.\n\nLast weekend\u2019s Goodwood Revival honoured Moss\u2019 90th birthday. His wife, Lady Susie Moss was in attendance but Moss was not well enough to be present for the celebration.\n\nSingapore plays host to this weekend\u2019s 15th round of the season as Hamilton bids to increase his 63-point championship lead.", "description": "Lewis Hamilton has hailed Sir Stirling Moss as a \u201cliving legend\u201d on the eve of the British motor racing driver\u2019s 90th birthday.
