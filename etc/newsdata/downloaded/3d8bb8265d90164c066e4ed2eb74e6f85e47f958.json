She had worked at the school for one year.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cAll I know is I was 22 years old, I was 6 months pregnant, and the job that I had been promised for the next year was going to someone else. The principal said they were going to hire someone else for my job,\" Warren told CBS News in an interview.\n\nThe outlet raised questions about the story after a previous interview in 2007 showed Warren telling the same story without the phrase \u201cshowed me the door,\u201d which she has used while repeating the story on the campaign trail.\n\nIn the 2007 interview at the University of California, Berkeley, Warren said, \u201cI went back to graduate school and took a couple of courses in education and said, 'I don't think this is going to work out for me.' I was pregnant with my first baby, so I had a baby and stayed home for a couple of years,\u201d according to CBS.\n\nWarren said she hadn\u2019t noticed that she had changed the phrasing.\n\nShe addressed the differences on Monday, telling CBS she has decided to \u201copen up\u201d about her past since her election to the Senate in 2012.\n\n\u201cAfter becoming a public figure I opened up more about different pieces in my life and this was one of them. I wrote about it in my book when I became a U.S. Senator,\" Warren told CBS in a statement from her campaign.\n\nCBS News cites a story from The Paterson News, a local paper, that reported that summer Warren was \u201cleaving to raise a family\u201d and another story said Warren \u201cresigned for personal reasons.\u201d\n\nWarren repeated to CBS News that she had been offered the job for the following year, while she was hiding her pregnancy, and several months later when she \u201cwas six months pregnant and it was pretty obvious\u201d the principal said he would hire someone else.\n\n\u201cWhen someone calls you in and says the job that you've been hired for for the next year is no longer yours, 'We're giving it to someone else,' I think that's being shown the door,\u201d Warren said in the Monday interview.\n\nCBS News said two retired teachers who worked for Riverdale Elementary for more than 30 years, including the year Warren was there, told CBS News they believed a nontenured pregnant employee like Warren would have had little job security at the school in 1971.\n\n\u201cThe rule was at five months you had to leave when you were pregnant. Now, if you didn't tell anybody you were pregnant, and they didn't know, you could fudge it and try to stay on a little bit longer,\" one teacher, Trudy Randall, told CBS. \"But they kind of wanted you out if you were pregnant.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Warren campaign was not immediately available for comment.\n\nWarren has risen to the top of the primary field, alongside former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenA dozen House Democrats call on EU ambassador to resign amid Ukraine scandal Ex-Trump officials met with Zelensky campaign aides at Trump hotel earlier this year: report Overnight Health Care \u2014 Presented by Coalition Against Surprise Medical Billing \u2014 Buttigieg unveils aggressive plan to lower drug prices | Supreme Court abortion case poses major test for Trump picks | Trump takes heat from right over vaping crackdown MORE and Sen.
