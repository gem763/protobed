Markets are at dizzying levels, with cheap money so easy to come by that investors are oblivious to the risks of some investments, and demand virtually no extra yield over safer assets for holding them.\n\nWhat if markets were to look down \u2013 and panic at how little support there really is in a world beset with slowing real economies, and unpredictable politicians happy to use trade, capital flows and technology as weapons in their geopolitical struggles? The review says that \u201casset prices are vulnerable to a destabilising correction if risk premiums were to rise suddenly. This could be triggered by a negative growth shock, geopolitical event, major credit event, or normalisation in term premiums.\u201d If over-leveraged investors can't find buyers for the assets they need to dump, then the immense borrowings that have propped up the global economy since the last debt meltdown of 2008 will start to weigh heavily on the world again.\n\nAmid such gloom, the review says that Australia\u2019s outlook has actually improved a bit. The housing recovery means that the spectre of negative equity against housing loans has been removed. If anything, banks are back furiously competing with each other for new housing business, anxious to maintain market share and volume against rising competition.\n\nThis review was particularly important because it looks at how ultra-cheap money that has propped up the world economy since 2008 is affecting our traditionally strong banking system. That's the question that lies behind Prime Minister Scott Morrison\u2019s extraordinary outburst against the banks this week. The RBA is cutting the cash rate to try to trigger the investments that will maximise the people in work and kickstart national growth. When the banks passed on to borrowers less than half of Tuesday\u2019s official rate cut, Mr Morrison emotively accused them of \u201cprofiteering\u201d.\n\nAll big four banks have defied the government's pressure to pass on the full rate cut to customers. Ryan Stuart\n\nBut there is a world of difference between profiteering, and making a profit that preserves the financial system. The RBA depends on the commercial banking system to transmit lower rates to the public. But when official rates get down to today\u2019s ultra-low levels, the margins are very fine before you start damaging the transmission mechanism itself. Banks depend for 80 per cent of their revenue on the difference between what they pay for deposits and what they charge borrowers. That is now being crunched. Borrowers well outnumber depositors, but if banks lend by making depositors take more of the pain, they go elsewhere, to the unregulated finance system or just under the mattress. The review, however, says that Australian banks still have room to cut interest on retail deposits \u2013 unlike overseas, deposit rates have not actually hit zero or gone negative. If bank margins are being hurt, they reckon it is because of healthy competition or remediation for the sins exposed at the Hayne royal commission.\n\nBut banks and their investors disagree. They have sizeable institutional deposits that already pay no interest and can\u2019t be raided each time the cash rate is cut. If bank profits fall, then retirees lose dividend payments too, and all super savers get hit. And mediocre profits hit the banks\u2019 ability to do their job and lend out money \u2013 which they will not do without a return. At the moment, banks are balanced between supporting the economy with lower rates, and making the margins on which a stable banking system depends. It should stay that way.\n\nBut this is all laced with a potted version of the populist politics that is unsettling global markets. One reason for the government\u2019s fury with the banks is that if monetary policy cannot induce more growth then the pressure comes back on Canberra to do more. That would mean either unacceptably risking the surplus with extra fiscal stimulus, or using political capital to push for supply-side reforms to make the economy more resilient. The government has proved reluctant to spend the latter. But in a world that is slowing down to stall speed and increasingly unpredictable with it, that is better than piling political pressure on a vital pillar of the economy.", "description": "The cost of a stable banking system is healthy margins for banks.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3027%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/fb1a1f08b925e6a9c3b87ff3e6a51bfeb0b3e600", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
