Well, February is National Heart Month, an annual event put on by the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC). It\u2019s a great time for brushing up on your heart health knowledge, making any necessary changes in your own approach to heart health while sharing information on America\u2019s leading cause of death. That includes learning if you\u2019re at risk, why you may be at risk, and most important, how to reduce or prevent that risk.\n\nI urge you to give National Heart Month\u2019s events and other offerings your utmost attention. And I promise you, hand on my own heart, that you will find invaluable information that just might guide you to make heart-saving, life-saving changes in your life.\n\nWould that not make February the most important month of your life?\n\nAn extraordinary effort for an urgent cause\n\nThe CDC has created a truly impressive array of learning and sharing materials and opportunities. And for good reason\u2014630,000 Americans die from heart disease each year\u2014that\u2019s 1 in every 4 deaths.\n\nIt\u2019s heartbreaking that so many of these deaths could have been prevented. So to me, spreading the word on prevention is imperative.\n\nThe CDC has left no word-spreading tactic unused. That includes \u201ctweets\u201d to pass along on Twitter, and emails already written for you. Send them to people you want to share the heart-health message with.\n\nNational Heart Month also includes great ideas like organizing and leading a 20-minute group walk around your office at lunchtime. They even provide you with heart healthy information to share with your coworkers.\n\nThey also suggest conducting a cooking demonstration using a heart-healthy recipe. Invite your friends, family, or neighbors to share good food and good ideas.\n\nYou might also visit the CDC\u2019s Million Hearts Facebook page to learn more about heart disease and stroke prevention\u2014and share with your online friends.\n\nGet My FREE Curcumin Report Chronic Inflammation Decoded\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget National Wear Red Day to raise awareness about women and heart disease. You may have seen people in your community wearing red on February 1, 2019.\n\nThe key word here is celebrate.\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of discouraging news, for sure. But National Heart Month is also a time to take hope\u2014and take action. Every year brings new and often game-changing breakthroughs in prevention and restoration.\n\nUnderscoring the breadth and depth of materials available is insightful recognition that discussing heart health with a loved one can be difficult. So you\u2019ll find \u201cHeart Health: Conversation Starters,\u201d to help you.\n\nChoosing the best foods can be a challenge, too. So there\u2019s even a resource called \u201cHeart Healthy Foods: Shopping list.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ve heard that keeping track of your activity and everything you eat and drink is important, but don\u2019t know how to start?\n\nFind your \u201cDaily Food and Activity Diary\u201d already set up for you.
