Poor Jack, although his attention is probably elsewhere now\u2026\n\nBrooke spilled the afternoon tea with Ella (Picture: Channel 4)\n\n\u2018Joyce\u2019 chooses to hang out with Tim\n\nBeth and Jack decided that Joyce would want to send more time with Tim, as they had got it into their heads that as they are the older contestants, they would immediately fancy each other.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir plan went up in smoke after Tim revealed that he is gay \u2013 and he threw the pair a serious curveball by asking the breed of her dog Dora.\n\nTim is getting suspicious (Picture: Channel 4)\n\nBeth and Jack were stumped before eventually answering that Dora is a cockapoo.\n\nHave they done enough to throw Tim off the scent?\n\nThe Circle airs weekdays at 10pm on Channel 4.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
