But I think 'Gilligan's Island' has a whole history. It's the first sitcom to come out of the living room. No, mothers and fathers; it was seven misfits that tried to get along. I think it had a lot to say,\u201d she says.\n\n10 THINGS YOU DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT 'GILLIGAN'S ISLAND'\n\nLater in the evening, after friends including Ruta Lee (\"Seven Brides for Seven Brothers\"), Alison Arngrim (\"Little House on the Prairie\"), and Erin Murphy (\"Bewitched\") paid tribute to her and the sitcom's long-lived success, Wells admitted that it wasn\u2019t until after portraying Mary Ann that she really realized the impact of the character.\n\n\u201cMary Ann was your first crush. She'd been the girl you\u2019d marry. She\u2019d be your best friend,\u201d she said tearfully, with a pang of nostalgia.\n\n\"Mary Ann was your first crush. She'd been the girl you\u2019d marry. She\u2019d be your best friend.\" \u2014 Wells on her character, Mary Ann Summers, whom she played on the beloved series from 1964-1967\n\nLloyd Schwartz, the son of \"Gilligan\u2019s Island\" creator Sherwood Schwartz (who died in 2011), deemed it an honor that people still enjoy his father\u2019s creation today. He also admitted to being asked, over and over, \"When will there be a reboot?\u201d\n\nIf this were to happen, count Wells in. \u201cI\u2019d like to see what they\u2019d be doing 50 years later,\u201d she says. And as far as the plotline? It would have to be in line with the original show: \u201cSame thing. Tying to get off that island!\"\n\n'GILLIGAN'S ISLAND' STAR DAWN WELLS SAYS SHE IS 'GRATEFUL' FOR 'FRIENDS AND FANS WHO CARE' WHILE SUFFERING FINANCIALLY\n\nBut Schwartz has a different reboot in mind: Think feature film, with modern-day and cutting-edge special effects. \u201cI would like to see a large movie. I want shipwrecks and volcanoes and things!\u201d he said enthusiastically.\n\nSchwartz said there is, in fact, a \"Gilligan\u2019s Island\" film in development. \u201cIt\u2019s been in development for a long time,\u201d he shared, adding that he thinks it will happen within the next five years.\n\n'GILLIGAN'S ISLAND' STAR DAWN WELLS TALKS MARY ANN'S SEX APPEAL\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been in development for a long time.\" \u2014 Lloyd Schwartz said of a 'Gilligan's Island' movie\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very close!\u201d he exclaimed. And he\u2019s gunning for \u201cseven major stars\u201d to bring the movie rendition to life, revealing that he\u2019s had his eye on Steven Martin as Mr. Howell, Beyonce as Ginger, Jeff Bridges as Skipper and Kevin Hart as Gilligan.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s little so the Skipper can call him 'Little Buddy.' And he just has that every-man kind of attitude,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Entertainment Weekly, at the time of Sherwood's death eight years ago, he and Lloyd were working on a \"Gilligan's Island\" movie for Warner Bros., which Lloyd said, at the time, would go on as planned.\n\nAs for Wells? She would love to reprise her role as Mary Ann all these years later but says if Schwartz\u2019s rendition gets made, she\u2019d be happy to sign on as Mrs. Howell. \u201cIt would be fun!\u201d\n\n'GILLIGAN'S ISLAND' STAR DAWN WELLS EMBARRASSED FINANCIAL STRUGGLES WERE MADE PUBLIC, THANKS FANS FOR SUPPORT\n\nThe actress credited fans with the kind of loyalty that has lasted for decades. This definitely rang true in 2018 when a supporter created a GoFundMe page, which raised $197,000, to help pull the actress out of some financial troubles.\n\nWhile Wells didn\u2019t touch on this specifically during the interview, she was quick to tell Fox News that she\u2019s extremely grateful for all the love she\u2019s received from \"Gilligan\u2019s Island\" lovers throughout the years. \u201cYou're grateful. That's all I can say. They love the show, they love the characters. And you couldn't ask for anything better really,\u201d she said.\n\nFlashing back to her days on set, Wells says the cast of \"Gilligan\u2019s Island\" was a tight-knit crew.\n\n\u201cWe were a very good group. We loved each other and we worked hard,\u201d she explains.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nWhile they were in serious actor mode, prepping their lines most of the day, she admits that the gang did have a good laugh at each episode\u2019s new script, joking that every time they were handed a new one to flip through, they thought, \u201cIs this the day we\u2019re getting out of here?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just kind of made fun of the plots.
