Walt, a Harvard scholar. He argues that the hard-to-swallow reality behind the withdrawal is that Syrian President Bashar Assad\u2019s brutal regime has won the civil war.\n\n\u201cThe dirty secret is that allowing Bashar Assad to regain all control over Syria is going to solve a number of vexing problems,\u201d Mr. Walt said. \u201cSaying that is a horrible thing because Assad is a war criminal and should be on trial for atrocities.\u201d\n\nThat Syrian Kurdish officials, who last week were allied with Washington, were so quickly willing to switch to cooperation with Mr. Assad proves their point, the realists say.\n\n\u201cWe live in a world that is not perfect,\u201d said Mr. Walt, adding that Damascus \u2014 for better or worse \u2014 is in the best position to tamp down, not exacerbate, tension with Syrian Kurds and Turkish forces who have invaded Kurdish-controlled areas in northeastern Syria.\n\nLibertarian-minded foreign policy analysts largely agreed.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s execution \u2026 was extraordinarily clumsy,\u201d said Ted Galen Carpenter, a senior fellow with the Cato Institute. \u201cHowever, his objective \u2014 reducing the risk exposure of those troops and taking the initial step toward ending Washington\u2019s Syria military mission \u2014 is not only appropriate, but overdue.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s critics offer nothing more than a compendium of policy cliches that would keep America mired in a murky, multisided conflict for decades,\u201d Mr. Carpenter told The Washington Times. \u201cWe already have a forever war in Afghanistan. The American people don\u2019t need another one in Syria.\u201d\n\nThese analysts say the U.S. \u2014 under any president \u2014 was never going to deliver the one thing sought by Kurdish allies in the region who did the bulk of the ground fighting to defeat the ISIS caliphate: an independent Kurdish state that could potentially claim major pieces of Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran.\n\nBoth the Obama and Trump administrations \u201cunderestimated the extent to which NATO ally Turkey would go to protect its own interests, how Russia and Iran would rally behind [Mr. Assad], and that the Assad regime\u2019s pernicious form of governance was the central driver of conflict in Syria \u2014 of which the Islamic State is a symptom,\u201d Melissa Dalton, who served on the congressionally mandated Syria Study Group and now directs the Cooperative Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote in an analysis Thursday.\n\nMs. Dalton acknowledged that the abrupt American withdrawal this week was \u201cmorally reprehensible and contrary to U.S. values.\u201d\n\n\u201cEnding the \u2018forever wars\u2019 in places like Syria has political resonance, but it must be done responsibly,\u201d she argued.\n\nPolitical appeal\n\nA big question now is whether U.S. lawmakers \u2014 other than outliers such as libertarian Sen. Rand Paul, Kentucky Republican \u2014 are ready to embrace such thinking. Indications so far are that the answer is no.\n\nBoth parties have lined up behind such foreign policy traditionalists as Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mitt Romney of Utah and Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nTheir message? The American pullout has allowed Turkey to commit atrocities against Syrian Kurds who helped defeat ISIS, opened the way for an expanded Iranian footprint near Israel and handed Russia immense new influence over the region.\n\nReflecting a broad consensus on Capitol Hill and among foreign policy analysts, Mr. Graham has called the Syria pullout \u201cthe most screwed-up decision\u201d in his 25 years in Congress. Mr. Romney said \u201cIran\u2019s power position has significantly increased with Turkey wiping out our friends the Kurds\u201d and that \u201cAssad is becoming stronger and Iran is smiling ear to ear.\u201d\n\nBut some still argue that the mainstream policy arguments miss the point. Unrealistic goals and promises that can\u2019t be kept make for bad policy, they say.\n\n\u201cAmerican foreign policy [there] has been an overreaching mess for a long time,\u201d said Damon Linker, a foreign policy columnist for The Week magazine.\n\n\u201cThe operation in Syria was a success, achieving its goal under President Trump. Yet now we\u2019re told that we need to maintain a military presence indefinitely to keep the [Islamic State] caliphate from returning. Or to protect the Kurds. Or to guard imprisoned ISIS fighters. Or to serve as a counterweight to Iran and Russia. Or to try and undermine the government of Assad. Or all of the above,\u201d Mr. Linker wrote in a column published Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe reason almost doesn\u2019t matter, as long as we never leave,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis is unacceptable. We can\u2019t allow Trump\u2019s moronic way of governing \u2026 to discredit the attempt to change course. Fashioning a saner and more sustainable foreign policy depends on it.\u201d\n\nOverstated fears\n\nMr. Walt argued that all the issues being raised by the foreign policy establishment would be resolved if Washington can accept the prospect of Assad government rule over Syria.\n\n\u201cOnce Damascus takes control over all of Syria, Turkey\u2019s fears about Kurdish autonomy will go down [and] ISIS will become Assad\u2019s problem,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd [Assad] is going to be ruthless in dealing with ISIS.\u201d\n\nFears that Russia or Iran will rush to fill the power vacuum caused by the U.S. pullout are also overstated, he said.\n\n\u201cThe more secure Assad becomes, the less he\u2019s going to need Russian or Iranian support,\u201d Mr. Walt said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he wants a large Russian or Iranian presence in his country on a permanent basis, so eventually Russian and Iranian influence will go down.\u201d\n\nThe Harvard scholar did criticize at length the sloppy rollout of Mr. Trump\u2019s withdrawal. He noted the Pentagon\u2019s acknowledgment that U.S. fighter jets had to bomb a weapons bunker this week at a former American base in Syria just before foreign forces arrived.\n\n\u201cWhen the U.S. Air Force is bombing our own ammunition supplies because we pulled out so quickly, that tells you this was not planned in any systematic or disciplined way,\u201d said Mr. Walt, who expressed distaste of Mr. Trump\u2019s attempts to tout the withdrawal as somehow consistent with his 2016 campaign promise to end American involvement in \u201cforever wars.\u201d\n\nThe roughly 1,000 U.S. troops were pulled out of Syria even as the Pentagon announced the deployment of some 3,000 troops and advanced missiles to Saudi Arabia last weekend.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s evidence that Trump is not, in fact, getting us out of the Middle East; he\u2019s moving things around,\u201d said Mr. Walt. \u201cIt\u2019s also an admission that the [maximum] pressure campaign against Iran is a complete failure, since all it has done is raise the risk of war in the Persian Gulf.\u201d\n\nMr. Carpenter agreed.\n\nThe president \u201cmust apply a realist foreign policy more consistently,\u201d the Cato analyst said. \u201cEven as he boasts about ending America\u2019s unwise entanglements in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East, he chooses to deepen the entanglement in Saudi Arabia by sending more troops.\n\n\u201cThat move fully deserves condemnation.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
