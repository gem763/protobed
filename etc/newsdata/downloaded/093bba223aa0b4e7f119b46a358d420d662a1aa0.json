(Matty Zimmerman/AP)\n\nOne of the most dramatic moments of the Cold War occurred Feb. 10, 1962, on a bridge connecting the then-divided states of East Germany and West Germany, when two high-profile prisoners \u2014 American pilot Francis Gary Powers and a convicted Soviet spy known as Rudolf Abel \u2014 were exchanged.\n\nDelegations from the United States and Soviet Union stepped onto the Glienicke Bridge, between West Berlin and Potsdam, East Germany, in a tense scene portrayed in the 2015 Steven Spielberg film, \u201cBridge of Spies.\u201d\n\nThe two groups stood on opposite sides of a white marker in the middle of the bridge for 20 minutes, waiting for word that another American had been released from an East German prison, almost 20 miles away.\n\nThat prisoner was Frederic L. Pryor, a 28-year-old graduate student who had been detained in East Berlin for nearly six months. Dr. Pryor, who was denounced as a spy by his captors but never charged with a crime, died Sept. 2 at his home in Newtown Square, Pa. He was 86.\n\nHis family announced his death with notices in newspapers in suburban Philadelphia and his hometown of Mansfield, Ohio. The cause of death was not specified.\n\nIn 1961, Dr. Pryor was completing his PhD dissertation in economics at Yale University. He had been in Berlin off and on for almost two years, conducting research on the trade policies of countries in the Communist bloc. He routinely drove his sports car into East Berlin to attend conferences and meet colleagues before being caught up in the hard political realities of the Cold War.\n\nOn Aug. 13, 1961, Communist authorities in East Germany barricaded their half of Berlin behind barbed wire and hastily built concrete walls \u2014 what instantly became known as the Berlin Wall. Less than two weeks later, on Aug. 25, Dr. Pryor drove to East Berlin on what he expected to be his farewell visit.\n\nHis plan that day was to listen to a speech by East German leader Walter Ulbricht; to deliver a copy of his dissertation to a professor who had helped with his research; and to meet the sister of a friend.\n\nThe friend\u2019s sister was not at home. (Only later did Dr. Pryor learn that she had fled to the west.) When he returned to his car, it was surrounded by officers from Stasi, the East German secret police.\n\n\u201cThe Stasi were staking out her apartment to catch anyone coming to get her stuff,\u201d Dr. Pryor told a publication of Swarthmore College, where he was a longtime faculty member. \u201cI didn\u2019t even get into the apartment, but they arrested me.\u201d\n\nWhen they found a copy of Dr. Pryor\u2019s dissertation \u2014 filled with statistics and other information about the Soviet bloc \u2014 they accused him of economic espionage. He was taken to a notorious prison, where he was questioned for up to 10 hours a day.\n\n\u201cThey interrogated me every day for four and a half months,\u201d he later said. \u201cGood practice for your German, by the way.\u201d\n\nDr. Pryor\u2019s parents moved to Berlin to help secure his release, but as the weeks turned to months he had almost no contact with them or anyone on the outside. The letters and packages his parents sent to him never arrived.\n\nThe East Germans furnished a lawyer for Dr. Pryor, but \u201conce you\u2019re arrested, you\u2019re always convicted,\u201d he told the Philadelphia Inquirer in 2015. \u201cI expected five or 10 years in prison. I made peace with that.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. government was seeking to negotiate the release of Powers, whose U-2 spy plane had been shot down over the Soviet Union in 1960. In exchange, the United States would turn over Abel \u2014 a British-born Soviet spy whose real name was William Fisher \u2014 who had been serving a prison sentence for espionage since 1957.\n\nWhen Abel was convicted, his court-appointed lawyer, James Donovan (played by Tom Hanks in \u201cBridge of Spies\u201d) argued that he not be given the death penalty.\n\n\u201cIt is possible that in the foreseeable future,\u201d Donovan said, \u201can American of equivalent rank will be captured by the Soviet Union or an ally. At such time, an exchange of prisoners could be considered to be in the best interest of the United States.\u201d\n\nU.S. intelligence officials enlisted Donovan to arrange the release of Powers in exchange for Abel. Dr. Pryor unwittingly found himself a part of high-stakes Cold War negotiations \u2014 in part because of the presence of his parents in Berlin.\n\nUnder pressure from the Soviets, East German authorities reluctantly agreed to release him as part of the Powers-Abel prisoner exchange.\n\n\u201cThe East Germans weren\u2019t happy about releasing me,\u201d Dr. Pryor told the Swarthmore publication. \u201cWhen my lawyer drove me to Checkpoint Charlie\u201d \u2014 the central crossing point between East and West Berlin \u2014 \u201cthey had us sit there for half an hour. The East Germans deliberately delayed the exchange of Powers and Abel, who were not supposed to be exchanged until after I was released.\u201d\n\nPowers, Abel and the two countries\u2019 diplomatic parties were forced to stand in the cold on Glienicke Bridge until U.S. officials learned that Dr. Pryor had been freed and was reunited with his family. The call came at 8:52 a.m. on Feb. 10, 1962.\n\nDr. Pryor flew back to the United States on a commercial flight and within 48 hours was in Ann Arbor, Mich., where his parents were living at the time.\n\n\u201cI did not know about the Powers-Abel switch until I crossed the border,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cI\u2019m a private citizen and I don\u2019t particularly enjoy the attention given me. I\u2019d like to resume a normal life.\u201d\n\nFrederic LeRoy Pryor was born April 23, 1933, in Owosso, Mich., and grew up in Mansfield, Ohio. His father was the wealthy owner of a manufacturing company, his mother a homemaker.\n\nDr. Pryor graduated in 1955 from Oberlin College in Ohio, where he majored in chemistry. He received a master\u2019s degree in economics from Yale in 1957, then spent a good deal of time in Europe studying for his doctorate. Yale conferred his PhD in 1962, shortly after his return from captivity in Berlin.\n\nWhen he applied for jobs with the auto industry, he was turned down.\n\n\u201cThey said, no, they didn\u2019t want anyone with a prison record,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI said, \u2018But it was the commies!\u2019 They said, \u2018Tough.\u2019 \u201d\n\nInstead, he turned to the academic world. He taught at the University of Michigan and worked in research at Yale before joining the faculty at Pennsylvania\u2019s Swarthmore College in 1967. He published more than a dozen books and more than 100 scholarly papers, examining the economics of Eastern Europe, agriculture, income inequality and other subjects. He retired in 1998 but kept an office at Swarthmore for many years afterward.\n\nAfter the fall of the Berlin Wall, Dr. Pryor returned to the former East Germany, where he had a warm reunion with the attorney assigned to his case.\n\nHis wife of 44 years, economist Zora Prochazka, died in 2008. Survivors include a son, Daniel Pryor, of Washington, and three grandchildren.\n\nPowers died in a helicopter crash in 1977; Abel died in the Soviet Union in 1971. Dr. Pryor seldom spoke about his Berlin experiences to his family or colleagues and said he was not consulted by Spielberg, the director of the \u201cBridge of Spies,\u201d before the film was released. He had to buy a ticket and see it a theater, like everyone else.\n\n\u201cAlmost everything the movie showed about me was fiction,\u201d he told Britain\u2019s Independent newspaper. He thought Will Rogers, the actor portraying him, looked \u201clike a delinquent.\u201d\n\nLeaving the theater, Dr. Pryor recalled to the Swarthmore publication, \u201canother person asked me what I thought of the film, and I said parts of it were inaccurate . . . He asked how I knew that, and I said \u2018I\u2019m Frederic Pryor.\u2019 \u201d", "description": "At the height of the Cold War, he was held in an East German prison, suspected of espionage.", "authors": ["Matt Schudel", "Obituary Writer", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/vASkbAabB-89aurs8ST6R1tFvO4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4GZNFFGU5YI6TBVMB4SQZSIXLA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
