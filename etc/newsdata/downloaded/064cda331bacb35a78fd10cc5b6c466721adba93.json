Traders had some time to digest Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s comments at the latest FOMC meeting on Wednesday afternoon, and deemed them not as hawkish as first interpreted. Let the September rally rage on, right? Nope.\n\nIn the afternoon, a Grim Reaper from out of nowhere took many bullish souls.\n\nThis Grim Reaper goes by the name of Michael Pillsbury, a well-known hardcore trade policy hawk and White House advisor. \u201cDoes the president have options to escalate the trade war? Yes, the tariffs can be raised higher. These are low-level tariffs that could go to 50%t or 100%,\u201d Pillsbury reportedly said at an event in Hong Kong, according to the South China Morning Post.\n\nA White House spokesperson didn\u2019t immediately return Yahoo Finance\u2019s request for comment on Pillsbury\u2019s statements. An email to Pillsbury was not immediately returned.\n\nMore China tariffs would be debilitating\n\nStocks quickly rolled over Thursday after the comments came to light, finishing near the lows of the session. As Sevens Report Research founder Tom Essaye wrote to clients, the algos that scan the internet for headlines took control after Pillsbury\u2019s comments. The machines were right to send team Trump a clear message that the last thing anyone needs are 50% to 100% tariffs on China\u2019s imports.\n\nIt would be truly debilitating to a U.S. economy already wading through a manufacturing recession, cooling capital investment by big companies and slowing job growth due to Trump\u2019s current tariffs.\n\n\u201cYeah I think it\u2019s possible at some point [those much higher tariffs), but I don\u2019t think it would happen before the 2020 election,\u201d Belpointe Asset Management Chief Strategist David Nelson said on Yahoo Finance\u2019s The First Trade. Nelson thinks markets and the economy would be severely hurt by tariffs at those levels. \u201cThere are consequences of a trade war, but it has become a populist message on both sides of the aisle. Both sides seem to be who is tougher in this.\u201d\n\nA computer screen shows images of Chinese President Xi Jinping, right, and U.S. President Donald Trump as a currency trader works at the foreign exchange dealing room of the KEB Hana Bank headquarters in Seoul, South Korea, Monday, Aug. 26, 2019.

We can capitulate, I am sure that\u2019s what China wants us to do. I don\u2019t think America is going to do that.\u201d\n\nThe outlook for tariffs could certainly be viewed upon as excessive.\n\nThe Trump administration will have hit $550 billion in Chinese goods with either 15% or 30% tariffs by the end of the year. That\u2019s based on expected tariff increases that kick in this October and December.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
