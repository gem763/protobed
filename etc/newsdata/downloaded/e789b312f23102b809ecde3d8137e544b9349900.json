REUTERS/Adnan Abidi/File Photo\n\nShares of the company, which also trimmed its full-year profit forecast, flitted between gains and losses. They were last up about 1.7%, after having risen about 13% to Tuesday\u2019s close.\n\n\u201cIn this environment, investors are nervous. Any room for uncertainty, people react first and ask questions later. Post call... I think people are comfortable with the growth algorithm here,\u201d said Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Kumar.\n\nA 63% jump in sales of FreeStyle Libre continuous glucose monitor powered the diabetes unit\u2019s better-than-expected revenue of $665 million. Two analysts polled by Refinitiv had expected $645 million.\n\nThe device helps diabetics track blood sugar levels without having to prick their fingers, and the company is awaiting the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval for the next-generation version of the device, the Freestyle Libre 2.0.\n\nHowever, a lack of updates on the approval also left investors skittish.\n\n\u201cAdmittedly, it\u2019s taking longer than we had expected. We obviously misjudged that,\u201d Chief Operating Officer Robert Ford said on a conference call with analysts, but did not provide a timeline for the approval.\n\nThe cardiovascular business, the company\u2019s biggest that houses the MitraClip, posted sales of $2.40 billion, below estimates of $2.44 billion, according to two analysts polled by Refinitiv.\n\nSales of MitraClip, seen as another growth driver, jumped 30% to $176 million. The device is used to repair leaky heart valves and the company has notched up approvals for new versions and additional indications.\n\nAbbott narrowed its 2019 adjusted earnings per share forecast to a range of $3.23 to $3.25, from a prior expectation of $3.21 to $3.27.\n\nNet earnings rose to $960 million, or 53 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, from $563 million, or 32 cents per share, a year earlier.\n\nExcluding items, the company earned 84 cents per share, matching analysts\u2019 average estimate.\n\nNet sales rose 5.5% to $8.08 billion, just shy of the average analyst estimate of $8.10 billion.", "description": "Abbott Laboratories fell just short of Wall Street estimates for quarterly revenue on Wednesday, as weakness in the medical device maker's cardiovascular business overshadowed strong performance in its fast-growing diabetes care unit.", "authors": ["Saumya Joseph", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441465394&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F10C", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
