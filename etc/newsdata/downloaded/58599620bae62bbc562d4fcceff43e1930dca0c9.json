The bill was withdrawn earlier this month, but the protests have since broadened into calls for universal suffrage.", "description": "Most of the eight newly licensed digital banks in Hong Kong, including joint ventures involving Standard Chartered and Bank of China Hong Kong, had aimed to begin operating before the end of 2019.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106038593-1564014001582gettyimages-1141623709.jpeg?v=1568695168", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
