Rather, you\u2019ll first enter your password, and then use the YubiKey to complete the login. This way, it\u2019s next to impossible for an attacker to access your system even if they know your password.\n\nIn order to go password-free, Windows users must leverage Hello \u2014 the biomteric facial recognition system built into the operating system that employs the same underlying technology as YubiKey to facilitate passwordless logins.\n\nThe ability to secure local accounts using YubiKeys was previously available only for Linux and Mac users. It\u2019s good to see this option become more widely available to PC fans.\n\nThe development also comes days after Google announced a USB-C variant of its Titan Security Key in partnership with Yubico that\u2019s compatible with Android, Chrome OS, macOS, and Windows devices.\n\nWith the need for securing identity gaining momentum in the wake of a string of data breaches, these authentication solutions can go a long way towards safeguarding accounts \u2014 online or otherwise \u2014 from unauthorized access.\n\nRead next: Moto's foldable Razr might launch next month", "description": "Swedish company Yubico has announced that its hardware security keys can now be used to login to a local Windows OS account.", "authors": ["Ravie Lakshmanan"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2Fyubikey-hed.jpg&signature=d9e3f89b48a6c1e5cee8459f47d256ce", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
