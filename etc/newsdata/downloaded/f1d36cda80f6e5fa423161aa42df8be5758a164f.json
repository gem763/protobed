Martin\n\nCalling bookworms of South Africa. Who says reading has to be confined to weekends and holidays?\n\nNews24 has created The Book Nook where you can come and relax with a cup of tea and explore your next read, learn about your favourite authors and share thoughts and ideas about the latest books on your nightstand.\n\nIf you've been inspired by your latest read, learnt something that others simply must know about or want to review a book you've read, please send us your article or review and become part of our community of book lovers. All reviews are welcome, including fiction and non-fiction.\n\nAlso look out for The Book Nook's pick of the month, and Q&A's with your favourite authors.\n\nYour book review or article should be between 300 and 600 words. Please include a standout quote from the book and as much information as possible, such as the name of the author, publisher, year of publication, etc. If all you have is the book title and author, that's also fine - this is a low pressure zone. Please include your name, surname, location and email it to voices@news24.com. While we unfortunately won't have time to respond to everyone, we will let you know if your article has been published.\n\nHappy reading!", "description": "If you've been inspired by your latest read, learnt something that others simply must know about or want to review a book you've read, please send us your article or review and become part of our community of book lovers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8855/cb3879dfc1d14e29be1ff7a8da7972be.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-12"}
