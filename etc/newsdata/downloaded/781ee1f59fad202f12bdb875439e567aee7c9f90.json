The best way to get Brexit sorted is to give the people the final say in a public vote.\u201d", "description": "UK PM announces \u2018great deal that takes back control\u2019 despite refusal of DUP to back agreement", "authors": ["Daniel Boffey", "Rowena Mason"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d281f6f4258385e27df544a0cf8de5be7a0e62c/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=db71450c4a8aa1d297c10aee69f32ad8", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
