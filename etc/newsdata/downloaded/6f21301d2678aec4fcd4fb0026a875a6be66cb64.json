REUTERS/Albert Gea\n\nThe banned referendum and the short-lived declaration of independence that followed plunged Spain into its biggest political crisis in decades. Madrid responded by imposing direct rule on the region for months, sidelining regional authorities.\n\n\u201cThe road towards the Catalan republic is inevitable,\u201d Pere Aragones, Catalonia\u2019s deputy head of government, said in a ceremony in Barcelona. \u201cWe want to build it peacefully and for everybody.\u201d\n\nYellow balloons marked voting stations used in the referendum, held on Oct 1, 2017 despite being deemed illegal by Madrid. \u201cLet\u2019s finish what we started,\u201d read one attached note.\n\nIn Girona, about 150 pro-independence protestors marched in streets, some hurling eggs at police and toppling garbage bins.\n\nState news agency Efe said the central government had sent extra riot police to Catalonia amid fears in Madrid of a repeat of last year, when protestors blocked highways and train tracks and about 180,000 people marched in Barcelona.\n\nThe separatist movement\u2019s momentum has seemingly slowed in recent months as it finds itself divided over whether to take a hard line that could lead to another banned independence referendum, or more dialogue with Madrid.\n\nBut tensions have flared in recent days ahead of the verdict, expected in the next two weeks, of 12 separatist leaders on trial for their role in the 2017 independence bid.\n\nSpain\u2019s high court last week also jailed seven Catalan separatists with possessing explosives, with prosecutors saying they were planning violent action around the time of the verdict. The regional parliament responded to the arrests by adopting a resolution backing civil disobedience.\n\nActing prime minister Pedro Sanchez said on Tuesday Madrid was ready to again apply direct rule in Catalonia if the regional government broke any laws.\n\nHe pointed to the refusal of separatist leaders to condemn the seven activists arrested last week. The leaders said Madrid was trying to paint separatists as a violent movement, a label they reject.\n\n\u201cWe urge the Catalan independence movement not to play with fire, not to make the worst possible mistake, which is to look the other way if there are signs of violence, as we have unfortunately seen in recent weeks,\u201d Sanchez said in an interview with broadcaster Cadena Ser.\n\nWORRIED ABOUT COMING DAYS\n\nLaura Borras, lawmaker for secessionist Junts per Catalunya, said in comments to Reuters that it was the Spanish government who had \u201cset fire to Catalan society\u201d with its actions.\n\nThe separatist movement has so far been peaceful but the seven activists arrested last week were to be linked to the grassroots CDR, on of the organisers of the Girona protest.\n\n\u201cWe were born to defend a referendum. We grew to defend a republic. We will be who will make the enemy tremble. And we will win. Have no doubts,\u201d the CDRs said on Twitter.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\nMass protests were scheduled to take place in Barcelona and elsewhere later on Tuesday.
