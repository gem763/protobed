The pilot got almost 1 million views in 24 hours.\n\n\"It's the first time people are hearing Brendan's story in his own words,\" Flom told Business Insider.\n\nDassey has intellectual disabilities and was in the public school special education system when he was interrogated for the sexual assault and murder of Halbach, which his legal team says he did not commit.\n\nThe NowThis series, \"Wrongful Conviction,\" includes video footage of Dassey's interrogation during which Laura Nirider, one of Dassey's lawyers, tells Flom that Dassey's interrogator is \"dropping him hints.\"\n\nNo one else was present during the interrogation, according to the docuseries and reports, and after Dassey admits to seeing his uncle shoot Halbach, the interrogator asks why he didn't say something sooner. Dassey says, \"'cause I couldn't think of it.\"\n\n\"The whole time he's guessing, and he had to be told the right answer because he couldn't guess right,\" Nirider said in the NowThis documentary.\n\nFlom said although Dassey is now 29, in many ways he is still childlike. At the end of each episode of his podcast, Flom gives his guests the opportunity to share anything they want. While many use the opportunity to make their case, Dassey talked about his love for Pok\u00e9mon.\n\n\"It gives insight into the fact that he's still a child,\" Flom said to Business Insider. \"He's not dumb, but he was 16 when this happened.\"\n\n'Wrongful Conviction' challenges NowThis' audience to take action\n\nFlom and the NowThis team hope the series will drive viewers to push for reform in the legal system, and said they've already seen results. Flom said he's heard positive feedback from sources even within the criminal legal system and that the number of people signing the petition to grant Dassey clemency has gone up.\n\nEven Kim Kardashian West took to Twitter to ask Evers to read a hand-written letter from one of Dassey's advocates.\n\nREAD MORE: With a new video division, Group Nine's NowThis is betting big on original shows across social, streaming, and OTT platforms\n\nTina Exarhos, the chief content officer at NowThis, said the NowThis audience has shown an interest in activism since the company launched in 2012.\n\n\"We're covering not just the news cycle every day, but the issues that matter most to young people,\" Exarhos said. \"Criminal and social justice is one of those key issues.\"\n\nFlom's focus on justice system reform made him a match for NowThis' progressive platform.\n\n\"The stories that he's brought to us and the individuals' lives that he's highlighted with the 'Wrongful Conviction' podcast so deeply resonate with our audience,\" Exarhos said.\n\nThe next \"Wrongful Conviction\" episode, which drops Oct. 9 on platforms including YouTube, Snapchat, Instagram, and Twitter, will feature Jimmy Dennis, Flom told Business Insider.\n\nDennis spent more than 25 years on death row in Pennsylvania and avoided two scheduled execution dates before being freed in 2017. He went on to start a music career, and Flom said Dennis is upbeat and optimistic despite his time in prison.\n\n\"He experienced deprivation and what can only be described as torture that would have broken anyone\u2026and he came out with an amazing attitude,\" Flom said. \"His case is unique and extraordinary and terrifying.
