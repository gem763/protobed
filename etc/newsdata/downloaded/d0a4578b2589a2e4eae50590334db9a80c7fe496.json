Consequently, the world\u2019s major economies came up with different approaches to try and stimulate tech innovation in their attempt to win the 21st century\u2019s space race: the tech race.\n\nOn one side, the US worked on maintaining its tech dominance by letting its Silicon Valley unicorns experiment without much supervision whatsoever, as long as the innovation flow was producing profitable products. The US was so loose with its regulations that startups like Theranos were allowed to put people\u2019s lives at risk under the innovation umbrella.\n\nOther major economies, desperate to catch up with the US, started betting heavily on tech via their own methods. China gave its full support to its own tech companies by preventing US tech giants from entering its ecosystem, and Russia focused on romanticizing the idea of a cyber-war to its youth. Europe, on the other hand, didn\u2019t give in to the \u201ctech comes first\u201d craze and instead embraced the role of the consumer.\n\nEurope\u2019s first attempt at tech\n\nWhen the EU first tried to turn its workforce into a tech-driven ecosystem, it did so with an approach that wasn\u2019t fitting for this day and age. Instead of letting investors pump money into the hands of young entrepreneurs, the EU tried to create a creative tech ecosystem via government initiatives and bureaucratic processes.\n\nCountries like France and Germany tried to push young graduates into launching their own tech startups with the help of government agencies and universities. But unsurprisingly, these attempts didn\u2019t result in the creation of the new Google or Amazon, as their counterparts in the US were launching fully-operating companies on a daily basis in a not-as-regulated environment and with double the money.\n\nThese factors made the few successful European startups, like Docker, opt to flee the continent and head into Silicon Valley, where they\u2019d have a much bigger chance to prosper, and where tech companies were untouchable.\n\nEurope was rapidly getting disconnected from the tech world, and its companies were losing in a technological race they weren\u2019t remotely ready for.\n\nAnd then, all that started to change.\n\nGDPR, Europe\u2019s regulation of innovation\n\nEurope, being the world\u2019s biggest tech consumer, was the first set of nations to recognize the importance of having an elaborate legal framework for the digital age. While the US was suffering the consequences of the Cambridge Analytica scandal and its effects on its 2016 presidential election, Europe was rapidly moving towards a ground-breaking data privacy regulation: GDPR \u2014 General Data Protection Regulation.\n\nThe regulation, which was at first dreaded and feared by European companies, became the unlikely disruptor that pushed Europe\u2019s corporations into tech innovation.\n\nGDPR brought a long list of fundamental changes to the way companies handled data, restricting their access to users\u2019 data to the bare minimum. Among its key changes, GDPR forces companies to delete all the data of every individual that hasn\u2019t interacted with them (digitally or otherwise) for three consecutive years.\n\nThis change meant that European companies were headed towards losing a big chunk of their data unless they manage to reactivate the individuals potentially concerned by this law. Insert tech innovation.\n\nThe post-GDPR European tech renaissance\n\nThe extent of GDPR\u2019s changes has put companies on a race against time to revamp their tech infrastructures and use the data that is still at their disposal in every way possible to not lose it. Innovation is now a necessity to survive, and no longer just an excuse to organize meetups.\n\nWith GDPR, the EU has driven its companies into a corner. But by doing so, it unintentionally paved the way for them to revamp their aging tech infrastructure and adopt newer technologies. Startups like Boxever and Knime thrived on this opportunity by offering SaaS platforms for companies allowing them to fully take advantage of the data at their disposal, turning \u2018restrictions\u2019 into innovation.\n\nInnovation is now back in Europe as the continent\u2019s giants have embraced big data and AI technologies and are rapidly pushing the limits of these worlds. Relying on the cloud infrastructure, European companies have managed to rapidly integrate the data-driven era at full speed and become contributors, not merely tech consumers, with four IPOs of European tech companies reaching valuations of more than $5 billion in 2018.\n\nIn a matter of years, European tech has gone from being a dysfunctional set of non-innovative companies to a network of hubs full of startups offering cutting-edge technologies.\n\nAnother figure that showcases the importance of Europe\u2019s tech boom is the fact that its tech industry is growing five times faster than the rest of the European economy, meaning that in this heavily-regulated environment, European tech is flourishing instead of stagnating.\n\nEurope\u2019s biggest cities are also turning into major startup hubs following this European tech renaissance, and the opening of Station F \u2014 the world\u2019s biggest startup campus \u2014 in Paris less than two years ago is just one example of how Europe\u2019s megacities are turning into innovation hubs.\n\nGDPR may not be the only factor in Europe\u2019s complex relationship with tech, but like other regulations that revolutionized sectors (another recent example can be the effect of the FRTB regulation on the financial sector), it definitely pushed the equation in new directions.", "description": "GDPR was at first dreaded and feared by European companies, but has become the unlikely disruptor that pushed Europe\u2019s corporations into tech innovation.", "authors": ["Mahdi Karabiben", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/podium?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F09%2FUntitled-design112.png&signature=b8f771b03597a0d92bf44868a40bc0ce", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
