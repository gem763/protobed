Last year I came here with some anxiety about my boxing ability.\n\n\"I believed in my fitness and athleticism and how hard I worked but I did not feel like a boxer, I felt like a YouTuber who was pretending.\n\n\"Now my boxing will speak for itself, the confidence has risen.\n\n\"I am confused by the people who think he wins. I understand his fans wanting him to win but what the f*** are they thinking? I will end this man.\n\n\"Last year I f***** around and showboated but this time it will just be a knockout.\"", "description": "KSI\u00a0and\u00a0Logan Paul\u00a0met\u00a0in London today for the second\u00a0press conference of their promotional tour for their upcoming rematch.", "authors": ["Adam Hamdani"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/07/18/KSI-Logan-Paul.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
