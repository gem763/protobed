She is said to be the legal owner of the truck.\n\n\n\nA 48-year-old man from Northern Ireland is also being held.\n\n\n\nOn Saturday, Irish police announced another arrest at Dublin port, of a man in his early 20s from Northern Ireland.\n\nMeanwhile on Saturday, Vietnam's Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said he ordered his country's authorities to establish whether Vietnamese citizens are among the dead.\n\nPhuc also ordered the police to launch an investigation into alleged human-trafficking activities.
