You\u2019ve probably heard the term 5G technology. It is the latest, or \u201cfifth generation,\u201d of cellular wireless technology just starting to be rolled out, notes industry-leading income specialist Tom Hutchinson, editor of Cabot Dividend Investor.\n\nBut it\u2019s much more than just an incremental generational cell phone advancement. It will thrust the world into a new age. And three 5G technology REITs intend to capitalize. More on those in a bit.\n\nA new generation rolls around every 10 years or so, from the first one that enabled cell phones in the first place to the third and fourth generations that enabled smartphones and mobile data.\n\nMore from Tom Hutchinson: Alexandria Real Estate Bets on Innovation Clusters\n\nEach generation marks an improvement in speed and latency, the amount of time it takes devices to communicate with each other. This generation is projected to feature internet connectivity with far superior speed, scope and scale.\n\nThe implications go well beyond phones. It is a crucial tipping point of critical mass: 5G enables virtually instantaneous internet connectivity, providing the technology for a new range of advancements like self-driving cars, robotics, artificial intelligence, smart cities and much more.\n\nUntil now, the digital age was like a dirt road. It\u2019s now about to become a 10-lane highway with speed rails and air traffic. You ain\u2019t seen nothin\u2019 yet!\n\nHow important is it? It is such a game changer that it is considered a national security imperative. It is a big part of the current trade war with China and the struggle for dominance and power.\n\nThe U.S. National Security Council has warned that if China gets 5G first it \u201cwill win economically and militarily.\u201d In fact, 5G technology is considered so crucial that the FCC streamlined the rules so that the 5G rollout can continue in haste.\n\n5G is infrastructure. Every new generation requires more and better cell towers and supporting structures. This new generation requires even more because, although it provides great speeds and power, it doesn\u2019t have the cell signal range of previous generations. Therefore, it requires more towers and supporting technologies to increase the range and relieve congestion.\n\nAside from the major cell phone providers, there are three big players in 5G technology, and they\u2019re all REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts).\n\nIt\u2019s a business that provides both growth, with the 5G rollout, and defense, as the rollout will continue rain or shine, in a good economy or a bad one. Right now, these three 5G technology REITs are an incredible opportunity for income investors.\n\nAmerican Tower Corp. (AMT)\n\nAmerican Tower is the largest U.S. cellular infrastructure REIT. It owns and operates 170,000 cell towers, 41,000 in the U.S. and 130,000 abroad, primarily in India and Brazil. And it\u2019s growing. It added 20,000 cell towers in 2018. It leases these towers to cellular service providers under long-term contracts, acting as a mobile technology landlord.\n\nBusiness is good. The stock has blown away both the returns of the overall market as well as its REIT peers. AMT has provided a better than 21% average annual return over the past 10 years. It is benefitting in the U.S. from the voracious anticipation for the 5G rollout as well as in emerging markets, as low-cost smartphones proliferate at a torrid pace.\n\nLately, the returns are accelerating. The stock has gained 49% over the past year and 40% year to date. Revenues and earnings continue to grow with no end in sight and this market has noticed.\n\nSee also: Keep Verizon on your Radar\n\nThe biggest drawback is that AMT isn\u2019t cheap and it only pays a 1.55% yield. That said, it is forecasted to grow earnings at a better than 21% annual clip over the next five years. That\u2019s serious growth for a REIT.\n\nIt is also worth noting the defensive nature of this growth business. Even during the financial crisis year of 2008, AMT still grew revenues at 8%.\n\nSBA Communications Corp. (SBA)\n\nSBA is the smallest of the cellular infrastructure REITs with about 30,000 cell towers in North, Central and South America. It has a huge presence in Brazil but generates about three quarters of revenue in the good ole USA.\n\nIt has essentially the same business model as AMT in that it leases space on its towers to cellular service providers under long-term contracts. The key differentiating point is size, which is both a blessing and a curse.\n\nStory continues", "description": "There is a revolution going on. You've probably heard the term 5G technology.
