Laura Trujillo wrote a brave and painful remembrance of her mother's suicide, as well as her own rape, and USA cushioned the story with those of others, and offered meaningful ways to deal with the issue. Beautifully done,\u201d said the judges.\n\nFirst place in the category of health writing was won by Alison Young and Laura Ungar for USA TODAY\u2019s \u201cDeadly Deliveries\u201d investigation, which has led to new standards proposed by the nation's largest hospital accreditation group. \u201cThe United States is the most dangerous place in the developed world to deliver a baby. It's hard to get your head around that. USA Today took a deeper dive at why this is the case. The writing is compelling, the examples and numbers strong, and the need for continued change and oversight obvious,\u201d said the judges.\n\nJohn Fauber, Matt Wynn and Kristina Fiore of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel earned second place in that category for their \u201cBad Medicine\u201d reporting on how doctors who lose their licenses in one state can still practice in other states.\n\nRochelle Riley of The Detroit Free Press won first place in the category for local columns category. Her winning work included her column calling for former Michigan State President Lou Anna Simon to resign in the wake of the Larry Nassar scandal, her piece on the Aretha Franklin funeral, and her profile of a Detroit high school girl who overcame a troubled childhood to succeed and win a local science fair. The judges stated, \u201c\u2018She brought joy to heartbreak \u2014 and joy won.\u2019 That's how Rochelle Riley described Aretha Franklin in covering the singer's funeral. And Riley used an uncommonly strong writing voice to call on Michigan State President Lou Anna Simon to resign after the Larry Nassar scandal. And Riley's touching piece on a Detroit student's rise from a chaotic upbringing to academic achievement was outstanding. Great work, Rochelle; we loved it.\u201d\n\nRick Barrett of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel came in first place for business news coverage for his reporting on the crisis facing Wisconsin dairy farmers. \u201cHundreds of Wisconsin dairy farms are going under as a glut of milk on the market collapses prices and profits. Rick Barrett's in-depth and insightful reporting puts human face on a crisis that is punching Wisconsin farmers in the gut,\u201d said the judges.\n\nDetroit Free Press reporters Eric D. Lawrence and Kristi Tanner and USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey came in second for business news coverage for their \u201cDeath on Foot\u201d reporting on why pedestrian deaths are up 46% in the past decade.\n\nJames E. Causey of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel won second for news series in newspapers not in top 20 media market for his \"Cultivating a Community\" special report, which looked at how fruits and vegetables become powerful weapons for saving young boys in Milwaukee's poorest ZIP code.\n\nSecond place for best political coverage second place went to the Tennessean staff for its \u201cMayor Barry Scandal\u201d reporting on the events leading up to Mayor Megan Barry\u2019s resignation.\n\nThe Desert Sun\u2019s Ian James won third for environmental writing for his work on the \u201cPoisoned Cities, Deadly Border\u201d investigation of pollution on the border and its effects on people's health.\n\nAndrew Ford took third for best online video 3-10 minutes for his coverage for Asbury Park Press of a man who was beaten by police.\n\nCoverage of the devastating Carr Fire earned Redding Record Searchlight third place for spot news in daily newspapers of all sizes.\n\n\u201cWe are so proud of our journalists whose work was honored at the National Headliner Awards for tackling a variety of important issues and making an impact in communities across the country,\u201d said Nicole Carroll, editor in chief, USA TODAY.\n\nThe Press Club of Atlantic City, which founded the National Headliners Awards in 1934, announced the 2019 Print, Photography and Online winners for the 85th annual content on Monday.
