Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).\n\nAnd once again, voters were subjected to a virtually pointless trading of talking points that shed no new light on how the candidates diagnose the flaws of the U.S. health care system or how they propose to cure them. Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) support Medicare for All. Former Vice President Joe Biden (D), Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) and the other candidates don\u2019t.\n\nIf you\u2019re a Democratic voter, the only reason this would be news to you is if you awoke from a coma immediately before the start of Tuesday\u2019s debate.\n\nFocusing a conversation about America\u2019s deeply messed up, unaffordable and unfair health care system with a \u201cgotcha\u201d question about whether fixing it would require tax increases serves no one other than moderators looking to frame progressive proposals entirely around their costs.\n\nThe aim here is not to illuminate the trade-offs inherent in any health care reform proposal. It\u2019s to create a clip of a leading candidate \u2015 in this case, Warren \u2015 talking about tax increases based on the assumption that tax increases are inherently bad, in the view of the people asking the question.\n\nSanders has spoken plainly about the need for new taxes to finance his Medicare for All plan. \u201cAt the end of the day, the overwhelming majority of people will save money on their health care bills,\u201d Sanders said Tuesday. \u201cBut I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up.\u201d\n\nWarren avoids the word \u201ctax,\u201d but it doesn\u2019t take a genius to understand that she is saying the same thing.\n\n\u201cCosts will go up for the wealthy, they will go up for big corporations, and for middle-class families, they will go down,\u201d Warren said. \u201cI will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families.\u201d\n\nIn other words, new taxes would target those who have lots of money and, to the extent that middle-class people see new taxes to finance Medicare for All, those will be lower than what such families pay today for health care. Sanders and Warren describe this the same way, except for the \u201ct\u201d word.\n\nVoters are getting pretty sick of this argument, according to survey results the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation published Tuesday. Last week, 48% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents reported they thought the candidates were talking too much about Medicare for All. Fifty-one percent thought there was too much discussion of health coverage programs, and 45% thought there was too much talk about the Affordable Care Act.\n\nA majority of these voters told pollsters they wanted to hear more about subjects like the cost of prescription drugs and dealing with surprise medical bills.\n\nThe organizers of the Ohio debate must not have seen that survey.\n\nOf course, creating a federal program that provides health coverage with no premiums, no deductibles and no out-of-pocket costs at the point of service would require tax increases. Health care that\u2019s free when you receive it isn\u2019t actually free. Taxpayers just pay for it in advance.\n\nCentralizing the health coverage system would surely enable more aggressive cost-containment than is possible under the fragmented coverage system America has today. If the federal government were the sole purchaser of health care services and products, the federal government would have unparalleled power to push down the prices for those services and products. Eliminating private insurance also would do away with the money insurance companies spend on administrative costs and enriching their executives and shareholders.\n\nYet no serious person can claim the government wouldn\u2019t need to raise money to finance a single-payer system.", "description": "Everyone already knows where the candidates stand on \"Medicare for All.\" Maybe there's something else to talk about?", "authors": ["Jeffrey Young"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/RTdYAbix6SKzpAKX7dWwUw--~B/aD0yMDAwO3c9MzAwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da677382100003c0fad2681.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
