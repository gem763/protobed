Every time she made it to the game\u2019s biggest stage, she was hindered by injuries.\n\nThis time around it was three herniated disks in her back. The league\u2019s MVP wouldn\u2019t let that keep her from her first WNBA championship.\n\nEmma Meesseman scored 22 points and Delle Donne added 21 to help the Washington Mystics beat the Connecticut Sun 89-78 on Thursday night in the winner-take-all Game 5 of the Finals.\n\n\u201cEvery time I get the Finals, something happens,\u201d Delle Donne said. \u201cI think I pissed the basketball gods off when I decided to step away (in college). I hope this ends the drama that I\u2019m having in the Finals.\u201d\n\nIt was the first title in franchise history.\n\n\u201cIt feels phenomenal, my goodness, feels so good. Hard to put it into words,\u201d said Delle Donne, who fell short in two previous Finals appearances. \u201cTo win it with such a great group of people. We wanted to win it for the person next to us. We\u2019ll remember this season. I\u2019m kind of sad the season\u2019s about to be over. My goodness, we sure ended this on a high note.\u201d\n\nIt was a fitting conclusion to an entertaining series and WNBA season. This was the seventh series in league history that had gone to a deciding Game 5, and the home team has won five of them.\n\nDelle Donne scored four points during a decisive 8-0 run that gave the Mystics an 80-72 lead with under three minutes left. But it was Meesseman, the soft-spoken Belgian who unveiled a new, aggressive \u201cPlayoff Emma\u201d persona during the title run, who was named MVP of the Finals.\n\nMeesseman missed last season while playing with the Belgian national team.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m the missing piece. I\u2019m their teammate (and did what) I need to do help my team win a championship. This is my family right here,\u201d she said.\n\nDelle Donne, a seven-year veteran and two-time MVP, came to Washington three years ago in a trade from Chicago, hoping to get the Mystics their first title. She grew up about an hour from the city in Delaware and wanted to be closer to home.\n\nDelle Donne sat out a year in college when she transferred in the summer before her freshman season from UConn to Delaware to be closer to her sister Lizzie, who is blind, deaf and has cerebral palsy.\n\n\u201cLizzie has been my journey, and some people have never understood my decisions. Others have. But she\u2019s been my path, and somehow she\u2019s gotten me to this moment,\u201d Delle Donne said. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s been a crazy journey. It\u2019s been my own path. It\u2019s been different from everyone else\u2019s. I\u2019ve just kind of believed in it, and you\u2019ve got to follow your heart, and I\u2019ve always trusted in her. Another reason I can battle through injury is like she\u2019s been dealt the worst cards possible with her disabilities, and every day she gets up, she smiles, she laughs, she loves. So she\u2019s always just been my inspiration.\u201d\n\nDelle Donne has battled injuries and illnesses all season, breaking her nose early in the year. She still wears a mask to protect it. She also wears a knee brace on her right knee after suffering a bone bruise in last year\u2019s Finals.\n\nCoach Mike Thibault earned his first WNBA championship. The league\u2019s all-time winningest coach had reached the Finals three times in his career \u2014 twice with Connecticut \u2014 and last season with Washington, but fell short each time.\n\nThe game got off to a slow start with choppy play, but it picked up during a back-and-forth second half.\n\nThe Mystics trailed by nine midway through the third quarter before rallying within two at the end of the period. The teams traded the lead in the final period until Delle Donne hit a tough fadeaway midway through the quarter. After a Connecticut miss, Kristi Toliver \u2014 the only player on either team who had won a title before \u2014 drove down the lane and hit a beautiful finger-roll layup to give the Mystics a 76-72 lead.\n\nDelle Donne added another basket, and Meesseman capped the run with a jumper.\n\n\u201cEmma went to work inside. Elena does what she does. You have to beat them by defending them. All the players stepped up in the fourth quarter when we needed it,\u201d Thibault said.\n\nConnecticut could only get within six points the rest of the way.\n\n\u201cThey were just better down the stretch,\u201d Sun coach Curt Miller said. \u201cDefensively, it wasn\u2019t anything more than they were really physical. They were the physical team down the stretch when they needed it.\u201d\n\nDelle Donne got the final rebound and hugged her teammates at center court as the final buzzer sounded.\n\nJonquel Jones had 25 points for the Sun and Alyssa Thomas added 21 points and 12 rebounds.\n\nDelle Donne said the team was aware that the only thing missing from its coach\u2019s resume was the championship and was thrilled to help give him his first.\n\nThe two shared a long embrace at center court as confetti rained down after the game.\n\n\u201cI said I was very happy that I am one of the players and this team was able to bring him something that he hasn\u2019t done yet,\u201d Delle Donne said of their postgame celebration.\n\nMeesseman got rolling when the Mystics desperately needed her, with Connecticut leading by nine. She scored 11 points in the third period on array of post moves and outside shots to get the Mystics within 64-62 heading into the final quarter.\n\nMeesseman said her motivation was simple.\n\n\u201c\u201dThe trophy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a championship game. That\u2019s all I need. I\u2019m just playing basketball. Today I just shot my shot.\u201d\n\nALL RISE\n\nSupreme Court Justice Elena Kagan was in the crowd. Thibault met her once on a flight and the two struck became friendly. The Mystics visited the Supreme Court in June.\n\n3-POINT STRUGGLES\n\nAfter being the best 3-point shooting team during the season, the Mystics couldn\u2019t hit many shots from behind the arc on Thursday night. They were 4-for-19.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nGame 5 held to form with the other four as the team that led after the first quarter went on to win. Washington led 23-20 after one period and Connecticut led by one at the half. \u2026 Mystics assistant coach Eric Thibault, Mike\u2019s son, is getting married next weekend. \u2026 Connecticut lost in the Finals for the third time. They did it under Mike Thibault in 2004 and \u201905.\n\n___\n\nFollow Doug Feinberg on Twitter at https://twitter.com/DougFeinberg\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-Sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Elena Delle Donne felt cursed.
