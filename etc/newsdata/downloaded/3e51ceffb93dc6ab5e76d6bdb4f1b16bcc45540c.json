But following both the 2017 collapse of Monarch and the 2019 failure of Thomas Cook, the government took the decision of repatriating all affected passengers regardless of their Atol status.\n\nDIY holidaymakers who were flown home on a repatriation flight can claim for their original departure under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. The law makes card providers jointly liable with the supplier for the provision of the service \u2013 in this case a one-way flight to the UK.\n\nThe act applies to purchases of \u00a3100 or more. While some solo travellers will have paid less than this, and will not be able to claim, a couple who paid \u00a350 each in a single transaction would be able to seek a refund.\n\nTo claim the cost of their original flight back, seat-only passengers need only demonstrate that their flight was grounded \u2013 a trivial matter since Thomas Cook Airlines\u2019 UK operations ceased on 23 September. The fact that they were flown home at or close to the planned time is irrelevant.\n\nFor some one-way transatlantic flights, passengers could make several hundred pounds.\n\nIt is possible that passengers who paid with a debit card, or whose flight cost less than \u00a3100, would be able to claim under the banks\u2019 voluntary \u201cchargeback\u201d scheme.\n\nA package holidaymaker with Atol protection cannot claim for the cancelled flight because they bought a package that was provided in line with the original promise.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to The Independent during a repatriation flight on Tuesday, the Civil Aviation Authority chair, Dame Deirdre Hutton, explained the \u201copen to all\u201d policy like this: \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of practicality. How could we expect people in small airports around the world to distinguish between Atol and non-Atol passengers?\u201d\n\nDerek Moore, chair of the Association of Independent Tour Operators, said: \u201cThis is yet another unintended consequence of the Thomas Cook collapse.\n\n\u201cIt is an own goal for the government that non-Atol protected consumers have been flown home at taxpayers\u2019 expense.\n\n\u201cWhy should any tour operator pay thousands of pounds in hard cash for an Atol \u2013 not to mention leaping through a huge range of time-consuming and costly hoops \u2013 when non-Atol companies\u2019 clients were repatriated at no cost to consumer or company?\n\n\u201cThere is a simply massive hole in our current lousy legislation, and no one in government has yet had the guts to tackle it.\u201d\n\nOperation Matterhorn will finish on Sunday 6 October, by which time almost all the Thomas Cook passengers who were abroad at the time of the collapse will be back in the UK.", "description": "Thousands of travellers flown back to the UK at the taxpayer\u2019s expense stand to make a profit from the collapse of Thomas Cook \u2013 so long as they avoided Atol protection.
