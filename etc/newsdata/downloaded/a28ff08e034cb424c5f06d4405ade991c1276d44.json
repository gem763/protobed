It ended in a truce but sporadic violence has flared in the years since - including after Renamo challenged election results in 2014.\n\nThe problem for Renamo in places such as Beira, the capital of Sofala province, is that Frelimo, as well as the smaller Mozambique Democratic Movement (MDM), are muscling in on its traditional turf.\n\nNyusi\u2019s credibility has been knocked by the insurgency and a graft scandal that sank the economy, but Frelimo holds numerous districts in Sofala following local elections last year, and dozens of people told Reuters the ruling party had their vote.\n\nFrelimo spokesman Caifadine Manasse said it had consolidated the rule of law and tackled graft.\n\nChatham House\u2019s Vines said if Renamo wins three or four of Mozambique\u2019s 10 provinces in next week\u2019s vote, that should be sufficient to placate its supporters.\n\nBut any fewer and a recent bout of party infighting over the peace deal could worsen. Renamo\u2019s leadership could lose control of sections of the party, threatening commitment to the agreement or even a return to targeted violence, he said.\n\nBreakaway Renamo fighters dissatisfied with the pact have already staged attacks. They want elections postponed and for Renamo\u2019s new leader, Ossufo Momade, to resign.\n\nGovernors run local services and have a degree of power over spending, state-owned land and council jobs. Though some critics say a new position - the government-appointed provincial secretary of state - will still hold most of the power.\n\nSHIFTING ALLEGIANCES\n\nRenamo spokeswoman Maria Ivone Soares said the party was convinced it would win in Sofala and other provinces.\n\n\u201cThe results are unlikely to be disappointing because of the ... corruption, unemployment, inequality and misery that have been promoted in this country since national independence.\u201d\n\nRenamo supporters want the party to upend a perceived system of patronage whereby \u201ccomrades\u201d - Frelimo members and their families - are first in line for jobs in local government as well as state-run projects and companies.\n\n\u201cIf I had influence my son would be working now,\u201d said Joaquim, 42, sitting with friends on a log at a camp for cyclone victims in Guara Guara, 45 km (30 miles) west of Beira.\n\n\u201cMany young men are growing old without employment ... They will not go anywhere,\u201d he said, asking for his second name not to be published for fear of retribution.\n\nHis family, including eight children, lost everything when Cyclone Idai slammed into the province in March. They live with 11 other families in a tent and with no tools to farm or fish, spend their days sitting around in the dusty camp.\n\nYet even among Renamo supporters, there is a dislike of Momade, who has struggled to fill the shoes of charismatic former leader Afonso Dhlakama since his death last year.\n\nJoaquim\u2019s friend Jose said this wouldn\u2019t necessarily stop him voting Renamo but he was considering the MDM, a group that has benefited from waning support for the two main parties.\n\nIt sucked votes from Renamo in a 2009 general election and Frelimo in local elections in 2013, and is popular in Beira - which is significant for the overall outcome in Sofala.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an open gate for MDM,\u201d leader Daviz Simango told Reuters, speculating that Renamo would be relegated to third in the province. \u201cAnd it won\u2019t only happen in Sofala.\u201d", "description": "The face of President Filipe Nyusi beams from flags billowing across Mozambique's city of Beira, where T-shirts and posters colour the streets with his Frelimo party's signature red in what is usually an opposition stronghold.", "authors": ["Emma Rumney", "Manuel Mucari", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440670831&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D0QT-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
