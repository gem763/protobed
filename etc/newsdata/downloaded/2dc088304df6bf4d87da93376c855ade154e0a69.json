We have good weather \u2013 sometimes at least \u2013 good education and good healthcare.\u201d\n\nA national culture that supports spending time alone as well as with friends is also something he values, alongside Finland\u2019s ample nature and low unemployment levels. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of jobs...if one is ready to apply and search for a job, then I think everyone can get a job,\u201d he argues.\n\nIt is these kind of markers \u2013 alongside high levels of trust and security and low rates of inequality \u2013 that explain Finland\u2019s sometimes controversial top position in global happiness rankings.\n\nThe small, northerly nation, with a population of just 5.5 million people, has historically been stereotyped as having a melancholic mentality linked to its long, dark winters \u2013 it isn\u2019t a place where you regularly see outpourings of joy or other positive emotions. Yet, like its Scandinavian neighbours, Finland ticks the bulk of the boxes that typically influence subjective well-being around the world.", "description": "Finland regularly tops global rankings as the happiest nation on the planet, but this brings a unique set of challenges for young people struggling with depression.", "authors": ["Maddy Savage"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/7p/6c/p07p6cv7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
