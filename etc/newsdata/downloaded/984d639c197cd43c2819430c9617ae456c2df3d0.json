The person requested anonymity to discuss the confidential interview.\n\nThe interview is one of what could eventually become dozens of closed-door depositions in the impeachment probe. There are five more scheduled this week, mostly with State Department officials, though it is unclear if they will all appear after Trump declared he wouldn\u2019t cooperate with the probe.\n\nWhile interviews have focused on the interactions with Ukraine, the probe could broaden as soon as next week to include interviews with White House budget officials who may be able to shed light on whether military aid was withheld from Ukraine as Trump and his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, pushed for the investigations.\n\nThe three committees leading the probe are seeking interviews next week with Russell Vought, acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, and Michael Duffey, another OMB official who leads national security programs, according to a person familiar with those requests. That person wasn\u2019t authorized to discuss the invitations and requested anonymity.\n\nThe packed schedule of interviews comes as Democrats are methodically working to pin down the details of Trump\u2019s pressure on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Once Democrats have completed the probe, and followed any other threads it produces, they will use their findings to help determine whether to vote on articles of impeachment. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she wants the committees to move \u201cexpeditiously.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have already obtained documents and testimony that verify parts of an original whistleblower\u2019s complaint that launched the probe. A cache of text messages between three diplomats provided by one of the inquiry\u2019s first witnesses, former Ukrainian envoy Kurt Volker, detailed attempts by the diplomats to serve as intermediaries around the time Trump urged Zelenskiy to start the investigations into a company linked to Biden\u2019s son. Yovanovitch told lawmakers there was a \u201cconcerted campaign\u201d against her based on \u201cunfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives.\u201d\n\nOne of the diplomats in the text exchanges, U.S. ambassador Gordon Sondland, is expected to appear for a deposition under subpoena Thursday. He\u2019s expected to tell Congress that his text message reassuring another envoy that there was no quid pro quo in their interactions with Ukraine was based solely on what Trump told him, according to a person familiar with his coming testimony.\n\nAlso up this week: Michael McKinley, a former top aide to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who resigned last week. McKinley, a career foreign service officer and Pompeo\u2019s de facto chief of staff, resigned Friday, ending a 37-year career. He is scheduled to testify behind closed doors Wednesday.\n\nThe committees are also scheduled to talk to Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent on Tuesday and Ulrich Brechbuhl, a State Department counselor, on Thursday. On Friday, the lawmakers have scheduled an interview with Laura Cooper, who is the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia. It is unclear if any of those officials will show up after Trump\u2019s vow of non-cooperation.\n\nBecause of the Trump administration\u2019s edict, the Democrats have been subpoenaing witnesses as they arrived for their interviews \u2014 a move sometimes known as a \u201cfriendly\u201d subpoena that could give the witnesses additional legal protection as they testify. Both Yovanovitch and Hill received subpoenas the mornings of their testimony.\n\nOne witness who may not be called before Congress is the still-anonymous government whistleblower who touched off the impeachment inquiry.\n\nTop Democrats say testimony and evidence coming in from other witnesses, and even the Republican president himself, are backing up the whistleblower\u2019s account of what transpired during Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Zelenskiy. Lawmakers have grown deeply concerned about protecting the person from Trump\u2019s threats and may not wish to risk exposing the whistleblower\u2019s identity.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said Sunday it \u201cmay not be necessary\u201d to reveal the whistleblower\u2019s identity as the House gathers evidence. He said Democrats \u201cdon\u2019t need the whistleblower, who wasn\u2019t on the call, to tell us what took place on the call.\u201d\n\nSchiff said the \u201cprimary interest right now is making sure that that person is protected.\u201d\n\nTrump showed no signs of backing down.\n\n\u201cAdam Schiff now doesn\u2019t seem to want the Whistleblower to testify. NO!\u201d the Republican president tweeted Monday. \u201cWe must determine the Whistleblower\u2019s identity to determine WHY this was done to the USA.\u201d\n\nRepublican lawmakers have aimed their ire at Democrats and the process, saying Pelosi should hold a vote to begin the inquiry and hold the meetings out in the open, not behind closed doors.\n\n\u201cThe tragedy here and the crime here is that the American people don\u2019t get to see what\u2019s going on in these sessions,\u201d said Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, the top Republican on the House Oversight and Reform panel.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Eric Tucker and Lisa Mascaro contributed to this report.", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Fiona Hill, a former White House adviser on Russia, told House impeachment investigators behind closed doors Monday that she had", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/14/38d077_trump-impeachment-37768-fiona-hill-white-house-on-russia-fiona-hill-leaves-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
