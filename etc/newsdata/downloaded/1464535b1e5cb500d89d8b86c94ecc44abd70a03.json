Every candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, for example, has echoed the familiar refrain that the number of mass shootings is on the rise and that more stringent federal laws regulating the sale of firearms will ameliorate the \u201ccrisis of gun violence.\u201d The problem with these claims is that mass shootings are not increasing in frequency. Nor is there any objective evidence that new gun control laws would reduce their number.\n\nThis may be difficult to believe, considering the self-confident certitude with which gun control advocates make their assertions about the allegedly worsening state of affairs. Nonetheless, a little research will reveal that there isn\u2019t even a settled definition of \u201cmass shooting\u201d among the people who produce the statistics anti-gun activists so glibly repeat. Anthony C. Lopez Ph.D. of Washington State University wrote about this in Psychology Today shortly following the Dayton and El Paso tragedies. Lopez asks if the number of mass shootings is truly rising and explains why this deceptively simple query is very difficult to answer:\n\nThe answer to this question seems like it should be a straightforward matter of fact versus fiction: let\u2019s just count the number of times these things happen every year, throw them on a graph, and see what we find. Right? Wrong.\u2026 Defining \u201cmass shooting\u201d seems like a simple matter, but it sits at the complicated intersection of many questions: Who did it? Where did they do it? Who they did it to? Why did they do it?\n\nLopez points out that the answers to these questions are also quite elusive and concludes that the incidence of mass killings hasn\u2019t risen in frequency:\n\nSo what do we know? At the broadest level, defined in terms of at least any 4 people killed by anyone, by any weapon, for any reason, in any place, the frequency of mass killings seems to have remained relatively stable since at least 2006. This much seems relatively clear.\u2026 The risk is to cherry pick the data based on definitions of the problem that unproblematically lead to our pre-chosen favored policies.\n\nThat is exactly what \u201cBeto\u201d O\u2019Rourke did during the recent Democratic debate, and his favored policy is a textbook example of how dangerous it is to demagogue gun violence. It\u2019s difficult to imagine a faster way to increase shootings than for the government to \u201ccome after\u201d the firearms of law-abiding citizens. Why do the studies discussed by Lopez conflict with the public perception that mass shootings are increasing in frequency? The answer is sensationalized reporting of selected incidents by the legacy media. WCAI, an NPR affiliate in Massachusetts, interviewed researcher Jason Silva from William Paterson University who explained:\n\nThe average shooting only receives about four or five New York Times articles. Then there\u2019s these few high-profile events that receive extensive enormous levels of coverage.\u2026 We find that a lot of coverage is dedicated to school shooters, and a lot is dedicated to ideologically motivated perpetrators. However, with my research, we\u2019re finding that the reality is it\u2019s actually more often occurring in the workplace.\n\nSilva also told WCAI that the role of automatic or semi-automatic rifles in mass shootings is over-represented in the media, despite the well-documented reality that gun violence in general tends to be perpetrated with hand guns in crime-ridden cities. In Chicago, for example, 282 people have been shot to death in 2019 alone. This has received a mere fraction of the media coverage that the El Paso shooting got, despite the ironic fact that it occurred in a city with stringent gun control laws. This brings us to the effectiveness of legislation restricting the Second Amendment rights of Americans, such as that advocated by \u201cBeto\u201d O\u2019Rourke:\n\nDo bans on large-capacity magazines (LCMs) for semiautomatic firearms have significant potential for reducing the number of deaths and injuries in mass shootings? The most common rationale for an effect of [large capacity magazines] LCM use is that they allow mass killers to fire many rounds without reloading.\u2026 In all of the 23 incidents, the shooter possessed either multiple guns or multiple magazines.\n\nThis is from a study carried out at Florida State University, of nearly two dozen mass shootings in which semi-automatic \u201cassault\u201d rifles were used. The conclusion, if not obvious, was that the shooters could have continued firing without interruption by either switching loaded guns or changing to smaller loaded magazines. In other words, advocating a \u201cbuyback\u201d of rifles equipped with LCMs might provide people like former congressman O\u2019Rourke cheap applause lines, but it would have no effect on the death toll or frequency of mass shootings. Another example of useless gun laws involve restrictions on \u201cconcealed carry\u201d permits:\n\nRight-to-carry (RTC) laws mandate that concealed weapon permits be granted to qualified applicants.\u2026 We evaluate 25 RTC laws using state panel data for 1977 through 1999. We estimate numerous Poisson and negative binomial models and find virtually no support for the hypothesis that the laws increase or reduce the number of mass public shootings.\n\nThis is the conclusion of researchers at the College of William and Mary and the University of Alabama. Not that objective data matter to anti-gun activists. They believe they are entitled to their own facts. The Democrat-controlled House is even now perpetrating three new gun control bills. The first provides grants to states wishing to pass dangerous \u201cred flag\u201d laws, the second would impose a useless ban on rifles equipped with the LCMs discussed above, and the third would limit gun access to people convicted of misdemeanor hate crimes. The Democrats are determined to demagague gun violence until the voters boot them again.", "description": "Daniel Patrick Moynihan famously chided a debate opponent, \u201cEveryone is entitled to his own opinion, but not to his own facts.\u201d This would be a useful lesson for gun control advocates to learn.
