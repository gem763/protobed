Consumer staples or consumer discretionary? Stocks or bonds?\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the one stock you should buy now for the best returns!\u201d\n\n\u201cNow that you\u2019ve finally figured out what the \u201cGreat Rotation\u201d is, here\u2019s how to play it with smart-beta multi-factor ETFs.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget: Always buy low and sell high.\u201d\n\nThe amount of advice you get constantly about investing can be overwhelming. It can even be contradictory, especially at unsettled moments like the current one. We\u2019re either in the late innings of the economic cycle with a bit more room to run, or we\u2019re at that point at the bottom of the ninth when everyone makes for the exits to avoid traffic.\n\nThat\u2019s why it might be more useful than ever to think big. Instead of this stock or that trade, investors should take a holistic view of their investments, experts say. That approach, known as asset allocation, simply means finding the right balance between different asset classes, like stocks, bonds, and cash, and ignoring the daily tick-tock of market gyrations. And if that sounds too simplistic, here\u2019s a secret: professionals do it that way, too.\n\nAcademic studies, including the granddaddy of \u201cmodern portfolio theory\u201d by Harry Markowitz have shown that asset allocation, not picking specific winners and losers, is 90% of the game, said Richard Daskin, who manages money for clients through his firm, RSD Advisors. What\u2019s more, he said, \u201cit\u2019s much more efficient. It allows a money manager to be more focused on your goals because he isn\u2019t worried about, is Pepsi PEP, -0.57% better than Coke KO, -1.12% ?\u201d\n\nAnora Gaudiano, a senior advisor associate at New York-based Sontag Advisory, notes that constructing what are sometimes called \u201cmodel portfolios\u201d has become so common that it\u2019s nearly \u201ccommoditized.\u201d\n\nSontag advisors take a fairly common approach with clients, deciding together on what that household\u2019s risk profile and investment objective are. \u201cSay we decide that client is moderate-aggressive,\u201d Gaudiano said. \u201cThat would mean, say, 60% stocks, 40% bonds.\u201d\n\n\u201cCommoditized\u201d doesn\u2019t mean \u201ccookie-cutter,\u201d though. Some clients may have unique situations, like a heavy tax burden that may call for more exposure to municipal bonds, for example \u2013 but Sontag keeps its allocations just that high-level: stocks versus bonds.\n\n\u201cWhen we want to have US stock market exposure, we go to a large-cap index fund,\u201d Gaudiano said. \u201cThat\u2019s low-cost and difficult to beat no matter what you do.\u201d\n\nDaskin gets a little more granular, picking sectors \u2013 think consumer staples versus consumer discretionary \u2013 but no deeper. He also spends a lot of time thinking about risk. Rather than trading a client\u2019s holdings every time the wind shifts, he asks, \u201cis their portfolio diversified and resilient enough for different economic conditions?\u201d\n\nRelated: Three fund managers may soon control nearly half of all corporate voting power, researchers warn\n\nThe biggest consideration, Daskin said, whether individuals do it themselves or work with an advisor, is having a sense of how risk-averse they are. \u201cCan you stand it if you lose 10%? 20%?\u201d It\u2019s better to ask that question every so often than to rely on old models that say young people should be more risk-averse, and grow more conservative as they age. Younger investors may well need to protect a nest egg if they want to use it for, say, a down payment on a home, Daskin points out.\n\n(Here\u2019s a very basic introduction to how individual investors can think about risk in asset allocation.)\n\nAsset allocation isn\u2019t just the preferred path of financial professionals who work with individuals.\n\nNed Davis Research is a global macro research firm that also provides financial advisory and asset management services to institutional investors. Will Geisdorf, one of the firm\u2019s senior strategists, explained that the firm uses an old model suggested by the Wall Street Journal for their own in-house portfolio as a \u201cstatic benchmark,\u201d then adjusts according to economic conditions and other considerations.\n\nThe benchmark is 55% in stocks, 35% in bonds, and 10% in cash. But late last year, growing cautious, NDR strategists shifted their allocation to 40% stocks, 50% bonds, and 10% cash. \u201cThus advising maximum defensive positioning whatever your constraints and risk tolerance, we would view any rallying as an opportunity to lighten up ahead of increasing volatility in 2019,\u201d they wrote.\n\nSee also: Why buying and selling a house could soon be as simple as trading stocks\n\nIt\u2019s important for individual investors to remember that staying on top of economic, market, and political news enough to make even calls like those, that span the coming nine to 18 months, are time-consuming, Geisdorf said. Most retail investors would do best to \u201cset it and forget it,\u201d and remember that \u201cbroad exposure is best,\u201d he added.\n\nIn fact, NDR just published a white paper about asset allocation, and noted that \u201cover the last 92 years, the long-term real returns (i.e. net of inflation) for U.S. assets were 7% per year for stocks, and about 2.5% per year for bonds.\n\n\u201cBalanced portfolios (e.g. 60% equity, 35% bond and 5% cash) delivered a real return in the range of 4-5% per annum,\u201d the paper authors said. \u201cInvestors could withdraw 4% of their balance each year without reducing the purchasing power of their investments.\u201d\n\nIf the argument in favor of a broad, hands-off approach isn\u2019t convincing enough, here\u2019s one last piece of wisdom. Consider what Warren Buffett said of his instructions to the trustee who would manage his own family\u2019s wealth after his death.\n\n\u201cPut 10% of the cash in short-term government bonds and 90% in a very low-cost S&P 500 index fund VOO, -0.54% . (I suggest Vanguard\u2019s.) I believe the trust\u2019s long-term results from this policy will be superior to those attained by most investors \u2013 whether pension funds, institutions or individuals \u2013 who employ high-fee managers.\u201d\n\nRead: Forget the active vs. passive debate \u2014 what matters most is selecting the best portfolio mix", "description": "Experts from institutional investors to those who work with individual households to achieve financial goals say that most investors should decide on the...", "authors": ["Andrea Riquier"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR763_soda_i_ZG_20190920115544.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
