Jones spent the previous two seasons as the third-string quarterback for the Los Angeles Chargers, but after the team signed veteran Tyrod Taylor as a free agent in March and drafted Easton Stick out of North Dakota State to compete for the backup job behind Philip Rivers, Jones became expendable.\n\n\u201cI felt like I had a pretty good camp, but not good enough,\u201d said Jones, who completed 28 of 41 passes for 351 yards and one touchdown during the preseason and was among the Chargers\u2019 final cuts before his brief stint with Seattle. \u201cIt\u2019s a numbers game.\u201d\n\nJones burst on the scene as a sophomore, when he made the first start of his college career in place of the injured J.T. Barrett in the 2014 Big Ten Championship Game. He passed for 257 yards and three touchdowns in Ohio State\u2019s 59-0 rout of Wisconsin and started the Buckeyes\u2019 wins over Alabama and Oregon in the college football playoff a month later. Jones was benched in favor of Barrett midway through his junior year, after which he declared for the NFL draft with an 11-0 record as a starter.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Bills selected Jones in the fourth round of the 2016 NFL draft. He spent most of his rookie season on the bench, appearing in one game and completing 6 of 11 passes for 96 yards and an interception. After Buffalo relieved GM Doug Whaley of his duties the following summer, the team traded Jones to Los Angeles, where he was reunited with Chargers Coach and former Bills offensive coordinator Anthony Lynn.\n\nWhaley was hired as the XFL\u2019s senior VP of football operations last November and played a role in bringing Jones to the league.\n\n\u201cHe put that bug in my ear,\u201d said Jones, who was introduced to Defenders Coach and GM Pep Hamilton by another former Bills staffer who joined the XFL, pro scout Gerald Dixon.\n\nAD\n\nHamilton, who played quarterback at Howard University, has more than 20 years of coaching experience at the collegiate and NFL levels, including four years working with Andrew Luck at Stanford and with the Colts. Jones said Hamilton\u2019s track record of developing quarterbacks made signing with D.C. \u201ca no-brainer.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn February, Hamilton described his offense as \u201can attacking, fast-paced style of play that will feature the playmakers that we have on the team.\u201d Jones said he won\u2019t be heavily involved in the draft process, as Hamilton and his staff start to put together their 71-man roster beginning at 10 a.m. Tuesday. Washington has the No. 1 pick.\n\nJones left Ohio State the year that Haskins arrived in Columbus, so he isn\u2019t especially close with the Redskins\u2019 rookie first-round quarterback.\n\nAD\n\nTo much success & congrats on the first couple TDs. Many more to come @dh_simba7 \u2014 Cardale Jones (@Cardale7_) September 23, 2017\n\n\u201cWe never played together, but when we\u2019re back at Ohio State, we bounce ideas off of each other,\u201d Jones said of his relationship with Haskins. \u201cI haven\u2019t reached out to him since I\u2019ve been here because I\u2019m letting him focus on his rookie season. This is all new to me, too. I\u2019m just letting him figure out the ins and outs of the NFL.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nJones understands firsthand the challenge of adjusting to an NFL offense, especially after only starting the equivalent of one full season in college. He said \u201cphysical reps are more important than mental reps,\u201d but acknowledged that some rookie quarterbacks benefit from spending time as a backup, as Haskins continues do to in Washington.\n\n\u201cIt all depends on the player and how far along the coach thinks that player is,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt\u2019s gone both ways. Look at a guy like Aaron Rodgers, who sat behind [Brett] Favre for a number of years and he\u2019s going to be a Hall of Famer. And then you\u2019ve got guys like [Patrick] Mahomes and [Deshaun] Watson that were thrown into the fire as young players. Look at the things they\u2019re doing now.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nA projected starter for the first time since his college days, Jones is looking forward to doing big things in D.C.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just excited to play and represent the Defenders on the field as well as off the field,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a really good year for us.\u201d\n\nThe other quarterbacks assigned Tuesday were Landry Jones, Brandon Silvers, Phillip Walker, Matt McGloin, Luis Perez and Jordan Ta\u2019amu.\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nAD", "description": "Jones helped lead the Buckeyes to a national title in 2015.", "authors": ["Scott Allen", "Reporter Covering D.C.
