Daimler further said the vans in question belonged to a previous generation of vehicles which have been out of production since 2016.\n\nKBA has been made aware that the software found in the vans was also being used in other vehicle variants, Daimler said, adding that it had completed a review of its fleet.\n\n\"KBA has now also initiated a hearing procedure. Daimler has presented the functionality to KBA in May 2018 and thereafter explained it in detail in further meetings since summer 2018. We continue to fully cooperate with KBA,\" a spokesman said.\n\nIn June, Daimler issued a profit warning and announced an increase of legal provisions by a high three-digit million euros amount, to cover various ongoing governmental proceedings and measures relating to diesel vehicles.", "description": "Mercedes-Benz faces new emissions recall due to older vans - Bild", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXNPEF950AX_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
