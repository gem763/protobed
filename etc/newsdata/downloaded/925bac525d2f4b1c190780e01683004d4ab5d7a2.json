He was 92.\n\nHis death was announced by his agency, Alan Brodie Representation, which did not provide additional details.\n\nIn a mordantly funny style, Mr. Nichols addressed themes of death, disability and homosexuality, incorporating elements of vaudeville, British music-hall entertainment and his own life and upbringing. His work induced squirming in the audience as well as occasional scorn from English censors, but he won four of the London Evening Standard\u2019s prestigious drama awards, was twice nominated for the Tony Award for best play and, in 2018, was named a commander of the Order of the British Empire.\n\nA prolific writer who had maintained a daily journal since the age of 18, Mr. Nichols also penned novels, radio plays, poetry, and film and television scripts, including for the popular British crime series \u201cInspector Morse\u201d and for \u201cGeorgy Girl,\u201d a 1966 romantic comedy based on a best-selling novel by Margaret Forster.\n\nBut he was best known for his first major play, \u201cJoe Egg,\u201d which premiered in Glasgow, Scotland, in 1967 before opening on London\u2019s West End. Like most of his works, it was semi-autobiographical, about a father raising a brain-damaged child \u2014 described onstage as \u201ca vegetable\u201d \u2014 who loosely resembled Mr. Nichols\u2019s daughter Abigail, who spent most of her life in a hospital before dying in 1971 at the age of 11.\n\nThe play was initially bitter and crushing in its depiction of the girl\u2019s disability and her parent\u2019s struggle to care for her. But with help from director Michael Blakemore, Mr. Nichols rewrote \u201cJoe Egg,\u201d turning it into something that he described as \u201cmore Coward than Strindberg,\u201d referring to the droll playwright No\u00ebl Coward and the serious-minded dramatist August Strindberg.\n\n\n\nMr. Nichols with his medal after being appointed a commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2018.

It received four Tony nominations, including for best play, and inspired a 1972 film with Alan Bates and Janet Suzman. (A 1985 Broadway revival received a Tony for best reproduction, and a 2003 production earned a Tony nomination for best revival.)\n\nMr. Nichols received a second Tony nomination for \u201cThe National Health,\u201d produced at Britain\u2019s National Theatre in 1969 before moving to Broadway five years later. Set in a London hospital ward for the terminally ill, it featured \u201cgallows humor of a kind that makes us simultaneously gasp and laugh,\u201d wrote New Yorker theater critic Brendan Gill.\n\nIn the late 1970s and early \u201980s, Mr. Nichols wrote three shows for the Royal Shakespeare Company: \u201cPrivates on Parade,\u201d a musical farce inspired by his service with a military entertainment group, later adapted into a 1983 film starring John Cleese; \u201cPassion Play\u201d (performed on Broadway as \u201cPassion\u201d), in which two sets of actors portrayed characters\u2019 public and private selves simultaneously; and \u201cPoppy,\u201d a musical comedy set during the First Opium War in China.\n\n1 of 55 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Notable deaths in 2019: Valerie Harper, Ross Perot, Doris Day, John Singleton, and others we have lost this year View Photos Remembering those who have died in 2019.

In part, he acknowledged, his disappearance from major stages was perhaps a consequence of his undiplomatic behavior, including a 1993 incident in which he published a mischievous poem in the Independent newspaper, \u201cThe Rime of the Ancient Dramatist,\u201d describing a quarrel with the director of the National Theatre. (\u201cThis is the fourth play of mine / You\u2019ve found your reasons to decline.\u201d)\n\nIn 2007, the Telegraph newspaper called Mr. Nichols \u201cthe theater\u2019s preeminent Grumpy Old Man.\u201d He estimated that he had about 40 works that had been rejected \u2014 including unmade film scripts that were turned into rejected novels, and novels that were repurposed into unseen plays \u2014 but was still writing, even if few of his works were staged.\n\n\u201cIf I won the lottery I know exactly what I would do,\u201d he told the Guardian in 2000. \u201cI would put myself in the Alan Ayckbourn or Andrew Lloyd Webber position and buy my own theater. I would hire a company and have them do my plays over and over and over again, not caring if people came or not. I would love to do that. It would be wonderful to see the unproduced plays on a stage.\u201d\n\nPeter Richard Nichols was born in Bristol, England, on July 31, 1927. His mother was a homemaker; his father was a salesman and a somewhat puritanical theatergoer who was said to have shouted \u201cLadies present!\u201d when comedians performed smutty material.\n\nMr. Nichols was conscripted into the Royal Air Force in the mid-1940s and served in the entertainment corps in Southeast Asia. Returning home, he studied at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School and acted in theater and television productions, playing Count Dracula onstage in Scotland before taking a teaching position to support his playwriting.\n\nHe found early success with \u201cWalk on the Grass\u201d (1959), a TV play that won a BBC writing competition, and went on to write the screenplay for director John Boorman\u2019s first feature-length film, \u201cCatch Us If You Can\u201d (released in the United States as \u201cHaving a Wild Weekend\u201d), a 1965 vehicle for the English rock band the Dave Clark Five.\n\nProceeds from the script enabled Mr. Nichols to focus on his writing, beginning with \u201cJoe Egg.\u201d His other major plays included \u201cForget-Me-Not Lane,\u201d about a middle-aged man reflecting on his childhood and problems with his marriage, and \u201cChez Nous,\u201d about two married couples on the verge of separating while vacationing in France.\n\nSurvivors include his wife, Thelma Reed; three children; seven grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.\n\nIn interviews, Mr. Nichols often recommended that aspiring writers \u201cget a friend at court,\u201d someone who could help them mount their plays and serve as an advocate behind the scenes. He had some additional advice after the 1987 London premiere of \u201cA Piece of My Mind,\u201d about a playwright who \u2014 like Mr. Nichols \u2014 moved to the countryside to write a novel, then turned his unsuccessful manuscript into a play.\n\nThe production was poorly received, and its subject matter did Mr. Nichols no favors among reviewers. \u201cAnother piece of advice I would give young writers,\u201d he told the Guardian, recalling the show\u2019s release, \u201cis not to have a character called The Critic who lives in a toilet in your play.\u201d", "description": "He was a leading British playwright in the 1960s and \u201970s, later described as \u201cthe theater\u2019s preeminent Grumpy Old Man.\u201d", "authors": ["Harrison Smith", "Obituary Writer", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/_HoNdvsAHEn4Lw_IxQlvft8Ubso=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J3TPU7GT6MI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
