Your life revolved around your sexual activities with young children. Your distorted beliefs in respect of children are deep-seated. Your self-delusion knows no bounds. It is also clear that, had you not been arrested, you planned to continue the same lifestyle using the expertise that you were keen to show off to and share with other abusers so as to continue your sexual exploitation of the children of such communities.\n\nReports said prior to his death, Huckle refused to cooperate with authorities when they tried to unlock a cache of encrypted files he had access to that may contain the names of victims and other pedophiles, according to Fox News.", "description": "A convicted pedophile who abused almost 200 children was stabbed to death in North Yorkshire, England, on Sunday.", "authors": ["Amy Furr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/01/GettyImages-598303910-e1483897841935.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
