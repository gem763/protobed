(AP) - Most people go to the annual Far Hills Race Meeting to see the power of horses.\n\nThis year they will see a unique display of horsepower at the races - three police vehicles wrapped in pink to highlight Breast Cancer Awareness Month.\n\nThe thousands who attend the annual event, scheduled for Oct. 19 at Moorland Farm in Far Hills, will have the opportunity to sign their names on the cars to show their support of the fight against breast cancer, Ron Kennedy, of the Far Hills Race Meeting Association, said Friday morning at a news conference on the steps of the Historic Courthouse to unveil the pink vehicles.\n\nSupporting health care has always been the primary mission of the Far Hills Race Meeting, Kennedy said.\n\nThe event, which is marking its 99th anniversary this month, has donated more than $18 million to Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Somerset, which honored the event\u2019s continuing support by naming its cancer care facility, the Steeplechase Cancer Care Center.\n\nLast year, the Far Hills event donated $100,000 to the center, said Deidre Blaus, vice president of the Steeplechase Cancer Care Center. About a third of the center\u2019s patients have breast cancer, she said.\n\nThe Far Hills event also supports five other charities - Cancer Support Community of Central Jersey, Community in Crisis, LifeCamp, the ARC of Somerset County and the Bonnie Brae School.\n\nThe idea to wrap the police vehicles in pink for October originated with the Franklin Township PBA, said Somerset County Prosecutor Michael Robertson.\n\nThe vehicles will be used by the Franklin and Branchburg police departments and the prosecutor\u2019s office. The cars are part of Robertson\u2019s campaign to promote engagement between law enforcement and the community.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s working,\u201d the prosecutor said, adding that he has already received calls from Franklin residents who had seen the pink car on the street.\n\n\u201cWhat better way to create community awareness,\u201d Robertson said, adding that he hoped next year, all police departments in the county would have at least one pink vehicle.\n\n\u201cThis campaign is proof positive that our police officers are deeply dedicated to the communities they serve,\u201d he said.\n\nBesides improving relations with the community, Robertson emphasized that the pink police vehicles will raise awareness of breast cancer.\n\n\u201cOne in eight women will be affected by breast cancer in their lifetime,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cEarly detection is a key factor in offering more treatment options and increasing survivability.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Courier News (Bridgewater, N.J.) , http://www.mycentraljersey.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Most people go to the annual Far Hills Race Meeting to see the power of horses.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mike Deak"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
