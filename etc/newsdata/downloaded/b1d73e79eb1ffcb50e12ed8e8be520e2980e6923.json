A giant fire-breathing reptile, however, was less horrifying than what was to come. In less than a decade\u2019s time, there would be dozens of real undersea beasts capable of destroying multiple cities at a time. I\u2019m referring, of course, to ballistic-missile submarines, or \u201cboomers\u201d in U.S. Navy parlance.\n\nThe most deadly of the real-life kaiju prowling the oceans today are the fourteen Ohio-class ballistic-missile submarines, which carry upwards of half of the United States\u2019 nuclear arsenal onboard.\n\nIf you do the math, the Ohio-class boats may be the most destructive weapon system created by humankind. Each of the 170-meter-long vessels can carry twenty-four Trident II submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) which can be fired from underwater to strike at targets more than seven thousand miles away depending on the load.\n\nAs a Trident II reenters the atmosphere at speeds of up to Mach 24, it splits into up to eight independent reentry vehicles, each with a 100- or 475-kiloton nuclear warhead. In short, a full salvo from an Ohio-class submarine\u2014which can be launched in less than one minute\u2014could unleash up to 192 nuclear warheads to wipe twenty-four cities off the map. This is a nightmarish weapon of the apocalypse.\n\nThe closest competitor to the Ohio-class submarine is the Russia\u2019s sole remaining Typhoon-class submarine, a larger vessel with twenty ballistic-missile launch tubes. However, China, Russia, India, England and France all operate multiple ballistic-missile submarines with varying missile armaments\u2014and even a few such submarines would suffice to annihilate the major cities in a developed nation.\n\nWhat possible excuse is there for such monstrous, nation-destroying weaponry?\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Watch out North Korea, Russia or China.", "authors": ["Sebastien Roblin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/K8sQ7KixtUg_oyyeKdKLbw--~B/aD01OTg7dz0xMTE3O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/0d2379da029efdf6bc5480fb9a9933fc", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
