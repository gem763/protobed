It is a horrific weapon, and has been used repeatedly during the Syrian civil war; unfortunately its use has become increasingly normalised.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nWhite phosphorus sticks to the skin and can not be put out\n\nThe UN has announced it is investigating allegations Turkey has used the banned weapon, known as Willie Pete when it was used in Vietnam.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons also said it was \u2018aware of the situation and is collecting information with regard to possible use of chemical weapons\u2019.\n\nWhite phosphorus sticks to the skin and burns in contact with moisture. It can not be put out and in some cases can burn through to the bone.\n\nThe video was released by Kurdish media together with a series of photographs from another hospital in al-Hasakah, also close to Ras al-Ayn, showing boys with deep burns to their faces.\n\nKurdish authorities in northeastern Syria have accused accused Turkey using as napalm and white phosphorus munitions, a charge Ankara has denied.\n\nThe boy was said to have to wait 12 hours before being treated by doctors\n\nThere were similar scenes in other hospitals as reports of chemical weapons use grows (Picture: MetroGrab)\n\nDozens of civilians have been killed and more than 300,000 people forced to flee their homes since fighting began this month.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based monitoring group with a wide network of sources on the ground, could not confirm if Turkey had begun a campaign of chemical warfare but the group\u2019s chief Rami Abdel Rahman said there had been a spike in burn wounds over the past two days, mostly casualties brought in from the Ras al-Ain area.\n\nChemical weapons were made notorious by their widespread use by US forces during the Vietnam War.\n\nNapalm and related chemicals are mixtures of a gelling agent and a volatile petrochemical used in incendiary bombs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhite phosphorus is often used to create smokescreens or battlefield markers, but can also be deployed as a deadly incendiary weapon which is prohibited under international law.\n\nChemical warfare is becoming increasingly normalised said the former commander of the UK\u2019s chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear regiment (Picture: Metrograb)\n\nA spokesman for the Syrian Democratic Forces, the autonomous Kurdish region\u2019s de facto army, called on international organisations to send in experts.\n\n\u2018We urge international organisations to send their teams to investigate some wounds sustained in attacks,\u2019 Mustefa Bali said on social media.\n\nPassengers wrap drunk man in cling film after he tried to kick open plane door\n\nAll images and video were captured before a ceasefire, negotiated with Turkey by Vice President Mike Pence, came into effect on Thursday night.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal Turkey said it would halt its assault on northern Syria for five days to allow Kurdish forces withdraw from a 20-mile wide \u2018safe zone\u2019 President Erdogan wants to create along the border.\n\nThe deal was agreed by Pence, Erdogan and the commander of the Kurdish-led SDF, however it is not clear if the Kurdish militias would hand over land they fought and regained from ISIS.\n\nYesterday morning there were reports of shelling and gunfire in Ras al-Ayn, in breach of the ceasefire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUS President Donald Trump said his Turkish counterpart Erdogan told him there had been minor sniper and mortar fire in the region \u2018that was quickly eliminated\u2019 and the Turkish leader assured him in a call that \u2018he very much wants the ceasefire, or pause, to work.\u2019\n\nThe Kurdish Syrian Democratic Force accused Turkey, however, of violating the ceasefire deal.\n\n\u2018Despite the agreement to halt the fighting, air and artillery attacks continue to target the positions of fighters, civilian settlements and the hospital\u2019 in the border town of Ras al-Ain in northeastern Syria, its spokesman said.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
