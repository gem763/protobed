He was so funny and silly and clever and kind and handsome and his smile made my heart soar.\n\n\"We were together for nearly six years and he made me the happiest man on the planet.\n\n\"In the end he lost his battle with addiction and depression. I guess some people don\u2019t have the armour for this world. I think of him probably a hundred times a day, every day. In truth, I think of little else.\"\n\n(Image: FilmMagic)\n\nHe concluded: \"I would give anything to see him again and maybe one day I will, but for now I will be grateful for the time we had together and the love we shared.\n\n\"It was like no other.\"\n\nKevin and Matt were married from 2006-2008, and their civil partnership ceremony was attended by famous faces including Barbara Windsor, Elton John and Courtney Love.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n(Image: realmattlucas/Instagram)\n\nMatt has spoken out before about struggling to deal with his grief.\n\nHe told the Sunday Times magazine he sought help from a bereavement counsellor and made the decision not to turn to alcohol, cigarettes or drugs.\n\n\"Not turning to drink, which I hardly ever do \u2014 I probably have six units a year,\" he said.\n\n(Image: Rex)\n\nInstead, Matt moved to California and started organising sexual hook-ups on the internet.\n\n\"I ended up eating lots and having lots of sex,\" he said. \"That was how I responded.\n\n\u201cAs much as anything I was trying to distract myself.\u201d", "description": "The comedian and actor honoured Kevin with a heartbreaking Instagram post", "authors": ["Verity Sulway", "Image", "Filmmagic", "Getty Images", "Realmattlucas Instagram", "Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20466091.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Matt-Lucas-and-Kevin-McGee-Civil-Partnership-Ceremony.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
