(Katherine Frey/The Washington Post)\n\nMetro officials on Monday said they will allow test trains to resume running on the Silver Line after receiving assurances from the agency overseeing construction of the rail extension and the contractor hired to build it that its trains won\u2019t be put in jeopardy.\n\n\u201cThis clears the way for dynamic testing to continue,\u201d said Charles Stark, the project\u2019s executive director. The testing is done to ensure the rail line\u2019s systems are working properly.\n\nTesting was halted for a little less than one week.\n\nThe decision to resume tests is a relief to the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (MWAA), which is overseeing construction of the second phase of the $5.8 billion rail line and its contractor, Capital Rail Constructors (CRC). The project is more than a year behind schedule, and the delay in testing could have further pushed back completion.\n\nMetro officials were quick to say that the decision to allow testing does not resolve long-standing concerns it has with the quality of track work by CRC.\n\nLast year, officials discovered that some of the concrete rail ties installed at sections where sets of track come together had too much curvature in them to meet Metro\u2019s standards. And while project officials have said the problem affects fewer rail ties than originally thought, CRC has been unable to come up with a solution acceptable to Metro.\n\n\n\nThe pedestrian bridges that connect to the Herndon station along Metro\u2019s Silver Line were nearly complete in July. (Katherine Frey/The Washington Post)\n\n[Metro said it will not allow Silver Line test trains to run because of safety concerns]\n\nThe problem that prompted Metro to halt testing, however, surfaced after the MWAA told the transit agency it had discovered a possible manufacturing defect in a part used in areas where sets of tracks come together.\n\nA day later, on Sept. 13, Metro told the MWAA that because of the potential safety risks, it would not allow any of its trains to be used in testing until the problem was resolved.\n\nThe MWAA and CRC conducted two inspections of the areas of concern on Thursday and Saturday. Metro personnel also participated. Based on those inspections, CRC and the MWAA said Metro trains could operate safely along those sections of track. Given those assurances, Metro said it will allow testing to resume.\n\nWhile construction of the rail line is being overseen by the MWAA, Metro will ultimately be responsible for operating and maintaining the rail line once it is complete.\n\nMetro officials have grown increasingly concerned with the quality of the work on the line\u2019s second phase, which will extend service to Washington Dulles International Airport and into Loudoun County. The project has been beset by problems, particularly with concrete structures. Metro has spent more than $100,000 on consultants to evaluate CRC\u2019s work on the project.\n\n[Why second phase of Silver Line has been more problem-plagued than the first]\n\nEarlier this month, Metro board members were briefed on a growing list of construction concerns, ranging from concrete panels installed at five of the six new stations and track work on both the main rail line and in the rail yard being built as part of the project. Metro\u2019s inspector general told the agency that accepting the rail line before the problems are resolved could create \u201cextraordinary cost, maintenance and operational issues early on once [Metro] takes ownership and control of this project.\u201d\n\nHowever, the MWAA\u2019s board of directors maintains that the concerns are overstated and the problems are being addressed.\n\nThe first phase of the project \u2014 four stations in Tysons and one in Reston \u2014 was built by a consortium led by Bechtel and opened July 26, 2014. CRC, a venture between Bethesda, Md.-based Clark Construction Group and Kiewit Infrastructure Group, is building the rail line for the second phase, while Colorado-based Hensel Phelps is building the rail yard.\n\nThe MWAA is using revenue from tolls to fund nearly half the cost to build the line. Under current projections, by 2053, when the last of the bonds sold to fund the project are paid off, most drivers will be paying $12.50 for a one-way trip on the 14-mile Dulles Toll Road.\n\nRead more:\n\nMetro\u2019s IG cautions officials against accepting the Silver Line prematurely\n\nWhat has the Silver Line\u2019s second phase run into so many problems?\n\nDulles Toll Road users shoulder an increasing share of Silver Line costs\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Safety concerns had prompted the transit agency to halt testing on the rail line.", "authors": ["Lori Aratani", "Reporter Focusing On Transportation Issues", "Including Airports", "Airlines", "The Nation'S Railroad", "Subway Systems", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/wIYrYXwWIpDF5tOveHY4YI127LU=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6EY5DCFEHEI6TJ3H26VYJLXT5E.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
