I think the \u2018Help to Buy\u2019 scheme is much more widely advertised than shared ownership,\" Megan explained.\n\n\"One of the things that put me off as a young first-time buyer was that I thought I would need to put down a large deposit when actually I found out I could put down as little as 5%.\n\n\"If more people knew how much money they could save through buying instead of renting, I think it would encourage them to explore this option.\"\n\n(Image: SUPPLIED)\n\nMegan and her boyfriend were living at home with their parents at the time - when they decided they wanted their own place.\n\nWith hard work and saving, by cutting back on non-essential items, the pair were able to put down a 5% deposit on a two-bed town house, priced at around \u00a3180,000.\n\nThey currently own 35% percent of the property value with the option to buy more in the future.\n\n\"There\u2019s no timescale on saving money for a mortgage, but it is possible. Being aware of how much you want to save from the beginning really helps you stay on track and knowing you\u2019ll be buying a house is a great incentive,\" she said.\n\n\u201cIf we hadn\u2019t found out about shared ownership, we would still be living with family and struggling to save for a large deposit.\u201d\n\nVal Shakespeare, director of estate agent Royston & Lund, said: \"For many young people who dreaming about getting on the property ladder, shared ownership might not be on their radar.\n\n\"However, buying your first home early is a brilliant step and can help you save money in the long run instead of trying to rent and save up for a deposit simultaneously.\"\n\nTalking about how first-time buyers can get on the scheme, Megan said it's important to get advice from the right people - and ask as many questions as you can.\n\n\"My advice for young first-time buyers would be to ask estate agents, financial advisors and/or solicitors as many questions as possible and make sure you shop around before you buy.\n\n\"Getting onto the property ladder can be difficult if you aren\u2019t aware of what schemes are available. Many people my age are not ready to buy a property, but if you know what you want to achieve, anything is possible,\u201d Megan said.\n\nAnd speaking on what she wishes she was warned about beforehand, Megan said it's worth looking into the time frames.\n\n\"The shared ownership process from start to completion day took three to four months but I have known the process to be a lot quicker than this.\n\n\"One of the reasons why it took longer was because my property wasn't built throughout the process I had to wait for it to be built.\"", "description": "Megan and her boyfriend were living at home with their parents until six months ago - when they decided they wanted their own place", "authors": ["Emma Munbodh", "Image", "Supplied", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20537671.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_THP_CHP_081019Slug_10517JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
