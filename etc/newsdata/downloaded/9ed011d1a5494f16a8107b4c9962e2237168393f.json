Who signed the Saudi journalist\u2019s death warrant? Who dispatched the 15 killers, including a forensic expert, aboard the two planes to Istanbul?\u201d\n\nKhashoggi entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, 2018, to collect a document that he needed to marry his Turkish fiancee. Agents of the Saudi government killed Khashoggi inside the consulate and apparently dismembered his body, which has never been found.\n\nSaudi Arabia initially offered multiple, shifting accounts about Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance. As international pressure mounted, the kingdom eventually settled on the explanation that he was killed by rogue officials in a brawl inside their consulate.\n\nThe kingdom has put 11 people on trial in non-public proceedings. No one has been convicted so far.\n\nErdogan criticized the court proceedings in Saudi Arabia, which he said lacked transparency and maintained that some of Khashoggi\u2019s murderers \u201cenjoy de facto freedom.\u201d The court proceedings \u201ctarnish the image of Saudi Arabia,\u201d Erdogan added.\n\nA U.N. report released earlier this year asserted that Saudi Arabia bore responsibility for the killing and that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s possible role should be investigated.\n\nOn Sunday, Prince Mohammed said in a television interview that he takes \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for Khashoggi\u2019s death but denied allegations that he ordered it.\n\n\u201cThis was a heinous crime,\u201d Prince Mohammed, 34, told \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d \u201dBut I take full responsibility as a leader in Saudi Arabia, especially since it was committed by individuals working for the Saudi government.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Days ahead of the anniversary of the grisly slaying of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Monday that his country will press ahead with efforts to shed light on the killing.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/27/general_assembly_khashoggi_anniversary_82322_c0-141-3000-1890_s1770x1032.jpg?1e41fa74dcdbda86cf72873915af885e2b3a14cb", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
