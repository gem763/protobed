Because of my current indecision, and without the type of mental and physical commitment that I\u2019m accustomed to having, I\u2019ve decided to step away from the game.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to me that the focus of attention is on the current, very talented group the Carolina Hurricanes have assembled, as they prepare to build on the momentum and growth we established last season.\u201d\n\nWilliams scored 46 regular-season goals and six playoff goals across the 2014-15 and 2015-16 seasons with Washington. He then rejoined Carolina, for whom he played earlier in his career, and as a team captain led the Hurricanes to the 2019 Stanley Cup Playoffs \u2014 including a first-round upset of the defending champion Capitals.\n\nNicknamed \u201cMr. Game 7,\u201d Williams holds the NHL record with 15 career points in Game 7 situations, and his teams are 8-1 in those games.\n\nHurricanes president and general manager Don Waddell implied the team was aware of Williams\u2018 uncertainty over the summer.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate Justin\u2019s honesty and openness throughout this process, and respect his decision,\u201d Waddell said in a statement. \u201cHe\u2019s been an important part of our team, but we did prepare our roster with the understanding that he might step away. We are confident in the group we\u2019ve assembled.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
