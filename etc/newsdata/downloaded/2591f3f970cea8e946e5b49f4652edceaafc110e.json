Perhaps the oversized decorative fork and spoon on the wall in your parents\u2019 house is worth something, too?\n\nThe woman thought the 8\u201d x 10\u201d painting was just an old religious icon that she had hanging above a hotplate for cooking food, when she took it to her local auctioneers to be valued, The Guardian reports. Turns out it was a work by the 13th century Florentine master Cimabue, also known as Cenni di Pepo, that was believed to be lost.\n\nWhile art historians are still debating the painting\u2019s history, it is believed to be part of a large diptych dating back to 1280. Two other scenes from the work hang in the National Gallery in London and in the Frick Collection in New York. The work as a whole depicts the passion of Christ as well as his crucifixion. The newly-discovered painting is called \u201cChrist Mocked\u201d, and seems to fit in with the other eight scenes in the Cimabue series. \u201cThe painting was done by the same hand,\u201d art expert \u00c9ric Turquin told French newspaper Le Figaro.\n\nThe painting by Cimabue, the artist who taught fresco-master Giotto how to paint, could be worth up to $6.5 million. If you\u2019re in the market for a Renaissance masterpiece via a French kitchen, it will go up for sale at the Acteon auction house on October 27.", "description": "The painting by Cimabue could be worth up to $6.5 million", "authors": ["Melissa Locker"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/XEA5sVEWC0gpZ9solBdOmA--~B/aD0xOTg5O3c9Mjk3NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/be051f6c71de8fd51bd0f1dee71e08c4", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
