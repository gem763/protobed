Michael Gargiulo, 43, was convicted in August of a string of brutal attacks on young women -- one of his victims was getting ready for a date with Ashton Kutcher when she was murdered.\n\nIt's a sensational case that's riveted Hollywood. \"48 Hours\" correspondent Maureen Maher has been on the trail of Gargiulo for more than a decade and helped break the case wide open. She takes a deep dive into the mind of this serial killer \u2013 and shows how he got away with it for so long.\n\nFour young women: three murdered, one left to tell the story. Tricia Pacaccio, Ashley Ellerin, Maria Bruno, and Michelle Murphy never saw it coming.\n\nThe trial of an accused serial killer has dominated the headlines in Los Angeles. He's known as the \"Hollywood Ripper.\"\n\nProsecutor Dan Akemon [in court]: The methodical and systematic slaughter of women \u2026 that's what this case is about.\n\nIt is not overstating it to say this is a sensational murder trial. On the witness list: actor Ashton Kutcher, who was scheduled to go on a date with one of the victims the night she was murdered.\n\nBut had the so-called Hollywood Ripper killed others? That was the question investigators more than 1,800 miles away had been wrestling with.\n\nFor \"48 Hours\" correspondent Maureen Maher, this story begins near her home just outside Chicago.\n\nTRICIA PACACCIO | CHICAGO, 1993\n\nDiane Pacaccio: We were told that we have to understand that some murders go unsolved \u2026 And I was like, there is no way somebody is going to come to my door, outside my door and do this and get away with it.\n\nThe murder of Tricia Pacaccio is a case \"48 Hours\" has been working on since the summer of 2008. It took years to gain her parents trust \u2014 that maybe somehow by telling Tricia's story, we could help catch her killer.\n\nRick Pacaccio | Tricia's father: For years Cook County was telling us it may go unsolved.\n\nDiane Pacaccio | Tricia's mother: Our daughter's case should not \u2026 ever go unsolved \u2026 that would be a travesty.\n\nIt was not long after sunrise on the morning of August 14, 1993.\n\nRick Pacaccio: I was going out to my van, and when I saw it was her, I ran over there and \u2014 and saw what happened to her.\n\nRick Pacaccio had just walked out the garage, when out of the corner of his eye he saw his 18-year-old daughter Tricia splayed out on the landing, stabbed to death.\n\nRick Pacaccio: \u2026 I tried to revive her. \u2026 that is the worst feeling in your life, when you can't do nothin' to somebody you love.\n\nDoug Pacaccio | Tricia's brother: I remember just waking up to this bloodcurdling scream of my father... and it was \"Doug call 911 \u2026 Doug call 911! \u2026 I don't really want to describe the details of what I saw. [Maureen Maher: That's OK] I have nightmares about it all the time.\n\nThe police arrived, and Rick had to make a difficult call to his wife Diane.\n\nDiane Pacaccio: He called me at work and said, \"you have to come home. Tricia's hurt.\"\n\n\n\nOfficer Ray Salihovich saw her pull up.\n\nOfficer Ray Salihovich: I heard a lady screaming \u2026 and the mother had just exited her vehicle \u2026 and she was running toward Trish. I basically tackled her. I didn't want her to see Trish like this and remember her daughter like that.\n\nDiane Pacaccio: Who would do this to her? There is nobody that knew her that would do this to her \u2026 my daughter never did anything to put herself in harm's way. \u2026 You \u2014 she was the type of girl that you knew where she was, what she was doing, and you never had to worry about her.\n\nCBS News/Pacaccio family\n\nTricia was also the type of girl who made the most of high school. She took calculus, was on the debate team, and played clarinet in the band. At the time of her murder, she was just a few days away from moving onto the next chapter in her young and exciting life as a freshman at Purdue University.\n\nDiane Pacaccio: She had a great attitude about everything \u2026 And she knew what she wanted out of life.\n\nMaureen Maher: Were you close with her?\n\nDiane Pacaccio: Yeah [cries].\n\nKaren Jones: Tricia was \u2014 an amazing girl. \u2026 was probably one of the most energetic and happy people I've ever seen.\n\nTricia's close friend Karen Jones spent a lot of time at the Pacaccio house.\n\nKaren Jones: Her mom was very caring and treated us all like her children.\n\nTricia's younger brothers, 17-year-old Doug and 13-year-old Tommy, often had their friends over.\n\nDiane Pacaccio: I fed the whole neighborhood. \u2026 everybody ate there.\n\nKaren Jones: They were just a very warm family.\n\nOn the night of August 13, Karen, Tricia, and most of the kids from their senior class went out \u2014 one last hurrah for the summer.\n\nKaren Jones: That night, a whole group of us got together for a scavenger hunt \u2026 for one of the final parties of the summer before we all went off to college. \u2026 We \u2026 ended things at the restaurant, and people started getting in their cars to go home.\n\nPolice believe it was around 1 a.m. as Tricia walked toward the side door of the house, keys in hand, that the killer grabbed her left arm, twisting and breaking it and then stabbing her 12 times.\n\nDoug Pacaccio: I remember \u2026 my chest just sank. The minute I realized that she was gone. And there was nothing I could do to help her.\n\nDetectives interviewed dozens of people. Some parents were too afraid to even let their kids talk. No one seemed to know anything \u2013 there were no leads, no arrests.\n\nRick Pacaccio: To be honest, I think we were zonked out for a long, long time. \u2026 people talk about closure. My experience is there is no closure. That void is always there.\n\nRick Pacaccio also had no idea how to go on living in the same house where he had found the butchered body of his beautiful daughter. The family moved out for four years. Eventually, they decided it was time to come back home. Shortly after, they had an unexpected visitor: former high school football player Michael Gargiulo \u2014 one of Doug Pacaccio's closest childhood friends.\n\nMaureen Maher: Michael you've known since he was how old?\n\nDiane Pacaccio: Since probably he was in second grade. \u2026 Because he lived on the next street.\n\nDiane Pacaccio: Michael showed up at the door and he says, \"I \u2014 I need to talk to Rick,\" and I said, \"Well, he's at work Michael,\" and he said \"Well, can I wait?\" and I say, \"Yes.\" \u2026 He sat and waited for over an hour for him to come home from work \u2014 sat at my kitchen table.\n\nRick Pacaccio: I remember walkin' in the garage door \u2026 and I looked at him \u2014 he had this look on his face like he was gonna say something to me.\n\nBut before Michael Gargiulo had the chance to say anything \u2026\n\nRick Pacaccio: The garage door opens, his father and one of his sisters come in, and say, \"We have to leave, Michael.\" And they picked him up and whisk him out and the door closed. \u2026 and I told Diane, I says, \"Golly, that \u2014 that was kinda odd.\" \u2026 but the look on his face, Maureen.\n\nMaureen Maher: At that point, Rick, did you think this kid knows something, or maybe he had something to do with it?\n\nDiane Pacaccio: Yes.\n\nMaureen Maher: You believe, that was the moment \u2014 may have had something to do with her death?\n\nRick Pacaccio: Oh, there was no doubt about it \u2026 no doubt about it.\n\nThe Pacaccio's told authorities, but it was too late. Michael Gargiulo had disappeared.\n\nHOLLYWOOD DREAMS\n\nSoon after he left Chicago, Michael Gargiulo turned up in Los Angeles. Like a lot of other dreamers, he wanted to be an actor or a model.\n\nTemple Brown | Director: He was interested in getting into acting and\u2026 this was a good little project for him to, I guess, cut his teeth on a little bit.\n\nDirector Temple Brown was still in film school at USC when he cast Gargiulo as a boxer.\n\nTemple Brown: What struck me about him was that he actually had boxing experience.\n\nTemple Brown [watching movie on monitor]: \"I think he was perfect for that part \u2026 He \u2014 he looked it. And he performed it very well.\n\nMaureen Maher: He was cut like a boxer \u2026 he certainly had the physique of a boxer.\n\nAnthony DiLorenzo: He has some good punches to him, I \u2014 you know what I mean?\n\nTemer Leary: Yeah, he does \u2026 He does.\n\nMichael Gargiulo is seen in a screen test for the role of Rocco, a boxer, in then-USC Film School student Temple Brown's film \"Boxing's Been Good to Me.\"\n\nAnthony DiLorenzo and Temer Leary worked with Michael Gargiulo in the late 1990s around the same time he filmed the movie scene. They were all bouncers together at a Hollywood nightclub called the Rainbow Bar and Grill.\n\nMaureen Maher: What did he tell you he was doing out here?\n\nTemer Leary: Training to be a pro fighter\u2026\n\nAnthony DiLorenzo: Yeah \u2026 Acting and \u2026 modelling.\n\nMaureen Maher: Isn't everybody? [laughs]\n\nLeary and DiLorenzo: Right. Yup\n\nTemer Leary: He's doing the Hollywood thing.\n\nMaureen Maher: He's doing the Hollywood thing?\n\nAnthony DiLorenzo: Yeah, he sure is.\n\nMaureen Maher: Did he have a girlfriend at the time when you were all hanging out?\n\nAnthony DiLorenzo: Oh, yeah. He always had girlfriends.\n\nTemer Leary: He always had girls after him. He was a good-looking, clean-cut guy. You know, the waitresses were always after him.\n\nBut Gargiulo moved on from the nightclub and began working for a heating and cooling company.\n\nMaureen Maher: Who was the first among you to meet Michael Gargiulo?\n\nChris Duran: I was.\n\nChris Duran, Jennifer Desisto, and Justin Peterson spoke to \"48 Hours\" in 2010. They were the kind of good friends most young people would be attracted to.\n\nFor, Ashley Ellerin, center, life in Hollywood in 2001 was a whirlwind of work, friends and fun. \"She was just beautiful, and fun, and spontaneous,\" says friend Chris Duran. LAPD\n\nMaureen Maher: Really, the connection between this big group of friends was, kinda, partying, and having a great time. Very free-spirited lifestyle?\n\nJennifer Desisto: Yeah\n\nJustin Peterson: Right.\n\nMaureen Maher: You were young.\n\nJennifer Desisto: We were young.\n\nTheir introduction to Michael Gargiulo started with a flat tire.\n\nChris Duran: I'm changing my flat tire and this guy comes walking down the street \u2026 and he was good looking \u2026 and he stopped and offered to help me change the tire.\n\nAt the same time, 22-year-old Ashley Ellerin came out of the house she was renting on the street. Michael Gargiulo noticed.\n\nChris Duran: And Ashley was standing there with me, and \u2026 He was good looking and she was beautiful. \u2026 And I was like, \"No it's OK. I know how to change a tire.\" So, he stood there talking with Ashley. And they were, you know, talkin' and flirting. \u2026 they exchanged numbers, and that was our first meeting.\n\nMaureen Maher: Did you have any feeling about him, one way or the other?\n\nChris Duran: I mean, he was just, you know, a good-looking guy walking down the street offering to help.\n\nAshley Ellerin, the young woman Michael Gargiulo had immediately noticed, was a part-time fashion student.\n\nJustin Peterson: She was amazing \u2026 I mean, she just had this charisma to her \u2026 she could go into a room and just take complete control over the room.\n\nChris Duran: She was just beautiful, and \u2014 and fun and spontaneous.\n\nJustin Peterson: She had a lot of friends.\n\nJennifer Desisto: Ashley was a 22-year-old, you know, attractive girl living in the Hollywood Hills.\n\nMaureen Maher: And she liked to have fun?\n\nChris Duran: Absolutely \u2014\n\nJustin Peterson: She liked to have fun \u2014\n\nChris Duran: \u2014 we all did.\n\nJustin Peterson: \u2014we had a lot of fun.\n\nThe guy they only knew as \"Mike\" kept trying to spend time with Ashley.\n\nJustin Peterson: He called the house a lot after their run-in.\n\nHe called and had begun just showing up uninvited. The friends say one night he walked into the house during a party, sat down and was laser focused on Ashley. But Ashley was not interested. Back then, lots of men were interested in her.\n\nJennifer Desisto: Hollywood is Hollywood. \u2026 interacting with celebrities \u2026 that is how it is. I mean they live here.\n\nOne celebrity in particular had started calling Ashley. It was a then-up-and-coming TV actor from \"That '70s Show,\" Ashton Kutcher.\n\nJustin Peterson: We had hung out with him a couple of times.\n\nMaureen Maher: Let's go back to the night that Ashley was supposed to go out with Ashton Kutcher.\n\nChris Duran: I know that they were gonna be hanging out.\n\nThe next morning, Ashley's roommate Jennifer came home.\n\nJennifer Desisto: I entered the house and \u2026 Ashley was laying there across the two stairs \u2026 covered in blood.\n\nNEWS REPORT: The body of 22-year old Ashley Lauren Ellerin was found by her roommate early Thursday morning \u2026\n\nJennifer Desisto \u2026 and that's when I realized, that \"No,\" you know? \"This is not happening\" \u2026 \"Who could have done this?\"\n\nASHLEY ELLERIN | HOLLYWOOD, 2001\n\nWhen Jennifer Desisto got home that morning in 2001, she walked into a gruesome and terrifying scene\n\nJennifer Desisto: At that point \u2014 was just \u2014 like a sense of trauma just came over me. I thought maybe the person was still there, and I, kind of ran out, hysterical. I dropped that phone and ended up getting to the car\u2026 and calling from my cellphone, 911.\n\nCS News/LAPD\n\nAshley Ellerin had been attacked just after taking a shower. Stabbed 47 times, her body was lying just outside the bathroom.\n\nMaureen Maher: Had you ever seen anything like that before in your life?\n\nJennifer Desisto: I \u2014 I absolutely had not, and \u2026 it still traumatizes me to this day.\n\nPolice arrived quickly and started asking questions.\n\nJennifer Desisto: Who could \u2014 who could have done this?\n\nMaureen Maher: That must have been one of the first questions that police asked you, though, was \u2026 did she have any enemies?\n\nJennifer Desisto: Yes. Did she have any\u2026? Right, right.\n\nMaureen Maher: It sounds like such a trite question. But you would think that, based on what you saw, only someone who hated another person would do that.\n\nJennifer Desisto: Right. Absolutely. Yeah. And \u2014 in \u2014 also, it was a given from the get-go that it was obviously someone she was either familiar with, or knew to let them in. 'Cause as we had said, the \u2014 the house was, kind of, double gated.\n\nMaureen Maher: You believe that Ashley let him in?\n\nJustin Peterson: Oh, yeah.\n\nJennifer Desisto: Yes.\n\nDet. Tom Small: OK, this is \u2026 Pinehurst Road, and this is Ashley Ellerin's former residence.\n\nHollywood homicide Detective Tom Small says there was little to go on.\n\nMaureen Maher: \u2026 no blood spatter outside, no pieces of clothing, no other\u2014 no material that would lead you to one particular individual?\n\nDet. Tom Small: No \u2026 We had teams of detectives searching the interior and the exterior. We walked the streets. We canvassed every building, door knocked every house.\n\nMaureen Maher: Were you kind of baffled initially?\n\nDet. Tom Small: Very much so. You know, we were just looking for any type of direction or clues that would \u2013 to lead to a suspect. So, we had to start with the victim and worked backwards to find her associations.\n\nThey definitely wanted to talk to the person she was supposed be on a date with that night \u2014 actor Ashton Kutcher.\n\nMaureen Maher: And what role has he played in this as a witness in any way?\n\nDet. Tom Small: He is a person in a group of Ashley's friends. He's one of many \u2026 and he was a friend of hers.\n\nKutcher and Ellerin had plans to go to dinner, but he was running late and kept pushing back his arrival. Kutcher told detectives that at 8:24 p.m., he spoke with Ashley, who told him she'd just gotten out of the shower.\n\nKutcher didn't actually arrive at her front door until around 10:45 p.m., at which point, he says, he was confused because the lights were on, but no one answered. Just as he was about to leave, he glanced through a window and noticed what he thought was red wine spilled on the floor. It turns out, it wasn't wine. It was blood.\n\nDet. Tom Small: It just was a very bad scene. \u2026 A lot of anger. A lot of rage. Somebody had isolated Ashley Ellerin to \u2014 to kill her and was very, very angry when he did it.\n\nMaureen Maher: Could anyone think of someone who wanted to hurt Ashley?\n\nDet. Tom Small: Not really \u2026 Almost to a person, Ashley was considered to be, you know, like the life of the party. \u2026 she had a lot of friends from different walks of life. \u2026 friends from school, her roommates \u2026 celebrity-type folks.\n\nKutcher wasn't the only man police were interested in talking to. Mark Durbin, a not-so-famous actor, was also Ellerin's property manager. Durbin and Ashley were secretly having a relationship. And, he and Ashley had been intimate earlier that evening. But, like Kutcher, he had fully cooperated with investigators and both men were ruled out as possible suspects.\n\nWhile police had no concrete leads, Ashley's friends couldn't shake the feeling that the guy who seemed fixated on Ashley was involved.\n\nMaureen Maher: In your initial conversation with police, did you mention Michael Gargiulo to them?\n\nChris Duran: Yes. The \u2014 I didn't know his name, but the heating and air conditioner guy \u2014\n\nMaureen Maher: And, did they pay any attention to that?\n\nChris Duran: I know they took note. I don't think they took it very seriously. Or that much of a threat.\n\nDet. Tom Small: He was not in their circle of friends. \u2026 they were creeped out by him \u2026\n\nMaureen Maher: So, when you hear that \u2026 does it strike a chord with you?\n\nDet. Tom Small: Well, I mean, it takes a little bit more than that to get focused on somebody as a suspect in a case like this.\n\nGargiulo wasn't really on Detective Small's radar. Ashley had a large social circle, there were hundreds of people to talk to and he was just the creepy air conditioner guy. It would take months for police to learn his last name and put him on their list.\n\nDet. Tom Small: It weighed really heavy, on me personally this particular case. because everybody has the case, and this one was mine. My frustration was why can't I get the evidence I need to solve Ashley's murder.\n\nBack in Cook County, just outside Chicago, Tricia Paccacio's murder was unsolved for nearly 10 years. Her mother Diane was relentless, hounding investigators.\n\nDiane Pacaccio: At least once or twice a week.\n\nMaureen Maher: And did you feel like anything was being done in that time?\n\nDiane Pacaccio: No, but I kept thinking, maybe I just keep goin' and talking to them and keep telling them every little thing that came to mind. It was just\u2014\n\nRick Pacaccio: And it did help some of them.\n\nDiane Pacaccio: \u2014it was\u2014 it was\u2014 it helped me probably emotionally, because it was almost like I could talk to them. They knew what had happened.\n\nRick Pacaccio: I have the tenacity to keep goin' \u2026 until it does happen.\n\nMaureen Maher: You're not gonna give up?\n\nRick Pacaccio: I'm not gonna give up, no. My daughter is gonna get the representation that she deserves.\n\nCook County Sheriff's Detective Lou Sala was assigned to the case in 1999.\n\nDet. Lou Sala: We had the benefit of technology \u2026 when we took the case over.\n\nBy 2002, new DNA technology allowed investigators to take a fresh look at the evidence collected from the crime scene.\n\nDet. Lou Sala: We were hoping to establish some type of DNA profile \u2014 to give us an idea of a possible offender.\n\nMaureen Maher: So \u2026 what's the first big test result you get back, the first new piece of information from this round of DNA testing?\n\nDet. Lou Sala: Well, the biggest thing is when we \u2026 got the unknown male contributor from the fingernails.\n\nMale DNA found on Tricia's fingernails. Now, they had to match it.\n\nDet. Lou Sala: At that point, we began a\u2026 DNA \u2026 campaign of everybody \u2026 Including the Pacaccio family \u2026 friends of hers that with her at the road rally that night. \u2026 We even tested the dog.\n\nMaureen Maher: You even tested the dog?\n\nDet. Lou Sala: Yeah.\n\nDetectives wanted samples from anyone they had talked to back in the day, and Michael Gargiulo was on their list. Detectives heard Gargiulo was now living in Los Angeles, so they went to the LAPD for help.\n\nDet. Tom Small: I had no knowledge they were even coming\u2026 We had just recently identified who Gargiulo was and were conducting our investigation.\n\nBy now, Detective Small had begun to take a closer look at Michael Gargiulo.\n\nDet. Tom Small: All of a sudden, we get a phone call \u2026 Cook County's in town. \u2026 he says, \"Well, who is it you looking for?\" And they named Michael Gargiulo.\n\nMaureen Maher: You said, \"Hey, that's \u2014 that's my guy.\"\n\nDet. Tom Small: They showed up. \u2026 I held up a photo. I said, \"Is this who you're lookin' for?\" And they said, \"Yeah. How do you know him?\" I said, \"Well, right now he's a potential suspect in \u2014 in a murder investigation. What do you guys have?\"\n\nDetective Small agreed to help Cook County find Gargiulo and collect A DNA sample.\n\nMARIA BRUNO | EL MONTE, CALIF., 2005\n\nIn 2002, almost 10 years after Tricia Pacaccio's murder, the LAPD caught up with Michael Gargiulo.\n\nDet. Tom Small: We obtained Mr. Gargiulo's DNA sample. And I\u2014\n\nMaureen Maher: And he was cooperative with that?\n\nDet. Tom Small: Not really, but it \u2014 it got done.\n\nThe DNA sample was sent to the Illinois State Police Crime Lab. The results were stunning \u2014 a match. It was Michael Gargiulo's DNA on Tricia's fingernails. Case closed? Not exactly.\n\nMaureen Maher: Did you think it was enough to move forward?\n\nDet. Lou Sala | Cook County, Illinois: Well, I thought it was. But \u2014 I'm not the attorneys. \u2026 It was explained to me \u2026 and the explanation made sense at the time, that they \u2014 they just wanted some type of corroborating evidence.\n\nMaureen Maher: They needed something more than the DNA?\n\nDet. Lou Sala: Something more than that.\n\nBecause, they said, Michael Gargiulo's DNA might have gotten on Tricia in a way that had nothing to do with the murder.\n\nDet. Lou Sala: At the time, he was a friend of the family. You know, and you \u2014 one would have to wonder could it have gotten there by casual contact.\n\nMaureen Maher: And had there been casual contact in the hours before, or the day before they \u2014 that she was murdered?\n\nDet. Lou Sala: There was the day before.\n\nThe day before her murder, Gargiulo was driving with another friend, Scott Olson, when they saw Tricia.\n\nScott Olson: \u2026we drove past the Pacaccio's house, who do we see rounding the corner walking away from us? There's Tricia. \u2026 Mike's driving, and he kind of swerves over, slows down, swerves over. Gets right behind her \u2026 and we saw she was crying. So, she's like \"Hey, give me a ride.\" Like, \"Whoa. OK. Sure. Get in.\" So she gets in the car. She said take her to \u2013 take me to so-and-so's house \u2026 so we just \u2013 we just drove her. \u2026 we dropped her off, and that was it.\n\nWhen \"48 Hours\" spoke to Jack Blakey from the Cook County State's Attorney's Office in 2011, he confirmed that because of that ride, and because Gargiulo had spent time at the family home, he can't be sure if Gargiulo's DNA on Tricia was from the attack.\n\nJack Blakey: The evidence just hasn't been there. I wish we could bring closure to her family tomorrow.\n\nSo, with nothing else tying him to Tricia Pacaccio's or Ashley Ellerin's death, Gargiulo was only a guy who had the bad luck of knowing two different women who had been murdered in exactly the same way. Gargiulo left Hollywood and continued doing what he always did, never staying in one place for too long.\n\nMaureen Maher: How come nobody keeps tabs on this guy?\n\nDet. Lou Sala: I don't know if they tried, but \u2026 my understanding was he kept kind of a low profile. I think he was on the radar.\n\nOver the next few years, Gargiulo had several girlfriends and even became a father. In 2005, he settled in suburban El Monte, 20 miles east of Hollywood. Then, just before Christmas that same year, in that same neighborhood, there was a murder. The victim was another attractive young woman.\n\nDet. Mark Lillienfeld: We're talking about a 90 pound, 32-year-old woman \u2026 who's defenseless, asleep in her bed in her home, where if there's any one place in the world she should feel most secure \u2026 That attack is every woman's nightmare.\n\nLos Angeles County Sheriff's Department Homicide Detective Mark Lillienfeld.\n\nDet. Mark Lillienfeld [at El Monte crime scene]: This is the building where the murder happened. Behind me is apartment number 20 is where Maria Bruno lived. \u2026 She had\u20142-year-old twins \u2026 and then I believe a 4-year-old and a 5-year-old.\n\nCBS News/LASD\n\nIn the months before her death, Maria and her husband had several violent fights, including one where her husband punched her in the face. She left him and found an apartment in a gated complex.\n\nDet. Mark Lillienfeld: She had picked that building specifically because it was very secure. \u2026 You had to either have a pass code or a key to get through the front door, so it was a pretty secure building.\n\nBut someone got past that security.\n\nDet. Mark Lillienfeld: The suspect entered \u2026 through the kitchen \u2026 It appears from the evidence that he obtained a weapon there in the kitchen.\n\nMaureen Maher: A knife?\n\nDet. Mark Lillienfeld: Correct. \u2026 Her body was somewhat mutilated. And you just, you know, that's \u2014 that's crap you see in the movies. In real life that \u2014 that is very rare. It just doesn't happen.\n\nThere was very little evidence left behind, except for one blue cotton bootie found in the courtyard outside Maria Bruno's apartment.\n\nDet. Mark Lillienfeld [at El Monte crime scene]: Just about where we're standing is where that blue cotton bootie was at.\n\nMaureen Maher: Right here?\n\nDet. Mark Lillienfeld: Yeah, right here. Right here. And it was kind of out of place. \u2026 Actually, on the sole of the bootie was a drop of blood. \u2026 And DNA testing, proved that, in fact, it was Maria's blood.\n\nPolice immediately took a hard look at Bruno's estranged husband. There was the history of a turbulent relationship and drops of Maria's blood were found in his car. But Maria's husband told police that earlier that evening, he and Maria had decided to rekindle their relationship. They went to a restaurant, where the manager confirmed Maria had cut her finger and was bleeding as they left. And like Pacaccio, then Ellerin, and now Bruno, another vicious murder eventually turned into a cold case.\n\nAs for Michael Gargiulo, his romantic life was once again in turmoil. He left his girlfriend and new baby in suburban L.A. and headed to the beach \u2014 Santa Monica. And once again, where Gargiulo went, an attack eventually followed.\n\nMICHELLE MURPHY | SANTA MONICA, 2008\n\nOn April 28, 2008, in Santa Monica, another break-in, another brutal assault. But this attack would change everything.\n\nSgt. Richard Lewis: I got the call at about 12:30 in the morning from my sergeant and asked me to come out \u2026 and respond to the scene of a stabbing or attempted murder.\n\nThen-Santa Monica Police Sergeant Richard Lewis.\n\nSgt. Richard Lewis [outside of apartment window]: He gained access into this window, which was open \u2014 a few inches.\n\nSgt. Richard Lewis: And once he got inside there, he then opens the front door and kind of stages it as an escape route. Proceeds into the bedroom\u2026 where she is sleeping, and \u2026 what awakes her is a knife being plunged into her.\n\nMaureen Maher: He just flat out stabbed her?\n\nSgt. Richard Lewis: Right. \u2026 She was stabbed multiple times \u2014 in her chest and shoulder and \u2014 and right arm. And \u2026 suffered several wounds to both of her hands as she's grabbing this knife as it's being plunged down upon her.\n\nThe victim was 26-year-old Michelle Murphy.\n\nMaureen Maher: What can you tell us about her?\n\nSgt. Richard Lewis: Just an incredible young lady. \u2026 And \u2014 just someone who's very resilient and decided to fight.\n\nCBS News/Santa Monica P.D.\n\nAs Murphy, all of 5'1\", was fighting for her life, the blade is slipping back and forth and somewhere in the struggle the attacker is also cut.\n\nSgt. Richard Lewis: And at some point, there was a lull in the action \u2026 and she was able to get her feet up underneath \u2026 and kick him off of her.\n\nThe attacker stumbles off the bed and out of the room. Bleeding profusely from her multiple stab wounds, Murphy runs after the hooded man down the hallway to the front door.\n\nMaureen Maher: Did he say anything to her ever?\n\nSgt. Richard Lewis: \"I'm sorry.\"\n\nMaureen Maher: He said, \"I'm sorry\"?\n\nSgt. Richard Lewis [nodding to affirm]: \"I'm sorry.\"\n\nThen, he ran out. Murphy immediately called her boyfriend who called 911:\n\nBOYFRIEND TO 911: She told me she woke up and someone was on top of her and she forced them off and they ran out... 911 OPERATOR: OK. We are on our way.\n\nThen, the police call Michelle Murphy:\n\nPOLICE: OK. What is your name? MICHELLE MURPHY: Michelle\u2026\n\nIt's very hard to hear her answers:\n\nPOLICE: The fire department is already on the way and we are on our way\u2026 What's this person look like? MICHELLE MURPHY: He was in pants and like a long sleeve-like sweatshirt kind of thing \u2026 Everything was dark \u2026 POLICE: Do you remember how big this guy was? How tall he was? MICHELLE MURPHY: He was at the most, I dunno, like 5' 11\" or something.\n\nMaureen Maher [outside of Murphy's apartment]: So, he comes out this door, and there's blood \u2014 on the steps right outside the front door?\n\nSgt. Richard Lewis: We have some blood on the steps.\n\nMaureen Maher: OK.\n\nSgt. Richard Lewis: And then blood on the concrete steps here, leading out\u2014 down this walkway, and into the alley.\n\nMaureen Maher [standing in the alley]: So, how significant, in your investigation and when you showed up that night, did you think that blood was gonna be?\n\nSgt. Richard Lewis: Huge. Huge.\n\nSgt. Richard Lewis: About 25 days after submitting my samples to the crime lab, I'm informed by a \u2026 criminalist that \u2026 we actually have a hit, a DNA hit.\n\nMaureen Maher: And who does it match?\n\nSgt. Richard Lewis: Michael Gargiulo.\n\nMaureen Maher: Conclusively?\n\nSgt. Richard Lewis: Yes.\n\nThey were able to make the match because, remember, Gargiulo's DNA had been collected for DNA testing in the Pacaccio case and was already on file. And guess where Gargiulo lived at the time of the attack?\n\nSgt. Richard Lewis [standing in the alley]: It'd be second building down. And the \u2014 first window would be just above that black trash can that you see on the left side.\n\n\n\nMaureen Maher: He could see right into her bedroom?\n\nSgt. Richard Lewis: If she were to have the blinds open, that'd be correct.\n\nMaureen Maher: That's pretty scary.\n\nSgt. Richard Lewis: Yes, absolutely.\n\nWithin 24 hours of making that DNA match, Gargiulo was arrested for the assault of Michelle Murphy.\n\nMichael Gargiulo at the time of his arrest in the summer of 2008. On Sept. 4, 2008, while already in jail charged with attempted murder for the attack on Michelle Murphy in Santa Monica, Gargiulo was indicted on two additional charges -- this time for the murders of Ashley Ellerin and Maria Bruno. On July 7, 2011, Gargiulo was indicted for the 1999 murder of Tricia Pacaccio in his hometown of Glenview, Illinois. Los Angeles County Sheriff's Dept.\n\nSgt. Richard Lewis: He was taken into custody.\n\nMaureen Maher: And what was his response?\n\nSgt. Richard Lewis: His response \u2026 was \"which agency is this?\"\n\nMaureen Maher: What did that say to you?\n\nSgt. Richard Lewis: That tells me a lot. It tells me that he wasn't sure which crime he was getting charged for.\n\nMaureen Maher: That means there's more than one out there?\n\nSgt. Richard Lewis: To me that's what that meant. Yes.\n\nSergeant Lewis was reminded of a conversation he'd once had with Det. Lillienfeld about a similar murder that had happened three years earlier in El Monte, just outside of Los Angeles.\n\nDet. Mark Lillienfeld: I got a call from Sgt. Richard Lewis from the Santa Monica Police Department. \u2026 he had a case that was very similar \u2026 luckily his victim survived\u2026 and he had identified a suspect.\n\nAnd, it turns out, Gargiulo once lived close enough to Maria Bruno to also watch her. She reported to friends run-ins with the \"strange guy across the way.\"\n\nMaureen Maher: This was her apartment. Where was Gargiulo's located?\n\nDet. Mark Lillienfeld: If you turn around and look, it's right over your shoulder. It's apartment 34.\n\nMaureen Maher: So that is \u2014 up just behind that tree? Correct?\n\nDet. Mark Lillienfeld: Correct. Just to right of that tree \u2026 so you've got a clear view, obviously from his apartment.\n\nNow, the pieces of the puzzle were finally starting to come together. Determined investigators had discovered more evidence. Remember that blue bootie found near Maria Bruno's front door? In Gargiulo's old apartment just across the way \u2026\n\nDet. Mark Lillienfeld: And sure enough, in the attic of the apartment, we wound up finding a matching bootie, a blue cotton bootie, just like the same one we found at the crime scene \u2026 the same manufacture, same make, same model of bootie.\n\nAnd, in the 2001 murder of Ashley Ellerin, Gargiulo lived only a couple of blocks away from her, too. And, he was frequently seen hanging out with his dog at this park directly across the street from Ashley's home.\n\nWithin a month, Michael Gargiulo was also charged with the murders of Ashley Ellerin and Maria Bruno.\n\nIn Chicago, when Tricia Pacaccio's family heard that Michael Gargiulo had been arrested in L.A., they were certain he would soon be charged with Tricia's murder; but nothing happened.\n\nThen, in 2011, \"48 Hours\" ran our first show, \"The Boy Next Door,\" on the so-called Hollywood Ripper and the unsolved murder of Tricia Pacaccio. Almost immediately after the show aired, a witness reached out to correspondent Maureen Maher.\n\nTemer Leary: I watched the show. \u2026 and it was a mug shot of Mike.\n\nTemer Leary was one of Michael Gargiulo's bouncer buddies from Hollywood.\n\nMaureen Maher: And did you reach out to Anthony?\n\nTemer Leary: I did. I did. I sent him a text. \u2026 \"Did you know Mike's a \u2014 a serial killer?\"\n\nTurns out both Leary and Anthony DiLorenzo had led checkered lives of their own \u2014 in and out of jail. But both men were now fathers and seeing Tricia Pacaccio's father on \"48 Hours\" moved them.\n\n\"I tried to revive her. That is the worst feeling in your life, when you can't do nothing for somebody you love,\" an emotional Rick Pacaccio told \"48 Hours\" in a 2010 interview. CBS News\n\nTemer Leary: I get emotional because I \u2014 I love my children. And, when \u2014 when I look at him and I see that video and see to this day, I get a pain in my chest that any man would have to miss and love their child like that.\n\nMaureen Maher: So, you're watching it and we're telling the story, and you have \u2013\n\nTemer Leary: I already know.\n\nMaureen Maher: You already know. You have pieces of the puzzle that we don't even know exist \u2026\n\nTemer Leary: Yeah. \u2026 I said, \"I have \u2014 I have to let somebody know what I know \u2026\"\n\nHere's what Leary and DiLorenzo knew: they said back in 2000 when they were working together, Michael Gargiulo told them he had murdered a girl in Chicago.\n\nAnthony DiLorenzo: We were cruising down Sunset \u2026 he asked us, w\u2014 he's, like, \"You guys ever kill anybody?\" And \u2026 He's, like, \"I have.\" And we're \u2014 we're, like, \"Shut the \u2014 you know, shut up.\"\n\nTemer Leary [laughs]: Here we go again.\n\nAnthony DiLorenzo: He said he buried this \u2014 he goes \u2014 he goes, \"Yeah, I buried a bitch.\" \u2026 He goes \"I left the bitch on the steps for dead.\"\n\n\"48 Hours\" put them in touch with Chicago authorities and soon Michael Gargiulo was indicted for the murder of Tricia Pacaccio \u2014 18 years after her death.\n\nANITA ALVAREZ | THEN-COOK COUNTY STATE'S ATTORNEY [to reporters on July 7, 2011]: \u2026 this new evidence that has just come forward after the \"48 Hour\" (sic) episode, really coupled with the DNA, we feel at this point that we have sufficient evidence.\n\nExtra: Cook County charges Gargiulo\n\nBut the Pacaccio's search for justice was just beginning. There was a long road ahead full of unexpected twists and turns.\n\nMICHAEL GARGIULO [recorded jail conversation]: \"My truth is being 100 percent innocent, being wrongfully charged \u2026 all I can do is be calm and fight for my innocence.\"\n\nTHE HOLLYWOOD RIPPER ON TRIAL\n\nMary Fulginiti | Former federal prosecutor and \"48 Hours\" consultant: This is not a typical murder case. This is the systematic slaughtering of beautiful women by a serial killer.\n\nFour young women \u2014 only one survivor.\n\nMary Fulginiti: The Hollywood Ripper is one of the most horrible cases I've ever seen.\n\nMary Fulginiti: This is a man who spied on them, who stalked them, and then brutally stabbed them to death \u2026 And that's defendant Michael Gargiulo.\n\nMaureen Maher: What was your reaction when you got a phone call that a witness had come forward to \"48 Hours\"?\n\nDet. Lou Sala: I was shocked. I \u2014\n\nMaureen Maher: Would you imagine that a television show would be able to help you solve a crime?\n\nDet. Lou Sala: No \u2026 but it's never happened to me.\n\nMary Fulginiti: Frankly, it's\u2014 almost a miracle that these cases were linked together\n\n\n\nMary Fulginiti: You say to yourself, \"Who could do this?\" \u2026 You think, \"Oh, my God. It's a monster.\"\n\nIn a town known for keeping secrets, the murder trial of Michael Gargiulo, nicknamed the Hollywood Ripper, could reveal a hidden life.\n\nProsecutor Dan Akemon [in court]: Tricia Pacaccio, Ashley Ellerin, Michelle Murphy, and Maria Bruno were all young, attractive, and outgoing.\n\nOn May 2, 2019, the case against Michael Gargiulo begins. Prosecutors say that he murdered three women and attempted to murder a fourth.\n\nMary Fulginiti: He staked them out.\n\nMary Fulginiti: He stalked them. And then he stabbed them brutally.\n\nProsecutor Dan Akemon says Michael Gargiulo is a serial killer \u2014 attacking four women, just for the thrill of it, from 1993 through his arrest in 2008.\n\nProsecutor Dan Akemon [in court]: What you will hear is that Michael Gargiulo, for almost 15 years, was watching, always watching. And his hobby was plotting the perfect opportunity to attack women with a knife in and around their homes.\n\nDuring those years, Gargiulo played high school football, boxed, was a wannabe actor and a repairman.\n\nIt has taken Gargiulo longer to go to trial than any other inmate in the history of the L.A. County Jail \u2014 nearly 11 years. There have been nearly 100 hearings, he's fired attorneys and even tried to represent himself. But now, with a new high-powered, court-appointed legal team, the wait is over. The prosecution starts with its strongest case and most powerful witness.\n\nMichael Gargiulo appears in court for opening statements in his murder trial on May 2, 2019 in Los Angeles. Pool/Getty Images\n\nProsecutor Dan Akemon [in court]: Michelle Murphy \u2014 in 2008 was stabbed in her bed in her Santa Monica apartment right across the alley from Gargiulo's apartment.\n\nAfter showing photos from her brutal attack, Michelle Murphy, the only woman who survived this alleged serial killer, is called to the stand.\n\nThere were no cameras allowed in court during Murphy's testimony, but \"48 Hours\" wanted to share some of what was said. Her exact chilling words: \"I grabbed at the knife. I wrapped my hands around the blade\u2026.\" And at some point, the 5'1\" Murphy gets her legs up against her chest and shoves the attacker off the bed. She describes how he runs out of the room down the hallway. She goes after him and Murphy says the attacker told her \"I am sorry.\"\n\nMichelle Murphy never saw his face, but noticed he was left-handed. In the struggle, the attacker was also cut, leaving his blood \u2014 his DNA \u2014 all over her bedroom.\n\nProsecutor Dan Akemon [in court]: Gargiulo's blood and DNA were found on Michelle's bedspread and sheet and in the blood trail across the alley.\n\nAfter Murphy testified, the prosecution turned to the other victims to prove Gargiulo's pattern of stalking and stabbing. Three years before Murphy's attack, Maria Bruno, a mother of four young children, was stabbed 17 times.\n\nProsecutor Dan Akemon [in court]: Maria Bruno was stabbed to death in her El Monte residence.\n\nMaria Bruno's body was discovered by her estranged husband Irving, who called 911:\n\nIRVING BRUNO TO 911: There was a pool of blood. IRVING BRUNO TO 911 [crying]: I'm looking at her right now. She's dead. \u2026 She just barely moved here about less than \u2014 less than a week ago.\n\nGargiulo lived right across the way.\n\nProsecutor Dan Akemon [in court]: Gargiulo entered Maria's apartment through a window, put on blue surgical booties, and mutilated Maria with a knife as she slept.\n\nThe prosecution argues that the pattern and direction of the blood drops show that the killer was left-handed, just like Murphy's attacker, and just like Michael Gargiulo. And this time, the killer left something behind: a blue bootie with critical evidence.\n\nProsecutor Dan Akemon [in court]: Detectives located a blue surgical bootie right outside of Maria's front door. \u2026 Forensic analysis \u2026 showed that there were drops of Maria's blood on the bootie and Gargiulo's DNA was around the elastic band.\n\nFour years before Maria Bruno, there was Ashley Ellerin, a 22-year-old fashion student in Hollywood.\n\nProsecutor Dan Akemon [in court]: Gargiulo, who lived within a short distance from Ashley's house and frequented the dog park across from her house, injected himself into Ashley's life.\n\nProsecutor Dan Akemon [in court]: On February 21, 2001, within weeks of Gargiulo fixating on Ashley \u2026 surveilling her home at odd hours \u2026 Ashley Ellerin was found stabbed to death in the hallway just outside her bathroom. Ashley had been stabbed over 47 times.\n\nAs the state lays out its explanation of how Ellerin was murdered, an important witness is about to have Hollywood's eyes upon him.\n\nProsecutor Dan Akemon [in court]: This is Mr. Kutcher. He's Ashley's friend.\n\nAshton Kutcher is used to being a star, but not a star witness.\n\nProsecutor Dan Akemon [in court]: Mr. Kutcher is part of the chronology of this case that is offered to show you that there was a \u2026 very narrow window of opportunity for somebody to get into the house and murder Ashley.\n\nMaureen Maher: Why is Kutcher called as a witness?\n\nMary Fulginiti | Former federal prosecutor: He's incredibly important to the timeline here, and when the murder possibly occurred. \u2026 and he may have been the last person to actually speak to her before she was killed.\n\nKutcher is asked about his planned date with Ashley Ellerin on February 21, 2001, the evening she was murdered.\n\nProsecutor Dan Akemon [in court]: At 8:24 p.m., Ashley talked to Mr. Kutcher on the phone and they confirmed a plan to go out that night,\n\nAshton Kutcher was running late, so he called Ashley again at 10:15 p.m. to let her know he was on the way. But Ashley didn't pick up. He then drove to her home, knocked on the door but still, got no answer.\n\nAshton Kutcher testifies in the murder trial of Michael Gargiulo in Los Angeles Superior Court on May 29, 2019. Frederick M. Brown/Pool Photo via AP\n\nProsecutor Dan Akemon [in court]: He will testify that at 10:45 p.m., he arrived at the residence \u2026 and saw what he thought was spilled wine on the floor. We believe now the evidence will show that was actually blood. And Ashley had already been murdered.\n\nA diagram of Ellerin's home is shown in the courtroom.\n\nProsecutor Dan Akemon [in court]: That's her bathroom, where we believe\u2014 she had just exited the shower and was getting ready to go out with Mr. Kutcher when she was attacked from behind. And then there was a struggle \u2026 in the \u2026 area right outside the bathroom where she was stabbed 47 times.\n\nKutcher testified that after learning about Ashley's murder, he \"went to the police, I was like, my fingerprints are on this door. Like I was freaking out.\"\n\nAlthough never a suspect, Kutcher was concerned about what he left behind. That's unlike Michael Gargiulo, who was always careful to cover his tracks.\n\nWHAT MADE GARGIULO TICK?\n\nProsecutor Dan Akemon [in court]: The methodical and systematic slaughter of women \u2026 that's what this case is about.\n\nThe prosecution painted a portrait of Michael Gargiulo throughout his life. He was violent towards women, interested in serial killer Ted Bundy, and studied forensic science.\n\n\"Mike was a strange guy,\" says Mirko Hoffman, a man who now describes himself as Gargiulo's former best friend.\n\nProsecutor Garrett Dameron [in court]: \u2026 told Mirko he could get away with committing crimes because he studied forensics.\n\nMirko Hoffman: He would go online, whatever he could find about forensics.\n\nMirko Hoffman: He would learn from people's mistakes \u2026 other criminals' mistakes \u2026 you know how to get away with a crime \u2026 And he told me if he ever got caught committing any crime, he would just lie until he dies. Lie, lie, until you die.\n\nProsecutor Garrett Dameron [in court]: Michael Gargiulo felt confident, arrogant, dare I say invulnerable\u2026\n\nProsecutors said Gargiulo also studied a book that taught you how to kill with a knife.\n\nProsecutor Garrett Dameron [in court]: \"The Anarchist Cookbook\" talks about knives \u2026 the perfect guide to committing some of these crimes. Detailing how you go for the throat.\n\nProsecutor Dan Akemon [in court]: We believe the evidence will show that this is what Mr. Gargiulo was doing.\n\nAs for Gargiulo's motive, prosecutors described a serial killer with a sexual bent.\n\nProsecutor Garrett Dameron [in court]: This was somebody who was going to take pleasure in plunging a knife into their victim over and over and over again.\n\nTo better understand that, \"48 Hours\" asked Kris Mohandie to explain. He's a forensic psychologist and expert on serial killers. He is also a consultant to \"48 Hours.\"\n\nKris Mohandie: Most serial killers are motivated by power \u2026 that's at the core of everything \u2026\n\nInside the mind of the Hollywood Ripper\n\nThe prosecution points out that Gargiulo never raped his victims, but he controlled them, and say for Michael Gargiulo, that control itself is a sexual thrill.\n\nKris Mohandie: \u2026 It's control over life and death \u2026 So, violence has become sexualized.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Gargiulo went after women he found attractive.\n\nProsecutor Garrett Dameron [in court]: Michael Gargiulo noticed Michelle Murphy, Michael Gargiulo noticed Ashley Ellerin \u2026 Michael Gargiulo noticed Maria Bruno.\n\nAnd he stalked them.\n\nProsecutor Dan Akemon [in court]: He watched and waited and collected real-time intelligence on the victims.\n\nProsecutors say the spying was all part of his power game and his pattern.\n\nKris Mohandie: You've got all this stalking, this watching, surveilling, and fantasizing going on \u2026 and the person is doing this repeatedly to try to satisfy their urges. At some point for some of these individuals it's not enough just to think about it anymore, and they have to move to the next step. They actually have to kill in order to get the same degree of stimulation.\n\nTo really make their point, prosecutors took the jury out of court to see where everything happened.\n\nMary Fulginiti: Bringing the jury to the crime scene is incredibly impactful for them. This brings the case to life. \u2026 they actually get to see where \u2026 the victim lived, where the defendant lived, how close in proximity it was, see the crime scene.\n\nJurors saw that Michael Gargiulo lived close to all of his victims \u2014 close enough to watch them.\n\nTo start with, Gargiulo lived right down the alley from Michelle Murphy.\n\nA few years earlier, he lived within a few hundred feet of Ashley Ellerin. And when he lived in El Monte, his apartment was just across the courtyard from Maria Bruno.\n\nTo strengthen their argument and really show how Gargiulo had a clear pattern, they also told jurors about a murder more than 1,800 miles away.\n\nProsecutor Dan Akemon [in court]: You will hear that Gargiulo's killing spree started in Chicago in the summer of 1993, almost 26 years ago, when Gargiulo killed his first victim, his neighbor, then 18-year-old Tricia Pacaccio.\n\nWhile Gargiulo is not being tried for Tricia Pacaccio's murder in L.A., prosecutors thought it was essential to tell the jury what happened all those years ago outside Chicago.\n\nMary Fulginiti: Well, it's introduced here for a very limited purpose \u2026 to show that the facts and the pattern in the Pacaccio case in Illinois are similar to the California cases.\n\nIt was 1993. Tricia Pacaccio was just 18 years old, coming home late one night in the Chicago suburbs.\n\nProsecutor Dan Akemon [in court]: Gargiulo, who was athletic and had trained in martial arts and boxing, grabbed Tricia, who was very petite, snapped her arm, and stabbed her repeatedly in the left breast, arm and chest \u2026 left her bleeding to death on the doorstep of the family home, and fled.\n\nRick Pacaccio | Tricia's father: I was the one who found her... I woke up and I had a cup of coffee and I was going out to my van. And I just happened to see two little tennis shoes sticking up by the side door and when it saw it was her. I dropped the coffee cup.\n\nRick Pacaccio: I died right then and there.\n\nAt the time, Michael Gargiulo was a 17-year-old kid living around the corner. He was one of Tricia's brother's closest friends.\n\nWhen the murder happened, Gargiulo wasn't even a suspect. And the case went cold for years. By 2003, there was new DNA technology.\n\nProsecutor Dan Akemon [in court]: Eventually, Gargiulo's DNA was found on Tricia's fingernails.\n\nBack then, prosecutors in Chicago did not think that DNA alone was enough to charge him, and the case stayed dormant.\n\nIn 2011, \"48 Hours\" reported on the case and a witness came forward to Maureen Maher.\n\nTemer Leary: I watched the show.\n\nTemer Leary and Anthony DiLorenzo had once worked with Michael Gargiulo as bouncers in the late '90s at a Hollywood nightclub. They say Michael Gargiulo confessed to them one day when they were driving. Telling them that he had killed a girl in Illinois. At the time it seemed too crazy to be true. Gargiulo had told them a lot of stories.\n\nTemer Leary, left, with Anthony DiLorenzo, contacted \"48 Hours\" with information on the unsolved Tricia Pacccio murder in Chicago after watching Maureen Maher's report on the case in 2011. CBS News\n\nAnthony DiLorenzo: He said he buried this \u2014 he goes \u2014 he goes, \"Yeah, I buried a bitch.\" \u2026 He goes \"I left the bitch on the steps for dead.\"\n\n\"48 Hours\" put them in touch with Chicago authorities and shortly after, Gargiulo was charged with the murder of Tricia Pacaccio \u2014 18 years after her death. Now they are key witnesses at Gargiulo's Los Angeles trial.\n\nProsecutor Dan Akemon [in court]: In 1997, Gargiulo told his friend, Temer Leary, quote \u2014 \"I stabbed up the girl\" \u2013 end quote. \u2026 Also, in 1997, Mr. Gargiulo told his friend Anthony DiLorenzo, \"I actually left the bitch on the step for dead.\"\n\nMaureen Maher: They asked you to identify Gargiulo in the room. Did you make eye contact with Mike?\n\nAnthony DiLorenzo: I did, absolutely. He did not want to look at me. \u2026 He knew every word that came outta my mouth was true. And there was just no doubt about it.\n\nEach of the Pacaccio family members were called to testify, retelling the awful details of finding Tricia on the doorstep of their home. They also described their relationship with her alleged killer.\n\nMaureen Maher: What was it like for you to be in the room with him?\n\nTommy Pacaccio | Tricia's brother: Oh, it's \u2014 it's \u2014 in the room, it's very \u2014 very hard. \u2026 It's difficult. I mean, it never\u2014 something like that never goes away.\n\nThe Pacaccios can only hope that this trial will bring justice for Ashley Ellerin, Maria Bruno and Michelle Murphy, but the defense has another take. They point the finger in a different direction and away from Michael Gargiulo.\n\nRAISING DOUBT\n\nMary Fulginiti They just have to poke holes. They've gotta raise any doubt. They're gonna throw everything at it, the kitchen sink, and they're gonna hope that some of that will resonate, and it'll raise just\u2014 a seed, a kernel of doubt in one of those jurors. And that's all they need.\n\nThat's something accused serial killer Michael Gargiulo knows:\n\nMICHAEL GARGIULO [recorded jail conversation]: My truth is being 100 percent innocent, being wrongfully charged.\n\nIn recorded jail conversations with \"48 Hours\" between 2009 and 2011, Gargiulo maintained his innocence and a desire to fight the charges:\n\nMICHAEL GARGIULO [recorded jail conversation]: \u2026 it's a matter of waiting and knowing that there will be victory, because I know I'm innocent, and \u2014 it's just now, putting it down. Putting it down in the courtroom, and just being patient.\n\nIn the courtroom, his defense attorney Daniel Nardoni has a plan: argue someone else besides his client could have killed these women. He starts with the Ashley Ellerin case.\n\nDaniel Nardoni [in court]: There's not one single witness called by the prosecution \u2026 that saw Michael Gargiulo go into the house.\n\nMary Fulginiti: In the Ellerin case, despite all the efforts they put into scouring that \u2014 that crime scene, they came up with zero. Zero DNA, zero \u2026 physical evidence linking him, zero trace evidence, no eyewitnesses, no fingerprints. Really, they had nothing.\n\nNardoni focuses on the prosecution's celebrity witness Ashton Kutcher. To everyone's surprise, he says Kutcher is really the defense team's \"star witness\" because Kutcher's account of that evening points to a very specific suspect and it's not Michael Gargiulo. Instead, it's the manager of Ellerin's rented house \u2014 aspiring actor Mark Durbin.\n\nDaniel Nardoni [in court]: I think there's suspicion that Mr. Durbin did this murder.\n\nMark Durbin testified he was actually having an affair with Ashley and admits they were intimate that very evening \u2014 just hours before Kutcher arrived. The defense argues that at the time of her murder, Durbin was at Ashley's house. Their proof? Ashton Kutcher's cellphone records.\n\nMary Fulginiti: Ashton Kutcher calls her at 8:24 p.m. ,we know. There's a phone record.\n\nDaniel Nardoni [in court]: He calls her at 8:24 p.m. \u2026 Miss Ellerin stated \"I just got out of the shower.\"\n\nMary Fulginiti: Mark Durbin testifies that he was there when she was taking a shower.\n\nAnd while he was there, he says Ellerin got a phone call, then he left. Nardoni insists it must have been Kutcher's call at 8:24 p.m. And that is critical, because a neighbor testifies that around 8:25 or 8:30 p.m. he heard something.\n\nMary Fulginiti: He hears horrible screaming coming from Ashley's home.\n\nDaniel Nardoni [in court]: He hears two screams from a woman.\n\nMary Fulginiti: That puts Mark Durbin possibly right in the thick of it at the time of the murder.\n\nDaniel Nardoni [in court]: Mark Durbin was the only person known to have been with Ashley Ellerin \u2014 the last person while she was still alive.\n\nBut Los Angeles detectives cleared Durbin. He was cooperative and they didn't believe he had a motive. Still, Nardoni may have succeeded in raising some doubt with the jury.\n\nMaureen Maher: The defense makes a very big deal about Mark Durbin.\n\nMary Fulginiti: They did a pretty good job, I thought.\n\nAnd with that, the defense was on to the other case where they saw an opportunity: the killing of Maria Bruno \u2014 same argument, thin evidence.\n\nDaniel Nardoni [in court]: Not a one single person saw Mr. Gargiulo leaving the house.\n\nBut there was that blue bootie with a drop of Maria Bruno's blood on it and Gargiulo's DNA on the elastic band. Nardoni reminds the jury Gargiulo, who lived across the courtyard, was a repair man.\n\nDaniel Nardoni [in court]: We all know that Michael used booties all the time.\n\nHe says the bootie probably dropped out of Gargiulo's pocket as he was returning from work and picked up a drop of Maria's blood that was already on the sidewalk.\n\nMaria Bruno's body had been mutilated, and again, Nardoni offered up an alternate suspect. He pointed the finger at Maria's estranged husband, Irving.\n\nDaniel Nardoni [in court]: The person that did this \u2026 what's it tell you? [making a stabbing motion] \"I hate you, I hate you. I hate you!\" Whoever did this made it personal.\n\nNardoni paints a picture of a fractured marriage and details a previous fight between the two.\n\nDaniel Nardoni [in court]: Irving Bruno grabbed his wife out of the car, threw her to the ground, and with a closed fist, punched her in the face.\n\nMary Fulginiti: He's got a terrible history of physically abusing her that came out. She said she was scared of him.\n\nIn fact, Maria Bruno had recently left him, but Irving told the police that on that night she was killed, he and Maria had rekindled their relationship.\n\nDaniel Nardoni [in court]: Irving Bruno was the last person with Maria Bruno while she was still alive.\n\nThat night, he told police they went out to a restaurant together, returned to her place, were intimate and then he left. A neighbor says she heard crying at around 1:30 a.m.\n\nDaniel Nardoni [in court]: And who's down there at 1:30 in the morning? You know who. Irving Bruno.\n\nAnd police did find drops of Maria's blood in Irving's car.\n\nDaniel Nardoni [in court]: They found it on Irving Bruno's baseball cap, a droplet, they found it on the passenger seat, they found it on the center console.\n\nBut a restaurant manager testified he had seen Maria cut her finger earlier that night. Police cleared Irving Bruno. But the defense still tried to persuade the jury.\n\nMary Fulginiti: The defense, though, is still going to try to raise doubt \u2026 Just because they were cleared didn't mean they didn't possibly do it.\n\nThe defense also drills down on the Tricia Pacaccio case, the 1993 murder outside Chicago. Everyone agrees it was Gargiulo's DNA on Tricia's fingernails. But how did it get there? Nardoni says it could have come from casual contact. Gargiulo had been friends with Tricia's brother and Tricia had been in Gargiulo's van the day before she was killed.\n\nDaniel Nardoni [in court]: I have a theory \u2026 and it is this. That Tricia sits in the backseat of the family van, you know, she touches it, her clothes pick it up \u2014 potentially Mr. Gargiulo's DNA.\n\nTo find out how likely that is, \"48 Hours\" asked Nathan Lents, a forensic expert at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.\n\nMaureen Maher: Let's talk about \u2014 it's a leather armrest in a car. I have my arm there. You come and put your arm on anytime afterwards. What's the likelihood that you are going to pick up some of my DNA on you, and keep it on for 24 hours, 36 hours?\n\nNathan Lents: So, what we're talking about now is a secondary transfer. \u2026 A day later? I've never seen a secondary transfer that would last that long. There's just not enough cells that would survive, and especially on your arm, which is touching other things, you're putting on and off your clothes. That rubs off the cells pretty quickly.\n\nAnd he says casual contact is even more unlikely because, at trial, the scientist who matched Gargiulo's DNA to Tricia Pacaccio's fingernails said it was actually a 50/50 mixture of Tricia and Gargiulo's DNA. And that is significant.\n\nNathan Lents: Casual contact will leave a few cells here and there. \u2026 A 50/50 mixture means, in almost all cases, that there was a lot of DNA, a lot of cells from both parties.\n\nMaureen Maher: That would require contact?\n\nNathan Lents: That would require extensive contact \u2026 It looks to me that the \u2014 defendant was scratched by those fingernails. That's what it looks like to me.\n\nWhile there may have been some doubt about the power of that DNA evidence, no one disagrees that the DNA in the case of the woman who survived, Michelle Murphy, belongs to Michael Gargiulo.\n\nMary Fulginiti: His DNA is all over the place. So, they've gotta somehow figure out, \"OK, what am I gonna do now to defend this particular charge?\"\n\nThe defense's argument surprises everyone.\n\nGARGIULO'S STATE OF MIND\n\nProsecutor Garrett Dameron [in court]: Michelle Murphy, because of her strength and courage allowed investigators to work backwards and piece this entire case together.\n\nShe is the sole surviving victim. And it is Gargiulo's DNA that is found all over Murphy's apartment. It's a problem defense attorneys Daniel Nardoni and Dale Rubin must address head on.\n\nDaniel Nardoni [in court]: And we know that the evidence in this \u2014 is stronger. It's much stronger.\n\nMichelle Murphy testified that she never saw her attacker's face, but she did notice he was left-handed. And there were those words Michelle heard her attacker utter as he ran out the door: \"I am sorry.\"\n\nDale Rubin [in court]: Michelle Murphy is the only count in which the prosecution has shown that Mr. Gargiulo was in her apartment and attacked her.\n\nIn a surprising move, Michael Gargiulo's attorneys do not deny that he attacked Murphy but insist that he wasn't in his right mind when he did it.\n\nDale Rubin [in court]: She says that she's fighting off Mr. Gargiulo, when all of a sudden he cuts himself \u2026 He stands up, he, like, comes out of a fog \u2026 says, \"I'm sorry, I'm sorry,\" and runs out. \u2026 he didn't know where he was\u2026 didn't know what he was doing.\n\nAnd to prove it, the defense calls only two witnesses at trial: mental health experts.\n\nDale Rubin [in court]: Both of them have diagnosed Mr. Gargiulo with a mental disease or disorder. \u2026 He can't premeditate. He can't deliberate. He can't have malice of forethought.\n\nThe defense says when Gargiulo attacked Murphy, it was as if another personality had taken over as if he was possessed.\n\nDale Rubin [in court]: \u2026 an experience of \"possession\".\n\n\n\nMichael Gargiulo, they claim, suffers from dissociative identity disorder.\n\nKris Mohandie: Dissociative identity disorder used to be called multiple personality disorder. \u2026 there's a split \u2026 whereby they may not have an awareness of when they're doing certain things. \u2026 this becomes the go-to defense because you can say, \"I was there, but I wasn't.\"\n\nMary Fulginiti: They're just saying that they didn't have the mental state to be able to commit \u2026 horrible crime.\n\nMaureen Maher: And how often is that true?\n\nMary Fulginiti: Oh, it's very infrequently. I mean the only times I've seen it actually be successful is when the person was truly like a schizophrenic, had other voices in his head.\n\nThe defense can only hope that they have managed to convince the jury. After a three-month long trial, 79 witnesses, the presentation of some 350 exhibits, and that field trip to the crime scenes, closing statements begin.\n\nProsecutor Garrett Dameron again lays out the similarities among the victims\u2026and the attacks.\n\nProsecutor Garrett Dameron [in court]: It was four female victims, all young, attractive, and outgoing \u2026 These attacks, these murders, took a great deal of strength and athleticism \u2026 Each of these attacks \u2026 were all extraordinarily cold-blooded, tortuous \u2026 Each of these victims were ambushed \u2026 no evidence that there was any theft \u2026 Knife is the weapon of choice.\n\nFrom left: murder victims Tricia Pacaccio, Ashley Ellerin, Maria Bruno and attack survivor Michelle Murphy\n\nTwenty similarities between the attacks of the four women are described.\n\nProsecutor Garrett Dameron [in court]: Those common characteristics of these crimes point to one man, one killer, Michael Gargiulo\n\nProsecutor Garrett Dameron [in court]: You know about the DNA.\n\nAdding to their argument is the forensic evidence, with Gargiulo's DNA found all over Michelle Murphy's apartment, on Tricia Pacaccio's fingernails, and that slight amount on the bootie near Maria Bruno's home.\n\nMary Fulginiti: The prosecution is trying to lump these all together. Why? Because they want to show that it was one attacker. That the pattern, the practice, the, you know, everything that was done was similar.\n\nDaniel Nardoni | Defense attorney [in court]: You have to judge each case separately.\n\nMary Fulginiti: On the other hand, the defense is trying to do just the opposite. They wanna separate these out. They wanna show that, \"No, no, no. One's in Illinois. You know, yes, you may have some in California. But they're separated by years and time. They're not just one attacker.\n\nDaniel Nardoni [in court]: You can find him not guilty on all these crimes. Or you can find him \u2014 guilty of some crimes and not guilty \u2014 of other crimes.\n\nMary Fulginiti: The defense just needs to plant a seed of doubt in one of those jurors.\n\nFINDING JUSTICE\n\nThe three-month trial of Michael Gargiulo has captured the public's attention.\n\nFor the families of the victims, the wait for justice has seemed endless. Finally, the finish seems to be in sight, as the jury begins its deliberations on August 12, 2019.\n\nMary Fulginiti: This was \u2014 probably one of the worst cases. And I've worked in this area for a long time as a prosecutor and defense attorney. \u2026 And I've never seen anything this horrific. So, for this jury to have to see all this evidence \u2026 and day in and day out for three months to think about this case, and what happened to these victims, is really challenging.\n\nBut in what might seem like a short time, given such a long trial, after three-and-a-half days of deliberations, the verdicts are in:\n\nCOURT CLERK: We the jury in the above and titled action find the defendant, Michael Gargiulo, guilty of the crime of attempted murder\u2026\n\nGuilty of attacking Michelle Murphy.\n\nCOURT CLERK: Guilty of the crime of first-degree murder.\n\nGuilty of murdering Maria Bruno.\n\nCOURT CLERK: \u2026 guilty of the crime of first-degree murder\n\nAnd guilty of murdering Ashley Ellerin.\n\nMichael Gargiulo sat without emotion, as he heard the verdicts.\n\nOutside the courtroom, Maureen Maher immediately called the Paccacios with the news. \"Hi. It's all done. It's all done here. And now it's your turn.\"\n\nMaureen Maher [after the phone call]: She's sobbing, sobbing, sobbing. She's so grateful that they all got their justice and that now it's Tricia's turn.\n\nRemember Tricia's case was included in California only as supporting evidence of Michael Gargiulo's criminal pattern. It is up to Illinois officials in Cook County to try the case there.\n\nMaureen Maher with Tommy, Diane and Rick Pacaccio. CBS News\n\nDiane Pacaccio | Tricia's mother: We have to make sure that Cook County now does the job that they need to continue to do because they need to prosecute him for what he did to my daughter.\n\nMaureen Maher: Are you confident \u2026 that he will be brought back to Chicago and he will stand trial?\n\nTommy Pacaccio | Tricia's brother: Talking with the California attorneys and our attorneys in Cook County, I feel confident.\n\nThe Pacaccios are cautiously optimistic. As they say, they have been let down by the Cook County State's Attorney's Office before. The family has criticized that office for being slow to charge Gargiulo when there was that DNA match in 2003. When \"48 Hours\" spoke with Jack Blakey from the Cook County State's Attorney's Office in 2011, he told us that DNA match alone wasn't enough to charge Gargiulo.\n\nMaureen Maher: If there was a DNA match to Gargiulo why hasn't he been arrested?\n\nJack Blakely: The DNA match is consistent with casual contact. \u2026 we still cannot establish based on the DNA alone that he was present at the time of the killing as opposed to a different time.\n\nBut it came out at the Los Angeles trial that an Illinois forensic scientist submitted her findings to Cook County prosecutors in 2003, that it was a 50/50 mixture of Tricia and Gargiulo's DNA on Tricia's fingernails. Remember, the expert from John Jay College of Criminal Justice told us that usually signifies extensive contact.\n\nNathan Lents | Forensic expert: A 50/50 mixture means, in almost all cases, that there was a lot of DNA, a lot of cells from both parties \u2026 that would require extensive contact.\n\nIn almost all cases, extensive contact. So why not bring charges?\n\nNathan Lents: A lot of prosecutors are hesitant to bring a case when there's not at least one other piece of evidence that helps complete the picture of how the DNA got there\n\nMaureen Maher: Does it bother you that the charges weren't filed?\n\nDet. Lou Sala | Cook County, Illinois: Oh, absolutely. \u2026 We \u2014 we had him in 2003.\n\nMaureen Maher: You had him?\n\nDet. Lou Sala: Yeah, but it didn't work out.\n\nFor Lou Sala, the lead detective on the Pacaccio case, the focus now is seeking closure to the case that has haunted him through the latter part of his career, and into retirement.\n\nDet. Lou Sala: Now that L.A. is done, they fully intend to \u2026 extradite him back here \u2026 And I think It has to be done for the Pacaccio family. \u2026 Their verdict is still coming.\n\nBut the trial in L.A. did give the Pacaccios a chance to meet the men who changed the course of Tricia's case. Temer Leary and Anthony DiLorenzo, who came forward with Gargiulo statements. Evidence that pushed authorities to finally charge Gargiulo with Tricia's murder.\n\n\n\nMaureen Maher: So, you have both met the Pacaccios now?\n\nAnthony DiLorenzo: Yes.\n\nTemer Leary: Yeah.\n\nMaureen Maher: What was that like?\n\nTemer Leary: I \u2014 it was hard. \u2026 I see outta the corner of my eye, I see them. And I spun around. And I, like, you know, \"Rick?\" And he instantly knew who I was. He hopped up and \u2026 gave me a hug.\n\nRick Pacaccio and Anthony DiLorenzo share an embrace after meeting for the first time. DiLorenzo and Temer Leary shared information with \"48 Hours\" and Chicago authorities which led to Michael Gargiulo being indicted for the murder of Tricia Pacaccio \u2014 18 years after her death. CBS News\n\nAnthony DiLorenzo: I feel for them so much. Th \u2014 you know, they were just sent \u2014 through the wringer the whole time.\n\n\n\nDiane Pacaccio: It's always painful. \u2026 it will always be. I just tell people it's something that I have to live with now and deal with now. And try to cope with for the rest of my life.\n\nTricia's remembrance book from her funeral provides bittersweet memories.\n\nMaureen Maher [looking at book]: And so there's family in here obviously, and lots of friends. I mean, hundreds of people.\n\nIt's filled with kind comments about their beloved daughter, but also this:\n\nMaureen Maher: \u2026 back here, what is that name?\n\nDiane Pacaccio: Michael Gargiulo signed that.\n\nIt has been a 26 year-long journey from when that book was signed by the man the Pacaccios now believe killed their daughter. Gargiulo is now a convicted murderer of two other women \u2014 women the Pacaccios, through Tricia, helped to find justice.\n\nDiane Pacaccio: She helped these other girls. She was a very \u2014 always liked to help people. \u2026 And I just want justice to get done because that's what my daughter deserves.\n\nThe penalty phase of Michael Gargiulo's Los Angeles trial is scheduled to begin on October 7, 2019. He will be sentenced to either the death penalty or life in prison.\n\nCook County officials intend to try Gargiulo in Illinois for the murder of Tricia Pacaccio", "description": "Four young women attacked, only one survivor \u2014 inside the investigation and trial of the serial, sexual thrill killer", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/10/e36b7616-40cb-4950-9d84-5485c1060973/thumbnail/1200x630/c94ba3847811812da6882dff952e011f/gargiulo-victims-1280.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
