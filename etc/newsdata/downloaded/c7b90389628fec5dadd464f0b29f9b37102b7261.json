Their parents, who have not been identified, brought the family to Isil's so-called Capilphate in Syria five years ago.\n\nIn an interview with the BBC, Amira, who still has traces of a London accent and is able to write, painstakingly wrote out the place she once called home: \"LaNDN uKeH\" -- London, UK.\n\nDescribing her pre-war life, she said: \u201cI go to the park, I go to grand-mum\u2019s house, I go to the fun fair.\"\n\nThe family entered Syria around five years ago, travelling to Aleppo, on to Raqqa and then down the Euphrates river valley, ending up in Baghouz.\n\nHuman rights watchdogs have heaped pressure on the international community, particularly Western countries, to repatriate their citizens from Syria.\n\nFew have done so, and the UK has revoked the citizenship of high-profile militants and Isil supporters, including Shamima Begum.\n\nThe case for orphans is more complex, and both France and the Netherlands have permitted the return of child nationals whose parents took them to Syria to join the terror group, but died there.\n\nIn the hours after the Ain Issa camp was overrun, aid agency Save the Children made a plea with countries to repatriate their citizens, particularly children, before it was too late.\n\nBy Sunday afternoon, Amira, Hiba and Hamza were gone.", "description": "Three British Islamic State orphans have gone missing in northern Syria after the camp they were in was shelled by Turkish forces.", "authors": ["Sara Elizabeth Williams"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/A.l3248e2n.YpEbheX4ONQ--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/b0b681c1952e4e297cdae6ab8b1de670", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
