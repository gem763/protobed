But defendant\u2019s unauthorised use harms the existing and future market for the original photograph.\n\n\u201cThe Instagram post made the photograph immediately available to Lopez\u2019s tens of millions of followers\u2026 who would otherwise be interested in viewing licensed versions of the photograph in the magazines and newspapers that are plaintiff\u2019s customers.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the $150,000, the agency is also seeking an injunction against Lopez that would stop her and her team from posting the photo in the future, according to the court documents.\n\nEarlier this year, paparazzi photo agency Xclusive-Lee attempted to sue Gigi Hadid for copyright infringement after the model shared one the company\u2019s photos to her Instagram account.\n\nAt the time, Hadid shared a lengthy post to Instagram in which she said that she thought the lawsuit was \u201cabsurd\u201d.\n\nExplaining the emotional toll the paparazzi can have on those whose picture they are pursuing, Hadid said that she found the picture on Twitter and had \u201cno way of knowing\u201d which photographer took it.\n\n\u201cTo the paparazzi, I understand that this is how you make your living, and I respect that this is something I must accept with my job. But there is a line,\u201d Hadid wrote.\n\nThe case was eventually dismissed after a New York district judge found that the picture agency had not secured the official copyright registration for the photo by the time it filed the lawsuit, according to Business Insider.\n\nPreviously, Khloe Kardashian, 50 Cent, Jessica Simpson and Ariana Grande have also faced copyright infringement lawsuits after sharing paparazzi photographs of themselves to Instagram.", "description": "Jennifer Lopez is being sued for copyright infringement for posting a photo of herself taken by paparazzi to her Instagram account.
