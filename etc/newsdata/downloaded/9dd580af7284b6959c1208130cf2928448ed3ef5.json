Some women have historically felt they were unattractive without the rings and others felt the pressure to wear them for visiting tourists\n\nRings have also been traditionally seen as symbols of wealth and reserved for favourite daughters, as a more common theory.\n\nPadung author Pascal Khoo Thwe told Channel New Asia that 'our mother was a dragon' and 'they have the same sort of neck'. He claims to have grown up with his grandmother wearing 14-inch high sets of rings.\n\nMu Lone, 88, told the Mirror how women felt they 'weren\u2019t beautiful without neck-rings' in her time.\n\nShe added: 'The rings choked me and felt too tight at first. Food would get stuck when I tried to swallow. I had to stretch my neck to eat. But I got used to it.'\n\nA little girl is captured wearing the golden accessory.

Some have felt pressured to be one of the 'long-necked women' for tourists and Muu Pley removed hers after 13 years. She decided to put them back on after a tourism boom in the village and it remains unknown how many other women found themselves in a similar situation\n\nMu admitted that she will wear them until she dies and they will be buried with her.\n\nMeanwhile mother-of-two Muu Pley removed hers after 13 years in fear of her neck growing too long.\n\nThe 23-year-old felt 'free and light' unlike some women who still feel the pressure to wear them for tourists who visit to see the 'long-necked women'.\n\nBut Muu decided to put the rings back on after a tourism boom in her village.\n\nThere are around 500 women who follow the custom which inspired the creation of 'tourism villages' in 1985.\n\nKayan locals had fled raids by Burma's army which had suppressed the country's ethnic minorities, and were granted temporary stay in Thailand. The provincial official saw the 'outstanding traits that could attract tourism interest' in the women's golden neck rings, according to the culture ministry account.\n\nThe idea that women's necks would collapse if they removed the rings was proven wrong by Documentary maker Lorna MacMillan who spent five months with the tribe (pictured are members). She said they do not support the head and the women 'can reach their hands down and clean their skin'\n\nDocumentary maker Lorna MacMillan spent five months with the tribe and found the rings do not support the head which means their necks would not collapse if they were removed.\n\nSpeaking at a National Geographic documentary Suffering for Tradition: Taboo: Body Moification, she said: 'In fact women can reach their hands down and clean their skin so it's not actually something that's gripping them in any way.'\n\nThe accessory is often removed during child birth, a doctor's appointment or if the woman is caught committing cheating.", "description": "Women and children in ancient tribe in the Kayah state in Myanmar, China, have 'stretched' their necks to eat while wearing brass rings around their necks.
