REUTERS/Staff\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a completely clear Brexit road ahead. Familiar Irish border snags remained a spoiler for Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party [nS8N26G06E], but after three years of tortuous uncertainty any deal was a deal to cheer.\n\n\u201cWe have a great new Brexit deal,\u201d British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said and \u201cWhere there is a will, there is a deal - we have one!\u201d echoed European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker as the news broke from Brussels. [nL5N2722FT][nB5N24302R]\n\nSterling, which has been the key gauge of Brexit sentiment all along, jumped more than a percent against the dollar, taking its gains over the last six days to 6% and which if it holds, will be a more than 30-year record. [nL5N2722P7]\n\nIt ran as far as $1.2988 GBP= to the highest against the euro since May at 0.86 pence. The euro also jumped to a near- two-month high against the dollar of $1.1139 EUR= in its sixth day of gains in the past seven.\n\n\u201cThe deal has been announced, but the key hurdle of being voted into the UK Parliament remains,\u201d said ING\u2019s chief EMEA FX and interest rate strategist Petr Krpata.\n\nLondon\u2019s heavyweight FTSE and the pan-European STOXX 600 both jumped 0.6%, having been flat beforehand. UK Gilts GB10YT=RR, German Bunds DE10YT=RR, the Swiss franc, gold and most other safe havens began selling off. [.EU]\n\nBarclays Capital European equities strategist Emmanuel Cau said tha deal \u201cshould provide legs to the rotation from UK exporters to domestic plays\u201d as it should help rebuild confidence.\n\nTALKING TURKEY\n\nWall Street was expected to reopen higher and emerging-market stocks .MSCIEF gained for a sixth day \u2014 their longest winning streak since early April \u2014 after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators were nailing down a Phase 1 trade deal text for their presidents to sign next month. [nL2N27126V]\n\nBut U.S. retail sales fell for the first time in seven months, suggesting manufacturing-led weakness was spreading to the broader economy. [nL2N2701IJ] U.S. consumption has been one of few bright spots in the global economy, so the data fanned worries the trade war would ultimately tip the world into recession.\n\n\u201cWhile the U.S. suspended a hike in tariffs, it hasn\u2019t gone as far as scrapping the tariffs altogether, so it is hard to expect a quick pick-up in the economy,\u201d said Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.\n\nThe dollar index =USD was last at 97.692, having reached its lowest level since Aug. 27. The dollar was flat at 108.75 JPY= after peaking at 108.90 to the Japanese yen and down against the euro at $1.11 EUR=.\n\nIn commodities, oil prices slipped after industry data showed a larger-than-expected build-up in U.S. crude stockpiles, adding to concerns that global demand for oil may weaken amid further signs of an economic slowdown. [nZXN04P700]\n\nBrent crude LCOc1 futures fell 0.25% to $59.27 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 lost 0.5% to $53.01.\n\nTurkey\u2019s fragile markets remained in focus after the country\u2019s military advance in Syria created tensions with United States and Europe and incurred mild sanctions. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan is to meet with U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo later.\n\nAlthough the U.S. pulled its troops out of the area to allow Turkey\u2019s push, Pence and Pompeo are expected to urge Erdogan to declare a ceasefire, something Erdogan says will \u201cnever\u201d happen. U.S. President Donald Trump warned of \u201cdevastating\u201d sanctions if discussions did not go well.\n\nFILE PHOTO: British five pound banknotes are seen in this picture illustration taken November 14, 2017.
