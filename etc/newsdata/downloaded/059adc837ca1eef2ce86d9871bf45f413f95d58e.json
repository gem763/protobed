They even say life could still exist there.\n\nDiscovering the animals was 'fully unexpected', David Harwood, a micro-paleontologist at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln who is part of the expedition \u2014 known as SALSA (Subglacial Antarctic Lakes Scientific Access), told Nature.\n\nAl Gagnon (left) and SALSA Marine Techs Michael Tepper-Rasmussen and Jack Greenberg (center and right) test the WHOI (Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution) Gravity Corer that will be used to collect 10-foot and 20-foot sediment cores from Mercer Subglacial Lake. Scientists in Antarctica have finally drilled into a mysterious lake buried under more than 3,500 feet of ice in a bid to find out if life exists there.\n\nWHAT IS LAKE MERCER? The pool of water, known as Subglacial Lake Mercer, covers 160 square kilometres, twice the size of Manhattan. It might be 10\u201315 metres deep Despite temperatures that are likely to stay below 0 \u00b0C, the lake doesn't freeze, because of the intense pressure from the ice above. Antarctica conceals more than 400 lakes beneath its ice\n\nThe team are unsure how the creatures got there, but one theory is that they inhabited ponds and streams in the Transantarctic Mountains 50km away during brief warm periods, which occurred in the past 10,000 years or 120,000 years ago, and somwhow were transported to Mercer Lake.\n\nHowever, when the climate cooled, the animals were left trapped in an icy grave.\n\nThe pool of water, known as Subglacial Lake Mercer, measures nearly 62 square miles, was discovered more than a decade ago through satellite images but has never been explored.\n\nIt is one of 400 lakes beneath the Antarctic ice - and experts say any life there could raise hopes of finding similar organisms deep inside Mars or on the ice-covered moons of Jupiter and Saturn.\n\nThe team now plans to sequence scraps of DNA from the carcasses to work out if the animals are salt or freshwater species.\n\nIt could also reveal if they survived in the underwater environment once the ice returned to lock them in.\n\nThe Subglacial Antarctic Lakes Scientific Access (SALSA) team said it took two days of drilling to reach Mercer Subglacial Lake on December 26.\n\nThe team melted their way through an enormous frozen river with a high-pressure, hot-water drill.\n\n'After four days of troubleshooting components that sustained wear and tear from sitting through two winters on ice, the Drill Team began drilling the main borehole on the evening of December 23 and reached the lake faster than expected at 10.30pm on December 26 with a borehole depth of 1084 meters,' it said.\n\nLead Driller Dennis Duling (right) and PI Brent Christner (left) with the hot water drill moments before it began its 4,000 foot journey downwards to Mercer Subglacial Lake\n\nA team of researchers \u2014 which includes 45 scientists, drillers and other staff members \u2014 with the organization were able to send an instrument down a borehole the next day\n\nThe pool of water, known as Subglacial Lake Mercer, measures nearly 62 square miles, was discovered more than a decade ago through satellite images but has never been explored.\n\nA team of researchers \u2014 which includes 45 scientists, drillers and other staff members \u2014 with the organization were able to send an instrument down a borehole the next day.\n\nThey will also lower a remotely operated vehicle down the hole to capture more footage and take more extensive measurements.\n\nIt is hoped the submersible's three video cameras might capture images of animals that live in the dark water.\n\n'We don't know what's going to be there,' John Priscu, a lake ecologist at Montana State University in Bozeman and leader of the project told Nature.\n\n'That's what makes it so much fun.'\n\nSome of the researchers drilled into a nearby, smaller subglacial pool called Lake Whillans in 2013, and found it teeming with microbes.\n\nThe group plans to study the depth, temperature and cleanliness of the lake over the next few days.\n\nPart of the drilling process involves sampling the drill water to test its cleanliness.\n\nThe water has been tested twice thus far, and both tests showed the water was 'as clean as filtered water can get', in the words of SALSA PI Brent Christner.", "description": "The video reveals the 3500ft borehole into Mercer Subglacial Lake, a hydraulically active lake that lies more 1000m beneath the Whillans Ice Plain on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.", "authors": ["Mark Prigg For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/12/31/22/7999680-0-image-a-31_1546296960701.jpg", "published_at": "2019-01-21"}
