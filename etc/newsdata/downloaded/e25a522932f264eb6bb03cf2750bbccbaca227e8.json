General Assembly Trump pushes aggressive \u2018America First\u2019 message to world leaders\n\nUNITED NATIONS \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d fixation was on stark display on Tuesday in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly, where he boasted of his presidential accomplishments, pushed leaders to adopt his nationalist ideology and threw red meat to his base from the world stage.\n\n\u201cLike my beloved country, each nation represented in this hall, has a cherished history, culture and heritage, that is worth defending and celebrating, and which gives us our singular potential and strength. The free world must embrace its national foundations. It must not attempt to erase them or replace them,\u201d Trump told a silent crowd of world leaders and aides. \u201cThe future doesn\u2019t belong to globalists. The future belongs to patriots.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nTuesday\u2019s statement marked the third year in a row that Trump espoused an \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy, the populist message he pledged to embrace on the 2016 campaign trail and that helped fuel his victory.\n\nAnd though the main themes of his address could have been lifted from one of the often-meandering stump speeches he delivers at raucous campaign-style rallies, Trump spoke deliberately on Tuesday, reading from a teleprompter and appearing to stick to his prepared remarks.\n\n\u201cThe future belongs to sovereign and independent nations, who protect their citizens, respect their neighbors and honor the differences that make each country special and unique,\u201d he told a mostly quiet audience \u2014 there was no clapping or standing ovation during the address.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/45/f0/b02122504d1698e8430e6118eb36/trump-un-fullspeech.png\"\n\nHe began by touting his military buildup since taking office, though he added that \u201chopefully it will never have to use this power.\u201d\n\nThe president also dedicated a significant chunk of his speech to condemning Iran\u2019s aggression, reiterating his calls for a diplomatic resolution to the crisis in Iran but maintaining that he is prepared to respond with force to defend U.S. interests if necessary.\n\nTrump had stark words for the Islamic Republic, declaring that \u201cas long as Iran\u2019s menacing behavior continues, sanctions will not be lifted,\u201d an apparent reference to the drone strikes on Saudi oil infrastructure that the United States and several allies have blamed on Iran.\n\n\u201cNo responsible government should subsidize Iran\u2019s bloodlust,\u201d Trump continued, warning that should Tehran continue lashing out, \u201cIran\u2019s leader will have turned a proud nation into another precautionary tale.\u201d\n\nBut Trump pushed back against critics of his engagement with combative regimes, defending his resistance to meeting hostility with military force by attempting to recast his anti-interventionist streak.\n\n\u201cThe United States has never believed in permanent enemies,\u201d he said, pointing to his attempts at diplomacy with Kim Jong Un in North Korea and the Taliban in Afghanistan. \u201cAmerica knows while anyone can make war, only the most courageous can choose peace.\u201d\n\nVice President Mike Pence and several of Trump\u2019s Cabinet secretaries were seated in the cavernous hall as Trump spoke, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and new U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Kelly Craft. First lady Melania Trump and three of the president\u2019s adult children, Ivanka Trump, Donald Trump Jr., and Tiffany Trump, were also spotted in the chamber.\n\nThe president\u2019s annual addresses to the international body have often been the stage for some of his most memorable rhetoric. In his first speech there, Trump nicknamed North Korea\u2019s leader \u201cRocket Man,\u201d a nickname the president used until the two leaders became friendly amid thawing tensions between their nations. Trump\u2019s second address elicited outright laughter in the chamber hall when he bragged his administration had accomplished more in two years than \u201calmost any administration.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s address comes as the shadow of a possible impeachment looms over his presidency back in Washington, revived by allegations that Trump pressured his Ukrainian counterpart to open a corruption investigation into a political rival at the same time he was delaying hundreds of millions in military aid.\n\nHe made no mention of the growing controversy in his speech, though Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was present in the hall for Trump\u2019s remarks.\n\nTrump also used the international stage to defend his fixation on border security, railing against \u201copen-border activists who cloak themselves in the rhetoric of social justice\u201d and denouncing what he claimed is a \u201ca growing cottage industry of radical activists and organizations that promote human smuggling\u201d as he framed the issue as an international scourge.\n\nGlobal Translations A new podcast series from POLITICO.

Many of the countries here today are coping with the challenges of uncontrolled migration,\u201d he said. \u201cEach of you has the absolute right to protect your borders. And so, of course, does our country.\u201d\n\nTrump told the audience that he would not accept a \u201cbad\u201d trade deal with China even as the trade war continues, accusing other nations of \u201cacting in bad faith\u201d to exploit international trading rules, and tying the issue to his campaign pledge to return manufacturing jobs to the U.S. \u201cAs jobs were outsourced, a small handful grew wealthy at the expense of the middle class,\u201d he said.\n\nTariffs on U.S. and Chinese goods have begun to act as a drag on the U.S. economy, leaving the president with a major unfulfilled campaign promise as he runs for reelection next year. Still, he said, \u201cat the center of our vision for national renewal is an ambitious campaign to reform international trade,\u201d pledging to reverse what he labeled a \u201cgrave economic injustice.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur goal is simple,\u201d Trump said Tuesday. \u201cWe want balanced trade that is fair and reciprocal.\u201d\n\nAnd he didn\u2019t exit the world stage without getting off a few shots at the international community on key issues important to his base. During a riff on the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, Trump took a swipe at dictator Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s socialist regime, an ideological label he\u2019s sought to affix to the Democratic Party\u2019s field of 2020 presidential candidates.\n\n\u201cOne of the most serious challenges that we face is the specter of socialism. It\u2019s the wrecker of nations and destroyer of societies,\u201d Trump said, dismissing the ideology as a power grab by \u201cthe ruling class.\u201d\n\nHe also tied his rant against socialism to social media censorship, a complaint Trump and conservatives have taken up in alleging viewpoint discrimination by tech giants.\n\n\u201cA small number of platforms are acquiring immense power over what we can see and over what we are allowed to say,\u201d he asserted, accusing unnamed \u201cmedia and economic institutions\u201d of pushing \u201cflat out assaults on our histories, traditions and values.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the United States, my administration has made clear to social media companies that we will uphold the right of free speech. A free society cannot allow social media giants to silence the voices of the people,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also provided some red meat by boasting of his split with the international community when it came to abortion rights and guns.\n\n\u201cWe are aware that many United Nations projects assert a global right to taxpayer-funded abortion on demand,\u201d Trump said, ripping \u201cglobal bureaucrats\u201d who, he said, \u201chave absolutely no business attacking the sovereignty of nations that wish to protect innocent life.\u201d\n\nLikewise, he added, \u201cthere's no circumstance under which the United States will allow international entities to trample on the rights of our citizens, including the right to self-defense,\u201d announcing that the U.S. would \u201cnever\u201d ratify a U.N. arms treaty that gun rights advocates have denounced as infringing upon Second Amendment rights.\n\nHe closed by imploring his fellow world leaders to tap into nationalism, telling the audience that \u201cpatriots see a nation and its destiny in ways that no one else can.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe love of our nations makes the world better for all nations,\u201d he said, issuing a challenge to his counterparts. \u201cJoin us in the most fulfilling mission a person could have, the most profound contribution that anyone can make: Lift up your nations and cherish your culture, honor your histories, treasure your citizens, make your country strong and prosperous and righteous, honor the dignity of your people and nothing will be outside of your reach.\u201d", "description": "Foreign leaders listened closely to Trump\u2019s speech, his third to the multilateral body.", "authors": ["Caitlin Oprysko", "Anita Kumar"], "top_image": "http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/1888/1155968404_6089046081001_6089052841001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"}
