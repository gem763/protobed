We will work together to grow together toward a bright and prosperous future.\u201d\n\nSpeaking alongside Wang, Maamau said there was much to learn from China.\n\n\u201cI do believe that there is much to learn and gain from the People\u2019s Republic of China and the re-establishment of our diplomatic relations is just the beginning,\u201d he said.\n\nThere was no mention of the space tracking station at the news conference, nor in the joint communique between the two countries released by China\u2019s Foreign Ministry.\n\nChina\u2019s space programme is overseen by the military.\n\nChina\u2019s Defence Ministry this week declined comment on the Kiribati facility.\n\nLast week was difficult for Taiwan, as the Solomon Islands also ditched it for Beijing. The Solomon Islands foreign minister signed a deal on diplomatic ties in China last Saturday.\n\nBoth the Solomon Islands and Kiribati are small developing nations but lie in strategic waters that have been dominated by the United States and its allies since World War Two. China\u2019s moves to expand its influence in the Pacific have angered Washington.\n\nA former Taiwanese ambassador to Kiribati, Abraham Chu, told Taiwan\u2019s Central News Agency last weekend that China had never fully removed the tracking station in Kiribati and that it \u201ccould come back at any time\u201d.\n\nTaiwan now has formal relations with just 15 countries, mostly small and poor nations in Latin America and the Pacific, including Nauru, Tuvalu and Palau. China has signalled it is coming for the rest of Taiwan\u2019s allies.", "description": "China and the Pacific island state of Kiribati restored diplomatic ties on Friday after the former diplomatic ally of Taiwan abandoned Taipei.", "authors": ["Michelle Nichols", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
