Disney had reversed an earlier decision that it wouldn\u2019t accept ads from any rival streaming services. While Disney reached agreements with other competitors, the Journal said Disney failed to make peace with Netflix.\n\nDisney\u2019s ESPN will continue to accept Netflix ads, according to the report. Netflix is ramping up its advertising spending, shelling out $1.8 billion last year, with much of it going to TV commercials.\n\nDisney will go head-to-head with Netflix when its Disney+ streaming platform launches November 12. The new service will cost consumers $6.99 a month, compared to Netflix\u2019s most popular service that costs $12.99 a month.\n\nThe Disney-Netflix fight comes after the Journal reported yesterday that Disney and Amazon are locking horns over a similar matter that could result in Disney+ being blocked from Amazon\u2019s Fire TV devices. Amazon reportedly wants the rights to sell most of the ad space on Disney apps, which Disney has so far refused.\n\nConsumers are increasingly caught in the crossfire between big tech firms as they try to muscle their way into each other\u2019s territory using aggressive means. Those fights have now spread to the entertainment industry as the worlds of Silicon Valley and Hollywood become increasingly blurred.\n\nDisney CEO Bob Iger recently resigned from the board of Apple, which is launching its own streaming service, Apple TV+, also in November.\n\nAmazon and Apple have long had frosty relations, with consumers often coming out the loser. The fight frequently manifests itself in compatibility issues, causing trouble for consumers when they want to purchase or download content from an Amazon service using Apple devices.\n\nFollow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg.
