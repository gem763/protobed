He said as much in 1999.", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE\n\nMcCain said during Bill Clinton's impeachment trial that presidents must be held strictly accountable. Republican senators today should read his words.\n\nJohn McCain and Donald Trump (Photo: Jacquelyn Martin/Associated Press; Associated Press)\n\nThe closed door statements made by senators voting in the impeachment trial of former President Bill Clinton were published in the Congressional Record in 1999.\n\nSo while we can't ask the late Sen. John McCain what he thinks about the actions of President Donald Trump, we can, through McCain\u2019s statement on Clinton, understand what he expected of a president and what, in McCain\u2019s mind, should cause a president to be removed from office.\n\nEvery Republican in the Senate should read McCain\u2019s statement, particularly the person gifted McCain\u2019s seat, Sen. Martha McSally.\n\nMcCain voted to convict Clinton.\n\nDon't buy lame rationalizations\n\nHe says early in his statement, \u201cIndeed, I take no satisfaction at all from this vote, with one exception \u2013 and an important exception it is \u2013 that by voting to convict I have been spared reproach by my conscience for shirking my duty.\u201d\n\nThe senator then speaks about the rationale used by Clinton\u2019s defenders, who said that the articles of impeachment against Clinton did not rise to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors but were offenses, as McCain put it, \u201ccommitted to cover up private not public misconduct.\u201d\n\nMcCain understood the argument, but wasn\u2019t buying it.\n\nHe said, \u201cThis, too, is an appealing rationalization for acquittal. But it is just that, a rationalization. Nowhere in the Constitution or in the expressed views of our founders are crimes intended to conceal the President's character flaws distinguished from crimes intended to subvert democracy.\n\nWhat they owe us: Trump is in free fall. We need insights on his fitness from Mattis, Kelly and others. Now.\n\n\u201cThe President thwarted justice. No matter how unfair he or we may view a process that forces a President to disclose his own failings, we should not excuse or fail to punish in the constitutionally prescribed manner evidence that the President has deliberately thwarted the course of justice.\u201d\n\nWeird, isn\u2019t it?\n\nIt comes down to the president's oath\n\nThe same kind of \u201crationalization\u201d is being used these days by Republicans looking to protect President Donald Trump. They say Trump\u2019s alleged transgressions are more a reflection of character flaws than impeachable offenses.\n\nIt's similar to the argument Clinton's defenders used. McCain wasn't having it.\n\nHe said, \u201cI have done things in my private life that I am not proud of. I suspect many of us have. But we are not asked to judge the President's character flaws. We are asked to judge whether the President, who swore an oath to faithfully execute his office, deliberately subverted \u2013 for whatever purpose \u2013 the rule of law.\u201d\n\nThe time for waiting is over: The House must move on Trump impeachment articles now.\n\nThat\u2019s the heart of it, as far as McCain is concerned. The president's sworn oath.\n\nHe said, \u201cAll of my life, I have been instructed never to swear an oath to my country in vain. In my former profession, those who violated their sworn oath were punished severely and considered outcasts from our society.\n\n\u201cI do not hold the President to the same standard that I hold military officers to. I hold him to a higher standard. Although I may admit to failures in my private life, I have at all times, and to the best of my ability, kept faith with every oath I have ever sworn to this country. I have known some men who kept that faith at the cost of their lives.\u201d\n\nHold presidents to a higher standard\n\nMcCain also brushed off the argument \u2013 like one we hear from Trump apologists today \u2013 that no ordinary citizen would be treated the way the president is being treated.\n\nMcCain said of this, \u201cNo, an ordinary citizen would not be treated as the President has been treated. But ordinary citizens don't enforce the laws for the rest of us. Ordinary citizens don't have the world's mightiest armed forces at their command. Ordinary citizens do not usually have the opportunity to be figures of historical importance.\"\n\nHe continued, \u201cPresidents are not ordinary citizens. They are extraordinary, in that they are vested with so much more authority and power than the rest of us. We have a right; indeed, we have an obligation, to hold them strictly accountable to the rule of law.\u201d\n\nImagine that.\n\nAn obligation to hold the president strictly accountable.\n\nWhen was the last time Trump was held \u201cstrictly accountable\u201d for \u2026 anything?\n\nEven worse, when was the last time McCain\u2019s former Republican colleagues fulfilled their obligation?\n\nE.J.
