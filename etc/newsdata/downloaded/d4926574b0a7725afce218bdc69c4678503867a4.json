But actress Rachel Adedeji is hoping that will all change next year because she wants Lisa to fall in love with her bezzie mate Cleo McQueen (Nadine Mulkerrin).\n\nClea? Liso? Lio? There\u2019s already a wealth of opportunity for their couple name and no doubt a loyal fanbase will be ready and waiting in no time.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to Metro.co.uk on the red carpet at last night\u2019s Inside Soap Awards where Hollyoaks won Best Soap, Rachel confessed her dreams for the would-be ultimate pairing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve always been saying I want to be with Cleo not only because she\u2019s my best mate in real life, but because she\u2019s also been unlucky in love,\u2019 Rachel told us.\n\n\u2018How funny would that be? Lisa and Cleo!\u2019\n\nBut if the writers don\u2019t bring the two together Rachel admitted that she\u2019s not fussed on who Lisa gets with.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m hoping 2020 can bring her a great person to settle down with,\u2019 she enthused. \u2018I mean, she\u2019s not being picky. Anyone, really anyone. Anyone who can accept her as the nutter that she is. \u2018\n\nRachel Adedeji is hoping that 2020 will be a better year for Lisa Loveday (Picture: PA Wire)\n\nOn top of that, Rachel teased there\u2019s plenty of drama on the horizon for Lisa in the run-up to Christmas.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re shooting stuff for Christmas now and it\u2019s been great because she\u2019s all about having great fun, so you can see in a few of the Christmas episodes she\u2019s all about having a laugh and spending time with her family.\n\n\u2018Of course she\u2019s lost her dad and she will not let whoever did it get away with murder. Obviously we know it was Breda, but Lisa is yet to find out and of course once she finds out, it\u2019s not going to go down well.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Hollyoaks, EastEnders and Emmerdale win big at the Inside Soap Awards 2019\n\nMORE: 10 soap spoilers next week: Death in EastEnders, Coronation Street tragedy, Emmerdale fight, Hollyoaks trauma\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Hollyoaks spoilers: Rachel Adedeji keen for Lisa Loveday and Cleo McQueen romance.", "authors": ["Cydney Yeates"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hollyoaks_1570525737.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
