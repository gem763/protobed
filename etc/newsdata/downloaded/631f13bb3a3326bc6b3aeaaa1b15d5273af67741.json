The solution, he said, was to hire private contractors who had earned the sufficient security clearance.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cA significant amount, and potentially even a small majority, of the most important work in government, in intelligence, is today performed by contractors, not government employees,\u201d said Mr Snowden, whose book is titled Permanent Record.\n\n\u201cAnd this is because, in the actual contracting language, there are very, very few tasks that contractors are legally forbidden from doing. And it\u2019s basically, the only things contractors can\u2019t do is press the red button that fires a missile.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

REUTERS\n\nMr Snowden, who was employed by NSA contractor Booz Allen Hamilton having previously worked for Dell and the CIA when he in 2013 leaked details of a massive US domestic and foreign surveillance programme, said private contractors were \u201cnot supposed to actually commit a crime \u2014 something that the government could do, and it wouldn\u2019t be a crime\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cBut everything else \u2014 building the system of mass surveillance, installing it, applying it, using it to gather or search through all this information that\u2019s already been collected to build perfect histories of private lives \u2014 all of these things are fair game and are done routinely, every day, right now, by people who are not formally government employees. That\u2019s how the system works, and that\u2019s what a contractor is.\u201d\n\nMr Snowden expressed sympathy with the whistleblower who has made accusations about Mr Trump\u2019s call to Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he asked him to look into allegations of misconduct by Mr Biden when he was vice president and sought the ousting of a prosecutor probing a company that employed Mr Biden son\u2019s.\n\nHe said: \u201cThey want to talk about the whistleblower rather than the government\u2019s own wrongdoing.\u201d\n\nMr Snowden said he believed ordinary people were becoming disenchanted with the major technology firms.\n\n\u201cThis shift in the way our systems work is what is creating, I think, fundamentally, the creeping authoritarianism that we see today,\u201d he said.\n\nThough he did not name Russia, he added: \u201cIn many parts of government, and not just in the United States, but around the world, in places like the UK, Poland, Hungary, we see a growing authoritarianism, where the left and the right have sharp disagreements on a few particular points, typically about social policy, but, broadly, they\u2019re actually gravitating on the north-south part of the political axis, not left or right, but towards authoritarianism rather than the libertarianism from which this country was born.\u201d", "description": "Whistleblower Edward Snowden, currently promoting a new memoir, has claimed a surge in the use of private contractors by US intelligence agencies, has led to a \u201ccreeping authoritarianism\u201d.", "authors": ["Andrew Buncombe"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/30/19/snowden-private.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
