USA TODAY\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. \u2014 Justin Houston hasn\u2019t talked much about his time with the Chiefs since he arrived in Indianapolis.\n\nA man of few words, Houston kept saying he was focused on the future, that he wouldn\u2019t let his past poison the future. The feeling of being cast off, of leading a franchise for the better part of a decade and then being cut from a Super Bowl contender for financial reasons, Houston barely touched.\n\nHe let his play do the talking for him.\n\nFacing off against his old teammates, against the MVP quarterback he\u2019d left behind, Houston led the best game a defense has ever played against Patrick Mahomes in the NFL, and he slammed the door on a key fourth down deep in the fourth quarter to lead the Colts to a 19-13 upset over the Chiefs on Sunday Night Football.\n\nThe Colts signed Houston for this purpose.\n\nMore: 32 things we learned from Week 5 of the 2019 NFL season\n\nIndianapolis needed a player who could make life miserable for opposing quarterbacks, who could take the game\u2019s best quarterbacks and make them seem human.\n\nNo quarterback in the NFL has ever seemed as superhuman as Mahomes.\n\nBut Houston did his job on Sunday night. After posting just one sack in his first four games as a Colt, Houston led an embattled Indianapolis defense into Arrowhead on Sunday night, a defense that had struggled against Philip Rivers and Matt Ryan and Derek Carr.\n\nFor two drives, Mahomes looked like he\u2019d take advantage.\n\nThen Houston came up with a sack, forced the Chiefs to punt it away, and the Colts defense found the life it has needed for so many weeks. Kansas City had never scored fewer than 26 points in a Mahomes start; he looked completely unstoppable entering Sunday night\u2019s game.\n\nHouston\u2019s sack opened the flood gates.\n\nIndianapolis harassed Mahomes, pressured him, took a quarterback who\u2019d been all but invincible this season and sped him up, got him throwing off his back foot and missing enough throws to bring the Chiefs offense to a grinding halt.\n\nKansas City punted, fumbled away a first down when George Odum punched the ball out of a receiver\u2019s hands, then started stringing punts together, shutting down the Chiefs in a way they\u2019ve never been shut down since Mahomes took over as the starting quarterback.\n\nMahomes, an escape artist who lives by making plays with his feet, had been sacked just three times in the first four games; the Chiefs led the NFL in sack percentage.\n\nHouston repeatedly whipped backup left tackle Cameron Erving, who had played well in place of an injured Eric Fisher this season but simply couldn\u2019t handle the incredible power Houston brings to the table.\n\nIndianapolis sacked Mahomes four times, keeping the Chiefs behind the sticks. Mahomes also was hobbled at one point in the third quarter when Erving inadvertently stepped on the quarterback's ankle.\n\nAnd despite the Colts defense rising to the challenge, turning in the best performance since Matt Eberflus took over as defensive coordinator, the Colts offense wasn\u2019t able to put the game out of reach.\n\nHouston handled that for them.\n\nFacing off against Kansas City on a fourth-and-1, Houston came flying off the edge, stoned Damien Williams for a 1-yard loss and gave the Colts the ball in position to make a field goal that all but sealed the game.\n\nHouston, in the process, showed the NFL what this defense can be.\n\nIndianapolis held Kansas City to just 13 points, half of the 26 the Chiefs scored in a win over Arizona last season, the lowest point total Mahomes had posted in a game up until this point in his career.\n\nThe player the Chiefs cut loose, the player who cost too much, handed his former team its first loss of the season in a game Kansas City was favored to win by double-digits.\n\nAfter that, that\u2019s all he needed to say.", "description": "The Chiefs were held to their lowest scoring total under Patrick Mahomes, who reaggravated an ankle injury in a loss to the Colts.", "authors": ["Joel A.
