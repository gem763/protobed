His wife Maureen was by his side holding his hand. For his fans that have loved and supported him all these years, take comfort in knowing that his words are all around us, and in that way his is never truly gone. In this time of grief please celebrate him the way you all know how, by being together and listening to the music. Let there be songs to fill the air.\u201d\n\nHunter wrote most of the Dead\u2019s songs with Jerry Garcia and was renowned for bringing a literary sensibility to the band\u2019s songs, in collaborations that included their biggest radio and video hit, \u201cTouch of Grey,\u201d as well as classics like \u201cCasey Jones,\u201d \u201cDark Star,\u201d \u201cBox of Rain,\u201d \u201cUncle John\u2019s Band,\u201d \u201cSugar Magnolia,\u201d \u201cBrokedown Palace\u201d and \u201cFriend of the Devil.\u201d One of the most famous lines in rock, \u201cWhat a long, strange trip it\u2019s been,\u201d came from Hunter\u2019s pen in the early FM staple \u201cTruckin\u2019.\u201d\n\nHunter also wrote with others, most famously Bob Dylan, starting with \u201cSilvio\u201d in 1988 and continuing through nearly the entirety of the 2009 album \u201cTogether Through Life\u201d and the track \u201cDuquesne Whistle\u201d on 2012\u2019s \u201cTempest,\u201d Dylan\u2019s last album of original material.\n\nIn 2013, the Americana Music Association gave Hunter its lifetime achievement award for songwriting. In 2015, he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame along with the late Garcia.\n\nHunter released or recorded a dozen solo albums, starting with \u201cTales of the Great Rum runners\u201d in 1974 and continuing into the 1990s. He also issued a series of books that included annotated volumes of Dead lyrics and translations of the work of Rainer Maria Rilke as well as his own poems.\n\n\u201cHunter tapped into his generation the same way Dylan did,\u201d Mike Campbell of the Heartbreakers told Rolling Stone in 2015, on the eve of the Songwriters Hall of Fame honor. \u201cPeople will look back and say, \u2018That\u2019s American culture represented in music.\u2019 He captured the hippie freedom, the mentality of the little guy against the corporation. A lot of the songs are about gambling, card playing and riverboat guys who\u2019ll cut your throat if you look the wrong way.\u201d\n\nSaid Hunter in a 2014 interview with the website Highway 81 Revisited, \u201dI always had a very high opinion, immodestly speaking, of what Jerry and I were turning out, and I thought we just hit some magical combination. I thought it was going to continue on and that we were doing something special. It wasn\u2019t just a fantasy, it was only partly fantasy.\u201d", "description": "Robert Hunter, the poet famous for writing many of the\u00a0Grateful Dead\u2019s best-regarded songs, has died at 78.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/RobertHunter1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
