Surrounded by NASA officials, Moon walkers, and lawmakers, Trump repeatedly asked NASA\u2019s administrator, Jim Bridenstine, why astronauts couldn\u2019t go straight to Mars instead of going to the Moon first.\n\n\u201cTo get to Mars, you have to land on the Moon, they say,\u201d Trump asked Bridenstine, according to a recording provided by Politico. \u201cAny way of going directly without landing on the Moon? Is that a possibility?\u201d\n\n\u201cAny way of going directly without landing on the Moon? Is that a possibility?\u201d\n\nBridenstine, who was standing to the right of the president in the Oval Office, replied that the Moon is a \u201cproving ground\u201d for going to Mars, allowing NASA to test out technologies needed for keeping people alive for extended periods of time on the Red Planet. \u201cWhen we go to Mars we\u2019re going to have to be there for a long period of time, so we need to learn how to live and work on another world,\u201d said Bridenstine.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s stated goal for deep space human exploration is to go to the Moon. The very first space policy directive that Trump signed in December of 2017 was to send people back to the Moon to establish a sustainable presence there. \u201cBeginning with missions beyond low-Earth orbit, the United States will lead the return of humans to the Moon for long-term exploration and utilization, followed by human missions to Mars and other destinations,\u201d the directive states.\n\nThe president and space experts talked about future Americans living and working on the moon during today's White House event marking the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11.\n\n\n\n\"That's a market,\" NASA chief Jim Bridenstine said. \"It could be for tourism. It could be for resources\" pic.twitter.com/GwbKaoVfgO \u2014 POLITICO (@politico) July 19, 2019\n\nSince then, NASA has been ratcheting up its plans for a human lunar return. In April, Vice President Mike Pence challenged NASA with sending humans back to the Moon by 2024, instead of 2028 like the agency had planned. NASA has since formed a program to meet this ambitious deadline called Artemis, which aims to send the first woman to the lunar surface and create a sustainable outpost near the Moon. In May, the Trump administration requested an additional $1.6 billion for NASA next year to jumpstart the Artemis program.\n\nBut as NASA has scrambled to meet Pence\u2019s call, Trump has become more vocal about his love for Mars in recent months. On June 7th, Trump tweeted that \u201cNASA should NOT be talking about going to the Moon,\u201d arguing we had already been there 50 years ago. \u201cThey should be focused on the much bigger things we are doing, including Mars (of which the Moon is a part), Defense and Science!,\u201d he wrote. At the time, the tweet created a lot of confusion given the administration\u2019s love for the Moon. But Bridenstine has repeatedly claimed since then that the Artemis program is staying the same.\n\n\u201cThe challenge is if we go direct to Mars, there\u2019s going to be a lot of things that we haven\u2019t yet proven out.\u201d\n\nTrump made his interest in Mars much clearer today, asking Bridenstine to explain NASA\u2019s Moon plans and why they were necessary. He asked Apollo 11 astronaut Michael Collins his thoughts, to which Collins replied, \u201cMars direct,\u201d indicating NASA should go straight to Mars and bypass the Moon altogether. \u201cIt seems to me Mars direct,\u201d Tump replied. \u201cI mean, who knows better than these people. They\u2019ve been doing this stuff for a long time. What about the concept of Mars direct?\u201d\n\nBridenstine explained: \u201cThe challenge is if we go direct to Mars, there\u2019s going to be a lot of things that we haven\u2019t yet proven out.\u201d Bridenstine went on to explain that the lunar surface contains water ice that could be mined and turned into rocket fuel, and NASA needs to practice using resources like this on other worlds.\n\n\u201cSo you feel that really landing on the Moon first and figuring it out and getting ready to launch \u2014 and you would like to, you really feel launching, you\u2019re essentially launching from the Moon to Mars?\u201d Trump asked.\n\n\u201cThe best way to think about it is we learn how to live and work on the Moon, but we launch to Mars from a space station that we have in orbit around the Moon \u2014 a space station we call Gateway,\u201d Bridenstine replied. Indeed, NASA has been planning to create a new space station in lunar orbit called the Gateway, an outpost for astronauts to travel to and from the surface of the Moon.\n\nWhile NASA\u2019s Artemis program is more or less intact, Bridenstine and the space agency have become much more vocal about Mars since Trump\u2019s tweet. The administrator has made it increasingly clear that the ultimate goal of going to the Moon is to get to Mars. He also told The Verge last week that NASA would be releasing a Mars plan in the coming months.", "description": "On July 19th, President Trump commemorated the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11 with a photo opportunity in the Oval Office, where he spent a lot of time questioning his administration\u2019s own policy for deep space human exploration.
