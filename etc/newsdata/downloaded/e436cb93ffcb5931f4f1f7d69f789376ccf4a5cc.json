In January of this year, I sent a message to my friend saying I wanted to finish Top 100, and at the time I was ranked, like, 800, so it was a far-fetched goal, but I\u2019m glad that I was able to accomplish it,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cMy other goal was to get in the main draw of two Grand Slams, and that happened, so I\u2019m glad that I accomplished everything that I wanted this year.\n\n\u201cA lot of my points came from the Slams and this tournament really pushed me inside, and it\u2019s crazy because I\u2019m a lucky loser\u2026 And now that this has happened, I hope to get as high as possible.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really think too much about ranking, but you have to have some stepping stones to reach for.\u201d\n\nGauff will face either top seed Kiki Bertens of the Netherlands or Belgium\u2019s Alison Van Uytvanck for a place in the Linz semi-finals.", "description": "Linz (Austria) (AFP) \u2013 American teenager Coco Gauff reached her maiden WTA quarter-final on Wednesday, assuring herself of a place in the world top", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/10/bf54a7_coco-gauff-eyes-ball-as-she-returns-kateryna-kozlova-gauff-15-reaches-wta-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
