It was up 0.5% versus the greenback for the session.\n\n\"The Prime Minister (Johnson) and Taoiseach (Varadkar) have had a detailed and constructive discussion,\" the joint statement said.\n\n\"Both continue to believe that a deal is in everybody's interest. They agreed that they could see a pathway to a possible deal.\"\n\nThe statement was also tweeted out from the Twitter account associated with the Irish leader Leo Varadkar.\n\nIreland is at the center of the Brexit debate because the United Kingdom has a land border on the Irish mainland between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland to the south. The Republic is to remain in the European Union while Northern Ireland would leave as it is part of the United Kingdom.\n\nErecting a physical border between the two is problematic as it would contravene a peace treaty, known as the Good Friday Agreement. This treaty was put in place to help end a decades-long war that pitted Northern Irish unionist groups and the British state against different factions of the Irish Republican Army (IRA).\n\nThe backstop is an arrangement whereby Northern Ireland remains in the customs union \u2014 a common tariff area \u2014 until a solution can be found to prevent any return of physical checks on the border.\n\nIncluding the Irish backstop in any U.K. withdrawal deal has drawn fire from opponents who see it as a means of trapping the U.K. within Europe.", "description": "U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson met with his Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar for further Brexit talks Thursday afternoon.", "authors": ["Matt Clinch"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106174667-1570717864939brexit.jpg?v=1570717888", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
