Garcia Bravado 2016; Bastgen Blauschiefer Riesling 2018. (Laura Chase de Formigny for The Washington Post)\n\nHere\u2019s an intriguing list of wines, from a familiar bargain bordeaux \u2014 our greatest value of the week \u2014 to a fascinating red blend from southern Chile that echoes to the time European grapes first arrived in the New World. We also have three whites to challenge your comfort zones: a crisp rioja, a fruity riesling and a fun bubbly gr\u00fcner veltliner.\n\nGREAT VALUE\n\nLaurence et Marc Pasquet, Ch\u00e2teau Mond\u00e9sir 2015/2016\n\nBlaye, Cotes de Bordeaux, France, $15\n\nHere\u2019s a chance to taste the present before it vanishes in the future. This wine is 100 percent merlot, the most widely planted red grape in Bordeaux, but one that faces a diminished role as growers adapt to a warming climate by favoring later-ripening varieties. I tasted the 2015, and the distributor has now moved on to the 2016, but both should be available in stores. The 2015 Mond\u00e9sir is deep in color and flavor, offering black cherries, a whiff of smoke and wild herbs with a savory mouthfeel. The wine tastes big at first as the power of the vintage comes through, but with a little time and air, the wine\u2019s finesse begins to unfurl. Organic. Alcohol by volume: 13.5 percent.\n\nImported and distributed by Elite: Available in the District at Rodman\u2019s, Paul\u2019s of Chevy Chase, S&R Liquors, Streets Market (14th Street). Available in Maryland at Fenwick Beer & Wine in Silver Spring; Red: Wine, Beer & Spirits in Clarksville; Wine Bin in Ellicott City. Available in Virginia at Once Upon a Vine (Stratford Hills) and Strawberry Street Vineyard in Richmond; Streets Market in Alexandria; Whole Foods Market (Ashburn, Fairlakes, Glen Allen, Reston, Springfield, Vienna).\n\nGREAT VALUE\n\nP.S. Garcia Bravado 2016\n\nItata Valley, Chile, $20\n\nI am touting this as one of my greatest values of the year, despite it touching the $20 limit for that designation and suffering from low availability. This beautiful wine hails from the Itata Valley in southern Chile, one of the first places Spanish missionaries planted grape vines in the 1500s. The blend is syrah, carignan, grenache, mourvedre and petit verdot, from vines planted more than a century ago. With that blend, you might expect a monster of a wine, but this is light in body and lifting in aroma, with Bing cherry, sagebrush and a saline character on the finish. It\u2019s a bit cerebral; it wants your attention. And, if you decant it an hour or more before dinner and hold back some for the next evening, your patience will be rewarded. ABV: 14.5 percent.\n\nImported by Vine Connections, distributed by Bacchus: Available in the District at Grand Cata, Rodman\u2019s. Available in Maryland at Crescent Beer & Wine in Bowie, Shawan Liquors in Cockeysville, Wine Merchant in Lutherville.\n\nGREAT VALUE\n\nCVNE Monopole 2018\n\nRioja, Spain, $16\n\nRioja\u2019s whites may be among wine\u2019s best-kept secrets. This delightful version, mainly from the viura grape, is crisp and refreshing, with hints of quince, star fruit and straw. Enjoy this on its own or with tapas and lighter seafood dishes. ABV: 13 percent.\n\nImported by Arano, distributed by Elite: Available in the District at the Bottle Shop, Calvert Woodley, Chevy Chase Wine & Spirits, Dixie Liquor, Eye Street Cellars, MacArthur Beverages, Modern Liquors, Morris Miller Wine & Liquor, Paul\u2019s of Chevy Chase, Potomac Wine & Spirits, Rodman\u2019s, Watergate Vintners & Spirits, Wide World of Wines.

Vernon in Baltimore, Friendship Wine & Liquor in Abingdon, Goska\u2019s Liquors in Severna Park, Highland Wine & Spirits in Highland, Kenilworth Wine & Spirits in Towson, Knowles Station Wine & Co. in Kensington, Red: Wine, Beer & Spirits and Vintage Cellars in Clarksville.

I want people to know how delicious the wine is, how versatile with food, and to experience its innate ability to induce a smile. Instead, people \u2014 without trying it \u2014 scrunch their faces into prunes and say, \u201cRiesling is too sweet.\u201d On the other hand, the riesling-lover in me says, \u201cOh well, more for the rest of us!\u201d The Bastgen Blauschiefer (a reference to \u201cblue slate\u201d vineyard soils) bursts with flavors of apricot and nectarine, the fruitiness often mistaken for sweetness. There is a hint of sweetness here, but it is nicely balanced by acidity, allowing the fruit to shine. ABV: 11.5 percent.\n\nImported and distributed by Kysela: Available in the District at Calvert Woodley, Craft Beer Cellar, Crown Liquor, Magruder\u2019s, Rodman\u2019s. Available in Maryland at Antietam Spirits in Boonsboro, Bo Brooks Lighthouse Liquors in Baltimore, Columbia Fine Wine & Spirits in Columbia, Friendship Wine & Liquor in Abingdon, Wine Cellars of Annapolis. Available in Virginia at the Caboose Market & Cafe in Ashland, German Gourmet in Falls Church, Greenwood Gourmet Grocery in Winchester, Kroger (Chesapeake, Roanoke), Whole Foods Market in Alexandria, the Wine\u2019ing Butcher in Ashburn.\n\nHugl Weine Sparkling Gr\u00fcner Veltliner\n\nAustria, $22\n\nHugl makes nice ros\u00e9 and bargain-priced gr\u00fcner, and that carries over into this bubbly version. My first impression was cider, as the wine smelled prominently of freshly pressed apples. Some stone-fruit flavors emerge on the palate, helping turn any occasion into a late-summer celebration. Consider this for sparkling cocktails, spritzers or just a fun aperitif. ABV: 13 percent.\n\nImported and distributed by Kysela: Available in the District at Cleveland Park Wine and Spirits, Magruder\u2019s. Available in Maryland at Dulaney Wines & Spirits in Towson, the Winery in Chester. Available in Virginia at Back Bays Farmhouse Brewing in Virginia Beach, Locke Store in Millwood, Kelsick Specialty Market in Gloucester, the Wine\u2019ing Butcher in Ashburn.\n\nAvailability information is based on distributor records.
