Whether it\u2019s a classic pair of black boots or something a bit bolder, finding your perfect shoes is the best way to mark the new season.\n\nIn our search for the best boots, we wanted to balance cost, quality, style and practicality. While some items can seem like the most important purchase of your life in store, trends come and go, and when you\u2019re investing in boots for several seasons to come it helps to be picky.\n\nBoots are supposed to protect you from the elements, but it doesn\u2019t hurt to look good while doing it.\n\nIt might seem like an impossible feat, but we scoured the high street and online shops to find you the best autumn boots of the season.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

We were instantly drawn to this western-inspired pair, which are not only bang on trend but surprisingly comfortable. The heel comes up at two inches tall but is blocky and gentle on your feet, even during the longest of days. These are a versatile choice and our tester loved how they gave even the simplest of outfits an edge. It doesn\u2019t hurt that they\u2019re so purse-friendly, either.\n\nBuy now\n\nDr Martens 1460 pascal virginia mono: \u00a3139, Dr Martens\n\nYou might balk at the price, but Dr Martens are an investment for years to come, not just this season. Not only do they go with literally anything, but the brand\u2019s trademark air-cushioned sole technology leaves feet comfy all day long, and thanks to years of perfected craftsmanship, they\u2019ll also be dry after the heaviest of autumn showers. While any pair of Dr Martens are a safe bet, we particularly love this pascal style. These are made of a softer, slightly thinner real leather than the classic boots, which are notoriously difficult to wear in. Our tester found that these were immediately wearable as a result.\n\nBuy now\n\nI Saw It First black croc western ankle boots: \u00a330, I Saw It First\n\nComing up slightly higher on the ankle than the other entries on the list, these boots have a glossy, croc-style finish that is wipe-clean and impermeable to wet weather. They\u2019re easy to dress up and down, as well as accomplishing that rare feat of looking good with both skirts and trousers. However, we\u2019d recommend sizing up, as our tester found that they pinched slightly in her regular size.\n\nBuy now\n\nCharles and Keith embellished block heel ankle boots: \u00a369, Charles and Keith\n\nYou can never go wrong with a pair of black ankle boots, which makes this pearly pair even more of a necessary purchase. Our tester loved the block heel, as well as the soft cushioning on the soles. Versatile without being boring, they\u2019re a simple twist on a wardrobe classic. Although pointed toes can often pinch toes after a few hours, we were impressed by how quickly these moulded to our feet, and have since delegated them our boots of choice for a night out.\n\nBuy now\n\nTommy Hilfiger sock heel boots: \u00a3120, Tommy Hilfiger\n\nIt took us a while to come around to the sock-heel trend, but this pair changed our perspective. These boots are snug and warm for those darker nights, and versatile enough to make the transition from day to night. They\u2019re a bit of a struggle to slip into at first, but well worth the effort - we would suggest going up a half a size to make it easier.\n\nBuy now\n\nNew Look lace detail chunky flat hiker boots: \u00a329.99, Asos\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for an alternative to your everyday trainers, these boots are destined to become your new favourite. With a round toe, chunky sole and padded interior, they\u2019re designed for all-round comfort. Our tester paired them with jeans for a day of constant rain and was impressed by how they fared \u2013 she was also grateful for the side-zip, which made them all the easier to kick off at the end of the day.\n\nBuy now\n\nPublic Desire heidi snakeskin block heeled western ankle boots: \u00a339.99, Public Desire\n\nThe snake print trend is going nowhere anytime soon (except straight into our wardrobe). Public Desire offer these boots in three shades, but we loved this bold, pink pair which brightens up the usually neutral autumn palette. They take a bit of wearing in but our tester fared surprisingly well after wearing these all day, despite the four inch heel. However, those with wider feet may find that they\u2019re a bit tight across the arches of your feet.\n\nBuy now\n\nKoi Footwear gin jewelled platform military boots: \u00a342, Koi Footwear\n\nThese are Koi\u2019s best-selling boots, with the addition of jewels on the laces to spice things up for the new season. Thanks to the platform, these boots give you all the height with none of the pain. While they\u2019re lace-up at the front, there\u2019s a handy hidden zip on the side for ease of wear. Added bonus: they\u2019re animal-friendly.\n\nBuy now\n\nAsos Design Ellen chunky lace up boots: \u00a340, Asos\n\nLace-up, heeled boots are all the rage right now and Asos has done what Asos does best with this on-trend but affordable pair. They\u2019re easy to keep clean thanks to their patent finish, but the elasticated inserts make sure that they slip on just as well. As the weather gets colder and wetter (and, inevitably, slippier), these boots also have you covered with their moulded tread, which gives them a better grip. Available in up to a size 10 and in a wide-fit edition, Asos has covered all bases here.\n\nBuy now\n\nEGO monterey block heel ankle boot: \u00a339.99, EGO\n\nThis roundup wouldn\u2019t be complete without some autumnal shades, and we love this mustard yellow pair from EGO. The four inch heel takes some adjustment, but we loved how easily these boots brightened up our outfit, and those averse to laces will appreciate the subtle side zip. Our tester was sceptical at first of how these boots would maintain their brightness, but the synthetic leather is easy to wipe clean.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Ankle boots\n\nWhen it comes to style, comfort and value for money, we love Topshop\u2019s bliss western boots. However, if you\u2019re looking to make a wardrobe investment, Dr Martens 1460 pascal virginia mono boots will see you through months to come.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
