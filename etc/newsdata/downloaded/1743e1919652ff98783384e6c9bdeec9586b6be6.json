We have no knowledge of our suppliers ever engaging in this behaviour.\u201d Kora Organics said in a statement. \u201cNevertheless, our only product that contained goat milk is a soap and it has been discontinued.\u201d\n\nIn addition to no longer using goat milk, Kora Organics is a strictly cruelty-free company, and is almost entirely vegan (apart from two products which contain beeswax). The company is even backed by PETA and carries their logo on packaging.\n\nThe footage is pretty terrifying nonetheless, showing the process of how male goats are slaughtered because they can\u2019t produce milk.\n\n\u201cNo male animal is ever going to produce milk, only mothers do for their babies, and so almost all male animals are slaughtered just after their birth,\u201d Ms Hakansson said. \u201cMost of the females are used to breed, but when mothers no longer produce milk at an efficient rate, they\u2019re slaughtered as well.\n\nSpecific numbers are hard to gauge due to a lack of records, but 17 animals were killed during the three-day filming period.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why in the dead pile at the end of the footage, you can see both adults and babies.\u201d\n\nThe ALV aims to target a different brand every week as part of their campaign against using dairy in products, but here\u2019s hoping they do a little more research before their next call out.\n\n\u201cWe want to encourage people to make kinder choices. There are plant-based soaps, vegan cheeses, vegan milk \u2014 plenty of things that you can purchase that don\u2019t support this kind of cruelty.\u201d", "description": "Miranda Kerr's Kora Organics skincare and beauty brand has been wrongfully targeted by animal rights activists despite not using goat milk.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1080688264-e1571986455309.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
