Harris Distinguished Service Professor at the University of Chicago (file photo) failed to control for the variation in the subjects' countries in his paper\n\nWHAT WAS THE 'STUPID MISTAKE'? Professor Jean Decety's paper, titled The Negative Association Between Religiousness And Children's Altruism Across The World, had initially claimed children of devout religious parents exhibit less altruistic behaviour. But after reexamining his paper after a slew of scientists heaped pressure on him by criticising the research method, Professor Decety backpedalled his claims. He said: 'We found that country of origin, rather than religious affiliation, is the primary predictor of several of the outcomes.' The error in the scientists' method was to treat each country as a single continuous variable, which meant that they were not controlled for. Each country was given a number code, for example, 'Canada was 1, the US was 2'. These codes were supposed to be meaningless, but in their calculations the scientists treated them as variables, meaning the US was double the value of Canada. This significantly skewed the results.\n\nBut after reexamining his paper after a slew of scientists heaped pressure on him by criticising the research method, Professor Decety backpedalled his claims.\n\nHe said: 'We found that country of origin, rather than religious affiliation, is the primary predictor of several of the outcomes.'\n\nThe error in the scientists' method was to treat each country as a single continuous variable, which meant that they were not controlled for.\n\nMore than 1,000 children aged between five and 12 from the US, Canada, Jordan, Turkey, South Africa and China formed the sample.\n\nThe research selected children from these countries because it provided an eclectic mix of Christians, Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists and non-religious people.\n\nTo ensure religious upbringing, and not one's country, was the independent variable, Professor Decety and team had to control for their participants' nationalities.\n\nBut shortly after the paper was published, Dr Azim Shariff, based at the University of California, noted that this had not been done correctly.\n\nThe countries had been coded from one to six, but they were treated as a single categorical variables so, for example, Canada - coded two - was twice as much as the US, which was coded one.\n\nProfessor Decety's paper had initially claimed that a children of devout religious parents exhibit less altruistic behaviour. But after reexamining his paper he backpedalled his claims and requested the paper be withdrawn (right)\n\nWhen approached by Retraction Watch about the withdrawal, Professor Decety shrugged it off as a 'stupid mistake on our part! Not intentional for sure'.\n\nHe had initially measured altruism in the children via a version of the 'Dictator Game' in which they were given 10 stickers and provided an opportunity to share them with another unseen child.\n\nThis retraction came only a year after a Psychological Medicine journal paper exploring psychopathic traits in prisoners which Professor Decety co-authored was also withdrawn.", "description": "Professor Jean Decety of the University of Chicago has been forced to retract his report four years after it was first published in the Current Biology journal.", "authors": ["Jack Elsom For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/16/19446236-0-image-a-12_1570548346268.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
