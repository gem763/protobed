A \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint that Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son Hunter in exchange for aid triggered the ongoing impeachment probe.\n\nSaturday\u2019s testimony from Philip Reeker, the acting assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, is expected to mark the third time that an impeachment inquiry witness suggests there was no effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate Biden.\n\nFormer U.S. Special Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker and American Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland told investigators they were not involved in any effort to push for an investigation of Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. \u2018\n\nVolker and Sondland were heavily involved in America\u2019s Ukraine policy.\n\nHouse impeachment investigators subpoenaed Reeker after the State Department reportedly attempted to block his testimony behind closed doors in a rare Saturday session.\n\nCNN revealed:\n\nActing Assistant Secretary of State Philip Reeker was expected to testify in the impeachment inquiry on Saturday that he did not find out there was a push by Trump administration officials for Ukraine to publicly announce investigations into Vice President Joe Biden and the 2016 election until the whistleblower complaint was made public, a source familiar with his testimony told CNN.\n\nThe \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint became public on September 26.\n\nTo the dismay of Democrats, the CNN source indicated that Reeker will not confirm explosive allegations made by Acting Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor during his deposition earlier this week.\n\nIn his opening remarks, Taylor testified that the Trump administration \u201cconditioned\u201d U.S. aid to Ukraine on the president of the Eastern European country announcing an investigation into Biden and his son.\n\nHunter Biden, the former vice president\u2019s son, served on the board of directors of Burisman Holdings, a Ukrainian company linked to corruption.\n\nRepublican lawmakers said Taylor\u2019s claim \u201ccollapsed\u201d when he members of Congress questioned during his deposition.\n\nEchoing Reeker, Volker told lawmakers there was no push for Ukraine to investigate Biden.\n\n\u201cAt no time was I aware of or took part in an effort to urge Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Biden,\u201d Volker said in his opening remarks.\n\nSondland added in his written testimony:\n\nI recall no discussions with any State Department or White House official about Former Vice President Biden or his son, nor do I recall taking part in any effort to encourage an investigation into the Bidens.\n\n\u2026 Withholding foreign aid in order to pressure a foreign government to take such steps [influence a U.S. election] would be wrong. I did not and would not ever participate in such undertakings.\n\nAlthough House Democrats have conducted all the impeachment probe proceedings in private so far, the media have managed to obtain opening remarks of some of the witnesses.\n\nRepublicans have accused Democrats of leaking bits and pieces of information to fuel their impeachment agenda.\n\nDemocrats say they will eventually open the proceedings to the public, but will not say when.", "description": "A top U.S. State Dept official was unaware of an alleged push by Trump administration for Ukraine to launch an investigation into Joe Biden.", "authors": ["Edwin Mora"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Phillip-Reeker-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
