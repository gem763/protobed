Apple said it employs 443 dreamers, or people that DACA protects from deportation.\n\nThe Trump administration's effort to undo DACA is part of a broader effort to restrict immigration, whether it's through family separation at the U.S.-Mexico border or the imposition of a travel ban from several majority Muslim countries to the U.S. DACA and other immigration topics remain a national focus and are likely to be core issues during the 2020 presidential campaign.\n\nDACA deportations could cost the US economy over $400 billion, according to a 2017 study. Amazon, Facebook, Google and Microsoft also oppose Trump's policies.\n\nThe Supreme Court said in June that it will hear arguments in three cases over the legality of the administration's decision to end DACA \u2014 the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. The cases are scheduled to be argued on Nov. 12, and a decision is expected to be public by June. Lower courts rejected the administration's previous attempts to end the program.\n\nApple said in its brief that the company wouldn't exist without immigration and that co-founder Steve Jobs is the son of an immigrant. The company said it's morally wrong to deport immigrants who followed U.S. policy and achieved DACA status.", "description": "The filing shares several stories of current Apple employees who are affected by the Trump administration's move to abolish DACA.", "authors": ["Kif Leswing"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105227222-20160502-2304-2152.jpg?v=1527100529"}
