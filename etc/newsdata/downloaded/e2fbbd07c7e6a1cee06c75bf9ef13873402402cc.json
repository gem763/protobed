He was wearing a clear mask in an effort to protect his face, but appeared to bump into Lakers guard Rajon Rondo while playing defense just 1:06 into the contest.\n\nIrving\u2019s face made contact with Rondo\u2019s upper arm. The Nets guard immediately winced in pain, took the mask off and motioned to the bench that he needed a substitute.\n\nThe Nets said Irving would not return to the game.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Brooklyn guard Kyrie Irving left the team's preseason game against the Los Angeles Lakers about one minute after tip-off after taking a hit to the face.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/10/sesi_franca_nets_basketball_63261_c0-184-4395-2746_s1770x1032.jpg?988970bfbd772ce6f40cdf787ee59682ab687c46", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
