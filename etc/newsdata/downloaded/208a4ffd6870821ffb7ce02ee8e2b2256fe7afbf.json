(Photo by Austin McAfee/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)\n\nLooking for a second straight top-10 upset, South Carolina had a lead entering the fourth quarter against No. 9 Florida but ended up losing 38-27.\n\nAnd the Gamecocks fans in attendance were not at all happy about the way the game was officiated. There were some questionable calls in the first half, but the play that really got the fans riled up came early in the third quarter.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nSouth Carolina opened the half by taking a 17-10 lead, but Florida promptly responded with a 75-yard touchdown run by Dameon Pierce. Two flags potentially could have been thrown on Florida on the play \u2014 but there was one penalty that was undoubtedly missed.\n\nAs the ball was snapped, it was clear that right tackle Jean Delance moved early. The play should have been whistled for a false start.\n\nAnd as Pearce sprinted down the right sideline, Florida receiver Tyrie Cleveland was with him every step of the way and blocking Israel Mukuamu down the field. But Cleveland seemed to have a healthy hold of Mukuamu\u2019s uniform as they ran down the field. No flag was thrown though, and Pearce\u2019s touchdown tied the game at 17-17.\n\nAnnnd Just like that, Florida ties the game!!!!

A diving 25-yard touchdown catch by Freddie Swain gave Florida a 24-20 lead before a South Carolina fumble gave the ball right back to the UF offense.\n\nPenalty wipes out South Carolina INT\n\nIt looked like the Gamecocks\u2019 defense would bail out the offense when Jaycee Horn came down with a diving interception in the end zone, but there was a flag. Horn was penalized for holding, taking the interception off the board and giving UF a first down.\n\nIt was the correct call. Horn clearly grabbed hold of Van Jefferson\u2019s facemask before making the interception.\n\n(via ESPN)\n\nBut South Carolina fans weren\u2019t happy and ended up throwing towels and trash onto the field in protest.\n\n(via ESPN)\n\nMissed offensive pass interference leads to UF TD\n\nSouth Carolina fans were about to get much more upset. On the next play, Kyle Trask hit Kyle Pitts for a Florida touchdown, and the officials missed a pretty blatant offensive pass interference penalty on the Gators.\n\n(via ESPN)\n\nJosh Hammond was blocking a South Carolina defender before the pass even left Trask\u2019s hand, but no flag was thrown and the Florida lead extended to 31-20.\n\nSouth Carolina coach Will Muschamp was understandably furious, and gave the officials an earful.\n\n(via ESPN)\n\nLater in the fourth, Muschamp was so mad that he was hit with an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty as the Gators closed out a victory. After the game, Muschamp said the penalty he received was \u201cgutless.\u201d\n\nMuschamp on the unsportsmanlike penalty: \"I\u2019m not going to comment about anything else. Don\u2019t go 40 yards away and drop the flag. Drop it at my feet.\"\n\n\n\nThen shakes his head and says, \"Gutless.\" \u2014 David Cloninger (@DCPandC) October 19, 2019\n\nSouth Carolina was on the heels of a massive upset over Georgia, but could not shock the SEC in back-to-back weeks. The Gamecocks dropped to 3-4 with the loss.\n\nOn the other side, Florida rebounded nicely from last week\u2019s loss to LSU, the team\u2019s first of the season. The Gators improved to 7-1 with the win. And after a bye week, they will host Georgia in a game that could decide the SEC East.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Upset with the officiating, South Carolina fans threw trash onto the field in protest.", "authors": ["Sam Cooper"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/qvSXSBKLkZ_7xcViXTfmCQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTExNzg7aD01ODY-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/jmaMyl5jdkOAYYzRMPmuRQ--~B/aD0yOTM7dz01ODk7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/8e37e9c0-f2a7-11e9-9dfe-d732d15baf30", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
