That is Theresa May stamping her feet and saying, \u2018I want this, no one else is allowed to do anything.\u2019\n\n\u201cNo wonder she is in trouble. She is out of control. She is not listening to anyone. No one knows what it is that she is going to do next. I think her judgement has been undermined.\u201d\n\nShe told Sky News\u2019 Sophy Ridge on Sunday that it was \u201clikely\u201d Britain would leave the EU under a Labour government, although there was a strong case for a second referendum.\n\nThe Independent has been campaigning for a Final Say vote, which has attracted the backing of more than 1.2m people.", "description": "Tom Watson has said\u00a0a second referendum is\u00a0the \u201conly way\u201d\u00a0to unite the country\u00a0and\u00a0it would be \u201cinconceivable\u201d to not include the plan in\u00a0a Labour\u00a0election manifesto.
