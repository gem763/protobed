USA TODAY\n\nNo one was surprised Monday when the New York Jets traded Leonard Williams.\n\nThe destination? Well, that was a bit of a shocker.\n\nWilliams is headed to the New York Giants.\n\nAccording to ESPN, it\u2019s the first time the cross-town rivals have ever made a trade. And it is a big one.\n\nWilliams has been one of the biggest faces of the Jets\u2019 defense for the last four-plus years. And while his production never lived up to his draft pick \u2014 the No. 6 overall selection in 2016 with just 17 sacks in 71 career games \u2014 he was respected by his teammates, coaches and opponents for impacting the game in ways that don\u2019t show up on the stat sheet.\n\nIt\u2019s also a symbolic move. It\u2019s the first major transaction by Jets general manager Joe Douglas, and with it, he moved on from former GM Mike Maccagnan\u2019s first-ever draft pick. Remarkably, none of the seven players from that 2015 Maccagnan draft remain on the team.\n\nThis is a new start for the Jets. And this was a good deal. Here\u2019s why:\n\nWhy it makes sense\n\nAnyone who has watched the Jets this season knows they have massive holes all over their roster. Douglas needs ammo to fill those holes, both long-term and short-term. So this was a deal that had to get done.\n\nAccording to multiple reports, the Jets are getting the Giants\u2019 third-round pick in 2020 and a 2021 fifth-round pick. ESPN reports that the fifth-round pick could become a fourth-round pick if Williams signs an extension with the Giants before the start of the new league year and that the Jets picked up $4 million of Williams\u2019 remaining $6 million salary this year.\n\nNew York Jets defensive end Leonard Williams (92) celebrates during the second half against the Buffalo Bills at MetLife Stadium.

And while losing Williams hurts the defense, the Jets\u2019 defensive line is their deepest position group on the roster.\n\nThey already had nearly $16 million of their cap in 2020 committed to Quinnen Williams and Henry Anderson, and some young lineman who have shown potential, including Kyle Phillips, Folorunso Fatukasi and Jordan Willis.\n\nEven if the Jets were good, it wouldn\u2019t have made a ton of sense to keep Williams and pay him big money. But with their massive struggles, trading him was a no-brainer.\n\nAnd the Giants provided a package that gave the Jets the market value they needed. A year ago, the Rams sent a third- and a fifth-round pick to the Jaguars for Dante Fowler, Jr.\n\nBlow to the locker room\n\nThe dejection in the Jets' locker room was palpable after they fell to 1-6 on Sunday in Jacksonville. Jamal Adams was as downtrodden as he's ever been after a loss.\n\n\"We're 1-6, man,\" said Adams, who is 10-29 in two-plus seasons with the Jets. \"It\u2019s been three years. It\u2019s frustrating. I just want to win.\"\n\nDealing Williams isn't going to help. There is no argument for this deal making the Jets better in the short-term. It doesn't. And that's going to be a big blow for a prideful group of players who are already frustrated after losing seven of their first eight games -- and for many of them who were here last year, 15 out of their last 17.\n\nEven before Williams was traded, Adam Gase was going to have a tough job keeping the locker room together. This move was necessary, but it won't make things any easier.\n\nMajor intrigue\n\nIt's a heck of a time for the first-ever trade between these two franchises: The Jets play the Giants next weekend. And the prospect of Williams going up against his former team makes an already-intriguing game between these two struggling teams that much more irresistible.\n\nCan Williams use his knowledge against the Jets' horrible offensive line to have a breakout game? Will he notch his first sacks of the season against Sam Darnold? And now the Jets have extra incentive to beat the Giants because the worse their record the better the Jets' draft pick is in 2020.\n\nIt's always fun when these two teams play. But this game just got even more juice.", "description": "No one was surprised when the Jets traded Leonard Williams.
