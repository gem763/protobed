Disgruntled shareholders contend Tesla directors rolled over when Musk pushed to buy the renewable-energy company. Musk was SolarCity\u2019s chairman and largest shareholder at the time and his cousin was the chief executive officer.\n\n\u201cIf I did not take everyone off of solar and focus them on the Model 3 program to the detriment of solar, then Tesla would have gone bankrupt,\u201d Musk said in a June pre-trial deposition made public in state court in Delaware. \u201cSo I took everyone from solar, and said: \u2018instead of working on solar, you need to work on the Model 3 program.\u2019 And as a result, solar suffered, as you would expect.\u201d\n\nPension funds opposing the SolarCity buyout say in court papers Musk should have told them Tesla was in no condition in 2016 to buy a US$2 billion company and that it would be forced to rely on that firm\u2019s manpower to keep Tesla afloat.\n\nTesla now has roughly 400,000 solar customers, one of the U.S.\u2019s biggest renewable-energy portfolios. But Walmart Inc. sued Tesla in August, saying the company\u2019s rooftop panel systems caused fires at their stores and warehouses. Tesla has also reached out to homeowners across the U.S. to tell them their solar systems need preventative maintenance.\n\nTesla\u2019s rooftop solar business increased for the first time in a year, the company said during its most recent earnings report Oct. 23. Tesla deployed 43 megawatts of solar in the third quarter, a 48 per cent jump from the previous three months.\n\nIn its earnings report last week, the electric-car maker said it earned US$1.86 a share, surprising Wall Street. Musk delivered several positive updates: the company\u2019s new factory in China is on track and the Model Y crossover SUV will launch earlier than expected. Tesla shares, which had languished for much of 2019, closed Tuesday at US$316.22 and are down just 3.5 per cent for the year.\n\nMusk acknowledged in the June 1 deposition \u2014 unsealed Oct. 25 \u2014 that he probably wouldn\u2019t support the SolarCity acquisition again given the stress Tesla faced from the Model 3 push.\n\n\u201cAt the time I thought it made strategic sense for Tesla and SolarCity to combine. Hindsight is 20/20,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if I could wind back the clock, you know, I would say probably would have let SolarCity execute by itself; would have let Tesla execute by itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I just didn\u2019t realize how difficult it would be to do the Model 3 program,\u201d Musk added. \u201cAnd so that was just a big distraction and sort of offset a lot of things by more than a year, year and a half maybe.\u201d\n\nTo deal with that internal stress, Musk said scores of SolarCity employees \u2014 from engineering, management, sales and service \u2014 were transferred to the Model 3, the first electric car Tesla sought to produce in high volume. Some of the SolarCity workers were deployed to Tesla\u2019s retail stores and delivered cars to customers, according to Musk\u2019s deposition.\n\nTesla delivered a record 97,000 vehicles in the third quarter and the company\u2019s surprise profit gives the company some breathing room. Executives have begun talking up the energy side of its business again.\n\nLast Friday, Musk held a conference call focused on \u201cVersion 3\u201d of the company\u2019s solar roof product, which was first revealed three years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s been quite hard,\u201d Musk said. \u201cRoofs need to last a long time. When you add electrification to the roof, it\u2019s a fair bit of complexity.\u201d\n\nThe 48-year-old Musk, who has had his share of run-ins with lawyers over the years, got particularly combative with Randy Baron, a California-based lawyer for Tesla shareholders challenging the wisdom of the SolarCity acquisition. They\u2019ve sued the company\u2019s board in Delaware Chancery Court.\n\nAt one point, Musk calls Baron \u201creprehensible\u201d because the lawyer \u2014 according to the Tesla CEO \u2014 questioned whether SolarCity was a viable entity and the validity of sustainable energy as a whole.\n\n\u201cYou seem like a very, very bad person. Just a bad human being,\u201d Musk said in the deposition. \u201cAnd I hope you come to regret your actions in the future, but you probably won\u2019t. And that\u2019s sad.\u201d\n\nWhen Baron questioned whether Musk\u2019s push for the SolarCity deal amounted to a bailout, the executive snapped again and told the lawyer he was \u201ca shameful person.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo bail out SolarCity was good for the world you\u2019re telling us?\u201d Baron asked. \u201cAdvancing solar is absolutely good for the world,\u201d Musk shot back. \u201cDo you just think about money? What is your purpose in life?\u201d\n\nAt another point in the deposition, Musk defended the SolarCity acquisition and accused Baron and other investors\u2019 lawyers of \u201cbarking up the wrong tree.\u201d\n\n\u201cSolarCity would have done just fine by itself and Tesla would have done just fine by itself, but in the long-term, they are better together. And that is what the future will show. That is why I think you should stop wasting your time now.\u201d\n\nThe case is set for trial before Delaware Chancery Judge Joseph Slights III in March 2020, according to Tesla\u2019s securities filings. Slights will hear the case without a jury.\n\nThe case is In Re Tesla Motors Inc. Stockholders Litigation, No. 12711, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "Scores of SolarCity employees \u2014 from engineering, management, sales and service \u2014 were transferred to the Model 3", "authors": ["Jef Feeley", "Dana Hull", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/elon-musk-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
