He went on to note that Trump had also raised concerns over \u201ccorruption that related to the [Democratic National Committee] server,\u201d a reference to a debunked conspiracy theory positing that Ukraine was behind the 2016 hacking of Democratic Party emails. The American intelligence community has said it believes Russia was the culprit.\n\nShortly after Mulvaney\u2019s stunning admission, he released a statement walking back the remarks and claiming there was no quid pro quo even though he previously asserted that \u201cwe do that all the time with foreign policy.\u201d\n\nPressed by Stephanopoulos to recognize Mulvaney\u2019s candid and public description of a quid pro quo, Pompeo avoided making any comment.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll leave it to the chief of staff to explain what it is he said and what he intended,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president and his defenders have repeatedly claimed that no quid pro quo occurred when Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in July. However, a rough transcript of the call shows that Trump pressured him to \u201cdo us a favor\u201d and investigate both the DNC server and former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nA whistleblower complaint that cites the discussion alleges that Trump was attempting to solicit interference in the 2020 election by targeting his potential Democratic opponent. Ukraine has found no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of the Bidens, though Trump continues to raise unsubstantiated corruption accusations against the family.", "description": "The secretary of state stuck with the White House's messaging following the acting chief of staff's candid acknowledgment of the deal in a press briefing.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5dac8a02210000131934a7de.jpeg?cache=rmoghbkpoa&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
