The pound plummeted to monthly lows versus the euro and the dollar in the previous session, on rumours that Brexit talks were on the verge on collapse. Today the pound is rebounded versus the weaker dollar but has failed to hold onto those early gains.\n\nSterling spiked after the Times reported that the EU are willing to put a time limit on the Irish backstop. However, the spike was short lived after the DUP rejected the concession\n\nWhilst Boris has been playing the blame game with the EU, the PM has also made plans to meet with Irish PM Leo Varadkar at the end of the week. This is looking like a last-ditch attempt and is keeping the pound around $1.22 after yesterday\u2019s very public spat with the EU.\n\nPound traders assuming an extension?\n\nWith three weeks to go until Brexit, the pound is hovering around $1.2200. At these levels there is a sense that Brexit is not going to happen, at lest not yet, regardless of Boris Johnson\u2019s do or die rhetoric. According to Bloomberg a gauge for UK currency market sentiment for the next week is at the highest level for four months \u2013 is this because traders are assuming Boris Johnson will be forced to seek an extension?\n\nPound trades will continue to jump from headline to headline.\n\nTrade & Fed for the dollar\n\nOn the other side of the equation expectations are low for the 13th round of US - Sino trade talk as actions from both sides suggest any truce could be a way off. The FOMC minutes are due later today, however we expect them to play second fiddle to trade talk headlines.\n\nLevels to watch\n\nDespite today\u2019s spike, the pair trades below its 50, 100 and 200 SMA, with bearish momentum. Support can be seen at $1.22 prior to $1.2155. A break through here could see the pair drop towards $1.21.\n\nOn the upside, resistance can found at $1.2270, $1.2345 before $1.2390.\n\nLevels To Watch GDP/USD\n\n\"Disclaimer: The information and opinions in this report are for general information use only and are not intended as an offer or solicitation with respect to the purchase or sale of any currency or CFD contract.
