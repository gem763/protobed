Though sales at the space unit were up 5%, the 11.5% profit margin at the space unit was unchanged from last year.\n\nLockheed\u2019s net income rose to $1.61 billion, or $5.66 per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 29, from $1.47 billion, or $5.14 per share, a year earlier.\n\nNet sales rose to $15.17 billion from $14.32 billion.\n\nThe company delivered 28 F-35 combat jets in the quarter, compared with 20 a year earlier.\n\nDuring the second quarter, Lockheed delivered 29 F-35s. So far this year, the company has delivered 83 of the jets, out of a total expected for the year of 131.\n\nLockheed\u2019s income tax rate was 9.7% in the third quarter, compared to 6.5% in the third quarter of 2018.", "description": "Lockheed Martin Corp raised its estimate for 2019 earnings on Tuesday as quarterly profit climbed 9.2% amid improved sales of its F-35 fighter jets, but shares fell in premarket trading after it forecast lower cash flow next year.", "authors": ["Mike Stone", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443721081&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L0ZI", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
