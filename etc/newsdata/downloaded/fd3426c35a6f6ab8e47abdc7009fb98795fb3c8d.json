'So if we introduce a third competition where clubs are losing money, then it will be counter-productive.'\n\n'We have said all along that we acknowledge and think it is fine to introduce a third level of competition,' he added. 'It was only yesterday that the clubs said they had concerns, so we have to check whether they think they are right or not.'\n\nThe new 32-team competition will be a third tier competition in European football\n\nOlsson reiterated that the European Leagues were opposed to any change in the format of UEFA competitions which would involve teams playing more European matches at the expense of domestic ones.\n\nThis could put it on a collision course with the European Club Association (ECA), headed by Juventus president Andrea Agnelli, which says it wants more European matches for more clubs.\n\n'We are of the opinion that there is no room in the calendar for any more matches and we are not in favour of reducing the number of teams in the domestic competitions,' said Olsson.\n\n'We think the decision on how the leagues should be structured is a domestic matter... it is not something which should be decided by an international body,' he said. 'So we think the number of matches are okay as they are today.'", "description": "The European Leagues, which represents the continent's national leagues, hosted a meeting in London on Thursday which it said featured 201 clubs to discuss the future of UEFA competitions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/17/19892912-0-image-a-11_1571415666606.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
