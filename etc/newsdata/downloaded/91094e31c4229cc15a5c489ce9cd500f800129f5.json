The service is free to users and is available in 13 cities, including New York, Washington and Los Angeles. The broadcasters have taken issue with this and joined together in July to sue Locast for copyright violations. Their lawsuit named Locast founder David Goodfriend and his non-profit advocacy group, Sports Fans Coalition NY, Inc., which operates the service as the defendants.\n\nLocast denied the allegation in its countersuit filed on Thursday in the Federal District Court of Manhattan, citing its distinction as a non-profit. Goodfriend launched Locast in January 2018 within a non-profit entity, which the case argues, grants it the legal right to rebroadcast local stations without receiving a copyright license from broadcast networks.\n\n\"Plaintiffs have colluded and misused copyrights to expand their market power beyond what those copyrights were intended to protect. The pay TV providers get rich. Plaintiffs get rich. The public gets fleeced,\" the lawsuit read.\n\nLocast's lawsuit used YouTube TV as an example of a company affected by the networks' alleged collusion. The case cites an April meeting between executives at YouTube TV, Google's paid streaming service, and Locast. The YouTube executives allegedly said if YouTube TV provided access to Locast, YouTube TV would be \"punished by the Big 4 broadcasters in negotiating carriage agreements for other non-broadcast programming channels,\" the lawsuit read.\n\nRead More", "description": "Locast, a non-profit streaming service, has countersued Disney's ABC, CBS, Fox and Comcast's NBCUniversal, alleging the broadcasters engaged in antitrust conduct and colluded to grow their market power.", "authors": ["Kerry Flynn", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190927122604-tv-set--stock-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
