Further attracting scrutiny is that the July call took place soon after the White House withheld millions of dollars in military aid for Ukraine.\n\nDemocrats, many of whom have ramped up their calls for impeachment, theorized that Trump was leveraging his political power for Ukraine's help in digging up dirt on the Biden family.\n\nHahn accused Giuliani of \"making things up\" in his pursuit of Biden and characterized Giuliani's claims against Biden as \"libelous.\"\n\n\"I should sue you for libel,\" Giuliani said in the exchange.\n\nRead more: 7 Democratic lawmakers who served in the military and intelligence agencies accuse Trump of 'flagrant disregard for the law'\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaking with members of the media on August 30 at the White House before his departure for Camp David.

Shut up, you don't know what you're talking about.\"\n\nGiuliani described Hahn as a \"serial liar\" and described being asked by the US State Department \"to facilitate a meeting\" between Trump and Zelensky.\n\nGiuliani said he met with one of Zelensky's representatives but \"never discussed any kind of pressure about a criminal case\" or a \"quid pro quo.\"\n\nGiuliani's characterization of his interactions with the State Department contradicts officials who have said he was inserting himself in processes that were only peripherally related to diplomacy \u2014 and more relevant to Trump's political opponents.\n\n\"Rudy \u2014 he did all of this,\" one official told The Washington Post. \"This s---show that we're in \u2014 it's him injecting himself into the process.\"\n\nGiuliani gave himself a positive assessment of his performance in recent days, despite the freewheeling interviews he gave on multiple news networks.\n\n\"I sure as heck know how to protect myself and my client,\" Giuliani said. \"It was a perfectly appropriate, Perfectly legitimate, and a completely authorized communication.\"", "description": "Rudy Giuliani gave himself a positive assessment, despite the freewheeling interviews he gave on multiple news networks.", "authors": ["David Choi"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8ae7502e22af240f68d818?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
