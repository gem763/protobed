While your linked credit cards and any other methods you use to buy stuff within Zynga\u2019s games appears to be safe so far, your logins might have been compromised.\n\nAs Zynga writes on a separate support page:\n\n\u201cOur current understanding is that no financial information was accessed. However, we understand that account information for certain players of certain Zynga games may have been accessed. As a precaution, we have taken steps to protect certain players\u2019 accounts from invalid logins, including but not limited to where we believe that passwords may have been accessed. Zynga has begun the process of sending individual notices to players where we believe that notice is required.\u201d\n\nShould you be concerned? If you\u2019re using the same password for Zynga as you are other services, yes. That\u2019s an easy problem to fix, however. Get a password manager and make sure you\u2019re using strong, unique passwords for all of your various services \u2014 which cuts down the likelihood that a password breach on one site will compromise your security on another.\n\nEven if you don\u2019t get an email from Zynga that your account was affected, it never hurts to reset your password anyway. (There\u2019s nothing wrong with a little extra caution.) You probably don\u2019t need to meticulously scan your credit card transactions for the next few months \u2014 for any that might be otherwise linked to your Zynga account, that is \u2014 but it never hurts to give them a quick look in a month or so just to make sure everything is on the up-and-up.", "description": "Around 200 million players of the popular Words With Friends and Draw Something games from Zynga have had their accounts\u2019 information stolen by \u201coutside hackers,\u201d as the company describes.
