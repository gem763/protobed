It is expected to follow the precedent set in 1974 over the committee\u2019s procedures during then-President Richard Nixon\u2019s impeachment proceedings.\n\nSources told CNN on Friday that the resolution is expected to spell out that Chairman Jerry Nadler, a New York Democrat, has the authority to call hearings at either the full committee or subcommittee level in connection with its impeachment deliberations.\n\nThe resolution, sources say, is expected to make clear that future House Judiciary hearings can be conducted in ways different from most congressional hearings since the panel is considering impeachment. For instance, the resolution is expected to authorize committee staff counsels to question witnesses, something that is typically not done at congressional hearings.", "description": "", "authors": ["Cnn.Com Politics House-Panel-Impeachment-Probe-Steps Index.Html"], "top_image": ""}
