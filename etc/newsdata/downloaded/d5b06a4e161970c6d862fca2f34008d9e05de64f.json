Sim Seung-seob, operations chief of the South Korean Navy, told lawmakers of the parliamentary National Defense Committee at Navy headquarters in Gyeryong, South Chungcheong, that the Navy thinks the country needs nuclear-powered submarines as a way to \u201csimultaneously contain North Korea and [other] neighboring countries.\u201dWhen a lawmaker asked about the Navy\u2019s precise stance on the issue of South Korea having nuclear-powered submarines, Sim replied he could only provide \u201climited\u201d answers because the military had to decide \u201cafter considering various national circumstances,\u201d but added there were \u201cresearch results\u201d indicating South Korea was definitely in need of them.Sim said the Navy was running a task force to study Korea\u2019s need for nuclear submarines, the first time the Navy has ever admitted running a task force on the subject. The former Roh Moo-hyun administration secretly initiated a plan in 2003 to build and deploy nuclear submarines, but the plan was later canceled after media reports and Washington\u2019s opposition.Last week, the North tested what appeared to be a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) into the East Sea, stoking fresh fears here as to whether the South was capable of defending itself from possible attacks.A submarine powered by a nuclear reactor allows the vessel to operate underwater for long periods, as opposed to conventional submarines, which need to surface to refuel, making them more detectable than their nuclear counterparts.Under the current South-U.S. agreement for peaceful nuclear cooperation, Seoul is prohibited from enriching uranium or using enriched uranium for military purposes but is allowed to purchase low-enriched reactor-grade uranium for power generation. Nuclear submarines that use highly-enriched uranium, therefore, are not allowed.Asked during Thursday\u2019s parliamentary audit whether he thinks a nuclear-powered submarine would be appropriate for countering North Korea\u2019s SLBM, Sim said it would.\u201cNuclear-powered submarines are capable of long underwater operations,\u201d he said. The Navy \u201cbelieves they\u2019re the most effective way to detect an SLBM, track it down and destroy it.\u201dThe Navy said in a report submitted to the committee\u2019s lawmakers that the South Korean military was studying nuclear-powered submarines but pointed out that the issue would ultimately have to be decided \u201cin accordance with national policies.\u201dRep. Choi Jae-sung of the ruling Democratic Party said \u201cpolitical and diplomatic efforts\u201d would be required if Seoul were to actually deploy a nuclear-powered submarine, particularly in regard to the South-U.S. nuclear agreement, cooperation with the international society at large and a national consensus.Rep. Ha Tae-kyung of the minor-right Bareunmirae Party said Seoul should first equip itself with small, cheaper unmanned submarines.BY LEE KEUN-PYUNG, LEE SUNG-EUN [lee.sungeun@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
