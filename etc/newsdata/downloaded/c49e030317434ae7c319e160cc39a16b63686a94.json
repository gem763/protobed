During the second round of primary debates in July, Buttigieg suggested it would not be as difficult as many think to make significant constitutional reforms like abolishing the Electoral College and make structural reforms to the Supreme Court like packing on more justices. \"This is a country that once changed its Constitution so you couldn't drink and changed it back because we changed our minds, and you're telling me we can't reform our democracy in our time,\" he said. \"We have to or we will be having the same argument 20 years from now\"\n\nOn social safety net : Says the country should \"have a conversation\" about Universal Basic Income.

Buttigieg announced in mid-March that he reached the 65,000 donor threshold to participate in the first Democratic primary debate.\n\nButtigieg's campaign raised over $7 million from nearly 160,000 donors in the first quarter of 2019, and $24.8 million from 294,000 donors in the second quarter \u2014 more than any other 2020 candidate.\n\nHow is Pete Buttigieg viewed by voters compared to the competition?\n\nINSIDER has conducted a number of other polls to check in on how these candidates are perceived in comparison to one another. When we asked respondents to one poll to rank how far to the left or to the right they considered the candidates, Buttigieg was generally considered to be one the most centrist candidates in the field. Given his lack of national platform it's unsurprising to see he was viewed as is among the least experienced candidates int the field by far when we asked respondents to rank the candidates based on how prepared they are for the rigors of the presidency given what they knew about their history of public service and experience with government. However, when asked how likable or personable respondents perceived the candidates to be, Buttigieg came in second place behind only Joe Biden.\n\nCould Pete Buttigieg beat President Trump?\n\nReferring back to INSIDER's recurring poll, Buttigieg overall is a more obscure candidate than many of his peers, and those who do know of him are unsure if he'd beat Trump. Lucky for pete, he's on-par with other Democrats when it comes to the perception of electability, which is really something for the mayor of a small midwestern college down.\n\nHow do Democratic voters feel about Pete Buttigieg's qualifications?\n\nINSIDER has conducted polling about how voters feel about candidate attributes or qualifications. We asked respondents about a list of possible qualifications and if they made them more likely or less likely to vote for a candidate for president.\n\nFor example, among respondents who said they'd vote in the Democratic primary, 19% said a candidate being a college professor made them likelier to support them, while 4% said it made them less likely to, for a +15% net favorability. We can then see how different candidates' resumes stack up compared to those preferences.\n\nAttributes perceived as most valuable include his released tax returns (+43%), him being multi-lingual (+25%), age 50 or younger (+23%), a child of immigrants (+21%), armed forces veteran (+17%), mayor (+15%), Rhodes scholar (+12%) and his Ivy league education (+7%).\n\nAttributes considered to be a liability based on the preferences of self-reported Democratic voters include his past as a management consultant (-18%), that he has spent little time in government (-22%) and that he grew up wealthy (-42%).\n\nRead more of our best stories on Pete Buttigieg:", "description": "South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg is a 37-year-old Harvard-educated Rhodes scholar and Afghanistan War veteran running for president.", "authors": ["Eliza Relman"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5c9b7d8d09b6031d9c0d6902-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
