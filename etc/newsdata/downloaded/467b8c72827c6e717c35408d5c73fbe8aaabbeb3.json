They've played from behind in nine of 12 outings this season. Another alarming statistic? They've led for 188:30 minutes and trailed for 195:38.\n\nFlorida's Jayce Hawryluk (8) scores on Edmonton goalie Mikko Koskinen in a 6-2 Oilers loss on Sunday. Koskinen and netmate Mike Smith have been key to Edmonton's quick start this season, masking the problem of the team's lack of scoring depth. (Jason Franson/Canadian Press)\n\nThat's not a recipe for long-term success.\n\nOn Sunday, the Oilers looked like they'd reported for a sleepy morning skate rather than an actual game. Smith turned away seven shots in the first period before his mates fired even one at Sergei Bobrovsky in the Florida net.\n\nThe game truly slipped away in a span of 2:05 early in the second period when Smith surrendered three goals before Tippett applied the hook.\n\n\"It's one thing to be down one, but you start feeding teams two or three and you are playing with fire a bit,\" Smith said. \"You're not going to come back in a lot of those games.\"\n\nFalling behind early isn't helping the guys charged with secondary scoring, either.\n\n\"When you're chasing the game, it's harder for them,\" Tippett said. \"They haven't contributed as much as they'd want, and I think a lot of those guys are feeling that pressure.\"\n\nAnd still, there's no question the Oilers are exceeding expectations this season.\n\n\"We're still off to a good start, and we still want to have that positive energy in the group,\" said defenceman Oscar Klefbom. \"But we've still got to learn from this.\"\n\nSo, yes, on some nights McDavid and Draisaitl will no doubt have to keep carrying the team into the win column. And yes, Smith and Koskinen will need to keep stealing games here and there.\n\nBut what the supporting cast is able to muster in the weeks and months ahead will no doubt play a deciding role in the Oilers' fate.\n\n\"We've got to find something down there to create some opportunities,\" Tippett said. \"I really feel that once they get on the board, get going, everyone will loosen up a little bit.\"", "description": "What the Edmonton Oilers' supporting cast is able to muster in the weeks and months ahead will no doubt play a deciding role in the team's fate this season.", "authors": ["Freelance Writer", "Vicki Has Written About Sports In Canada For More Than Years For Cbc Sports", "Postmedia", "The Calgary Herald", "The Edmonton Journal.
