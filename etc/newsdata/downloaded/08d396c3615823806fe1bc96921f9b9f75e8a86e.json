I am a journalist. And I live in New York City, which means overpriced drinks and food are pretty par for the course.\n\nBut I did spend one fabulously ritzy week in a country that has no poverty and where 32% of the inhabitants are millionaires: Monaco.\n\nThis year's Monaco Yacht Show brought an estimated 30,000 people from around the world to the tiny city-state on the French Riviera. These attendees are yachting-industry insiders \u2014 including superyacht builders, designers, and brokers \u2014 as well as wealthy private clients looking to tour, charter, or purchase yachts.\n\nMonaco may be smaller than New York City's Central Park, but it's one of the wealthiest countries in the world, with a per capita GDP of $165,420 \u2014 the second highest in the world after Liechtenstein. An estimated 32% \u2014 or about one-third \u2014 of the country's residents are millionaires.\n\nAnd according to the CIA World Factbook, no portion of Monaco's population lives below the poverty line.\n\nThis wealth was evident from the moment I arrived in Monaco \u2014 and even while I was booking my trip.\n\nHere's what it's like to attend the glamorous Monaco Yacht Show when you're not a millionaire.", "description": "The glitzy Monaco Yacht Show draws in thousands of people from around the world to see the newest, most expensive superyachts and attend lavish parties.", "authors": ["Katie Warren"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9631d578c0cd24a173a374?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
