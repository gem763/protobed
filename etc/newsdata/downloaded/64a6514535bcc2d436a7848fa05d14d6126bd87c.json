We stand with her and will gladly lead the charge in defending her noble and legal actions,\u201d Hiram Sasser, legal counsel for the First Liberty Institute, said.\n\nMs. Kemp provided Guyger the Bible after the former police officer had been sentenced to ten years in prison for murdering Botham Jean, a neighbor in her apartment complex whom she fatally shot after mistakenly entering his apartment.\n\n\u201cYou just need a tiny mustard seed of faith. You start with this,\u201d Ms. Kemp said to her, hugging the crying Guyger before she left the courtroom.\n\nFFRF criticized this move in their letter to the Commission: \u201cIt is perfectly acceptable for private citizens to express their religious beliefs in court, but the rules are different for those acting in a governmental role.\u201d\n\nDespite the group not calling for an actual punishment for Judge Kemp\u2019s actions, FFRF attorney Andrew L. Seidel said this act was \u201cunconstitutional\u201d and an \u201cabuse of power.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need more compassion in our criminal justice system, but here, compassion crossed the line into coercion. Judges cannot impose their personal religion on others,\u201d Mr. Seidel said.\n\nGuyger was convicted for the murder of Jean Tuesday after she claimed to mistake his apartment for her own and shot him, thinking he was an intruder.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
