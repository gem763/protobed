We had a rescuer shot in the face, she was lucky she wasn't killed or blinded,' Mr Levy said.\n\n'We are aware of the dangers out there, but someone has to do it.'\n\nThe demonstration outside the Premier's office was aimed towards banning the sport of duck hunting (pictured)\n\nHe said that everyday during the hunting season, which carries out from March until June, he and his team would venture into the wetlands to rescue the injured ducks\n\nMr Levy said that since starting the organisation, the numbers of duck shooters in Victoria have dropped dramatically from 100,000 to 25,000.\n\n'The reason for the drop is because of public opinion. Duck shooters are seen by the public as violent and outdated, shockingly cruel and an issue that needs to be brought to an end,' Mr Levy said.\n\nHe said those that partake in duck shooting lack any empathy.\n\n'They do it because they like to shoot moving targets and the government has accommodated them,' he said.\n\n'It highlights the violence and cruelty.'\n\n'They don't have any empathy for our native birds, they see them as objects to shoot down.'\n\nMr Levy said that everyday during the hunting season, which carries out from March until June, he and his team would venture into the wetlands to rescue the injured ducks.\n\n'We also take out mobile veterinary clinics and any wounded bird goes back to the clinic,' he said.\n\nLabelled the 'Duck Rescue' team, several members are pictured clad in high visibility vests while they tend to birds who have been injured during the barbaric shooting.\n\nIn another horrific image taken by a member of the CADS organisation, a duck was seen suffering horrific injuries from a bullet wound to its bill (pictured)\n\nMr Levy said team members risked their lives when rescuing the birds, and one was even shot in the face (pictured: Duck Rescue team members)\n\nIn a demonstration outside the office of Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews in March, the (CADS) organisation displayed hundreds of dead birds in hopes the sport will be banned.\n\nPhotos show more than 70 native birds who have been illegally shot, including a number of endangered species.\n\nAn estimated 800 native waterbirds were killed during the campaign, including 68 of the threatened freckled duck.\n\nIn another horrific image taken by a member of the CADS organisation, a duck was seen suffering horrific injuries from a bullet wound to its bill.\n\nLabelled the 'Duck Rescue' team, several members are seen clad in high visibility vests while they venture into the wetlands to birds who have been injured during the shooting (pictured)\n\nThe team work tirelessly to put an end to the shooters and provide mobile vets to help care for the injured birds\n\nMr Levy (pictured holding a dead waterbird) said the reason for the drop in duck shooters was because the public now view it as a 'vile' sport\n\nMr Levy and his team remain hopeful that Victoria will see the end of duck massacres putting his faith in Mr Meddick.\n\n'I think we will see the end soon,' Mr Levy said.\n\nCurrently, duck shooting is banned in Western Australia, New South Wales and Queensland.\n\nMany team members of the Coalition Against Duck Shooting have been captured tending to birds who have been shot (pictured)", "description": "Veteran anti-duck hunting campaigner, Laurie Levy, is determined to put an end to the 'violent' sport in Australia.", "authors": ["Eliza Mcphee For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/01/19766648-0-image-a-20_1571186481069.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
