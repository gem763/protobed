(AP) - For most of last season, all they could do was watch.\n\nWatch as the Atlanta Falcons tried desperately to fill their spots.\n\nWatch as the team tumbled to a losing record.\n\nWhen Deion Jones, Ricardo Allen and Keanu Neal take the field for Sunday\u2019s season opener at Minnesota, they\u2019ll be eager to show just what this team was missing when three of its defensive standouts went down with serious injuries.\n\n\u201cEverybody can say they\u2019ve got the best team in the world right now,\u201d Allen said. \u201cBut we know who we are. We know what we\u2019ve done together. If we can pull it together, if we can stay healthy and play together, the sky\u2019s the limit.\u201d\n\nJust two seasons removed from a trip to the Super Bowl, the Falcons went into 2018 with high expectations.\n\nBut Neal, the strong safety and a fearsome hitter, tore up a knee in the very first game at Philadelphia and was done for the year. Jones, a fly-around-field linebacker, injured a foot in that very same game and missed the next 10 contests. Allen, the free safety and inspirational leader of the defense, went down with a season-ending Achilles injury in Week 3.\n\nThe Falcons never recovered from that trio of devastating blows, stumbling to a 7-9 record. Atlanta ranked near the bottom of the league in most major defensive categories, including 28th in yards allowed at nearly 385 per game.\n\nIt was a stunning drop-off for a team that placed eighth the previous season with an average of 318.4 yards.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re talking about right up the center of our defense,\u201d quarterback Matt Ryan said. \u201cThat\u2019s tough on a defense when the center of it at that second level kind of gets taken away.\u201d\n\nLosing those three players had a ripple effect throughout the defense. Not only were there lesser players in key positions, but those around them didn\u2019t play with the same level of aggressiveness. Perhaps they tried to do a little too much to help cope with the injuries. Maybe they were back on their heels just a bit, looking to avoid big plays rather than taking chances.\n\nWhatever the case, coach Dan Quinn - who is now also serving as defensive coordinator - didn\u2019t like what he saw.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t think the defense looked physical last year,\u201d said Jerome Henderson, the secondary coach and pass defense coordinator. \u201cHe didn\u2019t think we looked like a defense that was going to knock people back and be in people\u2019s faces. It wasn\u2019t what he wanted and what he expects. Our challenge this offseason was to bring physicalness back to our defense.\u201d\n\nJones, Allen and Neal should help to re-establish a bit of swagger on the defensive side.\n\nAll three were key players in the Falcons\u2018 run to the Super Bowl during the 2016 season. All three stepped up their games even more when Atlanta returned to the playoffs as a wild-card team in 2017, carried largely by a defense that allowed fewer than 20 points a game.\n\n\u201cAs a defense, we\u2019ve jumped in the top 10 before,\u201d Allen pointed out. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen what we can do. Just put it all back together and be what we were the last time.\u201d\n\nRyan said the influence of Jones, Allen and Neal goes beyond their physical skills.\n\n\u201cWe talk about communication on the offensive side of the ball,\u201d the quarterback said. \u201cCommunication on the defensive side of the ball is equally as important. Those guys are some of the best communicators that we have, getting other guys in the right spots, setting the defense the correct way, making sure the coverage calls are going the way they\u2019re supposed to. They\u2019re invaluable in that way.\u201d\n\nAllen and Neal returned to the field during the preseason, proving they were fully recovered. The Falcons were more careful with Jones, even though he returned to play the final five games of the 2018 season. He didn\u2019t play in any preseason games, but will be in the starting lineup when Atlanta takes on the Vikings.\n\nHe can\u2019t wait to be reunited with those two guys behind him. It will be the first time they\u2019ve all played together in 367 days,\n\n\u201cThis is awesome,\u201d Jones said after practice Wednesday. \u201cHearing certain voices again, feeling certain presences out there like Keke - feeling his presence, hearing his voice - and Rico back in the middle of the field. I mean, it\u2019s dope. We\u2019re all together. Now we get to fly around and run around.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Paul Newberry on Twitter at www.twitter.com/pnewberry1963 His work can be found at https://apnews.com\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "For most of last season, all they could do was watch.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Paul Newberry"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/05/falcons_healthy_defense_football_85057_c0-64-1568-978_s1770x1032.jpg?b97a02077c3c47fb543db586a133b89a9c5c4330", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
