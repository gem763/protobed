The Los Angeles FC coach can use his entire body to make a point, and he\u2019s emphasizing what\u2019s actually important about individual accolades, such as being named Major League Soccer\u2019s Coach of the Year for the third time.\n\n\u201cIndividual awards are recognition of the team,\u201d Bradley said, naming LAFC general manager John Thorrington and \u201ceverybody else I get a chance to work with every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve created a good environment,\u201d he added. \u201cI think we challenge each other every day. The most important part is you create an environment where people enjoy what they\u2019re doing. Everybody feels part of it. Players know when they show up every day that there\u2019s been a lot of thought that goes into what we do, and the culture that we\u2019re trying to build. For me, it\u2019s only recognition of all that.\u201d\n\nTo Bradley, this sport is not about awards. It\u2019s only partly about championships, even when LAFC is about to start a potential three-game run at its first MLS Cup title with the biggest game in franchise history on Thursday night against the LA Galaxy.\n\nInstead, it\u2019s about building a team that vigorously pursues excellence, never reaching perfection and never stopping. With Bradley telling the story, the mundane day-to-day work of professional soccer is an epic quest that probably won\u2019t be completed, but should always be embraced.\n\n\u201cLook, trophies become part of that, but it\u2019s about football,\u201d Bradley said. \u201cIt\u2019s something the fans can see. Every time you step on the field, there\u2019s something real there. There\u2019s something different there. There\u2019s something that if you watch, you want to come back and see again.\u201d\n\nBradley has been trying to build that ideal team for the past 25 years, ever since his decade in charge of the Princeton men\u2019s soccer program propelled him around the world on a coaching odyssey including stops in MLS and with national teams in the U.S. and Egypt, followed by professional sides in Norway, France and Britain.\n\nHis latest stop has arguably brought him closer to perfection than ever before. A lifetime of coaching knowledge has combined with LAFC\u2019s eager ownership, smart player selection, a beautiful stadium and an already robust fan culture to create something spectacular in record time.\n\nBradley will be honored with the Sigi Schmid Coach of the Year Award on Wednesday after guiding a 2-year-old franchise to the best regular season in league history. LAFC (21-4-9) reached the MLS records for points (72), goals (85) and goal differential (plus-48) while dazzling the continent with an aggressive, cohesive brand of soccer.\n\nLess than three years after the first American coach in Premiership history was fired by Swansea after just 11 games, he sits atop MLS with one of the best teams ever assembled. Bradley rejects any notion of I-told-you-so satisfaction after his abrupt dismissal at the Welsh club in December 2016, although he is clearly confident he could have succeeded with more time to implement his ideas.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re so far in the rear-view mirror,\u201d Bradley said of all his past stops. \u201cEvery day brings you that new challenge. You enjoy that part, you feel good about it, and I believe in the way I do things. I love to engage the people around me to bring something out of them, and hopefully in doing that, they can bring more out of me.\u201d\n\nDeep into his second year in charge at LAFC, his players have grown accustomed to Bradley\u2019s style. The same coach who designed the sophisticated offense that allowed Carlos Vela to score an MLS-record 34 goals also nags his players to clean up after themselves when they eat at the LAFC training complex, believing that sloppiness at the lunch table can translate into imprecision on the field.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the bigger picture with him,\u201d defender Steven Beitashour said. \u201cIt\u2019s so minuscule. It\u2019s the smallest little details. \u2026 It all correlates to the game. It\u2019s all about just trying to improve, and not showing up just to be here. There\u2019s so many individuals that I\u2019m not going to mention that improved so much, that I would never have thought could be at the level they are, unless they were under his system. He sees everything.\u201d\n\nAnd on Thursday night, Bradley will lead LAFC into its Banc of California Stadium for a one-game Western Conference semifinal against Zlatan Ibrahimovic and the Galaxy. The sixth chapter of the already sizzling El Trafico rivalry is the rivals\u2019 first postseason meeting.\n\nFor all its success, Bradley\u2019s team has never beaten its closest rival. Along with three exciting draws, the Galaxy have won two of the clubs\u2019 five matchups, including Ibrahimovic\u2019s electrifying two-goal MLS debut last year in the first El Trafico.\n\nWhile Bradley greets this matchup with excitement - \u201cIt had to be the Galaxy,\u201d he said - he would never hold his work hostage to a single day\u2019s result, even if others might try.\n\n\u201cThe champion of the league is determined by MLS Cup, and we\u2019re one of the teams with a chance,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. But everything else we\u2019ve done, the way we keep trying to do it into the future, none of that changes.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLS: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Bob Bradley rocks in his chair under the sizzling Southern California sun and gives an exaggerated New Jersey shoulder shrug.
