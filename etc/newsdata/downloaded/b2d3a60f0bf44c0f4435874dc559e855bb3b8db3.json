As far as we know today, we have planned for our flight tests to take place in mid-December which means decisions on a return to service for January, on our side,\" EASA Executive Director Patrick Ky said late on Friday.\n\nHe said a return to service of the MAX would be coordinated with the FAA as much as possible, but that the two agencies had slightly different processes and consultation requirements.\n\n\"So we may end up with a couple of weeks of time difference but we are not talking about six months; we are talking about a delay which, if it happens, will be due mostly to process or administrative technicalities.\"\n\nKy was speaking shortly before the disclosure of internal Boeing pilot messages from 2016 plunged the planemaker into fresh turmoil. On Monday, he declined comment on the messages.\n\nSome analysts and unions suggested the texts could further delay a return to service, but FAA officials said following the release they did not expect the messages would affect tentative plans for a certification flight in early November. The FAA says it needs at least 30 days from that flight to end the grounding.\n\nA European source said there were no immediate signs of an impact.\n\n\n\n\n\nHUMAN FACTORS\n\nHowever, the timing for ungrounding the MAX is not set in stone and depends on a number of outstanding checks.\n\nThe FAA is waiting for a final Boeing system update designed to avoid so-called MCAS control software pushing the MAX's nose downwards due to data from a single faulty angle-of-attack (AOA) or airflow sensor. Instead, MCAS will monitor both sensors.\n\nEASA has not withdrawn a suggestion that only a third sensor would make the system foolproof, but says it is prepared to set its concerns aside - at least on a transitional basis - if a separate exercise aimed at improving pilot procedures can make the workload from such faults manageable for an \"average\" crew.\n\n\"We are still looking at the changes made by Boeing on their flight control computers which they did over the summer and early September. We are entering a critical stage in the project where we look at the human-factor issues and how much in terms of workload a crew can take in terms of alarms,\" Ky said.\n\nThe workload tests will be carried out together with the FAA, but EASA will perform its own flight and simulator tests.\n\nThese will help EASA decide whether to rely solely on improved cockpit procedures so that pilots can easily cope with any sensor outage, or demand another technical safety net to make it harder for sensor data to disappear in the first place.\n\n\"The two are complementary...If you want better AOA integrity, one obvious way would be to add another sensor, which is not easy to do,\" Ky said.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSITIONAL PERIOD\n\nIf EASA concludes an extra fallback is still needed, Ky did not exclude making this a \"synthetic\" or computerised sensor capable of imitating a probe and sending calculated data to aircraft systems to supplement data from actual sensors.\n\n\"This has never been done before but we are open to discussing all possible solutions with Boeing,\" Ky said.\n\nHe did not rule out introducing a transitional period in which the plane could be cleared with reduced pilot overload.\n\n\"If you have a new operational procedure which simplifies the workloads for pilots and enables you to arrive at an acceptable level \u2026. this can be done for the return to service,\" he said. \"Now, is this level acceptable for a longer period than just the transitional period? That is something we need to assess.\"\n\nStory continues", "description": "European regulators expect to clear Boeing's  grounded 737 MAX to return to service in January at the earliest, following flight trials by European test pilots scheduled for mid-December, Europe's top aviation safety official told Reuters.
