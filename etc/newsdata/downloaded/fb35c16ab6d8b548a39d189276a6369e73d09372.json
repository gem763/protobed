I want that so badly it hurts. I feel like I have failed him and you when I have run out of options to keep them, and you, comfortable and happy,' she said.\n\nAdmitting that it's hard to be professional and stay calm and collected, she added: 'The door closes behind you and I don\u2019t know if you hear this, but I sob hysterically into your pet's ear.'\n\nFollowing the heartfelt letter, more than 28,000 social media users rushed to offer their praise and admiration for Brenda's honest account.\n\nOne user wrote: 'Over my lifetime there have been several, and my heart has broken each time! I thank my vet for always making it a little easier.'\n\nBrenda Gough, from Brantford, Ontario, took to Facebook to share how her experiences of putting down people's pets have affected her\n\nTaking to the social media platform Brenda took readers through how she developed a bond with the pets she met\n\nHeartbreak: Brenda explained how she often falls 'in love' with her clients' animals, having spent so much time with them over the years\n\nGuilt: The vet confesses that she feels like she has 'failed' an animal and its family when she 'runs out of options'\n\nWhile another user commented: 'So well written and so honest. Tears are running down my face.'\n\nOpening her post on the social media platform, the vet wrote: 'How your vet sees euthanasia.....So, you bring me this puppy - she kisses my face, devours the cookies I offer, and our friendship starts.\n\n'Several visits later, he starts to learn where all the cookie jars are in the clinic, and that lady in the white coat, well she\u2019s okay....\n\n'Fast forward many visits later, now I am in love with your dog and your whole family because, well, you are just really really good people and I have not only watched that pup turn into a really sweet family member, but I got to watch the kids grow every year and be a very small part of your journey.\n\n'So many adventures, so little time.....And here we are, fifteen or so odd years later, having to say goodbye.\n\n'He\u2019s got heart disease and I can\u2019t fix it anymore. She\u2019s got cancer and there is no cure. He has arthritis and the meds just aren\u2019t working. I want her to live forever for you. I want that so badly it hurts. I feel like I have failed him and you when I have run out of options to keep them, and you, comfortable and happy.\n\n'So now it\u2019s time, and I am supposed to be professional. Objective. I am the doctor. Calm. Cool. Collected. Always under control. F*** that.\n\n'I have known you and her for a third of my life, and most of my professional career.\n\n'But I keep it together. My superhuman amazing technicians have put the catheter in. My support staff from reception to assistants have done all the paperwork.\n\nShe went on to describe the moment the animal's body began to relax as their owner breaks down in tears\n\nBrenda told readers that she wished the animals could 'live forever' and that she knew how owner's felt\n\n'Trust me they may not show it but their hearts are breaking for you. They have been there. They know. And they know you and care about you too.\n\n'And I have the needle in the pocket of my white coat. The same pocket that was always full of treats for him. I take a deep yoga breath and come into the room. Gotta stay strong now.......\n\nThe vet shared her heartfelt letter on Facebook and has since received more than 28,000 comments\n\n'She\u2019s giving me that sweet look she always does, the one that is followed by puppy kisses and a glance at the cookie jar. But she is too weak now. She is ready. You are not. I am not. But this sh** has to happen, because we love her too much to let her suffer.\n\n'She would keep going as long as we asked her too. But we can\u2019t ask her to anymore. It\u2019s not fair to her. I wish our human hearts could be so giving all the time. I wish I could be the person my dog thinks I am.\n\n'I wish I wish i wish I could find a way for them to live forever. But I don\u2019t have those magical powers. I am just a vet.\n\n'So we kiss him back, not much left of his body that still works, but that old tail wags, just enough that I lose my s*** on the inside but I try not to cry. Gotta stay strong.\n\n'Her body relaxes, she is in your arms and your are sobbing. Another family has lost one of its most cherished members.\n\n'I put my stethoscope to her heart to make sure it has stopped but she is held so tight to your chest that maybe that is your heart I hear pounding or maybe it\u2019s mine and all the blood rushing through my ears as I try so so so hard not to turn into a blubbering mess.\n\n'Confirmed, he has passed. You lay him gently on the table and we hug tightly as you go to leave.\n\nFollowing the public post, animal lovers rushes to offer their praise and described how they feared the moment they would have to say goodbye to their animals too\n\nBrenda was overwhelmed with the response and thanked social media users for their comments\n\n'The door closes behind you and I don\u2019t know if you hear this, but I sob hysterically into your pets ear. She is gone, he will be missed, and you have to face what I know will be one of the hardest parts of today.\n\n'Entering that house and they are not there to greet you.\n\n'Please know that I know how you feel. As you leave the clinic I just wish with every fibre of my being that you never had to face that. I wish they could live forever.\n\n'And please know, I am so grateful that I was a small part of your journey.\n\n'Love always, Your vet.'\n\nAnother social media user wrote: 'Tears running down my face my wee man beside me the other one at my feet and I really dread the day this knocks on my door.'\n\nIn awe of the response, Brenda replied: 'Wow you folks all love your veterinarians and their staff!\n\n'I wrote this the other day, just needing to put it all out there, and I can't get over the response! Over 100,000 shares in three days and kind messages from people all over the world!\n\n'Thank you everyone for all of the kind words - veterinarians and staff all over the world should read the over 20,000 comments on days when they feel they are not loved - Vet clinics and staff everywhere - we are loved!'", "description": "Brenda Gough, from Brantford, Ontario, was moved to share her experiences on Facebook, after the difficult task of putting down a much-loved dog she'd known since they were a puppy.", "authors": ["Bhvishya Patel For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/16/19302694-0-image-a-51_1570201582570.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
