The two are well clear of the rest of the field, with Sen. Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersOvernight Health Care \u2014 Presented by Better Medicare Alliance \u2014 Family planning providers ask court to block Trump abortion rule | Warren under pressure over how to pay for 'Medicare for All' | Juul reportedly facing criminal probe Democratic candidates keep finding fresh ways to throw away our money Sanders contrasts his fashion with Trump's: 'Actually, it is Kohl's' MORE (I-Vt.) in third place with 11 percent support.\n\nBiden\u2019s team had already been playing down expectations in the Hawkeye State before the poll came out. An unnamed senior adviser told reporters earlier this month that the former vice president did not need to win the state, which holds its caucuses on Feb. 3.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut a loss in the first contest would be a grave problem for Biden, not least because it would reinforce the sense that he is an unusually weak front-runner.\n\nThe nature of the primary calendar also makes it unlikely that the former vice president could right his ship immediately. The next contest is in New Hampshire, adjacent both to Warren\u2019s Massachusetts and Sanders\u2019s Vermont.\n\nIn such a scenario, Biden would likely be looking to South Carolina, the fourth contest, as a potential firewall, given his strength with African American voters and the centrality of those voters to the outcome in the Palmetto State.\n\nOne Biden ally seemed to be preparing the ground for such an outcome on Monday, telling The Hill that \u201chis coalition can\u2019t be shown in states that are primarily white.\u201d\n\nThe ally also insisted, however, that \u201cthere\u2019s always going to be an alternative candidate, but we\u2019re feeling good about where we are.\u201d\n\nAnother ally concluded, \u201cIt\u2019ll be a battle for delegates, and we\u2019re feeling good about where we are in the early states.\u201d\n\nOthers who are unaligned with any campaign think the picture is bleaker for Biden.\n\nDemocratic strategist Brad Bannon said Biden is \u201calready skating on thin ice as it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cDefeats in Iowa and New Hampshire, which are both battleground states next fall, would highlight questions about electability, which is his key selling point. Biden can\u2019t afford to play the long game. Losses in both early states could bring the entire shaky structure down,\u201d Bannon said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFor Biden, there is also the danger that a loss in Iowa would change the shape of the race in an instant. There are precedents, albeit inexact ones, for such a scenario.\n\nWhen then-Sen. Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaTrump mocks Romney with video contrasting their presidential bids Trump is right to counter Iran's terror \u2014 combat vets have seen its effects Voter anger may spell the end for Trump and Biden MORE (D-Ill.) beat then-Sen. Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonTrump mocks Romney with video contrasting their presidential bids Whistleblower fuels impeachment talk Let's get real: Democrats were first to enlist Ukraine in US elections MORE (D-N.Y.) in Iowa in 2008, it was a shock from which her campaign never truly recovered \u2014 and it persuaded black voters that Obama was electable even in states that seemed demographically challenging. Although Clinton came back to win a surprise victory in New Hampshire, Obama thrashed her in South Carolina.\n\nReferring to the position of the Biden campaign in this election cycle, Democratic strategist Eddie Vale said, \u201cIf they get blown out in both [Iowa and New Hampshire], as we\u2019ve seen in primaries on both sides of the aisle, enthusiasm and polling can swing quickly, along with the earned media attention, and having firewall states like candidates used to rely on in the past isn\u2019t really a viable strategy anymore.\u201d\n\nWarren can take heart from Iowa\u2019s favorable history with insurgent candidates, at least in the recent past.\n\nIn addition to Obama\u2019s 2008 victory, Sanders came within a whisker of beating Clinton in 2016. If the Vermont senator fades this time around \u2014 a plausible outcome but not a guaranteed one \u2014 Warren could emerge as the left\u2019s standard-bearer against the more establishment-friendly Biden. In caucuses that tend to attract the most committed party activists, that is a good spot to be in.\n\nStill, positioning oneself against the party establishment is far from a sure-fire guarantee of success, even in Iowa.\n\nIn 2004, former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean ignited enormous excitement among young progressives \u2014 only to fall to a third-place showing in Iowa behind then-Sen.

Kerry: 'Absolute shock' over Trump discussing Biden with Ukraine leader MORE (D-Mass.), the winner and eventual nominee, as well as then-Sen. John Edwards (D-N.C.).\n\nBack in 2000, Vice President Al Gore Albert (Al) Arnold GoreKrystal Ball: Democrats on track to nominate Warren, lose to Trump Voter anger may spell the end for Trump and Biden Judd Gregg: Chance of a political lifetime MORE vanquished progressive challenger Bill Bradley in Iowa by almost 30 points.\n\n\u201cThe secret, whether progressive or centrist, is whether a candidate is able to rally their respective forces,\u201d said David Yepsen, who covered presidential campaigns in the state for several decades with the Des Moines Register. \u201cWarren could win if moderates are fractured among other candidates, or Biden could win if Warren and Sanders split progressives.\u201d\n\nYepsen also noted that Warren has vaulted into the leading position in the state very early, which is good on its face but will also inevitably bring sharper attacks from her rivals. At televised debates so far, Warren has neither faced nor launched especially aggressive jabs.\n\n\u201cThe goal here is to peak at the right time,\u201d Yepsen said. \u201cThe downside for Warren is that there is going to be more scrutiny of her.\u201d\n\nBut Warren also has another advantage, at least for now, in that she began organizing in the state early. Biden is now making more of an effort in that department, according to Pat Rynard, who runs the political website IowaStartingLine.\n\n\u201cWarren certainly had a head start, but Biden seems to have caught up enough in recent months,\u201d Rynard said.\n\nStill, he added that Warren has been drawing bigger crowds in the state and has made a name for herself.\n\n\u201cIowa is a place where, if you spend the time and organize and build a good campaign, you can become the front-runner. Elizabeth Warren combines her star power with a good campaign organization, and that\u2019s put her in a great position,\u201d he said.\n\nWith more than four months to go, the experts all agree that it\u2019s too early to make solid predictions. But the battle for Iowa is heating up by the day.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone is taking any of the states, particularly the early states, for granted,\u201d the first Biden ally said. \u201cI think the last couple of presidential races taught us that.\u201d", "description": "A new poll showing Sen.
