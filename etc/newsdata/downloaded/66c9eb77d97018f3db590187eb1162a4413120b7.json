(AP Photo/Gustavo Garello)\n\nBUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) \u2014 Conservative President Mauricio Macri conceded defeat in Argentina's election Sunday night, paving the way for the country's Peronist center-left to return to power under Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez as frustrated voters rejected the incumbent's handling of a bruising economic crisis that has sunk many into poverty.\n\nThe result could rattle financial markets and possibly further depreciate Argentina's already weak currency over concerns of a return to the interventionist policies of former President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez, who is Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez's vice presidential running mate. Opponents believe she would be the power behind the throne in a Peronist government - a fear dismissed by the candidates.\n\nThousands of the two Fernandez's supporters crowded their campaign headquarters in a jubilant celebration waving sky-blue and white Argentine flags and chanting \"We're coming back! We're coming back!\"\n\n\"Today, Alberto is the president of all Argentines,\" said Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez, who governed Argentina from 2007 to 2015. \"He will have a very hard task ahead of us that will require the cooperation of all Argentines.\"\n\nShe blew kisses at the crowd and thanked supporters who brandished tattoos with her image and the image of her late husband and predecessor as president, Nestor Kirchner, who died nine years ago Sunday.\n\nAlberto Fern\u00e1ndez thanked all Argentines, paid homage to the late Kirchner and said he would need the support of Macri's administration to reconstruct what he called the inherited \"ashes\" of Argentina\n\n\"The only thing that concerns us is that Argentines stop suffering once and for all,\" he told the crowd. \"We're back and we're going to be better!\"\n\nEarlier in the evening, Macri told disappointed supporters at his headquarters that he had called Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez to congratulate him and invited him for a breakfast chat Monday at the Pink Presidential Palace.\n\n\"We need an orderly transition that will bring tranquility to all Argentines, because the most important thing is the well-being of all Argentines,\" Macri said.\n\nAuthorities said Fern\u00e1ndez has 48% of the votes compared to 40.47% for Macri, with 95.54% percent of the votes counted. He needs 45% support, or 40% support with a 10 percentage point lead, over the nearest rival to avoid a runoff vote on Nov. 24. The result still needs to be confirmed.\n\nArgentina's Central bank said early Monday that it would sharply limit the amount of dollars that people can buy amid growing worries of a rapid loss of foreign exchange after Macri's loss. The bank said dollar purchases will be restricted to $200 a month by bank account and $100 cash until December. The previous amount allowed was $10,000 a month.\n\nMacri was elected president in 2015 promising to jumpstart the country's economy. Argentines rejected at the time a successor chosen by Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez, who along with her late husband dominated Argentina's political scene for 12 years and rewrote its social contract. But the divisive former leader, who embodies Argentina's enduring cycle of hope and despair, is back.\n\n\"I'm so happy. We were waiting for this change for a long time. We're tired of everything that has been happening,\" said supporter Juan Jose De Antonio, 46. \"Some of us live a different reality from those suffering hunger, but when you have a friend who lost a job, a neighbor who can't make ends meet, it hits you.\"\n\nSunday's largely peaceful election was dominated by concerns over rising poverty, a sharp depreciation of the currency and one of the world's highest inflation rates. Voters appeared to have rejected austerity measures that Macri insisted were needed to revive Argentina's struggling economy. Many Argentines have taken to the streets frustrated with cuts subsidies that have led to rises in utilities and transportation costs.\n\nThe result also marks a shift leftward for South America, which has seen conservative governments elected in Brazil, Colombia and Chile in recent years. She was considered part of the \"pink tide\" of leftist governments that arose in the region in the 1990s and 2000s.\n\nThe Peronists apparent return to power in Argentina comes as other governments in the region come under pressure for corruption, inequality and slowing growth, most notably in Chile which recently saw a protest with more than 1 million participants.", "description": "Conservative President Mauricio Macri conceded defeat in Argentina's election Sunday night, paving the way for the country's Peronist center-left to return to power under Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez as frustrated voters rejected the incumbent's handling of a bruising economic crisis that has sunk many", "authors": ["Luis Andres Henao", "Almudena Calatrava"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MBvh26ABMgrxVF1I5AgDxw--~B/aD0xOTYwO3c9Mjk0MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/1b6654353996bbac63b3774be74825f6", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
