While speculation about possible winners is always a guessing game, it is even more so this year given the many changes within the institution.\n\nAmong the many names cited as possible winners are Chinese fiction writer Can Xue, Japanese author Haruki Murakami, Russian novelist Lyudmila Ulitskaya, US novelist Joyce Carol Oates and Canada\u2019s Margaret Atwood.\n\nThe Academy\u2019s woes began in November 2017 when it disagreed about how to manage its close ties to Frenchman Jean-Claude Arnault, accused and later convicted of rape.\n\nArnault is married to Katarina Frostenson, a member of the Academy who later resigned over the scandal at the height of the #MeToo movement against harassment of women.\n\nThe pair also ran a cultural club in Stockholm that received funding from the body.\n\nUltimately, seven members quit the Academy, including then permanent secretary Sara Danius.\n\n\u201cFrom having been associated with literature of the highest order, the Nobel Prize is for many now associated with #MeToo\u2026 and a dysfunctional organisation,\u201d Swedish literary critic Madelaine Levy told AFP.\n\n\u2013 Reputational damage \u2013\n\nThe empty seats have since been filled, and in June 2019 literature professor Mats Malm took over as permanent secretary.\n\n\u201cThe changes have been very productive and we are hopeful for the future,\u201d Malm told AFP in an interview just days before the prize announcement.\n\nHe acknowledged the affair had tainted the institution and said improvements were still needed.\n\n\u201cA lot of hard work remains, of that we are certain.\u201d\n\nRetired publisher Svante Weyler said he thought the Academy\u2019s \u2014 and prize\u2019s \u2014 reputation could be repaired, \u201cbut only through wise choices of laureates.\u201d\n\nHe expected the Academy would try hard to steer clear of controversy, and probably go for one author highly regarded in literary circles and one with broader appeal.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely no one that can cause a controversial political discussion,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Olivier Truc, who recently published a book on the scandal, noted the Academy had courted controversy before.\n\n\u201cFor instance when the award was given to two sitting members of the Academy,\u201d he said, referring to the 1974 decision to give the prize to Harry Martinsson and Eyvind Johnson.\n\nGiving the nod to US singer songwriter Bob Dylan in 2016 also led some to question the Academy\u2019s judgement.\n\n\u2013 New procedure \u2013\n\nThe Academy used to be the sole arbiter of who gets the Nobel Literature Prize.\n\nBut following demands of external oversight from the Nobel Foundation which manages the prize money, the selection committee has been altered to include five members from outside the body.\n\nGiven the stain on the Academy\u2019s reputation, Levy raised the possibility \u201cthat those given the award won\u2019t accept it\u201d \u2014 as French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre did in 1964.\n\nThis year\u2019s laureate \u2014 especially if it\u2019s a male author \u2014 can expect their work and personal life to come under great scrutiny, in particular for expressions of misogyny, Levy added.", "description": "Stockholm (AFP) \u2013 The Swedish Academy will crown two Nobel literature laureates this year, making up for lost time after it skipped last", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/07/f5d73f_sara-danius-centre-was-one-members-quit-swedish-academy-post-scandal-academy-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
