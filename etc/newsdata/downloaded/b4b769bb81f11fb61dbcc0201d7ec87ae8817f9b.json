That makes the matches much easier, despite the ostensibly good team being played against.\n\nIt even seems to happen when the computer simulates matches against itself, to decide the results across the rest of the league. That will mean that teams that would be expected to be at the top of the Premier League, for instance, can be in danger of relegation in a season.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Historically, for instance, opposition managers may choose some of their weaker players when users were playing with a lower-ranked team \u2013 but it appears that mechanic has become extreme, selecting reserves in a wide variety of matches.\n\nThe bug has even drawn the attention of basketball player Joel Embiid, who posted about the issues to his Instagram story. He suggested there were a range of issues with career mode, but asked developers: \"Can we make sure big teams are not relegated or are not playing their 6th team?\"\n\nFifa 20 includes a number of updates and changes to the career mode, including the addition of simulated post-match interviews and the ability to customise the look of the manager that is being controlled by the player.\n\nRead our full review of Fifa 20 \u2013 and all the Career Mode changes \u2013 here.", "description": "Fifa players are complaining about a strange bug that makes the game easier to play.
