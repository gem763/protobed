It\u2019s a momentous decision \u2014 but one that they still may not get resolved on this day.\n\nFirst they will vote on whether \u2014 yet again \u2014 to delay their decision on Brexit.\n\nJohnson implored legislators to ratify the deal he struck this week with the bloc\u2019s 27 other leaders. He said members of the House of Commons should \u201ccome together as democrats to end this debilitating feud\u201d over Brexit, which has bitterly divided the country since British voters narrowly chose in a 2016 vote to leave the EU.\n\n\u201cNow is the time for this great House of Commons to come together\u2026 as I believe people at home are hoping and expecting,\u201d Johnson told lawmakers.\n\nBut he may not get the vote he craves.\n\nAs the session of Parliament opened, House of Commons Speaker John Bercow said he would first allow a vote on an amendment that puts the vote on the deal off until another day. Those behind the amendment say it will remove the risk that the U.K. could stumble out of the bloc without a deal on the Oct. 31 deadline \u2014 a prospect that economists say would disrupt trade and plunge the economy into recession.\n\nThe amendment makes support for the deal conditional on the legislation to implement it being passed by Parliament, something that could take several days or weeks.\n\nOne of the lawmakers behind the measure, Oliver Letwin, said it would prevent the U.K. from leaving at the end of the month \u201cby mistake, if something goes wrong during the passage of the implementing legislation.\u201d\n\nIt would also give lawmakers another chance to scrutinize \u2014 and possibly change\u2014 the Brexit departure terms while the legislation is passing through Parliament.\n\nIf this amendment passes, Johnson will have to ask the EU for a delay to Britain\u2019s departure date. Last month Parliament passed a law compelling the government to do that if no deal is approved by Saturday.\n\nThe prime minister signaled that he would do that, but under duress. He is compelled by law to ask for the extension, but he said \u201cit cannot change my judgment that further delay is pointless, expensive and deeply corrosive of public trust.\u201d\n\nAnd he warned Saturday that the bloc\u2019s approval could not be guaranteed.\n\n\u201cThere is very little appetite among our friends in the EU for this business to be protracted by one extra day,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThey have had three and a half years of this debate.\u201d\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron made the same point a day earlier in Brussels, when he was asked whether he would support an extension to the deadline in case British lawmakers rejected Johnson\u2019s Brexit proposal.\n\n\u201cI want us to finish this off and speak about the future,\u201d Macron said. \u201cThe Oct. 31 date must be respected. I don\u2019t believe new delays should be granted.\u201d\n\nThe EU\u2019s budget commissioner, Guenther Oettinger, was quoted Saturday as telling Germany\u2019s Welt am Sonntag newspaper that if British lawmakers reject Johnson\u2019s deal, the U.K. is likely to crash out of the bloc with no deal.\n\nBrexit Secretary Stephen Barclay urged lawmakers to reject the amendment.\n\n\u201cIt would cause further delay when our constituents and our businesses want an end to uncertainty and are calling for us to get this done,\u201d he said.\n\nIf the amendment passes, Britain could still leave the EU on Oct. 31, if Parliament approves the legislation \u2014 the Withdrawal Agreement Bill \u2014 in time. The government plans to introduce the bill early next week and could hold late-night sittings of Parliament in hope of getting it passed within days.\n\nAs lawmakers gathered inside Parliament \u2014 their first Saturday sitting since the 1982 Falklands War \u2014 tens of thousands of anti-Brexit demonstrators gathered in London for a march on the building, demanding a new referendum on whether Britain should leave the EU or remain.\n\n\u201cI fervently believe that we should remain in the EU,\u201d said Bruce Nicole, an Anglican vicar from Camberley, south of London, who attended the protest. \u201cI am British but I am also European. I don\u2019t believe the current deal offers any benefits at all.\u201d\n\nSince striking a deal with the EU on Thursday, Johnson has been both imploring and arm-twisting Conservative and opposition lawmakers alike as he tries to win majority support for his deal.\n\nJohnson\u2019s Conservative Party holds only 288 seats in the 650-seat House of Commons, so he will have to rely on support from other parties and independent lawmakers to get over the line.\n\nThe result looks set to be close, although Johnson has had some success winning over both hard-core Conservative Brexiteers and a handful of opposition Labour lawmakers who represent pro-Brexit parts of the country.\n\nJohnson hopes for success in getting a fractious Parliament to back the deal after his predecessor, Theresa May, failed three times to get lawmakers behind her Brexit plan.\n\nYet his hopes of getting the deal through Parliament were dealt a blow when his Northern Ireland ally, the Democratic Unionist Party, said it would not back him. The party says Johnson\u2019s Brexit package \u2014 which carves out special status for Northern Ireland to keep an open border with EU member Ireland \u2014 is bad for the region and weakens its bonds with the rest of the U.K.\n\n\u201cWe will not be supporting the government, we will be voting against,\u201d said the party\u2019s deputy leader, Nigel Dodds. \u201cBecause it isn\u2019t Brexit for the whole of the United Kingdom.\u201d\n\nTo make up for the votes of 10 DUP lawmakers, Johnson has tried to persuade members of the left-of-center Labour Party to support the deal. Late Friday the government promised to bolster protections for the environment and workers\u2019 rights to allay Labour fears that the Conservative government plans to slash those protections after Brexit.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn dismissed those promises as inadequate.\n\n\u201cThis deal is not good for jobs, damaging for industry and a threat to our environment and natural world,\u201d he said. \u201cSupporting the government this afternoon would merely fire the starting pistol in a race to the bottom in regulations and standards.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMike Corder in contributed to this story.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP\u2019s full coverage of Brexit and British politics at https://www.apnews.com/Brexit", "description": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 In their first weekend session in 37 years, British lawmakers in Parliament debated whether to accept Prime Minister Boris Johnson's", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/19/285d44_britain-brexit-38220-britain-prime-minister-boris-johnson-delivers-statement-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
