The pair were running a different race to everybody else, leaving Jamaica\u2019s Rushell Clayton 1\u00bd seconds adrift in bronze, propelling each other to unheard-of heights.\n\nWhile McLaughlin has been heralded as the next face of the sport, having qualified for the Rio Olympics while still a high-school student, Muhammad has proved successful in keeping her at bay. Never had they waged so fierce a duel, with Muhammad, the Olympic champion, lowering the record that she had set already this year at the US championships in Iowa.\n\nMuhammad has had to struggle for the glory. Indeed, it is central to the fascination of her dynamic with McLaughlin that the two have followed such contrasting paths. \u201cI\u2019ve started from the bottom and really worked my way up, whereas Sydney has been at the top of the game from the beginning,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen she was eliminated in the first round of Olympic trials for London 2012, Muhammad even had to run unsponsored, needing to be supported by her mother, Nadirah, a child protection specialist, and father Askia, a professor of Islamic studies in New York.", "description": "Dalilah Muhammad electrified these championships on Friday night with a world record in the 400\u2009metres hurdles, shading her American compatriot Sydney McLaughlin by seven hundredths to register an extraordinary 52.", "authors": ["Oliver Brown", "Chief Sports Feature Writer", "Jim White"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/athletics/2019/10/04/TELEMMGLPICT000212008020-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqNLFz2QTH6RCwPE4UPA-sBYq93YgYe2tuuZP19U7RmE4.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
