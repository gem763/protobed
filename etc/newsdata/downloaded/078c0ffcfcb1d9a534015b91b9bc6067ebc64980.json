He had told Reuters earlier on Friday that eight bodies had been found but said that information was incorrect.\n\nThe cause of the accident was not yet clear.\n\nLocal media showed a crowd of hundreds of Tshisekedi supporters hitting the streets of Kinshasa after the news broke on Friday morning, fearing that the plane crash had been some kind of failed coup attempt against Tshisekedi.
