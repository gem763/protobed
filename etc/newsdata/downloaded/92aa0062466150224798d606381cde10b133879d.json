(NYSE: AZO) shares fell after hours Tuesday after the retailer reported an adjusted EPS and sales miss in the fourth quarter.\n\nSell-side analysts on Wednesday shrugged off the margin and administrative cost concerns that seemed to spook investors, saying the company is set for continued earnings growth.\n\nThe Analysts\n\nWedbush analyst Seth Basham maintained an Outperform rating on AutoZone with a price target of $1,240.\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s Simeon Gutman maintained an Equal-weight rating on the stock and raised the target price from $1,050 to $1,100.\n\nStephens analyst Daniel Imbro maintained an Overweight rating and $1,230 target price.\n\nThe Takeaways\n\nThe concerns over gross margin and administrative expenses that appeared to cause the stock sell-off Tuesday are likely \u201coverdone,\u201d Wedbush\u2019s Basham said in a Wednesday note.\n\nSolid commercial growth and ongoing, positive Do-It-Yourself comps should lead to mid-single digit sales and EBIT growth, the analyst said.\n\n\u201cCombined with share repurchases, AZO is a relatively consistent + (high single digit) EPS growth story that deserves a premium valuation multiple, in our view.\u201d\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s Gutman did caution about elevated expenses in the near-term, but sees a steady-as-it-goes picture with a risk vs. reward calculation that seems balanced.\n\nView more earnings on AZO\n\n\u201cAZO is a steady business with a proven track record in a defensive segment,\u201d the analyst said in a Wednesday note.\n\nDo It For Me Does It For Analysts\n\nGutman said investments in the \u201cDo It For Me\u201d sector are paying off and led to a fourth straight quarter of double-digit growth in that business.\n\nThe commercial sales growth remains strong despite cooler and wet weather that often keeps people from working on their cars, which was a good sign for Stephens\u2019 Imbro, who also took encouragement from accelerating sales through the end of the quarter.\n\n\u201cAZO has additional commercial initiatives that should augment same store sales into FY20, and we believe the company will continue taking market share in both the DIY and DIFM markets,\u201d the analyst said in a Wednesday note.\n\nPrice Action\n\nAutoZone shares were down 1% at $1,085.71 at the time of publication Wednesday.\n\nRelated Links:\n\nAutoZone's Solid Q3 Results, Strong Hub Strategy Keep UBS Bullish\n\nSell-Side Raise AutoZone Price Targets Following Big Earnings Beat\n\nPhoto by Steve Morgan via Wikimedia.\n\nLatest Ratings for AZO\n\nDate Firm Action From To Sep 2019 Maintains Equal-Weight Sep 2019 Maintains Sector Perform Sep 2019 Maintains Outperform\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for AZO\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\nSee more from Benzinga\n\n\u00a9 2019 Benzinga.com.
