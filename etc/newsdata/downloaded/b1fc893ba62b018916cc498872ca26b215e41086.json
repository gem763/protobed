There are lots of games they could reschedule in exactly the same way as with the FA Cup or Premier League where there is a basket of fixtures as we can normally work it out to have the right game at the right time.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not something we\u2019ve been able to do and I am going to take it up again with Uefa to try and make sure they are conscious of, when they are making scheduling decisions, they look at which games present a particular risk and try and schedule it.\u201d\n\nThe senior South Yorkshire officer, who oversaw policing of England fans in Russia during last year\u2019s World Cup, added: \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate because you can see the risk and we\u2019d much rather prevent a situation from developing than trying to either manage it on the night or regret it afterwards. Our position, and the FA\u2019s, is \u2018let\u2019s have a sensible conversation with Uefa about fixtures\u2019.\u201d", "description": "The UK\u2019s most senior police officer with responsibility for football wrote to Uefa to try to move England\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifier against the Czech Republic from its Friday night slot in Prague over fears of fans misbehaving.", "authors": ["Jason Burt", "Chief Football Correspondent", "Luke Edwards", "Sam Wallace"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/06/TELEMMGLPICT000199956199-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqGUO3hiIoo3ENbv-liualhpGzFcidJtGZ6a34nmkba5U.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
