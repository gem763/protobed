The new streaming entertainment service is chock-full of original content and will launch at a super low $7.99 per month. (There's also a way to get free access for a whole year!) Here are the details.\n\nApple TV+ is a streaming video on demand (SVOD) service that will include exclusive original shows, movies and documentaries, just like Netflix. Apple is investing a lot of money into this project with a star-studded lineup of big budget productions already in the can.\n\nThis includes a reboot of Steven Spielberg's Amazing Stories, news drama Morning Wars headlined by Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston, an Emily Dickinson biopic, the sci-fi series See starring Jason Momoa and a Clerks-style comedy from JJ Abrams. Other big names recruited by Apple include M. Night Shyamalan, Oprah Winfrey, Sesame Street and Snoopy. That's a pretty impressive lineup. (Lay off Snoopy, he's still cool.)\n\nThe new streaming service can be accessed through an Apple TV+ app on iOS devices and most smart TVs from major manufacturers. The app will reportedly offer suggestions for shows and movies from other streaming services too (although you'll need to pay for those separately.)\n\nApple TV Plus Australian pricing\n\nStarting on 10 September, customers who purchase any new iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, Mac or iPod touch will be given free access to Apple TV+ for one year. For everyone else, it will cost $7.99 a month. Apple will also be offering a free seven-day trial.\n\nThat's a bit cheaper than the competition - Netflix Australia and Stan currently start at around $10 a month while the yet-to-launch Disney Plus will cost $8.99,\n\nApple TV Plus content library\n\nAccording to Apple, the launch lineup will feature \"originals from the world\u2019s greatest storytellers\". You can see a breakdown of the announced shows and what they are about here.\n\nIt's important to note that Apple will be eschewing licensed content for the time being. Unlike Netflix, Stan and Foxtel it will only be showing its own original content on the service. This helps to explain why it's priced cheaper.\n\nIf you prefer watching third-party movies and old TV shows over original programming, Apple TV+ probably isn't for you.\n\nApple TV Plus Australian availability\n\nApple TV+ launches globally - including Australia - on 1 November, 2019. If you're keen to sign up at launch, you can leave your details on the Apple TV+ website. Apple will then notify you the moment the service becomes available.", "description": "Today's big Apple event was primarily focused on the iPhone 11 - but we also learned more about the company's Netflix competitor; Apple TV+.
