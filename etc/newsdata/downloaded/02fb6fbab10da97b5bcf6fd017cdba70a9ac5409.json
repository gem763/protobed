Donald Trump was never supposed to reach the presidency. The powers that be \u2014 the powers that were \u2014 were supposed to prevent something like that from happening. The ones pulling the strings, those the fever-swamp conspiracists assumed were actually in charge, simply wouldn\u2019t allow someone like Trump to access such power.\n\nBut then, in late 2016, Trump won. The man who was never supposed to be anywhere near power was sitting, eating, tweeting in the White House. Trump, the man backed by so many on the far-right, was president of the United States.\n\nAnd America\u2019s militias, with Trump from the beginning, didn\u2019t know what to do. \u201cFor the first time in its 25-year history, the militia movement had a presidential candidate that they love,\u201d Mark Pitcavage, a senior researcher with the Anti-Defamation League, told ThinkProgress. \u201cThis had never happened before.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuddenly, the government the militias had long feared and railed against was controlled by their man. Like that, they were forced to look for a new reason for being, a new group or movement to target with their ire.\n\nA year and a half into Trump\u2019s presidency, the militias seem no closer to finding an answer. But that hasn\u2019t stopped their search. Nor has it quelled fears regarding the role militias may play in rising domestic tensions. After all, 2020 is just around the corner, and a historically unpopular president who has been unwilling to admit defeat will face reelection.\n\nOf course, there were concerns about how militias, and the far-right more broadly, would react to Trump\u2019s assumed loss in 2016. \u201cThis was something we were really concerned about, and we wrote about it in advance of the election, and we were really concerned that when the election was over and [Hillary Clinton] was the next president \u2014 as all the polls said she would be \u2014 that we were going to have real a problem on our hands,\u201d Pitcavage said.\n\nThat was before Trump acquired the reins of power, reins he\u2019ll carry through the next presidential election, all while ignoring \u2014 and, in some cases, stoking \u2014 the violent froth of white supremacists and neo-fascists on the far-right. And so, as Dan Nexon, an associate professor at Georgetown University, told ThinkProgress, \u201cOne of the questions is, in these unprecedented political times, full of tumult and confusion, you have to ask, \u2018Are the militias primed for violence?'\u201d\n\nWandering militias\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how many of these paramilitary groups, nominally dedicated to upholding Constitutional rights, currently exist in the U.S., although the number is generally understood to be in the low hundreds. But it\u2019s clear that, in terms of individual members, militias have only grown in popularity over the past few years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile their numbers may have been smaller, the unifying force motivating militia groups was clearer under previous presidential administrations. Under George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and especially Barack Obama, America\u2019s militias had a narrative to which they could cling. Their message centered on globalist cabals and secretive organizations stealing America\u2019s sovereignty, replacing red-blooded Americans with neutered, disarmed subjects. It was an accessible narrative, one that gained remarkable credence over the past few years if numbers are to be believed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019d be like open season on antifa. There\u2019s nothing you could do to stop it.\u201d\n\nIt was also a narrative that played a role in events like the Oklahoma City bombing, or the Malheur occupation a few years ago, both of which had their own ties to the American militia movement. Strains of it were also evident in more recent events, like the attempted car-bombing of an immigrant community by a handful of Trump supporters in Kansas, or the so-called \u201cWhite Rabbit Militia\u201d members who wanted to use \u201cguerrilla tactics\u201d like bombing a Minnesota mosque.\n\nUnder Trump, though, that narrative has taken a beating; it\u2019s tough to claim that the government is gunning for you when your man is the one in power, after all. As such, the militias began cycling through some alternatives for a new, primary foe.\n\nOne of the first, in 2017, was antifa: the anonymous, black bloc groups comfortable with public violence, especially when it came to the suddenly public presence of fascists and white supremacists like Richard Spencer.\n\nBut when militias decided to show up at last year\u2019s far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, claiming they were there to keep the peace, they never expected the backlash they incurred. As Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) said, \u201cYou saw the militia walking down the street. You would have thought they were an army.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter Charlottesville erupted in violence, with a white supremacist killing counter-protester Heather Heyer, the militias began pulling back from the more overt racists and neo-fascists. \u201cThe Charlottesville backlash has caused them to back down from a lot of the events that they were showing up to, especially white supremacist events,\u201d Pitcavage said. (Militias weren\u2019t directly involved in the worst of the violence last year, but their presence exacerbated tensions, according to local officials.)\n\nBut threats of violence from antifa groups \u2014 even if they\u2019re imagined \u2014 still motivate militia leaders, and help organize the militia movement writ large, at least to an extent.\n\n\u201cTake the attorney general of Florida, for example,\u201d Oath Keepers militia head Stewart Rhodes told ThinkProgress, referring to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi (R). \u201cImagine if she were assaulted \u2014 or even worse, if some antifa group were to go and attack and burn down an ICE agent\u2019s home with his family inside. Then it\u2019d be like open season on antifa. There\u2019s nothing you could do to stop it.\u201d\n\nAmerica first\n\nWhere antifa has dissipated as a force over the past year, two other groups began to unite America\u2019s militias, both of which have been demonized by the president militias continue to admire. The first, unsurprisingly, was immigrants \u2014 or, rather, the fear that America was suddenly being inundated by undocumented migrants. And the second was Muslims, American or otherwise. In that sense, the \u201cWhite Rabbit\u201d and Kansas incidents were illustrative, targeting mosques and Somali-American communities, respectively.\n\nThese communities have \u201clong been secondary enemies for the militia movement,\u201d Pitcavage said. And with Trump continuing to smear and dehumanize immigrants and Muslims alike, these two groups will likely remain targets for militias moving forward.\n\nBut, barring some kind of massive Islamist terror attack, these groups likely won\u2019t provide a sufficient rallying cry for America\u2019s militias \u2014 or at least the kind of rallying cry that a supposedly totalitarian federal government once presented for militias.\n\nInstead, over the past few months, another topic has begun gaining strange credence among militia and far-right circles: civil war. Namely, the threat that apparently violent leftist groups pose to the country and the supposed danger that a swelling move toward socialist-style policies presents for Americans.\n\nBreaking! Democrats Officially Announce Civil War Plan In America https://t.co/V55NZayrSI \u2014 Alex Jones (@RealAlexJones) June 27, 2018\n\n\u201cThe thing that\u2019s concerning to me right now is\u2026 this discussion of civil war,\u201d Daryl Johnson, a former Department of Homeland Security official focused on monitoring the far-right, told ThinkProgress.\n\n\u201cIt seems like this is a theme that\u2019s kind of resonating out there \u2014 that the militias feel there is an impending civil war that\u2019s brewing between liberals and conservatives, Democrats and Republicans, the militia versus antifa,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThat\u2019s very concerning when you have a movement that is as well-armed [as militias], and conducts paramilitary training, and stockpiling and prepping and everything else. When you have them getting paranoid and discussing the possibility of a civil war, it\u2019s not out of the realm of possibility of them actually trying trying to instigate it or provoke it.\u201d\n\nAmerica is heading in the direction of another Harpers Ferry. After that comes Ft. Sumter. https://t.co/5PmwlwcdSQ \u2014 Steve King (@SteveKingIA) June 24, 2018\n\nAmerica\u2019s militia members aren\u2019t the only ones on the far-right who have begun wondering aloud \u2014 or even frothing \u2014 at the prospect of civil war. Rep. Steve King (R.-IA) has hinted at a looming civil war, and publications like The Federalist have begun publishing visceral imaginations of scalping liberals, written by RV salesmen.\n\n\u201cIn terms of where the country\u2019s going, I really, personally\u2026 feel that the country is actually at a tipping point,\u201d George Curbelo, the state commander for the New York Lightfoot Militia, told ThinkProgress. \u201cRight now what we\u2019re looking at is a potential flash-point for a growing trend towards violence [against] the right by those radicalized on the left.\u201d (Curbelo didn\u2019t mention who he specifically viewed as a threat from those \u201con the left,\u201d but he did say that America\u2019s \u201ceducation system has been overrun by liberal professors, by\u2026 openly communist and openly Marxist professors.\u201d)\n\nWhen ThinkProgress asked Stewart Rhodes, the head of America\u2019s most prominent militia, about any parallels he views between the current American political moment and U.S. history, he also cited the Civil War. As Rhodes said when asked for American historical comparisons:\n\nUnfortunately, the Civil War. Maybe some of the discontent during the \u201960s, where you had the Symbionese Liberation Army or the Weather Underground blowing stuff up. I think we\u2019re in danger of that. I think we\u2019re in danger of that from both of those elements [from far-left and white supremacists]\u2026 Both of those fringe elements want to start conflict \u2014 they want, in their own heads, [to] spark the revolution, or they\u2019re going to spark the race war, and they think they\u2019re going to come out on top out of the chaos. They both want it. So how do you keep the retards on the fringes from blowing this up in our faces? That\u2019s kind of where we\u2019re at.\n\nAll the president\u2019s men\n\nOf course, whether it comes to the militias\u2019 future direction or the prospects for any kind of looming domestic turmoil \u2014 or civil war \u2014 there\u2019s one great, all-consuming unknown: Trump.\n\nThe question is not simply whether the president would support militia mobilization against immigrant communities or far-left protesters; after all, even without the actual threat of far-left violence, it\u2019s clear Trump and his sycophants aren\u2019t exactly informed by the reality surrounding them. Rather, one of the looming questions is whether the president would respect the results of any of the upcoming elections \u2014 or resist handing over the office of the presidency if he loses to a Democratic challenger come 2020.\n\n\u201cWhat you would see from Oath Keepers in that scenario would be arguments that Trump should not concede.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump is not [Richard] Nixon \u2014 in some ways [he\u2019s] much worse than Nixon, because Nixon ultimately had a sense of shame, some sense of responsibility to country,\u201d Nexon said. \u201cIf Trump loses or is impeached, he\u2019ll go back Trump Tower, he\u2019ll probably be fighting attempts to imprison him, and will be tweeting to millions of loyal followers he\u2019s being persecuted and democratic will is being thwarted.\u201d\n\nTo many in the militia community, the notion of Trump refusing to concede defeat is laughable. \u201cIt\u2019s a ridiculous concern,\u201d Curbelo told ThinkProgress. \u201cIt really is. Our constitutional republic, the laws of our republic, guarantee that that doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d If anything, the threat of violence from a far-left crowd in response to a Trump 2020 victory seems a much likelier scenario, at least to militia leaders.\n\nTo be sure, Trump\u2019s potential refusal to concede would not mean that any militias would instantly come to his aid. But for those who follow these movements and these groups, even if there aren\u2019t explicit calls to support Trump, that doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be dog-whistles aplenty for militia supporters.\n\n\u201cWhat you would see from Oath Keepers in that scenario would be arguments that Trump should not concede, that clearly there was large-scale voter fraud, that the liberals or collectivists or whoever sort of orchestrated the thing to subvert the real will of the people,\u201d Sam Jackson, a visiting researcher with VOX-Pol who has extensively studied Oath Keepers, told ThinkProgress. \u201cBut you wouldn\u2019t explicitly see calls for violence.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Oath Keepers have been working on a propaganda movie called \"GOOD GUYS WITH GUNS \u2014 How an Armed Citizenry Deters Tyranny and Atrocities.\" The trailer shows a pic of Hillary Clinton while the narrator says, \"The only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.\" pic.twitter.com/qLBCScLfJK \u2014 JJ MacNab (@jjmacnab) July 15, 2018\n\nIn that instance, the threat would seem to come less from some type of top-down, organized front creating earthworks around the White House. (Although \u201cif the militia ever does decide to go offensive, that\u2019s going to be a major problem,\u201d Johnson added.) Rather, it would be the type of small-cell operations that are so often responsible for militia-linked violence we\u2019ve seen over the past quarter-century, from Oklahoma City to small-town Kansas.\n\n\u201cA paramilitary response to a Trump loss? We should be thinking about it, the sooner the better,\u201d Jackson added. \u201cIf a Trump loss is in the cards, those of us who don\u2019t want to see paramilitary violence should start thinking about it sooner or later. The last thing we want is to be blindsided.\u201d\n\nSo maybe that\u2019s where we are \u2014 maybe America\u2019s militias, having spent the past 18 months looking for a cause, are simply waiting for the crisis to come, a crisis that\u2019s now years in the making. After all, America\u2019s militias never expected to be here. But that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t know where they\u2019re going.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/oath-keepers.jpg?w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "published_at": "2018-08-08"}
