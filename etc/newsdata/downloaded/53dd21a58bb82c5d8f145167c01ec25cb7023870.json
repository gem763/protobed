I\u2019m going to be doing documentaries. I\u2019ll do interviews when something comes along that feels like \u2018OG! I want to sit down and talk with that person.\u2019 But I\u2019m kinda done with the every day,\u201d she said.\n\nApple said a new episode of \u201cOprah\u2019s Book Club\u201d will be available every two months.\n\nCoates, who won the 2015 National Book Award for his non-fiction work \u201cBetween the World and Me\u201d about race in the United States, said on Monday that being picked was a \u201ctremendous, tremendous honour.\u201d", "description": "Oprah Winfrey on Monday announced the first pick of her revamped popular book club with Apple's new television streaming service but made clear she had no plans to return to hosting a regular TV talk show.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1433005089&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M1GE", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
