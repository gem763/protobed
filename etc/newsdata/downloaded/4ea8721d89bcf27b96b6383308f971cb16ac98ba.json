The new Fifa recommendations from the Football Stakeholders Committee will go to the Fifa Council meeting on October 24. It is likely to see players aged 22 and over limited to eight international loans in and out, with that number dropping to six by 2022-23.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere will also be a maximum of three loans in and three out by the same two clubs. A \"clearing house\" will also be launched to ensure automated payment of solidarity contributions and \"boost the amount duly paid to training clubs while improving the transparency of the whole system\".", "description": "A cap on agents' fees and new limits on international loan deals are close to being launched by Fifa as part of long-awaited efforts to regulate the transfer market.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/pxV28JUI6qJCKXe6ZjZXfQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0mivNqk3prKZvu_GnR3hyw--~B/aD0xNDg2O3c9MjM3ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/42b13d1b16db1152851a120f2830a176", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
