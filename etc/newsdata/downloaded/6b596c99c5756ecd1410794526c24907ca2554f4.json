Same even goes for Greta Thunberg \u2013 we do \u201cget it\u201d actually. But ER is all about what we should not be doing. Not driving. Not flying. Not eating meat. Not buying clothes. Not consuming tech and gadgets. It is all unrelentingly depressingly unrealistically negative.\u201d - Sean O\u2019Grady, The Independent\n\nCool heads are needed to persuade people.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t the role of the environment movement to say yes or no to things, but by the same token I would urge a degree of caution. We are all worried about another 10 years of business as usual, but when groups like ours and others plan campaigns, we have to build a really big tent with a lot of the community onside.\u201d - Lyndon Schneiders, The Guardian\n\nPreventing people going about their everyday life will just cause opposition.\n\n\"What we'd be saying to people thinking of engaging in the protests is - yes you're right to be concerned about the environment, but there are constructive ways to bring everybody with you. If people are prevented from getting to their place of work or going about their daily business, it will just create division that's unnecessary.\" - Richard Guiney, Dublin Town CEO", "description": "The group's tactics may be alienating the people they want onside.", "authors": ["Andy Wells", "Freelance Writer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/HLygB1aoY1WYDiBgHYf6kA--~B/aD0yMzk1O3c9MzU5MztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/66b9d3d0-ef74-11e9-b4f7-d85680b9eb2c", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
