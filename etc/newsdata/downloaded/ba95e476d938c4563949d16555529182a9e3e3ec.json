They are being held at a detention facility in Jiangsu province, near Shanghai.\n\nMr. Harlan is the founder of China Horizons, a group that arranges for Americans to teach English in China, and Ms. Peterson is assistant director of the group.\n\nA U.S. official said the timing of the arrests coincided with the arrest of a Chinese official in New York on visa fraud charges. The detentions in Jiangsu appear to be a Cold War-style hostage-taking, the official said.\n\nThe China Horizon website says Mr. Harlan has taught English in China since 2002 and notes that Ms. Peterson has spent the past eight years in and out of China. China has used detentions of foreign nationals in the past in response to arrests of Chinese officials overseas.\n\nFor example, as many as 11 Canadians were arrested in China on questionable criminal charges following the Dec. 1 arrest by Canadian authorities of Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies.\n\nMs. Meng\u2019s arrest was carried out in response to Justice Department information that she was linked to trade with Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions.\n\nChina also arrested a Canadian couple, Kevin and Julia Garratt, in 2014 and held them for nearly two years on trumped-up spying charges.\n\nTheir arrests were carried out in apparent retaliation for the arrest by Canadian authorities of Chinese hacker Su Bin, who was later imprisoned for his role in stealing Boeing C-17 secrets as well as data on F-35 and F-22 jets.\n\nThe detentions follow the FBI\u2019s arrest Sept. 13 of Chinese government official Zhongsan Liu after a lengthy investigation into Chinese visa fraud related to Beijing\u2019s efforts to garner American high technology at U.S. universities.\n\nAccording to court papers, Mr. Liu headed a Chinese front group in New Jersey called the China Association for International Exchange of Personnel (CAIEP).\n\nThe case also involves contacts between Mr. Liu and a Chinese government-funded Confucius Institute on a U.S. university campus.\n\nAround 100 Confucius Institutes in the United States have come under fire from critics who say they are being used for Chinese influence operations in support of the Beijing government.\n\nThe location of the Americans\u2019 detention also suggests linkage to another FBI case: the detention in October 2018 of Yanjun Xu, a Ministry of State Security intelligence officer indicted on charges related to the theft of aviation trade secrets.\n\nMr. Xu is deputy division director with the MSS\u2019s Jiangsu State Security Department, a unit that has been linked to trade secrets\u2019 theft.\n\nMr. Liu was charged with conspiracy to fraudulently obtain U.S. visas for Chinese officials involved in an effort to recruit Asian-Americans and others who have valuable high-technology experts. Six universities that were not named in court papers were targets of the scheme. They were located in Massachusetts, Georgia, New Jersey and elsewhere.\n\nAccording to the FBI criminal complaint, Mr. Liu worked to obtain J-1 research visas to support Chinese scholars in the United States.\n\nProsecutors, however, charged that Mr. Liu secured the visas \u201cwith the knowledge that, once in the United States, the CAIEP employees would not in fact principally conduct research on behalf of their sponsoring universities, but rather would work fulltime for CAIEP.\u201d\n\nThe operation was part of a Chinese government recruitment plan called the Thousand Talents Program, aimed at gaining American technology and intellectual property.\n\nThe Pentagon\u2019s most recent annual report on the Chinese military stated that the Thousand Talents Program funnels technology to the Chinese military and civilian sectors. A White House report published in 2018 stated that more than 44,000 highly skilled overseas Chinese have returned to China through the programs.\n\nAt the time of Mr. Liu\u2019s arrest, Assistant Attorney General John C. Demers, director of the National Security Section, said the United States will prosecute government-backed visa fraud while welcoming Chinese researchers.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to confront Chinese government attempts to subvert American law to advance its own interests in diverting U.S. research and know-how to China,\u201d he said.\n\nA Chinese Embassy spokesman and China Horizon did not respond to email requests for comment.\n\nPOMPEO ON CHINA\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo has revealed that the United States will insist on strict verification measures for any future trade deal with China.\n\nIn an interview for my book \u201cDeceiving the Sky: Inside China\u2019s Drive for Global Supremacy,\u201d Mr. Pompeo outlined the Trump administration\u2019s new get-tough policy toward China. Asked about China\u2019s past failure to abide by agreements made with the United States, Mr. Pompeo said the issue is something \u201cwe face in every negotiation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe answer is always really very simple: Whatever outcomes are determined have to be verifiable,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said.\n\n\u201cThey have to have a methodology by which enforcement can take place, which means sharing of information and transparency so that we can see what the other side is doing so you can understand if, in fact, they\u2019re abiding by the agreement.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, a trade deal will need \u201cenforcement mechanisms.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere needs to be things that happen in the event that one side or the other \u2014 in this case you\u2019re referring to Chinese malfeasance \u2014 but one side or the other doesn\u2019t abide by their agreements,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said.\n\n\u201cThere needs to be a built-in mechanism inside the agreement that says we\u2019re going to verify, we\u2019re going to have an evaluative process, and then in the event there are breaches of the agreement that one side or the other is not living up to their commitments, that there is an enforcement mechanism.\u201d\n\nThe enforcement mechanism could include a withdrawal from the agreement or other tools that could be used that would \u201cbring to bear to convince both parties that it is appropriate, when a commitment is made, that one needs to honor it.\u201d\n\nAsked if such mechanisms can be reached in a trade deal, Mr. Pompeo said, \u201cOnly time will tell.\u201d\n\nChina already backed out of a draft agreement with the Trump administration reached in May that would have recognized China\u2019s unfair trade practices and illicit activities.\n\nLast week, President Trump announced a partial trade deal he described as Phase 1 had been reached and would involve the United States holding off on further tariffs in exchange for China\u2019s purchase of billions of dollars worth of American farm products.\n\nHowever, Bloomberg News reported Monday that China wants more talks before signing the partial deal and will be sending a delegation of negotiators to Washington headed by Vice Premier Liu He.\n\nAdditional talks are needed before Chinese President Xi Jinping signs the agreement, according to the news agency, quoting people familiar with the matter.\n\nAn agreement could be signed during the APEC summit in Chile next month.\n\nThe Chinese are seeking a halt in additional U.S. tariffs planned for December in addition to the tariffs that were to go into effect this week.\n\n\u2022 Contact Bill Gertz on Twitter @BillGertz.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
