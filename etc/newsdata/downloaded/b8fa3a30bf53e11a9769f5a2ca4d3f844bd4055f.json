However, we are continuing with our investigations to establish who posted it\".\n\nBooth said it was posted on the pornographic site without his client's consent.\n\n\"We want to know how it got there and who posted it. At the moment, we are waiting for the school to finish its investigation. We are asking everybody to respect my client and her family members' rights.\n\n\"Her uncle's name was publicised in the media. The man has got nothing to do with the case and what happened to him is unfair. He is a well-known public figure and we will be taking legal action soon,\" Booth said.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, he vowed to take steps to have the video removed from the website.\n\nBooth also noted that any private messages, photos or videos sent by one person to another could not be distributed without the sender's approval.\n\nThis follows widely circulated explicit videos and pictures of a woman many claim to be Viotti on social media and WhatsApp. News24 has not been able to independently verify whether the woman in the visual material is indeed her.\n\nViotti reportedly left Bishops with immediate effect last week after the school reportedly appointed an attorney to investigate what the principal described as \"serious misconduct\".\n\nNo crime was being investigated as the pupil in question was not underaged.\n\nAccording to IOL, Viotti was allegedly involved in a sexual relationship with an 18-year-old matric pupil at the Rondebosch school.\n\nWeekend Argus reported that the pupil had tried to break off the relationship. According to a source, Viotti reportedly sent threatening WhatsApp messages to the teenager.\n\nNews24 earlier reported that more pupils have been \"affected over a number of years\" by Viotti's alleged \"serious misconduct\".\n\nREAD | Bishops teacher: Several boys have been 'affected over a number of years', says school\n\n\"We have confirmed that there have been several boys who have been affected over a number of years,\" principal Guy Pearson said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nPearson added the school was doing everything it could to ensure the mental well-being of pupils, staff, and others affected by the \"very sad events\".\n\nHe appealed to respect the dignity and privacy of the people affected while the investigation continued.\n\nViotti is the daughter of Dave Mallett, who is a history teacher and first team rugby coach at the school, and the granddaughter of Anthony Mallett, the school's headmaster from 1964 to 1982, the Sunday Times reported.\n\n- Compiled by Riaan Grobler with Ntwaagae Seleka", "description": "A free pornographic website has removed an explicit video purportedly of Fiona Viotti who resigned from Bishops Diocesan College in Cape Town amid allegations of a sexual affair with a matric pupil.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9468/db1d94741ed2495796309d399c51edd1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
