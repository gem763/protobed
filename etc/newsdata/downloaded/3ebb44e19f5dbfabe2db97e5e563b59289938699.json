And no one can ,\u201d Mr. Schultz said . Of his rivals who have denounced the super PAC reversal, he added, \u201cIf they were being attacked with $10 million-plus of outside money in a general election sense, I would love to see what they would do.\u201d\n\nMr. Biden\u2019s allies are not only concerned about his fund-raising: There\u2019s also the spending . Mr. Biden raised $15.7 million in the third quarter, but he spent $2 million more than that. Among his biggest expenses was more than $920,000 on chartered jets.\n\nTerry McAuliffe, the former governor of Virginia and a prolific fund-raiser, said that donors were \u201cfurious\u201d about the jet spending and called the campaign\u2019s overall money situation \u201cvery alarming.\u201d Mr. McAuliffe\u2019s wife recently invited donors to attend a fund-raiser for Mr. Biden at their home in early November.\n\nMr. Schultz, when asked about the chartered travel, said that \u201cwhatever maximizes Joe Biden and voter interaction, the greater chance we have to win.\u201d T he campaign said Mr. Biden had flown commercial but declined to indicate when his last such flight was.\n\nThe pressure over money is bound to intensify as the leading Democratic campaigns compete in the early voting states and the extraordinarily expensive media markets of Super Tuesday states like California. Ms. Warren, currently Mr. Biden\u2019s top rival, has already reserved $2.3 million more in television ads in the early voting states than he has, according to Advertising Analytics, a media-tracking firm . In the last 30 days, she spent twice as much as Mr. Biden on Facebook ads, while Mr. Buttigieg spent more than three times as much as Mr. Biden , who has begun buying more online ads after he sharply scaled back his digital spending over the summer.", "description": "Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign is spending more money than it is taking in, unlike his top 2020 rivals, and showing an inability to galvanize big financial backers or energize many online donors.", "authors": ["Shane Goldmacher"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/26/us/politics/26biden-money/26biden-money-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
