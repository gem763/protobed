Eisenberg, placed a rough transcript of the call in a computer system typically reserved for the country\u2019s most closely guarded secrets. Mr. Trump later directed that a reconstructed transcript be released amid intensifying scrutiny from House Democrats.\n\nThe review shows how quickly the impeachment inquiry escalated tensions in a West Wing already divided over the publication of the transcript, and it appears to be the latest example of administration officials rushing to protect themselves in the Ukraine scandal.\n\nSome officials have expressed fears that the review is intended to assign blame and highlight decisions that helped fuel the impeachment inquiry, the people said. Mr. Eisenberg reacted angrily to suggestions that he is under scrutiny, according to two people told of his response.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Us Politics White-House-Review-Ukraine.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
