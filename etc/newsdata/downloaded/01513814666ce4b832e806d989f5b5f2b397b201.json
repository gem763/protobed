Disney released photos and the final trailer on Monday. (Disney)\n\nThe movie is the last installment in the new trilogy, following The Last Jedi from 2017 and The Force Awakens in 2015.\n\nIt is the ninth and final movie in the entire saga.\n\nDisney describes the film as \u201cthe riveting conclusion of the seminal Skywalker saga, where new legends will be born and the final battle for freedom is yet to come.\u201d\n\nThe trailer is full of messaging about the end, like when C-3PO says, \u201cTaking one last look, sir, at my friends.\u201d\n\nExcitement around Star Wars isn\u2019t new.\n\nLet\u2019s not forget that the saga began more than 40 years ago, with the release of the original film, simply called Star Wars.\n\nIn this photo from June 1977, fans wait in lines in front of the Avco Center Theater in Los Angeles to see the original Star Wars movie. (AP Photo)\n\nBack then, you had to wait in long lines to get your tickets to movies.\n\nPerhaps the fact that the trailer for the new movie was released on election night in Canada isn\u2019t a coincidence, given that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who was just re-elected, is himself a long-time Star Wars fan.\n\nHe and his wife even dressed up as characters from the film a few years ago.\n\nJustin Trudeau dressed up as Hans Solo for Halloween in 2015, alongside his wife, Sophie Gregoire Trudeau, who dressed as Princess Leia. (Justin Tang/The Canadian Press)\n\nOr maybe the trailer\u2019s release has more to do with the fact that yesterday would have been the birthday of the original Princess Leia, Carrie Fisher.\n\nFisher died in 2016, but appears in the trailer, thanks to unused footage from The Force Awakens.\n\nAs far as what happens in the final installment of the series, it looks like a matchup between Rey and Emperor Palpatine, but it also leaves lots of questions.\n\n\u201cConfronting fear is the destiny of the Jedi,\u201d Luke Skywalker is heard saying in the trailer.\n\n\u201cYour destiny\u2026\u201d his voice trails off.\n\nWho\u2019s destiny? Rey\u2019s destiny?\n\nYou\u2019ll just have to wait to find out when the film is released on Dec. 20.", "description": "Star Wars fans are thrilled to see the final trailer in the epic saga, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, released on Oct. 21.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/kidsnews//content/_card_resize/StarWars_thumbnail.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
