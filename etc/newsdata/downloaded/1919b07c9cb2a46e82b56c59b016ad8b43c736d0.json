Since only a certain number are allowed daily, the rest make camp around the international bridge.\n\nTraffic resumed briefly at 3:45 a.m., but by 8.a.m. authorities were forced to close all lanes again due to renewed protest actions. Mexican authorities have asked them to disperse since they were disrupting regular traffic between the border cities.\n\nIldefonso Ortiz is an award-winning journalist with Breitbart Texas.
