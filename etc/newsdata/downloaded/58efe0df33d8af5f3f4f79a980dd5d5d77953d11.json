The library\u2019s safety was far from certain, though, during a morning when conditions conspired against hundreds of firefighters on the ground.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt was about the worst time it could happen,\u201d Ventura County Police Chief Mark Lorenzen told reporters at a noon briefing. \u201cAnd, unfortunately, these winds are going to continue for at least the next 24 hours.\u201d\n\nThe Easy Fire was the largest one that broke out Wednesday, but throughout the day, brush fires popped up along busy highways on the outskirts of Los Angeles, stoking fears that fires could start \u2014 and spread \u2014 quickly and with little warning to heavily populated areas along the California coast.\n\nThe wind was so fierce in Riverside County to the southeast, where the Hill Fire threatened mobile home parks and senior care hospitals, that it blew over several 18-wheel trucks navigating traffic-clogged roads. Eucalyptus bent almost parallel to some highways as debris was tossed through the air. Public officials in high-wind areas warned drivers to stay home.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe routine has become familiarly grim to thousands of Californians after weeks of wildfires from north of San Francisco to south of Los Angeles. Schools closed in many Los Angeles suburbs, and employees left work early to take care of children and check on homes as fires advanced and smoke streamed across the sky.\n\nThroughout the day, people checked the boundaries of mandatory evacuation maps on cellphones. Nearly 20 million state residents are living within high-risk fire areas, which have grown in size as the state\u2019s climate turns to one of extremes.\n\nFire crews were still trying to contain the Getty Fire, on the western edge of Los Angeles, which was sparked Monday when a tree branch fell on power lines in Los Angeles County. The northeast Santa Ana winds were far calmer in the city Wednesday than on its outskirts to the north and south.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo far, the Getty Fire has torched about 745 acres and forced the evacuation of more than 7,000 homes. At least 12 homes have been destroyed.\n\nIn the north, the Kincade Fire grew to 76,825 acres in Sonoma County, threatening some of the same Wine Country towns and cities that burned in the fall of 2017. It is the largest so far this year.\n\nAt least 206 buildings have been destroyed, 94 of them homes. Firefighters there received some relief from the weather as the predicted 70 mph winds, known as Diablos, did not whip up to that strength. The National Weather Service canceled its wind advisory for the North Bay Area before dawn.\n\nThe weather concerns over the next two days are focused on Southern California, where the National Weather Service took the unprecedented step of issuing an \u201cextreme red flag warning\u201d to communicate the severity of the event now underway.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs of 6 a.m., just before the Easy Fire broke out, peak wind gusts in Los Angeles and Ventura counties had reached 65 mph. Gusts increased through the early afternoon.\n\n\u201cThe fire outflanked us very quickly this morning,\u201d said Chad Cook, the incident commander with the Ventura County Fire Department.\n\nCook said the heavy winds and resulting turbulence shut down air operations off and on throughout the morning. But those pauses were brief. The sight of helicopters dropping water, collected from nearby reservoirs, and tankers dumping flame retardant, painting the tan hills fluorescent, was near constant.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been give and take, off and on,\u201d Cook said.\n\nAD\n\nOne of the key factors that forecasters use in predicting the strength of offshore wind events in California is the pressure gradient between coastal portions of the state and areas far inland. The greater the pressure difference, the stronger the winds will be. Forecasters and residents say the winds have been the strongest in more than a decade.\n\nAD\n\nThe evacuations related to the Easy Fire in Los Angeles affected an estimated 26,000 people. Overnight, the Ventura County Sheriff\u2019s Department had deployed 81 officers to areas at most risk of fire, giving them an early start on the evacuations that Sheriff Bill Ayub called \u201cfairly seamless.\u201d\n\nAt one point early Wednesday, the fire burned along ridgelines and in the canyons around the Reagan Library, the repository for the late president\u2019s papers, the aircraft that served as his Air Force One, and other historical materials. Ronald and Nancy Reagan are buried there.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe made some successful stands up there and managed to protect the buildings and the infrastructure around it,\u201d Cook said.\n\nOn its website, the library posted an advisory that it was closed for the day. The message added: \u201cThank you to all the first responders working so hard to protect our area.\u201d\n\nMettler and Freedman reported from Washington.
