Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nTom Bossert, the former White House official, took aim at Giuliani earlier on \"This Week,\" calling it a mistake for the president to have hired him in the first place. He also called out Giuliani for repeating a \u201ccompletely false\u201d theory that Ukraine \u2013 not Russia \u2013 was responsible for interference in the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cAt this point I am deeply frustrated with what [Giuliani] and the legal team is doing and repeating that debunked theory to the president,\u201d Bossert, who is now an ABC contributor, said. \u201cIt sticks in his mind when he hears it over and over again.\u201d\n\nGiuliani fired back later in the show, telling Stephanopoulos, \u201cTom Bossert doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about \u2026 I\u2019m not peddling anything.\u201d\n\nSOPHIA KEMBOWSKI/EPA-EFE/REX\n\nThe president\u2019s personal attorney also sought to defend his role in pressing Ukrainians to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, the fallout from which has led to an impeachment inquiry in Congress.\n\n\u201cEverything I did was to defend my client and I am proud of having uncovered what will turn out to be a massive pay-for-play scheme,\u201d Giuliani told Stephanopoulos.\n\nThe \"pay-for-play scheme\" Giuliani has accused Biden of perpetrating in Ukraine dates back to 2016 and the dismissal of the country\u2019s former prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin. At the time, Biden was leading U.S. policy toward Ukraine with an emphasis on cracking down on corruption.\n\nHe called for Shokin to be fired.\n\nAt one point, Giuliani waved what he said were several affidavits, including one by Shokin defending himself, which he said verified his claims that Shokin was dismissed as a result of his investigation of Burisma and Hunter Biden.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how the documents verified those claims.\n\nTrump and Giuliani have accused Biden of calling for Shokin's dismissal because his office was investigating Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company where Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, had a seat on the board of directors.\n\n\"This is not about getting Joe Biden in trouble,\" Giuliani said. \"This is about proving that Donald Trump was framed by the Democrats.\"\n\nSaul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBut the assertion that Biden acted to help his son has been undercut by widespread criticism of Shokin from several high-profile international leaders, including members of the European Union and International Monetary Fund, who said Biden's recommendation was well justified.\n\nThe IMF threatened to withhold aid to Kiev in early 2016, citing \u201cUkraine\u2019s slow progress in improving governance and fighting corruption,\u201d according to Christine Lagard, the IMF\u2019s managing director.\n\nGiuliani also sought to undermine a whistleblower complaint, which was filed in August and released publicly last week, that describes the nature of the president's phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and an apparent effort within the White House to \u201clock down\u201d records of the conversation.\n\n\u201cThe whistleblower says, \u2018I don\u2019t have any direct knowledge, I just heard things,\u2019\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying [the whistleblower] was false, I\u2019m saying he could have heard it wrong.\u201d\n\nStephanopoulos cited several examples from the complaint in which the whistleblower accurately described the content of Trump\u2019s conversation with Zelenskiy as compared to the transcript.\n\nThe whistleblower, who has not been identified, claimed that at least a half dozen administration officials had raised concerns that Trump had used \u201cthe power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.\u201d\n\nSiavosh Hosseini/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nDemocrats have accused the president of using his desire for an investigation into the Bidens as leverage with Zelenskiy, particularly in light of the fact that the White House had, at the time, withheld nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine.\n\nIt was later released.\n\nGiuliani\u2019s name is invoked more than 30 times in the whistleblower\u2019s complaint.\n\nWhen Stephanopoulos asked Giuliani whether he will cooperate with the House Intelligence Committee, for which Rep. Adam Schiff is the chair, Giuliani said he wouldn't cooperate with Schiff. But when pressed said he would \u201cconsider it\u201d if his client, the president, signed off.\n\n\"I'm a lawyer. It's his privilege, not mine,\" he responded. \"If he decides that he wants me to testify, of course I'll testify, even though I think Adam Schiff is an illegitimate chairman. He has already prejudged the case.\"\n\nIn his interview on \u201cThis Week,\u201d Giuliani sought to clarify the timeline of his conversations with Ukrainians and insisted he did not instigate communications.\n\n\u201cNovember of 2016, they first came to me,\u201d Giuliani said of the alleged outreach from Ukrainians through the State Department. \u201cThe Ukrainians came to me. I didn't go to them.\u201d\n\nThe State Department and its chief, Mike Pompeo, have faced scrutiny for their handling of Giuliani\u2019s overtures to the Ukrainians. The former U.S. Special Envoy for Ukraine, Kurt Volker, helped coordinate at least one interaction Giuliani had with an aide to Zelenskiy in Madrid in May, Volker confirmed.\n\nGiuliani has claimed the State Department directed him to act and has said he briefed Volker and the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, after his meetings with Ukrainians.\n\nOn Friday, ABC News reported that Volker had resigned from his post with the State Department. House Democrats still plan to interview him next week as part of their impeachment inquiry, according to a congressional aide.\n\nGiuliani planned to speak at a conference in Armenia next week, according to a schedule. But he cancelled after news outlets reported that several Kremlin officials and Russian President Vladimir Putin would also be in attendance.", "description": "President Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, was named more than 30 times in the whistleblower's complaint, which triggered an impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/giuliani-01-as-epa-190928_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
