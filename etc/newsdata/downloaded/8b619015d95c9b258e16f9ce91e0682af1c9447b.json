Marr has also found that high-flying people tend to perform worse themselves if they\u2019ve recently lost status in the eyes of their peers. The \u201chot hand\u201d phenomenon, in which a player who does well will keep doing well, is still debated in psychology, but Marr speculates that performing well can have effects on your own motivation, too.\n\nAll this research serves to underscore that status isn\u2019t, well, static. People improve and get worse all the time in whatever environments they\u2019re in, and those trajectories themselves have an impact on others. Someone isn\u2019t simply \u201crespected and admired in a group and it just stays that way forever,\u201d Marr says. Instead, \u201cI might make mistakes. New people come to the group. The way I behave influences the status that I have in the eyes of others \u2026 Those changes in status have very real consequences.\u201d\n\nThankfully, not all is lost if you\u2019re surrounded by a bunch of up-and-coming stars at work. In their new paper, Kakkar and his coauthors also examined the best way to deal with the threat of a rival\u2019s momentum. When they told participants in one study that a clerical error might have caused an opponent\u2019s momentum measurements to be wrong, the participants felt less threatened and lowered their expectations for that opponent\u2019s future rank. In another study, participants who wrote about their own strengths also felt less threatened. In essence, the ways to avoid being psyched-out by another person\u2019s momentum are to tell yourself that you\u2019re good, too, or to tell yourself that the other person is actually not that great.\n\nThat might be especially good advice if you, like me, are highly competitive, but nevertheless a little bit insecure. (There\u2019s a name for people like us: \u201cinsecure overachievers.\u201d We\u2019d display our trophies, but they\u2019re really not much to look at.) I, for one, would much rather take on the same topic as a journalist who has been widely but evenly renowned for years, rather than one who has only recently become the darling of Twitter. I don\u2019t like the idea that there are some people who will always be moving one step ahead of me, that I can never catch up. Whenever I\u2019m at a gathering with a writer who seems to have rapidly become a star, I want to slither under the table and coil into a ball, and just stay there, softly murmuring \u201csorry,\u201d until everyone forgets I\u2019m there.\n\nWhenever I complain to my mentor, a veteran journalist, that a rival of mine got something\u2014like an assignment or grant\u2014that I desperately wanted, he\u2019ll say something like, \u201cit\u2019s nothing; keep going.\u201d (Or as Marr put it, in somewhat of an easier-said-than-done way, \u201cfocus on doing the best that you can in a particular situation and try to worry less about the experiences other people have had in the past.\u201d)\n\nOther peoples\u2019 momentum isn\u2019t nothing.
