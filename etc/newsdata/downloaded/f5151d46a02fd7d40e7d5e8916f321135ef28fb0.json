Those public places could include schools, stores, restaurants, sports arenas, parking lots, stadiums or parks, for instance.\n\nThe data showed that between 2015 and 2018, about half of students reported secondhand smoke exposure, but that prevalence has been following a downward trend.\n\nSecondhand smoke exposure impacted 52.6% of students in 2015 compared with 48.7% last year, according to the data.\n\nMeanwhile, the data showed that the prevalence of secondhand vapor has increased from exposure impacting 25.2% of students in 2015 to 33.2% last year.\n\nThe data that came from last year showed that young women, white individuals, those with a history of e-cigarette or tobacco use, and those living with someone who used e-cigarettes were more likely to be exposed to secondhand smoke and secondhand vapor.\n\nThe researchers noted that although about \"16 states and more than 800 municipalities have introduced laws to restrict e-cigarette use in 100% smoke-free or other venues, including schools, over the past few years ,\" an increasing proportion of youth in the United States have reported exposure to secondhand vapor in public places.\n\n\"This may be owing to the increase in youth using pod-based e-cigarettes and other devices, fewer vape-free policies than smoke-free policies, and fewer people who are willing to speak up against others vaping in public places,\" the researchers wrote.\n\nIn general, it's estimated that nearly 1 in 5 high school students and 1 in 20 middle school students use e-cigarettes, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . The number of middle and high school students using e-cigarettes rose from 2.1 million in 2017 to 3.6 million last year -- a difference of about 1.5 million young people.\n\nJUST WATCHED What tobacco does to your health Replay More Videos ...

I wish we did,\" he said.", "description": "More middle school and high school students in the United States are being exposed to secondhand vapor from e-cigarettes in public places, new research finds.", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180406160438-high-schools-vaping-epidemic-super-tease.jpg"}
