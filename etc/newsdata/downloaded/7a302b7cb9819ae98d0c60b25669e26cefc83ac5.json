The number would be a fraction of the 110,000-refugee target the Obama administration tried to set for FY 2017.\n\nThe administration must consult with Congress on the total number of refugees to be permitted for the next fiscal year, and Congress could look for a higher number.\n\n\u201cThe administration\u2019s proposed refugee admissions ceiling takes into account the ongoing security and humanitarian crisis on our southern border and the massive asylum backlog, which now includes nearly 1 million individuals,\u201d A State Department spokesperson explained.\n\nEX-ICE DIRECTOR CLASHES WITH DEM AT HEARING ON DETENTION FACILITIES: 'YOU WORK FOR ME!'\n\n\u201cThe United States anticipates receiving more than 368,000 new refugees and asylum claims in FY 2020. Of them, 18,000 would be refugees we propose to resettle under the new refugee ceiling; we also anticipate processing more than 350,000 individuals in new asylum cases,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nHUGE 'WELL-FED' SNAKE CAUGHT IN AUSTRALIA, DUBBED 'CHONK'\n\nWhile only 18,000 would be granted refugee status, another 350,000 from the backlog of 1 million would have asylum claims processed. Asylum is granted to migrants already inside the U.S., while refugees are requesting protection from outside the country. In an effort to reduce asylum claims, the White House banned asylum in the U.S. for anyone who had traveled through a third country and wasn't denied asylum there. If a migrant from Honduras travels through Mexico to get to the U.S., he or she must first apply and be denied asylum in Mexico before the case will be heard by the U.S.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe State Department statement made sure to note that refugee and asylum claims are in addition to more than $8 billion the U.S. provided in overseas humanitarian assistance in FY 2018, \u201cmore than any other country.\u201d \u201cOur assistance reaches tens of millions of displaced and crisis-affected people worldwide, including those who will never be eligible or considered for third-country resettlement.\u201d\n\nRich Edson contributed to this report.", "description": "The Trump administration Thursday recommended cutting the number of refugees admitted to the United States to 18,000-- the lowest number since the resettlement program began in 1980.", "authors": ["Morgan Phillips"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/04/ContentBroker_contentid-8d2e93f3881a43658e808b0718d013f4.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
