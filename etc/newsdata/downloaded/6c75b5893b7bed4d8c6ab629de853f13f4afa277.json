Out of those, the SafeSport Center has 1,290 open cases, with another 2,237 that have been closed. It has 18 investigators and lawyers (with four vacancies) on a staff of 37 (with six vacancies) to handle them. The center projects it will need to double its staff next year and triple it by 2023 to keep up with the work.\n\nThe stark numbers lend urgency to a fight over who should fund the center in the long term. The USOPC, which founded the center, is pushing the federal government to provide more than what it currently allots a $2.2m grant spread over three years, none of which can be used for investigations.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s an \u2018And\u2019 question, not an \u2018Or\u2019 question,\u201d said USOCP CEO Sarah Hirshland, who has been lobbying lawmakers to provide government money to help.\n\nA pair of senators, meanwhile, have proposed a bill that, in addition to adding oversight to the Olympic movement, would compel the USOPC and NGBs to essentially double what they provide now, increasing the grants to a total of $20m a year.\n\nNearly half of the 50 NGBs operate on annual budgets of $3m or less, and though each NGB pays according to its size and, in extreme cases, the number of reports its sport has referred to the center, there is concern that neither the NGBs nor the USOPC can absorb big increases in their SafeSport budgets.\n\n\u201cThe $20m proposal would absolutely force us to make some difficult choices,\u201d Hirshland said.\n\nIs the US finally taking sexual abuse in sports seriously? Read more\n\nThe USOPC brought in around $323m in revenue in 2018 up from $183m in \u201817; the federation\u2019s numbers spike in Olympic years and go down during non-Olympic years. It uses the money to support athletes in a number of ways including training, insurance, prize money for winners of major events and NGB funding. Last year, administrative costs rose to more than 11% of total spending ($31.2m) because of payments to two law firms that did work involving the sex-abuse scandal and a severance to former CEO Scott Blackmun.\n\nHirshland and other leaders are pointing to the model that funds the US Anti-Doping Agency; USADA received about $9.5m of its $21m in 2018 revenue from government, another $5.1m from the USOPC and $6.7m from \u201ctesting and other services\u201d, according to its annual report.\n\n\u201cI think that makes sense, because we\u2019re addressing societal issue, and government\u2019s authority to protect and serve fits in really well in that area,\u201d said Max Cobb, the CEO of US Biathlon, who heads up the NGB Council.\n\nBut the red tape the center had to go through to receive the $2.2m, combined with the restrictions put on the money and uncertainty over the Congressional appropriations process, gives pause to the new center\u2019s CEO, Ju\u2019Riese Colon, about relying too heavily on government funding.\n\n\u201cThe USOPC and the NGBs must be invested in changing their sport culture, which means they must invest in the Center,\u201d Colon said, while adding that she\u2019s not against receiving money from the government, as well. \u201cWhile I appreciate people connecting us (to USADA) because we\u2019re certainly similar, the job and scope is so different, and I think the funding is going to have to be a lot different.\u201d\n\nWhen he, along with Republican senator Jerry Moran, introduced the bill that calls for $20m, Democratic senator Richard Blumenthal, called it a more direct and dependable pathway for the center to receive the money than relying on government.\n\n\u201cHaving a secure and stable source of funding is very important. It fortifies the independence and integrity\u201d of the center, Blumenthal said.\n\nRecently, the House passed a spending bill that included $2.5m for the SafeSport Center. The US senate is expected to consider that bill next week.\n\nEven if that money gets approved, the center will need more to keep up with its caseload.\n\nAround the time it opened in March 2017, the center received an average of 31 reports a month. That number exploded in the beginning of 2018, when Larry Nassar\u2019s victims spoke up during his sentencing hearing for sex crimes. By last fall, with the MeToo movement in full swing and Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s Supreme Court confirmation hearing making headlines, the number spiked again.\n\nIt\u2019s grown even more in 2019, with each sex-related headline triggering more calls.\n\nMeanwhile, an independent consultant hired by the center projects the number of calls will continue to increase until it caps at around 8,000 a year an average of 667 a month.\n\nColon says many of the reports could become less complicated as the knowledge from center\u2019s education programs seeps into sports communities and issues are reported before they become overly complicated. About one-fifth of the center\u2019s workforce (eight employees) is devoted to education-and-outreach programs to serve up to 18m members of national governing bodies across the country. So far, the center has trained about 800,000 of those people.\n\nThe independent consultant suggested to Colon that, given the workload, the center could use $35m in 2020. But the center has more modest hopes hoping to increase USOPC and NGB donations to bring next year\u2019s budget to $16m.", "description": "The US Center for SafeSport is fielding 55% more reports of sex abuse and other misconduct in 2019 than it did last year", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa3b59a4ea3fd4b0199335e04fa22472517fd787/0_0_2667_1600/master/2667.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=831543cb08d8284047e9b725ef7721e9", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
