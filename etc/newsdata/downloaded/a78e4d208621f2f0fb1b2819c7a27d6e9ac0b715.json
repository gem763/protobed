And then, in the wake of all of this, suddenly we're back to closed-door hearings on Capitol Hill, leaks -- leaked information.\u201d\n\nDIPLOMAT BILL TAYLOR TESTIFIES TRUMP USED UKRAINE AID, WHITE HOUSE MEETING AS LEVERAGE FOR PROBES\n\nHost Laura Ingraham interjected, asking the vice president what he will do to support the president \u201cin this effort\u201d.\n\nPence replied: \u201cWell, we're just going to -- we're going to be out there telling the truth about this president's record, and we're going to be telling the truth about this partisan impeachment.\n\n\u201cThere's no historical basis for what the Democrats in Congress are doing.\u201d\n\nThe comments came the same day that acting U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor testified unequivocally that Trump pushed Ukraine to investigate both election interference and a company linked to former Vice President Joe Biden's son -- and was willing to hold up military aid and a White House meeting to get a public announcement from the country that the probes were underway.\n\nIn his opening remarks to House lawmakers obtained by Fox News, Taylor voiced his apparent frustration that the Trump administration was undercutting his personal policy preference for providing robust aid to Ukraine.\n\nAmong Taylor's colorful claims were that then-national security adviser John Bolton furiously warned that a Trump phone call with Ukraine's leader would be a \"disaster,\" and that Taylor nearly didn't take the job leading Ukraine's embassy out of concerns the U.S. wouldn't be sufficiently helpful to Ukraine.\n\nRepublicans, however, have countered that military aid to Ukraine was released in September, and that there has been no evidence Ukrainians were aware that the aid was being withheld as part of any implicit quid pro quo. Ukrainian officials have denied that there was any undue pressure from the White House.\n\nREAD TAYLOR'S FULL OPENING STATEMENT\n\nBut, Taylor went on to describe the existence of an \"irregular\" communications channel with Ukraine led by Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, and a \"weird combination of encouraging, confusing, and ultimately alarming circumstances\" once he arrived in Kiev. The statement confirmed previous reporting of Taylor's remarks by Fox News.\n\nTaylor had served as U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine from 2006 to 2009, but because he was not yet reconfirmed by the Senate, his official title was to be Charg\u00e9 d 'Affaires ad interim.\n\nA former Army officer, Taylor had been serving as executive vice president at the U.S. Institute of Peace \u2014 which has described itself as a nonpartisan think tank founded by Congress \u2014 when he was appointed to run the embassy.\n\nThe White House, meanwhile, fired back Tuesday over Taylor's testimony: \"President Trump has done nothing wrong \u2014 this is a coordinated smear campaign from far-left lawmakers and radical unelected bureaucrats waging war on the Constitution. There was no quid pro quo,\" White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said.\n\nWHAT DID RICK PERRY, ENERGY SECRETARY, HAVE TO DO WITH UKRAINE?\n\nOnly Taylor's opening statement has been released at this point. However, lawmakers emerging after hours of the private deposition said Taylor relayed a \"disturbing\" account, including establishing a \"direct line\" to the quid pro quo at the center of Democrats' impeachment inquiry.\n\nFox News\u2019 Gregg Re contributed to this report.", "description": "Vice President Mike Pence said there is \u201cno historical basis\u201d for the Democrats\u2019 continued impeachment push -- and promised to fight back with the truth about President Trump\u2019s record.", "authors": ["Liam Quinn", "Liam Quinn Is A Senior Editor At Fox News.
