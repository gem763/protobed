Mandatory Credit: Kelvin Kuo-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe blowout win gave the Galaxy\u2019s playoff hopes a boost and effectively put an end to any postseason aspirations for SKC.\n\nThe Galaxy, which trailed 1-0 before exploding for seven unanswered goals, shot upward from eighth place in Major League Soccer\u2019s Western Conference to fifth at the end of a weekend that saw the three teams in front of the Galaxy lose their respective matches.\n\nLos Angeles (14-13-3) put an end to a four-match winless streak. They also might have stopped Sporting KC\u2019s streak of eight straight seasons in the MLS playoffs.\n\nSKC (10-13-7) is six points out of a playoff spot \u2014 the top seven in the East and West get in \u2014 with only four games left to play in the regular season.\n\nThe Galaxy drew even after a handball in the box in the 30th minute. Ibrahimovic\u2019s penalty kick was initially saved by Sporting KC goalkeeper Tim Melia, but Ibrahimovic was the first one to the rebound, and he put it in to tie the score at 1.\n\nBoth teams had plenty of chances to break the tie until Joe Corona\u2019s header in the 48th minute. It was Corona\u2019s first goal of the season.\n\nIbrahimovic left-footed a shot from close range past Melia for a 3-1 lead in the 51st minute, and Uriel Antuna tallied in the 69th minute, his fourth of the season.\n\nRolf Feltscher had two assists for the Galaxy after Felipe Gutierrez opened the scoring with Sporting Kansas City\u2019s first goal of the match, in the 24th minute. Gutierrez added his second in the 86th minute.\n\nIbrahimovic took over the record for most goals in a single season by a Galaxy player with 26. That\u2019s more than half of his team\u2019s 49 total goals.\n\nLletget scored his two goals two minutes apart, with the Galaxy ahead 4-1 and well in control. He has three on the season.\n\nGutierrez scored the game\u2019s final goal, but Ibrahimovic capped off the night in the 85th minute for Galaxy fans with a long strike from the wing just inside the box, then held aloft three fingers and stood on a sign board with his arms raised to the crowd.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Star forward Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored three goals and Sebastian Lletget added two, leading the LA Galaxy to a 7-2 win over visiting Sporting Kansas City Sunday night.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430325525&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F071-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
