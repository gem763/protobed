She said she bought into society\u2019s deafening message that being with a man \u2013 any man \u2013 is better than being alone, and certainly better than dying alone, which is allegedly the worst fate anyone, especially any woman, can suffer.\n\nWhen I told her that I\u2019ve never feared dying alone, and in fact have sometimes feared the opposite, she told me I was incredibly lucky. Because this meant I wouldn\u2019t end up settling for a life that doesn\u2019t actually make me happy, even if society tells me it\u2019s supposed to.\n\nApparently I\u2019m not alone. (Pun intended!) Data confirms that more women have begun to realize that there are far worse things than dying alone, which is great news for women but bad news for the patriarchy.\n\n\u201cBroke men are hurting women\u2019s marriage prospects,\u201d the NY Post recently declared, citing a study from the Journal of Family and Marriage. The article claimed that \u201cmost American women hope to marry\u201d but there is a shortage of men with stable incomes and lives, making it tough for women to do so.\n\nCNN reports that there \u201care more single working women than ever,\u201d and by 2030, according to the CDC, \u201c45% of working women ages 25 to 44 in the United States will be single\u201d. This inspired this spirited Twitter exchange:\n\nErin a favor though Ryan (@morninggloria) counterpoints:\n\n1- it's a million times better to be single than have a husband who is trash\n\n2- imagine being a man who thinks that women die of sadness without them lmfao\n\n3- being a single woman between 25-44 in the United States is-- & I'm speaking from experience-- fun as hell pic.twitter.com/lx6QSq0kh7\n\nThat Twitter clash perfectly captures a growing cultural divide. There are those who still believe that traditional marriage is the natural order of things \u2013 and that those not participating in this institution are failing society, and must be desperately unhappy and lonely.\n\nThen there are the rest of us, who believe that traditional marriage is great for some, but not for everybody, and we certainly don\u2019t feel like lonely failures for choosing to opt-out. (And yes, for many of us it is an active choice, not just an economic outcome.)\n\nContrary to decades of prevailing wisdom that those who marry are better off, a 2017 study published in the Journal of Women\u2019s Health found that women who stay single or who divorce are actually healthier than those who stay married. By contrast, married men are healthier than men who are not. Why the discrepancy?\n\nFor starters, men are less likely to go to the doctor than women, unless of course women \u2013 ie wives \u2013 nudge them. Women are also traditionally better at maintaining social networks than men. When a man divorces, he may see his physical and emotional health slide. He loses the person concerned with keeping him healthy and much of his social network. By contrast, women who divorce just see their relationships evolve from investing in a man to investing more heavily in other social or community connections.\n\nMarriage, unless to an exceptional man, is often a 'bad bargain' for women\n\nFor years, the feminist writer Linda Hirshman courted controversy by advising that marriage, unless to an exceptional man, is often a \u201cbad bargain\u201d for women. With every child a woman has, she sees her pay and long-term professional opportunities decline, particularly if she leaves the workforce for a significant period of time.\n\nFurthermore, marriage has historically presented women with two options, neither good: marry a man and sacrifice your autonomy and career goals to become financially dependent on him. Or marry a man and maintain your own career but be prepared to have a \u201csecond shift\u201d career taking care of him and the home. Even among more open-minded millennial men, the female spouse still ends up doing the majority of caregiving and housekeeping.\n\nMore women, however, are foregoing marriage and motherhood. In doing so, they trade in their \u201csecond shift\u201d and instead begin taking care of themselves. To use Hirshman\u2019s language, they are rejecting a \u201cbad bargain\u201d. This new status quo frustrates men who feel entitled to female companionship, such as angry male \u201cincels\u201d.\n\nWhile trying to explain the danger of incels (\u201cinvoluntary celibates\u201d) to my mother, I was surprised to hear her say, \u201cWell, they\u2019re not entirely wrong.\u201d Realizing my horror, she went on to explain that women used to need a man to survive. That led to a lot of bad marriages and deterred divorces. She loves that, thanks to modern feminism, she gets to see women like me make decisions that are not predicated on needing a man to keep a roof over my head. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to settle,\u201d she said.\n\nWomen have more economic power and freedom to set standards regarding the men they will be with, and what they will put up with from those men, than at any time in history. More women are deciding that being in a bad marriage, or trying to co-parent with an irresponsible man, is much worse than dying alone.\n\nOnce dying alone is no longer scary to women, men lose power. So it shouldn\u2019t be surprising that some incels are outraged. It\u2019s no different than those who mourn the days when they didn\u2019t have to compete for jobs against women and racial minorities. It must be frustrating to lose power you once had but didn\u2019t necessarily deserve.\n\nWhich is why I owe a big thank you to my mom. Despite being married for nearly 50 years, she\u2019s never pressured me to get married (even when she\u2019s been a fan of the man I\u2019m dating). But the main reason I owe her thanks is because she\u2019s never minded going to dinner by herself. Until I grew older I didn\u2019t realize such a small act was actually strangely politically subversive. Countless adults are terrified of simply going to the movies by themselves. I increasingly think Chris Rock was right when, years ago, he joked that a lot of people marry just to have someone to go to dinner and the movies with. Funny, but sadly, probably true.\n\nIt made me wonder how many people have endured unhappy relationships just so they wouldn\u2019t be perceived as lonely. For so long, society has perpetuated the stigma that you need someone by your side to be seen as whole.\n\nBut more women are dismantling this stigma and eschewing the \u201cbad bargain\u201d. They are finally deciding that being alone isn\u2019t the same as being lonely. They\u2019ve realized that they can channel the energy that for so long went into uplifting men into instead lifting themselves. That means more women staying in the workplace, more women running for office and more women grabbing their rightful seats at tables of power.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say women shouldn\u2019t marry and have children. It is to say women should feel empowered to do so, only if they truly want to and with partners who are worthy of them, who champion and nurture their success, not hold them back or drag them down. More women are embracing that message, and that could ultimately do more for women\u2019s equality than any government policy ever will.", "description": "Data confirms more women have realized there are far worse things than dying alone, which is bad news for the patriarchy", "authors": ["Keli Goff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38b071c3525f964c2b743510ab45a5274d054b61/0_307_5191_3114/master/5191.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=889423a489b67525de8363cf25d10d09", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
