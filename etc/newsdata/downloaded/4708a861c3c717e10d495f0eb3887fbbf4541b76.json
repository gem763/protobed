Those were high times, man. It seems strange now but this time last year one of the key issues in the Premier League\u2019s endless conversation with itself, and a source of febrile ambient rage well beyond the Chelsea fanbase, was the apparent misuse of Kant\u00e9 by overseas book-learning type Maurizio Sarri.\n\nFrank Lampard criticises France over handling of injured N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 Read more\n\nThe spark in this tinderbox was the decision to play Jorginho as the deeper of Chelsea\u2019s midfield pairing. As part of this shift Kant\u00e9 was moved a few yards from his previous starting position. He was encouraged to make a number of additional forward runs. Cue: outrage.\n\nIt was a strangely protective fury. On radio shows, in newspaper columns, on the swirling brain-thoughts of social media, the angry talking heads leapt up. There was a sense of gallantry, defending Kant\u00e9\u2019s honour, like pipe\u2011smoking 1950s fathers shooing a motorbike gang from the front porch while their teenage daughter cowers at the screen door. Nobody puts N\u2019Golo in the corner!\n\nAnd yet the strangest thing about the Kant\u00e9 uprising was: it wasn\u2019t really a thing. Sarri went on to all but destroy Chelsea by finishing third, winning a European trophy, giving Callum Hudson-Odoi 26 games and behaving with discrete good grace while being yelled at by Spam-faced men with weirdly overwrought opinions on the precise calibration of the two-man midfield pivot.\n\nKant\u00e9 and Jorginho, intelligent footballers, made it work well enough. Fast forward a year and Chelsea\u2019s two best wins of the season, away at Lille and Southampton, have coincided with their resumption of a two-man midfield. The news that Kant\u00e9 will probably miss Saturday\u2019s game against Newcastle after twanging his hamstring with France looks the biggest obstacle to a resumption of their recent surge.\n\nPlus, there has been some other news this week. Real Madrid and Juventus have let it be known, through the usual channels, that they may just be coming for Kant\u00e9. Not that anyone really believes these stories, product of what the authors of The Club, a brilliantly detailed anatomy of Premier League shenanigans, describe as \u201cthe gossip-industrial complex\u201d.\n\nThere are obvious holes in the Kant\u00e9 to Madrid yarn. First Chelsea aren\u2019t selling anyone and secondly the article on the DesMarque website states that Kant\u00e9 \u201cdreams of wearing white and leaving Chelsea. He believes they do not aspire to winning important titles with Frank Lampard\u201d.\n\nYeah, right. Does this sound like the N\u2019Golo that you know? What were his exact words? He didn\u2019t like the deal \u2013 but he has to go along with it?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 is key to Chelsea\u2019s success. Photograph: Mark Greenwood/IPS/REX/Shutterstock\n\nIt is at least no surprise to hear that Kant\u00e9 should be in demand. He has been lionised in England, adopted as a Premier League force of nature. Albeit there has always been something showy about some of the excitement, a sense of overcompensation.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nThe covering midfielder, the anchor, is not a position English football has historically prized. In Kant\u00e9 we got it, a defensive shield of such energy, with such a flatteringly concussive Premier League style that it became a badge of sophistication to praise him and a possible source of that backlash when a gangly foreign manager who looks as though he\u2019s stepped out to the all-night garage in search of a tin of slim panatellas tried to change him, to bring other layers out of a champion footballer.\n\nIt is fair to ask why bother. Kant\u00e9 is seriously good at this. He made the most tackles in Europe\u2019s top leagues two seasons in a row. Last season, in a team that had the ball most of the time, he still blocked more passes per game than any other regular Premier League midfielder.\n\nThis is his superpower, the ability to take an advanced eye for space and movement, the famous picture a creative player has in their head, and to use that three-second glimpse forward into the revolving angles, the shifting pieces not to create, but to destroy and staunch and intercept.\n\nStill, Kant\u00e9 has been doing other things. As long ago as last year\u2019s Champions League defeat by Barcelona at the Camp Nou he produced a brilliantly complete all\u2011round midfield display against Ivan Rakitic, Sergio Busquets and Andr\u00e9s Iniesta.\n\nHe has played three league games this year but nobody has scored so many goals while also making so many tackles in that time. The pet destroyer is the best all-round midfielder in the Premier League.\n\nAnd why not? The image of Kant\u00e9 has always been circumscribed. The story about him working as a rubbish picker in the Paris suburbs as a child feeds into this notion of some humble, saintly automaton. But Kant\u00e9 is also a qualified accountant. When he refused to take his Chelsea wages through a shell company perhaps it wasn\u2019t because he\u2019s a holy soul looking beyond the material plane, but because he understands financial regulation and accounting practices better than most.\n\nPremier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend Read more\n\nSimilarly, the idea of Kant\u00e9 as a servant to the stars seems restrictive. We hear that he \u201clet Paul Pogba play\u201d at the World Cup, that his yeoman presence liberates others. Maybe what\u2019s happening here is that they\u2019re watching Kant\u00e9 play, a footballer who, in four years, has won four major club trophies and a World Cup medal for three teams, each one transformed by his presence.\n\nProbably we should try to enjoy him while we can, starting with Ajax on Tuesday; our own preciously guarded midfield shield, who \u2013 whisper it quietly \u2013 has become a little more than simply that.", "description": "It is no surprise that Real Madrid and Juventus are said to be coming for Chelsea\u2019s Kant\u00e9 \u2013 the Frenchman has conquered all before him over the last four years", "authors": ["Barney Ronay"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef8c0dae2f5178459c96b38b6c78eb29c0870551/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=bdbe82caa8e658a4e567c145385001d3", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
