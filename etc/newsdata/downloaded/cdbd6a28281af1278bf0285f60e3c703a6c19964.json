If the voting broke 11 to 9 in favour of going ahead, would it be sensible to do so? Would it not make better sense to keep things as they are unless and until support for a change grows? It is because of the problem of how to react to a close vote that many organisations would require a two-thirds (66.7 per cent) majority, or a split of at least 14 to 6 in the case of 20 members, before embarking on major change. In the case of a company, the law requires major decisions such as changing the constitution to be made by the shareholders, and at least 75 per cent of the votes cast are needed to adopt the proposal. With such super-majorities it can be certain that the change has solid support.\n\nThe 2016 EU referendum produced a majority for Leave of 52 to 48 per cent which is a closer result than for 11 to 9 (55 to 45 per cent). Why do we then hear endlessly that it is the will of the people that we leave the EU and that the result was decisive and must be honoured? If it was truly \u201cThe Will of the People (TWOTP)\u201d then parliament would be expected to honour the result. It is a mistake, however, to regard TWOTP as identical to the choice attracting the most votes. What if one side gained 50 per cent of the vote plus one other person! It is frankly absurd to claim TWOTP, when over 16 million people \u2013 nearly half the total vote \u2013 do not share that opinion. Maybe a two-thirds majority is too high a bar but at least 60/40 should be required before talking in such terms. It is, of course, true that the election of an MP or debate in parliament can be decided by a single vote, but that is not appropriate when considering major constitutional change.\n\nSo having unnecessarily wasted 3 years of political life we need urgently to take stock of the management of any future referendums. It would clearly be difficult to move goal posts in second EU or Scotland referendums, but it should be made clear that any result would be subject to approval by parliament. An independence referendum brings its own issues and debate in the country is urgently needed. Is it right that the decision is made solely by people living in Scotland, ignoring the opinion of everyone else? Surely, after 300 years, Great Britain belongs to all living in the UK.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nFor later referendums we must have ground rules in place. These should include a threshold for numbers voting and the requirement for a super-majority. Notwithstanding such guidelines, the final decision will always rest with parliament.\n\nMyer Salaman\n\nLondon W5\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

They thereby obtain the support of the large numbers of voters who are ill-placed to understand the wider context, complexity, economic, social and international consequences of what they are being told. The finer points of how parliament, government, the monarchy and representative democracy coexist are often ignored and even abused.\n\nI thus write to suggest that the same forensic interviews that our best journalists apply to our MPs might also be applied to those who are \u201cvox popped\u201d \u2013 picked at random on the street \u2013 to say what they think and who they support. While appreciating that this would not be an easy process to invoke, I do suggest that the weaknesses in the reasons and decisions made by those who are asked questions during the vox pop should be examined more closely and in many cases be shown to be flawed for practical reasons.\n\nJust one example; the notion that one should support Brexit and Boris Johnson because we are \u201cfed up with delays in implementing the will of the people\u201d totally neglects the fact that leaving the EU without breaking the Good Friday Agreement is impractical at present. Also, 37 per cent of eligible voters \u2013 which is how many voted Leave \u2013 can\u2019t be equated with the \u201cwill of the people\u201d. Since \u201cthe people\u201d are important. their views should be dissected forensically.\n\nDr David Rhodes\n\nWollaton\n\nSurely our chancellor understands the potential impact of no deal?\n\nMr Javid has said he is not sure how much a no deal would cost the economy in the short term. He said: \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone really knows a full, proper answer to that question\u201d. But way back in the mists of time, in the era of \u201cthe easiest of deals\u201d, and when we were told \u201cno deal is better than a bad deal\u201d, when every single Leaver in the country knew exactly what they had voted for, did Mr Javid then have some small idea \u2013 even the slightest inkling \u2013 of what a no deal would cost the economy in the short term?\n\nHe \u2013 now the chancellor and with access to all sorts of information - should be able to give a full and proper answer, despite it most certainly being very bad news. On the other hand, if no one \u201c...really knows a full, proper answer to that question\u201d, what exactly is the argument for leaving that Mr Javid thinks is worth campaigning for \u2013 other than his petty career?\n\nBeryl Wall\n\nLondon W4\n\nThe Tories are clearly not the party of law and order\n\nI see the Conservative party \u2013 after a few absent years \u2013 have returned to the promises of incarcerating our most heinous criminals for longer in an attempt to garner support. Anyone would think an election is looming.\n\nI wonder, do the good people of this country suffer from such a short memory that they cannot recall why we are suffering a law & order crisis? Privatised prisons, entire legal system including courts starved of funds; the unprecedented reduction in police numbers by a Tory home secretary \u2013 yes, I think her name was Theresa May, not sure where she is now; and then was it not, Chris Grayling, who single-handedly destroyed the probation service!\n\nExcuse me if I do not take all these \u201cget-tough-on-crime\u201d promises seriously.\n\nRobert Boston\n\nKingshill\n\nBelieve Boris?\n\nHasn\u2019t it reached the stage \u2013 it certainly has for me \u2013 that whatever Boris Johnson says, you automatically think the opposite must be true?\n\nHelen Bore\n\nScalby\u200b\n\nSpreading hate\n\nThe hate and racism that is spreading in this country since the Brexit vote has to stop.
