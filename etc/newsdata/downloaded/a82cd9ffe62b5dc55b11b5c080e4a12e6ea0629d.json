The lyrics point to their doomed reconciliation in late 2017 and Selena\u2019s struggle to come out unscathed. Sixth months after their breakup, he would be engaged and married to Hailey Baldwin. \u201cThis song was inspired by many things that have happened in my life since releasing my last album,\u201d Gomez said in a press release. \u201cI thought it was important to share the music, as I know many can relate to the fact that the road to self-discovery generally comes through the scars in one\u2019s life. I want people to feel hope and to know you will come out the other side stronger and a better version of yourself.\u201d The new single walks us through Selena\u2019s perspective on the breakup, so here\u2019s everything you need to know about the end of Jelena.\n\nIt was rough from the start.\n\n\u201cYou promised the world / And I fell for it / I put you first and you adored it / Set fires to my forest / And you let it burn / Sang off-key in my chorus / \u2019Cause it wasn\u2019t yours. / I saw the signs and I ignored it / Rose-colored glasses all distorted\u201d\n\nWhen Jelena reunited in late 2017, the stans were thrilled (a truce between Selenators and Beliebers is big), but Selena paints a different picture. She describes the relationship as one-sided, with her putting him first and him letting her fall by the wayside. Blinded by her love, she \u201cignored\u201d signs, like the ones her mom and her best friend, Taylor Swift, were holding up. In 2013, sources told Us Weekly that Taylor \u201chates\u201d him. More recently, Taylor liked a Tumblr post that said Justin cheated on Selena, although it\u2019s unclear when or with whom.\n\nShe confirms that Justin could be cruel.\n\n\u201cSet fire to my purpose / And I let it burn / You got off on the hurting when it wasn\u2019t yours\u201d\n\nEarlier this summer, Justin penned a very long note on Instagram, revealing that he mistreated people in his past. \u201cI became resentful, disrespectful to women, and angry,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI became distant to everyone who loved me, and I was hiding behind a shell of a person that I had become. I felt like I could never turn it around.\u201d In \u201cLose You to Love Me,\u201d Selena opens up about being on the receiving end of that hate.\n\nAlso, the use of the word \u201cpurpose\u201d could be a reference to Justin Bieber\u2019s album of the same name. The couple had been on and off up until 2014, so she\u2019s possibly referencing that time period in their relationship, when he was more focused on himself and making the album. (The lyrics, \u201cSang off key in my chorus / \u2019Cause it wasn\u2019t yours\u201d from earlier also point to this.) Or, she\u2019s using it more generally, to signal to fans just whom she\u2019s talking about. We love a queen who does the work for us.\n\nJustin broke up with Selena \u2026\n\n\u201cI gave my all and they all know it / You turned me down and now it\u2019s showing / In two months, you replaced us / Like it was easy\u201d\n\n\u2026 Or at the very least was the one who made the relationship untenable. The second verse frames their breakup as if Justin was the one who didn\u2019t want to continue. She sings, \u201cYou turned me down and now it\u2019s showing,\u201d suggesting that he ended things. A month after the world found out about their break (turned breakup), Justin was already hanging out with his ex, Hailey Baldwin. The \u201cthey\u201d could be her fans, who frequently sent Justin Bieber hate, especially after he got married. He wrote a message to those fans on Instagram, saying \u201cI absolutely loved and love Selena she will always hold a place in my heart, but I am head over heels in love with my wife and she is absolutely the BEST THING that has ever happened to me period.\u201d So, maybe it was easy for him.\n\nThe breakup didn\u2019t help Selena\u2019s mental-health battle.\n\n\u201cMade me think I deserved it / In the thick of healing, yeah\u201d\n\nIn October of last year, Selena Gomez was admitted to a mental-health care facility after experiencing multiple emergencies related to her ongoing health issues. So, literally while \u201cin the thick of healing,\u201d both emotionally and physically, the whole world was captivated by Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin\u2019s engagement (a month later, they would be quietly married). That\u2019s so much to deal with that it feels like \u201cLose You to Love Me\u201d hardly captures the scope of the pain. What\u2019s the rest of the album going to be like?\n\nSelena found self-love by being alone.\n\n\u201cI needed to lose you to find me / This dancing was killing me softly / I needed to hate you to love me, yeah\u201d\n\n\u201cTo love, yeah, I needed to lose you to love me, yeah\u201d\n\nThe prechorus and chorus echo the song\u2019s message: Losing him was the best thing she ever did. After recognizing the toll the relationship was taking on her, she realized she had to move on to really love herself. The \u201cdancing\u201d could be a metaphor for their on-and-off again relationship or for the dynamic within their relationship.\n\nShe\u2019s done with all of this.\n\n\u201cAnd now the chapter is closed / To love, love, yeah / To love, love, yeah / To love, yeah / And now it\u2019s goodbye, goodbye for us\u201d\n\nWe can decode these final lyrics by looking to a whole other song: \u201cDeath by a Thousand Cuts\u201d by Taylor Swift. Taylor mentions in her Tiny Desk Concert that the song was partially inspired by a friend\u2019s crazy breakup: \u201cthose kinds of breakups where you need to talk your friend all the time because they need to talk about it all day, everyday.\u201d Although it\u2019s not necessarily about Selena and Justin, lyrics like \u201cBut if the story\u2019s over, why am I still writing pages?\u201d and \u201cGave you so much, but it wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d echo lyrics in \u201cLose You to Love Me.\u201d Either way, with \u201cLose You to Love Me,\u201d Selena has closed the Book of Jelena, officially. Sis is ready to move on and it\u2019s about time we let her.
