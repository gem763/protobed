While my friends read about the adventures of the \"Knight of the Sad Countenance,\" I struggled through the epic poem Beowulf.\n\nThis year marks 400 years since the death of Cervantes, a perfect excuse for a road trip in the footsteps of Don Quixote and his loyal squire Sancho Panza across the high plains of today's La Mancha, the arid region south of Madrid.\n\nCervantes didn\u2019t give away the name of Don Quixote\u2019s birthplace, but some people identify it as Argamasilla. Other locations in La Mancha fight for that distinction, but Argamasilla showcases a rebuilt house with a cave underneath where, according to local legend, Cervantes was imprisoned. In the prologue to \"El Quijote,\" Cervantes wrote that his work had been \"engendered in a jail\". These days visitors can see the Cave of Medrano and imagine that Cervantes wrote part of his masterpiece there.", "description": "I confess: I have not read \"The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha,\" the literary masterpiece by Spanish writer Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra.", "authors": ["Susana Vera"], "top_image": "https://photos.wi.gcs.trstatic.net/WBTnOVC7qqta06gXHeKsQ0Bstl3S8jiK8i3lzRxEWizdrzpq-FTshiz2as6FhGJUCf8avJRTlWYMbNUzeSVP1MR_hiVBmTEzuzcMeSORN9JeEiXGJLAsS1_7vFVLaSaw"}
