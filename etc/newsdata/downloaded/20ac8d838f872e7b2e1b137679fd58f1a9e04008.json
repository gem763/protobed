He could not believe what David Montgomery, his new backfield weapon, had just said.\n\nThis was the summer, shortly after the Chicago Bears selected Montgomery in the third round of the NFL draft, and Nagy was on the phone with the former Iowa State star, who had just asked his new head coach what he had to do to make the team, even though he was a top-100 pick and had nothing to worry about.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\u201cYes \u2026 he said it,\u201d Nagy told Yahoo Sports with a laugh, \u201cand, yes, I did have to keep myself from laughing.\u201d\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, download it here.]\n\nBears rookie David Montgomery didn't have to worry about making the 53-man roster. (Getty Images)\n\nIn a way, Nagy wasn\u2019t surprised. Though Montgomery\u2019s combination of size (5-feet-10, 222 pounds), collegiate production (1,216 rushing yards and 13 touchdowns in 2018) and elusiveness (he led college football in broken tackles last season) already made him an alluring pick, Montgomery\u2019s humility and workmanlike attitude was a primary reason the Bears and general manager Ryan Pace fell in love with him.\n\n\u201cHis strength is he\u2019s very humble and he has zero expectations,\u201d Nagy said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a first-round pick, we didn\u2019t have a second-round pick \u2026 and when he was sitting there, to us, he was a first-round talent.\u201d\n\nOne who fits a need in Chicago, especially with the offseason trade of last year\u2019s leading rusher, Jordan Howard, to the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd while third-year pro Tarik Cohen, a 5-foot-6, 181-pound blur who rushed 99 times for 444 yards and three touchdowns a year ago (while also catching 71 passes for 725 yards and five touchdowns) is expected to open the season as the Bears\u2019 lead back, there\u2019s little doubt about how hard Montgomery has worked to prepare himself for the opportunity for carries that Howard\u2019s void creates.\n\n\u201cHe wants the ball every play, every rep in the preseason,\u201d Nagy said. \u201cHe wants special teams, whatever he can \u2014 he wants to do it all. Everything about his life is football.\u201d\n\nMontgomery, 22, certainly agrees with that notion.\n\n\u201cFootball teaches you a lot about life; I know football makes me better as a man,\u201d Montgomery told Yahoo Sports. \u201cThere\u2019s responsibility, adversity, it\u2019s like family. A lot of the open voids in my life, football was able to fill.\u201d\n\nMontgomery was also alluding to growing up in poverty in Cincinnati. His maturity stems his desire to be a good example for four of his siblings, which partly explains why he says he avoids drinking and smoking.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not against anybody who does it, it\u2019s just never been my thing,\u201d Montgomery said. \u201cI just kind of kick it and stay up on things so I don\u2019t mess things up.\u201d\n\nThat type of laser focus on his future also explains why he started a nightly workout club for Iowa State\u2019s team on the weekends during the offseason after his freshman year in 2016.\n\n\u201cWe would go in the indoor [facility] at late night and do drills,\u201d Montgomery said. \u201cI started it but other guys started to come in ... I wasn\u2019t asking guys to come but eventually guys would start to follow so it was cool. We were there for up to four or five hours, trying to get better.\u201d\n\nMontgomery takes pride in the fact that the Cyclones went 8-5 in the two years after he started the club following that freshman season, in which Iowa State went 3-9.\n\n\u201cIt definitely raised the bar,\u201d Montgomery said. \u201cIt\u2019s really about the legacy I leave. I want my kids to see what their father was able to do.\u201d\n\nMontgomery, by the way, says he doesn\u2019t have kids.\n\n\u201cJust trying to be prepared,\u201d Montgomery said. \u201cMy biggest thing is to come out here, make my mark and let everyone know I am here.\u201d\n\nIn that area, he\u2019s already succeeded to a degree, as it appears his veteran teammates can\u2019t help but respect Montgomery\u2019s focus.\n\n\u201cHe has a pro mindset already,\u201d safety Ha Ha Clinton-Dix told Yahoo Sports. \u201cTo be so young and watch him come out to work, to work each and every day, trying to get better, taking 5-yard routes, 5-yard gains, and still going finishing [through] the end zone shows a lot about his character.\n\nDavid Montgomery has the look of a workhorse running back. (Getty Images)\n\n\u201cHe wants to win, he wants to be a part of something special and I think he\u2019s gonna do that \u2026 it just goes to show how much of a pro he\u2019s gonna be when he gets a little older and a few years under his belt.\u201d\n\nMontgomery will take his first step toward making his mark in the NFL on Thursday night, when the Bears open up the NFL\u2019s regular-season slate at home against the Green Bay Packers.\n\nAnd given the rookie\u2019s mentality \u2014 which is best exemplified by his sincere question this summer about what he needs to do to make the team, a moment that still makes Nagy chuckle \u2014 the Bears have no shortage of hope that Montgomery will live up to his potential, likely sooner than later.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pinching ourselves,\u201d Nagy said. \u201cWe are.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Matt Nagy believes Chicago landed a first-round talent in the Iowa State rusher.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/8EqrNdS5g_vdRMqRu.uFNw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTIuMjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/kNAJuZkrZ_RP100bQdsMVg--~B/aD0zMjgwO3c9NDkyODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/d435cbf0-cea2-11e9-8fed-f4fb6734188c"}
