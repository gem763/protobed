It was a bright, cloudless afternoon; the city was just leaning into spring. Interested locals in t-shirts and shorts were lightly scattered around the field, leaning against rickety fence-posts.\n\nSome spectators sat along the splintery wooden benches that were set up on a small hill overlooking the field. The back fence was low enough that a neighbour\u2019s hills-hoist, that Great Pyramid of suburbia, could be seen jutting out of the surrounding shrubbery.\n\nAustralia's Matildas announce home friendlies in November Read more\n\nThe women, dressed in dark green jerseys, stood in a line across the dry, patchy grass. They shook the hands of their New Zealand opponents and took their places on the field, ready for the whistle.\n\n90 minutes later, the game ended. The score was 2-2. It was the first international \u201cA\u201d match the Matildas ever played, and the field \u2014 Seymour Shaw Park \u2014 was written into history.\n\nOnly, it wasn\u2019t. In fact, there\u2019s hardly any evidence that the game existed at all.\n\nThere were no front-page stories or interviews with players; no announcements or ceremonies marking the occasion. All we know about this historic match 40 years ago today has come through a handful of black and white photographs, a team list, and a newspaper clipping from The Canberra Times, which was published a few weeks later, and buried beneath the results from the dogs and the horses.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody realised [the importance of the game] at the time,\u201d said Julie Dolan, who captained the side that day. \u201cIt\u2019s an enormous occasion to pull on a green and gold jumper, so you\u2019re thinking about that; you\u2019re thinking about the opposition and the coach\u2019s instruction. And there\u2019s no thought whatsoever as to being back here in 40 years\u2019 time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI remember some stands and a few people in the audience,\u201d said Dolan\u2019s team-mate, Sue Monteath. \u201cBut we\u2019ve had more attention today than any other time. I don\u2019t think there was a lot of press or print media or TV or anything happening at that time.\n\n\u201cIt certainly wasn\u2019t just another game because any time you go and play for your nation, it\u2019s pretty special. It [didn\u2019t feel] like the first time; any time that you put on that strip and played for your country was something to cherish.\u201d\n\nMoya Dodd: \u2018My role was to represent women\u2019s football at the top table\u2019 | Kieran Pender Read more\n\nIn August, Football Federation Australia announced the creation of a Football Heritage Committee, designed to preserve and celebrate the history of the game in Australia. Yesterday, committee member Simon Hill was present for the unveiling of a plaque commemorating the Matildas\u2019 pioneering match \u2014 the first plaque of its kind in Australia.\n\nThe fact that it took this long to formally recognise such a significant match in Australian history speaks volumes about the historical indifference to the contribution women have made to the sport. It\u2019s not that women haven\u2019t been playing or watching or contributing to the game, it\u2019s that nobody cared that they did.\n\n\u201cIf one looks for silences in the record, then there appears to be an absence of women in football clubs and crowds,\u201d writes academic Greg Downes. \u201cOf all groups involved in the game, they were the most marginalised. Until this gap is filled, the history of football clubs will be seriously incomplete.\u201d\n\nThe history of Australian women\u2019s football \u2014 and women\u2019s football around the world \u2014 is structured by exclusion and silence. Having been banned for almost fifty years, the sport never had the opportunity to embed itself in our national consciousness the way the men\u2019s game did.\n\nMatildas captain Sam Kerr honoured with two prestigious US awards Read more\n\nSo scant was the interest that some retired Matildas don\u2019t have a single photo of themselves playing for their country. And yet it was a space where central questions of identity, belonging, and nationhood were played out \u2014 it is a space still brimming with conversations about who we are and where we\u2019ve come from.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have the present without the past,\u201d said current Matilda Tameka Yallop. \u201cI think it\u2019s extremely important to go back to the roots of where it all began, and when you talk about passion and the love of the game, it starts with them. When you do realise the sacrifices that were made back then so that we could step out on the field today, and with the support we have today, that\u2019s where it\u2019s all driven from.\n\n\u201cEven just in terms of respect for the game, respect for your team-mates, that initial passion, everything follows from where it all began.\u201d\n\nWhile history may have positioned it as such, women have never and will never be peripheral to the Australian game. If they haven\u2019t been on the field, they\u2019ve been selling the pies in canteens, setting up the nets, counting the coins, cleaning the boots, and feeding the mouths of the people history has chosen to remember instead.\n\nWorld-beating women inspiring England\u2019s footballers, says Phil Neville Read more\n\nBut times are changing. The Matildas are now Australia\u2019s most-loved sporting team; they\u2019ve appeared on the biggest international stages in front of tens of thousands of screaming fans. Their stars are the faces of multi-billion-dollar companies with global reach. They\u2019re on our televisions, in our social media feeds, and splashed \u2014 finally \u2014 across the front pages of our newspapers.\n\nIn order to understand what this means and why it matters, it\u2019s imperative that the history of the Matildas is unearthed. The stories must be told by the women themselves, whose memories are treasure-chests filled with moments of personal, local and national importance. They can only serve to make our game richer.\n\nLionesses set to break attendance record for women\u2019s match in England Read more\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happened in the ensuing years is how we\u2019d like to be remembered,\u201d Dolan said. \u201cLaying the foundations for this passion, this dedication, this work ethic that goes into every Matildas team. We can see it in the current Matildas and all the players represented through the years have added their own little bit to it and build on those foundations. So it\u2019s a great honour to have the current group here to see where it all began.\u201d\n\nHistory is a series of decisions; a reflection of the people and the stories we consider worthy of remembering. If we are to construct a new history of football in Australia, and if we are to understand and care about the game in all its complexities and contradictions, equal space must be given to the voices of the women who have been part of it from the beginning.
