But there\u2019s one thing nobody can debate: The man is tall and therefore needs a suitably tall actor to play him in the upcoming miniseries adaptation of his book, A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies and Leadership. Enter Jeff Daniels, who may not reach the former FBI director\u2019s towering 6\u20198\u201d stature but is a distinctive 6\u20193\u201d and has played a blustering, self-righteous newsman for Aaron Sorkin, which adds at least four extra inches to one\u2019s height. And who will Daniels have that awkward dinner with when his Comey is asked by the president of the United States to stop investigating his Cabinet members for their contacts with the Russian government? It will be Brendan Gleeson as Donald Trump, whose many possible qualities we simply do not have time to get into here.\n\nCaptain Phillips screenwriter Billy Ray adapted the book and will also direct the series. The scope of Loyalty covers Comey\u2019s four-year tenure as head of the FBI, which started in 2013 and ended in 2017, after he was fired by Trump. So, within all that you have the Clinton-email controversy and the role he may or may not have played in Trump\u2019s securing the White House. A \u2026 tall order indeed.\n\nUpdate: Additional casting has been announced for the four-hour series. Michael Kelly will play acting FBI director Andrew McCabe, and Jennifer Ehle will play Comey\u2019s wife, Patrice.", "description": "Jeff Daniels will play James Comey and Brendan Gleeson will play Donald Trump in a new miniseries based on the former FBI director\u2019s book, A Higher Loyalty.", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/07/07-jeff-daniels.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
