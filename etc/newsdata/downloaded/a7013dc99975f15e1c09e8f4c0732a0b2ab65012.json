Canned salmon (I prefer the small 5- or 6-ounce cans that do not contain bones or skin) is less expensive than fillets. It\u2019s already cooked, so it\u2019s perfectly suited to this easy and festive holiday dip. To keep calories low, I like to use romaine or endive leaves instead of crackers, but you can use vegetable crudit\u00e9s, too.\n\nServes 6\n\nIngredients:\n\n3 6-ounce cans of salmon\n\n8 ounces of reduced-fat cream cheese, softened\n\n1/4 cup reduced-fat or nonfat sour cream or light cr\u00e8me fraiche\n\n1/4 cup horseradish\n\n1/2 teaspoon salt (substituting lite salt cuts the sodium content in half)\n\n1/4 teaspoon garlic powder\n\nPinch of paprika\n\n12 to 18 romaine leaves (washed and patted dry) or crudit\u00e9s\n\nDirections:\n\nDrain salmon, and flake with a fork. Beat together the cream cheese, sour cream, horseradish, salt (or lite salt), and garlic powder until smooth. Add salmon to the cream cheese mixture, and beat until thoroughly blended. Arrange romaine leaves or crudit\u00e9s on a platter. Spoon salmon dip into a bowl, and sprinkle paprika on top. Serve immediately, or chill for a few hours first.\n\nGet My FREE Curcumin Report Chronic Inflammation Decoded\n\nNutritional information per serving: 231 calories, 14 g fat (5 g saturated), 5 g carbohydrates, 1 g fiber, 19 g protein, 26 mg cholesterol, 350 mg sodium, 1 g sugar\n\nNote: Nutritional values are estimates only and may vary according to freshness of ingredients, methods of preparation, and other factors.\n\nDid You Enjoy This Article?
