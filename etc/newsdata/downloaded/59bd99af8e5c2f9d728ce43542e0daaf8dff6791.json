This unprecedented incident might have raised expenses for the aerospace giant\u2019s commercial unit, which has already been under pressure due to the grounding of its 737 Max jets.\n\nScheduled for release on Oct 23, Boeing\u2019s third-quarter 2019 results are likely to reflect these factors.\n\nClick here to know how the company\u2019s overall Q3 performance is expected to be.\n\n777X Setback\n\nIn September, a cargo door of a 777X model exploded during a structural test, thereby further delaying the fleet\u2019s delivery schedule. The explosion forced Boeing to suspend the structural load tests of this jet family. As a result of this flight-testing failure, the jet major will have to get the door replaced and repeat the final stages of the test.\n\nThis might have pushed up operation and maintenance cost for the company\u2019s commercial business segment and dragged down the unit\u2019s bottom line.\n\nThe Boeing Company Price and EPS Surprise\n\nThe Boeing Company Price and EPS Surprise More\n\nThe Boeing Company price-eps-surprise | The Boeing Company Quote\n\nThis setback related to the 777X product line along with the company\u2019s poor deliveries for the overall commercial business, which slumped 202% from the year-ago quarter, are expected to have hit the company\u2019s Q3 commercial results hard.
