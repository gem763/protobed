Right now, we're in a very important stage in terms of possibly making a deal. If we make it, it will be the biggest trade deal ever made.\"\n\nOn Thursday Mr Trump publicly urged Beijing to investigate Mr Biden, a Democrat, again raising concerns that he has invited foreign interference in the US presidential election. Last week Mr Trump released a transcript of a call where he asked Ukraine's president to also look into Mr Biden, a request that has triggered an impeachment inquiry by House of Representatives Democrats.\n\nFINANCIAL SERVICES HOPES\n\nMr Kudlow, in television interviews, held out hope for progress in opening China's financial services markets to American companies in next week's talks, adding the US team was heading into them \"open-minded\".\n\n\"Everything's on the table, we'd love to go back to where we were in May when we were a lot closer,\" Mr Kudlow told Bloomberg TV.\n\nThe Trump trade team hoped to revisit a mostly agreed text from which China had backtracked in May, causing talks to break down, he said.\n\nThe text at that time included an agreement negotiated by Mr Mnuchin that involved the lifting of foreign ownership caps on financial services firms in China.\n\n\"I'm not giving you news. I'm just saying we had some pretty good things last spring, like financial services opening - that could be extended,\" Mr Kudlow said in a subsequent interview on Fox Business Network. \"I say 'could' and the president would have to sign off on it, but don't rule out the possibility of good news.\"\n\nMr Kudlow declined to make any predictions about the talks but said there had been a \"softening of the psychology on both sides\" over the past month, with the US delaying some tariff increases and China making some modest purchases of American farm products.\n\nMr Kudlow also said the impeachment inquiry was unlikely to affect the trade talks with China.\n\n\"I don't think that's an impact right now. I think maybe it has only the tiniest, tiniest effect, maybe occasionally on stock market psychology,\" Mr Kudlow said.\n\nHowever, he said the Trump administration continued to monitor freedom and democracy protests, which he said could have an impact on the talks, without specifying how. China-backed Hong Kong authorities have struggled to curb anti-government protests that have continued for four months.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [WASHINGTON] US President Donald Trump said on Friday that his administration has a \"very good chance\" of making a trade deal with China, and insisted there were no links between China talks and his desire for Beijing to investigate US Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. .
