It's time to lift each other up, not to push each other away. We only win when we are together,' he wrote.\n\nXhaka also refused to shake the hand of manager Unai Emery as the ugly scenes escalated\n\nHector Bellerin has pleaded for unity and insisted all humans have emotions to deal with\n\nBellerin took to social media to offer support to Xhaka and make a plea to the supporters\n\nXhaka's outburst came with director Josh Kroenke in attendance, as at least three former Arsenal captains - Pat Rice, David O'Leary and Thierry Henry - also watched on from the stands.\n\nIan Wright, who scored 185 goals during his time with the club, fumed at Xhaka's behaviour.\n\n'He's the captain,' he said on Match of the Day 2.\n\n'He's got the responsibility of being able to take that on board because he's been voted in. You can't go like that.\n\n'The amount of stick someone like Mesut Ozil has got I could understand if (he) throws his shirt down.\n\n'He's the captain, the manager has got faith in him. He should be apologising, he should have apologised already.\n\n'That's the guy they've chosen as captain and that's not captain's behaviour. Arsenal fans have shown a lot of patience with him and the performances he has put in. He owes them a lot more than that.'\n\nArsenal let slip a two-goal lead as Crystal Palace left the Emirates with a point in the bag\n\nOn a combustible afternoon in north London, Emery also took more flak as his side gave up a two-goal lead to be held to a draw.\n\nArsenal were two goals ahead inside the opening 10 minutes as defenders Sokratis Papastathopoulos and David Luiz struck just 106 seconds apart.\n\nBut Palace fought back for a share of the spoils as Luka Milivojevic converted a VAR-awarded penalty before Jordan Ayew's second-half header saw the Eagles draw level.\n\nSokratis thought he had won it for the hosts late on, only for his effort to be chalked off by VAR after a foul in the build-up.\n\nThe result means Arsenal have won just two of their last eight Premier League games, with Emery's side sitting fifth in the table.", "description": "Hector Bellerin has called for unity at Arsenal after captain Granit Xhaka swore at supporters during Sunday's Premier League draw with Crystal Palace.
