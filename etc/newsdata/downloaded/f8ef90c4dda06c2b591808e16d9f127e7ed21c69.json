From the Hollywood Reporter:\n\nMcGowan\u2019s claims include racketeering, violations of the Federal Wiretap Act, invasion of privacy, fraud and intentional infliction of emotional distress. \u201cThis case is about a diabolical and illegal effort by one of America\u2019s most powerful men and his representatives to silence sexual-assault victims,\u201d states the opening sentence of the complaint, which is posted below. \u201cAnd it is about the courageous women and journalists who persisted to reveal the truth.\u201d\n\nThe details of how Weinstein hired Black Cube to spy on McGowan in an effort to gain access to her autobiography were conveyed in a story Ronan Farrow wrote back in 2017. Here\u2019s a summary of some of that material as it appears in McGowan\u2019s lawsuit:\n\nIn 2016, nearly two decades after WEINSTEIN raped her, MCGOWAN began working on a memoir and motivational book called Brave, which HarperCollins published in January 2018. The book was not all about WEINSTEIN; it was about MCGOWAN\u2019s life, including challenges throughout her childhood and as a young woman. To be sure, however, MCGOWAN intended to write about the painful episode in her life involving WEINSTEIN. She intended to describe the rape, in detail, and to discuss how WEINSTEIN\u2019s conduct toward her and others poisoned the film and television industry. When WEINSTEIN learned of MCGOWAN\u2019s plans, he tapped into his team of fixers. The goal was to ensure that MCGOWAN\u2019s story never saw the light of day, and\u2014if it did\u2014that no one would believe her\u2026 He enlisted prominent, media-savvy representatives DAVID BOIES and LISA BLOOM. He hired the international spy agency, BLACK CUBE. Together, they worked in concert for more than a year to silence WEINSTEIN\u2019s victims and the journalists who were reporting WEINSTEIN\u2019s abuses. With MCGOWAN specifically, Defendants tried steal MCGOWAN\u2019s unpublished book, attempted to buy MCGOWAN\u2019s silence, and planned\u2014in the event that they could not intimidate MCGOWAN into withholding her book\u2014to undermine MCGOWAN\u2019s reputation, such that she would not be believed.\n\nPeople working for Black Cube made several contacts with McGowan under false pretenses in which they tried to convince her it would be a bad idea to say anything about Weinstein:\n\nIn early January 2017, MCGOWAN\u2019s literary agent Lacy Lynchconnected her with Seth Freedman, whom she described to MCGOWAN as afreelance journalist from London, who was allegedly working on a story about menin Hollywood. MCGOWAN spoke to the journalist by phone. Freedman was inEngland at the time, and MCGOWAN was in the United States\u2026 Many of Freedman\u2019s statements to MCGOWAN seemed designed tointimidate her. For example, he suggested to MCGOWAN that others might beafraid to go on the record with allegations about WEINSTEIN because \u201cif they dosay it, then they\u2019ll never work again.\u201d He also suggested that MCGOWAN wouldsuffer if she named WEINSTEIN because someone could \u201ccome back at\u201d her.Freedman ultimately asked MCGOWAN what would make her \u201ccall it quits,\u201dmeaning refrain from going public with her allegations against WEINSTEIN. MCGOWAN did not know it at the time, but would learn much laterthat Freedman was being paid by BLACK CUBE to get information aboutMCGOWAN and her book, and that he was recording their call withoutMCGOWAN\u2019s consent. BLACK CUBE was likewise using Freedman to try toobtain information about other possible WEINSTEIN accusers and \u201cunfriendly\u201d journalists.\n\nSeth Freedman and another Black Cube operative using the fictitious identity Diana Filip were also in contact with reporters who were working on the Weinstein story, trying to find out what they knew so Weinstein could get ahead of the story.\n\nThere\u2019s so much more to McGowan\u2019s story. It really does read like a paperback thriller. But McGowan, thanks in part to work by Ronan Farrow, seems to have the goods to prove it happened. She is requesting an unspecified amount in damages and a jury trial.", "description": "\"This case is about a diabolical and illegal effort by one of America\u2019s most powerful men...\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/McGowan.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
