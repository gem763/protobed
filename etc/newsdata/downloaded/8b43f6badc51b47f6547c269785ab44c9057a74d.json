Where necessary, grades were still changed.\n\n\u2018Reviews of marking are only carried out by our best, most experienced examiners who are very unlikely to have made mistakes in their original marking \u2013 and, in the vast majority of cases, we\u2019re talking about one isolated, anonymised answer from a paper being reviewed by the senior examiner who originally marked it.\n\n\u2018But reviews should always be carried out by a fresh pair of eyes and we\u2019re sorry that, for a small proportion in the past, this wasn\u2019t the case. We\u2019ve made sure we got it right this summer, just as we did after last year\u2019s November exams.\u2019", "description": "AQA, one of England's major exam providers, was slapped with the record \u00a3350,000 fine by the regulator Ofqual after 'serious breaches' were discovered.", "authors": ["Eleanor Harding For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/01/19765314-0-image-a-67_1571184486224.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
