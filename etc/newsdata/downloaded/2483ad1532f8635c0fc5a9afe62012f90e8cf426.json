There\u2019s a lot to love about a Bluetooth speaker that doesn\u2019t sacrifice sound quality for mobility. But is it the all-in-one answer for sound that remains great no matter the setting?\n\nThe Sonos Move is a big ol\u2019 bugger. Let\u2019s just get that out of the way right now. It weighs in at 6.61 lbs, a far cry from the ounces a typical Bluetooth speaker usually tops out at. And while it\u2019s a bit cumbersome to move around, it does give the versatility it promises. It sounds great in any landscape and adjusts to make sure that great sound is continuous no matter what. The charging stand is seamless and simple, allowing you to rest your speaker on the base rather than fumbling with charging cords like you would with other portable speakers.\n\nWhen it comes to sound, it fills a room as any good Sonos speaker does. The rich tones and full bass are extremely enjoyable and it\u2019s something I could see myself bringing to large gatherings to impress friends (I\u2019m really fun at parties, I promise). It may not be the speaker I bring to the park or to the beach (though it\u2019s waterproof and sandproof\u2014basically lifeproof), but it is a speaker that I would bring to other people\u2019s homes to keep the music going way past the battery life of other speakers. It has 10 hours of life on one charge, and the base is easy to set up anywhere.\n\nThe voice-control is an impressive addition, too, but with Alexa or Google Assistant only working through WiFi, you\u2019ll have to stay close to your home WiFi or continue to ask friends for their password. As a speaker, the Sonos Move is big and bold. It combines the ease of a Bluetooth speaker with the sound quality you expect from Sonos. If you want the Sonos sound in your home and couldn\u2019t possibly listen to music without it no matter where you are, the Move is a pretty decent option. | Get it on Amazon >\n\nScouted is internet shopping with a pulse.
