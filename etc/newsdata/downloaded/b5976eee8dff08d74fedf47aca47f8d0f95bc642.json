(Image: Paul Kidby)\n\nWe\u2019ve been hearing tiny little bits of news about the BBC\u2019s attempt to bring the world of Terry Pratchett\u2019s beloved fantasy novels to life since the author\u2019s passing in 2015, but now, the world of the Disc is taking a big step forward in its return to TV.\n\nThe BBC has just announced the full primary cast for The Watch, ahead of production beginning later this month. The series, set in the iconic city-state of Ankh-Morpork, will follow the escapades of the titular Night Watch (no relation), Ankh-Morpork\u2019s dysfunctional city guard, as it attempts to police a world of absurdist magical fantasies.\n\nThe eight-episode series will be directed by Craig Viveiros, the director behind the BBC\u2019s upcoming adaptation of The War of the Worlds. Here\u2019s the new description for the series included in the BBC\u2019s announcement post:\n\nSet in the fictional city of Ankh-Morpork, where crime has been legalised, The Watch is a uniquely anarchic and thrillingly entertaining police procedural. The character-driven comedy centres on a group of misfit cops as they rise up from decades of helplessness to save their corrupt city from catastrophe. The Watch is inspired by the legendary \u2018City Watch\u2019 subset of Sir Terry Pratchett\u2019s bestselling Discworld novels and its many iconic characters.\n\nRichard Dormer, Adam Hugill, Jo Eaton-Kent, Marama Corlett, Lara Rossi and Sam Adewunmi will form the primary cast for the series, playing names that fans of Pratchett\u2019s works will be more than familiar with.\n\nFrom top left to bottom right: Richard Dormer, Marama Corlett, Adam Hugill, Lara Rossi, Jo Eaton-Kent, and Sam Adewunmi. (Photo: BBC)\n\nDormer will lead the cast as Sam Vimes, the Watch\u2019s captain, dismayed by how Ankh-Morpork\u2019s corruption has robbed his guards of their authority. Eaton-Kent, a gender-fluid actor, will play the Watch\u2019s forensics expert, Constable Cheery, described as a non-binary native recruit in the Night Watch ostracised by their kin, and hoping to find their identity in their work for the Watch.\n\nCorlett plays Corporal Angua, a veteran Watch member who is tasked with keeping Hugill\u2019s fresh-faced recruit, Constable Carrot \u2014 a human raised by Dwarves after being orphaned as a child \u2014 alive long enough to rise through the ranks.\n\nRounding out the cast beyond members of the Watch are Rossi\u2019s Lady Sybil Ramkin, a member of Ankh-Morpork nobility that has taken to vigilantism to combat crimes the Watch is powerless to chase, and Adewunmi as Carcer Dun, a mysterious figure wronged by injustice seeking to change not just his own destiny, but the fate of Ankh-Morpork and everyone in it, as vengeance.\n\nThe Watch is set to enter production at the end of the month \u2014 presumably for an as-yet-unconfirmed premiere sometime in 2020.
