But this figure remains way down on the 20th century heyday of the self-governing British Crown dependency.\n\nFurthermore, the Isle of Wight welcomes a remarkable 2.5 million annual visitors \u2013 more than Malta \u2013 while Skye, which for many is far harder to reach, has become overwhelmed in recent years that local police have even urged tourists to stay away. So are we missing out on something? What does the Isle of Man have to offer?\n\nThe Naples of the North\n\nBack in the late Forties, each summer saw half a million people catch a ferry to the island, bucket and spade in hand. \u201cManxland for Mirth and Merriment,\u201d said the posters. Sir John Betjeman was one of its biggest fans, even describing its capital Douglas \u2013 somewhat generously \u2013 as the \u201cNaples of the North\u201d. \u201cA miniature of all the Western world,\u201d he enthused. \u201cSuch wildness and such sophistication, such oldness and such newness.\u201d\n\nNaples of the North? Credit: getty\n\nIts popularity, particularly among working class families from the Lancashire cotton towns, was remarkable, and began in the 19th century, with the introduction of steam ships from Liverpool to Douglas.\n\nA Spectator article from 1880 described the type of tourist found on the island (in a very condescending manner, and for the benefit of curious Londoners): \u201cThey make but a short stay, they ramble over the island, and their loud provincial tones are heard in boisterous merriment. In themselves these people are a study.\n\n\"You see the best of the working class of the North away from their factories and workshops, and though your taste may be oftentimes offended at rude jokes and noisy merriment, they are essentially an independent and hard-working class, even in their amusements.\n\nNot just for the commonfolk Credit: GETTY\n\n\u201cBut the Isle of Man may fairly claim a visit from persons of higher culture than these. Regarded simply as a health resort, there can be no question that it is the most thorough sea residence in the kingdom.\n\n\"On every side is the sea, and from whatever quarter of the compass the wind chooses to blow it comes from the sea, and there is scarcely a spot in the thirty-three miles from the Point of Ayre to the bold cliffs of the Calf of Man, unless it be some narrow inland glen, from which the ocean in its various moods cannot be seen.\u201d\n\nAn early TT racer Credit: GETTY\n\nThe peak came in 1913, when 663,000 made the trip across the Irish Sea, but even in 1964, when the decline, hastened by the advent of cheap package holidays to the Med, was well underway, 21 per cent of the island\u2019s residents were employed by the tourism industry.\n\nThe boom saw the construction of the Isle of Man Railway in the 1870s and the rapid expansion of the harbour at Douglas. In 1907 the Isle of Man TT Race was founded, providing holidaymakers with another reason to go.\n\nToday, however, just a few hundred islanders make a living from tourism, while the sector accounts for just 0.3 per cent of Gross National Income \u2013 and that\u2019s despite the 45,000 motor enthusiasts who still come each year for the TT.\n\nThe Manx Electric Railway Credit: GETTY\n\nThe most bucolic place in the British Isles\n\nThe Isle of Man has tried to find new ways to attract visitors, but one of its charms is its time-warped feel \u2013 as if the clocks froze during that Forties heyday. That\u2019s according to Stephen McClarence, who visited in 2017 for Telegraph Travel and enjoyed a ride on the narrow-gauge Isle of Man Steam Railway (said to have inspired Thomas the Tank Engine) and a horse-tram service along the prom.\n\n\u201cThe atmosphere of much of the whole island is Sixties-going-on-Fifties,\u201d he said. \u201cWe pass shepherds whistling to their dogs, men in flat caps playing bowls, gulls wheeling around a ploughing tractor.\n\n\"Lambs frolic, calves canter to keep up with the train (not hard), a swan takes off from a field, and there are glimpses of sun-sparkling sea beyond the woodlands. It all looks idyllic, like a real-life Ladybird book, perhaps called What to Look for on a Train Journey.\n\n\u201cThe following morning, on the horse-drawn tram along Douglas promenade, we pass hotels called the Grosvenor, the Empress, the Marlborough, the Savoy, the Edelweiss \u2013 memories of the great seaside days. Inside, late risers are tackling their Manx kipper breakfasts.\u201d\n\nIts glorious coastline Credit: GETTY\n\nHeaven for stargazers\n\nSo how else has the Isle of Man reinvented itself? As a stargazing destination, for starters. Low levels of light pollution have helped it become one. It has 26 officially recognised Dark Sky Discovery Sites, the largest cluster in the British Isles. The Milky Way and, occasionally, the Northern Lights, can be seen with the naked eye.\n\nA treat for nature lovers\n\nBack in 2016 the Isle of Man became a designated Biosphere Reserve in recognition of its marine and coastal ecosystems. Of the planet\u2019s 686 reserves, only 11 are found in the British Isles. Others around the world include the Danube Delta, the Sierra Nevada, and Yellowstone National Park.\n\nA (very cute) Manx cat Credit: GETTY\n\nSoak it all up on the Calf of Man. Situated half a mile off the main island\u2019s south-west coast, across turbulent waters, this 600-acre outcrop operates primarily as a bird observatory but also has a huge population of rabbits, which have turned it into some remote version of Watership Down.\n\nOr else head to the Ayres. Stretching between Cronk-y-Bing to the Point of Ayre, the island's northern tip, it consists of 8km of sandy coastline and is a good place to spot oystercatchers, seals and basking sharks.\n\nThe only place where you can see all of the UK\n\nThere is an irony to the fact that Isle of Man is not part of the UK, yet it is the only location in the British Isles from which you can see all the UK\u2019s constituent parts \u2013 on clear days, England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are visible from the 2,037ft Snaefell, reached via the Snaefell Mountain Railway.\n\nAnd a few curious facts\n\nThe island has a breed of tailless cat, the world\u2019s oldest continuous parliament (the Tynwald, reputedly established in 979 AD), an eye-catching three-legged flag, and is the birthplace of the Bee Gees (as well as the greatest sprinter in cycling history, Mark Cavendish). Residents also refuse to say the word \u201crat\u201d out of superstition (they prefer to call them \u201clongtails\u201d).\n\nHow to get there\n\nTake the ferry, just like Betjeman did, from Liverpool (or from Belfast, Heysham, Birkenhead or Dublin) to Douglas. The journey takes two to three hours.
