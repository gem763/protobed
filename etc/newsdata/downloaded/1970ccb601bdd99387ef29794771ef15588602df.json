The true secret to wellness has been found.\n\nAccording to Columbia University psychiatrist Kelli Harding, one of the most important keys to health and wellness has nothing to do with minimalism, snake oil gummies, or appropriative, commodified versions of meaningful Indigenous American practices. It\u2019s not even nutrition, exercise, or even sleeping. It\u2019s kindness. Maybe you\u2019ve heard of it? That\u2019s right. Being kind.\n\n\"The hug you give your child or your spouse when you walk out the door makes a difference, and not only with them,\u201d said Harding in a recent interview with radio show Knowledge@Wharton about her new book, The Rabbit Effect. \u201cThere's this really exciting science of epigenetics and telomere research that shows that loving actions actually change our physiology.\u201d\n\nHarding detailed \u201cthe rabbit study,\u201d which also happens to be where she got her book\u2019s title from. In 1978, researchers found that rabbits were less likely to experience a heart attack or stroke if they were shown physical affection and other forms of care while being fed. Over the subsequent four decades, scientists have continued to find that positive relationships with others lower stress and blood pressure and can even boost our immune systems after we\u2019re injured.\n\nThis all makes sense. When people are nice to me, I feel better, and when I feel better, my quality of life goes up, and so on. But it would also cut into my daily allotted time for Being a Bitch, which is very important to me, personally! How can I reconcile the two? Harding didn\u2019t clarify. She did say that some of that money we\u2019re spending on health care could be spent on kindness(?), though, which\u2026 I\u2019m less certain I agree with.\n\n\"We spend a fortune on medical care in this country\u2014far more than other countries per capita. But we're not getting the health results we want,\u201d Harding continued. \u201cIt's probably because we're really doubling down on the medical care and not investing in our social world the way that we could.\u201d\n\nAs a humble Mrs. Bloghag, I couldn\u2019t be less qualified to debate a literal professional psychiatrist. But I don\u2019t quite understand the binary she\u2019s attempting to construct, which positions \u201cspending money on medical care\u201d and \u201cinvesting in our social world,\u201d i.e., being kind to one another. I would argue that spending money on medical care would be one of the greatest acts of kindness our government could take on at the moment. Just imagine how happy we\u2019d all be and how much longer we\u2019d all live if the government syphoned off some of its multi-billion dollar military spending and funneled it into \u201ckindness,\u201d i.e., paying off everyone\u2019s medical expenses.\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nFollow Harron Walker on Twitter .", "description": "A psychiatrist says we should be kinder to one another to improve our quality of life.
