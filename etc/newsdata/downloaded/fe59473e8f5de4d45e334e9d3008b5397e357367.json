We still had Fabinho in front of us who cleans up everything,\" said the Holland international.\n\n\"They left one or two strikers up front and we tried to get involved. That's the way we play.\n\n\"We just have to do better at winning the second balls and in the transition with the counter-press.\"\n\nUltimately the trade-off worked with Oxlade-Chamberlain scoring twice on his first Champions League appearance in 18 months after recovering from a serious knee injury in the semi-final of the competition in April 2018.\n\n(Image: EMPICS Sport)\n\nAnd it was an outcome which was hugely popular with team-mates and supporters alike.\n\n\"He's worked so hard to get back to this point and he deserves a night like that,\" said Van Dijk.\n\n\"He's such a great guy, such an important guy for the group. He's a quality player and he showed it, not only with his goals, but also with his all-round game.\n\n\"During a difficult period, he always managed to stay positive. We were all there for him.\n\n\"Pre-season was tough for him but he's showing a lot of great things right now. He's so sharp. His goals made the difference.\n\n\"The first one was so important and the second was a killer for them. It's just great to see him back out there.\"\n\nGoalkeeper Alisson Becker, who is just back from his own 11-match absence with a calf injury, also paid tribute to the England international.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"It was special for everyone. We see him working hard on the training ground,\" he told liverpoolfc.com .\n\n\"I worked with him in the last few weeks and in the international break we had training and he was enjoying the sessions.\n\n\"I'm really happy for him scoring like that, playing like that and helping the team. I think he is really happy, as am I.\"\n\nThe Brazil goalkeeper is still waiting for his first clean sheet since returning to fitness after conceding against United and Genk.\n\nHe admits being sidelined was difficult for him but has worked hard to ensure there will hopefully be no more absences.\n\n\"It was a tough moment but I dealt well with it. I spent good time with my family; it's not normal for us as football players,\" he added.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\n\"I tried to get the maximum from the time, I could make a good pre-season - at least three or four weeks of working hard after the recovery time.\n\n\"Now coming back in the Champions League and Premier League with the way the team is playing, I'm really happy to be back.\n\n\"I'll try to do my best to stay here a long time and stay away from injuries.\"", "description": "The Dutch defender has continued his impressive form from the last campaign into the new season", "authors": ["Press Association", "Image", "Reuters", "Empics Sport", "Getty Images", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20645955.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Liverpool-Training-Session.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
