British actress Lashana Lynch\u2019s casting in 2020\u2019s No Time to Die \u2014 Daniel Craig\u2019s last stint as 007 \u2014 has set off whispers that she may become the first female Bond. Pierce Brosnan, for one, is here for it.\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d the former 007 told The Hollywood Reporter said of having a woman take on the Bond role. \"I think we've watched the guys do it for the last 40 years. Get out of the way, guys, and put a woman up there. I think it would be exhilarating, it would be exciting.\u201d\n\nExciting, but perhaps not realistic, he added, noting that the film franchise\u2019s current producers, Barbara Broccoli and half-brother Michael G. Wilson, may resist such change.\n\n\u201cI don't think that's going to happen with the Broccolis,\u201d Brosnan added. \u201cI don't think that is going to happen under their watch.\u201d\n\nView photos Brosnan with GoldenEye co-stars Famke Janssen and Izabella Scorupco in 1995.

Brosnan\u2019s support for a woman to take over the outgoing Craig\u2019s license to kill fired up the franchise\u2019s (mostly male) fans. To make Bond a woman, they argued, would go against writer Ian Fleming\u2019s original vision.\n\nNo no no we don't want tokenism! Character is a man! Smooth sexy seductive! Don't let us spoil everything! \u2014 Jackie P (@Jackie___P) September 8, 2019\n\nIan Fleming wrote the character as a male. End of. \u2014 Nick Bailey (@nickbailey73) September 8, 2019\n\nEr..Ghostbusters 2016??????....not even an option....James Bond is a male ...end of. \u2014 Art Areola (@ArtAreola63) September 8, 2019\n\nThere\u2019s no need. Bond is a man because thats the source material. If you want a woman spy just bloody create one. \u2014 Spoonyspoonson (@spoonyspoonson) September 8, 2019\n\nMaybe create another movie and name it Jane Doe or something, played by a woman.\n\n\n\nIt's titled \"James Bond\" for a reason. \u2014 Emmanuel Adigwe (@e_adigwe) September 8, 2019\n\nThe next Wonder Woman should be a man \u270a\ud83c\udffc \u2014 Gareth Littlefield (@Littlefield_173) September 8, 2019\n\nOh Pierce. If you change everything about the character, it isn't the character anymore. It's literally someone else. So just write a female spy character! \u2014 Michael W (@Mikewsomething) September 8, 2019\n\nMany critics echoed the outrage over the female-led cast of the 2016 Ghostbusters reboot starring Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon. While that film\u2019s reviews were generally positive, it underdelivered at the box office in the face of complaints about its gender-reversed leads.\n\nDespite any push-back and potential backlash, the next James Bond film will at the very least have a more feminist influence. Fleabag star Phoebe Waller-Bridge has been tapped to beef up the No Time to Die script and make Bond more respectful of women in light of the #MeToo movement.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nWant daily pop culture news delivered to your inbox?
