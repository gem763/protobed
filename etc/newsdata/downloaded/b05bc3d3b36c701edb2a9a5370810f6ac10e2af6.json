The 49ers are 7-0 with multiple blowout victories. They look very good.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nNot to Irvin, apparently.\n\nI asked Panthers end Bruce Irvin just how good this 49ers team is. \u201cThey\u2019re OK. They\u2019re OK. They\u2019re not world-beaters,\u201d he said. My guess is SF will use this as another log on the motivational fire. \u2014 Jim Trotter (@JimTrotter_NFL) October 27, 2019\n\nEven if you don\u2019t think the 49ers are that good, saying so after a 51-13 loss might not be the right time.\n\nThere are some arguments against the 49ers, mostly based on their schedule. They\u2019ve beat up on some bad teams, but they\u2019ve also scored blowout wins over teams like the Panthers and Rams. And they\u2019re 7-0. This isn\u2019t Conference USA. There are no easy wins in the NFL (though the 2019 Miami Dolphins might be the exception to that).\n\nSo Irvin doesn\u2019t like the 49ers. He has a long plane flight back to Charlotte to think about it.\n\nSANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA - OCTOBER 27: Bruce Irvin #55 of the Carolina Panthers sacks quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo #10 of the San Francisco 49ers during the third quarter of an NFL football game at Levi's Stadium on October 27, 2019 in Santa Clara, California.
