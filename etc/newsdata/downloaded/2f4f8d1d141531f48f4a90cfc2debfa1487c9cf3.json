The bill passed 405-11. Erdogan then said Turkey \u201cstrongly condemns\u201d a bipartisan bill to sanction senior Turkish officials and its army for Turkey\u2019s incursion into northeastern Syria, which passed 403-16.\n\nBoth bills, passed Tuesday, were a sign of further deterioration in Turkish-American relations, which have been strained over multiple issues, especially U.S. support for Syrian Kurdish fighters considered terrorists by Ankara.\n\nTurkey\u2019s foreign ministry said that it summoned U.S. Ambassador David Satterfield on Wednesday over the resolutions.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

It has instead called for a joint committee of historians to investigate. \u201cWe are saddened that a slander against our country is being accepted by a country\u2019s parliament,\u201d he said and added, \u201cwe would consider this accusation the biggest insult towards our nation.\u201d\n\nThe step to consider the events as genocide \u201cdoes not count for anything,\u201d Erdogan argued, saying American lawmakers had acted \u201copportunistically\u201d to pass the bill at a time when Turkey is being widely criticized for its incursion into Syria.\n\nTurkey\u2019s cross-border offensive against Syrian Kurdish fighters, which Ankara says is necessary for its national security, began on Oct. 9 after months of Turkish threats and a sudden decision by U.S. President Donald Trump to withdraw troops and abandon Kurdish allies against the Islamic State group. Trump\u2019s move was widely criticized by both the Republicans and the Democrats.\n\nRead more: U.S. Spies Say Turkish-Backed Militias Are Killing Civilians as They Clear Kurdish Areas in Syria\n\nThe second bill sanctioning Turkey shows the bipartisan disapproval of Trump\u2019s decision and condemns Turkey\u2019s offensive. The measure would bar most U.S. weapons sales to Turkey and slap sanctions on foreigners attempting to send the Turks military equipment. It would also block high-ranking Turkish officials from their assets in the U.S. and restrict their travel here.\n\n\u201cWe will never accept those who attack Turkey and myself for the sake of supporting the PKK, which is a terror organization that is the killer of tens of thousands of people,\u201d Erdogan said.\n\nHe was referring to the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, which has waged a 35-year armed insurgency in Turkey\u2019s southeast and eastern regions. The Syrian Kurdish forces are linked to the group and follow the same ideological leader, Abdullah Ocalan, who is imprisoned in Turkey.\n\nTurkey halted its operation through two separate cease-fires brokered by the U.S. and Russia to allow the Kurdish fighters to withdraw 30 kilometers (19 miles) away from the Turkish border but Erdogan renewed threats to resume the operation if promises weren\u2019t fulfilled.\n\nTurkey and allied Syrian fighters now control a portion of the previously Kurdish-held border zone, as Russian and Syrian government troops move into the rest of the areas following a deal with the Kurdish force.\n\nTurkey\u2019s foreign ministry criticized American lawmakers in a statement, saying it would be wrong for them to take their \u201cvengeance\u201dfor Turkey\u2019s Syria offensive through the Armenian genocide bill. \u201cUndoubtedly, this resolution will negatively affect the image of the U.S. before the public opinion of Turkey,\u201d the ministry said.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Turkey condemned two resolutions Wednesday passed by the House of Representatives that symbolize deteriorating Turkish-American relations.", "authors": ["Zeynep Bilginsoy"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/recep-tayyip-erdogan.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
