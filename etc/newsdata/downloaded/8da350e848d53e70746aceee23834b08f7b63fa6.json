The affordable range sold out quickly and some pieces even appeared on Ebay for double the retail price as shoppers cashed in on the popularity of certain pieces.\n\nNow the former X-Factor hopefully is launching a second collection with Primark that looks set to be a sell-out like the first.\n\nWhen does Stacey Solomon\u2019s Primark collection go on sale?\n\nStacey Solomon\u2019s latest Primark range includes a collection of easy-to-wear pieces for autumn and winter including calf-skimming skirts, chic coats, faux leather and plaid pieces and a snuggly looking sweatshirt that says mother on \u2013 modelled by the mum herself with her new baby Rex in tow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStacey\u2019s new Primark collection arrives in stores on October 10 2019 and prices will vary from \u00a34 up to \u00a335.\n\nThe star models her own range in the photographs for the new collection and, following the precedent she has set on her social media channels, none of the images are airbrushed.\n\nStacey models her new collection for Primark (Picture: Primark)\n\n\u2018I\u2019m so excited and proud to say I\u2019m doing another collection with Primark,\u2019 Stacey wrote on Instagram.\n\n\u2018Never in a million years did I think I\u2019d get to design and make a collection with a brand I have shopped in my whole life.
