It is no surprise that the demand for the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro is skyrocketing due to its pricing (iPhone 11 starts at Rs 64,900, iPhone 11 Pro starts at 99,900 whereas the 11 Pro Max starts at Rs 1,09,900).\n\nEven in India, the base 64GB variant of the iPhone 11 went out of stock before it even hit the shelves (during pre-orders) everywhere (online and offline channels across the country) with limited stocks for the 128GB.\n\nDon't Miss 1.2 K SHARES 331 SHARES 3.5 K SHARES\n\nA source with knowledge about this situation said in a statement to Nikkei Asian Review, \"Previously, Apple was quite conservative about placing orders,\" which were less than for last year's new iPhone. \"After the increase, prepared production volume for the iPhone 11 series will be higher compared to last year.\"\n\nThe source further added, \"Demand is good for now. But we have to be careful not to be too optimistic.\"\n\nApple\n\nApple iPhone 11 sports a 6.1-inch LCD Retina display whereas the 11 and 11 Pro get a 5.8 and a 6.4-inch OLED Retina display. Under the hood, they're rocking the A13 Bionic Hexa-core processor.\n\nThe major difference between the two phones is with the camera setup at the back. While the iPhone 11 gets dual 12-megapixel (a primary shooter and a secondary ultra-wide shooter), the iPhone 11 Pros get a third 12-megapixel telephoto shooter. What's also different are the colour and finish options with iPhone 11 getting a glossy glass back, and the 11 Pros getting a matte finish.", "description": "The boost in sales, however, is only for the iPhone 11 and the 11 Pro, whereas Apple has cut back the production of its most expensive smartphone line -- the iPhone 11 Pro Max.
