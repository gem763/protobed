For the first time in years the studio may have an Oscar contender, thanks to a Fox title: \"Ford v Ferrari.\"\n\nThe epic true story starring Matt Damon and Christian Bale as two race-car drivers in the 1960s who are recruited by the Ford Motor Co. to create a car that can beat Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans is building buzz after the film played at the Telluride and Toronto film festivals. Both are major stops on the awards circuit (the movie opens in theaters on November 15).\n\nThe movie's director, James Mangold (\"Logan\"), said that since he showed an early cut of the film to the top executives at Disney (including CEO Bob Iger and studio head Alan Horn), they have been fully behind the movie.\n\n\"They are supporting this movie hard,\" Mangold told Business Insider before the movie showed at the Toronto International Film Festival. \"This is a great example of what they hope to see from Fox. It's the kind of movie Disney hasn't made, so it does expand their portfolio.\"\n\n\"Ford v Ferrari\" director James Mangold. AP\n\nIt's very true.\n\nDisney has mostly given up on anything that isn't a sure win at the box office, whether that is \"Star Wars\" movies, Marvel titles, or live-action versions of its animated classics. Though it's led to the studio dominating the global box office for multiple years. Outside the animation categories, the studio hasn't gotten much love at the Oscars. Yes, the Marvel hit \"Black Panther\" scored the studio a best-picture nomination at this year's Academy Awards, but that was the first time the studio had a film in that category since Steven Spielberg's \"Bridge of Spies\" was nominated at the 88th Academy Awards in 2016.\n\nWith the Fox acquisition, Disney now has ownership of Fox Searchlight, the art-house arm of the studio that is always in the running come Oscar time (its last best-picture win was \"The Shape of Water\" in 2018). And if Mangold is correct, and Disney wants Fox to make more movies like \"Ford v Ferrari,\" that's a good sign for moviegoers who are seeking something with a little more substance than most of the titles Disney releases and is bigger in scope than what Searchlight has to offer.\n\nRead more: Jennifer Lopez is getting major Oscar buzz for her performance in \"Hustlers\" and it's fully deserved\n\nSony proved with Quentin Tarantino's \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" that movies not based on popular intellectual property could bring in the coin. The movie has made over $300 million globally on a $90 million budget.\n\n\"Ford v Ferrari,\" also made for $90 million, according to Mangold, could find similar success. But even more importantly, it could become a blueprint for Disney in bringing audiences more powerful dramas, which have disappeared from the wide-release calendar.\n\nAnd Mangold hopes to be one of the directors to make them.\n\n\"The truth is I haven't found an interest yet in terms of a movie or a property to develop that Fox and the new Fox/Disney haven't been supportive of,\" he said. \"So I think they are looking for new ideas.\"", "description": "Disney wants the Fox movies going forward to be thrilling dramas made on a high level like James Mangold's Oscar contender, \"Ford v Ferrari,\" he said.", "authors": ["Jason Guerrasio"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7a552b2e22af19d07d8af3-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
