Bannon reportedly pushes back in a new book against the \u201cdeep state\u201d theory believed by some current members of the administration.\n\nThe \u201cdeep state conspiracy theory is for nut cases,\u201d Mr. Bannon is quoted as saying in a new book released next week, \u201cDeep State: Trump, the FBI and the Rule of Law\u201d by James B. Stewart, The Guardian reported Friday.\n\nProponents of the deep state theory purport in part that holdovers from previous administrations are secretly manipulating the government from within. Mr. Trump himself has repeatedly referenced the theory, and senior White House adviser Stephen Miller recently said that a \u201cdeep state operative\u201d is behind the whistleblower complaint that triggered Democrats to launch an impeachment inquiry into the president last week.\n\nMr. Bannon, the president\u2019s former chief strategist, reasoned in the book that a \u201cdeep state\u201d does not exist within the U.S. government because \u201cAmerica isn\u2019t Turkey or Egypt,\u201d The Guardian reported.\n\nReferring to existing government bureaucracy, Mr. Bannon said that \u201cthere\u2019s nothing \u2018deep\u2019 about it. It\u2019s right in your face,\u201d according to The Guardian.\n\nMr. Trump has suggested that a \u201cdeep state\u201d exists as recently as on Twitter last month, and Mr. Miller, a senior presidential adviser, made a similar claim on Fox News last week.\n\n\u201cThis is a deep state operative, pure and simple,\u201d Mr. Miller said Sunday about the unknown member of the U.S. intelligence community who filed a whistleblower complaint that resulted in Mr. Trump facing the possibility of impeachment.\n\nMr. Bannon, 65, was the executive chairman of conservative website Breitbart News until leaving to join Mr. Trump\u2019s election campaign and eventually his administration. He served as a White House chief strategist for about eight months before leaving in August 2017 and subsequently re-joining Breitbart briefly.\n\nWhile a Google search conducted for references to \u201cdeep state\u201d appearing on Breitbart.com returned about 17,600 results, Mr. Bannon has pushed back against the label in the past.\n\n\u201cThere is a cabal of Republic establishment figures who believe Donald Trump is not fit to be president of the United States. This is a crisis,\u201d Mr. Bannon said last year. \u201cI am not a conspiracy guy \u2026 I have said there is no deep state. It is an in-your-face state.\u201d\n\nMore recently, Mr. Bannon last week compared the start of the impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump to the \u201cshot at Fort Sumter\u201d that spurred the American Civil War.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
